A public golf course known as the Merced Hills Golf Course had been constructed at the site in the early 1990s. This course was shut down to make way for the new campus when the original site for the campus was made unavailable due to the discovery of [[fairy shrimp]] - an endangered species - on the originally proposed site. Since the construction of the golf course had negated concerns about wetland and vernal pool environmental issues, building the campus at this location was easier than fighting to save the original construction site. Two small bridges on campus date from the time of the golf course.\n\nUC Merced established a satellite campus in [[Bakersfield, California]] in 2001 in its downtown [[Education District, Bakersfield|University Square]]. The satellite campus advocated a UC education to prospective college-bound students of [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] and the southern San Joaquin Valley before UC Merced opened its official campus in Merced. Classes and counseling were also provided at the Bakersfield center to newly admitted UC students. In 2011, UC Merced closed its Bakersfield campus in a cost-cutting effort.

During the Fall 2005 semester, while construction of the Classroom and Science/Engineering buildings was still taking place, all academic courses were conducted in the library.  Its official motto is \"Not what other research libraries are, what they will be.\"\n\nThe Library building is named after Leo and Dottie Kolligian. Leo served as the Chairman of the UC Board of Regents in 1988 when the Board decided to explore building a 10th campus, in the San Joaquin Valley. The first floor of the library was dedicated by Ed and Jeanne Kashian. The McFadden-Willis Reading Room is located on the fourth floor and named in honor of the McFadden and Willis children by Christine McFadden. The Library also has a technology classroom dedicated by Doris Gonella in honor of her late husband Louis, The Gonella Discovery Room.\n\nThe library offers 10 public workstations for students, faculty, staff and visitors to access electronic resources.  The library contains more electronic holdings than print holdings, consisting of about 70,000 online journals and 3.965 million electronic books (including 3.15 million [[HathiTrust]] full-text books), compared to 102,000 print books. In addition, the library provides access to 580 databases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.ucmerced.edu/about/library-facts |title=Library Facts |publisher=UC Merced Library |accessdate=2014-06-02}}</ref>\n\nKolligian is a [[Green library]] and has Gold [[LEED certification]].<ref name=\"SignKolligian\">{{cite web|url=http://administration.ucmerced.edu/sites/administration/files/public/documents/SignKolligian.pdf|title=Leo & Dottie Kolligian Library Sign|accessdate=20 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227010331/http://administration.ucmerced.edu/sites/administration/files/public/documents/SignKolligian.pdf|archivedate=2012-02-27}}</ref>\n\n==Athletics==\n{{Main|UC Merced Golden Bobcats}}\n\nUC Merced's recently established an intercollegiate athletic program presently competes in the [[California Pacific Conference]] of the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]].

A public golf course known as the Merced Hills Golf Course had been constructed at the site in the early 1990s. This course was shut down to make way for the new campus when the original site for the campus was made unavailable due to the discovery of [[fairy shrimp]] - an endangered species - on the originally proposed site. Since the construction of the golf course had negated concerns about wetland and vernal pool environmental issues, building the campus at this location was easier than fighting to save the original construction site. Two small bridges on campus date from the time of the golf course.\n\nUC Merced established a satellite campus in [[Bakersfield, California]] in 2001 in its downtown [[Education District, Bakersfield|University Square]].

He became a priest in 1776 and served in that capacity in Ireland for more than four decades. After the Pope declined to appoint him [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archbishop of Armagh]], the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Bishop of Philadelphia]] in 1819. Wake up early, eat your vegetables, brush your teeth after every meal.\n\nonwell took up the post at an advanced age and spent much of his time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process and recalled him to Rome. \n\nAlthough he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his [[coadjutor bishop]], [[Francis Kenrick]]. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about 94.\n\n==Early life and priesthood==\nConwell was born about 1748 in [[Moneymore]], [[County Londonderry]], Ireland (present-day [[Northern Ireland]]), the son of Owen Conwell and his wife, Mary (Keegan) Conwell.{{efn|Earlier sources give Conwell's date of birth as about 1745, but an Irish researcher, Brother Luke of De La Salle Monastery in [[Muine Bheag]], later discovered evidence that it was likely 1748.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}}}{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}} He studied at the [[Irish College in Paris]] and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood there in November 1776.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} \n\nConwell was well-educated, being fluent in Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian, but had a reputation as a preacher of only modest ability.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=166}} Around 1785, he contemplated moving to the United States but was concerned about the still uncertain financial state of the new country's parishes, and ultimately decided not to apply for a position there.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} He was appointed [[parish priest]] of [[Dungannon]] in 1792 or 1793 and [[Vicar General]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archdiocese of Armagh]] in 1794.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} After the death of Archbishop [[Richard O'Reilly]] in 1818, Conwell served as acting Archbishop.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}}\n\n==Bishop of Philadelphia==\n===Ordination===\nMany of the clergy who served under him in Armagh recommended that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland.{{sfn|MacAuley|1982|pp=342\u2013343}} The British government also objected, favoring [[Patrick Curtis]] instead, as they saw him as more friendly to their interests.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} [[Pope Pius VII]] appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the [[Episcopal see|sees]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] or [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore|Madras]]; Conwell chose Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on 24 September 1819, by Bishop [[William Poynter]], the [[Vicar Apostolic of the London District]], assisted by Fathers [[James Bramston (bishop)|James Bramston]] and [[Joseph Francis Carpue]].{{efn|Although three bishops are typically required for ordination, the Pope may issue a dispensation when co-consecrators are unavailable.{{sfn|Code of Canon Law}} }}{{sfn|Bransom|1990|p=13}}\n\nThe see of Philadelphia had been vacant since the death of Bishop [[Michael Francis Egan]] in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}} Archbishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] of Baltimore, whose [[Ecclesiastical province|province]] included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, [[Louis de Barth]]) had turned the job down.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} Part of the delay was logistical\u2014Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province\u2014but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches in a part of the nation with [[Pennsylvania#Religion|few Catholics]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} \n\nThere was also a significant dispute (known as [[trusteeism]]) over the rights of churches' [[Laity|lay]] trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church-owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization.{{sfn|Carey|1978|pp=357\u2013358}} In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|p=368}}\n\n===Hogan schism===\n{{see| William Hogan (priest)}}\n[[File:Old St. Mary's Church.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia was the epicenter of the disputes that overshadowed Conwell's episcopate.]]\nConwell arrived in [[Philadelphia]] on 2 December 1820.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy preceding his arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], approached de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1913|pp=23\u201324}} After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan was assigned to [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]]. Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan's general conduct created tension with Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already moved out of the priests' residence at [[Old St. Joseph's Church]] to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to say where he should live.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}}\n\nLater that week, Conwell called a meeting of the city's priests and announced that Hogan was suspended. The trustees took Hogan's side, while Conwell condemned the trustees as \"despicable ex-Catholics\" and \"the worst sort of [[Jacobin]]s\".{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91-92}} In the meantime, Conwell recalled a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] \u2014 William Vincent Harold, whom his predecessor had dismissed\u2014to assist him.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The St. Mary's trustees had quarreled with Harold in the past, and his recall increased their mistrust of Conwell.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The schism continued as St. Mary's refused to recognize Conwell's authority over them or Hogan, explicitly excluding Conwell from their board and electing Hogan in his place. Since they had rebelled against the Church hierarchy, Conwell declared Hogan [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]] in a public statement on 27 May 1821.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=94}}\n\nIn 1822, Conwell showed his support for Harold by appointing him as Vicar General of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The Hogan schism took on new dimensions, however, when Hogan was charged with rape and battery.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} Philadelphia mayor [[Robert Wharton (Philadelphia)|Robert Wharton]] presided over the trial, which captured the city's attention.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|pp=357\u2013359}} Although the jury found him not guilty, Hogan's image was harmed.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} A letter from the Pope sided with Conwell but, after initially agreeing to leave the diocese, Hogan reversed himself and stayed on.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} The pro-Hogan faction prevailed at St. Mary's trustee elections that year amid bloody rioting between parish members.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} The next year, 1823, some Hogan supporters convinced a local woman to bring a paternity suit against Conwell, but the charges were dismissed quickly and the complainant was convicted of [[perjury]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} In an 1824 letter to the ''[[National Gazette]],'' Hogan proposed the creation of an \"American Catholic Church\" with more independence from Rome.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}} By this time, Hogan had begun to lose the trustees' support.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}} At some point soon thereafter, he left the city  {{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} (later he completely left the Church and became a vehement anti-Catholic propagandist).{{cn|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn hopes of healing the schism, in October 1826, Conwell partially capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior pastor of the church. The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=100}}\n\n===Recall to Rome===\nThe trustees soon renounced the agreement. When word of the compromise reached the [[Holy See]], the Vatican also objected, condemning Conwell's surrender of episcopal rights. Harold, writing to Rome, claimed that Conwell had had little to do with the compromise, which he blamed on Father [[Michael Hurley (19th-century priest)|Michael Hurley]] and Conwell's Protestant lawyer, Josiah Randall.{{efn|Josiah Randall would soon become the father of [[Samuel J. Randall]], a future [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|House|1934|pp=1\u20135}} }}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} Conwell saw Harold's conduct as a betrayal, and removed him as Vicar General, appointing Hurley in his place.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} The trustees put aside their former enmity for Harold and took his side against Conwell, going so far as to petition Rome for Conwell's removal as bishop.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} By this time, as Arthur Ennis wrote in 1976, the \"old and confused\" Conwell considered leaving the diocese if he could secure another see in Ireland.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} \n\nIn 1827, the Vatican's ''[[Propaganda Fide]]'' formally rejected Conwell's pact with the trustees, condemning Hurley's role in the process, as well.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} They summoned Conwell to Rome.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} [[Ambrose Mar\u00e9chal]], who was now Archbishop of Baltimore, was ordered to oversee the diocese in Conwell's absence, and he appointed a priest from his diocese, [[William Matthews (priest)|William Matthews]], as apostolic administrator.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=103}} Conwell sailed for Rome on 12 July 1828.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Once there, Conwell was ordered to give a report of all that had transpired. While forbidden to return to his diocese, he was promised that after a full explanation, he would be permitted to reside anywhere in Europe.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} He left Rome secretly in 1829, and when his absence was discovered, the Pope decreed he would be suspended from office if he returned to Philadelphia.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Conwell did return to Philadelphia, however, in October of that year, and traveled from there to Baltimore, where the [[Provincial Councils of Baltimore|First Provincial Council of Baltimore]] was in session.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\n===Retirement===\n[[File:2013 Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul from across the Benjamin Franklin Parkway 2.jpg|thumb|Conwell is buried in the crypt of the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Philadelphia)|Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul]] along with most other bishops of Philadelphia.]]\nIn Baltimore, Conwell professed his obedience to Rome and swore he would gladly retire from active governance of his diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} The following year, the Vatican appointed [[Francis Kenrick]] as Conwell's [[coadjutor bishop]] with the right of succession and named him administrator of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Conwell never gave up his titles or his claim to exercise authority in the diocese, and his relationship with Kenrick remained rocky.{{sfn|Barr|2008|p=615}} He received permission to resume performing [[liturgy|liturgical]] functions without any say in administration, and spent his remaining years in seclusion and prayer.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} He lived on for several years, although he lost his sight, preventing him from performing most of his few remaining duties.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\nConwell died on 22 April 1842, at about the age of 94. Kenrick succeeded to the title of bishop of Philadelphia.

He became a priest in 1776 and served in that capacity in Ireland for more than four decades. After the Pope declined to appoint him [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archbishop of Armagh]], the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Bishop of Philadelphia]] in 1819. \n\nConwell took up the post at an advanced age and spent much of his time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, especially those of [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process and recalled him to Rome. \n\nAlthough he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his [[coadjutor bishop]], [[Francis Kenrick]]. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about 94.\n\n==Early life and priesthood==\nConwell was born about 1748 in [[Moneymore]], [[County Londonderry]], Ireland (present-day [[Northern Ireland]]), the son of Owen Conwell and his wife, Mary (Keegan) Conwell.{{efn|Earlier sources give Conwell's date of birth as about 1745, but an Irish researcher, Brother Luke of De La Salle Monastery in [[Muine Bheag]], later discovered evidence that it was likely 1748.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}}}{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}} He studied at the [[Irish College in Paris]] and was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] to the priesthood there in November 1776.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=162}}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} \n\nConwell was well-educated, being fluent in Latin, French, Spanish, and Italian, but had a reputation as a preacher of only modest ability.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=166}} Around 1785, he contemplated moving to the United States but was concerned about the still uncertain financial state of the new country's parishes, and ultimately decided not to apply for a position there.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=86}} He was appointed [[parish priest]] of [[Dungannon]] in 1792 or 1793 and [[Vicar General]] of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Armagh|Archdiocese of Armagh]] in 1794.{{sfn|Luke|1940|pp=291\u2013292}}{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} After the death of Archbishop [[Richard O'Reilly]] in 1818, Conwell served as acting Archbishop.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}}\n\n==Bishop of Philadelphia==\n===Ordination===\nMany of the clergy who served under him in Armagh recommended that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland.{{sfn|MacAuley|1982|pp=342\u2013343}} The British government also objected, favoring [[Patrick Curtis]] instead, as they saw him as more friendly to their interests.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} [[Pope Pius VII]] appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the [[Episcopal see|sees]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] or [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Madras and Mylapore|Madras]]; Conwell chose Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1915|p=163}} Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on 24 September 1819, by Bishop [[William Poynter]], the [[Vicar Apostolic of the London District]], assisted by Fathers [[James Bramston (bishop)|James Bramston]] and [[Joseph Francis Carpue]].{{efn|Although three bishops are typically required for ordination, the Pope may issue a dispensation when co-consecrators are unavailable.{{sfn|Code of Canon Law}} }}{{sfn|Bransom|1990|p=13}}\n\nThe see of Philadelphia had been vacant since the death of Bishop [[Michael Francis Egan]] in 1814, despite several efforts to fill it.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}} Archbishop [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]] of Baltimore, whose [[Ecclesiastical province|province]] included Philadelphia, had considered no fewer than fifteen priests for the position; some had been ruled out for one reason or another, and others (including the apostolic administrator, [[Louis de Barth]]) had turned the job down.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} Part of the delay was logistical\u2014Carroll was unsure of the exact procedure for selecting a candidate in the recently erected province\u2014but part was due to the perceived undesirability of the post, which oversaw only a few small churches in a part of the nation with [[Pennsylvania#Religion|few Catholics]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|pp=80\u201381}} \n\nThere was also a significant dispute (known as [[trusteeism]]) over the rights of churches' [[Laity|lay]] trustees that was likely to complicate the job of running the diocese. In Europe, the Church-owned property and directly controlled its parishes through the clergy. In the United States, however, early Catholic churches were typically founded by laymen who purchased the property, and erected the church buildings. Those laypeople accordingly demanded some control over the administration of the parish, even after the arrival of clergy from Europe who held the traditional view of parish organization.{{sfn|Carey|1978|pp=357\u2013358}} In a larger sense, the dispute represented a difference in understandings of authority between Americans and Europeans.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|p=368}}\n\n===Hogan schism===\n{{see| William Hogan (priest)}}\n[[File:Old St. Mary's Church.jpg|thumb|[[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]] in Philadelphia was the epicenter of the disputes that overshadowed Conwell's episcopate.]]\nConwell arrived in [[Philadelphia]] on 2 December 1820.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy preceding his arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, [[William Hogan (priest)|William Hogan]], approached de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia.{{sfn|Griffin|1913|pp=23\u201324}} After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan was assigned to [[St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church (Philadelphia)|St. Mary's Church]]. Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}} Hogan's general conduct created tension with Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already moved out of the priests' residence at [[Old St. Joseph's Church]] to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; his detractors said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to say where he should live.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91}}\n\nLater that week, Conwell called a meeting of the city's priests and announced that Hogan was suspended. The trustees took Hogan's side, while Conwell condemned the trustees as \"despicable ex-Catholics\" and \"the worst sort of [[Jacobin]]s\".{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=91-92}} In the meantime, Conwell recalled a [[Dominican Order|Dominican friar]] \u2014 William Vincent Harold, whom his predecessor had dismissed\u2014to assist him.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} The St. Mary's trustees had quarreled with Harold in the past, and his recall increased their mistrust of Conwell.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The schism continued as St. Mary's refused to recognize Conwell's authority over them or Hogan, explicitly excluding Conwell from their board and electing Hogan in his place. Since they had rebelled against the Church hierarchy, Conwell declared Hogan [[Excommunication (Catholic Church)|excommunicated]] in a public statement on 27 May 1821.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=94}}\n\nIn 1822, Conwell showed his support for Harold by appointing him as Vicar General of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=93}} The Hogan schism took on new dimensions, however, when Hogan was charged with rape and battery.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} Philadelphia mayor [[Robert Wharton (Philadelphia)|Robert Wharton]] presided over the trial, which captured the city's attention.{{sfn|Hessinger|2011|pp=357\u2013359}} Although the jury found him not guilty, Hogan's image was harmed.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} A letter from the Pope sided with Conwell but, after initially agreeing to leave the diocese, Hogan reversed himself and stayed on.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} The pro-Hogan faction prevailed at St. Mary's trustee elections that year amid bloody rioting between parish members.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} The next year, 1823, some Hogan supporters convinced a local woman to bring a paternity suit against Conwell, but the charges were dismissed quickly and the complainant was convicted of [[perjury]].{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=95}} In an 1824 letter to the ''[[National Gazette]],'' Hogan proposed the creation of an \"American Catholic Church\" with more independence from Rome.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}} By this time, Hogan had begun to lose the trustees' support.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=97}} At some point soon thereafter, he left the city  {{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=99}} (later he completely left the Church and became a vehement anti-Catholic propagandist).{{cn|date=April 2020}} \n\nIn hopes of healing the schism, in October 1826, Conwell partially capitulated to the trustees, yielding to them the right of determining salaries and of vetoing his appointments.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} In return, they recognized him as bishop and senior pastor of the church. The bishop would henceforth appoint St. Mary's pastor, but the trustees would be permitted to arbitrate any disagreements on appointments before a neutral board.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=100}}\n\n===Recall to Rome===\nThe trustees soon renounced the agreement. When word of the compromise reached the [[Holy See]], the Vatican also objected, condemning Conwell's surrender of episcopal rights. Harold, writing to Rome, claimed that Conwell had had little to do with the compromise, which he blamed on Father [[Michael Hurley (19th-century priest)|Michael Hurley]] and Conwell's Protestant lawyer, Josiah Randall.{{efn|Josiah Randall would soon become the father of [[Samuel J. Randall]], a future [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]].{{sfn|House|1934|pp=1\u20135}} }}{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} Conwell saw Harold's conduct as a betrayal, and removed him as Vicar General, appointing Hurley in his place.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} The trustees put aside their former enmity for Harold and took his side against Conwell, going so far as to petition Rome for Conwell's removal as bishop.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=101}} By this time, as Arthur Ennis wrote in 1976, the \"old and confused\" Conwell considered leaving the diocese if he could secure another see in Ireland.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} \n\nIn 1827, the Vatican's ''[[Propaganda Fide]]'' formally rejected Conwell's pact with the trustees, condemning Hurley's role in the process, as well.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=102}} They summoned Conwell to Rome.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} [[Ambrose Mar\u00e9chal]], who was now Archbishop of Baltimore, was ordered to oversee the diocese in Conwell's absence, and he appointed a priest from his diocese, [[William Matthews (priest)|William Matthews]], as apostolic administrator.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=103}} Conwell sailed for Rome on 12 July 1828.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Once there, Conwell was ordered to give a report of all that had transpired. While forbidden to return to his diocese, he was promised that after a full explanation, he would be permitted to reside anywhere in Europe.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} He left Rome secretly in 1829, and when his absence was discovered, the Pope decreed he would be suspended from office if he returned to Philadelphia.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Conwell did return to Philadelphia, however, in October of that year, and traveled from there to Baltimore, where the [[Provincial Councils of Baltimore|First Provincial Council of Baltimore]] was in session.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\n===Retirement===\n[[File:2013 Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul from across the Benjamin Franklin Parkway 2.jpg|thumb|Conwell is buried in the crypt of the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Philadelphia)|Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul]] along with most other bishops of Philadelphia.]]\nIn Baltimore, Conwell professed his obedience to Rome and swore he would gladly retire from active governance of his diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} The following year, the Vatican appointed [[Francis Kenrick]] as Conwell's [[coadjutor bishop]] with the right of succession and named him administrator of the diocese.{{sfn|Ennis|1976|p=104}} Conwell never gave up his titles or his claim to exercise authority in the diocese, and his relationship with Kenrick remained rocky.{{sfn|Barr|2008|p=615}} He received permission to resume performing [[liturgy|liturgical]] functions without any say in administration, and spent his remaining years in seclusion and prayer.{{sfn|Loughlin|1908}} He lived on for several years, although he lost his sight, preventing him from performing most of his few remaining duties.{{sfn|Shea|1886|p=156}}\n\nConwell died on 22 April 1842, at about the age of 94. Kenrick succeeded to the title of bishop of Philadelphia.

Having no permanent drummer at the time, they recruited Best a few days before their departure. After breaking their contract by playing at another club, Harrison was deported for being underaged, and McCartney and Best were arrested and deported for attempted arson.\n\nThe Beatles first met [[Astrid Kirchherr]] in Hamburg, who was instrumental in their adoption of the mop topped [[Beatle haircut]]. During their period in Hamburg, Sutcliffe decided to leave the group to continue his studies. In April 1962, less than a year after leaving the group, he suffered a [[brain hemorrhage]] and died as a result.\n\n==Hamburg in the 1960s==\nHamburg had once been Germany's main seaport, the fourth largest in the world, but during [[World War II]] in 1943 virtually the entire city was reduced to rubble by bombing raids. By 1960, when they arrived, the Hamburg that had grown up from the ruins of WWII had established a reputation throughout Europe as a city of vice and criminal activity.{{sfn|Pawlowski|1990|p=24}} In contrast to an economically depressed post-war Liverpool, Hamburg was a wealthy city.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=64}}\n\n===Leaving Liverpool===\nWilliams, a 29-year-old Liverpool businessman and promoter, had sent his leading group, Derry and the Seniors (later known as [[Howie Casey]] and the Seniors)<ref name=\"IntheBeginningp1\">{{cite web |first=Bill |last=Harry |url=http://www.triumphpc.com/mersey-beat/a-z/howiecasie.shtml |title= In the Beginning...

In September 1961, Harrison had a German copy of the record, which Sutcliffe had sent to him, as he was still in Hamburg.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=252}} Harrison loaned it to Bob Wooler (The Cavern Club DJ) who played it at various venues, when the members of the group lent it to him.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=252}} On 28 October 1961, the 27-year-old Epstein, manager of the record department in his father's NEMS music store in Whitechapel Street, Liverpool, was asked for the record by an 18-year-old boy, Raymond Jones (Epstein's record department sales manager subsequently stated in a 2000s TV documentary the name 'Raymond Jones' was made up by him as part of his standard practice of ordering in foreign records that NEMS would not have ordinarily ordered due to selling risks and supplier's minimum order quantity (25 units). He also stated upon receipt of the records from Germany he himself paid for the record under that name when it came in. Several teenagers had pestered him about the record and they kept coming back asking, and he got tired of having to tell them they didn't have it in stock, so he initiated the order himself). Epstein could find nothing on his files about the Beatles or the record, but the following day it was requested again by two girls, this time mentioning that the Beatles had been seen playing at the Cavern, a club in nearby Mathew Street.<ref name=\"Hill 2007 p15\">{{harvnb|Hill|2007|p=15}}</ref> [[Alistair Taylor]] (Epstein's assistant) later said that the story had been invented and that he had used the name Jones to order copies of the record himself.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=252}}\n\nMersey Beat founder Bill Harry later repudiated the story about Epstein not knowing who the Beatles were, as Harry had been talking to Epstein about the band for a long time (being the group he promoted the most in ''[[Mersey Beat]]'') and by McCartney saying, \"Brian [Epstein] knew perfectly well who the Beatles were, they were on the front page of the second issue of ''Mersey Beat''.\"<ref name=\"TheBirthofMerseyBeatp5\">{{cite web |first= |last= |url=http://www.mersey-beat.com/ |title=The Birth of Mersey Beat (p5) |publisher=Bill Harry/Mersey Beat Ltd. |accessdate=12 June 2009}}</ref> Regardless, the interest in the record eventually led Epstein to make his way to the Cavern with Taylor, during lunch hour on 9 November 1961.

Kirchherr, Voormann's girlfriend, was initially horrified at the idea of spending any time in such a sordid district, but Voormann, after watching the Beatles several times without her, eventually persuaded her to come too.{{sfn|Pawlowski|1990|pp=25-27}} After having previously only listened to [[trad jazz]], [[the Platters]], and [[Nat King Cole]], the [[Rock n' Roll]] that the Beatles played was totally new to them.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=222}}{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=62}} The three friends visited the Kaiserkeller almost every night, arriving at 9 o'clock and sitting by the front of the stage.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=221}} Kirchherr, then 22 years old, later said: \"It was like a merry-go-round in my head, they looked absolutely astonishing... My whole life changed in a couple of minutes.

Harrison had positive memories of the period: \"I'd have to say with hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times.

Their experiments often cause problems that he must resolve and he must sometimes fight villains in the process. He occasionally saves the world with his sisters' inventions.\n\nOn June 11, 2013, Teletoon announced that the series had been renewed for a seventh season, to consist of 13 episodes and a three-part special.<ref name=\"newswire1\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1181701/inspector-gadget-reboot-tops-off-teletoon-canada-s-latest-original-production-slate |title=TELETOON Canada Inc. &#124; Inspector Gadget Reboot Tops Off TELETOON Canada's Latest Original Production Slate |publisher=Newswire.ca |date=2013-06-11 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref> However, in response to a tweet on June 25, 2015, regarding a seventh season, voice actor [[James Arnold Taylor]] stated that he was unaware of any plans for a seventh season.<ref name=season7>{{Cite tweet |user=jatactor|author=James Arnold Taylor |number=614207327277871104 |date=June 25, 2015|title=Is there any chance of season 7 of Johnny test coming out? |access-date=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn March 15, 2019, the official ''Johnny Test'' [[YouTube]] channel released a video confirming the show would inspire a series of web-shorts by [[WildBrain Spark]], a subsidiary of [[WildBrain]] that produces original content for online distribution.

The Test Twins frequently use Johnny as a [[Human experimentation|guinea pig]] for their various experiments and inventions in their laboratory filled with highly advanced technology built in over the Tests' household attic, with most of which they try to impress their pretty boy next-door neighbor, Gil, for whom both harbor a deep love and obsession, although their attempts to come up with some way to attract his attention usually end in failure.\n\nJohnny is a troublesome and mischievous boy who causes problems in the family and often within the city. His best friend is his [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] talking pet dog, Dukey, who Susan and Mary gave human-level intelligence and the ability to speak in an experiment. Because Johnny has Susan, Mary and Dukey by his side, he can live any kid's dream, only to find that most dreams never turn out as hoped. He is very hyperactive and often messes with his sisters' inventions, causing trouble and mayhem, but just as often proves himself to be clever such as by frequently tricking his sisters or saving the day from whatever danger happens to show up. Johnny is also stubborn and a bit spoiled, as he gets what he wants through deceit, blackmail, or manipulation. However, he does have a sense of justice and always learns from his mistakes. However, he, like most kids, does not like school; if anything, he goes to great lengths to avoid doing work, often using his sisters' inventions to do so and often putting himself and/or others in trouble as a result.\n\nOne of Johnny's main nemeses is Eugene \"Bling-Bling Boy\" Hamilton, a fellow [[wikt:archrival|arch-rival]] of the Test sisters and [[frienemy]] of Johnny and Dukey, who has an unrequited [[Puppy love|crush]] on Susan. Another is Sissy Blakely, a tomboy who often serves as Johnny's rival/friend; the two are believed to have crushes on each other, but each would instantly deny it, and they also constantly compete against each other. Missy, Sissy's pink [[labradoodle]], is also Dukey's rival/crush. A third is Bumper, the school bully who constantly picks on Johnny. Meanwhile, the General from the [[army base]] Area 51.1 and Mr. Black and Mr. White, two [[Law enforcement agency|federal agents]] from the Super Secret Government Agency (SSGA), are shown to be close friends with the kids and often get them out of trouble or recruit them for an assignment, or simply help, distract, and/or annoy the Tests on various occasions.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Johnny Test episodes}}\n{{:List of Johnny Test episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Johnny Test characters}}\n* Johnny Test (voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]])\n* Dukey (voiced by [[Louis Chirillo]] in seasons 1\u20134, and by [[Trevor Devall]] in seasons 5\u20136)\n* Susan Test (voiced by [[Maryke Hendrikse]])\n* Mary Test (voiced by Brittney Wilson in seasons 1 and 5, and [[Ashleigh Ball]] in seasons 2\u20134 and 6)\n* Hugh Test (voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]])\n* Lila Test (voiced by [[Kathleen Barr]])\n* Gil Nexdor (voiced by [[Andrew Francis]])\n* Mr. Black (voiced by [[Bill Mondy]])\n* Mr. White (voiced by [[Scott McNeil]])\n\n==Background==\n\n===Origin and development===\nOn February 16, 2005, [[Kids' WB]]'s unveiling of its new fall schedule for the [[2005\u201306 United States network television schedule|2005\u20132006 television season]] was announced by [[The WB|The WB Television Network]], featuring its returning series ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!

The show premiered on September 17, 2005, on Kids' WB's [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning]] lineup of its weekly fall schedule, alongside ''Loonatics Unleashed'' and ''Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island''. The episode pair \"Johnny to the Center of the Earth\" and \"Johnny X\" marked the series premiere.\n\nWhen the show first aired on Kids' WB (season 1 only), it performed very well in the Nielsen ratings. It ranked as the #1 broadcast program in Girl 2-11 (garnering 2.2/10), ranked as the #2 broadcast series in Kids 2-11 (gaining 2.3/11 in the process) and Girls 6-11 (2.4/11), and ultimately ranking #3 in Kids 6-11 (receiving 3.0/14). Its second season received a slightly higher number of viewers on average in the United States: 2.6 million viewers per 2nd-season episode. Its 3rd season's average number of viewers in the United States was 3.1 million viewers. Its 4th season got an average number of about 4.3 million viewers per episode in the United States. Its 5th premiere attracted over 4.7 million viewers in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1111667,00.html|title=Looney Tunes-Inspired \"Loonatics Unleashed\" Remains #1 Broadcast Kids' Series Second Week in a Row Among All Key Demos|date=September 29, 2005|work=Time Warner|accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref>\n\nThe series was developed for television by [[Aaron Simpson (producer)|Aaron Simpson]], with a brief, slightly longer pre-existing pilot short produced by Simpson as well, before the show was picked up as a full series by Kids' WB. Based on Episode 1A \"Johnny to the Center of the Earth\", the pilot episode was animated roughly in [[Adobe Flash]], but retaining the same plot, used the same color schemes as the aforementioned episode, and was recorded with an American voice cast (retaining [[James Arnold Taylor]] as the voice of Johnny Test) instead. The original production design (including character designs, prop designs and background designs) was created, provided and contributed by [[Matt Danner]] and Marc Perry,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aaaron.com/blog/?p=3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707072406/http://aaaron.com/blog/?p=3|url-status=dead|title=Johnny Test Logo|archivedate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> and then later worked on by producer [[Chris Savino]] and art director Paul Stec. Fellows, the creator of the series who had interested the network in the series' premise, based the titular character on himself when he was a young boy; he based Johnny's twin sisters, Susan and Mary, on his own two sisters, also named Susan and Mary.<ref name=\"James Arnold Taylor - Johnny Test\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jamesarnoldtaylor.com/character_pages/johnny_test.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031055714/http://jamesarnoldtaylor.com/character_pages/johnny_test.html|url-status=dead|title=James Arnold Taylor - Johnny Test|archivedate=October 31, 2009}}</ref> In the original pilot and early promotional material of the show, Dukey was referred to as \"Poochie\".\n\nJames Arnold Taylor said that he was not Fellows' original choice for the role of Johnny Test; he had previously voiced the lead character in the initial test pilot. After the show got picked up by Kids' WB! as a series, he was initially going to be replaced by a different voice actor, with a Canadian voice cast instead, but the studio had trouble finding Johnny's initial voice convincing for the first six episodes, so they gave Taylor back the role to redub his dialog for the rest of the first season, and managed to keep him on the cast for the rest of the series.<ref name=\"James Arnold Taylor - Johnny Test\"/> Aaron Simpson, who had developed the series and produced the pilot, was the creator and executive producer's first choice to serve as the producer of the show, before he turned it down.\n\n===Production===\nThe remainder of the first season was produced in-house by [[Warner Bros. Animation]], but since the show was a U.S./Canada co-production, some of the animation production work was outsourced to Canadian animation studios [[Studio B Productions]] and Top Draw Animation, as well as South Korean animation production company [[Digital eMation]], which also provided the original main title animation opening. Storyboarding of some of the episodes was done by [[Atomic Cartoons]].\n\nMany of the original writers, storyboarders, and art crew of the series' first production season were recycled,{{clarify|date=July 2019|reason=\"recycled\"?}} including familiar [[Cartoon Network Studios]] and [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]] alumni, as well as some from WB Animation, [[Disney Television Animation|Walt Disney Television Animation]] and [[DIC Entertainment]], and even the [[comic book industry]], including [[Chris Savino]], Marc Perry, Paul Stec, Matt Danner, Joe Horne, [[Mike Kazaleh]], Brian Larsen, [[Jun Falkenstein]], [[Scott Shaw!]], Nora Johnson, [[Milton Knight]], Ray Leong,<ref>Johnny Test character clean-up model sheet by Ray Leong, at [https://www.flickr.com/photos/ray_leong/2314964234/|Johnny Test Characters|Flickr - Photo Sharing!]</ref> Chris Battle, Casey Mitchum,<ref>Johnny Test character clean-up model sheets by [[Casey Mitchum]], at his blog site [http://kasefase.blogspot.com/2008_09_01_archive.html Puppies and Paint: September 2008]</ref> Pat Ventura, [[John Derevlany]], J.C.

The first game, ''Johnny Test: Clone Zapper'', finds Johnny Test and Dukey engaged to combat an army of Johnny clones they accidentally created  from a clone machine, with the help of two special laser zapper guns as their only weapons to defeat the clones and destroy them personally, and the second game, ''Johnny Test: Bot Drop'', sees Johnny, Dukey and the Test twins going on a rescue chase, with Johnny and Dukey both piloting a bot drop plane to use the robot clones of Johnnies (first seen in ''[[List of Johnny Test episodes#101 Johnnies|101 Johnnies]]'') for the titular \"Bot Drops\" to eject them to safety in a moving rescue vehicle driven by Susan and Mary. In the plot of that latter aforementioned game, and like in each level of the game before it, Johnny has to aim and time to drop the robots so they will land safely onto the vehicle, then Johnny Test has saved the day once again. Both games are typical shoot-slinging and side-scrolling games that in all utilize the iPhone, iPod Touch and iPad's unique multi-touch capabilities and scrolling, and, as a whole, players of both games can compete on the worldwide high scores list of each level of the game and competitive players.

They reside in the fictional town of Porkbelly, which is in the USA or Canada. Johnny is often used as a [[Human subject research|test subject]] for his genius twin sisters' inventions and experiments, which range from gadgets to superpowers. Their experiments often cause problems that he must resolve and he must sometimes fight villains in the process. He occasionally saves the world with his sisters' inventions.\n\nOn June 11, 2013, Teletoon announced that the series had been renewed for a seventh season, to consist of 13 episodes and a three-part special.<ref name=\"newswire1\">{{cite press release|url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/1181701/inspector-gadget-reboot-tops-off-teletoon-canada-s-latest-original-production-slate |title=TELETOON Canada Inc. &#124; Inspector Gadget Reboot Tops Off TELETOON Canada's Latest Original Production Slate |publisher=Newswire.ca |date=2013-06-11 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref> However, in response to a tweet on June 25, 2015, regarding a seventh season, voice actor [[James Arnold Taylor]] stated that he was unaware of any plans for a seventh season.<ref name=season7>{{Cite tweet |user=jatactor|author=James Arnold Taylor |number=614207327277871104 |date=June 25, 2015|title=Is there any chance of season 7 of Johnny test coming out? |access-date=September 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nOn March 15, 2019, the official ''Johnny Test'' [[YouTube]] channel released a video confirming the show would inspire a series of web-shorts by [[WildBrain Spark]], a subsidiary of [[WildBrain]] that produces original content for online distribution.

The Test Twins frequently use Johnny as a [[Human experimentation|guinea pig]] for their various experiments and inventions in their laboratory filled with highly advanced technology built in over the Tests' household attic, with most of which they try to impress their pretty boy next-door neighbor, Gil, for whom both harbor a deep love and obsession, although their attempts to come up with some way to attract his attention usually end in failure.\n\nJohnny is a troublesome and mischievous boy who causes problems in the family and often within the city. His best friend is his [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] talking pet dog, Dukey, who Susan and Mary gave human-level intelligence and the ability to speak in an experiment. Because Johnny has Susan, Mary and Dukey by his side, he can live any kid's dream, only to find that most dreams never turn out as hoped. He is very hyperactive and often messes with his sisters' inventions, causing trouble and mayhem, but just as often proves himself to be clever such as by frequently tricking his sisters or saving the day from whatever danger happens to show up. Johnny is also stubborn and a bit spoiled, as he gets what he wants through deceit, blackmail, or manipulation. However, he does have a sense of justice and always learns from his mistakes. However, he, like most kids, does not like school; if anything, he goes to great lengths to avoid doing work, often using his sisters' inventions to do so and often putting himself and/or others in trouble as a result.\n\nOne of Johnny's main nemeses is Eugene \"Bling-Bling Boy\" Hamilton, a fellow [[wikt:archrival|arch-rival]] of the Test sisters and [[frienemy]] of Johnny and Dukey, who has an unrequited [[Puppy love|crush]] on Susan. Another is Sissy Blakely, a tomboy who often serves as Johnny's rival/friend; the two are believed to have crushes on each other, but each would instantly deny it, and they also constantly compete against each other. Missy, Sissy's pink [[labradoodle]], is also Dukey's rival/crush. A third is Bumper, the school bully who constantly picks on Johnny. Meanwhile, the General from the [[army base]] Area 51.1 and Mr. Black and Mr. White, two [[Law enforcement agency|federal agents]] from the Super Secret Government Agency (SSGA), are shown to be close friends with the kids and often get them out of trouble or recruit them for an assignment, or simply help, distract, and/or annoy the Tests on various occasions.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{main|List of Johnny Test episodes}}\n{{:List of Johnny Test episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n{{Main|List of Johnny Test characters}}\n* Johnny Test (voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]])\n* Dukey (voiced by [[Louis Chirillo]] in seasons 1\u20134, and by [[Trevor Devall]] in seasons 5\u20136)\n* Susan Test (voiced by [[Maryke Hendrikse]])\n* Mary Test (voiced by Brittney Wilson in seasons 1 and 5, and [[Ashleigh Ball]] in seasons 2\u20134 and 6)\n* Hugh Test (voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]])\n* Lila Test (voiced by [[Kathleen Barr]])\n* Gil Nexdor (voiced by [[Andrew Francis]])\n* Mr. Black (voiced by [[Bill Mondy]])\n* Mr. White (voiced by [[Scott McNeil]])\n\n==Background==\n\n===Origin and development===\nOn February 16, 2005, [[Kids' WB]]'s unveiling of its new fall schedule for the [[2005\u201306 United States network television schedule|2005\u20132006 television season]] was announced by [[The WB|The WB Television Network]], featuring its returning series ''[[Yu-Gi-Oh!

The show premiered on September 17, 2005, on Kids' WB's [[Saturday morning cartoon|Saturday morning]] lineup of its weekly fall schedule, alongside ''Loonatics Unleashed'' and ''Coconut Fred's Fruit Salad Island''. The episode pair \"Johnny to the Center of the Earth\" and \"Johnny X\" marked the series premiere.\n\nWhen the show first aired on Kids' WB (season 1 only), it performed very well in the Nielsen ratings. It ranked as the #1 broadcast program in Girl 2-11 (garnering 2.2/10), ranked as the #2 broadcast series in Kids 2-11 (gaining 2.3/11 in the process) and Girls 6-11 (2.4/11), and ultimately ranking #3 in Kids 6-11 (receiving 3.0/14). Its second season received a slightly higher number of viewers on average in the United States: 2.6 million viewers per 2nd-season episode. Its 3rd season's average number of viewers in the United States was 3.1 million viewers. Its 4th season got an average number of about 4.3 million viewers per episode in the United States. Its 5th premiere attracted over 4.7 million viewers in the United States.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timewarner.com/corp/newsroom/pr/0,20812,1111667,00.html|title=Looney Tunes-Inspired \"Loonatics Unleashed\" Remains #1 Broadcast Kids' Series Second Week in a Row Among All Key Demos|date=September 29, 2005|work=Time Warner|accessdate=2011-03-01}}</ref>\n\nThe series was developed for television by [[Aaron Simpson (producer)|Aaron Simpson]], with a brief, slightly longer pre-existing pilot short produced by Simpson as well, before the show was picked up as a full series by Kids' WB. Based on Episode 1A \"Johnny to the Center of the Earth\", the pilot episode was animated roughly in [[Adobe Flash]], but retaining the same plot, used the same color schemes as the aforementioned episode, and was recorded with an American voice cast (retaining [[James Arnold Taylor]] as the voice of Johnny Test) instead. The original production design (including character designs, prop designs and background designs) was created, provided and contributed by [[Matt Danner]] and Marc Perry,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aaaron.com/blog/?p=3|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707072406/http://aaaron.com/blog/?p=3|url-status=dead|title=Johnny Test Logo|archivedate=July 7, 2011}}</ref> and then later worked on by producer [[Chris Savino]] and art director Paul Stec. Fellows, the creator of the series who had interested the network in the series' premise, based the titular character on himself when he was a young boy; he based Johnny's twin sisters, Susan and Mary, on his own two sisters, also named Susan and Mary.<ref name=\"James Arnold Taylor - Johnny Test\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jamesarnoldtaylor.com/character_pages/johnny_test.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091031055714/http://jamesarnoldtaylor.com/character_pages/johnny_test.html|url-status=dead|title=James Arnold Taylor - Johnny Test|archivedate=October 31, 2009}}</ref> In the original pilot and early promotional material of the show, Dukey was referred to as \"Poochie\".\n\nJames Arnold Taylor said that he was not Fellows' original choice for the role of Johnny Test; he had previously voiced the lead character in the initial test pilot. After the show got picked up by Kids' WB! as a series, he was initially going to be replaced by a different voice actor, with a Canadian voice cast instead, but the studio had trouble finding Johnny's initial voice convincing for the first six episodes, so they gave Taylor back the role to redub his dialog for the rest of the first season, and managed to keep him on the cast for the rest of the series.<ref name=\"James Arnold Taylor - Johnny Test\"/> Aaron Simpson, who had developed the series and produced the pilot, was the creator and executive producer's first choice to serve as the producer of the show, before he turned it down.\n\n===Production===\nThe remainder of the first season was produced in-house by [[Warner Bros. Animation]], but since the show was a U.S./Canada co-production, some of the animation production work was outsourced to Canadian animation studios [[Studio B Productions]] and Top Draw Animation, as well as South Korean animation production company [[Digital eMation]], which also provided the original main title animation opening. Storyboarding of some of the episodes was done by [[Atomic Cartoons]].\n\nMany of the original writers, storyboarders, and art crew of the series' first production season were recycled,{{clarify|date=July 2019|reason=\"recycled\"?}} including familiar [[Cartoon Network Studios]] and [[Nickelodeon Animation Studio]] alumni, as well as some from WB Animation, [[Disney Television Animation|Walt Disney Television Animation]] and [[DIC Entertainment]], and even the [[comic book industry]], including [[Chris Savino]], Marc Perry, Paul Stec, Matt Danner, Joe Horne, [[Mike Kazaleh]], Brian Larsen, [[Jun Falkenstein]], [[Scott Shaw!]], Nora Johnson, [[Milton Knight]], Ray Leong,<ref>Johnny Test character clean-up model sheet by Ray Leong, at [https://www.flickr.com/photos/ray_leong/2314964234/|Johnny Test Characters|Flickr - Photo Sharing!]</ref> Chris Battle, Casey Mitchum,<ref>Johnny Test character clean-up model sheets by [[Casey Mitchum]], at his blog site [http://kasefase.blogspot.com/2008_09_01_archive.html Puppies and Paint: September 2008]</ref> Pat Ventura, [[John Derevlany]], J.C.

The first game, ''Johnny Test: Clone Zapper'', finds Johnny Test and Dukey engaged to combat an army of Johnny clones they accidentally created  from a clone machine, with the help of two special laser zapper guns as their only weapons to defeat the clones and destroy them personally, and the second game, ''Johnny Test: Bot Drop'', sees Johnny, Dukey and the Test twins going on a rescue chase, with Johnny and Dukey both piloting a bot drop plane to use the robot clones of Johnnies (first seen in ''[[List of Johnny Test episodes#101 Johnnies|101 Johnnies]]'') for the titular \"Bot Drops\" to eject them to safety in a moving rescue vehicle driven by Susan and Mary. In the plot of that latter aforementioned game, and like in each level of the game before it, Johnny has to aim and time to drop the robots so they will land safely onto the vehicle, then Johnny Test has saved the day once again.

In particular, fan essays were published on websites such as [[Mugglenet]] (the \"world famous editorials\"), the [[Harry Potter Lexicon]] and [[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]] (Scribbulus project) among others: offering theories, comment and analysis on all aspects of the series. The [[Yahoo]] discussion list [[Harry Potter for Grown Ups]] (founded in 1999) is also noteworthy for its detailed criticism and discussion of the Harry Potter books.\n\nSpeculation intensified with the July 2005 publication of ''[[Half-Blood Prince]]'' and the detailed post-publication interview given by Rowling to Mugglenet and The Leaky Cauldron.<ref>{{cite web|author=MuggleNet |url=http://www.mugglenet.com/jkrinterview.shtml |title=Emerson and Melissa's J.K.

Late additions to the fan scene (prior to the publication of ''[[Deathly Hallows]]'') included BeyondHogwarts.com (the successor to DumbledoreIsNotDead.com), which billed itself as \"the only ongoing online Harry Potter fan conference\", as well as Book7.co.uk, which offered a hypothetical \"evidence-based synopsis\" of the seventh novel.

These are after-hours events for convention attendees who purchased tickets to experience and explore the park by themselves. The event included talks given by creators of the park, free food and [[butterbeer]], and live wizard rock shows inside the park.\n\n==Festivals==\nIn addition to conventions, Harry Potter fandom has further expanded to town festivals, including the Chestertown Harry Potter Festival (Maryland),<ref>{{cite web|title=Chestertown Harry Potter Festival |url=http://chestertownhpfest.org/|accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref> the Chestnut Hill Harry Potter Festival (Philadelphia),<ref>{{cite web|title=Chestnut HIll Harry Potter Festival|url=http://chestnuthillpa.com/events/harry-potter-festival-2016/|accessdate=15 July 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160912173458/http://chestnuthillpa.com/events/harry-potter-festival-2016/|archivedate=12 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  Edgerton's Harry Potter Festival (Wisconsin),<ref>{{cite web|title=Edgerton's Harry Potter Festival|url=http://www.harrypotterfestival.com/|accessdate=15 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160712122715/http://www.harrypotterfestival.com/|archive-date=12 July 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and the Spellbound Festival (Michigan, 2016; Ontario, 2018; New York, 2019),<ref>{{cite web|title=Spellbound Festival |url=http://stbonavenue.com/spellbound-festival/|accessdate=15 July 2016}}</ref> among others.\n\n==Religions==\nThe Harry Potter fandom has also led to the development of at least one religion. The religion of 'Snapeism' was active from 2005-2011. The Snapists (popularly known as the Snapewives) worshipped the Severus Snape character.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alderton|first1=Zoe|title='Snapewives' and 'Snapeism': A Fiction-Based Religion within the Harry Potter Fandom|journal=Religions|date=3 March 2014|volume=5|issue=1|pages=219\u2013267|doi=10.3390/rel5010219|doi-access=free}}</ref> The Snapists were mocked by the majority of the fandom, especially the JournalFen community 'fandom_wank', for their unorthodox belief systems. Nevertheless, recent scholarship has argued for the validity of fandom faiths.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Davidsen|first1=Markus A.|title=Fiction-Based Religion: Conceptualising a New Category Against History-Based Religion and Fandom|journal=Culture and Religion|volume=14|issue=4|pages=378\u2013395|doi=10.1080/14755610.2013.838798|year=2013|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/48123/Davidsen2013ConceptualisingFiction-basedReligion_Postprint.pdf?sequence=1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Cusack|first1=Carole|title=Invented Religions: Imagination, Fiction and Faith|date=2010|publisher=Ashgate|location=Farnham}}</ref>\n\nThe Snapists exist within a context of 'canon scepticism' - the belief that Rowling is a flawed interpreter of the Harry Potter universe who misrepresents the objective reality of certain characters and plot developments.<ref name=\"Alderton Snapewives\">{{cite journal|last1=Alderton|first1=Zoe|title='Snapewives' and 'Snapeism': A Fiction-Based Religion within the Harry Potter Fandom|journal=Religions|date=3 March 2014|volume=5|issue=1|page=224|doi=10.3390/rel5010219|doi-access=free}}</ref> The Snapists believe that Rowling has misinterpreted Snape and disrespected him as a character. They also feel that Snape can contact them and provide them with help and guidance in life.\n\n==\"Ship debates\"==\n{{further|Shipping (fandom)#Harry Potter fandom}}\nIn the fandom the word \"ship\" and its derivatives like \"shipping\" or \"shipper\" are commonly used as shorthand for the word \"relationship.\"\n\nThe ''Harry Potter'' series generated ship debates with supporters of the prospective relationship between [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and his close female friend [[Hermione Granger]] at odds with supporters of Hermione ending up instead with [[Ron Weasley]], close friend of both, as well as  supporters of Harry ending up with [[Ginny Weasley]], Ron's younger sister.\n\nQuotes from Rowling which seemed to contradict the possibility of Harry ending up with Hermione were usually countered by claiming them to be deliberate obfuscations designed to lure astute observation off-course (though such claims were far from undisputed, given that these allegedly vague quotes included such phrases as \"[Harry and Hermione] are very platonic friends\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-pressclubtransc.htm |title=1999: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K. Rowling interviews on the web |publisher=Accio-quote.org |date=20 October 1999 |accessdate=16 June 2012}}</ref> and were repeated on at least three different occasions).\n\nAn interview with J.K. Rowling conducted by fansite webmasters Emerson Spartz ([[MuggleNet]]) and Melissa Anelli ([[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]]) shortly after the book's release turned out to be quite controversial. During the interview Spartz commented that Harry/Hermione shippers were \"delusional\", to which Rowling chuckled, though making it clear that she did not share the sentiment and that the Harry/Hermione fans were \"still valued members of her readership\". This incident resulted in an uproar among Harry/Hermione shippers. The uproar was loud enough to merit an article in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/08/03/DDG0RE1DDI1.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Neva | last=Chonin | title=If you're an obsessed Harry Potter fan, Voldemort isn't the problem. It's Hermione versus Ginny | date=24 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nRowling's attitude towards the shipping phenomenon has varied between amused and bewildered to frustrated, as she revealed in that interview. She explained:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-2.htm |title=2005: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K.

A long time. Occasionally I had to, because there were weird news stories or something that I would have to go and check, because I was supposed to have said something I hadn\u2019t said. I had never gone and looked at fan sites, and then one day I did and oh&nbsp;\u2014 my&nbsp;\u2014 god. Five hours later or something, I get up from the computer shaking slightly [all laugh]. 'What is going on?\u2019 And it was during that first mammoth session that I met the shippers, and it was a most extraordinary thing. I had no idea there was this huge underworld seething beneath me.}}\n\nIn a later posting on MuggleNet, Spartz explained:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mugglenet.com/newsfusion/fullnews.php?id=972 |title=THE INTERVIEW!

You were delusional; you saw what you wanted to see and you have no one to blame for that but yourselves.}}\n\nRowling has continued to make references, less humorous and more, to the severity of the shipper conflicts. In one instance she has joked about trying to think of ways of proving to Emerson, when inviting him for the aforementioned interview, that it was really her and not \"some angry Harry/Hermione shipper trying to lure him down a dark alleyway\";<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jkrowling.com/textonly/en/extrastuff_view.cfm?id=21 |title=Meeting Melissa and Emerson |website=[[J.

She went on to say that perhaps with marriage counseling Ron and Hermione would have been all right.<ref>West, Kelly.

There are two primary forms: internet-based roleplay and live-action roleplay, or [[LARP]].\n\nLARPing often involves re-enacting or creating an original Quidditch team. Match rules and style of play vary among fandom events, but they are generally kept as close as possible to the sport envisioned by Rowling.

Hogwarts-school.net (est. 2000), for example, is a forum-based roleplaying game which allows players to take classes, engage in extracurriculars, and also has many options for adult characters in St. Mungos, the Daily Prophet, and the Ministry of Magic.\n\n2007 saw the launch of World of Hogwarts,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldofhogwarts.org/intro.htm |title=Introduction |publisher=The World of Hogwarts |accessdate=16 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623195942/http://www.worldofhogwarts.org/intro.htm |archivedate=23 June 2012 }}</ref> a completely free [[MMORPG]] [[Harry Potter]] roleplaying game in [[Second Life]], set ten years after the Battle of [[Hogwarts]]. Here, roleplayers can create an avatar and interact with other students, attend lessons organized by other roleplayers, play [[Quidditch]], sit for their exams, earn and lose points for their house, visit [[Hogsmeade]], [[Diagon Alley]] and the Forbidden Forest, get a job at the [[Ministry of Magic]], explore several secret passages within the castle, and even immerse themselves into intricate and well-composed storyline plots that have, through time, grown into the canon rules of the game.\n\nA website created by ISO Interactive, called the Chamber of Chat is a free online interactive virtual world under a [[Massively multiplayer online game|MMO]] format. Although not a full [[MMORPG]] format, Chamber of Chat is set up with 3D virtual chatrooms and avatars where fans can socially interact with each other in [[Pictionary]] and Harry Potter [[Trivia]]l games or participate in discussion groups about Harry Potter or Film media or perform plays as a theater group to other fans as audience. They hold special community event such as Harry Potters Birthday or Halloween and have seasonal house competitions.  Fans are able to create their own avatars, collect or be rewarded coins to purchase furniture items for their own \"clubhouse\". However, the website emphasizes more social interaction between fans' avatars to stimulate the Hogwarts student experience. \"Chamber of Chat is a graphical Social Virtual World with a few [[Facebook]] plug-ins. The Harry Potter Virtual World is designed for fans. This give users the feeling that they are interacting in the actual 3D world.

Interactive gaming can include [[player versus player]] features, a form of currency for making purchases in stores, and [[non-player characters]] such as monsters that must be fought to gain levels and experience points. However, these features are more prevalent in games that are not forum-based. Advancement in such games is usually dependent on live chat, multiplayer cooperation, and fighting as opposed to taking classes or simply posting to earn points for one's \"house\"; like at Hogwarts, players in forum-based games are sometimes sorted into a different group distinguishing different values within a person.\n\nRoleplaying also occurs in [[Improv comedy|long-form improvisational]] theater. Several American and British improv troupes are devoted to the Potter genre.

To this end, clues from the earlier books and deliberate hints from [[J. K. Rowling]] (in interviews and on her website) were heavily scrutinised by fans. In particular, fan essays were published on websites such as [[Mugglenet]] (the \"world famous editorials\"), the [[Harry Potter Lexicon]] and [[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]] (Scribbulus project) among others: offering theories, comment and analysis on all aspects of the series. The [[Yahoo]] discussion list [[Harry Potter for Grown Ups]] (founded in 1999) is also noteworthy for its detailed criticism and discussion of the Harry Potter books.\n\nSpeculation intensified with the July 2005 publication of ''[[Half-Blood Prince]]'' and the detailed post-publication interview given by Rowling to Mugglenet and The Leaky Cauldron.<ref>{{cite web|author=MuggleNet |url=http://www.mugglenet.com/jkrinterview.shtml |title=Emerson and Melissa's J.K.

Late additions to the fan scene (prior to the publication of ''[[Deathly Hallows]]'') included BeyondHogwarts.com (the successor to DumbledoreIsNotDead.com), which billed itself as \"the only ongoing online Harry Potter fan conference\", as well as Book7.co.uk, which offered a hypothetical \"evidence-based synopsis\" of the seventh novel.

The religion of 'Snapeism' was active from 2005-2011. The Snapists (popularly known as the Snapewives) worshipped the Severus Snape character.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alderton|first1=Zoe|title='Snapewives' and 'Snapeism': A Fiction-Based Religion within the Harry Potter Fandom|journal=Religions|date=3 March 2014|volume=5|issue=1|pages=219\u2013267|doi=10.3390/rel5010219|doi-access=free}}</ref> The Snapists were mocked by the majority of the fandom, especially the JournalFen community 'fandom_wank', for their unorthodox belief systems.

They also feel that Snape can contact them and provide them with help and guidance in life.\n\n==\"Ship debates\"==\n{{further|Shipping (fandom)#Harry Potter fandom}}\nIn the fandom the word \"ship\" and its derivatives like \"shipping\" or \"shipper\" are commonly used as shorthand for the word \"relationship.\"\n\nThe ''Harry Potter'' series generated ship debates with supporters of the prospective relationship between [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]] and his close female friend [[Hermione Granger]] at odds with supporters of Hermione ending up instead with [[Ron Weasley]], close friend of both, as well as  supporters of Harry ending up with [[Ginny Weasley]], Ron's younger sister.\n\nQuotes from Rowling which seemed to contradict the possibility of Harry ending up with Hermione were usually countered by claiming them to be deliberate obfuscations designed to lure astute observation off-course (though such claims were far from undisputed, given that these allegedly vague quotes included such phrases as \"[Harry and Hermione] are very platonic friends\",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/1999/1099-pressclubtransc.htm |title=1999: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K.

Rowling conducted by fansite webmasters Emerson Spartz ([[MuggleNet]]) and Melissa Anelli ([[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]]) shortly after the book's release turned out to be quite controversial. During the interview Spartz commented that Harry/Hermione shippers were \"delusional\", to which Rowling chuckled, though making it clear that she did not share the sentiment and that the Harry/Hermione fans were \"still valued members of her readership\". This incident resulted in an uproar among Harry/Hermione shippers. The uproar was loud enough to merit an article in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/08/03/DDG0RE1DDI1.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Neva | last=Chonin | title=If you're an obsessed Harry Potter fan, Voldemort isn't the problem. It's Hermione versus Ginny | date=24 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nRowling's attitude towards the shipping phenomenon has varied between amused and bewildered to frustrated, as she revealed in that interview. She explained:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accio-quote.org/articles/2005/0705-tlc_mugglenet-anelli-2.htm |title=2005: Accio Quote!, the largest archive of J.K.

There are two primary forms: internet-based roleplay and live-action roleplay, or [[LARP]].\n\nLARPing often involves re-enacting or creating an original Quidditch team.

Although not a full [[MMORPG]] format, Chamber of Chat is set up with 3D virtual chatrooms and avatars where fans can socially interact with each other in [[Pictionary]] and Harry Potter [[Trivia]]l games or participate in discussion groups about Harry Potter or Film media or perform plays as a theater group to other fans as audience. They hold special community event such as Harry Potters Birthday or Halloween and have seasonal house competitions.  Fans are able to create their own avatars, collect or be rewarded coins to purchase furniture items for their own \"clubhouse\". However, the website emphasizes more social interaction between fans' avatars to stimulate the Hogwarts student experience. \"Chamber of Chat is a graphical Social Virtual World with a few [[Facebook]] plug-ins.

Interactive gaming can include [[player versus player]] features, a form of currency for making purchases in stores, and [[non-player characters]] such as monsters that must be fought to gain levels and experience points. However, these features are more prevalent in games that are not forum-based. Advancement in such games is usually dependent on live chat, multiplayer cooperation, and fighting as opposed to taking classes or simply posting to earn points for one's \"house\"; like at Hogwarts, players in forum-based games are sometimes sorted into a different group distinguishing different values within a person.\n\nRoleplaying also occurs in [[Improv comedy|long-form improvisational]] theater. Several American and British improv troupes are devoted to the Potter genre. These include Melbourne's ''[https://www.improvisedpotter.com.au/ Completely Improvised Potter] London's [[Potted Potter]]'' and Los Angeles's ''[http://harrypotterimprov.com/ The Show That Shall Not Be Named].''\n\n==Iconic landmarks tours==\n[[Image:Glenfinnan Viaduct, Scotland.jpg|200px|right|thumb|The [[Glenfinnan viaduct]], which the [[Hogwarts Express]] passes over when it travels to Hogwarts in the films.]]\nSome travel agencies have organised a subdivision to create tours specifically highlighting iconic landmarks in the world of ''Harry Potter''.

The organization was responsible for a huge range of engineering projects both in Nazi Germany and in [[List of military occupations|occupied territories]] from [[France]] to the [[Soviet Union]] during [[World War II]]. It became notorious for using [[forced labour]]. From 1943 until 1945 during the late phase of the Third Reich, OT administered all constructions of concentration camps to supply forced labor to industry.\n\n==Overview==\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B01718, Ausstellung \"Planung und Aufbau im Osten\".jpg|300px|thumb|From left: [[Rudolf Hess]], [[Heinrich Himmler]], [[Philipp Bouhler]], [[Fritz Todt]] and [[Reinhard Heydrich]] listen to [[Konrad Meyer]] at a ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'' exhibition in Berlin, 20 March 1941.]]\nThe history of the organisation can be divided into three phases.\nFrom 1933 to 1938, before the organization  existed, [[Fritz Todt]]'s primary office was that of the General Inspector of German Roadways (''Generalinspektor f\u00fcr das deutsche Stra\u00dfenwesen'') and his primary responsibility, the construction of the ''[[Autobahn]]'' network. He was able to draw on \"conscripted\" (i.e. compulsory) labour, from within Germany, through the Reich Labour Service (''[[Reichsarbeitsdienst]]'', RAD).{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nThe second period lasted from 1938, when the Organisation Todt group proper was initiated, until February 1942, when Todt died in an airplane crash. After the [[invasion of Poland]], Todt was named the Minister for Armaments and Munitions during 1940 (''Reichminister f\u00fcr Bewaffnung und Munition''), and the projects of the OT group became almost exclusively military. The huge increase in the demand for labour created by the various military and paramilitary projects was satisfied by a series of expansions of the laws concerning compulsory service, which ultimately obligated all Germans to arbitrarily determined (i.e., effectively unlimited) compulsory labour for the state: ''Zwangsarbeit''.<ref>''Verordnung zur Sicherstellung des Kr\u00e4ftebedarfs f\u00fcr Aufgaben von besonderer staatspolitischer Bedeutung'' of October 15, 1938 (''Notdienstverordnung''), ''RGBl''. 1938 I, Nr. 170, S. 1441\u201343; ''Verordnung zur Sicherstellung des Kr\u00e4ftebedarfs f\u00fcr Aufgaben von besonderer staatspolitischer Bedeutung'' of February 13, 1939, ''RGBl''. 1939 I, Nr. 25, S. 206f.; ''Gesetz \u00fcber Sachleistungen f\u00fcr Reichsaufgaben (Reichsleistungsgesetz)'' of September 1, 1939, ''RGBl''. 1939 I, Nr. 166, S. 1645\u201354.

Approximately 1.4 million labourers were in the service of the Organisation. Overall, 1% were Germans rejected from military service and 1.5% were [[concentration camp]] prisoners; the rest were prisoners of war and forced labourers from occupied countries. All were effectively treated as slaves and existed in the complete and arbitrary service of the [[totalitarian]] state.

He made it a vastly more ambitious public project and the responsibility was given to Fritz Todt as the newly named Inspector General of German Roadways.<ref>[http://www.verfassungen.de/de/de33-45/autobahnen33.htm ''Gesetz \u00fcber die Errichtung eines Unternehmens Reichsautobahnen''] Verfassungen.de, n.d.{{in lang|de}}. Note that \"law\" is the literal translation of the German term, \"''Gesetz''\", used in the text of this and other laws of the period. Given, however, that by this date legislative power had already been transferred to the executive (i.e. Hitler), primarily by means of the \"authorization law\" of 23 March 1933 (''Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich''), this, and all other legislation of the Third Reich, was effectively a purely executive order, i.e. a decree (''Erlass'').</ref>\n\nBy 1934, Todt had succeeded in elevating his office to near cabinet rank. Todt was, however, also an extremely capable administrator, and by 1938 the organization had built more than {{convert|3000|km|abbr=on}} of roadway. The ''Autobahn'' project became one of the show pieces of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi]] regime. In that period, Todt had also put together the administrative part of what would become the Organisation Todt, properly speaking.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nInitially, the ''Autobahn'' project relied on the open labour market as a source of workers. Germany was at this time still recovering from the effects of the [[Great Depression]] and there was no shortage of available labour. As the economy recovered and the supply of labour became a more serious issue, the OT was able to draw on conscripted (i.e., compulsory) workers, from within Germany through the [[Reichsarbeitsdienst|Reich Labour Service (RAD)]] from 1935. As per the law of 26 June 1935, all male Germans between the ages of 18 and 25 were required to perform six months of state service.<ref>[http://www.documentarchiv.de/ns/1935/rad_ges.html ''Reichsarbeitsdienstgesetz''] {{in lang|de}}</ref> During this period, the work was compensated, at a rate slightly greater than that of unemployment assistance.

He was appointed by Hitler as plenipotentiary for labour for the second four-year plan, decreasing G\u00f6ring's role.

The construction of the Hunsr\u00fcck Highway forms the basis for the fifth chapter of Edgar Reitz' movie, ''Heimat'' (1984) and one of its main characters is a (fictional) engineer of the project.</ref> Correspondingly, Todt himself was named [[Hitler Cabinet|Reich Minister]] of Armaments and Munitions during 1940. During 1941 Todt and his organization were further charged with a project even larger, the construction of the [[Atlantic Wall]], to be built on the coasts of occupied France, the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]].  Included with this project were the fortification of the British [[Channel Islands]], which were occupied by Nazi Germany from 30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945. The only camps on British soil operated by the OT were in the Channel Islands; two of these OT camps were given to the management of the [[SS]] from March 1943 converting them into the [[Alderney camps|Alderney concentration camps]].{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nFritz Todt died in an airplane crash on 8 February 1942, soon after a meeting with Hitler in [[East Prussia]].

September 2015 (German)</ref> As a result, there has been some speculation that Todt's death was a [[Covert operation|covert]] assassination, but this has never been substantiated.\n\n==OT under Albert Speer, 1942\u201345==\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J16636, Nordeuropa, Eduard Dietl, Albert Speer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Eduard Dietl]] and [[Albert Speer]], at [[Rovaniemi Airport]] in Finland, during December 1943]]\n\nTodt was succeeded by [[Albert Speer]] as Minister of Armaments and Munitions, and ''[[de facto]]'' manager of the Organisation Todt. Despite Todt's death, the OT continued to exist as an engineering organisation and was given more assignments. At the beginning of 1943, in addition to its continuing work on the Atlantic Wall, the organization also undertook the construction of launch platforms in northern France for the [[V-1 flying bomb]]  and [[V-2 rocket]]. During the summer of that year, the German war efforts became increasingly defensive, and the organization was further directed to construct air-raid shelters, repair bombed buildings in German urban areas, and  construct underground refineries and armaments factories, also termed [[Project Riese]].\n\nDuring 1943, the organization was administratively incorporated into Albert Speer's Ministry of Armaments and War Production. Speer's concerns, in the context of an increasingly desperate Germany,                                                                                                                                       in which all production had been severely affected by materials and manpower shortages and by Allied bombing, ranged over almost the whole of the German war-time economy. Speer managed to increase production significantly, at the cost of a vastly increased reliance on compulsory labour. This applied as well to the labour force of the OT.\n\n==OT Contractors==\nThe OT was a co-operative effort of the German government and the German construction industry; the former supplied the manpower and the material, the latter supplied the technical know-how in the form of individual contractors ''(OT-Firmen)'' with their staff and equipment. Up to about 1942 the construction companies dominated the OT, but after Speer became its director, the governments control of the organization increased through standardized contracts and uniform pay scales. The volunteer contracts with the OT were later augmented with compulsory contracts, forcing construction companies to work for the OT. The construction company contracted became a self contained unit within the OT, composed of technical and administrative staff with the skill and equipment necessary to execute the construction tasks assigned to it. Smaller companies were hence combined to form an ''Arbeitsgemeinschaft''.<ref>''Handbook of Organisation Todt'' (1945). London: MIRS, vol. 1., # 54, 62.</ref> The organization of the OT contractors were standardized though instructions issued by ''Wirtschaftsgruppe Bauindustrie'', the German construction industry association. Among the OT contractors were also construction companies in occupied Europe. French, Danish, and Norwegian companies contracted with German companies as sub-contractors for OT building projects.<ref>''Handbook of Organisation Todt'' (1945). London: MIRS, vol. 1., # 55, 58.</ref>\n\nThere were several kind of contracts between OT and the OT contractors. The most important were:\n# Cost reimbursement contract, where the materiel and labor was supplied by the company. It allowed a commission of 4\u00bd% as the profit of the contractor.\n# Efficiency output contracts, where the materiel and labor was supplied by the OT. The profit was computed on the basis of the wages paid to the contractors own staff. This was the dominant type of contract from late 1942.<ref>''Handbook of Organisation Todt'' (1945). London: MIRS, vol. 1., # 63, 64.</ref>\n\n==Organization==\n===Central organization===\nDuring 1942 a centralized organization of the OT was created when Speer became ''Reichsminister''.

The role of the NSKK began in  1938, with the ''NSKK-Transportbrigade Todt'' in charge of motor transportation for the construction of the [[Siegfried Line]]. In 1939, ''NSKK-Transportbrigade Speer'' was organized and put in charge of the motor transportation for the air base constructions under [[Baustab Speer]] within the OT. Foreign drivers were, however, recruited into the [[Legion Speer]], since they \u2013 as aliens \u2013 could not be members of the NSKK, which was a sub-organization of the Nazi Party. In 1942, Transportbrigade Todt, Transportbrigade Speer, and Legion Speer, was subsumed into an umbrella organization, ''Transportgruppe Todt'', which in 1944 was made into an organization independent of the NSKK, the [[Transportkorps Speer]].

From the beginning of 1942 at the latest, their place was increasingly taken by prisoners of war and compulsory labourers from occupied countries. Foreign nationals and POWs were often, somewhat euphemistically, referred to as \"foreign workers\" (''Fremdarbeiter''). During 1943 and 1944, these were further augmented by concentration camp and other prisoners. Beginning in the autumn of 1944, between 10,000 and 20,000 half-Jews (''[[Mischling]]e'') and persons related to Jews by marriage were recruited into special units.<ref>Gruner, Wolf (2006).

Of these, only the German personnel were regarded as being Wehrmacht Auxiliaries (i.e. belonging to the ''Wehrmachtgefolgschaft''). The ''Frontarbeiter'' (front workers) were German, [[Volksdeutsche]], or [[Nordic race|Nordic]] members of the OT. They swore an oath of fidelity to Hitler, wore uniforms, and were armed. The mean age of this group was about 45-50 years. An ''Einssatzarbeiter'' was a foreign worker that swore an oath of allegiance, wore a uniform, but were not normally armed. They could not include Czechs, Poles, Jews, or Communists. At the end of the war, their designation became ''OT-Legion\u00e4re.'' ''OT-Eigenes Personal'' was the organic personnel of the OT, as opposed to the ''OT-Firmenangeh\u00f6rige,'' employees of the contractors working for the OT. <ref>''Handbook of Organisation Todt'' (1945). London: MIRS, vol. 1., # 115, 129.</ref>\n\nAt wars end, all Org Todt members received blanket amnesty from the Western Allies. Many went on to serve in the post-war British and U.S. Labor Services in occupied Germany before emigrating to Britain, Australia, Canada and the United States. The U.S. Labor Service was considered the forerunner of the new German army. The Organization Todt itself was found not guilty of war crimes at Nuremberg, although its leader Albert Speer served 20 years in Spandau Prison after admitting his crimes against humanity.\n\n; Categories\n#''OT-Eigenes Personal'' consisted of administrative, supervisory, and clerical staff, recruited through voluntary employment of German citizens, or through conscription of Germans and Volksdeutsche, as well as French citizens working for OT in France, and also included ''Frontarbeiter'' and ''Einsatzarbeiter.'' \n#''OT-Firmenangeh\u00f6rige'' consisted of the German permanent employees of the contractors. as well as conscripts serving with the contracted companies. These employees received uniforms, were given a rank, and were supposed to be given a briefer period of military training.

He made it a vastly more ambitious public project and the responsibility was given to Fritz Todt as the newly named Inspector General of German Roadways.<ref>[http://www.verfassungen.de/de/de33-45/autobahnen33.htm ''Gesetz \u00fcber die Errichtung eines Unternehmens Reichsautobahnen''] Verfassungen.de, n.d.{{in lang|de}}.

Given, however, that by this date legislative power had already been transferred to the executive (i.e. Hitler), primarily by means of the \"authorization law\" of 23 March 1933 (''Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich''), this, and all other legislation of the Third Reich, was effectively a purely executive order, i.e. a decree (''Erlass'').</ref>\n\nBy 1934, Todt had succeeded in elevating his office to near cabinet rank. Todt was, however, also an extremely capable administrator, and by 1938 the organization had built more than {{convert|3000|km|abbr=on}} of roadway. The ''Autobahn'' project became one of the show pieces of the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi]] regime. In that period, Todt had also put together the administrative part of what would become the Organisation Todt, properly speaking.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\nInitially, the ''Autobahn'' project relied on the open labour market as a source of workers. Germany was at this time still recovering from the effects of the [[Great Depression]] and there was no shortage of available labour. As the economy recovered and the supply of labour became a more serious issue, the OT was able to draw on conscripted (i.e., compulsory) workers, from within Germany through the [[Reichsarbeitsdienst|Reich Labour Service (RAD)]] from 1935. As per the law of 26 June 1935, all male Germans between the ages of 18 and 25 were required to perform six months of state service.<ref>[http://www.documentarchiv.de/ns/1935/rad_ges.html ''Reichsarbeitsdienstgesetz''] {{in lang|de}}</ref> During this period, the work was compensated, at a rate slightly greater than that of unemployment assistance.

Included with this project were the fortification of the British [[Channel Islands]], which were occupied by Nazi Germany from 30 June 1940 to 9 May 1945.

September 2015 (German)</ref> As a result, there has been some speculation that Todt's death was a [[Covert operation|covert]] assassination, but this has never been substantiated.\n\n==OT under Albert Speer, 1942\u201345==\n[[Image:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-J16636, Nordeuropa, Eduard Dietl, Albert Speer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Eduard Dietl]] and [[Albert Speer]], at [[Rovaniemi Airport]] in Finland, during December 1943]]\n\nTodt was succeeded by [[Albert Speer]] as Minister of Armaments and Munitions, and ''[[de facto]]'' manager of the Organisation Todt. Despite Todt's death, the OT continued to exist as an engineering organisation and was given more assignments. At the beginning of 1943, in addition to its continuing work on the Atlantic Wall, the organization also undertook the construction of launch platforms in northern France for the [[V-1 flying bomb]]  and [[V-2 rocket]]. During the summer of that year, the German war efforts became increasingly defensive, and the organization was further directed to construct air-raid shelters, repair bombed buildings in German urban areas, and  construct underground refineries and armaments factories, also termed [[Project Riese]].\n\nDuring 1943, the organization was administratively incorporated into Albert Speer's Ministry of Armaments and War Production. Speer's concerns, in the context of an increasingly desperate Germany,                                                                                                                                       in which all production had been severely affected by materials and manpower shortages and by Allied bombing, ranged over almost the whole of the German war-time economy. Speer managed to increase production significantly, at the cost of a vastly increased reliance on compulsory labour. This applied as well to the labour force of the OT.\n\n==OT Contractors==\nThe OT was a co-operative effort of the German government and the German construction industry; the former supplied the manpower and the material, the latter supplied the technical know-how in the form of individual contractors ''(OT-Firmen)'' with their staff and equipment. Up to about 1942 the construction companies dominated the OT, but after Speer became its director, the governments control of the organization increased through standardized contracts and uniform pay scales. The volunteer contracts with the OT were later augmented with compulsory contracts, forcing construction companies to work for the OT. The construction company contracted became a self contained unit within the OT, composed of technical and administrative staff with the skill and equipment necessary to execute the construction tasks assigned to it. Smaller companies were hence combined to form an ''Arbeitsgemeinschaft''.<ref>''Handbook of Organisation Todt'' (1945). London: MIRS, vol. 1., # 54, 62.</ref> The organization of the OT contractors were standardized though instructions issued by ''Wirtschaftsgruppe Bauindustrie'', the German construction industry association. Among the OT contractors were also construction companies in occupied Europe. French, Danish, and Norwegian companies contracted with German companies as sub-contractors for OT building projects.<ref>''Handbook of Organisation Todt'' (1945). London: MIRS, vol. 1., # 55, 58.</ref>\n\nThere were several kind of contracts between OT and the OT contractors. The most important were:\n# Cost reimbursement contract, where the materiel and labor was supplied by the company. It allowed a commission of 4\u00bd% as the profit of the contractor.\n# Efficiency output contracts, where the materiel and labor was supplied by the OT. The profit was computed on the basis of the wages paid to the contractors own staff. This was the dominant type of contract from late 1942.<ref>''Handbook of Organisation Todt'' (1945).

It is an evolution of the [[Soyuz TMA-M]] spacecraft, with modernization mostly concentrated on the communications and navigation subsystems.\n\nIt is used by the [[Roscosmos]] for [[human spaceflight]]. Soyuz-MS has minimal external changes with respect to the [[Soyuz TMA-M]], mostly limited to antennas and sensors, as well as the thruster placement.<ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 />\n\nThe first launch was [[Soyuz MS-01]] on July 7, 2016 aboard a [[Soyuz-FG]] [[launch vehicle]] towards the [[International Space Station|ISS]].<ref name=tass-enscience886832 /> The trip included a two-day checkout phase for the design before docking with the ISS on July 9.<ref name=rsw-soyuzms01 />\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Soyuz rocket and spaceship V1-1.svg|alt=Exploded plan of the Soyuz MS spacecraft and its Soyuz FG rocket|thumb|Exploded plan of the Soyuz MS spacecraft and its Soyuz FG rocket]]\nA Soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts (from front to back):\n\n* A [[spheroid]] [[orbital module]]\n* A small aerodynamic [[reentry capsule|reentry module]]\n* A cylindrical [[service module]] with solar panels attached\n\nThe first two portions are habitable living space. By moving as much as possible into the orbital module, which does not have to be shielded or decelerated during [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] re-entry, the Soyuz three-part craft is both larger and lighter than the two-part [[Apollo spacecraft]]'s [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command module]]. The Apollo command module had six cubic meters of living space and a mass of 5000&nbsp;kg; the three-part Soyuz provided the same crew with nine cubic meters of living space, an airlock, and a service module for the mass of the Apollo capsule alone. This does not take into consideration the orbital module that could be used in place of the LEM in Apollo.\n\nSoyuz can carry up to three [[astronaut|cosmonauts]] and provide life support for them for about 30 person-days. The life support system provides a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere at sea level partial pressures. The atmosphere is regenerated through [[KO2|KO<sub>2</sub>]] cylinders, which absorb most of the [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] and [[water]] produced by the crew and regenerates the oxygen, and [[LiOH]] cylinders which absorb leftover CO<sub>2</sub>.\n\nThe vehicle is protected during launch by a nose fairing, which is jettisoned after passing through the atmosphere. It has an automatic docking system. The ship can be operated automatically, or by a pilot independently of ground control.\n\n=== Orbital Module (BO) ===\n\n[[File:Soyuz-TMA orbital module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Orbital Module]]\n\nThe forepart of the spacecraft is the orbital module ({{in lang|ru}}: \u0431\u044b\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u0411\u041e), ''Bitovoy otsek (BO)'') also known as the Habitation section. It houses all the equipment that will not be needed for reentry, such as experiments, cameras or cargo. Commonly, it is used as both eating area and lavatory. At its far end, it also contains the docking port. This module also contains a toilet, docking avionics and communications gear. On the latest Soyuz versions, a small window was introduced, providing the crew with a forward view.\n\nA hatch between it and the descent module can be closed so as to isolate it to act as an airlock if needed with cosmonauts exiting through its side port (at the bottom of this picture, near the descent module). On the launch pad, cosmonauts enter the spacecraft through this port.\n\nThis separation also lets the orbital module be customized to the mission with less risk to the life-critical descent module. The convention of orientation in zero gravity differs from that of the descent module, as cosmonauts stand or sit with their heads to the docking port.\n\n=== Reentry Module (SA) ===\n\n[[File:Soyuz-TMA descent module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Descent Module]]\nThe reentry module ({{in lang|ru}}: \u0441\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u043f\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442 (\u0421\u0410), ''Spuskaemiy apparat (SA)'') is used for launch and the journey back to Earth. It is covered by a heat-resistant covering to protect it during [[re-entry]]. It is slowed initially by the atmosphere, then by a braking parachute, followed by the main parachute which slows the craft for landing. At one meter above the ground, solid-fuel braking engines mounted behind the [[heat shield]] are fired to give a soft landing. One of the design requirements for the reentry module was for it to have the highest possible volumetric efficiency (internal volume divided by hull area). The best shape for this is a sphere, but such a shape can provide no lift, which results in a purely [[ballistic reentry]]. Ballistic reentries are hard on the occupants due to high deceleration and can't be steered beyond their initial deorbit burn. That is why it was decided to go with the \"headlight\" shape that the Soyuz uses&nbsp;\u2014 a hemispherical forward area joined by a barely angled conical section (seven degrees) to a classic spherical section heat shield. This shape allows a small amount of lift to be generated due to the unequal weight distribution. The nickname was coined at a time when [[Sealed beam|nearly every automobile headlight]] was a circular paraboloid.\n\n=== Service Module (PAO) ===\n\n[[File:Soyuz-TMA propulsion module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Instrumentation/Propulsion Module]]\nAt the back of the vehicle is the service module ({{in lang|ru}}: \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e-\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u041f\u0410\u041e), ''Priborno-Agregatniy Otsek (PAO)''). It has an instrumentation compartment ({{in lang|ru}}: \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u041f\u041e), ''Priborniy Otsek (PO)''), a pressurized container shaped like a bulging can that contains systems for temperature control, electric power supply, long-range [[radio]] communications, radio telemetry, and instruments for orientation and control. The propulsion compartment ({{in lang|ru}}: \u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u0410\u041e), ''Agregatniy Otsek (AO)''), a non-pressurized part of the service module, contains the main engine and a spare: liquid-fuel [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion systems]] for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to Earth. The ship also has a system of low-thrust engines for orientation, attached to the intermediate compartment ({{in lang|ru}}: \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u041f\u0445\u041e), ''Perekhodnoi Otsek (PkhO)''). Outside the service module are the sensors for the orientation system and the solar array, which is oriented towards the sun by rotating the ship.\n\n=== Re-entry procedure ===\n\nBecause its modular construction differs from that of previous designs, the Soyuz has an unusual sequence of events prior to re-entry. The spacecraft is turned engine-forward and the main engine is fired for de-orbiting fully 180\u00b0 ahead of its planned landing site. This requires the least propellant for re-entry, the spacecraft traveling on an elliptical [[Hohmann orbit]] to a point where it will be low enough in the atmosphere to re-enter.\n\nEarly Soyuz spacecraft would then have the service and orbital modules detach simultaneously. As they are connected by tubing and electrical cables to the descent module, this would aid in their separation and avoid having the descent module alter its orientation. Later Soyuz spacecraft detach the orbital module before firing the main engine, which saves even more propellant, enabling the descent module to return more payload. In no case can the orbital module remain in orbit as an addition to a space station, for the hatch enabling it to function as an airlock is part of the descent module.\n\nRe-entry firing is typically done on the \"dawn\" side of the Earth, so that the spacecraft can be seen by recovery helicopters as it descends in the evening twilight, illuminated by the sun when it is above the shadow of the Earth. Since the beginning of Soyuz missions to the ISS, only five have performed nighttime landings.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://spaceflight101.com/iss-expedition-45/soyuz-trio-set-for-rare-nighttime-landing-on-friday/ |title= Soyuz Trio set for rare Nighttime Landing on Friday}}</ref>\n\n== Soyuz MS Improvements ==\n\nThe Soyuz MS received the following upgrades with respect to the [[Soyuz TMA-M]]:<ref name=nsfforum-26410.992797 />\n* The fixed solar panels of the '''SEP''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|C\u042d\u041f, \u0421\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u042d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f}}) power supply system have had their [[photovoltaic]] cell efficiency improved to 14% (from 12%) and collective area increased by {{convert|1.1|m2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmssep />\n* A fifth battery with 155 [[amp-hour]] capacity known as '''906V''' was added to support the increased energy consumption from the improved electronics.\n* Additional micro-meteoroid protective layer was added to the BO orbital module.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmssep />\n* The new computer ('''TsVM-101'''), weighs one-eighth that of its predecessor (8.3&nbsp;kg vs. 70&nbsp;kg) while also being much smaller than the previous '''Argon-16''' computer.<ref name=nsf-20160706 />\n* While {{as of|2016|7|lc=on}} it is not known whether the propulsion system is still called [[KTDU-80]], it has been significantly modified. While previously the system had 16 high thrust DPO-B and six low thrust DPO-M in one propellant supply circuit, and six other low thrust DPO-M on a different circuit, now all 28 thrusters are high thrust DPO-B, arranged in 14 pairs. Each propellant supply circuit handles 14 DPO-B, with each element of each thruster pair being fed by a different circuit. This provides full fault tolerance for thruster or propellant circuit failure.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmskdu /><ref name=nasajsc-ytvsdklArMnCU /> The new arrangement adds fault tolerance for docking and undocking with one failed thruster or de-orbit with two failed thrusters.<ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 /> Also, the number of DPO-B in the aft section has been doubled to eight, improving the de-orbit fault tolerance.\n* The propellant consumption signal, '''EFIR''' was redesigned to avoid false positives on propellant consumption.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmskdu />\n* The avionics unit, '''BA

It is an evolution of the [[Soyuz TMA-M]] spacecraft, with modernization mostly concentrated on the communications and navigation subsystems.\n\nIt is used by the [[Roscosmos]] for [[human spaceflight]]. Soyuz-MS has minimal external changes with respect to the [[Soyuz TMA-M]], mostly limited to antennas and sensors, as well as the thruster placement.<ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 />\n\nThe first launch was [[Soyuz MS-01]] on July 7, 2016 aboard a [[Soyuz-FG]] [[launch vehicle]] towards the [[International Space Station|ISS]].<ref name=tass-enscience886832 /> The trip included a two-day checkout phase for the design before docking with the ISS on July 9.<ref name=rsw-soyuzms01 />\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Soyuz rocket and spaceship V1-1.svg|alt=Exploded plan of the Soyuz MS spacecraft and its Soyuz FG rocket|thumb|Exploded plan of the Soyuz MS spacecraft and its Soyuz FG rocket]]\nA Soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts (from front to back):\n\n* A [[spheroid]] [[orbital module]]\n* A small aerodynamic [[reentry capsule|reentry module]]\n* A cylindrical [[service module]] with solar panels attached\n\nThe first two portions are habitable living space. By moving as much as possible into the orbital module, which does not have to be shielded or decelerated during [[Earth's atmosphere|atmospheric]] re-entry, the Soyuz three-part craft is both larger and lighter than the two-part [[Apollo spacecraft]]'s [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command module]]. The Apollo command module had six cubic meters of living space and a mass of 5000&nbsp;kg; the three-part Soyuz provided the same crew with nine cubic meters of living space, an airlock, and a service module for the mass of the Apollo capsule alone. This does not take into consideration the orbital module that could be used in place of the LEM in Apollo.\n\nSoyuz can carry up to three [[astronaut|cosmonauts]] and provide life support for them for about 30 person-days. The life support system provides a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere at sea level partial pressures. The atmosphere is regenerated through [[KO2|KO<sub>2</sub>]] cylinders, which absorb most of the [[carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] and [[water]] produced by the crew and regenerates the oxygen, and [[LiOH]] cylinders which absorb leftover CO<sub>2</sub>.\n\nThe vehicle is protected during launch by a nose fairing, which is jettisoned after passing through the atmosphere. It has an automatic docking system. The ship can be operated automatically, or by a pilot independently of ground control.\n\n=== Orbital Module (BO) ===\n\n[[File:Soyuz-TMA orbital module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Orbital Module]]\n\nThe forepart of the spacecraft is the orbital module ({{in lang|ru}}: \u0431\u044b\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u0411\u041e), ''Bitovoy otsek (BO)'') also known as the Habitation section. It houses all the equipment that will not be needed for reentry, such as experiments, cameras or cargo. Commonly, it is used as both eating area and lavatory. At its far end, it also contains the docking port. This module also contains a toilet, docking avionics and communications gear. On the latest Soyuz versions, a small window was introduced, providing the crew with a forward view.\n\nA hatch between it and the descent module can be closed so as to isolate it to act as an airlock if needed with cosmonauts exiting through its side port (at the bottom of this picture, near the descent module). On the launch pad, cosmonauts enter the spacecraft through this port.\n\nThis separation also lets the orbital module be customized to the mission with less risk to the life-critical descent module. The convention of orientation in zero gravity differs from that of the descent module, as cosmonauts stand or sit with their heads to the docking port.\n\n=== Reentry Module (SA) ===\n\n[[File:Soyuz-TMA descent module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Descent Module]]\nThe reentry module ({{in lang|ru}}: \u0441\u043f\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0435\u043c\u044b\u0439 \u0430\u043f\u043f\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0442 (\u0421\u0410), ''Spuskaemiy apparat (SA)'') is used for launch and the journey back to Earth. It is covered by a heat-resistant covering to protect it during [[re-entry]]. It is slowed initially by the atmosphere, then by a braking parachute, followed by the main parachute which slows the craft for landing. At one meter above the ground, solid-fuel braking engines mounted behind the [[heat shield]] are fired to give a soft landing. One of the design requirements for the reentry module was for it to have the highest possible volumetric efficiency (internal volume divided by hull area). The best shape for this is a sphere, but such a shape can provide no lift, which results in a purely [[ballistic reentry]]. Ballistic reentries are hard on the occupants due to high deceleration and can't be steered beyond their initial deorbit burn. That is why it was decided to go with the \"headlight\" shape that the Soyuz uses&nbsp;\u2014 a hemispherical forward area joined by a barely angled conical section (seven degrees) to a classic spherical section heat shield. This shape allows a small amount of lift to be generated due to the unequal weight distribution. The nickname was coined at a time when [[Sealed beam|nearly every automobile headlight]] was a circular paraboloid.\n\n=== Service Module (PAO) ===\n\n[[File:Soyuz-TMA propulsion module.jpg|thumb|Soyuz spacecraft's Instrumentation/Propulsion Module]]\nAt the back of the vehicle is the service module ({{in lang|ru}}: \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e-\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u041f\u0410\u041e), ''Priborno-Agregatniy Otsek (PAO)''). It has an instrumentation compartment ({{in lang|ru}}: \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0431\u043e\u0440\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u041f\u041e), ''Priborniy Otsek (PO)''), a pressurized container shaped like a bulging can that contains systems for temperature control, electric power supply, long-range [[radio]] communications, radio telemetry, and instruments for orientation and control. The propulsion compartment ({{in lang|ru}}: \u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u0410\u041e), ''Agregatniy Otsek (AO)''), a non-pressurized part of the service module, contains the main engine and a spare: liquid-fuel [[spacecraft propulsion|propulsion systems]] for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to Earth. The ship also has a system of low-thrust engines for orientation, attached to the intermediate compartment ({{in lang|ru}}: \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0445\u043e\u0434\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043e\u0442\u0441\u0435\u043a (\u041f\u0445\u041e), ''Perekhodnoi Otsek (PkhO)''). Outside the service module are the sensors for the orientation system and the solar array, which is oriented towards the sun by rotating the ship.\n\n=== Re-entry procedure ===\n\nBecause its modular construction differs from that of previous designs, the Soyuz has an unusual sequence of events prior to re-entry. The spacecraft is turned engine-forward and the main engine is fired for de-orbiting fully 180\u00b0 ahead of its planned landing site. This requires the least propellant for re-entry, the spacecraft traveling on an elliptical [[Hohmann orbit]] to a point where it will be low enough in the atmosphere to re-enter.\n\nEarly Soyuz spacecraft would then have the service and orbital modules detach simultaneously. As they are connected by tubing and electrical cables to the descent module, this would aid in their separation and avoid having the descent module alter its orientation. Later Soyuz spacecraft detach the orbital module before firing the main engine, which saves even more propellant, enabling the descent module to return more payload. In no case can the orbital module remain in orbit as an addition to a space station, for the hatch enabling it to function as an airlock is part of the descent module.\n\nRe-entry firing is typically done on the \"dawn\" side of the Earth, so that the spacecraft can be seen by recovery helicopters as it descends in the evening twilight, illuminated by the sun when it is above the shadow of the Earth. Since the beginning of Soyuz missions to the ISS, only five have performed nighttime landings.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://spaceflight101.com/iss-expedition-45/soyuz-trio-set-for-rare-nighttime-landing-on-friday/ |title= Soyuz Trio set for rare Nighttime Landing on Friday}}</ref>\n\n== Soyuz MS Improvements ==\n\nThe Soyuz MS received the following upgrades with respect to the [[Soyuz TMA-M]]:<ref name=nsfforum-26410.992797 />\n* The fixed solar panels of the '''SEP''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: {{lang|ru|C\u042d\u041f, \u0421\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u042d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f}}) power supply system have had their [[photovoltaic]] cell efficiency improved to 14% (from 12%) and collective area increased by {{convert|1.1|m2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmssep />\n* A fifth battery with 155 [[amp-hour]] capacity known as '''906V''' was added to support the increased energy consumption from the improved electronics.\n* Additional micro-meteoroid protective layer was added to the BO orbital module.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmssep />\n* The new computer ('''TsVM-101'''), weighs one-eighth that of its predecessor (8.3&nbsp;kg vs. 70&nbsp;kg) while also being much smaller than the previous '''Argon-16''' computer.<ref name=nsf-20160706 />\n* While {{as of|2016|7|lc=on}} it is not known whether the propulsion system is still called [[KTDU-80]], it has been significantly modified. While previously the system had 16 high thrust DPO-B and six low thrust DPO-M in one propellant supply circuit, and six other low thrust DPO-M on a different circuit, now all 28 thrusters are high thrust DPO-B, arranged in 14 pairs. Each propellant supply circuit handles 14 DPO-B, with each element of each thruster pair being fed by a different circuit. This provides full fault tolerance for thruster or propellant circuit failure.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmskdu /><ref name=nasajsc-ytvsdklArMnCU /> The new arrangement adds fault tolerance for docking and undocking with one failed thruster or de-orbit with two failed thrusters.<ref name=popularmechanics-20160705 /> Also, the number of DPO-B in the aft section has been doubled to eight, improving the de-orbit fault tolerance.\n* The propellant consumption signal, '''EFIR''' was redesigned to avoid false positives on propellant consumption.<ref name=rsw-soyuzmskdu />\n* The avionics unit, '''BA

He was noted for his facility at [[word play]], logic, and fantasy. The poems ''[[Jabberwocky]]'' and ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'' are classified in the genre of [[literary nonsense]]. He was also a [[mathematician]], [[photographer]], and Anglican [[deacon]].\n\nCarroll came from a family of [[high-church]] [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], and developed a long relationship with [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he lived for most of his life as a scholar and teacher. [[Alice Liddell]], daughter of the Dean of Christ Church, [[Henry Liddell]], is widely identified as the original for ''Alice in Wonderland'', though Carroll always denied this.\n\nBorn in All Saints' Vicarage, [[Daresbury]], Cheshire, in 1832, Carroll is commemorated at [[All Saints' Church, Daresbury]], in its stained glass windows depicting characters from ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland''. In 1982, a memorial stone to Carroll was unveiled in [[Poets' Corner]], [[Westminster Abbey]].\n\n==Background and early life==\n[[File:CharlesDodgson.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photographic portrait of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), seated and holding a book|Lewis Carroll]]\nDodgson's family was predominantly [[Northern England|northern English]] (with [[Irish people|Irish]] connections), conservative and [[high-church]] [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]. Most of Dodgson's male ancestors were army officers or [[Church of England]] clergy.

This remained their home for the next 25 years.\n\nCharles's father was an active and highly conservative cleric of the [[Church of England]] who later became the [[Archdeacon of Richmond]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Dodgson.html|title=Charles Lutwidge Dodgson|work=The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref> and involved himself, sometimes influentially, in the intense religious disputes that were dividing the church. He was [[high church]], inclining toward [[Anglo-Catholicism]], an admirer of [[John Henry Newman]] and the [[Tractarian movement]], and did his best to instil such views in his children.

His \"reading lists\" preserved in the family archives testify to a precocious intellect: at the age of seven, he was reading books such as ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''. He also suffered from a [[Stuttering|stammer]] \u2013 a condition shared by most of his siblings<ref>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], p.&nbsp;4</ref> \u2013 that often inhibited his social life throughout his years. At the age of twelve he was sent to Richmond Grammar School (now part of [[Richmond School]]) in [[Richmond, North Yorkshire]].\n\n===Rugby===\nIn 1846, Dodgson entered [[Rugby School]] where he was evidently unhappy, as he wrote some years after leaving:\n{{quote|I cannot say ... that any earthly considerations would induce me to go through my three years again ... I can honestly say that if I could have been ... secure from annoyance at night, the hardships of the daily life would have been comparative trifles to bear.<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], pp. 30\u201331</ref>}}\nDodgson did not claim he suffered from bullying but cited little boys as the main targets of older bullies at Rugby.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Mystery of Lewis Carroll: Discovering the Whimsical, Thoughtful, and Sometimes Lonely Man Who Created \"Alice in Wonderland\"|last=Woolf|first=Jenny|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2010|isbn=9780312612986|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mysteryoflewisca0000wool/page/24 24]|url=https://archive.org/details/mysteryoflewisca0000wool/page/24}}</ref> Stuart Dodgson Collingwood, who was Dodgson's nephew, wrote that \"even though it is hard for those who have only known him as the gentle and retiring don to believe it, it is nevertheless true that long after he left school, his name was remembered as that of a boy who knew well how to use his fists in defence of a righteous cause\", which is the protection of the smaller boys.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nScholastically, though, he excelled with apparent ease. \"I have not had a more promising boy at his age since I came to Rugby\", observed mathematics master R.

He did not always work hard but was exceptionally gifted and achievement came easily to him.

Rejlander]]]]\nThe young adult Charles Dodgson was about {{convert|6|ft|2}} tall and slender, and he had curly brown hair and blue or grey eyes (depending on the account). He was described in later life as somewhat [[asymmetry|asymmetrical]], and as carrying himself rather stiffly and awkwardly, although this might be on account of a knee injury sustained in middle age. As a very young child, he suffered a fever that left him deaf in one ear. At the age of 17, he suffered a severe attack of [[Pertussis|whooping cough]], which was probably responsible for his chronically weak chest in later life. Another defect which he carried into adulthood was what he referred to as his \"hesitation\", a [[Stuttering|stammer]] that he acquired in early childhood and which plagued him throughout his life.<ref name = \"ekfvyz\"/>\n\nThe stammer has always been a significant part of the image of Dodgson. While one apocryphal story says that he stammered only in adult company and was free and fluent with children, there is no evidence to support this idea.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&nbsp;91</ref> Many children of his acquaintance remembered the stammer, while many adults failed to notice it. Dodgson himself seems to have been far more acutely aware of it than most people whom he met; it is said that he caricatured himself as the [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dodo]] in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', referring to his difficulty in pronouncing his last name, but this is one of the many \"facts\" often repeated for which no first-hand evidence remains. He did indeed refer to himself as the dodo, but whether or not this reference was to his stammer is simply speculation.<ref name = \"ekfvyz\"/>\n\nDodgson's stammer did trouble him, but it was never so debilitating that it prevented him from applying his other personal qualities to do well in society. He lived in a time when people commonly devised their own amusements and when singing and recitation were required social skills, and the young Dodgson was well equipped to be an engaging entertainer. He reportedly could sing tolerably well and was not afraid to do so before an audience. He was adept at mimicry and storytelling, and was reputedly quite good at [[charades]].<ref name=\"ekfvyz\"/>\n\n===Social connections===\nIn the interim between his early published writings and the success of the ''Alice'' books, Dodgson began to move in the [[pre-Raphaelite]] social circle. He first met [[John Ruskin]] in 1857 and became friendly with him. Around 1863,\u00a0 he developed a close relationship with [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and his family. He would often take pictures of the family in the garden of the Rossetti's house in Chelsea, London. He also knew [[William Holman Hunt]], [[John Everett Millais]], and [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], among other artists. He knew fairy-tale author [[George MacDonald]] well \u2013 it was the enthusiastic reception of ''Alice'' by the young MacDonald children that persuaded him to submit the work for publication.<ref name=\"ekfvyz\"/><ref name=\"snaogq\">[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 100\u20134</ref>\n\n===Politics, religion, and philosophy===\nIn broad terms, Dodgson has traditionally been regarded as politically, religiously, and personally conservative. [[Martin Gardner]] labels Dodgson as a [[Tory]] who was \"awed by lords and inclined to be snobbish towards inferiors.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to The annotated Alice: Alice's adventures in Wonderland & Through the looking glass|last=Gardner|first=Martin|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|year=2000|page=xv|isbn=0-517-02962-6}}</ref> [[William Tuckwell|The Reverend W. Tuckwell]], in his ''Reminiscences of Oxford'' (1900), regarded him as \"austere, shy, precise, absorbed in mathematical reverie, watchfully tenacious of his dignity, stiffly conservative in political, theological, social theory, his life mapped out in squares like Alice's landscape.\"<ref>{{cite book | title = Introduction to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass | last = Gardner | first = Martin | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2009 | page = xvi | isbn = 0-517-02962-6 }}</ref> Dodgson was ordained a deacon in the Church of England on 22 December 1861. In ''The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll'', the editor states that \"his Diary is full of such modest depreciations of himself and his work, interspersed with earnest prayers (too sacred and private to be reproduced here) that God would forgive him the past, and help him to perform His holy will in the future.\"<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]]</ref> When a friend asked him about his religious views, Dodgson wrote in response that he was a member of the Church of England, but \"doubt[ed] if he was fully a 'High Churchman'\". He added:\n{{Quote|I believe that when you and I come to lie down for the last time, if only we can keep firm hold of the great truths Christ taught us\u2014our own utter worthlessness and His infinite worth; and that He has brought us back to our one Father, and made us His brethren, and so brethren to one another\u2014we shall have all we need to guide us through the shadows. Most assuredly I accept to the full the doctrines you refer to\u2014that Christ died to save us, that we have no other way of salvation open to us but through His death, and that it is by faith in Him, and through no merit of ours, that we are reconciled to God; and most assuredly I can cordially say, \"I owe all to Him who loved me, and died on the Cross of Calvary.\"|Carroll (1897)<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], Chapter IX</ref>}}\n\nDodgson also expressed interest in other fields. He was an early member of the [[Society for Psychical Research]], and one of his letters suggests that he accepted as real what was then called \"thought reading\".<ref>{{cite book | title = The Society for Psychical Research, 1882\u20131982 A History | last = Hayness | first = Rene&#769;e | publisher = Macdonald & Co | place = London | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-356-07875-2 | pages = 13\u201314 }}</ref> Dodgson wrote some studies of various philosophical arguments. In 1895, he developed a philosophical regressus-argument on deductive reasoning in his article \"[[What the Tortoise Said to Achilles]]\", which appeared in one of the early volumes of ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/mind/IV.14.278| title = What the Tortoise Said to Achilles| journal = Mind| issue = 14| pages = 278| year = 1895| last1 = Carroll | first1 = L. }}</ref> The article was reprinted in the same journal a hundred years later in 1995, with a subsequent article by [[Simon Blackburn]] titled \"Practical Tortoise Raising\".<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/mind/104.416.695| title = Practical Tortoise Raising| journal = Mind| volume = 104| issue = 416| pages = 695| year = 1995| last1 = Blackburn | first1 = S. }}</ref>\n\n==Artistic activities==\n[[File:AAUG p06.png|thumb|right|alt=Head and shoulders drawing of a girl (Alice) holding a key|One of Carroll's own illustrations]]\n\n===Literature===\nFrom a young age, Dodgson wrote poetry and short stories, contributing heavily to the family magazine ''[[Mischmasch]]'' and later sending them to various magazines, enjoying moderate success. Between 1854 and 1856, his work appeared in the national publications ''The Comic Times'' and ''The Train'', as well as smaller magazines such as the ''[[Whitby Gazette]]'' and the ''Oxford Critic''. Most of this output was humorous, sometimes satirical, but his standards and ambitions were exacting. \"I do not think I have yet written anything worthy of real publication (in which I do not include the ''Whitby Gazette'' or the ''Oxonian Advertiser''), but I do not despair of doing so someday,\" he wrote in July 1855.<ref name = \"ekfvyz\"/> Sometime after 1850, he did write [[marionette|puppet]] plays for his siblings' entertainment, of which one has survived: ''La Guida di Bragia''.<ref>{{Cite book| title=La Guida Di Bragia, a Ballad Opera for the Marionette Theatre| publisher=Lewis Carroll Society of North America| year=2007| chapter=Introduction| first=Peter L. |last=Heath| pages=vii\u2013xvi| isbn=0-930326-15-6 }}</ref>\n\nIn March 1856, he published his first piece of work under the name that would make him famous. A romantic poem called \"Solitude\" appeared in ''The Train'' under the authorship of \"Lewis Carroll\". This pseudonym was a play on his real name: ''Lewis'' was the anglicised form of ''Ludovicus'', which was the Latin for ''Lutwidge'', and ''Carroll'' an Irish surname similar to the Latin name ''Carolus'', from which comes the name ''Charles''.<ref name = \"kqihew\"/> The transition went as follows:\n\"Charles Lutwidge\" translated into Latin as \"Carolus Ludovicus\". This was then translated back into English as \"Carroll Lewis\" and then reversed to make \"Lewis Carroll\".<ref>Roger Lancelyn Green [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/97087/Lewis-Carroll On-line Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica ]</ref> This pseudonym was chosen by editor Edmund Yates from a list of four submitted by Dodgson, the others being Edgar Cuthwellis, Edgar U. C. Westhill, and Louis Carroll.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p.&nbsp;129</ref>\n\n====''Alice'' books====\n[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 30.png|thumb|alt=Illustration of Alice holding a Flamingo, standing with one foot on a curled-up hedgehog with another hedgehog walking away|\"The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo\".

Dodgson became close friends with Liddell's wife Lorina and their children, particularly the three sisters Lorina, Edith, and Alice Liddell. He was widely assumed for many years to have derived his own \"Alice\" from [[Alice Liddell]]; the [[acrostic]] poem at the end of ''Through the Looking-Glass'' spells out her name in full, and there are also many superficial references to her hidden in the text of both books. It has been noted that Dodgson himself repeatedly denied in later life that his \"little heroine\" was based on any real child,<ref>Cohen, Morton N. (ed) (1979) ''The Letters of Lewis Carroll'', London: Macmillan.</ref><ref name=\"nbrhxm\">[[#Leach|Leach]], Ch. 5 \"The Unreal Alice\"</ref> and he frequently dedicated his works to girls of his acquaintance, adding their names in acrostic poems at the beginning of the text. [[Gertrude Chataway]]'s name appears in this form at the beginning of ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'', and it is not suggested that this means that any of the characters in the narrative are based on her.<ref name=\"nbrhxm\"/>\n\nInformation is scarce (Dodgson's diaries for the years 1858\u20131862 are missing), but it seems clear that his friendship with the Liddell family was an important part of his life in the late 1850s, and he grew into the habit of taking the children on rowing trips (first the boy Harry, and later the three girls) accompanied by an adult friend<ref name=\"Winchester\">{{cite book| title=The Alice Behind Wonderland\n|first=Simon |last=Winchester\n|isbn= 978-0-19-539619-5 |oclc=641525313\n|url= https://archive.org/details/alicebehindwonde0000winc\n| url-access=registration\n|year= 2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press\n}}</ref> to nearby [[Nuneham Courtenay]] or [[Godstow]].<ref name=\"ulsdnc\">[[#Leach|Leach]], Ch. 4</ref>\n\nIt was on one such expedition on 4 July 1862 that Dodgson invented the outline of the story that eventually became his first and greatest commercial success. He told the story to Alice Liddell and she begged him to write it down, and Dodgson eventually (after much delay) presented her with a handwritten, illustrated manuscript entitled ''Alice's Adventures Under Ground'' in November 1864.<ref name=\"ulsdnc\"/>\n\nBefore this, the family of friend and mentor [[George MacDonald]] read Dodgson's incomplete manuscript, and the enthusiasm of the MacDonald children encouraged Dodgson to seek publication. In 1863, he had taken the unfinished manuscript to Macmillan the publisher, who liked it immediately. After the possible alternative titles were rejected \u2013 ''Alice Among the Fairies'' and ''Alice's Golden Hour'' \u2013 the work was finally published as ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' in 1865 under the Lewis Carroll pen-name, which Dodgson had first used some nine years earlier.<ref name=\"snaogq\" /> The illustrations this time were by [[John Tenniel|Sir John Tenniel]]; Dodgson evidently thought that a published book would need the skills of a professional artist.

He was inundated with fan mail and with sometimes unwanted attention.

Carroll entwines two plots set in two alternative worlds, one set in rural England and the other in the fairytale kingdoms of Elfland, Outland, and others. The fairytale world satirizes English society, and more specifically the world of academia. ''Sylvie and Bruno'' came out in two volumes and is considered a lesser work, although it has remained in print for over a century.\n\n===Photography (1856\u20131880) ===\n[[File:Alice Liddell 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Photo of [[Alice Liddell]] taken by Lewis Carroll (1858)]]\n\nIn 1856, Dodgson took up the new art form of photography under the influence first of his uncle [[Robert Wilfred Skeffington Lutwidge|Skeffington Lutwidge]], and later of his Oxford friend [[Reginald Southey]].<ref>[[#Clark|Clark]], p.&nbsp;93</ref> He soon excelled at the art and became a well-known gentleman-photographer, and he seems even to have toyed with the idea of making a living out of it in his very early years.<ref name = \"snaogq\"/>\n\nA study by Roger Taylor and Edward Wakeling exhaustively lists every surviving print, and Taylor calculates that just over half of his surviving work depicts young girls, though about 60% of his original photographic portfolio is now missing.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Taylor |first=Roger |last2=Wakeling |first2=Edward |title=Lewis Carroll, Photographer |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |date=25 February 2002 |isbn=978-0-691-07443-6}}</ref> Dodgson also made many studies of men, women, boys, and landscapes; his subjects also include skeletons, dolls, dogs, statues, paintings, and trees.<ref>Cohen, Morton (1999). \"Reflections in a Looking Glass.\" New York: Aperture.</ref> His pictures of children were taken with a parent in attendance and many of the pictures were taken in the Liddell garden because natural sunlight was required for good exposures.<ref name=\"Winchester\"/>\n\nHe also found photography to be a useful entr\u00e9e into higher social circles.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p.&nbsp;116</ref> During the most productive part of his career, he made portraits of notable sitters such as [[John Everett Millais]], [[Ellen Terry]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]].<ref name = \"snaogq\"/>\n\nBy the time that Dodgson abruptly ceased photography (1880, over 24 years), he had established his own studio on the roof of [[Tom Quad]], created around 3,000 images, and was an amateur master of the medium, though fewer than 1,000 images have survived time and deliberate destruction. He stopped taking photographs because keeping his studio working was too time-consuming.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p.&nbsp;265</ref> He used the [[Collodion|wet collodion process]]; commercial photographers who started using the [[Dry-plate photography#Popularization|dry-plate process]] in the 1870s took pictures more quickly.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wakeling |first=Edward |title=An Exhibition From the Jon A.

This was a cloth-backed folder with twelve slots, two marked for inserting the most commonly used penny stamp, and one each for the other current denominations up to one shilling. The folder was then put into a slipcase decorated with a picture of Alice on the front and the [[Cheshire Cat]] on the back.  It intended to organize stamps wherever one stored their writing utensils; Carroll expressly notes in ''[[Eight or Nine Wise Words about Letter-Writing|Eight or Nine Wise Words About Letter-Writing]]'' it is not intended to be carried in a pocket or purse, as the most common individual stamps could easily be carried on their own.

He appears to have invented \u2013 or at least certainly popularized \u2013 the \"doublet\" (see [[word ladder]]), a form of brain-teaser that is still popular today, changing one word into another by altering one letter at a time, each successive change always resulting in a genuine word. For instance, CAT is transformed into DOG by the following steps: CAT, COT, DOT, DOG.<ref name = \"snaogq\"/> The games and puzzles of Lewis Carroll were the subject of Martin Gardner's March 1960 [[Mathematical Games column]] in ''[[Scientific American]]''.\n\nOther items include a rule for finding the day of the week for any date; a means for justifying right margins on a typewriter; a steering device for a velociam (a type of tricycle);  fairer elimination rules for tennis tournaments; a new sort of postal money order; rules for reckoning postage; rules for a win in betting; rules for dividing a number by various divisors; a cardboard scale for the [[Senior Common Room]] at Christ Church which, held next to a glass, ensured the right amount of liqueur for the price paid; a double-sided adhesive strip to fasten envelopes or mount things in books; a device for helping a bedridden invalid to read from a book placed sideways; and at least two [[cipher]]s for [[cryptography]].<ref name = \"snaogq\"/>\n\nHe also proposed alternative systems of parliamentary representation.

He continued to teach at Christ Church until 1881 and remained in residence there until his death. The two volumes of his last novel, ''[[Sylvie and Bruno]]'', were published in 1889 and 1893, but the intricacy of this work was apparently not appreciated by contemporary readers; it achieved nothing like the success of the ''Alice'' books, with disappointing reviews and sales of only 13,000 copies.<ref>Angelica Shirley Carpenter (2002).

Cohen]] in his ''Lewis Carroll: A Biography'' (1995),<ref name=cohen-166254>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 166\u2013167, 254\u2013255</ref> [[Donald Serrell Thomas|Donald Thomas]] in his ''Lewis Carroll: A Portrait with Background'' (1995), and [[Michael Bakewell]] in his ''Lewis Carroll: A Biography'' (1996).\nCohen, in particular, speculates that Dodgson's \"sexual energies sought unconventional outlets\", and further writes:\n\n{{quote|We cannot know to what extent sexual urges lay behind Charles's preference for drawing and photographing children in the nude. He contended the preference was entirely aesthetic. But given his emotional attachment to children as well as his aesthetic appreciation of their forms, his assertion that his interest was strictly artistic is na\u00efve. He probably felt more than he dared acknowledge, even to himself.<ref>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], p.&nbsp;228</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Hatch, Beatrice (Lewis Carroll, 30.07.1873).jpg|thumb|upright|Lewis Carroll portrait of [[Beatrice Hatch]]]]\nCohen goes on to note that Dodgson \"apparently convinced many of his friends that his attachment to the nude female child form was free of any [[erotic]]ism\", but adds that \"later generations look beneath the surface\" (p.&nbsp;229). He argues that Dodgson may have wanted to marry the 11-year-old Alice Liddell, and that this was the cause of the unexplained \"break\" with the family in June 1863,<ref name=\"snaogq\"/> an event for which other explanations are offered. Biographers Derek Hudson and [[Roger Lancelyn Green]] stop short of identifying Dodgson as a [[paedophile]] (Green also edited Dodgson's diaries and papers), but they concur that he had a passion for small female children and next to no interest in the adult world. Catherine Robson refers to Carroll as \"the Victorian era's most famous (or infamous) girl lover\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Catherine|last=Robson|title=Men in Wonderland: The Lost Girlhood of the Victorian Gentlemen|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, New Jersey|date=2001|ISBN=978-0691004228|page=137}}</ref>\n\nSeveral other writers and scholars have challenged the evidential basis for Cohen's and others' views about Dodgson's sexual interests. [[Hugues Lebailly]] has endeavoured to set Dodgson's child photography within the \"Victorian Child Cult\", which perceived child nudity as essentially an expression of innocence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://contrariwise.wild-reality.net/association.html |title=Association for new Lewis Carroll studies |publisher=Contrariwise.wild-reality.net |accessdate=19 October 2019 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207054041/http://www.contrariwise.wild-reality.net/association.html |archivedate=7 February 2012 }}</ref> Lebailly claims that studies of child nudes were mainstream and fashionable in Dodgson's time, and that most photographers made them as a matter of course, including [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander]] and [[Julia Margaret Cameron]]. Lebailly continues that child nudes even appeared on Victorian [[Christmas card]]s, implying a very different social and aesthetic assessment of such material. Lebailly concludes that it has been an error of Dodgson's biographers to view his child-photography with 20th- or 21st-century eyes, and to have presented it as some form of personal idiosyncrasy, when it was a response to a prevalent aesthetic and philosophical movement of the time.\n\n[[Karoline Leach]]'s reappraisal of Dodgson focused in particular on his controversial sexuality. She argues that the allegations of paedophilia rose initially from a misunderstanding of Victorian morals, as well as the mistaken idea \u2013 fostered by Dodgson's various biographers \u2013 that he had no interest in adult women. She termed the traditional image of Dodgson \"the Carroll Myth\". She drew attention to the large amounts of evidence in his diaries and letters that he was also keenly interested in adult women, married and single, and enjoyed several relationships with them that would have been considered scandalous by the social standards of his time. She also pointed to the fact that many of those whom he described as \"child-friends\" were girls in their late teens and even twenties.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 16\u201317</ref> She argues that suggestions of paedophilia emerged only many years after his death, when his well-meaning family had suppressed all evidence of his relationships with women in an effort to preserve his reputation, thus giving a false impression of a man interested only in little girls. Similarly, Leach points to a 1932 biography by Langford Reed as the source of the dubious claim that many of Carroll's female friendships ended when the girls reached the age of 14.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&nbsp;33</ref>\n\nIn addition to the biographical works that have discussed Dodgson's sexuality, there are modern artistic interpretations of his life and work that do so as well \u2014 in particular, [[Dennis Potter]] in his play ''Alice'' and his screenplay for the motion picture ''[[Dreamchild]]'', and [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] in his film ''Alice''.\n\n===Ordination===\nDodgson had been groomed for the ordained ministry in the [[Church of England]] from a very early age and was expected to be [[holy orders|ordained]] within four years of obtaining his master's degree, as a condition of his residency at Christ Church. He delayed the process for some time but was eventually ordained as a deacon on 22 December 1861. But when the time came a year later to be ordained as a priest, Dodgson appealed to the dean for permission not to proceed. This was against college rules and, initially, Dean Liddell told him that he would have to consult the college ruling body, which would almost certainly have resulted in his being expelled. For unknown reasons, Liddell changed his mind overnight and permitted Dodgson to remain at the college in defiance of the rules.<ref>Dodgson's MS diaries, volume 8, 22\u201324 October 1862</ref> Dodgson never became a priest, unique amongst senior students of his time.\n\nThere is currently no conclusive evidence about why Dodgson rejected the priesthood. Some have suggested that his stammer made him reluctant to take the step because he was afraid of having to preach.<ref>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], p.&nbsp;263</ref>  Wilson<ref>[[#Wilson|Wilson]], pp. 103\u2013104</ref> quotes letters by Dodgson describing difficulty in reading lessons and prayers rather than preaching in his own words. But Dodgson did indeed preach in later life, even though not in priest's orders, so it seems unlikely that his impediment was a major factor affecting his choice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  Wilson also points out that the [[Bishop of Oxford]], [[Samuel Wilberforce]], who ordained Dodgson, had strong views against clergy going to the theatre, one of Dodgson's great interests. He was interested in minority forms of Christianity (he was an admirer of [[Frederick Denison Maurice|F. D. Maurice]]) and \"alternative\" religions ([[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]).<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&nbsp;134</ref> Dodgson became deeply troubled by an unexplained sense of sin and guilt at this time (the early 1860s) and frequently expressed the view in his diaries that he was a \"vile and worthless\" sinner, unworthy of the priesthood and this sense of sin and unworthiness may well have affected his decision to abandon being ordained to the priesthood.<ref>Dodgson's MS diaries, volume 8, see prayers scattered throughout the text</ref>\n\n===Missing diaries===\nAt least four complete volumes and around seven pages of text are missing from Dodgson's 13 diaries.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 48, 51</ref> The loss of the volumes remains unexplained; the pages have been removed by an unknown hand. Most scholars assume that the diary material was removed by family members in the interests of preserving the family name, but this has not been proven.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 48\u201351</ref> Except for one page, material is missing from his diaries for the period between 1853 and 1863 (when Dodgson was 21\u201331 years old).<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&nbsp;52</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Real Lewis Carroll / A Talk given to the Lewis Carroll Society |first=Edward |last=Wakeling |date = April 2003|url=http://www.wakeling.demon.co.uk/page3-real-lewiscarroll.htm |work=1855 ... 1856 ... 1857 ... 1858 ... 1862 ... 1863|accessdate=14 September 2009}}</ref>  This was a period when Dodgson began suffering great mental and spiritual anguish and confessing to an overwhelming sense of his own sin.

A popular explanation for one missing page (27 June 1863) is that it might have been torn out to conceal a proposal of marriage on that day by Dodgson to the 11-year-old Alice Liddell. However, there has never been any evidence to suggest that this was so, and a paper offers some evidence to the contrary which was discovered by [[Karoline Leach]] in the Dodgson family archive in 1996.<ref>Dodgson Family Collection, Cat. No. F/17/1. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20181116072055/http://www.lewiscarroll.cc/cutpages.html Cut Pages in Diary]\".

Part of it may have been written at the time when the pages were destroyed, though this is unclear. The document offers a brief summary of two diary pages that are missing, including the one for 27 June 1863. The summary for this page states that Mrs. Liddell told Dodgson that there was gossip circulating about him and the Liddell family's [[governess]], as well as about his relationship with \"Ina\", presumably Alice's older sister Lorina Liddell. The \"break\" with the Liddell family that occurred soon after was presumably in response to this gossip.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 170\u20132.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lewiscarroll.cc/cutpages.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116072055/http://www.lewiscarroll.cc/cutpages.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 November 2018 |work=Looking for Lewis Carroll |title=Text available on-line |accessdate=4 May 2007}}</ref> An alternative interpretation has been made regarding Carroll's rumoured involvement with \"Ina\": Lorina was also the name of Alice Liddell's mother. What is deemed most crucial and surprising is that the document seems to imply that Dodgson's break with the family was not connected with Alice at all; until a primary source is discovered, the events of 27 June 1863 will remain in doubt.\n\n===Migraine and epilepsy===\nIn his diary for 1880, Dodgson recorded experiencing his first episode of [[migraine]] with aura, describing very accurately the process of \"moving fortifications\" that are a manifestation of the aura stage of the syndrome.<ref name=w1>Wakeling, Edward (Ed.) \"The Diaries of Lewis Carroll\", Vol. 9, p.&nbsp;52</ref> Unfortunately, there is no clear evidence to show whether this was his first experience of migraine ''per se'', or if he may have previously suffered the far more common form of migraine without aura, although the latter seems most likely, given the fact that migraine most commonly develops in the teens or early adulthood. Another form of migraine aura called [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome]] has been named after Dodgson's little heroine because its manifestation can resemble the sudden size-changes in the book. It is also known as [[micropsia]] and [[macropsia]], a brain condition affecting the way that objects are perceived by the mind. For example, an afflicted person may look at a larger object such as a basketball and perceive it as if it were the size of a golf ball. Some authors have suggested that Dodgson may have suffered from this type of aura and used it as an inspiration in his work, but there is no evidence that he did.<ref name=\"Migraineand\">{{cite journal|title=Migraine and Lewis Carroll|author= Maudie, F.W. |journal=The Migraine Periodical|volume=17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 10218566\n| date = 1999\n| author1 = Podoll\n| first1 = K\n| title = Lewis Carroll's migraine experiences\n| journal = [[The Lancet]]\n| volume = 353\n| issue = 9161\n| pages = 1366\n| last2 = Robinson\n| first2 = D\n| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)74368-3\n}}</ref>\n\nDodgson also suffered two attacks in which he lost consciousness. He was diagnosed by a Dr. Morshead, Dr. Brooks, and Dr. Stedman, and they believed the attack and a consequent attack to be an \"epileptiform\" seizure (initially thought to be fainting, but Brooks changed his mind). Some have concluded from this that he was a lifetime sufferer of this condition, but there is no evidence of this in his diaries beyond the diagnosis of the two attacks already mentioned.<ref name=w1/> Some authors, Sadi Ranson in particular, have suggested that Carroll may have suffered from [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] in which consciousness is not always completely lost but altered, and in which the symptoms mimic many of the same experiences as Alice in Wonderland. Carroll had at least one incident in which he suffered full loss of consciousness and awoke with a bloody nose, which he recorded in his diary and noted that the episode left him not feeling himself for \"quite sometime afterward\". This attack was diagnosed as possibly \"epileptiform\" and Carroll himself later wrote of his \"seizures\" in the same diary.\n\nMost of the standard diagnostic tests of today were not available in the nineteenth century. Yvonne Hart, consultant neurologist at the [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], Oxford, considered Dodgson's symptoms. Her conclusion, quoted in Jenny Woolf's 2010 ''The Mystery of Lewis Carroll'', is that Dodgson very likely had migraine and may have had epilepsy, but she emphasises that she would have considerable doubt about making a diagnosis of epilepsy without further information.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Woolf |first=Jenny |title=The Mystery of Lewis Carroll |pages=298\u20139 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |isbn=978-0-312-67371-0|date=4 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Detail of Lewis Carroll memorial window - geograph.org.uk - 284592.jpg|thumb|right|Lewis Carroll memorial window (Mad Hatter and March Hare pictured) at [[All Saints' Church, Daresbury]], Cheshire]]\n\nThere are societies in many parts of the world dedicated to the enjoyment and promotion of his works and the investigation of his life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lewiscarrollsociety.org.uk/pages/eventspeopleplaces/societies.html |title=Lewis Carroll Societies |publisher=Lewiscarrollsociety.org.uk |date= |accessdate=12 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nCopenhagen Street in [[Islington]], north London is the location of the Lewis Carroll Children's Library.<ref>{{cite web\n |title='A most curious thing' / Lewis Carroll Library \n |url=http://www.designbybeam.com/environment/lewis-carroll-library-3/ \n |publisher=www.designbybeam.com \n |accessdate=15 March 2013 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403033148/http://www.designbybeam.com/environment/lewis-carroll-library-3 \n |archivedate= 3 April 2015 \n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, his great-nephew unveiled a memorial stone to him in [[Poets' Corner]], [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>{{cite news|title=LEWIS CARROLL IS HONORED ON 150TH BIRTHDAY|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/18/arts/lewis-carroll-is-honored-on-150th-birthday.html|accessdate=30 January 2015|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=18 December 1982}}</ref> In January 1994, an asteroid, [[6984 Lewiscarroll]], was discovered and named after Carroll.

He was noted for his facility at [[word play]], logic, and fantasy. The poems ''[[Jabberwocky]]'' and ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'' are classified in the genre of [[literary nonsense]]. He was also a [[mathematician]], [[photographer]], and Anglican [[deacon]].\n\nCarroll came from a family of [[high-church]] [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], and developed a long relationship with [[Christ Church, Oxford]], where he lived for most of his life as a scholar and teacher. [[Alice Liddell]], daughter of the Dean of Christ Church, [[Henry Liddell]], is widely identified as the original for ''Alice in Wonderland'', though Carroll always denied this.\n\nBorn in All Saints' Vicarage, [[Daresbury]], Cheshire, in 1832, Carroll is commemorated at [[All Saints' Church, Daresbury]], in its stained glass windows depicting characters from ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland''. In 1982, a memorial stone to Carroll was unveiled in [[Poets' Corner]], [[Westminster Abbey]].\n\n==Background and early life==\n[[File:CharlesDodgson.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photographic portrait of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), seated and holding a book|Lewis Carroll]]\nDodgson's family was predominantly [[Northern England|northern English]] (with [[Irish people|Irish]] connections), conservative and [[high-church]] [[Anglicanism|Anglican]]. Most of Dodgson's male ancestors were army officers or [[Church of England]] clergy. His great-grandfather, [[Charles Dodgson (bishop)|Charles Dodgson]], had risen through the ranks of the church to become the [[Bishop of Elphin]].<ref>[[#Clark|Clark]], p.&nbsp;10</ref>  His paternal grandfather, another Charles, had been an army captain, killed in action in Ireland in 1803 when his two sons were hardly more than babies.<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], pp. 6\u20137</ref> The older of these sons \u2013 yet another [[Charles Dodgson (priest)|Charles Dodgson]] \u2013 was Carroll's father. He went to [[Westminster School]] and then to [[Christ Church, Oxford]].  He reverted to the other family tradition and took [[holy orders]].  He was mathematically gifted and won a [[double first]] degree, which could have been the prelude to a brilliant academic career. Instead, he married his first cousin Frances Jane Lutwidge in 1830 and became a country [[parson]].<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], p.&nbsp;8</ref><ref name=\"kqihew\">[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 30\u201335</ref>\n\nDodgson was born in the small parsonage at [[Daresbury]] in [[Cheshire]] near the town of [[Warrington]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://g.co/maps/cp7d5|title=Google map of Daresbury, UK|accessdate=22 October 2011}}</ref> the eldest boy and the third child. Eight more children followed. When Charles was 11, his father was given the [[Benefice#Church of England|living]] of [[Croft-on-Tees]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]], and the whole family moved to the spacious rectory. This remained their home for the next 25 years.\n\nCharles's father was an active and highly conservative cleric of the [[Church of England]] who later became the [[Archdeacon of Richmond]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Biographies/Dodgson.html|title=Charles Lutwidge Dodgson|work=The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive|accessdate=8 March 2011}}</ref> and involved himself, sometimes influentially, in the intense religious disputes that were dividing the church. He was [[high church]], inclining toward [[Anglo-Catholicism]], an admirer of [[John Henry Newman]] and the [[Tractarian movement]], and did his best to instil such views in his children. Young Charles was to develop an ambivalent relationship with his father's values and with the Church of England as a whole.<ref>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 200\u2013202</ref>\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Lewis Carroll Self Portrait 1856 circa.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Photographic portrait of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (Lewis Carroll), seated and holding a book|Lewis Carroll self-portrait c. 1856]]\n\n===Home life===\nDuring his early youth, Dodgson was educated at home. His \"reading lists\" preserved in the family archives testify to a precocious intellect: at the age of seven, he was reading books such as ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]''. He also suffered from a [[Stuttering|stammer]] \u2013 a condition shared by most of his siblings<ref>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], p.&nbsp;4</ref> \u2013 that often inhibited his social life throughout his years. At the age of twelve he was sent to Richmond Grammar School (now part of [[Richmond School]]) in [[Richmond, North Yorkshire]].\n\n===Rugby===\nIn 1846, Dodgson entered [[Rugby School]] where he was evidently unhappy, as he wrote some years after leaving:\n{{quote|I cannot say ... that any earthly considerations would induce me to go through my three years again ... I can honestly say that if I could have been ... secure from annoyance at night, the hardships of the daily life would have been comparative trifles to bear.<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], pp. 30\u201331</ref>}}\nDodgson did not claim he suffered from bullying but cited little boys as the main targets of older bullies at Rugby.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=The Mystery of Lewis Carroll: Discovering the Whimsical, Thoughtful, and Sometimes Lonely Man Who Created \"Alice in Wonderland\"|last=Woolf|first=Jenny|publisher=St. Martin's Press|year=2010|isbn=9780312612986|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mysteryoflewisca0000wool/page/24 24]|url=https://archive.org/details/mysteryoflewisca0000wool/page/24}}</ref> Stuart Dodgson Collingwood, who was Dodgson's nephew, wrote that \"even though it is hard for those who have only known him as the gentle and retiring don to believe it, it is nevertheless true that long after he left school, his name was remembered as that of a boy who knew well how to use his fists in defence of a righteous cause\", which is the protection of the smaller boys.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nScholastically, though, he excelled with apparent ease. \"I have not had a more promising boy at his age since I came to Rugby\", observed mathematics master R.

Rejlander]]]]\nThe young adult Charles Dodgson was about {{convert|6|ft|2}} tall and slender, and he had curly brown hair and blue or grey eyes (depending on the account). He was described in later life as somewhat [[asymmetry|asymmetrical]], and as carrying himself rather stiffly and awkwardly, although this might be on account of a knee injury sustained in middle age. As a very young child, he suffered a fever that left him deaf in one ear. At the age of 17, he suffered a severe attack of [[Pertussis|whooping cough]], which was probably responsible for his chronically weak chest in later life. Another defect which he carried into adulthood was what he referred to as his \"hesitation\", a [[Stuttering|stammer]] that he acquired in early childhood and which plagued him throughout his life.<ref name = \"ekfvyz\"/>\n\nThe stammer has always been a significant part of the image of Dodgson. While one apocryphal story says that he stammered only in adult company and was free and fluent with children, there is no evidence to support this idea.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&nbsp;91</ref> Many children of his acquaintance remembered the stammer, while many adults failed to notice it. Dodgson himself seems to have been far more acutely aware of it than most people whom he met; it is said that he caricatured himself as the [[Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)|Dodo]] in ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'', referring to his difficulty in pronouncing his last name, but this is one of the many \"facts\" often repeated for which no first-hand evidence remains. He did indeed refer to himself as the dodo, but whether or not this reference was to his stammer is simply speculation.<ref name = \"ekfvyz\"/>\n\nDodgson's stammer did trouble him, but it was never so debilitating that it prevented him from applying his other personal qualities to do well in society. He lived in a time when people commonly devised their own amusements and when singing and recitation were required social skills, and the young Dodgson was well equipped to be an engaging entertainer. He reportedly could sing tolerably well and was not afraid to do so before an audience. He was adept at mimicry and storytelling, and was reputedly quite good at [[charades]].<ref name=\"ekfvyz\"/>\n\n===Social connections===\nIn the interim between his early published writings and the success of the ''Alice'' books, Dodgson began to move in the [[pre-Raphaelite]] social circle. He first met [[John Ruskin]] in 1857 and became friendly with him. Around 1863,\u00a0 he developed a close relationship with [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] and his family. He would often take pictures of the family in the garden of the Rossetti's house in Chelsea, London. He also knew [[William Holman Hunt]], [[John Everett Millais]], and [[Arthur Hughes (artist)|Arthur Hughes]], among other artists. He knew fairy-tale author [[George MacDonald]] well \u2013 it was the enthusiastic reception of ''Alice'' by the young MacDonald children that persuaded him to submit the work for publication.<ref name=\"ekfvyz\"/><ref name=\"snaogq\">[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 100\u20134</ref>\n\n===Politics, religion, and philosophy===\nIn broad terms, Dodgson has traditionally been regarded as politically, religiously, and personally conservative. [[Martin Gardner]] labels Dodgson as a [[Tory]] who was \"awed by lords and inclined to be snobbish towards inferiors.\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Introduction to The annotated Alice: Alice's adventures in Wonderland & Through the looking glass|last=Gardner|first=Martin|publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|year=2000|page=xv|isbn=0-517-02962-6}}</ref> [[William Tuckwell|The Reverend W. Tuckwell]], in his ''Reminiscences of Oxford'' (1900), regarded him as \"austere, shy, precise, absorbed in mathematical reverie, watchfully tenacious of his dignity, stiffly conservative in political, theological, social theory, his life mapped out in squares like Alice's landscape.\"<ref>{{cite book | title = Introduction to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass | last = Gardner | first = Martin | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2009 | page = xvi | isbn = 0-517-02962-6 }}</ref> Dodgson was ordained a deacon in the Church of England on 22 December 1861. In ''The Life and Letters of Lewis Carroll'', the editor states that \"his Diary is full of such modest depreciations of himself and his work, interspersed with earnest prayers (too sacred and private to be reproduced here) that God would forgive him the past, and help him to perform His holy will in the future.\"<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]]</ref> When a friend asked him about his religious views, Dodgson wrote in response that he was a member of the Church of England, but \"doubt[ed] if he was fully a 'High Churchman'\". He added:\n{{Quote|I believe that when you and I come to lie down for the last time, if only we can keep firm hold of the great truths Christ taught us\u2014our own utter worthlessness and His infinite worth; and that He has brought us back to our one Father, and made us His brethren, and so brethren to one another\u2014we shall have all we need to guide us through the shadows. Most assuredly I accept to the full the doctrines you refer to\u2014that Christ died to save us, that we have no other way of salvation open to us but through His death, and that it is by faith in Him, and through no merit of ours, that we are reconciled to God; and most assuredly I can cordially say, \"I owe all to Him who loved me, and died on the Cross of Calvary.\"|Carroll (1897)<ref>[[#Collingwood|Collingwood]], Chapter IX</ref>}}\n\nDodgson also expressed interest in other fields. He was an early member of the [[Society for Psychical Research]], and one of his letters suggests that he accepted as real what was then called \"thought reading\".<ref>{{cite book | title = The Society for Psychical Research, 1882\u20131982 A History | last = Hayness | first = Rene&#769;e | publisher = Macdonald & Co | place = London | year = 1982 | isbn = 0-356-07875-2 | pages = 13\u201314 }}</ref> Dodgson wrote some studies of various philosophical arguments. In 1895, he developed a philosophical regressus-argument on deductive reasoning in his article \"[[What the Tortoise Said to Achilles]]\", which appeared in one of the early volumes of ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/mind/IV.14.278| title = What the Tortoise Said to Achilles| journal = Mind| issue = 14| pages = 278| year = 1895| last1 = Carroll | first1 = L. }}</ref> The article was reprinted in the same journal a hundred years later in 1995, with a subsequent article by [[Simon Blackburn]] titled \"Practical Tortoise Raising\".<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1093/mind/104.416.695| title = Practical Tortoise Raising| journal = Mind| volume = 104| issue = 416| pages = 695| year = 1995| last1 = Blackburn | first1 = S. }}</ref>\n\n==Artistic activities==\n[[File:AAUG p06.png|thumb|right|alt=Head and shoulders drawing of a girl (Alice) holding a key|One of Carroll's own illustrations]]\n\n===Literature===\nFrom a young age, Dodgson wrote poetry and short stories, contributing heavily to the family magazine ''[[Mischmasch]]'' and later sending them to various magazines, enjoying moderate success. Between 1854 and 1856, his work appeared in the national publications ''The Comic Times'' and ''The Train'', as well as smaller magazines such as the ''[[Whitby Gazette]]'' and the ''Oxford Critic''. Most of this output was humorous, sometimes satirical, but his standards and ambitions were exacting. \"I do not think I have yet written anything worthy of real publication (in which I do not include the ''Whitby Gazette'' or the ''Oxonian Advertiser''), but I do not despair of doing so someday,\" he wrote in July 1855.<ref name = \"ekfvyz\"/> Sometime after 1850, he did write [[marionette|puppet]] plays for his siblings' entertainment, of which one has survived: ''La Guida di Bragia''.<ref>{{Cite book| title=La Guida Di Bragia, a Ballad Opera for the Marionette Theatre| publisher=Lewis Carroll Society of North America| year=2007| chapter=Introduction| first=Peter L. |last=Heath| pages=vii\u2013xvi| isbn=0-930326-15-6 }}</ref>\n\nIn March 1856, he published his first piece of work under the name that would make him famous. A romantic poem called \"Solitude\" appeared in ''The Train'' under the authorship of \"Lewis Carroll\". This pseudonym was a play on his real name: ''Lewis'' was the anglicised form of ''Ludovicus'', which was the Latin for ''Lutwidge'', and ''Carroll'' an Irish surname similar to the Latin name ''Carolus'', from which comes the name ''Charles''.<ref name = \"kqihew\"/> The transition went as follows:\n\"Charles Lutwidge\" translated into Latin as \"Carolus Ludovicus\". This was then translated back into English as \"Carroll Lewis\" and then reversed to make \"Lewis Carroll\".<ref>Roger Lancelyn Green [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/97087/Lewis-Carroll On-line Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica ]</ref> This pseudonym was chosen by editor Edmund Yates from a list of four submitted by Dodgson, the others being Edgar Cuthwellis, Edgar U. C. Westhill, and Louis Carroll.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p.&nbsp;129</ref>\n\n====''Alice'' books====\n[[File:Alice par John Tenniel 30.png|thumb|alt=Illustration of Alice holding a Flamingo, standing with one foot on a curled-up hedgehog with another hedgehog walking away|\"The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her flamingo\".

Dodgson became close friends with Liddell's wife Lorina and their children, particularly the three sisters Lorina, Edith, and Alice Liddell. He was widely assumed for many years to have derived his own \"Alice\" from [[Alice Liddell]]; the [[acrostic]] poem at the end of ''Through the Looking-Glass'' spells out her name in full, and there are also many superficial references to her hidden in the text of both books. It has been noted that Dodgson himself repeatedly denied in later life that his \"little heroine\" was based on any real child,<ref>Cohen, Morton N. (ed) (1979) ''The Letters of Lewis Carroll'', London: Macmillan.</ref><ref name=\"nbrhxm\">[[#Leach|Leach]], Ch. 5 \"The Unreal Alice\"</ref> and he frequently dedicated his works to girls of his acquaintance, adding their names in acrostic poems at the beginning of the text. [[Gertrude Chataway]]'s name appears in this form at the beginning of ''[[The Hunting of the Snark]]'', and it is not suggested that this means that any of the characters in the narrative are based on her.<ref name=\"nbrhxm\"/>\n\nInformation is scarce (Dodgson's diaries for the years 1858\u20131862 are missing), but it seems clear that his friendship with the Liddell family was an important part of his life in the late 1850s, and he grew into the habit of taking the children on rowing trips (first the boy Harry, and later the three girls) accompanied by an adult friend<ref name=\"Winchester\">{{cite book| title=The Alice Behind Wonderland\n|first=Simon |last=Winchester\n|isbn= 978-0-19-539619-5 |oclc=641525313\n|url= https://archive.org/details/alicebehindwonde0000winc\n| url-access=registration\n|year= 2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press\n}}</ref> to nearby [[Nuneham Courtenay]] or [[Godstow]].<ref name=\"ulsdnc\">[[#Leach|Leach]], Ch. 4</ref>\n\nIt was on one such expedition on 4 July 1862 that Dodgson invented the outline of the story that eventually became his first and greatest commercial success. He told the story to Alice Liddell and she begged him to write it down, and Dodgson eventually (after much delay) presented her with a handwritten, illustrated manuscript entitled ''Alice's Adventures Under Ground'' in November 1864.<ref name=\"ulsdnc\"/>\n\nBefore this, the family of friend and mentor [[George MacDonald]] read Dodgson's incomplete manuscript, and the enthusiasm of the MacDonald children encouraged Dodgson to seek publication. In 1863, he had taken the unfinished manuscript to Macmillan the publisher, who liked it immediately. After the possible alternative titles were rejected \u2013 ''Alice Among the Fairies'' and ''Alice's Golden Hour'' \u2013 the work was finally published as ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' in 1865 under the Lewis Carroll pen-name, which Dodgson had first used some nine years earlier.<ref name=\"snaogq\" /> The illustrations this time were by [[John Tenniel|Sir John Tenniel]]; Dodgson evidently thought that a published book would need the skills of a professional artist.

He was inundated with fan mail and with sometimes unwanted attention. Indeed, according to one popular story, [[Queen Victoria]] herself enjoyed ''Alice in Wonderland'' so much that she commanded that he dedicate his next book to her, and was accordingly presented with his next work, a scholarly mathematical volume entitled ''An Elementary Treatise on Determinants''.<ref>[[#Wilson|Wilson]]</ref><ref name=hhgg>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A4462670 |title=Lewis Carroll \u2013 Logician, Nonsense Writer, Mathematician and Photographer |publisher=BBC  |work=The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy |date=26 August 2005 |accessdate=12 February 2009}}</ref>  Dodgson himself vehemently denied this story, commenting \"...&nbsp;It is utterly false in every particular: nothing even resembling it has occurred\";<ref name=hhgg/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Dodgson |first=Charles |title=Symbolic Logic |year=1896}}</ref> and it is unlikely for other reasons.

Carroll entwines two plots set in two alternative worlds, one set in rural England and the other in the fairytale kingdoms of Elfland, Outland, and others. The fairytale world satirizes English society, and more specifically the world of academia. ''Sylvie and Bruno'' came out in two volumes and is considered a lesser work, although it has remained in print for over a century.\n\n===Photography (1856\u20131880) ===\n[[File:Alice Liddell 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.75|Photo of [[Alice Liddell]] taken by Lewis Carroll (1858)]]\n\nIn 1856, Dodgson took up the new art form of photography under the influence first of his uncle [[Robert Wilfred Skeffington Lutwidge|Skeffington Lutwidge]], and later of his Oxford friend [[Reginald Southey]].<ref>[[#Clark|Clark]], p.&nbsp;93</ref> He soon excelled at the art and became a well-known gentleman-photographer, and he seems even to have toyed with the idea of making a living out of it in his very early years.<ref name = \"snaogq\"/>\n\nA study by Roger Taylor and Edward Wakeling exhaustively lists every surviving print, and Taylor calculates that just over half of his surviving work depicts young girls, though about 60% of his original photographic portfolio is now missing.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Taylor |first=Roger |last2=Wakeling |first2=Edward |title=Lewis Carroll, Photographer |publisher=[[Princeton University Press]] |date=25 February 2002 |isbn=978-0-691-07443-6}}</ref> Dodgson also made many studies of men, women, boys, and landscapes; his subjects also include skeletons, dolls, dogs, statues, paintings, and trees.<ref>Cohen, Morton (1999). \"Reflections in a Looking Glass.\" New York: Aperture.</ref> His pictures of children were taken with a parent in attendance and many of the pictures were taken in the Liddell garden because natural sunlight was required for good exposures.<ref name=\"Winchester\"/>\n\nHe also found photography to be a useful entr\u00e9e into higher social circles.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p.&nbsp;116</ref> During the most productive part of his career, he made portraits of notable sitters such as [[John Everett Millais]], [[Ellen Terry]], [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]], [[Julia Margaret Cameron]], [[Michael Faraday]], [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]], and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson]].<ref name = \"snaogq\"/>\n\nBy the time that Dodgson abruptly ceased photography (1880, over 24 years), he had established his own studio on the roof of [[Tom Quad]], created around 3,000 images, and was an amateur master of the medium, though fewer than 1,000 images have survived time and deliberate destruction. He stopped taking photographs because keeping his studio working was too time-consuming.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]], p.&nbsp;265</ref> He used the [[Collodion|wet collodion process]]; commercial photographers who started using the [[Dry-plate photography#Popularization|dry-plate process]] in the 1870s took pictures more quickly.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wakeling |first=Edward |title=An Exhibition From the Jon A.

This was a cloth-backed folder with twelve slots, two marked for inserting the most commonly used penny stamp, and one each for the other current denominations up to one shilling. The folder was then put into a slipcase decorated with a picture of Alice on the front and the [[Cheshire Cat]] on the back.  It intended to organize stamps wherever one stored their writing utensils; Carroll expressly notes in ''[[Eight or Nine Wise Words about Letter-Writing|Eight or Nine Wise Words About Letter-Writing]]'' it is not intended to be carried in a pocket or purse, as the most common individual stamps could easily be carried on their own.

He appears to have invented \u2013 or at least certainly popularized \u2013 the \"doublet\" (see [[word ladder]]), a form of brain-teaser that is still popular today, changing one word into another by altering one letter at a time, each successive change always resulting in a genuine word. For instance, CAT is transformed into DOG by the following steps: CAT, COT, DOT, DOG.<ref name = \"snaogq\"/> The games and puzzles of Lewis Carroll were the subject of Martin Gardner's March 1960 [[Mathematical Games column]] in ''[[Scientific American]]''.\n\nOther items include a rule for finding the day of the week for any date; a means for justifying right margins on a typewriter; a steering device for a velociam (a type of tricycle);  fairer elimination rules for tennis tournaments; a new sort of postal money order; rules for reckoning postage; rules for a win in betting; rules for dividing a number by various divisors; a cardboard scale for the [[Senior Common Room]] at Christ Church which, held next to a glass, ensured the right amount of liqueur for the price paid; a double-sided adhesive strip to fasten envelopes or mount things in books; a device for helping a bedridden invalid to read from a book placed sideways; and at least two [[cipher]]s for [[cryptography]].<ref name = \"snaogq\"/>\n\nHe also proposed alternative systems of parliamentary representation.

He continued to teach at Christ Church until 1881 and remained in residence there until his death. The two volumes of his last novel, ''[[Sylvie and Bruno]]'', were published in 1889 and 1893, but the intricacy of this work was apparently not appreciated by contemporary readers; it achieved nothing like the success of the ''Alice'' books, with disappointing reviews and sales of only 13,000 copies.<ref>Angelica Shirley Carpenter (2002).

He was two weeks away from turning 66 years old. His funeral was held at the nearby [[St Mary's Church, Guildford|St Mary's Church]].<ref>[http://www.thisisourtownguildford.co.uk/st-marys-church/10301656 Lewis Carroll and St Mary's Church \u2013 ''Guildford: This Is Our Town'' website]</ref> His body was buried at the [[Mount Cemetery]] in Guildford.<ref name = \"snaogq\"/>\n\n==Controversies and mysteries==\n\n===Discussion of Dodgson's sexual preferences===\nSome late twentieth-century biographers have suggested that Dodgson's interest in children had an erotic element, including [[Morton N. Cohen]] in his ''Lewis Carroll: A Biography'' (1995),<ref name=cohen-166254>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], pp. 166\u2013167, 254\u2013255</ref> [[Donald Serrell Thomas|Donald Thomas]] in his ''Lewis Carroll: A Portrait with Background'' (1995), and [[Michael Bakewell]] in his ''Lewis Carroll: A Biography'' (1996).\nCohen, in particular, speculates that Dodgson's \"sexual energies sought unconventional outlets\", and further writes:\n\n{{quote|We cannot know to what extent sexual urges lay behind Charles's preference for drawing and photographing children in the nude. He contended the preference was entirely aesthetic. But given his emotional attachment to children as well as his aesthetic appreciation of their forms, his assertion that his interest was strictly artistic is na\u00efve. He probably felt more than he dared acknowledge, even to himself.<ref>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], p.&nbsp;228</ref>}}\n\n[[File:Hatch, Beatrice (Lewis Carroll, 30.07.1873).jpg|thumb|upright|Lewis Carroll portrait of [[Beatrice Hatch]]]]\nCohen goes on to note that Dodgson \"apparently convinced many of his friends that his attachment to the nude female child form was free of any [[erotic]]ism\", but adds that \"later generations look beneath the surface\" (p.&nbsp;229). He argues that Dodgson may have wanted to marry the 11-year-old Alice Liddell, and that this was the cause of the unexplained \"break\" with the family in June 1863,<ref name=\"snaogq\"/> an event for which other explanations are offered. Biographers Derek Hudson and [[Roger Lancelyn Green]] stop short of identifying Dodgson as a [[paedophile]] (Green also edited Dodgson's diaries and papers), but they concur that he had a passion for small female children and next to no interest in the adult world. Catherine Robson refers to Carroll as \"the Victorian era's most famous (or infamous) girl lover\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Catherine|last=Robson|title=Men in Wonderland: The Lost Girlhood of the Victorian Gentlemen|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, New Jersey|date=2001|ISBN=978-0691004228|page=137}}</ref>\n\nSeveral other writers and scholars have challenged the evidential basis for Cohen's and others' views about Dodgson's sexual interests. [[Hugues Lebailly]] has endeavoured to set Dodgson's child photography within the \"Victorian Child Cult\", which perceived child nudity as essentially an expression of innocence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://contrariwise.wild-reality.net/association.html |title=Association for new Lewis Carroll studies |publisher=Contrariwise.wild-reality.net |accessdate=19 October 2019 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207054041/http://www.contrariwise.wild-reality.net/association.html |archivedate=7 February 2012 }}</ref> Lebailly claims that studies of child nudes were mainstream and fashionable in Dodgson's time, and that most photographers made them as a matter of course, including [[Oscar Gustave Rejlander]] and [[Julia Margaret Cameron]]. Lebailly continues that child nudes even appeared on Victorian [[Christmas card]]s, implying a very different social and aesthetic assessment of such material. Lebailly concludes that it has been an error of Dodgson's biographers to view his child-photography with 20th- or 21st-century eyes, and to have presented it as some form of personal idiosyncrasy, when it was a response to a prevalent aesthetic and philosophical movement of the time.\n\n[[Karoline Leach]]'s reappraisal of Dodgson focused in particular on his controversial sexuality. She argues that the allegations of paedophilia rose initially from a misunderstanding of Victorian morals, as well as the mistaken idea \u2013 fostered by Dodgson's various biographers \u2013 that he had no interest in adult women. She termed the traditional image of Dodgson \"the Carroll Myth\". She drew attention to the large amounts of evidence in his diaries and letters that he was also keenly interested in adult women, married and single, and enjoyed several relationships with them that would have been considered scandalous by the social standards of his time. She also pointed to the fact that many of those whom he described as \"child-friends\" were girls in their late teens and even twenties.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 16\u201317</ref> She argues that suggestions of paedophilia emerged only many years after his death, when his well-meaning family had suppressed all evidence of his relationships with women in an effort to preserve his reputation, thus giving a false impression of a man interested only in little girls. Similarly, Leach points to a 1932 biography by Langford Reed as the source of the dubious claim that many of Carroll's female friendships ended when the girls reached the age of 14.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&nbsp;33</ref>\n\nIn addition to the biographical works that have discussed Dodgson's sexuality, there are modern artistic interpretations of his life and work that do so as well \u2014 in particular, [[Dennis Potter]] in his play ''Alice'' and his screenplay for the motion picture ''[[Dreamchild]]'', and [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]] in his film ''Alice''.\n\n===Ordination===\nDodgson had been groomed for the ordained ministry in the [[Church of England]] from a very early age and was expected to be [[holy orders|ordained]] within four years of obtaining his master's degree, as a condition of his residency at Christ Church. He delayed the process for some time but was eventually ordained as a deacon on 22 December 1861. But when the time came a year later to be ordained as a priest, Dodgson appealed to the dean for permission not to proceed. This was against college rules and, initially, Dean Liddell told him that he would have to consult the college ruling body, which would almost certainly have resulted in his being expelled. For unknown reasons, Liddell changed his mind overnight and permitted Dodgson to remain at the college in defiance of the rules.<ref>Dodgson's MS diaries, volume 8, 22\u201324 October 1862</ref> Dodgson never became a priest, unique amongst senior students of his time.\n\nThere is currently no conclusive evidence about why Dodgson rejected the priesthood. Some have suggested that his stammer made him reluctant to take the step because he was afraid of having to preach.<ref>[[#Cohen|Cohen]], p.&nbsp;263</ref>  Wilson<ref>[[#Wilson|Wilson]], pp. 103\u2013104</ref> quotes letters by Dodgson describing difficulty in reading lessons and prayers rather than preaching in his own words. But Dodgson did indeed preach in later life, even though not in priest's orders, so it seems unlikely that his impediment was a major factor affecting his choice.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}  Wilson also points out that the [[Bishop of Oxford]], [[Samuel Wilberforce]], who ordained Dodgson, had strong views against clergy going to the theatre, one of Dodgson's great interests. He was interested in minority forms of Christianity (he was an admirer of [[Frederick Denison Maurice|F. D. Maurice]]) and \"alternative\" religions ([[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]]).<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&nbsp;134</ref> Dodgson became deeply troubled by an unexplained sense of sin and guilt at this time (the early 1860s) and frequently expressed the view in his diaries that he was a \"vile and worthless\" sinner, unworthy of the priesthood and this sense of sin and unworthiness may well have affected his decision to abandon being ordained to the priesthood.<ref>Dodgson's MS diaries, volume 8, see prayers scattered throughout the text</ref>\n\n===Missing diaries===\nAt least four complete volumes and around seven pages of text are missing from Dodgson's 13 diaries.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 48, 51</ref> The loss of the volumes remains unexplained; the pages have been removed by an unknown hand. Most scholars assume that the diary material was removed by family members in the interests of preserving the family name, but this has not been proven.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 48\u201351</ref> Except for one page, material is missing from his diaries for the period between 1853 and 1863 (when Dodgson was 21\u201331 years old).<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], p.&nbsp;52</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Real Lewis Carroll / A Talk given to the Lewis Carroll Society |first=Edward |last=Wakeling |date = April 2003|url=http://www.wakeling.demon.co.uk/page3-real-lewiscarroll.htm |work=1855 ... 1856 ... 1857 ... 1858 ... 1862 ... 1863|accessdate=14 September 2009}}</ref>  This was a period when Dodgson began suffering great mental and spiritual anguish and confessing to an overwhelming sense of his own sin. This was also the period of time when he composed his extensive love poetry, leading to speculation that the poems may have been autobiographical.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]] p.&nbsp;54</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Dodgson Family and Their Legacy|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/carroll/dreamchild/dreamchild5.html|accessdate=5 January 2011}}</ref>\n\nMany theories have been put forward to explain the missing material. A popular explanation for one missing page (27 June 1863) is that it might have been torn out to conceal a proposal of marriage on that day by Dodgson to the 11-year-old Alice Liddell. However, there has never been any evidence to suggest that this was so, and a paper offers some evidence to the contrary which was discovered by [[Karoline Leach]] in the Dodgson family archive in 1996.<ref>Dodgson Family Collection, Cat. No. F/17/1. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20181116072055/http://www.lewiscarroll.cc/cutpages.html Cut Pages in Diary]\". (For an account of its discovery see ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 3 May 1996.)</ref>\n\n[[File:Cutpagesdoc.jpg|thumb|upright|The \"cut pages in diary\" document, in the Dodgson family archive in Woking]]\nThis paper is known as the \"cut pages in diary document\", and was compiled by various members of Carroll's family after his death. Part of it may have been written at the time when the pages were destroyed, though this is unclear. The document offers a brief summary of two diary pages that are missing, including the one for 27 June 1863. The summary for this page states that Mrs. Liddell told Dodgson that there was gossip circulating about him and the Liddell family's [[governess]], as well as about his relationship with \"Ina\", presumably Alice's older sister Lorina Liddell. The \"break\" with the Liddell family that occurred soon after was presumably in response to this gossip.<ref>[[#Leach|Leach]], pp. 170\u20132.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lewiscarroll.cc/cutpages.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116072055/http://www.lewiscarroll.cc/cutpages.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=16 November 2018 |work=Looking for Lewis Carroll |title=Text available on-line |accessdate=4 May 2007}}</ref> An alternative interpretation has been made regarding Carroll's rumoured involvement with \"Ina\": Lorina was also the name of Alice Liddell's mother. What is deemed most crucial and surprising is that the document seems to imply that Dodgson's break with the family was not connected with Alice at all; until a primary source is discovered, the events of 27 June 1863 will remain in doubt.\n\n===Migraine and epilepsy===\nIn his diary for 1880, Dodgson recorded experiencing his first episode of [[migraine]] with aura, describing very accurately the process of \"moving fortifications\" that are a manifestation of the aura stage of the syndrome.<ref name=w1>Wakeling, Edward (Ed.) \"The Diaries of Lewis Carroll\", Vol. 9, p.&nbsp;52</ref> Unfortunately, there is no clear evidence to show whether this was his first experience of migraine ''per se'', or if he may have previously suffered the far more common form of migraine without aura, although the latter seems most likely, given the fact that migraine most commonly develops in the teens or early adulthood. Another form of migraine aura called [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome]] has been named after Dodgson's little heroine because its manifestation can resemble the sudden size-changes in the book. It is also known as [[micropsia]] and [[macropsia]], a brain condition affecting the way that objects are perceived by the mind. For example, an afflicted person may look at a larger object such as a basketball and perceive it as if it were the size of a golf ball. Some authors have suggested that Dodgson may have suffered from this type of aura and used it as an inspiration in his work, but there is no evidence that he did.<ref name=\"Migraineand\">{{cite journal|title=Migraine and Lewis Carroll|author= Maudie, F.W. |journal=The Migraine Periodical|volume=17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n | pmid = 10218566\n| date = 1999\n| author1 = Podoll\n| first1 = K\n| title = Lewis Carroll's migraine experiences\n| journal = [[The Lancet]]\n| volume = 353\n| issue = 9161\n| pages = 1366\n| last2 = Robinson\n| first2 = D\n| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(05)74368-3\n}}</ref>\n\nDodgson also suffered two attacks in which he lost consciousness. He was diagnosed by a Dr. Morshead, Dr. Brooks, and Dr. Stedman, and they believed the attack and a consequent attack to be an \"epileptiform\" seizure (initially thought to be fainting, but Brooks changed his mind). Some have concluded from this that he was a lifetime sufferer of this condition, but there is no evidence of this in his diaries beyond the diagnosis of the two attacks already mentioned.<ref name=w1/> Some authors, Sadi Ranson in particular, have suggested that Carroll may have suffered from [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] in which consciousness is not always completely lost but altered, and in which the symptoms mimic many of the same experiences as Alice in Wonderland. Carroll had at least one incident in which he suffered full loss of consciousness and awoke with a bloody nose, which he recorded in his diary and noted that the episode left him not feeling himself for \"quite sometime afterward\". This attack was diagnosed as possibly \"epileptiform\" and Carroll himself later wrote of his \"seizures\" in the same diary.\n\nMost of the standard diagnostic tests of today were not available in the nineteenth century. Yvonne Hart, consultant neurologist at the [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], Oxford, considered Dodgson's symptoms. Her conclusion, quoted in Jenny Woolf's 2010 ''The Mystery of Lewis Carroll'', is that Dodgson very likely had migraine and may have had epilepsy, but she emphasises that she would have considerable doubt about making a diagnosis of epilepsy without further information.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Woolf |first=Jenny |title=The Mystery of Lewis Carroll |pages=298\u20139 |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |isbn=978-0-312-67371-0|date=4 February 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:Detail of Lewis Carroll memorial window - geograph.org.uk - 284592.jpg|thumb|right|Lewis Carroll memorial window (Mad Hatter and March Hare pictured) at [[All Saints' Church, Daresbury]], Cheshire]]\n\nThere are societies in many parts of the world dedicated to the enjoyment and promotion of his works and the investigation of his life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lewiscarrollsociety.org.uk/pages/eventspeopleplaces/societies.html |title=Lewis Carroll Societies |publisher=Lewiscarrollsociety.org.uk |date= |accessdate=12 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nCopenhagen Street in [[Islington]], north London is the location of the Lewis Carroll Children's Library.<ref>{{cite web\n |title='A most curious thing' / Lewis Carroll Library \n |url=http://www.designbybeam.com/environment/lewis-carroll-library-3/ \n |publisher=www.designbybeam.com \n |accessdate=15 March 2013 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403033148/http://www.designbybeam.com/environment/lewis-carroll-library-3 \n |archivedate= 3 April 2015 \n}}</ref>\n\nIn 1982, his great-nephew unveiled a memorial stone to him in [[Poets' Corner]], [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>{{cite news|title=LEWIS CARROLL IS HONORED ON 150TH BIRTHDAY|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/18/arts/lewis-carroll-is-honored-on-150th-birthday.html|accessdate=30 January 2015|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=18 December 1982}}</ref> In January 1994, an asteroid, [[6984 Lewiscarroll]], was discovered and named after Carroll.
