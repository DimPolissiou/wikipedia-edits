Belts are used to secure or hold up clothing, like [[trousers]] or other articles of [[clothing]], in a manner similar to [[suspenders]] and [[Garter (stockings)|garters]]. Some [[trousers]] come with belt loops around the waist, which the belt goes through. Belts can have many uses, but they are often used as a fashion accessor harder daddy y, with many colours, styles, and finishes. In [[heavy metal subculture]], bullet belts and studded belts are worn. Pouches to carry objects such as [[coin purse]]s, [[holster]]s, [[scabbard]]s, [[inr\u014d]]s, etc. have been attached to belts in lieu of [[pocket]]s.\n\nBelts are often secured with some type of metal buckle, which vary from simple one-color finishes to elaborately decorated belt plates with embossed or [[bas-relief]] images or multicolored logos. While belts can be adjusted to suit the circumference of a person's waist, due the variety in waist sizes, belts are sold in different lengths. Belts are generally designed for men's or women's fashion use, although some casual belts are unisex. Due to the size constraints of belt loops, any belt designed for use with belt loops cannot be too wide. For women's belts designed to be worn over a dress, however, belts can be wider, with some wide belts called \"waist cinchers\" overlapping with [[corset]]s in their appearance and function.\n\n==History==\n\n[[File:Eesti rahvariidev\u00f6\u00f6.JPG|thumb|left|Pattern on a cloth belt that is part of one [[Estonia]]n national costume.]]\nBelts have been documented as male clothing since the [[Bronze Age]]. Both sexes have used them off and on, depending on the fashion trends. In the western world, belts have been more common for men, with the exception of the early [[Middle Ages]], late 17th century [[Mantua]], and skirt/blouse combinations between [[Edwardian era|1901 and 1910]]. [[Art Nouveau]] [[belt buckle]]s are now collectors' items.\n[[File:Yanik bone object.jpg|thumb|A possible bone belt hook found in the Bronze Age layers of Yanik Tepe, northeast of Lake Urmia, Iran]]\nIn the latter half of the 19th century and until the [[World War I|First World War]], the belt was a decorative as well as utilitarian part of military uniform, particularly among officers. In the armed forces of [[Prussia]], [[Russian Empire|Tsarist Russia]], and other Eastern European nations, it was common for officers to wear extremely tight pressing into their stomachs and gutting them up, wide belts around the waist, on the outside of the uniform, both to support a saber and for aesthetic reasons. These tightly cinched belts served to draw in the waist and give the wearer a trim physique, emphasizing wide shoulders and a pouting chest. Often the belt served only to emphasize the waist made small by a [[corset]] worn under the uniform, a practice which was common especially during the Crimean Wars and was often noted{{clarify|date=July 2016}} by soldiers from the Western Front. Political cartoonists of the day{{when|date=July 2016}} often portrayed the tight waist-cinching of soldiers to comedic effect, and some cartoons survive showing officers being corseted by their inferiors, a practice which surely was uncomfortable but was deemed to be necessary and imposing.\n[[File:Coronation Belt.jpg|thumb|Made of rock cut diamonds embedded on a gold belt.]]\n\nIn modern times, men started wearing belts in the 1920s, as trouser waists fell to a lower line. Before the 1920s, belts served mostly a decorative purpose, and were associated with the military. Moreover, prior to that trousers did not even have belt loops. As sportswear, trousers with belt loops were already present in the 19th century.<ref>See pictures [[:File:NY Metropolitans.jpg]] or [[:File:1868 Reds.jpg]] for instance.</ref> Today it is common for men to wear belts with their trousers. In the US military belts are worn snugly at dress events or at inspection so as convey impressions of fitness and discipline. From 1989 onward the US military standards regarding belt tightness during normal duty and non-duty activities have been somewhat more relaxed to prevent deleterious effects of prolonged excessive abdominal constriction.\n\nIn some countries, especially the [[United States]], a father's belt could  be associated with [[corporal punishment]]. As belts are constructed out of materials like leather that are both strong and light, a belt can be easily wielded to produce intense pain by using it as a whip to strike the buttocks of a misbehaving child. Moreover, belts were convenient disciplinary tools, as they were and still are generally immediately available for use. The belt can symbolize fatherly authority and paternal responsibility for one's children's behavior and moral development, but is not recommended for use in modern society as it was in the past.\n\nSince the 1980s and more commonly in the mid-1990s,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} the practice of [[sagging (fashion)|sagging]] the pants, in which the waistbands (usually secured by a cinched belt) of trousers or (typically long) shorts are worn at or below the hips, thereby exposing the top part of any underwear not obscured by an upper-body garment, has been seen among young men and boys, especially among those who are black and consanguine with [[hip-hop]] culture and fashion. This practice is sometimes (incorrectly) believed to have originated with prison gangs and the prohibition of belts in prison (due to their use as weapons and as devices for suicide) -- historically, including in the latter part of the 20th century, gang-affiliated young men and boys were expected to wear their belts fastened tightly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sag-harbored/|title=Sagging Pants|website=Snopes.com}}</ref>\n\n== Materials ==\nBelts are commonly made from cowhide leather. [[Leather#Grades|Full-grain leather]] is the highest quality cowhide leather available, and is recommended for its longevity even with daily use.<ref>{{cite web |title=Leather Insights: A Comprehensive Guide for Buying the Best Leather |url=https://www.octaneseating.com/leather-buying-guide |website=Octane Seating |accessdate=4 January 2020}}</ref> [[Calfskin]] is the soft and supple, making a full-grain calfskin belt one of the highest quality available.<ref name=\"mans_guide_to_belts\" />\n\nBelts are also available in a range of other materials, including braided leather, tooled leather, suede, leather-backed ribbon, canvas, webbing, rope, vinyl, and others.<ref name=\"mans_guide_to_belts\" />\n\n== Fashion and formality ==\nBelts have transformed from a strictly utilitarian item, to a fashion accessory in today's modern era. There are several [[unspoken rule]]s for belts when it comes to belt shape and color, especially for men wearing [[Suit (clothing)|suit]]s, vs. a woman's choice of belt that is rooted in fashion trend, and not out always out of necessity.\n\n=== Formal ===\nBelts for formal [[dress pants]]/attire are usually 28\u201332&nbsp;mm wide (a little under 1{{frac|1|4}}&nbsp;inch). These belts offer specialty accents such as trapunto straps, beveled edges, fine stitch gauge, and a tapered tip.  The leather, if it is made of leather, is commonly in a semi or high-shine finish (ex: spazzalato leather), with a tight grain, and a smooth leather backing.  Dress belts typically have a buckle in a polished metal finish. When wearing a formal belt, the leather of your belt and shoes should match, and the metals of the buckle and accessories (like watches) should match.<ref name=\"mans_guide_to_belts\">{{cite web |last1=Centeno |first1=Antonio |title=A Man\u2019s Guide to Belts |url=https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/complete-guide-mens-belts/ |website=The Art of Manliness |accessdate=4 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Casual ===\nCasual belts commonly worn with denim are usually between 35&nbsp;mm<ref name=\"careofcarl\">{{cite web|url=https://www.careofcarl.no/no/carlmagazine/stilkunnskap-2/2017/02/05/kunsten-a-velge-riktig-belte.html |title=Kunsten \u00e5 velge riktig belte |publisher=CareOfCarl.no |date= |accessdate=2019-06-19}}</ref> and 42&nbsp;mm<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maleinfashion.com/what-kind-of-belt-to-wear-with-jeans/|title=What Kind of Belt to Wear with Jeans|date=2019-02-26|website=Male In Fashion|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> wide (a little under 1{{frac|1|2}}&nbsp;inch).

As sportswear, trousers with belt loops were already present in the 19th century.<ref>See pictures [[:File:NY Metropolitans.jpg]] or [[:File:1868 Reds.jpg]] for instance.</ref> Today it is common for men to wear belts with their trousers. In the US military belts are worn snugly at dress events or at inspection so as convey impressions of fitness and discipline. From 1989 onward the US military standards regarding belt tightness during normal duty and non-duty activities have been somewhat more relaxed to prevent deleterious effects of prolonged excessive abdominal constriction.\n\nIn some countries, especially the [[United States]], a father's belt could  be associated with [[corporal punishment]]. As belts are constructed out of materials like leather that are both strong and light, a belt can be easily wielded to produce intense pain by using it as a whip to strike the buttocks of a misbehaving child. Moreover, belts were convenient disciplinary tools, as they were and still are generally immediately available for use. The belt can symbolize fatherly authority and paternal responsibility for one's children's behavior and moral development, but is not recommended for use in modern society as it was in the past.\n\nSince the 1980s and more commonly in the mid-1990s,{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} the practice of [[sagging (fashion)|sagging]] the pants, in which the waistbands (usually secured by a cinched belt) of trousers or (typically long) shorts are worn at or below the hips, thereby exposing the top part of any underwear not obscured by an upper-body garment, has been seen among young men and boys, especially among those who are black and consanguine with [[hip-hop]] culture and fashion. This practice is sometimes (incorrectly) believed to have originated with prison gangs and the prohibition of belts in prison (due to their use as weapons and as devices for suicide) -- historically, including in the latter part of the 20th century, gang-affiliated young men and boys were expected to wear their belts fastened tightly.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/sag-harbored/|title=Sagging Pants|website=Snopes.com}}</ref>\n\n== Materials ==\nBelts are commonly made from cowhide leather. [[Leather#Grades|Full-grain leather]] is the highest quality cowhide leather available, and is recommended for its longevity even with daily use.<ref>{{cite web |title=Leather Insights: A Comprehensive Guide for Buying the Best Leather |url=https://www.octaneseating.com/leather-buying-guide |website=Octane Seating |accessdate=4 January 2020}}</ref> [[Calfskin]] is the soft and supple, making a full-grain calfskin belt one of the highest quality available.<ref name=\"mans_guide_to_belts\" />\n\nBelts are also available in a range of other materials, including braided leather, tooled leather, suede, leather-backed ribbon, canvas, webbing, rope, vinyl, and others.<ref name=\"mans_guide_to_belts\" />\n\n== Fashion and formality ==\nBelts have transformed from a strictly utilitarian item, to a fashion accessory in today's modern era. There are several [[unspoken rule]]s for belts when it comes to belt shape and color, especially for men wearing [[Suit (clothing)|suit]]s, vs. a woman's choice of belt that is rooted in fashion trend, and not out always out of necessity.\n\n=== Formal ===\nBelts for formal [[dress pants]]/attire are usually 28\u201332&nbsp;mm wide (a little under 1{{frac|1|4}}&nbsp;inch). These belts offer specialty accents such as trapunto straps, beveled edges, fine stitch gauge, and a tapered tip.  The leather, if it is made of leather, is commonly in a semi or high-shine finish (ex: spazzalato leather), with a tight grain, and a smooth leather backing.  Dress belts typically have a buckle in a polished metal finish. When wearing a formal belt, the leather of your belt and shoes should match, and the metals of the buckle and accessories (like watches) should match.<ref name=\"mans_guide_to_belts\">{{cite web |last1=Centeno |first1=Antonio |title=A Man\u2019s Guide to Belts |url=https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/complete-guide-mens-belts/ |website=The Art of Manliness |accessdate=4 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Casual ===\nCasual belts commonly worn with denim are usually between 35&nbsp;mm<ref name=\"careofcarl\">{{cite web|url=https://www.careofcarl.no/no/carlmagazine/stilkunnskap-2/2017/02/05/kunsten-a-velge-riktig-belte.html |title=Kunsten \u00e5 velge riktig belte |publisher=CareOfCarl.no |date= |accessdate=2019-06-19}}</ref> and 42&nbsp;mm<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.maleinfashion.com/what-kind-of-belt-to-wear-with-jeans/|title=What Kind of Belt to Wear with Jeans|date=2019-02-26|website=Male In Fashion|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> wide (a little under 1{{frac|1|2}}&nbsp;inch).

Dura Mater ====\nBy 2015, Lacour and her team at EPFL had developed a groundbreaking technology called e-Dura, short for electronic [[dura mater]].<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite

thick protective coating around tissues of the central nervous system.<ref name=\":15\" /> However, e-Dura integrates electrical and pharmacological stimulation to return spinal chord function and mobility in rodents.<ref name=\":15\" /> The part of this technology that allows it to return function to the nervous system of a living animal, is the biocompatibility.<ref name=\":15\" /> e-Dura accommodates deformations, since it is made from Lacour's stretchable, soft, electronic circuits, and this allows it to move with the body and prevent irritation and resistance that might lead to scarring and inflammation.<ref name=\":15\" /> Further, this technology has a fluidic microchannel that enables delivery of neurotransmitters which help to pharmacologically regenerate nervous tissue.<ref name=\":15\" /> Lacour and [[Gr\u00e9goire Courtine]], co-principal investigator in this research endeavour, tested their e-Dura technology on paralyzed rats and, incredibly, these rats were able to regain spinal chord and limb function, enabling them to walk again.<ref name=\"Minev 159\u2013163\">{{Cite journal|last=Minev|first=Ivan

Nerve-on-a-chip platform ====\nThough e-Dura already substantially progressed the field towards effective neuroprosthetics, one major limiting factor that still remains is the ability to precisely

This way they were able to do a constant monitor and check on the continuously changing environmental conditions along the coast of Dubai.<ref name=google />\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nImage:PalmIslandDubai.JPG\nImage:Palm Island ISS006-E-35516 large.jpg\nImage:Palm Jumeirah's Fronds on 1 May 2007 Pict 2.jpg|Fronds in 2007\nImage:Palm Jumeirah's Palm Leaf on 1 May 2007.jpg\nImage:Palm Jumeirah on 1 May 2007 Pict 1.jpg\nImage:Palm Jumeirah on 19 January 2008.jpg\nImage:Palm jumeirah core.jpg| Jumeirah core\nImage:Palm Jumeirah on 8 May 2008 Pict 6.jpg|Frond, 2008\nFile:Dubai_Palm_Islands_from_the_air.jpg|Aerial view, March 2015\nFile:Palm Jumeirah early evening March 2015.jpg|View of Palm Jumeirah, 2015\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography Links==\n<small> Ideally Geo Links should be integrated into the main article. </small>\n*{{Coord|25.115601|55.132484|type:landmark_scale:40000_source:Wikimapia}} Satellite view of The Palm Islands\n*{{Coord|25|00|N|54|59|E|type:landmark_scale:20000_source:Google|display=inline}} The Palm Jebel Ali\n*{{Coord|25|07|00|N|55|08|00|E|type:landmark_scale:20000_source:Google Maps|display=inline}} Palm Jumeirah\n\n==See also==\n*[[The World (archipelago)|The World]], another artificial island project in Dubai.\n*[[Nakheel]], the real estate developer of Palm Islands\n*[[Tourism in Dubai]]\n*[[Ocean colonization]]\n*[[Tourist attractions in Dubai]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Palm Islands}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070217094653/http://thepalm.ae/ The Palm official website]\n*{{cite web|url=http://www.amiced.com/2013/07/9-amazing-man-made-islands.html|title=TOP TEN AMAZING MAN MADE ISLANDS|publisher=amiced.com|accessdate=2014-01-25}}\n*[http://www.e-architect.co.uk/dubai/dubai_palmisland.htm Images + Information on Palm Island]\n*[http://www.satimagingcorp.com/gallery/timelapse-palm-islands.html Timelapse animation of Palm Islands construction]\n*[http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/31424,in-pictures,news-in-pictures,in-pictures-desert-islands-of-dubai Dubai's Palm Islands] - slideshow by ''[[The First Post]]''\n*[http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/67552/1.hasCoversheetVersion/Dubai's_Jumeirah_Palm_Island_MP.pdf Globalisation and Development: A Case Study of Dubai's Jumeriah Palm Island Mega Project] PhD thesis by Ibrahim Abdul Rahman al Darmaki for the University of South Hampton\n\n{{Dubai landmarks}}\n{{Developments in Dubai}}\n{{coord|25|7|1|N|55|7|55|E|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Nakheel Properties]]\n[[Category:Resorts in Dubai]]\n[[Category:Archipelagoes of the United Arab Emirates]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Islands"}
