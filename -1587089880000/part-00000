After McGraw's success with his segments on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', ''Dr. Phil'' debuted on September 16, 2002. On both shows McGraw offers advice in the form of \"life strategies\" from his life experience as a [[clinical psychology|clinical]] and [[Forensic psychology|forensic psychologist]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.drphil.com/about-dr-phil/|title=About Dr. Phil {{!}} Dr. Phil|date=2015-10-22|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-08}}</ref>\n\nThe show is in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] throughout the United States and a number of other countries. Its tenth season premiered on September 12, 2011. Occasional prime time specials have aired on [[CBS]]. The program has been nominated for a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] every year since 2004. Since September 2008, ''Dr. Phil'' has been broadcast in HDTV with a revamped look and a new theme written and performed by McGraw's son, Jordan.\n\nThe executive producers are Phil McGraw and [[showrunner]] Oprah Winfrey. It is a production of [[Phil McGraw|Peteski Productions]] and distributed by [[CBS Television Distribution]]. [[Harpo Productions]] co-produced the series until 2010, with [[Paramount Domestic Television]] and its successor, [[CBS Paramount Domestic Television]], serving as secondary co-producers until 2007. It was originally distributed by [[King World Productions]].\n\nThe program is recorded before a live studio audience in Stage 29 on the [[Paramount Pictures]] lot in [[Hollywood, California]]. It is recorded from August through to May with a break in December for the holiday season. Reruns of earlier episodes of the series began broadcasting on the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|Oprah Winfrey Network]] in January 2011. On October 25, 2018, it was announced that ''Dr. Phil'' had been renewed for four additional seasons, taking the show to May 2023, or the end of its 21st season.\n\n==Format==\nThe show covers a wide variety of topics including [[weight loss]], [[financial planning]], errant children, gift suggestions, [[autistic]] children, unhappily [[marriage|married couples]], [[Teenage rebellion|rebellious teenagers]], mothers who dress far from their age, mothers who refuse to attend weddings, children being stars and their parents' rights, the emotional benefits of controlling, [[dysfunctional families]], mothers who refuse to give their married sons money, and support for charitable causes. Radio personality and former child star [[Danny Bonaduce]] came to the show twice in a year to discuss his failing [[marriage]] (and later [[divorce]]) with second wife Gretchen.\n\nOn several shows children and/or adults have taken [[lie detector|polygraph]] tests, usually done by retired FBI agent Jack Trimarco. The show is generally serious in tone, leavened with humor from time to time. It has its occasional tense moments and often [[trash TV|trashy]] scenes, like that of ''[[The Montel Williams Show]]'', but without melees or aggressive fights on stage, in contrast to ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' or ''[[The Steve Wilkos Show]]''. McGraw is noted for often bringing families back on multiple shows for follow-up \"therapy\" sessions in his segment called \"Dr. Phil Family.\"\n\nGenerally the program is filmed and guests appear in studio, but in 2006 the ''Dr. Phil House'' began as an occasional series. McGraw and his production staff invite guests to a special house wired with numerous cameras and microphones. There, his staff monitors the conversations of the guests he is trying to help, and intervenes when necessary in order to prevent physical violence. McGraw also provides on-the-spot advice and counseling to the \"house guests\". McGraw's wife Robin sits in the studio audience for almost every show and, at the end of the show, walks off the set with him.\n\n=={{anchor|Notable episodes}}Notable episodes==\n* In a show that aired on May 2, 2005, twin sisters Jocelyn and Crystal Potter appeared. Crystal claimed to want to work in the [[adult industry]] together with Jocelyn, who rejected the idea as repulsive. Brothel owner [[Dennis Hof]] was interviewed and stated that the two could make half a million dollars per year in his establishment. The sisters' testimony proved to be less than truthful: beginning in 2002, they appeared as the \"Potter Sisters\" in numerous pornographic films together, and in 2003, they even appeared together with Hof in the porn film ''Goin' Down At The Bunny Ranch''. The show received much criticism due to perceptions of hypocrisy, because even though McGraw was an outspoken critic of [[pornography]], his own son [[Jay McGraw]] was married to [[Erica Dahm]], a ''[[Playboy]]'' Playmate (December 1998), who was notable for performing with her two identical triplet sisters.<ref name=\"porn\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/313967p-268580c.html |title=Dr. Phil's Double Trouble|accessdate=January 31, 2008|publisher=New York Daily News|year=2005|author=Ben Widdicombe |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231052936/http://www.nydailynews.com/news/gossip/story/313967p-268580c.html |archivedate = December 31, 2005}}</ref><ref name=\"porn2\">{{Cite web|url=http://s91498905.onlinehome.us/DrPhil/|title=How Dr. Phil became Dr. Phoney|accessdate=January 31, 2008|publisher=OnlineHome.us|year=2005|author=Anon}}</ref>\n* The ''Dr. Phil House'' was set in an actual house within the [[Wilshire Park, Los Angeles, California|Wilshire Park]] neighborhood in Los Angeles. It received numerous complaints from neighbors about the disruption caused by filming crews, the guests, cables and production trucks clogging the neighborhood and the constant traffic caused by filming.  After the [[Los Angeles City Council]] revoked film permits, in September 2006, ''Dr. Phil'' stopped filming there. However, \"Peteski\" Productions, the show's production company, which drew its name from the nickname of one of McGraw's sons, retained ownership of the house. The ''Dr. Phil House'' later moved to a studio back lot, and the interior of the house shown in the program became that of a sound stage and ceased to be that of the actual house.<ref>\"Dr. Phil gets the heave-ho for filming abuses,\" Office of council member Tom Labonge, 4th Council District Newsletter [http://www.lacity.org/council/cd4/weekly/cd4weekly112541080_10132006.pdf]{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Last accessed December 12, 2006</ref>\n* In 2006, a [[confidence scam]] was discovered, involving a psychic shop that fraudulently represented ''Dr. Phil''.

Treasure made various claims to substantiate her belief that [[Transracial (identity)|transracial]] identity is a norm.\n* Due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], the show's regular programming format, studio location, as well as in-person guests was temporarily halted in late March of 2020, due to the social distancing measures, States of Emergency, and restrictions on public gatherings. Rather than hosting live-audience shows, or putting the show on hiatus, McGraw began hosting Dr. Phil from his home studio. The episodes typically began with McGraw being joined by various medical doctors, CDC officials and mental health professionals \u2013 via internet-conference \u2013 and discussed public concerns and anxieties surrounding the pandemic, as well as the mental and physical strain that viewers might have. This was the first time during the history of the Dr. Phil Show that regular, weekly episodes were not filmed in the Studio, and did not involve either in-person guests, audiences and very limited technical assistance.\n\n==''Dr. Phil Now''==\nEpisodes under the ''Dr. Phil Now'' banner usually feature current events in the news with McGraw's viewpoint, often with an interview with the subject involved, which may include a suspect in a [[true crime]] case, the parents in a contentious child custody battle, or a celebrity subject. These episodes often feature more urgent music, and often feature McGraw originating the segment from the [[master control]] room of [[KCBS-TV]] with a bank of monitors tuned to various news networks and local news stations to give a more news-like feel to the episode.\n\n==Criticism==\nMcGraw's advice and methods have drawn criticism from psychotherapists as well as from laypersons. McGraw said in a 2001 South Florida newspaper interview that he never liked traditional one-on-one counseling, and that \"I'm not the Hush-Puppies, pipe and 'Let's talk about your mother' kind of psychologist.\"<ref name=\"Lavin\">Lavin, Cheryl. \"Dr. Tell it Like it Is.\" ''South Florida Sun Sentinel'', July 3, 2001, Page 1E</ref> In 2004 the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] called McGraw's conduct in one episode of his television show \"unethical\" and \"incredibly irresponsible\".<ref name=\"Moraes 2004\">{{cite news |last=de Moraes |first=Lisa |title=On Dr. Phil, a Dose of Bad Medicine? |work=Washington Post | date=1 September 2004 |p=C7 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63905-2004Sep30.html | access-date=4 August 2017}}</ref> McGraw's critics regard advice given by him to be at best simplistic, and at worst, ineffective.<ref>{{cite book|title=SHAM; How the Self-Help Movement Made America Helpless|last=Salerno|first=Steve|publisher=Crown Publishers|year=2005|isbn=1-4000-5409-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/shamhowselfhelpm00sale}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|31em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{cite book|isbn=0-471-69659-5|title=The Making of Dr. Phil: The Straight-Talking True Story of Everyone's Favorite Therapist|author=Sophia Dembling, Lisa Gutierrez|publisher=Wiley|year=2005}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.drphil.com/}}\n\n{{U.S. daytime talk shows}}\n\n[[Category:2002 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2000s American television talk shows]]\n[[Category:2010s American television talk shows]]\n[[Category:2020s American television talk shows]]\n[[Category:American television spin-offs]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States]]\n[[Category:Popular psychology]]\n[[Category:Television series by CBS Television Studios]]\n[[Category:Television series by Harpo Productions]]\n[[Category:Television series by King World Productions]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American tabloid talk show}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2013}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name = Dr. Phil\n| image = Dr. Phil.png\n| genre = [[Talk show]]\n| language = English\n| opentheme = \"[[Shine (Meredith Brooks album)|Shine]]\" by [[Meredith Brooks]] used from 2002 to 2008\n| executive_producer = {{plainlist|\n* [[Oprah Winfrey]]\n* [[Phil McGraw]]\n}}\n| runtime = 45 to 48 minutes\n| creator = {{plainlist|\n* [[Oprah Winfrey]]\n* [[Phil McGraw]]\n}}\n| presenter = [[Phil McGraw]]\n| camera = [[Multiple-camera setup|Multiple]]\n| company = {{plainlist|\n* [[Harpo Productions]]<br>(2002\u20132010)<br>(seasons 1\u20138)\n* [[Phil McGraw|Peteski Productions]]\n* [[Paramount Domestic Television]]<br>(2002\u20132006)<br>(seasons 1\u20134)\n* [[CBS Paramount Domestic Television]]<br>(2006\u20132007)<br>(seasons 4\u20136)\n* [[CBS Television Distribution]]<br>(2007\u2013present)<br>(season 6 \u2013 present)\n}}\n| distributor = {{plainlist|\n* [[King World Productions|King World]]<br>(2002\u20132007)<br>(seasons 1\u20136)\n* [[CBS Television Distribution]]<br>(2007\u2013present)<br>(season 6 \u2013 present)\n}}\n| country = United States\n| network = [[Broadcast syndication|Syndication]]\n| picture_format = {{plainlist|\n* [[480i]] ([[Standard-definition television|SDTV]]) (2002\u20132008)\n* [[1080i]] ([[High-definition television|HDTV]]) (2008\u2013present)\n}}\n| first_aired = {{start date|2002|9|16}}\n| last_aired = present\n| num_seasons = 17\n| num_episodes = 2,191<ref>{{cite web|title=Episodes: ''Dr. Phil'' on Syndication|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/dr-phil/episodes/194969|work=TV Guide|accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref>\n| related = {{plainlist|\n*''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''\n*''[[The Doctors (talk show)|The Doctors]]''\n}}\n| website = http://www.drphil.com/\n}}\n\n'''''Dr. Phil''''' is an American [[talk show]] created by [[Oprah Winfrey]] and the host [[Phil McGraw]].

Treasure made various claims to substantiate her belief that [[Transracial (identity)|transracial]] identity is a norm.\n* Due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], the show's regular programming format, studio location, as well as in-person guests was temporarily halted in late March of 2020, due to the social distancing measures, States of Emergency, and restrictions on public gatherings. Rather than hosting live-audience shows, or putting the show on hiatus, McGraw began hosting Dr. Phil from his home studio. The episodes typically began with McGraw being joined by various medical doctors, CDC officials and mental health professionals \u2013 via internet-conference \u2013 and discussed public concerns and anxieties surrounding the pandemic, as well as the mental and physical strain that viewers might have. This was the first time during the history of the Dr. Phil Show that regular, weekly episodes were not filmed in the Studio, and did not involve either in-person guests, audiences and very limited technical assistance.\n\n==''Dr. Phil Now''==\nEpisodes under the ''Dr. Phil Now'' banner usually feature current events in the news with McGraw's viewpoint, often with an interview with the subject involved, which may include a suspect in a [[true crime]] case, the parents in a contentious child custody battle, or a celebrity subject. These episodes often feature more urgent music, and often feature McGraw originating the segment from the [[master control]] room of [[KCBS-TV]] with a bank of monitors tuned to various news networks and local news stations to give a more news-like feel to the episode.\n\n==Criticism==\nMcGraw's advice and methods have drawn criticism from psychotherapists as well as from laypersons. McGraw said in a 2001 South Florida newspaper interview that he never liked traditional one-on-one counseling, and that \"I'm not the Hush-Puppies, pipe and 'Let's talk about your mother' kind of psychologist.\"<ref name=\"Lavin\">Lavin, Cheryl. \"Dr. Tell it Like it Is.\" ''South Florida Sun Sentinel'', July 3, 2001, Page 1E</ref> In 2004 the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] called McGraw's conduct in one episode of his television show \"unethical\" and \"incredibly irresponsible\".<ref name=\"Moraes 2004\">{{cite news |last=de Moraes |first=Lisa |title=On Dr. Phil, a Dose of Bad Medicine? |work=Washington Post | date=1 September 2004 |p=C7 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63905-2004Sep30.html | access-date=4 August 2017}}</ref> McGraw's critics regard advice given by him to be at best simplistic, and at worst, ineffective.<ref>{{cite book|title=SHAM; How the Self-Help Movement Made America Helpless|last=Salerno|first=Steve|publisher=Crown Publishers|year=2005|isbn=1-4000-5409-5|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/shamhowselfhelpm00sale}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|31em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{cite book|isbn=0-471-69659-5|title=The Making of Dr. Phil: The Straight-Talking True Story of Everyone's Favorite Therapist|author=Sophia Dembling, Lisa Gutierrez|publisher=Wiley|year=2005}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{Official website|http://www.drphil.com/}}\n\n{{U.S. daytime talk shows}}\n\n[[Category:2002 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2000s American television talk shows]]\n[[Category:2010s American television talk shows]]\n[[Category:2020s American television talk shows]]\n[[Category:American television spin-offs]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:First-run syndicated television programs in the United States]]\n[[Category:Popular psychology]]\n[[Category:Television series by CBS Television Studios]]\n[[Category:Television series by Harpo Productions]]\n[[Category:Television series by King World Productions]]\n", "name_user": "2001:8003:6052:3100:593a:1492:9783:74ca", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Added content)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr._Phil_(talk_show)"}

Beginning his career in 1971, he reached the top ''[[makuuchi]]'' division in 1977 but after a serious injury in 1979 he fell greatly in rank before staging a comeback. His highest rank was ''[[\u014dzeki]],'' which he reached in 1981. He won two tournament championships and was a runner-up in two others. He won six [[sansho (sumo)|special prizes]] and six [[kinboshi|gold stars]] for defeating [[yokozuna]]. He retired in 1985 and became an [[toshiyori|elder]] of the [[Japan Sumo Association]] and the head coach of [[Oguruma stable]].\n\n==Career==\nScouted by the 53rd ''[[Yokozuna (sumo)|Yokozuna]]'' [[Kotozakura Masakatsu|Kotozakura]], he joined [[Sadogatake stable]] in July 1971. He was only 14 years old and still at junior high school, and in his early days in the ''[[jonidan]]'' division he was excused from fighting some matches to attend school, not travelling to the regional tournaments and fighting only on Sunday in the Tokyo ones. He reached the ''[[sekitori]]'' level in November 1975 upon promotion to the second highest ''[[j\u016bry\u014d]]'' division and in January 1977 he made his debut in the top ''[[makuuchi]]'' division. He got as far as ''[[sekiwake]]'' before suffering a severe injury to his left knee joint which forced him to miss several tournaments and plunge all the way down to the unsalaried ''[[makushita]]'' division. He made his way back to the top division in just one year. By March 1981 he had returned to sekiwake and in September 1981 he captured his first tournament championship with a 12\u20133 record, finishing one win ahead of ''yokozuna'' [[Wakanohana Kanji II|Wakanohana II]].  He was immediately promoted to sumo's second highest rank of ''\u014dzeki''. He took his second championship in January 1983 with a 14\u20131 score, beating [[Asashio Taro IV|Asashio]] in a playoff. In September 1984 he defeated a newcomer to the division who was in contention for the tournament title, the gigantic [[Konishiki]], in a mammoth two-minute struggle on the final day. Kotokaze later recalled this bout as his most memorable ever. In May 1985 he suffered another serious injury, this time to his right knee, and he decided to retire in November 1985 at the age of twenty eight.\n\n==After retirement==\nKotokaze became an elder of the [[Sumo Association]] under the name Oguruma Oyakata. In 1987 he left Sadogatake to set up his own [[Oguruma stable]]. He gives all of his new recruits ''[[shikona]]'' with the suffix \"kaze\" (wind), taken from his own fighting name. The first wrestler from the stable to achieve ''sekitori'' status was [[Tomikaze]] in July 2000. As of March 2019, Oguruma stable has produced six wrestlers with top division experience, [[Takekaze]], [[Yoshikaze]], [[Kimikaze]], [[Amakaze]], [[Yago Takanori|Yago]] and [[Tomokaze Yuta|Tomokaze]]. Another, [[Wakakirin]], (who originally came from a different stable) was dismissed from the Sumo Association because of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] use in February 2009. Oguruma was demoted from his post in the Association as a result.  In September 2010, two men were arresting for attempting to blackmail Kotokaze, sending him a letter threatening to reveal his connections to a \"violent criminal gang\" (usually a euphemism for yakuza) in his younger years.<ref>{{cite web | title=\u5c3e\u8eca\u89aa\u65b9\u306b\u300c\u3042\u306e\u6642\u306e\u91d1\u8fd4\u305b\u300d\u8105\u8feb\u5bb9\u7591\u3067\u7537\u3089\u902e\u6355| publisher=\u30c6\u30ec\u671dNews| url=http://news.tv-asahi.co.jp/news/web/html/200910056.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20110722100312/http://news.tv-asahi.co.jp/news/web/html/200910056.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=2011-07-22| accessdate=2010-09-11}} </ref> In April 2011 he was hit with another demotion after a ''j\u016bry\u014d'' division wrestler from his stable, [[Hoshikaze]], was forced to retire after a [[match-fixing in professional sumo|match-fixing scandal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Two more wrestlers forced to quit sumo|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/ss20110412a1.html|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=30 January 2012|date=12 April 2011}}</ref>  However, in February 2012 he was elected to the Sumo Association board of directors.\n\nKotokaze is also a regular commentator on [[NHK]]'s sumo tournament broadcasts.\n\n==Fighting style==\nKotokaze's most common winning ''[[kimarite]]'' or technique was overwhelmingly a straightforward ''yori-kiri'' or force out, which accounted for over half his wins at ''[[sekitori]]'' level. He favoured ''hidari-yotsu'', or a right hand outside, left hand inside grip on his opponent's ''[[mawashi]]''. He very rarely employed throwing moves.\n\n==Career record==\n{{Sumo record box start|Kotokaze Koki<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Kotokaze Koki Rikishi Information| publisher=Sumo Reference|

In September 2010, two men were arresting for attempting to blackmail Kotokaze, sending him a letter threatening to reveal his connections to a \"violent criminal gang\" (usually a euphemism for yakuza) in his younger years.<ref>{{cite web | title=\u5c3e\u8eca\u89aa\u65b9\u306b\u300c\u3042\u306e\u6642\u306e\u91d1\u8fd4\u305b\u300d\u8105\u8feb\u5bb9\u7591\u3067\u7537\u3089\u902e\u6355| publisher=\u30c6\u30ec\u671dNews| url=http://news.tv-asahi.co.jp/news/web/html/200910056.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20110722100312/http://news.tv-asahi.co.jp/news/web/html/200910056.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=2011-07-22| accessdate=2010-09-11}} </ref> In April 2011 he was hit with another demotion after a ''j\u016bry\u014d'' division wrestler from his stable, [[Hoshikaze]], was forced to retire after a [[match-fixing in professional sumo|match-fixing scandal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Two more wrestlers forced to quit sumo|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/ss20110412a1.html|publisher=Japan Times|accessdate=30 January 2012|date=12 April 2011}}</ref>  However, in February 2012 he was elected to the Sumo Association board of directors.\n\nKotokaze is also a regular commentator on [[NHK]]'s sumo tournament broadcasts.\n\n==Fighting style==\nKotokaze's most common winning [[kimarite]] or technique was overwhelmingly a straightforward ''yori-kiri'' or force out, which accounted for over half his wins at ''[[sekitori]]'' level. He favoured ''hidari-yotsu'', or a right hand outside, left hand inside grip on his opponent's ''[[mawashi]]''. He very rarely employed throwing moves.\n\n==Career record==\n{{Sumo record box start|Kotokaze Koki<ref>{{cite web | author= | title=Kotokaze Koki Rikishi Information| publisher=Sumo Reference| url=http://sumodb.sumogames.de/Rikishi.aspx?r=4112| date= | accessdate=3 March 2016}}</ref>\n}}\n{{Sumo record year start|1971}}\n    {{Basho}}\n    {{Basho}}\n    {{Basho}}\n    {{Basho|maezumou}}\n    {{Basho|jk|9|w|3|4}}\n    {{Basho|jo|97|e|3|1}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1972}}\n    {{Basho|jo|59|w|1|2}}\n    {{Basho|jo|77|w|}}\n    {{Basho|jo|77|w|2|1}}\n    {{Basho|jo|47|e|}}\n    {{Basho|jo|46|e|1|2}}\n    {{Basho|jo|54|e|}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1973}}\n    {{Basho|jo|54|e|3|0}}\n    {{Basho|jo|19|w|3|4}}\n    {{Basho|JO|32|e|6|1}}\n    {{Basho|sa|69|e|4|3}}\n    {{Basho|sa|52|w|5|2}}\n    {{Basho|sa|24|e|5|2}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1974}}\n    {{Basho|sa|1|e|3|4}}\n    {{Basho|sa|10|e|4|3}}\n    {{Basho|ma|57|e|3|4}}\n    {{Basho|sa|8|w|3|4}}\n    {{Basho|sa|18|e|5|2}}\n    {{Basho|ma|54|e|5|2}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1975}}\n    {{Basho|ma|31|w|4|3}}\n    {{Basho|ma|25|e|6|1}}\n    {{Basho|ma|8|w|5|2}}\n    {{Basho|ma|2|w|4|3}}\n    {{Basho|ma|1|w|5|2}}\n    {{Basho|j|12|w|8|7}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1976}}\n    {{Basho|j|9|e|8|7}}\n    {{Basho|j|7|w|9|6}}\n    {{Basho|j|2|w|5|10}}\n    {{Basho|j|7|w|8|7}}\n    {{Basho|j|7|e|9|6}}\n    {{Basho|j|1|e|9|6}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1977}}\n    {{Basho|m|11|w|8|7}}\n    {{Basho|m|6|e|9|6}}\n    {{Basho|m|1|e|5|10}}\n    {{Basho|m|7|w|8|7}}\n    {{Basho|m|5|w|8|7}}\n    {{Basho|m|1|e|10|5|||o|*}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1978}}\n    {{Basho|s|1|w|5|10}}\n    {{Basho|m|3|e|6|9|||*}}\n    {{Basho|m|6|w|12|3|||O|*}}\n    {{Basho|s|1|w|7|8}}\n    {{Basho|k|1|w|7|8}}\n    {{Basho|m|1|w|0|3|12}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1979}}\n    {{Basho|m|13|e|3|2|10}}\n    {{Basho|kyujo|rank=j|r-no=7|tozai=w}}\n    {{Basho|kyujo|rank=MA|r-no=5|tozai=w}}\n    {{Basho|MA|30|w|6|1}}\n    {{Basho|MA|8|w|7|0|P<br>Champion}}\n    {{Basho|j|11|w|14|1<br>Champion}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1980}}\n    {{Basho|m|14|w|12|3||j|F}}\n    {{Basho|m|1|e|10|5|||f}}\n    {{Basho|s|1|w|10|5|||o}}\n    {{Basho|s|1|e|6|4|5}}\n    {{Basho|kyujo|rank=m|r-no=2|tozai=w}}\n    {{Basho|m|2|w|7|8|||*}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1981}}\n    {{Basho|m|3|w|10|5|||*|*}}\n    {{Basho|s|1|w|9|6}}\n    {{Basho|k|1|w|9|6}}\n    {{Basho|s|1|e|10|5}}\n    {{Basho|s|1|e|12|3||y|t}}\n    {{Basho|o||e|11|4}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1982}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|e|10|5}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|e|9|6}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|w|9|6}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|w|11|4||j}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|e|9|6}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|w|10|5}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1983}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|w|14|1|P|y}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|e|11|4}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|w|11|4}}\n    {{Basho|o|2|w|12|3}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|e|11|4}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|w|11|4}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1984}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|w|11|4}}\n    {{Basho|o|1|w|9|6}}\n    {{Basho|o|2|e|9|6}}\n    {{Basho|o|2|w|8|7}}\n    {{Basho|o|2|w|10|5}}\n    {{Basho|o|2|e|10|5}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n  {{Sumo record year start|1985}}\n    {{Basho|o|2|e|8|7}}\n    {{Basho|o|2|w|5|10}}\n    {{Basho|o|2|w|3|4|8}}\n    {{Basho|kyujo|rank=s|r-no=2|tozai=w}}\n    {{Basho|kyujo|rank=s|r-no=2|tozai=e}}\n    {{Basho|intai|rank=m|r-no=10|tozai=e|win=0|loss=4}}\n  {{Sumo record year end}}\n{{Sumo record box end}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Glossary of sumo terms]]\n*[[List of \u014dzeki]]\n*[[List of past sumo wrestlers]]\n*[[List of sumo elders]]\n*[[List of sumo tournament top division champions]]\n*[[List of sumo tournament top division runners-up]]\n*[[List of sumo tournament second division champions]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070820075354/http://sumo.goo.ne.jp/eng/ozumo_meikan/sumo_beya/oguruma.html Oguruma stable profile]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kotokaze Koki}}\n[[Category:1957 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Japanese sumo wrestlers]]\n[[Category:\u014czeki]]\n[[Category:People from Tsu, Mie]]\n[[Category:Sumo people from Mie Prefecture]]\n[[Category:Sadogatake stable wrestlers]]\n", "name_user": "Pawnkingthree", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFighting style:tidy", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotokaze_K%C5%8Dki"}
