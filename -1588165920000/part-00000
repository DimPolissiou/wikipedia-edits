He signed with [[Premier League]] club [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in 2006, then went on to play in England's top flight for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] before returning to Portsmouth in 2011. The following year, he returned to South Africa with [[Chippa United]] and then Bidvest Wits.\n\nBenjani played a total 31 times for the [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe national team]] and was its captain for many of those matches. A member of the squad at the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]], he retired from international football in October 2010 to concentrate on his club career.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early career===\nBenjani began his career at Lulu Rovers, Highlanders FC Juniors, Zimba Africa Rivers, University of Zimbabwe teams in Zimbabwe's Division one and [[Air Zimbabwe Jets]] in the country's Premier League in 1999. He moved to South African club [[Jomo Cosmos Football Club|Jomo Cosmos]] in 1999 where he met his mentor [[Jomo Sono]], after impressing in the friendly match between [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] that was played to commemorate the inauguration of [[Thabo Mbeki]] as the president of South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nIn 2001, he was voted [[PSL Player of the Season]] and [[PSL Players' Player of the Season]] in South Africa.\n\n===Grasshopper and Auxerre===\nBenjani moved to Swiss club [[Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich|Grasshoppers]] on loan in 2001. In 2002, [[Guy Roux]] took him to [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]] of France. Benjani had a good run at the start, capitalising from [[Djibril Ciss\u00e9]]'s absence, becoming top goalscorer in [[Ligue 1]]. Roux never played the two together, and eventually Benjani found himself surplus to requirements under Roux's successor, [[Jacques Santini]], this time forced out of the 4\u20135\u20131 formation by [[Luigi Pieroni]]. While at Auxerre, Benjani scored the opening goal in the [[Coupe de France Final 2005|2005 Coupe de France final]] as they defeated [[Paris St Germain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.voetbalkrant.com/nieuws/2005-06-05/auxerre-pakt-franse-beker |title=Auxerre pakt Franse beker |website=voetbalkrant.com |accessdate=8 September 2019}}</ref> He also played as a substitute in the final as they won the tournament two years earlier in [[Coupe de France Final 2003|2003]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.europe1.fr/sport/psg-auxerre-cetait-deja-il-y-a-12-ans-1339522 |title=PSG-Auxerre, c'\u00e9tait d\u00e9j\u00e0 il y a 12 ans |website=europe1.fr |accessdate=8 September 2019}}</ref> On 5 January 2006, English [[Premier League]] club [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] signed him from Auxerre for [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]4.1&nbsp;million after [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] manager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] recommended the player to [[Harry Redknapp]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/p/portsmouth/4586280.stm \"Portsmouth sign striker Mwaruwari\"].

After Portsmouth's visit to Wigan on 20 October, Benjani became the Premier League's top scorer.\n\nPortsmouth boss [[Harry Redknapp]] banned Benjani from taking any further penalties after he missed a spot-kick in second-half injury time in a home game against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Harry blast for striker Benjani | work=teamtalk.com | date=28 October 2007 | url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/28102007/1/harry-blast-striker-benjani.html | accessdate=28 October 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> He then made amends for his miss scoring in the 4\u20131 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] to bring his total to eight for the season. He then scored his ninth of the season, albeit a consolation goal in a 4\u20131 defeat at [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. On 19 January 2008, Benjani earned his second Portsmouth hat-trick, scoring all of his side's goals in a 3\u20131 victory over [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] at [[Fratton Park]]. This took his tally for the season to 12 and subsequently resulted in him revising his target for the season, which had been 10.\n\nBenjani's goalscoring form during the first half of the 2007\u201308 season cemented [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] manager [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]]'s interest in the striker, and on 31 January 2008 he had a bid of around \u00a38&nbsp;million accepted for the transfer of the player. However, it was revealed that Benjani had missed two successive planes to Manchester (supposedly due to his reluctance to leave Portsmouth), meaning he did not arrive at the club's training ground until 11:10&nbsp;pm, leaving insufficient time to complete a move before the midnight deadline.<ref>{{cite news | title=Eriksson won't lose sleep over sealing Benjani deal | work=The Daily Mail | date=2 February 2008 | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_article_id=511985&in_page_id=1779 | accessdate=5 February 2008 | location=London}}</ref> Portsmouth had already confirmed the signing of Benjani's replacement, [[Jermain Defoe]], for a fee in the region of \u00a39&nbsp;million from [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], with the impending sale of Benjani supposedly funding the majority of the transfer.\n\n===Manchester City===\nA transfer was completed for Benjani to move to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 5 February 2008 for a fee of \u00a33.87&nbsp;million on a two-and-a-half-year deal.<ref name=\"Benjani completes Man City move\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/7221987.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Benjani completes Man City move|date=5 February 2008|accessdate=5 February 2008}}</ref> Further payments could be made if the player makes up to 75 senior starts which would raise the fee to a total of \u00a37.6&nbsp;million.

He scored the second goal from a header in his first [[Manchester derby]]. His first goal at the [[City of Manchester Stadium]] was against his former club Portsmouth on 20 April 2008, although Benjani refused to celebrate after the goal out of respect for his former club, stating in a post match interview that he would never celebrate a goal against Portsmouth because the club and its fans had been so good to him. His next goal came in the 3\u20132 home loss against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].\n\nAfter a lengthy thigh injury, Benjani made a goal scoring return for the reserves, before following this up days later by making an impact as a second half [[substitute (football)|substitute]], scoring what would be the winning goal in City's 3\u20132 win over [[FC Twente|Twente]]. He scored again in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] with an away goal against [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]].

It's hard to leave any team, but Portsmouth isn't just any team to me. I've never been anything but happy at Portsmouth. It's been a hard season for everyone at the club and these are hard times. For me the fans are the key to the club and everything that happens. So it's tough to see them going through a difficult time, for me. It's hard for the players, but I feel more for the fans than I do the rest of the team. But I have so much love for the fans, and I want them to know that. The injuries are fine and I feel good. If you don't play for a long time, like last season, it is always going to be difficult. As a player, though, you take it as it comes. It was a hard time for me last season and it was difficult, but that is life. At the moment, I don't know whether I'm going to play on.

He signed with [[Premier League]] club [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in 2006, then went on to play in England's top flight for [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] before returning to Portsmouth in 2011. The following year, he returned to South Africa with [[Chippa United]] and then Bidvest Wits.\n\nBenjani played a total 31 times for the [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe national team]] and was its captain for many of those matches. A member of the squad at the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]], he retired from international football in October 2010 to concentrate on his club career.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early career===\nBenjani began his career at Lulu Rovers, Highlanders FC Juniors, Zimba Africa Rivers, University of Zimbabwe teams in Zimbabwe's Division one and [[Air Zimbabwe Jets]] in the country's Premier League in 1999. He moved to South African club [[Jomo Cosmos Football Club|Jomo Cosmos]] in 1999 where he met his mentor [[Jomo Sono]], after impressing in the friendly match between [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]] that was played to commemorate the inauguration of [[Thabo Mbeki]] as the president of South Africa.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\nIn 2001, he was voted [[PSL Player of the Season]] and [[PSL Players' Player of the Season]] in South Africa.\n\n===Grasshopper and Auxerre===\nBenjani moved to Swiss club [[Grasshopper Club Z\u00fcrich|Grasshoppers]] on loan in 2001. In 2002, [[Guy Roux]] took him to [[AJ Auxerre|Auxerre]] of France. Benjani had a good run at the start, capitalising from [[Djibril Ciss\u00e9]]'s absence, becoming top goalscorer in [[Ligue 1]]. Roux never played the two together, and eventually Benjani found himself surplus to requirements under Roux's successor, [[Jacques Santini]], this time forced out of the 4\u20135\u20131 formation by [[Luigi Pieroni]].

After Portsmouth's visit to Wigan on 20 October, Benjani became the Premier League's top scorer.\n\nPortsmouth boss [[Harry Redknapp]] banned Benjani from taking any further penalties after he missed a spot-kick in second-half injury time in a home game against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Harry blast for striker Benjani | work=teamtalk.com | date=28 October 2007 | url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/28102007/1/harry-blast-striker-benjani.html | accessdate=28 October 2007}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> He then made amends for his miss scoring in the 4\u20131 victory over [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] to bring his total to eight for the season.

On 19 January 2008, Benjani earned his second Portsmouth hat-trick, scoring all of his side's goals in a 3\u20131 victory over [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] at [[Fratton Park]]. This took his tally for the season to 12 and subsequently resulted in him revising his target for the season, which had been 10.\n\nBenjani's goalscoring form during the first half of the 2007\u201308 season cemented [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] manager [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]]'s interest in the striker, and on 31 January 2008 he had a bid of around \u00a38&nbsp;million accepted for the transfer of the player. However, it was revealed that Benjani had missed two successive planes to Manchester (supposedly due to his reluctance to leave Portsmouth), meaning he did not arrive at the club's training ground until 11:10&nbsp;pm, leaving insufficient time to complete a move before the midnight deadline.<ref>{{cite news | title=Eriksson won't lose sleep over sealing Benjani deal | work=The Daily Mail | date=2 February 2008 | url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/sport/football.html?in_article_id=511985&in_page_id=1779 | accessdate=5 February 2008 | location=London}}</ref> Portsmouth had already confirmed the signing of Benjani's replacement, [[Jermain Defoe]], for a fee in the region of \u00a39&nbsp;million from [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], with the impending sale of Benjani supposedly funding the majority of the transfer.\n\n===Manchester City===\nA transfer was completed for Benjani to move to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 5 February 2008 for a fee of \u00a33.87&nbsp;million on a two-and-a-half-year deal.<ref name=\"Benjani completes Man City move\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_city/7221987.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|title=Benjani completes Man City move|date=5 February 2008|accessdate=5 February 2008}}</ref> Further payments could be made if the player makes up to 75 senior starts which would raise the fee to a total of \u00a37.6&nbsp;million.

He scored the second goal from a header in his first [[Manchester derby]]. His first goal at the [[City of Manchester Stadium]] was against his former club Portsmouth on 20 April 2008, although Benjani refused to celebrate after the goal out of respect for his former club, stating in a post match interview that he would never celebrate a goal against Portsmouth because the club and its fans had been so good to him. His next goal came in the 3\u20132 home loss against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]].\n\nAfter a lengthy thigh injury, Benjani made a goal scoring return for the reserves, before following this up days later by making an impact as a second half [[substitute (football)|substitute]], scoring what would be the winning goal in City's 3\u20132 win over [[FC Twente|Twente]].

It's hard to leave any team, but Portsmouth isn't just any team to me. I've never been anything but happy at Portsmouth. It's been a hard season for everyone at the club and these are hard times. For me the fans are the key to the club and everything that happens. So it's tough to see them going through a difficult time, for me. It's hard for the players, but I feel more for the fans than I do the rest of the team. But I have so much love for the fans, and I want them to know that. The injuries are fine and I feel good. If you don't play for a long time, like last season, it is always going to be difficult. As a player, though, you take it as it comes. It was a hard time for me last season and it was difficult, but that is life. At the moment, I don't know whether I'm going to play on.
