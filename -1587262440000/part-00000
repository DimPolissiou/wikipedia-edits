medical-missionary activities.]]\n\nFrom her earlier days in Gangtok, Scott used her position in Gangtok to begin a successful medical mission.<ref name=\":02\"/> While Gangtok had little medical infrastructure and the prior missionary of Sikkim Reverend Maclean had not given any attention to medical work, he had recommended that his successor be a medical missionary.<ref name=\":02\"/> Despite her lack of formal medical training, White devoted much of her efforts to medical efforts, at times caring for the sick inside her own home during the [[Visceral leishmaniasis]] epidemics.<ref

of a class of Western trained doctors and pharmacists in Sikim.<ref name=\":02\"/> While none of Scott's students moved beyond compounder status before Scott left in 1939 due to health issues from the altitude, several of her later students would go on to become allopathic medical professionals after her departure, with many of the students receiving substantial financial support from the state government due to Scott's prior actions convincing the Sikkimese elite of the value of medical education<ref name=\":02\"/> Her creation of a class of Western-trained doctors is considered a major reason medicine in Sikkim was not significantly affected by the [[Partition of India]],<ref name=\":02\"/> and Sikkim's success at converting a medical system based on foreign support into a fully

Scottish religious missionary.<ref name=\":1\" /> In her medical work in Kalimpong, Scott was known for being tolerant of non-Christians working and receiving education, and saw value in the Buddhist teachings of hard work and responsibility that aligned with her Presbyterian belief's.<ref name=\":32\"/>  The success of Scott's educational efforts led to her receiving permission to open a Christian church in Gangtok in 1936, a strong testament to White's reputation  given the strong opposition to Christian activities by the Chogyal and other political elites in Sikkim.<ref

minority is considered a major reason for the unique privileges she was given compared to prior and subsequent missionaries.<ref name=\":6\" /> While Scott's  successor as Scottish Mission in Gangtok, the Reverend Gavin Fairservice,  continued White's missionary efforts, he was not allowed to reside in Sikkim and his evangelizing was strictly monitored by the local government.<ref name=\":02\"/>

medical-missionary activities.]]\n\nFrom her earlier days in Gangtok, Scott used her position in Gangtok to begin a successful medical mission.<ref name=\":02\"/> While Gangtok had little medical infrastructure and the prior missionary of Sikkim Reverend Maclean had not given any attention to medical work, he had recommended that his successor be a medical missionary.<ref name=\":02\"/> Despite her lack of formal medical training, White devoted much of her efforts to medical efforts, at times caring for the sick inside her own home during the [[Visceral leishmaniasis]] epidemics.<ref name=\":32\"/> From the beginning, Scott ensured that the medical mission was primarily run by Sikkimese workers, which was unusual for medical Missions at the time, and helped accelerate the creation of a class of Western trained doctors and pharmacists in Sikim.<ref name=\":02\"/> While none of Scott's students moved beyond compounder status before Scott left in 1939 due to health issues from the altitude, several of her later students would go on to become allopathic medical professionals after her departure, with many of the students receiving substantial financial support from the state government due to Scott's prior actions convincing the Sikkimese elite of the value of medical education<ref name=\":02\"/> Her creation of a class of Western-trained doctors is considered a major reason medicine in Sikkim was not significantly affected by the [[Partition of India]],<ref name=\":02\"/> and Sikkim's success at converting a medical system based on foreign support into a fully functioning indigenous one has been cited as a positive example compared to other regions of modern-day India.<ref name=\":02\"/> Some of her students continued as doctors in Sikkim as late as 1995.<ref name=\":02\"/><ref name=\":02\" />\n\n== Christian missionary ==\nFrom the beginning of her time as a missionary, Scott worked to balance her educational and medical goals with her role as a Scottish religious missionary.<ref name=\":1\" /> In her medical work in Kalimpong, Scott was known for being tolerant of non-Christians working and receiving education, and saw value in the Buddhist teachings of hard work and responsibility that aligned with her Presbyterian belief's.<ref name=\":32\"/>  The success of Scott's educational efforts led to her receiving permission to open a Christian church in Gangtok in 1936, a strong testament to White's reputation  given the strong opposition to Christian activities by the Chogyal and other political elites in Sikkim.<ref

the Reverend Gavin Fairservice,  continued White's missionary efforts, he was not allowed to reside in Sikkim and his evangelizing was strictly monitored by the local government.<ref name=\":02\"/>
