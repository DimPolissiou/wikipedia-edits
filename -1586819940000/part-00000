A fourth concourse, known as Suite Level, provides access to the skyboxes and is restricted to patrons who have skybox admission.  All concourses provide a variety of concession stands.

The acoustical cloud is a set of 160 rotating acoustic panels suspended from the Moda Center ceiling, intended to recreate the roar of noise that made the old Memorial Coliseum one of the loudest buildings in the NBA.  One side of each 10&nbsp;feet&nbsp;by&nbsp;10&nbsp;feet (3&nbsp;m&nbsp;by&nbsp;3&nbsp;m) panel reflects sound, while the other side absorbs sound.  Each panel is shaped like an airplane wing, and is 8&nbsp;inches&nbsp;(20&nbsp;cm) thick at the center and 4&nbsp;inches&nbsp;(10&nbsp;cm) thick at the edges.  The effect during Blazers games is to absorb the noise from the upper levels and reflect it back down to the court.\n\nThe panels permit the acoustics of the arena to be adjusted according to the requirements of the event.  For smaller events in which only the lower bowl of the arena is used, the panels can be lowered to further improve the sound and increase the intimacy of the arena.

The effect during Blazers games is to absorb the noise from the upper levels and reflect it back down to the court.\n\nThe panels permit the acoustics of the arena to be adjusted according to the requirements of the event.

JD students are required to take 86 semester hours of credit in order to graduate. In the first year of law school all students are required to take one semester each of Contracts, Property, Torts, Civil Procedure, Constitutional Law, and Criminal Law.  Additionally, in fall of their first year all students are required to take  Legal Practice I and Legal Research Methodologies I, and in spring of their first year students are required to take Legal Practice II and Legal Research Methodologies II. For the entering class of 2016\u20132017 all first-year students took Civil Procedure in the spring; the rest of the first-year doctrinal courses were offered in both fall and spring. It remains to be seen if that scheduling practice will continue in the future. The second and third year offer more flexibility in planning the student's curriculum as there are only two mandatory classes (a class from the ethics curriculum and one seminar). In addition to their substantive coursework, many second and third-year students participate in moot court, a scholarly publication, a clinic, or an externship.\n\n===Joint Degree programs===\nFor students interested in a more general interdisciplinary course of study, the School of Law offers five joint degree programs (usually completed in four years, as opposed to three for a standard JD):\n:JD-[[Master of Business Administration|MBA]], with Washington University's [[Olin Business School]]\n:JD-[[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in East Asian Studies, with the [[Washington University School of Arts and Sciences]] \n:JD-[[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in Economics, with the [[Washington University School of Arts and Sciences]]\n:JD-[[Master of Health Administration|MHA]] in Health Administration, with the [[Washington University School of Medicine]]\n:JD-[[Master of Social Work|MSW]], with Washington University's [[George Warren Brown School of Social Work]]\n:JD-[[Master of Laws|LL.M]], with [[University of Queensland]]\n\n===[[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.) program===\nWashington University School of Law offers an LL.M. in U.S. Law for International Students, an LL.M. in Negotiation and Dispute Resolution, an LL.M. in Intellectual Property & Technology Law, and an LL.M. in Taxation.

After the clerk of the court assigns cases at the beginning of the semester, students handle all aspects of the appeal, including motions, filings, and briefs. The representation typically provides at least one student each semester an opportunity to argue a case before a panel of the Eighth Circuit.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Civil Justice===\nThe Civil Justice Clinic requires students to handle their own case load under the supervision of the faculty.  In utilizing the student body for representation, the Civil Justice Clinic assists in the provision of legal services to needy members of the community and imparts the obligation for public service. The Clinic also includes a weekly seminar.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Civil Rights and Community Justice===\nIn the Civil Rights and Community Justice Clinic, students work in the fields of immigration and employment discrimination.

Students participating in the  externship course observe hearings, trials and other court proceedings; perform legal research; and draft a series of legal memoranda relevant to cases under submission by the courts.\n\n==Student publications==\n\nThe Washington University School of Law has four student-run publications.  After the completion of their first year, students are encouraged to participate in a \"write-on\" competition.  This competition has generally entailed writing a case comment.  Based upon the quality of a student's case comment, a student may be invited to join the publication of their choice.<br />  Second-year students participating in one of the three Washington University School of Law student-run publications are considered \"associate\" or \"staff\" editors.  In addition to their editing responsibilities (which generally consist of \"shelf-checks\"), these students are required to write a \"note.\"  Based upon the quality of their writing, students may be asked to publish their note in the publication in which they belong.  Rising third-year law students are encouraged to apply for an editorial position within their publication.  These board positions range from lower-level editing positions to the editor-in-chief position.  \n\n* ''[[Washington University Law Review]]'' began as the ''St. Louis Law Review'' in 1915 and was re-titled the ''Washington University Law Quarterly'' in 1936. The ''Law Review'' is a student-run academic journal that publishes six issues per year.  The staff selects and edits articles from legal scholars, practitioners, and students, and welcomes submissions on any legal topic. In addition to the printed publications, ''Law Review'' maintains an online supplement entitled Slip Opinions featuring original commentary and debate by members of the legal academy, bench, and bar.\n\n* '''''Washington University Journal of Law and Policy''''' originated in 1968 as the ''Urban Law Annual'' and focused entirely on issues surrounding [[land use]], [[urban development]], and other legal concerns of urban communities. The scope broadened in 1983 when the ''Journal'' expanded (and became the ''Journal of Urban and Contemporary Law'') to encompass a broad range of topics. In 1999, the ''Journal'' once again broadened its scope to become the ''Washington University Journal of Law and Policy''. The ''Journal'' generates a [[symposium]]-based publication that brings together communities of scholars, to emphasize existing and emerging visions of the law in relation to interdisciplinary and [[multicultural]] perspectives, the implications of [[technology]], and the consequences of [[economic globalization]] for the purpose of influencing law and social policy. Each year, the Journal publishes an \"Access to Justice\" volume. This volume is a compilation of essays from the Washington University School of Law\u2019s \"Access to Justice\" speaker series, one goal of which is to encourage and challenge audiences to use their legal education for the ultimate betterment of our society. Additionally, the Journal collaborates with faculty members to publish symposia along a broad spectrum of contemporary topics.\n\n* '''''Washington University Global Studies Law Review''''' is a student-edited international legal journal dedicated to publishing articles by international, foreign, and [[comparative law]] scholars. ''Global'' publishes quarterly. ''Global's'' publications present articles, book reviews, essays, and notes from academics, practitioners, and students, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Washington University Global Studies Law Review {{!}} Law School {{!}} Washington University in St. Louis|url = http://law.wustl.edu/wugslr/index.asp?ID=3837|website = law.WUStL.edu|access-date = June 7, 2015}}</ref> ''Global'' occasionally publishes articles in conjunction with symposia from the [[Whitney Robson Harris|Whitney R.

The purpose of the Review is to promote academic discussion and scholarship at the nexus between law and philosophy.  It also seeks to broaden and deepen the law school experience by fostering critical analysis of the suppositions and theories that underlie the law school curriculum.

A majority of these organizations represent a local chapter of a larger national organization. In addition to the organizations which represent as national chapter, Washington University School of Law has several student organizations that are unique to the Law School; \n* American Constitution Society (ACS)\n* American Indian Law Students Association (AILSA)\n* Barely Legal Theater (a student-run organization where students write and perform skits or songs that poke fun at law school life)\n* The Federalist Society \n* Sidebar Wine Society\n* Graduate-Professional Council (selected students represent the school of law in University matters)\n* Honor Council (charged with enforcing the Honor Code)\n* Illinois Student Bar Association (ISBA)\n* Intellectual Property Law Society (IPLS)\n* Joint Degree Law Society (for students who are pursuing more than one graduate degree)\n* OUTLaw (for LGBTQ* students and allies)\n* Second Career Law Students (SCaLeS)\n* Wash U Out West (WOW)\n\n==Campus==\n[[File:WashUABhall.jpg|thumb|Anheuser Busch Hall]]\nIn January 1997, Washington University School of Law moved into Anheuser-Busch Hall. Anheuser-Busch Hall architecturally mirrors the classic style of the Washington University [[Danforth Campus]]. Anheuser-Busch Hall includes two fully functional courtrooms; numerous classrooms; and an open-stacks Law Library. Additionally, AB Hall includes common areas, such as the W.L. Hadley Griffin Student Commons and the glass-domed Crowder Courtyard.  In AB Hall all classrooms, seminar rooms, and breakout rooms have both computing and multimedia capabilities. Each classroom and seminar room is also equipped with a multimedia projection system. This allows instructors to video-tape classes and post the lectures online.\n\nConstruction of a new Social Sciences and Law Building has been finished.  The new building is situated just southwest of Anheuser-Busch Hall. Ground was broken for the four-story, [[Collegiate Gothic]] building on September 5, 2006; the targeted date for completion was June 30, 2008.  About {{convert|15000|sqft|m2}} of the new building\u2019s 142,000 net square feet were earmarked for the law school, housing some administrative offices, law journal offices, and classrooms.\n\n== Employment ==\nAccording to WashU Law's official 2018 ABA-required disclosures, 87.1% of 2018 graduates had secured full-time, long-term, JD-required employment within nine months of graduation.

JD students are required to take 86 semester hours of credit in order to graduate. In the first year of law school all students are required to take one semester each of Contracts, Property, Torts, Civil Procedure, Constitutional Law, and Criminal Law.  Additionally, in fall of their first year all students are required to take  Legal Practice I and Legal Research Methodologies I, and in spring of their first year students are required to take Legal Practice II and Legal Research Methodologies II. For the entering class of 2016\u20132017 all first-year students took Civil Procedure in the spring; the rest of the first-year doctrinal courses were offered in both fall and spring. It remains to be seen if that scheduling practice will continue in the future. The second and third year offer more flexibility in planning the student's curriculum as there are only two mandatory classes (a class from the ethics curriculum and one seminar). In addition to their substantive coursework, many second and third-year students participate in moot court, a scholarly publication, a clinic, or an externship.\n\n===Joint Degree programs===\nFor students interested in a more general interdisciplinary course of study, the School of Law offers five joint degree programs (usually completed in four years, as opposed to three for a standard JD):\n:JD-[[Master of Business Administration|MBA]], with Washington University's [[Olin Business School]]\n:JD-[[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in East Asian Studies, with the [[Washington University School of Arts and Sciences]] \n:JD-[[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in Economics, with the [[Washington University School of Arts and Sciences]]\n:JD-[[Master of Health Administration|MHA]] in Health Administration, with the [[Washington University School of Medicine]]\n:JD-[[Master of Social Work|MSW]], with Washington University's [[George Warren Brown School of Social Work]]\n:JD-[[Master of Laws|LL.M]], with [[University of Queensland]]\n\n===[[Master of Laws]] (LL.M.) program===\nWashington University School of Law offers an LL.M. in U.S. Law for International Students, an LL.M. in Negotiation and Dispute Resolution, an LL.M. in Intellectual Property & Technology Law, and an LL.M. in Taxation.

The Clinic also includes a weekly seminar.{{cn|date=July 2017}}\n\n===Civil Rights and Community Justice===\nIn the Civil Rights and Community Justice Clinic, students work in the fields of immigration and employment discrimination.

Students engage in interviewing, counseling, case analysis and planning, problem solving, fact investigation, document drafting, negotiation, mediation, and community education. In addition to law office practice, the Civil Rights and Community Justice Clinic includes an in-house component in which students observe and conduct mediations, assist in at least one legislative drafting experience, and participate in at least one civil rights community education project of the student's choosing.  The Civil Rights and Community Justice Clinic became involved in larger scale community lawyering by assisting on the lawsuit opposing the anti-immigrant ordinances in [[Valley Park, Missouri]].\n\n===Criminal Justice===\nThe Criminal Justice Clinic operates in collaboration with the St. Louis County office of the Missouri State Public Defender System, located approximately one mile from the law school in the St. Louis County Justice Center. The Criminal Justice Clinic exposes students to real life lawyering skills within the framework of the state level criminal justice system. Clinic students have the opportunity to serve as Rule 13 certified legal interns, and perform the work of a lawyer, representing clients facing criminal charges.\n\n===Congressional and Administrative Law===\nIn this clinic, approximately 24 third-year law students spend their spring semester in [[Washington D.C.]] and work under the direction of attorneys in a variety of government offices.  Examples include the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House]] and [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]], the Civil Rights Division of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]], the Corporate Finance Section of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]].\n\nAs prerequisite to taking this course, students participating in the Congressional and Administrative Law Clinic are required to enroll a course on [[ethics]] in government in addition to their daily work at the [[internship]]. \n\n===Government Lawyering===\nThe Government Lawyering Clinic provides the opportunity for students to work with attorneys in the Criminal or Civil Division of the United States Attorney\u2019s Office.<br />Students in this Clinic work in the Eastern District of Missouri office in St. Louis or the Southern District of [[Illinois]] office in [[East St. Louis]].

Students work as part-time law clerks under the supervision of local, state or federal trial or appellate judges. Students participating in the  externship course observe hearings, trials and other court proceedings; perform legal research; and draft a series of legal memoranda relevant to cases under submission by the courts.\n\n==Student publications==\n\nThe Washington University School of Law has four student-run publications.  After the completion of their first year, students are encouraged to participate in a \"write-on\" competition.  This competition has generally entailed writing a case comment.  Based upon the quality of a student's case comment, a student may be invited to join the publication of their choice.<br />  Second-year students participating in one of the three Washington University School of Law student-run publications are considered \"associate\" or \"staff\" editors.  In addition to their editing responsibilities (which generally consist of \"shelf-checks\"), these students are required to write a \"note.\"  Based upon the quality of their writing, students may be asked to publish their note in the publication in which they belong.  Rising third-year law students are encouraged to apply for an editorial position within their publication.  These board positions range from lower-level editing positions to the editor-in-chief position.  \n\n* ''[[Washington University Law Review]]'' began as the ''St. Louis Law Review'' in 1915 and was re-titled the ''Washington University Law Quarterly'' in 1936. The ''Law Review'' is a student-run academic journal that publishes six issues per year.  The staff selects and edits articles from legal scholars, practitioners, and students, and welcomes submissions on any legal topic. In addition to the printed publications, ''Law Review'' maintains an online supplement entitled Slip Opinions featuring original commentary and debate by members of the legal academy, bench, and bar.\n\n* '''''Washington University Journal of Law and Policy''''' originated in 1968 as the ''Urban Law Annual'' and focused entirely on issues surrounding [[land use]], [[urban development]], and other legal concerns of urban communities. The scope broadened in 1983 when the ''Journal'' expanded (and became the ''Journal of Urban and Contemporary Law'') to encompass a broad range of topics. In 1999, the ''Journal'' once again broadened its scope to become the ''Washington University Journal of Law and Policy''. The ''Journal'' generates a [[symposium]]-based publication that brings together communities of scholars, to emphasize existing and emerging visions of the law in relation to interdisciplinary and [[multicultural]] perspectives, the implications of [[technology]], and the consequences of [[economic globalization]] for the purpose of influencing law and social policy. Each year, the Journal publishes an \"Access to Justice\" volume. This volume is a compilation of essays from the Washington University School of Law\u2019s \"Access to Justice\" speaker series, one goal of which is to encourage and challenge audiences to use their legal education for the ultimate betterment of our society. Additionally, the Journal collaborates with faculty members to publish symposia along a broad spectrum of contemporary topics.\n\n* '''''Washington University Global Studies Law Review''''' is a student-edited international legal journal dedicated to publishing articles by international, foreign, and [[comparative law]] scholars. ''Global'' publishes quarterly. ''Global's'' publications present articles, book reviews, essays, and notes from academics, practitioners, and students, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Washington University Global Studies Law Review {{!}} Law School {{!}} Washington University in St. Louis|url = http://law.wustl.edu/wugslr/index.asp?ID=3837|website = law.WUStL.edu|access-date = June 7, 2015}}</ref> ''Global'' occasionally publishes articles in conjunction with symposia from the [[Whitney Robson Harris|Whitney R.

The purpose of the Review is to promote academic discussion and scholarship at the nexus between law and philosophy.  It also seeks to broaden and deepen the law school experience by fostering critical analysis of the suppositions and theories that underlie the law school curriculum.  To further these purposes, the Review publishes scholar- and practitioner-authored articles, as well as  student-authored notes.\n\n==Student organizations==\nThe Washington University School of Law has an always evolving variety of student organizations.  A majority of these organizations represent a local chapter of a larger national organization.

Anheuser-Busch Hall architecturally mirrors the classic style of the Washington University [[Danforth Campus]]. Anheuser-Busch Hall includes two fully functional courtrooms; numerous classrooms; and an open-stacks Law Library. Additionally, AB Hall includes common areas, such as the W.L. Hadley Griffin Student Commons and the glass-domed Crowder Courtyard.  In AB Hall all classrooms, seminar rooms, and breakout rooms have both computing and multimedia capabilities. Each classroom and seminar room is also equipped with a multimedia projection system. This allows instructors to video-tape classes and post the lectures online.\n\nConstruction of a new Social Sciences and Law Building has been finished.  The new building is situated just southwest of Anheuser-Busch Hall. Ground was broken for the four-story, [[Collegiate Gothic]] building on September 5, 2006; the targeted date for completion was June 30, 2008.

There Prince Henry was knighted with a spur held by the [[Earl of Mar]] and crowned as a duke by his father. He was given the titles [[Prince of Scotland|Great Steward of Scotland]], [[Duke of Rothesay]], [[Earl of Carrick]], [[Lord of the Isles]], and [[Baron of Renfrew (title)|Baron of Renfrew]].\n[[File:CMSJ IMG 0428 (640x480) (3870360864).jpg|thumb|right|The name of the prince, \"Henry Frederick\" was announced from a window of the '''Great Hall''']]\nAfter this several Scottish men were made knights in the queen's outer hall. The names of the newly-made knights were proclaimed from the terrace at the forefront of the palace with sound of trumpets, and gold and other coins were cast amongst the people in the garden below as largesse.<ref>Thomas Rymer, ''Foedera'', vol. 16 (London, 1715), p. 263: ''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 412: William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref> Next, Anne of Denmark received the gifts that the ambassadors had brought. The ambassadors were then escorted back to their lodgings until supper time.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 412.</ref>\n\n===Feast and masque===\n[[File:Interior Great Hall.JPG|thumb|right|Neptune's ship was presented in a masque in the Great Hall of Stirling Castle]]\nAt the supper or feast that evening at 8 o'clock, the first course was served by the new-made knights.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 412: Thomas Thomson, ''History of the Kirk of Scotland by Mr David Calderwood'', vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), p. 345.</ref> For the second course, a table laden with desserts of [[p\u00e2tisserie]], fruit, and sugar confectionaries was drawn up the length of the Great Hall with six maidens, presumably ladies-in-waiting to Anne of Denmark, either sitting on the table or standing beside it, in masque costumes with garlands on their heads, and feathers, pearls, and jewels in their hair, representing fecundity and fertility. William Fowler called this a \"silent comedy\" and explained that it had been intended a real lion should haul this tableau, but on consideration this might be too frightening for the guests, or the lion might be startled with unfortunate results. Instead an African man, who Fowler called \"the Moore\", gave the appearance of dragging the scene along with golden chains, although in reality it was moved by \"secret convoy\", hidden ropes and mechanism.<ref>William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref> The role may have represented [[Gawain]], as he appears in the ''[[Knight of the Cart]]'' substituted for \"[[Ywain]]\" in ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]''. The exact reference intended is unclear in the evidence.\n\nThe African actor may have performed in 1590 at [[Entry and Coronation of Anne of Denmark|Anne of Denmark's Entry into Edinburgh]]. The queen also had an African servant in her household listed as \"the Moir\" in 1590, who was bought clothes with her pages, but there is no further record of this man.<ref>[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14629712.2019.1626110 Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', ''The Court Historian'', 24:2 (2019) p. 144.]</ref>\n\nAfter this tableau was removed, a large model ship was brought into the Great Hall, or uncovered there. This was to evoke to the King's journey to Norway and Denmark in 1589 to meet Anne of Denmark, in the manner of [[Jason|Jason and the Argonauts]], as if [[Neptune]], the pilot of the ship, had made their marriage, despite the \"conspiracies of witches\". The fore-sail was painted with a compass and the North Star, the main sail with the arms of Scotland and Denmark. Thetis and Triton were also onboard, with six sailors wearing shot-silk, and fourteen musicians dressed in Stewart red and yellow. The ship was accompanied by three women dressed as mermaids or [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]], as [[Parthenope (Siren)|Parthenope]], Ligeia, and Leucosia, who sang and mimed in time to the music. There were thirty six working brass cannons.<ref>William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref>\n\nThe ship was laden with all kinds of fish made from sugar, including herring, whiting, flounders, oysters, whelks, crabs and clams, served in Venetian glasses tinted with azure, which were distributed while [[Arion]] seated on a dolphin played his harp. Some Latin verses in praise of Anne were sung, followed by [[Psalm 128]] in canon with musical accompaniment.<ref>Thomas Thomson, ''History of the Kirk of Scotland by Mr David Calderwood'', vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), p. 345, \"there was sung the 128th Psalm with diverse voices and tunes, and musical instruments playing\".</ref> Triton blew his trumpet and Neptune whistled, and then the ship sailed away, firing the rest of its guns. The ship model was kept at Stirling Castle for many years. Fowler's book gives the dimensions:<blockquote>\"Presently after the returning of the Chariot, entered a most sumpteous, artificiall, and well proportioned ship, the length of her keele, was 18. foot, and her bredth 8. foote: from her bottome to her highest flagge, was 40. foot: the Sea shee stoode vpon, was 24. foot long, with bredth convenient: her motion was so artificially devised within her self, that none could perceive what brought her in.\"<ref>William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref></blockquote>\n\nJames and Anne and the ambassadors went into a room in the Palace, hung with recently repaired tapestry, where there was another sugar banquet. Sugar confections and sculptures were made for the court by Jacques de Boussy, a French or Flemish specialist.<ref>Michael Pearce, 'Riddle's Court, Banquet & Diplomacy in 1598', ''History Scotland'' 12:4 (2012), pp. 20-7: [[Marguerite Wood]], ''Extracts from the Records of the Burgh of Edinburgh, 1589-1603'' (Edinburgh, 1927), p. 362.</ref> Meanwhile, the Great Hall was cleared for revels, which Fowler did not describe further. The event ended at 3 o'clock in the morning. Over the next few days James gave gifts to the ambassadors.\n\nIn 1610 the masque ''[[Tethys' Festival]]'' at the investiture of Prince Henry as [[Prince of Wales]] also had a maritime theme, Anne of Denmark played a sea goddess [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] in [[Milford Haven]] harbour, while her ladies-in-waiting personified rivers. The banquet at the King James's baptism in December 1566 at Stirling Castle had also involved food on moving stages, with dancing choreographed by [[Bastian Pagez]].\n\n==Ambassadors and diplomatic gift-giving==\n[[File:Anne of Denmark, ca 1600.jpg|thumb|right|'''Anne of Denmark''' accepted gifts from the ambassadors in a ceremony held in her audience chamber in the palace.]]\n[[Robert Radclyffe, 5th Earl of Sussex]] was the ambassador from England.

Anne however was forced to stay in Norway by accidents and bad weather, the circumstances which gave rise to Fowler mentioning thanksgiving for deliverance from witchcraft. The ambassador's masque would have comprised; six dancers wearing swords or [[falchion]]s with helmets dressed with feather plumes, presumably representing classical warriors; six masked torch bearers with hats with feathers, their costumes party-coloured in the Stewart colours red and yellow; four speaking parts wearing wigs and flower chaplets.

He said two of the Scottish envoys sent with invitations were unsuitable. Sir [[William Keith of Delny]] could not speak French, Latin, or Flemish, and the [[James Colville, 1st Lord Colville of Culross|laird of Easter Wemyss]] was chosen only because he happened to be travelling to London and Paris on his own business. Melville states that [[Peter Young (tutor)|Peter Young]] went to Denmark, Brunswick, and Mecklenberg, and was rewarded with gifts of three gold chains, but the dukes felt they would have been better honoured by a separate ambassador to each of them. Easter Wemyss received no rewards, because he was a messenger and did not have the status of an ambassador.

The Chapel Royal was purpose-built in 1594 under the direction of William Schaw, who was [[Master of Work to the Crown of Scotland|Master of Work]] to the king and the queen, and an administrator of the queen's landed income. The building has an central triumphal arch as an entrance, flanked by Italianate windows, and can be described as the first Renaissance style church in Britain.<ref>Ian Campbell and Aonghus MacKechnie, 'The 'Great Temple of Solomon' at Stirling Castle', ''Architectural History'', vol. 54 (2011), pp. 91, 103.</ref> The north fa\u00e7ade is featureless.

Modern historians continue to debate these themes, and also with a focus on the role of Anne, or Anna of Denmark as an agent in these events, or debate the role of the African actor, and the costumed performances.

William Fowler called this a \"silent comedy\" and explained that it had been intended a real lion should haul this tableau, but on consideration this might be too frightening for the guests, or the lion might be startled with unfortunate results. Instead an African man, who Fowler called \"the Moore\", gave the appearance of dragging the scene along with golden chains, although in reality it was moved by \"secret convoy\", hidden ropes and mechanism.<ref>William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref> The role may have represented [[Gawain]], as he appears in the ''[[Knight of the Cart]]'' substituted for \"[[Ywain]]\" in ''[[Yvain, the Knight of the Lion]]''. The exact reference intended is unclear in the evidence.\n\nThe African actor may have performed in 1590 at [[Entry and Coronation of Anne of Denmark|Anne of Denmark's Entry into Edinburgh]]. The queen also had an African servant in her household listed as \"the Moir\" in 1590, who was bought clothes with her pages, but there is no further record of this man.<ref>[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14629712.2019.1626110 Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', ''The Court Historian'', 24:2 (2019) p. 144.]</ref>\n\nAfter this tableau was removed, a large model ship was brought into the Great Hall, or uncovered there. This was to evoke to the King's journey to Norway and Denmark in 1589 to meet Anne of Denmark, in the manner of [[Jason|Jason and the Argonauts]], as if [[Neptune]], the pilot of the ship, had made their marriage, despite the \"conspiracies of witches\". The fore-sail was painted with a compass and the North Star, the main sail with the arms of Scotland and Denmark. Thetis and Triton were also onboard, with six sailors wearing shot-silk, and fourteen musicians dressed in Stewart red and yellow. The ship was accompanied by three women dressed as mermaids or [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]], as [[Parthenope (Siren)|Parthenope]], Ligeia, and Leucosia, who sang and mimed in time to the music. There were thirty six working brass cannons.<ref>William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref>\n\nThe ship was laden with all kinds of fish made from sugar, including herring, whiting, flounders, oysters, whelks, crabs and clams, served in Venetian glasses tinted with azure, which were distributed while [[Arion]] seated on a dolphin played his harp. Some Latin verses in praise of Anne were sung, followed by [[Psalm 128]] in canon with musical accompaniment.<ref>Thomas Thomson, ''History of the Kirk of Scotland by Mr David Calderwood'', vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), p. 345, \"there was sung the 128th Psalm with diverse voices and tunes, and musical instruments playing\".</ref> Triton blew his trumpet and Neptune whistled, and then the ship sailed away, firing the rest of its guns. The ship model was kept at Stirling Castle for many years. Fowler's book gives the dimensions:<blockquote>\"Presently after the returning of the Chariot, entered a most sumpteous, artificiall, and well proportioned ship, the length of her keele, was 18. foot, and her bredth 8. foote: from her bottome to her highest flagge, was 40. foot: the Sea shee stoode vpon, was 24. foot long, with bredth convenient: her motion was so artificially devised within her self, that none could perceive what brought her in.\"<ref>William Fowler, ''A True Reportarie'' (Edinburgh, 1594).</ref></blockquote>\n\nJames and Anne and the ambassadors went into a room in the Palace, hung with recently repaired tapestry, where there was another sugar banquet.

The event ended at 3 o'clock in the morning. Over the next few days James gave gifts to the ambassadors.\n\nIn 1610 the masque ''[[Tethys' Festival]]'' at the investiture of Prince Henry as [[Prince of Wales]] also had a maritime theme, Anne of Denmark played a sea goddess [[Tethys (mythology)|Tethys]] in [[Milford Haven]] harbour, while her ladies-in-waiting personified rivers.

Anne however was forced to stay in Norway by accidents and bad weather, the circumstances which gave rise to Fowler mentioning thanksgiving for deliverance from witchcraft. The ambassador's masque would have comprised; six dancers wearing swords or [[falchion]]s with helmets dressed with feather plumes, presumably representing classical warriors; six masked torch bearers with hats with feathers, their costumes party-coloured in the Stewart colours red and yellow; four speaking parts wearing wigs and flower chaplets. Only the account for making the costumes is known, and the subject of the masque was not recorded.<ref>Henry Morley, ''Masques and Entertainments by Ben Jonson'' (London, 1890), pp. xii-xiii: James Robinson Planche, ''A Cyclopedia Of Costume'', vol. 2 (London, 1879), p. 394: John Payne Collier, ''Annals of the Stage'', vol. 1 (London, 1831), pp. 270-1, citing British Library Lansdowne MS 59.</ref> At the same time, James VI had sent [[Roger Aston]] to [[Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton|Lord Scrope]] at Carlisle for actors from the [[Queen Elizabeth's Men|Queen's Players]] who were at [[Knowsley Hall]] to perform in Edinburgh.

He said two of the Scottish envoys sent with invitations were unsuitable. Sir [[William Keith of Delny]] could not speak French, Latin, or Flemish, and the [[James Colville, 1st Lord Colville of Culross|laird of Easter Wemyss]] was chosen only because he happened to be travelling to London and Paris on his own business. Melville states that [[Peter Young (tutor)|Peter Young]] went to Denmark, Brunswick, and Mecklenberg, and was rewarded with gifts of three gold chains, but the dukes felt they would have been better honoured by a separate ambassador to each of them. Easter Wemyss received no rewards, because he was a messenger and did not have the status of an ambassador. Melville claimed that Elizabeth was more enthusiastic to be represented at the event when she learnt that [[Henry IV of France]] was not sending an ambassador.<ref>Thomas Thomson, ''Memoirs of his own life by Sir James Melville of Halhill'' (Edinburgh, 1827), p. 411.</ref>\n\nThe Danish ambassadors and the ambassadors from the two German dukes had arrived in Leith on 11 and 12 July.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 376.</ref> Melville was appointed to greet them, but he could not persuade them to ride up to [[Holyrood Palace]] together in the same convoy and instead had to organise two processions.

Modern historians continue to debate these themes, and also with a focus on the role of Anne, or Anna of Denmark as an agent in these events, or debate the role of the African actor, and the costumed performances.

Discovered in 2014 by the [[Kepler (spacecraft)|Kepler Space Telescope]], Kepler-277b is a sub-Neptune sized [[exoplanet]] with a very high mass and density for an object of its radius, suggesting a composition made mainly of rock and iron. Along with its sister planet, [[Kepler-277c]], the planet's mass was determined using [[Transit-timing variation|transit-timing variations (TTVs)]].\n\n== Characteristics ==\n=== Size and temperature ===\nKepler-277b was detected using the transit method and TTVs, allowing for both its mass and radius to be determined to some level. It is approximately 2.92 {{Earth_radius}}, between the size of [[Earth]] and [[Neptune]]. At that radius, most planets should be gaseous [[Mini-Neptune|Mini-Neptunes]] with no solid surface. However, the mass of Kepler-277b is extremely high for its size. Transit-timing variations indicate a planetary mass of about 87.3 {{Earth_mass}}<ref name=NasaExoplanetArchive/>, comparable to Saturn's mass at 95.16 {{Earth_mass}}. The planet has a density of approximately 19.3 g/cm<sup>3</sup> and about 10.4 times the surface gravity of Earth. Such a high density for an object of this size implies that, like its sister planet, Kepler-277b is an enormous rock-based planet<ref name=\"Xie2014\"/>. It is currently the second most massive and third largest terrestrial planet ever discovered, behind Kepler-277c in radius<ref>https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/DisplayOverview/nph-DisplayOverview?objname=Kepler-277+c&type=CONFIRMED_PLANET</ref> and [[PSR J1719\u22121438 b]] in both radius and mass<ref>http://www.manchester.ac.uk/discover/news/a-planet-made-of-diamond/</ref>.

The core predominantly consists of an [[allotropes of iron|allotrope of iron]] with a [[face-centered cubic]] (FCC) [[crystalline structure]]. At the innermost region of Kepler-277b's core where pressures reach as high as 37.52 [[pascal (unit)|terapascal]]s, iron exists in a [[Tetragonal crystal system|body-centered-tetragonal]] (BCT) and [[body-centered cubic]] (BCC) crystalline structure.<ref name=\"Futo2020\">{{cite conference|title=Kepler-277 b: A Supermassive Terrestrial Exoplanet in the Kepler-277 Planetary System|url=https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2020/pdf/1055.pdf|first1=P.|last1=Fut\u00f3|display-authors=etal|conference=51st Lunar and Planetary Science Conference|publisher=Lunar and Planetary Institute|date=March 2020|bibcode=2020LPI....51.1055F}}</ref>\n\nKepler-277b has a relatively thin [[silicate]] [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] in comparison to its core.
