{"title_page": "List of cities in China by population", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\nChina is the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|world's most populous country]]. According to the Demographic research group in 2017, there are 102 Chinese cities with over 1 million people in the \"urban area\", as defined by the group's methodology.<ref name=\"demographia\">{{cite news|title=More than 100 Chinese cities now above 1 million people|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/mar/20/china-100-cities-populations-bigger-liverpool|publisher=Guardian|date=March 20, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Definition and classification==\nAccording to the [[administrative divisions of China]], there are three levels of cities, namely [[Direct-controlled municipality of China|municipalities]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u76f4\u8f96\u5e02}}), [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u5730\u7ea7\u5e02}}), and [[county-level cities]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u53bf\u7ea7\u5e02}}). The [[Special administrative regions of China|Special Administrative Regions (S.A.R.s)]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] and the [[Free area of the Republic of China|areas controlled]] by the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] are not included in this administrative classification.\n\nMunicipalities and prefecture-level cities are not each a \"city\" in the strictest sense of the term, but instead an administrative unit comprising, typically, both an urban core (''a city in the strict sense'') and surrounding [[rural]] or less-urbanized areas usually many times the size of the central, built-up core.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=L.|last2=Zhao|first2=Simon X.

To distinguish a prefecture-level city from its actual urban area (''city in the strict sense''), the term \"{{lang|zh-hans|\u5e02\u533a}}\" (''sh\u00ecq\u016b''; \"urban area\") is used. However, even this term often encompasses large suburban regions often greater than {{convert|1000|sqmi|km2|-3}}, sometimes only the urban core whereas the agglomeration overtake the city limits. Thus, the \"urban core\" would be roughly comparable to the American term \"city limit\", the \"sh\u00ecq\u016b or urban area\" would be roughly comparable to \"metropolitan area\", and the municipality is a political designation defining regions under control of a municipal government, which has no comparable designation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n== List of cities by

It is categorized as a Latin-suited deck and has strong similarities with the [[Italian playing cards|Italian-suited deck]] and less to the [[French playing cards|French deck]]. Spanish-suited cards are used in Spain, southern Italy, parts of France, [[Hispanic America]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Philippines]].<ref>[http://www.altacarta.com/languages/tagalog-cuajo.html Cuajo Filipino (Kuwaho)] at Alta Carta.

The Spanish word ''naipes'' is loaned from  ''n\u0101'ib'', ranks of [[face cards]] found in the Mamluk deck.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mayer|first=Leo Ary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8s4UAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA6&lpg=PA6&dq=mamluk+playing+cards+%22na+ib%22&source=bl&ots=wiWITAe4aD&sig=ACfU3U3j4ZmIRQXRKdyO586cFe0lKrCSEg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiswfnyvf_nAhUuUt8KHdKbDfcQ6AEwBHoECGQQAQ#v=onepage&q=mamluk%20playing%20cards%20%22na%20ib%22&f=false|title=Mamluk Playing Cards|publisher=Brill Archive|year=1971|isbn=|location=|pages=4-6|language=en|issn=0169-8826}}</ref> The earliest record of ''naip'' comes from a Catalan rhyming dictionary by [[Jaume March II]] in 1371, but without any context or definition. By 1380, ''naipero'' (card-maker) was a recognized profession. In December 1382, card games were banned from being played in [[Barcelona]]'s [[corn exchange]]. [[Valencia]]'s town council issued a blanket ban on ''un novell joch apellat dels naips'' (a new game called cards) in 1384.<ref name=\"Denning\">{{cite book|last1=Denning|first1=Trevor|title=The Playing-Cards of Spain|date=1996|publisher=Cygnus Arts|location=London|pages=14-23}}</ref> \n\n\"Moorish-styled\" cards were once produced in Catalonia during the late 14th or early 15th century.<ref>Wintle, Simon. [http://www.wopc.co.uk/spain/moorish/index Moorish playing cards] at the World of Playing Cards. Retrieved 11 October 2016.</ref> Unlike modern Spanish decks, there was a rank consisting of 10 pips suggesting that the earliest Spanish packs consisted of 52 cards. The removal of one rank shortened the deck to 48 which made card production simpler: a whole deck could be made with just two uncut sheets. 48-card decks have nine ranks of [[pip cards]] (1-9) and three ranks of face cards (10-12). Since the mid-20th century, they have usually been sold with two [[Joker (playing card)|jokers]], for a total of 50 cards. [[Stripped deck]]s have 40 cards, lacking ranks 8 and 9 and jokers. The popularity of the stripped deck is due to game of [[Ombre]], which became a craze throughout Europe during the 17th century.\n\n[[File:Spanish deck printed in Valencia, in 1778.jpg|thumb|right|Valencia pattern cards from 1778. They are closely related to the Old Catalan pattern.]]\nThe Spanish suits closely resemble [[Italian playing cards|Italian-suited cards]] as both were derived from the Arab cards. The four suits are ''bastos'' (clubs), ''oros'' (literally \"golds\", that is, golden coins), ''copas'' (cups) and ''espadas'' (swords). Unlike the suits found in northern Italy, Spanish swords are straight and the clubs resemble knobbly cudgels instead of ceremonial batons. Swords and clubs also do not intersect (except in the 3 of clubs card).<ref name=\"Dummett\">{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Game of Tarot|date=1980|publisher=Duckworth|location=London|pages=10\u201332}}</ref> Two surviving early decks did have intersecting clubs and swords like in Italian or Arab cards. The Spanish may have separated the pips in the 15th century to make them more easily distinguishable (some export cards kept the intersecting pips, see \"Extinct Portuguese pattern\" below).<ref name=\"Denning\" /> Each card has an outline frame to distinguish the suit without showing all of your cards: The cups have one interruption, the swords two, the clubs three, and the gold none. This mark is called \"''la pinta''\" and gave rise to the expression: ''le conoc\u00ed por la pinta'' (\"I knew him by his markings\"). ''La pinta'' first appeared around the mid-17th century. Like the Italian-suited [[tarot]], the deck is used for both game playing and [[cartomancy]]. The Spanish deck has been widely considered to be part of the occult in many Latin American countries, yet they continue to be used widely for card games and gambling, especially in Spain.\n\nThe three face cards of each suit have pictures similar to the jack, queen, and king in the French deck, and rank identically. They are the ''sota'',  which is similar to the jack/knave and generally depicts a page or squire, the ''caballo'' (knight, literally \"horse\"), and the ''rey'' (king) respectively. There are instances of historical decks having both ''caballo'' and ''reina'' (queen), the ''caballo'' being of lower value than ''queen''. These decks have no numbers in the figure values, not even letters as in the French deck. Reversible face cards exist but are not popular. It is also possible to find 52-card French decks with Spanish pictures. These have English corner indices which means the Knight will have the Queen's \"Q\" index.\n\nHistorically, Spain was split into several independent states. Even after these states began sharing the same monarchy, they maintained their own separate parliaments, laws, and taxes for several centuries. In the 16th century, Spain became the first country to tax playing cards. The various regions and states kept track of the taxes they were owed by requiring producers, who were often monopolies (''estanco''), to conform to a regional pattern for cards sold locally. Known regional patterns include the Seville, Madrid, Toledo, Navarre, Valencia, and Catalonia patterns. There were also export patterns, possibly including the little known Toulouse/Girona pattern<ref>[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-34.html S-2] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]]. Retrieved 11 October 2016.</ref> or the \"Dragon cards\" (see below). Spain and France exported cards to each other, which explains why the kings and jacks in French-suited face cards resemble their Spanish counterparts, notably the standing kings. There was some deliberate copying; the king of coins from the Seville and Franco-Spanish patterns is near identical to the king of hearts in the French-suited Rouen pattern, which was exported to England and through centuries of bad reproduction became known as the \"suicide king\".<ref>Wintle, Simon.

Retrieved 13 November 2016.</ref> Thus:\n\n* the old suit names were attributed to the new suits - this is the reason why Portuguese names for suits do not match the suit drawings. In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], the Hearts suit is called ''Copas'' (\"cups\"), the Spades suit is called ''Espadas'' (\"swords\"), the Diamonds suit is called ''Ouros'' (\"gold coins\"), and the Clubs suit is called ''Paus'' (\"clubs\" or \"sticks\").\n* the new face cards (King, Queen, Jack) had also to match the old ones (King, Knight, Knave). The King match was an obvious one, but the Queen was held for the lower court card because the old Portuguese sotas were female, and so it was matched with the Knave. The Jack was thought to be the Knight (Cavalier). Thus, in traditional Portuguese games, the cards usually rank King-Jack-Queen.\n\nBoth conventions mentioned above are also practiced in [[Malta]] which once used Portuguese-suited decks.<ref>McLeod, John. [https://www.pagat.com/national/malta.html Card games in Malta] at [[pagat.com]]. Retrieved 13 November 2016.</ref> The extinct Portuguese deck featured straight swords and knobbly clubs like the Spanish suits but intersected them like the northern Italian suits.

Instead of using ''la pinta'', these decks used abbreviations as indices at the top and sometimes also the bottom of the card.

The removal of one rank shortened the deck to 48 which made card production simpler: a whole deck could be made with just two uncut sheets. 48-card decks have nine ranks of [[pip cards]] (1-9) and three ranks of face cards (10-12). Since the mid-20th century, they have usually been sold with two [[Joker (playing card)|jokers]]), for a total of 50 cards. [[Stripped deck]]s have 40 cards, lacking ranks 8 and 9 and jokers. The popularity of the stripped deck is due to game of [[Ombre]], which became a craze throughout Europe during the 17th century.\n\n[[File:Spanish deck printed in Valencia, in 1778.jpg|thumb|right|Valencia pattern cards from 1778. They are closely related to the Old Catalan pattern.]]\nThe Spanish suits closely resemble [[Italian playing cards|Italian-suited cards]] as both were derived from the Arab cards. The four suits are ''bastos'' (clubs), ''oros'' (literally \"golds\", that is, golden coins), ''copas'' (cups) and ''espadas'' (swords). Unlike the suits found in northern Italy, Spanish swords are straight and the clubs resemble knobbly cudgels instead of ceremonial batons. Swords and clubs also do not intersect (except in the 3 of clubs card).<ref name=\"Dummett\">{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Game of Tarot|date=1980|publisher=Duckworth|location=London|pages=10\u201332}}</ref> Two surviving early decks did have intersecting clubs and swords like in Italian or Arab cards. The Spanish may have separated the pips in the 15th century to make them more easily distinguishable (some export cards kept the intersecting pips, see \"Extinct Portuguese pattern\" below).<ref name=\"Denning\" /> Each card has an outline frame to distinguish the suit without showing all of your cards: The cups have one interruption, the swords two, the clubs three, and the gold none. This mark is called \"''la pinta''\" and gave rise to the expression: ''le conoc\u00ed por la pinta'' (\"I knew him by his markings\"). ''La pinta'' first appeared around the mid-17th century. Like the Italian-suited [[tarot]], the deck is used for both game playing and [[cartomancy]]. The Spanish deck has been widely considered to be part of the occult in many Latin American countries, yet they continue to be used widely for card games and gambling, especially in Spain.\n\nThe three face cards of each suit have pictures similar to the jack, queen, and king in the French deck, and rank identically. They are the ''sota'',  which is similar to the jack/knave and generally depicts a page or squire, the ''caballo'' (knight, literally \"horse\"), and the ''rey'' (king) respectively. There are instances of historical decks having both ''caballo'' and ''reina'' (queen), the ''caballo'' being of lower value than ''queen''. These decks have no numbers in the figure values, not even letters as in the French deck. Reversible face cards exist but are not popular. It is also possible to find 52-card French decks with Spanish pictures. These have English corner indices which means the Knight will have the Queen's \"Q\" index.\n\nHistorically, Spain was split into several independent states. Even after these states began sharing the same monarchy, they maintained their own separate parliaments, laws, and taxes for several centuries. In the 16th century, Spain became the first country to tax playing cards. The various regions and states kept track of the taxes they were owed by requiring producers, who were often monopolies (''estanco''), to conform to a regional pattern for cards sold locally. Known regional patterns include the Seville, Madrid, Toledo, Navarre, Valencia, and Catalonia patterns. There were also export patterns, possibly including the little known Toulouse/Girona pattern<ref>[http://i-p-c-s.org/pattern/ps-34.html S-2] at the [[International Playing-Card Society]]. Retrieved 11 October 2016.</ref> or the \"Dragon cards\" (see below). Spain and France exported cards to each other, which explains why the kings and jacks in French-suited face cards resemble their Spanish counterparts, notably the standing kings. There was some deliberate copying; the king of coins from the Seville and Franco-Spanish patterns is near identical to the king of hearts in the French-suited Rouen pattern, which was exported to England and through centuries of bad reproduction became known as the \"suicide king\".<ref>Wintle, Simon.

It was introduced as the WWE Women's Championship on April 3, 2016 at [[WrestleMania 32]] to replace the [[WWE Divas Championship|Divas Championship]] and has a unique title history separate from the original [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWE Women's Championship]]. As a result of the [[2016 WWE draft|2016 draft]], the championship became exclusive to Raw with a subsequent rename and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] created the [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship|SmackDown Women's Championship]] as a counterpart title.\n\nThe championship is generally contested in [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], in which participants execute [[Screenplay|scripted]] finishes rather than contend in [[Competition#Sports|direct competition]]. The inaugural champion was [[Charlotte Flair]], then known simply as Charlotte, who won the title at WrestleMania 32. [[Becky Lynch]] is the current champion in her first reign. She won the title by defeating [[Ronda Rousey]] and SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Winner takes all match|winner takes all]] [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination match|triple threat match]] to win both titles at [[WrestleMania 35]] on April 8, 2019 (though lost the SmackDown title [[Money in the Bank (2019)|the following month]]).\n\nOverall, there have been 15 reigns between 7 champions. Charlotte Flair is tied with [[Sasha Banks]] for the most reigns at four. [[Becky Lynch]]'s current reign is the longest at {{age in days nts|April 8, 2019}}+ days whiles Banks' fourth reign is the shortest at 8 days (9 days as recognized by WWE). [[Alexa Bliss]] has the longest combined reign at 398 days (396 days as recognized by WWE). [[Nia Jax]] is the oldest champion, winning the title at the age of 33, while Banks is the youngest, first winning the title at 24.\n\n== Title history ==\n=== Names ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Years\n|-\n|WWE Women's Championship\n|April 3, 2016 \u2013 September 4, 2016\n|-\n|'''WWE Raw Women's Championship'''\n|September 5, 2016 \u2013 present\n|}\n\n=== Reigns ===\n{{Professional wrestling title history top|active=yes|dayless=yes|unrecognized=yes|days2=yes}}\n{{PWtitlereign\n|sort number = 0.5\n|type = promotion\n|name = [[WWE]] (unbranded)\n}}{{PWtitlereign\n|number   = 1\n|champion = {{sortname||Charlotte|Charlotte Flair}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     = {{dts|April 3, 2016}}\n|days     = {{age in days nts|April 3, 2016|July 25, 2016}}\n|days2    = yes\n|location = [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington, TX]]\n|event    = [[WrestleMania 32]]\n|notes    = On the WrestleMania 32 Kickoff pre-show, the title was established as the WWE Women's Championship to replace the [[WWE Divas Championship]], which was originally to be defended in this match.

It was introduced as the WWE Women's Championship on April 3, 2016 at [[WrestleMania 32]] to replace the [[WWE Divas Championship|Divas Championship]] and has a unique title history separate from the original [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|WWE Women's Championship]]. As a result of the [[2016 WWE draft|2016 draft]], the championship became exclusive to Raw with a subsequent rename and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] created the [[WWE SmackDown Women's Championship|SmackDown Women's Championship]] as a counterpart title.\n\nThe championship is generally contested in [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], in which participants execute [[Screenplay|scripted]] finishes rather than contend in [[Competition#Sports|direct competition]]. The inaugural champion was [[Charlotte Flair]], then known simply as Charlotte, who won the title at WrestleMania 32. [[Becky Lynch]] is the current champion in her first reign. She won the title by defeating [[Ronda Rousey]] and SmackDown Women's Champion Charlotte Flair in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Winner takes all match|winner takes all]] [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination match|triple threat match]] to win both titles at [[WrestleMania 35]] on April 8, 2019 (though lost the SmackDown title [[Money in the Bank (2019)|the following month]]).\n\nOverall, there have been 15 reigns between 7 champions. Charlotte Flair is tied with [[Sasha Banks]] for the most reigns at four. [[Becky Lynch]]'s current reign is the longest at {{age in days nts|April 8, 2019}}+ days whiles Banks' fourth reign is the shortest at 8 days (9 days as recognized by WWE). [[Alexa Bliss]] has the longest combined reign at 398 days (396 days as recognized by WWE). [[Nia Jax]] is the oldest champion, winning the title at the age of 33, while Banks is the youngest, first winning the title at 24.\n\n== Title history ==\n=== Names ===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Name\n!Years\n|-\n|WWE Women's Championship\n|April 3, 2016 \u2013 September 4, 2016\n|-\n|'''WWE Raw Women's Championship'''\n|September 5, 2016 \u2013 present\n|}\n\n=== Reigns ===\n{{Professional wrestling title history top|active=yes|dayless=yes|unrecognized=yes|days2=yes}}\n{{PWtitlereign\n|sort number = 0.5\n|type = promotion\n|name = [[WWE]] (unbranded)\n}}{{PWtitlereign\n|number   = 1\n|champion = {{sortname||Charlotte|Charlotte Flair}}\n|reign    = 1\n|date     = {{dts|April 3, 2016}}\n|days     = {{age in days nts|April 3, 2016|July 25, 2016}}\n|days2    = yes\n|location = [[Arlington, Texas|Arlington, TX]]\n|event    = [[WrestleMania 32]]\n|notes    = On the WrestleMania 32 Kickoff pre-show, the title was established as the WWE Women's Championship to replace the [[WWE Divas Championship]], which was originally to be defended in this match.

Janaradhan has done everything to bring them up in the best possible manner, ever since they were toddlers.\n\nNow the duo has grown up, and Gaurav has taken up the responsibility for his father. They manage the household chores and their business to the best of their abilities. He treats his father as his son. Gaurav is on his guard with the vigilance of a disciplined parent. He shouts, threatens, fights, and even locks up his father occasionally so that Rane's best friend Madhav Mathur \u2013 who is a divorc\u00e9 and desperate to marry \u2013 does not spoil him. Madhav and Janaradhan who are always in search of a bride for Madhav forever land up in trouble and Gaurav always has to bail them out and face embarrassment.\n\nGaurav, busy managing his business, starts getting prank calls from a girl who turns out to be his old college classmate he used to bully, Shikha Kapoor ([[Genelia D'Souza]]). Shikha is staying with her guardian Anuradha ([[Shobana]]) who was Janardhan's first love. Gaurav and Shikha notice changes in the behaviour of Janaradhan and Anuradha when they come face to face after many years. They learn about their past relationship. Now Gaurav wants his father to marry his lost love. Gaurav and Shikha embark upon a rib-tickling journey to arrange his father's and her guardian's love marriage and, in the process, find soul mates in each other. Although the path is not so smooth; with obstacles, Madhav's desperate desire for a bride comes in handy.\n\nHowever, Shikha's father ([[Naseeruddin Shah]]), seemingly not pleased with the fact that his daughter will be marrying into a family 'where the father in law is arranging his own honeymoon', threatens the termination of Gaurav's relationship with Shikha. In addition, Chirag's wife ([[Preity Pundir]]) and her family also show their anger at such a relationship. Despite all these, after a chain of events, Gaurav gets Rane married to Anuradha, against the wishes of many. However, at the end, Shikha's father reveals that in fact, if Gaurav had decided not to conduct his father's remarriage and courted Shikha instead, he would actually have been very disappointed.
