While in the wet state, the paper stock (a dilute dispersion of the cellulose fibers in water) is drained on a wire mesh to de-water the stock. During this process, a dandy roll with a laid mesh pattern is pressed into the wet stock, displacing the cellulose fiber.<ref>U.S. Dept. of Commerce, ''Circular of the Bureau of Standards'', No. 70 (Washington: GPO, 1917), [https://books.google.com/books?id=spMPAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA169 p. 169].</ref> This pattern has to be applied at a particular stock consistency; otherwise the pattern will be lost as the fiber flows back while the stock moves past the dandy (too wet), or fiber will pick out of the stock (too dry), causing surface disruption. As the fiber is displaced, localized areas of higher and lower density are produced in a laid pattern, and the pattern is also created on the paper's surface. The pattern is therefore apparent both as one looks through the sheet and as one views its surface. Applying the laid pattern as a mechanical emboss would not create the ribbed pattern seen on looking through the sheet, as this is achieved only by watermarking techniques.\n\n<br />\n\n\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Paper}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Laid Paper}}\n[[Category:Paper]]\n", "text_old": "'''Laid paper''' is a type of [[paper]] having a ribbed texture imparted by the manufacturing process.

Improvements in mould making in the early 1800s lifted the chain wires slightly, resulting in a more evenly toned sheet.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collation.folger.edu/2012/06/learning-to-read-old-paper/|title=Learning to \"read\" old paper|date=2012-06-25|website=The Collation|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n== Modern Production ==\n[[File:Randolph Caldecott illustration2.jpg|left|thumb|Visible laid pattern effect in a [[picture book]] illustration by [[Randolph Caldecott]].  Published 1887, digitally restored.]]\nModern papermaking techniques use a [[Watermark#Dandy roll process|dandy roll]] to create the laid pattern during the early stages of manufacture, similar to the way a [[watermark]] is added to handmade papers. While in the wet state, the paper stock (a dilute dispersion of the cellulose fibers in water) is drained on a wire mesh to de-water the stock. During this process, a dandy roll with a laid mesh pattern is pressed into the wet stock, displacing the cellulose fiber.<ref>U.S. Dept. of Commerce, ''Circular of the Bureau of Standards'', No. 70 (Washington: GPO, 1917), [https://books.google.com/books?id=spMPAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA169 p. 169].</ref> This pattern has to be applied at a particular stock consistency; otherwise the pattern will be lost as the fiber flows back while the stock moves past the dandy (too wet), or fiber will pick out of the stock (too dry), causing surface disruption. As the fiber is displaced, localized areas of higher and lower density are produced in a laid pattern, and the pattern is also created on the paper's surface. The pattern is therefore apparent both as one looks through the sheet and as one views its surface. Applying the laid pattern as a mechanical emboss would not create the ribbed pattern seen on looking through the sheet, as this is achieved only by watermarking techniques.\n\n<br />\n\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Paper}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Laid Paper}}\n[[Category:Paper]]\n", "name_user": "MeeshKapiche", "label": "safe", "comment": "Formatting", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laid_paper"}

The album is a [[concept album]] about the death of Elverum's wife, the Canadian cartoonist and musician [[Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e]]. The album was written and produced entirely by Elverum, who recorded the album using mostly Castr\u00e9e's instruments in the room in which she died and features minimal production and sparse instrumentation which was a departure from Elverum's previous work. ''A Crow Looked at Me'' was released on March 24, 2017 on Elverum's own label, P.W. Elverum & Sun.\n\nPrior to the release of the album, Elverum released two singles, \"Real Death\" and \"Ravens\", released on January 18, 2017, and February 15, 2017, respectively. Both songs deal with Castr\u00e9e's death and Elverum dealing with the aftermath. Both songs received critical acclaim each earning best new track by [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] with \"Real Death\" being number three on the \"100 Best Songs of 2017\" list. ''A Crow Looked at Me'' was an immediate and widespread critical success, appearing on numerous best of year lists. In the years following its release, the album has appeared in multiple best of decade lists. Some critics found that due to the nature of the album reviewing the album was difficult and disrespectful.\n\n==Background and composition==\n[[File:Gary Snyder, Mark Kozelek, Julie Doiron, Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd.jpg|thumb|250x250px|left|From left to right: Poet Gary Snyder, American musician Mark Kozelek, Norwegian writter Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd and Canadian singer-songwriter Julie Doiron all of which Phil Elverum took inspiration from]]\n[[File:Mount_Eerie,_Real_Death.ogg|thumb|260x300px|right|The album opener introduces the theme that \"death is real\" which Elverum once said \"could be the name\" of the album.<ref name=\"fact_announce\" />]]\nIn 2015, [[Phil Elverum]]'s wife, Canadian cartoonist and musician [[Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e]], was diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]] four months after the birth of their first child.

The album is a [[concept album]] about the death of Elverum's wife, the Canadian cartoonist and musician [[Genevi\u00e8ve Castr\u00e9e]]. The album was written and produced entirely by Elverum, who recorded the album using mostly Castr\u00e9e's instruments in the room in which she died and features minimal production and sparse instrumentation which was a departure from Elverum's previous work. ''A Crow Looked at Me'' was released on March 24, 2017 on Elverum's own label, P.W. Elverum & Sun.\n\nPrior to the release of the album, Elverum released two singles, \"Real Death\" and \"Ravens\", released on January 18, 2017, and February 15, 2017, respectively. Both songs deal with Castr\u00e9e's death and Elverum dealing with the aftermath. Both songs received critical acclaim each earning best new track by [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] with \"Real Death\" being number three on the \"100 Best Songs of 2017\" list.

Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he brutally betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.</blockquote>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Democratization}}\nThe [[Roman Republic]] was the first known government in the western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the [[Roman assemblies]].

The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects.... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth. The \"rights of man\" enumerated in the English Bill of Rights gradually were proclaimed beyond the boundaries of England, notably in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 and in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024130317/http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[American Revolution]] led to the creation of a new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office.

Their wishes ought to have great weight with him; their opinion, high respect; their business, unremitted attention. It is his duty to sacrifice his repose, his pleasures, his satisfactions, to theirs; and above all, ever, and in all cases, to prefer their interest to his own. But his unbiassed opinion, his mature judgment, his enlightened conscience, he ought not to sacrifice to you, to any man, or to any set of men living. These he does not derive from your pleasure; no, nor from the law and the constitution. They are a trust from Providence, for the abuse of which he is deeply answerable. Your representative owes you, not his industry only, but his judgment; and he brutally betrays, instead of serving you, if he sacrifices it to your opinion.</blockquote>\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Democratization}}\nThe [[Roman Republic]] was the first known government in the western world to have a representative government, despite taking the form of a direct government in the [[Roman assemblies]].

The rising commercial class that had supported the Tudor monarchy in the 16th century led the revolutionary battle in the 17th, and succeeded in establishing the supremacy of Parliament and, eventually, of the House of Commons. What emerged as the distinctive feature of modern constitutionalism was not the insistence on the idea that the king is subject to law (although this concept is an essential attribute of all constitutionalism). This notion was already well established in the Middle Ages. What was distinctive was the establishment of effective means of political control whereby the rule of law might be enforced. Modern constitutionalism was born with the political requirement that representative government depended upon the consent of citizen subjects.... However, as can be seen through provisions in the 1689 Bill of Rights, the English Revolution was fought not just to protect the rights of property (in the narrow sense) but to establish those liberties which liberals believed essential to human dignity and moral worth. The \"rights of man\" enumerated in the English Bill of Rights gradually were proclaimed beyond the boundaries of England, notably in the American Declaration of Independence of 1776 and in the French Declaration of the Rights of Man in 1789.|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024130317/http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/zhtw/DOCS/Demopaper/dmpaper2.html|archivedate=24 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe [[American Revolution]] led to the creation of a new [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] of the United States in 1787, with a national legislature based partly on direct elections of representatives every two years, and thus responsible to the electorate for continuance in office.

The season officially runs from November 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020, however a tropical cyclone could form at any time between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 and would count towards the season total. During the season, tropical cyclones will be  officially monitored by the [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] (RSMC) in [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Nadi, Fiji]] and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers in [[Bureau of Meteorology|Brisbane, Australia]] and [[Meteorological Service of New Zealand Limited|Wellington, New Zealand]]. The [[United States Armed Forces]] through the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] <small>(JTWC)</small> will also monitor the basin and issue unofficial warnings for American interests. RSMC Nadi attaches a number and an F suffix to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the basin while the JTWC designates significant tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. RSMC Nadi, TCWC Wellington and TCWC Brisbane all use the [[Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale]] and estimate windspeeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC estimated sustained winds over a 1-minute period, which are subsequently compared to the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale]] <small>(SSHWS)</small>.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|- \n!

Rita would then peak as a Category 3 on the [[Australian scale]]. Tropical Disturbance 02F was designated sometime later, but didn't last long after that. Sarai formed on December 23, lasting into the new year before finally ceasing to exist on January 2. Not too long after that, Tino formed and affected eastern [[Fiji]] and the surrounding area before dissipating. On January 24, a depression formed and dissipated the next day without been named. In early February, another low originally in the Australian region crossed the [[160th meridian east]] and emerged in the South Pacific. It strengthened into severe tropical cyclone Uesi and affected New Caledonia and New Zealand. In mid-February four disturbances formed, 07F, 08F, 09F and 10F. 07F & 08F dissipated before becoming tropical depressions but the other 2 strengthened into tropical cyclones Vicky and Wasi. In mid March, Gretel entered the basin. It dissipated shortly afterwards. In early April, Harold also entered the basin from the Australian region. It rapidly intensified into a Category 5 Severe tropical cyclone as it impacted [[Vanuatu]].\n\n==Systems==\n===Severe Tropical Cyclone Rita===\n{{Infobox tropical cyclone small\n|Basin=SPac\n|Image=Rita 2019-11-24 2240Z.jpg\n|Track=Rita 2019 track.png\n|Formed=November 22\n|Dissipated=November 26\n|10-min winds=65\n|1-min winds=65\n|Pressure=977\n}}\n\nBeginning November 21, the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS) began highlighting the likelihood of a [[tropical cyclone]] forming between [[Vanuatu]] and [[Fiji]].<ref name=\"5Day_21Nov\">{{cite report|title=Tropical Cyclone - 5 Day Outlook (21 November 2019)|type=5 Day Outlook|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |location=Nadi, Fiji|date=November 21, 2019}}</ref> Showers and thunderstorms began to aggregate in the region atop [[sea surface temperature]]s above {{cvt|29|C|F}} in low-[[wind shear]] conditions.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov1930\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for 22 November 0930 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Imagery from [[Microwave radiometer|microwave satellite data]] showed emergent [[rainband]]s wrapping towards an organising [[low-pressure area|center of low pressure]].<ref>{{cite report|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans (November 22 2000 UTC) |publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center  |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Late on November 22, the FMS designated the system, now east of the [[Solomon Islands]], as Tropical Disturbance 01F.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov2100\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for November 22 2100 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> The slow-moving disturbance tracked towards the south and southeast,<ref>{{cite report|title=Tropical Disturbance Advisory Number A1 for Tropical Depression 01F|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 23, 2019}}</ref> steered by a broad [[subtropical ridge|area of high pressure]].

the [[South Pacific Ocean]] to the east of 160\u00b0E. The season officially runs from November 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020, however a tropical cyclone could form at any time between July 1, 2019 and June 30, 2020 and would count towards the season total. During the season, tropical cyclones will be  officially monitored by the [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Center]] (RSMC) in [[Fiji Meteorological Service|Nadi, Fiji]] and the Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers in [[Bureau of Meteorology|Brisbane, Australia]] and [[Meteorological Service of New Zealand Limited|Wellington, New Zealand]]. The [[United States Armed Forces]] through the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] <small>(JTWC)</small> will also monitor the basin and issue unofficial warnings for American interests. RSMC Nadi attaches a number and an F suffix to tropical disturbances that form in or move into the basin while the JTWC designates significant tropical cyclones with a number and a P suffix. RSMC Nadi, TCWC Wellington and TCWC Brisbane all use the [[Australian Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale]] and estimate windspeeds over a period of ten minutes, while the JTWC estimated sustained winds over a 1-minute period, which are subsequently compared to the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale]] <small>(SSHWS)</small>.\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Seasonal forecasts==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|- \n!

Rita would then peak as a Category 3 on the [[Australian scale]]. Tropical Disturbance 02F was designated sometime later, but didn't last long after that. Sarai formed on December 23, lasting into the new year before finally ceasing to exist on January 2. Not too long after that, Tino formed and affected eastern [[Fiji]] and the surrounding area before dissipating. On January 24, a depression formed and dissipated the next day without been named. In early February, another low originally in the Australian region crossed the [[160th meridian east]] and emerged in the South Pacific. It strengthened into severe tropical cyclone Uesi and affected New Caledonia and New Zealand. In mid-February four disturbances formed, 07F, 08F, 09F and 10F. 07F & 08F dissipated before becoming tropical depressions but the other 2 strengthened into tropical cyclones Vicky and Wasi. In mid March, Gretel entered the basin. It dissipated shortly afterwards. In early April, Harold also entered the basin from the Australian region. It rapidly intensified into a Category 5 Severe tropical cyclone as it impacted [[Vanuatu]].\n\n==Systems==\n===Severe Tropical Cyclone Rita===\n{{Infobox tropical cyclone small\n|Basin=SPac\n|Image=Rita 2019-11-24 2240Z.jpg\n|Track=Rita 2019 track.png\n|Formed=November 22\n|Dissipated=November 26\n|10-min winds=65\n|1-min winds=65\n|Pressure=977\n}}\n\nBeginning November 21, the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] (FMS) began highlighting the likelihood of a [[tropical cyclone]] forming between [[Vanuatu]] and [[Fiji]].<ref name=\"5Day_21Nov\">{{cite report|title=Tropical Cyclone - 5 Day Outlook (21 November 2019)|type=5 Day Outlook|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |location=Nadi, Fiji|date=November 21, 2019}}</ref> Showers and thunderstorms began to aggregate in the region atop [[sea surface temperature]]s above {{cvt|29|C|F}} in low-[[wind shear]] conditions.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov1930\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for 22 November 0930 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Imagery from [[Microwave radiometer|microwave satellite data]] showed emergent [[rainband]]s wrapping towards an organising [[low-pressure area|center of low pressure]].<ref>{{cite report|title=Significant Tropical Weather Advisory for the Western and South Pacific Oceans (November 22 2000 UTC) |publisher=United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center  |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> Late on November 22, the FMS designated the system, now east of the [[Solomon Islands]], as Tropical Disturbance 01F.<ref name=\"TDS_22Nov2100\">{{cite report|type=Tropical Disturbance Summary|title=Tropical Disturbance Summary for November 22 2100 UTC |publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 22, 2019}}</ref> The slow-moving disturbance tracked towards the south and southeast,<ref>{{cite report|title=Tropical Disturbance Advisory Number A1 for Tropical Depression 01F|publisher=Fiji Meteorological Service |date=November 23, 2019}}</ref> steered by a broad [[subtropical ridge|area of high pressure]].
