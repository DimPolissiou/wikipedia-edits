Founded in 1885, it is the second-oldest technical university in the former [[Russian Empire]] (after [[Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology]]) and in the territory of modern Ukraine (after [[Lviv Polytechnic]]).\n\n== History ==\n\nThe university was established according to the program for technical education in the Russian Empire set up by [[Dmitry Mendeleev]] as a Practical Technological Institute, with two departments (mechanical and chemical) which could offer training to 125 students. The organizer and first rector of the institute was [[Viktor Kyrpychov]], an honored professor specializing in mechanics and resistance in materials. In 1898, the institute was renamed the [[Alexander III of Russia|Emperor Alexander III]] Technological Institute. After the [[October Revolution]] in 1917, the Technological Institute continued its work. In 1921 the institute set up the first [[Rabfak|department for workers (rabfak)]] in Ukraine, and in 1923 (at the request of students, teachers and employees) the institute was renamed for [[Lenin|Vladimir Lenin]]. In 1929 the V.I. Lenin institute of Technology was renamed the Kharkiv V.I. Lenin Polytechnic Institute (KhPI), a name kept until the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1930, five independent higher-educational institutions (for mechanical machine-engineering, electrical technology, chemical technology, engineering and construction, and aviation) were set up as five separate departments of the institute. KhPI, as a whole, temporarily ceased to exist after that but historians consider these five institutions as informal branches sharing a common history. During [[World War II]] over 3,000 professors, students and institute employees joined the Army. Evacuated to [[Krasnoufimsk]] and [[Chirchiq]], the institute continued training engineering staff; it also solved serious scientific problems related to strengthening national defense (such as contributing to tank-design work spearheaded by [[Alexander Alexandrovich Morozov|Alexander Morozov]], one of the key engineers in [[T-34]] design). In 1949 four higher-educational institutions (the institutes for mechanical machine-engineering, chemical technology, electrical technology and the institute of the cement industry) were reunited into the Kharkiv V.I.Lenin Polytechnic Institute. Professor Mikhail Semko was appointed its rector, and remained in this position for 30 years.\n\nAfter [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt#Disintegration of the USSR|the fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, KhPI continued its work as a Ukrainian institution of higher learning. In April 1994, the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]] granted Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute university status and it was renamed the Kharkiv State Polytechnic University (KhSPU). In September 2000, the status of National Technical University has been given to KhSPU, by decree of the [[President of Ukraine]]; since then, it has had its current name (NTU \"KhPI\"). In February 2010, NTU \"KhPI\" was granted the status of Autonomous Research National University by  decree of the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers.\n\n== {{anchor|Current status}}Status ==\n\nNTU \"KhPI\" has been accredited as a university of the highest (IV) level. It trains full-time students in 91 fields and offers 69 fields for instruction by [[Distance education|correspondence]]. It has the greatest number of matriculated students in eastern and southern Ukraine (4,377 places for full-time students and over 4,000 places for correspondence students). The university has 21 full-time departments, departments for correspondence and new full-time students, a center for foreign students, an inter-branch institute for advanced studies and three research and design institutes. It prepares specialists in the fields of machine-building, automation, [[electrical engineering]], electronics, [[chemical engineering]], control systems, [[management]], [[computer science]], [[software engineering]] and business.\n\n==Campuses and buildings==\nThe university consists of approximately 20 buildings. Most campuses are concentrated compactly \u2014 between \"Pushkinskaya\" and \"Architect Beketov\" underground stations. Campuses have changed shape over time. Old buildings were built, as usual in the 19th century, and functioned from the very inception of the institute. They are built of red brick and are of great architectural and even historical value. New buildings were built in the Soviet era and their dimensions correspond to concrete houses built at that time. They were built during 1960-1980s.\nThere are two campuses in the university: main campus, where most of auditory and administrative buildings are situated and dormitory campus with not only student dormitories but with Student Palace \u2014 place for solemn events and student arts study groups training, and with Sports Complex.\nAmong educational and administrative buildings there are: Main Building (residence of Rector's Office and some administrative services), Educational Buildings U-1 and U-2, Main Classroom Building, Chemistry building, Physics Building, Mathematics Building, Radio-electronic Building, Electrotechnical Building, Engineering Building, Technical Building, Computing Centre and Library Building.\n\n===Campus U-1===\nU-1 is the highest building and one of the largest in the university. The body has a rectangular shape at the base. It has a large area of glazing (*). It is the tallest in the university and one of the tallest buildings in the city \u2014 besides, it is located on top of a hill. You can see much of the city from there: all Nagirnyy region and adjacent neighbors, Holodna Gora, Saltovka, Novi doma. This building was commissioned in 1974. There are six elevators, including two high-speed, which start to function 10 minutes before the lectures start and stop when they begin. There are two stairwells. U-1 has many departments, dean offices and classrooms.\n*Height: 60 m\n*Number of floors: 14\n*Year of completion: 1974\n\n===Campus U-2===\nU-2 is the second highest and the largest building of the university. As with U-1, it was built during the period of mass construction and in the typical style. Its shape is rectangular; it is linked by an underground passage with the Physical campus building. The architectural design is more interesting than U-1, for example, the staircase is paved with marble. As in U-1, there are four elevators. The building has eight floors including a basement which is used for education. (U-1 has a basement but, unlike U-2, it's for storage.)\n\nThe building includes a department of general and experimental physics along with many other departments. The university entrance examination commission, offices of the university newspapers and the cafeteria are housed there. Physical condition of the campus is relatively good. One of the university computer labs local is here. The first floor of the building is occupied by the student government \"Student Alliance\" of NTU \"KhPI\"\n*Height: 32\u201334 m\n*Number of floors: 7 (8 with the basement)\n*Year of completing: 1982\n\n===Central part of Main Classroom Building===\nMCB (Main Classroom Building) is the largest of the old buildings of the institute. It is lined with brick and was constructed in the second half of the 19th century. The building contains a number of departments, dean offices and other classrooms. The building is rectangular with two interior courtyards. There are a library and reading room. The classic design of the stairs is the main architectural feature of the building. It has three floors, with high ceilings whose height is 4.5 meters. The building has a large basement.\n\nFor a long time it was used as the main building of the University (until building of U-1 and U-2). During its long existence (over 100 years) many famous people worked there. There are memorial plaques at the main entrance of the building in their honor. The Memorial built in honor of Polytechnicians, who died during the Great Patriotic War is opposite the building. The building itself has a lot of art work showing the life of the institute in different eras and a wall commemorating the heroes of the Great Patriotic War. The outside part of the building has rich architectural decoration.\n*Height: 17 m\n*Number of floors: 3\n*Year of completing: 1885\n\n===Sports Complex===\nThe Sports complex of the NTU \"KhPI\" is a building separate from the campus in the Kharkiv Youth's park (close to Pushkinskaya subway station, apart from other university buildings). It is built of cement blocks. It is a relatively new building built in the 1980s. The Sports complex has a lot of rooms, gyms and sport objects including an Olympic-size pool. It is equipped with modern changing rooms and shower facilities. Athletic competitions between NTU \"KhPI\" students and students of other universities take place here. Also the NTU \"KhPI\" students' physical education classes are held here. The Sports complex is one of the best buildings in the city and at the university. It is the second large building of university campus after U-2 (2nd Educational building). The building shape is not uniform as it is more geared toward functionality. The lobby is decorated by two trophy-cases containing awards, won by NTU \"KhPI\" sportsmen.\n\nThe university has unique sports facilities, which in certain sports granted the status of the Center of Olympic training. Athletes successfully defend the honor of the university in competitions at the highest level. In total during 2005 to 2011 in the competition of the European level they won 46 gold, 33 silver and 62 bronze awards. In world competitions they won 36 gold, 20 silver and 19 bronze awards.\n\n===Radio-electronic building (modern name: NTU \"KhPI\" Center for Integrated Technologies)===\nThe Radio-electronic building (\"NTU KhPI Center for Integrated Technologies\") is a four-floor cement building, with a basement. It is one of the new university's buildings. In this rather small building are housed laboratories, equipment and computer classes. The ground floor windows are protected with grates. Including a basement it is a five-storey building. There is a freight elevator. Floors are connected with big panoramic staircases. Among the university buildings, which were built during Soviet years in the 1960s\u20131970s, this one has the lowest number of floors. The research institute is on the second and third floors. The building also houses the Institute of Ionosphere of NAS, the Ministry of Education and the offices of Youth and Sport of Ukraine.\n*Height : 16 m\n*Number of stores: 4 (5 with basement)\n*Completion of construction: 1960s and '70s\n\n===Chemistry building is one of the oldest in the university===\nThe Chemistry building is the second in size and importance of the old buildings of the university. It was built in the middle of 19th century along with the Main Academic building. Most chemical laboratories and dean's office of the Organic Substances Technology Faculty are located in the building. Like the Main Academic building it is square shaped with an enclosed court in the centre.\n\nOn the second floor of the building is the Great Chemical Auditorium, one of the largest in the institute. The building has two entrances: external and internal. The addition of two floors marred the building's classic design.\n*Height: 18 m\n*Number of floors: 4 (sometimes 3)\n*Completion of construction: Second half \u2013 the end of 19th century.\n\n===Electrotechnical building===\nThe Electrotechnical building of NTU \"KhPI\" has the most students. In the past this building was an independent Electrotechnical institute, separated from Kharkiv Technical Institute. It was designed by the architect Beketov in 1930 and is an example of architectural constructivism. Technical departments and dean's offices are located in the building. The Electrotechnical building is one of the largest in the university; it has several entrances and exits as well as the main one.\n\nAfter the war during the process of reconstruction, the main entrance of the building was designed as a colonnade in the architectural style of Stalin's Empire. The building plays an important role in the life of NTU \"KhPI\". Different events and funerals for honored people of the university take place in front of the map of electrification and before the statue of Lenin.\n\n== {{anchor|Faculties and branches}}Departments and satellite campus ==\n[[Image:Politeknik building, Kharkiv, c 1900.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Main Administrative Building, circa 1900|alt=Tinted photo of main administration building, about 1900]]\n*  Department of computer science and management\n*  Department of computer and information technologies\n*  Department of mechanical engineering\n*  Department of power-plant engineering\n*  Department of transport engineering\n*  Department of economics\n*  Department of business and finance\n*  Department of physics and technology\n*  Department of electric power\n*  Department of electric-power engineering\n*  Department of instrument-making\n*  Department of inorganic-substance technology\n*  Department of organic-substance technology\n*  Department of chemical machine engineering\n*  Department of economics and law\n*  Department of business management\n*  Department of military education (formerly the Kharkiv Higher Tank Command School)\n*  [[Chernivtsi]] campus\n\n== {{anchor|Notable alumni and former students|Notable former employees}}Notable alumni and faculty ==\n* [[Nikolay Beketov]], Russian physical chemist\n* Petr Budnikov, Soviet chemist (chemistry of silicates){{fact|date=February 2020}}\n* [[Lev Davidovich Belkind|Lev Belkind]], Soviet power engineer and science historian\n* [[Chelpan Konstantin Fyodorovich|Konstantin Chelpan]], chief designer of the [[T-34|T-34 tank]] engine\n* [[Marharyta Dorozhon]], Israeli javelin thrower<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baku2015.com/athletes/athlete=dorozhon-margaryta-1004036/index.html?intcmp=athletes-hub|title=Baku 2015 1St European Games \u2013 Athletes \u2013 DOROZHON Margaryta|work=Baku 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Mikhail Gurevich (aircraft designer)|Mikhail Gurevich]], Soviet aircraft designer\n* [[Leonid Krasin]], Russian  and Soviet Bolshevik politician and diplomat\n* [[Hnat Khotkevych]], Ukrainian cultural figure\n* [[Lev Landau]], Soviet physicist, [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize]] winner (1962)\n* Alexander Morozov, Soviet tank designer, long-time head of [[Morozov Design Bureau]], one of the key persons responsible for T-34 tank and its successors{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n* [[Alexey Oleynik]] Ukrainian-Russian professional [[mixed martial artist]], two-time world champion in combat sambo, current [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] Heavyweight<ref>{{cite web|title=Alexey Oleynik UFC Bio|url=http://www.ufc.com/fighter/Oleksiy-Oliynyk|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Leonid Pastur]], Ukrainian physicist and mathematician.\n* [[Nikolai Pylchykov]], KhPI professor, practical physicist, inventor of radio remote control and photovoltaic effect\n* [[Vladimir Steklov (mathematician)|Vladimir Steklov]], Soviet/Russian  mathematician and physicist\n* [[Leon Theremin]], Soviet inventor, creator of the [[theremin]], the first [[electronic musical instrument]]\n* Anton Valter, Soviet nuclear physicist, one of the founders of the Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology, the first nuclear physics research facility in Ukraine{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n* [[Sergiy Vilkomir]], Ukrainian-born computer scientist\n* [[Iona Yakir]], Red Army commander and military reformer\n\n==Honorable doctors==\nThe first doctors of honor of NTU \"KhPI\" were distinguished scientist such as Professors D.I.

Founded in 1885, it is the second-oldest technical university in the former [[Russian Empire]] (after [[Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology]]) and in the territory of modern Ukraine (after [[Lviv Polytechnic]]).\n\n== History ==\n\nThe university was established according to the program for technical education in the Russian Empire set up by [[Dmitry Mendeleev]] as a Practical Technological Institute, with two departments (mechanical and chemical) which could offer training to 125 students. The organizer and first rector of the institute was [[Viktor Kyrpychov]], an honored professor specializing in mechanics and resistance in materials. In 1898, the institute was renamed the [[Alexander III of Russia|Emperor Alexander III]] Technological Institute. After the [[October Revolution]] in 1917, the Technological Institute continued its work. In 1921 the institute set up the first [[Rabfak|department for workers (rabfak)]] in Ukraine, and in 1923 (at the request of students, teachers and employees) the institute was renamed for [[Lenin|Vladimir Lenin]]. In 1929 the V.I. Lenin institute of Technology was renamed the Kharkiv V.I. Lenin Polytechnic Institute (KhPI), a name kept until the fall of the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1930, five independent higher-educational institutions (for mechanical machine-engineering, electrical technology, chemical technology, engineering and construction, and aviation) were set up as five separate departments of the institute. KhPI, as a whole, temporarily ceased to exist after that but historians consider these five institutions as informal branches sharing a common history. During [[World War II]] over 3,000 professors, students and institute employees joined the Army. Evacuated to [[Krasnoufimsk]] and [[Chirchiq]], the institute continued training engineering staff; it also solved serious scientific problems related to strengthening national defense (such as contributing to tank-design work spearheaded by [[Alexander Alexandrovich Morozov|Alexander Morozov]], one of the key engineers in [[T-34]] design). In 1949 four higher-educational institutions (the institutes for mechanical machine-engineering, chemical technology, electrical technology and the institute of the cement industry) were reunited into the Kharkiv V.I.Lenin Polytechnic Institute. Professor Mikhail Semko was appointed its rector, and remained in this position for 30 years.\n\nAfter [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt#Disintegration of the USSR|the fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, KhPI continued its work as a Ukrainian institution of higher learning. In April 1994, the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine]] granted Kharkiv Polytechnic Institute university status and it was renamed the Kharkiv State Polytechnic University (KhSPU). In September 2000, the status of National Technical University has been given to KhSPU, by decree of the [[President of Ukraine]]; since then, it has had its current name (NTU \"KhPI\"). In February 2010, NTU \"KhPI\" was granted the status of Autonomous Research National University by  decree of the Ukrainian Cabinet of Ministers.\n\n== {{anchor|Current status}}Status ==\n\nNTU \"KhPI\" has been accredited as a university of the highest (IV) level. It trains full-time students in 91 fields and offers 69 fields for instruction by [[Distance education|correspondence]]. It has the greatest number of matriculated students in eastern and southern Ukraine (4,377 places for full-time students and over 4,000 places for correspondence students). The university has 21 full-time departments, departments for correspondence and new full-time students, a center for foreign students, an inter-branch institute for advanced studies and three research and design institutes. It prepares specialists in the fields of machine-building, automation, [[electrical engineering]], electronics, [[chemical engineering]], control systems, [[management]], [[computer science]], [[software engineering]] and business.\n\n==Campuses and buildings==\nThe university consists of approximately 20 buildings. Most campuses are concentrated compactly \u2014 between \"Pushkinskaya\" and \"Architect Beketov\" underground stations. Campuses have changed shape over time. Old buildings were built, as usual in the 19th century, and functioned from the very inception of the institute. They are built of red brick and are of great architectural and even historical value. New buildings were built in the Soviet era and their dimensions correspond to concrete houses built at that time. They were built during 1960-1980s.\nThere are two campuses in the university: main campus, where most of auditory and administrative buildings are situated and dormitory campus with not only student dormitories but with Student Palace \u2014 place for solemn events and student arts study groups training, and with Sports Complex.\nAmong educational and administrative buildings there are: Main Building (residence of Rector's Office and some administrative services), Educational Buildings U-1 and U-2, Main Classroom Building, Chemistry building, Physics Building, Mathematics Building, Radio-electronic Building, Electrotechnical Building, Engineering Building, Technical Building, Computing Centre and Library Building.\n\n===Campus U-1===\nU-1 is the highest building and one of the largest in the university. The body has a rectangular shape at the base. It has a large area of glazing (*). It is the tallest in the university and one of the tallest buildings in the city \u2014 besides, it is located on top of a hill. You can see much of the city from there: all Nagirnyy region and adjacent neighbors, Holodna Gora, Saltovka, Novi doma. This building was commissioned in 1974. There are six elevators, including two high-speed, which start to function 10 minutes before the lectures start and stop when they begin. There are two stairwells. U-1 has many departments, dean offices and classrooms.\n*Height: 60 m\n*Number of floors: 14\n*Year of completion: 1974\n\n===Campus U-2===\nU-2 is the second highest and the largest building of the university. As with U-1, it was built during the period of mass construction and in the typical style. Its shape is rectangular; it is linked by an underground passage with the Physical campus building. The architectural design is more interesting than U-1, for example, the staircase is paved with marble. As in U-1, there are four elevators. The building has eight floors including a basement which is used for education. (U-1 has a basement but, unlike U-2, it's for storage.)\n\nThe building includes a department of general and experimental physics along with many other departments. The university entrance examination commission, offices of the university newspapers and the cafeteria are housed there. Physical condition of the campus is relatively good. One of the university computer labs local is here. The first floor of the building is occupied by the student government \"Student Alliance\" of NTU \"KhPI\"\n*Height: 32\u201334 m\n*Number of floors: 7 (8 with the basement)\n*Year of completing: 1982\n\n===Central part of Main Classroom Building===\nMCB (Main Classroom Building) is the largest of the old buildings of the institute. It is lined with brick and was constructed in the second half of the 19th century. The building contains a number of departments, dean offices and other classrooms. The building is rectangular with two interior courtyards. There are a library and reading room. The classic design of the stairs is the main architectural feature of the building. It has three floors, with high ceilings whose height is 4.5 meters. The building has a large basement.\n\nFor a long time it was used as the main building of the University (until building of U-1 and U-2). During its long existence (over 100 years) many famous people worked there. There are memorial plaques at the main entrance of the building in their honor. The Memorial built in honor of Polytechnicians, who died during the Great Patriotic War is opposite the building. The building itself has a lot of art work showing the life of the institute in different eras and a wall commemorating the heroes of the Great Patriotic War. The outside part of the building has rich architectural decoration.\n*Height: 17 m\n*Number of floors: 3\n*Year of completing: 1885\n\n===Sports Complex===\nThe Sports complex of the NTU \"KhPI\" is a building separate from the campus in the Kharkiv Youth's park (close to Pushkinskaya subway station, apart from other university buildings). It is built of cement blocks. It is a relatively new building built in the 1980s. The Sports complex has a lot of rooms, gyms and sport objects including an Olympic-size pool. It is equipped with modern changing rooms and shower facilities. Athletic competitions between NTU \"KhPI\" students and students of other universities take place here. Also the NTU \"KhPI\" students' physical education classes are held here. The Sports complex is one of the best buildings in the city and at the university. It is the second large building of university campus after U-2 (2nd Educational building). The building shape is not uniform as it is more geared toward functionality. The lobby is decorated by two trophy-cases containing awards, won by NTU \"KhPI\" sportsmen.\n\nThe university has unique sports facilities, which in certain sports granted the status of the Center of Olympic training. Athletes successfully defend the honor of the university in competitions at the highest level. In total during 2005 to 2011 in the competition of the European level they won 46 gold, 33 silver and 62 bronze awards. In world competitions they won 36 gold, 20 silver and 19 bronze awards.\n\n===Radio-electronic building (modern name: NTU \"KhPI\" Center for Integrated Technologies)===\nThe Radio-electronic building (\"NTU KhPI Center for Integrated Technologies\") is a four-floor cement building, with a basement. It is one of the new university's buildings. In this rather small building are housed laboratories, equipment and computer classes. The ground floor windows are protected with grates. Including a basement it is a five-storey building. There is a freight elevator. Floors are connected with big panoramic staircases. Among the university buildings, which were built during Soviet years in the 1960s\u20131970s, this one has the lowest number of floors. The research institute is on the second and third floors. The building also houses the Institute of Ionosphere of NAS, the Ministry of Education and the offices of Youth and Sport of Ukraine.\n*Height : 16 m\n*Number of stores: 4 (5 with basement)\n*Completion of construction: 1960s and '70s\n\n===Chemistry building is one of the oldest in the university===\nThe Chemistry building is the second in size and importance of the old buildings of the university. It was built in the middle of 19th century along with the Main Academic building. Most chemical laboratories and dean's office of the Organic Substances Technology Faculty are located in the building. Like the Main Academic building it is square shaped with an enclosed court in the centre.\n\nOn the second floor of the building is the Great Chemical Auditorium, one of the largest in the institute. The building has two entrances: external and internal. The addition of two floors marred the building's classic design.\n*Height: 18 m\n*Number of floors: 4 (sometimes 3)\n*Completion of construction: Second half \u2013 the end of 19th century.\n\n===Electrotechnical building===\nThe Electrotechnical building of NTU \"KhPI\" has the most students. In the past this building was an independent Electrotechnical institute, separated from Kharkiv Technical Institute. It was designed by the architect Beketov in 1930 and is an example of architectural constructivism. Technical departments and dean's offices are located in the building. The Electrotechnical building is one of the largest in the university; it has several entrances and exits as well as the main one.\n\nAfter the war during the process of reconstruction, the main entrance of the building was designed as a colonnade in the architectural style of Stalin's Empire. The building plays an important role in the life of NTU \"KhPI\". Different events and funerals for honored people of the university take place in front of the map of electrification and before the statue of Lenin.\n\n== {{anchor|Faculties and branches}}Departments and satellite campus ==\n[[Image:Politeknik building, Kharkiv, c 1900.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Main Administrative Building, circa 1900|alt=Tinted photo of main administration building, about 1900]]\n*  Department of computer science and management\n*  Department of computer and information technologies\n*  Department of mechanical engineering\n*  Department of power-plant engineering\n*  Department of transport engineering\n*  Department of economics\n*  Department of business and finance\n*  Department of physics and technology\n*  Department of electric power\n*  Department of electric-power engineering\n*  Department of instrument-making\n*  Department of inorganic-substance technology\n*  Department of organic-substance technology\n*  Department of chemical machine engineering\n*  Department of economics and law\n*  Department of business management\n*  Department of military education (formerly the Kharkiv Higher Tank Command School)\n*  [[Chernivtsi]] campus\n\n== {{anchor|Notable alumni and former students|Notable former employees}}Notable alumni and faculty ==\n* [[Nikolay Beketov]], Russian physical chemist\n* Petr Budnikov, Soviet chemist (chemistry of silicates){{fact|date=February 2020}}\n* [[Lev Davidovich Belkind|Lev Belkind]], Soviet power engineer and science historian\n* [[Chelpan Konstantin Fyodorovich|Konstantin Chelpan]], chief designer of the [[T-34|T-34 tank]] engine\n* [[Marharyta Dorozhon]], Israeli javelin thrower<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baku2015.com/athletes/athlete=dorozhon-margaryta-1004036/index.html?intcmp=athletes-hub|title=Baku 2015 1St European Games \u2013 Athletes \u2013 DOROZHON Margaryta|work=Baku 2015}}</ref>\n* [[Mikhail Gurevich (aircraft designer)|Mikhail Gurevich]], Soviet aircraft designer\n* [[Leonid Krasin]], Russian  and Soviet Bolshevik politician and diplomat\n* [[Hnat Khotkevych]], Ukrainian cultural figure\n* [[Lev Landau]], Soviet physicist, [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize]] winner (1962)\n* Alexander Morozov, Soviet tank designer, long-time head of [[Morozov Design Bureau]], one of the key persons responsible for T-34 tank and its successors{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n* [[Alexey Oleynik]] Ukrainian-Russian professional [[mixed martial artist]], two-time world champion in combat sambo, current [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] Heavyweight<ref>{{cite web|title=Alexey Oleynik UFC Bio|url=http://www.ufc.com/fighter/Oleksiy-Oliynyk|accessdate=8 August 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Leonid Pastur]], Ukrainian physicist and mathematician.\n* [[Nikolai Pylchykov]], KhPI professor, practical physicist, inventor of radio remote control and photovoltaic effect\n* [[Vladimir Steklov (mathematician)|Vladimir Steklov]], Soviet/Russian  mathematician and physicist\n* [[Leon Theremin]], Soviet inventor, creator of the [[theremin]], the first [[electronic musical instrument]]\n* Anton Valter, Soviet nuclear physicist, one of the founders of the Ukrainian Institute of Physics and Technology, the first nuclear physics research facility in Ukraine{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n* [[Sergiy Vilkomir]], Ukrainian-born computer scientist\n* [[Iona Yakir]], Red Army commander and military reformer\n\n==Honorable doctors==\nThe first doctors of honor of NTU \"KhPI\" were distinguished scientist such as Professors D.I.

However, not every uprising was violent. In September 1795, over two hundred natives, including many old neophytes, simply deserted San Francisco all in different directions.<ref name=\":1\" /> When uprisings occurred, the natives did not go unpunished: some Indians were put to death. The padres treated Indians and Native Americans as slaves.\n\n== Mexican rule ==\nFrom 1821 to 1846, after Mexico gained its independence from Spain, California was under Mexican rule. In 1824, the Mexican constitution guaranteed citizenship to all persons, providing natives with the right to continue occupying their villages. Additionally, the [[Congress of the Union|Mexican National Congress]] passed the [[General Colonization Law|Colonization Act of 1824]] which granted large sections of unoccupied land to individuals. This act enforced a class division in which Native Americans were treated like slaves because the native Californians became the labor force for these ranchos.  In 1833, the government [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|secularized missions]], saying that the missions needed to give their land to catholic Indians.<ref name=\":1\" /> Instead of doing that, however, many civil authorities confiscated most of the land for themselves. Californios often gained prominence by conducting military attacks on indigenous settlements. By 1846, Mexico's Assembly had passed resolutions calling for funds to locate and destroy Indian villages.\n\nWhile they had more rights than they had under Spanish rule, the native population still was the labor force for ranchos or in developing towns. Essentially, the entire economy shifted from work on the missions to work on large land estates of wealthy Mexicans.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== California genocide ==\n{{See also|Slavery among Native Americans in the United States}}\n[[Image:Native California population graph.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Native California Population, according to Cook 1978.]]\n\nAnglo-American settlers had begun flooding California from the 1820s and, following a brief period of independence, California was officially acquired by the United States in 1848, bringing in more Anglo immigrants due to the gold rush. Although the indigenous population of California under Spanish rule dropped from 300,000 prior to 1769, to 250,000 in 1834, this was primarily due to contact with Old World diseases and assimilation. After gaining independence from Spain in 1821 and the secularization of the coastal missions by the Mexican government in 1834, the indigenous population suffered a much more drastic decrease in population. Indeed, the period immediately following the U.S. conquest of California has been characterized by numerous sources as a genocide. Under US sovereignty, after 1848, the Indian population plunged from perhaps 150,000 to 30,000 in 1870 and reached a low of 16,000 in 1900.<ref name=Madley></ref><ref name=\"PBS\">{{cite web |title=California Genocide |url=https://www.pbs.org/indiancountry/history/calif.html |website=[[PBS]] |accessdate=December 14, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe Anglo-Americans came in with an initial dislike of the Native Americans, hating and fearing them for no historical reason.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Humor and Dissonance in California's Native American Genocide.

Eventually, 18 treaties were drafted, allocating 7.5% of the state of California to Indians in reservations, but forcing them to give up the rest of their land. In June 1852, however, all of the treaties were rejected by the Senate and then put into secret files; they were not to be seen again until 1905.

The padres treated Indians and Native Americans as slaves.\n\n== Mexican rule ==\nFrom 1821 to 1846, after Mexico gained its independence from Spain, California was under Mexican rule. In 1824, the Mexican constitution guaranteed citizenship to all persons, providing natives with the right to continue occupying their villages. Additionally, the [[Congress of the Union|Mexican National Congress]] passed the [[General Colonization Law|Colonization Act of 1824]] which granted large sections of unoccupied land to individuals. This act enforced a class division in which Native Americans were treated like slaves because the native Californians became the labor force for these ranchos.  In 1833, the government [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|secularized missions]], saying that the missions needed to give their land to catholic Indians.<ref name=\":1\" /> Instead of doing that, however, many civil authorities confiscated most of the land for themselves. Californios often gained prominence by conducting military attacks on indigenous settlements. By 1846, Mexico's Assembly had passed resolutions calling for funds to locate and destroy Indian villages.\n\nWhile they had more rights than they had under Spanish rule, the native population still was the labor force for ranchos or in developing towns. Essentially, the entire economy shifted from work on the missions to work on large land estates of wealthy Mexicans.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== California genocide ==\n{{See also|Slavery among Native Americans in the United States}}\n[[Image:Native California population graph.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Native California Population, according to Cook 1978.]]\n\nAnglo-American settlers had begun flooding California from the 1820s and, following a brief period of independence, California was officially acquired by the United States in 1848, bringing in more Anglo immigrants due to the gold rush. Although the indigenous population of California under Spanish rule dropped from 300,000 prior to 1769, to 250,000 in 1834, this was primarily due to contact with Old World diseases and assimilation. After gaining independence from Spain in 1821 and the secularization of the coastal missions by the Mexican government in 1834, the indigenous population suffered a much more drastic decrease in population. Indeed, the period immediately following the U.S. conquest of California has been characterized by numerous sources as a genocide. Under US sovereignty, after 1848, the Indian population plunged from perhaps 150,000 to 30,000 in 1870 and reached a low of 16,000 in 1900.<ref name=Madley></ref><ref name=\"PBS\">{{cite web |title=California Genocide |url=https://www.pbs.org/indiancountry/history/calif.html |website=[[PBS]] |accessdate=December 14, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nThe Anglo-Americans came in with an initial dislike of the Native Americans, hating and fearing them for no historical reason.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Humor and Dissonance in California's Native American Genocide.

Once the Indians had entered into this servitude, the term limit was often ignored, thus resulting in slavery; this was what Californians used to \"satisfy the states high demand for domestic servants and agricultural laborers\".<ref name=\":2\" /> [[List of Governors of California before admission#Republic, 1846\u20131850|Acting Governor]] [[Richard B.

Eventually, 18 treaties were drafted, allocating 7.5% of the state of California to Indians in reservations, but forcing them to give up the rest of their land. In June 1852, however, all of the treaties were rejected by the Senate and then put into secret files; they were not to be seen again until 1905.
