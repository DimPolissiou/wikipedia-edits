They form a part of the [[Australian Greens]].\n\nThe party is currently led by [[Cassy O'Connor]] in the [[Parliament of Tasmania]], with O'Connor and [[Rosalie Woodruff]] as its only two MPs in the [[Tasmanian House of Assembly|House of Assembly]]. At federal level, two Tasmanian senators \u2013 [[Nick McKim]] and [[Peter Whish-Wilson]] \u2013 are members of the Greens.\n\n==History==\nThe party's history can be traced back to the formation of the [[United Tasmania Group]] (UTG) (the first established 'Green' party in the world), which first ran candidates in the 1972 election. Many people involved in that group went on to form the Tasmanian Greens. [[Bob Brown]] stood as an Australian Senate candidate for UTG in 1975.\n\n===1980s===\nIn the [[1982 Tasmanian state election|1982 state election]], Bob Brown stood unsuccessfully as an independent in the [[Division of Denison (state)|Denison]] electorate. In December of that year, [[Norm Sanders]]\u2014a sitting member for the [[Australian Democrats]]\u2014stood down from state parliament to contest the Senate in a Federal election. A countback of votes followed and Bob Brown was elected to the vacancy, commencing his term in January 1983. The two had much in common\u2014both having been directors of the [[Tasmanian Wilderness Society]]\u2014Norm Sanders being considered to be Australia's first elected \"green\" member of parliament.\n\nImmediately prior to taking the seat, Bob Brown had spent 19 days in Risdon Prison for obstructing workers at the Franklin River dam site. He took his seat on the day of his release. He was re-elected in the [[1986 Tasmanian state election|1986 election]] along with [[Gerry Bates]] in the [[Division of Franklin (state)|Franklin]] electorate.\n\nIn the [[1989 Tasmanian state election|1989 state election]] a total of 5 Greens\u2014[[Christine Milne]], [[Lance Armstrong (politician)|Lance Armstrong]], [[Di Hollister]], [[Gerry Bates]] and Bob Brown\u2014were elected after a community backlash against a proposed paper pulp mill at Wesley Vale, near [[Devonport, Tasmania|Devonport]]. At the time of the election they were known simply as The Independents. In December 1991 they changed their name to The Green Independents. They held the balance of power in the government for three years, keeping [[Michael Field (Australian politician)|Michael Field]]'s minority [[Australian Labor Party (Tasmanian Branch)|Labor Party]] government in power after signing an agreement known as the [[Labor\u2013Green Accord]]. The [[1992 Tasmanian state election|February 1992 election]] saw all five sitting Greens re-elected but with a majority Liberal government in power.\n\nGreens supporter [[Neville Curtis]] started the magazine ''Daily Planet'' in 1989,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1776679 |title=The Daily planet &#124; National Library of Australia |publisher=Catalogue.nla.gov.au |accessdate=1 February 2011}}</ref> which later became the official magazine of the Green Independents.\n\n===1990s===\nIn August 1992 the Green Independents moved to officially form the Tasmanian Greens.\n\nIn 1993 Bob Brown stood down to contest the lower house seat of [[Division of Denison|Denison]] in the federal election and [[Peg Putt]] took his seat on a recount. Christine Milne became leader. In May 1995 Gerry Bates resigned and his seat was taken by [[Mike Foley (Australian politician)|Mike Foley]].\n\nAt the [[1996 Tasmanian state election|1996 election]], four Greens were returned (Lance Armstrong lost his seat in [[Division of Bass (state)|Bass]]) and they again held the balance of power, this time with a Liberal government.\n\nAfter seven years of minority governments, the Labor and Liberal parties passed a bill reducing the number of Lower House seats, thus increasing the quota of votes needed under Tasmania's [[Single Transferable Vote|Hare Clark]] voting system from 12.5% to 16.67%. In 2011, Labor MP [[David Llewellyn (Australian politician)|David Llewellyn]] confirmed to ABC Radio that the two major parties had \"conspired\" to reduce the number of seats in the House specifically to increase the quota for minor parties such as the Greens: \"I could admit now that being part of the government back in 1998 or 1997 in conspiring, suppose that's not the best of words but that's what it was, between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party to reduce the size of Parliament on the basis that it would take more percentage for minor parties to actually win a seat.\"<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/05/13/3215955.htm Labor stalwart urges Bartlett's early exit], ABC News, 13 May 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[1998 Tasmanian state election|1998 election]] returned a majority Labor government, as well as a sole Green member\u2014Peg Putt\u2014who had little chance of exercising any influence, but would offer bills into Parliament knowing they would in all likelihood be voted against by both Liberal and Labor parties.\n\n===2000s===\nThe [[2002 Tasmanian state election|2002 election]] saw a major resurgence of their popularity, with the party winning 4 seats, and outpolling the Liberal party in the [[Hobart]] based seat of [[Division of Denison (state)|Denison]].  The swing was primarily against the Liberal Party, while the Labor party continued in the majority. The statewide 18.2% vote in 2002 was the highest vote recorded for a Green party at a state or national level anywhere in the world.\n\nAt the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 federal election]], former Tasmanian Greens leader Christine Milne and WA's [[Rachel Siewert]] joined Bob Brown and NSW's [[Kerry Nettle]] in the Senate, doubling the Green representation.\n\nOn 23 July 2005 the Greens celebrated 33.3 years of political activity and achievements, with a large party entitled \"33-and-a-third \u2013 Now we're Long Playing!\"\n\nThe [[2006 Tasmanian state election|2006 election]] saw a 1.5% swing against the Greens but all four sitting members were returned.

In 2011, Labor MP [[David Llewellyn (Australian politician)|David Llewellyn]] confirmed to ABC Radio that the two major parties had \"conspired\" to reduce the number of seats in the House specifically to increase the quota for minor parties such as the Greens: \"I could admit now that being part of the government back in 1998 or 1997 in conspiring, suppose that's not the best of words but that's what it was, between the Liberal Party and the Labor Party to reduce the size of Parliament on the basis that it would take more percentage for minor parties to actually win a seat.\"<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2011/05/13/3215955.htm Labor stalwart urges Bartlett's early exit], ABC News, 13 May 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[1998 Tasmanian state election|1998 election]] returned a majority Labor government, as well as a sole Green member\u2014Peg Putt\u2014who had little chance of exercising any influence, but would offer bills into Parliament knowing they would in all likelihood be voted against by both Liberal and Labor parties.\n\n===2000s===\nThe [[2002 Tasmanian state election|2002 election]] saw a major resurgence of their popularity, with the party winning 4 seats, and outpolling the Liberal party in the [[Hobart]] based seat of [[Division of Denison (state)|Denison]].
