{"title_page": "Oxford Centre for Ecclesiology and Practical Theology", "text_new": "{{refimprove|date=August 2017}}\n'''The Oxford Centre for Ecclesiology and Practical Theology'''  (OxCEPT) is a research centre based at [[Ripon College Cuddesdon]]. It was founded in May 2006 by the Principal, [[Martyn Percy]] as a research-led and consultancy body to work with the church, developing ecclesiology and practical theology that enables the church to develop its polity and praxis for mission and ministry. The Centre initially worked through appointing Research Fellows who were funded by external grants.  Initial funded research projects included a detailed ethnographic survey of a midlands diocese in the Church of England, exploring the dynamics of mission and ministry; and a fully-funded evaluation of the \u2018Fresh Expressions\u2019 movement.\n\nThe Centre\u2019s first full-time Director was Dr Helen Cameron, appointed in 2007.  The post was generously funded by a supporter and benefactor, who shared the vision of the Centre.  Dr Cameron subsequently shaped the Centre as a focussed and dedicated research and consultancy body that sought to \u2018think with the church\u2019.  The Centre now has a vision for developing the life and mission of the church by attending to God\u2019s work in the world in order to develop faithful and reflective practice.  People connect with the Centre to collaborate and engage in strategic thinking, to develop resources, to do research \u2013 all with the aim of transforming practice.\n\nDr Cameron was succeeded as Director by the Rt. Revd. Professor [[Stephen Pickard]] (interim Director, 2011). The current Director is the renowned missiologist, Dr Cathy Ross, originally from New Zealand.  The Patrons of OxCEPT are The Rt. Revd John Pritchard, Bishop of Oxford and Dr [[Paula Gooder]].\n\nSince its foundation in 2006, OxCEPT has generated over half a million pounds (GB) for research-led and consultancy-based initiatives with the churches, making it one of the most successful and high-profile bodies of its kind in theological education in the UK.  OxCEPT\u2019s approach is through praxis-based research, offering consultancy and producing publications.  It helps people to network by bringing together parishes, dioceses, mission agencies and other faith-based organisations.  It is intentionally ecumenical.  The work is praxis-orientated as well as independent and constructively critical.  In addition to the specific research at the local and national level, OxCEPT is thoroughly embedded in the wider research culture of Ripon College Cuddesdon, where there is a particular expertise in mission, ecclesiology, ecumenism, Anglicanism, and Biblical hermeneutics.  \n\nNotable work undertaken by OxCEPT has included several research projects, including the report on Fresh Expressions commissioned by the Church Urban Fund which particularly focused on emerging forms of church in deprived communities. ARCS (Action Research in Church and Society) was jointly pioneered by OxCEPT and Heythrop College (University of London), one outcome of which was the \u2018Living Church in the Global City\u2019 report which investigated the mission outreach of the church and church-related groups.  \u2018Sustaining Leaders in Mission and Change\u2019 was a significant report into the ministry and resourcing of Archdeacons in the Church of England. There has also been significant research into the spirituality of older people.  OxCEPT also has a specialist interest in researching and resourcing chaplaincy practice, in all its manifestations, as well as highlighting its role in the church today.  It also has a specialist interest in world Christianity and its significance for the church today.\n\nThere are several strands to OxCEPT\u2019s work besides the research that serves both the contemporary church and the academic sphere.  It also aims to foster a vibrant learning and research community among the students at Ripon College Cuddesdon during their time in training and beyond.  \n\nConsultancy work is also undertaken for churches, denominations, dioceses and mission agencies.  This is usually a process by which a range of experts and some skilled researchers assist an individual, group or organisation to analyse and reflect upon their work.  OxCEPT provides consultancy services and support to enable the church to reflect on practice.  \n\nOxCEPT also helps with the professional development and continuing ministerial development of clergy, by fostering research capacity through offering sabbaticals, seminars and educational events.  OxCEPT hosts regular public seminars at Ripon College Cuddesdon on issues of interest to students in training and the wider church.  Theological Reflection (TR) is at the core of all OxCEPT\u2019s research methods.  This comprises a range of methods for investigating and supporting groups as they articulate their espoused theology, and compare it with their operant theology.

It began as the project of a group of engineering students in 1949, who first used the electrical wiring in a few academic buildings to broadcast a weak AM signal to campus buildings for several hours a day. In 1950, WRCT, which stands for Radio Carnegie Tech, covered half the buildings on campus, and became an official student organization.<ref>McCoy, Adrian. \"WYEP, WRCT plan anniversary specials.\" Post-Gazette.com.

In the late 1980s, the power increased to 100 watts, and in 1994, WRCT received permission to increase power to 1,750 watts in the north, south, and west and 680 watts in the east, which enabled it to be heard up to 15 miles away, allowing it to become a more significant community service.

DJs, producers, engineers and staff consist of both community members, as well as undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty and staff who are connected to the school.  Participation includes a range of skill levels, from freshmen DJs who are just learning about the stations' programming to veteran DJs who have years of experience on the air and a dedicated following.  All of these positions are volunteer and nonprofit.  For anyone to get involved, they must simply call the station or e-mail the training director.\n\n==Programming==\nWRCT's programs, updated each semester, are available online at their [http://wrct.org/schedule program guide].\n\n===Music===\nWRCT's mission is to present its listening audience with [[freeform (radio format)|freeform]], original programming that cannot be found elsewhere on the Pittsburgh dial.  As such, the station's musical programming is widely varied, and with few exceptions, left entirely to the tastes of the on-air DJs.  Genres including [[Alt-Country]], [[Jazz]], [[Hip hop]], [[Heavy metal music|Metal]], [[Experimental music|Experimental]], [[Indie rock]], [[Blues]], International, [[Electronic music|Electronic]], and even [[Musical Theater]] are among those commonly represented in rotation. They try to show off local music that people do not typically hear on mainstream stations.

Web. 3 Feb. 2012. http://www.popcitymedia.com/features/wrct1112.aspx</ref>\n\nNow the station has expanded to serve beyond the campus, it also allows participation from outside the university.  DJ's, producers, engineers and staff consist of both community members, as well as undergraduate students, graduate students, faculty and staff who are connected to the school.  Participation includes a range of skill levels, from freshmen DJ's who are just learning about the stations' programming to veteran DJ's who have years of experience on the air and a dedicated following.  All of these positions are volunteer and nonprofit.  For anyone to get involved, they must simply call the station or e-mail the training director.\n\n==Programming==\nWRCT's programs, updated each semester, are available online at their [http://wrct.org/schedule program guide].\n\n===Music===\nWRCT's mission is to present its listening audience with [[freeform (radio format)|freeform]], original programming that cannot be found elsewhere on the Pittsburgh dial.  As such, the station's musical programming is widely varied, and with few exceptions, left entirely to the tastes of the on-air DJs.  Genres including [[Alt-Country]], [[Jazz]], [[Hip hop]], [[Heavy metal music|Metal]], [[Experimental music|Experimental]], [[Indie rock]], [[Blues]], International, [[Electronic music|Electronic]], and even [[Musical Theater]] are among those commonly represented in rotation. They try to show off local music that people do not typically hear on mainstream stations.  They do their best to play \u201cCreative beats, conscious lyrics and fresh styles from up-and-comers who just plain aren't getting heard about because they don't fit the formula\u201d.<ref>Levy, Doug. \u201cOwen Carmichael.\u201d CMJ New Music Report, n.d. https://books.google.com/books?id=vrIO1R87sXIC&pg=PA28&dq=wrct+carnegie+mellon+radio&hl=en&sa=X&ei=MDMrT5j9L8figgeIn-HxDw&ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=wrct%20carnegie%20mellon%20radio&f=false</ref>\n\n===Public affairs===\nWRCT broadcasts much more than just music.  [[public affairs (broadcasting)|Public affairs]] programming also features prominently at the station, with an emphasis on news and issues local to the Pittsburgh community.  WRCT is Pittsburgh's [[Pacifica Radio]] affiliate station.  These ideas that are broadcast generally would not be on the radio anywhere else.\n\nCurrent public affairs programming at WRCT includes the following original programs:\n\n*[[Rustbelt Radio]]: The Pittsburgh [[Independent Media Center|Independent Media Center's]] weekly round-up of \"News From The Grassroots\" in which these volunteers report on issues overlooked by the local mainstream media\n*[[The Saturday Light Brigade]]: Award Winning Public Radio for Kids & Adults\n*History for the Future: Explores the history behind contemporary social issues through interviews with academics and journalists.\n*Brazilian Radio Hour or Cantinho Brasileiro no Radio - The program is broadcast in English and Portuguese and brings Brazilian music as well as unique themes, news, event information, promotions and special interviews.

The station's own DJs provided the music in both rooms.  The bash went from 9p.m. until 2 a.m. with an admission price of only $5.  The lineup at AVA consisted of Zombo, Jason the Underwater Culprit, [[Shawn Watson]], J. Malls and DJ Thermos, and the Shadow Lounge consisted of It's Tina, Kimmy+Sandi, DJ Sanspoof, Arsenal+JTS and DJ Firefly. The Shadow Lounge's Blue Room also included performances by [[Steve Boyle (radio host)|Steve Boyle]] of \"Radio Free Radio\" and Alex and Sal.

Other reporters include(d) [[Jojanneke van den Berge]], [[Jan Roos (journalist)|Jan Roos]] (also presenter of the radio programme ''Echte Jannen'' with Jan Dijkgraaf) and [[Daan Nieber]].

It featured [[Ajith Kumar]], [[Prashanth (actor)|Prashanth]], [[Devayani (actress)|Devayani]] and [[Pooja Bhatt]] in the lead roles.\n\n==Plot==\nVasanth ([[Ajith Kumar]]) and Sathya ([[Prashanth (actor) |Prashanth]]) are best friends since childhood. [[Manivannan]] is working under Sathya's mother and he wants his daughter Pooja ([[Pooja Bhatt]]) to marry Sathya so that he would be wealthy for the rest of his life. For this he makes many tricks and pranks to make them walk together alone, to go for a ride and many more. On Vasanth's birthday Sathya goes to wish him but he denies his wish and says his birthday means nothing to him anymore. Simultaneously Sathya's mother decides that her son is to marry Pooja and the engagement day arrives. Without informing her, when she enters the house as all the other guests did, Manivannan insists that she wear the engagement saree. Knowing the situation she leaves the place crying and Sathya follows her. In the middle of the street he shouts at her and asks the reason why she can't marry him. She immediately shows her [[Mangala sutra]] (wedding thread) which she has hidden from everyone and reveals that she is already married.\n\nFlashback begins with Nivetha ([[Devayani (actress)|Devayani]]) and Pooja being best friends from school and on the first day of college Nivetha meets Vasanth and falls in love. Unaware of this, Pooja and Vasanth loved each other. When Pooja came to know about the love of her friend for Vasanth, she decided to sacrifice her love. On Vasanth's birthday she denied her love for him and quickly he forcefully married her. Seeing this, Nivetha committed suicide before their eyes. Pooja got separated from Vasanth thinking that he was the reason behind her friend's death.\n\nAfter knowing this Sathya goes on to have a fight with Vasanth. But after knowing the truth, Sathya decides to sacrifice his love for Pooja and decides to unite Vasanth and Pooja. On a cultural day when Sathya, Vasanth and Pooja give a combined performance, the opposite gang led by Manivannan makes a vengeful plan against Vasanth and stabs him. The blame is then put on Sathya who ends up in jail. When Pooja sees her husband get hurt, she forgets everything and starts to cry for him.

As British [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], from 1812 he was central to the management of the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|coalition]] that defeated [[Napoleon]]. He was the principal British diplomat at the [[Congress of Vienna]]. Castlereagh was also [[leader of the House of Commons|leader of the British House of Commons]] in the [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Liverpool]] government from 1812 until his suicide. Early in his career, as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], he was involved in putting down the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] and was instrumental in securing the passage of the [[Acts of Union 1800|Irish Act of Union of 1800]].\n\nCastlereagh's challenge at the foreign office was to organise and finance an alliance to destroy Napoleon. He successfully brought Napoleon's enemies together at the [[Treaty of Chaumont]] in 1814. Thereafter he worked with Europe's leaders at the Congress of Vienna to provide a peace consistent with the conservative mood of the day. At Vienna he was largely successful in his primary goal of creating a peace settlement that would endure for years. He saw that a harsh treaty based on vengeance and retaliation against France would fail, and anyway the conservative Bourbons were back in power. He employed his diplomatic skills to block harsh terms.  He held the Chaumont allies together, most notably in their determination to finally end Napoleon's 100 Days in 1815. He had a vision of long-term peace in Europe that united efforts of the great powers. At the same time he was watchful of Britain's mercantile and imperial interests. He purchased the Cape Colony and Ceylon from the Netherlands. France's colonies were returned, but France had to give up all its gains in Europe after 1791. In 1820 he enunciated a policy that Britain would not intervene in European affairs \u2013 a policy that was largely adopted down to 1900.\n\nAs the Irish Secretary during the Rebellion of 1798, he took the lead in suppressing the rebellion and restoring order. Castlereagh encouraged lenient treatment of the rebels after they surrendered, but many Irish denounced him as a traitor. Criticism increased when he supported Pitt's Act of Union which abolished the Irish Parliament. Castlereagh was a consistent supporter of Catholic emancipation. In 1805 he became the Secretary of State for war{{sfn|Wills|1817|p=[https://archive.org/details/livesofillustrio06willuoft/page/128/ 128]|ps=: \"In 1806, he was appointed secretary at war and for the colonies.\"}} and proved to be highly effective in reforming recruitment, and securing the appointment of Arthur Wellesley as commander in Spain. He resigned in 1809 after government splits and an unsuccessful war. He then fought a duel with George Canning, a fellow Tory; they both survived. With intense devotion to multiple duties from both the foreign office and as leader of Commons, he was badly overworked. He came under deep psychological distress in 1822, fearing exposure of homosexuality. Castlereagh committed suicide just before he was to represent Britain at an international Congress\n\nAfter 1815 Castlereagh was the leader in imposing repressive measures at home. He was hated for his harsh attacks on liberty and reform. [[John Bew (historian)|John Bew]] stresses the paradox:\n:No British statesman of the 19th century reached the same level of international influence....But very few have been so maligned by their own countrymen and so abused in history. This shy and handsome Ulsterman is perhaps the most hated domestic political figure in both modern British and Irish political history.<ref>John Bew, \"Castlereagh: enlightened conservative\" ''History Today'', (2011) 61#11</ref>\n\n==Birth and origins==\nRobert was born on 18 June 1769 in 28 Henry Street, in [[Dublin]]'s [[Northside, Dublin|Northside]].{{sfn|Bew|2012|p=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DyTg672rGTMC&pg=PA6 6]|ps=: \"On 18 June 1769 ...

Between Stewart's attendance to his militia duties, his pursuit of cultural, family and political interests in London, two trips to the Continent (in 1791, when he visited revolutionary Paris, and 1792), and the courtship of his wife whom he married in 1794, his life during this period was not centred on the activities of the Irish House of Commons, where he was listened to with respect but where he was not yet an important player. He was also beginning to disappoint some of his more radical original supporters in his constituency. As the [[French Revolution#National Convention (1792\u20131795)|French Revolution]] grew more bloody and Ireland more rebellious, Stewart increasingly worried about Ireland's future if the threats from France succeeded in breaking Ireland's links to Britain.

Camden's arrival in Dublin was greeted with riots, and that year Stewart crossed the floor to join the supporters of the British Government.{{efn|name=War}} Stewart became an essential adviser to the inexperienced and unpopular Lord Lieutenant, who was Stewart's senior by only ten years.\n\nIn 1796, when the [[Wolfe Tone#Hoche's expedition and the 1798 rebellion|French invasion of Ireland failed]] at [[Bantry Bay]] due to bad weather and not to Ireland's military preparations or the British Navy, Castlereagh as a leader of the Militia saw at first hand how ripe Ireland was for breaking from Britain and becoming another French satellite. Despairing of obtaining timely military support from Britain if Ireland were again threatened with invasion, for the next several years he was increasingly involved in measures against those promoting a Rising, but his initial principles of reform and emancipation continued to hold a place in his political thought.<ref name=\"Leigh\"/>\n\nIn 1797, Castlereagh was at last appointed to office, as Keeper of the King's Signet for Ireland.{{efn|name=Limavedy}}}} As martial law was declared in the face of growing turmoil, he was made both a [[Lord High Treasurer of Ireland#Commissioners of the Treasury for Ireland (1793-1817)|Lord of the Treasury]] and a Member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]] (1797\u20131800).{{efn|name=Abercromby}} At the urging of Camden, Castlereagh assumed many of the onerous duties of the often-absent [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]] who was responsible for day-to-day administration and asserting the influence of Dublin Castle in the House of Commons.{{efn|name=Ireland}} In this capacity, and after March 1798 as Acting Chief Secretary, Castlereagh played a key role in crushing the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], offering clemency to commoners who had supported the rebellion, and focusing instead on pursuing rebel leaders.\n\nIn 1799, in furtherance of both his own political vision and Pitt's policies, Castlereagh began lobbying in the Irish and British Parliaments for an official union between the two, convinced that it was the best way to soothe the long-standing divides in Ireland, insulate Ireland from further radical disaffection, and protect Britain from French military threats via Ireland. His first attempt, at the opening of the Irish session of 1799, met with failure during long, heated debates. A year of further intense preparation followed, with an impressive display of Machiavellian tactics that included the common practice of bribery through peerages, honours and money, but bribery on a truly uncommon scale. In the summer of 1800, Castlereagh together with the Lord Lieutenant, [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Marquess Cornwallis]], finally succeeded in steering the [[Act of Union 1800|Irish Act of Union]] through both Parliaments.<ref name=\"Leigh\"/><ref name=\"Multitext\"/>\n\nDuring the campaign for the Act of Union, both Castlereagh and Cornwallis had, in good faith, forwarded informal assurances they had received from Pitt's Cabinet to the [[Irish Catholics]] that they would be allowed to sit in Parliament. Both Castlereagh and Cornwallis knew Catholic emancipation would be critical if their objectives for Union were to be realised. Emancipation was, however, opposed by much of the British establishment, including [[George III]], who was convinced that it would violate his royal oath as protector of the Protestant faith. Pitt tried to follow through on his commitment, but when it came to light that the King had approached [[Henry Addington]], an opponent of Catholic emancipation, about becoming Prime Minister to replace the pro-emancipation Pitt, both Castlereagh and Pitt resigned in protest.

At a shift in the composition of [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth#Henry Addington's Government, March 1801 \u2013 May 1804|Addington's Government]], Castlereagh accepted the offer to enter the Cabinet as [[President of the Board of Control]], where he mediated bitter disputes between the [[Governor-General of India]], [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley|Richard Wellesley]], and the [[East India Company directors|Directors]] of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]], smoothing quarrels while generally supporting Lord Wellesley's policies.{{sfn|Bartlett|1966|p=[https://archive.org/details/castlereagh00bart/page/40 41]|ps=: \"Castlereagh found much of his time devoted to the thankless task of acting as a mediator between the influential Court in London and its formidable Governor-General in India, the irascible and autocratic Richard Wellesley.\"}}\n\nAfter the renewal of the [[Napoleonic Wars|war]] against [[Napoleon]], at the urging of Castlereagh and other long-time supporters, in 1804 Pitt returned as Prime Minister, and Castlereagh was promoted to [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]].

Canning saw it as a diversion of troops from the [[Peninsular War]] based on a hopeless plan. However, Castlereagh had the support of Lord Wellesley's younger brother [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|General Arthur Wellesley]] (future Duke of Wellington), and evidence later surfaced that Canning himself had interfered with the plan, selecting the [[John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham|Earl of Chatham]] to command the expedition.<ref name=\"nndb\"/> The Portland government became increasingly paralysed by disputes between the two men.

There was much outrage that two cabinet ministers had resorted to such a method, and they both felt compelled to resign from the government.

The [[Treaty of Chaumont]] was part of the final deal offered to [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1814. Napoleon rejected it and it never took effect. However, the key terms reaffirmed decisions that had been made already. These decisions were again ratified and put into effect by the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814\u20131815. The terms were largely written by Lord Castlereagh, who offered cash subsidies to keep the other armies in the field against Napoleon.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Gregory Fremont-Barnes|author2=Todd Fisher|title=The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j45Rg2VBbRAC&pg=PA302|year=2004|publisher=Osprey Publishing|pages=302\u20135|isbn=9781841768311}}</ref> Key terms included the establishment of a confederated Germany, the division into independent states, the restoration of the Bourbon kings of Spain, and the enlargement of the Netherlands to include what in 1830 became modern Belgium.

It is quite possible that, but for the lead taken by Castlereagh in the allied counsels, France would never have been reduced to her ancient limits, nor Napoleon dethroned.{{sfn|Trevelyan|1922|p=[https://archive.org/details/britishhistoryin00trevuoft/page/132 133]|ps=:as quoted.}}\n\n===Congress of Vienna===\nAt the [[Congress of Vienna]], Castlereagh designed and proposed a form of collective and collaborative security for Europe, then called a [[Congress system]]. In the Congress system, the main signatory powers met periodically (every two years or so) and collectively managed European affairs. This system was used in an attempt to address the [[Congress of Vienna#Polish-Saxon crisis|Polish-Saxon crisis]] at Vienna and the [[Congress of Laibach#Eastern Question|question of Greek independence]] at Laibach. The following ten years saw five European Congresses where disputes were resolved with a diminishing degree of effectiveness. Finally, by 1822, the whole system had collapsed because of the irreconcilable differences of opinion among Britain, Austria, and Russia, and because of the lack of support for the Congress system in British public opinion.  The [[Holy Alliance]], which Castlereagh opposed, lingered a little longer.  The [[Conservative Order|order]] created by the Congress of Vienna was a mood that lasted much longer and worked to prevent major European wars until the [[First World War]] in 1914. Some scholars and historians have seen the Congress system as a forerunner of the modern [[collective security]], international unity, and cooperative agreements of [[NATO]], the EU, the [[League of Nations]], and the United Nations.<ref name=\"Kissinger\">{{cite book |last=Kissinger  |first=Henry  |authorlink=Henry Kissinger  |title=A World Restored: Metternich, Castlereagh and the Problems of Peace, 1812\u201322 }}</ref>\n\nIn the years 1812 to 1822, Castlereagh continued to manage Britain's foreign policy, generally pursuing a policy of continental engagement uncharacteristic of British foreign policy in the nineteenth century. Castlereagh was not an effective public speaker and his diplomatic presentation style was at times abstruse.<ref name=\"nndb\"/> Henry Kissinger says he developed a reputation for integrity, consistency, and goodwill, which was perhaps unmatched by any diplomat of that era.<ref name=\"Kissinger\"/>\n\n===Abolition of the slave trade===\n{{Further|Atlantic slave trade#End of the Atlantic slave trade}}\nAbolitionist opinion in Britain was strong enough in 1807 to abolish the slave trade in all British possessions\u2014although slavery itself persisted in the colonies until 1833.<ref>Seymour Drescher, \"Whose abolition? Popular pressure and the ending of the British slave trade.\" ''Past & Present'' 143 (1994): 136-166. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/651164 Online]</ref> Abolitionists after 1807 focused on international agreements to abolish the Atlantic slave trade. Castlereagh switched his position and became  a strong supporter of the movement.  Britain arranged treaties with Portugal, Sweden and Denmark, 1810\u20131814, whereby they agreed to restrict their trading. These were preliminary to the Congress of Vienna negotiations that Castlereagh dominated and which resulted in a general declaration condemning the slave trade.<ref>Jerome Reich,  \"The Slave Trade at the Congress of Vienna--A Study in English Public Opinion--.\" ''Journal of Negro History'' 53.2 (1968): 129-143. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716488 Online]</ref> The problem was that the treaties and declarations were hard to enforce, given the very high profits available to private interests. As Foreign Minister, Castlereagh cooperated with senior officials to use the Royal Navy to detect and capture slave ships; the freed slaves were sent to freedom in a new British colony of [[History of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone]].  He used diplomacy to make search and seize agreements with all the government whose ships were trading.  There was serious friction with the United States, where the southern slave interest was politically powerful. Washington recoiled at British policing of the high seas.  Spain, France and Portugal also relied on the international slave trade to supply their colonial plantations. As more and more diplomatic arrangements were made by Castlereagh, the owners of slave ships started flying false flags of nations that had not agreed, especially the United States. It was illegal under American law for American ships to engage in the slave trade, but the idea of Britain enforcing American laws was unacceptable to Washington. Lord Palmerston continued the Castlereagh  policies. Eventually, in 1842 in 1845, an arrangement was reached between London and Washington. With the arrival of a staunchly anti-slavery government in Washington in 1861, the Atlantic slave trade was doomed. In the long run, Castlereagh's strategy on how to stifle the trade proved successful.<ref>James C. Duram, \"A Study of Frustration: Britain, the USA, and the African Slave Trade, 1815-1870.\" Social Science (1965): 220-225. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41885111 Online]</ref>\n\n===Nonintervention in European affairs===\nIn May 1820 Castlereagh circulated to high officials a major state paper that set the main British policy for the rest of the century. Temperley and Penson call it, \"the most famous State Paper in British history and the one of the widest ultimate consequences.\"<ref>H.W.V. Temperley, and Lillian M. Penson, eds. ''Foundations of British Foreign Policy: 1792\u20131902'' (1938) Quote page 47, the paper itself pp 48-63.</ref> Castlereagh called for no British intervention in continental affairs.  He argued that the purpose of the Quadruple Alliance was to contain France and put down revolutions. But the Spanish revolt did not threaten European peace nor any of the great powers. Castlereagh said that an actual practice the powers would seldom be able to agree on concerted action, and he pointed out that British public opinion would not support interventions. He admitted that individual states could indeed intervene in affairs in their recognized sphere of interest, such as Austria's intervention in Italy.\n\n==Decline and death==\n[[File:Castlereagh's House.jpg|thumb|right|Castlereagh's house, [[Loring Hall|Woollet Hall]] (now called Loring Hall), in [[North Cray]] in [[Bexley]], south London]]\n[[File:Blue Plaque for the Viscount Castlereagh.jpg|thumb|right|Blue plaque along the North Cray Road]]\n\nDespite his contributions to the defeat of Napoleon and restoration of peace, Castlereagh became extremely unpopular at home. He was attacked for his construction of a peace that gave a free hand to reactionary governments on the Continent to suppress dissent. He was also condemned for his association with repressive measures of the [[Home Secretary]], [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Lord Sidmouth]] (the former Prime Minister Addington).<ref name=\"nndb\"/> As [[Leader of the House of Commons]] for the [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool#Lord Liverpool's Administration (1812\u20131827)|Liverpool Government]], he was often called upon to [[Cabinet collective responsibility|defend government policy]] in the House. He had to support the widely reviled measures taken by Sidmouth and the others, including the infamous [[Six Acts]], to remain in cabinet and continue his diplomatic work. For these reasons, Castlereagh appears with other members of Lord Liverpool's Cabinet in [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]'s poem ''[[The Masque of Anarchy]]'', which was inspired by, and heavily critical of, the [[Peterloo Massacre]]:\n\n:I met Murder on the way \u2013\n:He had a mask like Castlereagh \u2013\n:Very smooth he looked, yet grim;\n:Seven bloodhounds followed him\n\n:All were fat; and well they might\n:Be in admirable plight,\n:For one by one, and two by two,\n:He tossed them human hearts to chew\n:Which from his wide cloak he drew.<ref>{{cite book|author=David C.

Castlereagh was also [[leader of the House of Commons|leader of the British House of Commons]] in the [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Liverpool]] government from 1812 until his suicide. Early in his career, as [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], he was involved in putting down the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] and was instrumental in securing the passage of the [[Acts of Union 1800|Irish Act of Union of 1800]].\n\nCastlereagh's challenge at the foreign office was to organise and finance an alliance to destroy Napoleon. He successfully brought Napoleon's enemies together at the [[Treaty of Chaumont]] in 1814. Thereafter he worked with Europe's leaders at the Congress of Vienna to provide a peace consistent with the conservative mood of the day. At Vienna he was largely successful in his primary goal of creating a peace settlement that would endure for years. He saw that a harsh treaty based on vengeance and retaliation against France would fail, and anyway the conservative Bourbons were back in power. He employed his diplomatic skills to block harsh terms.  He held the Chaumont allies together, most notably in their determination to finally end Napoleon's 100 Days in 1815. He had a vision of long-term peace in Europe that united efforts of the great powers. At the same time he was watchful of Britain's mercantile and imperial interests. He purchased the Cape Colony and Ceylon from the Netherlands. France's colonies were returned, but France had to give up all its gains in Europe after 1791. In 1820 he enunciated a policy that Britain would not intervene in European affairs \u2013 a policy that was largely adopted down to 1900.\n\nAs the Irish Secretary during the Rebellion of 1798, he took the lead in suppressing the rebellion and restoring order. Castlereagh encouraged lenient treatment of the rebels after they surrendered, but many Irish denounced him as a traitor. Criticism increased when he supported Pitt's Act of Union which abolished the Irish Parliament. Castlereagh was a consistent supporter of Catholic emancipation. In 1805 he became the Secretary of State for war{{sfn|Wills|1817|p=[https://archive.org/details/livesofillustrio06willuoft/page/128/ 128]|ps=: \"In 1806, he was appointed secretary at war and for the colonies.\"}} and proved to be highly effective in reforming recruitment, and securing the appointment of Arthur Wellesley as commander in Spain. He resigned in 1809 after government splits and an unsuccessful war. He then fought a duel with George Canning, a fellow Tory; they both survived. With intense devotion to multiple duties from both the foreign office and as leader of Commons, he was badly overworked. He came under deep psychological distress in 1822, fearing exposure of homosexuality. Castlereagh committed suicide just before he was to represent Britain at an international Congress\n\nAfter 1815 Castlereagh was the leader in imposing repressive measures at home. He was hated for his harsh attacks on liberty and reform.

He was also beginning to disappoint some of his more radical original supporters in his constituency. As the [[French Revolution#National Convention (1792\u20131795)|French Revolution]] grew more bloody and Ireland more rebellious, Stewart increasingly worried about Ireland's future if the threats from France succeeded in breaking Ireland's links to Britain.

Despairing of obtaining timely military support from Britain if Ireland were again threatened with invasion, for the next several years he was increasingly involved in measures against those promoting a Rising, but his initial principles of reform and emancipation continued to hold a place in his political thought.<ref name=\"Leigh\"/>\n\nIn 1797, Castlereagh was at last appointed to office, as Keeper of the King's Signet for Ireland.{{efn|name=Limavedy}}}} As martial law was declared in the face of growing turmoil, he was made both a [[Lord High Treasurer of Ireland#Commissioners of the Treasury for Ireland (1793-1817)|Lord of the Treasury]] and a Member of the [[Privy Council of Ireland]] (1797\u20131800).{{efn|name=Abercromby}} At the urging of Camden, Castlereagh assumed many of the onerous duties of the often-absent [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]] who was responsible for day-to-day administration and asserting the influence of Dublin Castle in the House of Commons.{{efn|name=Ireland}} In this capacity, and after March 1798 as Acting Chief Secretary, Castlereagh played a key role in crushing the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]], offering clemency to commoners who had supported the rebellion, and focusing instead on pursuing rebel leaders.\n\nIn 1799, in furtherance of both his own political vision and Pitt's policies, Castlereagh began lobbying in the Irish and British Parliaments for an official union between the two, convinced that it was the best way to soothe the long-standing divides in Ireland, insulate Ireland from further radical disaffection, and protect Britain from French military threats via Ireland. His first attempt, at the opening of the Irish session of 1799, met with failure during long, heated debates. A year of further intense preparation followed, with an impressive display of Machiavellian tactics that included the common practice of bribery through peerages, honours and money, but bribery on a truly uncommon scale. In the summer of 1800, Castlereagh together with the Lord Lieutenant, [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Marquess Cornwallis]], finally succeeded in steering the [[Act of Union 1800|Irish Act of Union]] through both Parliaments.<ref name=\"Leigh\"/><ref name=\"Multitext\"/>\n\nDuring the campaign for the Act of Union, both Castlereagh and Cornwallis had, in good faith, forwarded informal assurances they had received from Pitt's Cabinet to the [[Irish Catholics]] that they would be allowed to sit in Parliament. Both Castlereagh and Cornwallis knew Catholic emancipation would be critical if their objectives for Union were to be realised. Emancipation was, however, opposed by much of the British establishment, including [[George III]], who was convinced that it would violate his royal oath as protector of the Protestant faith. Pitt tried to follow through on his commitment, but when it came to light that the King had approached [[Henry Addington]], an opponent of Catholic emancipation, about becoming Prime Minister to replace the pro-emancipation Pitt, both Castlereagh and Pitt resigned in protest.

When that Government collapsed, Castlereagh again became Secretary of State for War and the Colonies in 1807, this time in the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland#The Duke of Portland's Second Ministry, March 1807 \u2013 October 1809|ministry]] of the [[William Cavendish-Bentinck, 3rd Duke of Portland|Duke of Portland]].<ref name=\"Spartacus\">{{cite web |url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRcastlereagh.htm |title=Spartacus Educational |publisher=Spartacus Educational |accessdate=29 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024072853/http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/PRcastlereagh.htm |archivedate=24 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Duel with Canning ==\nAs minister for War, Castlereagh became involved in disputes with [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[George Canning]] over the [[Walcheren Expedition]] and its failure. Canning saw it as a diversion of troops from the [[Peninsular War]] based on a hopeless plan. However, Castlereagh had the support of Lord Wellesley's younger brother [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|General Arthur Wellesley]] (future Duke of Wellington), and evidence later surfaced that Canning himself had interfered with the plan, selecting the [[John Pitt, 2nd Earl of Chatham|Earl of Chatham]] to command the expedition.<ref name=\"nndb\"/> The Portland government became increasingly paralysed by disputes between the two men. Portland was in deteriorating health and gave no lead, until Canning threatened resignation unless Castlereagh was removed and replaced by Lord Wellesley. Wellesley himself was neither complicit with nor even aware of the arrangement, but Portland secretly agreed to make this change when it became possible.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nCastlereagh discovered the deal in September 1809 and demanded redress. He challenged Canning to a duel, which Canning accepted. Canning had never before fired a pistol. The duel was fought on 21 September 1809 on [[Putney#Putney Heath|Putney Heath]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pistols at dawn|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/575291/pistols-at-dawn.thtml|author=The Spectator|accessdate=3 April 2010|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205005753/http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/575291/pistols-at-dawn.thtml|archivedate=5 February 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Canning missed but Castlereagh wounded his opponent in the thigh. There was much outrage that two cabinet ministers had resorted to such a method, and they both felt compelled to resign from the government. Six months later, Canning published a full account of his actions in the affair, and many who had initially rallied to him  became convinced Castlereagh had been betrayed by his cabinet colleague.<ref name=\"Hunt\">Hunt, Giles, (2008), ''The Duel: Castlereagh, Canning and Deadly Cabinet Rivalry'', London: B Tauris {{ISBN|978-1-84511-593-7}}</ref>\n\n==Diplomatic career==\n[[File:Viscount Castlereagh by Francis Leggatt Chantrey 1821.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marble]] [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Castlereagh by [[Joseph Nollekens]], 1821. [[Yale Center for British Art]]]]\nThree years later, in 1812, Castlereagh returned to the government, this time as Foreign Secretary, a role in which he served for the next ten years. He also became leader of the House of Commons in the wake of [[Assassination of Spencer Perceval|Spencer Perceval's assassination]] in 1812.\n\n===Treaty of Chaumont===\nIn his role of Foreign Secretary he was instrumental in negotiating what has become known as the [[Quadruple Alliance (1815)|quadruple alliance]] between Britain, Austria, Russia, and [[Prussia]] at [[Treaty of Chaumont|Chaumont]] in March 1814, in the negotiation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Treaty of Paris]]<ref name=\"nndb\"/> that brought peace with France, and at the Congress of Vienna.  The [[Treaty of Chaumont]] was part of the final deal offered to [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]] in 1814. Napoleon rejected it and it never took effect. However, the key terms reaffirmed decisions that had been made already. These decisions were again ratified and put into effect by the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814\u20131815. The terms were largely written by Lord Castlereagh, who offered cash subsidies to keep the other armies in the field against Napoleon.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Gregory Fremont-Barnes|author2=Todd Fisher|title=The Napoleonic Wars: The Rise and Fall of an Empire|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j45Rg2VBbRAC&pg=PA302|year=2004|publisher=Osprey Publishing|pages=302\u20135|isbn=9781841768311}}</ref> Key terms included the establishment of a confederated Germany, the division into independent states, the restoration of the Bourbon kings of Spain, and the enlargement of the Netherlands to include what in 1830 became modern Belgium. The treaty of Chaumont became the cornerstone of the European Alliance which formed the balance of power for decades.<ref>Frederick B. Artz, ''Reaction & Revolution: 1814\u20131832'' (1934), p. 110</ref>\n\nHistorian [[G. M. Trevelyan]] argues:\n:In 1813 and 1814 Castlereagh played the part that William III and Marlborough had played more than a hundred years before, in holding together an alliance of jealous, selfish, weak-kneed states and princes, by a vigour or character and singleness of purpose that held Metternich, the Czar, and the King of Prussia on the common track until the goal was reached. It is quite possible that, but for the lead taken by Castlereagh in the allied counsels, France would never have been reduced to her ancient limits, nor Napoleon dethroned.{{sfn|Trevelyan|1922|p=[https://archive.org/details/britishhistoryin00trevuoft/page/132 133]|ps=:as quoted.}}\n\n===Congress of Vienna===\nAt the [[Congress of Vienna]], Castlereagh designed and proposed a form of collective and collaborative security for Europe, then called a [[Congress system]]. In the Congress system, the main signatory powers met periodically (every two years or so) and collectively managed European affairs. This system was used in an attempt to address the [[Congress of Vienna#Polish-Saxon crisis|Polish-Saxon crisis]] at Vienna and the [[Congress of Laibach#Eastern Question|question of Greek independence]] at Laibach. The following ten years saw five European Congresses where disputes were resolved with a diminishing degree of effectiveness. Finally, by 1822, the whole system had collapsed because of the irreconcilable differences of opinion among Britain, Austria, and Russia, and because of the lack of support for the Congress system in British public opinion.  The [[Holy Alliance]], which Castlereagh opposed, lingered a little longer.  The [[Conservative Order|order]] created by the Congress of Vienna was a mood that lasted much longer and worked to prevent major European wars until the [[First World War]] in 1914. Some scholars and historians have seen the Congress system as a forerunner of the modern [[collective security]], international unity, and cooperative agreements of [[NATO]], the EU, the [[League of Nations]], and the United Nations.<ref name=\"Kissinger\">{{cite book |last=Kissinger  |first=Henry  |authorlink=Henry Kissinger  |title=A World Restored: Metternich, Castlereagh and the Problems of Peace, 1812\u201322 }}</ref>\n\nIn the years 1812 to 1822, Castlereagh continued to manage Britain's foreign policy, generally pursuing a policy of continental engagement uncharacteristic of British foreign policy in the nineteenth century. Castlereagh was not an effective public speaker and his diplomatic presentation style was at times abstruse.<ref name=\"nndb\"/> Henry Kissinger says he developed a reputation for integrity, consistency, and goodwill, which was perhaps unmatched by any diplomat of that era.<ref name=\"Kissinger\"/>\n\n===Abolition of the slave trade===\n{{Further|Atlantic slave trade#End of the Atlantic slave trade}}\nAbolitionist opinion in Britain was strong enough in 1807 to abolish the slave trade in all British possessions\u2014although slavery itself persisted in the colonies until 1833.<ref>Seymour Drescher, \"Whose abolition? Popular pressure and the ending of the British slave trade.\" ''Past & Present'' 143 (1994): 136-166. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/651164 Online]</ref> Abolitionists after 1807 focused on international agreements to abolish the Atlantic slave trade. Castlereagh switched his position and became  a strong supporter of the movement.  Britain arranged treaties with Portugal, Sweden and Denmark, 1810\u20131814, whereby they agreed to restrict their trading. These were preliminary to the Congress of Vienna negotiations that Castlereagh dominated and which resulted in a general declaration condemning the slave trade.<ref>Jerome Reich,  \"The Slave Trade at the Congress of Vienna--A Study in English Public Opinion--.\" ''Journal of Negro History'' 53.2 (1968): 129-143. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2716488 Online]</ref> The problem was that the treaties and declarations were hard to enforce, given the very high profits available to private interests. As Foreign Minister, Castlereagh cooperated with senior officials to use the Royal Navy to detect and capture slave ships; the freed slaves were sent to freedom in a new British colony of [[History of Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone]].  He used diplomacy to make search and seize agreements with all the government whose ships were trading.  There was serious friction with the United States, where the southern slave interest was politically powerful. Washington recoiled at British policing of the high seas.  Spain, France and Portugal also relied on the international slave trade to supply their colonial plantations. As more and more diplomatic arrangements were made by Castlereagh, the owners of slave ships started flying false flags of nations that had not agreed, especially the United States. It was illegal under American law for American ships to engage in the slave trade, but the idea of Britain enforcing American laws was unacceptable to Washington. Lord Palmerston continued the Castlereagh  policies. Eventually, in 1842 in 1845, an arrangement was reached between London and Washington. With the arrival of a staunchly anti-slavery government in Washington in 1861, the Atlantic slave trade was doomed. In the long run, Castlereagh's strategy on how to stifle the trade proved successful.<ref>James C. Duram, \"A Study of Frustration: Britain, the USA, and the African Slave Trade, 1815-1870.\" Social Science (1965): 220-225. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41885111 Online]</ref>\n\n===Nonintervention in European affairs===\nIn May 1820 Castlereagh circulated to high officials a major state paper that set the main British policy for the rest of the century. Temperley and Penson call it, \"the most famous State Paper in British history and the one of the widest ultimate consequences.\" <ref>H.W.V. Temperley, and Lillian M. Penson, eds. ''Foundations of British Foreign Policy: 1792\u20131902'' (1938) Quote page 47, the paper itself pp 48-63.</ref> Castlereagh called for no British intervention in continental affairs.  He argued that the purpose of the Quadruple Alliance was to contain France and put down revolutions. But the Spanish revolt did not threaten European peace nor any of the great powers. Castlereagh said that an actual practice the powers would seldom be able to agree on concerted action, and he pointed out that British public opinion would not support interventions. He admitted that individual states could indeed intervene in affairs in their recognized sphere of interest, such as Austria's intervention in Italy.\n\n==Decline and death==\n[[File:Castlereagh's House.jpg|thumb|right|Castlereagh's house, [[Loring Hall|Woollet Hall]] (now called Loring Hall), in [[North Cray]] in [[Bexley]], south London]]\n[[File:Blue Plaque for the Viscount Castlereagh.jpg|thumb|right|Blue plaque along the North Cray Road]]\n\nDespite his contributions to the defeat of Napoleon and restoration of peace, Castlereagh became extremely unpopular at home. He was attacked for his construction of a peace that gave a free hand to reactionary governments on the Continent to suppress dissent. He was also condemned for his association with repressive measures of the [[Home Secretary]], [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Lord Sidmouth]] (the former Prime Minister Addington).<ref name=\"nndb\"/> As [[Leader of the House of Commons]] for the [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool#Lord Liverpool's Administration (1812\u20131827)|Liverpool Government]], he was often called upon to [[Cabinet collective responsibility|defend government policy]] in the House. He had to support the widely reviled measures taken by Sidmouth and the others, including the infamous [[Six Acts]], to remain in cabinet and continue his diplomatic work. For these reasons, Castlereagh appears with other members of Lord Liverpool's Cabinet in [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]'s poem ''[[The Masque of Anarchy]]'', which was inspired by, and heavily critical of, the [[Peterloo Massacre]]:\n\n: I met Murder on the way \u2013\n: He had a mask like Castlereagh \u2013\n: Very smooth he looked, yet grim;\n: Seven bloodhounds followed him\n\n: All were fat; and well they might\n: Be in admirable plight,\n: For one by one, and two by two,\n: He tossed them human hearts to chew\n: Which from his wide cloak he drew.<ref>{{cite book|author=David C.

Towards the end of his life there are increasing reports, both contemporaneous and in later memoirs, of exceptionally powerful rages and sudden bouts of uncharacteristic forgetfulness.

Much of the Stewart family wealth was based on the estates which came into the family through the Cowan inheritance, which put the family squarely in the [[landed gentry]] class of [[Ulster#History and politics|Ulster Presbyterians]] whose ancestors first arrived in Ireland during the [[Plantation of Ulster]]. (See {{cite web|url=http://www.proni.gov.uk/records/private/lond_eo.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114195351/http://www.proni.gov.uk/records/private/lond_eo.htm |archivedate=14 November 2007 |title=The Cowan Inheritance |publisher=Public Records Office of Northern Ireland |date=7 September 2006 |accessdate=6 July 2009}}).}}\n: {{efn|name=Castlereagh|The name ''Castlereagh'' derives from the barony of [[Castlereagh (County Down barony)|Castlereagh]] in which lie the towns of Newtownards and Comber. The estates included the demesne land of Mount Pleasant, later [[Mount Stewart]], which became the family seat of the Londonderrys (see Leigh, ''Castlereagh'', p. 15).}}\n: {{efn|name=Election|The Down election of 1790 was fought against the elder Stewart's rival for influence in Ulster, [[Wills Hill, 1st Marquess of Downshire]], who controlled both Down seats. The elder Stewart, who had been raised to the Irish peerage the previous year and was thereby ineligible, persuaded his son to stand for the seat. His son was backed, as he had been, by Whigs and [[English Dissenters|Dissenters]]. The election expenses to the Stewarts reached the extraordinary sum of \u00a360,000, financed by a mortgage of Mount Stewart, which Castlereagh's father spent much of the next decades paying off. (See Leigh, ''Castlereagh''.)}}\n: {{efn|name=Child|In a profile of Castlereagh published within months of his death, he was reported to have had, prior to his marriage, a son by a maidservant who lived near the Mount Stewart estate, and whom it was rumored he supported. (Dr. Felton Reede, ''Private Life of the Marquess of Londonderry'', (1822), cited in Leigh, ''Castlereagh'', pp 34 and 144.)}}\n: {{efn|name=Limavedy|Castlereagh had been re-elected without opposition from Down in 1797 and continued to hold this seat while in office in Ireland. He could not continue to hold both Irish office and the seat in Westminster for Orford, which he therefore resigned. (See Leigh, ''Castlereagh'', Ch 4.) In the Irish election of 1798, he stood for [[Newtown Limavady (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Newtown Limavady]] as well as for Down. He was successful for both constituencies and chose to sit for the latter. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}}}\n: {{efn|name=War|The war with France absorbed much of the attention of Government and Parliament, and what attention was paid to an increasingly radicalised Ireland was confused and inconsistent. Pitt's dismissal of the popular [[William Fitzwilliam, 4th Earl Fitzwilliam|Lord Fitzwilliam]] in 1795, over Fitzwilliam's aggressive support of Whig patronage and Catholic emancipation, produced outrage and rioting in Dublin. Castlereagh had watched the unravelling of Irish policy with deep concern and knew what sort of reaction to expect to Fitzwilliam's dismissal. But he was in no position to steer Irish policy nor could he object to the inevitable departure of Fitzwilliam, especially as the person appointed to replace Fitzwilliam was the brother of Stewart's step-mother, [[John Pratt, 1st Marquess Camden|John Jeffreys Pratt]], who had recently succeed as 2nd Earl Camden. (See Leigh, ''Castlereagh'', Ch. 3.)}}\n: {{efn|name=Abercromby|In Council, though he was active in pursuing plots against the Government, he countered the influence of the more extreme members of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] who, against especially the policies of the new Commander-in-Chief for Ireland, [[Ralph Abercromby|Sir Ralph Abercromby]], called for indiscriminate violence to suppress all threat of rebellion. (See Leigh, ''Castlereagh'', Ch 4).}}\n: {{efn|name=Ireland|The Chief Secretary for Ireland from 1795\u201398 was [[Thomas Pelham, 2nd Earl of Chichester|Thomas Pelham]], but he was continually absent from his duties due to illness. Camden pressed London to replace Pelham, recommending in his stead Castlereagh, whose performance in office was admired by those in London concerned with Irish policy. But as an example of the perverse prejudices of the era, Castlereagh, who might have been especially competent in this delicate and demanding office because he was an Irishman, was also ineligible to represent the Crown in Ireland because he was an Irishman, even though this Irishman was grandson of an English Marquess, great-grandson of an English Duke and son-in-law of an English Earl. After pressure by Pitt on [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] who shared the prejudice against appointments of Irish as representatives of the Crown in Ireland, Castlereagh was appointed Acting Chief Secretary in March 1798. But it was only in November 1798, after the Rebellion had been put down that, in response to imperious demands from the next influential Lord Lieutenant, [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Marquess Cornwallis]], Castlereagh was given the permanent office, and for the first time the Chief Secretary for Ireland was an Irishman. The next month, Castlereagh was admitted to the King's Privy Council.

Prior to the Right to Burial Act of 1823, a suicide was denied a Christian burial and, until the Abolition of Forfeiture Act of 1870, his property was forfeited to the Crown. These cruel penalties were less and less frequently applied over the course of the 18th century, especially in the case of wealthier perpetrators. Inquests were likely to view suicide as itself evidence of the disturbed state of the perpetrator's mind. (See e.g., [[Clifton D.
