{"title_page": "Windisch-Graetz", "text_new": "{{Expand German|Windisch-Graetz|date=December 2009}}\n[[File:GER COA Windisch-Graetz.jpg|thumb|Princely arms of Windisch-Graetz]]\nThe House of '''Windisch-Graetz''', also spelled '''Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz''', is an [[Austria]]n aristocratic family, descending from [[Slovenj Gradec|Windischgraz]] in [[Slovene Styria|Lower Styria]] (present-day Slovenj Gradec, [[Slovenia]]). The noble dynasty serving the [[House of Habsburg]] achieved the rank of ''[[Freiherr]]en'' in 1551, of [[Graf|Imperial Counts]] in 1682 and of [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire]] in 1804. The family belongs to [[Uradel|high nobility]].\n\n==History==\nAccording to the [[Almanach de Gotha]], the family was first recorded in 1242. They temporarily served as ''[[Ministerialis|ministeriales]]'' of the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia|Patriarchs of Aquileia]], owners of [[Slovenj Gradec]] until the mid 14th century. One Conrad of Windischgracz (d. 1339) acted as a Habsburg administrator in the Habsburg [[Duchy of Styria]] from 1323 onwards. \n\nIn 1574 the dynasty obtained ''[[Inkolat]]'' in [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]]; later, however, several members converted to [[Lutheranism]] and lost their estates in the course of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The Austrian diplomat Gottlieb of Windisch-Graetz (1630\u20131695) again converted to Roman Catholicism in 1682 and was elevated to the rank of Count of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the same year. In 1693 his son Ernest Frederick (1670\u20131727) acquired [[\u010cerven\u00e1 Lhota Castle]] in Southern Bohemia, which his descendant [[Joseph Nicholas of Windisch-Graetz]] (1744\u20131802) had to sell in 1755.\n\n[[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz|Count Alfred Candidus Ferdinand zu Windisch-Graetz]] (1787\u20131862) was elevated to the rank of ''[[F\u00fcrst]]'' (Prince) in 1804. After the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was abolished two years later, theri territories were mediatized to W\u00fcrttemberg and Austria. Alfred and his brother Weriand were both created Princes of the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1822, with Alfred and his successors being the first line of Princes of Windisch-Graetz, and Weriand and his successors being the second line.<ref name=\"AdG1910\">Almanach de Gotha, 1910 edition, pp 245-248, Justus Perthes</ref>\n\nGreat Britain's [[Princess Michael of Kent]] is descended from this family through her maternal grandmother, while her husband [[Prince Michael of Kent]] is a first cousin once removed of Archduchess [[Sophie Franziska of Austria]], Princess of Windisch-Graetz.\n\n== (Mediatized) Princes of Windisch-Graetz ==\n[[File:Windischgr\u00e4tz, Alfred I.

arms of Windisch-Graetz]]\nThe House of '''Windisch-Graetz''', also spelled '''Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz''', is an [[Austria]]n aristocratic family, descending from [[Slovenj Gradec|Windischgraz]] in [[Slovene Styria|Lower Styria]] (present-day Slovenj Gradec, [[Slovenia]]). The noble dynasty serving the [[House of Habsburg]] achieved the rank of ''[[Freiherr]]en'' in 1551, of [[Graf|Imperial Counts]] in 1682 and of [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire]] in 1804. The family belongs to [[Uradel|high nobility]].\n\n==History==\nAccording to the [[Almanach de Gotha]], the family was first recorded in 1242. They temporarily served as ''[[Ministerialis|ministeriales]]'' of the [[Patriarchate of Aquileia|Patriarchs of Aquileia]], owners of [[Slovenj Gradec]] until the mid 14th century. One Conrad of Windischgracz (d. 1339) acted as a Habsburg administrator in the Habsburg [[Duchy of Styria]] from 1323 onwards. \n\nIn 1574 the dynasty obtained ''[[Inkolat]]'' in [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]]; later, however, several members converted to [[Lutheranism]] and lost their estates in the course of the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The Austrian diplomat Gottlieb of Windisch-Graetz (1630\u20131695) again converted to Roman Catholicism in 1682 and was elevated to the rank of Count of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] by [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor]], in the same year. In 1693 his son Ernest Frederick (1670\u20131727) acquired [[\u010cerven\u00e1 Lhota Castle]] in Southern Bohemia, which his descendant [[Joseph Nicholas of Windisch-Graetz]] (1744\u20131802) had to sell in 1755.\n\n[[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Gr\u00e4tz|Count Alfred Candidus Ferdinand zu Windisch-Graetz]] (1787\u20131862) was elevated to the rank of ''[[F\u00fcrst]]'' (Prince) in 1804. After the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was abolished two years later, theri territories were mediatized to W\u00fcrttemberg and Austria. Alfred and his brother Weriand were both created Princes of the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1822, with Alfred and his successors being the first line of Princes of Windisch-Graetz, and Weriand and his successors being the second line.<ref name=\"AdG1910\">Almanach de Gotha, 1910 edition, pp 245-248, Justus Perthes</ref>\n\nGreat Britain's [[Princess Michael of Kent]] is descended from this family through her maternal grandmother, while her husband [[Prince Michael of Kent]] is a first cousin once removed of Archduchess [[Sophie Franziska of Austria]], Princess of Windisch-Graetz.\n\n== (Mediatized) Princes of Windisch-Graetz ==\n[[File:Windischgr\u00e4tz, Alfred I.

It is the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's own [[WrestleMania]]) and one of the \"Big Four\" events, along with WrestleMania, [[Royal Rumble]], and [[SummerSlam]], as it is one of the original four pay-per-views produced by WWE.\n\n==Origins and changes==\n[[File:Survivor Series 2005 stage.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Survivor Series (2005)|Survivor Series 2005]] stage setup.]]\nThe first Survivor Series, held in 1987, came on the heels of the success of [[WrestleMania III]], as the then-WWF began to see the lucrative potential of the pay-per-view market. The first event capitalized on the big time feud between [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]], who wrestled each other at WrestleMania III. Survivor Series was originally created to be a \"Thanksgiving tradition\" as the first eight Survivor Series events took place on either [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] (1987\u20131990) or Thanksgiving Eve (1991\u20131994). Since 1995, the event has been held the Sunday before Thanksgiving (save for the 2005 and 2006 events, which were held after Thanksgiving). On February 11, 2010, WWE stated that Survivor Series would be rebranded, but in June, the event was added back onto WWE's pay-per-view schedule.<ref name=\"wwe.com show sched\">http://www.wwe.com/schedules/events/rw/country/united%20states</ref>\n\nWith the return of the [[WWE brand extension|brand split]] in 2016, the yearly event has focused on direct competition between the brands. In [[Survivor Series (2016)|2016]], [[Survivor Series (2017)|2017]], and [[Survivor Series (2018)|2018]], the competition was between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brands, similar to the [[WWE Bragging Rights|Bragging Rights]] events that WWE held for two years during the first brand split.<ref name=\"wwe.com 2016\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2016|title=Survivor Series 2016 results: Fantasy warfare just got real|work=WWE|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"wwe.com 2017\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2017|title=Survivor Series 2017 results: Triple H lays waste to Angle and Shane as Raw triumphs over SmackDown|work=WWE|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"SSeries2018\">{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Jason|title=Powell\u2019s WWE Survivor Series live review: WWE Universal Champion Brock Lesnar vs. WWE Champion Daniel Bryan, Raw Women\u2019s Champion Ronda Rousey vs. Charlotte Flair in a non-title match, Intercontinental Champion Seth Rollins vs. U.S. Champion Shinsuke Nakamura|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2018/11/18/powells-wwe-survivor-series-live-review-wwe-universal-champion-brock-lesnar-vs-wwe-champion-daniel-bryan-raw-womens-champion-ronda-rousey-vs-charlotte-flair-in-a-non-title-match/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=November 18, 2018}}</ref> Beginning with the 2017 event, the theme of the present Survivor Series events in particular are brand supremacy; in addition to traditional [[Survivor Series elimination match]]es featuring Raw's men and women against SmackDown's (2016 and 2018 also featured matches with the brands' tag teams going against each other), there have been multiple other interpromotional matches on the card as well involving the brands' champions going against each other in non-title matches to determine the superior champion (e.g., the superior world champion). Raw won the competition in 2016, 2017, and 2018, with a 3\u20132 victory in 2016, a 4\u20133 victory in 2017, and a clean sweep 6\u20130 victory in 2018 (the pre-show match was not counted that year). In 2019, WWE's [[Farm team|developmental territory]] [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] was promoted to being WWE's third major brand and was added to the brand competition for the [[Survivor Series (2019)|2019 event]]. That event in turn featured the first triple threat Survivor Series elimination matches for the men and women. NXT subsequently won that year's competition over SmackDown and Raw with a 4\u20132\u20131 victory.\n\n==Survivor Series matches==\nThe event is traditionally characterized by having tag-team elimination matches, pitting teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. These matches are generally referred to as \"Survivor Series matches.\" The WWF had several elimination tag-team matches earlier in 1987, albeit with three-man teams and the feuds loosely related. In an early break from the norm, the 1992 event had only one tag team elimination match. The 1997 event saw the [[Montreal Screwjob]], while the 1998 event was the first without any elimination tag team matches, instead focusing on an elimination tournament for the [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]]. The 2002 Survivor Series (which also did not feature any elimination tag team matches) is notable for the debut of the [[Elimination Chamber]] match.\n\n==Survivor Series dates and venues==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!scope=col|No\n!scope=col|Event\n!scope=col|Date\n!scope=col|City\n!scope=col|Venue\n!scope=col|Main Event\n|-\n|1\n|style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"|[[Survivor Series (1987)]]\n|style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"|November 26, 1987\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Richfield, Ohio]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Richfield Coliseum]]\n|{{small|[[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]], [[One Man Gang]], [[King Kong Bundy]], [[Butch Reed]], and [[Rick Rude]] vs. [[Hulk Hogan]], [[Paul Orndorff]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Ken Patera]], and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] in a 5-on-5 [[Survivor Series elimination match]]}}\n|-\n|2\n|[[Survivor Series (1988)]]\n|November 24, 1988\n|{{small|[[Hulk Hogan]], [[Randy Savage]], [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]], [[Koko B.

events|event]] held in November by [[WWE]]. It is the second longest running pay-per-view event in history (behind WWE's own [[WrestleMania]]) and one of the \"Big Four\" events, along with WrestleMania, [[Royal Rumble]], and [[SummerSlam]], as it is one of the original four pay-per-views produced by WWE.\n\n==Origins and changes==\n[[File:Survivor Series 2005 stage.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The [[Survivor Series (2005)|Survivor Series 2005]] stage setup.]]\nThe first Survivor Series, held in 1987, came on the heels of the success of [[WrestleMania III]], as the then-WWF began to see the lucrative potential of the pay-per-view market. The first event capitalized on the big time feud between [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]], who wrestled each other at WrestleMania III. Survivor Series was originally created to be a \"Thanksgiving tradition\" as the first eight Survivor Series events took place on either [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving Day]] (1987\u20131990) or Thanksgiving Eve (1991\u20131994). Since 1995, the event has been held the Sunday before Thanksgiving (save for the 2005 and 2006 events, which were held after Thanksgiving). On February 11, 2010, WWE stated that Survivor Series would be rebranded, but in June, the event was added back onto WWE's pay-per-view schedule.<ref name=\"wwe.com show sched\">http://www.wwe.com/schedules/events/rw/country/united%20states</ref>\n\nWith the return of the [[WWE brand extension|brand split]] in 2016, the yearly event has focused on direct competition between the brands. In [[Survivor Series (2016)|2016]], [[Survivor Series (2017)|2017]], and [[Survivor Series (2018)|2018]], the competition was between the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brands, similar to the [[WWE Bragging Rights|Bragging Rights]] events that WWE held for two years during the first brand split.<ref name=\"wwe.com 2016\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2016|title=Survivor Series 2016 results: Fantasy warfare just got real|work=WWE|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"wwe.com 2017\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/2017|title=Survivor Series 2017 results: Triple H lays waste to Angle and Shane as Raw triumphs over SmackDown|work=WWE|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en}}</ref><ref name=\"SSeries2018\">{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Jason|title=Powell\u2019s WWE Survivor Series live review: WWE Universal Champion Brock Lesnar vs. WWE Champion Daniel Bryan, Raw Women\u2019s Champion Ronda Rousey vs. Charlotte Flair in a non-title match, Intercontinental Champion Seth Rollins vs. U.S. Champion Shinsuke Nakamura|url=https://prowrestling.net/site/2018/11/18/powells-wwe-survivor-series-live-review-wwe-universal-champion-brock-lesnar-vs-wwe-champion-daniel-bryan-raw-womens-champion-ronda-rousey-vs-charlotte-flair-in-a-non-title-match/|work=Pro Wrestling Dot Net|accessdate=November 18, 2018}}</ref> Beginning with the 2017 event, the theme of the present Survivor Series events in particular are brand supremacy; in addition to traditional [[Survivor Series elimination match]]es featuring Raw's men and women against SmackDown's (2016 and 2018 also featured matches with the brands' tag teams going against each other), there have been multiple other interpromotional matches on the card as well involving the brands' champions going against each other in non-title matches to determine the superior champion (e.g., the superior world champion). Raw won the competition in 2016, 2017, and 2018, with a 3\u20132 victory in 2016, a 4\u20133 victory in 2017, and a clean sweep 6\u20130 victory in 2018 (the pre-show match was not counted that year). In 2019, WWE's [[Farm team|developmental territory]] [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]] was promoted to being WWE's third major brand and was added to the brand competition for the [[Survivor Series (2019)|2019 event]]. That event in turn featured the first triple threat Survivor Series elimination matches for the men and women. NXT subsequently won that year's competition over SmackDown and Raw with a 4\u20132\u20131 victory.\n\n==Survivor Series matches==\nThe event is traditionally characterized by having tag-team elimination matches, pitting teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. These matches are generally referred to as \"Survivor Series matches.\" The WWF had several elimination tag-team matches earlier in 1987, albeit with three-man teams and the feuds loosely related. In an early break from the norm, the 1992 event had only one tag team elimination match. The 1997 event saw the [[Montreal Screwjob]], while the 1998 event was the first without any elimination tag team matches, instead focusing on an elimination tournament for the [[WWE Championship|WWF World Heavyweight Championship]]. The 2002 Survivor Series (which also did not feature any elimination tag team matches) is notable for the debut of the [[Elimination Chamber]] match.\n\n==Survivor Series dates and venues==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!scope=col|No\n!scope=col|Event\n!scope=col|Date\n!scope=col|City\n!scope=col|Venue\n!scope=col|Main Event\n|-\n|1\n|style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"|[[Survivor Series (1987)]]\n|style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"|November 26, 1987\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Richfield, Ohio]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"|[[Richfield Coliseum]]\n|{{small|[[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]], [[One Man Gang]], [[King Kong Bundy]], [[Butch Reed]], and [[Rick Rude]] vs. [[Hulk Hogan]], [[Paul Orndorff]], [[Don Muraco]], [[Ken Patera]], and [[Bam Bam Bigelow]] in a 5-on-5 [[Survivor Series elimination match]]}}\n|-\n|2\n|[[Survivor Series (1988)]]\n|November 24, 1988\n|{{small|[[Hulk Hogan]], [[Randy Savage]], [[Hercules (wrestler)|Hercules]], [[Koko B.

It was not only the band's longest tour, but one of the longest concert tours in rock history, consisting of 194 shows in 27 countries.<ref name=\"Bozza, Anthony 2007 p. 372\">Bozza, Anthony, & Slash (2007). Slash. Harper Entertainment: New York. p. 372</ref> It was also a source of much infamy for the band, due to [[riot]]s, late starts, cancellations and outspoken rantings by [[Axl Rose]].\n\n==History==\nThe Use Your Illusion Tour was a promotional tour for the albums ''[[Use Your Illusion I]]'' and ''[[Use Your Illusion II]]''. The tour started on May 24, 1991, approximately when the long-awaited follow-up to ''[[G N' R Lies]]'' was to be released, and ended over two years later. The release date of the album, or albums, since there were now two of them, was pushed back to September but the tour began as originally scheduled.  The tour marked a high point in the popularity of Guns N' Roses, with a total of over 7 million<ref name=\"Bozza, Anthony 2007 p. 372\"/> fans attending, and accompanied by high worldwide [[album]] sales.\n\nLive recordings from the tour would later be issued as a two [[video]]/[[DVD]] set, ''[[Use Your Illusion I (video)|Use Your Illusion I]]'' and ''[[Use Your Illusion II (video)|II]]'', featuring footage from a 1992 concert in Tokyo, Japan and would also provide content for the 2-disc set ''[[Live Era: '87-'93]]''. The tour also provided a large volume of footage for [[music video]]s, including \"[[Dead Horse (song)|Dead Horse]]\" and their popular cover of Paul McCartney's \"[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]\". Also, at one time, footage of much of the tour was to be released as a documentary, titled ''The Perfect Crime''. The footage consisted of Guns N' Roses' time on the road, concert footage, and information about the riots and other major events of the tour. It was never released and never spoken about after the tour. Slash mentioned in his biography that Axl is in control of the footage and that Slash would be interested in viewing it, as he thought it captured some \"killer moments\" from the tour.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nThe conduct of the band, and particularly Axl Rose, during the Use Your Illusion Tour generated negative press, notably from the magazines ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', ''[[Kerrang!]]'', ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'', and ''[[Hit Parader]]''. These magazines were mentioned in the song \"Get in the Ring\" where Axl Rose attacked writers who had written negative articles dealing with Rose's attitude.\n\nThe shows were all varied, as a setlist was never chosen by the band. They did, however, usually open with \"[[Welcome to the Jungle]]\", \"[[It's So Easy (Guns N' Roses song)|It's So Easy]]\", \"[[Nightrain]]\" or \"Perfect Crime\" and would shortly after one another play \"[[Mr. Brownstone]]\" or \"Live and Let Die\", and closed with \"[[Paradise City]]\". Each show featured many guitar solos from [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] (including the [[Speak Softly Love (Love Theme from The Godfather)|Theme From the Godfather]]) and a drum solo from drummer [[Matt Sorum]], usually 6 minutes in length.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nThe Use Your Illusion Tour was massive not just in the number and size of performances, but also in its technical aspects and the size of the [[road crew|crew]]. A total of 130 working personnel traveled with the band during the tour, with the band using two different stages to enable faster setup.<ref name=\"mckag\"/> The trade magazine ''Performance'' named the tour crew \"Crew of the Year\" for 1991.\n\n[[Duff McKagan]] revealed in a 2015 interview that the band didn't make profit on the tour until 1993 due to the extravagant costs.<ref name=\"mckag\">{{Cite web |url=https://ontheaside.com/uncategorized/guns-n-roses-toured-use-your-illusion-for-two-years-to-break-even/ |title=Guns N\u2019 Roses toured \u2018Use Your Illusion\u2019 for two years to break even  |last=Teo |first=Mark |date=January 5, 2015 |website=On The A Side}}</ref>\n\n==Notable events==\nAt the June 10, 1991 show, at Saratoga Performing Arts Center, Axl Rose requested that the crowd chant \"Get in the ring!\" This was recorded for the song of that name on ''Use Your Illusion II''.\n\nOn June 13, 1991, during the show in Philadelphia, Rose erupted after a fan fought with GNR photographer [[Robert John (photographer)|Robert John]]. When the fan kicked the camera out of his hands, Rose cursed him out and challenged him to a fight. After the fan was ejected from the concert, the show continued.\n\nOn Tuesday, July 2, 1991, at a show at the [[Riverport Amphitheatre]] in [[Maryland Heights, Missouri]] near [[St. Louis]], Rose spotted a spectator [[bootleg recording|recording]] the concert with a video camera and jumped into the audience after him when concert security failed to respond to his request to apprehend the man. Returning to the stage, Axl declared: \"Well, thanks to the lame-ass security, I'm going home!\" then slammed the mic on the stage, sparking the infamous [[Riverport Riot|Riverport riot]]. Axl then stormed off the stage; some people thought when he slammed the mic, because of the noise, that he shot someone. Slash told them, \"He just slammed his mic on the floor. We're outta here.\" He proceeded to throw his guitar pick into the crowd and follow Axl. The band followed. The band was looking to come back out and finish the show, but as police and security tried to calm down the audience, a riot broke out. The footage was captured by Robert John who was documenting the entire tour. Sixty fans were injured. The band lost most of their equipment and Axl was charged with inciting a riot. He was acquitted due to lack of evidence.\n\nOn August 3, 1991, the day mixing of the ''Illusion'' albums was finished, the band played the longest show of the tour at the [[L.A. Forum]]. It lasted three and a half hours.<ref>Bozza, Anthony, & Slash (2007). Slash. Harper Entertainment: New York. p. 342</ref>\n\nOn November 7, 1991, [[Izzy Stradlin]] quit the band after the release of ''Use Your Illusion I'' and ''Use Your Illusion II''; his last show was on August 31, 1991, at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. On December 5, replacement rhythm guitarist [[Gilby Clarke]] made his debut in Worcester, at the first show after the release of ''Use Your Illusion I'' and ''Use Your Illusion II''.\n\nOn April 13 and 14, 1992, two concerts had to be canceled when a warrant was issued for Rose's arrest due to his behavior at the St. Louis show.\n\nOn April 20, 1992, the band performed at the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]], an effort for [[AIDS]] Awareness in London. The band was a controversial addition to the lineup, as many in the gay community were still angry over Rose using a gay slur in \"[[One in a Million (Guns N' Roses song)|One in a Million]].\" The band opened with \"Paradise City\" and closed with \"[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]].\" During the famous \"Paradise City\" opening, Axl pointed at protesters in the audience and yelled, \"SHOVE IT!\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} He had planned to address the controversy between songs, but was asked not to by the band as it would pull the spotlight from [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Freddie Mercury]]. As Slash concluded a short cover of [[Alice Cooper]]'s \"[[Only Women Bleed]]\", Duff McKagan kept an eye on Axl, who approached the front of the stage. When Slash finished the song, then strummed the beginning of \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\", McKagan walked over to Rose and shook his hand in appreciation. Later in the show, Slash joined [[Joe Elliott]] of [[Def Leppard]] and the surviving members of Queen for \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]].\" Rose sang \"[[We Will Rock You]]\" and finished \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" with [[Elton John]] and Queen. The show was broadcast live around the world via [[satellite]], gathering the largest audience for a music concert in history.\n\nOn August 8, 1992, in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] during the famously troubled [[Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour|GNR-Metallica Stadium Tour]] portion, Metallica frontman/guitarist [[James Hetfield]]'s left arm was badly burned due to misunderstanding about [[pyrotechnics]] added to Metallica's stage setup. Metallica was forced to end their set early. However, Guns were not present at the arena to begin before the scheduled time, leaving fans to wait several hours before they took the stage. A few songs into the very late set, audio problems resulted in the band not being able to hear themselves play. Axl stormed off stage due to vocal issues, sparking a riot that spilled into the streets.\n\nOn November 25, 1992, the band performed in [[Caracas]], Venezuela, in front of a crowd of 45,000. Just two days later, the [[Venezuela Air Force]] [[History of Venezuela#Second P\u00e9rez and second Caldera administrations|launched a failed military coup]], making it impossible for half of the band's crew and all of their equipment to leave the country. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nOn November 30, 1992, the band performed for the first time in [[Bogot\u00e1]], Colombia. When they started to play \"[[November Rain]]\", a soft rain fell over the city and stopped right after they finished the song. Rose later stated this was a special moment for him because \"November Rain\" was #1 in Colombia for 60 weeks. Rose stated that the band were at risk of electrocution and must stop to dry the stage. The band moved backstage and returned to finish with \"[[Don't Cry]]\" and \"Paradise City.\"\n\nOn December 2, 1992, the band performed in [[Santiago]], Chile, at [[Estadio Nacional de Chile|Estadio Nacional]] in front of 85,535 people, breaking an attendance record in the stadium. At their arriving at Chile, Rose attacked some graphic reporters and a cameraman was injured. Before the concert, Rose got drunk and arrived at the stadium two hours late. While the band performed \"[[Civil War (song)|Civil War]]\" some people threw bottles to the stage, and Rose stopped four minutes into the show. The concert ended with 50 people arrested outside the stadium, and a teenage fan with several injuries, dying two days later.\n\nIn February 1993, Gilby Clarke told [[BBC Radio 1]]'s ''[[Friday Rock Show]]'': \"For the last year and a half, we had a film crew with us. They do film every show and things backstage: hotel rooms, everything. And what we're gonna do at the end of the whole tour \u2013 which is actually after we're done in Europe \u2013 is put it all together, and we are gonna make a movie. It's pretty candid right now, so it's gonna be really great. The difference between ours and [[Madonna: Truth or Dare|Madonna's]] is that ours isn't scripted. This movie is actually things that are happening around us.\" He also said GN'R would record an ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' during their stay in Russia. Neither of these plans came to fruition.<ref>Interview after 23 Feb 1993 show in Austin, broadcast 27 Feb 1993, as transcribed in GN'R [[fanzine]] ''Controversy'', issue 6</ref>\n\nStradlin returned for several shows in 1993, deputizing for an injured Clarke. \"It was weird,\" he recalled. \"We toured Greece, Istanbul, London ''[sic]''. I liked that side of it \u2013 seeing some places I'd never seen\u2026 [But] money was a big sore point. I did the dates just for salary\u2026 [At the end] I didn't actually say 'See you', cos they were all fucked up\u2026 It was like playing with zombies.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Mick|last=[[Mick Wall|Wall]]|title=In too deep|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #28|date=June 2001|p=41}}</ref>\n\nOn July 17, 1993, the band performed in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina at [[River Plate Stadium]] in front of 80,000 people. It was their last show with most of the ''Use Your Illusion''-era lineup (Rose, Slash, McKagan, Sorum, Reed, and Clarke). The tour was renamed the \"Skin N' Bones Tour\" for the last couple of legs and included an unplugged performance in a living room set. A highlight of the night was [[Cozy Powell]] dressed as a [[Domino's Pizza]] delivery boy playing drums with Sorum.\n\n==First typical setlist==\n(Taken from the Inglewood, California Great Western

It was not only the band's longest tour, but one of the longest concert tours in rock history, consisting of 194 shows in 27 countries.<ref name=\"Bozza, Anthony 2007 p. 372\">Bozza, Anthony, & Slash (2007). Slash. Harper Entertainment: New York. p. 372</ref> It was also a source of much infamy for the band, due to [[riot]]s, late starts, cancellations and outspoken rantings by [[Axl Rose]].\n\n==History==\nThe Use Your Illusion Tour was a promotional tour for the albums ''[[Use Your Illusion I]]'' and ''[[Use Your Illusion II]]''. The tour started on May 24, 1991, approximately when the long-awaited follow-up to ''[[G N' R Lies]]'' was to be released, and ended over two years later. The release date of the album, or albums, since there were now two of them, was pushed back to September but the tour began as originally scheduled.  The tour marked a high point in the popularity of Guns N' Roses, with a total of over 7 million<ref name=\"Bozza, Anthony 2007 p. 372\"/> fans attending, and accompanied by high worldwide [[album]] sales.\n\nLive recordings from the tour would later be issued as a two [[video]]/[[DVD]] set, ''[[Use Your Illusion I (video)|Use Your Illusion I]]'' and ''[[Use Your Illusion II (video)|II]]'', featuring footage from a 1992 concert in Tokyo, Japan and would also provide content for the 2-disc set ''[[Live Era: '87-'93]]''. The tour also provided a large volume of footage for [[music video]]s, including \"[[Dead Horse (song)|Dead Horse]]\" and their popular cover of Paul McCartney's \"[[Live and Let Die (song)|Live and Let Die]]\". Also, at one time, footage of much of the tour was to be released as a documentary, titled ''The Perfect Crime''. The footage consisted of Guns N' Roses' time on the road, concert footage, and information about the riots and other major events of the tour. It was never released and never spoken about after the tour. Slash mentioned in his biography that Axl is in control of the footage and that Slash would be interested in viewing it, as he thought it captured some \"killer moments\" from the tour.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nThe conduct of the band, and particularly Axl Rose, during the Use Your Illusion Tour generated negative press, notably from the magazines ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', ''[[Kerrang!]]'', ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'', and ''[[Hit Parader]]''. These magazines were mentioned in the song \"Get in the Ring\" where Axl Rose attacked writers who had written negative articles dealing with Rose's attitude.\n\nThe shows were all varied, as a setlist was never chosen by the band. They did, however, usually open with \"[[Welcome to the Jungle]]\", \"[[It's So Easy (Guns N' Roses song)|It's So Easy]]\", \"[[Nightrain]]\" or \"Perfect Crime\" and would shortly after one another play \"[[Mr. Brownstone]]\" or \"Live and Let Die\", and closed with \"[[Paradise City]]\". Each show featured many guitar solos from [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] (including the [[Speak Softly Love (Love Theme from The Godfather)|Theme From the Godfather]]) and a drum solo from drummer [[Matt Sorum]], usually 6 minutes in length.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\nThe Use Your Illusion Tour was massive not just in the number and size of performances, but also in its technical aspects and the size of the [[road crew|crew]]. A total of 130 working personnel traveled with the band during the tour, with the band using two different stages to enable faster setup.<ref name=\"mckag\"/> The trade magazine ''Performance'' named the tour crew \"Crew of the Year\" for 1991.\n\n[[Duff McKagan]] revealed in a 2015 interview that the band didn't make profit on the tour until 1993 due to the extravagant costs.<ref name=\"mckag\">{{Cite web |url=https://ontheaside.com/uncategorized/guns-n-roses-toured-use-your-illusion-for-two-years-to-break-even/ |title=Guns N\u2019 Roses toured \u2018Use Your Illusion\u2019 for two years to break even  |last=Teo |first=Mark |date=January 5, 2015 |website=On The A Side}}</ref>\n\n==Notable events==\nAt the June 10, 1991 show, at Saratoga Performing Arts Center, Axl Rose requested that the crowd chant \"Get in the ring!\" This was recorded for the song of that name on ''Use Your Illusion II''.\n\nOn June 13, 1991, during the show in Philadelphia, Rose erupted after a fan fought with GNR photographer [[Robert John (photographer)|Robert John]]. When the fan kicked the camera out of his hands, Rose cursed him out and challenged him to a fight. After the fan was ejected from the concert, the show continued.\n\nOn Tuesday, July 2, 1991, at a show at the [[Riverport Amphitheatre]] in [[Maryland Heights, Missouri]] near [[St. Louis]], Rose spotted a spectator [[bootleg recording|recording]] the concert with a video camera and jumped into the audience after him when concert security failed to respond to his request to apprehend the man. Returning to the stage, Axl declared: \"Well, thanks to the lame-ass security, I'm going home!\" then slammed the mic on the stage, sparking the infamous [[Riverport Riot|Riverport riot]]. Axl then stormed off the stage; some people thought when he slammed the mic, because of the noise, that he shot someone. Slash told them, \"He just slammed his mic on the floor. We're outta here.\" He proceeded to throw his guitar pick into the crowd and follow Axl. The band followed. The band was looking to come back out and finish the show, but as police and security tried to calm down the audience, a riot broke out. The footage was captured by Robert John who was documenting the entire tour. Sixty fans were injured. The band lost most of their equipment and Axl was charged with inciting a riot. He was acquitted due to lack of evidence.\n\nOn August 3, 1991, the day mixing of the ''Illusion'' albums was finished, the band played the longest show of the tour at the [[L.A. Forum]]. It lasted three and a half hours.<ref>Bozza, Anthony, & Slash (2007). Slash. Harper Entertainment: New York. p. 342</ref>\n\nOn November 7, 1991, [[Izzy Stradlin]] quit the band after the release of ''Use Your Illusion I'' and ''Use Your Illusion II''; his last show was on August 31, 1991, at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. On December 5, replacement rhythm guitarist [[Gilby Clarke]] made his debut in Worcester, at the first show after the release of ''Use Your Illusion I'' and ''Use Your Illusion II''.\n\nOn April 13 and 14, 1992, two concerts had to be canceled when a warrant was issued for Rose's arrest due to his behavior at the St. Louis show.\n\nOn April 20, 1992, the band performed at the [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]], an effort for [[AIDS]] Awareness in London. The band was a controversial addition to the lineup, as many in the gay community were still angry over Rose using a gay slur in \"[[One in a Million (Guns N' Roses song)|One in a Million]].\" The band opened with \"Paradise City\" and closed with \"[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]].\" During the famous \"Paradise City\" opening, Axl pointed at protesters in the audience and yelled, \"SHOVE IT!\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}{{Clarify|date=June 2011}} He had planned to address the controversy between songs, but was asked not to by the band as it would pull the spotlight from [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Freddie Mercury]]. As Slash concluded a short cover of [[Alice Cooper]]'s \"[[Only Women Bleed]]\", Duff McKagan kept an eye on Axl, who approached the front of the stage. When Slash finished the song, then strummed the beginning of \"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\", McKagan walked over to Rose and shook his hand in appreciation. Later in the show, Slash joined [[Joe Elliott]] of [[Def Leppard]] and the surviving members of Queen for \"[[Tie Your Mother Down]].\" Rose sang \"[[We Will Rock You]]\" and finished \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\" with [[Elton John]] and Queen. The show was broadcast live around the world via [[satellite]], gathering the largest audience for a music concert in history.\n\nOn August 8, 1992, in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]] during the famously troubled [[Guns N' Roses/Metallica Stadium Tour|GNR-Metallica Stadium Tour]] portion, Metallica frontman/guitarist [[James Hetfield]]'s left arm was badly burned due to misunderstanding about [[pyrotechnics]] added to Metallica's stage setup. Metallica was forced to end their set early. However, Guns were not present at the arena to begin before the scheduled time, leaving fans to wait several hours before they took the stage. A few songs into the very late set, audio problems resulted in the band not being able to hear themselves play. Axl stormed off stage due to vocal issues, sparking a riot that spilled into the streets.\n\nOn November 25, 1992, the band performed in [[Caracas]], Venezuela, in front of a crowd of 45,000. Just two days later, the [[Venezuela Air Force]] [[History of Venezuela#Second P\u00e9rez and second Caldera administrations|launched a failed military coup]], making it impossible for half of the band's crew and all of their equipment to leave the country. {{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nOn November 30, 1992, the band performed for the first time in [[Bogot\u00e1]], Colombia. When they started to play \"[[November Rain]]\", a soft rain fell over the city and stopped right after they finished the song. Rose later stated this was a special moment for him because \"November Rain\" was #1 in Colombia for 60 weeks. Rose stated that the band were at risk of electrocution and must stop to dry the stage. The band moved backstage and returned to finish with \"[[Don't Cry]]\" and \"Paradise City.\"\n\nOn December 2, 1992, the band performed in [[Santiago]], Chile, at [[Estadio Nacional de Chile|Estadio Nacional]] in front of 85,535 people, breaking an attendance record in the stadium. At their arriving at Chile, Rose attacked some graphic reporters and a cameraman was injured. Before the concert, Rose got drunk and arrived at the stadium two hours late. While the band performed \"[[Civil War (song)|Civil War]]\" some people threw bottles to the stage, and Rose stopped four minutes into the show. The concert ended with 50 people arrested outside the stadium, and a teenage fan with several injuries, dying two days later.\n\nIn February 1993, Gilby Clarke told [[BBC Radio 1]]'s ''[[Friday Rock Show]]'': \"For the last year and a half, we had a film crew with us. They do film every show and things backstage: hotel rooms, everything. And what we're gonna do at the end of the whole tour \u2013 which is actually after we're done in Europe \u2013 is put it all together, and we are gonna make a movie. It's pretty candid right now, so it's gonna be really great. The difference between ours and [[Madonna: Truth or Dare|Madonna's]] is that ours isn't scripted. This movie is actually things that are happening around us.\" He also said GN'R would record an ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' during their stay in Russia. Neither of these plans came to fruition.<ref>Interview after 23 Feb 1993 show in Austin, broadcast 27 Feb 1993, as transcribed in GN'R [[fanzine]] ''Controversy'', issue 6</ref>\n\nStradlin returned for several shows in 1993, deputizing for an injured Clarke. \"It was weird,\" he recalled. \"We toured Greece, Istanbul, London ''[sic]''. I liked that side of it \u2013 seeing some places I'd never seen\u2026 [But] money was a big sore point. I did the dates just for salary\u2026 [At the end] I didn't actually say 'See you', cos they were all fucked up\u2026 It was like playing with zombies.\"<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Mick|last=[[Mick Wall|Wall]]|title=In too deep|magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #28|date=June 2001|p=41}}</ref>\n\nOn July 17, 1993, the band performed in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina at [[River Plate Stadium]] in front of 80,000 people. It was their last show with most of the ''Use Your Illusion''-era lineup (Rose, Slash, McKagan, Sorum, Reed, and Clarke). The tour was renamed the \"Skin N' Bones Tour\" for the last couple of legs and included an unplugged performance in a living room set. A highlight of the night was [[Cozy Powell]] dressed as a [[Domino's Pizza]] delivery boy playing drums with Sorum.\n\n==First typical setlist==\n(Taken from the Inglewood, California Great Western
