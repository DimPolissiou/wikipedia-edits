The right to conscientiously object to military service for philosophical or religious reasons was recognised in conscription legislation, as it had been in the First World War.

The right to conscientiously object to military service for philosophical or religious reasons was recognised in conscription legislation, as it had been in the First World War. However, old attitudes still prevailed amongst some members of the general public, with resentment by association towards Bevin Boys. In 1943 Ernest Bevin said in Parliament:\n: ''There are thousands of cases in which conscientious objectors, although they have refused to take up arms, have shown as much courage as anyone else in Civil Defence and in other walks of life.''\n:<small>Ernest Bevin, 9 December 1943</small><ref>{{ukhansard | house=HC | date=9 December 1943 | vol=395 | c=1108}}</ref>\n\n==End of programme==\nThe final conscription ballot took place in May 1945 (shortly before [[Victory in Europe Day|VE Day]]), however the final conscripts were not released from service until March 1948.\n\n==Recognition of contribution to the war effort==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Bevin Boy Veteran badge.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Bevin Boy Veteran badge, awarded to former Bevin Boys by the British Government since 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.historyextra.com/period/second-world-war/5-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-the-bevin-boys/|title=5 things you (probably) didn\u2019t know about the Bevin Boys |accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref>{{ffdc|Bevin Boy Veteran badge.jpg|log=2020 April 5}}]] -->\n\nWithin a few months of the first Bevin Boys starting work, there were calls for a badge to be awarded in recognition of the importance of their national service,<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Young mine workers |date= 31 May 1944 |page_number= 8 |issue= 49870}}</ref>. \n\nAfter the war, Bevin Boys received neither [[medal]]s nor the right to return to the jobs they had previously held.<ref name=Museum_Wales/> (Like Forces veterans, they were entitled to participate in the Government's Further Education and Training Scheme, which paid university fees and an annual means-tested grant of up to \u00a3426 to cover living expenses whilst studying.<ref>{{cite book |last= Dent |first= Harold Collett |year= 2007 |title=  Growth in English education, 1946-1952  |location= London |publisher= Routledge |chapter= 1 |isbn= 9780415432160}}</ref>)\n\nThe role played by Bevin Boys in Britain's war effort was not fully recognised until 1995, 50 years after [[VE Day]], when [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] mentioned them in a speech.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.warhistoryonline.com/war-articles/bevins-boys-kept-in-the-dark-for-60-years.html | title=Bevin\u2019s Boys \u2013 British Conscripts Forced To Mine Coal \u2013 Kept in the Dark for Over 70 Years | accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 June 2007, [[Tony Blair]] informed the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that thousands of conscripts who worked in mines during the Second World War would be awarded a veterans badge similar to the HM armed forces badge awarded by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1555056/Bevin-Boys-war-effort-honoured-with-badge.html|title=Bevin Boys' war effort honoured with badge|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=31 August 2019}}</ref> The first badges were awarded on 25 March 2008 by the then Prime Minister, [[Gordon Brown]], at a reception in 10 Downing Street, marking the 60th anniversary of discharge of the last Bevin Boys.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Bevin Boys honoured |date= 26 March 2008 |page_number= 4 |issue= 69281}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bevin Boys Memorial 2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|One of the memorial stones at the [[National Memorial Arboretum]].]] \nOn Tuesday 7 May 2013, a memorial to the Bevin Boys, based on the Bevin Boys Badge, was unveiled by the [[Sophie, Countess of Wessex|Countess of Wessex]] at the [[National Memorial Arboretum]] at [[Alrewas]], Staffordshire.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename= Court Circular |date= 8 May 2013 |page_number= 51 |issue= 70879}}</ref><ref name=memorial>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newsvideo/royalfamilyvideo/10041949/Bevin-Boys-memorial-unveiled-by-Countess-of-Wessex.html|title=Bevin Boys memorial unveiled by Countess of Wessex|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref> The memorial was designed by former Bevin Boy Harry Parkes; it is made of four stone plinths carved from grey [[Kilkenny Marble|Kilkenny stone]] from the Republic of Ireland.

DVB standards are maintained by the '''DVB Project''', an international industry consortium,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvb.org/|title=DVB - Digital Video Broadcasting|author=|date=|website=www.dvb.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> and are published by a Joint Technical Committee (JTC) of the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI), [[European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization]] (CENELEC) and [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU). \n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Transmission==\nDVB systems distribute data using a variety of approaches, including:\n* [[Satellite television|Satellite]]: [[DVB-S]], [[DVB-S2]]  and [[DVB-SH]]\n** [[DVB-SMATV]] for distribution via [[SMATV]]\n* [[Cable television|Cable]]: [[DVB-C]], [[DVB-C2]]\n* [[Digital terrestrial television|Terrestrial television]]: [[DVB-T]], [[DVB-T2]]\n** Digital terrestrial television for [[handheld]]s: [[DVB-H]], [[DVB-SH]]\n* [[Microwave]]: using [[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]] ([[DVB-MT]]), the [[MMDS]] ([[DVB-MC]]), and/or [[MVDS]] standards ([[DVB-MS]])\n\nThese standards define the [[physical layer]] and [[data link layer]] of the distribution system. Devices interact with the physical layer via a synchronous parallel interface (SPI), synchronous serial interface (SSI) or [[asynchronous serial interface]] (ASI). All data is transmitted in [[MPEG transport stream]]s with some additional constraints (DVB-MPEG). A standard for temporally-compressed distribution to mobile devices (DVB-H) was published in November 2004.\n\nThese distribution systems differ mainly in the [[modulation]] schemes used and error correcting codes used, due to the different technical constraints. DVB-S ([[Super high frequency|SHF]]) uses [[QPSK]], 8-PSK or 16-[[Quadrature amplitude modulation|QAM]]. DVB-S2 uses QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-APSK or 32-APSK, at the broadcasters decision. QPSK and 8-PSK are the only versions regularly used. DVB-C ([[Very high frequency|VHF]]/[[Ultra high frequency|UHF]]) uses [[Quadrature amplitude modulation|QAM]]: 16-QAM, 32-QAM, 64-QAM, 128-QAM or 256-QAM. Lastly, DVB-T (VHF/UHF) uses 16-QAM or 64-QAM (or QPSK) in combination with [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|(C)OFDM]] and can support [[hierarchical modulation]].\n\nThe DVB-T2 specification was approved by the DVB Steering Board in June 2008 and sent to ETSI for adoption as a formal standard. ETSI adopted the standard on 9 September 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://webapp.etsi.org/workProgram/Report_Schedule.asp?WKI_ID=28396 |title=Work Programme: Details of 'DEN/JTC-DVB-228' Work Item Schedule |publisher=ETSI |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> The DVB-T2 standard gives more robust TV reception and increases the possible bit rate by over 30% for single transmitters (as in the UK) and will increase the maximum bit rate by over 50% in large [[single-frequency network]]s (as in Germany and [[Sweden]]).\n\nDVB has established a 3D TV group (CM-3DTV) to identify \"what kind of 3D-TV solution does the market want and need, and how can DVB play an active part in the creation of that solution?\" The CM-3DTV group held a DVB 3D-TV Kick-off Workshop in Geneva on 25 January 2010, followed by the first CM-3DTV meeting the next day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvb.org/news_events/news/dvb-3d-tv-workshop/index.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115043236/http://www.dvb.org/news_events/news/dvb-3d-tv-workshop/index.xml |archivedate=15 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> DVB now defines a new standard for 3D video broadcast: [[DVB 3D-TV]].\n\nModes and features of latest DVB-x2 system standards in comparison:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!\n!DVB-S2\n!DVB-T2\n!DVB-C2\n|-\n|[[Input device|Input]] [[Interface (computing)|interface]]\n|Multiple [[transport stream]] and [[generic stream encapsulation]] (GSE)\n|Multiple transport stream and generic stream encapsulation (GSE)\n|Multiple transport stream and generic stream encapsulation (GSE)\n|-\n|Modes\n|[[Variable coding]] & modulation and [[adaptive coding]] & modulation\n|Variable coding & modulation<ref name=\"DVB BlueBook A122, page 18\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvb.org/technology/standards/A122_DVB-T2_Spec.pdf|title=Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Frame structure channel coding and modulation for a second generation digital terrestrial television broadcasting system (DVB-T2)|publisher=DVB consortium|date=February 2011}}</ref>\n|Variable coding & modulation and adaptive coding & modulation\n|-\n|[[Forward error correction|FEC]]\n|[[LDPC]] + [[BCH code|BCH]] 1/4, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 8/9, 9/10\n|LDPC + BCH 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6\n|LDPC + BCH 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 8/9, 9/10<ref name=\"DVB BlueBook A138, page 29\">{{cite web|url=http://www.telcogroup.ru/files/materials-pdf/DVB_standards/DVB-C/a138_DVB-C2.pdf|title=Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Frame structure channel coding and modulation for a second generation digital transmission system for cable systems (DVB-C2)|publisher=DVB consortium|date=2010-05-07}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Modulation]]\n|Single carrier [[QPSK]] with multiple streams\n|[[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|OFDM]]\n|absolute OFDM<ref name=\"DVB BlueBook A147, page 31, New concept of absolute OFDM\">{{cite web|url=http://digitus.itk.ppke.hu/~takacsgy/a147_DVB-C2_Imp-Guide%5B1%5D.pdf|title=Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Implementation Guidelines for a second generation digital cable transmission system (DVB-C2)|publisher=DVB consortium|date=2010-11-19}}</ref>\n|-\n|Modulation schemes\n|QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-APSK, 32-APSK\n|QPSK, 16-[[QAM]], 64-QAM, 256-QAM\n|16- to 4096-QAM\n|-\n|[[Guard interval]]\n|Not applicable\n|1/4, 19/256, 1/8, 19/128, 1/16, 1/32, 1/128\n|1/64 or 1/128\n|-\n|Fourier transform size\n|Not applicable\n|1k, 2k, 4k, 8k, 16k, 32k [[Discrete Fourier transform|DFT]]\n|4k [[Fast Fourier transform|Inverse FFT]]<ref name=\"DVB-C2 The second generation transmission technology for broadband cable, page 5, OFDM generator\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ict-redesign.eu/fileadmin/documents/0904_DVB-C2_Cable_Show_Washington_Jaeger_rev2.pdf|title=DVB-C2 The second generation transmission technology for broadband cable|publisher=Dirk Jaeger, Philipp Hasse, Joerg Robert, Institut fuer Nachrichtentechnik at Technische Universitaet Braunschweig|date=2009-04-08|access-date=24 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402083731/http://www.ict-redesign.eu/fileadmin/documents/0904_DVB-C2_Cable_Show_Washington_Jaeger_rev2.pdf|archive-date=2 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Interleaving (bitmaps)|Interleaving]]\n|Bit-Interleaving\n|Bit- time- and frequency-interleaving\n|Bit- time- and frequency-interleaving\n|-\n|[[Pilot signal|Pilots]]\n|Pilot symbols\n| Scattered and continual pilots\n| Scattered and continual pilots\n|}\n\n==Content==\n[[Digital video]] content is encoded using [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT) based [[video coding standards]], such as the [[H.26x]] and [[MPEG]] formats. [[Digital audio]] content is encoded using [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT) based [[audio coding standards]], such as [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (AAC), [[Dolby Digital]] (AC-3) and [[MP3]].\n\nBesides [[digital audio]] and [[digital video]] transmission, DVB also defines data connections (DVB-DATA - [[European standards|EN]] 301 192) with [[return channel]]s (DVB-RC) for several media ([[Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications|DECT]], [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]], [[Public Switched Telephone Network|PSTN]]/[[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]], [[satellite]] etc.) and protocols ([[DVB-IPTV]]: [[Internet Protocol]]; DVB-NPI: network protocol independent).\n\nOlder technologies such as [[teletext]] (DVB-TXT) and [[vertical blanking interval]] data (DVB-VBI) are also supported by the standards to ease conversion. However, for many applications more advanced alternatives like DVB-SUB for subtitling are available.\n\n==Encryption and metadata==\nThe [[conditional access]] system (DVB-CA) defines a [[Common Scrambling Algorithm]] (DVB-CSA) and a physical [[Common Interface]] ([[DVB-CI]]) for accessing [[scrambler|scrambled]] content. DVB-CA providers develop their wholly proprietary conditional access systems with reference to these specifications. Multiple simultaneous CA systems can be assigned to a scrambled DVB program stream providing operational and commercial flexibility for the service provider.\n\nDVB is also developing a Content Protection and Copy Management system for protecting content after it has been received ([[DVB-CPCM]]), which is intended to allow flexible use of recorded content on a home network or beyond, while preventing unconstrained sharing on the Internet. DVB-CPCM has been the source of much controversy in the popular press and it is said that CPCM is the DVB's answer to the failed American [[Broadcast Flag]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/IP/DVB/dvb_critique.php |title=Europe's Broadcast Flag |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |date=2005-09-29 |accessdate=2007-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051013061942/http://www.eff.org/IP/DVB/dvb_critique.php |archive-date=13 October 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDVB transports include [[metadata]] called [[Service Information]] (DVB-SI, ETSI EN 300 468, ETSI TR 101 211) that links the various elementary streams into coherent programs and provides [[human-readable]] descriptions for [[electronic program guide]]s as well as for automatic searching and filtering.  The dating system used with this metadata suffers from a [[year 2038 problem]] in which due to the limited 16 bits and [[modified Julian day]] offset used will cause an overflow issue similar to the [[year 2000 problem]].  By comparison, the rival [[DigiCipher 2]] based [[ATSC]] system will not have this issue until 2048 due in part to 32 bits being used.{{cn|date=September 2015}}\n\nRecently, DVB has adopted a profile of the metadata defined by the [[TV-Anytime]] Forum (DVB-TVA, ETSI TS 102323). This is an XML Schema based technology and the DVB profile is tailored for enhanced [[digital video recorder|Personal Digital Recorders]]. DVB lately also started an activity to develop a service for [[IPTV]] (DVB-IPI, ETSI TR 102033, ETSI TS 102034, ETSI TS 102814) which also includes metadata definitions for a broadband content guide (DVB-BCG, ETSI TS 102 539).\n\n==Software platform==\n{{Main|Interactive television#User Interaction}}\nThe [[Multimedia Home Platform|DVB Multimedia Home Platform]] (DVB-MHP) defines a [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based platform for the development of consumer video system applications. In addition to providing abstractions for many DVB and [[MPEG-2]] concepts, it provides interfaces for other features like network card control, application download, and layered graphics.\n\n== Return channel ==\n{{Main|DVB-RCS}}\nDVB has standardised a number of return channels that work together with DVB(-S/T/C) to create [[wikt:bidirectional|bi-directional]] communication. RCS is short for [[Return Channel Satellite]], and specifies return channels in [[C band (IEEE)|C]], [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>]] and [[Ka band|K<sub>a</sub>]] frequency bands with return bandwidth of up to 2&nbsp;[[Mbit]]/s. DVB-RCT is short for [[Return Channel Terrestrial]], specified by ETSI EN 301958.\n\n==Adoption==\n[[Image:Digital broadcast standards.svg|thumb|400px|right|DTT broadcasting systems.]]\nDVB-S and DVB-C were ratified in 1994. DVB-T was ratified in early 1997. The first commercial DVB-T broadcasts were performed by the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Digital TV Group]] in late 1998. In 2003 [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] was the first area to completely stop broadcasting analog TV signals. Most European countries are fully covered by digital television and many have switched off [[PAL]]/[[SECAM]] services.\n\nIn [[Europe]], as well as in [[Australia]], [[South Africa]] and [[India]], DVB is used throughout. This also holds true for cable and satellite in most [[Asia]]n, [[Africa]]n and many [[South America]]n countries. Many of these have not yet selected a format for digital terrestrial broadcasts (DTTV) and a few ([[Canada]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Mexico]], [[South Korea]] and the [[United States]]) have chosen ATSC instead of DVB-T.\n\n===Africa===\n\n====Kenya====\nDVB-T broadcasts were launched by the [[President of Kenya]], [[Mwai Kibaki]] on 9 December 2009. Broadcasts are using [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]], with the [[University of Nairobi]] supplying the decoders. [[Kenya]] has also been broadcasting DVB-H since July 2009, available on selected [[Nokia]] and [[ZTE]] handsets on the [[Safaricom]] and other GSM networks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/819994/-/vnlh64/-/ |title=Digital TV a reality in Kenya |publisher=Nation Media |accessdate=2009-12-09}}</ref>\n\n====Madagascar====\nSince 2011, the pay TV operator Blueline<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blueline.mg|title=Blueline Madagascar|author=|date=|website=www.blueline.mg|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> launched a DVB-T service branded BluelineTV.<ref>[http://www.blueline.mg/tv BluelineTV]</ref> It supplies both smart cards and set-top-boxes.\n\n====South Africa====\nSince 1995, the pay TV operator [[DStv]] used the DVB-S standard to broadcast its services. In 2010 it started a DVB over IP service, and in 2011 it started DStv mobile using the DVB-H standard.<ref>http://www.multichoice.co.za/multichoice/content/en/page44122</ref>\n\nIn late 2010, the South African cabinet endorsed a decision by a [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) task team to adopt the DVB-T2 standard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fin24.com/Economy/SA-to-adopt-European-TV-standard-report-20110104 |title=SA to adopt European TV standard: report |publisher=24.com |accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref>\n\n===Asia===\nIn Asia several Standards are under implementation\n====China====\n\n====Hong Kong====\nIn [[Hong Kong]], several cable TV operators such as [[TVB Pay Vision]] and [[Cable TV Hong Kong|Cable TV]] have already started using DVB-S or DVB-C. The government however has adopted the [[DMB-T/H]] standard, developed in [[mainland China]], for its digital terrestrial broadcasting services which has started since 31 December 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltv.gov.hk/general/news_26112007.htm|title=Digital TV|website=www.digitaltv.gov.hk|accessdate=1 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721092023/http://www.digitaltv.gov.hk/general/news_26112007.htm|archive-date=21 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Iran====\nOn 17 March 2009, DVB-H and DVB-T H.264/AAC broadcasting started in [[Tehran]].\nDVB-T broadcasting now available in other cities like: Isfahan, Mashhad, Shiraz, Qom, [[Tabriz]] and Rasht.\n\n====Israel====\nDVB-T broadcasts using [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] commenced in [[Israel]] on 1 June 2009 with the broadcast trial and the full broadcast began on 2 August 2009. Analog broadcasts were originally planned to end in 18 months after the launch, but analog broadcasts were switched off on 31 March 2011 instead.\n\nDuring 2010, DVB-T broadcasts have become widely available in most of Israel and an EPG was added to the broadcasts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvb.org/about_dvb/dvb_worldwide/israel/index.xml|title=About - DVB|author=|date=|website=www.dvb.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Japan====\nWith the exception of [[SKY PerfecTV!]], [[Japan]] uses different formats in all areas ([[Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting|ISDB]]), which are however quite similar to their DVB counterparts. SkyPerfect is a satellite provider using DVB on its 124 and 128 degrees east satellites. Its satellite at 110 degrees east does not use DVB, however.\n\n====Malaysia====\nIn [[Malaysia]], a new pay television station [[MiTV]] began service in September 2005 using [[DVB-IPTV]] technology while lone satellite programming provider [[Astro (satellite TV)|ASTRO]] has been transmitting in DVB-S since its inception in 1996. Free-to-air DVB-T trials began in late 2006 with a simulcast of both TV1 and TV2 plus a new channel called RTM3/RTMi. In April 2007, RTM announced that the outcome of the test was favourable and that it expected DVB-T to go public by the end of 2007. However, the system did not go public as planned. As of 2008, the trial digital line-up has expanded to include a music television channel called [[Muzik Aktif]], and a sports channel called Arena, with a news channel called Berita Aktif planned for inclusion in the extended trials soon. Also, high definition trials were performed during the Beijing Olympics and the outcome was also favourable. It was announced that the system would go public in 2009.\n\nIn 2009, MiTV closed down, changed its name to U-Television and announced that it was changing to scrambled DVB-T upon relaunch instead of the [[DVB-IPTV]] system used prior to shutting down. However, RTM's digital network again did not go public, although around this time TVs that are first-generation DVB-T capable went on sale. The government has since announced that they will be deploying DVB-T2 instead in stages starting in mid-2015 and analog shutoff has been delayed to April 2019.\n\n====Philippines====\nIn the [[Philippines]], DVB-S and DVB-S2 are the two broadcast standards currently used by satellite companies, while DVB-C is also used by some cable companies. The government adopted DVB-T in November 2006 for digital terrestrial broadcasting but a year later, it considered other standards to replace DVB-T. The country has chosen the ISDB-T system instead of DVB-T.\n\n====Taiwan====\n{{update|section|date=May 2016}}\nIn [[Taiwan]], some digital cable television systems use DVB-C, though most customers still use analog NTSC cable television. The government planned adopting ATSC or the Japanese ISDB-T standard as NTSC's replacement. However, the country has chosen the European DVB-T system instead. Public Television Service (PTS) and Formosan TV now provided high definition television.  The former has a channel called HiHD; the latter uses its HD channel for broadcasting MLB baseball.\n\n===Europe===\n{{update|European countries that use DVB but are not in this list|January 1018|date=January 2018}}\n====Cyprus====\n[[Cyprus]] uses DVB-T with MPEG-4 encoding. Analog transmission stopped on 1 July 2011 for all channels except [[CyBC|CyBC 1]].\n\n====Denmark====\nIn [[Denmark]], DVB-T replaced the analog transmission system for TV on 1 November 2009. Danish national digital TV transmission has been outsourced to the company Boxer TV A/S,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxertv.dk|title=Fleksible tv-pakker og bredb\u00e5nd hos Boxer - Tv-udbyder med valgfrihed|author=|date=|website=www.boxertv.dk|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> acting as gatekeeper organization for terrestrial TV transmission in Denmark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kum.dk/graphics/kum/downloads/Pressemeddelelser/Pressemeddelelse+fra+N%25E6vnet+UK.pdf|title=Kulturministeriets hjemmeside|author=|date=|website=www.kum.dk|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kum.dk/sw69161.asp|title=Kulturministeriets hjemmeside|website=www.kum.dk|accessdate=1 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008071354/http://www.kum.dk/sw69161.asp|archive-date=8 October 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, there are still several free channels from [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]].\n\n====Finland====\n{{see also|Television in Finland}}\nDVB-T transmissions were launched on 21 August 2001. The analogue networks continued alongside the digital ones until 1 September 2007, when they were shut down nationwide. Before the analogue switchoff, the terrestrial network had three multiplexes: MUX A, MUX B and MUX C. MUX A contained the channels of the public broadcaster [[Yleisradio]] and MUX B was shared between the two commercial broadcasters: [[MTV3]] and [[Nelonen]]. MUX C contained channels of various other broadcasters. After the analogue closedown, a fourth multiplex named MUX E was launched. All of the [[Yleisradio]] (YLE) channels are broadcast free-to-air, likewise a handful of commercial ones including [[MTV3]], [[Nelonen]], [[Subtv]], [[Jim (TV channel)|Jim]], [[Nelonen Sport]], [[Liv (TV channel)|Liv]], [[FOX (Finland)|FOX]], [[TV Viisi|TV5]] [[Finland]], [[AVA (TV channel)|AVA]] and [[The Voice TV Finland|Kutonen]]. There are also several pay channels sold by [[PlusTV]].\n\n====Italy====\n{{see also|Television in Italy}}\nIn Italy, DVB-S started in 1996 and the final analogue broadcasts were terminated in 2005. The switch-off from analogue terrestrial network to DVB-T started on 15 October 2008. Analogue broadcast was ended on 4 July 2012 after nearly four years of transition in phases.\n\n====Netherlands====\nIn the [[Netherlands]], DVB-S broadcasting started on 1 July 1996, satellite provider MultiChoice (now [[CanalDigitaal]]) switched off the analogue service shortly after on 18 August 1996. DVB-T broadcasting started April 2003, and terrestrial analog broadcasting was switched off December 2006. It was initially marketed by [[Digitenne]] but later by [[KPN]]. Multiplex 1 contains the [[NPO 1]], [[NPO 2]] and [[NPO 3]] national TV channels, and a regional channel. Multiplexes 2~5 have the other encrypted commercial and international channels. Multiplex 1 also broadcasts the radio channels Radio 1, Radio 2, 3 FM, Radio 4, Radio 5, Radio 6, Concertzender, FunX and also a regional channel. As of June 2011, the Dutch DVB-T service had 29 TV channels and 20 radio channels (including free to air channels). DVB-T2 will be introduced during 2019/2020.\n\n====Norway====\nIn [[Norway]], DVB-T broadcasting is marketed under RiksTV (encrypted pay channels) and [[NRK]] (unencrypted public channels). DVB-T broadcasting via the terrestrial network began in November 2007, and has subsequently been rolled out one part of the country at a time. The Norwegian implementation of DVB-T is different from most others, as it uses [[H.264]] with [[HE-AAC]] audio encoding, while most other countries have adapted the less recent [[MPEG-2]] standard. Notably most DVB software for PC has problems with this, though in late 2007 compatible software was released, like [[DVBViewer]] using the [[Advanced Audio Coding#FAAC and FAAD2|libfaad2]] library. [[Sony]] has released several HDTVs (Bravia W3000, X3000, X3500, E4000, V4500, W4000, W4500, X4500) that support Norway's DVB-T implementation without use of a separate [[set-top box]], and Sagem ITD91 HD, Grundig DTR 8720 STBs are others.\n\n====Poland====\nCurrently, [[Poland]] uses the DVB-T standard with MPEG-4 encoding. Analogue broadcast switch-off started on 7 November 2012 and was completed on 23 July 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mac.gov.pl/naziemna-telewizja-cyfrowa/ |title=General information about the digital broadcasting system in Poland |publisher=Ministry of Administration and Digitalization of Poland |accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref>\n\n====Portugal====\n[[Portugal]] follows the DVB-T implementation, using H.264 with AAC audio encoding. It has been live since 29 April 2009 and the switch-off date for all analog signals was on 26 April 2012.\n\n====Romania====\n[[Romania]] started digital terrestrial broadcasting in 2005 but it was virtually unknown by many people in Romania due to the lack of content, cable TV and satellite TV being far more popular, however it was the first platform to deliver HD content. Today, Romania is using DVB-T2 as terrestrial standard,  but also DVB-S/S2, and DVB-C which is extremely popular. The only analogue broadcast remains on cable. Romania adopted the DVB-T2 standard in 2016 after a series of tests with mpeg2, mpeg4 on DVB-T, and has today fully implemented DVB-T2. DVB-C, which was introduced in late 2005, still remains with mpeg2 on SD content and mpeg4 on HD content. DVB-S (introduced in 2004 focus sat being the first such platform) is used in basic packages with standard definition content, while DVB-S2 set top boxes are provided for both SD and HD content.\n\n====Russia====\nFully switched to digital in 2019, [[Russia]] uses the DVB-T2 standart for broadcasting 2 channel packs with about ten main national radio and TV channels ([[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]], [[Rossiya 1]]/2/K/24, [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]], [[Radio Mayak]], [[Radio Rossii]] etc.\n\n====United Kingdom====\n{{see also|Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom}}\nIn the UK DVB-T has been adopted for broadcast of standard definition terrestrial programming, as well as a single DVB-T2 multiplex for high-definition programming. The UK terminated all analogue terrestrial broadcasts by the end of 2012. The vast majority of channels are available [[free-to-air]] through the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] service. DVB-T was also used for the now-defunct [[ITV Digital|ONDigital/ITV Digital]] and [[Top Up TV]] service.\n\nAll satellite programming (some of which is available free-to-air via [[Freesat]] or [[free-to-view]] via [[Freesat from Sky]]; the remainder requires a subscription to [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]]), is broadcast using either DVB-S or DVB-S2.\n\nSubscription-based cable television from [[Virgin Media]] uses DVB-C, alongside a limited selection of analogue channels.\n\n===North America===\nIn [[North America]], [[DVB-S]] is often used in encoding and [[video compression]] of digital satellite communications alongside [[Hughes DSS]]. Unlike [[Motorola]]'s [[DigiCipher 2]] standard, DVB has a wider adoption in terms of the number of manufacturers of receivers. Terrestrial digital television broadcasts in Canada, Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, and the United States use ATSC encoding with [[8VSB]] modulation instead of DVB-T with [[COFDM]].  Television newsgathering links from mobile vans to central receive points (often on mountaintops or tall buildings) use DVB-T with COFDM in the 2 GHz frequency band.\n\n===Oceania===\n====Australia====\nIn [[Australia]], DVB broadcasting is marketed under the [[Freeview (Australia)|Freeview]] brand name, and more recently 'Freeview Plus', denoting the integration of online [[HbbTV]] and EPG in certain DVB devices. Regular broadcasts began in January 2001 using MPEG 2 video and MPEG 1 audio in SD and HD.\n\nChanges to broadcasting rules have enabled broadcasters to offer multi-channeling, prompting broadcasters to use H.264 video with MPEG 1 or AAC audio encoding for some secondary channels.\n\nSpecifications for HD channels now differ depending on the broadcaster. ABC, Nine and Ten use 1920x1080i MPEG 4 video with [[Dolby Digital]] audio. Seven and SBS use 1440x1080i MPEG 2 video with Dolby Digital and MPEG 1 audio respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://about.abc.net.au/press-releases/abc-is-changing-to-hd/ |title=ABC HD is now live |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=27 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n====New Zealand====\nIn [[New Zealand]], DVB broadcasting is marketed under the [[Freeview (New Zealand)|Freeview]] brand name. SD [[MPEG-2]] DVB-S broadcasts via satellite began on 2 May 2007 and DVB-T (terrestrial) broadcasts began April 2008 broadcasting in HD H.264 video with HE-AAC audio.\n\n=== South America ===\n\n==== Colombia ====\nSince 2008, [[Colombia]] has adopted as a public policy the decision to migrate from the analog television implemented in 1954 to [[Digital terrestrial television|Digital Terrestrial Television]] ([[DVB-T2]]). This measure allows the viewers access to the open television ([[Terrestrial television|OTA]]) of public and private channels, with video quality in [[High-definition television|HD]]. As planned, analogue television broadcasts will end in 2021.\n\n==<ref>{{Cite book|title=Digital Television : Satellite, Cable, Terrestrial, IPTV, Mobile TV in the DVB Framework.|last=Benoit, Herve.|date=2009|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-136-02714-7|oclc=1024255874}}</ref>DVB compliant products==\nCompanies that manufacture a product which is compliant to one or more DVB standards have the option of registering a declaration of conformity for that product.

DVB standards are maintained by the '''DVB Project''', an international industry consortium,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvb.org/|title=DVB - Digital Video Broadcasting|author=|date=|website=www.dvb.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> and are published by a Joint Technical Committee (JTC) of the [[European Telecommunications Standards Institute]] (ETSI), [[European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization]] (CENELEC) and [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU). \n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Transmission==\nDVB systems distribute data using a variety of approaches, including:\n* [[Satellite television|Satellite]]: [[DVB-S]], [[DVB-S2]]  and [[DVB-SH]]\n** [[DVB-SMATV]] for distribution via [[SMATV]]\n* [[Cable television|Cable]]: [[DVB-C]], [[DVB-C2]]\n* [[Digital terrestrial television|Terrestrial television]]: [[DVB-T]], [[DVB-T2]]\n** Digital terrestrial television for [[handheld]]s: [[DVB-H]], [[DVB-SH]]\n* [[Microwave]]: using [[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]] ([[DVB-MT]]), the [[MMDS]] ([[DVB-MC]]), and/or [[MVDS]] standards ([[DVB-MS]])\n\nThese standards define the [[physical layer]] and [[data link layer]] of the distribution system. Devices interact with the physical layer via a synchronous parallel interface (SPI), synchronous serial interface (SSI) or [[asynchronous serial interface]] (ASI). All data is transmitted in [[MPEG transport stream]]s with some additional constraints (DVB-MPEG). A standard for temporally-compressed distribution to mobile devices (DVB-H) was published in November 2004.\n\nThese distribution systems differ mainly in the [[modulation]] schemes used and error correcting codes used, due to the different technical constraints. DVB-S ([[Super high frequency|SHF]]) uses [[QPSK]], 8-PSK or 16-[[Quadrature amplitude modulation|QAM]]. DVB-S2 uses QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-APSK or 32-APSK, at the broadcasters decision. QPSK and 8-PSK are the only versions regularly used. DVB-C ([[Very high frequency|VHF]]/[[Ultra high frequency|UHF]]) uses [[Quadrature amplitude modulation|QAM]]: 16-QAM, 32-QAM, 64-QAM, 128-QAM or 256-QAM. Lastly, DVB-T (VHF/UHF) uses 16-QAM or 64-QAM (or QPSK) in combination with [[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|(C)OFDM]] and can support [[hierarchical modulation]].\n\nThe DVB-T2 specification was approved by the DVB Steering Board in June 2008 and sent to ETSI for adoption as a formal standard. ETSI adopted the standard on 9 September 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://webapp.etsi.org/workProgram/Report_Schedule.asp?WKI_ID=28396 |title=Work Programme: Details of 'DEN/JTC-DVB-228' Work Item Schedule |publisher=ETSI |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> The DVB-T2 standard gives more robust TV reception and increases the possible bit rate by over 30% for single transmitters (as in the UK) and will increase the maximum bit rate by over 50% in large [[single-frequency network]]s (as in Germany and [[Sweden]]).\n\nDVB has established a 3D TV group (CM-3DTV) to identify \"what kind of 3D-TV solution does the market want and need, and how can DVB play an active part in the creation of that solution?\" The CM-3DTV group held a DVB 3D-TV Kick-off Workshop in Geneva on 25 January 2010, followed by the first CM-3DTV meeting the next day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dvb.org/news_events/news/dvb-3d-tv-workshop/index.xml |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115043236/http://www.dvb.org/news_events/news/dvb-3d-tv-workshop/index.xml |archivedate=15 January 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> DVB now defines a new standard for 3D video broadcast: [[DVB 3D-TV]].\n\nModes and features of latest DVB-x2 system standards in comparison:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!\n!DVB-S2\n!DVB-T2\n!DVB-C2\n|-\n|[[Input device|Input]] [[Interface (computing)|interface]]\n|Multiple [[transport stream]] and [[generic stream encapsulation]] (GSE)\n|Multiple transport stream and generic stream encapsulation (GSE)\n|Multiple transport stream and generic stream encapsulation (GSE)\n|-\n|Modes\n|[[Variable coding]] & modulation and [[adaptive coding]] & modulation\n|Variable coding & modulation<ref name=\"DVB BlueBook A122, page 18\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dvb.org/technology/standards/A122_DVB-T2_Spec.pdf|title=Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Frame structure channel coding and modulation for a second generation digital terrestrial television broadcasting system (DVB-T2)|publisher=DVB consortium|date=February 2011}}</ref>\n|Variable coding & modulation and adaptive coding & modulation\n|-\n|[[Forward error correction|FEC]]\n|[[LDPC]] + [[BCH code|BCH]] 1/4, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 8/9, 9/10\n|LDPC + BCH 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6\n|LDPC + BCH 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 8/9, 9/10<ref name=\"DVB BlueBook A138, page 29\">{{cite web|url=http://www.telcogroup.ru/files/materials-pdf/DVB_standards/DVB-C/a138_DVB-C2.pdf|title=Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Frame structure channel coding and modulation for a second generation digital transmission system for cable systems (DVB-C2)|publisher=DVB consortium|date=2010-05-07}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Modulation]]\n|Single carrier [[QPSK]] with multiple streams\n|[[Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing|OFDM]]\n|absolute OFDM<ref name=\"DVB BlueBook A147, page 31, New concept of absolute OFDM\">{{cite web|url=http://digitus.itk.ppke.hu/~takacsgy/a147_DVB-C2_Imp-Guide%5B1%5D.pdf|title=Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB); Implementation Guidelines for a second generation digital cable transmission system (DVB-C2)|publisher=DVB consortium|date=2010-11-19}}</ref>\n|-\n|Modulation schemes\n|QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-APSK, 32-APSK\n|QPSK, 16-[[QAM]], 64-QAM, 256-QAM\n|16- to 4096-QAM\n|-\n|[[Guard interval]]\n|Not applicable\n|1/4, 19/256, 1/8, 19/128, 1/16, 1/32, 1/128\n|1/64 or 1/128\n|-\n|Fourier transform size\n|Not applicable\n|1k, 2k, 4k, 8k, 16k, 32k [[Discrete Fourier transform|DFT]]\n|4k [[Fast Fourier transform|Inverse FFT]]<ref name=\"DVB-C2 The second generation transmission technology for broadband cable, page 5, OFDM generator\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ict-redesign.eu/fileadmin/documents/0904_DVB-C2_Cable_Show_Washington_Jaeger_rev2.pdf|title=DVB-C2 The second generation transmission technology for broadband cable|publisher=Dirk Jaeger, Philipp Hasse, Joerg Robert, Institut fuer Nachrichtentechnik at Technische Universitaet Braunschweig|date=2009-04-08|access-date=24 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402083731/http://www.ict-redesign.eu/fileadmin/documents/0904_DVB-C2_Cable_Show_Washington_Jaeger_rev2.pdf|archive-date=2 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|-\n|[[Interleaving (bitmaps)|Interleaving]]\n|Bit-Interleaving\n|Bit- time- and frequency-interleaving\n|Bit- time- and frequency-interleaving\n|-\n|[[Pilot signal|Pilots]]\n|Pilot symbols\n| Scattered and continual pilots\n| Scattered and continual pilots\n|}\n\n==Content==\n[[Digital video]] content is encoded using [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT) based [[video coding standards]], such as the [[H.26x]] and [[MPEG]] formats. [[Digital audio]] content is encoded using [[modified discrete cosine transform]] (MDCT) based [[audio coding standards]], such as [[Advanced Audio Coding]] (AAC), [[Dolby Digital]] (AC-3) and [[MP3]].\n\nBesides [[digital audio]] and [[digital video]] transmission, DVB also defines data connections (DVB-DATA - [[European standards|EN]] 301 192) with [[return channel]]s (DVB-RC) for several media ([[Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications|DECT]], [[Global System for Mobile Communications|GSM]], [[Public Switched Telephone Network|PSTN]]/[[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]], [[satellite]] etc.) and protocols ([[DVB-IPTV]]: [[Internet Protocol]]; DVB-NPI: network protocol independent).\n\nOlder technologies such as [[teletext]] (DVB-TXT) and [[vertical blanking interval]] data (DVB-VBI) are also supported by the standards to ease conversion. However, for many applications more advanced alternatives like DVB-SUB for subtitling are available.\n\n==Encryption and metadata==\nThe [[conditional access]] system (DVB-CA) defines a [[Common Scrambling Algorithm]] (DVB-CSA) and a physical [[Common Interface]] ([[DVB-CI]]) for accessing [[scrambler|scrambled]] content. DVB-CA providers develop their wholly proprietary conditional access systems with reference to these specifications. Multiple simultaneous CA systems can be assigned to a scrambled DVB program stream providing operational and commercial flexibility for the service provider.\n\nDVB is also developing a Content Protection and Copy Management system for protecting content after it has been received ([[DVB-CPCM]]), which is intended to allow flexible use of recorded content on a home network or beyond, while preventing unconstrained sharing on the Internet. DVB-CPCM has been the source of much controversy in the popular press and it is said that CPCM is the DVB's answer to the failed American [[Broadcast Flag]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eff.org/IP/DVB/dvb_critique.php |title=Europe's Broadcast Flag |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |date=2005-09-29 |accessdate=2007-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051013061942/http://www.eff.org/IP/DVB/dvb_critique.php |archive-date=13 October 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nDVB transports include [[metadata]] called [[Service Information]] (DVB-SI, ETSI EN 300 468, ETSI TR 101 211) that links the various elementary streams into coherent programs and provides [[human-readable]] descriptions for [[electronic program guide]]s as well as for automatic searching and filtering.  The dating system used with this metadata suffers from a [[year 2038 problem]] in which due to the limited 16 bits and [[modified Julian day]] offset used will cause an overflow issue similar to the [[year 2000 problem]].  By comparison, the rival [[DigiCipher 2]] based [[ATSC]] system will not have this issue until 2048 due in part to 32 bits being used.{{cn|date=September 2015}}\n\nRecently, DVB has adopted a profile of the metadata defined by the [[TV-Anytime]] Forum (DVB-TVA, ETSI TS 102323). This is an XML Schema based technology and the DVB profile is tailored for enhanced [[digital video recorder|Personal Digital Recorders]]. DVB lately also started an activity to develop a service for [[IPTV]] (DVB-IPI, ETSI TR 102033, ETSI TS 102034, ETSI TS 102814) which also includes metadata definitions for a broadband content guide (DVB-BCG, ETSI TS 102 539).\n\n==Software platform==\n{{Main|Interactive television#User Interaction}}\nThe [[Multimedia Home Platform|DVB Multimedia Home Platform]] (DVB-MHP) defines a [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based platform for the development of consumer video system applications. In addition to providing abstractions for many DVB and [[MPEG-2]] concepts, it provides interfaces for other features like network card control, application download, and layered graphics.\n\n== Return channel ==\n{{Main|DVB-RCS}}\nDVB has standardised a number of return channels that work together with DVB(-S/T/C) to create [[wikt:bidirectional|bi-directional]] communication. RCS is short for [[Return Channel Satellite]], and specifies return channels in [[C band (IEEE)|C]], [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>]] and [[Ka band|K<sub>a</sub>]] frequency bands with return bandwidth of up to 2&nbsp;[[Mbit]]/s. DVB-RCT is short for [[Return Channel Terrestrial]], specified by ETSI EN 301958.\n\n==Adoption==\n[[Image:Digital broadcast standards.svg|thumb|400px|right|DTT broadcasting systems.]]\nDVB-S and DVB-C were ratified in 1994. DVB-T was ratified in early 1997. The first commercial DVB-T broadcasts were performed by the [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Digital TV Group]] in late 1998. In 2003 [[Berlin]], [[Germany]] was the first area to completely stop broadcasting analog TV signals. Most European countries are fully covered by digital television and many have switched off [[PAL]]/[[SECAM]] services.\n\nIn [[Europe]], as well as in [[Australia]], [[South Africa]] and [[India]], DVB is used throughout. This also holds true for cable and satellite in most [[Asia]]n, [[Africa]]n and many [[South America]]n countries. Many of these have not yet selected a format for digital terrestrial broadcasts (DTTV) and a few ([[Canada]], [[El Salvador]], [[Honduras]], [[Mexico]], [[South Korea]] and the [[United States]]) have chosen ATSC instead of DVB-T.\n\n===Africa===\n\n====Kenya====\nDVB-T broadcasts were launched by the [[President of Kenya]], [[Mwai Kibaki]] on 9 December 2009. Broadcasts are using [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]], with the [[University of Nairobi]] supplying the decoders. [[Kenya]] has also been broadcasting DVB-H since July 2009, available on selected [[Nokia]] and [[ZTE]] handsets on the [[Safaricom]] and other GSM networks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nation.co.ke/News/-/1056/819994/-/vnlh64/-/ |title=Digital TV a reality in Kenya |publisher=Nation Media |accessdate=2009-12-09}}</ref>\n\n====Madagascar====\nSince 2011, the pay TV operator Blueline<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blueline.mg|title=Blueline Madagascar|author=|date=|website=www.blueline.mg|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> launched a DVB-T service branded BluelineTV.<ref>[http://www.blueline.mg/tv BluelineTV]</ref> It supplies both smart cards and set-top-boxes.\n\n====South Africa====\nSince 1995, the pay TV operator [[DStv]] used the DVB-S standard to broadcast its services. In 2010 it started a DVB over IP service, and in 2011 it started DStv mobile using the DVB-H standard.<ref>http://www.multichoice.co.za/multichoice/content/en/page44122</ref>\n\nIn late 2010, the South African cabinet endorsed a decision by a [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC) task team to adopt the DVB-T2 standard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fin24.com/Economy/SA-to-adopt-European-TV-standard-report-20110104 |title=SA to adopt European TV standard: report |publisher=24.com |accessdate=2011-01-18}}</ref>\n\n===Asia===\nIn Asia several Standards are under implementation\n====China====\n\n====Hong Kong====\nIn [[Hong Kong]], several cable TV operators such as [[TVB Pay Vision]] and [[Cable TV Hong Kong|Cable TV]] have already started using DVB-S or DVB-C. The government however has adopted the [[DMB-T/H]] standard, developed in [[mainland China]], for its digital terrestrial broadcasting services which has started since 31 December 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltv.gov.hk/general/news_26112007.htm|title=Digital TV|website=www.digitaltv.gov.hk|accessdate=1 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721092023/http://www.digitaltv.gov.hk/general/news_26112007.htm|archive-date=21 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Iran====\nOn 17 March 2009, DVB-H and DVB-T H.264/AAC broadcasting started in [[Tehran]].\nDVB-T broadcasting now available in other cities like: Isfahan, Mashhad, Shiraz, Qom, [[Tabriz]] and Rasht.\n\n====Israel====\nDVB-T broadcasts using [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] commenced in [[Israel]] on 1 June 2009 with the broadcast trial and the full broadcast began on 2 August 2009. Analog broadcasts were originally planned to end in 18 months after the launch, but analog broadcasts were switched off on 31 March 2011 instead.\n\nDuring 2010, DVB-T broadcasts have become widely available in most of Israel and an EPG was added to the broadcasts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvb.org/about_dvb/dvb_worldwide/israel/index.xml|title=About - DVB|author=|date=|website=www.dvb.org|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Japan====\nWith the exception of [[SKY PerfecTV!]], [[Japan]] uses different formats in all areas ([[Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting|ISDB]]), which are however quite similar to their DVB counterparts. SkyPerfect is a satellite provider using DVB on its 124 and 128 degrees east satellites. Its satellite at 110 degrees east does not use DVB, however.\n\n====Malaysia====\nIn [[Malaysia]], a new pay television station [[MiTV]] began service in September 2005 using [[DVB-IPTV]] technology while lone satellite programming provider [[Astro (satellite TV)|ASTRO]] has been transmitting in DVB-S since its inception in 1996. Free-to-air DVB-T trials began in late 2006 with a simulcast of both TV1 and TV2 plus a new channel called RTM3/RTMi. In April 2007, RTM announced that the outcome of the test was favourable and that it expected DVB-T to go public by the end of 2007. However, the system did not go public as planned. As of 2008, the trial digital line-up has expanded to include a music television channel called [[Muzik Aktif]], and a sports channel called Arena, with a news channel called Berita Aktif planned for inclusion in the extended trials soon. Also, high definition trials were performed during the Beijing Olympics and the outcome was also favourable. It was announced that the system would go public in 2009.\n\nIn 2009, MiTV closed down, changed its name to U-Television and announced that it was changing to scrambled DVB-T upon relaunch instead of the [[DVB-IPTV]] system used prior to shutting down. However, RTM's digital network again did not go public, although around this time TVs that are first-generation DVB-T capable went on sale. The government has since announced that they will be deploying DVB-T2 instead in stages starting in mid-2015 and analog shutoff has been delayed to April 2019.\n\n====Philippines====\nIn the [[Philippines]], DVB-S and DVB-S2 are the two broadcast standards currently used by satellite companies, while DVB-C is also used by some cable companies. The government adopted DVB-T in November 2006 for digital terrestrial broadcasting but a year later, it considered other standards to replace DVB-T. The country has chosen the ISDB-T system instead of DVB-T.\n\n====Taiwan====\n{{update|section|date=May 2016}}\nIn [[Taiwan]], some digital cable television systems use DVB-C, though most customers still use analog NTSC cable television. The government planned adopting ATSC or the Japanese ISDB-T standard as NTSC's replacement. However, the country has chosen the European DVB-T system instead. Public Television Service (PTS) and Formosan TV now provided high definition television.  The former has a channel called HiHD; the latter uses its HD channel for broadcasting MLB baseball.\n\n===Europe===\n{{update|European countries that use DVB but are not in this list|January 1018|date=January 2018}}\n====Cyprus====\n[[Cyprus]] uses DVB-T with MPEG-4 encoding. Analog transmission stopped on 1 July 2011 for all channels except [[CyBC|CyBC 1]].\n\n====Denmark====\nIn [[Denmark]], DVB-T replaced the analog transmission system for TV on 1 November 2009. Danish national digital TV transmission has been outsourced to the company Boxer TV A/S,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxertv.dk|title=Fleksible tv-pakker og bredb\u00e5nd hos Boxer - Tv-udbyder med valgfrihed|author=|date=|website=www.boxertv.dk|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> acting as gatekeeper organization for terrestrial TV transmission in Denmark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kum.dk/graphics/kum/downloads/Pressemeddelelser/Pressemeddelelse+fra+N%25E6vnet+UK.pdf|title=Kulturministeriets hjemmeside|author=|date=|website=www.kum.dk|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kum.dk/sw69161.asp|title=Kulturministeriets hjemmeside|website=www.kum.dk|accessdate=1 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008071354/http://www.kum.dk/sw69161.asp|archive-date=8 October 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, there are still several free channels from [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]].\n\n====Finland====\n{{see also|Television in Finland}}\nDVB-T transmissions were launched on 21 August 2001. The analogue networks continued alongside the digital ones until 1 September 2007, when they were shut down nationwide. Before the analogue switchoff, the terrestrial network had three multiplexes: MUX A, MUX B and MUX C. MUX A contained the channels of the public broadcaster [[Yleisradio]] and MUX B was shared between the two commercial broadcasters: [[MTV3]] and [[Nelonen]]. MUX C contained channels of various other broadcasters. After the analogue closedown, a fourth multiplex named MUX E was launched. All of the [[Yleisradio]] (YLE) channels are broadcast free-to-air, likewise a handful of commercial ones including [[MTV3]], [[Nelonen]], [[Subtv]], [[Jim (TV channel)|Jim]], [[Nelonen Sport]], [[Liv (TV channel)|Liv]], [[FOX (Finland)|FOX]], [[TV Viisi|TV5]] [[Finland]], [[AVA (TV channel)|AVA]] and [[The Voice TV Finland|Kutonen]]. There are also several pay channels sold by [[PlusTV]].\n\n====Italy====\n{{see also|Television in Italy}}\nIn Italy, DVB-S started in 1996 and the final analogue broadcasts were terminated in 2005. The switch-off from analogue terrestrial network to DVB-T started on 15 October 2008. Analogue broadcast was ended on 4 July 2012 after nearly four years of transition in phases.\n\n====Netherlands====\nIn the [[Netherlands]], DVB-S broadcasting started on 1 July 1996, satellite provider MultiChoice (now [[CanalDigitaal]]) switched off the analogue service shortly after on 18 August 1996. DVB-T broadcasting started April 2003, and terrestrial analog broadcasting was switched off December 2006. It was initially marketed by [[Digitenne]] but later by [[KPN]]. Multiplex 1 contains the [[NPO 1]], [[NPO 2]] and [[NPO 3]] national TV channels, and a regional channel. Multiplexes 2~5 have the other encrypted commercial and international channels. Multiplex 1 also broadcasts the radio channels Radio 1, Radio 2, 3 FM, Radio 4, Radio 5, Radio 6, Concertzender, FunX and also a regional channel. As of June 2011, the Dutch DVB-T service had 29 TV channels and 20 radio channels (including free to air channels). DVB-T2 will be introduced during 2019/2020.\n\n====Norway====\nIn [[Norway]], DVB-T broadcasting is marketed under RiksTV (encrypted pay channels) and [[NRK]] (unencrypted public channels). DVB-T broadcasting via the terrestrial network began in November 2007, and has subsequently been rolled out one part of the country at a time. The Norwegian implementation of DVB-T is different from most others, as it uses [[H.264]] with [[HE-AAC]] audio encoding, while most other countries have adapted the less recent [[MPEG-2]] standard. Notably most DVB software for PC has problems with this, though in late 2007 compatible software was released, like [[DVBViewer]] using the [[Advanced Audio Coding#FAAC and FAAD2|libfaad2]] library. [[Sony]] has released several HDTVs (Bravia W3000, X3000, X3500, E4000, V4500, W4000, W4500, X4500) that support Norway's DVB-T implementation without use of a separate [[set-top box]], and Sagem ITD91 HD, Grundig DTR 8720 STBs are others.\n\n====Poland====\nCurrently, [[Poland]] uses the DVB-T standard with MPEG-4 encoding. Analogue broadcast switch-off started on 7 November 2012 and was completed on 23 July 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mac.gov.pl/naziemna-telewizja-cyfrowa/ |title=General information about the digital broadcasting system in Poland |publisher=Ministry of Administration and Digitalization of Poland |accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref>\n\n====Portugal====\n[[Portugal]] follows the DVB-T implementation, using H.264 with AAC audio encoding. It has been live since 29 April 2009 and the switch-off date for all analog signals was on 26 April 2012.\n\n====Romania====\n[[Romania]] started digital terrestrial broadcasting in 2005 but it was virtually unknown by many people in Romania due to the lack of content, cable TV and satellite TV being far more popular, however it was the first platform to deliver HD content. Today, Romania is using DVB-T2 as terrestrial standard,  but also DVB-S/S2, and DVB-C which is extremely popular. The only analogue broadcast remains on cable. Romania adopted the DVB-T2 standard in 2016 after a series of tests with mpeg2, mpeg4 on DVB-T, and has today fully implemented DVB-T2. DVB-C, which was introduced in late 2005, still remains with mpeg2 on SD content and mpeg4 on HD content. DVB-S (introduced in 2004 focus sat being the first such platform) is used in basic packages with standard definition content, while DVB-S2 set top boxes are provided for both SD and HD content.\n\n====Russia====\nFully switched to digital in 2019, [[Russia]] uses the DVB-T2 standart for broadcasting 2 channel packs with about ten main national radio and TV channels ([[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]], [[Rossiya 1]]/2/K/24, [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]], [[Radio Mayak]], [[Radio Rossii]] etc.\n\n====United Kingdom====\n{{see also|Digital terrestrial television in the United Kingdom}}\nIn the UK DVB-T has been adopted for broadcast of standard definition terrestrial programming, as well as a single DVB-T2 multiplex for high-definition programming. The UK terminated all analogue terrestrial broadcasts by the end of 2012. The vast majority of channels are available [[free-to-air]] through the [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] service. DVB-T was also used for the now-defunct [[ITV Digital|ONDigital/ITV Digital]] and [[Top Up TV]] service.\n\nAll satellite programming (some of which is available free-to-air via [[Freesat]] or [[free-to-view]] via [[Freesat from Sky]]; the remainder requires a subscription to [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]]), is broadcast using either DVB-S or DVB-S2.\n\nSubscription-based cable television from [[Virgin Media]] uses DVB-C, alongside a limited selection of analogue channels.\n\n===North America===\nIn [[North America]], [[DVB-S]] is often used in encoding and [[video compression]] of digital satellite communications alongside [[Hughes DSS]]. Unlike [[Motorola]]'s [[DigiCipher 2]] standard, DVB has a wider adoption in terms of the number of manufacturers of receivers. Terrestrial digital television broadcasts in Canada, Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, and the United States use ATSC encoding with [[8VSB]] modulation instead of DVB-T with [[COFDM]].  Television newsgathering links from mobile vans to central receive points (often on mountaintops or tall buildings) use DVB-T with COFDM in the 2 GHz frequency band.\n\n===Oceania===\n====Australia====\nIn [[Australia]], DVB broadcasting is marketed under the [[Freeview (Australia)|Freeview]] brand name, and more recently 'Freeview Plus', denoting the integration of online [[HbbTV]] and EPG in certain DVB devices. Regular broadcasts began in January 2001 using MPEG 2 video and MPEG 1 audio in SD and HD.\n\nChanges to broadcasting rules have enabled broadcasters to offer multi-channeling, prompting broadcasters to use H.264 video with MPEG 1 or AAC audio encoding for some secondary channels.\n\nSpecifications for HD channels now differ depending on the broadcaster. ABC, Nine and Ten use 1920x1080i MPEG 4 video with [[Dolby Digital]] audio. Seven and SBS use 1440x1080i MPEG 2 video with Dolby Digital and MPEG 1 audio respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://about.abc.net.au/press-releases/abc-is-changing-to-hd/ |title=ABC HD is now live |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=27 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n====New Zealand====\nIn [[New Zealand]], DVB broadcasting is marketed under the [[Freeview (New Zealand)|Freeview]] brand name. SD [[MPEG-2]] DVB-S broadcasts via satellite began on 2 May 2007 and DVB-T (terrestrial) broadcasts began April 2008 broadcasting in HD H.264 video with HE-AAC audio.\n\n=== South America ===\n\n==== Colombia ====\nSince 2008, [[Colombia]] has adopted as a public policy the decision to migrate from the analog television implemented in 1954 to [[Digital terrestrial television|Digital Terrestrial Television]] ([[DVB-T2]]). This measure allows the viewers access to the open television ([[Terrestrial television|OTA]]) of public and private channels, with video quality in [[High-definition television|HD]]. As planned, analogue television broadcasts will end in 2021.\n\n==<ref>{{Cite book|title=Digital Television : Satellite, Cable, Terrestrial, IPTV, Mobile TV in the DVB Framework.|last=Benoit, Herve.|date=2009|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-136-02714-7|oclc=1024255874}}</ref>DVB compliant products==\nCompanies that manufacture a product which is compliant to one or more DVB standards have the option of registering a declaration of conformity for that product.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a total population of 59,515. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]]<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> and about {{convert|12|mi|km}} north and slightly west of the Detroit city limits.\n\nFounded in 1818, Pontiac is notably the second European-American organized settlement in Michigan in close proximity to Detroit, second only to [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]]. It was named after [[Pontiac (Ottawa leader)|Pontiac]], a war chief of the [[Ottawa people]], who had occupied the area before the European-American settlers. The city was best known for its [[General Motors]] automobile manufacturing plants of the 20th century, which were the basis of its economy and contributed to the wealth of the region. These included [[Fisher Body]], [[Pontiac East Assembly]] (a.k.a. Truck & Coach/Bus), which manufactured [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] products, and the Pontiac Motor Division. In the city's heyday, it was the site of the primary automobile assembly plant for the production of the famed [[Pontiac]] cars, a brand that was named after the city. The Pontiac itself was discontinued in 2010 by General Motors. The City of Pontiac also was home to [[Oakland (automobile)|Oakland Motor Car Company]], which was acquired by General Motors in 1909.\n\nIn 1975, the city built the [[Pontiac Silverdome]], the stadium that hosted the [[Detroit Lions]] of the [[National Football League]] from 1975 to 2001, when the team returned to Downtown Detroit at [[Ford Field]]. [[Super Bowl XVI]] was played at the Silverdome in 1982. After 2001, the stadium continued to be used for concerts and other events until it was demolished in 2018.\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|20.28|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|19.97|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.31|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=November 25, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220065340/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=February 20, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nPontiac is bounded by the city of [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]] to the east and north, the city of [[Lake Angelus, Michigan|Lake Angelus]] to the north, [[Waterford Township, Michigan|Waterford Township]] to the west, and [[Bloomfield Township, Oakland County, Michigan|Bloomfield Township]] to the south.\n\nThe former [[Pontiac Township, Michigan|Pontiac Township]] included what are now the cities of Pontiac, Lake Angelus, and Auburn Hills.

Two years later the fledgling settlement was designated as the county seat for Oakland County. The Pontiac Company, consisting of 15 members and chaired by Solomon Sibley of [[Detroit]], comprised the first landowners in Pontiac. Sibley, along with [[Stephen Mack]] and Shubael Conant, Pontiac Company members, also formed the partnership Mack, Conant & Sibley to develop a town. Solomon and his wife Sarah Sibley largely financed construction of the first buildings. While Solomon was the first chair of the Pontiac Company, for two years Sarah Sibley was the most active as the go-between with settlers at Pontiac. Solomon Sibley was constantly traveling as a Territorial Congressman and later a Territorial Supreme Court judge.<ref>Deed, \"Mill Privilege,\" Oakland County, MI; Letter Sarah Sibley to Solomon, 1822, Sibley manuscript files, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library</ref>\n\nIn the 1820s Elizabeth Denison, an unmarried, free black woman, worked for the Sibleys. They helped her buy land in Pontiac in 1825. Stephen Mack, agent for the Pontiac Company, signed the deed at the request of the Sibleys, conveying 48.5 acres to Elizabeth Denison. She is believed to be the first black woman to purchase land in the new territory of Michigan.<ref>Lisette, Swan, Elizabeth 1965; deeds, Oakland County, Michigan; ''Original Pontiac Company minutes,'' Pontiac Public Library</ref>\n\nIn 1837 Pontiac became a village, the same year that Michigan gained statehood.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yieMyqJ5rFMC&pg=PA133 ''Acts of the Legislature of the State of Michigan Passed at the Annual Session of 1837]'', p. 133.

From the beginning, Pontiac's central location served it well. It attracted professional people, including doctors and lawyers, and soon became a center of industry. Woolen and grist mills made use of the [[Clinton River (Michigan)|Clinton River]] as a power source.\n\nAbundant natural resources led to the establishment of several carriage manufacturing companies, all of which were thriving at the turn of the 20th century.

The Emergency Manager was authorized to make day-to-day executive and financial municipal decisions. The position was not subject to the usual checks and balances, nor to election. The first and second managers, Fred Leeb and Michael Stampfler, were appointed by Michigan Governor [[Jennifer Granholm]]. The third manager was Louis Schimmel, who was appointed by Governor [[Rick Snyder]].\n\nIn order to balance the budget, state-appointed emergency managers drastically revised labor union contracts with the city, sold off city assets such as parking meters, and privatized most public services. The Oakland County Sheriff's Office handles all police (saving $2 million a year) and nearby Waterford township has responsibility for fire protection (saving $3 million). Pontiac sold its water treatment plant for $55 million, and outsources garbage collection, animal control, vital records and street maintenance. Many people working in City Hall are employed by contractors. The city payroll has declined from 600 to 50 employees. The Silverdome Stadium, once valued at $22 million, was sold for $583,000 (it would end up being demolished in December 2017). The emergency managers reduced the city's annual spending to $36 million from $57 million, and erased almost all of its long-term debt.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yaccino|first1=Steven|title=Lessons for Detroit in a City's Takeover|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/us/lessons-for-detroit-in-pontiacs-years-of-emergency-oversight.html?pagewanted=all|website=New York Times|accessdate=30 November 2014|date=2013-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2013, Schimmel resigned as Emergency Financial Manager.

Its vacancy rates were high, and the city did not want to continue the high maintenance costs. New thinking about downtown was to re-emphasize the street grid; the city wanted to reconnect Saginaw Street to the downtown area. Owners of the connecting Ottawa Towers filed an injunction, claiming the demolition would devalue their property and result in lost parking. In December 2012, a judge granted an injunction for the Ottawa Towers on an \"expedited calendar\", which prevented the demolition of the Phoenix Center for the time being.<ref>{{cite web |title=Injunction keeps Phoenix Center standing |url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20121130/NEWS/121139978/injunction-keeps-phoenix-center-standing |publisher=Crain's Detroit Business |accessdate=January 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, city leaders and business owners had launched \"The Rise of The Phoenix\" initiative. This plan was intended to attract businesses interested in downtown retail space. The applicants selected would be given free rent in exchange for multi-year leases (two years or more) as well as one year of free parking in city lots. Some 52 new businesses were recruited to locate in downtown Pontiac, bringing new life to the city. Plans for the development of mixed-use and loft flats in downtown were announced in September 2011 by the Michigan Economic Growth Authority (MEGA). MEGA estimates the development could generate $20.4 million in new investment and create up to 107 permanent full-time jobs in downtown. The development was to be supported by a state tax break.<ref>{{cite web |author=SHAUN BYRONOf The Oakland Press |url=http://www.theoaklandpress.com/articles/2011/09/13/news/doc4e6f9a12d0b1b835475669.txt |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130411225343/http://www.theoaklandpress.com/articles/2011/09/13/news/doc4e6f9a12d0b1b835475669.txt |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 11, 2013 |title=Large-scale commercial, residential development for downtown Pontiac secures state tax break |website=Theoaklandpress.com |date=September 13, 2011 |accessdate=August 17, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nOn January 26, 2012, West Construction Services began the renovation and restoration of the former [[Sears]] building for the Lafayette Place Lofts, the largest construction investment in Downtown Pontiac in approximately 30 years.

state of [[Michigan]], located in [[Metro Detroit]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a total population of 59,515. It is the [[county seat]] of [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]]<ref name=\"GR6\">{{cite web|url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx|accessdate=2011-06-07|title=Find a County|publisher=National Association of Counties}}</ref> and about {{convert|12|mi|km}} north and slightly west of the Detroit city limits.\n\nFounded in 1818, Pontiac is notably the second European-American organized settlement in Michigan in close proximity to Detroit, second only to [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]]. It was named after [[Pontiac (Ottawa leader)|Pontiac]], a war chief of the [[Ottawa people]], who had occupied the area before the European-American settlers. The city was best known for its [[General Motors]] automobile manufacturing plants of the 20th century, which were the basis of its economy and contributed to the wealth of the region. These included [[Fisher Body]], [[Pontiac East Assembly]] (a.k.a. Truck & Coach/Bus), which manufactured [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]] products, and the Pontiac Motor Division. In the city's heyday, it was the site of the primary automobile assembly plant for the production of the famed [[Pontiac]] cars, a brand that was named after the city. The Pontiac itself was discontinued in 2010 by General Motors. The City of Pontiac also was home to [[Oakland (automobile)|Oakland Motor Car Company]], which was acquired by General Motors in 1909.\n\nIn 1975, the city built the [[Pontiac Silverdome]], the stadium that hosted the [[Detroit Lions]] of the [[National Football League]] from 1975 to 2001, when the team returned to Downtown Detroit at [[Ford Field]]. [[Super Bowl XVI]] was played at the Silverdome in 1982. After 2001, the stadium continued to be used for concerts and other events until it was demolished in 2018.\n\n== Geography ==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|20.28|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|19.97|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.31|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=November 25, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110220065340/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt|archivedate=February 20, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nPontiac is bounded by the city of [[Auburn Hills, Michigan|Auburn Hills]] to the east and north, the city of [[Lake Angelus, Michigan|Lake Angelus]] to the north, [[Waterford Township, Michigan|Waterford Township]] to the west, and [[Bloomfield Township, Oakland County, Michigan|Bloomfield Township]] to the south.\n\nThe former [[Pontiac Township, Michigan|Pontiac Township]] included what are now the cities of Pontiac, Lake Angelus, and Auburn Hills.

Two years later the fledgling settlement was designated as the county seat for Oakland County. The Pontiac Company, consisting of 15 members and chaired by Solomon Sibley of [[Detroit]], comprised the first landowners in Pontiac. Sibley, along with [[Stephen Mack]] and Shubael Conant, Pontiac Company members, also formed the partnership Mack, Conant & Sibley to develop a town. Solomon and his wife Sarah Sibley largely financed construction of the first buildings. While Solomon was the first chair of the Pontiac Company, for two years Sarah Sibley was the most active as the go-between with settlers at Pontiac. Solomon Sibley was constantly traveling as a Territorial Congressman and later a Territorial Supreme Court judge.<ref>Deed, \"Mill Privilege,\" Oakland County, MI; Letter Sarah Sibley to Solomon, 1822, Sibley manuscript files, Burton Historical Collection, Detroit Public Library</ref>\n\nIn the 1820s Elizabeth Denison, an unmarried, free black woman, worked for the Sibleys. They helped her buy land in Pontiac in 1825. Stephen Mack, agent for the Pontiac Company, signed the deed at the request of the Sibleys, conveying 48.5 acres to Elizabeth Denison.

The Emergency Manager was authorized to make day-to-day executive and financial municipal decisions. The position was not subject to the usual checks and balances, nor to election. The first and second managers, Fred Leeb and Michael Stampfler, were appointed by Michigan Governor [[Jennifer Granholm]]. The third manager was Louis Schimmel, who was appointed by Governor [[Rick Snyder]].\n\nIn order to balance the budget, state-appointed emergency managers drastically revised labor union contracts with the city, sold off city assets such as parking meters, and privatized most public services. The Oakland County Sheriff's Office handles all police (saving $2 million a year) and nearby Waterford township has responsibility for fire protection (saving $3 million). Pontiac sold its water treatment plant for $55 million, and outsources garbage collection, animal control, vital records and street maintenance. Many people working in City Hall are employed by contractors. The city payroll has declined from 600 to 50 employees. The Silverdome Stadium, once valued at $22 million, was sold for $583,000 (it would end up being demolished in December 2017). The emergency managers reduced the city's annual spending to $36 million from $57 million, and erased almost all of its long-term debt.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Yaccino|first1=Steven|title=Lessons for Detroit in a City's Takeover|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/us/lessons-for-detroit-in-pontiacs-years-of-emergency-oversight.html?pagewanted=all|website=New York Times|accessdate=30 November 2014|date=2013-03-13}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2013, Schimmel resigned as Emergency Financial Manager.

Its vacancy rates were high, and the city did not want to continue the high maintenance costs. New thinking about downtown was to re-emphasize the street grid; the city wanted to reconnect Saginaw Street to the downtown area. Owners of the connecting Ottawa Towers filed an injunction, claiming the demolition would devalue their property and result in lost parking. In December 2012, a judge granted an injunction for the Ottawa Towers on an \"expedited calendar\", which prevented the demolition of the Phoenix Center for the time being.<ref>{{cite web |title=Injunction keeps Phoenix Center standing |url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20121130/NEWS/121139978/injunction-keeps-phoenix-center-standing |publisher=Crain's Detroit Business |accessdate=January 10, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, city leaders and business owners had launched \"The Rise of The Phoenix\" initiative.

Some 52 new businesses were recruited to locate in downtown Pontiac, bringing new life to the city. Plans for the development of mixed-use and loft flats in downtown were announced in September 2011 by the Michigan Economic Growth Authority (MEGA).

\"'''Cowboy Joe'''\" or \"'''Country Joe'''\", is an American professional [[baseball]] [[baseball umpire|umpire]] in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). Born in [[Asheville, North Carolina]], he grew up in [[Greenville, North Carolina|Greenville]] and played football at [[East Carolina University]] (ECU) and [[Elon University|Elon College]]. West entered the [[National League]] as an umpire in 1976; he joined the NL staff full-time in 1978. West has worn uniform number 22 throughout his career. As a young umpire, West worked [[Nolan Ryan]]'s fifth career [[no-hitter]], was on the field for [[Willie McCovey]]'s 500th [[home run]], and was involved in a 1983 pushing incident with manager [[Joe Torre]].\n\nA few years later, West was the home plate umpire during the 1988 playoff game in which pitcher [[Jay Howell]] was ejected for having [[Pine tar#Use of pine tar in baseball|pine tar on his glove]]. In 1990, he threw pitcher [[Dennis Cook]] to the ground while attempting to break up a fight. West resigned during the [[1999 Major League Umpires Association mass resignation]], but was rehired in 2002. Since then, he has umpired throughout MLB. In a 2004 playoff game between the [[Boston Red Sox]] and [[New York Yankees]], West's crew made a controversial decision that necessitated police presence to calm the crowd. He served as crew chief for the [[2005 World Series]], and officiated in the [[2009 World Baseball Classic]].\n\nIn 2010, West attracted media attention after he publicly complained about the slow pace of a game between the Red Sox and Yankees. He also worked the game that year in which [[Albert Pujols]] hit his 400th career home run. West has worked several no-hitters, including a 2012 [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] by [[F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez]]. As of 2016, he has the longest tenure of any MLB umpire. West has appeared in six [[World Series]], three [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Games]], ten [[League Championship Series]] (LCS), eight [[Division Series|League Division Series]] (LDS) and two [[Major League Baseball Wild Card Game|Wild Card Games]].\n\nWest is president of the [[World Umpires Association]] (WUA). As the organization's president, West helped negotiate the largest umpiring contract in baseball history. He works with a sporting goods company to design and patent umpiring equipment endorsed by MLB. West is also a singer and songwriter, and has released two [[country music]] albums. He had a small acting role in the comedy film ''[[The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!]]'' and a cameo appearance in the television crime drama ''[[The Oldest Rookie]].'' He plays golf on the Celebrity Players Tour.\n\n==Early life==\nWest was born in [[Asheville, North Carolina]], in 1952.
