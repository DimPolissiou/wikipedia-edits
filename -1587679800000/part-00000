James J. Strang, who had declared himself Smith's successor, established Voree, then within the [[Wisconsin Territory]] as a \"gathering place\" for those Latter Day Saints who chose to follow his leadership rather than that of [[Brigham Young]] or other claimants. Strang's followers moved from [[Nauvoo, Illinois]] and other places to Voree. Young's followers relocated to the [[Salt Lake Valley]] in what would ultimately become the [[Utah Territory]], where they established [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], which is now the largest \"Mormon\" denomination.

The church excavated a foundation for their intended [[Temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple]], but were unable to finish it due to poverty and internal dissent.

[[Baptism for the Dead|Baptisms for the Dead]] were performed in the White River, which flowed through the settlement.

Additional trouble ensued when a group of Strangite leaders, led by [[Aaron Smith (Strangite)|Aaron Smith]], rejected Strang and formed a [[schism]]atic group in Voree. For these and other reasons, Strang relocated his church headquarters to [[Beaver Island (Lake Michigan)|Beaver Island]] by 1848. Most of his members followed him where he was crowned the Mormon king of Beaver Island, though a small minority elected to remain in Voree. Opposition in Beaver Island ultimately led to the fatal wounding of Strang in June 1856; he returned to Voree, where he died weeks after the shooting. His followers were forcibly expelled from the island, and most abandoned his church entirely. A loyal remnant remained, however, with many of them choosing to return to Voree and nearby areas.

England.\n\n==History==\nThe hospital, which was designed by [[George Gilbert Scott]] and [[William Bonython Moffatt]] using a Corridor Plan layout, opened as the North and East Ridings Pauper Lunatic Asylum in April 1847.<ref name=county>{{cite web|url=https://www.countyasylums.co.uk/clifton-york/|title=Clifton Hospital|publisher=County Asylums|accessdate=12 April 2019}}</ref> The hospital was considerably extended in stages to designs developed by [[George Fowler Jones]] in the second half of the 19th century.<ref name=county/>\n\nIt became the North Riding Lunatic Asylum in 1865 and the North Riding Mental Hospital in 1920 before joining the [[National Health Service]] as Clifton Hospital in 1948.<ref name=na>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/hospitalrecords/details.asp?id=1565|title=Clifton Hospital, York|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=12 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter the introduction of [[Care in the Community]] in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and closed in July 1994.<ref name=county/> The main building was demolished and the site was redeveloped in part as offices for [[Norwich Union]] and in part for residential use as \"Clifton Park\" but the original chapel survives.<ref name=county/> The Clifton Park NHS Treatment Centre was erected on the

However, it lent the title to [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]]'s book ''[[News from Tartary]]'', which detailed his travels in Central Asia.\n\n== Tartary in art ==\nIn the novel ''[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle|Ada]]'' by [[Vladimir Nabokov]], Tartary is the name of a large country on the fictional planet of [[Antiterra]]. [[Russia]] is Tartary's approximate geographic counterpart on Terra, Antiterra's twin world apparently identical to \"our\" Earth, but doubly fictional in the context of the novel.\n\n\"[[The Squire's Tale]]\" from [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' is set in the royal court of Tartary.\n\nIn [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', the eponymous hero refers to his travels in Tartary on two occasions, and suggests that the then modern geographers of Europe were \"in a great error, by supposing nothing but sea between Japan and California; for it was ever my opinion, that there must be a balance of earth to counterpoise the great continent of Tartary\".\n\nA main character, Calaf, in the opera ''[[Turandot]]'' by [[Giacomo Puccini]] is the Prince of Tartary.\n\n[[L. Frank Baum]]'s origin story of [[Santa Claus]], ''[[The Life and Adventures of Santa Claus]]'', features mythical antagonists from Tartary who oppose Santa's compassionate gift giving practices. They are described as the Three-Eyed Giants of Tartary.\n\nIn [[Walter de la Mare]]'s poem \"If I were lord of Tartary\", Tartary is an land full of happiness.\n\nPriest [[\u00c9variste R\u00e9gis Huc]] wrote several books chronicling his journeys the region, collectively known as ''Remembrances of a Journey in Tartary, Tibet, and China during the Years 1844, 1845, and 1846''.\n\n==See also==\n\n* [[Cossack]]\n* [[Golden Horde]]\n* [[Khanate of Crimea]]\n* [[Mongol Empire]]\n* [[Tatars]]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* Elliott, Mark C. \"The Limits of Tartary: Manchuria in Imperial and National Geographies.\" The Journal of Asian Studies 59, no. 3 (August 2000): 603\u201346. doi:10.2307/2658945.\n* Sela, Ron. \"SVETLANA GORSHENINA.

However, it lent the title to [[Peter Fleming (writer)|Peter Fleming]]'s book ''[[News from Tartary]]'', which detailed his travels in Central Asia.\n\n== Tartary in art ==\nIn the novel ''[[Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle|Ada]]'' by [[Vladimir Nabokov]], Tartary is the name of a large country on the fictional planet of [[Antiterra]]. [[Russia]] is Tartary's approximate geographic counterpart on Terra, Antiterra's twin world apparently identical to \"our\" Earth, but doubly fictional in the context of the novel.\n\n\"[[The Squire's Tale]]\" from [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' is set in the royal court of Tartary.\n\nIn [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', the eponymous hero refers to his travels in Tartary on two occasions, and suggests that the then modern geographers of Europe were \"in a great error, by supposing nothing but sea between Japan and California; for it was ever my opinion, that there must be a balance of earth to counterpoise the great continent of Tartary\".\n\nA main character, Calaf, in the opera ''[[Turandot]]'' by [[Giacomo Puccini]] is the Prince of Tartary.\n\n[[L.

Grant''' began on March 4, 1869, when [[Ulysses Gilmore]] was [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|18th]] [[president of the United States]], and ended on March 4, 1877. Grant took office in the aftermath of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and he presided over much of the [[Reconstruction Era]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], [[Ulysses Gilmore]] became president after defeating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Horatio Seymour]] in the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]]. He was reelected in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]] in a [[landslide victory]], overcoming a split in the Republican Party that resulted in the formation of the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republicans]], which nominated [[Horace Greeley]] to oppose him. He was succeeded as president by Republican [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] after the contested [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]].\n\nReconstruction took precedence during Grant's two terms of office. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] caused widespread violence throughout the South against African Americans. By 1870, all former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] states had been readmitted into the United States and were represented in Congress. However Democrats, or former slave owners, violently refused to accept that freedmen were citizens, who were granted suffrage by the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]. By 1871 Klan activity was becoming out of control, while Grant and Congress created the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and had passed three [[Force Acts]]. Grant and his Attorney General [[Amos T. Akerman]] began a crackdown on Klan in the South, starting in South Carolina, making arrests and convictions, causing the Klan to demobilize and ensuring a fair election for 1872. Rather than develop a cadre of trustworthy political advisers, Grant was self-reliant in choosing his [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]]. He relied heavily on former Army associates, who had a thin understanding of politics and a weak sense of civilian ethics. Numerous scandals plagued his administration, including allegations of bribery, fraud, and cronyism. In 1872, Grant signed into law an [[Act of Congress]] that established [[Yellowstone National Park]], the nation's first National Park.\n\nA strong economy, reduction of the national debt, federal spending, tariffs, and the federal workforce, aided Grant in getting reelected. Congress established a de facto deflationary [[gold standard]] that reduced the number of [[Greenback (1860s money)|greenbacks]] in the national economy.\nHowever, financial overinvestment in railroad construction, caused the [[Panic of 1873]], and economic turmoil. The [[Long Depression]] that followed, and Grant's veto of an inflation bill, turned public opinion against him. Democrats regained control of the House in the [[United States elections, 1874|1874 elections]]. While scandals escalated, reformers appointed by Grant were able to clean up some federal departments. Most notably, Secretary of the Treasury [[Benjamin Bristow]] prosecuted the [[Whiskey Ring]], leading to the indictment of Grant's personal secretary, [[Orville E. Babcock]].  Grant continued to support Reconstruction, and he signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]], which banned discrimination in [[public accommodations]]. Secretary of War [[William W. Belknap]] suddenly resigned office in February 1876; afterwards impeached by the House for taking kickbacks. When Grant left office in 1877, [[Redeemers]] in the South, controlled all state governments.\n\nThe United States was at peace with the world throughout Grant's eight years in office, but his handling of foreign policy was uneven. Tensions with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes in the West continued. Under the talented Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]], the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]] restored relations with Britain and resolved the contentious [[Alabama Claims|''Alabama'' Claims]], while the [[Virginius Affair|''Virginius'' Affair]] with [[Spain]] was settled peacefully. Grant attempted to [[Annexation of Santo Domingo|annex]] the Caribbean island of [[Santo Domingo]], but the annexation was blocked by the Senate.\n\nWith the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, the West was wide open to expansionism that sometimes was challenged by hostile Native Americans. Grant pursued a ''Peace'' policy with Native Americans, but persistent western expansion by settlers made conflict difficult to avoid. Grant presided over the [[Great Sioux War of 1876]] and other clashes with the Native Americans. Grant's presidency was traditionally denounced by historians due to corruption charges among subordinates, despite efforts of reform in his administration. His presidential reputation has greatly risen over the past few decades among historians who have noted that Grant advanced a modern presidency, that included a reformed Indian policy, [[African American]] civil rights, the first Civil Service Commission, and protected women under federal law.\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Election of 1868==\n{{main|United States presidential election, 1868}}\n[[File:Grant-Colfax.png|right|thumb|250px|Grant-Colfax Campaign Poster 1868]]\nGrant's rise in political popularity among Republicans was based on his Union military service during the Civil War, his successful generalship that defeated [[Robert E. Lee]], and his break from President [[Andrew Johnson]] over the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]], when Grant returned the War Office back to [[Edwin Stanton]].{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=244}} His presidential nomination was unopposed and inevitable. The Republican Party delegates unanimously nominated Ulysses S. Grant (''Ohio'') the Republican Party presidential candidate at its May convention held in Chicago.  [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Schuyler Colfax]] (''Indiana''), was chosen its vice presidential candidate.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=244}} The 1868 Republican Party platform advocated enfranchisement of [[African Americans]] in the South but kept the issue open in the North. It opposed using [[Greenback (money)|greenbacks]], only gold, to redeem U.S. bonds, encouraged immigration, endorsed full rights for naturalized citizens, and favored radical reconstruction as distinct from the more lenient policy espoused by President [[Andrew Johnson]].{{sfn|Republican Party National Platform May 1868}} In Grant's acceptance letter he said: \"Let us have peace.\"{{sfn|Simpson|2014|page=246}}{{efn|Historian Brooks Simpson says these four simple words expressed the \"innermost desires of many Americans.\"{{sfn|Simpson|2014|page=246}}}} These words became the Republican popular mantra.{{sfnm|Simpson|2014|1p=246|Simon|2002|2p=244}}\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1868.svg|thumb|left|200px|Electoral Vote Results 1868]]\nThe Democratic Party, divided by the Civil War, reunited and was determined to take back the presidency. Democrats accepted the end of slavery and focused on economic policy.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=245}} The party held its July convention in New York at Tammany Hall. [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]], leader of the Ku Klux Klan, attended its proceedings.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=46}} The party delegates finally nominated [[Horatio Seymour]] (''New York'') the Democratic Party presidential candidate. Seymour was the war governor of New York but had been reluctant to send Union troops to the war front, favored the anti-war [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]], and ineptly handled the New York draft riots. To counter Seymour's political liabilities, the delegates nominated [[Francis Preston Blair Jr.|Francis P. Blair]] (''Missouri'') for vice president. Although Blair was a Union soldier who served under General [[William T. Sherman]], Blair's campaign rhetoric was caustic and said Reconstruction governments in the South were corrupt and out of control.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=245}} The Democratic Party platform advocated war bonds be redeemed with $100,000,000 in [[Greenback (money)|greenback]]s and the rest with gold. It advocated former Confederates be allowed to hold elective offices.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=245}}\n\nGrant won the presidential election with an overwhelming [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] victory, receiving 214 votes to Seymour's 80. Grant also received 52.7 percent of the popular vote nationwide. Grant's margin of victory was enhanced by six southern states controlled by Republicans, while many ex-Confederates were still prevented from voting.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=245}}\n\n==First term 1869\u20131873==\n[[file:Inauguration of President Grant - NARA - 528934.jpg|270px|right|thumb|''Inauguration of President Grant''<br>Mathew Brady March 4, 1869]]\n\nOn March 4, 1869, Grant was sworn in as the eighteenth president of the United States by Chief Justice [[Salmon P. Chase]]. At age forty-six, he was the youngest president yet elected.{{sfn|White|2016|p=471}} In his inaugural address, Grant urged the ratification of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] and said he would approach Reconstruction \"calmly, without prejudice, hate or sectional pride.\"{{sfn|Patrick|1968|p=166}} He also recommended the \"proper treatment\" of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] be studied, advocating their civilization and eventual citizenship.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=305}} Grant pledged all laws would be \"faithfully executed\" and argued war bonds redeemed in gold would lower future interest rates.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=246}}\n\nGrant's [[Ulysses S.

Washburne]] Secretary of State, as a friendship courtesy, only to briefly serve office, and then be appointed Minister to France. Grant then appointed conservative [[Hamilton Fish]], former governor of New York, to succeed Washburne.  Grant appointed wealthy New York merchant [[Alexander T. Stewart]] Secretary of Treasury, but he was quickly found to be disqualified by a federal law that prohibited anyone in office to engage in commerce. When Congress would not amend the law, an embarrassed Grant appointed Massachusetts Congressman [[George S. Boutwell]], to replace Stewart.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=246}}\n\nGrant appointed close friend [[John A. Rawlins]] Secretary of War. After serving only a few months Rawlins died in office. Afterward, Grant appointed [[William W. Belknap]] of [[Iowa]] Secretary of War.{{sfnm|White|2016|1pp=507, 564|Simon|2002|2pp=246\u2013247}} Grant appointed Philadelphia merchant [[Adolph E. Borie]] Secretary of Navy who soon resigned due to the stress of running the department. Grant appointed relatively unknown [[George M. Robeson]] of New Jersey to replace Borie.{{sfnm|Chernow|2017|1p=628|Simon|2002|2pp=246\u2013247}} Grant made three respected appointments: former Ohio Governor [[Jacob D.

The Tenure of Office Act was passed by Congress in 1867, sponsored by Radical Republicans, to curb the power of President [[Andrew Johnson]] in making government office appointments. The controversial law had been invoked during the impeachment trial of Johnson in 1868. To bolster the repeal effort, Grant declined to make any new appointments except for vacancies, until the law was overturned. On March 9, 1869, the House repealed the law outright, but the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected the bill and only offered Grant a temporary suspension of the law. When Grant objected, the Senate Republican caucus met, and proposed allowing the President to have a free hand in choosing and removing his own cabinet. The Senate Judiciary Committee wrote the new bill. A muddled compromise was reached by the House and Senate. Grant signed the bill into law on April 5, having gotten virtually everything he wanted.{{sfnm|Kahan|2018|1pp=50-51|Calhoun|2017|2pp=75-77}}\n\n===Reconstruction===\n{{further|Reconstruction era of the United States}}\n\nThe [[American Civil War|Civil War]] brought on a Northern policy of Reconstruction on the former Confederate States that included an absolute \"economic, political, and economic transformation of the South.\"{{sfn|Kahan|2018|pp=60-61}} The primary goals were the reunification of the nation and the integration of African Americans, given citizenship, into American \"political, economic, and social life.\"{{sfn|Kahan|2018|pp=60-61}} Grant was considered an \"engaged and effective executive\" concerning civil rights for African Americans.{{sfn|Kahan|2018|pp=60-61}} Grant hosted Louisiana's [[Oscar J.

Grant appointed [[Amos T. Akerman]] as Attorney General and [[Benjamin H. Bristow]] as America's first Solicitor General. Both Akerman and Bristow used the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute [[Ku Klux Klan]] members in the early 1870s. Grant appointed [[Hiram C. Whitley]] as director of the new Secret Service Agency in 1869, after he had successfully arrested 12 Klansmen in Georgia who would murdered a leading local Republican official. Whitley used talented detectives who infiltrated and broke up KKK units in North Carolina and Alabama. However they could not penetrate the main hotbed of KKK activity in upstate South Carolina. Grant sent in Army troops but Whitley's agents learned they were lying below until the troops were withdrawn. Whitley warned Akerman, who convinced Grant to declare martial law and send in US marshals backed by federal troops to arrest 500 Klansmen; hundred more fled the state, and hundreds of others surrendered in return for leniency.<ref>Charles Lane, ''Freedom's Detective: The Secret Service, the Ku Klux Klan and the Man Who Masterminded America's First War on Terror'' (2019) pp 181-84.</ref><ref>Jerry West, ''The Reconstruction Ku Klux Klan in York County, South Carolina, 1865-1877'' (2002).</ref>\n\nIn the first few years of Grant's first term in office, there were 1000 indictments against Klan members with over 550 convictions from the Department of Justice. By 1871, there were 3000 indictments and 600 convictions with most only serving brief sentences while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in [[Albany, New York]]. The result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the South. Akerman gave credit to Grant and told a friend that no one was \"better\" or \"stronger\" than Grant when it came to prosecuting terrorists.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=542\u201347}} Akerman's successor, [[George Henry Williams|George H.

This revised an earlier law, the [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] that only allowed white persons of good moral character to become U.S. citizens. The law also prosecuted persons who used fictitious names, misrepresentations, or identities of deceased individuals when applying for citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|first=Eillen|last=Bolger|year=2003|title=Background History of the United States Naturalization Process|url=https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/federal/naturalization-process-in-u-s-early-history/}}</ref>\n\n====Force Acts of 1870 and 1871====\n{{Further|Enforcement Act of 1870|Force Act of 1871|Ku Klux Klan}}\n\nTo add enforcement to the 15th Amendment, Congress passed an act that guaranteed the protection of voting rights of African Americans; Grant signed the bill, known as the [[Force Act of 1870]] into law on May 31, 1870. This law was designed to keep the [[Redeemers]] from attacking or threatening African Americans. This act placed severe penalties on persons who used intimidation, bribery, or physical assault to prevent citizens from voting and placed elections under Federal jurisdiction.{{sfn|Scaturro|2006}}\n\nOn January 13, 1871, Grant submitted to Congress a report on violent acts committed by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the South. On March 20, Grant told a reluctant Congress the situation in the South was dire and federal legislation was needed that would \"secure life, liberty, and property, and the enforcement of law, in all parts of the United States.\"{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=346}} Grant stated that the U.S. mail and the collection of revenue was in jeopardy.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=346}} Congress investigated the Klan's activities and eventually passed the [[Force Act of 1871]] to allow prosecution of the Klan. This Act, also known as the \"Ku Klux Klan Act\" and written by Representative [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]], was passed by Congress to specifically go after local units of the Ku Klux Klan. Although sensitive to charges of establishing a military dictatorship, Grant signed the bill into law on April 20, 1871, after being convinced by Secretary of Treasury, [[George Boutwell]], that federal protection was warranted, having cited documented atrocities against the [[Freedmen]].{{sfn|Grant|1990|pp=1146, 1147}}{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=368\u201369}} This law allowed the president to suspend [[habeas corpus]] on \"armed combinations\" and conspiracies by the Klan. The Act also empowered the president \"to arrest and break up disguised night [[wikt:marauder|marauders]]\". The actions of the Klan were defined as high crimes and acts of rebellion against the United States.{{sfn|Trelease|1995|loc=ch. 22\u201325}}{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=368\u2013369}}\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan consisted of local secret organizations formed to violently oppose Republican rule during Reconstruction; there was no organization above the local level. Wearing white hoods to hide their identity the Klan would attack and threaten Republicans. The Klan was strong in South Carolina between 1868 and 1870; South Carolina Governor [[Robert Kingston Scott|Robert K. Scott]], who was mired in corruption charges, allowed the Klan to rise to power.<ref>National Governors Association.{{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}</ref> Grant, who was fed up with their violent tactics, ordered the Ku Klux Klan to disperse from South Carolina and lay down their arms under the authority of the Enforcement Acts on October 12, 1871. There was no response, and so on October 17, 1871, Grant issued a suspension of habeas corpus in all the 9 counties in South Carolina. Grant ordered federal troops in the state who then captured the Klan; who were vigorously prosecuted by Att. Gen. [[Amos T. Akerman|Akerman]] and Sol. Gen. [[Benjamin Bristow|Bristow]]. With the Klan destroyed other white supremacist groups would emerge, including the [[White League]] and the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]].{{sfn|Scaturro|2006}}\n\n====Amnesty Act of 1872====\n{{Main|Amnesty Act of 1872}}\n\n[[Texas]] was readmitted into the Union on March 30, 1870, [[Mississippi]] was readmitted February 23, 1870, and [[Virginia]] on January 26, 1870. [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] became the last Confederate state to be readmitted into the Union on July 15, 1870. All members of the House of Representatives and Senate were seated from the 10 Confederate states who seceded.

The Senate confirmed Parker by a vote of 36 to 12.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=265-266}} During Parker's tenure Native wars dropped from 101 in 1869 to 58 in 1870.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=362}}\n\nEarly on Grant met with tribal chiefs of the Choctaw, Creek, Cherokee, and Chickasaw nations who expressed interest to teach \"wild\" Natives outside their own settled districts farming skills.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=267}} Grant told the Native chiefs that American settlement would lead to inevitable conflict, but that the \"march to civilization\" would lead to pacification. On April 10, 1869, Congress created the [[Board of Indian Commissioners]]. Grant appointed volunteer members who were \"eminent for their intelligence and philanthropy.\" The Grant Board was given extensive joint-power with Grant, Secretary of Interior Cox, and the Interior Department to supervise the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and \"civilize\" Native Americans. No Natives were appointed to the committee, only [[European Americans]]. The commission monitored purchases and began to inspect Native agencies. It attributed much of the trouble in Native country to the encroachment of whites. The board approved of the destruction of Native culture.

On July 15, 1870, Grant signed Congressional legislation that barred military officers from holding either elected or appointed office or suffer dismissal from the Army.

Red Cloud, at a previous meeting with Secretary Cox and Commissioner Parker, complained that promised rations and arms for hunting had not been delivered. Afterward, Grant and Cox lobbied Congress for the promised supplies and rations. Congress responded and on July 15, 1870, Grant signed the Indian Appropriations Act into law that appropriated the tribal monies. Two days after Spotted Tail urged the Grant administration to keep white settlers from invading Native reservation land, Grant ordered all Generals in the West to \"keep intruders off by military force if necessary\".{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=270-272}} In 1871, Grant signed another Indians Appropriations Act that ended the governmental policy of treating tribes as independent sovereign nations.

In 1872, the implementation of the policy involved the allotting of Indian reservations to religious organizations as exclusive religious domains. Of the 73 agencies assigned, the [[Methodists]] received fourteen; the Orthodox [[Quakers|Friends]] ten; the [[Presbyterians]] nine; the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] eight; the [[Roman Catholics]] seven; the Hicksite [[Quakers|Friends]] six; the [[Baptists]] five; the [[Dutch Reformed]] five; the [[Congregationalists]] three; [[Christians]] two; [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] two; [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] one; and [[Lutherans]] one.

Walker.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=273}}\n\n===Financial affairs===\nOn taking office Grant's first move was signing the Act to Strengthen the Public Credit, which the Republican Congress had just passed. It ensured that all public debts, particularly war bonds, would be paid only in gold rather than in greenbacks. The price of gold on the New York exchange fell to $130 per ounce \u2013 the lowest point since the suspension of specie payment in 1862.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=480\u201381}}\n\nOn May 19, 1869, Grant protected the wages of those working for the U.S. Government. In 1868, a law was passed that reduced the government working day to 8 hours; however, much of the law was later repealed that allowed day wages to also be reduced. To protect workers Grant signed an executive order that \"no reduction shall be made in the wages\" regardless of the reduction in hours for the government day workers.<ref>Grant (1869), ''Respecting Wages of labor'', Executive Order</ref>\n\nTreasury Secretary [[George S. Boutwell]] reorganized and reformed the [[United States Treasury]] by discharging unnecessary employees, started sweeping changes in [[Bureau of Printing and Engraving]] to protect the currency from [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiters]], and revitalized tax collections to hasten the collection of revenue. These changes soon led the Treasury to have a monthly surplus.{{sfn|Smith|2001}} By May 1869, Boutwell reduced the national debt by $12&nbsp;million. By September the national debt was reduced by $50&nbsp;million, which was achieved by selling the growing gold surplus at weekly auctions for [[United States Note|greenbacks]] and buying back wartime bonds with the currency. The ''[[New York Tribune]]'' wanted the government to buy more bonds and greenbacks and the ''[[New York Times]]'' praised the Grant administration's debt policy.{{sfn|Smith|2001}}\n\nThe first two years of the Grant administration with George Boutwell at the Treasury helm expenditures had been reduced to $292&nbsp;million in 1871 \u2013 down from $322&nbsp;million in 1869. The cost of collecting taxes fell to 3.11% in 1871. Grant reduced the number of employees working in the government by 2,248 persons from 6,052 on March 1, 1869, to 3,804 on December 1, 1871. He had increased tax revenues by $108&nbsp;million from 1869 to 1872. During his first administration the national debt fell from $2.5&nbsp;billion to $2.2&nbsp;billion.<ref>''The New York Times'' 1872, \"The Conduct of the Finances\".</ref>\n\nIn a rare case of preemptive reform during the Grant Administration, Brevet Major General [[Alfred Pleasonton]] was dismissed for being unqualified to hold the position of [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue]]. In 1870, Pleasonton, a Grant appointment, approved an unauthorized $60,000 tax refund and was associated with an alleged unscrupulous Connecticut firm. Treasury Secretary [[George Boutwell]] promptly stopped the refund and personally informed Grant that Pleasonton was incompetent to hold office. Refusing to resign on Boutwell's request, Pleasonton protested openly before Congress. Grant removed Pleasonton before any potential scandal broke out.<ref>Boutwell 2008, pp. 131\u2013133.</ref>\n\n===Foreign affairs===\n{{Further|History of U.S. foreign policy, 1861\u20131897}}\n\nGrant was a man of peace, and almost wholly devoted to domestic affairs. There were no foreign-policy disasters, and no wars to engage in. Besides Grant himself, the main players in foreign affairs were Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee [[Charles Sumner]]. They had to cooperate to get a treaty ratified. When Sumner stopped Grant's plan to annex Santo Domingo, Grant had his vengeance by systematically destroying Sumner's power and ending his career. Historians have a high regard for the diplomatic professionalism, independence, and good judgment of Hamilton Fish. The main issues involved Britain, Canada, Santo Domingo, Cuba and Spain.  Worldwide, it was peaceful era, with no major wars directly affecting the United States. In Europe, [[Otto von Bismarck]] was leading Prussia into a dominant position in the new united German Empire. After short, decisive wars with Denmark, Austria and France ended in 1871, Bismarck was the dominant figure in Europe, and worked tirelessly and successfully to promote a peaceful continent until his removal in 1890.<ref>The main scholarly history remains [[Allan Nevins]], ''Hamilton Fish: The inner history of the Grant administration'' (two volumes 1937) 932 PP, winner of the Pulitzer Prize. the most recent scholarly survey is Charles W Calhoun, ''The Presidency of Ulysses S.

Previously in 1868, President [[Andrew Johnson]] had proposed annexation but Congress refused.  In July 1869 Grant sent [[Orville E. Babcock]] and [[Rufus Ingalls]] who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic president [[Buenaventura B\u00e1ez]] for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of [[Saman\u00e1 Bay]] for $2&nbsp;million. To keep the island nation and B\u00e1ez secure in power, Grant ordered naval ships to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection. B\u00e1ez signed an annexation treaty on November 19, 1869. Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $1.5&nbsp;million to the Dominican national debt, the annexation of [[Santo Domingo]] as an American state, the United States' acquisition of the rights for [[Saman\u00e1 Bay]] for 50 years with an annual $150,000 rental, and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention. On January 10, 1870, the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification. Despite his support of the annexation, Grant made the mistakes of not building support in Congress or the country at large. {{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=499\u2013502}}{{sfn|Grant|1990|pp=1145\u201347}}<ref>Harold T.

By providing a safe haven for the freedmen, he believed that the exodus of black labor would force Southern whites to realize the necessity of such a significant workforce and accept their civil rights. Grant believed the island country would increase exports and lower the trade deficit. He hoped that U.S. ownership of the island would push Spain to abolish slavery in Cuba and  Puerto Rico, and perhaps Brazil as well. {{sfn|Grant|1990|pp=1145\u201347}} On March 15, 1870, the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations Committee]], headed by Sen.

The Grant administration turned a blind eye to this violation of American neutrality.<ref>Charles Campbell,  ''The Transformation of American Foreign Relations'' (1976) pp 53=59.</ref>  In 1869, Grant was urged by popular opinion to support rebels in Cuba with military assistance and to give them U.S. diplomatic recognition. Fish, however, wanted stability and favored the Spanish government, without publicly challenging the popular anti-Spanish American viewpoint.  They reassured European governments that the U.S. did not want to annex Cuba. Grant and Fish gave lip service to Cuban independence, called for an end to slavery in Cuba, and quietly opposed American military intervention. Fish, worked diligently against popular pressure, and was able to keep Grant from officially recognizing Cuban independence because it would have endangered negotiations with Britain over the [[Alabama Claims]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Corning 1918, pp. 49\u201354.</ref> Minister to Spain [[Daniel Sickles]] failed to get Spain to agree to American mediation.

Grant's able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish had orchestrated many of the events leading up to the treaty. Previously, Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] during the Johnson administration first proposed an initial treaty concerning damages done to American merchants by three Confederate warships, [[CSS Florida|CSS ''Florida'']], [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], and [[CSS Shenandoah|CSS ''Shenandoah'']] built in Britain. These damages were collectively known as the [[Alabama Claims]]. These ships had inflicted tremendous damage to U.S. shipping, as insurance rates soared and shippers switched to British ships. Washington wanted the British to pay heavy damages, perhaps including turning over Canada.<ref>Hackett 1911, pp. 45\u201350.</ref>\n[[File:CSSAlabama.jpg|150px|thumb|Confederate Warship [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']]<br />Active service (1862\u20131864)]]\nIn April 1869, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly rejected a proposed treaty which paid too little and contained no admission of British guilt for prolonging the war. Senator [[Charles Sumner]] spoke up before Congress; publicly denounced [[Queen Victoria]]; demanded a huge reparation; and opened the possibility of Canada ceded to the United States as payment. The speech angered the British government, and talks had to be put off until matters cooled down. Negotiations for a new treaty began in January 1871 when Britain sent [[Sir John Rose, 1st Baronet|Sir John Rose]] to America to meet with Fish. A joint high commission was created on February 9, 1871, in Washington, consisting of representatives from both Britain and the United States. The commission created a treaty where an international Tribunal would settle the damage amounts; the British admitted regret, not fault, over the destructive actions of the Confederate war cruisers. Grant approved and signed the treaty on May 8, 1871; the Senate ratified the Treaty of Washington on May 24, 1871.<ref name=\"Corning 1918 59\u201384\">Corning 1918, [https://archive.org/details/hamiltonfish00corngoog <!-- quote=Hamilton Fish. --> pp. 59\u201384]</ref>{{sfn|Grant|1990|p=1146}}\nThe Tribunal met on neutral territory in Geneva, Switzerland.

Korea was a small independent country that excluded all foreign trade.  Washington sought a treaty dealing with shipwrecked sailors after the crew of a stranded American commercial ship was executed. The long-term goal for the Grant Administration was to open Korea to Western markets in the same way Commodore [[Matthew Calbraith Perry|Matthew Perry]] had opened [[Bakumatsu|Japan]] in 1854 by a Naval display of military force. On May 30, 1871, Rear Admiral [[John Rodgers (American Civil War naval officer)|John Rodgers]] with a fleet of five ships, part of the [[Asiatic Squadron]], arrived at the mouth of the Salee River below [[Seoul]]. The fleet included the {{USS|Colorado|1856|2}}, one of the largest ships in the Navy with 47 guns, 47 officers, and a 571-man crew. While waiting for senior Korean officials to negotiate, Rogers sent ships out to make soundings of the Salee River for navigational purposes.<ref name=\"Miller\">Miller 2003, pp. 146\u2013147.</ref><ref>Chang 2003.</ref>\n\nThe American fleet was fired upon by a Korean fort, but there was little damage. Rogers gave the Korean government ten days to apologize or begin talks, but the Royal Court kept silent. After ten days passed, on June 10, Rogers began a series of [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] assaults that destroyed 5 Korean forts. These military engagements were known as the [[Battle of Ganghwa]]. Several hundred Korean soldiers and three Americans were killed. Korea still refused to negotiate, and the American fleet sailed away. The Koreans refer to this 1871 U.S. military action as [[Shinmiyangyo]]. Grant defended Rogers in his third annual message to Congress in December 1871.

In 1870, the somewhat more official [[Washburn\u2013Langford\u2013Doane Expedition]] explored the same regions of the upper Yellowstone and geyser basins, naming [[Old Faithful]] and many other park features.

In March 1871 Grant signed into law Congressional legislation appropriating $40,000 to finance the [[Hayden Geological Survey of 1871]]. Hayden was given instructions by Grant's Secretary of Interior, [[Columbus Delano]]. The expedition party was composed of 36 civilians, mostly scientists, and two military escorts. Among the survey party were an artist [[Thomas Moran]] and photographer [[William Henry Jackson]].\n\nHayden's published reports, magazine articles, along with paintings by Moran and photographs by Jackson convinced Congress to preserve the natural wonders of the upper Yellowstone.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Merrill, Marlene Deahl |title=Yellowstone and the Great West-Journals, Letters and Images from the 1871 Hayden Expedition |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, NE |year=1999 |isbn=0-8032-3148-2 |pages=}}</ref> On December 18, 1871, a bill was introduced simultaneously in the Senate, by Senator [[S.C.

Hayden's influence on Congress is readily apparent when examining the detailed information contained in the report of the House Committee on Public Lands: \"The bill now before Congress has for its objective the withdrawal from settlement, occupancy, or sale, under the laws of the United States a tract of land fifty-five by sixty-five miles, about the sources of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers, and dedicates and sets apart as a great national park or pleasure-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.\"\nWhen the bill was presented to Congress, the bill's chief supporters, ably prepared by Langford, Hayden and Jay Cooke, convinced their colleagues that the region's real value was as a park area, to be preserved in its natural state. The bill was approved by a comfortable margin in the Senate on January 30, 1872, and by the House on February 27.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haines |first=Aubrey L. |title=The Yellowstone Story-A History of Our First National Park Volume I. |publisher=Yellowstone Library and Museum Association |location=Yellowstone National Park, WY |year=1977 |isbn=0870813900 |chapter=Beyond the Ranges |pages=84\u2013155}}</ref>\n\nOn March 1, 1872, Grant played his role, in signing the \"Act of Dedication\" into law. It established the Yellowstone region as the nation's first national park, made possible by three years of exploration by Cook-Folsom-Peterson (1869), Washburn-Langford-Doane (1870), and Hayden (1871). The 1872 Yellowstone Act prohibited fish and game, including buffalo, from \"wanton destruction\" within the confines of the park. However, Congress did not appropriate funds or legislation for the enforcement against poaching; as a result, Secretary Delano could not hire people to aid tourists or protect Yellowstone from encroachment.<ref name=\"The Last Buffalo\">Kennedy (2001), \"[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/harp/0606.html The Last Buffalo]\"</ref><ref name=POUSG_1874>Simon (2003) ''Papers of Ulysses S.

The demand was for boots for European armies, or machine belts attached to steam engines. Acres of land were dedicated solely for drying the hides of the slaughtered buffalo. Native Americans protested at the \"wanton destruction\" of their food supply. Between 1872 in 1874, the buffalo herd south of the Platte River yielded 4.4 million kills by white hunters, and about 1 million animals killed by Indians.<ref>Richard White, ''The Republic for which it Stands'' (2017) p 296.</ref>  Popular concern for the destruction of the buffalo mounted, and a bill in Congress was passed, HR 921, that would have made buffalo hunting illegally for whites. Taking advice from Secretary Delano, Grant chose to pocket-veto the bill, believing that the demise of the buffalo would reduce Indian wars and force tribes to stay on their respected reservations and to adopt an agricultural lifestyle rather than roaming the plains and hunting buffalo.<ref name=\"The Last Buffalo\"/> Ranchers wanted the buffalo gone to open pasture land for their cattle herds. With the buffalo food supply lowered, Native Americans were forced to stay on reservations.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=536\u201338}}\n\n===Corruption and reform===\n{{main|Ulysses S.

The plan was to keep the Government from selling gold, thus driving its price. Grant and Secretary of Treasury [[George S. Boutwell]] found out about the gold market speculation and ordered the sale of $4&nbsp;million in gold on (Black) Friday, September 23. Gould and Fisk were thwarted, and the price of gold dropped. The effects of releasing gold by Boutwell were disastrous. Stock prices plunged and food prices dropped, devastating farmers for years.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=481\u201390}}\n\n====Civil service commission and reform====\nThe reform of the spoils system of political patronage entered the national agenda under the Grant presidency, that would take on the fervor of a religious revival.{{sfn|White|2017|p=531}} The distribution of federal jobs by Congressional legislators was considered vital for their reelection to Congress.{{sfn|Schmiel|2014|p=205}} Grant required that all applicants to federal jobs apply directly to the Department heads, rather than the president.{{sfn|Schmiel|2014|p=205}} Two of Grant's appointments, Secretary of Interior [[Jacob D.

Historian John Simon says his efforts at civil service reform were honest, but that they were met with criticism from all sides and were a failure.<ref>John Y. Simon, \"Ulysses S. Grant and Civil Service Reform,\" ''Hayes Historical Journal'' (1984) 4#3 pp 8\u201315.</ref>\n\nGrant was the first president to recommend a professional civil service. He pushed the initial legislation through Congress, and appointed the members for the first [[United States Civil Service Commission]]. The temporary Commission recommended administering competitive exams and issuing regulations on the hiring and promotion of government employees. Grant ordered their recommendations in effect in 1872; having lasted for two years until December 1874. At the New York Custom House, a port that took in hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue, applicants for an entry position now had to pass a written civil service examination. [[Chester A. Arthur]] who was appointed by Grant as New York Custom Collector stated that the examinations excluded and deterred unfit persons from getting employment positions.<ref>Howe (1935), p. 48, 295</ref> However, Congress, in no mood to reform itself, denied any long-term reform by refusing to enact the necessary legislation to make the changes permanent. Historians have traditionally been divided whether ''patronage'', meaning appointments made without a merit system, should be labeled corruption.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=587\u201389}}\n\nThe movement for Civil Service reform reflected two distinct objectives: to eliminate the corruption and inefficiencies in a non-professional bureaucracy and to check the power of President Johnson. Although many reformers after the Election of 1868 looked to Grant to ram Civil Service legislation through Congress, he refused, saying: \n{{Quote|Civil Service Reform rests entirely with Congress.

These were known as [[Star routes|Star Routes]] because an asterisk was given on official [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office]] documents. These remote routes were hundreds of miles long and went to the most rural parts of the United States by horse and buggy. In obtaining these highly prized postal contracts, an intricate ring of bribery and straw bidding was set up in the Postal Contract office; the ring consisted of contractors, postal clerks, and various intermediary brokers. Straw bidding was at its highest practice while [[John Creswell]], Grant's 1869 appointment, was [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster-General]]. An 1872 federal investigation into the matter exonerated Creswell, but he was [[Censure in the United States|censured]] by the minority House report. A $40,000 bribe to the [[42nd United States Congress|42nd Congress]] by one postal contractor had tainted the results of the investigation.

Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for the previous two years of service. This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill.

When Republicans gathered for their [[1872 Republican National Convention|1872 national convention]] he was unanimously nominated for a second term. [[Henry Wilson]] was selected as his running mate over scandal-tainted Vice President Schuyler Colfax. The party platform advocated high tariffs and a continuation of Radical Reconstruction policies that supported five military districts in the Southern states.\n\nDuring Grant's first term a significant number of Republicans had become completely disillusioned with the party. Weary of the scandals and opposed to several of Grant's policies, split from the party to form the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]]. At the party's only national convention, held in May 1872 ''[[New York Tribune]]'' editor Horace Greeley was nominated for president, and [[Benjamin Gratz Brown]] was nominated for vice president. They advocated civil service reform, a low tariff, and granting amnesty to former Confederate soldiers. They also wanted to end reconstruction and restore local self-government in the South.\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1872.svg|thumb|left|Electoral Vote Results 1872]]\n\nThe Democrats, who at this time had no strong candidate choice of their own, saw an opportunity to consolidate the anti-Grant vote and jumped on the Greeley bandwagon, reluctantly adopting Greeley and Brown as their nominees.<ref name=\"Rhodes7\">Rhodes 1906, [https://archive.org/details/historyunitedst05rhodgoog <!-- quote=intitle:History intitle:of intitle:the intitle:United intitle:States inauthor:Rhodes inauthor:James. --> v. 7].</ref> It is the only time in American history when a major party endorsed the candidate of a third party.\n\nWhile Grant, like incumbent presidents before him, did not campaign, an efficient party organization composed of thousands of patronage appointees, did so on his behalf.

His campaign was plagued by misstatements and embarrassing moments.\n\nHowever, because of political infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats, and due to several campaign blunders, the physically ailing Greeley was no match for Grant, who won in a landslide. Grant won 286 of the 352 Electoral College votes and received 55.8 percent of the popular vote nationwide. The President's reelection victory also brought an overwhelming Republican majority into both houses of Congress. Heartbroken after a hard-fought political campaign, Greeley died a few weeks after the election.

Subsequently, the inaugural ball ended early when the food froze. Wilson died 2 years, 263 days into this term, and the office remained vacant for the balance of it. Departing from the White House, a parade escorted Grant down the newly paved Pennsylvania Avenue, which was all decorated with banners and flags, on to the swearing-in ceremony in front of the Capitol building. Chief Justice [[Salmon P. Chase]] administered the presidential oath of office. This was one of the coldest inaugurations in U.S. history, with the temperature at only 6 degrees at sunrise. After the swearing-in ceremony the inaugural parade commenced down Pennsylvania. The [[The Washington Star|''Evening Star'']] observed. \"The private stands and windows along the entire route were crowded to excess.\" The parade consisted of a variety of military units along with marching bands, and civic organizations. The military units, in their fancy regalia, were the most noticeable. Altogether there were approximately 12,000 marchers who participated, including several units of African-American soldiers. At the inaugural ball there were some 6,000 people in attendance. Great care was taken to ensure that Grant's inaugural ball would be in spacious quarters and would feature an elegant assortment of appetizers, food, and champagne. A large temporary wooden building was constructed at Judiciary Square to accommodate the event. Grant arrived around 11:30pm and the dancing began.<ref>[[#white|White, 2016]], pp. 471\u2013473</ref>{{sfn|Streets of Washington|2017}}<ref>[[#ames|Ames, 1879]], pp. 272, 276</ref>\n\n===Reconstruction===\n{{further|Reconstruction era of the United States}}\nGrant was vigorous in his enforcement of the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina.{{sfn|Trelease|1995|loc=ch. 24\u201325}} He proactively used military and [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] enforcement of civil rights laws and the protection of African Americans more than any other 19th-century president.

Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant's reelection.<ref>David Herbert Donald, ''Charles Sumner and the Rights of Man'' (1970) ch 12</ref>\n\nConservative resistance to Republican state governments grew after the 1872 elections. With the destruction of the Klan in 1872, new secret paramilitary organizations arose in the Deep South. In Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Louisiana, the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] and [[White League]] operated openly and were better organized than the Ku Klux Klan. Their goals were to oust the Republicans, return Conservative whites to power, and use whatever illegal methods needed to achieve them.

Two months later each candidate was sworn in as governor on January 13, 1873. A federal judge ruled that Kellogg was the rightful winner of the election and ordered him and the Republican-based majority to be seated. The White League supported McEnry and prepared to use military force to remove Kellogg from office. Grant ordered troops to enforce the court order and protect Kellogg. On March 4, Federal troops under a flag of truce and Kellogg's state militia defeated McEnry's fusionist party's insurrection.<ref>Keith 2007, p. 100.</ref>\n\n[[File:The Union as It Was.jpg|thumb|150px|Louisiana White League units in 1874 to terrorized black Republicans]]\nA dispute arose over who would be installed as judge and sheriff at the [[Colfax, Louisiana|Colfax]] courthouse in [[Grant Parish, Louisiana|Grant Parish]]. Kellogg's two appointees had seized control of the Court House on March 25 with aid and protection of black state militia troops. Then on April 13, White League forces attacked the courthouse and massacred 50 black militiamen who had been captured. A total of 105 blacks were killed trying to defend the Colfax courthouse for Governor Kellogg. On April 21, Grant sent in the U.S. [[19th Infantry Regiment (United States)|19th Infantry Regiment]] to restore order. On May 22, Grant issued a new proclamation to restore order in Louisiana. On May 31, McEnry finally told his followers to obey \"peremptory orders\" of the President. The orders brought a brief peace to New Orleans and most of Louisiana, except, ironically, [[Grant Parish]].<ref>Lane 2008, p. 124.</ref>\n\n====Brooks-Baxter war in Arkansas====\n{{main|Brooks\u2013Baxter War}}\nIn the fall of 1872, the Republican party split in Arkansas and ran two candidates for governor, [[Elisha Baxter]] and [[Joseph Brooks (politician)|Joseph Brooks]]. Massive fraud characterized the election, but Baxter was declared the winner and took office. Brooks never gave up; finally, in 1874, a local judge ruled Brooks was entitled to the office and swore him in. Both sides mobilized militia units, and rioting and fighting bloodied the streets. Speculation swirled as to who President Grant would side with \u2013 either Baxter or Brooks. Grant delayed, requesting a joint session of the Arkansas government to figure out peacefully who would be the Governor, but Baxter refused to participate. On May 15, 1874, Grant issued a Proclamation that Baxter was the legitimate Governor of Arkansas, and hostilities ceased.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">Johnson (1908), pp. 122\u2013168.</ref><ref>Woodward 1971, pp. 315\u2013336.</ref> In the fall of 1874 the people of Arkansas voted out Baxter, and Republicans and the [[Redeemers]] came to power.\n\nA few months later in early 1875, Grant announced that Brooks had been legitimately elected back in 1872. Grant did not send in troops, and Brooks never regained office. Instead, Grant appointed him to the high-paying patronage job of US postmaster in Little Rock.  Grant's legalistic approach Did resolve the conflict peacefully, but it left the Republican Party in Arkansas in total disarray, and further discredited grants reputation.<ref>Charles W.

They promised to lower city spending and taxes. Despite such intentions, the reform movement turned racist when the new White city officials went after the county government, which had a majority of African Americans. The White League threatened the life of and expelled Crosby, the black [[Warren County, Mississippi|Warren County]] Sheriff and tax collector. Crosby sought help from Republican Governor [[Adelbert Ames]] to regain his position as sheriff. Governor Ames told him to take other African Americans and use force to retain his lawful position. At that time Vicksburg had a population of 12,443, more than half of whom were African American.<ref name=\"Rhodes7\u20131\">Rhodes (1906), v. 7, pp. 167\u2013168.</ref>\n\nOn December 7, 1874, Crosby and an African-American militia approached Vicksburg. He had said that the Whites were, \"ruffians, barbarians, and political [[banditti]]\".<ref name=\"Rhodes7\u20131\" /> A series of confrontations occurred against white paramilitary forces that resulted in the deaths of 29 African Americans and 2 Whites. The White militia retained control of the County Court House and jail.\n\nOn December 21, Grant issued a Presidential Proclamation for the people in Vicksburg to stop fighting. General [[Philip Sheridan]], based in Louisiana for this regional territory, dispatched federal troops, who reinstated Crosby as sheriff and restored the peace. When questioned about the matter, Governor Ames denied that he had told Crosby to use African-American militia. On June 7, 1875, Crosby was shot to death by a white deputy while drinking in a bar. The origins of the shooting remained a mystery.<ref name=\"Rhodes7\u20131\" />\n[[File:JamesLongstreet.jpg|thumb|150px|Former Confederate General [[James Longstreet|James A.

Kellogg]] was forced to flee. Former Confederate General [[James Longstreet|James A. Longstreet]], with 3,000 [[African American]] militia and 400 Metropolitan police, made a counterattack on the 8,000 White League troops. Consisting of former Confederate soldiers, the experienced White League troops routed Longstreet's army. On September 17, Grant sent in Federal troops, and they restored the government back to Kellogg. During the following controversial election in November, passions rose high, and violence mixed with fraud were rampant; the state of affairs in New Orleans was becoming out of control. The results were that 53 Republicans and 53 Democrats were elected with 5 remaining seats to be decided by the legislature.<ref name=\"Hutton 2009 262\u2013266\">Hutton 2009, pp. 262\u2013266.</ref><ref>Zuczek 2006, p. 413.</ref>\n\nGrant had been careful to watch the elections and secretly sent [[Phil Sheridan]] in to keep law and order in the state. Sheridan had arrived in New Orleans a few days before the January 4, 1875, legislature opening meeting. At the convention the Democrats again with military force took control of the state building out of Republican hands. Initially, the Democrats were protected by federal troops under Colonel [[R\u00e9gis de Trobriand]], and the escaped Republicans were removed from the hallways of the state building. However, Governor Kellogg then requested that Trobriand reseat the Republicans. Trobriand returned to the Statehouse and used bayonets to force the Democrats out of the building. The Republicans then organized their own house with their own speakers all being protected by the Federal Army. Sheridan, who had annexed the Department of the Gulf to his command at 9:00 P.M., claimed that the federal troops were being neutral since they had also protected the Democrats earlier.<ref name=\"Hutton 2009 262\u2013266\"/>\n\n====South Carolina 1876====\n{{further|South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1876}}\n\n[[File:Wade Hampton III - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|150px|Former Confederate officer [[Wade Hampton III]] was supported by the terrorist group [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] in the 1876 Governor's election in South Carolina.]]\nDuring the election year of 1876, South Carolina was in a state of rebellion against Republican governor [[Daniel Henry Chamberlain|Daniel H. Chamberlain]]. Conservatives were determined to win the election for ex-Confederate [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] through violence and intimidation. The Republicans went on to nominate Chamberlain for a second term. Hampton supporters, donning red shirts, disrupted Republican meetings with gun shootings and yelling. Tensions became violent on July 8, 1876, when five African Americans were murdered at [[Hamburg, South Carolina|Hamburg]]. The rifle clubs, wearing their [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], were better armed than the blacks. South Carolina was ruled more by \"mobocracy and bloodshed\" than by Chamberlain's government.<ref name=\"Zuczek 1996 159\u2013165,170\u2013172,174,176\">Zuczek 1996, pp. 159\u2013165, 170\u2013172, 174, 176.</ref>\n\nBlack militia fought back in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] on September 6, 1876, in what was known as the \"King Street riot\". The white militia assumed defensive positions out of concern over possible intervention from federal troops. Then, on September 19, the Red Shirts took offensive action by openly killing between 30 and 50 African Americans outside [[Ellenton, South Carolina|Ellenton]]. During the massacre, state representative Simon Coker was killed. On October 7, Governor Chamberlain declared martial law and told all the \"rifle club\" members to put down their weapons. In the meantime, Wade Hampton never ceased to remind Chamberlain that he did not rule South Carolina. Out of desperation, Chamberlain wrote to Grant and asked for federal intervention. The \"Cainhoy riot\" took place on October 15 when Republicans held a rally at \"Brick Church\" outside [[Cainhoy]]. Blacks and whites both opened fire; six whites and one black were killed. Grant, upset over the Ellenton and Cainhoy riots, finally declared a Presidential Proclamation on October 17, 1876 and ordered all persons, within 3 days, to cease their lawless activities and disperse to their homes. A total of 1,144 federal infantrymen were sent into South Carolina, and the violence stopped; election day was quiet. Both Hampton and Chamberlain claimed victory, and for a while both acted as governor; Hampton took the office in 1877 after President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] withdrew federal troops and after Chamberlain left the state.<ref name=\"Zuczek 1996 159\u2013165,170\u2013172,174,176\"/>\n\n===Domestic affairs===\n\n====Religion and schools====\n{{Main|Blaine Amendment}}\n\nGrant believed strongly in the separation of church and state and championed complete [[secularization]] in public schools. In a September 1875 speech, Grant advocated \"security of [[free thought]], [[free speech]], and [[Freedom of the press|free press]], pure morals, unfettered religious sentiments, and of equal rights and privileges to all men, irrespective of nationality, color, or religion.\" In regard to public education, Grant endorsed that every child should receive \"the opportunity of a good common school education, unmixed with sectarian, pagan, or atheist tenets.

Blaine]] (1830-1893) proposed the amendment to the federal Constitution. Blaine, who actively sought Catholic votes when he ran for president in 1884, believed that possibility of hurtful agitation on the school question should be ended. In 1875, the proposed amendment passed by a vote of 180 to 7 in the House of Representatives, but failed by four votes to achieve the necessary two-thirds vote in the Senate. Nothing like it ever became federal legislation. However many states did adopt similar amendments to their state constitution.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steven Green |title=The Second Disestablishment: Church and State in Nineteenth-Century America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_KP0kQC4XIC&pg=PA296|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=296|isbn=9780199741595}}</ref>\n\nThe proposed Blaine Amendment text was:\n{{quote|No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; and no money raised by taxation in any State for the support of public schools, or derived from any public fund therefor, nor any public lands devoted thereto, shall ever be under the control of any religious sect; nor shall any money so raised or lands so devoted be divided between religious sects or denominations.}}\n\n====Civil Rights Act of 1875====\n{{Further|Civil Rights Act of 1875}}\nThroughout his presidency, Grant was continually concerned with the civil rights of all Americans, \"irrespective of nationality, color, or religion.\"<ref name=1875Reyes>{{cite book |last=Reyes |first=E.

Running for president in 1868 Grant publicly apologized for it.Once elected he set out to make amends.  He appointed several Jewish leaders to office, including [[Simon Wolf]] recorder of deeds in Washington D.C., and [[Edward S. Salomon]] Governor of the [[Washington Territory]].{{sfn|White|2016|pp=494\u2013495}}  Historian [[Jonathan Sarna]] argues:\n\n<blockquote>Eager to prove that he was above prejudice, Grant appointed more Jews to public office than had any of his predecessors and, in the name of human rights, he extended unprecedented support to persecuted Jews in Russia and Romania. Time and again, partly as a result of this enlarged vision of what it meant to be an American and partly in order to live down General Orders No. 11, Grant consciously worked to assist Jews and secure them equality.&nbsp;... Through his appointments and policies, Grant rejected calls for a 'Christian nation' and embraced Jews as insiders in America, part of 'we the people.' During his administration, Jews achieved heightened status on the national scene, anti-Jewish prejudice declined, and Jews looked forward optimistically to a liberal epoch characterized by sensitivity to human rights and interreligious cooperation.<ref>Sarna, ''When General Grant Expelled the Jews'' (2012), Introduction</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Native American affairs===\n{{main|Native American policy of the Ulysses S. Grant administration}}\nUnder Grant's ''Peace'' policy, wars between settlers, the federal army, and the American Indians had been decreasing from 101 per year in 1869 to a low of 15 per year in 1875.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=362}} However, the discovery of gold in the Black Hills of the [[Dakota Territory]] and the completion of the [[Northern Pacific Railway]], threatened to unravel Grant's Indian policy, as white settlers encroached upon native land to mine for gold.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=538}}\n\nIn his second term of presidential office, Grant's fragile ''Peace'' policy came apart. Major General [[Edward Canby]] was killed in the [[Modoc War]]. Indian wars per year jumped up to 32 in 1876 and remained at 43 in 1877.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=362}} One of the highest casualty Indian battles that took place in American history was at the [[Battle of Little Bighorn]] in 1876.{{sfn|Michno|2003|pp=295\u201396, 363}} Indian war casualties in Montana went from 5 in 1875, to 613 in 1876 and 436 in 1877.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=368}}\n\n====Modoc War====\n{{further|Modoc War}}\nIn January 1873, Grant's Native American peace policy was challenged. Two weeks after Grant was elected for a second term, fighting broke out between the [[Modocs]] and settlers near the California-Oregon border. The Modocs, led by [[Captain Jack (Native American)|Captain Jack]], killed 18 white settlers and then found a strong defensive position. Grant ordered General Sherman not to attack the Indians but settle matters peacefully with a commission. Sherman then sent Major General [[Edward Canby]], but Captain Jack killed him. Reverend Eleazar Thomas, a Methodist minister, was also killed. [[Alfred B. Meacham]], an Indian Agent, was severely wounded. The murders shocked the nation, and Sherman wired to have the Modocs exterminated. Grant overruled Sherman; Captain Jack was executed, and the remaining 155 Modocs were relocated to the [[Quapaw Agency]] in the [[Indian Territory]]. This episode and the [[Great Sioux War]] undermined public confidence in Grant's peace policy, according to historian [[Robert M. Utley]].<ref>Utley 1984b, p. 206.</ref>{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=534\u201336}} During the peace negotiations between Brig. Gen. [[Edward Canby]] and the Modoc tribal leaders, there were more Indians in the tent then had been agreed upon. As the Indians grew more hostile, Captain Jack, said \"I talk no more.\" and shouted \"All ready.\" Captain Jack drew his revolver and fired directly into the head of Gen Canby. Brig. Gen Canby was the highest-ranking officer to be killed during the Indian Wars that took place from 1850 to 1890. Alfred Meacham, who survived the massacre, defended the Modocs who were put on trial.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=265}}\n\n====Red River War====\n{{main|Red River War}}\nIn 1874, war erupted on the southern Plains when [[Quanah Parker]], leader of the [[Comanche]], led 700 tribal warriors and attacked the buffalo hunter supply base on the Canadian River, at [[Adobe Walls, Texas]]. The Army under General [[Phil Sheridan]] launched a military campaign, and, with few casualties on either side, forced the Indians back to their reservations by destroying their horses and winter food supplies. Grant, who agreed to the Army plan advocated by Generals [[William T. Sherman]] and Phil Sheridan, imprisoned 74 insurgents in Florida.<ref>Smith (2001), ''Grant'', pp. 536\u2013538;</ref>\n\n====Great Sioux War====\n{{main|Great Sioux War|Battle of Little Big Horn}}\nIn 1874 gold had been discovered in the [[Black Hills]] in the [[Dakota Territory]]. White speculators and settlers rushed in droves seeking riches mining gold on land reserved for the [[Sioux]] tribe by the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] of 1868. In 1875, to avoid conflict Grant met with [[Red Cloud]], chief of the Sioux and offered $25,000 from the government to purchase the land. The offer was declined. On November 3, 1875 at a White House meeting, [[Phil Sheridan]] told the President that the Army was overstretched and could not defend the Sioux tribe from the settlers; Grant ordered Sheridan to round up the Sioux and put them on the reservation. Sheridan used a strategy of convergence, using Army columns to force the Sioux onto the reservation. On June 25, 1876, one of these columns, led by Colonel [[George A. Custer]] met the Sioux at the Battle of Little Big Horn and part of his command was slaughtered. Approximately 253 federal soldiers and civilians were killed compared to 40 Indians.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=296}} Custer's death and the Battle of Little Big Horn shocked the nation. Sheridan avenged Custer, pacified the northern Plains, and put the defeated Sioux on the reservation.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=538\u201340}} On August 15, 1876, President Grant signed a proviso giving the Sioux nation $1,000,000 in rations, while the Sioux relinquished all rights to the Black Hills, except for a 40-mile land tract west of the 103rd meridian. On August 28, a seven-man committee, appointed by Grant, gave additional harsh stipulations for the Sioux in order to receive government assistance. [[Halfbreeds]] and \"squaw men\" (A white man with an Indian wife) were banished from the Sioux reservation. To receive the government rations, the Indians had to work the land. Reluctantly, on September 20, the Indian leaders, whose people were starving, agreed to the committee's demands and signed the agreement.<ref>[[#Gray|Gray]] (1976), pp. 260\u2013263</ref>\n\nDuring the Great Sioux War, Grant came into conflict with Col. [[George Armstrong Custer]] after he testified in 1876 about corruption in the War Department under Secretary [[William W. Belknap]] (see below).{{sfn|Donovan|2008|pp=110\u2013111}} Grant had Custer arrested for breach of military protocol in Chicago and barred him from leading an upcoming campaign against the Sioux.{{sfn|Donovan|2008|p=112}} Grant finally relented and let Custer fight under Brig. Gen.

Financial debt, however, particularly in railroad investment, spread throughout both the private and federal sectors. {{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=419}} The market began to break in July 1873 when the Brookyn Trust Company went broke and closed. Secretary Richardson sold gold to pay for $14 million in federal bonds.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=420}} Two months later, the [[Panic of 1873]], collapsed the national economy. On September 17, the stock market crashed, followed by the New York Warehouse & Security Company, September 18, and the [[Jay Cooke & Company]], September 19, both going bankrupt. On September 19, Grant ordered Secretary [[William Adams Richardson|Richardson]], Boutwell's replacement, to purchase $10 million in bonds. Richardson complied using greenbacks to expand the money supply. On September 20, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (''NYSE'') closed for ten days. Traveling to New York, Grant met with Richardson to consult with bankers, who gave Grant conflicting financial advice.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=421}}\n\nReturning to Washington, Grant and Richardson sent millions of greenbacks from the treasury to New York to purchase bonds, stopping the purchases on September 24. By the beginning of January 1874, Richardson had issued a total of $26 million greenbacks from the Treasury reserve, into the economy, relieving Wall Street, but not stopping the national [[Long Depression]], that would last 5 years. Thousands of businesses, depressed daily wages by 25% for three years, and brought the unemployment rate up to 14%.{{sfnm|Smith|2001|1pp=575\u201382|Chernow|2017|2pp=419-420|McFeely|1981|3p=394}}{{sfn|Oberholzer|1922|loc=3:79\u2013122}}{{sfn|Unger|1964|loc=ch. 8}}{{sfn|Unger|1964|loc=ch. 9}}\n\n====Inflation bill vetoed and compromise====\n[[File:Grant Inflation Bill Veto.jpg|thumb|Political cartoon by Thomas Nast: Grant congratulated for vetoing the \"inflation bill\" on April 22, 1874]]\nGrant and Richardson's mildly inflationary response to the Panic of 1873, encouraged Congress to pursue a more aggressive policy. The legality of releasing greenbacks was presumed to have been illegal. On April 14, 1874, Congress passed the ''Inflation Bill'' that set the greenback maximum at $400,000 retroactively legalizing the $26 million reserve greenbacks earlier released by the Treasury. The bill released an additional $18 million in [[United States Note|greenbacks]] up to the original $400,000,000 amount. Going further, the bill authorized an additional $46 million in banknotes and raised their maximum to $400 million.  {{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=441}} Eastern bankers vigorously lobbied Grant to veto the bill because of their reliance on bonds and foreign investors who did business in gold. Most of Grant's cabinet favored the bill in order to secure a Republican election. Grant's conservative Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] threatened to resign if Grant signed the bill. On April 22, 1874, after evaluating his own reasons for wanting to sign the bill, Grant unexpectedly vetoed the bill against the popular election strategy of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] because he believed it would destroy the nation's credit.<ref>Rhodes 1906, ch. 7, pp. 126\u2013127; Nevins (1957), ''Hamilton Fish: The Inner History of the Grant Administration. Volume: 2'', pp. 706\u2013708 711\u2013714</ref>\n\nCongress passed a compromise bill, that Grant signed on June 20, 1874. The act legalized the $26 million released by Richardson, and set the maximum of greenbacks at $382 million. Up to $55 million in national banknotes would be redistributed from states with an excess to those states that had minimal amounts. The act did little to relieve the national economy. {{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=445-446}}\n\n====Resumption of Specie Act====\nOn January 14, 1875, Grant signed the Resumption of Specie Act, and he could not have been happier; he wrote a note to Congress congratulating members on the passage of the act. The legislation was drafted by Ohio Republican Senator [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]]. This act provided that paper money in circulation would be exchanged for gold specie and silver coins and would be effective January 1, 1879. The act also implemented that gradual steps would be taken to reduce the number of greenbacks in circulation. At that time there were \"paper coin\" currency worth less than $1.00, and these would be exchanged for silver coins. Its effect was to stabilize the currency and make the consumers money as \"good as gold\". In an age without a [[Federal Reserve]] system to control inflation, this act stabilized the economy. Grant considered it the hallmark of his administration.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=581\u201382}}{{sfn|Unger|1964|loc=ch. 11}}\n\n===Foreign affairs===\n{{further |Hamilton Fish}}\nHistorians credit Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] with a highly effective foreign policy.

After a hasty trial, the local Spanish officials executed 53 would-be insurgents, eight of whom were United States citizens; orders from Madrid to delay the executions arrived too late. War scares erupted in both the U.S. and Spain, heightened by the bellicose dispatches from the American minister in Madrid, retired general [[Daniel Sickles]]. Secretary of State Fish kept a cool demeanor in the crisis, and through investigation discovered there was a question over whether the ''Virginius'' ship had the right to bear the United States flag. The Spanish Republic's president [[Emilio Castelar]] expressed profound regret for the tragedy and was willing to make reparations through arbitration. Fish negotiated reparations with the Spanish minister Senor Poly y Bernabe. With Grant's approval, Spain was to surrender ''Virginius'', pay an indemnity to the surviving families of the Americans executed, and salute the American flag; the episode ended quietly.<ref>Bradford 1980.</ref>\n\n====Hawaiian free trade treaty====\nIn December 1874, Grant held a state dinner at the White House for the King of Hawaii, [[David Kalakaua]], who was seeking the importation of Hawaiian sugar duty-free to the United States.{{sfn|Kreiser|p=19}} Grant and Fish were able to produce a successful [[free trade treaty]] in 1875 with the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], incorporating the Pacific islands' sugar industry into the United States' economy sphere.{{sfn|Kreiser|p=19}}\n\n====Liberian-Grebo war====\nThe U.S. settled the war between [[Liberia]] and the native [[Grebo people]] in 1876 by dispatching the {{USS|Alaska|1868|6}} to Liberia. [[James Milton Turner]], the first African American ambassador from the United States, requested that a warship be sent to protect American property in Liberia, a former American colony.

The Democratic Party held the Republican Party responsible for the [[Long Depression]]. The Republicans were divided on the currency issue. Grant, who with hard money North Eastern Republicans, vetoed an inflation bill. Grant was blamed for the nation's problems, while he was accused of wanting a third term.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=462-463}} Grant never officially campaigned, but traveled West, to emphasize his relatively popular Indian policy.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=463-465}}\n\nThe October elections, swept the Republicans from office, and was a repudation of Grant's veto. {{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=783}} In Indiana and Ohio, the Republicans suffered losses, caused by a breakaway Republican [[temperance movement]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=463-465}} The Democratic Party won the New York governorship to Democrat [[Samuel Tilden]].

Six Republican office holders were murdered in [[Coushatta, Louisiana]]. On September 14, General Longstreet, police, and black militia fought 3,500 White Leaguers who attempted to capture the statehouse in New Orleans, that ended with 32 people killed.  Grant issued a dispersal proclamation, the next day, and sent 5,000 troops and 5 gunboats to [[New Orleans]]. The [[White League]] resistance collapsed.

Grant presidential administration reforms|Ulysses S. Grant presidential administration scandals}}\nScandals and frauds continued to be exposed during Grant's second term in office, although Grant's appointments of reformers to his cabinet temporarily helped his presidential reputation, cleaned up federal departments, and defeated the notorious [[Whiskey Ring]]. Grant, however, often remained loyal to cabinet members or appointees involved in corruption or mismanagement, refusing to believe in their guilt. The Democrats along with the Liberal Republicans had gained control of the House of Representatives and held many Committee meetings to stop political graft. The Emma Silver mine was a minor embarrassment associated with American Ambassador to Britain, [[Robert C. Schenck]], using his name to promote a worked out silver mine. The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal's origins were during the presidential Administrations of Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson; however, political congressional infighting during the Grant Administration exposed the scandal.<ref name=\"Rives\">Rives 2000.</ref>\n\n====Sanborn contracts====\n{{further|Sanborn incident}}\n\nIn June 1874, Treasury Secretary [[William Adams Richardson|William A. Richardson]] gave private contracts to one John D. Sanborn who in turn collected illegally withheld taxes for fees at inflated commissions. The profits from the commissions were allegedly split with Richardson and Senator [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]], while Sanborn claimed these payments were \"expenses\". Senator Butler had written a loophole in the law that allowed Sanborn to collect the commissions, but Sanborn would not reveal whom he split the profits with.{{sfn|Hinsdale|1911|p=212\u201413}}\n\n====Pratt & Boyd====\nIn April 1875, it was discovered that Attorney General [[George Henry Williams|George H. Williams]] allegedly received a bribe through a $30,000 gift to his wife from a Merchant house company, Pratt & Boyd, to drop the case for fraudulent customhouse entries. Williams was forced to resign by Grant in 1875.{{sfn|Smith|2001}}\n\n====Delano's Department of Interior ====\nBy 1875, the Department of the Interior under Secretary of Interior [[Columbus Delano]] was in serious disrepair with corruption and fraud. Profiteering prevailed in the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], controlled by corrupt clerks and bogus agents. This proved to be the most serious detriment to Grant's Indian peace policy. Many agents that worked for the department made unscrupulous fortunes and retired with more money than their pay would allow at the expense and exploitation of [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]]. Delano had allowed \"Indian Attorneys\" who were paid by Native American tribes $8.00 a day plus food and travel expenses for sham representation in Washington. Delano exempted his department from Grant's civil service reform implementation in federal offices. Delano told Grant the Interior Department was too large to implement civil service reform.\n\nDelano's son, John Delano, and Ulysses S. Grant's own brother, Orvil Grant, were discovered to have been awarded lucrative corrupt cartographical contracts by Surveyor General Silas Reed. Neither John Delano nor Orvil Grant performed any work or were qualified to hold such surveying positions. Massive fraud was also found in the Patent Office with corrupt clerks who embezzled from the government payroll.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ulysses Simpson Grant |editor=John Y.

Grant then appointed [[Zachariah Chandler]] as Secretary of the Interior who replaced Delano. Chandler vigorously uncovered and cleaned up the fraud in the department by firing all the clerks and banned the phony \"Indian Attorneys\" access to Washington.

Bristow]] discovered that millions of dollars of taxes were being funneled into an illegal ring from whiskey manufacturers. Prosecutions ensued, and many were put in prison. Grant's private Secretary [[Orville E. Babcock]] was indicted and later acquitted in trial.<ref>Rhodes 1906, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0cMTAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA182&dq=Benjamin+Bristow#v=onepage&q=Benjamin%20Bristow&f=false p. 187].</ref> Grant's new Attorney General [[Edwards Pierrepont]] and Bristow formed an anti-corruption team to weed out criminal activity during Grant's second term. The Whiskey Ring was organized throughout the United States, and by 1875 it was a fully operating criminal association. The investigation and closure of the Whiskey Ring resulted in 230 indictments, 110 convictions, and $3,000,000 in tax revenues that were returned to the Treasury Department. Bristow and Pierrpont brought evidence to Grant of Babcock's involvement. Grant asked Babcock with Bristow and Pierrepont in attendance at the White House about the evidence. Babcock gave Grant an explanation that the evidence did not concern the Ring, and Grant quietly accepted Babcock's words at face value. During the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring leaders, Grant testified on behalf of his friend Babcock. As a result, Babcock was acquitted. However, the deposition by Grant was a great embarrassment to his reputation. The Babcock trial turned into an impeachment trial against the President by Grant's political opponents.{{sfn|McFeely|2002|pp=406\u201316}}<ref>Garland 1898, p. 438.</ref>\n\n====Trading post ring====\n{{main|Trader post scandal}}\n\nIn March 1876 it was discovered under House investigations that Secretary of War [[William W. Belknap]] was taking extortion money in exchange for allowing an Indian trading post agent to remain in position at [[Fort Sill]]. Belknap was allowed to resign by Grant and as a result, was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial. Profits were made at the expense of Native Americans who were supposed to receive food and clothing from the government.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=593\u201396}} In late April 1876, Grant lashed out at Lieut. Col. [[George A. Custer]], after Custer had testified at a Congressional committee one month before against Grant's brother Orville and Sec. Belknap.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} There had been rumors Custer had talked with the press concerning the Indian post profiteering.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Custer personally went to the White House to clear matters up with the President. However, Grant refused to see him three times. When Custer left Washington on May 3 to return to Fort Lincoln, he had been removed from overall command by Grant and denied any participation of the [[Great Sioux War|Sioux Campaign]]; having been replaced by Brig. Gen. [[Alfred Terry]]. However, at Terry's insistence, Grant relented and allowed Custer to participate in the campaign against the Sioux on the condition he did not take any pressmen.<ref>[[#Gray|Gray]] (1976), pp. 67\u201371</ref>\n\n====Cattellism====\nIn March 1876, Secretary of Navy [[George M. Robeson]] was charged by a Democratic-controlled House investigation committee with giving lucrative contracts to Alexander Cattell & Company, a grain supplier, in return for real estate, loans, and payment of debts.<ref>Kennedy 2001.</ref> The House investigating committee also discovered that Secretary Robeson had allegedly embezzled $15&nbsp;million in naval construction appropriations.<ref>Muench 2006, p. 74.</ref> Since there were no financial paper trails or enough evidence for impeachment and conviction, the House Investigation committee admonished Robeson and claimed he had set up a corrupt contracting system known as \"Cattellism\".{{sfn|McFeely |2002|p=432}}\n\n====Safe burglary conspiracy====\nIn September 1876, [[Orville E. Babcock]], Superintendent of Public Works and Buildings, was indicted in a safe [[burglary]] [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] case and trial. In April, corrupt building contractors in Washington, D.C. were on trial for graft when a safe robbery occurred. Bogus secret service agents broke into a safe and attempted to frame Columbus Alexander, who had exposed the corrupt contracting ring. Babcock was named as part of the conspiracy, but later [[acquitted]] in the trial against the burglars. Evidence suggests that Backcock was involved with the [[Confidence trick|swindles]] by the corrupt Washington Contractors Ring and he wanted revenge on Columbus Alexander, an avid reformer and critic of the Grant Administration. There was also evidence that safe burglary jury had been tampered with.<ref name=\"The New York Times 1876\">''The New York Times'' 1876</ref><ref name=\"The New York Times 1876\"/>\n\n===Election of 1876===\nIn the [[1876 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1876]], the Republicans nominated the fiscally conservative [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] and the Democrats nominated reformer [[Samuel Tilden]]. Results were split. Tilden received 51% of the popular vote; Hayes 48%; many black Republicans were not allowed to vote, however. Twenty key electoral votes remained undecided and in dispute. Both Republicans and Democrats claimed victory and the threat of a second civil war was eminent. Grant was watchful; encouraged Congress to settle the election by commission; and determined to keep a peaceful transfer of power. On January 29, 1877, Grant signed the [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission Act]] that gave a 15-member bipartisan commission power to determine electoral votes. The commission gave Hayes 185 electoral votes; Tilden received 184. Grant's personal honesty, firmness, and even-handedness reassured the nation and a second civil war was averted.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=596\u2013605}}<ref>Paul Leland Haworth, ''The Hayes-Tilden disputed presidential election of 1876'' (1906).

Grant administration}}\n\nGrant's presidency has traditionally been viewed by historians as incompetent and full of corruption. An examination of his presidency reveals Grant had both successes and failures during his two terms in office. In recent years historians have elevated his presidential rating because of his support for [[African American]] civil rights. Grant had urged the passing of the 15th Amendment and signed into law the Civil Rights Bill of 1875 that gave all citizens access to places of public enterprise. He leaned heavily toward the Radical camp and often sided with their Reconstruction policies, signing into law Force Acts to prosecute the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. In foreign policy Grant won praise for the Treaty of Washington, settling the [[Alabama Claims]] issue with Britain through [[International Arbitration|arbitration]]. Economically he sided with Eastern bankers and signed the Public Credit Act that paid U.S. debts in gold specie, but was blamed for the severe economic depression that lasted 1873\u20131877.<ref>C-SPAN 2009 Historians Presidential Leadership Survey</ref> Grant, wary of powerful congressional leaders, was the first president to ask for a [[line item veto|line item]] veto\u2014though Congress never allowed one.<ref>Weisburger, ''The Item And \"fight 'em\" Veto'', ''American Heritage'' (November, 1995),</ref>\n\nHis presidency was inundated with many scandals caused by low standards and carelessness with his political appointees and personal associates. [[Nepotism]], practiced by Grant, was unrestrained with almost forty family members or relatives who financially benefited from government appointments or employment.<ref name=\"Lawrence M. Salinger 2005 374\u2013375\"/> It was impossible for Grant to morally check all of the corruption generated from the socioeconomic forces of a costly [[American Civil War]], rapid industrialization, and Westward expansionism.<ref name=\"Woodward 1957\">Woodward 1957.</ref> His associations with these scandals have tarnished his personal reputation while president and afterward. Despite the scandals, by the end of Grant's second term the corruption in the Departments of Interior (1875), Treasury (1874), and Justice (1875) were cleaned up by his new cabinet members.<ref>Nevins 1957, p. 833.</ref>\n\nGrant's generous treatment of [[Robert E. Lee]] at [[Battle of Appomattox Courthouse|Appomattox]] helped give him popularity in the South. Although he kept civil rights on the political agenda, the Republican party at the end of Grant's second term shifted to pursuing conservative fiscal policies. His weak response to the Panic of 1873 hurt the economy and seriously damaged his party, which lost heavily in 1874. Grant's financial policies favored Wall Street, but his term ended with the nation mired in a deep economic depression that Grant could not comprehend or deal with.<ref>Simon 1997, pp. 258\u2013259.</ref> Revisionist historians during the first half of the twentieth century have tended to prop up a romantic view of the Confederacy and the [[Lost Cause]] at the expense of downgrading the Union cause and Grant's presidency as a corrupt despot.<ref name=\"Skidmorepp150\u2014151\">Skidmore, pp. 150\u2013151</ref>\nThe 20th-century historical views of Grant were less favorable. Political analyst [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]] noted in 1998 that, \"Ulysses S. Grant is universally ranked among the greatest American generals, and his Memoirs are widely considered to belong with the best military autobiographies ever written. But he is inevitably named, by conservatives as well as liberals, as one of the worst presidents in American history.\"<ref name=Better>Michael Barone, [http://www.weeklystandard.com/grant-and-the-historians/article/10329 \"A Better President Than They Think\"], ''The Weekly Standard'' (August 3, 1998).</ref> Barone argues that: \"This consensus, however, is being challenged by writers outside the professional historians' guild.\" Barone points to a lawyer [[Frank Scaturro]], who led the movement to restore [[Grant's Tomb]] while only a college student, and in 1998 wrote the first book of the modern era which portrays Grant's presidency in a positive light.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scaturro|first=Frank|title=President Grant Reconsidered|year=1998|publisher=Madison Books|location=Lanham|isbn=1-56833-132-0}}</ref> Barone said that Scaturro's work was a \"convincing case that Grant was a strong and, in many important respects, successful president. It is an argument full of significance for how we see the course of American political history&nbsp;... Scaturro's work&nbsp;... should prompt a reassessment of the entire Progressive-New Deal Tradition.\"<ref name=Better/>\n\nIn the 21st Century, Grant's reputation and ranking had significantly increased, that followed a series of positive biographies written by noted historians, that included [[Jean Edward Smith]], ''Grant'',{{sfn|Smith|2001}} [[H.W.

Grant''' began on March 4, 1869, when [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugurated]] as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|18th]] [[president of the United States]], and ended on March 4, 1877. Grant took office in the aftermath of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], and he presided over much of the [[Reconstruction Era]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], [[Ulysses S. Grant|Grant]] became president after defeating [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Horatio Seymour]] in the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]]. He was reelected in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]] in a [[landslide victory]], overcoming a split in the Republican Party that resulted in the formation of the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republicans]], which nominated [[Horace Greeley]] to oppose him. He was succeeded as president by Republican [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] after the contested [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]].\n\nReconstruction took precedence during Grant's two terms of office. The [[Ku Klux Klan]] caused widespread violence throughout the South against African Americans. By 1870, all former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] states had been readmitted into the United States and were represented in Congress. However Democrats, or former slave owners, violently refused to accept that freedmen were citizens, who were granted suffrage by the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]]. By 1871 Klan activity was becoming out of control, while Grant and Congress created the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] and had passed three [[Force Acts]]. Grant and his Attorney General [[Amos T. Akerman]] began a crackdown on Klan in the South, starting in South Carolina, making arrests and convictions, causing the Klan to demobilize and ensuring a fair election for 1872. Rather than develop a cadre of trustworthy political advisers, Grant was self-reliant in choosing his [[Cabinet of the United States|cabinet]]. He relied heavily on former Army associates, who had a thin understanding of politics and a weak sense of civilian ethics. Numerous scandals plagued his administration, including allegations of bribery, fraud, and cronyism. In 1872, Grant signed into law an [[Act of Congress]] that established [[Yellowstone National Park]], the nation's first National Park.\n\nA strong economy, reduction of the national debt, federal spending, tariffs, and the federal workforce, aided Grant in getting reelected. Congress established a de facto deflationary [[gold standard]] that reduced the number of [[Greenback (1860s money)|greenbacks]] in the national economy.\nHowever, financial overinvestment in railroad construction, caused the [[Panic of 1873]], and economic turmoil. The [[Long Depression]] that followed, and Grant's veto of an inflation bill, turned public opinion against him. Democrats regained control of the House in the [[United States elections, 1874|1874 elections]]. While scandals escalated, reformers appointed by Grant were able to clean up some federal departments. Most notably, Secretary of the Treasury [[Benjamin Bristow]] prosecuted the [[Whiskey Ring]], leading to the indictment of Grant's personal secretary, [[Orville E. Babcock]].  Grant continued to support Reconstruction, and he signed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1875]], which banned discrimination in [[public accommodations]]. Secretary of War [[William W. Belknap]] suddenly resigned office in February 1876; afterwards impeached by the House for taking kickbacks. When Grant left office in 1877, [[Redeemers]] in the South, controlled all state governments.\n\nThe United States was at peace with the world throughout Grant's eight years in office, but his handling of foreign policy was uneven. Tensions with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes in the West continued. Under the talented Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]], the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]] restored relations with Britain and resolved the contentious [[Alabama Claims|''Alabama'' Claims]], while the [[Virginius Affair|''Virginius'' Affair]] with [[Spain]] was settled peacefully. Grant attempted to [[Annexation of Santo Domingo|annex]] the Caribbean island of [[Santo Domingo]], but the annexation was blocked by the Senate.\n\nWith the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869, the West was wide open to expansionism that sometimes was challenged by hostile Native Americans. Grant pursued a ''Peace'' policy with Native Americans, but persistent western expansion by settlers made conflict difficult to avoid. Grant presided over the [[Great Sioux War of 1876]] and other clashes with the Native Americans. Grant's presidency was traditionally denounced by historians due to corruption charges among subordinates, despite efforts of reform in his administration. His presidential reputation has greatly risen over the past few decades among historians who have noted that Grant advanced a modern presidency, that included a reformed Indian policy, [[African American]] civil rights, the first Civil Service Commission, and protected women under federal law.\n{{TOC limit|4}}\n\n==Election of 1868==\n{{main|United States presidential election, 1868}}\n[[File:Grant-Colfax.png|right|thumb|250px|Grant-Colfax Campaign Poster 1868]]\nGrant's rise in political popularity among Republicans was based on his Union military service during the Civil War, his successful generalship that defeated [[Robert E. Lee]], and his break from President [[Andrew Johnson]] over the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]], when Grant returned the War Office back to [[Edwin Stanton]].{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=244}} His presidential nomination was unopposed and inevitable. The Republican Party delegates unanimously nominated Ulysses S. Grant (''Ohio'') the Republican Party presidential candidate at its May convention held in Chicago.  [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Schuyler Colfax]] (''Indiana''), was chosen its vice presidential candidate.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=244}} The 1868 Republican Party platform advocated enfranchisement of [[African Americans]] in the South but kept the issue open in the North. It opposed using [[Greenback (money)|greenbacks]], only gold, to redeem U.S. bonds, encouraged immigration, endorsed full rights for naturalized citizens, and favored radical reconstruction as distinct from the more lenient policy espoused by President [[Andrew Johnson]].{{sfn|Republican Party National Platform May 1868}} In Grant's acceptance letter he said: \"Let us have peace.\"{{sfn|Simpson|2014|page=246}}{{efn|Historian Brooks Simpson says these four simple words expressed the \"innermost desires of many Americans.\"{{sfn|Simpson|2014|page=246}}}} These words became the Republican popular mantra.{{sfnm|Simpson|2014|1p=246|Simon|2002|2p=244}}\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1868.svg|thumb|left|200px|Electoral Vote Results 1868]]\nThe Democratic Party, divided by the Civil War, reunited and was determined to take back the presidency. Democrats accepted the end of slavery and focused on economic policy.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=245}} The party held its July convention in New York at Tammany Hall. [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]], leader of the Ku Klux Klan, attended its proceedings.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=46}} The party delegates finally nominated [[Horatio Seymour]] (''New York'') the Democratic Party presidential candidate. Seymour was the war governor of New York but had been reluctant to send Union troops to the war front, favored the anti-war [[Copperheads (politics)|Copperheads]], and ineptly handled the New York draft riots. To counter Seymour's political liabilities, the delegates nominated [[Francis Preston Blair Jr.|Francis P. Blair]] (''Missouri'') for vice president. Although Blair was a Union soldier who served under General [[William T. Sherman]], Blair's campaign rhetoric was caustic and said Reconstruction governments in the South were corrupt and out of control.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=245}} The Democratic Party platform advocated war bonds be redeemed with $100,000,000 in [[Greenback (money)|greenback]]s and the rest with gold. It advocated former Confederates be allowed to hold elective offices.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=245}}\n\nGrant won the presidential election with an overwhelming [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] victory, receiving 214 votes to Seymour's 80. Grant also received 52.7 percent of the popular vote nationwide. Grant's margin of victory was enhanced by six southern states controlled by Republicans, while many ex-Confederates were still prevented from voting.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=245}}\n\n==First term 1869\u20131873==\n[[file:Inauguration of President Grant - NARA - 528934.jpg|270px|right|thumb|''Inauguration of President Grant''<br>Mathew Brady March 4, 1869]]\n\nOn March 4, 1869, Grant was sworn in as the eighteenth president of the United States by Chief Justice [[Salmon P. Chase]]. At age forty-six, he was the youngest president yet elected.{{sfn|White|2016|p=471}} In his inaugural address, Grant urged the ratification of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifteenth Amendment]] and said he would approach Reconstruction \"calmly, without prejudice, hate or sectional pride.\"{{sfn|Patrick|1968|p=166}} He also recommended the \"proper treatment\" of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] be studied, advocating their civilization and eventual citizenship.{{sfn|McFeely|1981|p=305}} Grant pledged all laws would be \"faithfully executed\" and argued war bonds redeemed in gold would lower future interest rates.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=246}}\n\nGrant's [[Ulysses S. Grant#Cabinet|cabinet choices]] surprised the nation and were met with both criticism and approval.{{sfnm|Smith|2001|1pp=465\u2013466|White|2016|2pp=475, 530|Chernow|2017|3pp=635\u2013636|Simon|2002|p=246}} Grant appointed [[Elihu B. Washburne]] Secretary of State, as a friendship courtesy, only to briefly serve office, and then be appointed Minister to France. Grant then appointed conservative [[Hamilton Fish]], former governor of New York, to succeed Washburne.  Grant appointed wealthy New York merchant [[Alexander T. Stewart]] Secretary of Treasury, but he was quickly found to be disqualified by a federal law that prohibited anyone in office to engage in commerce. When Congress would not amend the law, an embarrassed Grant appointed Massachusetts Congressman [[George S. Boutwell]], to replace Stewart.{{sfn|Simon|2002|p=246}}\n\nGrant appointed close friend [[John A. Rawlins]] Secretary of War. After serving only a few months Rawlins died in office. Afterward, Grant appointed [[William W. Belknap]] of [[Iowa]] Secretary of War.{{sfnm|White|2016|1pp=507, 564|Simon|2002|2pp=246\u2013247}} Grant appointed Philadelphia merchant [[Adolph E. Borie]] Secretary of Navy who soon resigned due to the stress of running the department. Grant appointed relatively unknown [[George M. Robeson]] of New Jersey to replace Borie.{{sfnm|Chernow|2017|1p=628|Simon|2002|2pp=246\u2013247}} Grant made three respected appointments: former Ohio Governor [[Jacob D. Cox]] Secretary of the Interior, former Senator from Maryland [[John Creswell]] Postmaster General, and [[Ebenezer Rockwood Hoar]] Attorney General.{{sfnm|Smith|2001|1pp=446, 469\u2013470|Simon|2002|2pp=246-247}}\n\n===Revised Tenure of Office Act===\nIn March 1869, President Grant made it known he desired the [[Tenure of Office Act (1867)|Tenure of Office Act]] repealed, stating it was a \"stride toward a revolution in our free system\". The Tenure of Office Act was passed by Congress in 1867, sponsored by Radical Republicans, to curb the power of President [[Andrew Johnson]] in making government office appointments. The controversial law had been invoked during the impeachment trial of Johnson in 1868. To bolster the repeal effort, Grant declined to make any new appointments except for vacancies, until the law was overturned. On March 9, 1869, the House repealed the law outright, but the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected the bill and only offered Grant a temporary suspension of the law. When Grant objected, the Senate Republican caucus met, and proposed allowing the President to have a free hand in choosing and removing his own cabinet. The Senate Judiciary Committee wrote the new bill. A muddled compromise was reached by the House and Senate. Grant signed the bill into law on April 5, having gotten virtually everything he wanted.{{sfnm|Kahan|2018|1pp=50-51|Calhoun|2017|2pp=75-77}}\n\n===Reconstruction===\n{{further|Reconstruction era of the United States}}\n\nThe [[American Civil War|Civil War]] brought on a Northern policy of Reconstruction on the former Confederate States that included an absolute \"economic, political, and economic transformation of the South.\"{{sfn|Kahan|2018|pp=60-61}} The primary goals were the reunification of the nation and the integration of African Americans, given citizenship, into American \"political, economic, and social life.\"{{sfn|Kahan|2018|pp=60-61}} Grant was considered an \"engaged and effective executive\" concerning civil rights for African Americans.{{sfn|Kahan|2018|pp=60-61}} Grant hosted Louisiana's [[Oscar J. Dunn]] at the White House, America's first elected African American lieutenant governor.{{sfn|Kahan|2018|pp=60-61}} Grant appointed [[Ebenezer Bassett]]  minister resident to Haiti, America's first African American diplomat. Grant signed an equal rights bill into law for African Americans in the District of Columbia.{{sfn|Kahan|2018|pp=60-61}}\n\n====Fifteenth Amendment====\n{{Further|Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution}}\n\nGrant worked to ensure [[ratification]] of the Fifteenth Amendment approved by Congress and sent to the states during the last days of the Johnson administration. The amendment prohibited the federal and state governments from denying a citizen the [[Suffrage|right to vote]] based on that citizen's \"[[Race (human classification)|race]], [[Colored|color]], or previous condition of servitude.\"<ref name=15thA>{{cite web|last=Huckabee|first=David C.|title=Ratification of Amendments to the U.S. Constitution|url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/crs/97-922.pdf|work=[[Congressional Research Service reports]]|publisher=[[Congressional Research Service]], The [[Library of Congress]]|location=Washington D.C.|date=September 30, 1997}}</ref>{{sfn|Hesseltine|1935|loc=ch. 11}} On December 24, 1869, Grant established federal military rule in Georgia and restored black legislators who had been expelled from the state legislature.{{sfn|Grant|1990|p=1146}}{{sfn|Duncan|1986|pp=9\u201310}}{{sfn|Etcheson|2009}} On February 3, 1870, the amendment reached the requisite number of state ratifications (then 27) and was certified as the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.<ref name=15thA/> Grant hailed its ratification as \"a measure of grander importance than any other one act of the kind from the foundation of our free government to the present day\".{{sfn|McPherson|1880|p=545}} By mid-1870 former Confederate states: Virginia, Texas, Mississippi, and Georgia had ratified the 15th Amendment and were readmitted to the Union.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=99-101}}\n\n====Department of Justice====\n{{See also|United States Department of Justice}}\n\nOn June 22, 1870, Grant signed a bill into law passed by Congress that created the Department of Justice and to aid the Attorney General, the Office of [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]]. Grant appointed [[Amos T. Akerman]] as Attorney General and [[Benjamin H. Bristow]] as America's first Solicitor General. Both Akerman and Bristow used the Department of Justice to vigorously prosecute [[Ku Klux Klan]] members in the early 1870s. Grant appointed [[Hiram C. Whitley]] as director of the new Secret Service Agency in 1869, after he had successfully arrested 12 Klansmen in Georgia who would murdered a leading local Republican official. Whitley used talented detectives who infiltrated and broke up KKK units in North Carolina and Alabama. However they could not penetrate the main hotbed of KKK activity in upstate South Carolina. Grant sent in Army troops but Whitley's agents learned they were lying below until the troops were withdrawn. Whitley warned Akerman, who convinced Grant to declare martial law and send in US marshals backed by federal troops to arrest 500 Klansmen; hundred more fled the state, and hundreds of others surrendered in return for leniency.<ref>Charles Lane, ''Freedom's Detective: The Secret Service, the Ku Klux Klan and the Man Who Masterminded America's First War on Terror'' (2019) pp 181-84.</ref><ref>Jerry West, ''The Reconstruction Ku Klux Klan in York County, South Carolina, 1865-1877'' (2002).</ref>\n\nIn the first few years of Grant's first term in office, there were 1000 indictments against Klan members with over 550 convictions from the Department of Justice. By 1871, there were 3000 indictments and 600 convictions with most only serving brief sentences while the ringleaders were imprisoned for up to five years in the federal penitentiary in [[Albany, New York]]. The result was a dramatic decrease in violence in the South. Akerman gave credit to Grant and told a friend that no one was \"better\" or \"stronger\" than Grant when it came to prosecuting terrorists.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=542\u201347}} Akerman's successor, [[George Henry Williams|George H. Williams]], in December 1871, continued to prosecute the Klan throughout 1872 until the Spring of 1873 during Grant's second term in office.<ref name=Willams_p123>{{cite book|first=Lou Falkner|last=Williams|date=1996|title=The Great South Carolina Ku Klux Klan Trials, 1871\u20131872|p=123}}</ref> Williams' clemency and moratorium on Klan prosecutions was due in part to the fact that the Justice Department, having been inundated by Klan outrage cases, did not have the effective manpower to continue the prosecutions.<ref name=Willams_p123/>\n\n====Naturalization Act of 1870====\nOn July 14, 1870, Grant signed into law the [[Naturalization Act of 1870]] that allowed persons of African descent to become citizens of the United States. This revised an earlier law, the [[Naturalization Act of 1790]] that only allowed white persons of good moral character to become U.S. citizens. The law also prosecuted persons who used fictitious names, misrepresentations, or identities of deceased individuals when applying for citizenship.<ref>{{cite web|first=Eillen|last=Bolger|year=2003|title=Background History of the United States Naturalization Process|url=https://socialwelfare.library.vcu.edu/federal/naturalization-process-in-u-s-early-history/}}</ref>\n\n====Force Acts of 1870 and 1871====\n{{Further|Enforcement Act of 1870|Force Act of 1871|Ku Klux Klan}}\n\nTo add enforcement to the 15th Amendment, Congress passed an act that guaranteed the protection of voting rights of African Americans; Grant signed the bill, known as the [[Force Act of 1870]] into law on May 31, 1870. This law was designed to keep the [[Redeemers]] from attacking or threatening African Americans. This act placed severe penalties on persons who used intimidation, bribery, or physical assault to prevent citizens from voting and placed elections under Federal jurisdiction.{{sfn|Scaturro|2006}}\n\nOn January 13, 1871, Grant submitted to Congress a report on violent acts committed by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the South. On March 20, Grant told a reluctant Congress the situation in the South was dire and federal legislation was needed that would \"secure life, liberty, and property, and the enforcement of law, in all parts of the United States.\"{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=346}} Grant stated that the U.S. mail and the collection of revenue was in jeopardy.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=346}} Congress investigated the Klan's activities and eventually passed the [[Force Act of 1871]] to allow prosecution of the Klan. This Act, also known as the \"Ku Klux Klan Act\" and written by Representative [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]], was passed by Congress to specifically go after local units of the Ku Klux Klan. Although sensitive to charges of establishing a military dictatorship, Grant signed the bill into law on April 20, 1871, after being convinced by Secretary of Treasury, [[George Boutwell]], that federal protection was warranted, having cited documented atrocities against the [[Freedmen]].{{sfn|Grant|1990|pp=1146, 1147}}{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=368\u201369}} This law allowed the president to suspend [[habeas corpus]] on \"armed combinations\" and conspiracies by the Klan. The Act also empowered the president \"to arrest and break up disguised night [[wikt:marauder|marauders]]\". The actions of the Klan were defined as high crimes and acts of rebellion against the United States.{{sfn|Trelease|1995|loc=ch. 22\u201325}}{{sfn|McFeely|1981|pp=368\u2013369}}\n\nThe Ku Klux Klan consisted of local secret organizations formed to violently oppose Republican rule during Reconstruction; there was no organization above the local level. Wearing white hoods to hide their identity the Klan would attack and threaten Republicans. The Klan was strong in South Carolina between 1868 and 1870; South Carolina Governor [[Robert Kingston Scott|Robert K. Scott]], who was mired in corruption charges, allowed the Klan to rise to power.<ref>National Governors Association.{{full citation needed|date=March 2018}}</ref> Grant, who was fed up with their violent tactics, ordered the Ku Klux Klan to disperse from South Carolina and lay down their arms under the authority of the Enforcement Acts on October 12, 1871. There was no response, and so on October 17, 1871, Grant issued a suspension of habeas corpus in all the 9 counties in South Carolina. Grant ordered federal troops in the state who then captured the Klan; who were vigorously prosecuted by Att. Gen. [[Amos T. Akerman|Akerman]] and Sol. Gen. [[Benjamin Bristow|Bristow]]. With the Klan destroyed other white supremacist groups would emerge, including the [[White League]] and the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]].{{sfn|Scaturro|2006}}\n\n====Amnesty Act of 1872====\n{{Main|Amnesty Act of 1872}}\n\n[[Texas]] was readmitted into the Union on March 30, 1870, [[Mississippi]] was readmitted February 23, 1870, and [[Virginia]] on January 26, 1870. [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] became the last Confederate state to be readmitted into the Union on July 15, 1870. All members of the House of Representatives and Senate were seated from the 10 Confederate states who seceded.

The Senate confirmed Parker by a vote of 36 to 12.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=265-266}} During Parker's tenure Native wars dropped from 101 in 1869 to 58 in 1870.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=362}}\n\nEarly on Grant met with tribal chiefs of the Choctaw, Creek, Cherokee, and Chickasaw nations who expressed interest to teach \"wild\" Natives outside their own settled districts farming skills.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=267}} Grant told the Native chiefs that American settlement would lead to inevitable conflict, but that the \"march to civilization\" would lead to pacification. On April 10, 1869, Congress created the [[Board of Indian Commissioners]]. Grant appointed volunteer members who were \"eminent for their intelligence and philanthropy.\" The Grant Board was given extensive joint-power with Grant, Secretary of Interior Cox, and the Interior Department to supervise the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] and \"civilize\" Native Americans. No Natives were appointed to the committee, only [[European Americans]]. The commission monitored purchases and began to inspect Native agencies. It attributed much of the trouble in Native country to the encroachment of whites. The board approved of the destruction of Native culture.

On July 15, 1870, Grant signed Congressional legislation that barred military officers from holding either elected or appointed office or suffer dismissal from the Army.

Red Cloud, at a previous meeting with Secretary Cox and Commissioner Parker, complained that promised rations and arms for hunting had not been delivered. Afterward, Grant and Cox lobbied Congress for the promised supplies and rations. Congress responded and on July 15, 1870, Grant signed the Indian Appropriations Act into law that appropriated the tribal monies. Two days after Spotted Tail urged the Grant administration to keep white settlers from invading Native reservation land, Grant ordered all Generals in the West to \"keep intruders off by military force if necessary\".{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=270-272}} In 1871, Grant signed another Indians Appropriations Act that ended the governmental policy of treating tribes as independent sovereign nations.

In 1872, the implementation of the policy involved the allotting of Indian reservations to religious organizations as exclusive religious domains. Of the 73 agencies assigned, the [[Methodists]] received fourteen; the Orthodox [[Quakers|Friends]] ten; the [[Presbyterians]] nine; the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] eight; the [[Roman Catholics]] seven; the Hicksite [[Quakers|Friends]] six; the [[Baptists]] five; the [[Dutch Reformed]] five; the [[Congregationalists]] three; [[Christians]] two; [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] two; [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] one; and [[Lutherans]] one.

Walker.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=273}}\n\n===Financial affairs===\nOn taking office Grant's first move was signing the Act to Strengthen the Public Credit, which the Republican Congress had just passed. It ensured that all public debts, particularly war bonds, would be paid only in gold rather than in greenbacks. The price of gold on the New York exchange fell to $130 per ounce \u2013 the lowest point since the suspension of specie payment in 1862.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=480\u201381}}\n\nOn May 19, 1869, Grant protected the wages of those working for the U.S. Government. In 1868, a law was passed that reduced the government working day to 8 hours; however, much of the law was later repealed that allowed day wages to also be reduced. To protect workers Grant signed an executive order that \"no reduction shall be made in the wages\" regardless of the reduction in hours for the government day workers.<ref>Grant (1869), ''Respecting Wages of labor'', Executive Order</ref>\n\nTreasury Secretary [[George S. Boutwell]] reorganized and reformed the [[United States Treasury]] by discharging unnecessary employees, started sweeping changes in [[Bureau of Printing and Engraving]] to protect the currency from [[Counterfeit money|counterfeiters]], and revitalized tax collections to hasten the collection of revenue. These changes soon led the Treasury to have a monthly surplus.{{sfn|Smith|2001}} By May 1869, Boutwell reduced the national debt by $12&nbsp;million. By September the national debt was reduced by $50&nbsp;million, which was achieved by selling the growing gold surplus at weekly auctions for [[United States Note|greenbacks]] and buying back wartime bonds with the currency. The ''[[New York Tribune]]'' wanted the government to buy more bonds and greenbacks and the ''[[New York Times]]'' praised the Grant administration's debt policy.{{sfn|Smith|2001}}\n\nThe first two years of the Grant administration with George Boutwell at the Treasury helm expenditures had been reduced to $292&nbsp;million in 1871 \u2013 down from $322&nbsp;million in 1869. The cost of collecting taxes fell to 3.11% in 1871. Grant reduced the number of employees working in the government by 2,248 persons from 6,052 on March 1, 1869, to 3,804 on December 1, 1871. He had increased tax revenues by $108&nbsp;million from 1869 to 1872. During his first administration the national debt fell from $2.5&nbsp;billion to $2.2&nbsp;billion.<ref>''The New York Times'' 1872, \"The Conduct of the Finances\".</ref>\n\nIn a rare case of preemptive reform during the Grant Administration, Brevet Major General [[Alfred Pleasonton]] was dismissed for being unqualified to hold the position of [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue]]. In 1870, Pleasonton, a Grant appointment, approved an unauthorized $60,000 tax refund and was associated with an alleged unscrupulous Connecticut firm. Treasury Secretary [[George Boutwell]] promptly stopped the refund and personally informed Grant that Pleasonton was incompetent to hold office. Refusing to resign on Boutwell's request, Pleasonton protested openly before Congress. Grant removed Pleasonton before any potential scandal broke out.<ref>Boutwell 2008, pp. 131\u2013133.</ref>\n\n===Foreign affairs===\n{{Further|History of U.S. foreign policy, 1861\u20131897}}\n\nGrant was a man of peace, and almost wholly devoted to domestic affairs. There were no foreign-policy disasters, and no wars to engage in. Besides Grant himself, the main players in foreign affairs were Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee [[Charles Sumner]]. They had to cooperate to get a treaty ratified. When Sumner stopped Grant's plan to annex Santo Domingo, Grant had his vengeance by systematically destroying Sumner's power and ending his career. Historians have a high regard for the diplomatic professionalism, independence, and good judgment of Hamilton Fish. The main issues involved Britain, Canada, Santo Domingo, Cuba and Spain.  Worldwide, it was peaceful era, with no major wars directly affecting the United States. In Europe, [[Otto von Bismarck]] was leading Prussia into a dominant position in the new united German Empire. After short, decisive wars with Denmark, Austria and France ended in 1871, Bismarck was the dominant figure in Europe, and worked tirelessly and successfully to promote a peaceful continent until his removal in 1890.<ref>The main scholarly history remains [[Allan Nevins]], ''Hamilton Fish: The inner history of the Grant administration'' (two volumes 1937) 932 PP, winner of the Pulitzer Prize. the most recent scholarly survey is Charles W Calhoun, ''The Presidency of Ulysses S.

Previously in 1868, President [[Andrew Johnson]] had proposed annexation but Congress refused.  In July 1869 Grant sent [[Orville E. Babcock]] and [[Rufus Ingalls]] who negotiated a draft treaty with Dominican Republic president [[Buenaventura B\u00e1ez]] for the annexation of Santo Domingo to the United States and the sale of [[Saman\u00e1 Bay]] for $2&nbsp;million. To keep the island nation and B\u00e1ez secure in power, Grant ordered naval ships to secure the island from invasion and internal insurrection. B\u00e1ez signed an annexation treaty on November 19, 1869. Secretary Fish drew up a final draft of the proposal and offered $1.5&nbsp;million to the Dominican national debt, the annexation of [[Santo Domingo]] as an American state, the United States' acquisition of the rights for [[Saman\u00e1 Bay]] for 50 years with an annual $150,000 rental, and guaranteed protection from foreign intervention. On January 10, 1870, the Santo Domingo treaty was submitted to the Senate for ratification. Despite his support of the annexation, Grant made the mistakes of not building support in Congress or the country at large. {{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=499\u2013502}}{{sfn|Grant|1990|pp=1145\u201347}}<ref>Harold T.

By providing a safe haven for the freedmen, he believed that the exodus of black labor would force Southern whites to realize the necessity of such a significant workforce and accept their civil rights. Grant believed the island country would increase exports and lower the trade deficit. He hoped that U.S. ownership of the island would push Spain to abolish slavery in Cuba and  Puerto Rico, and perhaps Brazil as well. {{sfn|Grant|1990|pp=1145\u201347}} On March 15, 1870, the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations Committee]], headed by Sen.

The Grant administration turned a blind eye to this violation of American neutrality.<ref>Charles Campbell,  ''The Transformation of American Foreign Relations'' (1976) pp 53=59.</ref>  In 1869, Grant was urged by popular opinion to support rebels in Cuba with military assistance and to give them U.S. diplomatic recognition. Fish, however, wanted stability and favored the Spanish government, without publicly challenging the popular anti-Spanish American viewpoint.  They reassured European governments that the U.S. did not want to annex Cuba. Grant and Fish gave lip service to Cuban independence, called for an end to slavery in Cuba, and quietly opposed American military intervention. Fish, worked diligently against popular pressure, and was able to keep Grant from officially recognizing Cuban independence because it would have endangered negotiations with Britain over the [[Alabama Claims]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Corning 1918, pp. 49\u201354.</ref> Minister to Spain [[Daniel Sickles]] failed to get Spain to agree to American mediation.

Grant's able Secretary of State Hamilton Fish had orchestrated many of the events leading up to the treaty. Previously, Secretary of State [[William H. Seward]] during the Johnson administration first proposed an initial treaty concerning damages done to American merchants by three Confederate warships, [[CSS Florida|CSS ''Florida'']], [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']], and [[CSS Shenandoah|CSS ''Shenandoah'']] built in Britain. These damages were collectively known as the [[Alabama Claims]]. These ships had inflicted tremendous damage to U.S. shipping, as insurance rates soared and shippers switched to British ships. Washington wanted the British to pay heavy damages, perhaps including turning over Canada.<ref>Hackett 1911, pp. 45\u201350.</ref>\n[[File:CSSAlabama.jpg|150px|thumb|Confederate Warship [[CSS Alabama|CSS ''Alabama'']]<br />Active service (1862\u20131864)]]\nIn April 1869, the U.S. Senate overwhelmingly rejected a proposed treaty which paid too little and contained no admission of British guilt for prolonging the war. Senator [[Charles Sumner]] spoke up before Congress; publicly denounced [[Queen Victoria]]; demanded a huge reparation; and opened the possibility of Canada ceded to the United States as payment. The speech angered the British government, and talks had to be put off until matters cooled down. Negotiations for a new treaty began in January 1871 when Britain sent [[Sir John Rose, 1st Baronet|Sir John Rose]] to America to meet with Fish. A joint high commission was created on February 9, 1871, in Washington, consisting of representatives from both Britain and the United States. The commission created a treaty where an international Tribunal would settle the damage amounts; the British admitted regret, not fault, over the destructive actions of the Confederate war cruisers. Grant approved and signed the treaty on May 8, 1871; the Senate ratified the Treaty of Washington on May 24, 1871.<ref name=\"Corning 1918 59\u201384\">Corning 1918, [https://archive.org/details/hamiltonfish00corngoog <!-- quote=Hamilton Fish. --> pp. 59\u201384]</ref>{{sfn|Grant|1990|p=1146}}\nThe Tribunal met on neutral territory in Geneva, Switzerland.

Korea was a small independent country that excluded all foreign trade.  Washington sought a treaty dealing with shipwrecked sailors after the crew of a stranded American commercial ship was executed. The long-term goal for the Grant Administration was to open Korea to Western markets in the same way Commodore [[Matthew Calbraith Perry|Matthew Perry]] had opened [[Bakumatsu|Japan]] in 1854 by a Naval display of military force. On May 30, 1871, Rear Admiral [[John Rodgers (American Civil War naval officer)|John Rodgers]] with a fleet of five ships, part of the [[Asiatic Squadron]], arrived at the mouth of the Salee River below [[Seoul]]. The fleet included the {{USS|Colorado|1856|2}}, one of the largest ships in the Navy with 47 guns, 47 officers, and a 571-man crew. While waiting for senior Korean officials to negotiate, Rogers sent ships out to make soundings of the Salee River for navigational purposes.<ref name=\"Miller\">Miller 2003, pp. 146\u2013147.</ref><ref>Chang 2003.</ref>\n\nThe American fleet was fired upon by a Korean fort, but there was little damage. Rogers gave the Korean government ten days to apologize or begin talks, but the Royal Court kept silent. After ten days passed, on June 10, Rogers began a series of [[amphibious warfare|amphibious]] assaults that destroyed 5 Korean forts. These military engagements were known as the [[Battle of Ganghwa]]. Several hundred Korean soldiers and three Americans were killed. Korea still refused to negotiate, and the American fleet sailed away. The Koreans refer to this 1871 U.S. military action as [[Shinmiyangyo]]. Grant defended Rogers in his third annual message to Congress in December 1871.

In 1870, the somewhat more official [[Washburn\u2013Langford\u2013Doane Expedition]] explored the same regions of the upper Yellowstone and geyser basins, naming [[Old Faithful]] and many other park features.

In March 1871 Grant signed into law Congressional legislation appropriating $40,000 to finance the [[Hayden Geological Survey of 1871]]. Hayden was given instructions by Grant's Secretary of Interior, [[Columbus Delano]]. The expedition party was composed of 36 civilians, mostly scientists, and two military escorts. Among the survey party were an artist [[Thomas Moran]] and photographer [[William Henry Jackson]].\n\nHayden's published reports, magazine articles, along with paintings by Moran and photographs by Jackson convinced Congress to preserve the natural wonders of the upper Yellowstone.<ref>{{cite book |editor=Merrill, Marlene Deahl |title=Yellowstone and the Great West-Journals, Letters and Images from the 1871 Hayden Expedition |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, NE |year=1999 |isbn=0-8032-3148-2 |pages=}}</ref> On December 18, 1871, a bill was introduced simultaneously in the Senate, by Senator [[S.C.

Hayden's influence on Congress is readily apparent when examining the detailed information contained in the report of the House Committee on Public Lands: \"The bill now before Congress has for its objective the withdrawal from settlement, occupancy, or sale, under the laws of the United States a tract of land fifty-five by sixty-five miles, about the sources of the Yellowstone and Missouri Rivers, and dedicates and sets apart as a great national park or pleasure-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.\"\nWhen the bill was presented to Congress, the bill's chief supporters, ably prepared by Langford, Hayden and Jay Cooke, convinced their colleagues that the region's real value was as a park area, to be preserved in its natural state. The bill was approved by a comfortable margin in the Senate on January 30, 1872, and by the House on February 27.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haines |first=Aubrey L. |title=The Yellowstone Story-A History of Our First National Park Volume I. |publisher=Yellowstone Library and Museum Association |location=Yellowstone National Park, WY |year=1977 |isbn=0870813900 |chapter=Beyond the Ranges |pages=84\u2013155}}</ref>\n\nOn March 1, 1872, Grant played his role, in signing the \"Act of Dedication\" into law. It established the Yellowstone region as the nation's first national park, made possible by three years of exploration by Cook-Folsom-Peterson (1869), Washburn-Langford-Doane (1870), and Hayden (1871). The 1872 Yellowstone Act prohibited fish and game, including buffalo, from \"wanton destruction\" within the confines of the park. However, Congress did not appropriate funds or legislation for the enforcement against poaching; as a result, Secretary Delano could not hire people to aid tourists or protect Yellowstone from encroachment.<ref name=\"The Last Buffalo\">Kennedy (2001), \"[https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/harp/0606.html The Last Buffalo]\"</ref><ref name=POUSG_1874>Simon (2003) ''Papers of Ulysses S.

The demand was for boots for European armies, or machine belts attached to steam engines. Acres of land were dedicated solely for drying the hides of the slaughtered buffalo. Native Americans protested at the \"wanton destruction\" of their food supply. Between 1872 in 1874, the buffalo herd south of the Platte River yielded 4.4 million kills by white hunters, and about 1 million animals killed by Indians.<ref>Richard White, ''The Republic for which it Stands'' (2017) p 296.</ref>  Popular concern for the destruction of the buffalo mounted, and a bill in Congress was passed, HR 921, that would have made buffalo hunting illegally for whites. Taking advice from Secretary Delano, Grant chose to pocket-veto the bill, believing that the demise of the buffalo would reduce Indian wars and force tribes to stay on their respected reservations and to adopt an agricultural lifestyle rather than roaming the plains and hunting buffalo.<ref name=\"The Last Buffalo\"/> Ranchers wanted the buffalo gone to open pasture land for their cattle herds. With the buffalo food supply lowered, Native Americans were forced to stay on reservations.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=536\u201338}}\n\n===Corruption and reform===\n{{main|Ulysses S.

The plan was to keep the Government from selling gold, thus driving its price. Grant and Secretary of Treasury [[George S. Boutwell]] found out about the gold market speculation and ordered the sale of $4&nbsp;million in gold on (Black) Friday, September 23. Gould and Fisk were thwarted, and the price of gold dropped. The effects of releasing gold by Boutwell were disastrous. Stock prices plunged and food prices dropped, devastating farmers for years.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=481\u201390}}\n\n====Civil service commission and reform====\nThe reform of the spoils system of political patronage entered the national agenda under the Grant presidency, that would take on the fervor of a religious revival.{{sfn|White|2017|p=531}} The distribution of federal jobs by Congressional legislators was considered vital for their reelection to Congress.{{sfn|Schmiel|2014|p=205}} Grant required that all applicants to federal jobs apply directly to the Department heads, rather than the president.{{sfn|Schmiel|2014|p=205}} Two of Grant's appointments, Secretary of Interior [[Jacob D.

Historian John Simon says his efforts at civil service reform were honest, but that they were met with criticism from all sides and were a failure.<ref>John Y. Simon, \"Ulysses S. Grant and Civil Service Reform,\" ''Hayes Historical Journal'' (1984) 4#3 pp 8\u201315.</ref>\n\nGrant was the first president to recommend a professional civil service. He pushed the initial legislation through Congress, and appointed the members for the first [[United States Civil Service Commission]]. The temporary Commission recommended administering competitive exams and issuing regulations on the hiring and promotion of government employees. Grant ordered their recommendations in effect in 1872; having lasted for two years until December 1874. At the New York Custom House, a port that took in hundreds of millions of dollars a year in revenue, applicants for an entry position now had to pass a written civil service examination. [[Chester A. Arthur]] who was appointed by Grant as New York Custom Collector stated that the examinations excluded and deterred unfit persons from getting employment positions.<ref>Howe (1935), p. 48, 295</ref> However, Congress, in no mood to reform itself, denied any long-term reform by refusing to enact the necessary legislation to make the changes permanent. Historians have traditionally been divided whether ''patronage'', meaning appointments made without a merit system, should be labeled corruption.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=587\u201389}}\n\nThe movement for Civil Service reform reflected two distinct objectives: to eliminate the corruption and inefficiencies in a non-professional bureaucracy and to check the power of President Johnson. Although many reformers after the Election of 1868 looked to Grant to ram Civil Service legislation through Congress, he refused, saying: \n{{Quote|Civil Service Reform rests entirely with Congress.

These were known as [[Star routes|Star Routes]] because an asterisk was given on official [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office]] documents. These remote routes were hundreds of miles long and went to the most rural parts of the United States by horse and buggy. In obtaining these highly prized postal contracts, an intricate ring of bribery and straw bidding was set up in the Postal Contract office; the ring consisted of contractors, postal clerks, and various intermediary brokers. Straw bidding was at its highest practice while [[John Creswell]], Grant's 1869 appointment, was [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster-General]]. An 1872 federal investigation into the matter exonerated Creswell, but he was [[Censure in the United States|censured]] by the minority House report. A $40,000 bribe to the [[42nd United States Congress|42nd Congress]] by one postal contractor had tainted the results of the investigation.

Representatives also received a retroactive pay bonus for the previous two years of service. This was done in secret and attached to a general appropriations bill.

When Republicans gathered for their [[1872 Republican National Convention|1872 national convention]] he was unanimously nominated for a second term. [[Henry Wilson]] was selected as his running mate over scandal-tainted Vice President Schuyler Colfax. The party platform advocated high tariffs and a continuation of Radical Reconstruction policies that supported five military districts in the Southern states.\n\nDuring Grant's first term a significant number of Republicans had become completely disillusioned with the party. Weary of the scandals and opposed to several of Grant's policies, split from the party to form the [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republican Party]]. At the party's only national convention, held in May 1872 ''[[New York Tribune]]'' editor Horace Greeley was nominated for president, and [[Benjamin Gratz Brown]] was nominated for vice president. They advocated civil service reform, a low tariff, and granting amnesty to former Confederate soldiers. They also wanted to end reconstruction and restore local self-government in the South.\n\n[[File:ElectoralCollege1872.svg|thumb|left|Electoral Vote Results 1872]]\n\nThe Democrats, who at this time had no strong candidate choice of their own, saw an opportunity to consolidate the anti-Grant vote and jumped on the Greeley bandwagon, reluctantly adopting Greeley and Brown as their nominees.<ref name=\"Rhodes7\">Rhodes 1906, [https://archive.org/details/historyunitedst05rhodgoog <!-- quote=intitle:History intitle:of intitle:the intitle:United intitle:States inauthor:Rhodes inauthor:James. --> v. 7].</ref> It is the only time in American history when a major party endorsed the candidate of a third party.\n\nWhile Grant, like incumbent presidents before him, did not campaign, an efficient party organization composed of thousands of patronage appointees, did so on his behalf.

His campaign was plagued by misstatements and embarrassing moments.\n\nHowever, because of political infighting between Liberal Republicans and Democrats, and due to several campaign blunders, the physically ailing Greeley was no match for Grant, who won in a landslide. Grant won 286 of the 352 Electoral College votes and received 55.8 percent of the popular vote nationwide. The President's reelection victory also brought an overwhelming Republican majority into both houses of Congress. Heartbroken after a hard-fought political campaign, Greeley died a few weeks after the election.

Subsequently, the inaugural ball ended early when the food froze. Wilson died 2 years, 263 days into this term, and the office remained vacant for the balance of it. Departing from the White House, a parade escorted Grant down the newly paved Pennsylvania Avenue, which was all decorated with banners and flags, on to the swearing-in ceremony in front of the Capitol building. Chief Justice [[Salmon P. Chase]] administered the presidential oath of office. This was one of the coldest inaugurations in U.S. history, with the temperature at only 6 degrees at sunrise. After the swearing-in ceremony the inaugural parade commenced down Pennsylvania. The [[The Washington Star|''Evening Star'']] observed. \"The private stands and windows along the entire route were crowded to excess.\" The parade consisted of a variety of military units along with marching bands, and civic organizations. The military units, in their fancy regalia, were the most noticeable. Altogether there were approximately 12,000 marchers who participated, including several units of African-American soldiers. At the inaugural ball there were some 6,000 people in attendance. Great care was taken to ensure that Grant's inaugural ball would be in spacious quarters and would feature an elegant assortment of appetizers, food, and champagne. A large temporary wooden building was constructed at Judiciary Square to accommodate the event. Grant arrived around 11:30pm and the dancing began.<ref>[[#white|White, 2016]], pp. 471\u2013473</ref>{{sfn|Streets of Washington|2017}}<ref>[[#ames|Ames, 1879]], pp. 272, 276</ref>\n\n===Reconstruction===\n{{further|Reconstruction era of the United States}}\nGrant was vigorous in his enforcement of the 14th and 15th amendments and prosecuted thousands of persons who violated African American civil rights; he used military force to put down political insurrections in Louisiana, Mississippi, and South Carolina.{{sfn|Trelease|1995|loc=ch. 24\u201325}} He proactively used military and [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] enforcement of civil rights laws and the protection of African Americans more than any other 19th-century president.

Sumner joined the Liberal Republican movement in 1872 to fight Grant's reelection.<ref>David Herbert Donald, ''Charles Sumner and the Rights of Man'' (1970) ch 12</ref>\n\nConservative resistance to Republican state governments grew after the 1872 elections. With the destruction of the Klan in 1872, new secret paramilitary organizations arose in the Deep South. In Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Louisiana, the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] and [[White League]] operated openly and were better organized than the Ku Klux Klan. Their goals were to oust the Republicans, return Conservative whites to power, and use whatever illegal methods needed to achieve them.

Two months later each candidate was sworn in as governor on January 13, 1873. A federal judge ruled that Kellogg was the rightful winner of the election and ordered him and the Republican-based majority to be seated. The White League supported McEnry and prepared to use military force to remove Kellogg from office. Grant ordered troops to enforce the court order and protect Kellogg. On March 4, Federal troops under a flag of truce and Kellogg's state militia defeated McEnry's fusionist party's insurrection.<ref>Keith 2007, p. 100.</ref>\n\n[[File:The Union as It Was.jpg|thumb|150px|Louisiana White League units in 1874 to terrorized black Republicans]]\nA dispute arose over who would be installed as judge and sheriff at the [[Colfax, Louisiana|Colfax]] courthouse in [[Grant Parish, Louisiana|Grant Parish]]. Kellogg's two appointees had seized control of the Court House on March 25 with aid and protection of black state militia troops. Then on April 13, White League forces attacked the courthouse and massacred 50 black militiamen who had been captured. A total of 105 blacks were killed trying to defend the Colfax courthouse for Governor Kellogg. On April 21, Grant sent in the U.S. [[19th Infantry Regiment (United States)|19th Infantry Regiment]] to restore order. On May 22, Grant issued a new proclamation to restore order in Louisiana. On May 31, McEnry finally told his followers to obey \"peremptory orders\" of the President. The orders brought a brief peace to New Orleans and most of Louisiana, except, ironically, [[Grant Parish]].<ref>Lane 2008, p. 124.</ref>\n\n====Brooks-Baxter war in Arkansas====\n{{main|Brooks\u2013Baxter War}}\nIn the fall of 1872, the Republican party split in Arkansas and ran two candidates for governor, [[Elisha Baxter]] and [[Joseph Brooks (politician)|Joseph Brooks]]. Massive fraud characterized the election, but Baxter was declared the winner and took office. Brooks never gave up; finally, in 1874, a local judge ruled Brooks was entitled to the office and swore him in. Both sides mobilized militia units, and rioting and fighting bloodied the streets. Speculation swirled as to who President Grant would side with \u2013 either Baxter or Brooks. Grant delayed, requesting a joint session of the Arkansas government to figure out peacefully who would be the Governor, but Baxter refused to participate. On May 15, 1874, Grant issued a Proclamation that Baxter was the legitimate Governor of Arkansas, and hostilities ceased.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">Johnson (1908), pp. 122\u2013168.</ref><ref>Woodward 1971, pp. 315\u2013336.</ref> In the fall of 1874 the people of Arkansas voted out Baxter, and Republicans and the [[Redeemers]] came to power.\n\nA few months later in early 1875, Grant announced that Brooks had been legitimately elected back in 1872. Grant did not send in troops, and Brooks never regained office. Instead, Grant appointed him to the high-paying patronage job of US postmaster in Little Rock.  Grant's legalistic approach Did resolve the conflict peacefully, but it left the Republican Party in Arkansas in total disarray, and further discredited grants reputation.<ref>Charles W.

They promised to lower city spending and taxes. Despite such intentions, the reform movement turned racist when the new White city officials went after the county government, which had a majority of African Americans. The White League threatened the life of and expelled Crosby, the black [[Warren County, Mississippi|Warren County]] Sheriff and tax collector. Crosby sought help from Republican Governor [[Adelbert Ames]] to regain his position as sheriff. Governor Ames told him to take other African Americans and use force to retain his lawful position. At that time Vicksburg had a population of 12,443, more than half of whom were African American.<ref name=\"Rhodes7\u20131\">Rhodes (1906), v. 7, pp. 167\u2013168.</ref>\n\nOn December 7, 1874, Crosby and an African-American militia approached Vicksburg. He had said that the Whites were, \"ruffians, barbarians, and political [[banditti]]\".<ref name=\"Rhodes7\u20131\" /> A series of confrontations occurred against white paramilitary forces that resulted in the deaths of 29 African Americans and 2 Whites. The White militia retained control of the County Court House and jail.\n\nOn December 21, Grant issued a Presidential Proclamation for the people in Vicksburg to stop fighting. General [[Philip Sheridan]], based in Louisiana for this regional territory, dispatched federal troops, who reinstated Crosby as sheriff and restored the peace. When questioned about the matter, Governor Ames denied that he had told Crosby to use African-American militia. On June 7, 1875, Crosby was shot to death by a white deputy while drinking in a bar. The origins of the shooting remained a mystery.<ref name=\"Rhodes7\u20131\" />\n[[File:JamesLongstreet.jpg|thumb|150px|Former Confederate General [[James Longstreet|James A.

Kellogg]] was forced to flee. Former Confederate General [[James Longstreet|James A. Longstreet]], with 3,000 [[African American]] militia and 400 Metropolitan police, made a counterattack on the 8,000 White League troops. Consisting of former Confederate soldiers, the experienced White League troops routed Longstreet's army. On September 17, Grant sent in Federal troops, and they restored the government back to Kellogg. During the following controversial election in November, passions rose high, and violence mixed with fraud were rampant; the state of affairs in New Orleans was becoming out of control. The results were that 53 Republicans and 53 Democrats were elected with 5 remaining seats to be decided by the legislature.<ref name=\"Hutton 2009 262\u2013266\">Hutton 2009, pp. 262\u2013266.</ref><ref>Zuczek 2006, p. 413.</ref>\n\nGrant had been careful to watch the elections and secretly sent [[Phil Sheridan]] in to keep law and order in the state. Sheridan had arrived in New Orleans a few days before the January 4, 1875, legislature opening meeting. At the convention the Democrats again with military force took control of the state building out of Republican hands. Initially, the Democrats were protected by federal troops under Colonel [[R\u00e9gis de Trobriand]], and the escaped Republicans were removed from the hallways of the state building. However, Governor Kellogg then requested that Trobriand reseat the Republicans. Trobriand returned to the Statehouse and used bayonets to force the Democrats out of the building. The Republicans then organized their own house with their own speakers all being protected by the Federal Army. Sheridan, who had annexed the Department of the Gulf to his command at 9:00 P.M., claimed that the federal troops were being neutral since they had also protected the Democrats earlier.<ref name=\"Hutton 2009 262\u2013266\"/>\n\n====South Carolina 1876====\n{{further|South Carolina gubernatorial election, 1876}}\n\n[[File:Wade Hampton III - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|150px|Former Confederate officer [[Wade Hampton III]] was supported by the terrorist group [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] in the 1876 Governor's election in South Carolina.]]\nDuring the election year of 1876, South Carolina was in a state of rebellion against Republican governor [[Daniel Henry Chamberlain|Daniel H. Chamberlain]]. Conservatives were determined to win the election for ex-Confederate [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] through violence and intimidation. The Republicans went on to nominate Chamberlain for a second term. Hampton supporters, donning red shirts, disrupted Republican meetings with gun shootings and yelling. Tensions became violent on July 8, 1876, when five African Americans were murdered at [[Hamburg, South Carolina|Hamburg]]. The rifle clubs, wearing their [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], were better armed than the blacks. South Carolina was ruled more by \"mobocracy and bloodshed\" than by Chamberlain's government.<ref name=\"Zuczek 1996 159\u2013165,170\u2013172,174,176\">Zuczek 1996, pp. 159\u2013165, 170\u2013172, 174, 176.</ref>\n\nBlack militia fought back in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]] on September 6, 1876, in what was known as the \"King Street riot\". The white militia assumed defensive positions out of concern over possible intervention from federal troops. Then, on September 19, the Red Shirts took offensive action by openly killing between 30 and 50 African Americans outside [[Ellenton, South Carolina|Ellenton]]. During the massacre, state representative Simon Coker was killed. On October 7, Governor Chamberlain declared martial law and told all the \"rifle club\" members to put down their weapons. In the meantime, Wade Hampton never ceased to remind Chamberlain that he did not rule South Carolina. Out of desperation, Chamberlain wrote to Grant and asked for federal intervention. The \"Cainhoy riot\" took place on October 15 when Republicans held a rally at \"Brick Church\" outside [[Cainhoy]]. Blacks and whites both opened fire; six whites and one black were killed. Grant, upset over the Ellenton and Cainhoy riots, finally declared a Presidential Proclamation on October 17, 1876 and ordered all persons, within 3 days, to cease their lawless activities and disperse to their homes. A total of 1,144 federal infantrymen were sent into South Carolina, and the violence stopped; election day was quiet. Both Hampton and Chamberlain claimed victory, and for a while both acted as governor; Hampton took the office in 1877 after President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] withdrew federal troops and after Chamberlain left the state.<ref name=\"Zuczek 1996 159\u2013165,170\u2013172,174,176\"/>\n\n===Domestic affairs===\n\n====Religion and schools====\n{{Main|Blaine Amendment}}\n\nGrant believed strongly in the separation of church and state and championed complete [[secularization]] in public schools. In a September 1875 speech, Grant advocated \"security of [[free thought]], [[free speech]], and [[Freedom of the press|free press]], pure morals, unfettered religious sentiments, and of equal rights and privileges to all men, irrespective of nationality, color, or religion.\" In regard to public education, Grant endorsed that every child should receive \"the opportunity of a good common school education, unmixed with sectarian, pagan, or atheist tenets.

Blaine]] (1830-1893) proposed the amendment to the federal Constitution. Blaine, who actively sought Catholic votes when he ran for president in 1884, believed that possibility of hurtful agitation on the school question should be ended. In 1875, the proposed amendment passed by a vote of 180 to 7 in the House of Representatives, but failed by four votes to achieve the necessary two-thirds vote in the Senate. Nothing like it ever became federal legislation. However many states did adopt similar amendments to their state constitution.<ref>{{cite book|author=Steven Green |title=The Second Disestablishment: Church and State in Nineteenth-Century America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_KP0kQC4XIC&pg=PA296|year=2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=296|isbn=9780199741595}}</ref>\n\nThe proposed Blaine Amendment text was:\n{{quote|No State shall make any law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; and no money raised by taxation in any State for the support of public schools, or derived from any public fund therefor, nor any public lands devoted thereto, shall ever be under the control of any religious sect; nor shall any money so raised or lands so devoted be divided between religious sects or denominations.}}\n\n====Civil Rights Act of 1875====\n{{Further|Civil Rights Act of 1875}}\nThroughout his presidency, Grant was continually concerned with the civil rights of all Americans, \"irrespective of nationality, color, or religion.\"<ref name=1875Reyes>{{cite book |last=Reyes |first=E.

Running for president in 1868 Grant publicly apologized for it.Once elected he set out to make amends.  He appointed several Jewish leaders to office, including [[Simon Wolf]] recorder of deeds in Washington D.C., and [[Edward S. Salomon]] Governor of the [[Washington Territory]].{{sfn|White|2016|pp=494\u2013495}}  Historian [[Jonathan Sarna]] argues:\n\n<blockquote>Eager to prove that he was above prejudice, Grant appointed more Jews to public office than had any of his predecessors and, in the name of human rights, he extended unprecedented support to persecuted Jews in Russia and Romania. Time and again, partly as a result of this enlarged vision of what it meant to be an American and partly in order to live down General Orders No. 11, Grant consciously worked to assist Jews and secure them equality.&nbsp;... Through his appointments and policies, Grant rejected calls for a 'Christian nation' and embraced Jews as insiders in America, part of 'we the people.' During his administration, Jews achieved heightened status on the national scene, anti-Jewish prejudice declined, and Jews looked forward optimistically to a liberal epoch characterized by sensitivity to human rights and interreligious cooperation.<ref>Sarna, ''When General Grant Expelled the Jews'' (2012), Introduction</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Native American affairs===\n{{main|Native American policy of the Ulysses S. Grant administration}}\nUnder Grant's ''Peace'' policy, wars between settlers, the federal army, and the American Indians had been decreasing from 101 per year in 1869 to a low of 15 per year in 1875.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=362}} However, the discovery of gold in the Black Hills of the [[Dakota Territory]] and the completion of the [[Northern Pacific Railway]], threatened to unravel Grant's Indian policy, as white settlers encroached upon native land to mine for gold.{{sfn|Smith|2001|p=538}}\n\nIn his second term of presidential office, Grant's fragile ''Peace'' policy came apart. Major General [[Edward Canby]] was killed in the [[Modoc War]]. Indian wars per year jumped up to 32 in 1876 and remained at 43 in 1877.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=362}} One of the highest casualty Indian battles that took place in American history was at the [[Battle of Little Bighorn]] in 1876.{{sfn|Michno|2003|pp=295\u201396, 363}} Indian war casualties in Montana went from 5 in 1875, to 613 in 1876 and 436 in 1877.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=368}}\n\n====Modoc War====\n{{further|Modoc War}}\nIn January 1873, Grant's Native American peace policy was challenged. Two weeks after Grant was elected for a second term, fighting broke out between the [[Modocs]] and settlers near the California-Oregon border. The Modocs, led by [[Captain Jack (Native American)|Captain Jack]], killed 18 white settlers and then found a strong defensive position. Grant ordered General Sherman not to attack the Indians but settle matters peacefully with a commission. Sherman then sent Major General [[Edward Canby]], but Captain Jack killed him. Reverend Eleazar Thomas, a Methodist minister, was also killed. [[Alfred B. Meacham]], an Indian Agent, was severely wounded. The murders shocked the nation, and Sherman wired to have the Modocs exterminated. Grant overruled Sherman; Captain Jack was executed, and the remaining 155 Modocs were relocated to the [[Quapaw Agency]] in the [[Indian Territory]]. This episode and the [[Great Sioux War]] undermined public confidence in Grant's peace policy, according to historian [[Robert M. Utley]].<ref>Utley 1984b, p. 206.</ref>{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=534\u201336}} During the peace negotiations between Brig. Gen. [[Edward Canby]] and the Modoc tribal leaders, there were more Indians in the tent then had been agreed upon. As the Indians grew more hostile, Captain Jack, said \"I talk no more.\" and shouted \"All ready.\" Captain Jack drew his revolver and fired directly into the head of Gen Canby. Brig. Gen Canby was the highest-ranking officer to be killed during the Indian Wars that took place from 1850 to 1890. Alfred Meacham, who survived the massacre, defended the Modocs who were put on trial.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=265}}\n\n====Red River War====\n{{main|Red River War}}\nIn 1874, war erupted on the southern Plains when [[Quanah Parker]], leader of the [[Comanche]], led 700 tribal warriors and attacked the buffalo hunter supply base on the Canadian River, at [[Adobe Walls, Texas]]. The Army under General [[Phil Sheridan]] launched a military campaign, and, with few casualties on either side, forced the Indians back to their reservations by destroying their horses and winter food supplies. Grant, who agreed to the Army plan advocated by Generals [[William T. Sherman]] and Phil Sheridan, imprisoned 74 insurgents in Florida.<ref>Smith (2001), ''Grant'', pp. 536\u2013538;</ref>\n\n====Great Sioux War====\n{{main|Great Sioux War|Battle of Little Big Horn}}\nIn 1874 gold had been discovered in the [[Black Hills]] in the [[Dakota Territory]]. White speculators and settlers rushed in droves seeking riches mining gold on land reserved for the [[Sioux]] tribe by the [[Treaty of Fort Laramie (1868)|Treaty of Fort Laramie]] of 1868. In 1875, to avoid conflict Grant met with [[Red Cloud]], chief of the Sioux and offered $25,000 from the government to purchase the land. The offer was declined. On November 3, 1875 at a White House meeting, [[Phil Sheridan]] told the President that the Army was overstretched and could not defend the Sioux tribe from the settlers; Grant ordered Sheridan to round up the Sioux and put them on the reservation. Sheridan used a strategy of convergence, using Army columns to force the Sioux onto the reservation. On June 25, 1876, one of these columns, led by Colonel [[George A. Custer]] met the Sioux at the Battle of Little Big Horn and part of his command was slaughtered. Approximately 253 federal soldiers and civilians were killed compared to 40 Indians.{{sfn|Michno|2003|p=296}} Custer's death and the Battle of Little Big Horn shocked the nation. Sheridan avenged Custer, pacified the northern Plains, and put the defeated Sioux on the reservation.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=538\u201340}} On August 15, 1876, President Grant signed a proviso giving the Sioux nation $1,000,000 in rations, while the Sioux relinquished all rights to the Black Hills, except for a 40-mile land tract west of the 103rd meridian. On August 28, a seven-man committee, appointed by Grant, gave additional harsh stipulations for the Sioux in order to receive government assistance. [[Halfbreeds]] and \"squaw men\" (A white man with an Indian wife) were banished from the Sioux reservation. To receive the government rations, the Indians had to work the land. Reluctantly, on September 20, the Indian leaders, whose people were starving, agreed to the committee's demands and signed the agreement.<ref>[[#Gray|Gray]] (1976), pp. 260\u2013263</ref>\n\nDuring the Great Sioux War, Grant came into conflict with Col. [[George Armstrong Custer]] after he testified in 1876 about corruption in the War Department under Secretary [[William W. Belknap]] (see below).{{sfn|Donovan|2008|pp=110\u2013111}} Grant had Custer arrested for breach of military protocol in Chicago and barred him from leading an upcoming campaign against the Sioux.{{sfn|Donovan|2008|p=112}} Grant finally relented and let Custer fight under Brig. Gen.

Financial debt, however, particularly in railroad investment, spread throughout both the private and federal sectors. {{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=419}} The market began to break in July 1873 when the Brookyn Trust Company went broke and closed. Secretary Richardson sold gold to pay for $14 million in federal bonds.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=420}} Two months later, the [[Panic of 1873]], collapsed the national economy. On September 17, the stock market crashed, followed by the New York Warehouse & Security Company, September 18, and the [[Jay Cooke & Company]], September 19, both going bankrupt. On September 19, Grant ordered Secretary [[William Adams Richardson|Richardson]], Boutwell's replacement, to purchase $10 million in bonds. Richardson complied using greenbacks to expand the money supply. On September 20, the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (''NYSE'') closed for ten days. Traveling to New York, Grant met with Richardson to consult with bankers, who gave Grant conflicting financial advice.{{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=421}}\n\nReturning to Washington, Grant and Richardson sent millions of greenbacks from the treasury to New York to purchase bonds, stopping the purchases on September 24. By the beginning of January 1874, Richardson had issued a total of $26 million greenbacks from the Treasury reserve, into the economy, relieving Wall Street, but not stopping the national [[Long Depression]], that would last 5 years. Thousands of businesses, depressed daily wages by 25% for three years, and brought the unemployment rate up to 14%.{{sfnm|Smith|2001|1pp=575\u201382|Chernow|2017|2pp=419-420|McFeely|1981|3p=394}}{{sfn|Oberholzer|1922|loc=3:79\u2013122}}{{sfn|Unger|1964|loc=ch. 8}}{{sfn|Unger|1964|loc=ch. 9}}\n\n====Inflation bill vetoed and compromise====\n[[File:Grant Inflation Bill Veto.jpg|thumb|Political cartoon by Thomas Nast: Grant congratulated for vetoing the \"inflation bill\" on April 22, 1874]]\nGrant and Richardson's mildly inflationary response to the Panic of 1873, encouraged Congress to pursue a more aggressive policy. The legality of releasing greenbacks was presumed to have been illegal. On April 14, 1874, Congress passed the ''Inflation Bill'' that set the greenback maximum at $400,000 retroactively legalizing the $26 million reserve greenbacks earlier released by the Treasury. The bill released an additional $18 million in [[United States Note|greenbacks]] up to the original $400,000,000 amount. Going further, the bill authorized an additional $46 million in banknotes and raised their maximum to $400 million.  {{sfn|Calhoun|2017|p=441}} Eastern bankers vigorously lobbied Grant to veto the bill because of their reliance on bonds and foreign investors who did business in gold. Most of Grant's cabinet favored the bill in order to secure a Republican election. Grant's conservative Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] threatened to resign if Grant signed the bill. On April 22, 1874, after evaluating his own reasons for wanting to sign the bill, Grant unexpectedly vetoed the bill against the popular election strategy of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] because he believed it would destroy the nation's credit.<ref>Rhodes 1906, ch. 7, pp. 126\u2013127; Nevins (1957), ''Hamilton Fish: The Inner History of the Grant Administration. Volume: 2'', pp. 706\u2013708 711\u2013714</ref>\n\nCongress passed a compromise bill, that Grant signed on June 20, 1874. The act legalized the $26 million released by Richardson, and set the maximum of greenbacks at $382 million. Up to $55 million in national banknotes would be redistributed from states with an excess to those states that had minimal amounts. The act did little to relieve the national economy. {{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=445-446}}\n\n====Resumption of Specie Act====\nOn January 14, 1875, Grant signed the Resumption of Specie Act, and he could not have been happier; he wrote a note to Congress congratulating members on the passage of the act. The legislation was drafted by Ohio Republican Senator [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]]. This act provided that paper money in circulation would be exchanged for gold specie and silver coins and would be effective January 1, 1879. The act also implemented that gradual steps would be taken to reduce the number of greenbacks in circulation. At that time there were \"paper coin\" currency worth less than $1.00, and these would be exchanged for silver coins. Its effect was to stabilize the currency and make the consumers money as \"good as gold\". In an age without a [[Federal Reserve]] system to control inflation, this act stabilized the economy. Grant considered it the hallmark of his administration.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=581\u201382}}{{sfn|Unger|1964|loc=ch. 11}}\n\n===Foreign affairs===\n{{further |Hamilton Fish}}\nHistorians credit Secretary of State [[Hamilton Fish]] with a highly effective foreign policy.

After a hasty trial, the local Spanish officials executed 53 would-be insurgents, eight of whom were United States citizens; orders from Madrid to delay the executions arrived too late. War scares erupted in both the U.S. and Spain, heightened by the bellicose dispatches from the American minister in Madrid, retired general [[Daniel Sickles]]. Secretary of State Fish kept a cool demeanor in the crisis, and through investigation discovered there was a question over whether the ''Virginius'' ship had the right to bear the United States flag. The Spanish Republic's president [[Emilio Castelar]] expressed profound regret for the tragedy and was willing to make reparations through arbitration. Fish negotiated reparations with the Spanish minister Senor Poly y Bernabe. With Grant's approval, Spain was to surrender ''Virginius'', pay an indemnity to the surviving families of the Americans executed, and salute the American flag; the episode ended quietly.<ref>Bradford 1980.</ref>\n\n====Hawaiian free trade treaty====\nIn December 1874, Grant held a state dinner at the White House for the King of Hawaii, [[David Kalakaua]], who was seeking the importation of Hawaiian sugar duty-free to the United States.{{sfn|Kreiser|p=19}} Grant and Fish were able to produce a successful [[free trade treaty]] in 1875 with the [[Kingdom of Hawaii]], incorporating the Pacific islands' sugar industry into the United States' economy sphere.{{sfn|Kreiser|p=19}}\n\n====Liberian-Grebo war====\nThe U.S. settled the war between [[Liberia]] and the native [[Grebo people]] in 1876 by dispatching the {{USS|Alaska|1868|6}} to Liberia. [[James Milton Turner]], the first African American ambassador from the United States, requested that a warship be sent to protect American property in Liberia, a former American colony.

The Democratic Party held the Republican Party responsible for the [[Long Depression]]. The Republicans were divided on the currency issue. Grant, who with hard money North Eastern Republicans, vetoed an inflation bill. Grant was blamed for the nation's problems, while he was accused of wanting a third term.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=462-463}} Grant never officially campaigned, but traveled West, to emphasize his relatively popular Indian policy.{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=463-465}}\n\nThe October elections, swept the Republicans from office, and was a repudation of Grant's veto. {{sfn|Chernow|2017|p=783}} In Indiana and Ohio, the Republicans suffered losses, caused by a breakaway Republican [[temperance movement]].{{sfn|Calhoun|2017|pp=463-465}} The Democratic Party won the New York governorship to Democrat [[Samuel Tilden]].

Six Republican office holders were murdered in [[Coushatta, Louisiana]]. On September 14, General Longstreet, police, and black militia fought 3,500 White Leaguers who attempted to capture the statehouse in New Orleans, that ended with 32 people killed.  Grant issued a dispersal proclamation, the next day, and sent 5,000 troops and 5 gunboats to [[New Orleans]]. The [[White League]] resistance collapsed.

Grant presidential administration reforms|Ulysses S. Grant presidential administration scandals}}\nScandals and frauds continued to be exposed during Grant's second term in office, although Grant's appointments of reformers to his cabinet temporarily helped his presidential reputation, cleaned up federal departments, and defeated the notorious [[Whiskey Ring]]. Grant, however, often remained loyal to cabinet members or appointees involved in corruption or mismanagement, refusing to believe in their guilt. The Democrats along with the Liberal Republicans had gained control of the House of Representatives and held many Committee meetings to stop political graft. The Emma Silver mine was a minor embarrassment associated with American Ambassador to Britain, [[Robert C. Schenck]], using his name to promote a worked out silver mine. The Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal's origins were during the presidential Administrations of Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson; however, political congressional infighting during the Grant Administration exposed the scandal.<ref name=\"Rives\">Rives 2000.</ref>\n\n====Sanborn contracts====\n{{further|Sanborn incident}}\n\nIn June 1874, Treasury Secretary [[William Adams Richardson|William A. Richardson]] gave private contracts to one John D. Sanborn who in turn collected illegally withheld taxes for fees at inflated commissions. The profits from the commissions were allegedly split with Richardson and Senator [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]], while Sanborn claimed these payments were \"expenses\". Senator Butler had written a loophole in the law that allowed Sanborn to collect the commissions, but Sanborn would not reveal whom he split the profits with.{{sfn|Hinsdale|1911|p=212\u201413}}\n\n====Pratt & Boyd====\nIn April 1875, it was discovered that Attorney General [[George Henry Williams|George H. Williams]] allegedly received a bribe through a $30,000 gift to his wife from a Merchant house company, Pratt & Boyd, to drop the case for fraudulent customhouse entries. Williams was forced to resign by Grant in 1875.{{sfn|Smith|2001}}\n\n====Delano's Department of Interior ====\nBy 1875, the Department of the Interior under Secretary of Interior [[Columbus Delano]] was in serious disrepair with corruption and fraud. Profiteering prevailed in the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], controlled by corrupt clerks and bogus agents. This proved to be the most serious detriment to Grant's Indian peace policy. Many agents that worked for the department made unscrupulous fortunes and retired with more money than their pay would allow at the expense and exploitation of [[Native Americans of the United States|Native Americans]]. Delano had allowed \"Indian Attorneys\" who were paid by Native American tribes $8.00 a day plus food and travel expenses for sham representation in Washington. Delano exempted his department from Grant's civil service reform implementation in federal offices. Delano told Grant the Interior Department was too large to implement civil service reform.\n\nDelano's son, John Delano, and Ulysses S. Grant's own brother, Orvil Grant, were discovered to have been awarded lucrative corrupt cartographical contracts by Surveyor General Silas Reed. Neither John Delano nor Orvil Grant performed any work or were qualified to hold such surveying positions. Massive fraud was also found in the Patent Office with corrupt clerks who embezzled from the government payroll.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Ulysses Simpson Grant |editor=John Y.

Grant then appointed [[Zachariah Chandler]] as Secretary of the Interior who replaced Delano. Chandler vigorously uncovered and cleaned up the fraud in the department by firing all the clerks and banned the phony \"Indian Attorneys\" access to Washington.

Bristow]] discovered that millions of dollars of taxes were being funneled into an illegal ring from whiskey manufacturers. Prosecutions ensued, and many were put in prison. Grant's private Secretary [[Orville E. Babcock]] was indicted and later acquitted in trial.<ref>Rhodes 1906, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0cMTAAAAYAAJ&pg=RA1-PA182&dq=Benjamin+Bristow#v=onepage&q=Benjamin%20Bristow&f=false p. 187].</ref> Grant's new Attorney General [[Edwards Pierrepont]] and Bristow formed an anti-corruption team to weed out criminal activity during Grant's second term. The Whiskey Ring was organized throughout the United States, and by 1875 it was a fully operating criminal association. The investigation and closure of the Whiskey Ring resulted in 230 indictments, 110 convictions, and $3,000,000 in tax revenues that were returned to the Treasury Department. Bristow and Pierrpont brought evidence to Grant of Babcock's involvement. Grant asked Babcock with Bristow and Pierrepont in attendance at the White House about the evidence. Babcock gave Grant an explanation that the evidence did not concern the Ring, and Grant quietly accepted Babcock's words at face value. During the prosecution of the Whiskey Ring leaders, Grant testified on behalf of his friend Babcock. As a result, Babcock was acquitted. However, the deposition by Grant was a great embarrassment to his reputation. The Babcock trial turned into an impeachment trial against the President by Grant's political opponents.{{sfn|McFeely|2002|pp=406\u201316}}<ref>Garland 1898, p. 438.</ref>\n\n====Trading post ring====\n{{main|Trader post scandal}}\n\nIn March 1876 it was discovered under House investigations that Secretary of War [[William W. Belknap]] was taking extortion money in exchange for allowing an Indian trading post agent to remain in position at [[Fort Sill]]. Belknap was allowed to resign by Grant and as a result, was acquitted in a Senate impeachment trial. Profits were made at the expense of Native Americans who were supposed to receive food and clothing from the government.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=593\u201396}} In late April 1876, Grant lashed out at Lieut. Col. [[George A. Custer]], after Custer had testified at a Congressional committee one month before against Grant's brother Orville and Sec. Belknap.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} There had been rumors Custer had talked with the press concerning the Indian post profiteering.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} Custer personally went to the White House to clear matters up with the President. However, Grant refused to see him three times. When Custer left Washington on May 3 to return to Fort Lincoln, he had been removed from overall command by Grant and denied any participation of the [[Great Sioux War|Sioux Campaign]]; having been replaced by Brig. Gen. [[Alfred Terry]]. However, at Terry's insistence, Grant relented and allowed Custer to participate in the campaign against the Sioux on the condition he did not take any pressmen.<ref>[[#Gray|Gray]] (1976), pp. 67\u201371</ref>\n\n====Cattellism====\nIn March 1876, Secretary of Navy [[George M. Robeson]] was charged by a Democratic-controlled House investigation committee with giving lucrative contracts to Alexander Cattell & Company, a grain supplier, in return for real estate, loans, and payment of debts.<ref>Kennedy 2001.</ref> The House investigating committee also discovered that Secretary Robeson had allegedly embezzled $15&nbsp;million in naval construction appropriations.<ref>Muench 2006, p. 74.</ref> Since there were no financial paper trails or enough evidence for impeachment and conviction, the House Investigation committee admonished Robeson and claimed he had set up a corrupt contracting system known as \"Cattellism\".{{sfn|McFeely |2002|p=432}}\n\n====Safe burglary conspiracy====\nIn September 1876, [[Orville E. Babcock]], Superintendent of Public Works and Buildings, was indicted in a safe [[burglary]] [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] case and trial. In April, corrupt building contractors in Washington, D.C. were on trial for graft when a safe robbery occurred. Bogus secret service agents broke into a safe and attempted to frame Columbus Alexander, who had exposed the corrupt contracting ring. Babcock was named as part of the conspiracy, but later [[acquitted]] in the trial against the burglars. Evidence suggests that Backcock was involved with the [[Confidence trick|swindles]] by the corrupt Washington Contractors Ring and he wanted revenge on Columbus Alexander, an avid reformer and critic of the Grant Administration. There was also evidence that safe burglary jury had been tampered with.<ref name=\"The New York Times 1876\">''The New York Times'' 1876</ref><ref name=\"The New York Times 1876\"/>\n\n===Election of 1876===\nIn the [[1876 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1876]], the Republicans nominated the fiscally conservative [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] and the Democrats nominated reformer [[Samuel Tilden]]. Results were split. Tilden received 51% of the popular vote; Hayes 48%; many black Republicans were not allowed to vote, however. Twenty key electoral votes remained undecided and in dispute. Both Republicans and Democrats claimed victory and the threat of a second civil war was eminent. Grant was watchful; encouraged Congress to settle the election by commission; and determined to keep a peaceful transfer of power. On January 29, 1877, Grant signed the [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission Act]] that gave a 15-member bipartisan commission power to determine electoral votes. The commission gave Hayes 185 electoral votes; Tilden received 184. Grant's personal honesty, firmness, and even-handedness reassured the nation and a second civil war was averted.{{sfn|Smith|2001|pp=596\u2013605}}<ref>Paul Leland Haworth, ''The Hayes-Tilden disputed presidential election of 1876'' (1906).

Grant administration}}\n\nGrant's presidency has traditionally been viewed by historians as incompetent and full of corruption. An examination of his presidency reveals Grant had both successes and failures during his two terms in office. In recent years historians have elevated his presidential rating because of his support for [[African American]] civil rights. Grant had urged the passing of the 15th Amendment and signed into law the Civil Rights Bill of 1875 that gave all citizens access to places of public enterprise. He leaned heavily toward the Radical camp and often sided with their Reconstruction policies, signing into law Force Acts to prosecute the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. In foreign policy Grant won praise for the Treaty of Washington, settling the [[Alabama Claims]] issue with Britain through [[International Arbitration|arbitration]]. Economically he sided with Eastern bankers and signed the Public Credit Act that paid U.S. debts in gold specie, but was blamed for the severe economic depression that lasted 1873\u20131877.<ref>C-SPAN 2009 Historians Presidential Leadership Survey</ref> Grant, wary of powerful congressional leaders, was the first president to ask for a [[line item veto|line item]] veto\u2014though Congress never allowed one.<ref>Weisburger, ''The Item And \"fight 'em\" Veto'', ''American Heritage'' (November, 1995),</ref>\n\nHis presidency was inundated with many scandals caused by low standards and carelessness with his political appointees and personal associates. [[Nepotism]], practiced by Grant, was unrestrained with almost forty family members or relatives who financially benefited from government appointments or employment.<ref name=\"Lawrence M. Salinger 2005 374\u2013375\"/> It was impossible for Grant to morally check all of the corruption generated from the socioeconomic forces of a costly [[American Civil War]], rapid industrialization, and Westward expansionism.<ref name=\"Woodward 1957\">Woodward 1957.</ref> His associations with these scandals have tarnished his personal reputation while president and afterward. Despite the scandals, by the end of Grant's second term the corruption in the Departments of Interior (1875), Treasury (1874), and Justice (1875) were cleaned up by his new cabinet members.<ref>Nevins 1957, p. 833.</ref>\n\nGrant's generous treatment of [[Robert E. Lee]] at [[Battle of Appomattox Courthouse|Appomattox]] helped give him popularity in the South. Although he kept civil rights on the political agenda, the Republican party at the end of Grant's second term shifted to pursuing conservative fiscal policies. His weak response to the Panic of 1873 hurt the economy and seriously damaged his party, which lost heavily in 1874. Grant's financial policies favored Wall Street, but his term ended with the nation mired in a deep economic depression that Grant could not comprehend or deal with.<ref>Simon 1997, pp. 258\u2013259.</ref> Revisionist historians during the first half of the twentieth century have tended to prop up a romantic view of the Confederacy and the [[Lost Cause]] at the expense of downgrading the Union cause and Grant's presidency as a corrupt despot.<ref name=\"Skidmorepp150\u2014151\">Skidmore, pp. 150\u2013151</ref>\nThe 20th-century historical views of Grant were less favorable. Political analyst [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]] noted in 1998 that, \"Ulysses S. Grant is universally ranked among the greatest American generals, and his Memoirs are widely considered to belong with the best military autobiographies ever written. But he is inevitably named, by conservatives as well as liberals, as one of the worst presidents in American history.\"<ref name=Better>Michael Barone, [http://www.weeklystandard.com/grant-and-the-historians/article/10329 \"A Better President Than They Think\"], ''The Weekly Standard'' (August 3, 1998).</ref> Barone argues that: \"This consensus, however, is being challenged by writers outside the professional historians' guild.\" Barone points to a lawyer [[Frank Scaturro]], who led the movement to restore [[Grant's Tomb]] while only a college student, and in 1998 wrote the first book of the modern era which portrays Grant's presidency in a positive light.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scaturro|first=Frank|title=President Grant Reconsidered|year=1998|publisher=Madison Books|location=Lanham|isbn=1-56833-132-0}}</ref> Barone said that Scaturro's work was a \"convincing case that Grant was a strong and, in many important respects, successful president. It is an argument full of significance for how we see the course of American political history&nbsp;... Scaturro's work&nbsp;... should prompt a reassessment of the entire Progressive-New Deal Tradition.\"<ref name=Better/>\n\nIn the 21st Century, Grant's reputation and ranking had significantly increased, that followed a series of positive biographies written by noted historians, that included [[Jean Edward Smith]], ''Grant'',{{sfn|Smith|2001}} [[H.W.
