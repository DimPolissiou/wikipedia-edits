It starred [[Nicholas Hammond]] and was intended as a [[backdoor pilot]] for what became a weekly episodic TV series.\n\nThe rights to further films featuring the character were purchased in 1985, and moved through various production companies and studios before passing to [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] ([[Columbia Pictures]]).<ref name=sony/> Sony hired [[Sam Raimi]] to direct ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' (2002), ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'' (2004), and ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007) starring [[Tobey Maguire]]. The first two films were met with positive reviews from critics, while the third film received mixed reviews.\n\nIn 2010, Sony announced that the franchise would be [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]]. [[Marc Webb]] was hired to direct, with [[Andrew Garfield]] starring, and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (2012) was released to positive reviews. ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'' (2014) saw mixed reviews.\n\nIn February 2015, [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Marvel Studios]] and Sony announced a deal to share the Spider-Man film rights, leading to a new iteration of Spider-Man being introduced and integrated into the MCU. The deal allowed Sony to distribute and have final creative control over MCU films where Spider-Man is the main character, while Disney distributed the ones where he is not. [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]] portrays this younger version of Spider-Man, appearing in ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' (2016), ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019), and ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019). All of Spider-Man's MCU appearances received positive reviews. In September 2019 Disney and Sony announced a new agreement to enable a [[Spider-Man: Far From Home#Sequel|third MCU Spider-Man film]] set for release in July 2021, following earlier reports of a failure to agree on terms.\n\nPlans for an animated Spider-Man film were officially announced by Sony in April 2015. ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'' (2018) combines [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]]' computer animation pipeline with traditional hand-drawn comic book techniques, inspired by the work of [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]]'s co-creator [[Sara Pichelli]]. Completing the animation required up to 140 animators, the largest crew ever used by [[Sony Pictures Animation]] for a film. ''Into the Spider-Verse'' received universal acclaim, won the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]], and became the highest-rated film in the Spider-Man franchise, surpassing ''Spider-Man 2''.\n\nRaimi's trilogy grossed $2.5 billion worldwide on a $597 million budget, while Webb's films grossed over $1.4 billion on a $480 million budget. Spider-Man's MCU films (''Homecoming'' and ''Far From Home'') grossed over $2 billion on a $335 million budget and ''Into the Spider-Verse'' grossed $375 million on a $90 million budget. The ''Spider-Man'' films <!--When including ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' (2018), the ''Spider-Man'' films are the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest-grossing franchises and film series|6th highest-grossing film franchise]] of all time, having-->have grossed over $6.3 billion collectively at the global box office. This includes ''Far From Home'', which became the first ''Spider-Man'' film to gross over $1 billion worldwide as well as Sony's highest-grossing film ever.\n\nTom Holland is now considered as the best Spider-Man.

While on a science class field trip, Peter is bitten by a genetically-engineered \"super spider.\" As a result, Peter gains superhuman abilities, including increased strength, speed, and the abilities to scale walls and generate organic webbing. After his beloved [[Uncle Ben]] ([[Cliff Robertson]]) is murdered, the teenager realizes that he must use his newfound abilities to protect New York City. Meanwhile, wealthy industrialist [[Green Goblin in other media#Sam Raimi series|Norman Osborn]] ([[Willem Dafoe]]), the father of Peter's best friend [[Harry Osborn]] ([[James Franco]]), subjects himself to an experimental performance-enhancing serum, which creates a psychotic and murderous split personality. Donning a military battlesuit, Norman becomes a freakish \"Green Goblin\", who begins to terrorize the city. Peter, as Spider-Man, now must do battle with the Goblin, all while trying to express his true feelings for Mary Jane.\n\n===''Spider-Man 2'' (2004)===\n{{Main|Spider-Man 2}}\nTwo years after the events of the first film, Peter struggles to balance his superhero and private lives and still pines after [[Mary Jane Watson]], who is now engaged. [[Harry Osborn]] continues to believe Spider-Man is responsible for his father [[Norman Osborn]]'s death. Spider-Man contends with scientist [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]] ([[Alfred Molina]]), a.k.a. Dr. Octopus, who has four mechanical tentacles fused to his spine and sets out to recreate a fusion-based experiment that could destroy much of New York City.\n\n===''Spider-Man 3'' (2007)===\n{{Main|Spider-Man 3}}\n''Spider-Man 3'' picks up one year after the events of the second film. Peter is still seeing [[Mary Jane Watson]], while [[Harry Osborn]] succeeds his father as the new [[Harry Osborn#Green Goblin|Green Goblin]]. [[Eddie Brock]] ([[Topher Grace]]), who, like Peter, is a photographer for the ''Daily Bugle'', sets out to defame Spider-Man and incriminate him. [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Flint Marko]] ([[Thomas Haden Church]]), an escaped convict, falls into a particle accelerator and becomes a shape-shifting sand monster later known as Sandman. Peter later learns that Marko is the one that killed Uncle Ben, causing Peter's own dark intentions to grow. This vendetta is enhanced by the appearance of the mysterious black alien symbiotic substance that bonds to Peter, resulting in the formation of a new black costume. Once Peter separates himself from the alien, it finds a new host in the form of Brock, resulting in the creation of Venom.\n\n==Marc Webb films==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\"\n! scope=\"col\" width=10% | Film\n! scope=\"col\" | U.S. release date\n! scope=\"col\" | Director\n! scope=\"col\" | Screenwriters\n! scope=\"col\" | Story by\n! scope=\"col\" | Producers\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|{{small|The Amazing}}<br>Spider-Man]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2012|07|3}}\n| rowspan=\"2\"| [[Marc Webb]]\n| [[James Vanderbilt]], Alvin Sargent and [[Steve Kloves]]\n| James Vanderbilt\n| Laura Ziskin, Avi Arad and [[Matt Tolmach]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:left\" | ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2|{{small|The Amazing}}<br>Spider-Man 2]]''\n| style=\"text-align:left\" | {{Start date|2014|05|2}}\n| [[Alex Kurtzman]], [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Jeff Pinkner]]\n| Alex Kurtzman, Roberto Orci, Jeff Pinkner and James Vanderbilt\n| Avi Arad and Matt Tolmach\n|}\n\n===''The Amazing Spider-Man'' (2012)===\n{{Main|The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)}}\n[[File:The amazing Spider-Man.svg|thumbnail|400px|Marc Webb series logo used from 2012\u20132014]]\nSony announced that the franchise would be [[Reboot (fiction)|rebooted]] with a new director and new cast.
