It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], DeKnight Prods. and Goddard Textiles, with [[Steven S. DeKnight]] serving as [[showrunner]], and series creator [[Drew Goddard]] acting as consultant.\n\n[[Charlie Cox]] stars as Murdock, while [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] plays Fisk. They are joined by principal cast members [[Deborah Ann Woll]], [[Elden Henson]], [[Toby Leonard Moore]], [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]], [[Bob Gunton]], [[Ayelet Zurer]], and [[Rosario Dawson]]. ''Daredevil'' entered development in late 2013, with Goddard hired in December. DeKnight replaced him as showrunner and Cox was hired to star in May 2014. Filmed in New York City from July to December 2014, the season focuses on the darker, more mature elements of the source material. Stephanie Maslansky designed the costumes for the season, with the final red suit for Daredevil designed by Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists at [[Marvel Studios]]. The season features links and references to other MCU projects, including future Netflix series.\n\nThe first two episodes of the season premiered in Los Angeles on April 2, 2015, with the full season of 13 episodes released on [[Netflix]] on April 10 to an estimated high viewership. Critics praised the performances, particularly D'Onofrio's, and the darker tone and action sequences of the series compared to other properties set in the MCU. However, some of the pacing during the season and the final red Daredevil suit received criticism. The first season received two nominations for [[67th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards|Creative Emmy Awards]], for the visual effects from Shade VFX, and the sound editing. The series was renewed for a [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]] on April 21, 2015.<ref name=\"Season2Ordered\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#0A2252 |overall=7 |season=7 |title=25 |director=16 |writer=30 |airdate=15 |airdateR=<ref name=\"Futon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/marvels-daredevil/listings/ |title=Shows A-Z - marvel's daredevil on netflix |website=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Into the Ring\n |DirectedBy = [[Phil Abraham]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Drew Goddard]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = Criminals, including the [[Russian mafia]], [[Yakuza]], and [[Triad (organized crime)|Chinese mob]], have taken advantage of [[Hell's Kitchen]]'s circumstances since \"[[The Avengers (2012 film)#Plot|the incident]]\". Blinded as a boy in an accident that gave him heightened senses, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] begins fighting this rising criminal element by night as a costumed [[vigilante]] while opening a law firm with his friend, [[Foggy Nelson]]. Their first client is [[Karen Page]], a secretary for construction company Union Allied, who has been framed for the murder of her co-worker, Daniel Fisher, after accidentally uncovering a pension embezzlement scheme. Murdock prevents Karen from being prosecuted and protects her from an assassin, before exposing the scandal through [[Ben Urich]] at ''The New York Bulletin''. Grateful for their help, Page offers to work for Murdock and Nelson. [[Wesley (comics)|James Wesley]] covers up the involvement of his employer in the scandal, and orders Anatoly and Vladimir Ranskahov, the Russians' leaders, to deal with Murdock (\"the man in black\"): they kidnap a young boy to lure him into a trap.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Cut Man\n |DirectedBy = Phil Abraham\n |WrittenBy = Drew Goddard\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = When Murdock was a boy, his father was murdered by the Hell's Kitchen [[Irish Mob]] for winning a match he was told to [[Match fixing|throw]]. Now, after failing to rescue the kidnapped boy, a severely injured Murdock is found in a dumpster by nurse [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]]. Nelson meanwhile attempts to comfort Page following her recent traumatic experiences. Temple takes Murdock to her apartment, tends to his wounds, and removes his mask, discovering his blindness. He refuses to reveal his name, but does reveal his heightened senses when they alert him to a Russian who is searching the apartment building, giving Temple time to hide Murdock and convince the man that she knows nothing. Murdock realizes that the man did not believe her, and overpowers him, taking him to the roof. Murdock and Temple torture him into revealing the boy's location, before Murdock pushes him off the roof and into the same dumpster; Murdock says he will survive.

Though Nelson wishes not to get involved with an obvious criminal element, Murdock wishes to use the case to discover who Wesley's employer is, and so accepts Wesley's offer, which includes a substantial sum to ensure their silence. Page receives a similar offer from Union Allied, who do not want her to talk to anyone else about the scandal, and threaten to sue her for leaking company secrets to the press if she does not agree. Despite this, Page goes to Urich, whose editor Ellison is forcing him to write superfluous stories rather than the major crime breaks of his youth, and offers to tell him more about the Union Allied scandal. After successfully defending Healy, Murdock confronts him in costume and forces him to reveal Wesley's employer, [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]].

Wesley informs the Ranskahovs of an offer Fisk has made to help with their operations, given their recent failures. Angered at this apparent slight, they attempt to stop the man in black once and for all by visiting in hospital the Russian whom Murdock threw from the roof. After the Russian tells them of Temple, they send men to kidnap her, but she manages to call Murdock in time to alert him of her kidnapping. The Russians attempt to torture Murdock's name out of Temple, but Murdock arrives and defeats the gangsters. Seeing the aftermath of this, the Ranskahovs decide to agree to Fisk's offer, with Anatoly going to tell Fisk personally, by barging into the restaurant where Fisk is having dinner with an art gallery curator named [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Marianna]].

Elena Cardenas, a renter of powerful businessman Armand Tulley, comes to Nelson and Murdock after Tulley, who wants to convert her apartment building, sends men to wreck her home. Nelson goes to Tulley's lawyers at Landman and Zack (where he and Murdock once interned), represented by Marci Stahl, Nelson's ex-girlfriend. She explains that Cardenas and her neighbors can either take a large settlement or be evicted. While looking for complaints against Tulley at the police station, Murdock realizes Detectives Carl Hoffman and Christian Blake are corrupt when he hears them kill a Russian. Murdock later incapacitates Blake and uses his cell phone to find Vladimir. Fisk pays [[Turk Barrett]] to reveal to Vladimir that Fisk killed Anatoly, and as they prepare for a war against Fisk, their forces are destroyed in a [[suicide attack]] by Gao's workers.

The officer calls in Murdock and Vladimir's location, and the warehouse is soon surrounded. Blake and Hoffman take control of the situation, and await Fisk's orders. Fisk talks to Murdock via police radio, telling him of his admiration for what Murdock is trying to do, even though it clashes with Fisk's own plans to save the city. Fisk then frames the vigilante by having a police sniper fire on other officers from the roof of the warehouse, including Blake, as Urich and the media look on.

Now, he enlists Murdock's help in destroying Black Sky, a weapon that the Japanese, led by Nobu, are bringing to New York. Stick agrees to refrain from killing, but breaks his promise when he kills Black Sky, who is actually a young boy. After fighting in Murdock's apartment, Murdock defeats Stick, who agrees to leave the city. Urich, having agreed to help Page expose the further scandal and corruption surrounding Hell's Kitchen and Union Allied, explains that they need proof before they can publish anything. While searching for a connection between Tulley's men and Union Allied, Page is confronted by them. Nelson helps her escape them, so she and Urich explain their investigation to him.

Fisk convinces Hoffman to kill Blake before he can speak out against Fisk, but Hoffman is incapacitated by Murdock, who gets information on Fisk from Blake before he dies. Gao visits Fisk, warning him that he will have to get everything under control if he does not want her, Nobu, and Owlsley to side-step him. An angry Fisk is later consoled by Marianna, and he tells her of how, as a child, he murdered his father when he was beating Fisk's mother.

Murdock visits Marianna at her art gallery, hoping to gain insight into Fisk by speaking with her, and encounters Fisk himself. Nobu demands a promised city block from Fisk, who agrees on the condition Nobu provide him with a \"specialist\" in return to deal with the vigilante. The block, which Fisk has bought from Tulley, is where Cardenas lives, and she is one of the few tenants who stands in the way of Fisk gifting it to Nobu. When Cardenas is killed by a junkie, Murdock realizes that Fisk is behind it, and tracks him to an abandoned warehouse, where he is confronted by the specialist: Nobu. Murdock eventually defeats Nobu, accidentally causing him to burn alive, but sustains serious injuries. Fisk then confronts Murdock, beating him nearly to death.

He was succeeded by [[Steven S. DeKnight]]. Goddard, who wrote the first two episodes, remained with the show as a consultant and executive producer. It was also revealed that the series would be titled ''Marvel's Daredevil''.<ref name=\"GoddardDaredevilExit\" /> The first season consists of 13 hour-long episodes,<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> and DeKnight, Goddard, [[Jeph Loeb]], Jim Chory, [[Dan Buckley]], [[Joe Quesada]], [[Stan Lee]], [[Alan Fine (executive)|Alan Fine]], Cindy Holland, Kris Henigman, Allie Goss, and Peter Friedlander serve as executive producers.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe season does not directly adapt any one storyline from the comics, with DeKnight feeling that it was more important to focus on \"nailing the spirit of the comics\".<ref name=\"DeKnightGrislyScenes\" /> He stated that Netflix's support of \"the creatives\" coupled with Marvel's restrictions on their properties led to him pushing the source material as far as he could while remaining respectful of the characters and their history, and being surprised at \"how willing everyone is to take a really fresh look and really push what we\u2019re doing.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPaste\" /> [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] compared telling a story on Netflix to more of a \"13-hour film\" than a television series and noted that time can be taken to tell the story and \"be much more specific\".<ref name=\"D'OnofrioMar2015\" /> [[Deborah Ann Woll]] explained that what she saw as one of the most important themes in the series was normal people having an impact in \"seemingly insurmountable circumstances\", with the focus not being on Daredevil's abilities or the characters' qualifications, but on their willingness to help people.<ref name=\"IGNApr2015\" />\n\nThough the season was much more violent than previous MCU works, DeKnight felt that sexual violence would be \"too far\", saying that \"''Daredevil'' wasn\u2019t asking for a lot of sexual situations, especially since Matt Murdock is not really in the position to get into a relationship, and it just didn\u2019t fit the story for that season. I think that\u2019ll change moving forward, but I never pushed any kind of sexual agenda on the show. I think once ''Daredevil'' was a hit and people were really responding positively, you can see the progression into more of an adult world in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightGrislyScenes\" />\n\nSpeaking about the way the season reveals the name Daredevil, DeKnight explained that several options had been brought up, such as \"one of the versions in the comics where when he was a kid people used to taunt him with the name Daredevil\", which did not fit in the world of the series, or having [[Ben Urich]] give the character the name, but the timing for that did not work due to Urich's death before the final Daredevil suit was introduced. It was decided that instead of having the name Daredevil said onscreen, it would be easier to introduce it through the media as a newspaper headline. On why this was not done for Wilson Fisk as Kingpin, DeKnight stated that he felt it would \"get a little bit silly....[if] we went, 'Oh they called him Daredevil! Oh they called him Kingpin!',\" and was unable to come up with another natural way for the name Kingpin to come up, so it was decided to leave that for a later time.<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\n===Casting===\nThe main cast for the season includes [[Charlie Cox]] as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock / Daredevil]],<ref name=\"Cox\" /> [[Deborah Ann Woll]] as [[Karen Page]],<ref name=\"Woll\" /> [[Elden Henson]] as [[Foggy Nelson|Franklin \"Foggy\" Nelson]],<ref name=\"Henson\" /> [[Toby Leonard Moore]] as [[Wesley (comics)|James Wesley]],<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] as [[Ben Urich]],<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Bob Gunton]] as [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Leland Owlsley]],<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Ayelet Zurer]] as [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Marianna]],<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Claire Temple]],<ref name=\"DawsonCast\" /><ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /> [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]].<ref name=\"D'Onofrio\" /> \n\nIn July 2014, [[Peter Shinkoda]] was reported to have a recurring role in the season, portraying Hashiro.<ref name=\"Shinkoda\" /> In March 2015, this character was revealed to actually be Nobu Yoshioka, while recurring opponents for Daredevil \u2013 Madame Gao, Vladimir Ranskahov, and [[Turk Barrett]] \u2013 were also announced, portrayed by Wai Ching Ho, [[Nikolai Nikolaeff]], and [[Rob Morgan (actor)|Rob Morgan]].<ref name=\"EWMar2015Castings\" /><ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" /> Additionally, the following also recur throughout the season: Geoffrey Cantor as Mitchell Ellison;<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /><ref name=\"Cantor\" /> Judith Delgado as Elena Cardenas;<ref name=\"Delgado\" /> Daryl Edwards as Carl Hoffman;<ref name=\"EdwardsJohnson\" /> Royce Johnson as Brett Mahoney;<ref name=\"EdwardsJohnson\" /> [[Adriane Lenox]] as Doris Urich;<ref name=\"NerdistCast\" /> [[Peter McRobbie]] as [[Father Lantom|Father Paul Lantom]];<ref name=\"SRTrivia\" /> Amy Rutberg as Marci Stahl;<ref name=\"Rutberg\" /> Chris Tardio as Christian Blake;<ref name=\"Tardio\" /> Susan Varon as Josie;<ref name=\"NerdistCast\" /> and Tom Walker as Francis.<ref name=\"Walker\" />\n\n===Design===\n[[File:Charlie Cox as Daredevil in Marvel's Daredevil.gif|thumb|right|The two costumes worn by Cox in the season: first, his black \"vigilante outfit\";<ref name=\"IGNTrailer\" /> second, his red \"classic suit\".<ref name=\"IGNCostume\" />]]\nCostume designer Stephanie Maslansky read the first two episodes' scripts and some outlines of future scripts, and developed a \"solid understanding\" of the character arcs and overall story to begin the advanced planning needed for costume design. She also asked questions to prepare for character's stunt requirements and the building or retro-fitting of more complex costumes.<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" />\n\nMurdock begins the season wearing a black costume (called the \"vigilante outfit\" by production), inspired by the one worn by the character in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[List of Daredevil titles#One-shots and limited series|The Man Without Fear]]'', rather than the more traditional red, horned suit. This was done to highlight the formation of Matt Murdock as Daredevil, with the costume evolving over time as the character develops.<ref name=\"IGNTrailer\" /> Marvel Comics' [[Chief creative officer|Chief Creative Officer]] Quesada conceptualized the look based on DeKnight's specifications.<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" /> On the design process, DeKnight revealed that \"we tried practically everything, design-wise. We experimented with a lot of different head pieces. One version was a ski mask with the eyes sewn shut. We tried everything until we found something that just felt right.\"<ref name=\"IGNTrailer\" /> DeKnight and Quesada explained that the idea was for Murdock to start out with a homemade outfit that fits more in the \"real-world\" of the series, and to then evolve it into the classic Daredevil suit.<ref name=\"IGNCostume\" /> Maslansky noted that they wanted the outfit to \"look like something that Matt Murdock could put together himself, that he could either order off the Internet or shop around town....we wound up with pretty practical choices for him. His shirts are compression shirts and his pants wound up being from an army/navy store.\" Concerning the black mask, Maslansky noted that a balance between aesthetic and safety was required, and that it was made of layers of cotton mesh that \"really conform to his head\" but also allowed Cox to see through the mask.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\nOn the red suit, Maslansky said, \"We wanted something that looked militaristic and functional, but also dramatic and sexy\" adding that it was \"tricky\" making it practical.<ref name=\"IGNCostume\" /> To begin the process of creating the suit, Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked. Quesada, who previously worked as an artist on ''Daredevil'' comics, gave several suggestions, including the incorporation of some of how New York was created into the suit, which led to the use of rivets and \"architectural\" shapes. The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest, and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists highlighted certain areas with red, with \"deeper portions\" in shadow. On the mask, Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of a face that is intended to match the bottom half of an actor's face, \"because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actor\u2019s face is going to be doing something else\". For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by [[Andy Park (comics)|Andy Park]], discussions were had about having them holstered on the right leg, given that both Cox and his stunt double Chris Brewster are right handed, but it was ultimately decided to have the holster on the left hand side as it is in the \"classic profile\" of the comics.<ref name=\"MarvelSuit\" /> DeKnight explained that Murdock's Daredevil suit does not have the \"DD\" emblem on the chest as seen in the comics, because Murdock receives his moniker only after the suit is introduced. He also felt that the emblem was \"one of the more problematic emblems in superhero-dom\", and that Daredevil's suit in the comics was \"very difficult to translate to screen, especially in this world that is grounded and gritty\".<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\nMany of the male characters in the series are often seen wearing suits, which Maslansky was comfortable with after working as the costume designer on ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]''. Murdock's suits are differentiated more by texture than color, with a limited palette, given that the character cannot see what color his clothing is. Cox's size changed throughout the series as he continued to work out. For Murdock's sunglasses, Maslansky worked with series prop master Michael Jortner to make something that fit into the modern world, but paid homage to \"what was familiar to fans\". Close to 100 different versions of the prop were created for Cox to try. For the women of the series, Maslansky looked to their backstories in the show, with Page having dreams and fantasies of a life in New York along the lines of [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], and dressing according to those thoughts (\"retro, slim skirts, tighter fitting tops and slim dresses\"), while Marianna coming into the series as a mysterious yet glamorous [[femme fatale]], dressing in high-end, couture clothing; \"she needed to appeal to [Fisk]. He wouldn\u2019t go for just any chick in a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt.\"<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\n===Filming===\nIn February 2014, Marvel announced that ''Daredevil'' would be filmed in New York City.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> In April 2014, Quesada reiterated this, stating that the show would be filming in areas of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Long Island City]] that still look like the old [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell\u2019s Kitchen]], in addition to sound stage work.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> Loeb said that ''Daredevil'' would begin filming in July 2014,<ref name=\"JulyFilmingAnnounced\" /> and DeKnight confirmed that filming had started that month.<ref name=\"DeKnightJuly2014\" /> It filmed under the [[working title]] ''Bluff'',<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> on a $56 million budget. The production received $14.3 million under the New York Film & TV Tax Credit Program.<ref name=\"Budget\" /> Production concluded on December 21, 2014.<ref name=\"ProductionWrap\" /> Other filming locations in New York City included the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn|Greenpoint]] and [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]] neighborhoods in Brooklyn;<ref name=\"Brooklyn\" /><ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /> Abe Lebewohl Park in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]; Whitestone Lanes bowling alley in [[Flushing, Queens]]; the [[New York County Courthouse|New York State Supreme Court Building]], with the interior for court scenes filmed on a set; [[Brooklyn Borough Hall]]; the [[Rockefeller Center]] rooftop gardens; [[Brooklyn College]] for Murdock and Nelson's flashback to their time in college; the [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] neighborhood in Manhattan; and the Honeywell Bridge in Long Island City.<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" />\n\n\"Cut Man\" ends with a long action sequence filmed in a [[Long take|single take]]. DeKnight called it the \"most complicated action scene\" in the series, due to the technical difficulty in filming it, and credited Goddard, episodic director [[Phil Abraham]], stunt coordinator Philip J Silvera, and series cinematographer Matt Lloyd with realizing it.<ref name=\"ColliderApr2015\" /> He also named ''[[The Raid: Redemption|The Raid]]'' films as inspiration for the sequence.<ref name=\"RSApr2015\" /> There were only a few days to plan and set up the fight, as opposed to a film which would allow \"at least a couple of weeks\", and it took 7 or 8 takes to get the shot right. Silvera explained that the scene was always scripted to be a one-shot, and that he had intended to work around it with wipes, but Abraham challenged the team to do it all for real, which allowed the fight to feel more grounded by having them \"slow down the fight, and just have this raw, animalistic feeling happening.\" The final shot does include some 'Texas Switches' between actors and stunt doubles, but was ultimately filmed with no cuts.<ref name=\"Stunts\" />\n\nTalking about the scene where Fisk beheads Anatoly Ranskahov with a car door in \"In the Blood\", DeKnight noted that series like ''[[Spartacus (TV series)|Spartacus]]'' and ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' would have shown the head being crushed, which he felt was \"the right choice\" for them, but for ''Daredevil'' \"we did very much a ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' thing, we saw the aftereffects of it, but you never saw the car door crushing his head....Sound effects, absolutely. It\u2019s a very disturbing scene without crossing that line into a horror movie kind of deal.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightGrislyScenes\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects for the series were completed by the New York studio Shade VFX; ''Daredevil'' featured over 1000 visual effect shots.<ref name=\"ShadeVFX\" /><ref name=\"ShadeVFX2\" /> Executive visual effects supervisor Bryan Goswin explained that the company's work included the creation of digital doubles when stunts were not safe for actors or stunt doubles, as well as blood-hits and wounds, with \"a lot of support to the idea of the violence and gore that happens in Daredevil\" given to differentiate the series from other Marvel projects, and to try to set the series in a \"more realistic and dark place, the real streets of New York.\"<ref name=\"ShadeVFX3\" />\n\nOne shot created by Shade VFX is when the audience sees Matt Murdock's \"vision\" \u2013 the way that he \"sees\" using his other heightened senses. On why this was only used once in the season, DeKnight explained that it had in fact been budgeted to appear several more times, with the effect actually completed at least twice more for the season. It was removed for several reasons, including to avoid taking away the specialty of it, and to maintain the crime drama tone of the series. One instance where it would have been used again was in \"Stick\", where the audience would have seen how Murdock saw Stick as he threw keys at him, and then when he is older and Stick throws fighting sticks at him and his senses are more refined. In that case, the effect was not finished on time. Another instance was in \"The Ones We Leave Behind\" when Murdock comes across a Chinese worker and realizes that he has been blinded. The final use of the effect was going to be in \"Daredevil\" when the camera pushes in on Page's reaction Murdock telling her that they can work together. Here, the effect was hiding all of the nuances in her expression, so it was decided that it would be better to remove it.<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\n===Music===\nComposer [[John Paesano]] was brought on \"a couple of weeks in to post-production\", and scored an episode every four to five days. Paesano estimated that each episode has around 25\u201330 minutes of music in it. In approaching the series' score, Paesano looked to DeKnight, who \"had a very clear vision of what he wanted ... music you could feel and not necessarily hear.\" The result was a more [[minimalism|minimalist]] score than typical \"superhero\" music, although the music starts to \"change color\" and move closer to that of the MCU when the classic red costume is introduced. Most of the score was produced electronically, though live elements, such as a cello, were used where possible. Rather than \"keep the drive and the energy up\" with drums, Paesano elected to use a low pulsing heartbeat that was inline with the series' minimalist approach, and tied into the fact that Daredevil can hear people's heartbeats in the show.<ref name=\"PaesanoApr2015\" /> A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by [[Hollywood Records]] on April 27, 2015.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n\nAll music composed by John Paesano, unless otherwise noted.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = \n| total_length    = 41:45\n\n\n| title1          = Main Title\n| music1          = John Paesano & Braden Kimball\n| length1         = 1:04\n\n| title2          = Fogwell's Gym\n| length2         = 3:53\n\n| title3          = Battlin' Jack Murdock\n| length3         = 3:05\n\n| title4          = Hallway Fight\n| length4         = 4:26\n\n| title5          = Union Allied\n| length5         = 1:51\n\n| title6          = Passenger Side\n| length6         = 2:57\n\n| title7          = A World on Fire\n| length7         = 1:26\n\n| title8          = Ben Urich\n| length8         = 3:09\n\n| title9          = Stick\n| length9         = 2:11\n\n| title10         = Wilson Fisk\n| length10        = 4:38\n\n| title11         = Worthy Opponents\n| length11        = 2:28\n\n| title12         = Avocados at Law\n| length12        = 1:42\n\n| title13         = Man of Ill Intent\n| length13        = 3:45\n\n| title14         = The Suit\n| length14        = 5:43\n\n| title15         = Daredevil\n| length15        = 1:41\n}}\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nIn February 2015, Emma Fleisher of Marvel Television stated that ''Daredevil'' takes place in the aftermath of ''The Avengers'', but would not \"explicitly [be] in that ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' world. We're in our own corner [of the MCU]. So the [[Chitauri|aliens]] came down and ruined the city, and this is the story of Hell's Kitchen's rebuild.\"<ref name=\"CinemaBlend\" /> Connections to other MCU properties include the character of [[Absorbing Man|Carl \"Crusher\" Creel]], who appears in ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' portrayed by [[Brian Patrick Wade]], and is mentioned as having fought Jack Murdock in the latter's final boxing match;<ref name=\"IGN8Apr2015\" /> St. Agnes Orphanage, where both Matt Murdock and ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s [[Daisy Johnson|Skye]] are raised; the insignia on Madame Gao's heroin, which is a connection to the Iron Fist antagonist [[Steel Serpent]]; and mentions of [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]], a company featured throughout the MCU.<ref name=\"SRTrivia\" />\n\nThe final scene of \"Stick\", featuring a conversation between [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] and Stone, was meant to hint at further ties between the series and other areas of the MCU in the same way as Marvel's film [[post-credits scene]]s, though it could not actually go after the episode's credits due to the way that Netflix begins the next episode during the credits of the current one.<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" /> There were discussions about having another such \"coda\" at the end of the season finale, one which would have featured Leland Owlsley attempting to escape New York, only to be killed by the [[Punisher]] in a surprise introduction. The scene would not have shown the actor's face, but would have included the character's iconic skull insignia. The idea was dropped, again because of Netflix's playing system, and Owlsley was ultimately killed by Fisk in the episode, with the introduction of the Punisher saved for the series' [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]].<ref name=\"PunisherCoda\" />\n\n==Marketing==\nAt the October 2014 [[New York Comic Con]], footage from the series was shown.<ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /><ref name=\"NYCC20142\" /> In January 2015, a motion [[film poster]] was released to coincide with the revealing of the streaming date for the first season.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> The following month, on February 4, a teaser trailer was released.<ref name=\"VarietyTrailerUltraHD\" /> Merrill Barr of ''[[Forbes]]'' noted the dark tone of the trailer in a similar vein to [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and different from Marvel's [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#ABC series|ABC series]], but questioned the timing of the trailer debut after [[Super Bowl XLIX]], especially as the company did not air trailers during the event for ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' or ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' and could have benefited from introducing \"its latest and riskiest show\" to general audiences through it.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer\" /> In March 2015, an additional motion poster was released, which featured all major characters and [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] in the background of the poster, as well as the possible reveal of Murdock's red suit in his reflection.<ref name=\"MotionPoster\" /> In the lead up to the first-season premiere, a [[street marketing]] campaign appeared across the world in 12 cities with various artists creating murals.<ref name=\"Murals\" /> On April 2, 2015, the series had its premiere at the [[Regal Entertainment Group|Regal Premiere House]] at [[L.A. Live]]<ref name=\"LAPremiere\" /> where the first two episodes were previewed.<ref name=\"ForbesReview\" />\n\n==Release==\n===Streaming===\nThe first season of ''Daredevil'' was released on April 10, 2015 on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix, in all territories where it is available, in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]].<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"VarietyTrailerUltraHD\" /> On April 14, 2015, ''Daredevil'' was the first Netflix series to receive its [[Descriptive Video Service]] [[audio description]] track, \"a narration track that describes what is happening on-screen, including physical actions, facial expressions, costumes, settings and scene changes.\"<ref name=\"NetflixAudioDescription\" /> By April 16, episodes for the series had been [[Copyright infringement|pirated]] by 2.1 million individual users worldwide, according to Excipio, a piracy tracking firm, surpassed in that timeframe only by ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. The biggest countries for piracy were Brazil (190,274 torrent downloaders), India (149,316), the U.S. (144,351), the UK (119,891), France (105,473) and Australia (101,025). Except for India, Netflix was available in each of those countries at the time.<ref name=\"Piracy\" /> The season was enhanced to be available in [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] after its initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe season was released on [[DVD]] in [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] and [[Blu-ray]] in [[Blu-ray#B|Region B]] on October 3, 2016,<ref name=\"Region2HomeMedia\" /> in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] and [[Blu-ray#A|Region A]] on November 8, 2016,<ref name=\"Region1HomeMedia\" /> and in [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]] on December 7, 2016.<ref name=\"Region4HomeMedia\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Audience viewership===\nAs Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series, Luth Research compiled data for the season, based on a sample of 2,500 Netflix subscribers watching via computers, tablets or smartphones. (Luth Research does not track Netflix viewing on televisions, whether Internet-connected sets or those linked to streaming-media players or gaming consoles.) According to Luth, an estimated 10.7% of subscribers (approximately 4.4 million) watched at least one episode of ''Daredevil'' in its first 11 days on Netflix, with 2.3% (940,000) watching on the first day.<ref name=\"LuthViewers\" /> In a separate study, Netflix determined that the fifth episode of the season was the one to \"hook\" viewers, \"to the point where they [continued on to watch] the entire first season.\"<ref name=\"NetflixHook\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n[[File:The Judge 32 (15236588671).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as Wilson Fisk was one of the highlights of the series for critics.<ref name=\"EsquireReview\" /><ref name=\"IGNSeasonReview\" /><ref name=\"IWReview\" />]]\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 99% approval rating with an average rating of 8.1/10 based on 70 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"With tight adherence to its source material's history, high production quality, and a no-nonsense dramatic flair, ''Daredevil'' excels as an effective superhero origin story, a gritty procedural, and an exciting action adventure.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/daredevil/s01/|title=Marvel's Daredevil: Season 1 (2015)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 6, 2019}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 75 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-daredevil|title=Marvel's Daredevil : Season 1|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn reviews for the first five episodes of the series, Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' felt that \"Compared to Marvel's experience with ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' for ABC, operating in Netflix's pay-to-view world is clearly liberating\" in terms of what can be done and shown.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> Matt Patches of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' added, \"The show's exterior recasts the high fructose, splash page aesthethic of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America with neo-noir attitude. Goddard and DeKnight drench ''Daredevil'' in shadows and blood.\" He compared ''Daredevil'' to \"a TV spinoff\" of [[Christopher Nolan]]{{'}}s [[The Dark Knight Trilogy|Batman films]], and praised Cox and D'Onofrio's portrayals, while criticizing a subplot involving Nelson and Page and noting that the slow pacing of ''Daredevil'', in which story may be stretched out more than needs be, could be a problem for binge-watchers.<ref name=\"EsquireReview\" /> Victoria McNally of [[MTV]] felt the early episodes' fight sequences were \"filmed beautifully\" and enjoyed that they featured little [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], while also calling Henson \"perfectly cast and endlessly amusing\" as Nelson.<ref name=\"MTVReview\" />\n\nEric Eisenberg of Cinema Blend also had positive thoughts on the initial episodes, saying, \"It\u2019s smart, entertaining, and has moments so shocking that you\u2019ll have to repress screams. Suffice it to say, Marvel and Netflix have another big winner on their respective plates,\" while also praising the acting.<ref name=\"CinemaBlendReview\" /> Speaking of the first two episodes, Mark Hughes of ''[[Forbes]]'' added additional praise, saying, \"Quite simply, in ''Daredevil'' Marvel delivers one of the greatest live-action superhero origin stories ever made. It is in the same top-tier category of true superhero origin films along with ''[[Batman Begins]]'', ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', and ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]''.\" Hughes stated that if the first two episodes were released in theaters with only minor tweaks, they \"would\u2019ve been hailed as one of Marvel\u2019s best films to date.\"<ref name=\"ForbesReview\" /> Mike Hale at the ''[[New York Times]]'' was less positive about the series, calling it ordinary, but admitting having high expectations due to his love for the comics, and admiring the care and seriousness with which the series was made. He called the series pace \"leisurely\", but \"a pleasant change from the norm\", and called Cox's performance \"divided\", praising him as Murdock and criticizing him as Daredevil. Hale was positive about the cast overall, and ultimately surmised that after seeing the first five episodes, ''Daredevil'' is \"eminently watchable\", but not the Daredevil he remembered from the comics.<ref name=\"NYTimesReview\" />\n\nAfter reviewing each of the individual episodes, [[IGN]] reviewer Matt Fowler gave the entire first season a score of 9 out of 10, indicating an \"Amazing\" season, saying that though it may have \"spun a few wheels\" while building up to its endgame, the series was \"a thrilling, ultra-satisfying take on Daredevil's material and lore. One that, like Favreau's first Iron Man film, helped breathe new life and fandom into a somewhat B-tier Marvel character.\" He particularly praised D'Onofrio's performance, the \"edgy\" fight sequences, the fact that the hero himself got \"beat on \u2013 a lot\", and the unique dark take on the MCU.<ref name=\"IGNSeasonReview\" /> Liz Shannon Miller, reviewing the season for [[Indiewire]], graded it a 'B+', and though feeling that it didn't quite live up to DeKnight's admitted influence, ''The Wire'', praised the series, noting its characters and development, and the performances of the entire cast, especially those of D'Onofrio, Curtis-Hall, and Cox. She was positive about the level of violence the series depicted, and all of its \"brutal\" and \"beautiful\" fight sequences, as well as the way that the series explores the consequences for average people of events from the films, while committing to building its own universe within the already established MCU.<ref name=\"IWReview\" /> [[Alan Sepinwall]] of [[HitFix]] also praised the cast and characters, particularly D'Onofrio, and felt that series benefited from having a much narrower focus than the Marvel films or other series. He did wish that Murdock's \"world on fire\"-sight was used more often, and felt that the classic Daredevil costume, which \"may not translate well to live-action\", could use \"some tweaks\".<ref name=\"HitFixReview\" />\n\n===Accolades===\nCox was honored at the [[American Foundation for the Blind]]'s 19th Annual Helen Keller Achievement Awards, for those \"that have demonstrated outstanding achievement in improving quality of life for people with vision loss.\"<ref name=\"19thHelenKellerAA\" /> The series' main title sequence, created initially for this season, won the [[Online Film & Television Association Award|Online Film & Television Association's award]] for the Best New Titles Sequence,<ref name=\"EmmyAwards\"/> and was nominated for the Creative Arts Emmy Award for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design|Outstanding Main Title Design]], which went to ''[[Manhattan (TV series)|Manhattan]]''.<ref name=\"EmmyAwards\" />\n\nThe season was included on multiple Best/Top TV Shows of 2015 lists, ranking on ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''{{'}}s (1st, along with ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''),<ref name=\"PeopleTop102015\" /> ''[[Business Insider]]''{{'}}s (3rd),<ref name=\"BITop102015\" /> ''[[TV Guide]]'' and [[Digital Spy]]'s (7th),<ref name=\"TVGuideTop102015\" /><ref name=\"DigitalSpyTop102015\" /> and ''[[Slate Magazine]]''{{'}}s (23rd).<ref name=\"SlateTop252015\" /> It also was included on ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''{{'}} Best New TV Shows of 2015 list.<ref name=\"VanityFairTop102015\" /> ''Daredevil''{{'}}s first season was the seventh trending television show search on [[Google]] for 2015.<ref name=\"GoogleTrend\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n!

(TV series)#Episodes\n}}\nThe first season of the American [[web television]] series ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', which is based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|of the same name]], follows the early days of Matt Murdock / Daredevil, a lawyer-by-day who fights crime at night, juxtaposed with the rise of crime lord [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]]. It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], DeKnight Prods. and Goddard Textiles, with [[Steven S. DeKnight]] serving as [[showrunner]], and series creator [[Drew Goddard]] acting as consultant.\n\n[[Charlie Cox]] stars as Murdock, while [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] plays Fisk. They are joined by principal cast members [[Deborah Ann Woll]], [[Elden Henson]], [[Toby Leonard Moore]], [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]], [[Bob Gunton]], [[Ayelet Zurer]], and [[Rosario Dawson]]. ''Daredevil'' entered development in late 2013, with Goddard hired in December. DeKnight replaced him as showrunner and Cox was hired to star in May 2014. Filmed in New York City from July to December 2014, the season focuses on the darker, more mature elements of the source material. Stephanie Maslansky designed the costumes for the season, with the final red suit for Daredevil designed by Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists at [[Marvel Studios]]. The season features links and references to other MCU projects, including future Netflix series.\n\nThe first two episodes of the season premiered in Los Angeles on April 2, 2015, with the full season of 13 episodes released on [[Netflix]] on April 10 to an estimated high viewership. Critics praised the performances, particularly D'Onofrio's, and the darker tone and action sequences of the series compared to other properties set in the MCU. However, some of the pacing during the season and the final red Daredevil suit received criticism. The first season received two nominations for [[67th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards|Creative Emmy Awards]], for the visual effects from Shade VFX, and the sound editing. The series was renewed for a [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]] on April 21, 2015.<ref name=\"Season2Ordered\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#0A2252 |overall=7 |season=7 |title=25 |director=16 |writer=30 |airdate=15 |airdateR=<ref name=\"Futon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/marvels-daredevil/listings/ |title=Shows A-Z - marvel's daredevil on netflix |website=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Into the Ring\n |DirectedBy = [[Phil Abraham]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Drew Goddard]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = Criminals, including the [[Russian mafia]], [[Yakuza]], and [[Triad (organized crime)|Chinese mob]], have taken advantage of [[Hell's Kitchen]]'s circumstances since \"[[The Avengers (2012 film)#Plot|the incident]]\". Blinded as a boy in an accident that gave him heightened senses, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] begins fighting this rising criminal element by night as a costumed [[vigilante]] while opening a law firm with his friend, [[Foggy Nelson]]. Their first client is [[Karen Page]], a secretary for construction company Union Allied, who has been framed for the murder of her co-worker, Daniel Fisher, after accidentally uncovering a pension embezzlement scheme. Murdock prevents Karen from being prosecuted and protects her from an assassin, before exposing the scandal through [[Ben Urich]] at ''The New York Bulletin''. Grateful for their help, Page offers to work for Murdock and Nelson. [[Wesley (comics)|James Wesley]] covers up the involvement of his employer in the scandal, and orders Anatoly and Vladimir Ranskahov, the Russians' leaders, to deal with Murdock (\"the man in black\"): they kidnap a young boy to lure him into a trap.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Cut Man\n |DirectedBy = Phil Abraham\n |WrittenBy = Drew Goddard\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = When Murdock was a boy, his father was murdered by the Hell's Kitchen [[Irish Mob]] for winning a match he was told to [[Match fixing|throw]]. Now, after failing to rescue the kidnapped boy, a severely injured Murdock is found in a dumpster by nurse [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]]. Nelson meanwhile attempts to comfort Page following her recent traumatic experiences. Temple takes Murdock to her apartment, tends to his wounds, and removes his mask, discovering his blindness. He refuses to reveal his name, but does reveal his heightened senses when they alert him to a Russian who is searching the apartment building, giving Temple time to hide Murdock and convince the man that she knows nothing. Murdock realizes that the man did not believe her, and overpowers him, taking him to the roof. Murdock and Temple torture him into revealing the boy's location, before Murdock pushes him off the roof and into the same dumpster; Murdock says he will survive. Murdock enters the building where they are keeping the boy, defeats the guards, and rescues the boy.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Rabbit in a Snowstorm\n |DirectedBy = [[Adam Kane]]\n |WrittenBy = Marco Ramirez\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = Wesley, having become aware of Nelson and Murdock because of their involvement with Page during the Union Allied scandal, hires them to defend John Healy, an assassin. Though Nelson wishes not to get involved with an obvious criminal element, Murdock wishes to use the case to discover who Wesley's employer is, and so accepts Wesley's offer, which includes a substantial sum to ensure their silence. Page receives a similar offer from Union Allied, who do not want her to talk to anyone else about the scandal, and threaten to sue her for leaking company secrets to the press if she does not agree. Despite this, Page goes to Urich, whose editor Ellison is forcing him to write superfluous stories rather than the major crime breaks of his youth, and offers to tell him more about the Union Allied scandal. After successfully defending Healy, Murdock confronts him in costume and forces him to reveal Wesley's employer, [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]]. Healy  commits suicide rather than face the consequences of giving up Fisk's identity.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = In the Blood\n |DirectedBy = [[Ken Girotti]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Joe Pokaski]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = Murdock is unable to find any record of Fisk, and so continues to interrogate criminals, searching for answers. Wesley informs the Ranskahovs of an offer Fisk has made to help with their operations, given their recent failures. Angered at this apparent slight, they attempt to stop the man in black once and for all by visiting in hospital the Russian whom Murdock threw from the roof. After the Russian tells them of Temple, they send men to kidnap her, but she manages to call Murdock in time to alert him of her kidnapping. The Russians attempt to torture Murdock's name out of Temple, but Murdock arrives and defeats the gangsters. Seeing the aftermath of this, the Ranskahovs decide to agree to Fisk's offer, with Anatoly going to tell Fisk personally, by barging into the restaurant where Fisk is having dinner with an art gallery curator named [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Marianna]]. Fisk takes a confused Marianna home, and angered at this intrusion and embarrassment, Fisk beheads Anatoly and orders Wesley to send the body to Vladimir.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n |Title = World on Fire\n |DirectedBy = [[Farren Blackburn]]\n |WrittenBy = Luke Kalteux\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = Fisk explains the situation to his allies, including Chinese leader Madame Gao, of whom he asks a special favor. Elena Cardenas, a renter of powerful businessman Armand Tulley, comes to Nelson and Murdock after Tulley, who wants to convert her apartment building, sends men to wreck her home. Nelson goes to Tulley's lawyers at Landman and Zack (where he and Murdock once interned), represented by Marci Stahl, Nelson's ex-girlfriend. She explains that Cardenas and her neighbors can either take a large settlement or be evicted. While looking for complaints against Tulley at the police station, Murdock realizes Detectives Carl Hoffman and Christian Blake are corrupt when he hears them kill a Russian. Murdock later incapacitates Blake and uses his cell phone to find Vladimir. Fisk pays [[Turk Barrett]] to reveal to Vladimir that Fisk killed Anatoly, and as they prepare for a war against Fisk, their forces are destroyed in a [[suicide attack]] by Gao's workers.

With Temple's help, Murdock cauterizes Vladimir's wounds, alerting a non-corrupt police officer to their presence. The officer calls in Murdock and Vladimir's location, and the warehouse is soon surrounded. Blake and Hoffman take control of the situation, and await Fisk's orders. Fisk talks to Murdock via police radio, telling him of his admiration for what Murdock is trying to do, even though it clashes with Fisk's own plans to save the city. Fisk then frames the vigilante by having a police sniper fire on other officers from the roof of the warehouse, including Blake, as Urich and the media look on. Vladimir, in return for Murdock avenging Anatoly's death, gives him information on [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Leland Owlsley]] \u2013 the accountant for all of Fisk's operations \u2013 before giving his life so that Murdock can escape.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n |Title = Stick\n |DirectedBy = [[Brad Turner (director)|Brad Turner]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Douglas Petrie]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = Murdock tracks down Owlsley, but is distracted by the arrival of an elderly man: Murdock's mentor, [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], who taught him to master his abilities as a child, but abandoned him when Murdock developed an attachment to him. Now, he enlists Murdock's help in destroying Black Sky, a weapon that the Japanese, led by Nobu, are bringing to New York. Stick agrees to refrain from killing, but breaks his promise when he kills Black Sky, who is actually a young boy. After fighting in Murdock's apartment, Murdock defeats Stick, who agrees to leave the city. Urich, having agreed to help Page expose the further scandal and corruption surrounding Hell's Kitchen and Union Allied, explains that they need proof before they can publish anything. While searching for a connection between Tulley's men and Union Allied, Page is confronted by them. Nelson helps her escape them, so she and Urich explain their investigation to him.

Owlsley and Nobu, angry at being confronted by the vigilante and losing Black Sky, respectively, express their displeasure with Fisk, while he is also dealing with Blake, who wakes up in hospital. Fisk convinces Hoffman to kill Blake before he can speak out against Fisk, but Hoffman is incapacitated by Murdock, who gets information on Fisk from Blake before he dies. Gao visits Fisk, warning him that he will have to get everything under control if he does not want her, Nobu, and Owlsley to side-step him. An angry Fisk is later consoled by Marianna, and he tells her of how, as a child, he murdered his father when he was beating Fisk's mother. She convinces him to stand up and go public with his intentions to save the city. This negates all of Murdock's information from Blake, which Urich was going to publish.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 9\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n |Title = Speak of the Devil\n |DirectedBy = [[Nelson McCormick (director)|Nelson McCormick]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Christos Gage]] & Ruth Fletcher Gage\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = In the wake of Fisk's public revelation, Murdock, Page, Nelson, and Urich begin searching for something from Fisk's past that they can use against him. Murdock visits Marianna at her art gallery, hoping to gain insight into Fisk by speaking with her, and encounters Fisk himself. Nobu demands a promised city block from Fisk, who agrees on the condition Nobu provide him with a \"specialist\" in return to deal with the vigilante. The block, which Fisk has bought from Tulley, is where Cardenas lives, and she is one of the few tenants who stands in the way of Fisk gifting it to Nobu. When Cardenas is killed by a junkie, Murdock realizes that Fisk is behind it, and tracks him to an abandoned warehouse, where he is confronted by the specialist: Nobu. Murdock eventually defeats Nobu, accidentally causing him to burn alive, but sustains serious injuries. Fisk then confronts Murdock, beating him nearly to death. Murdock barely escapes, only to collapse at his home in front of Nelson.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 10\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 10\n |Title = Nelson v.

Murdock explains that after experiencing the twisted morals of Landman and Zack, Murdock took it upon himself to confront an abusive father with no legal evidence against him, but who Murdock had discovered through his heightened senses. Since then, he had been doing everything he could to make the city a better place whenever the law could not. Nelson, unable to look past Murdock's lies, leaves their firm. Urich, after the extension on his sick wife's hospital stay is denied and he is offered a better paying job as an editor rather than a reporter, decides to give up the investigation. Page, in an attempt to change his mind, takes him to a rest home she just discovered, where they meet Marlene Vistain, Fisk's mother, who tells them that Fisk killed his father. Fisk, meanwhile, is throwing a charity gala to publicly raise money for victims of the bombings.

Before she goes, Temple suggests that he get better protection if he is going to continue his crusade. With the help of Barrett, Murdock finds [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Melvin Potter]], a mentally unbalanced engineer who has been coerced into creating armored clothing for Fisk, and asks him to make a suit of body armor in exchange for stopping Fisk from hurting anyone else. Page wishes to reveal the story of how Vistain is alive, and says that Fisk killed his father, but Urich explains that it is unreliable, given her state of mind. While Fisk will not leave Marianna's side as she recovers in hospital, Wesley receives a phone call from Vistain and learns that Page and Urich visited her. He confronts Page and attempts to blackmail her into not exposing Fisk, threatening to hurt her friends.

Fisk's men find Wesley, and the grieving Fisk realizes that the last person he talked to was Vistain. Wanting to keep those he loves safe by sending them out of the country, Fisk is unable to convince Marianna to leave him, but does get Vistain away, with the sick Vistain unable to tell him what her call to Wesley was about. Nelson continues his work without Murdock, and takes what they know to Stahl. Page, struggling to get over killing Wesley, convinces Urich to write the story, but it is rejected by Ellison. When Urich accuses Ellison of being paid off by Fisk, he gets fired. Urich decides to start his own blog to get Fisk's story out there, but Fisk's actual informant in the ''Bulletin'' tells him that Urich visited Vistain, angering him to the point that he breaks into Urich's apartment and kills him.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 13\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 13\n |Title = Daredevil\n |DirectedBy = Steven S.

When Owlsley tries to blackmail him, an infuriated Fisk kills Owlsley by throwing him into an open elevator shaft. Murdock and Nelson reconcile their differences, and begin building their case against Fisk. As the vigilante, Murdock finds Hoffman with information from Stahl and convinces him to testify against Fisk. Acting on this testimony, federal agents arrest Fisk and his co-conspirators, but Fisk manages to escape custody. Before he can flee the city, Murdock intercepts him, wearing the new armor made for him by Potter. After a brutal fight, Murdock defeats Fisk and leaves him to the police. With Fisk arrested, Marianna leaves the city. Murdock, Page, and Nelson celebrate their success and resume their work.

He was succeeded by [[Steven S. DeKnight]]. Goddard, who wrote the first two episodes, remained with the show as a consultant and executive producer. It was also revealed that the series would be titled ''Marvel's Daredevil''.<ref name=\"GoddardDaredevilExit\" /> The first season consists of 13 hour-long episodes,<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> and DeKnight, Goddard, [[Jeph Loeb]], Jim Chory, [[Dan Buckley]], [[Joe Quesada]], [[Stan Lee]], [[Alan Fine (executive)|Alan Fine]], Cindy Holland, Kris Henigman, Allie Goss, and Peter Friedlander serve as executive producers.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe season does not directly adapt any one storyline from the comics, with DeKnight feeling that it was more important to focus on \"nailing the spirit of the comics\".<ref name=\"DeKnightGrislyScenes\" /> He stated that Netflix's support of \"the creatives\" coupled with Marvel's restrictions on their properties led to him pushing the source material as far as he could while remaining respectful of the characters and their history, and being surprised at \"how willing everyone is to take a really fresh look and really push what we\u2019re doing.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPaste\" /> [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] compared telling a story on Netflix to more of a \"13-hour film\" than a television series and noted that time can be taken to tell the story and \"be much more specific\".<ref name=\"D'OnofrioMar2015\" /> [[Deborah Ann Woll]] explained that what she saw as one of the most important themes in the series was normal people having an impact in \"seemingly insurmountable circumstances\", with the focus not being on Daredevil's abilities or the characters' qualifications, but on their willingness to help people.<ref name=\"IGNApr2015\" />\n\nThough the season was much more violent than previous MCU works, DeKnight felt that sexual violence would be \"too far\", saying that \"''Daredevil'' wasn\u2019t asking for a lot of sexual situations, especially since Matt Murdock is not really in the position to get into a relationship, and it just didn\u2019t fit the story for that season. I think that\u2019ll change moving forward, but I never pushed any kind of sexual agenda on the show. I think once ''Daredevil'' was a hit and people were really responding positively, you can see the progression into more of an adult world in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightGrislyScenes\" />\n\nSpeaking about the way the season reveals the name Daredevil, DeKnight explained that several options had been brought up, such as \"one of the versions in the comics where when he was a kid people used to taunt him with the name Daredevil\", which did not fit in the world of the series, or having [[Ben Urich]] give the character the name, but the timing for that did not work due to Urich's death before the final Daredevil suit was introduced. It was decided that instead of having the name Daredevil said onscreen, it would be easier to introduce it through the media as a newspaper headline. On why this was not done for Wilson Fisk as Kingpin, DeKnight stated that he felt it would \"get a little bit silly....[if] we went, 'Oh they called him Daredevil! Oh they called him Kingpin!',\" and was unable to come up with another natural way for the name Kingpin to come up, so it was decided to leave that for a later time.<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\n===Casting===\nThe main cast for the season includes [[Charlie Cox]] as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock / Daredevil]],<ref name=\"Cox\" /> [[Deborah Ann Woll]] as [[Karen Page]],<ref name=\"Woll\" /> [[Elden Henson]] as [[Foggy Nelson|Franklin \"Foggy\" Nelson]],<ref name=\"Henson\" /> [[Toby Leonard Moore]] as [[Wesley (comics)|James Wesley]],<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] as [[Ben Urich]],<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Bob Gunton]] as [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Leland Owlsley]],<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Ayelet Zurer]] as [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Marianna]],<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Claire Temple]],<ref name=\"DawsonCast\" /><ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /> [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]].<ref name=\"D'Onofrio\" /> \n\nIn July 2014, [[Peter Shinkoda]] was reported to have a recurring role in the season, portraying Hashiro.<ref name=\"Shinkoda\" /> In March 2015, this character was revealed to actually be Nobu Yoshioka, while recurring opponents for Daredevil \u2013 Madame Gao, Vladimir Ranskahov, and [[Turk Barrett]] \u2013 were also announced, portrayed by Wai Ching Ho, [[Nikolai Nikolaeff]], and [[Rob Morgan (actor)|Rob Morgan]].<ref name=\"EWMar2015Castings\" /><ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" /> Additionally, the following also recur throughout the season: Geoffrey Cantor as Mitchell Ellison;<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /><ref name=\"Cantor\" /> Judith Delgado as Elena Cardenas;<ref name=\"Delgado\" /> Daryl Edwards as Carl Hoffman;<ref name=\"EdwardsJohnson\" /> Royce Johnson as Brett Mahoney;<ref name=\"EdwardsJohnson\" /> [[Adriane Lenox]] as Doris Urich;<ref name=\"NerdistCast\" /> [[Peter McRobbie]] as [[Father Lantom|Father Paul Lantom]];<ref name=\"SRTrivia\" /> Amy Rutberg as Marci Stahl;<ref name=\"Rutberg\" /> Chris Tardio as Christian Blake;<ref name=\"Tardio\" /> Susan Varon as Josie;<ref name=\"NerdistCast\" /> and Tom Walker as Francis.<ref name=\"Walker\" />\n\n===Design===\n[[File:Charlie Cox as Daredevil in Marvel's Daredevil.gif|thumb|right|The two costumes worn by Cox in the season: first, his black \"vigilante outfit\";<ref name=\"IGNTrailer\" /> second, his red \"classic suit\".<ref name=\"IGNCostume\" />]]\nCostume designer Stephanie Maslansky read the first two episodes' scripts and some outlines of future scripts, and developed a \"solid understanding\" of the character arcs and overall story to begin the advanced planning needed for costume design.

This was done to highlight the formation of Matt Murdock as Daredevil, with the costume evolving over time as the character develops.<ref name=\"IGNTrailer\" /> Marvel Comics' [[Chief creative officer|Chief Creative Officer]] Quesada conceptualized the look based on DeKnight's specifications.<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" /> On the design process, DeKnight revealed that \"we tried practically everything, design-wise. We experimented with a lot of different head pieces. One version was a ski mask with the eyes sewn shut. We tried everything until we found something that just felt right.\"<ref name=\"IGNTrailer\" /> DeKnight and Quesada explained that the idea was for Murdock to start out with a homemade outfit that fits more in the \"real-world\" of the series, and to then evolve it into the classic Daredevil suit.<ref name=\"IGNCostume\" /> Maslansky noted that they wanted the outfit to \"look like something that Matt Murdock could put together himself, that he could either order off the Internet or shop around town....we wound up with pretty practical choices for him. His shirts are compression shirts and his pants wound up being from an army/navy store.\" Concerning the black mask, Maslansky noted that a balance between aesthetic and safety was required, and that it was made of layers of cotton mesh that \"really conform to his head\" but also allowed Cox to see through the mask.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\nOn the red suit, Maslansky said, \"We wanted something that looked militaristic and functional, but also dramatic and sexy\" adding that it was \"tricky\" making it practical.<ref name=\"IGNCostume\" /> To begin the process of creating the suit, Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked. Quesada, who previously worked as an artist on ''Daredevil'' comics, gave several suggestions, including the incorporation of some of how New York was created into the suit, which led to the use of rivets and \"architectural\" shapes. The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest, and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists highlighted certain areas with red, with \"deeper portions\" in shadow. On the mask, Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of a face that is intended to match the bottom half of an actor's face, \"because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actor\u2019s face is going to be doing something else\". For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by [[Andy Park (comics)|Andy Park]], discussions were had about having them holstered on the right leg, given that both Cox and his stunt double Chris Brewster are right handed, but it was ultimately decided to have the holster on the left hand side as it is in the \"classic profile\" of the comics.<ref name=\"MarvelSuit\" /> DeKnight explained that Murdock's Daredevil suit does not have the \"DD\" emblem on the chest as seen in the comics, because Murdock receives his moniker only after the suit is introduced. He also felt that the emblem was \"one of the more problematic emblems in superhero-dom\", and that Daredevil's suit in the comics was \"very difficult to translate to screen, especially in this world that is grounded and gritty\".<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\nMany of the male characters in the series are often seen wearing suits, which Maslansky was comfortable with after working as the costume designer on ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]''. Murdock's suits are differentiated more by texture than color, with a limited palette, given that the character cannot see what color his clothing is. Cox's size changed throughout the series as he continued to work out. For Murdock's sunglasses, Maslansky worked with series prop master Michael Jortner to make something that fit into the modern world, but paid homage to \"what was familiar to fans\". Close to 100 different versions of the prop were created for Cox to try. For the women of the series, Maslansky looked to their backstories in the show, with Page having dreams and fantasies of a life in New York along the lines of [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], and dressing according to those thoughts (\"retro, slim skirts, tighter fitting tops and slim dresses\"), while Marianna coming into the series as a mysterious yet glamorous [[femme fatale]], dressing in high-end, couture clothing; \"she needed to appeal to [Fisk]. He wouldn\u2019t go for just any chick in a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt.\"<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\n===Filming===\nIn February 2014, Marvel announced that ''Daredevil'' would be filmed in New York City.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> In April 2014, Quesada reiterated this, stating that the show would be filming in areas of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Long Island City]] that still look like the old [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell\u2019s Kitchen]], in addition to sound stage work.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> Loeb said that ''Daredevil'' would begin filming in July 2014,<ref name=\"JulyFilmingAnnounced\" /> and DeKnight confirmed that filming had started that month.<ref name=\"DeKnightJuly2014\" /> It filmed under the [[working title]] ''Bluff'',<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> on a $56 million budget. The production received $14.3 million under the New York Film & TV Tax Credit Program.<ref name=\"Budget\" /> Production concluded on December 21, 2014.<ref name=\"ProductionWrap\" /> Other filming locations in New York City included the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn|Greenpoint]] and [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]] neighborhoods in Brooklyn;<ref name=\"Brooklyn\" /><ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /> Abe Lebewohl Park in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]; Whitestone Lanes bowling alley in [[Flushing, Queens]]; the [[New York County Courthouse|New York State Supreme Court Building]], with the interior for court scenes filmed on a set; [[Brooklyn Borough Hall]]; the [[Rockefeller Center]] rooftop gardens; [[Brooklyn College]] for Murdock and Nelson's flashback to their time in college; the [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] neighborhood in Manhattan; and the Honeywell Bridge in Long Island City.<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" />\n\n\"Cut Man\" ends with a long action sequence filmed in a [[Long take|single take]]. DeKnight called it the \"most complicated action scene\" in the series, due to the technical difficulty in filming it, and credited Goddard, episodic director [[Phil Abraham]], stunt coordinator Philip J Silvera, and series cinematographer Matt Lloyd with realizing it.<ref name=\"ColliderApr2015\" /> He also named ''[[The Raid: Redemption|The Raid]]'' films as inspiration for the sequence.<ref name=\"RSApr2015\" /> There were only a few days to plan and set up the fight, as opposed to a film which would allow \"at least a couple of weeks\", and it took 7 or 8 takes to get the shot right. Silvera explained that the scene was always scripted to be a one-shot, and that he had intended to work around it with wipes, but Abraham challenged the team to do it all for real, which allowed the fight to feel more grounded by having them \"slow down the fight, and just have this raw, animalistic feeling happening.\" The final shot does include some 'Texas Switches' between actors and stunt doubles, but was ultimately filmed with no cuts.<ref name=\"Stunts\" />\n\nTalking about the scene where Fisk beheads Anatoly Ranskahov with a car door in \"In the Blood\", DeKnight noted that series like ''[[Spartacus (TV series)|Spartacus]]'' and ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' would have shown the head being crushed, which he felt was \"the right choice\" for them, but for ''Daredevil'' \"we did very much a ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' thing, we saw the aftereffects of it, but you never saw the car door crushing his head....Sound effects, absolutely. It\u2019s a very disturbing scene without crossing that line into a horror movie kind of deal.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightGrislyScenes\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects for the series were completed by the New York studio Shade VFX; ''Daredevil'' featured over 1000 visual effect shots.<ref name=\"ShadeVFX\" /><ref name=\"ShadeVFX2\" /> Executive visual effects supervisor Bryan Goswin explained that the company's work included the creation of digital doubles when stunts were not safe for actors or stunt doubles, as well as blood-hits and wounds, with \"a lot of support to the idea of the violence and gore that happens in Daredevil\" given to differentiate the series from other Marvel projects, and to try to set the series in a \"more realistic and dark place, the real streets of New York.\"<ref name=\"ShadeVFX3\" />\n\nOne shot created by Shade VFX is when the audience sees Matt Murdock's \"vision\" \u2013 the way that he \"sees\" using his other heightened senses. On why this was only used once in the season, DeKnight explained that it had in fact been budgeted to appear several more times, with the effect actually completed at least twice more for the season. It was removed for several reasons, including to avoid taking away the specialty of it, and to maintain the crime drama tone of the series. One instance where it would have been used again was in \"Stick\", where the audience would have seen how Murdock saw Stick as he threw keys at him, and then when he is older and Stick throws fighting sticks at him and his senses are more refined. In that case, the effect was not finished on time. Another instance was in \"The Ones We Leave Behind\" when Murdock comes across a Chinese worker and realizes that he has been blinded. The final use of the effect was going to be in \"Daredevil\" when the camera pushes in on Page's reaction Murdock telling her that they can work together. Here, the effect was hiding all of the nuances in her expression, so it was decided that it would be better to remove it.<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\n===Music===\nComposer [[John Paesano]] was brought on \"a couple of weeks in to post-production\", and scored an episode every four to five days. Paesano estimated that each episode has around 25\u201330 minutes of music in it. In approaching the series' score, Paesano looked to DeKnight, who \"had a very clear vision of what he wanted ... music you could feel and not necessarily hear.\" The result was a more [[minimalism|minimalist]] score than typical \"superhero\" music, although the music starts to \"change color\" and move closer to that of the MCU when the classic red costume is introduced. Most of the score was produced electronically, though live elements, such as a cello, were used where possible. Rather than \"keep the drive and the energy up\" with drums, Paesano elected to use a low pulsing heartbeat that was inline with the series' minimalist approach, and tied into the fact that Daredevil can hear people's heartbeats in the show.<ref name=\"PaesanoApr2015\" /> A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by [[Hollywood Records]] on April 27, 2015.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n\nAll music composed by John Paesano, unless otherwise noted.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = \n| total_length    = 41:45\n\n\n| title1          = Main Title\n| music1          = John Paesano & Braden Kimball\n| length1         = 1:04\n\n| title2          = Fogwell's Gym\n| length2         = 3:53\n\n| title3          = Battlin' Jack Murdock\n| length3         = 3:05\n\n| title4          = Hallway Fight\n| length4         = 4:26\n\n| title5          = Union Allied\n| length5         = 1:51\n\n| title6          = Passenger Side\n| length6         = 2:57\n\n| title7          = A World on Fire\n| length7         = 1:26\n\n| title8          = Ben Urich\n| length8         = 3:09\n\n| title9          = Stick\n| length9         = 2:11\n\n| title10         = Wilson Fisk\n| length10        = 4:38\n\n| title11         = Worthy Opponents\n| length11        = 2:28\n\n| title12         = Avocados at Law\n| length12        = 1:42\n\n| title13         = Man of Ill Intent\n| length13        = 3:45\n\n| title14         = The Suit\n| length14        = 5:43\n\n| title15         = Daredevil\n| length15        = 1:41\n}}\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nIn February 2015, Emma Fleisher of Marvel Television stated that ''Daredevil'' takes place in the aftermath of ''The Avengers'', but would not \"explicitly [be] in that ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' world. We're in our own corner [of the MCU]. So the [[Chitauri|aliens]] came down and ruined the city, and this is the story of Hell's Kitchen's rebuild.\"<ref name=\"CinemaBlend\" /> Connections to other MCU properties include the character of [[Absorbing Man|Carl \"Crusher\" Creel]], who appears in ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' portrayed by [[Brian Patrick Wade]], and is mentioned as having fought Jack Murdock in the latter's final boxing match;<ref name=\"IGN8Apr2015\" /> St. Agnes Orphanage, where both Matt Murdock and ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s [[Daisy Johnson|Skye]] are raised; the insignia on Madame Gao's heroin, which is a connection to the Iron Fist antagonist [[Steel Serpent]]; and mentions of [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]], a company featured throughout the MCU.<ref name=\"SRTrivia\" />\n\nThe final scene of \"Stick\", featuring a conversation between [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] and Stone, was meant to hint at further ties between the series and other areas of the MCU in the same way as Marvel's film [[post-credits scene]]s, though it could not actually go after the episode's credits due to the way that Netflix begins the next episode during the credits of the current one.<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" /> There were discussions about having another such \"coda\" at the end of the season finale, one which would have featured Leland Owlsley attempting to escape New York, only to be killed by the [[Punisher]] in a surprise introduction. The scene would not have shown the actor's face, but would have included the character's iconic skull insignia. The idea was dropped, again because of Netflix's playing system, and Owlsley was ultimately killed by Fisk in the episode, with the introduction of the Punisher saved for the series' [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]].<ref name=\"PunisherCoda\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe first season of ''Daredevil'' was released on April 10, 2015 on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix, in all territories where it is available, in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]].<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"VarietyTrailerUltraHD\" /> On April 14, 2015, ''Daredevil'' was the first Netflix series to receive its [[Descriptive Video Service]] [[audio description]] track, \"a narration track that describes what is happening on-screen, including physical actions, facial expressions, costumes, settings and scene changes.\"<ref name=\"NetflixAudioDescription\" /> By April 16, episodes for the series had been [[Copyright infringement|pirated]] by 2.1 million individual users worldwide, according to Excipio, a piracy tracking firm, surpassed in that timeframe only by ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. The biggest countries for piracy were Brazil (190,274 torrent downloaders), India (149,316), the U.S. (144,351), the UK (119,891), France (105,473) and Australia (101,025). Except for India, Netflix was available in each of those countries at the time.<ref name=\"Piracy\" /> The season was enhanced to be available in [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] after its initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nAt the October 2014 [[New York Comic Con]], footage from the series was shown.<ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /><ref name=\"NYCC20142\" /> In January 2015, a motion [[film poster]] was released to coincide with the revealing of the streaming date for the first season.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> The following month, on February 4, a teaser trailer was released.<ref name=\"VarietyTrailerUltraHD\" /> Merrill Barr of ''[[Forbes]]'' noted the dark tone of the trailer in a similar vein to [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and different from Marvel's [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#ABC series|ABC series]], but questioned the timing of the trailer debut after [[Super Bowl XLIX]], especially as the company did not air trailers during the event for ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' or ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' and could have benefited from introducing \"its latest and riskiest show\" to general audiences through it.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer\" /> In March 2015, an additional motion poster was released, which featured all major characters and [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] in the background of the poster, as well as the possible reveal of Murdock's red suit in his reflection.<ref name=\"MotionPoster\" /> In the lead up to the first-season premiere, a [[street marketing]] campaign appeared across the world in 12 cities with various artists creating murals.<ref name=\"Murals\" /> On April 2, 2015, the series had its premiere at the [[Regal Entertainment Group|Regal Premiere House]] at [[L.A. Live]]<ref name=\"LAPremiere\" /> where the first two episodes were previewed.<ref name=\"ForbesReview\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe season was released on [[DVD]] in [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] and [[Blu-ray]] in [[Blu-ray#B|Region B]] on October 3, 2016,<ref name=\"Region2HomeMedia\" /> in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] and [[Blu-ray#A|Region A]] on November 8, 2016,<ref name=\"Region1HomeMedia\" /> and in [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]] on December 7, 2016.<ref name=\"Region4HomeMedia\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Audience viewership===\nAs Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series, Luth Research compiled data for the season, based on a sample of 2,500 Netflix subscribers watching via computers, tablets or smartphones. (Luth Research does not track Netflix viewing on televisions, whether Internet-connected sets or those linked to streaming-media players or gaming consoles.) According to Luth, an estimated 10.7% of subscribers (approximately 4.4 million) watched at least one episode of ''Daredevil'' in its first 11 days on Netflix, with 2.3% (940,000) watching on the first day.<ref name=\"LuthViewers\" /> In a separate study, Netflix determined that the fifth episode of the season was the one to \"hook\" viewers, \"to the point where they [continued on to watch] the entire first season.\"<ref name=\"NetflixHook\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n[[File:The Judge 32 (15236588671).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as Wilson Fisk was one of the highlights of the series for critics.<ref name=\"EsquireReview\" /><ref name=\"IGNSeasonReview\" /><ref name=\"IWReview\" />]]\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 99% approval rating with an average rating of 8.1/10 based on 70 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"With tight adherence to its source material's history, high production quality, and a no-nonsense dramatic flair, ''Daredevil'' excels as an effective superhero origin story, a gritty procedural, and an exciting action adventure.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/daredevil/s01/|title=Marvel's Daredevil: Season 1 (2015)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 6, 2019}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 75 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-daredevil|title=Marvel's Daredevil : Season 1|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn reviews for the first five episodes of the series, Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' felt that \"Compared to Marvel's experience with ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' for ABC, operating in Netflix's pay-to-view world is clearly liberating\" in terms of what can be done and shown.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> Matt Patches of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' added, \"The show's exterior recasts the high fructose, splash page aesthethic of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America with neo-noir attitude. Goddard and DeKnight drench ''Daredevil'' in shadows and blood.\" He compared ''Daredevil'' to \"a TV spinoff\" of [[Christopher Nolan]]{{'}}s [[The Dark Knight Trilogy|Batman films]], and praised Cox and D'Onofrio's portrayals, while criticizing a subplot involving Nelson and Page and noting that the slow pacing of ''Daredevil'', in which story may be stretched out more than needs be, could be a problem for binge-watchers.<ref name=\"EsquireReview\" /> Victoria McNally of [[MTV]] felt the early episodes' fight sequences were \"filmed beautifully\" and enjoyed that they featured little [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], while also calling Henson \"perfectly cast and endlessly amusing\" as Nelson.<ref name=\"MTVReview\" />\n\nEric Eisenberg of Cinema Blend also had positive thoughts on the initial episodes, saying, \"It\u2019s smart, entertaining, and has moments so shocking that you\u2019ll have to repress screams. Suffice it to say, Marvel and Netflix have another big winner on their respective plates,\" while also praising the acting.<ref name=\"CinemaBlendReview\" /> Speaking of the first two episodes, Mark Hughes of ''[[Forbes]]'' added additional praise, saying, \"Quite simply, in ''Daredevil'' Marvel delivers one of the greatest live-action superhero origin stories ever made. It is in the same top-tier category of true superhero origin films along with ''[[Batman Begins]]'', ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', and ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]''.\" Hughes stated that if the first two episodes were released in theaters with only minor tweaks, they \"would\u2019ve been hailed as one of Marvel\u2019s best films to date.\"<ref name=\"ForbesReview\" /> Mike Hale at the ''[[New York Times]]'' was less positive about the series, calling it ordinary, but admitting having high expectations due to his love for the comics, and admiring the care and seriousness with which the series was made. He called the series pace \"leisurely\", but \"a pleasant change from the norm\", and called Cox's performance \"divided\", praising him as Murdock and criticizing him as Daredevil. Hale was positive about the cast overall, and ultimately surmised that after seeing the first five episodes, ''Daredevil'' is \"eminently watchable\", but not the Daredevil he remembered from the comics.<ref name=\"NYTimesReview\" />\n\nAfter reviewing each of the individual episodes, [[IGN]] reviewer Matt Fowler gave the entire first season a score of 9 out of 10, indicating an \"Amazing\" season, saying that though it may have \"spun a few wheels\" while building up to its endgame, the series was \"a thrilling, ultra-satisfying take on Daredevil's material and lore. One that, like Favreau's first Iron Man film, helped breathe new life and fandom into a somewhat B-tier Marvel character.\" He particularly praised D'Onofrio's performance, the \"edgy\" fight sequences, the fact that the hero himself got \"beat on \u2013 a lot\", and the unique dark take on the MCU.<ref name=\"IGNSeasonReview\" /> Liz Shannon Miller, reviewing the season for [[Indiewire]], graded it a 'B+', and though feeling that it didn't quite live up to DeKnight's admitted influence, ''The Wire'', praised the series, noting its characters and development, and the performances of the entire cast, especially those of D'Onofrio, Curtis-Hall, and Cox. She was positive about the level of violence the series depicted, and all of its \"brutal\" and \"beautiful\" fight sequences, as well as the way that the series explores the consequences for average people of events from the films, while committing to building its own universe within the already established MCU.<ref name=\"IWReview\" /> [[Alan Sepinwall]] of [[HitFix]] also praised the cast and characters, particularly D'Onofrio, and felt that series benefited from having a much narrower focus than the Marvel films or other series. He did wish that Murdock's \"world on fire\"-sight was used more often, and felt that the classic Daredevil costume, which \"may not translate well to live-action\", could use \"some tweaks\".<ref name=\"HitFixReview\" />\n\n===Accolades===\nCox was honored at the [[American Foundation for the Blind]]'s 19th Annual Helen Keller Achievement Awards, for those \"that have demonstrated outstanding achievement in improving quality of life for people with vision loss.\"<ref name=\"19thHelenKellerAA\" /> The series' main title sequence, created initially for this season, won the [[Online Film & Television Association Award|Online Film & Television Association's award]] for the Best New Titles Sequence,<ref name=\"EmmyAwards\"/> and was nominated for the Creative Arts Emmy Award for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design|Outstanding Main Title Design]], which went to ''[[Manhattan (TV series)|Manhattan]]''.<ref name=\"EmmyAwards\" />\n\nThe season was included on multiple Best/Top TV Shows of 2015 lists, ranking on ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''{{'}}s (1st, along with ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''),<ref name=\"PeopleTop102015\" /> ''[[Business Insider]]''{{'}}s (3rd),<ref name=\"BITop102015\" /> ''[[TV Guide]]'' and [[Digital Spy]]'s (7th),<ref name=\"TVGuideTop102015\" /><ref name=\"DigitalSpyTop102015\" /> and ''[[Slate Magazine]]''{{'}}s (23rd).<ref name=\"SlateTop252015\" /> It also was included on ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''{{'}} Best New TV Shows of 2015 list.<ref name=\"VanityFairTop102015\" /> ''Daredevil''{{'}}s first season was the seventh trending television show search on [[Google]] for 2015.<ref name=\"GoogleTrend\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n!

Although some Baptist historical writing suggests that the church was founded by Alexander Jamieson with the support of the wealthy Haldane brothers of Glasgow in the period 1800-1810, there is fairly convincing evidence that it was actually 'planted' by the Collingham Baptist congregation under William Nichols. George Pope may then have become its own minister - before himself moving to Collingham. Nichols was active in the village as early as 1809. Nichols wrote an obituary of a Sutton woman in the Baptist Magazine, volume 7, 1815, which provides one of the few accounts of the life of an ordinary Sutton on Trent woman that we have and so is worth repeating verbatim:\n\n<blockquote>\nJANE RICHARDSON of Sutton on Trent, near Newark, who died January 23d, 1815, aged 81 years.\n\nOn our first going to Sutton, to preach the gospel, in 1809, this old disciple was made known to us. She then expressed to me the joy and pleasure it afforded her that the gospel was brought to that wicked village \u2014\" Here I have been, like a poor speckled bird, ever since I came to it, shut out from hearing the word, which I had enjoyed in my former situation, though I had then to walk five miles on the Lord's day, and often to wade to the knees in water, but I found the word sweet to my soul, which made amends for all my trouble of getting to the house of God. O! how I have lamented the loss of those means of grace ; but I hope that Lord has not left me; and now I pray that the preaching here may be blessed to my soul, and to my neighbours, who are dead in trespasses and sins, though they know it not.\" \n\nWhen she understood we were of the Baptist denomination, she said, \"I wish they were not, for I cannot see any necessity for our being dipped, besides, if it should be the right way l am too old now. She, however, began to read the New Testament with a spirit of inquiry, and while thus engaged, she found that Jesus was baptized- That he ordered his apostles to baptize as well as preach, and that this was to be extended to by all succeeding ministers, to the end of the world. One morning, after having been reading thus, she hastened to a neighbour, with her bible in her hand, to whom she said, \" Well, neighbour, I believe Baptism is right, and if it please the Lord to give me strength, I will be baptized, old as I am.\" Her neighbour replied \u2014\" I don't believe it, I won't believe it, nor would I have you trouble your head about it \u2014I don't like this baptism, for my part.\"\u2014' Well, neighbour, but if Jesus Christ has commanded us to follow his example, saying, thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness,\" as you see it is here in the third chapter of Matthew, and the fifteenth verse \u2014I think we ought. I shall, therefore, offer myself for baptism, if it please the Lord to spare me.\" This she did in the spirit of love to her Lord and Saviour without delay\u2014On the 7th of April, 1811, the day appointed for her to relate her Christian experience to the church, at Collingham, previous to her being baptized, she rose early in the morning to walk thither, a distance of three miles. Her aged husband offered to go with her, but she replied, you need not do that, the Lord will go with me ; accordingly she tied a small bundle of cloths to her side, took her two sticks, and arrived by eight o'clock. \n\nNo sooner had she taken some refreshment, than she began to sing a hymn. I said, \"well my friend you appear to have got here better than one could expect at your time of life. \"O yes,\" she replied, \" and my heart is full of joy; and I believe the Lord will carry me through the duties before me this day.\" She gave in her experience before the church with great composure, and went through the ordinance of baptism with great courage. On leaving us, to return in the evening, she said, at parting, \"blessed be my God and Saviour for this day.\"\nThus, like the eunuch, she went on her way rejoicing. She afterwards met with persecution from the ungodly around her, but in the general, she was carried above it, rejoicing that she was accounted worthy to Suffer shame for Christ's sake. Her attendance on the means of grace was uniform and serious ; she appeared to find the word of God and eat it, and it was the joy and rejoicing of her soul.\n\nWhen certain professors tried to draw her aside, and poison her mind, she would either turn a deaf ear, or reply, \"O let us be thankful for the gospel which God has sent among an unworthy people.\" And in reference to those attempts, she said to a friend a few days before she died, \"Blessed be God, they never moved me at all.\"\n\nWhen confined by her last illness, being visited by a Christian friend, who asked her whether he should pray for her recovery, she replied, \"Pray that the Lord's will may be done concerning me, I desire not anything contrary to his will, life or death.\" And thus she departed, committing herself into the hands of Christ, knowing in whom she had believed, and being fully persuaded he was able to keep that she had committed to him against that day.\n</blockquote>\n\n[[File:The Great North Road, through Sutton-on-Trent.jpg|thumb|173x173px|The [[Great North Road (Great Britain)|Great North Road]], through Sutton-on-Trent]]\nAlthough the Baptist denomination has long since ceased to be active in the village, an interesting coincidence is that the present (2018) residents of the old chapel were actually married in a Baptist church.\n\nIn 1870\u20131872,<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/7780  Sutton on Trent Nottinghamshire \u2013 at  A Vision of Britain through Time].</ref> Sutton on Trent was described as:\n<blockquote>\nA village and a parish in [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire|Southwell]] district, [[Nottinghamshire|Notts]].
