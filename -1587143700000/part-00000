Filipino Religious Consciousness.

Religion among Tagalogs was intimately intertwined with their day-to-day lives, as Almocera points out:<blockquote>''Aside from their own social structure, they believed in an invisible society coexisting with their own. This society, they believed, was inhabited by spirits that included dead ancestors, deities, and lesser gods.  Pre-Hispanic Filipinos honored these spirits with rituals and feast days because these supernatural beings were considered able to preside over the whole gamut of life, including birth, sickness, death, courtship, marriage, planting, harvesting, and death.  Some of these spirits were considered friendly; others were viewed as tyrannical enemies.''<ref name=\"Almocera2005\"/></blockquote>\n\nAncient Tagalogs initially believed that the first deity of the sun and moon was [[Bathala]], as he is a primordial deity and the deity of everything. Later on, the title of deity of the moon was passed on to his favorite daughter, Mayari, while the title of deity of the sun was passed on to his grandson and honorary son, Apolaki. One of his daughters, [[Tala (goddess)|Tala]] is the deity of the stars and is the primary deity of the constellations, while Hanan was the deity of mornings and the new age. The Tagalog cosmic beliefs is not exempted from the moon-swallowing serpent myths prevalent throughout the different ethnic peoples of the Philippines. But unlike the moon-swallowing serpent stories of other ethnic peoples, which usually portrays the serpent as a god, the Tagalog people believe that the serpent which causes eclipses is a monster dragon, called ''Laho'', instead. The dragon, despite being strong, can easily be defeated by Mayari, the reason why the moon's darkness during eclipses is diminishes within minutes.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/laho-moon-eater/</ref>\n\n== \"Pag-aanito\": \"offering\" or \"act of worship\" ==\nBecause of the limitations of language and of personal religious biases, Spanish chroniclers often recorded different interpretations of Tagalog words relating to worship. The word \"anito\" is one of these words which had differing interpreters. Scott<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> notes that missionaries eventually reinterpreted the word to mean \"all idols\", including the middle eastern gods mentioned in the bible, whenever they were included in their homilies. As a result, in modern times, the word \"anito\" has come to mean the various figurines or \"idols\" which represent Filipino deities. However, the Tagalog words for such representations was \"''larauan''\".<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\nIn his 1613 Dictionary ''[[Vocabulario de la lengua tagala]]'', Fray Pedro de San Buenaventura<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\">{{cite book | title=Vocabulario de la lengua tagala | author=Buenaventura , Pedro de San | authorlink=Pedro de San Buenaventura | year=1613 | location=[[Pila, Laguna]]}}</ref>{{rp|page=361}} explains:<blockquote>''More appropriately  would it be called an offering because ''\"anito\"'' does not signify any particular thing, such as an idol, but an offering and the prayer  they would make to deceased friends and relatives... [or] an offering made to anything they finished, like a boat, house, fishnet, etc., and it was mats, cooked foodk, gold, and other things.''</blockquote>\n\nThe unnamed author of the anonymous 1572 \"''Relaci\u00f3n de la conquista de la isla de Luz\u00f3n''\" (translated in Volume 3 of Blair and Robertson),<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\">{{Cite book|title=Relation of the Conquest of the Island of Luzon|work=The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898|publisher=Arthur H.

When the guests are all assembled and the feast set forth in a few plates on the ground inside the house, they seat themselves also on the ground to eat. In the midst of the feast (called manganito or bayl\u00e1n in their tongue), they put the idol called Batala and certain aged women who are considered as priestesses, and some aged Indians\u2014neither more nor less. They offer the idol some of the food which they are eating, and call upon him in their tongue, praying to him for the health of the sick man for whom the feast is held. The natives of these islands have no altars nor temples whatever. This manganito, or drunken revel, to give it a better name, usually lasts seven or eight days; and when it is finished they take the idols and put them in the corners of the house, and keep them there without showing them any reverence.\"''</blockquote>\n\n== \"Bathala\": the \"almighty\" or \"creator\" ==\n{{main|Bathala}}\nAccording to the early Spanish missionaries, the Tagalog people believed in a creator-god named \"''Bathala''\",<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/> whom they referred to both as ''maylicha'' (creator; lit. \"actor of creation\") and ''maycapal'' (lord, or almighty; lit. \"actor of power\"). Loarca and Chirino reported that in some places, this creator god was called \"''Molaiari''\" (Malyari) or \"''Dioata''\" (Diwata).<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> Scott (1989) notes:<blockquote>''\"Bathala was described as \"may kapal sa lahat [maker of everything],\" kapal meaning to mould something between the hands like clay or wax.\"''<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/></blockquote>\n\nFrancisco Demetrio, Gilda Cordero Fernando, and Fernando Nakpil Zialcita summarize a number of Tagalog beliefs regarding Bathala: <blockquote>\"''The Tagalogs called their supreme god Bathala Maykapal or Lumikha (The Creator). An enormous being, he could not straighten up due to the lowness of the sky. And the sun burned brightly near him. One day, Bathala got a bolo and pierced one of the sun's eyes so that it could generate just enough heat to sustain life. At last, Bathala was able to straighten up and with his hands pushed the cooler sky to its present level. Bathala is also known as the grand conserver of the universe, the caretaker of things from whom all providence comes, hence the beautiful word 'bahala' or 'mabahala' meaning 'to care'.''\"</blockquote>\n\nThe missionaries who observed the Tagalog peoples in the 1500s noted, however that the Tagalogs did not include Bathala in their daily acts of worship (pag-a-anito). Fray Buenaventura noted in the ''[[Vocabulario de la lengua tagala]] '' that the Tagalogs believed Bathala was too mighty and distant to be bothered with the concerns of mortal man, and so the Tagalogs focused their acts of appeasement to the immediate spirits which they believed had control over their day-to-day life.<ref name=\"Maggay1999\"/>\n\n== Other deities and powers ==\nBecause Bathala was considered a \"distant\" entity, the Tagalog people focused their attention more on some scholars term to be \"lesser\" deities and powers,<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/> which could be more easily influenced than Bathala.<ref name=\"Maggay1999\"/>\n\nBecause the Tagalogs did not have a collective word to describe all these spirits together, Spanish missionaries eventually decided to call them \"anito,\" since they were the subject of the Tagalog's act of ''pag-aanito'' (worship). According to Scott, a careful search of sources from the 1500s reveals that:<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><blockquote>''\"there was no single word in Tagalog for the other deities to whom Bathala was superior: when necessary, Spanish lexicographers referred to them all as anito.\"''<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Scott, accounts and early dictionaries describe them as intermediaries (\"Bathala's agents\"), and the dictionaries used the word \"abogado\" (advocate) when defining their realms. These sources also show, however, that in practice, they were addressed directly: \"''in actual prayers, they were petitioned directly, not as intermediaries.''\" Scott cites the example of a farmer's prayer to Lakapati, where a child would be held over a field, and the farmer would pray: \"''Lakapati, pakanin mo yaring alipin mo; huwag mong gutumin'' [Lakapati feed this thy slave; let him not hunger]\"<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\"/>{{rp|page=361}}\n\nDemetrio, Fernando and Zialcita, in their 1991 reader \"The Soul Book\", categorize these spirits broadly into \"Ancestor spirits\" and \"non-ancestor spirits, but then further sub-categorize them into: \"Ancestor spirits, nature spirits, and guardian spirits.\"<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/>\n\n=== Tagalog spirits described in early firsthand accounts===\nScott, drawing from firsthand accounts and descriptions in early dictionaries, describes some of these Tagalog spirits specifically:\n* '''Lakan Bakod''' was \"''the lord of fences (bakod),\"''and ''\"was invoked to keep animals out of swiddens''\".<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> Scott quotes San Buenaventura<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\"/>{{rp|page=361}} as saying Lakanbakod's larauan (image/idol) \"''had gilded genitals as long as a rice stalk\", and \"was offered eels when fencing swiddens - because, they said, his were the strongest of all fences.''\" \n* '''Aman Sinaya''' was an ancestor spirit who was invoked by Fishermen as a guardian spirit. Scott notes that he was \"the inventor of fishing gear, [and] was named when first wetting a net or fish hook\"<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n* '''Lakapati''' \"was worhipped in the fields at planting time\" and \"was fittingly represented by a hermaphrodite image with both male and female parts\"<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n* '''Aman Ikabli''', the patron of hunters\n* '''Dian Masalanta''', the patron of lovers and childbirth. \n* '''Mankukutod''', protector of coconut palms, given an offering by Tuba tappers before climbing a tree,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> lest they fall from the trunk.  \n* '''Uwinan Sana''', guardian of grasslands or forests,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> acknowledged as overlord of grasslands or forests whenever entering them, to avoid being regarded as trespassers.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n* '''Lakambini''', the advocate (Spanish dictionaries used the term \"abogado\")<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> of the throat, was invoked in case of throat ailments.\n* '''Haik''', the sea God, called upon by seamen in a major ceremony,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> asking for fair weather and favorable winds.  \n* lesser deities like '''Linga''' and '''Bibit''', who caused illness if not given recognition in the ordinary course of daily activities.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\n== Katalonan (priests or priestess) ==\n{{main|Katalonan}}\nThe priest or priestess of the Tagalogs and Kapampangans were called \"Katalonan\" (also spelled Catalonan; or Catulunan in [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]]), and was equivalent of the [[Visayans|Visayan]] term \"[[Babaylan]].\" The term apparently springs from the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word \"''katalo''\", which means \"''in good terms with'',\" such that the Catalonan are those \"in good terms with the [[Anito]] spirits\".<ref name=\"Maggay1999\"/>\n\nHistorian and Spanish Missionary [[Pedro Chirino|Pedro Chirino, SJ]] noted that their long hair is a symbol of their commitment to their religion.<ref name=\"Chirino1604\">Chirino, Pedro (1604).

Although the behaviors of numerous birds and lizards were said to be omens, particular attention was paid to the tigmamanukan.\n\nAccording to San Buenaventura's Dictionary,<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\"/> the Tagalogs believed that the direction of a tigmamanukan flying across one's path at the beginning a journey indicated the undertaking's result. If it flew from right to left, the expedition would be a success. This sign was called \"''labay''\", a term still present in some Filipino languages with the meaning \"proceed\". If the bird flew from left to right, the travelers would surely never return.\n\nIt was also said that if a hunter caught a tigmamanukan in a trap, they would cut its beak and release it, saying \"''Kita ay iwawala, kun akoy mey kakawnan, lalabay ka.''\" (\"You are free, so when I set forth, sing on the right.\")\n\nWhile the name \"tigmamanukan\" is no longer used today, some early western explorers say that the specific bird referred to by the name is a fairy bluebird (genus ''[[fairy-bluebird|Irena]]'', family ''[[Irenidae]]'').

The first is known as the ''kakambal'' (literally means twin), which is the soul of the living. Every time a person sleeps, the ''kakambal'' may travel to many mundane and supernatural places which sometimes leads to nightmares if a terrible event is encountered while the ''kakambal'' is travelling. When a person dies, the ''kakambal'' is ultimately transformed into the second form of the Tagalog soul, which is the ''kaluluwa'' (literally means spirit). In traditional Tagalog religion, the ''kaluluwa'' then travels to either ''Kasanaan'' (if the person was evil when he was living) or ''Maca'' (if the person was good when he was living). Both domains are ruled by [[Bathala]], though Kasanaan is also ruled by the deity of souls.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/soul-according-ethnolinguistic-groups-philippines/</ref>\n\nDue to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, Roman Catholicism was forcefully introduced to the Tagalog. In Roman Catholicism, a good person is sent to Heaven while a bad person is sent to Hell to burn in scalding oil.\n\n== Dream beliefs ==\nThe Tagalog people traditionally believe that when a person sleeps, he may or may not dream the omens of [[Bathala]]. The omens are either hazy illusions within a dream, the appearance of an omen creature such as [[tigmamanukan]], or sightings from the future. The dream omens do not leave traces on what a person must do to prevent or let the dream come true as it is up to the person to make the proper actions to prevent or make the dream come true. The omen dreams are only warnings and possibilities 'drafted by Bathala'.\n\nAdditionally, a person may sometimes encounter nightmares in dreams. There are two reasons why nightmares occur, the first is when the ''kakambal'' soul encounters a terrifying event while travelling from the body, or when a ''[[Batibat|bangungot]]'' creature sits on top of the sleeping person in a bid of vengeance due to the cutting of her tree home. Majority of the nightmares are said to be due to the ''kakambal'' soul encountering terrifying events while travelling.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/soul-according-ethnolinguistic-groups-philippines/</ref><ref>https://vanwinkles.com/11-mythical-sleep-creatures-from-around-the-world</ref>\n\n== Traditional burial practices ==\nThe Tagalog people had numerous burial practices prior to Spanish colonization and Catholic introduction. In rural areas of [[Cavite]], trees are used as burial places. The dying person chooses the tree beforehand, thus when he or she becomes terminally ill or is evidently going to die because old age, a hut is built close to the said tree. The deceased's corpse is then entombed vertically inside the hollowed-out tree trunk. Before colonization, a statue known as ''likha'' is also entombed with the dead inside the tree trunk. In [[Mulanay, Quezon]] and nearby areas, the dead are entombed inside limestone sarcophagi along with a ''likha'' statue. However, the practice vanished in the 16th century due to Spanish colonization. In [[Calatagan, Batangas]] and nearby areas, the dead are buried under the earth along with ''likha'' statues. The statues, measuring 6-12 inches, are personified depictions of ''anitos''. ''Likha'' statues are not limited to burial practices as they are also used in homes, prayers, agriculture, medicine, travel, and other means.<ref name=\"DPPS\">Tacio, Henrylito D.

Jocano (2001) notes:<blockquote>''\"Except for a few artifacts and identified loanwords that have been accepted as proofs of Indian-Philippine relations, there are meager intrusive materials to sustain definite views concerning the range of Indian prehistoric influence in the country. Many generalizations [that] have so far been advanced merely obscure the basic issues of Philippine cultural development. Even archeological data, mostly trade items, must be critically evaluated before they are judged as evidence of direct contacts.\"''<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>{{rp|pages=138\u2013139}}</blockquote>\n\nHe notes that the various streams of the evidence which support the assertion that this influence reached the Philippines include:<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/> ''\"Syllabic writing; artifacts in the form of different figurines made of clay, gold, and bronze that were dug in various sites in the Philippines; and 336 loanwords identified by Professor Francisco to be Sanskrit in origin, with 150 of them identified as the origin of some major Philippine terms.\"''\n\nRegardless of how and when it actually happened, historiographers specializing in Southeast Asia note that this \"influence\" was cultural and religious, rather than military or political in nature. For example, Osborne, in his 2004 history of Southeast Asia, notes:<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/>{{rp|page=23}}<blockquote>''Beginning in the 2nd and third centuries C.E. there was a slow expansion of [Indian] cultural contacts with the Southeast Asian region. It was an uneven process, with some areas receiving Indian influence much later than others, and the degree of influence varying from century to century. [...]Indianization did not mean there was a mass migration of Indian population into sea. Rather, a relatively limited number of traders and priest scholars brought Indian culture in its various forms to Southeast Asia where much, but not all, of this culture was absorbed by the local population and joined to their existing cultural patterns.''</blockquote>\n\nOsborne further emphasizes that this \"indianization\" of Southeast Asia did not per-se overwrite existing indigenous patterns, cultures, and beliefs: <blockquote>\"''Because Indian culture \u201ccame\u201d to Southeast Asia, one must not think that Southeast Asians lacked a culture of their own. Indeed, the generally accepted view is that Indian culture made such an impact on Southeast Asia because it fitted easily with the existing cultural patterns and religious beliefs of populations that had already moved a considerable distance along the path of civilization.[\u2026] Southeast Asians, to summarize the point, borrowed but they also adapted. In some very important cases, they did not need to borrow at all.''\"<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/>{{rp|page=24}}</blockquote>\n\nHistoriographers, both from Southeast Asia in general,<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/> and the Philippines specifically<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><ref name=\"Jocano2001\">{{cite book  | last = Jocano  | first = F.

For a different reason \u2013 distant geographical location \u2013 neither did the Philippines participate in this process.\"''</blockquote>\n\nJocano furthers:<blockquote>''\"The Philippines is geographically outside the direct line of early commerce between India and the rest of Southeast Asia. Moreover, the island world of Indonesia, with Sumatra and Java controlling the traffic of trade, functioned as a sieve for whatever influence (cultural, social, and commercial) India might have had to offer beyond the Indonesian archipelago.[...]Thus, it can be said that Indian Influence filtered into the Philippines only indirectly.''\"<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>{{rp|page=139}}</blockquote>\n\nAfter reviewing threads of evidence for the various views concerning the date and mechanism of \"Indian prehistoric influence in the country\", Jocano concludes: <blockquote>''\"Philippine-Indonesian relations during precolonial times became intensified during the rise of the Madjapahit Empire. It was during this time that much of the so-called Indian cultural influence reached the Philippines through Indonesia. But what penetrated into our country, particularly in the seaport communities, was already the modified version of the original Hindu cultural traits.\"''<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>{{rp|page=142}}</blockquote>\n\n\n\nFray Diego de Herrera noted that inhabitants in some villages were \"Muslim in name only\", and sborne also notes that the Luzones who visited [[Portuguese Malacca]] in the 1510s to 1540s were \"nominally Muslim\".<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/> The unnamed author of the Anonymous 1572 ''Relaci\u00f3n''<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\"/> goes into further detail:<blockquote>''\"In the villages nearest the sea some do not eat pork, the reason for their not eating it, which I have already given, being that, in trading with the Moros of Burney, the latter have preached to them some part of the nefarious doctrine of Mahoma, charging them not to eat pork. [....] When[...]any of them are asked why they do not eat it, they say that they do not know why; and if one asks them who Mahoma was and what his law commands, they say that they do not know the commandment or anything about Mahoma, not even his name; nor do they know what his law is, nor whence it came. It is true that some of them who have been in Burney understand some of it, and are able to read a few words of the Alcor\u00e1n; but these are very few, and believe that he who has not been in Burney may eat pork, as I have heard many of them say.\"''<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\"/></blockquote>\n\n== Present day beliefs ==\nModern day scholars such as Scott,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> Jocano,<ref name=\"Jocano1975\">F.

Religion among Tagalogs was intimately intertwined with their day-to-day lives, as Almocera points out:<blockquote>''Aside from their own social structure, they believed in an invisible society coexisting with their own. This society, they believed, was inhabited by spirits that included dead ancestors, deities, and lesser gods.  Pre-Hispanic Filipinos honored these spirits with rituals and feast days because these supernatural beings were considered able to preside over the whole gamut of life, including birth, sickness, death, courtship, marriage, planting, harvesting, and death.  Some of these spirits were considered friendly; others were viewed as tyrannical enemies.''<ref name=\"Almocera2005\"/></blockquote>\n\nAncient Tagalogs initially believed that the first deity of the sun and moon was [[Bathala]], as he is a primordial deity and the deity of everything. Later on, the title of deity of the moon was passed on to his favorite daughter, Mayari, while the title of deity of the sun was passed on to his grandson and honorary son, Apolaki. One of his daughters, [[Tala (goddess)|Tala]] is the deity of the stars and is the primary deity of the constellations, while Hanan was the deity of mornings and the new age. The Tagalog cosmic beliefs is not exempted from the moon-swallowing serpent myths prevalent throughout the different ethnic peoples of the Philippines. But unlike the moon-swallowing serpent stories of other ethnic peoples, which usually portrays the serpent as a god, the Tagalog people believe that the serpent which causes eclipses is a monster dragon, called ''Laho'', instead. The dragon, despite being strong, can easily be defeated by Mayari, the reason why the moon's darkness during eclipses is diminishes within minutes.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/laho-moon-eater/</ref>\n\n== \"Pag-aanito\": \"offering\" or \"act of worship\" ==\nBecause of the limitations of language and of personal religious biases, Spanish chroniclers often recorded different interpretations of Tagalog words relating to worship. The word \"anito\" is one of these words which had differing interpreters. Scott<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> notes that missionaries eventually reinterpreted the word to mean \"all idols\", including the middle eastern gods mentioned in the bible, whenever they were included in their homilies. As a result, in modern times, the word \"anito\" has come to mean the various figurines or \"idols\" which represent Filipino deities. However, the Tagalog words for such representations was \"''larauan''\".<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\nIn his 1613 Dictionary ''[[Vocabulario de la lengua tagala]]'', Fray Pedro de San Buenaventura<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\">{{cite book | title=Vocabulario de la lengua tagala | author=Buenaventura , Pedro de San | authorlink=Pedro de San Buenaventura | year=1613 | location=[[Pila, Laguna]]}}</ref>{{rp|page=361}} explains:<blockquote>''More appropriately  would it be called an offering because ''\"anito\"'' does not signify any particular thing, such as an idol, but an offering and the prayer  they would make to deceased friends and relatives... [or] an offering made to anything they finished, like a boat, house, fishnet, etc., and it was mats, cooked foodk, gold, and other things.''</blockquote>\n\nThe unnamed author of the anonymous 1572 \"''Relaci\u00f3n de la conquista de la isla de Luz\u00f3n''\" (translated in Volume 3 of Blair and Robertson),<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\">{{Cite book|title=Relation of the Conquest of the Island of Luzon|work=The Philippine Islands, 1493-1898|publisher=Arthur H.

When the guests are all assembled and the feast set forth in a few plates on the ground inside the house, they seat themselves also on the ground to eat. In the midst of the feast (called manganito or bayl\u00e1n in their tongue), they put the idol called Batala and certain aged women who are considered as priestesses, and some aged Indians\u2014neither more nor less. They offer the idol some of the food which they are eating, and call upon him in their tongue, praying to him for the health of the sick man for whom the feast is held. The natives of these islands have no altars nor temples whatever. This manganito, or drunken revel, to give it a better name, usually lasts seven or eight days; and when it is finished they take the idols and put them in the corners of the house, and keep them there without showing them any reverence.\"''</blockquote>\n\n== \"Bathala\": the \"almighty\" or \"creator\" ==\n{{main|Bathala}}\nAccording to the early Spanish missionaries, the Tagalog people believed in a creator-god named \"''Bathala''\",<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/> whom they referred to both as ''maylicha'' (creator; lit. \"actor of creation\") and ''maycapal'' (lord, or almighty; lit. \"actor of power\"). Loarca and Chirino reported that in some places, this creator god was called \"''Molaiari''\" (Malyari) or \"''Dioata''\" (Diwata).<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> Scott (1989) notes:<blockquote>''\"Bathala was described as \"may kapal sa lahat [maker of everything],\" kapal meaning to mould something between the hands like clay or wax.\"''<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/></blockquote>\n\nFrancisco Demetrio, Gilda Cordero Fernando, and Fernando Nakpil Zialcita summarize a number of Tagalog beliefs regarding Bathala: <blockquote>\"''The Tagalogs called their supreme god Bathala Maykapal or Lumikha (The Creator). An enormous being, he could not straighten up due to the lowness of the sky. And the sun burned brightly near him. One day, Bathala got a bolo and pierced one of the sun's eyes so that it could generate just enough heat to sustain life. At last, Bathala was able to straighten up and with his hands pushed the cooler sky to its present level. Bathala is also known as the grand conserver of the universe, the caretaker of things from whom all providence comes, hence the beautiful word 'bahala' or 'mabahala' meaning 'to care'.''\"</blockquote>\n\nThe missionaries who observed the Tagalog peoples in the 1500s noted, however that the Tagalogs did not include Bathala in their daily acts of worship (pag-a-anito). Fray Buenaventura noted in the [[Vocabulario de la lengua tagala]] that the Tagalogs believed Bathala was too mighty and distant to be bothered with the concerns of mortal man, and so the Tagalogs focused their acts of appeasement to the immediate spirits which they believed had control over their day-to-day life.<ref name=\"Maggay1999\"/>\n\n== Other deities and powers ==\nBecause Bathala was considered a \"distant\" entity, the Tagalog people focused their attention more on some scholars term to be \"lesser\" deities and powers,<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/> which could be more easily influenced than Bathala.<ref name=\"Maggay1999\"/>\n\nBecause the Tagalogs did not have a collective word to describe all these spirits together, Spanish missionaries eventually decided to call them \"anito,\" since they were the subject of the Tagalog's act of ''pag-aanito'' (worship). According to Scott, a careful search of sources from the 1500s reveals that:<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><blockquote>''\"there was no single word in Tagalog for the other deities to whom Bathala was superior: when necessary, Spanish lexicographers referred to them all as anito.\"''<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/></blockquote>\n\nAccording to Scott, accounts and early dictionaries describe them as intermediaries (\"Bathala's agents\"), and the dictionaries used the word \"abogado\" (advocate) when defining their realms. These sources also show, however, that in practice, they were addressed directly: \"''in actual prayers, they were petitioned directly, not as intermediaries.''\" Scott cites the example of a farmer's prayer to Lakapati, where a child would be held over a field, and the farmer would pray: \"''Lakapati, pakanin mo yaring alipin mo; huwag mong gutumin'' [Lakapati feed this thy slave; let him not hunger]\"<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\"/>{{rp|page=361}}\n\nDemetrio, Fernando and Zialcita, in their 1991 reader \"The Soul Book\", categorize these spirits broadly into \"Ancestor spirits\" and \"non-ancestor spirits, but then further sub-categorize them into: \"Ancestor spirits, nature spirits, and guardian spirits.\"<ref name=\"SoulBook1991\"/>\n\n=== Tagalog spirits described in early firsthand accounts===\nScott, drawing from firsthand accounts and descriptions in early dictionaries, describes some of these Tagalog spirits specifically:\n* '''Lakan Bakod''' was \"''the lord of fences (bakod),\"''and ''\"was invoked to keep animals out of swiddens''\".<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> Scott quotes San Buenaventura<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\"/>{{rp|page=361}} as saying Lakanbakod's larauan (image/idol) \"''had gilded genitals as long as a rice stalk\", and \"was offered eels when fencing swiddens - because, they said, his were the strongest of all fences.''\" \n* '''Aman Sinaya''' was an ancestor spirit who was invoked by Fishermen as a guardian spirit. Scott notes that he was \"the inventor of fishing gear, [and] was named when first wetting a net or fish hook\"<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n* '''Lakapati''' \"was worhipped in the fields at planting time\" and \"was fittingly represented by a hermaphrodite image with both male and female parts\"<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n* '''Aman Ikabli''', the patron of hunters\n* '''Dian Masalanta''', the patron of lovers and childbirth. \n* '''Mankukutod''', protector of coconut palms, given an offering by Tuba tappers before climbing a tree,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> lest they fall from the trunk.  \n* '''Uwinan Sana''', guardian of grasslands or forests,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> acknowledged as overlord of grasslands or forests whenever entering them, to avoid being regarded as trespassers.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n* '''Lakambini''', the advocate (Spanish dictionaries used the term \"abogado\")<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> of the throat, was invoked in case of throat ailments.\n* '''Haik''', the sea God, called upon by seamen in a major ceremony,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> asking for fair weather and favorable winds.  \n* lesser deities like '''Linga''' and '''Bibit''', who caused illness if not given recognition in the ordinary course of daily activities.<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/>\n\n== Katalonan (priests or priestess) ==\n{{main|Katalonan}}\nThe priest or priestess of the Tagalogs and Kapampangans were called \"Katalonan\" (also spelled Catalonan; or Catulunan in [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]]), and was equivalent of the [[Visayans|Visayan]] term \"[[Babaylan]].\" The term apparently springs from the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word \"''katalo''\", which means \"''in good terms with'',\" such that the Catalonan are those \"in good terms with the [[Anito]] spirits\".<ref name=\"Maggay1999\"/>\n\nHistorian and Spanish Missionary [[Pedro Chirino|Pedro Chirino, SJ]] noted that their long hair is a symbol of their commitment to their religion.<ref name=\"Chirino1604\">Chirino, Pedro (1604).

Although the behaviors of numerous birds and lizards were said to be omens, particular attention was paid to the tigmamanukan.\n\nAccording to San Buenaventura's Dictionary,<ref name=\"Buenaventura1613\"/> the Tagalogs believed that the direction of a tigmamanukan flying across one's path at the beginning a journey indicated the undertaking's result. If it flew from right to left, the expedition would be a success. This sign was called \"''labay''\", a term still present in some Filipino languages with the meaning \"proceed\". If the bird flew from left to right, the travelers would surely never return.\n\nIt was also said that if a hunter caught a tigmamanukan in a trap, they would cut its beak and release it, saying \"''Kita ay iwawala, kun akoy mey kakawnan, lalabay ka.''\" (\"You are free, so when I set forth, sing on the right.\")\n\nWhile the name \"tigmamanukan\" is no longer used today, some early western explorers say that the specific bird referred to by the name is a fairy bluebird (genus ''[[fairy-bluebird|Irena]]'', family ''[[Irenidae]]'').

The first is known as the ''kakambal'' (literally means twin), which is the soul of the living. Every time a person sleeps, the ''kakambal'' may travel to many mundane and supernatural places which sometimes leads to nightmares if a terrible event is encountered while the ''kakambal'' is travelling. When a person dies, the ''kakambal'' is ultimately transformed into the second form of the Tagalog soul, which is the ''kaluluwa'' (literally means spirit). In traditional Tagalog religion, the ''kaluluwa'' then travels to either ''Kasanaan'' (if the person was evil when he was living) or ''Maca'' (if the person was good when he was living). Both domains are ruled by [[Bathala]], though Kasanaan is also ruled by the deity of souls.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/soul-according-ethnolinguistic-groups-philippines/</ref>\n\nDue to the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century, Roman Catholicism was forcefully introduced to the Tagalog. In Roman Catholicism, a good person is sent to Heaven while a bad person is sent to Hell to burn in scalding oil.\n\n== Dream beliefs ==\nThe Tagalog people traditionally believe that when a person sleeps, he may or may not dream the omens of [[Bathala]]. The omens are either hazy illusions within a dream, the appearance of an omen creature such as [[tigmamanukan]], or sightings from the future. The dream omens do not leave traces on what a person must do to prevent or let the dream come true as it is up to the person to make the proper actions to prevent or make the dream come true. The omen dreams are only warnings and possibilities 'drafted by Bathala'.\n\nAdditionally, a person may sometimes encounter nightmares in dreams. There are two reasons why nightmares occur, the first is when the ''kakambal'' soul encounters a terrifying event while travelling from the body, or when a ''[[Batibat|bangungot]]'' creature sits on top of the sleeping person in a bid of vengeance due to the cutting of her tree home. Majority of the nightmares are said to be due to the ''kakambal'' soul encountering terrifying events while travelling.<ref>https://www.aswangproject.com/soul-according-ethnolinguistic-groups-philippines/</ref><ref>https://vanwinkles.com/11-mythical-sleep-creatures-from-around-the-world</ref>\n\n== Traditional burial practices ==\nThe Tagalog people had numerous burial practices prior to Spanish colonization and Catholic introduction. In rural areas of [[Cavite]], trees are used as burial places. The dying person chooses the tree beforehand, thus when he or she becomes terminally ill or is evidently going to die because old age, a hut is built close to the said tree. The deceased's corpse is then entombed vertically inside the hollowed-out tree trunk. Before colonization, a statue known as ''likha'' is also entombed with the dead inside the tree trunk. In [[Mulanay, Quezon]] and nearby areas, the dead are entombed inside limestone sarcophagi along with a ''likha'' statue. However, the practice vanished in the 16th century due to Spanish colonization. In [[Calatagan, Batangas]] and nearby areas, the dead are buried under the earth along with ''likha'' statues. The statues, measuring 6-12 inches, are personified depictions of ''anitos''. ''Likha'' statues are not limited to burial practices as they are also used in homes, prayers, agriculture, medicine, travel, and other means.<ref name=\"DPPS\">Tacio, Henrylito D.

Jocano (2001) notes:<blockquote>''\"Except for a few artifacts and identified loanwords that have been accepted as proofs of Indian-Philippine relations, there are meager intrusive materials to sustain definite views concerning the range of Indian prehistoric influence in the country. Many generalizations [that] have so far been advanced merely obscure the basic issues of Philippine cultural development. Even archeological data, mostly trade items, must be critically evaluated before they are judged as evidence of direct contacts.\"''<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>{{rp|pages=138\u2013139}}</blockquote>\n\nHe notes that the various streams of the evidence which support the assertion that this influence reached the Philippines include:<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/> ''\"Syllabic writing; artifacts in the form of different figurines made of clay, gold, and bronze that were dug in various sites in the Philippines; and 336 loanwords identified by Professor Francisco to be Sanskrit in origin, with 150 of them identified as the origin of some major Philippine terms.\"''\n\nRegardless of how and when it actually happened, historiographers specializing in Southeast Asia note that this \"influence\" was cultural and religious, rather than military or political in nature. For example, Osborne, in his 2004 history of Southeast Asia, notes:<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/>{{rp|page=23}}<blockquote>''Beginning in the 2nd and third centuries C.E. there was a slow expansion of [Indian] cultural contacts with the Southeast Asian region. It was an uneven process, with some areas receiving Indian influence much later than others, and the degree of influence varying from century to century. [...]Indianization did not mean there was a mass migration of Indian population into sea. Rather, a relatively limited number of traders and priest scholars brought Indian culture in its various forms to Southeast Asia where much, but not all, of this culture was absorbed by the local population and joined to their existing cultural patterns.''</blockquote>\n\nOsborne further emphasizes that this \"indianization\" of Southeast Asia did not per-se overwrite existing indigenous patterns, cultures, and beliefs: <blockquote>\"''Because Indian culture \u201ccame\u201d to Southeast Asia, one must not think that Southeast Asians lacked a culture of their own. Indeed, the generally accepted view is that Indian culture made such an impact on Southeast Asia because it fitted easily with the existing cultural patterns and religious beliefs of populations that had already moved a considerable distance along the path of civilization.[\u2026] Southeast Asians, to summarize the point, borrowed but they also adapted. In some very important cases, they did not need to borrow at all.''\"<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/>{{rp|page=24}}</blockquote>\n\nHistoriographers, both from Southeast Asia in general,<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/> and the Philippines specifically<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/><ref name=\"Jocano2001\">{{cite book  | last = Jocano  | first = F.

For a different reason \u2013 distant geographical location \u2013 neither did the Philippines participate in this process.\"''</blockquote>\n\nJocano furthers:<blockquote>''\"The Philippines is geographically outside the direct line of early commerce between India and the rest of Southeast Asia. Moreover, the island world of Indonesia, with Sumatra and Java controlling the traffic of trade, functioned as a sieve for whatever influence (cultural, social, and commercial) India might have had to offer beyond the Indonesian archipelago.[...]Thus, it can be said that Indian Influence filtered into the Philippines only indirectly.''\"<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>{{rp|page=139}}</blockquote>\n\nAfter reviewing threads of evidence for the various views concerning the date and mechanism of \"Indian prehistoric influence in the country\", Jocano concludes: <blockquote>''\"Philippine-Indonesian relations during precolonial times became intensified during the rise of the Madjapahit Empire. It was during this time that much of the so-called Indian cultural influence reached the Philippines through Indonesia. But what penetrated into our country, particularly in the seaport communities, was already the modified version of the original Hindu cultural traits.\"''<ref name=\"Jocano2001\"/>{{rp|page=142}}</blockquote>\n\n\n\nFray Diego de Herrera noted that inhabitants in some villages were \"Muslim in name only\", and sborne also notes that the Luzones who visited [[Portuguese Malacca]] in the 1510s to 1540s were \"nominally Muslim\".<ref name=\"Osborne2004\"/> The unnamed author of the Anonymous 1572 ''Relaci\u00f3n''<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\"/> goes into further detail:<blockquote>''\"In the villages nearest the sea some do not eat pork, the reason for their not eating it, which I have already given, being that, in trading with the Moros of Burney, the latter have preached to them some part of the nefarious doctrine of Mahoma, charging them not to eat pork. [....] When[...]any of them are asked why they do not eat it, they say that they do not know why; and if one asks them who Mahoma was and what his law commands, they say that they do not know the commandment or anything about Mahoma, not even his name; nor do they know what his law is, nor whence it came. It is true that some of them who have been in Burney understand some of it, and are able to read a few words of the Alcor\u00e1n; but these are very few, and believe that he who has not been in Burney may eat pork, as I have heard many of them say.\"''<ref name=\"B&R3Anonymous1572\"/></blockquote>\n\n== Present day beliefs ==\nModern day scholars such as Scott,<ref name=\"Scott1994\"/> Jocano,<ref name=\"Jocano1975\">F.

Gorospe, S.J., Chrisitian Renewal of Filipino Values. Manila: Ateneo de Manila University Press, 1966. 37.</ref> agree that the Indigenous religious beliefs of the Tagalog people persist even to this day, in the form of folk religion.\n\nFor example, Almocera notes that:  <blockquote>''The encounter with Spanish-Catoholic Christianity did little to change the worldview held by the Pre-Hispanic Filipinos . It resulted, however, in the formation of a folk religion: namely Filipino \"Folk Catholicism,\" a syncretistic form of  which still exists.''</blockquote>\n\nScott, in his seminal 1994 work, \"Barangay: Sixteenth-century Philippine Culture and Society\", notes that there are striking similarities between accounts from the 1500s vis a vis modern folk beliefs today. He describes the account of Miguel de Loarca account, in particular, to be: <blockquote>''\"remarkable in that it sounds like what is now called folk Catholicism.\"''</blockquote>\n \nCatholic Scholar Fr. Vitaliano R.

After the commercial disappointment of the band's [[Experimental music|experimental]] 1983 album ''[[Dazzle Ships (album)|Dazzle Ships]]'', OMD and Virgin intended for the band to shift toward a more accessible sound on its follow-up release. The record spawned four singles, including the UK Top 20 chart hits \"[[Locomotion (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Locomotion]]\" and \"[[Talking Loud and Clear]]\".\n\n==Background==\nCore members Humphreys and McCluskey decided to move away from their own \"Gramophone Suite\" studios in [[Liverpool]], starting on new tracks instead in Highland Studios in [[Inverness]] and in [[Lincolnshire]].<ref name=\"Junk Culture Deluxe booklet notes\">Junk Culture Deluxe booklet notes.</ref> The group then performed a short series of live shows in September 1983<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omd-live.com/1983|title=OMD - 1983 gigs: 6-10 September 1983 |publisher= omd-live.com|accessdate= 2016-09-01}}</ref> partly in order to reassure their public and also to showcase the new tracks. These included early versions of \"All Wrapped Up\", \"Tesla Girls\", \"Junk Culture\", \"Never Turn Away\", \"The Avenue\" and \"Heaven Is\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omd-live.com/1983-bootlegs|title=OMD gig history index - 1983: 9th September 1983 - Manchester The Factory Club, UK |publisher= omd-live.com|accessdate= 2016-09-01}}</ref> The group then returned to the studio with producer Brian Tench.\n\nA single release was briefly considered for the end of 1983 but rejected by Virgin Records who insisted the band concentrate on the album production. The band and Tench then moved on to [[Air Studios]] in [[Montserrat]], the tropical climate and ambiance giving rise among other things the reworking of early track \"Wrappup\" into the calypso style \"All Wrapped Up\". Fundamental to the album's sound was also the [[Fairlight CMI]] sampler keyboard which the group started using in Montserrat.<ref name=\"Junk Culture Deluxe booklet notes\"/>\nThe group then returned to Europe to finish off the album at [[Wisseloord Studios]] in the Netherlands.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Producer [[Tony Visconti]], known for his work with [[David Bowie]], was also recruited to work on the album, his main contribution being the addition and arrangement of [[Brass instrument|brass]] parts on \"All Wrapped Up\" and [[Locomotion (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Locomotion]],<ref name=\"Junk Culture Deluxe booklet notes\"/> the last track to be completed and the first to be released as a single prior to the album.\n\n==Release==\n''Junk Culture'' was released on 30 April 1984 and entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] a week later, the same week that the single \"[[Locomotion (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Locomotion]]\" was at its chart peak of no. 5. Limited pressings of the vinyl LP came with a free one-sided 7\" single featuring the track \"(The Angels Keep Turning) The Wheels of the Universe\", thus boosting initial sales. The album entered the UK chart at no. 9, outselling the new album by contemporaries [[The Cure]] (''[[The Top (album)|The Top]]''), although beaten by fellow [[Liverpool|Liverpudlians]] [[Echo & the Bunnymen]] whose ''[[Ocean Rain]]'' entered at no. 4.

album by English [[electronic music]] band [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] (OMD), released on 30 April 1984 by [[Virgin Records]]. After the commercial disappointment of the band's [[Experimental music|experimental]] 1983 album ''[[Dazzle Ships (album)|Dazzle Ships]]'', OMD and Virgin intended for the band to shift toward a more accessible sound on its follow-up release. The record spawned four singles, including the UK Top 20 chart hits \"[[Locomotion (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Locomotion]]\" and \"[[Talking Loud and Clear]]\".\n\n==Background==\nCore members Humphreys and McCluskey decided to move away from their own \"Gramophone Suite\" studios in [[Liverpool]], starting on new tracks instead in Highland Studios in [[Inverness]] and in [[Lincolnshire]].<ref name=\"Junk Culture Deluxe booklet notes\">Junk Culture Deluxe booklet notes.</ref> The group then performed a short series of live shows in September 1983<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omd-live.com/1983|title=OMD - 1983 gigs: 6-10 September 1983 |publisher= omd-live.com|accessdate= 2016-09-01}}</ref> partly in order to reassure their public and also to showcase the new tracks. These included early versions of \"All Wrapped Up\", \"Tesla Girls\", \"Junk Culture\", \"Never Turn Away\", \"The Avenue\" and \"Heaven Is\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omd-live.com/1983-bootlegs|title=OMD gig history index - 1983: 9th September 1983 - Manchester The Factory Club, UK |publisher= omd-live.com|accessdate= 2016-09-01}}</ref> The group then returned to the studio with producer Brian Tench.\n\nA single release was briefly considered for the end of 1983 but rejected by Virgin Records who insisted the band concentrate on the album production. The band and Tench then moved on to [[Air Studios]] in [[Montserrat]], the tropical climate and ambiance giving rise among other things the reworking of early track \"Wrappup\" into the calypso style \"All Wrapped Up\". Fundamental to the album's sound was also the [[Fairlight CMI]] sampler keyboard which the group started using in Montserrat.<ref name=\"Junk Culture Deluxe booklet notes\"/>\nThe group then returned to Europe to finish off the album at [[Wisseloord Studios]] in the Netherlands.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Producer [[Tony Visconti]], known for his work with [[David Bowie]], was also recruited to work on the album, his main contribution being the addition and arrangement of [[Brass instrument|brass]] parts on \"All Wrapped Up\" and [[Locomotion (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Locomotion]],<ref name=\"Junk Culture Deluxe booklet notes\"/> the last track to be completed and the first to be released as a single prior to the album.\n\n==Release==\n''Junk Culture'' was released on 30 April 1984 and entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] a week later, the same week that the single \"[[Locomotion (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark song)|Locomotion]]\" was at its chart peak of no. 5. Limited pressings of the vinyl LP came with a free one-sided 7\" single featuring the track \"(The Angels Keep Turning) The Wheels of the Universe\", thus boosting initial sales. The album entered the UK chart at no. 9, outselling the new album by contemporaries [[The Cure]] (''[[The Top (album)|The Top]]''), although beaten by fellow [[Liverpool|Liverpudlians]] [[Echo & the Bunnymen]] whose ''[[Ocean Rain]]'' entered at no. 4.

The following is a '''list of the messaging applications which were developed for Nintendo's consoles'''.\n\n==PictoChat==\n{{Infobox online service\n|title        = PictoChat\n|logo         = [[File:Pictochat logo.png|200px]]\n|developer   = [[Nintendo]]\n|type         = [[LAN messenger]]\n|update       = March 22, 2012 ([[Nintendo DSi system software#System Update releases|details]])\n|status       = \n|released     = {{Video game release|NA|November 21, 2004|JP|December 2, 2004|AUS|February 24, 2005|EU|March 11, 2005}}\n|platform     = [[Nintendo DS]]<br/>[[Nintendo DS Lite]]<br/>[[Nintendo DSi]]<br/>[[Nintendo DSi XL]]<br />[[Nintendo 3DS Homebrew]]\n|members      = \n|website      = \n}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''''PictoChat'''''|\u30d4\u30af\u30c8\u30c1\u30e3\u30c3\u30c8|PikutoChatto}} is a communication utility that comes pre-installed on the [[Nintendo DS]], [[Nintendo DS Lite]] and [[Nintendo DSi]] consoles. Up to sixteen people can paint and/or text chat with each other using it, connected wirelessly through a [[Local area network|LAN]]-only, system-to-system wireless connection. It allows for simple input of keyboard text and written text/drawings. PictoChat received an Excellence Prize for Entertainment at the 2004 [[Japan Media Arts Festival]].\n\n=== Functions ===\n[[Image:Pictochat.png|left|155px|thumb|Interface]]\nThe Nintendo DS touch screen is used to type in letters with an on-screen keyboard or to draw and send pictures. Text can also be manually placed on the screen, if the user drags the selected character onto the message area. Messages sent from the DS or DS Lite appear in black, while DSi systems feature an additional \"rainbow\" pen (see the last paragraph of functions). The pen tool offers small and large sizes. The keyboard provides enough [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[kana]] glyphs to write in all languages supported by the system: [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], plus [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].The pictochat system can only send messages in a radius of 10 meters.\n\nPictoChat displays the name and message managed in System Settings to all the users in the same chat room.\n\nFour [[chat room]]s (A, B, C & D) are available at one time, each with a capacity of sixteen people, for a maximum of sixty-four people in total of all the chat rooms.\n\nPictoChat is preloaded onto all [[Nintendo DS]], [[Nintendo DS Lite]], [[Nintendo DSi]], and [[Nintendo DSi|Nintendo DSi XL]] units worldwide.\n\nOn the DSi versions of PictoChat, a rainbow pen can be used by tapping on the pen icon again once it has been selected. Content created using the rainbow pen can be read by PictoChat users on Nintendo DS Lite and original Nintendo DS systems. Additionally, the DS and DS Lite play a special sound when receiving a message written by a DSi user.\nThe console plays a special sound and displays a special message when a user joins on their birthday.\n\n===Super Smash Bros. appearances===\nA stage based on PictoChat appears in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''. Another stage called \"PictoChat 2\" appears in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS]]'', and is exclusive to the portable variant. An HD version of \"PictoChat 2\" returns in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.\n\n=== PictoChat animation ===\nAlthough not an official function, PictoChat has been used to create short animations by drawing individual pictures on the Nintendo DS's touch screen and sending them frame by frame to the message board on the top screen. By pressing and holding down the left shoulder button and right shoulder button respectively to scroll through the pictures, it shows them at a frame rate of 7.5 frames per second, creating the illusion of animation. Several online galleries are dedicated to sharing PictoChat animations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/oddities/art/animated-ds-pictochat-drawings-037597.php|title=Oddities: Animated DS Pictochat Drawings|accessdate=2008-02-27|last=Crecente|first=Brian|date=2005-03-30|publisher=Kotaku|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120728222744/http://kotaku.com/37597/animated-ds-pictochat-drawings?tag=gamingodditiesart|archivedate=2012-07-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Kanji Sonomama Rakubiki Jiten ===\nThe Nintendo DS [[kanji]]-[[English language|English]]-[[Japanese language|Japanese]] dictionary {{nihongo|'[[Kanji Sonomama Rakubiki Jiten]]'|\u6f22\u5b57\u305d\u306e\u307e\u307e\u697d\u5f15\u8f9e\u5178}} contains an extension to PictoChat that allows users to input kanji characters in addition to the standard character set.

Users could also use WiiConnect24 to trade messages and pictures with other Wii owners, conventional email accounts (email pictures to console, but not pictures to email), and mobile phones (through text messages). Each Wii has an individual wii.com email account containing the Wii Number. Prior to trading messages it is necessary to add and approve contacts in the address book, although the person added will not get an automatic notification of the request, and must be notified by other means. The service also alerts all users of incoming game-related information.\n\nThe Wii Message Board was available for users to post messages that are available to other Wii users by usage of Wii Numbers with [[WiiConnect24]].  In addition to writing text, players could also include images from an SD card in the body of messages, as well as attaching a [[Mii]] to the message. Announcements of software updates and video game news was posted by Nintendo. The Message Board can be used for posting memos for oneself or for family members without going online. These messages could then be put on any day of the calendar. The Wii Message Board could also be updated automatically by a real-time game like ''[[Animal Crossing: City Folk|Animal Crossing]]''.\n\n''[[Wii Sports]]'', ''[[Wii Play]]'', ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'', ''[[Wii Speak Channel]]'', ''[[Wii Sports Resort]]'', ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' & ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]''  use the Message Board to update the player on any new high scores or gameplay advancements, such as medal placements in the former two titles, completions of races including a photo, audio messages, and letters from the Mailtoad via the Wii message board. ''[[Metroid Prime 3: Corruption]]'', ''Super Mario Galaxy'', ''Super Smash Bros Brawl'', ''[[Elebits]]'', ''[[Animal Crossing: City Folk]]'', ''[[Dewy's Adventure]]'' and the Virtual Console game ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Snap]]'' allow players to take screenshots and post them to the Message Board to edit later or send to friends via messages. Except for [[Nintendo GameCube]] games, the Message Board also records the play history in the form of \"Today's Accomplishments\".

Up to sixteen people can paint and/or text chat with each other using it, connected wirelessly through a [[Local area network|LAN]]-only, system-to-system wireless connection. It allows for simple input of keyboard text and written text/drawings. PictoChat received an Excellence Prize for Entertainment at the 2004 [[Japan Media Arts Festival]].\n\n=== Functions ===\n[[Image:Pictochat.png|left|155px|thumb|Interface]]\nThe Nintendo DS touch screen is used to type in letters with an on-screen keyboard or to draw and send pictures. Text can also be manually placed on the screen, if the user drags the selected character onto the message area. Messages sent from the DS or DS Lite appear in black, while DSi systems feature an additional \"rainbow\" pen (see the last paragraph of functions). The pen tool offers small and large sizes. The keyboard provides enough [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] and [[kana]] glyphs to write in all languages supported by the system: [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]], plus [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]].The pictochat system can only send messages in a radius of 10 meters.\n\nPictoChat displays the name and message managed in System Settings to all the users in the same chat room.\n\nFour [[chat room]]s (A, B, C & D) are available at one time, each with a capacity of sixteen people, for a maximum of sixty-four people in total of all the chat rooms.\n\nPictoChat is preloaded onto all [[Nintendo DS]], [[Nintendo DS Lite]], [[Nintendo DSi]], and [[Nintendo DSi|Nintendo DSi XL]] units worldwide.\n\nOn the DSi versions of PictoChat, a rainbow pen can be used by tapping on the pen icon again once it has been selected. Content created using the rainbow pen can be read by PictoChat users on Nintendo DS Lite and original Nintendo DS systems. Additionally, the DS and DS Lite play a special sound when receiving a message written by a DSi user.\nThe console plays a special sound and displays a special message when a user joins on their birthday.\n\n===Super Smash Bros. appearances===\nA stage based on PictoChat appears in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]''. Another stage called \"PictoChat 2\" appears in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS]]'', and is exclusive to the portable variant. An HD version of \"PictoChat 2\" returns in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]''.\n\n=== PictoChat animation ===\nAlthough not an official function, PictoChat has been used to create short animations by drawing individual pictures on the Nintendo DS's touch screen and sending them frame by frame to the message board on the top screen. By pressing and holding down the left shoulder button and right shoulder button respectively to scroll through the pictures, it shows them at a frame rate of 7.5 frames per second, creating the illusion of animation. Several online galleries are dedicated to sharing PictoChat animations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/oddities/art/animated-ds-pictochat-drawings-037597.php|title=Oddities: Animated DS Pictochat Drawings|accessdate=2008-02-27|last=Crecente|first=Brian|date=2005-03-30|publisher=Kotaku|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120728222744/http://kotaku.com/37597/animated-ds-pictochat-drawings?tag=gamingodditiesart|archivedate=2012-07-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Kanji Sonomama Rakubiki Jiten ===\nThe Nintendo DS [[kanji]]-[[English language|English]]-[[Japanese language|Japanese]] dictionary {{nihongo|'[[Kanji Sonomama Rakubiki Jiten]]'|\u6f22\u5b57\u305d\u306e\u307e\u307e\u697d\u5f15\u8f9e\u5178}} contains an extension to PictoChat that allows users to input kanji characters in addition to the standard character set.
