This is slightly lower than in the four pro-European groups, but higher than in the [[European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left]] (GUE/NGL) and far higher than in the [[Europe of Freedom and Democracy]] (EFD) groups. Internal cohesion was highest in votes on constitutional and inter-institutional affairs (94.79%), international trade, and industry, research & energy. The greatest divergence within the group was in decisions on regional development (70.53% cohesion), agriculture, and development (cooperation).<ref>{{Citation |url=http://term7.votewatch.eu/en/political-group-cohesion.html |title=Cohesion of (trans-national) political groups in the European Parliament |publisher=Vote Watch Europe |accessdate=2 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713035533/http://term7.votewatch.eu/en/political-group-cohesion.html |archivedate=13 July 2014 }}</ref> The parties that were most loyal to the group (meaning that they voted with the majority of ECR members the most often) were the UK Conservatives (97.51%), the Ulster Unionist Party and the Czech Civic Democratic Party.

(2009\u201314). This is slightly lower than in the four pro-European groups, but higher than in the [[European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left]] (GUE/NGL) and far higher than in the [[Europe of Freedom and Democracy]] (EFD) groups. Internal cohesion was highest in votes on constitutional and inter-institutional affairs (94.79%), international trade, and industry, research & energy.

These were considered the most widespread and most likely to be adopted by speakers from other regions.<ref name=\"prores\" /> The initial idea to select this region as a base was first proposed in [[Krste Petkov Misirkov]]'s works as he believed the Macedonian language should abstract on those dialects that are distinct from neighbouring Slavic languages, such as Bulgarian and Serbian.<ref>Dedai\u0107, Mirjana N. et al. ''South Slavic Discourse Particles''; John Benjamins Publishing (2010) p. 13</ref> Likewise, this view does not take into account the fact that a Macedonian [[koin\u00e9 language]] was already in existence.<ref name=\"Comrie251\">{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=251}}</ref>\n\nBased on a large group of features, Macedonian dialects can be divided into Eastern, Western and Northern groups (the boundary geographically runs approximately from [[Skopje]] and [[Skopska Crna Gora]] along the rivers [[Vardar]] and Crna).<ref name=\"u103\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=103}}</ref> There are numerous [[isogloss]]es between these dialectal variations, with structural differences in phonetics, prosody (accentuation), morphology and syntax.<ref name=\"u103\" /> \n\nVariations in consonants occur between the two groups, with most Western regions losing the /x/ and the /v/ in intervocalic position (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430'' (head): /\u0261lava/  = /\u0261la/: ''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438'' (heads): /\u0261lavi/ = /\u0261laj/) while Eastern dialects preserve it. Stress in the Western dialects is generally fixed and falls on the antepenultimate syllable while Eastern dialects have non-fixed stress systems that can fall on any syllable of the word,<ref name=\"usikova110\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=111}}</ref> that is also reminiscent of Bulgarian dialects. Additionally, Eastern dialects are distinguishable by their fast tonality, [[elision]] of sounds and the suffixes for definiteness. The Northern dialectal group is close to South Serbian and [[Torlakian dialects]] and is characterized by 46\u201347 phonetic and grammatical isoglosses.<ref name=\"u104\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=104}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, a more detailed classification can be based on the modern reflexes of the [[Proto-Slavic]] reduced vowels ([[yer]]s), vocalic sonorants, and the back nasal *\u01eb. That classification distinguishes between the following 6 groups:<ref>{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=247}}</ref>\n\nWestern Dialects:\n* '''Ohrid-Prespa Group''': [[Ohrid dialect]], [[Struga dialect]], [[Vev\u010dani-Rado\u017eda dialect]], [[Upper Prespa dialect]] and [[Lower Prespa dialect]].\n* '''Debar Group''': [[Debar dialect]], [[Reka dialect]], [[Drimkol-Golo Brdo dialect]], [[Gali\u010dnik dialect]], [[Skopska Crna Gora dialect]] and [[Na\u0161inski|Gora dialect]]\n* '''Polog Group''': [[Upper Polog dialect]], [[Lower Polog dialect]], [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]], [[Ki\u010devo-Pore\u010de dialect]] and [[Skopje-Veles dialect]]\n* '''Kostur-Kor\u010da Group''': [[Kor\u010da dialect]], [[Kostur dialect]] and [[Nestram-Kostenar dialect]]\n\nEastern Dialects:\n* '''Northern Group''': [[Kumanovo dialect]], [[Kratovo dialect]], [[Kriva Palanka dialect]] and [[Ov\u010de Pole dialect]]\n* '''Eastern Group''': [[\u0160tip - Ko\u010dani dialect]], [[Strumica dialect]], [[Tikve\u0161-Mariovo dialect]], [[Male\u0161evo-Pirin dialect]],  [[Solun-Voden dialect]] and [[Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Listen\n| type          = speech\n| header        = \n| filename      = Prilep-Bitola dialect speech - Bitola.ogg\n| title         = Bitola dialect\n| description   = Spoken Macedonian in a folk story as spoken in the dialect of [[Bitola]]\n| filename2     = Prilep-Bitola dialect speech - Topol\u010dani.ogg\n| title2        = Prilep dialect\n| description2  = Spoken Macedonian in a folk story as spoken in the dialect of [[Prilep]]\n\n}}\n{{main|Macedonian phonology}}\nThe [[phonology|phonological]] system of Standard Macedonian is based on the [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]].

The individual letters of [[acronyms]] are pronounced with the schwa in the same way: {{angbr|[[Macedonian Orthodox Church|\u041c\u041f\u0426]]}} ({{IPA|[m\u0259.p\u0259.t\u0361s\u0259]}}).

[[Vowel length]] is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllablic words with stress on the penultimate can be realized as long, e.g. {{angbr|\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441}} {{IPA-mk|\u02c8v\u025b\u02d0l\u025bs||Mk-Veles.ogg}} '[[Veles (city)|Veles]]'.

In other words, two vowels appearing next to each other can also be pronounced twice separately (e.g. ''\u043f\u043e\u043e\u0434\u0438'' - to walk).<ref name=\"usikova111\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=111}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n|+ Vowels<ref name=\"Friedman 2001 10\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Lunt|1952|pp=10\u201311}}</ref>\n!\n!

The dental nasal ({{IPA|/n/}}) and dental lateral ({{IPA|/\u026b/}}) are also syllabic in certain foreign words; e.g. {{angbr|\u045a\u0443\u0442\u043d}} {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0272utn\u0329]}} '[[Newton (unit)|newton]]', {{angbr|\u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0442\u043b}} {{IPA|[p\u0254p\u0254ka\u02c8t\u025bp\u025bt\u026b\u0329]}} '[[Popocat\u00e9petl]]', etc. The [[labiodental nasal]] {{IPA|[\u0271]}} occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/m/}} before {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} (e.g. {{angbr|\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0432\u0430\u0458}} {{IPA|[\u02c8tra\u0271vaj]}} '[[tram]]'). The [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} similarly occur as an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} (e.g. {{angbr|\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438}} {{IPA|[\u02c8a\u014b\u0261liski]}} 'English'). The latter realization is avoided by some speakers who strive for a clear, formal pronunciation.\n\n===Stress===\nThe [[Stress (linguistics)|word stress]] in Macedonian is {{linktext|antepenultimate}} and dynamic (expiratory). This means that it falls on the third from last [[syllable]] in words with three or more syllables, and on the first or only syllable in other words. This is sometimes disregarded when the word has entered the language more recently or from a foreign source.<ref name=\"usikova109\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=109-110}}</ref> To note which syllable of the word should be accented, Macedonian uses an apostrophe over its vowels. [[Disyllabic]] words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable: ''\u0434\u00e9\u0442\u0435'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8d\u025bt\u025b]}}: child), ''\u043c\u00e1\u0458\u043a\u0430'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8majka]}}): mother) and ''\u0442\u00e1\u0442\u043a\u043e'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8tatk\u0254]}}: father). [[Trisyllabic]] and [[polysyllabic]] words are stressed on the third-to-last syllable: ''\u043f\u043b\u00e1\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8p\u026banina]}}: mountain) ''\u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u045d\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430'' ({{IPA|[p\u026ba\u02c8ninata]}}: the mountain) ''\u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d\u00e1\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435'' ({{IPA|[p\u026bani\u02c8narit\u025b]}}: the mountaineers).<ref name=\"usikova109\" /> There are several exceptions to the rule and they include: [[Participle|verbal adverbs]] (i.e. words suffixed with ''-\u045c\u0438''): e.g. ''\u0432\u0438\u043a\u00e1\u0458\u045c\u0438'' ({{IPA|[vi\u02c8kajci]}}: shouting), ''\u043e\u0434\u00e9\u0458\u045c\u0438'' ({{IPA|[\u0254\u02c8d\u025bjci]}}: walking); adverbs of time: ''\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u00e1\u0432\u0430'' ({{IPA|[godi\u02c8nava]}}: this year), ''\u043b\u0435\u0442\u00f3\u0432\u043e'' ({{IPA|[le\u02c8tovo]}}: this summer); foreign [[loanword]]s: e.g. ''\u043a\u043b\u0438\u0448\u00e9'' ({{IPA|[kli\u02c8\u0283\u025b]}}:clich\u00e9), ''\u0433\u0435\u043d\u00e9\u0437\u0430'' ({{IPA|[\u0261\u025b\u02c8n\u025bza]}} genesis), ''\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u00fd\u0440\u0430'' ({{IPA|[lit\u025bra\u02c8tura]}}: literature), ''\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u00e1\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440'' ({{IPA|[al\u025bk\u02c8sandar]}}, [[Alexander]]).\n\nLinking occurs when two or more words are pronounced with only stress and is a common feature of the Macedonian language. This linguistic phenomenon is called ''\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0442'' and is denoted with a (\u035c ) sign. Several words are taken as a single unit and thus follow the rules of the stress falling on the antepenultimate syllable. The rule applies when using [[clitics]] (either enclitics or proclitics) such as the negating particle ''\u043d\u0435'' with verbs (''\u0442\u043e\u0458 \u043d\u00e9  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'', he did not come) and with short pronoun forms or the future particle ''\u045c\u0435'' are used in-between (''\u043d\u0435  \u035c  \u043c\u0443  \u035c  \u0458\u00e1  \u035c  \u0434\u0430\u0434\u0435'', did not give it to him; ''\u043d\u0435  \u035c  \u045c\u00e9  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'', he will not come).<ref name=\"matura\" /> Other uses include the [[imperative form]] accompanied by short pronoun forms (''\u0434\u00e1\u0458  \u035c  \u043c\u0438'': give me), the expression of possessives (''\u043c\u00e1\u0458\u043a\u0430  \u035c  \u043c\u0438''), prepositions followed by a noun (''\u0437\u00e1\u0434  \u035c  \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430''), question words followed by verbs (''\u043a\u043e\u0433\u00e1  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435''), some compound nouns (''\u0441\u0443\u0432\u00f3  \u035c  \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0458\u0435'' - raisins, ''\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043b\u00f3  \u035c  \u043c\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e'' - yoghurt) and others.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Macedonian grammar}}\n\nMacedonian grammar is markedly [[Analytic language|analytic]] in comparison with other Slavic languages, having lost the common Slavic case system. The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an [[auxiliary verb]] \"to have\", followed by a [[past tense|past]] [[participle]] in the [[Neuter gender|neuter]], also known as the [[verbal adjective]].\n\n===Nouns===\nMacedonian [[noun]]s (''\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438'') belong to one of three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural), and marginally for [[grammatical case|case]]. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=40}}</ref> Masculine nouns usually end in a consonant or a vowel (''-a'', ''-o''  or ''-e'') and neuter nouns end in a vowel (''-o'' or ''-e''). Virtually all feminine nouns end in the same consonant, ''-a''.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe [[vocative]] of nouns is the only remaining case in the Macedonian language and is used to address a person directly. The vocative case always ends with a vowel, which can be either an -\u0443 (''\u0458\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0443'': hero vocative) or an -e (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435'': man vocative) to the root of masculine nouns. For feminine nouns, the most common final vowel ending in the vocative is -o (''\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e'', sweetheart vocative; ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e'', wife vocative). The final suffix -e can be used in the following cases: three or polysyllabic words with the ending ''-\u0438\u0446\u0430'' (''\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0447\u0438\u0446\u0435'', mother vocative), female given names that end with ''-\u043a\u0430'': ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430'' becomes ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435'' and ''-\u0458\u0430'': ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430'' becomes ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0435'' or ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u043e''. There is no vocative case in neuter nouns. The role of the vocative is only facultative and there is a general tendency of vocative loss in the language since its use is considered impolite and dialectal.<ref name=\"periods23\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|page=23}}</ref> The vocative can also be expressed by changing the tone.<ref name=\"matura\">{{cite book|last=Bogdanoska|first=Biljana|year=2008|title=\u0417\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a \u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430|trans-title=Macedonian language and literature for students|language=mk|publisher=Bomat Grafiks|location=[[Skopje]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Minova Gjurkova|first=Liljana|title=\u0421\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a|trans-title=Syntax of the standard Macedonian language|language=mk|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nThere are three different types of plural: regular, counted and [[collective noun|collective]]. The first plural type is most common and used to indicate regular plurality of nouns: ''\u043c\u0430\u0436 - \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'' (a man - men), ''\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0430 - \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0438'' (a table - table), ''\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e - \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430'' (a village - villages). There are various suffixes that are used and they differ per noun gender. Counted plural is used when a number or a [[quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] precedes the noun; suffixes to express this type of plurality do not correspond with the regular plurality suffixes: ''\u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430'' (two pencils), ''\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430'' (three leaves), ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430'' (several hours). The collective plural is used for nouns that can be viewed as a single unit: ''\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0458\u0435'' (a pile of leaves), ''\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0458\u0435'' (a unit of hills).

As with other Slavic languages, there is no [[indefinite article]] in Macedonian. The [[definite article]] in Macedonian is postpositive, i.e. it is added as a suffix to nouns. An individual feature of the Macedonian language is the use of three [[definite article]]s, inflected for gender and related to the position of the object, which can be unspecified, proximate or distal.\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0432, -\u0432\u0430, -\u0432\u043e, -\u0432\u0435'' are used for objects located close to the speaker (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a'''\u043e\u0432''''': - this person here)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u043d, -\u043d\u0430, -\u043d\u043e, -\u043d\u0435'' are used for objects located further away from the speaker that can still be perceived (''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430''''': - that woman there)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0442, -\u0442\u0430, -\u0442\u043e, -\u0442\u0435'' are most commonly used as general indicators of definiteness regardless of the referred object's position (''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''': the child). Additionally, these suffixes can be used to indicate objects referred to by the speaker that are in the proximity of the listener, e.g. ''\u0434\u0430\u0458 \u043c\u0438 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u0434\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435'' - give me the book next to you.<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n[[Proper nouns]] are per definition definite and are not usually used together with an article, although exceptions exist in the spoken and literary language such as ''\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' to demonstrate feelings of [[endearment]] to a person.\n\n===Pronouns===\nThree types of pronouns can be distinguished in Macedonian: [[personal pronouns|personal]] (''\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438''), [[relative pronouns|relative]] (''\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438'') and [[demonstrative pronouns|demonstrative]] (''\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438''). Case relations are marked in pronouns.\n\nPersonal pronouns in Macedonian appear in three genders and both in singular and plural. They can also appear either as [[accusative|direct]] or [[dative|indirect object]] in long or short forms. Depending on whether a definite direct or indirect object is used, a [[clitic pronoun]] will refer to the object with the verb: ''\u0408\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0458\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"I did not give the book to the boy\").<ref name=\"periods437\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|Garry|2001|page=437}}</ref> The direct object is a remnant of the accusative case and the indirect of the dative. Reflexive pronouns also have forms for both direct and indirect objects: ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0435'', ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438''. Examples of personal pronouns are shown below:\n*Personal pronoun: '''''\u0408\u0430\u0441''' \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043c \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430''.

(\"He told me to come\")\n\nRelative pronouns can refer to a person (''\u043a\u043e\u0458, \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0435'' - who), objects (''\u0448\u0442\u043e'' - which) or serve as indicators of possession (''\u0447\u0438\u0458, \u0447\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u0447\u0438\u0435'' - whose) in the function of a question or a relative word. These pronouns are inflected for gender and number and other word forms can be derived from them (''\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0458'' - nobody, ''\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0442\u043e'' - something, ''\u0441\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0458'' - everybody's). There are three groups of demonstrative pronouns that can indicate proximate (''\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0458'' - this one (mas.)), distal (''\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0430'' - the one there (fem.)) and unspecific (''\u0442\u043e\u0430'' - that one (neut.)) objects.

Macedonian verbs are conventionally divided into three main conjugations according to the [[thematic vowel]] used in the [[citation form]] (i.e. {{Smallcaps|{{lc:[[Grammatical person|3p]]-[[Present tense|pres]]-[[Grammatical number|sg]]}}}}).<ref name=\"opsta\">{{Harvnb|Bojkovska|2008|page=?}}</ref> These groups are: ''a''-group, ''e''-group and ''\u0438''-group. Furthermore, the ''\u0438''-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: \u0430-, \u0435- and \u0438-subgroups. The verb ''\u0441\u0443\u043c'' (to be) is the only exception to the rule as it ends with a consonant. \n\nThe perfect tense can be formed using both to be (''\u0441\u0443\u043c'') and to have (''\u0438\u043c\u0430''). The first form conjugates the verb to be per person and uses a past active participle: ''\u0441\u0443\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'' (\"I have seen a lot of things\"). The latter form makes use of a clitic that agrees in number and gender with the object of the sentence and the passive participle of the verb in its uninflected form (''\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043c\u043e\u0442'', \"I have seen that movie\").<ref name=\"u107\" /><ref name=\"periods33\" /> Another past form, the aorist is used to describe actions that have finished at a given moment in the past: ''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432'' (\"I walked\"), ''\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0430'' (\"they jumped\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nFuture forms of verbs are conjugated using the particle ''\u045c\u0435'' followed by the verb conjugated in the present tense, ''\u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will go). To express negation in the future, the construction can either be formed by adding the negation particle at the beginning ''\u043d\u0435 \u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will not go) or using the construction ''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430'' (''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'') with no difference in meaning. Another tense is the future-in-the-past tense which is formed using the clitic ''\u045c\u0435'' and a past tense of the verb conjugated for person, ''\u0442\u0430\u0430 \u045c\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435'' (\"she would have left\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Aspect, transitiveness, mood====\nSimilar to other Slavic languages, Macedonian verbs have a [[grammatical aspect]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434'') that is a [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|typical feature of Slavic languages]]. Per this category, verbs can be divided into [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (''\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') and [[perfective aspect|perfective]] (''\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') indicating actions whose time duration is unknown or occur repetitively or those that show an action that is finished in one moment. The former group of verbs can be subdivided into verbs which take place without interruption (e.g. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043b \u0434\u0435\u043d'', \"He sleeps all day long) or those that signify repeated actions (e.g. ''\u0408\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0435'', \"He was looking for the book but he could not find it\"). Perfective verbs are usually formed by adding prefixes to the stem of the verb, depending on which, they can express actions that took place in one moment (''\u0447\u0443\u043a\u043d\u0430'', \"knocked\"), actions that have just begun (''\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0430'', \"start to sing\"), actions that have ended (''\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430'', \"read\") or partial actions that last for short periods of time (''\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'', \"worked\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe contrast between transitive and intransitive verbs can be expressed analytically or syntactically and virtually all verbs denoting actions performed by living beings can become transitive if a short personal pronoun is added: ''\u0422\u043ej \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430'' (\"He laid down\") vs. ''\u0422\u043ej \u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"He laid the child down\"). Additionally, verbs which are expressed with the reflexive pronoun ''\u0441\u0435'' can become transitive by using any of the contracted pronoun forms for the direct object: ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u0441\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - He is laughing, vs. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u043c\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - \"He is making me laugh\"). Some verbs such as sleep or die do not traditionally have the property of being transitive.<ref name=\"u117/>\n\nMacedonian verbs have three [[grammatical moods]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d''): [[indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[conditional mood|conditional]]. The imperative mood can express both a wish or an order to finish a certain action. The imperative only has forms for the second person and is formed using the suffixes ''-\u0458'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458''; sing) or ''-\u0438'' (''\u043e\u0434\u0438'', walk) for singular and ''-\u0458\u0442\u0435'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458\u0442\u0435'', sing) or ''-\u0435\u0442\u0435'' for plural (''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', walk). The first and third subject forms in singular and plural express indirect orders and are conjugated using ''\u0434\u0430'' or ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430'' and the verb in present tense (''\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e'', may we live long). In addition to its primary functions, the imperative is used to indicate actions in the past, eternal truths as is the case in sayings and a condition. The Macedonian conditional is conjugated in the same way for all three persons using the particle ''\u0431\u0438'' and the verbal l-form,  ''\u0431\u0438 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b'' (I/you/he would read).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n===Syntax and prepositions===\nMacedonian syntax has a [[subject-verb-object]] (SVO) [[word order]] which is nevertheless flexible and can be [[tropicalization|tropicalized]].<ref name=\"gramatika\" /> For instance, the sentence ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d'' (Marija loves Ivan) can become of the [[object\u2013verb\u2013subject]] (OVS) form as well, ''\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430''.<ref name=\"u116\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=116}}</ref> Tropicalization can also be achieved using a combination of word order and intonation; as an example all of the following sentences give a different point of emphasis:\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the subject)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on both the subject and the verb)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the verb and the object)<ref name=\"Friedman50\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=50}}</ref>\n\nMacedonian is a [[null-subject language]] which means that the subject pronoun can be omitted, for instance ''\u0428\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0448 (\u0442\u0438)?''

In the fourteenth century, the Ottoman Turks invaded and conquered most of the Balkans, incorporating Macedonia into the [[Ottoman Empire]].

During this time, Yugoslav Macedonia became known as [[Vardar Banovina]] (Vardar province) and the language of public life, education and the church was Serbo-Croatian.

The Macedonian language was proclaimed the official language of the Republic of Macedonia at the First Session of the Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia, held on 2 August 1944. The first official Macedonian grammar was developed by Krume Kepeski. One of the most important contributors in the standardisation of the Macedonian literary language was [[Bla\u017ee Koneski]]. The first document written in the literary standard Macedonian language is the first issue of the ''[[Nova Makedonija]]'' newspaper in 1944. ''Makedonska Iskra'' (Macedonian Spark) was the first Macedonian newspaper published in Australia, from 1946 to 1957. Its articles were not in standard Macedonian but in local [[Slavic dialects of Greece]]. A monthly with national distribution, it commenced in Perth and later moved to Melbourne and Sydney.

These were considered the most widespread and most likely to be adopted by speakers from other regions.<ref name=\"prores\" /> The initial idea to select this region as a base was first proposed in [[Krste Petkov Misirkov]]'s works as he believed the Macedonian language should abstract on those dialects that are distinct from neighbouring Slavic languages, such as Bulgarian and Serbian.<ref>Dedai\u0107, Mirjana N. et al. ''South Slavic Discourse Particles''; John Benjamins Publishing (2010) p. 13</ref> Likewise, this view does not take into account the fact that a Macedonian [[koin\u00e9 language]] was already in existence.<ref name=\"Comrie251\">{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=251}}</ref>\n\nBased on a large group of features, Macedonian dialects can be divided into Eastern, Western and Northern groups (the boundary geographically runs approximately from [[Skopje]] and [[Skopska Crna Gora]] along the rivers [[Vardar]] and Crna).<ref name=\"u103\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=103}}</ref> There are numerous [[isogloss]]es between these dialectal variations, with structural differences in phonetics, prosody (accentuation), morphology and syntax.<ref name=\"u103\" /> \n\nVariations in consonants occur between the two groups, with most Western regions losing the /x/ and the /v/ in intervocalic position (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430'' (head): /\u0261lava/  = /\u0261la/: ''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438'' (heads): /\u0261lavi/ = /\u0261laj/) while Eastern dialects preserve it. Stress in the Western dialects is generally fixed and falls on the antepenultimate syllable while Eastern dialects have non-fixed stress systems that can fall on any syllable of the word,<ref name=\"usikova110\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=111}}</ref> that is also reminiscent of Bulgarian dialects. Additionally, Eastern dialects are distinguishable by their fast tonality, [[elision]] of sounds and the suffixes for definiteness. The Northern dialectal group is close to South Serbian and [[Torlakian dialects]] and is characterized by 46\u201347 phonetic and grammatical isoglosses.<ref name=\"u104\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=104}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, a more detailed classification can be based on the modern reflexes of the [[Proto-Slavic]] reduced vowels ([[yer]]s), vocalic sonorants, and the back nasal *\u01eb. That classification distinguishes between the following 6 groups:<ref>{{Harvnb|Comrie|Corbett|2002|p=247}}</ref>\n\nWestern Dialects:\n* '''Ohrid-Prespa Group''': [[Ohrid dialect]], [[Struga dialect]], [[Vev\u010dani-Rado\u017eda dialect]], [[Upper Prespa dialect]] and [[Lower Prespa dialect]].\n* '''Debar Group''': [[Debar dialect]], [[Reka dialect]], [[Drimkol-Golo Brdo dialect]], [[Gali\u010dnik dialect]], [[Skopska Crna Gora dialect]] and [[Na\u0161inski|Gora dialect]]\n* '''Polog Group''': [[Upper Polog dialect]], [[Lower Polog dialect]], [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]], [[Ki\u010devo-Pore\u010de dialect]] and [[Skopje-Veles dialect]]\n* '''Kostur-Kor\u010da Group''': [[Kor\u010da dialect]], [[Kostur dialect]] and [[Nestram-Kostenar dialect]]\n\nEastern Dialects:\n* '''Northern Group''': [[Kumanovo dialect]], [[Kratovo dialect]], [[Kriva Palanka dialect]] and [[Ov\u010de Pole dialect]]\n* '''Eastern Group''': [[\u0160tip - Ko\u010dani dialect]], [[Strumica dialect]], [[Tikve\u0161-Mariovo dialect]], [[Male\u0161evo-Pirin dialect]],  [[Solun-Voden dialect]] and [[Ser-Drama-Lagadin-Nevrokop dialect]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{Listen\n| type          = speech\n| header        = \n| filename      = Prilep-Bitola dialect speech - Bitola.ogg\n| title         = Bitola dialect\n| description   = Spoken Macedonian in a folk story as spoken in the dialect of [[Bitola]]\n| filename2     = Prilep-Bitola dialect speech - Topol\u010dani.ogg\n| title2        = Prilep dialect\n| description2  = Spoken Macedonian in a folk story as spoken in the dialect of [[Prilep]]\n\n}}\n{{main|Macedonian phonology}}\nThe [[phonology|phonological]] system of Standard Macedonian is based on the [[Prilep-Bitola dialect]].

For the pronunciation of the middle vowels /''\u0435''/ and /''\u043e''/ by native Macedonian speakers, various vowel sounds can be produced ranging from [\u025b] to [\u1eb9] and from [o] to [\u1ecd]. Unstressed vowels are not [[vowel reduction|reduced]], although they are pronounced more weakly and shortly than stressed ones, especially if they are found in a stressed syllable.{{sfn|Friedman|1998|p=252}}<ref name=\"gramatika\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001}}</ref> The five vowels and the letter /''\u0440''/ which acts as a [[semivowel]] when found between two consonants (e.g. ''\u0446\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0430'', \"church\"), can be syllable-forming.<ref name=\"usikova111\" /> \n\nThe [[schwa]] is phonemic in many dialects (varying in closeness to {{IPAblink|\u028c}} or {{IPAblink|\u0268}}) but its use in the standard language is marginal.<ref name=\"Friedman 2001 10\"/> When writing a dialectal word and keeping the schwa for aesthetic effect, an [[apostrophe]] is used; for example, {{angbr|\u043a\u2019\u0441\u043c\u0435\u0442}}, {{angbr|\u0441\u2019\u043d\u0446\u0435}}, etc. When spelling words letter-by-letters, each consonant is followed by the schwa sound. The individual letters of [[acronyms]] are pronounced with the schwa in the same way: {{angbr|[[Macedonian Orthodox Church|\u041c\u041f\u0426]]}} ({{IPA|[m\u0259.p\u0259.t\u0361s\u0259]}}). The lexicalized acronyms {{angbr|[[USSR|\u0421\u0421\u0421\u0420]]}} ({{IPA|[\u025bs.\u025bs.\u025bs.\u025br]}}) and {{angbr|\u041c\u0422}} ({{IPA|[\u025bm.t\u025b]}}) (a brand of cigarettes), are among the few exceptions. [[Vowel length]] is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllablic words with stress on the penultimate can be realized as long, e.g. {{angbr|\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441}} {{IPA-mk|\u02c8v\u025b\u02d0l\u025bs||Mk-Veles.ogg}} '[[Veles (city)|Veles]]'. The sequence {{IPA|/aa/}} is often realized phonetically as {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}}; e.g. {{angbr|\u0441\u0430\u0430\u0442}} {{IPA|/saat/}} {{IPA|[sa\u02d0t]}} '''colloq.'' hour', {{angbr|\u0437\u043c\u0438\u0438}} - snakes. In other words, two vowels appearing next to each other can also be pronounced twice separately (e.g. ''\u043f\u043e\u043e\u0434\u0438'' - to walk).<ref name=\"usikova111\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=111}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n|+ Vowels<ref name=\"Friedman 2001 10\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=10}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Lunt|1952|pp=10\u201311}}</ref>\n!\n!

The dental nasal ({{IPA|/n/}}) and dental lateral ({{IPA|/\u026b/}}) are also syllabic in certain foreign words; e.g. {{angbr|\u045a\u0443\u0442\u043d}} {{IPA|[\u02c8\u0272utn\u0329]}} '[[Newton (unit)|newton]]', {{angbr|\u041f\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043f\u0435\u0442\u043b}} {{IPA|[p\u0254p\u0254ka\u02c8t\u025bp\u025bt\u026b\u0329]}} '[[Popocat\u00e9petl]]', etc. The [[labiodental nasal]] {{IPA|[\u0271]}} occurs as an allophone of {{IPA|/m/}} before {{IPA|/f/}} and {{IPA|/v/}} (e.g. {{angbr|\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0432\u0430\u0458}} {{IPA|[\u02c8tra\u0271vaj]}} '[[tram]]'). The [[velar nasal]] {{IPA|[\u014b]}} similarly occur as an allophone of {{IPA|/n/}} before {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u0261/}} (e.g. {{angbr|\u0430\u043d\u0433\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0438}} {{IPA|[\u02c8a\u014b\u0261liski]}} 'English'). The latter realization is avoided by some speakers who strive for a clear, formal pronunciation.\n\n===Stress===\nThe [[Stress (linguistics)|word stress]] in Macedonian is {{linktext|antepenultimate}} and dynamic (expiratory).

The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an [[auxiliary verb]] \"to have\", followed by a [[past tense|past]] [[participle]] in the [[Neuter gender|neuter]], also known as the [[verbal adjective]].\n\n===Nouns===\nMacedonian [[noun]]s (''\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438'') belong to one of three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural), and marginally for [[grammatical case|case]]. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=40}}</ref> Masculine nouns usually end in a consonant or a vowel (''-a'', ''-o''  or ''-e'') and neuter nouns end in a vowel (''-o'' or ''-e''). Virtually all feminine nouns end in the same consonant, ''-a''.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe [[vocative]] of nouns is the only remaining case in the Macedonian language and is used to address a person directly. The vocative case always ends with a vowel, which can be either an -\u0443 (''\u0458\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0443'': hero vocative) or an -e (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435'': man vocative) to the root of masculine nouns. For feminine nouns, the most common final vowel ending in the vocative is -o (''\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e'', sweetheart vocative; ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e'', wife vocative). The final suffix -e can be used in the following cases: three or polysyllabic words with the ending ''-\u0438\u0446\u0430'' (''\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0447\u0438\u0446\u0435'', mother vocative), female given names that end with ''-\u043a\u0430'': ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430'' becomes ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435'' and ''-\u0458\u0430'': ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430'' becomes ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0435'' or ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u043e''. There is no vocative case in neuter nouns. The role of the vocative is only facultative and there is a general tendency of vocative loss in the language since its use is considered impolite and dialectal.<ref name=\"periods23\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|page=23}}</ref> The vocative can also be expressed by changing the tone.<ref name=\"matura\">{{cite book|last=Bogdanoska|first=Biljana|year=2008|title=\u0417\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a \u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0443\u0440\u0430|trans-title=Macedonian language and literature for students|language=mk|publisher=Bomat Grafiks|location=[[Skopje]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Minova Gjurkova|first=Liljana|title=\u0421\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a|trans-title=Syntax of the standard Macedonian language|language=mk|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nThere are three different types of plural: regular, counted and [[collective noun|collective]]. The first plural type is most common and used to indicate regular plurality of nouns: ''\u043c\u0430\u0436 - \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'' (a man - men), ''\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0430 - \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0438'' (a table - table), ''\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e - \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430'' (a village - villages). There are various suffixes that are used and they differ per noun gender. Counted plural is used when a number or a [[quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] precedes the noun; suffixes to express this type of plurality do not correspond with the regular plurality suffixes: ''\u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430'' (two pencils), ''\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430'' (three leaves), ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430'' (several hours). The collective plural is used for nouns that can be viewed as a single unit: ''\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0458\u0435'' (a pile of leaves), ''\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0458\u0435'' (a unit of hills).

As with other Slavic languages, there is no [[indefinite article]] in Macedonian. The [[definite article]] in Macedonian is postpositive, i.e. it is added as a suffix to nouns. An individual feature of the Macedonian language is the use of three [[definite article]]s, inflected for gender and related to the position of the object, which can be unspecified, proximate or distal.\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0432, -\u0432\u0430, -\u0432\u043e, -\u0432\u0435'' are used for objects located close to the speaker (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a'''\u043e\u0432''''': - this person here)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u043d, -\u043d\u0430, -\u043d\u043e, -\u043d\u0435'' are used for objects located further away from the speaker that can still be perceived (''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430''''': - that woman there)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0442, -\u0442\u0430, -\u0442\u043e, -\u0442\u0435'' are most commonly used as general indicators of definiteness regardless of the referred object's position (''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''': the child). Additionally, these suffixes can be used to indicate objects referred to by the speaker that are in the proximity of the listener, e.g. ''\u0434\u0430\u0458 \u043c\u0438 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u0434\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435'' - give me the book next to you.<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n[[Proper nouns]] are per definition definite and are not usually used together with an article, although exceptions exist in the spoken and literary language such as ''\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' to demonstrate feelings of [[endearment]] to a person.\n\n===Pronouns===\nThree types of pronouns can be distinguished in Macedonian: [[personal pronouns|personal]] (''\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438''), [[relative pronouns|relative]] (''\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e-\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438'') and [[demonstrative pronouns|demonstrative]] (''\u043f\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0438''). Case relations are marked in pronouns.\n\nPersonal pronouns in Macedonian appear in three genders and both in singular and plural. They can also appear either as [[accusative|direct]] or [[dative|indirect object]] in long or short forms. Depending on whether a definite direct or indirect object is used, a [[clitic pronoun]] will refer to the object with the verb: ''\u0408\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0458\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"I did not give the book to the boy\").<ref name=\"periods437\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|Garry|2001|page=437}}</ref> The direct object is a remnant of the accusative case and the indirect of the dative. Reflexive pronouns also have forms for both direct and indirect objects: ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0435'', ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438''.

(\"He told me to come\")\n\nRelative pronouns can refer to a person (''\u043a\u043e\u0458, \u043a\u043e\u0458\u0430, \u043a\u043e\u0435'' - who), objects (''\u0448\u0442\u043e'' - which) or serve as indicators of possession (''\u0447\u0438\u0458, \u0447\u0438\u0458\u0430, \u0447\u0438\u0435'' - whose) in the function of a question or a relative word.

Macedonian verbs are conventionally divided into three main conjugations according to the [[thematic vowel]] used in the [[citation form]] (i.e. {{Smallcaps|{{lc:[[Grammatical person|3p]]-[[Present tense|pres]]-[[Grammatical number|sg]]}}}}).<ref name=\"opsta\">{{Harvnb|Bojkovska|2008|page=?}}</ref> These groups are: ''a''-group, ''e''-group and ''\u0438''-group. Furthermore, the ''\u0438''-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: \u0430-, \u0435- and \u0438-subgroups. The verb ''\u0441\u0443\u043c'' (to be) is the only exception to the rule as it ends with a consonant. \n\nThe perfect tense can be formed using both to be (''\u0441\u0443\u043c'') and to have (''\u0438\u043c\u0430''). The first form conjugates the verb to be per person and uses a past active participle: ''\u0441\u0443\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'' (\"I have seen a lot of things\"). The latter form makes use of a clitic that agrees in number and gender with the object of the sentence and the passive participle of the verb in its uninflected form (''\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043c\u043e\u0442'', \"I have seen that movie\").<ref name=\"u107\" /><ref name=\"periods33\" /> Another past form, the aorist is used to describe actions that have finished at a given moment in the past: ''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432'' (\"I walked\"), ''\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0430'' (\"they jumped\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nFuture forms of verbs are conjugated using the particle ''\u045c\u0435'' followed by the verb conjugated in the present tense, ''\u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will go). To express negation in the future, the construction can either be formed by adding the negation particle at the beginning ''\u043d\u0435 \u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will not go) or using the construction ''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430'' (''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'') with no difference in meaning. Another tense is the future-in-the-past tense which is formed using the clitic ''\u045c\u0435'' and a past tense of the verb conjugated for person, ''\u0442\u0430\u0430 \u045c\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435'' (\"she would have left\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Aspect, transitiveness, mood====\nSimilar to other Slavic languages, Macedonian verbs have a [[grammatical aspect]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434'') that is a [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|typical feature of Slavic languages]]. Per this category, verbs can be divided into [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (''\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') and [[perfective aspect|perfective]] (''\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') indicating actions whose time duration is unknown or occur repetitively or those that show an action that is finished in one moment. The former group of verbs can be subdivided into verbs which take place without interruption (e.g. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043b \u0434\u0435\u043d'', \"He sleeps all day long) or those that signify repeated actions (e.g. ''\u0408\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0435'', \"He was looking for the book but he could not find it\"). Perfective verbs are usually formed by adding prefixes to the stem of the verb, depending on which, they can express actions that took place in one moment (''\u0447\u0443\u043a\u043d\u0430'', \"knocked\"), actions that have just begun (''\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0430'', \"start to sing\"), actions that have ended (''\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430'', \"read\") or partial actions that last for short periods of time (''\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'', \"worked\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe contrast between transitive and intransitive verbs can be expressed analytically or syntactically and virtually all verbs denoting actions performed by living beings can become transitive if a short personal pronoun is added: ''\u0422\u043ej \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430'' (\"He laid down\") vs. ''\u0422\u043ej \u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"He laid the child down\"). Additionally, verbs which are expressed with the reflexive pronoun ''\u0441\u0435'' can become transitive by using any of the contracted pronoun forms for the direct object: ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u0441\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - He is laughing, vs. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u043c\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - \"He is making me laugh\"). Some verbs such as sleep or die do not traditionally have the property of being transitive.<ref name=\"u117/>\n\nMacedonian verbs have three [[grammatical moods]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d''): [[indicative]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[conditional mood|conditional]]. The imperative mood can express both a wish or an order to finish a certain action. The imperative only has forms for the second person and is formed using the suffixes ''-\u0458'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458''; sing) or ''-\u0438'' (''\u043e\u0434\u0438'', walk) for singular and ''-\u0458\u0442\u0435'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458\u0442\u0435'', sing) or ''-\u0435\u0442\u0435'' for plural (''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', walk). The first and third subject forms in singular and plural express indirect orders and are conjugated using ''\u0434\u0430'' or ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430'' and the verb in present tense (''\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e'', may we live long).

Although the written language, now called [[Church Slavonic]], remained static as a result of Turkish domination, the spoken dialects moved further apart.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nThe earliest lexicographic evidence of the Macedonian dialects, described as Bulgarian,<ref>[http://www.slav.uni-sofia.bg/lilijournal/index.php/bg/issues/contents-spring2010/articles-spring2010/170-ilieval-2010 Littera et Lingua] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112190002/http://www.slav.uni-sofia.bg/lilijournal/index.php/bg/issues/contents-spring2010/articles-spring2010/170-ilieval-2010 |date=2013-11-12 }}, {{ISSN|1312-6172}}, \u041f\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0442 2010, \u041b\u0438\u043b\u0438\u044f \u0418\u043b\u0438\u0435\u0432\u0430, \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438 \u0437\u0430 \u0431\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043f\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0438\u044f \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0437 XVI \u0438 XVII \u0432\u0435\u043a.</ref> can be found in a lexicon from the 16th century written in the Greek alphabet.<ref>[http://www.mn.mk/docs/Makedonski-Leksikon-XVI-vek.pdf 'Un Lexique Macedonien Du XVIe Siecle'], Giannelli, Ciro.

His work articulated for the first time a distinct pair of two groups of [[Bulgarian dialects]]: Eastern and Western (spoken in today Western Bulgaria and North Macedonia).

Misirkov was born in a village [[Pella (modern)|Postol]] in Ottoman Macedonia. Although literature had been written in the Slavic dialects of Macedonia before, arguably the most important book published in relation to the Macedonian language was Misirkov's ''On Macedonian Matters'', published in 1903. In that book, he argued for creation of a standard literary Macedonian language from the central dialects of Macedonia that would use a [[phonemic orthography]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nAfter the first two Balkan wars, the region of Macedonia was split between Greece, Bulgaria, and Serbia (later [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], Yugoslavia). Serbia occupied the area that is currently North Macedonia incorporating it into the Kingdom as \"Southern Serbia\". During this time, Yugoslav Macedonia became known as [[Vardar Banovina]] (Vardar province) and the language of public life, education and the church was Serbo-Croatian. In the other two parts of Macedonia the respective national languages, Greek and Bulgarian, were made official. In Bulgarian (Pirin) Macedonia, the local dialects continued to be described as dialects of Bulgarian.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[second World War]], most of Yugoslav Macedonia was occupied by the Bulgarian army, who was allied with the Axis. The standard Bulgarian language was reintroduced in schools and [[liturgies]].

The Macedonian language was proclaimed the official language of the Republic of Macedonia at the First Session of the Assembly for the National Liberation of Macedonia, held on 2 August 1944. The first official Macedonian grammar was developed by Krume Kepeski. One of the most important contributors in the standardisation of the Macedonian literary language was [[Bla\u017ee Koneski]]. The first document written in the literary standard Macedonian language is the first issue of the ''[[Nova Makedonija]]'' newspaper in 1944. ''Makedonska Iskra'' (Macedonian Spark) was the first Macedonian newspaper published in Australia, from 1946 to 1957. Its articles were not in standard Macedonian but in local [[Slavic dialects of Greece]]. A monthly with national distribution, it commenced in Perth and later moved to Melbourne and Sydney. After the [[Tito-Stalin split]] in 1948, under the auspices of some Macedonian intellectuals in [[Bucharest]], anti-Yugoslav,  ''non-[[serbianisation|serbianised]]'' alphabet, grammar, and primer were created.<ref>Keith Brown, Macedonia's Child-grandfathers: The Transnational Politics of Memory, Exile, and Return, 1948-1998; Henry M.

The ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'' also shows the names ''Groubi'' or ''Groebi'' in the 12th century. Furthermore, it suggests the name is from a ''tarn'' perhaps with the [[Old Norse|Old Scandinavian]] name ''gr\u014df''; and that the [[Old Norse]] ''gr\u00f3f'' means \"a torrent and a gully formed by it.\" The dictionary also says, \"It is identical with [ [[Gothic language]] ] ''gr\u00f3ba'', [ [[Old High German]] ] ''grouba'' 'pit, hollow'.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ekwall|first=E.|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names|edition=4th |year=1980}}</ref>\n\n==Shopping==\nThe village centre has a few shops, including two [[Co-op (supermarket)|Co-op supermarket]]<nowiki/>s, [[The Co-operative Pharmacy|Co-op Chemists]], Pricegate, d\u00e9ja Vu hair salon, Chaplins (traditional family butcher), a bakery, greengrocers, Cathy Stevens Jewellery, Mark Jarvis, Wilson & Sons Newsagent, Nottingham Building Society branch and Flint.

Due to lack of drainage, \"it is one of the most significant wildlife areas in Leicestershire.\"  The origins of the pool are debated.  Theories include that it resulted from the damming of Slate Brook by monks from [[Leicester Abbey]] or that it was a Roman clay-pit for pottery production. \nThere is a public car park a few minutes' walk to the southeast, and it is possible to walk along the east side nearest the lane, although access elsewhere is restricted. Visitors are requested NOT to feed the birds as it changes the water balance and damages wildlife.  The pool has a strict no fishing rule.<ref name=\"note 1\">Source, Groby pool SSSI information board at pool edge just beyond car park.</ref> In 2017, a number of notices were erected around the pool perimeter advising visitors NOT to paddle or swim due to [[blue green algae]].\n\n==Local villages and towns==\n*[[Leicester]] \u2013 the nearest city, 5 miles along the A50.\n*[[Glenfield, Leicestershire|Glenfield]] \u2013 1 mile along the A50 towards Leicester, a village/suburb bordering the city.\n*[[Newtown Linford]] (and [[Bradgate Park]] \u2013 small tourist \"honeypot\" in [[Charnwood (borough)|Charnwood]]); 2 miles away.\n*[[Field Head]] \u2013 on A50 towards Markfield, part of Groby Parish.\n*[[Markfield]] \u2013 3 miles along A50 towards Coalville.

Also, groo is a Viking word for pit, which may well refer to the quarry situated next to the village. The Domesday entry lists the village as 'Grobi'. The ''Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'' also shows the names ''Groubi'' or ''Groebi'' in the 12th century. Furthermore, it suggests the name is from a ''tarn'' perhaps with the [[Old Norse|Old Scandinavian]] name ''gr\u014df''; and that the [[Old Norse]] ''gr\u00f3f'' means \"a torrent and a gully formed by it.\" The dictionary also says, \"It is identical with [ [[Gothic language]] ] ''gr\u00f3ba'', [ [[Old High German]] ] ''grouba'' 'pit, hollow'.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Ekwall|first=E.|title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names|edition=4th |year=1980}}</ref>\n\n==Shopping==\nThe village centre has a few shops, including a [[Co-op (supermarket)|Co-op supermarket]], [[The Co-operative Pharmacy|Co-op Chemists]], Pricegate, d\u00e9ja Vu hair salon, Chaplins (traditional family butcher), a bakery, greengrocers, Cathy Stevens Jewellery, Mark Jarvis, Wilson & Sons Newsagent, Nottingham Building Society branch and Flint.

There is also a [[The Scout Association|Scout troop]] based on the edge of Martinshaw [[Ancient woodland|Woods]].\n\n==Industry==\nThe old quarry in the village centre is now an [[industrial estate]] - mostly owned by the company [[GE Sensing]] formerly Druck Ltd, which makes [[Pressure sensor|pressure transducers]].\n\nGroby [[Quarry]] is located on the narrow lane which leads through to Newtown Linford, and is still used to quarry [[granite]]. Lawn Wood Quarry, on the A50, is now largely disused and is being filled in with landfill.\n\nThe light engineering company APT Leicester is based in Groby.\n\n==Groby Pool==\n[[File:Groby Pool 2006-08-29 038web.jpg|thumb|Groby Pool]]\nGroby Pool, \"reputedly the largest natural expanse of open water in Leicestershire\" is a {{convert|38| acres|ha}}  lake located opposite the quarry on Newtown Linford Lane.  It is owned by [[Hanson plc|Hanson quarries]] and managed by [[English Nature]] and became an [[SSSI]] in 1956.  Due to lack of drainage, \"it is one of the most significant wildlife areas in Leicestershire.\"  The origins of the pool are debated.  Theories include that it resulted from the damming of Slate Brook by monks from [[Leicester Abbey]] or that it was a Roman clay-pit for pottery production. \nThere is a public car park a few minutes' walk to the southeast, and it is possible to walk along the east side nearest the lane, although access elsewhere is restricted. Visitors are requested NOT to feed the birds as it changes the water balance and damages wildlife.  The pool has a strict no fishing rule.<ref name=\"note 1\">Source, Groby pool SSSI information board at pool edge just beyond car park.</ref> In 2017, a number of notices were erected around the pool perimeter advising visitors NOT to paddle or swim due to [[blue green algae]].\n\n==Local villages and towns==\n*[[Leicester]] \u2013 the nearest city, 5 miles along the A50.\n*[[Glenfield, Leicestershire|Glenfield]] \u2013 1 mile along the A50 towards Leicester, a village/suburb bordering the city.\n*[[Newtown Linford]] (and [[Bradgate Park]] \u2013 small tourist \"honeypot\" in [[Charnwood (borough)|Charnwood]]); 2 miles away.\n*[[Field Head]] \u2013 on A50 towards Markfield, part of Groby Parish.\n*[[Markfield]] \u2013 3 miles along A50 towards Coalville.
