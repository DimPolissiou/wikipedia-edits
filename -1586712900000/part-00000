This case is noteworthy because the judge lists a 10-point definition of Islamic extremism that he used to determine the case:\n\nIn [[Charles Haddon-Cave]]'s findings he wrote:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n<blockquote>Extremist Islamic positions \n118. In my view, the following constitute \"extremist\" Islamic positions (or indicia thereof). \n* First, a 'Manichean' view of the world. A total, eternal 'Manichean' worldview is a central tenet of violent Islamic extremism.  It divides the world strictly into 'Us' versus 'Them': those who are blessed or saved (i.e. the \"right kind\" of Muslim) on the one hand and those who are to be damned for eternity (i.e. the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim and everyone else) on the other. For violent Islamic extremists, the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim includes moderate Sunni Muslims, all Shia Muslims, and many others who are \"mete for the sword\" and can be killed, and anyone who associates or collaborates\" with them...\n* Second, the reduction of jihad (striving in God's cause) to qital (armed combat) ('the Lesser Jihad')...\n* Third, the ignoring or flouting of the conditions for the declaration of armed jihad (qital), i.e. the established Islamic doctrinal conditions for the declaration of armed combat (qital) set out above...\n* Fourth, the ignoring or flouting of the strict regulations governing the conduct of armed jihad, i.e. the stipulations in the Qur'an and the Sunna for the ethics of conducting qital set out above. Thus, the use of excessive violence, attacks on civilians, indiscriminate 'suicide' violence and the torture or the murder of prisoners would constitute violation of these regulations of jihad...\n* Fifth, advocating armed fighting in defence of Islam (qital) as a universal individual religious obligation (fard al 'ayn)...\n* Sixth, any interpretation of Shari'a (i.e. religious law laid down by the Qur'an and the Sunna) that required breaking the 'law of the land'...\n* Seventh, the classification of all non-Muslims as unbelievers (kuffar)...\n* Eighth, the extreme Salafist Islamism doctrine that the precepts of the Muslim faith negate and supersede all other natural ties, such as those of family, kinship and nation...\n* Ninth, the citing with approval the fatwa (legal opinions) of Islamic scholars who espouse extremist view...\n* Tenth, any teaching which, expressly or implicitly, encourages Muslims to engage in, or support, terrorism or violence in the name of Allah.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37798201|title=Imam loses libel action against BBC over 'extreme' claim|first=Dominic|last=Casciani|date=28 October 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Key influences of radical Islam ==\n\n=== Early Islam ===\nAccording to the academic definition of radical Islam, the second condition for something to be called radical Islam, is that it is antigovernmental. Consequently, a government is a condition for radical islam. However, even though the [[peace of Westphalia]] was established in 1648 and thusly introduced the [[nation state]], the writings of the early Islam period are influential to the contemporary writings that were coined radical after the concept of the nation state was established in Islamic regions as well. Key influences of radical Islam that stem from early Islam include:\n\n==== Kharijites ====\n{{Main|Khawarij}}\nAccording to some contemporary Muslim commentators, extremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century to the [[Kharijites]]. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shi\u02bfa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to [[takfir]], whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/|title=Another battle with Islam's 'true believers'|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802045255/http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |archivedate= 2 August 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism|title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism|date=6 February 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==== '''Ibn Taymiyya''' ====\n{{Main|Ibn Taymiyyah}}\n\n=== Contemporary Islam ===\nThe contemporary period begins after 1924.

This case is noteworthy because the judge lists a 10-point definition of Islamic extremism that he used to determine the case:\n\nIn [[Charles Haddon-Cave]]'s findings he wrote:<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n<blockquote>Extremist Islamic positions \n118. In my view, the following constitute \"extremist\" Islamic positions (or indicia thereof). \n* First, a 'Manichean' view of the world. A total, eternal 'Manichean' worldview is a central tenet of violent Islamic extremism.  It divides the world strictly into 'Us' versus 'Them': those who are blessed or saved (i.e. the \"right kind\" of Muslim) on the one hand and those who are to be damned for eternity (i.e. the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim and everyone else) on the other. For violent Islamic extremists, the \"wrong kind\" of Muslim includes moderate Sunni Muslims, all Shia Muslims, and many others who are \"mete for the sword\" and can be killed, and anyone who associates or collaborates\" with them...\n* Second, the reduction of jihad (striving in God's cause) to qital (armed combat) ('the Lesser Jihad')...\n* Third, the ignoring or flouting of the conditions for the declaration of armed jihad (qital), i.e. the established Islamic doctrinal conditions for the declaration of armed combat (qital) set out above...\n* Fourth, the ignoring or flouting of the strict regulations governing the conduct of armed jihad, i.e. the stipulations in the Qur'an and the Sunna for the ethics of conducting qital set out above. Thus, the use of excessive violence, attacks on civilians, indiscriminate 'suicide' violence and the torture or the murder of prisoners would constitute violation of these regulations of jihad...\n* Fifth, advocating armed fighting in defence of Islam (qital) as a universal individual religious obligation (fard al 'ayn)...\n* Sixth, any interpretation of Shari'a (i.e. religious law laid down by the Qur'an and the Sunna) that required breaking the 'law of the land'...\n* Seventh, the classification of all non-Muslims as unbelievers (kuffar)...\n* Eighth, the extreme Salafist Islamism doctrine that the precepts of the Muslim faith negate and supersede all other natural ties, such as those of family, kinship and nation...\n* Ninth, the citing with approval the fatwa (legal opinions) of Islamic scholars who espouse extremist view...\n* Tenth, any teaching which, expressly or implicitly, encourages Muslims to engage in, or support, terrorism or violence in the name of Allah.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37798201|title=Imam loses libel action against BBC over 'extreme' claim|first=Dominic|last=Casciani|date=28 October 2016|publisher=[[BBC News]]}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Key influences of radical Islam ==\n\n=== Early Islam ===\nAccording to the academic definition of radical Islam, the second condition for something to be called radical Islam, is that it is antigovernmental. Consequently, a government is a condition for radical islam. However, even though the [[peace of Westphalia]] was established in 1648 and thusly introduced the [[nation state]], the writings of the early Islam period are influential to the contemporary writings that were coined radical after the concept of the nation state was established in Islamic regions as well. Key influences of radical Islam that stem from early Islam include:\n\n==== Kharijites ====\n{{Main|Khawarij}}\nAccording to some contemporary Muslim commentators, extremism within Islam goes back to the 7th century to the [[Kharijites]]. From their essentially political position, they developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shi\u02bfa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to [[takfir]], whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/|title=Another battle with Islam's 'true believers'|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802045255/http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |archivedate= 2 August 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism|title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism|date=6 February 2015|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n'''Ibn Taymiyya'''\n\n{{Main|Ibn Taymiyyah}}\n\n=== Contemporary Islam ===\nThe contemporary period begins after 1924.

After arriving in New York in 1776, Hamilton meets [[Aaron Burr]], [[John Laurens]], [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], and [[Hercules Mulligan]] (\"[[Aaron Burr, Sir]]\"), and impresses them with his rhetorical skills (\"[[My Shot]]\"). They affirm their revolutionary goals to each other (\"[[The Story of Tonight]]\"). Meanwhile, wealthy sisters [[Angelica Schuyler Church|Angelica]], [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton|Eliza]], and [[Peggy Schuyler]] go into town seeking out potential suitors (\"[[The Schuyler Sisters]]\"). [[Samuel Seabury]] warns everyone about the dangers of Congress, but Hamilton disagrees and tries to counter Seabury (\"[[Farmer Refuted]]\"). [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]] then insists on his authority (\"[[You'll Be Back]]\"). During the [[New York and New Jersey campaign]], Hamilton accepts a position as [[George Washington]]'s [[aide-de-camp]] (\"[[Right Hand Man (Hamilton song)|Right Hand Man]]\"), instead of field command.\n\nAt Philip Schuyler's ball (\"A Winter's Ball\"),  Hamilton meets, falls in love with, and later marries Eliza Schuyler (\"[[Helpless (Hamilton song)|Helpless]]\"), as Angelica suppresses her feelings for the sake of their happiness at the wedding (\"[[Satisfied (Hamilton song)|Satisfied]]\"). After the wedding, Burr congratulates Hamilton on his position as aide-de-camp to Washington; Hamilton confesses that he would much rather have Burr's position on the battlefield (\"[[The Story of Tonight (Reprise)]]\"). Burr reflects on Hamilton's swift rise while considering his own career as more cautious (\"[[Wait for It (song)|Wait For It]]\").\n\nAs conditions worsen for the Continental Army, Hamilton aids Laurens in a [[duel]] against [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] (\"Stay Alive\"), who insulted Washington. Laurens injures Lee, who in turn yields (\"[[Ten Duel Commandments]]\"). Hamilton is temporarily suspended by Washington (\"Meet Me Inside\") over the duel and is sent home. There, Eliza reveals that she is pregnant with her first child, and asks Hamilton to slow down to take in what has happened in their lives (\"That Would Be Enough\"). After Lafayette convinces France to get involved on the colonists' side (\"Guns and Ships\"), he urges Washington to call Hamilton back to help plan the final [[Siege of Yorktown]]. Washington agrees but explains to Hamilton\u2014who is convinced he should die a martyr and a hero in war\u2014that he should be careful with his actions because whatever he does will be known for ages to come (\"[[History Has Its Eyes on You]]\"). At the [[Siege of Yorktown]], Hamilton meets up with Lafayette to take down the British, revealing that Mulligan was recruited as a spy, helping them figure out what to do to trap the British and win the war (\"[[Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)]]\").\n\nSoon after the victory at Yorktown, King George asks the rebels how they will succeed in governing on their own (\u201c[[What Comes Next?]]\u201d). Hamilton's son [[Philip Hamilton|Philip]] is born, while Burr has a daughter, [[Theodosia Burr Alston|Theodosia]], and the two tell their children how they will do anything to protect them (\"[[Dear Theodosia]]\"). Hamilton receives word that his friend Laurens has been killed in [[Battle of the Combahee River|a seemingly pointless battle]] after the war was won and throws himself into his work (\"[[Tomorrow There'll Be More of Us]]\"). He co-authors ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' and is selected as [[Secretary of the Treasury (United States)|Secretary of the Treasury]] by newly elected President Washington. Eliza begs Hamilton to stay. Angelica moves to London with her new husband (\"Non-Stop\").\n\n=== Act II ===\n[[Thomas Jefferson]] returns to America from being the [[List of ambassadors of the United States to France|U.S. ambassador to France]] (\"What'd I Miss\"). In 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate the latter's financial proposals at a [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside, and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress (\"[[Cabinet Battle]] #1\").\n\nEliza and her family\u2014along with Angelica, back from London\u2014travel upstate during the summer, while Hamilton stays home to work on the compromise (\"Take a Break\"). Hamilton [[Hamilton\u2013Reynolds sex scandal|begins an affair]] with [[Maria Reynolds]], making him vulnerable to her husband's blackmail (\"[[Say No To This]]\"). Hamilton, Jefferson, and [[James Madison]] create the [[Compromise of 1790]] over a private dinner, exchanging Hamilton's financial plan for placing the country's permanent capital on the Potomac River. Burr is envious of Hamilton's sway in the government and wishes he had similar power (\"[[The Room Where It Happens]]\"). Burr switches political parties and defeats Philip Schuyler, making Hamilton now a rival (\"Schuyler Defeated\").\n\nIn another Cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in its [[War of the First Coalition|conflict with Britain]]. President Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument for remaining [[Proclamation of Neutrality|neutral]] (\"[[Cabinet Battle]] #2\"). In the wake of this, Jefferson, Madison, and Burr decide to join forces to find a way to discredit Hamilton in Washington's eyes (\"Washington on Your Side\"). Washington decides to retire from the presidency, and Hamilton assists in writing a [[George Washington's Farewell Address|farewell address]] (\"[[One Last Time (Hamilton)|One Last Time]]\").\n\nA flabbergasted King George receives word that George Washington has stepped down, and will be replaced by [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Paris]] signatory [[John Adams]] (\u201cI Know Him\u201d). John Adams [[1796 United States presidential election|becomes the second President]] and fires Hamilton, who publishes an inflammatory critique of the new president as a response (\"[[The Adams Administration]]\"). In the face of accusations of speculation of government funds by Jefferson, Madison, and Burr\u2014and out of fear that his affair with Maria Reynolds will be used against him in his political career (\"We Know\")\u2014Hamilton chooses to publicize his affair (\"Hurricane\") in the Reynolds Pamphlet (\"[[The Reynolds Pamphlet (song)|The Reynolds Pamphlet]]\"), damaging his relationship with Eliza (\"Burn\"). Philip, instructed by Hamilton, challenges [[George Eacker]] to a duel and is critically injured (\"Blow Us All Away\") and dies (\"Stay Alive (Reprise)\"), causing a reconciliation between Alexander and Eliza (\"[[It's Quiet Uptown]]\").\n\nHamilton's endorsement of Jefferson in [[1800 United States presidential election|the presidential election of 1800]] (\"The Election of 1800\") results in further animosity between Hamilton and Burr, who [[Burr\u2013Hamilton duel|challenges Hamilton to a duel]] via an exchange of letters (\"[[Your Obedient Servant (song)|Your Obedient Servant]]\"). Hamilton writes his last letter in a rush while Eliza tells him to go back to bed (\u201cBest of Wives and Best of Women\u201d). Burr and Hamilton travel to New Jersey for the duel. During the duel, both Burr and Hamilton fire at each other after ten paces, with Hamilton intentionally missing (''[[Deloping|throwing away]]'') his shot. Hamilton dies as a result, with Eliza and Angelica at his side. Burr laments that even though he survived, he is cursed to be remembered as the villain who killed Hamilton (\"[[The World Was Wide Enough]]\"). The musical closes with a reflection on historical memory, showing how Eliza kept Hamilton's legacy alive (\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\").\n\n== Roles and principal casts ==\n=== Original production casts ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

About the origin of the song, Yankovic said, \"Lin pitched it to me as a polka medley way more hesitantly than [he] should have. He was like, 'Would you want to do a polka medley?' I was like, 'Of course I do!{{'\"}} Since Yankovic was busy working on his new tour, he wouldn't be able to release the song in February, so he suggested calling March 2 \"February 30th\".

Instead of being characterized as a white person, Alexander Hamilton's immigrant status would be referenced throughout the whole show, alongside with the virtue and prowess of Hamilton (\"by working a lot harder, by being a lot smarter, by being a self-starter\", described in the show's opening, and later stating \u201cimmigrants get things done\u201d), in order to foster a positive image of immigrants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://howlround.com/why-hamilton-is-not-the-revolution-you-think-it-is |title=Why ''Hamilton'' is Not the Revolution You Think it is |first=Jonathan |last=Mandell |work=HowlRound |publisher=Emerson College |accessdate=July 7, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628224944/http://howlround.com/why-hamilton-is-not-the-revolution-you-think-it-is |archivedate=June 28, 2017}}</ref> Alongside this, the casting of Black, Latino, and Asian American leads allowed audiences to literally view America as a nation of immigrants, with the intention of showing how irrelevant the Founding Fathers' whiteness is to their claim on the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com.au/entry/no-the-hamilton-casting-call-for-non-white-actors-is-not-reverse-racism_us_56fd2c83e4b0daf53aeed9b9 |title=No, The 'Hamilton' Casting Call For 'Non-White' Actors Is Not Reverse Racism |first=Zeba |last=Blay |date=January 4, 2016 |work=HuffPost |accessdate=July 7, 2017}}</ref>\n\"''Hamilton'' is a story about America, and the most beautiful thing about it is... it's told by such a diverse cast with such diverse styles of music\", according to Renee Elise Goldsberry, who played Angelica Schuyler. \"We have the opportunity to reclaim a history that some of us don't necessarily think is our own.\"<ref>{{cite news |title=Why History Has Its Eyes on Hamilton's Diversity |url=http://time.com/4149415/hamilton-broadway-diversity/ |website=Time |access-date=January 19, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160119004947/http://time.com/4149415/hamilton-broadway-diversity/ |archivedate=January 19, 2016 }}</ref> Miranda has stated that he is \"totally open\" to women playing the Founding Fathers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/article/2016/03/03/hamilton-casting-women-washington-burr/ |title='Hamilton' casting call wants women to play Washington and Burr |date=March 3, 2016 |accessdate=May 18, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315114045/http://ew.com/article/2016/03/03/hamilton-casting-women-washington-burr/ |archivedate=March 15, 2017}}</ref> Casting for the British production is expected to feature predominantly black British artists.<ref name=\"ft.com\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/a412b7dc-e479-11e6-9645-c9357a75844a |title=Subscribe to read |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129052411/https://www.ft.com/content/a412b7dc-e479-11e6-9645-c9357a75844a |archivedate=January 29, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/27/hamilton-victoria-palace-theatre-london-cast-announced-hip-hop-musical |title=Hamilton: first cast members revealed for West End production |first=Guardian |last=staff |date=January 27, 2017 |work=The Guardian |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170128004629/https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/jan/27/hamilton-victoria-palace-theatre-london-cast-announced-hip-hop-musical |archivedate=January 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Historical accuracy ===\n==== Chronology and events ====\nAlthough ''Hamilton'' was based on historical events and people, Miranda did use some dramatic license in retelling the story. For example, while Angelica did have a strong relationship with Hamilton, it was exaggerated in the show. During \"Satisfied\", Angelica explains why Hamilton is not suitable for her despite wanting him. In particular, she states, \"I'm a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich. My father has no sons so I'm the one who has to social climb for one.\" In actuality, Angelica had less pressure on her to do this. [[Philip Schuyler]] actually had fifteen children, including two sons who survived into adulthood (one of whom was New York State Assemblyman [[Philip Jeremiah Schuyler]]), and Angelica had eloped with [[John Barker Church]] three years before she met Hamilton at her sister's wedding, when she was already a mother of two of her eight children with Church.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"The Lovesick Colonel\"</ref> Miranda stated that he chose to do this because it is stronger dramatically if Angelica is available but cannot marry him.<ref>{{cite video |last=[[Genius (website)|Genius]] |title=Hamilton: Lin-Manuel Miranda on the Play's Historical Inaccuracies |date=November 2, 2015 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRJEOsyCfvQ |accessdate=March 23, 2016 |via=YouTube |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412170327/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRJEOsyCfvQ |archivedate=April 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://genius.com/7912429 |title=Satsified Lyrics and Commentary |work=Genius |access-date=May 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"bustle accuracy\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/165821-how-historically-accurate-is-hamilton-a-breakdown-of-the-musicals-events-what-really-happened-so |title=How Historically Accurate Is 'Hamilton'?

For example, while Burr was present at the [[Battle of Monmouth]], Burr did not serve as Charles Lee's second in his duel with John Laurens as seen in \"Ten Duel Commandments\"; Lee's second was Evan Edwards.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"A Frenzy of Valor\"</ref> Hamilton also never approached Burr to help write ''The Federalist Papers'' as portrayed in \"Non-Stop\".<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"Publius\"</ref>\n\nDuring Act I, the character of Aaron Burr says that \"...[[Martha Washington]] named her feral tomcat after him! [Hamilton]\", to which Alexander Hamilton replies: \"That's true!\"<ref>{{cite web |title=A Winter's Ball |url=https://genius.com/Lin-manuel-miranda-a-winters-ball-lyrics |website=genius.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160721091940/http://genius.com/Lin-manuel-miranda-a-winters-ball-lyrics |archivedate=July 21, 2016}}</ref> In fact, it is false. The idea of Hamilton as a serial adulterer has been one of the biggest mischaracterizations of the real Alexander Hamilton for two centuries, with celebrated authors repeating the story over and over again, notwithstanding that the sexual connotation of ''tomcat'' as a womanizer did not appear in dictionaries until the first half of the 20th century. The \"tomcat\" story has been previously discredited by author Stephen Knott,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Knott |first1=Stephen F. |title='Hamilton: An American Musical' echoes John and Abigail Adams's accusations that Alexander Hamilton was a serial adulterer.

While it is true that John Adams and Hamilton did not particularly get along, John Adams did not fire Hamilton as told in the show. Hamilton tendered his resignation from his position as Secretary of the Treasury on December 1, 1794,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hamilton |first1=Alexander |title=Letter from Alexander Hamilton to George Washington, 1 December 1794 |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-17-02-0392 |website=Founders Online}}</ref> two years before Adams became president.

Venable|Abraham Venable]] in December 1792.<ref name=\"Reynolds Pamphlet\">{{cite web |last1=Hamilton |first1=Alexander |title=Printed Version of the 'Reynolds Pamphlet', 1797 |url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-21-02-0138-0002 |website=Founders Online |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710111423/http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-21-02-0138-0002 |archivedate=July 10, 2016}}</ref> Monroe was a close friend of Jefferson's and shared the information of Hamilton's affair with him. In the Summer of 1797, journalist [[James T. Callender]] broke the story of Hamilton's infidelity. Hamilton blamed Monroe, and the altercation nearly ended in a duel.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"Too Near The Sun\"</ref> With nothing left to do, Hamilton then published ''The Reynolds Pamphlet''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/alexander-hamiltons-adultery-and-apology-18021947/ |title=Alexander Hamilton's Adultery and Apology |last=Serratore |first=Angela |website=Smithsonian |access-date=March 24, 2016}}</ref> The impact of the pamphlet's publication is exaggerated, as it was actually the later publication of a pamphlet criticizing Adams during the election of 1800 (referenced in \u201cThe Adams Administration\u201d) that effectively ended Hamilton's political career.\n\nIn \"Take a Break\", Philip Hamilton, at age 9, claims, \"I have a sister, but I want a little brother\". Philip already had two younger brothers at the time: [[Alexander Hamilton Jr.]] and [[James Alexander Hamilton]]. On the same song, Angelica sends a letter to Hamilton, revealing she would come back to America from Europe for the summer. She didn't send such a letter and remained in her home.\n\nIn \"Blow Us All Away\", George Eacker and Philip engage in a duel, before the events of the 1800 presidential election. The duel actually occurred in 1801, with Philip Hamilton dying on November 24. In the song, Eacker fires on Philip at the count of seven, while what happened in real-life was quite the opposite; both men refused to fire for over a minute before Eacker shot Philip in the hips.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"A World Full of Folly\"</ref>\n\nLastly, it was not the presidential election of 1800 that led to Burr and Hamilton's duel. Burr did become Jefferson's vice-president, but when Jefferson decided not to run with Burr for reelection in 1804, Burr opted to run for [[Governor of New York]] instead. Burr lost to [[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]] in a landslide. Afterward, a letter was published in ''The Albany Register'' from [[Charles D.

After arriving in New York in 1776, Hamilton meets [[Aaron Burr]], [[John Laurens]], [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]], and [[Hercules Mulligan]] (\"[[Aaron Burr, Sir]]\"), and impresses them with his rhetorical skills (\"[[My Shot]]\"). They affirm their revolutionary goals to each other (\"[[The Story of Tonight]]\"). Meanwhile, wealthy sisters [[Angelica Schuyler Church|Angelica]], [[Elizabeth Schuyler Hamilton|Eliza]], and [[Peggy Schuyler]] go into town seeking out potential suitors (\"[[The Schuyler Sisters]]\"). [[Samuel Seabury]] warns everyone about the dangers of Congress, but Hamilton disagrees and tries to counter Seabury (\"[[Farmer Refuted]]\"). [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George]] then insists on his authority (\"[[You'll Be Back]]\"). During the [[New York and New Jersey campaign]], Hamilton accepts a position as [[George Washington]]'s [[aide-de-camp]] (\"[[Right Hand Man (Hamilton song)|Right Hand Man]]\"), instead of field command.\n\nAt Philip Schuyler's ball (\"A Winter's Ball\"),  Hamilton meets, falls in love with, and later marries Eliza Schuyler (\"[[Helpless (Hamilton song)|Helpless]]\"), as Angelica suppresses her feelings for the sake of their happiness at the wedding (\"[[Satisfied (Hamilton song)|Satisfied]]\"). After the wedding, Burr congratulates Hamilton on his position as aide-de-camp to Washington; Hamilton confesses that he would much rather have Burr's position on the battlefield (\"[[The Story of Tonight (Reprise)]]\"). Burr reflects on Hamilton's swift rise while considering his own career as more cautious (\"[[Wait for It (song)|Wait For It]]\").\n\nAs conditions worsen for the Continental Army, Hamilton aids Laurens in a [[duel]] against [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]] (\"Stay Alive\"), who insulted Washington. Laurens injures Lee, who in turn yields (\"[[Ten Duel Commandments]]\"). Hamilton is temporarily suspended by Washington (\"Meet Me Inside\") over the duel and is sent home. There, Eliza reveals that she is pregnant with her first child, and asks Hamilton to slow down to take in what has happened in their lives (\"That Would Be Enough\"). After Lafayette convinces France to get involved on the colonists' side (\"Guns and Ships\"), he urges Washington to call Hamilton back to help plan the final [[Siege of Yorktown]]. Washington agrees but explains to Hamilton\u2014who is convinced he should die a martyr and a hero in war\u2014that he should be careful with his actions because whatever he does will be known for ages to come (\"[[History Has Its Eyes on You]]\"). At the [[Siege of Yorktown]], Hamilton meets up with Lafayette to take down the British, revealing that Mulligan was recruited as a spy, helping them figure out what to do to trap the British and win the war (\"[[Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)]]\").\n\nSoon after the victory at Yorktown, King George asks the rebels how they will succeed in governing on their own (\u201c[[What Comes Next?]]\u201d). Hamilton's son [[Philip Hamilton|Philip]] is born, while Burr has a daughter, [[Theodosia Burr Alston|Theodosia]], and the two tell their children how they will do anything to protect them (\"[[Dear Theodosia]]\"). Hamilton receives word that his friend Laurens has been killed in [[Battle of the Combahee River|a seemingly pointless battle]] after the war was won and throws himself into his work (\"[[Tomorrow There'll Be More of Us]]\"). He co-authors ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' and is selected as [[Secretary of the Treasury (United States)|Secretary of the Treasury]] by newly elected President Washington. Eliza begs Hamilton to stay. Angelica moves to London with her new husband (\"Non-Stop\").\n\n=== Act II ===\n[[Thomas Jefferson]] returns to America from being the [[List of ambassadors of the United States to France|U.S. ambassador to France]] (\"What'd I Miss\"). In 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate the latter's financial proposals at a [[Cabinet of the United States|Cabinet]] meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside, and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress (\"[[Cabinet Battle]] #1\").\n\nEliza and her family\u2014along with Angelica, back from London\u2014travel upstate during the summer, while Hamilton stays home to work on the compromise (\"Take a Break\"). Hamilton [[Hamilton\u2013Reynolds sex scandal|begins an affair]] with [[Maria Reynolds]], making him vulnerable to her husband's blackmail (\"[[Say No To This]]\"). Hamilton, Jefferson, and [[James Madison]] create the [[Compromise of 1790]] over a private dinner, exchanging Hamilton's financial plan for placing the country's permanent capital on the Potomac River. Burr is envious of Hamilton's sway in the government and wishes he had similar power (\"[[The Room Where It Happens]]\"). Burr switches political parties and defeats Philip Schuyler, making Hamilton now a rival (\"Schuyler Defeated\").\n\nIn another Cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in its [[War of the First Coalition|conflict with Britain]]. President Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument for remaining [[Proclamation of Neutrality|neutral]] (\"[[Cabinet Battle]] #2\"). In the wake of this, Jefferson, Madison, and Burr decide to join forces to find a way to discredit Hamilton in Washington's eyes (\"Washington on Your Side\"). Washington decides to retire from the presidency, and Hamilton assists in writing a [[George Washington's Farewell Address|farewell address]] (\"[[One Last Time (Hamilton)|One Last Time]]\").\n\nA flabbergasted King George receives word that George Washington has stepped down, and will be replaced by [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Paris]] signatory [[John Adams]] (\u201cI Know Him\u201d). John Adams [[1796 United States presidential election|becomes the second President]] and fires Hamilton, who publishes an inflammatory critique of the new president as a response (\"[[The Adams Administration]]\"). In the face of accusations of speculation of government funds by Jefferson, Madison, and Burr\u2014and out of fear that his affair with Maria Reynolds will be used against him in his political career (\"We Know\")\u2014Hamilton chooses to publicize his affair (\"Hurricane\") in the Reynolds Pamphlet (\"[[The Reynolds Pamphlet (song)|The Reynolds Pamphlet]]\"), damaging his relationship with Eliza (\"Burn\"). Philip, instructed by Hamilton, challenges [[George Eacker]] to a duel and is critically injured (\"Blow Us All Away\") and dies (\"Stay Alive (Reprise)\"), causing a reconciliation between Alexander and Eliza (\"[[It's Quiet Uptown]]\").\n\nHamilton's endorsement of Jefferson in [[1800 United States presidential election|the presidential election of 1800]] (\"The Election of 1800\") results in further animosity between Hamilton and Burr, who [[Burr\u2013Hamilton duel|challenges Hamilton to a duel]] via an exchange of letters (\"[[Your Obedient Servant (song)|Your Obedient Servant]]\"). Hamilton writes his last letter in a rush while Eliza tells him to go back to bed (\u201cBest of Wives and Best of Women\u201d). Burr and Hamilton travel to New Jersey for the duel. During the duel, both Burr and Hamilton fire at each other after ten paces, with Hamilton intentionally missing (''[[Deloping|throwing away]]'') his shot. Hamilton dies as a result, with Eliza and Angelica at his side. Burr laments that even though he survived, he is cursed to be remembered as the villain who killed Hamilton (\"[[The World Was Wide Enough]]\"). The musical closes with a reflection on historical memory, showing how Eliza kept Hamilton's legacy alive (\"[[Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story]]\").\n\n== Roles and principal casts ==\n=== Original production casts ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

About the origin of the song, Yankovic said, \"Lin pitched it to me as a polka medley way more hesitantly than [he] should have. He was like, 'Would you want to do a polka medley?' I was like, 'Of course I do!{{'\"}} Since Yankovic was busy working on his new tour, he wouldn't be able to release the song in February, so he suggested calling March 2 \"February 30th\".

For example, while Angelica did have a strong relationship with Hamilton, it was exaggerated in the show. During \"Satisfied\", Angelica explains why Hamilton is not suitable for her despite wanting him. In particular, she states, \"I'm a girl in a world in which my only job is to marry rich. My father has no sons so I'm the one who has to social climb for one.\" In actuality, Angelica had less pressure on her to do this. [[Philip Schuyler]] actually had fifteen children, including two sons who survived into adulthood (one of whom was New York State Assemblyman [[Philip Jeremiah Schuyler]]), and Angelica had eloped with [[John Barker Church]] three years before she met Hamilton at her sister's wedding, when she was already a mother of two of her eight children with Church.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"The Lovesick Colonel\"</ref> Miranda stated that he chose to do this because it is stronger dramatically if Angelica is available but cannot marry him.<ref>{{cite video |last=[[Genius (website)|Genius]] |title=Hamilton: Lin-Manuel Miranda on the Play's Historical Inaccuracies |date=November 2, 2015 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRJEOsyCfvQ |accessdate=March 23, 2016 |via=YouTube |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160412170327/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRJEOsyCfvQ |archivedate=April 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://genius.com/7912429 |title=Satsified Lyrics and Commentary |work=Genius |access-date=May 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"bustle accuracy\">{{cite web |url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/165821-how-historically-accurate-is-hamilton-a-breakdown-of-the-musicals-events-what-really-happened-so |title=How Historically Accurate Is 'Hamilton'?

For example, while Burr was present at the [[Battle of Monmouth]], Burr did not serve as Charles Lee's second in his duel with John Laurens as seen in \"Ten Duel Commandments\"; Lee's second was Evan Edwards.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"A Frenzy of Valor\"</ref> Hamilton also never approached Burr to help write ''The Federalist Papers'' as portrayed in \"Non-Stop\".<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"Publius\"</ref>\n\nDuring Act I, the character of Aaron Burr says that \"...[[Martha Washington]] named her feral tomcat after him!

The idea of Hamilton as a serial adulterer has been one of the biggest mischaracterizations of the real Alexander Hamilton for two centuries, with celebrated authors repeating the story over and over again, notwithstanding that the sexual connotation of ''tomcat'' as a womanizer did not appear in dictionaries until the first half of the 20th century.

While it is true that John Adams and Hamilton did not particularly get along, John Adams did not fire Hamilton as told in the show.

Philip already had two younger brothers at the time: [[Alexander Hamilton Jr.]] and [[James Alexander Hamilton]]. On the same song, Angelica sends a letter to Hamilton, revealing she would come back to America from Europe for the summer. She didn't send such a letter and remained in her home.\n\nIn \"Blow Us All Away\", George Eacker and Philip engage in a duel, before the events of the 1800 presidential election. The duel actually occurred in 1801, with Philip Hamilton dying on November 24. In the song, Eacker fires on Philip at the count of seven, while what happened in real-life was quite the opposite; both men refused to fire for over a minute before Eacker shot Philip in the hips.<ref>Ron Chernow, ''Alexander Hamilton'', 2004, chapter \"A World Full of Folly\"</ref>\n\nLastly, it was not the presidential election of 1800 that led to Burr and Hamilton's duel. Burr did become Jefferson's vice-president, but when Jefferson decided not to run with Burr for reelection in 1804, Burr opted to run for [[Governor of New York]] instead. Burr lost to [[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]] in a landslide. Afterward, a letter was published in ''The Albany Register'' from [[Charles D. Cooper]] to Philip Schuyler, claiming that Hamilton called Burr \"a dangerous man and one who ought not be trusted with the reins of government\", and that he knew of \"a still more despicable opinion which General Hamilton has expressed of Mr. Burr\".<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AroTfeaadKYC |title=Duel: Alexander Hamilton, Aaron Burr, and the Future of America |last=Flemming |first=Thomas |publisher=Basic Books |year=1999 |isbn=0-465-01737-1 |location=New York |pages=233\u2013284 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513225100/https://books.google.com/books?id=AroTfeaadKYC |archivedate=May 13, 2016}}</ref> This led to the letters between Burr and Hamilton as seen in the show in \"Your Obedient Servant\".\n\n==== Critical analysis and scholarship ====\nThe show has been critiqued for a simplistic depiction of Hamilton and vilification of Jefferson.

He is a former academy coach for the Under 16s at [[Premier League]] side [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].<ref>http://www.edp24.co.uk/sport/norwich-city/darren_huckerby_is_promoted_as_part_of_norwich_city_academy_shake_up_1_4144370</ref>\n\nAs a player, he was a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] from 1993 until 2009. He played most matches for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], but also featured for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. He finished his career by playing in the US, appearing in [[Major League Soccer]] for [[San Jose Earthquakes]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Lincoln City===\nHuckerby was born in [[Nottingham]], England. His mother is of partial [[Georgian people|Georgian]] descent. Huckerby started playing professionally for [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] in [[Football League Division Three]]. Huckerby was promoted to the first team at [[Sincil Bank]] by [[Keith Alexander (footballer)|Keith Alexander]], but also played under the stewardship of both [[Sam Ellis (footballer)|Sam Ellis]] and [[Steve Wicks]] before being sold in 1995. He finished his spell with Lincoln having scored 5 goals in 28 league appearances.\n\n===Newcastle United===\nHuckerby made a three division step up by signing for [[Premier League]] title contenders [[Newcastle United]] in a \u00a3400,000 deal in 1995. Despite being highly rated by the fans and pundits, Huckerby found first team chances severely limited, especially since manager Kevin Keegan decided to scrap the reserve team, in response to a requirement from [[the FA]]  that a certain percentage of home reserve fixtures be played at [[St James' Park]]. Keegan believed that this would negatively affect the pitch condition, which was already in poor state. This of course meant that, with no reserve team football, Huckerby was not match fit for the majority of his time on Tyneside. Huckerby made only one appearance for the Magpies, before being loaned out to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]. Huckerby then joined [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] for \u00a31&nbsp;million in time for the start of the next season, signed by then City boss [[Gordon Strachan]].\n\n===Coventry City===\n\nThe striker's pace and dribbling ability, combined with a very successful partnership with [[Dion Dublin]] saw Huckerby play a key role at Coventry. Huckerby and Dublin's partnership did not go unnoticed and earned Huckerby a call up to the England B squad, whilst Dublin managed call ups to the full squad, under Glenn Hoddle. Huckerby played a major role in Coventry's [[Premier League]] survival,  culminating with a final day 2\u20131 win at [[Tottenham Hotspur]] in 1997. His success with the ''Sky Blues'' continued throughout the following season as Coventry enjoyed a ten-game unbeaten run and reached the quarter finals of the FA Cup, narrowly losing on penalties to Sheffield United. Huckerby scored several goals, most notably the winner in a 3\u20132 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Highfield Road]], a dazzling run past a few defenders before slotting past [[Kevin Pilkington]]. He notched up 14 goals that season, his best Premier League return of goals.\n\n===Leeds United===\nHe was sold to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] the following summer for a reputed \u00a36&nbsp;million. In his time at [[Elland Road]], he scored two goals in 40 league games, both of which were against former club Coventry City<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-the-day-hedman-lost-his-head-1117935.html\n|title=The day Hedman lost his head\n|work=[[The Independent]]\n|date=11 September 1999 |accessdate=6 November 2009\n| location=London\n| first=Jon\n| last=Culley}}</ref> and Watford.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/may/04/match.sport3\n|title=Leeds ready to join Europe's elite\n|work=[[The Guardian]]\n|date=3 May 2000 |accessdate=6 November 2009\n| location=London\n| first=Daniel\n| last=Taylor}}</ref> He had to compete for a place in the team with some players such as [[Mark Viduka]], [[Alan Smith (footballer born 1980)|Alan Smith]] and [[Michael Bridges]] and as a result he was never a regular, although he did score against Partizan Belgrade in the 1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.ozwhitelufc.net.au/30-09-1999%20LUFC%20v%20Partizan%20Belgrade.htm\n|title=Leeds United 1 Partizan Belgrade 0\n|publisher=OzWhiteLUFC\n|date=30 September 1999 |accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref> and in a 6\u20130 win against Be\u015fikta\u015f in the 2000\u201301 Champions League.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/leeds-in-overdrive-to-belittle-besiktas-700832.html\n|title=Leeds in overdrive to belittle Be\u015fikta\u015f\n|work=[[The Independent]]\n|date=26 September 2000 |accessdate=6 November 2009\n| location=London\n| first=Phil\n| last=Shaw}}</ref> In all competitions, he scored six goals in total.\n\n===Manchester City===\n[[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] signed him in December 2000 for \u00a33.38&nbsp;million, as they attempted to avoid relegation. Although the club did eventually go down, he stayed on and won a [[Football League First Division|First Division]] championship medal, adding 26 goals in all competitions during the campaign, including two [[hat trick|hat-tricks]].\n\nHuckerby started the new campaign as first choice, and scored the team's first goal of [[2002\u201303 FA Premier League|the season]], a header against former employer Newcastle that secured a 1\u20130 win. However, the arrivals of [[Nicolas Anelka]] and [[Jon Macken]] meant less playing time, and he eventually ended up playing out the end of the season on-loan to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Forest seal Huckerby deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/nottm_forest/2743735.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 February 2003|accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> being part of the team that reached the Division One [[playoffs]] in 2003.\n\n===Norwich City===\nHuckerby spent a three-month loan spell with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], before signing permanently in December 2003, for a fee of \u00a3750,000, which rose to \u00a31&nbsp;million when ''the Canaries'' were promoted at the end of the season. At Norwich, Huckerby's career settled, and he netted 14 league goals in the First Division in the [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304 season]]. He was instrumental in Norwich's march to the First Division championship in 2003\u201304, and came second in the supporters vote for [[List of Norwich City F.C. Players of the Year|player of the season]] behind [[Craig Fleming]].\n\nReverting to a left wing role for much of Norwich's Premier League spell in [[2004\u201305 FA Premier League|2004\u201305]], Huckerby scored seven goals. He was linked with a transfer to either [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] or [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] the following summer, but spoke of his intention to see out his contract in [[East Anglia]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15255822 |title=BBC Sport - Darren Huckerby admits regret at manner of Norwich City exit |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=22 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nHe was voted Norwich City player of the year by supporters in 2004\u201305 and [[2006\u201307 in English football|2006\u201307]], and placed second behind [[Gary Doherty]] for the [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306]] season, winning the award twice and adding two runner-up positions in his first four seasons.

A video of  sports anchor [[Gary Radnich]] interviewing Huckerby for American television channel [[KRON]] became popular on YouTube, with over 200,000 views.<ref>{{cite web |title=Huckerby on KRON |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-B6ucoSoIy4 |accessdate=4 June 2010}}</ref> The segment included several amusing inaccuracies. These included describing the player as \"from the Nor Folk team in the North East of England\", proclaiming him to be a \"Legend\" several times, and claiming that he scored the \"Greatest goal ever\". KRON also showed a clip of him scoring against Birmingham City when in fact the anchor was referring to a goal scored against Manchester United.  During his time with San Jose, Huckerby was often linked with a return to Norwich City, particularly after the manager who had released him at Norwich \u2013 [[Glenn Roeder]] \u2013 was sacked in January 2009, but he stayed at San Jose.\n\nIn a crucial match for the Earthquakes, on 3 August 2008, Huckerby scored his second goal, against [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], in a 3\u20132 Earthquakes win. On 30 August, he headed in the winning goal in the side's 2\u20131 victory over [[Kansas City Wizards]], extending San Jose's unbeaten streak to seven games.

He is a former academy coach for the Under 16s at [[Premier League]] side [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]].<ref>http://www.edp24.co.uk/sport/norwich-city/darren_huckerby_is_promoted_as_part_of_norwich_city_academy_shake_up_1_4144370</ref>\n\nAs a player, he was a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] from 1993 until 2009. He played most matches for [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], but also featured for [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]], [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. He finished his career by playing in the US, appearing in [[Major League Soccer]] for [[San Jose Earthquakes]].\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Lincoln City===\nHuckerby was born in [[Nottingham]], England. His mother is of partial [[Georgian people|Georgian]] descent. Huckerby started playing professionally for [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]] in [[Football League Division Three]]. Huckerby was promoted to the first team at [[Sincil Bank]] by [[Keith Alexander (footballer)|Keith Alexander]], but also played under the stewardship of both [[Sam Ellis (footballer)|Sam Ellis]] and [[Steve Wicks]] before being sold in 1995. He finished his spell with Lincoln having scored 5 goals in 28 league appearances.\n\n===Newcastle United===\nHuckerby made a three division step up by signing for [[Premier League]] title contenders [[Newcastle United]] in a \u00a3400,000 deal in 1995. Despite being highly rated by the fans and pundits, Huckerby found first team chances severely limited, especially since manager Kevin Keegan decided to scrap the reserve team, in response to a requirement from [[the FA]]  that a certain percentage of home reserve fixtures be played at [[St James' Park]]. Keegan believed that this would negatively affect the pitch condition, which was already in poor state. This of course meant that, with no reserve team football, Huckerby was not match fit for the majority of his time on Tyneside. Huckerby made only one appearance for the Magpies, before being loaned out to [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]]. Huckerby then joined [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] for \u00a31&nbsp;million in time for the start of the next season, signed by then City boss [[Gordon Strachan]].\n\n===Coventry City===\n\nThe striker's pace and dribbling ability, combined with a very successful partnership with [[Dion Dublin]] saw Huckerby play a key role at Coventry. Huckerby and Dublin's partnership did not go unnoticed and earned Huckerby a call up to the England B squad, whilst Dublin managed call ups to the full squad, under Glenn Hoddle. Huckerby played a major role in Coventry's [[Premier League]] survival,  culminating with a final day 2\u20131 win at [[Tottenham Hotspur]] in 1997. His success with the ''Sky Blues'' continued throughout the following season as Coventry enjoyed a ten-game unbeaten run and reached the quarter finals of the FA Cup, narrowly losing on penalties to Sheffield United. Huckerby scored several goals, most notably the winner in a 3\u20132 victory over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] at [[Highfield Road]], a dazzling run past a few defenders before slotting past [[Kevin Pilkington]]. He notched up 14 goals that season, his best Premier League return of goals.\n\n===Leeds United===\nHe was sold to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] the following summer for a reputed \u00a36&nbsp;million. In his time at [[Elland Road]], he scored two goals in 40 league games, both of which were against former club Coventry City<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-the-day-hedman-lost-his-head-1117935.html\n|title=The day Hedman lost his head\n|work=[[The Independent]]\n|date=11 September 1999 |accessdate=6 November 2009\n| location=London\n| first=Jon\n| last=Culley}}</ref> and Watford.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/may/04/match.sport3\n|title=Leeds ready to join Europe's elite\n|work=[[The Guardian]]\n|date=3 May 2000 |accessdate=6 November 2009\n| location=London\n| first=Daniel\n| last=Taylor}}</ref> He had to compete for a place in the team with some players such as [[Mark Viduka]], [[Alan Smith (footballer born 1980)|Alan Smith]] and [[Michael Bridges]] and as a result he was never a regular, although he did score against Partizan Belgrade in the 1999\u20132000 UEFA Cup,<ref>{{cite web\n|url=http://www.ozwhitelufc.net.au/30-09-1999%20LUFC%20v%20Partizan%20Belgrade.htm\n|title=Leeds United 1 Partizan Belgrade 0\n|publisher=OzWhiteLUFC\n|date=30 September 1999 |accessdate=6 November 2009}}</ref> and in a 6\u20130 win against Be\u015fikta\u015f in the 2000\u201301 Champions League.<ref>{{cite news\n|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/leeds-in-overdrive-to-belittle-besiktas-700832.html\n|title=Leeds in overdrive to belittle Be\u015fikta\u015f\n|work=[[The Independent]]\n|date=26 September 2000 |accessdate=6 November 2009\n| location=London\n| first=Phil\n| last=Shaw}}</ref> In all competitions, he scored six goals in total.\n\n===Manchester City===\n[[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] signed him in December 2000 for \u00a33.38&nbsp;million, as they attempted to avoid relegation. Although the club did eventually go down, he stayed on and won a [[Football League First Division|First Division]] championship medal, adding 26 goals in all competitions during the campaign, including two [[hat trick|hat-tricks]].\n\nHuckerby started the new campaign as first choice, and scored the team's first goal of [[2002\u201303 FA Premier League|the season]], a header against former employer Newcastle that secured a 1\u20130 win. However, the arrivals of [[Nicolas Anelka]] and [[Jon Macken]] meant less playing time, and he eventually ended up playing out the end of the season on-loan to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Forest seal Huckerby deal|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/n/nottm_forest/2743735.stm|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 February 2003|accessdate=17 August 2011}}</ref> being part of the team that reached the Division One [[playoffs]] in 2003.\n\n===Norwich City===\nHuckerby spent a three-month loan spell with [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], before signing permanently in December 2003, for a fee of \u00a3750,000, which rose to \u00a31&nbsp;million when ''the Canaries'' were promoted at the end of the season. At Norwich, Huckerby's career settled, and he netted 14 league goals in the First Division in the [[2003\u201304 in English football|2003\u201304 season]]. He was instrumental in Norwich's march to the First Division championship in 2003\u201304, and came second in the supporters vote for [[List of Norwich City F.C. Players of the Year|player of the season]] behind [[Craig Fleming]].\n\nReverting to a left wing role for much of Norwich's Premier League spell in [[2004\u201305 FA Premier League|2004\u201305]], Huckerby scored seven goals. He was linked with a transfer to either [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] or [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] the following summer, but spoke of his intention to see out his contract in [[East Anglia]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15255822 |title=BBC Sport - Darren Huckerby admits regret at manner of Norwich City exit |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2011-10-11 |accessdate=2013-12-22}}</ref>\n\nHe was voted Norwich City player of the year by supporters in 2004\u201305 and [[2006\u201307 in English football|2006\u201307]], and placed second behind [[Gary Doherty]] for the [[2005\u201306 in English football|2005\u201306]] season, winning the award twice and adding two runner-up positions in his first four seasons.
