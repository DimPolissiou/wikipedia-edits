Boryspil International Airport is a member of [[Airports Council International]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nOn 22 June 1959, the [[Council of Minister]]s of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] ordered the establishment of regular civil air traffic to the then military airfield near Boryspil. On 7 July 1959, the new airport (named Kiev-Tsentralnyi) received its first scheduled flight. It was [[Aeroflot]]'s [[Tupolev Tu-104]] en route from [[Moscow]], carrying 100 passengers and about 1,600&nbsp;kg of cargo. The first routes served were Moscow\u2013Kiev-Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]\u2013Kiev\u2013Leningrad.\n\nIn November 1960, the first permanent air group, consisting of Tu-104 and [[Antonov An-10]] planes, was assigned to the airport. Until then it had been served only by aircraft based in Moscow and other cities of the Soviet Union. A new passenger terminal was opened in 1965. Later that year, an automatic landing assistance system was installed.\n\nIn 1963, the Ukrainian Territorial Administration of Civil Aviation formed its Boryspil subdivision consisting of the airport and its air group. The air group grew significantly in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1974 it consisted of four fleets of [[turbojet]] aircraft ([[Tupolev Tu-104|Tu-104]] planes), [[turbofan]] aircraft ([[Tupolev Tu-134|Tu-134]], [[Tupolev Tu-154|Tu-154]] planes) and two fleets of [[turboprop]] aircraft ([[Ilyushin Il-18]] planes).\n\nToward the final decades of the [[Cold War]], the [[Soviet Air Force]] maintained a presence at Boryspil Airport with 1 VTAP (1st Military Aviation Transportation Regiment) flying [[Ilyushin Il-76]] cargo jets.\n\nBy the 1980s, Boryspil had begun receiving limited international flights. Additional passenger services and [[customs]]/[[border control]] groups were established for that purpose. However, ordinary Soviet citizens were not allowed to depart abroad from Kiev, being restricted to fly only from Moscow airports.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n===Development since the 1990s===\nIn 1993, the Ministry of Transportation of the newly independent Ukraine reorganized the airport into the Boryspil State International Airport and created a local subdivision of [[Air Ukraine]] to serve it. The airport was opened for any passengers and flights. The number of air and passenger traffic has been growing ever since.\n\nEarly in the 2000s, Boryspil became a hub airport serving destined and transit flights of foreign airlines. Its development strategy stresses the hub role since domestic passenger demand is growing insufficiently compared to the possible transit traffic. In 2001, a new runway was completed, and the airport carried 1.5 million passengers.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.sita.aero/content/ukraine%E2%80%99s-largest-airport-selects-sita-reach-18-million-passenger-target-2020|title=SITA - News releases|work=Sita. create success together|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> It is certified for [[Instrument landing system categories|Category III A ILS]] approaches.

Terminal B, with only eleven gates, two of which were [[jetway|air bridges]], was not enough to handle all international flights. This was the reason for the expansion of that terminal, which started in 2005. The first-stage expansion of Terminal B was opened on 27 January 2006. In 2008, passport control within Terminal B Departures was moved further east (along with the entrance to the main [[duty-free shop]] so that it remains airside).\n\nThere are plans to expand the airport further by building several new terminals. The government has been having meetings with the owners of nearby land, trying to buy more land for expansion. The construction of Terminal D was approved on 28 July 2008 and was completed in 2012 at a cost of UAH 1.661 billion (US$208 million). The terminal will have a capacity of 1,500 passengers per hour and cover an area of 44.9 hectares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/138815.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120917153849/http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/138815.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 September 2012|title=\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0456 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u0411\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> Platform M, which is connected to Terminal B and requires redevelopment, was to be reconstructed in 2009-2010. The reason for the delay in its reconstruction was the fact that Terminal B needs to be fully operational first. Now that Terminal D has opened (building began on 24 October 2008<ref name=\"D\">{{cite web|url=http://photo.unian.net/eng/themes/9871|title=Start of terminal \"D\" building at the airport \"Borispol\"|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref>), platform M can be reconstructed without having a major impact on traffic.\n\nThe construction of Terminal D was completed in 2012, with the terminal opening to passengers on 28 May 2012, increasing passenger handling facilities significantly. As of June 24, 2016, Terminal A, B, and F are out of operation. By 2020, if all plans proceed, the airport should have a capacity of 18 million passengers per year.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Terminals and infrastructure==\n===Terminals===\nBoryspil International Airport has one operational passenger terminals (D), one cargo terminal (F) and a VIP terminal. The largely overcrowded former domestic Terminal A was closed on 15 September 2011, in favor of transferring all domestic operations to nearby Terminal B. In 2013, all domestic and international operations were transferred from Terminal B to Terminal D.\n\n==== Terminal B ====\n[[File:Borispol B terminal.jpg|thumb|Terminal B]]\nTerminal B, the original Soviet-constructed building, used to serve domestic and international flights. It has undergone extensive, long-term reconstruction. The terminal hosted shops, cafes, travel agencies and banks, as well as offices of airlines and a business center. The ground floor features luggage storage, waiting-area, and check-in desks, whilst security and passport (immigration) control, the main departure lounge and the terminal's boarding gates are on the second floor.

It is also a hub and a home base of [[Ukraine International Airlines]]. It has been designed to support an integrated system for monitoring and directing arriving and departing passengers; this has been ensured by implementing a scheme of movement based on the principle of multi-level zoning \u2014 departing passengers use the airport's upper floors, whilst those arriving and yet to pass through immigration are processed on a lower level. The ground and first floors are used for airside service and the sorting of baggage. Airside, the first floor is used for arrivals zone and baggage hall. The fourth floor is reserved for airlines' lounges. The terminal can be accessed from the airport's central access road for arrivals and in the same way but via a ramp for departures level. The building features both [[jetbridge]]s and bus boarding stands and is equipped to handle wide-body aircraft such as Ukraine International Airlines' [[Boeing 777-200ER]]s.\n\nThe [[State Border Service of Ukraine|Ukrainian Border Guard]] and State Customs Service maintain control points for arriving and departing passengers (40 passport booths for arrivals and 28 for departures). The terminal has 11 gates equipped with jetways and additional 'bus gates'.\n\nTerminal D regularly features [[Ukrainian art]] exhibitions by such notables as [[Maria Prymachenko]] and [[Yuriy Khimich]], organised by the art fund \"Artaniya\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/ukraine/kyiv-post/20151127/281767038139920|title=PressReader.com - Connecting People Through News|website=www.pressreader.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://day.kyiv.ua/en/article/time-out/gallery-national-pride |title=\"The Gallery of National Pride\" &#124; The Day newspaper |publisher=Day.kyiv.ua |date=2013-06-04 |accessdate=2018-08-31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://uacrisis.org/55365-diyachi-ukrayini-3|title=An exhibition Prominent Ukrainians opens in Kyiv International Airport - UACRISIS.ORG|date=18 April 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==== Terminal F ====\n[[File:\u0410\u044d\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043c\u044b_\u0438_\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044b-\u0442\u0435\u0440\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043b,_\u041a\u0438\u0435\u0432_-_\u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c_RP94559.jpg|thumb|Terminal F]]\nTerminal F is a passenger terminal mostly used by low-cost carriers and was opened on 21 September 2010 as a home base for [[Ukraine International Airlines]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/city/detail/83206/|title=Yanukovych opens new terminal at Boryspil Airport - Sep. 21, 2010|date=21 September 2010|publisher=}}</ref> Terminal F started handling regular flights as of 31 October 2010, with an initial capacity of 900 passengers/hour.<ref>[http://www.kbp.com.ua/english/for-passengers/31-zhovtnya-2010-r.-z-terminalu-f-pochnut-zdiysnyuvatisya-mizhnarodni-reysi.html Since October 31, 2010, International Flights to be Operated Through Terminal F] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023092353/http://www.kbp.com.ua/english/for-passengers/31-zhovtnya-2010-r.-z-terminalu-f-pochnut-zdiysnyuvatisya-mizhnarodni-reysi.html |date=October 23, 2010 }}, [[Kyiv Post]] (August 11, 2010)</ref> The terminal is not equipped with jetways as it was originally meant to serve low-cost airlines.

This fleet compromises one [[Airbus A319]] for the use of the President of Ukraine, two long-haul [[Ilyushin Il-62]] aircraft and a number of smaller aircraft and helicopters for general government use. Currently, these aircraft are based near the covered hangars to the north of Terminal F.

Boryspil International Airport is a member of [[Airports Council International]].\n\n==History==\n\n===Early years===\nOn 22 June 1959, the [[Council of Minister]]s of the [[Ukrainian SSR]] ordered the establishment of regular civil air traffic to the then military airfield near Boryspil. On 7 July 1959, the new airport (named Kiev-Tsentralnyi) received its first scheduled flight. It was [[Aeroflot]]'s [[Tupolev Tu-104]] en route from [[Moscow]], carrying 100 passengers and about 1,600&nbsp;kg of cargo. The first routes served were Moscow\u2013Kiev-Moscow and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]\u2013Kiev\u2013Leningrad.\n\nIn November 1960, the first permanent air group, consisting of Tu-104 and [[Antonov An-10]] planes, was assigned to the airport. Until then it had been served only by aircraft based in Moscow and other cities of the Soviet Union. A new passenger terminal was opened in 1965. Later that year, an automatic landing assistance system was installed.\n\nIn 1963, the Ukrainian Territorial Administration of Civil Aviation formed its Boryspil subdivision consisting of the airport and its air group. The air group grew significantly in the 1960s and 1970s. In 1974 it consisted of four fleets of [[turbojet]] aircraft ([[Tupolev Tu-104|Tu-104]] planes), [[turbofan]] aircraft ([[Tupolev Tu-134|Tu-134]], [[Tupolev Tu-154|Tu-154]] planes) and two fleets of [[turboprop]] aircraft ([[Ilyushin Il-18]] planes).\n\nToward the final decades of the [[Cold War]], the [[Soviet Air Force]] maintained a presence at Boryspil Airport with 1 VTAP (1st Military Aviation Transportation Regiment) flying [[Ilyushin Il-76]] cargo jets.\n\nBy the 1980s, Boryspil had begun receiving limited international flights. Additional passenger services and [[customs]]/[[border control]] groups were established for that purpose. However, ordinary Soviet citizens were not allowed to depart abroad from Kiev, being restricted to fly only from Moscow airports.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}\n\n===Development since the 1990s===\nIn 1993, the Ministry of Transportation of the newly independent Ukraine reorganized the airport into the Boryspil State International Airport and created a local subdivision of [[Air Ukraine]] to serve it. The airport was opened for any passengers and flights. The number of air and passenger traffic has been growing ever since.\n\nEarly in the 2000s, Boryspil became a hub airport serving destined and transit flights of foreign airlines. Its development strategy stresses the hub role since domestic passenger demand is growing insufficiently compared to the possible transit traffic. In 2001, a new runway was completed, and the airport carried 1.5 million passengers.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.sita.aero/content/ukraine%E2%80%99s-largest-airport-selects-sita-reach-18-million-passenger-target-2020|title=SITA - News releases|work=Sita. create success together|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> It is certified for [[Instrument landing system categories|Category III A ILS]] approaches.

Terminal B, with only eleven gates, two of which were [[jetway|air bridges]], was not enough to handle all international flights. This was the reason for the expansion of that terminal, which started in 2005. The first-stage expansion of Terminal B was opened on 27 January 2006. In 2008, passport control within Terminal B Departures was moved further east (along with the entrance to the main [[duty-free shop]] so that it remains airside).\n\nThere are plans to expand the airport further by building several new terminals. The government has been having meetings with the owners of nearby land, trying to buy more land for expansion. The construction of Terminal D was approved on 28 July 2008 and was completed in 2012 at a cost of UAH 1.661 billion (US$208 million). The terminal will have a capacity of 1,500 passengers per hour and cover an area of 44.9 hectares.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/138815.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120917153849/http://www.ukranews.com/eng/article/138815.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 September 2012|title=\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0456 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u0411\u0438\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref> Platform M, which is connected to Terminal B and requires redevelopment, was to be reconstructed in 2009-2010. The reason for the delay in its reconstruction was the fact that Terminal B needs to be fully operational first. Now that Terminal D has opened (building began on 24 October 2008<ref name=\"D\">{{cite web|url=http://photo.unian.net/eng/themes/9871|title=Start of terminal \"D\" building at the airport \"Borispol\"|publisher=|accessdate=1 June 2015}}</ref>), platform M can be reconstructed without having a major impact on traffic.\n\nThe construction of Terminal D was completed in 2012, with the terminal opening to passengers on 28 May 2012, increasing passenger handling facilities significantly. As of June 24, 2016, Terminal A, B, and F are out of operation. By 2020, if all plans proceed, the airport should have a capacity of 18 million passengers per year.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Terminals and infrastructure==\n===Terminals===\nBoryspil International Airport has one operational passenger terminals (D), one cargo terminal (F) and a VIP terminal. The largely overcrowded former domestic Terminal A was closed on 15 September 2011, in favor of transferring all domestic operations to nearby Terminal B. In 2013, all domestic and international operations were transferred from Terminal B to Terminal D.\n\n==== Terminal B ====\n[[File:Borispol B terminal.jpg|thumb|Terminal B]]\nTerminal B, the original Soviet-constructed building, used to serve domestic and international flights. It has undergone extensive, long-term reconstruction. The terminal hosted shops, cafes, travel agencies and banks, as well as offices of airlines and a business center. The ground floor features luggage storage, waiting-area, and check-in desks, whilst security and passport (immigration) control, the main departure lounge and the terminal's boarding gates are on the second floor. After passport control, passengers wait in the departure lounge where there is a business lounge, a number of cafes, restaurants and duty-free shops. There is free [[Wireless Internet|Wi-Fi access]] in the building.<ref>[https://www.kyiv-airport.com/kyiv-boryspil/terminal-b.php kyiv-airport.com - KievKiev Borispol Airport Terminal B] retrieved 20 June 2018</ref> The terminal has two [[jetbridge]]s and several bus-boarding stands.

It is also a hub and a home base of [[Ukraine International Airlines]]. It has been designed to support an integrated system for monitoring and directing arriving and departing passengers; this has been ensured by implementing a scheme of movement based on the principle of multi-level zoning \u2014 departing passengers use the airport's upper floors, whilst those arriving and yet to pass through immigration are processed on a lower level. The ground and first floors are used for airside service and the sorting of baggage. Airside, the first floor is used for arrivals zone and baggage hall. The fourth floor is reserved for airlines' lounges. The terminal can be accessed from the airport's central access road for arrivals and in the same way but via a ramp for departures level.

This fleet compromises one [[Airbus A319]] for the use of the President of Ukraine, two long-haul [[Ilyushin Il-62]] aircraft and a number of smaller aircraft and helicopters for general government use. Currently, these aircraft are based near the covered hangars to the north of Terminal F.
