Always the Last to Know}}</ref> The character and series were created by Jim French. Harry Nile is a hard-luck private detective who is not rich or famous, but he has integrity and cares about his clients. He is assisted on his cases by Murphy, an intelligent former librarian. Nile was formerly a cop in Chicago; his real last name was Niletti, but he changed it before he joined the police force to protect his family from potential retaliation from the Mob. Jim French explained the origins of Harry Nile's name: \"It's a twisted anagram of 'Harry Lime', a favorite character from the film ''[[The Third Man]]''. Originally, I thought I'd make Harry Nile a more mysterious character than he finally came to be.\"<ref name=nile>{{cite web |url=https://www.old-time.com/otrlogs2/hrynl_sw.log.pdf |website=Old-Time Radio |title=The Adventures of Harry Nile: Broadcast Log |last=Wright |first=Stewart |date=April 30, 2019 |access-date= January 12, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe first four episodes aired as part of Jim French's anthology radio series ''Crisis''.

A sub-series titled ''War Comes to Harry Nile'' (2007\u20132016) aired as part of ''The Adventures of Harry Nile'', and follows the title character's adventures during World War II. There are 18 episodes in ''War Comes to Harry Nile''. As of 2019, six episodes of ''The Adventures of Harry Nile'' are new productions of previously used scripts. For instance, episode 124, \"Little Boy Lost\" (2000), is a re-working of episode 34, \"The Case of The Midnight Caller\" (1992).<ref name=nile/>\n\nHarry Nile was voiced by [[Phil Harper]] through episode 156 (which aired in 2004), and has been played by Lawrence Albert since episode 157 (2005). The character Murphy, portrayed by Pat French through episode 230 (2011) and by Mary Anne Dorward from episode 232 (2011), has been played by Mary Kae Irvin since episode 294 (2017).

''Kermit's Swamp Years'' was released on VHS and DVD and on the [[Starz]] network on August 18, 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/tv/20020818tvweek2.asp|title=Kermit the Frog stars in his own movie prequel|website=old.post-gazette.com|access-date=2019-02-14}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the film rights are still owned by [[Sony Pictures]] rather than [[The Walt Disney Company]], ''Kermit's Swamp Years'' was filmed at the Disney-MGM Studios, which is now known as [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie opens in the swamp lands that [[Kermit the Frog]] calls home. After meeting his old friend Horace D'Fly again, he recaps an adventure about his childhood where he enjoyed a serene amphibian's life with his smooth and confident best friend, Croaker the [[Frog]], and a nervous and cowardly friend of his, Goggles the [[Toad]]. Young Kermit wonders what lies beyond the swamp, but his companions do not think the same. The friends run into two scientists, Dr. Hugo Krassman ([[John Hostetter]]) and Mary (Kelly Collins Lintz), intent on capturing frogs. Arnie the [[alligator]] saves them and warns them about the dangers lurking outside the swamp. The next day, they run into the bully Blotch, a [[American bullfrog|bullfrog]], who attacks Goggles. The fight spills onto a road, where the pair are taken by a pet store owner named Wilson (William Bookston), and Kermit and Croaker venture forth on a quest to save their friends.\n\nWhen Goggles and Blotch are taken into a pet store, Blotch's anger causes the pair to be put in a cage with Vicki the [[snake]], who intends to eat Blotch. Goggles saves him by goading Vicki to attack him and then using his poison gland. Meanwhile, the other animals at the store manage to convince Goggles and Blotch in a lively musical number that being sold to someone as a pet isn't such a bad idea.\n\nAfter getting run over by Wilson's truck and having tire tracks on his chest, Croaker is no longer able to hop and starts to lose his bravery. Kermit and Croaker meet a stray dog named Pilgrim (voiced by [[Cree Summer]]), who saves them from Krassman and Mary, then decides to help them find their friends. Kermit is able to find Wilson's truck by using helium balloons, but discovers they are no longer in the vehicle. Kermit reconnects with Pilgrim and Croaker again, and together they find Wilson's Pet Store. After Kermit gives him a short [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pep_talk pep talk], Croaker finally manages to hop again by hopping through the window and helps Kermit up the window, but they find out from Vicki that their friends have gone to George Washington High School.\n\nThe next day, Kermit and Croaker intentionally get discovered by Wilson to get taken to the high school and escape upon arrival. They meet Pilgrim again, who followed them. While trying to find Goggles and Blotch, Pilgrim and Croaker get captured by Wilson. Kermit overhears Wilson heading to biology class, so he hitches a ride on a student's backpack. Krassman decides to dissect Goggles, but Blotch takes his place to return the favor for rescuing them from Vicki. Krassman discides to dissect Croaker instead, when Wilson brings him into the class. Mary refuses to show the class how the dissection is done, so she leaves the classroom. In a daring rescue, Kermit manages to free Croaker from the dissection table and fend off Dr. Krassman using some swashbuckling techniques he picked up earlier at a movie theater, but Krassman is able to defeat Kermit, Croaker, and Blotch. Goggles finds the knife that Kermit dropped, but after he picks it up, Krassman spots him. Despite the warnings that Kermit should never talk to humans, Kermit stops Krassman from dissecting Goggles by talking and asks him to please release the frogs. This decision by Kermit reveals that Krassman, as a child, when he was going to dissect his first frog, the frog spoke to him, but he refused to say it out loud to everyone else in Krassman's classroom, which caused him to be humiliated. With the truth revealed that frogs can talk, Krassman frees all the frogs and dismisses the class and enables Kermit and his friends to return home.

''Kermit's Swamp Years'' was released on VHS and DVD and on the [[Starz]] network on August 18, 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://old.post-gazette.com/tv/20020818tvweek2.asp|title=Kermit the Frog stars in his own movie prequel|website=old.post-gazette.com|access-date=2019-02-14}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the film rights are still owned by [[Sony Pictures]] rather than [[The Walt Disney Company]], ''Kermit's Swamp Years'' was filmed at the Disney-MGM Studios, which is now known as [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie opens in the swamp lands that [[Kermit the Frog]] calls home. After meeting his old friend Horace D'Fly again, he recaps an adventure about his childhood where he enjoyed a serene amphibian's life with his smooth and confident best friend, Croaker the [[Frog]], and a nervous and cowardly friend of his, Goggles the [[Toad]]. Young Kermit wonders what lies beyond the swamp, but his companions do not think the same. The friends run into two scientists, Dr. Hugo Krassman ([[John Hostetter]]) and Mary (Kelly Collins Lintz), intent on capturing frogs. Arnie the [[alligator]] saves them and warns them about the dangers lurking outside the swamp. The next day, they run into the bully Blotch, a [[American bullfrog|bullfrog]], who attacks Goggles. The fight spills onto a road, where the pair are taken by a pet store owner named Wilson (William Bookston), and Kermit and Croaker venture forth on a quest to save their friends.\n\nWhen Goggles and Blotch are taken into a pet store, Blotch's anger causes the pair to be put in a cage with Vicki the [[snake]], who intends to eat Blotch. Goggles saves him by goading Vicki to attack him and then using his poison gland. Meanwhile, the other animals at the store manage to convince Goggles and Blotch in a lively musical number that being sold to someone as a pet isn't such a bad idea.\n\nAfter getting run over by Wilson's truck and having tire tracks on his chest, Croaker is no longer able to hop and starts to lose his bravery. Kermit and Croaker meet a stray dog named Pilgrim (voiced by [[Cree Summer]]), who saves them from Krassman and Mary, then decides to help them find their friends. Kermit is able to find Wilson's truck by using helium balloons, but discovers they are no longer in the vehicle. Kermit reconnects with Pilgrim and Croaker again, and together they find Wilson's Pet Store. After Kermit gives him a short [https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/pep_talk pep talk], Croaker finally manages to hop again by hopping through the window and helps Kermit up the window, but they find out from Vicki that their friends have gone to George Washington High School.\n\nThe next day, Kermit and Croaker intentionally get discovered by Wilson to get taken to the high school and escape upon arrival. They meet Pilgrim again, who followed them. While trying to find Goggles and Blotch, Pilgrim and Croaker get captured by Wilson. Kermit overhears Wilson heading to biology class, so he hitches a ride on a student's backpack. Krassman decides to dissect Goggles, but Blotch takes his place to return the favor for rescuing them from Vicki. Krassman discides to dissect Croaker instead, when Wilson brings him into the class. Mary refuses to show the class how the dissection is done, so she leaves the classroom. In a daring rescue, Kermit manages to free Croaker from the dissection table and fend off Dr. Krassman using some swashbuckling techniques he picked up earlier at a movie theater, but Krassman is able to defeat Kermit, Croaker, and Blotch. Goggles finds the knife that Kermit dropped, but after he picks it up, Krassman spots him. Despite the warnings that Kermit should never talk to humans, Kermit stops Krassman from dissecting Goggles by talking and asks him to please release the frogs. This decision by Kermit reveals that Krassman, as a child, when he was going to dissect his first frog, the frog spoke to him, but he refused to say it out loud to everyone else in Krassman's classroom, which caused him to be humiliated. With the truth revealed that frogs can talk, Krassman frees all the frogs and dismisses the class and enables Kermit and his friends to return home. After a ride back on Wilson's truck, Wilson adopts Pilgrim and the four friends head back home.\n\nBack in the present, Kermit enters the swamp to meet up with his three old friends, and Horace D'Fly is seen singing.\n\n==Cast==\n* William Bookston - Wilson\n* [[John Hostetter]] - Hugo Krassman\n* Christian Kebbel - Young [[Jim Henson]]\n* Kelly Collins Lintz - Mary\n* [[Cree Summer]] - Pilgrim the Dog (voice), Kermit the Frog's Mom (voice)\n\n===Muppet performers===\n* [[Steve Whitmire]] - Kermit the Frog, Jack the Rabbit, Chico the Frog\n* [[Joey Mazzarino]] - Goggles the Toad, Turtle #1\n* [[Bill Barretta]] - Croaker the Frog, Horace D'Fly, Roy the Frog, Turtle #2\n* [[Alice Dinnean]] - Vicki the Snake, Kermit the Frog's Mom (puppeteer), Pilgrim the Dog (puppeteer)\n* [[John Kennedy (puppeteer)|John Kennedy]] - Arnie the Alligator, Blotch the Bullfrog, Monkey\n* [[Dave Goelz]] - Young [[Statler and Waldorf|Waldorf]]\n* [[Jerry Nelson]] - Young [[Statler and Waldorf|Statler]]\n\n==Production notes==\nGoggles and Croaker were performed by [[Joey Mazzarino]] and [[Bill Barretta]], respectively.
