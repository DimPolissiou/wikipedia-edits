innovate responses including diagnostics, drugs and vaccines; use the evidence to inform the development of the most effective models of care\n*Mitigate: provide the best care possible for people who become ill, support hospitals to maintain essential services and ensure ongoing support for people ill in the community, to minimise the overall impact of the disease on society, public services and on the economy.<ref name=\"Plan2020\">Department of Health and Social Care, Emergency and Health Protection Directorate, [https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/869827/Coronavirus_action_plan_-_a_guide_to_what_you_can_expect_across_the_UK.pdf Coronavirus: action plan: A guide to what you can expect across the UK] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304131952/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/869827/Coronavirus_action_plan_-_a_guide_to_what_you_can_expect_across_the_UK.pdf|date=4 March 2020}}, published 3 March, accessed 7 March 2020</ref>\n\nThe four UK CMOs raised the UK risk level from low to moderate on 30 January 2020, upon the WHO's announcement of the disease as a [[Public Health Emergency of International Concern]].<ref name=\"gov.uk2Update\" /><ref name=\"Russell13Feb2020\" /> As soon as cases appeared in the UK on 31 January 2020, a public health information campaign, similar to the previous \"[[Catch it, Bin it, Kill it]]\" campaign, was launched in the UK, to advise people how to lessen the risk of spreading the virus.<ref name=\"Russell13Feb2020\" /> Travellers from Hubei province in China, including the capital Wuhan were advised to self-isolate, \"stay at home, not go to work, school or public places, not use public transport or taxis, ask friends, family members or delivery services to do errands\",<ref name=\"NHS.ukCOVID\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/|title=Coronavirus (COVID-19)|last=|first=|date=24 January 2020|website=nhs.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200302222456/https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/|archive-date=2 March 2020|access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref> and call [[NHS 111]] if they had arrived in the UK in previous 14 days, regardless of whether they were unwell or not.<ref name=\"Russell13Feb2020\" /> Further cases in early February prompted the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Matt Hancock, to announce the [[Health Protection (Coronavirus) Regulations 2020]].<ref name=\"gov.uk2Update\" /> Daily updates have been published by the DHSC.<ref name=\"gov.uk2Update\" /> [[NHS Digital]] in the meanwhile, have been collecting data.<ref name=\"RapsonHSJ\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/patient-safety/nhs-collecting-coronavirus-data-from-111-calls/7026999.article|title=NHS collecting coronavirus data from 111 calls|last=Rapson|first=Jasmine|date=|website=Health Service Journal|url-access=subscription|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref>\n[[File:Catch it, Bin it, Kill it poster.jpg|thumb|upright|Poster for the \"Catch it, Bin it, Kill it\" slogan which has been revived in the fight against coronavirus]]\nOn 25 February 2020, the UK's CMOs advice for all travellers (unwell or not) who had returned to the UK from Hubei province in the previous 14 days, Iran, specific areas designated by the Italian government as quarantine areas in northern Italy and special care zones in South Korea since 19 February, to self-isolate and call NHS 111.<ref name=\"gov.uk15Feb2020\">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-staff-in-the-transport-sector/covid-19-guidance-for-staff-in-the-transport-sector|title=COVID-19: guidance for staff in the transport sector|publisher=Government of the United Kingdom|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220133756/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-for-staff-in-the-transport-sector/covid-19-guidance-for-staff-in-the-transport-sector|archive-date=20 February 2020|access-date=15 February 2020}}</ref> This advice was also advocated for any person who has flu-like symptoms with a history of travelling from Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and areas in Italy north of Pisa, Florence and Rimini, returning to the UK since 19 February.

Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that

Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that

For this reason, \"Follow the Water\" was the science theme of [[NASA]]'s [[Mars Exploration Program]] (MEP) in the first decade of the 21st century. NASA and [[European Space Agency|ESA]] missions including [[2001 Mars Odyssey]], [[Mars Express]], [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s (MERs), [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (MRO), and Mars [[Phoenix Lander|''Phoenix'' lander]] have provided information about water's abundance and distribution on Mars.<ref>NASA Mars Exploration Program Overview. http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/overview/index.html.</ref> Mars Odyssey, Mars Express, MRO, and [[Curiosity (rover)|Mars Science Lander ''Curiosity'' rover]] are still operating, and discoveries continue to be made.\n\n== Historical background ==\n{{Main|History of Mars observation}}\nThe notion of water on Mars preceded the [[space age]] by hundreds of years. Early [[Optical telescope|telescopic]] observers correctly assumed that the white polar caps and clouds were indications of water's presence. These observations, coupled with the fact that Mars has a 24-hour day, led astronomer [[William Herschel]] to declare in 1784 that Mars probably offered its inhabitants \"a situation in many respects similar to ours.\"<ref>Sheehan, 1996, p. 35.</ref>\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Karte Mars Schiaparelli MKL1888.png\n| width1 = 220\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Historical map of Mars from [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]].\n| image2 = Lowell Mars channels.jpg\n| width2 = 220\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Mars canals illustrated by astronomer [[Percival Lowell]], 1898.\n| footer = \n}}\n\nBy the start of the 20th century, most astronomers recognized that Mars was far colder and drier than Earth. The presence of oceans was no longer accepted, so the paradigm changed to an image of Mars as a \"dying\" planet with only a meager amount of water. The dark areas, which could be seen to change seasonally, were then thought to be tracts of vegetation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kieffer |first=H.H. |last2=Jakosky |first2=B.M |last3=Snyder |first3=C. |date=1992 |chapter=The Planet Mars: From Antiquity to the Present |title=Mars |editor-first=H.H. |editor-last=Kieffer |display-editors=etal |publisher=University of Arizona Press |location=Tucson, AZ |pages=1\u201333}}</ref> The man most responsible for popularizing this view of Mars was [[Percival Lowell]] (1855\u20131916), who imagined a race of Martians constructing a network of [[Martian canal|canals]] to bring water from the poles to the inhabitants at the equator. Although generating tremendous public enthusiasm, Lowell's ideas were rejected by most astronomers. The majority view of the scientific establishment at the time is probably best summarized by English astronomer [[Edward Walter Maunder]] (1851\u20131928) who compared the climate of Mars to conditions atop a twenty-thousand-foot peak on an arctic island<ref>hartmann, 2003, p. 20.</ref> where only [[lichen]] might be expected to survive.\n\nIn the meantime, many astronomers were refining the tool of planetary [[spectroscopy]] in hope of determining the composition of the [[Martian atmosphere]]. Between 1925 and 1943, [[Walter Sydney Adams|Walter Adams]] and [[Theodore Dunham, Jr.|Theodore Dunham]] at the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] tried to identify oxygen and water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, with generally negative results. The only component of the Martian atmosphere known for certain was carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) identified spectroscopically by [[Gerard Kuiper]] in 1947.<ref>Sheehan, 1996, p. 150.</ref> Water vapor was not unequivocally detected on Mars until 1963.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Spinrad |first=H. |last2=M\u00fcnch |first2=G. |last3=Kaplan |first3=L.

This hypothesis was confirmed theoretically by [[Robert B. Leighton|Robert Leighton]] and [[Bruce C. Murray|Bruce Murray]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Leighton |first=R.B. |last2=Murray |first2=B.C. |date=1966 |title=Behavior of Carbon Dioxide and Other Volatiles on Mars |journal=Science |volume=153 |issue=3732 |pages=136\u2013144 |doi=10.1126/science.153.3732.136 |pmid=17831495|bibcode=1966Sci...153..136L }}</ref> Today it is known that the winter caps at both poles are primarily composed of CO<sub>2</sub> ice, but that a permanent (or perennial) cap of water ice remains during the summer at the northern pole. At the southern pole, a small cap of CO<sub>2</sub> ice remains during summer, but this cap too is underlain by water ice.\n\nThe final piece of the Martian climate puzzle was provided by [[Mariner 4]] in 1965. Grainy television pictures from the spacecraft showed a surface dominated by [[impact crater]]s, which implied that the surface was very old and had not experienced the level of erosion and tectonic activity seen on Earth. Little erosion meant that liquid water had probably not played a large role in the planet's [[geomorphology]] for billions of years.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Leighton |first=R.B. |author2=Murray, B.C. |author3=Sharp, R.P. |author4=Allen, J.D. |author5=Sloan, R.K. |date=1965 |title=Mariner IV Photography of Mars: Initial Results |journal=Science |volume=149 |issue=3684 |pages=627\u2013630 |doi=10.1126/science.149.3684.627 |pmid=17747569|bibcode=1965Sci...149..627L }}</ref> Furthermore, the variations in the radio signal from the spacecraft as it passed behind the planet allowed scientists to calculate the density of the atmosphere.

The process creates a highly alkaline and reducing (low Eh) environment favoring the formation of certain phyllosilicates (serpentine minerals) and various carbonate minerals, which together form a rock called [[serpentinite]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schrenk |first=M.O. |last2=Brazelton |first2=W.J. |last3=Lang |first3=S.Q. |date=2013 |title=Serpentinization, Carbon, and Deep Life |journal=Reviews in Mineralogy & Geochemistry |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=575\u2013606 |doi=10.2138/rmg.2013.75.18|bibcode=2013RvMG...75..575S |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/778e1cb021137cfb2bb986456c72da9c3d2306b7 }}</ref> The hydrogen gas produced can be an important energy source for [[chemosynthesis|chemosynthtetic]] organisms or it can react with CO<sub>2</sub> to produce [[methane]] gas, a process that has been considered as a non-biological source for the trace amounts of methane reported in the Martian atmosphere.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Baucom |first=Martin |title=Life on Mars? |journal=American Scientist |date=March\u2013April 2006 |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=119 |doi=10.1511/2006.58.119 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/life-on-mars}}</ref> Serpentine minerals can also store a lot of water (as hydroxyl) in their crystal structure.

Although earlier research had showed that Mars had a warm and wet early history that has long since dried up, these lakes existed in the [[Hesperian]] Epoch, a much later period. Using detailed images from NASA's [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]], the researchers speculate that there may have been increased volcanic activity, meteorite impacts or shifts in Mars' orbit during this period to warm Mars' atmosphere enough to melt the abundant ice present in the ground. Volcanoes would have released gases that thickened the atmosphere for a temporary period, trapping more sunlight and making it warm enough for liquid water to exist. In this study, channels were discovered that connected lake basins near [[Ares Vallis]]. When one lake filled up, its waters overflowed the banks and carved the channels to a lower area where another lake would form.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/100104092452.htm |title=Spectacular Mars images reveal evidence of ancient lakes |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=January 4, 2010 |access-date=February 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823210537/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/100104092452.htm |archive-date=August 23, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1130/G30579.1 |last=Gupta |first=Sanjeev |last2=Warner |first2=Nicholas |last3=Kim |first3=Rack |last4=Lin |first4=Yuan |last5=Muller |first5=Jan |last6=-1#Jung- |first6=Shih- |date=2010 |title=Hesperian equatorial thermokarst lakes in Ares Vallis as evidence for transient warm conditions on Mars |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=71\u201374|bibcode=2010Geo....38...71W }}</ref> These dry lakes would be targets to look for evidence ([[biosignature]]s) of past life.\n\nOn September 27, 2012, NASA scientists announced that the ''[[Curiosity rover]]'' found direct evidence for an ancient [[streambed]] in [[Gale Crater]], suggesting an ancient \"vigorous flow\" of water on Mars.<ref name=\"NASA-20120927\" /><ref name=\"NASA-20120927a\" /><ref name=\"AP-20120927\" /><ref name=\"ancient life\">{{cite news |title=NASA Rover Finds Conditions Once Suited for Ancient Life on Mars |date=March 12, 2013 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/news/msl20130312.html |publisher=NASA}}</ref> In particular, analysis of the now dry streambed indicated that the water ran at {{convert|3.3|km/h|m/s|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"NASA-20120927\" /> possibly at hip-depth.

This finding was derived from the ratio of water and [[deuterium]] in the modern Martian atmosphere compared to the ratio found on Earth. Eight times as much deuterium was found at Mars than exists on Earth, suggesting that ancient Mars had significantly higher levels of water. Results from the [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'']] rover had previously found a high ratio of deuterium in [[Gale Crater]], though not significantly high enough to suggest the presence of an ocean.

The tsunamis were caused by asteroids striking the ocean.  Both were thought to have been strong enough to create 30&nbsp;km diameter craters. The first tsunami picked up and carried boulders the size of cars or small houses. The backwash from the wave formed channels by rearranging the boulders. The second came in when the ocean was 300 m lower. The second carried a great deal of ice which was dropped in valleys. Calculations show that the average height of the waves would have been 50 m, but the heights would vary from 10 m to 120 m. Numerical simulations show that in this particular part of the ocean two impact craters of the size of 30&nbsp;km in diameter would form every 30 million years. The implication here is that a great northern ocean may have existed for millions of years. One argument against an ocean has been the lack of shoreline features. These features may have been washed away by these tsunami events.  The parts of Mars studied in this research are [[Chryse Planitia]] and northwestern [[Arabia Terra]]. These tsunamis affected some surfaces in the Ismenius Lacus quadrangle and in the [[Mare Acidalium quadrangle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://astrobiology.com/2016/05/ancient-tsunami-evidence-on-mars-reveals-life-potential.html|title=Ancient Tsunami Evidence on Mars Reveals Life Potential \u2013 Astrobiology|website=astrobiology.com}}</ref><ref>Rodriguez, J., et al.  2016.

The crater is {{convert|35|km}} wide and about {{convert|2|km}} deep. The height difference between the crater floor and the surface of the water ice is about {{convert|200|m}}. ESA scientists have attributed most of this height difference to sand dunes beneath the water ice, which are partially visible. While scientists do not refer to the patch as a \"lake\", the water ice patch is remarkable for its size and for being present throughout the year. Deposits of water ice and layers of frost have been found in many different locations on the planet.\n\nAs more and more of the surface of Mars has been imaged by the modern generation of orbiters, it has become gradually more apparent that there are probably many more patches of ice scattered across the Martian surface. Many of these putative patches of ice are concentrated in the Martian midlatitudes (\u224830\u201360\u00b0 N/S of the equator). For example, many scientists think that the widespread features in those latitude bands variously described as \"latitude dependent mantle\" or \"pasted-on terrain\" consist of dust- or debris-covered ice patches, which are slowly degrading.<ref name=\"Carr\" /> A cover of debris is required both to explain the dull surfaces seen in the images that do not reflect like ice, and also to allow the patches to exist for an extended period of time without subliming away completely. These patches have been suggested as possible water sources for some of the enigmatic channelized flow features like [[Martian Gullies|gullies]] also seen in those latitudes.\n\nSurface features consistent with existing [[pack ice]] have been discovered in the southern [[Elysium Planitia]].<ref name=\"Cabrol, N 2010\">{{cite book |editor-last=Cabrol |editor-first=N. |editor2-first=E. |editor2-last=Grin |date=2010 |title=Lakes on Mars |publisher=Elsevier |location=New York}}</ref> What appear to be plates, ranging in size from {{convert|30|m}} to {{convert|30|km}}, are found in channels leading to a large flooded area.

Such features are abundant in glaciated regions on Earth, so their absence on Mars has proven puzzling. The lack of these landforms is thought to be related to the cold-based nature of the ice in most recent glaciers on Mars. Because the [[solar insolation]] reaching the planet, the temperature and density of the atmosphere, and the [[Geothermal gradient|geothermal heat flux]] are all lower on Mars than they are on Earth, modelling suggests the temperature of the interface between a glacier and its bed stays below freezing and the ice is literally frozen down to the ground.

Changes in Mars' orbit and tilt cause significant changes in the distribution of water ice from polar regions down to latitudes equivalent to Texas. During certain climate periods water vapor leaves polar ice and enters the atmosphere. The water returns to the ground at lower latitudes as deposits of frost or snow mixed generously with dust. The atmosphere of Mars contains a great deal of fine dust particles.<ref name=\"Head 2008 PNAS\" /> Water vapor condenses on the particles, then they fall down to the ground due to the additional weight of the water coating.

For this reason, \"Follow the Water\" was the science theme of [[NASA]]'s [[Mars Exploration Program]] (MEP) in the first decade of the 21st century. NASA and [[European Space Agency|ESA]] missions including [[2001 Mars Odyssey]], [[Mars Express]], [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s (MERs), [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] (MRO), and Mars [[Phoenix Lander|''Phoenix'' lander]] have provided information about water's abundance and distribution on Mars.<ref>NASA Mars Exploration Program Overview. http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mars/overview/index.html.</ref> Mars Odyssey, Mars Express, MRO, and [[Curiosity (rover)|Mars Science Lander ''Curiosity'' rover]] are still operating, and discoveries continue to be made.\n\n== Historical background ==\n{{Main|History of Mars observation}}\nThe notion of water on Mars preceded the [[space age]] by hundreds of years. Early [[Optical telescope|telescopic]] observers correctly assumed that the white polar caps and clouds were indications of water's presence. These observations, coupled with the fact that Mars has a 24-hour day, led astronomer [[William Herschel]] to declare in 1784 that Mars probably offered its inhabitants \"a situation in many respects similar to ours.\"<ref>Sheehan, 1996, p. 35.</ref>\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Karte Mars Schiaparelli MKL1888.png\n| width1 = 220\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = Historical map of Mars from [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]].\n| image2 = Lowell Mars channels.jpg\n| width2 = 220\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = Mars canals illustrated by astronomer [[Percival Lowell]], 1898.\n| footer = \n}}\n\nBy the start of the 20th century, most astronomers recognized that Mars was far colder and drier than Earth. The presence of oceans was no longer accepted, so the paradigm changed to an image of Mars as a \"dying\" planet with only a meager amount of water. The dark areas, which could be seen to change seasonally, were then thought to be tracts of vegetation.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kieffer |first=H.H. |last2=Jakosky |first2=B.M |last3=Snyder |first3=C. |date=1992 |chapter=The Planet Mars: From Antiquity to the Present |title=Mars |editor-first=H.H. |editor-last=Kieffer |display-editors=etal |publisher=University of Arizona Press |location=Tucson, AZ |pages=1\u201333}}</ref> The man most responsible for popularizing this view of Mars was [[Percival Lowell]] (1855\u20131916), who imagined a race of Martians constructing a network of [[Martian canal|canals]] to bring water from the poles to the inhabitants at the equator. Although generating tremendous public enthusiasm, Lowell's ideas were rejected by most astronomers. The majority view of the scientific establishment at the time is probably best summarized by English astronomer [[Edward Walter Maunder]] (1851\u20131928) who compared the climate of Mars to conditions atop a twenty-thousand-foot peak on an arctic island<ref>hartmann, 2003, p. 20.</ref> where only [[lichen]] might be expected to survive.\n\nIn the meantime, many astronomers were refining the tool of planetary [[spectroscopy]] in hope of determining the composition of the [[Martian atmosphere]]. Between 1925 and 1943, [[Walter Sydney Adams|Walter Adams]] and [[Theodore Dunham, Jr.|Theodore Dunham]] at the [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] tried to identify oxygen and water vapor in the Martian atmosphere, with generally negative results. The only component of the Martian atmosphere known for certain was carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) identified spectroscopically by [[Gerard Kuiper]] in 1947.<ref>Sheehan, 1996, p. 150.</ref> Water vapor was not unequivocally detected on Mars until 1963.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Spinrad |first=H. |last2=M\u00fcnch |first2=G. |last3=Kaplan |first3=L.

This hypothesis was confirmed theoretically by [[Robert B. Leighton|Robert Leighton]] and [[Bruce C. Murray|Bruce Murray]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Leighton |first=R.B. |last2=Murray |first2=B.C. |date=1966 |title=Behavior of Carbon Dioxide and Other Volatiles on Mars |journal=Science |volume=153 |issue=3732 |pages=136\u2013144 |doi=10.1126/science.153.3732.136 |pmid=17831495|bibcode=1966Sci...153..136L }}</ref> Today it is known that the winter caps at both poles are primarily composed of CO<sub>2</sub> ice, but that a permanent (or perennial) cap of water ice remains during the summer at the northern pole. At the southern pole, a small cap of CO<sub>2</sub> ice remains during summer, but this cap too is underlain by water ice.\n\nThe final piece of the Martian climate puzzle was provided by [[Mariner 4]] in 1965. Grainy television pictures from the spacecraft showed a surface dominated by [[impact crater]]s, which implied that the surface was very old and had not experienced the level of erosion and tectonic activity seen on Earth. Little erosion meant that liquid water had probably not played a large role in the planet's [[geomorphology]] for billions of years.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Leighton |first=R.B. |author2=Murray, B.C. |author3=Sharp, R.P. |author4=Allen, J.D. |author5=Sloan, R.K. |date=1965 |title=Mariner IV Photography of Mars: Initial Results |journal=Science |volume=149 |issue=3684 |pages=627\u2013630 |doi=10.1126/science.149.3684.627 |pmid=17747569|bibcode=1965Sci...149..627L }}</ref> Furthermore, the variations in the radio signal from the spacecraft as it passed behind the planet allowed scientists to calculate the density of the atmosphere.

The process creates a highly alkaline and reducing (low Eh) environment favoring the formation of certain phyllosilicates (serpentine minerals) and various carbonate minerals, which together form a rock called [[serpentinite]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Schrenk |first=M.O. |last2=Brazelton |first2=W.J. |last3=Lang |first3=S.Q. |date=2013 |title=Serpentinization, Carbon, and Deep Life |journal=Reviews in Mineralogy & Geochemistry |volume=75 |issue=1 |pages=575\u2013606 |doi=10.2138/rmg.2013.75.18|bibcode=2013RvMG...75..575S |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/778e1cb021137cfb2bb986456c72da9c3d2306b7 }}</ref> The hydrogen gas produced can be an important energy source for [[chemosynthesis|chemosynthtetic]] organisms or it can react with CO<sub>2</sub> to produce [[methane]] gas, a process that has been considered as a non-biological source for the trace amounts of methane reported in the Martian atmosphere.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Baucom |first=Martin |title=Life on Mars? |journal=American Scientist |date=March\u2013April 2006 |volume=94 |issue=2 |pages=119 |doi=10.1511/2006.58.119 |url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/life-on-mars}}</ref> Serpentine minerals can also store a lot of water (as hydroxyl) in their crystal structure.

Although earlier research had showed that Mars had a warm and wet early history that has long since dried up, these lakes existed in the [[Hesperian]] Epoch, a much later period. Using detailed images from NASA's [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]], the researchers speculate that there may have been increased volcanic activity, meteorite impacts or shifts in Mars' orbit during this period to warm Mars' atmosphere enough to melt the abundant ice present in the ground. Volcanoes would have released gases that thickened the atmosphere for a temporary period, trapping more sunlight and making it warm enough for liquid water to exist. In this study, channels were discovered that connected lake basins near [[Ares Vallis]]. When one lake filled up, its waters overflowed the banks and carved the channels to a lower area where another lake would form.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/100104092452.htm |title=Spectacular Mars images reveal evidence of ancient lakes |publisher=Sciencedaily.com |date=January 4, 2010 |access-date=February 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823210537/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/01/100104092452.htm |archive-date=August 23, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1130/G30579.1 |last=Gupta |first=Sanjeev |last2=Warner |first2=Nicholas |last3=Kim |first3=Rack |last4=Lin |first4=Yuan |last5=Muller |first5=Jan |last6=-1#Jung- |first6=Shih- |date=2010 |title=Hesperian equatorial thermokarst lakes in Ares Vallis as evidence for transient warm conditions on Mars |journal=Geology |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=71\u201374|bibcode=2010Geo....38...71W }}</ref> These dry lakes would be targets to look for evidence ([[biosignature]]s) of past life.\n\nOn September 27, 2012, NASA scientists announced that the ''[[Curiosity rover]]'' found direct evidence for an ancient [[streambed]] in [[Gale Crater]], suggesting an ancient \"vigorous flow\" of water on Mars.<ref name=\"NASA-20120927\" /><ref name=\"NASA-20120927a\" /><ref name=\"AP-20120927\" /><ref name=\"ancient life\">{{cite news |title=NASA Rover Finds Conditions Once Suited for Ancient Life on Mars |date=March 12, 2013 |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/msl/news/msl20130312.html |publisher=NASA}}</ref> In particular, analysis of the now dry streambed indicated that the water ran at {{convert|3.3|km/h|m/s|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"NASA-20120927\" /> possibly at hip-depth.

This finding was derived from the ratio of water and [[deuterium]] in the modern Martian atmosphere compared to the ratio found on Earth. Eight times as much deuterium was found at Mars than exists on Earth, suggesting that ancient Mars had significantly higher levels of water. Results from the [[Curiosity (rover)|''Curiosity'']] rover had previously found a high ratio of deuterium in [[Gale Crater]], though not significantly high enough to suggest the presence of an ocean.

The tsunamis were caused by asteroids striking the ocean.  Both were thought to have been strong enough to create 30&nbsp;km diameter craters. The first tsunami picked up and carried boulders the size of cars or small houses. The backwash from the wave formed channels by rearranging the boulders. The second came in when the ocean was 300 m lower. The second carried a great deal of ice which was dropped in valleys. Calculations show that the average height of the waves would have been 50 m, but the heights would vary from 10 m to 120 m. Numerical simulations show that in this particular part of the ocean two impact craters of the size of 30&nbsp;km in diameter would form every 30 million years. The implication here is that a great northern ocean may have existed for millions of years. One argument against an ocean has been the lack of shoreline features. These features may have been washed away by these tsunami events.  The parts of Mars studied in this research are [[Chryse Planitia]] and northwestern [[Arabia Terra]]. These tsunamis affected some surfaces in the Ismenius Lacus quadrangle and in the [[Mare Acidalium quadrangle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://astrobiology.com/2016/05/ancient-tsunami-evidence-on-mars-reveals-life-potential.html|title=Ancient Tsunami Evidence on Mars Reveals Life Potential \u2013 Astrobiology|website=astrobiology.com}}</ref><ref>Rodriguez, J., et al.  2016.

The crater is {{convert|35|km}} wide and about {{convert|2|km}} deep. The height difference between the crater floor and the surface of the water ice is about {{convert|200|m}}. ESA scientists have attributed most of this height difference to sand dunes beneath the water ice, which are partially visible. While scientists do not refer to the patch as a \"lake\", the water ice patch is remarkable for its size and for being present throughout the year. Deposits of water ice and layers of frost have been found in many different locations on the planet.\n\nAs more and more of the surface of Mars has been imaged by the modern generation of orbiters, it has become gradually more apparent that there are probably many more patches of ice scattered across the Martian surface. Many of these putative patches of ice are concentrated in the Martian midlatitudes (\u224830\u201360\u00b0 N/S of the equator). For example, many scientists think that the widespread features in those latitude bands variously described as \"latitude dependent mantle\" or \"pasted-on terrain\" consist of dust- or debris-covered ice patches, which are slowly degrading.<ref name=\"Carr\" /> A cover of debris is required both to explain the dull surfaces seen in the images that do not reflect like ice, and also to allow the patches to exist for an extended period of time without subliming away completely.

Such features are abundant in glaciated regions on Earth, so their absence on Mars has proven puzzling. The lack of these landforms is thought to be related to the cold-based nature of the ice in most recent glaciers on Mars. Because the [[solar insolation]] reaching the planet, the temperature and density of the atmosphere, and the [[Geothermal gradient|geothermal heat flux]] are all lower on Mars than they are on Earth, modelling suggests the temperature of the interface between a glacier and its bed stays below freezing and the ice is literally frozen down to the ground.

Changes in Mars' orbit and tilt cause significant changes in the distribution of water ice from polar regions down to latitudes equivalent to Texas. During certain climate periods water vapor leaves polar ice and enters the atmosphere. The water returns to the ground at lower latitudes as deposits of frost or snow mixed generously with dust. The atmosphere of Mars contains a great deal of fine dust particles.<ref name=\"Head 2008 PNAS\" /> Water vapor condenses on the particles, then they fall down to the ground due to the additional weight of the water coating.

The Compliance Program provides an online free testing facility<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cite.opengeospatial.org/teamengine/|title=TEAM Engine|website=cite.opengeospatial.org}}</ref>, a process<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ogc.org/compliance|title=Compliance Testing &#124; OGC|website=www.ogc.org}}</ref> for certification and branding of compliant products, and coordination of a vibrant community<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/opengeospatial/cite|title=opengeospatial/cite|website=GitHub}}</ref> that develops and supports test scripts. The Compliance Program also runs plugfests, which are short term events for increasing interoperability among vendors' products. \n=== Community and Outreach Program (COP) === \nThe OGC and its members offer resources to help technology developers and users take advantage of the OGC's open standards. Technical documents, training materials, test suites, reference implementations and other interoperability resources developed in OGC Interoperability Initiatives are available on our resources page.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://wwwdev.opengeospatial.org/resources |title=Archived copy |access-date=2019-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005051654/http://wwwdev.opengeospatial.org/resources |archive-date=2017-10-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In addition, the OGC and its members support publications, workshops, seminars and conferences<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ogc.org/event|title=Events List - times on this page are GMT &#124; OGC|website=www.ogc.org}}</ref> to help technology developers, integrators and procurement managers introduce OGC plug and play capabilities into their architectures.\n\n==Membership==\nThe OGC is an open membership organization.

{"title_page": "Jean-Baptiste Dubos", "text_new": "{{no footnotes|date=April 2014}}\n'''Jean-Baptiste Dubos''' ({{IPA-fr|dybo|lang}}; 14 December 1670 \u2013 23 March 1742), also referred to as '''l'[[Abb\u00e9]] Du Bos''', was a French author.\n[[Image:du bos.jpg|right|L'Abb\u00e9 Dubos]]\n\n==Life==\nDubos was born in [[Beauvais]]. After studying theology, he gave it up in favour of public law and politics. He was employed by M. de Torcy, minister of foreign affairs, and by the regent and Cardinal Dubois in several secret missions, in which he acquitted himself with great success. He was rewarded with a pension and other advantages. Having obtained these, he retired from political life and devoted himself to history and literature. He gained such distinction as an author that in 1720 he was elected a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]], of which, in 1723, he was appointed perpetual secretary in succession to [[Andr\u00e9 Dacier]]. He died in Paris, repeating the remark, \"Death is a law, not a punishment.\"\n\n==Works==\n\nDubos' first work was ''L'Histoire des quatre Gordiens prouv\u00e9e et illustr\u00e9e par des m\u00e9dailles'' (Paris, 1695), which, in spite of its ingenuity, did not succeed in convincing most people. At the beginning of the war of 1701 he was charged with different negotiations (both in the [[Netherlands]] and England). In an attempt to persuade those countries to adopt a policy of peace, he published a work entitled ''Les Int\u00e9r\u00e9ts de l'Angleterre mal entendus dans la guerre pr\u00e9sente'' (Amsterdam, 1703). This work contained indiscreet disclosures and predictions that were not fulfilled. The enemy took advantage of the work, and a wag took occasion to remark that the title ought to be read thus: ''Les Int\u00e9r\u00eats de l'Angleterre mal entendus par l'abb\u00e9 Dubos''. It is remarkable as containing a distinct prophecy of the revolt of the American colonies from Great Britain.\n\nDubos' next work was ''L'Histoire de la Ligue de Cambray'' (Paris, 1709, 1728 and 1785, 2 vols.), a full, clear and interesting history, commended by [[Voltaire]]. In 1734 he published his ''Histoire critique de l'\u00e9tablissement de la monarchie fran\u00e7aise dans les Gaules'' (3 vols. 4to)--a work the object of which was to prove that the Franks had entered Gaul, not as conquerors, but at the request of the nation, which, according to him, had called them in to govern it. This system, though unfolded with a degree of skill and ability that, at first, procured many zealous partisans, was attacked by [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] at the end of the thirtieth book of the ''Esprit des lois''.\n\nDubos' principle work, ''R\u00e9flexions critiques sur la po\u00e9sie et sur la peinture'', was published for the first time in 1719 (2 vols, but often reprinted in three volumes). In France it was considered an important text for the study of aesthetics and was a popular textbook until the 19th century.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Griener |first1=Pascal |title=Dubos [Du Bos], Jean-Baptiste, Abb\u00e9 |url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T023814 |website=www.oxfordartonline.com |publisher=Oxford University |accessdate=25 April 2020}}</ref> Like his history of the [[League of Cambray]], it was highly praised by [[Voltaire]]. The work was rendered more remarkable by the fact that its author had no practical acquaintance with any one of the arts whose principles he discussed.

After studying theology, he gave it up in favour of public law and politics. He was employed by M. de Torcy, minister of foreign affairs, and by the regent and Cardinal Dubois in several secret missions, in which he acquitted himself with great success. He was rewarded with a pension and other advantages. Having obtained these, he retired from political life and devoted himself to history and literature. He gained such distinction as an author that in 1720 he was elected a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise]], of which, in 1723, he was appointed perpetual secretary in succession to [[Andr\u00e9 Dacier]]. He died in Paris, repeating the remark, \"Death is a law, not a punishment.\"\n\n==Works==\n\nDubos' first work was ''L'Histoire des quatre Gordiens prouv\u00e9e et illustr\u00e9e par des m\u00e9dailles'' (Paris, 1695), which, in spite of its ingenuity, did not succeed in convincing most people. At the beginning of the war of 1701 he was charged with different negotiations (both in the [[Netherlands]] and England). In an attempt to persuade those countries to adopt a policy of peace, he published a work entitled ''Les Int\u00e9r\u00e9ts de l'Angleterre mal entendus dans la guerre pr\u00e9sente'' (Amsterdam, 1703). This work contained indiscreet disclosures and predictions that were not fulfilled. The enemy took advantage of the work, and a wag took occasion to remark that the title ought to be read thus: ''Les Int\u00e9r\u00eats de l'Angleterre mal entendus par l'abb\u00e9 Dubos''. It is remarkable as containing a distinct prophecy of the revolt of the American colonies from Great Britain.\n\nDubos' next work was ''L'Histoire de la Ligue de Cambray'' (Paris, 1709, 1728 and 1785, 2 vols.), a full, clear and interesting history, commended by [[Voltaire]]. In 1734 he published his ''Histoire critique de l'\u00e9tablissement de la monarchie fran\u00e7aise dans les Gaules'' (3 vols. 4to)--a work the object of which was to prove that the Franks had entered Gaul, not as conquerors, but at the request of the nation, which, according to him, had called them in to govern it. This system, though unfolded with a degree of skill and ability that, at first, procured many zealous partisans, was attacked by [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] at the end of the thirtieth book of the ''Esprit des lois''.\n\nDubos' ''R\u00e9flexions critiques sur la po\u00e9sie et sur la peinture'', published for the first time in 1719 (2 vols, but often reprinted in three volumes), constitute one of the works in which the theory of the arts is explained with the utmost sagacity and discrimination. Like his history of the [[League of Cambray]], it was highly praised by [[Voltaire]]. The work was rendered more remarkable by the fact that its author had no practical acquaintance with any one of the arts whose principles he discussed. Besides the works above enumerated, a manifesto of [[Maximilian II Emanuel, elector of Bavaria]], against the [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Leopold]] (relative to the succession in Spain) has been attributed to Dubos from the excellence of the style.\n\n==Excerpts==\n\n<blockquote>\"[O]ne of the greatest wants of man is to have his mind incessantly occupied.

It stars [[Diganth]] and [[Aindrita Ray]] in the lead roles. The film soundtrack and score was composed by [[Mano Murthy]] with lyrics by [[Yogaraj Bhat]] and veteran lyricist [[Jayant Kaikini]].\n\n==Plot==\nManohara \"Manu\" ([[Diganth]]) is an orphaned, unemployed young man, who is often looked down on upon by his family. However, his uncle ([[Achyuth Kumar]]) is the only exception. His friend Satish ([[Satish Neenasam]]) is a neighbour and cable operator, whose love for one of their neighhour - Bhamini, is unrequited. Bhamini marries a software engineer, and at the wedding reception, tells Manu that she loves him, but couldn't live with him (given his status). She also asks him to do something with his life, and not throw it away by spending his time criticizing the people around him. Meanwhile, Satish takes note of the \"gulf\" between Bhamini's new husband and himself, and decides to prove himself that he is indeed more worthy than she thinks of him. To that end, Manohar and Satish get together and invent a \"electricity producing machine\" which harnesses its power from vehicles that drive on roads (the fact that this isn't free energy, and that it would cost motorists who drive over it some extra fuel is not mentioned in the movie). His demonstration goes off well, but a police car chasing a criminal on a motorbike suddenly drives onto the machine, which causes the car to flip over, and in fact nearly kills the constables inside.\n\nManu and Satish are arrested and reprimanded for their foolishness, but they are soon released. Manu's aunt decides to marry him into a wealthy family, to get rid of him and an attempt to temper his behaviour. While they are visiting the intended's family, a baby next to Manu begins urinating. Manu takes a nearby tea-cup to catch the urine and prevent getting wet. Everyone sees this and his prior behavior as confirmation that he is mentally unstable. Manohar and Satish, both drunk, stop at an isolated hill top and tell one another their opinions about life; they get into a row. Satish drives off leaving behind Manohar.\n\nManohar walks back home and sees a van coming from a distance. The van is transporting about a dozen patients bound for an asylum. The inmates cause a commotion in the van, the guards loose order of the inmates' paperwork and photographs but the inmates are subdued by the guards. The van stops so that the guards can relieve themselves, and the patient Mahendra escapes. Manu was near the van when the guards went after the escapee. The guards notice him and take him as the escapee. Manohar is forcibly taken to the Kaamanabillu asylum.\n\nAt the asylum, Manohar demonstratively attempts to explain the mix-up but he is not believed. Soon, his family find out and go to remove him from the  asylum. An altercation between Manohar and another inmate cause the family to rethink their decision to take him away because they believe he insane. So, they decide to leave him there. Manu's life is thrown out of gear, as he realizes that he has no choice but to live the life of a lunatic, although he is not. He settles down and starts bonding with the patients: Dollar (played by [[Pawan Kumar (director)|Pawan Kumar]] (of [[Lucia (2013 film)]] fame), who is a brilliant engineer, but considered a lunatic when one of his inventions, - a baby ass washing machine - injures a baby. He also bonds with Raju Thalikote, who is a self declared veteran of the asylum. Manu soon discloses his story to Shankrappa, who advises him to talk to Dollar, who in turn has always had an uncanny knack to escape from the asylum.\n\nSoon, Manu manages to slip out, but during his escape, which takes him through the female wing of the asylum, he catches a glimpse of Devika (played by [[Aindrita Ray]]) and is smitten by her. Although he escapes, he changes his mind and returns to the asylum to pursue a relationship with her. As they are not allowed to mingle by the asylum staff, the inmates (under Shankrappa's leadership) hatch and execute a plan to allow Manu to meet Devika. Shankrappa is well aware of the doctors' tendency to perform the exact opposite to what he request them to do - since they perceive him to be insane - and he uses this to get them all sent for electro-shock therapy (since the EST room is within the women's wing). Dollar has manufactured a non-conducting gel which they then switch with the EST gel, so that they're not really affected by the shock. They fake syncope, and when the staff leave for a prayer assembly, they sneak out to meet Devika. It turns out that Devika is sleeping (having been given an illegal pill, by a doctor who, unbeknownst to everyone engages in (implied) sexual abuse of female inmates, using the pill). Nonetheless, Manu - with Shankrappa's assistance, carries Devika to an ambulance, and drives it out of the asylum.\n\nDevika is a dental student who is in the asylum as she has cultivated intense misandry, after a lecturer misbehaved with her. This manifests itself as aggressive behaviour from time to time, where she stabs any man she deems dangerous. When she awakens the morning after being spirited away by Manu, she attacks him. However, Manu manages to subdue her and professes his love to her. Devika and Manu decide to return to the asylum. On the way, at Devika's insistence, they take a temporary detour to her childhood home, where Devika has a flashback - of her uncaring father (who drove her mother to suicide). They then proceed to the asylum, but stop for the night. Manu spouts a monologue of his love for her, once she sleeps - and this is recorded by a CCTV camera that was activated accidentally by Devika, when they had hit a bump in the road earlier. The next morning, she discovers this, but while waking up Manu, unintentionally scares and nearly kills him when he falls down a railway overbridge. Manu is angry, and is about to leave her to her own devices, when she laughs at his rant, and he is smitten again. As they continue on foot (the van having run out of fuel), even as Manu pleads with her to go back (and not to the hospital). She doesn't respond right up until they go to the hospital, and convinces Manu to re-enter it.\n\nAs their relationship reaches serious levels, Devika asks Manu point blank whether he is capable of cheating her, to which the latter replies in the negative. However, once the escaped inmate (Mahendra) is caught, and brought to the asylum by the police (Mahendra is a murderer), the staff realise their mix-up. However, in front of everyone, they accuse Manu of being complicit in the charade, so that he could enjoy a free ride at the hospital. Devika construes this as Manu's betrayal, and of the disingenuousness of his love, and spurns him. A shattered Manu is thrown out of the asylum, bidding a tearful farewell to his fellow inmates with whom he had developed a bond. As he leaves, he encounters Dollar (who had managed to finally escape) returning to the asylum, claiming that there was nothing in the world worth living for outside the asylum.\n\nWhen he arrives at his uncle's place however, he is once again exposed to the ridicule of people.\n\nThe movie ends with Devika encountering him near his house. It is shown that she is cured of her dementia when she remembered Manu, who helped her to let go of her painful past, and move on; when she fought back the abusive doctor, and having watched the tape again, Devika is convinced that his love for her was real. The doctors have also concluded that Manu was responsible for \"curing\" Devika, and she says that is why she has returned to him; but Manu says that he himself is deemed to be uncured, and insane - being laughed at by society. Devika asks him, rather nonchalantly, as to how could that be his problem, and Manu comes around - with both of them pitying society, and walking away. The final scene closes with a voice-over, of a line that Shankrappa had delivered to Manu when the latter first arrived at the asylum - \"Those in this world that come to an asylum, are those who can be cured. The ones who cannot be cured at all, remain outside. There's a chance that you'll be cured of madness, which is something that others outside don't have. Wheover comes here is only temporarily mad, but the ones on the outside are permanently so.\"\n\nThe movie has shades of \"One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest\", the conundrum illustrated in \"Catch-22\" and also shows the 'institutionalisation' depicted in \"The Shawshank Redemption\". The main thrust of the movie is to show the hypocrisy of a society which classifies behaviours, and, by extension, people into 'normal' and 'abnormal'.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Diganth]] as Mahendra / Manohara\n* [[Aindrita Ray]] as Devika\n* [[Achyuth Kumar]]\n* Raju Talikote as Shankarappa \n* Balaji Manohar as psychiatrist \n* [[Pawan Kumar (director)|Pawan Kumar]]\n* [[Neethu]]\n* Manjunath Hegde \n* Apoorva \n* Satish Ninasam as Cable operator Satish\n* Ravi Santhehaklu \n* Vanishree \n* Ashok Rao \n* Mohan Kumar \n* Master Rakesh \n* Raghavendra B.

Currently he has also written the story and the screenplay of Bhat's new movie ''Pancharangi''. Pawan also played the character Dollar in the movie ''Manasaare''.\n\nThe costumes worn by the lead pair was prominently noticed, especially in the song \"Ello Maleyaagideyandu\". The experimental designs in the song \"ondu kanasu\" was especially praised. One of the high points of the movie was also the costumes worn by the staff and inmates of the rehabilitation centre, which gave a counterpoint to the dull and gloomy environment of the asylum. The costumes and styling was done by Bangalore-based designer Shachina, who had earlier worked in Suri's ''Junglee''. She is generally considered to be the main contributing factor towards Aindrita's glamour quotient.\n\n==Box office==\nThe movie was the one of biggest hit of the year 2009.<ref>[http://movies.rediff.com/slide-show/2009/oct/20/slide-show-1-south-intreview-with-yogesh-bhat.htm]</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n;[[Filmfare Awards South|Filmfare Awards]]\n*Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist - Kannada - [[Jayant Kaikini]] - \"Yello Maleyaagide\"\n\n;South Scope Awards<ref>[[Manasaare#Awards]]</ref>\n*Best Film\n*Best Director\n*Best Actress\n*Best Lyricist\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe music of the film was composed by [[Mano Murthy]] with lyrics penned by [[Jayant Kaikini]], [[Yogaraj Bhat]] and Sloka.\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCF\" align=\"center\"\n| '''Track #''' || '''Song''' || '''Singer(s)''' || '''Duration'''\n|-\n|1 || Ondu Kanasu || [[Kunal Ganjawala]], Ananya Bhagat, Earl Edgar (Rap)||  3.07\n|-\n|2 || Ello Maleyaagideyandu || [[Sonu Nigam]] ||  4.09\n|-\n|3 || Kanna Haniyondige || [[Krishnakumar Kunnath|KK]], [[Shreya Ghoshal]] || 5.09\n|-\n|4 || Onde Ninna || Sonu Nigam || 3.43\n|-\n|5 || Naa Naguva Modalene || Shreya Ghoshal || 4.31\n|-\n|6 || Naanu Manasaare || Vikas Vasishtha, Lakshmi Nagaraj || 2.40\n|-\n|7 || Sahanabhavatu ||  [[Vijay Prakash]] || 2.54\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=2243399}}\n*http://movies.rediff.com/report/2009/sep/25/south-kannada-movie-review-manasaare.htm\n*http://kannadaaudio.com/Songs/Moviewise/home/Manasaare.php\n\n{{Yogaraj Bhat}}\n\n[[Category:2000s Kannada-language films]]\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:Indian films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Mano Murthy]]\n[[Category:Rockline Entertainments]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Yogaraj Bhat]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2015}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=November 2015}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = Manasaare\n| image          = Manasaare.jpg\n| alt            = <!-- see WP:ALT -->\n| caption        = \n| director       = [[Yograj Bhat]]\n| producer       = [[Rockline Venkatesh]]\n| story          = Yogaraj Bhat\n| screenplay     = B.

The main thrust of the movie is to show the hypocrisy of a society which classifies behaviours, and, by extension, people into 'normal' and 'abnormal'.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Diganth]] as Mahendra / Manohara\n* [[Aindrita Ray]] as Devika\n* [[Achyuth Kumar]]\n* Raju Talikote as shankarappa \n* Balaji Manohar as psychiatrist \n*[[Pawan Kumar (director)|Pawan Kumar]]\n* [[Neethu]]\n* Manjunath hegde \n* Apoorva \n* Satish Ninasam as Cable \noperator Satish\n* Ravi santhehaklu \n* vanishree \n* Ashok rao \n* Mohan Kumar \n* Master Rakesh \n* Raghavendra.B.kolar \n* Triveni rao\n* Mithra \n* Arasu maharaj \n* vijay kumar\n* Veerendra \n* Sai Mahesh\n\n==Critical reception==\nCritics gave favourable reviews to the movie.<ref>[http://movies.rediff.com/report/2009/sep/25/south-kannada-movie-review-manasaare.htm]</ref>\n\n==Highpoints==\nThe screenplay of the movie is written by Pawan Kumar, who also wrote the screenplay for ''Lagori''. Currently he has also written the story and the screenplay of Bhat's new movie ''Pancharangi''. Pawan also played the character Dollar in the movie ''Manasaare''.\n\nThe costumes worn by the lead pair was prominently noticed, especially in the song \"Ello Maleyaagideyandu\". The experimental designs in the song \"ondu kanasu\" was especially praised. One of the high points of the movie was also the costumes worn by the staff and inmates of the rehabilitation centre, which gave a counterpoint to the dull and gloomy environment of the asylum. The costumes and styling was done by Bangalore-based designer Shachina, who had earlier worked in Suri's ''Junglee''. She is generally considered to be the main contributing factor towards Aindrita's glamour quotient.\n\n==Box office==\nThe movie was the one of biggest hit of the year 2009.<ref>[http://movies.rediff.com/slide-show/2009/oct/20/slide-show-1-south-intreview-with-yogesh-bhat.htm]</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n;[[Filmfare Awards South|Filmfare Awards]]\n*Filmfare Award for Best Lyricist - Kannada - [[Jayant Kaikini]] - \"Yello Maleyaagide\"\n\n;South Scope Awards<ref>[[Manasaare#Awards]]</ref>\n*Best Film\n*Best Director\n*Best Actress\n*Best Lyricist\n\n==Soundtrack==\nThe music of the film was composed by [[Mano Murthy]] with lyrics penned by [[Jayant Kaikini]], [[Yogaraj Bhat]] and Sloka.\n\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCF\" align=\"center\"\n| '''Track #''' || '''Song''' || '''Singer(s)''' || '''Duration'''\n|-\n|1 || Ondu Kanasu || [[Kunal Ganjawala]], Ananya Bhagat, Earl Edgar (Rap)||  3.07\n|-\n|2 || Ello Maleyaagideyandu || [[Sonu Nigam]] ||  4.09\n|-\n|3 || Kanna Haniyondige || [[Krishnakumar Kunnath|KK]], [[Shreya Ghoshal]] || 5.09\n|-\n|4 || Onde Ninna || Sonu Nigam || 3.43\n|-\n|5 || Naa Naguva Modalene || Shreya Ghoshal || 4.31\n|-\n|6 || Naanu Manasaare || Vikas Vasishtha, Lakshmi Nagaraj || 2.40\n|-\n|7 || Sahanabhavatu ||  [[Vijay Prakash]] || 2.54\n|}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{IMDb title|id=2243399}}\n*http://movies.rediff.com/report/2009/sep/25/south-kannada-movie-review-manasaare.htm\n*http://kannadaaudio.com/Songs/Moviewise/home/Manasaare.php\n\n{{Yogaraj Bhat}}\n\n[[Category:2000s Kannada-language films]]\n[[Category:2009 films]]\n[[Category:Indian films]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Mano Murthy]]\n[[Category:Rockline Entertainments]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Yogaraj Bhat]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manasaare"}

Commonly known by its colloquial [[Acronym|initials]] PSD, on [[ballot paper]]s its initials appear as its official form PPD/PSD, with the first three letters coming from the party's original name, the '''Democratic Peoples' Party''' ({{lang-pt|Partido Popular Democr\u00e1tico}}, PPD). Alongside the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] (PS), the PSD is one of the two [[major party|major parties]] in Portuguese politics.\n\nThe party was founded in 1974, two weeks after the [[Carnation Revolution]] and in 1976 changed to its current name. In 1979, it allied with centre-right parties to form the [[Democratic Alliance (Portugal)|Democratic Alliance]] and won [[1979 Portuguese legislative election|that year's election]]. After the [[1983 Portuguese legislative election|1983 election]], the party formed a [[grand coalition]] with the Socialist Party, known as the [[Central Block|Central Bloc]], before winning the election under new leader [[An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva]] [[1985 Portuguese legislative election|in 1985]] and shift the party to the right. Cavaco Silva served as [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]] for ten years, instituting major [[economic liberalisation]] and winning two [[Landslide victory|landslide victories]]. After he stepped down, the PSD lost the [[1995 Portuguese legislative election|1995 election]]. The party was returned to power under [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso]] in [[2002 Portuguese legislative election|2002]], but was defeated in the [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|2005 election]]. The party was able to return to power after the [[2011 Portuguese legislative election|2011 elections]] and, four years later, was able to win a plurality in the [[2015 Portuguese legislative election|2015 legislative election]], winning 107 seats in the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]] in alliance with the [[CDS \u2013 People's Party|People's Party]] (CDS-PP), but being unable to form a [[minority government]].

On 15 May, the party's first headquarters were inaugurated in [[Largo do Rato]], Lisbon. This was followed, on 24 June, by the formation of the first Political Committee, consisting of [[Francisco S\u00e1 Carneiro]], [[Francisco Pinto Balsem\u00e3o]], [[Joaquim Magalh\u00e3es Mota]], [[Barbosa de Melo]], [[Mota Pinto]], [[Montalv\u00e3o Machado]], [[Miguel Veiga]], [[Ferreira J\u00fanior]], [[Ant\u00f3nio Carlos Lima]], [[Ant\u00f3nio Salazar Silva]], [[Jorge Correia da Cunha]], [[Jorge Figueiredo Dias]] and [[Jorge S\u00e1 Borges]].\n\nThe ''Povo Livre'' publication was founded, its first issue being published on 13 July 1974, led by its first two directors, [[Manuel Alegria]] and [[Rui Machete]]. The PPD's first major meeting was held in the \"Pavilh\u00e3o dos Desportos\", Lisbon, on 25 October, and a month later the party's first official congress took place.\n\nOn 17 January 1975, 6300 signatures were sent to the Supreme Court so that the party could be approved as a legitimate political entity, which happened a mere eight days later.\n\nIn 1975, the PPD applied unsuccessfully to join the [[Socialist International]],<ref name=\"Gunther1991\">{{cite book|last=Gunther|first=Richard|chapter=Spain and Portugal|editor1=Gerald Allen Dorfman|editor2=Peter J.

This is seen as a transitional period in Portuguese politics, in which political institutions were built and took time to stabilize. In 1979, the PSD formed an electoral alliance, known as the [[Democratic Alliance (Portugal)|Democratic Alliance]] (AD), with the Democratic and Social Centre (now called the [[CDS \u2013 People's Party|People's Party]], CDS-PP) and a couple of smaller right-wing parties. The AD won the parliamentary elections towards the end of 1979, and the PSD leader, [[Francisco S\u00e1 Carneiro]], became Prime Minister. The PSD would be part of all governments until 1995. The AD increased its parliamentary majority in new elections called for 1980, but was devastated by the death of S\u00e1 Caneiro in an air crash on 4 December 1980. [[Francisco Pinto Balsem\u00e3o]] took over the leadership of both the Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Alliance, as well as the Prime Ministership, but lacking S\u00e1 Carneiro's charisma, he was unable to rally popular support.\n\nThe Democratic Alliance was dissolved in 1983, and in parliamentary elections that year, the PSD lost to the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] (PS). Falling short of a majority, however, the Socialists formed a [[grand coalition]], known as the [[Central Block|Central Bloc]], with the PSD. Many right-wingers in the PSD, including [[An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva]], opposed participation in the PS-led government, and so, when Cavaco Silva was elected leader of the party on 2 June 1985, the coalition was doomed.\n\n=== Cavaco Silva governments (1985\u20131995) ===\nThe PSD won a plurality (but not a majority) in the [[1985 Portuguese legislative election|general election of 1985]], and Cavaco Silva became Prime Minister. [[Economic liberalization]] and tax cuts ushered in several years of economic growth. After a motion of no confidence was approved, early elections were called for [[1987 Portuguese legislative election|July 1987]] which resulted in a landslide victory for the PSD, who captured 50.2% percent of the popular vote and 148 of the 250 parliamentary seats \u2013 the first time that any political party in Portugal had mustered an absolute majority in a free election. A strong economy, growing above 7% in 1988, ushered a big convergence between Portugal and other EU countries. The PSD won a historic 3rd term in the [[1991 Portuguese legislative election|1991 election]], almost as easily as in 1987, but continuing high levels of unemployment and a lower economy, after 1993, eroded the popularity of the Cavaco Silva government.\n\n===Post-Cavaco Silva===\nCavaco Silva stepped down as leader in January 1995. In the following month, in the PSD congress, the party elected [[Fernando Nogueira]] as leader. The PSD lost the [[1995 Portuguese legislative election|1995 election]] to the PS. In 1996, Cavaco Silva ran for the presidency of the republic, but he failed to defeat former Lisbon Mayor [[Jorge Sampaio]]. Sampaio won 53.9% to Cavaco's 46.1%. The party, for the first time in 16 years, was out of government. The party was again defeated in the [[1999 Portuguese legislative election|1999]] elections.\n\n===First PSD/CDS coalition government===\nThe PSD made a comeback in [[2002 Portuguese legislative election|2002]], however: despite falling short of a majority, the PSD won enough seats to form a coalition with the CDS-PP, and the PSD leader, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso]], became Prime Minister. Dur\u00e3o Barroso later resigned his post to become President of the [[European Commission]], leaving the way for [[Pedro Santana Lopes]], a man with whom he was frequently at odds, to become leader of the party and Prime Minister.\n\n=== Back in opposition (2005\u20132011) ===\nIn the [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|parliamentary election]] held on 20 February 2005, Santana Lopes led the PSD to its worst defeat since 1983. With a negative swing of more than 12% percent, the party won only 75 seats, a loss of 30. The rival Socialist Party had won an [[absolute majority]], and remained in government after the [[2009 Portuguese legislative election|2009 parliamentary election]], albeit without an absolute majority, leaving the PSD in opposition.\n\nThe PSD-supported candidate [[An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva]] won the Portuguese presidential elections in 2006 and again in 2011. After the 2005 elections, [[Lu\u00eds Marques Mendes]] was elected leader of the party. Internal infighting weakened Marques Mendes and, in September 2007, Marques Mendes was defeated by [[Lu\u00eds Filipe Menezes]] by a 54% to 42% margin. Menezes was also incapable with dealing with his internal opposition and, after just six months in the job, Menezes resigned. On 31 May 2008, [[Manuela Ferreira Leite]] became the first female leader of a Portuguese major party. She won 38% of the votes, against the 31% of [[Pedro Passos Coelho]] and the 30% of [[Pedro Santana Lopes]].\n\nIn the [[2009 European Parliament election in Portugal|European Parliament election]] held on 7 June 2009, the PSD defeated the governing socialists, capturing 31.7% of the popular vote and electing eight MEPs, while the Socialist Party only won 26.5% of the popular vote and elected seven MEPs.\n\nAlthough this was expected to be a \"redrawing of the electoral map\", the PSD was still defeated [[2009 Portuguese legislative election|later that year]], though the PS lost its majority. [[Pedro Passos Coelho]] was elected leader in March 2010, with 61% of the votes.\n\n===Second PSD/CDS coalition government===\nGrowing popular disenchantment with the government's handling of the economic crisis coupled with the government's inability to secure the support of other parties to implement the necessary reforms to address the crisis, forced the Socialist Party Prime Minister [[Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates]] to resign, leading to a [[2011 Portuguese legislative election|fresh election]] on 5 June 2011. This resulted in a non-absolute majority for the PSD, leading to a coalition government with the CDS-PP, which served a full term until the [[2015 Portuguese legislative election|2015 general election]]. During this term, many austerity policies were put into practice to reduce the budget deficit but, ultimately, created unemployment and a recession that lasted until mid 2013. Since that date, the economy recovered starting to grow between 1 and 2% per trimester.\n\nIn the [[2015 Portuguese legislative election|2015 general election]], the PSD and CDS-PP ran in a joint coalition, called [[Portugal Ahead]], led by [[Pedro Passos Coelho]] and [[Paulo Portas]]. The coalition won the elections by a wide margin over the Socialists, capturing 38.6% of the votes while the Socialists captured only 32%, although the coalition lost 25 MPs and a more than 11% of the votes, thus falling well short of an absolute majority. The [[Portugal Ahead|PSD/CDS-PP]] coalition was asked by the then President of the Republic, [[An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva]], to form a government with Passos Coelho as Prime Minister.\n\n=== Back in opposition (2015\u2013present) ===\nThe 2nd PSD/CDS government was duly formed and took the oath of office on 30 October 2015, but fell after a no-confidence motion was approved two weeks later. Its 11 days of rule make it the shortest-lived government since Portugal has been a democracy holding free elections. After that, the PSD returned to the opposition benches, and the Socialist Party was able to form an agreement with [[Left Bloc|BE]] and [[Unitary Democratic Coalition|CDU]] to support a PS minority government led by [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]]. Pedro Passos Coelho continued as party leader, but a weak opposition strategy led to bad polling numbers for the PSD. All of this culminated with the results of the [[2017 Portuguese local elections|2017 local elections]]. In these elections, the PSD achieved their worst results ever, winning just 98 mayors and 30% of the votes. Passos Coelho announced he would not run for another term as PSD leader. On 13 January 2018, [[Rui Rio]] defeated [[Pedro Santana Lopes]] by a 54% to 46% margin and became the new party leader.\n\nDuring his first year in the leadership, Rio faced big internal opposition and, in January 2019, Rio won a motion of confidence presented by [[Lu\u00eds Montenegro]]. In the [[2019 European Parliament election in Portugal|EP 2019 elections]], the PSD achieved their worst result ever in a national election, winning just 22% of the votes. However, the party recovered a lot of ground in the [[2019 Portuguese legislative election|October 2019 general elections]], achieving 28% of the votes, against the 36% of the PS.

Commonly known by its colloquial [[Acronym|initials]] PSD, on [[ballot paper]]s its initials appear as its official form PPD/PSD, with the first three letters coming from the party's original name, the '''Democratic Peoples' Party''' ({{lang-pt|Partido Popular Democr\u00e1tico}}, PPD). Alongside the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] (PS), the PSD is one of the two [[major party|major parties]] in Portuguese politics.\n\nThe party was founded in 1974, two weeks after the [[Carnation Revolution]] and in 1976 changed to its current name. In 1979, it allied with centre-right parties to form the [[Democratic Alliance (Portugal)|Democratic Alliance]] and won [[1979 Portuguese legislative election|that year's election]]. After the [[1983 Portuguese legislative election|1983 election]], the party formed a [[grand coalition]] with the Socialist Party, known as the [[Central Block|Central Bloc]], before winning the election under new leader [[An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva]] [[1985 Portuguese legislative election|in 1985]] and shift the party to the right. Cavaco Silva served as [[Prime Minister of Portugal|Prime Minister]] for ten years, instituting major [[economic liberalisation]] and winning two [[Landslide victory|landslide victories]]. After he stepped down, the PSD lost the [[1995 Portuguese legislative election|1995 election]]. The party was returned to power under [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso]] in [[2002 Portuguese legislative election|2002]], but was defeated in the [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|2005 election]]. The party was able to return to power after the [[2011 Portuguese legislative election|2011 elections]] and, four years later, was able to win a plurality in the [[2015 Portuguese legislative election|2015 legislative election]], winning 107 seats in the [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Assembly of the Republic]] in alliance with the [[CDS \u2013 People's Party|People's Party]] (CDS-PP), but being unable to form a [[minority government]]. The current leader, [[Rui Rio]], a centrist, was elected on 13 January 2018.\n\nOriginally a [[social-democratic]] party, the PSD became the main [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]], [[conservatism|conservative]] party in Portugal.<ref name=\"Almeida2012\">{{cite book|first=Dimitri|last=Almeida|title=The Impact of European Integration on Political Parties: Beyond the Permissive Consensus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oD7bKbo0FYEC&pg=PA99|year=2012|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-1-136-34039-0|page=99}}</ref> The PSD is a member of the [[European People's Party]] (EPP) and the [[Centrist Democrat International]].

On 15 May, the party's first headquarters were inaugurated in [[Largo do Rato]], Lisbon. This was followed, on 24 June, by the formation of the first Political Committee, consisting of [[Francisco S\u00e1 Carneiro]], [[Francisco Pinto Balsem\u00e3o]], [[Joaquim Magalh\u00e3es Mota]], [[Barbosa de Melo]], [[Mota Pinto]], [[Montalv\u00e3o Machado]], [[Miguel Veiga]], [[Ferreira J\u00fanior]], [[Ant\u00f3nio Carlos Lima]], [[Ant\u00f3nio Salazar Silva]], [[Jorge Correia da Cunha]], [[Jorge Figueiredo Dias]] and [[Jorge S\u00e1 Borges]].\n\nThe ''Povo Livre'' publication was founded, its first issue being published on 13 July 1974, led by its first two directors, [[Manuel Alegria]] and [[Rui Machete]]. The PPD's first major meeting was held in the \"Pavilh\u00e3o dos Desportos\", Lisbon, on 25 October, and a month later the party's first official congress took place.\n\nOn 17 January 1975, 6300 signatures were sent to the Supreme Court so that the party could be approved as a legitimate political entity, which happened a mere eight days later.\n\nIn 1975, the PPD applied unsuccessfully to join the [[Socialist International]],<ref name=\"Gunther1991\">{{cite book|last=Gunther|first=Richard|chapter=Spain and Portugal|editor1=Gerald Allen Dorfman|editor2=Peter J.

This is seen as a transitional period in Portuguese politics, in which political institutions were built and took time to stabilize. In 1979, the PSD formed an electoral alliance, known as the [[Democratic Alliance (Portugal)|Democratic Alliance]] (AD), with the Democratic and Social Centre (now called the [[CDS \u2013 People's Party|People's Party]], CDS-PP) and a couple of smaller right-wing parties. The AD won the parliamentary elections towards the end of 1979, and the PSD leader, [[Francisco S\u00e1 Carneiro]], became Prime Minister. The PSD would be part of all governments until 1995. The AD increased its parliamentary majority in new elections called for 1980, but was devastated by the death of S\u00e1 Caneiro in an air crash on 4 December 1980. [[Francisco Pinto Balsem\u00e3o]] took over the leadership of both the Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Alliance, as well as the Prime Ministership, but lacking S\u00e1 Carneiro's charisma, he was unable to rally popular support.\n\nThe Democratic Alliance was dissolved in 1983, and in parliamentary elections that year, the PSD lost to the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]] (PS). Falling short of a majority, however, the Socialists formed a [[grand coalition]], known as the [[Central Block|Central Bloc]], with the PSD. Many right-wingers in the PSD, including [[An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva]], opposed participation in the PS-led government, and so, when Cavaco Silva was elected leader of the party on 2 June 1985, the coalition was doomed.\n\n=== Cavaco Silva governments (1985\u20131995) ===\nThe PSD won a plurality (but not a majority) in the [[1985 Portuguese legislative election|general election of 1985]], and Cavaco Silva became Prime Minister. [[Economic liberalization]] and tax cuts ushered in several years of economic growth. After a motion of no confidence was approved, early elections were called for [[1987 Portuguese legislative election|July 1987]] which resulted in a landslide victory for the PSD, who captured 50.2% percent of the popular vote and 148 of the 250 parliamentary seats \u2013 the first time that any political party in Portugal had mustered an absolute majority in a free election. A strong economy, growing above 7% in 1988, ushered a big convergence between Portugal and other EU countries. The PSD won a historic 3rd term in the [[1991 Portuguese legislative election|1991 election]], almost as easily as in 1987, but continuing high levels of unemployment and a lower economy, after 1993, eroded the popularity of the Cavaco Silva government.\n\n===Post-Cavaco Silva===\nCavaco Silva stepped down as leader in January 1995. In the following month, in the PSD congress, the party elected [[Fernando Nogueira]] as leader. The PSD lost the [[1995 Portuguese legislative election|1995 election]] to the PS. In 1996, Cavaco Silva ran for the presidency of the republic, but he failed to defeat former Lisbon Mayor [[Jorge Sampaio]]. Sampaio won 53.9% to Cavaco's 46.1%. The party, for the first time in 16 years, was out of government. The party was again defeated in the [[1999 Portuguese legislative election|1999]] elections.\n\n===First PSD/CDS coalition government===\nThe PSD made a comeback in [[2002 Portuguese legislative election|2002]], however: despite falling short of a majority, the PSD won enough seats to form a coalition with the CDS-PP, and the PSD leader, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Dur\u00e3o Barroso]], became Prime Minister. Dur\u00e3o Barroso later resigned his post to become President of the [[European Commission]], leaving the way for [[Pedro Santana Lopes]], a man with whom he was frequently at odds, to become leader of the party and Prime Minister.\n\n=== Back in opposition (2005\u20132011) ===\nIn the [[2005 Portuguese legislative election|parliamentary election]] held on 20 February 2005, Santana Lopes led the PSD to its worst defeat since 1983. With a negative swing of more than 12% percent, the party won only 75 seats, a loss of 30. The rival Socialist Party had won an [[absolute majority]], and remained in government after the [[2009 Portuguese legislative election|2009 parliamentary election]], albeit without an absolute majority, leaving the PSD in opposition.\n\nThe PSD-supported candidate [[An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva]] won the Portuguese presidential elections in 2006 and again in 2011. After the 2005 elections, [[Lu\u00eds Marques Mendes]] was elected leader of the party. Internal infighting weakened Marques Mendes and, in September 2007, Marques Mendes was defeated by [[Lu\u00eds Filipe Menezes]] by a 54% to 42% margin. Menezes was also incapable with dealing with his internal opposition and, after just six months in the job, Menezes resigned. On 31 May 2008, [[Manuela Ferreira Leite]] became the first female leader of a Portuguese major party. She won 38% of the votes, against the 31% of [[Pedro Passos Coelho]] and the 30% of [[Pedro Santana Lopes]].\n\nIn the [[2009 European Parliament election in Portugal|European Parliament election]] held on 7 June 2009, the PSD defeated the governing socialists, capturing 31.7% of the popular vote and electing eight MEPs, while the Socialist Party only won 26.5% of the popular vote and elected seven MEPs.\n\nAlthough this was expected to be a \"redrawing of the electoral map\", the PSD was still defeated [[2009 Portuguese legislative election|later that year]], though the PS lost its majority. [[Pedro Passos Coelho]] was elected leader in March 2010, with 61% of the votes.\n\n===Second PSD/CDS coalition government===\nGrowing popular disenchantment with the government's handling of the economic crisis coupled with the government's inability to secure the support of other parties to implement the necessary reforms to address the crisis, forced the Socialist Party Prime Minister [[Jos\u00e9 S\u00f3crates]] to resign, leading to a [[2011 Portuguese legislative election|fresh election]] on 5 June 2011. This resulted in a non-absolute majority for the PSD, leading to a coalition government with the CDS-PP, which served a full term until the [[2015 Portuguese legislative election|2015 general election]]. During this term, many austerity policies were put into practice to reduce the budget deficit but, ultimately, created unemployment and a recession that lasted until mid 2013. Since that date, the economy recovered starting to grow between 1 and 2% per trimester.\n\nIn the [[2015 Portuguese legislative election|2015 general election]], the PSD and CDS-PP ran in a joint coalition, called [[Portugal Ahead]], led by [[Pedro Passos Coelho]] and [[Paulo Portas]]. The coalition won the elections by a wide margin over the Socialists, capturing 38.6% of the votes while the Socialists captured only 32%, although the coalition lost 25 MPs and a more than 11% of the votes, thus falling well short of an absolute majority. The [[Portugal Ahead|PSD/CDS-PP]] coalition was asked by the then President of the Republic, [[An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva]], to form a government with Passos Coelho as Prime Minister.\n\n=== Back in opposition (2015\u2013present) ===\nThe 2nd PSD/CDS government was duly formed and took the oath of office on 30 October 2015, but fell after a no-confidence motion was approved two weeks later. Its 11 days of rule make it the shortest-lived government since Portugal has been a democracy holding free elections. After that, the PSD returned to the opposition benches, and the Socialist Party was able to form an agreement with [[Left Bloc|BE]] and [[Unitary Democratic Coalition|CDU]] to support a PS minority government led by [[Ant\u00f3nio Costa]]. Pedro Passos Coelho continued as party leader, but a weak opposition strategy led to bad polling numbers for the PSD. All of this culminated with the results of the [[2017 Portuguese local elections|2017 local elections]]. In these elections, the PSD achieved their worst results ever, winning just 98 mayors and 30% of the votes. Passos Coelho announced he would not run for another term as PSD leader. On 13 January 2018, [[Rui Rio]] defeated [[Pedro Santana Lopes]] by a 54% to 46% margin and became the new party leader.\n\nDuring his first year in the leadership, Rio faced big internal opposition and, in January 2019, Rio won a motion of confidence presented by [[Lu\u00eds Montenegro]]. In the [[2019 European Parliament election in Portugal|EP 2019 elections]], the PSD achieved their worst result ever in a national election, winning just 22% of the votes. However, the party recovered a lot of ground in the [[2019 Portuguese legislative election|October 2019 general elections]], achieving 28% of the votes, against the 36% of the PS.

The third game, ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]'', was released on August 29, 2015 for [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Wii U]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2015/05/05/june-cover-revealed-disney-infinity-3-0.aspx?|title=June Cover Revealed \u2013 Disney Infinity 3.0|first=Jefspalast=Cork|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=May 5, 2015|accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref> The series was discontinued on May 10, 2016, due to Avalanche Software's closure, despite some sources stating that there were some major plans in place to keep the series alive, and the presence of numerous new characters and playsets previously planned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iheartinfinity.com/disney-infinitys-ambitious-plans-future-cancelled/|title=Disney Infinity's Ambitious Plans For The Future (before it was cancelled...) -|date=May 13, hjgi|website=Iheartinfinity.com|accessdate=December 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n''[[Disney Infinity (video game)|Disney Infinity]]'' games are [[action-adventure game]]s with physical toys, open-world creation and story-driven gameplay. Characters, playsets and other features are brought into the game using figurines and discs with the included Infinity Base. With the exception of non-human characters, such as those from the ''[[Cars (franchise)|Cars]]'' series, each character has a double jump (unless in a vehicle) and a default set of attacks, as well as a unique ability. For example, [[List of Monsters, Inc. characters#James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan|Sulley]] and [[Jack Skellington]] can roar to scare others, while [[Violet Parr|Violet]] and [[Randall Boggs|Randall]] can turn invisible. There are two main modes in this game: Play Set<ref name=DisneyInfinityPlaysets/> and Toy Box.<ref name=\"2modes\">{{cite web|last=Nichols|first=Scott|title=Disney Infinity preview: Skylanders challenger not the usual toy story|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/gaming/news/a451638/disney-infinity-preview-skylanders-challenger-not-the-usual-toy-story.html|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=21 January 2013|date=18 January 2013}}</ref> Each playset is essentially a self-contained world with its own gameplay, based on a specific film or series with recognizable characters and storylines. Characters from one world cannot enter into another world, but players can put any characters together in Toy Box mode. Toy Box is a sandbox mode that players can fully customize and explore.\n\n===Play Set mode===\nThere are a number of playsets available in the series, which are accessed via placing the relevant playset piece onto the Infinity Base and are based upon several intellectual property franchises. These playsets include:\n;''Disney Infinity 1.0''\n*''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]''\n*''[[Monsters University]]''\n*''[[The Incredibles]]''\n*''[[Cars (franchise)|Cars]]'' \n*''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]'' \n*''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]] In Space'' \n\n''Disney Infinity 2.0 ''\n*''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|The Avengers]]''\n*''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Spider-Man]]''\n*''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''\n\n''Disney Infinity 3.0''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: Twilight of the Republic]]''\n*''[[Star Wars|Star Wars: Rise Against the Empire]]'' \n*''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''\n*''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]''\n*''[[Finding Dory]]''\n*''[[Marvel Comics|Marvel Battlegrounds]]''\n\n\nThese playsets have their own unique campaign, which can be played with up to two players. However, all characters from a specific franchise can only play in their respective playset (for example, [[Mr. Incredible]] can't be used in the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' playset), meaning two figures from the same series are required to play a playset in split-screen multiplayer. However, ''Marvel'', (except ''Marvel Battlegrounds'') and ''Star Wars'' playsets feature collectable \"Crossover/Champion coins\", which enable the use of certain characters from different playsets.<ref name=DisneyInfinityPlaysets>{{cite web | url=http://www.disneyinfinityfigures.com/disney-infinity-play-set-list | title=Disney INFINITY Playsets | publisher=Disney INFINITY Figures | date=29 May 2013 | access-date=29 May 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618233503/http://disneyinfinityfigures.com/disney-infinity-play-set-list | archive-date=June 18, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Playing through a playset unlocks objects and vehicles that can be used in the Toy Box mode.\n\n===Toy Box mode===\nToy Box mode<ref name=DisneyInfinityToyBoxMode>{{cite web |url=http://www.iheartinfinity.com/disney-infinity-toy-box-mode | title=Disney Infinity Toy Box Mode | publisher=Disney Infinity | date=29 May 2013 | accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> allows players to create their own game in an open-world arena. Players can mix and match everything that is unlocked within each of the playsets including characters, weapons and gadgets. By unlocking new content in the ''Disney Infinity'' playsets, players are able to build their own worlds and essentially create their own game.<ref name=\"DisneyInfinityToyBoxMode\" /> There are various \"adventures\" in this mode, which help teach the player how to use the mode's tools. Players can also earn \"spins\" by playing through playsets or leveling up their characters, which can be used to unlock additional items. The mode supports online multiplayer, in which players can play around with items that only the other player has, albeit only during that session.\n\nA portable Toy Box became available in late 2013, exclusively for the [[iPad]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/08/14/disney-infinity-goes-mobile|title=Disney Infinity Goes Mobile|last=Butts|first=Steve|date=August 14, 2013|accessdate=August 20, 2013|publisher=IGN}}</ref> A version of the Toy Box is also available for [[Microsoft Windows]]. These versions of the Toy Box utilize the web codes included with each ''Disney Infinity'' character.\n\n===Physical elements===\nThe ''Infinity Base''<ref name=\"dailymail\">{{cite web|title=Disney launches Infinity video game that costs more than an iPad Mini|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2263309/Disney-Infinity-video-game-costs-iPad-Mini--Infinity-base-characters-sold-separately.html|publisher=Daily Mail|accessdate=January 17, 2013|date=January 16, 2013}}</ref> has two round spots to place figurines, and a hexagonal spot to place world discs. When the figurines are placed on the ''Infinity Base'', the characters are imported into the game, while world discs unlock Play Sets.<ref name=\"2modes\" />\n\nPower Discs are discs that can be placed on the Infinity Base along with their characters to add new elements to the game. Players can use up to three environment enhancements (Hexagonal Power Discs) that can only be used in the Toy Box mode and up to two character enhancements (Circular Power Discs) per character. The environment enhancements can alter the terrain, change the background \"sky,\" add new vehicles or add new weapons. The character enhancements will alter things about the character such as damage done, replenish health, allow for faster experience gain for leveling and so on. One Power Disc is included with the Starter Pack while additional discs are sold in blind bags each containing two discs.<ref name=disneyinfinityfigures>{{cite web |

The third game, ''[[Disney Infinity 3.0]]'', was released on August 29, 2015 for [[PlayStation 4]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Wii U]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2015/05/05/june-cover-revealed-disney-infinity-3-0.aspx?|title=June Cover Revealed \u2013 Disney Infinity 3.0|first=Jeff|last=Cork|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=May 5, 2015|accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref> The series was discontinued on May 10, 2016, due to Avalanche Software's closure, despite some sources stating that there were some major plans in place to keep the series alive, and the presence of numerous new characters and playsets previously planned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iheartinfinity.com/disney-infinitys-ambitious-plans-future-cancelled/|title=Disney Infinity's Ambitious Plans For The Future (before it was cancelled...) -|date=May 13, 2016|website=Iheartinfinity.com|accessdate=December 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Gameplay==\n''[[Disney Infinity (video game)|Disney Infinity]]'' games are [[action-adventure game]]s with physical toys, open-world creation and story-driven gameplay. Characters, playsets and other features are brought into the game using figurines and discs with the included Infinity Base. With the exception of non-human characters, such as those from the ''[[Cars (franchise)|Cars]]'' series, each character has a double jump (unless in a vehicle) and a default set of attacks, as well as a unique ability. For example, [[List of Monsters, Inc. characters#James P. \"Sulley\" Sullivan|Sulley]] and [[Jack Skellington]] can roar to scare others, while [[Violet Parr|Violet]] and [[Randall Boggs|Randall]] can turn invisible. There are two main modes in this game: Play Set<ref name=DisneyInfinityPlaysets/> and Toy Box.<ref name=\"2modes\">{{cite web|last=Nichols|first=Scott|title=Disney Infinity preview: Skylanders challenger not the usual toy story|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/gaming/news/a451638/disney-infinity-preview-skylanders-challenger-not-the-usual-toy-story.html|publisher=Digital Spy|accessdate=21 January 2013|date=18 January 2013}}</ref> Each playset is essentially a self-contained world with its own gameplay, based on a specific film or series with recognizable characters and storylines. Characters from one world cannot enter into another world, but players can put any characters together in Toy Box mode. Toy Box is a sandbox mode that players can fully customize and explore.\n\n===Play Set mode===\nThere are a number of playsets available in the series, which are accessed via placing the relevant playset piece onto the Infinity Base and are based upon several intellectual property franchises. These playsets include:\n;''Disney Infinity 1.0''\n*''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]''\n*''[[Monsters University]]''\n*''[[The Incredibles]]''\n*''[[Cars (franchise)|Cars]]'' \n*''[[The Lone Ranger (2013 film)|The Lone Ranger]]'' \n*''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]] In Space'' \n\n''Disney Infinity 2.0 ''\n*''[[Avengers Assemble (TV series)|The Avengers]]''\n*''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Spider-Man]]''\n*''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''\n\n''Disney Infinity 3.0''\n*''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: Twilight of the Republic]]''\n*''[[Star Wars|Star Wars: Rise Against the Empire]]'' \n*''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]''\n*''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]''\n*''[[Finding Dory]]''\n*''[[Marvel Comics|Marvel Battlegrounds]]''\n\n\nThese playsets have their own unique campaign, which can be played with up to two players. However, all characters from a specific franchise can only play in their respective playset (for example, [[Mr. Incredible]] can't be used in the ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' playset), meaning two figures from the same series are required to play a playset in split-screen multiplayer. However, ''Marvel'', (except ''Marvel Battlegrounds'') and ''Star Wars'' playsets feature collectable \"Crossover/Champion coins\", which enable the use of certain characters from different playsets.<ref name=DisneyInfinityPlaysets>{{cite web | url=http://www.disneyinfinityfigures.com/disney-infinity-play-set-list | title=Disney INFINITY Playsets | publisher=Disney INFINITY Figures | date=29 May 2013 | access-date=29 May 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618233503/http://disneyinfinityfigures.com/disney-infinity-play-set-list | archive-date=June 18, 2013 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Playing through a playset unlocks objects and vehicles that can be used in the Toy Box mode.\n\n===Toy Box mode===\nToy Box mode<ref name=DisneyInfinityToyBoxMode>{{cite web |url=http://www.iheartinfinity.com/disney-infinity-toy-box-mode | title=Disney Infinity Toy Box Mode | publisher=Disney Infinity | date=29 May 2013 | accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref> allows players to create their own game in an open-world arena. Players can mix and match everything that is unlocked within each of the playsets including characters, weapons and gadgets. By unlocking new content in the ''Disney Infinity'' playsets, players are able to build their own worlds and essentially create their own game.<ref name=\"DisneyInfinityToyBoxMode\" /> There are various \"adventures\" in this mode, which help teach the player how to use the mode's tools. Players can also earn \"spins\" by playing through playsets or leveling up their characters, which can be used to unlock additional items. The mode supports online multiplayer, in which players can play around with items that only the other player has, albeit only during that session.\n\nA portable Toy Box became available in late 2013, exclusively for the [[iPad]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2013/08/14/disney-infinity-goes-mobile|title=Disney Infinity Goes Mobile|last=Butts|first=Steve|date=August 14, 2013|accessdate=August 20, 2013|publisher=IGN}}</ref> A version of the Toy Box is also available for [[Microsoft Windows]].

When the figurines are placed on the ''Infinity Base'', the characters are imported into the game, while world discs unlock Play Sets.<ref name=\"2modes\" />\n\nPower Discs are discs that can be placed on the Infinity Base along with their characters to add new elements to the game. Players can use up to three environment enhancements (Hexagonal Power Discs) that can only be used in the Toy Box mode and up to two character enhancements (Circular Power Discs) per character. The environment enhancements can alter the terrain, change the background \"sky,\" add new vehicles or add new weapons. The character enhancements will alter things about the character such as damage done, replenish health, allow for faster experience gain for leveling and so on. One Power Disc is included with the Starter Pack while additional discs are sold in blind bags each containing two discs.<ref name=disneyinfinityfigures>{{cite web |
