However, there have been numerous incidents of religious intolerance that resulted in [[riot]]s and violence, notably, the [[1984 anti-Sikh riots|1984 Anti Sikh Riots]] in [[Delhi]], [[Exodus of Kashmiri Hindus|1990 Anti-Hindu riots]] in [[Kashmir]], [[2002 Gujarat Riots]] and the [[Religious violence in Odisha#2008 Kandhamal violence|2008 Anti-Christian riots]] in [[Odisha]].\n\nIndia is one of the most diverse nations in terms of religion, it being the birthplace of four major world religions: [[Jainism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Sikhism]]. Even though [[Hindus]] form close to 80 percent of the population, India also has region-specific religious practices: for instance, [[Jammu and Kashmir]] has a Muslim majority, [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] has a Sikh majority, [[Nagaland]], [[Meghalaya]] and [[Mizoram]] have Christian majorities and the [[Indian Himalayan region|Indian Himalayan States]] such as [[Sikkim]] and [[Ladakh]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and the state of [[Maharashtra]] and the [[Darjeeling District]] of [[West Bengal]] have large concentrations of [[Buddhist]] population. The country has significant [[Muslim]], [[Sikh]], [[Christians|Christian]], [[Buddhist]], [[Jain]]  and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] populations. [[Islam]] is the largest minority religion in India, and the [[Indian Muslims]] form the third largest Muslim population in the world, accounting for over 14 percent of the nation's population.\n\n[[Rajni Kothari]], founder of the [[Centre for the Study of Developing Societies]] has written, \"India is a country built on the foundations of a civilisation that is fundamentally tolerant.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Rajni Kothari|title=Communalism in Indian Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruNtAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Rainbow Publishers|isbn=978-81-86962-00-8|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ruNtAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA134&dq=%22foundations+of+a+civilisation+that+is+fundamentally+non\u2013religious%22 134]|access-date=5 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519113812/https://books.google.com/books?id=ruNtAAAAMAAJ|archive-date=19 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{More citations needed section|date=November 2017}}\n\n===Tradition of religious freedom===\nThe plural nature of Indian society in the 3rd century BC was encapsulated in an inscription of [[Ashoka]]:\n\n<blockquote>King Piyadasi ([[Ashoka]]) dear to the Gods, honours all sects, the ascetics (hermits) or those who dwell at home, he honours them with charity and in other ways. But the King, dear to the Gods, attributes less importance to this charity and these honours than to the vow of seeing the reign of virtues, which constitutes the essential part of them. For all these virtues there is a common source, modesty of speech. That is to say, One must not exalt one&rsquo;s creed discrediting all others, nor must one degrade these others Without legitimate reasons. One must, on the contrary, render to other creeds the honour befitting them.</blockquote>\n\nEmperor [[Kharvela]] (born in the family of Rajarshi Vasu) declares himself in his inscription (approximately 2nd century BCE):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0103&L=INDOLOGY&P=R6520&I=-3 |title=INDOLOGY archives \u2013 March 2001 (#143) |publisher=Listserv.liv.ac.uk |date=}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|\nsava pasa-nd-a-puujako, sava devaayatan-sanskaarako\n\nI am worshipper of all sects, restorer of all shrines. \n}}\n\nKharvela's self-description must be contrasted with other rulers around the world, who took pride in calling themselves \"but-shikan\" or \"defender of the (only true) faith\".\n\nBadayuni in his Muntakhab-ut-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh reports that the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]], who had established the [[Din-i-Ilahi]] faith, decreed the following in AH 1000 (1551\u20131552 CE):\n\n<blockquote>Hindus who, when young, had from pressure become Musalmans, were allowed to go back to the faith of their fathers. No man should be interfered with on account of his religion, and every one should be allowed to change his religion, if he liked. ...People should not be molested, if they wished to build churches and prayer rooms, or idol temples, or fire temples.</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Sikh]] Gurus built freedom of religion in their faith to such an extent that while being a persecuted minority themselves under many Mughal rulers like [[Aurangzeb]], [[Sikhs]] felt obliged to fight for the religious freedom of others. The sixth Guru of Sikhs, [[Guru Hargobind]], even had a mosque built for his Muslim disciples, instead of putting them under any pressure to adopt the Sikh faith.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010224/windows/main1.htm|title=The Tribune - Windows - Main Feature|website=tribuneindia.com|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref>\nThe tradition of religious freedom continued under [[Sikh Empire]], and other Sikh Principalities where Sikh rulers commissioned several Gurdwaras, Temples and Mosques for their subjects of various faiths.\n\n===Refuge from religious persecution===\nIndia, with its traditional tolerance, has served as a refuge for groups that have encountered persecution elsewhere.\n\n*Jews: Jews in India were granted lands and trading rights. The oldest of the three longest-established Jewish communities in India, traders from [[Judea]] and [[Israel]] arrived in the city of [[Cochin]], in what is now [[Kerala]], 2,500 years ago and are now known as [[Cochin Jews]]. According to recordings by Jews, the date of the first arrival is given at 562 BC. In 68 AD, more Jews fled to Kerala to escape attacks by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] on [[Jerusalem]].\n* Christians: Christianity is believed to have come to India in the 1st century through [[Thomas the Apostle|Saint Thomas]] who formed the [[Saint Thomas Christians]] in Kerala. Later in the 15th and 16th centuries European Missionaries brought in Christianity in places such as [[Goa]] and [[Mangalore]]. Protestant Missionaries came in 18th and 19th centuries to [[North-East India]].\n* [[Parsi people|Parsi]]: The [[Zoroastrian]]s from [[Greater Persia]] arrived in India fleeing from religious persecution in their native land in the 9th century. They flourished in India and in 18\u201319th centuries intervened on behalf of their co-religionists still in Greater Persia.

In the west, state and church(religion) is separate and do not intervene in each other's internal affairs. But this is not the case with India, here secularism means 'respect for all religions' and 'keeping a principled distance' from each religion. The Indian constitution permits the central government to intervene in religion but this intervention should be based on constitution only. If some tenets, principles or beliefs of any particular religion violates the constitution or the law of the land, then the Indian government is mandated to intervene and remedy the situation. [[Government of India]] has for a few times have intervened in religions historically as mandated by the constitution. The enactment of anti-untouchability act(SC/ST Act,1989) and also the recent law banning triple talak among the muslim community is example of this constitutionally mandated intervention. Government also intervene when women of any religion are denied opportunities or equality as gender equality is guaranteed by the Indian constitution.\n\nArticle 25 (2b) uses the term \"Hindus\" for all classes and sections of [[Hinduism|Hindus]], [[Jainism|Jains]], [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] and [[Sikhism|Sikhs]].<ref name=\":1\" /> Sikhs and Buddhists objected to this wording that makes many Hindu [[Personal laws in India|personal laws]] applicable to them.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title = Freedom of Religion and Belief: A World Report|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JxgFWwK8dXwC|publisher = Routledge|date = 2013-03-07|isbn = 9781134722297|first = Kevin|last = Boyle|first2 = Juliet|last2 = Sheen|pages = 191\u2013192|access-date = 15 September 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160513181649/https://books.google.com/books?id=JxgFWwK8dXwC|archive-date = 13 May 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> However, the same article also guarantees the right of members of the Sikh faith to bear a [[Kirpan]].<ref>The Constitution of India, Right to Freedom of religion, Article 25 | {{cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-09-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140909230437/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf |archivedate=9 September 2014 |df=dmy }}</ref> Religions require no registration.

However, this bill was passed in 1968 as \u2018The Freedom of Religion Act.\u2019 The [[Madhya Pradesh]] \u2018Freedom of Religion Act\u2019 requires that a convert produce a legal affidavit that s/he was not under any pressure, force, or allurement to convert but was converting by own will and desire after evaluating the religion properly. Also according to this law, anyone who writes or speaks or sings of \u2018divine displeasure\u2019 (with an intention to induce [[forced conversion]] by means of threat) can be imprisoned for a period of up to two years and fined up to five thousand rupees.\n\n===The Orissa Freedom of Religions Act of 1967===\nThe [[Orissa]] Freedom of Religions Act of 1967 states that \u201cno person shall convert or attempt to convert either directly or otherwise any person from one religious faith to another by the use of force or by inducement or by any fraudulent means nor shall any person abet any such conversion.\u201d Contravention of this law was punishable with imprisonment of up to one year and/or a fine of up to Rs 5,000. In the case of a minor, a woman, or a person belonging to a Scheduled Caste or Tribe, the punishment was up to two years of imprisonment and the limit of the fine raised to Rs. 10,000. The Orissa High Court, however, struck down the Act as ultra vires of the Constitution on the ground that the state legislature did not have the right to legislate matters of religion. The same year, the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] also enacted the [[Madhya Pradesh]] Freedom of Religion Act as seen above. However, the [[Madhya Pradesh]] High Court, in contrary to the Orissa High Court, negated the challenge of some Christians that the Act violated their fundamental right as provided under Article 25 of the Constitution. The decisions of both the Courts were challenged before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the [[Madhya Pradesh]] High Court and reversed the decision of the Orissa High Court.<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WHQ2M1lLGVcC&printsec=frontcover |title=Secularism in India - Domenic Marbaniang - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425051343/https://books.google.com/books?id=WHQ2M1lLGVcC&printsec=frontcover |archive-date=25 April 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===The Arunachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act of 1978===\nThe Arunachal Pradesh government enacted this Act to protect the tribals of Arunachal Pradesh from forced conversions of any kind.

Even though [[Hindus]] form close to 80 percent of the population, India also has region-specific religious practices: for instance, [[Jammu and Kashmir]] has a Muslim majority, [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] has a Sikh majority, [[Nagaland]], [[Meghalaya]] and [[Mizoram]] have Christian majorities and the [[Indian Himalayan region|Indian Himalayan States]] such as [[Sikkim]] and [[Ladakh]], [[Arunachal Pradesh]] and the state of [[Maharashtra]] and the [[Darjeeling District]] of [[West Bengal]] have large concentrations of [[Buddhist]] population.

But the King, dear to the Gods, attributes less importance to this charity and these honours than to the vow of seeing the reign of virtues, which constitutes the essential part of them. For all these virtues there is a common source, modesty of speech. That is to say, One must not exalt one&rsquo;s creed discrediting all others, nor must one degrade these others Without legitimate reasons. One must, on the contrary, render to other creeds the honour befitting them.</blockquote>\n\nEmperor [[Kharvela]] (born in the family of Rajarshi Vasu) declares himself in his inscription (approximately 2nd century BCE):<ref>{{cite web|url=http://listserv.liv.ac.uk/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0103&L=INDOLOGY&P=R6520&I=-3 |title=INDOLOGY archives \u2013 March 2001 (#143) |publisher=Listserv.liv.ac.uk |date=}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|\nsava pasa-nd-a-puujako, sava devaayatan-sanskaarako\n\nI am worshipper of all sects, restorer of all shrines. \n}}\n\nKharvela's self-description must be contrasted with other rulers around the world, who took pride in calling themselves \"but-shikan\" or \"defender of the (only true) faith\".\n\nBadayuni in his Muntakhab-ut-Taw\u00e1r\u00edkh reports that the Mughal Emperor [[Akbar]], who had established the [[Din-i-Ilahi]] faith, decreed the following in AH 1000 (1551\u20131552 CE):\n\n<blockquote>Hindus who, when young, had from pressure become Musalmans, were allowed to go back to the faith of their fathers. No man should be interfered with on account of his religion, and every one should be allowed to change his religion, if he liked. ...People should not be molested, if they wished to build churches and prayer rooms, or idol temples, or fire temples.</blockquote>\n\nThe [[Sikh]] Gurus built freedom of religion in their faith to such an extent that while being a persecuted minority themselves under many Mughal rulers like [[Aurangzeb]], [[Sikhs]] felt obliged to fight for the religious freedom of others. The sixth Guru of Sikhs, [[Guru Hargobind]], even had a mosque built for his Muslim disciples, instead of putting them under any pressure to adopt the Sikh faith.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tribuneindia.com/2001/20010224/windows/main1.htm|title=The Tribune - Windows - Main Feature|website=tribuneindia.com|access-date=2019-08-23}}</ref>\nThe tradition of religious freedom continued under [[Sikh Empire]], and other Sikh Principalities where Sikh rulers commissioned several Gurdwaras, Temples and Mosques for their subjects of various faiths.\n\n===Refuge from religious persecution===\nIndia, with its traditional tolerance, has served as a refuge for groups that have encountered persecution elsewhere.\n\n*Jews: Jews in India were granted lands and trading rights.

In the west, state and church(religion) is separate and do not intervene in each other's internal affairs. But this is not the case with India, here secularism means 'respect for all religions' and 'keeping a principled distance' from each religion. The Indian constitution permits the central government to intervene in religion but this intervention should be based on constitution only. If some tenets, principles or beliefs of any particular religion violates the constitution or the law of the land, then the Indian government is mandated to intervene and remedy the situation. [[Government of India]] has for a few times have intervened in religions historically as mandated by the constitution. The enactment of anti-untouchability act(SC/ST Act,1989) and also the recent law banning triple talak among the muslim community is example of this constitutionally mandated intervention.

Also according to this law, anyone who writes or speaks or sings of \u2018divine displeasure\u2019 (with an intention to induce [[forced conversion]] by means of threat) can be imprisoned for a period of up to two years and fined up to five thousand rupees.\n\n===The Orissa Freedom of Religions Act of 1967===\nThe [[Orissa]] Freedom of Religions Act of 1967 states that \u201cno person shall convert or attempt to convert either directly or otherwise any person from one religious faith to another by the use of force or by inducement or by any fraudulent means nor shall any person abet any such conversion.\u201d Contravention of this law was punishable with imprisonment of up to one year and/or a fine of up to Rs 5,000. In the case of a minor, a woman, or a person belonging to a Scheduled Caste or Tribe, the punishment was up to two years of imprisonment and the limit of the fine raised to Rs. 10,000. The Orissa High Court, however, struck down the Act as ultra vires of the Constitution on the ground that the state legislature did not have the right to legislate matters of religion. The same year, the state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] also enacted the [[Madhya Pradesh]] Freedom of Religion Act as seen above. However, the [[Madhya Pradesh]] High Court, in contrary to the Orissa High Court, negated the challenge of some Christians that the Act violated their fundamental right as provided under Article 25 of the Constitution. The decisions of both the Courts were challenged before the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the [[Madhya Pradesh]] High Court and reversed the decision of the Orissa High Court.<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WHQ2M1lLGVcC&printsec=frontcover |title=Secularism in India - Domenic Marbaniang - Google Boeken |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425051343/https://books.google.com/books?id=WHQ2M1lLGVcC&printsec=frontcover |archive-date=25 April 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n===The Arunachal Pradesh Freedom of Religion Act of 1978===\nThe Arunachal Pradesh government enacted this Act to protect the tribals of Arunachal Pradesh from forced conversions of any kind.
