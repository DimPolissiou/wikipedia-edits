The articles were never specific as to what exactly red mercury was, but nevertheless claimed it was of great importance in nuclear bombs, or that it was used in the building of [[boosted fission weapon]]s. Almost as soon as the stories appeared, people started attempting to buy it. At that point the exact nature of the substance started to change, and eventually turned into anything the buyer happened to be interested in. As ''[[New Scientist]]'' reported in 1992, a [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] report outlined that:\n\n<blockquote>When red mercury first appeared on the international black market 15 years ago, the supposedly top secret nuclear material was 'red' because it came from Russia. When it resurfaced last year in the formerly communist states of Eastern Europe it had unaccountably acquired a red colour. But then, as a report from the US Department of Energy reveals, mysterious transformations are red mercury's stock in trade.\n\nThe report, compiled by researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, shows that in the hands of hoaxers and conmen, red mercury can do almost anything the aspiring Third World demagogue wants it to. You want a short cut to making an atom bomb? You want the key to Soviet ballistic missile guidance systems? Or perhaps you want the Russian alternative to the anti-radar paint on the [[Stealth technology|stealth]] bomber? What you need is red mercury.<ref>{{cite web |first=William |last=Bown |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg13418241.900-only-fools-still-hunt-for-elusive-red-mercury-.html |title=Only fools still hunt for elusive red mercury |work=[[New Scientist]] |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |date=6 June 1992 |accessdate=15 May 2014 |url-access=subscription }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAn article in the daily Russian newspaper states that ''[[Pravda]]'' in 1993, claiming to be based on leaked top secret memos, described red mercury as:\n\n<blockquote>[A] super-conductive material used for producing high-precision conventional and nuclear bomb explosives, 'Stealth' surfaces and self-guided warheads.

Cohen]], an American physicist who worked on building the atomic bomb, said in his autobiography that red mercury is manufactured by \"mixing special nuclear materials in very small amounts into the ordinary compound and then inserting the mixture into a nuclear reactor or bombarding it with a particle-accelerator beam.\"  When detonated, this mixture allegedly becomes \"extremely hot, which allows pressures and temperatures to be built up that are capable of igniting the heavy hydrogen and producing a pure-fusion mini neutron bomb.\"<ref name=doomsday />\n\nRed mercury was offered for sale throughout Europe and the Middle East by Russian businessmen, who found many buyers who would pay almost anything for the substance even though they had no idea what it was.  A study for the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'' in 1997 has perhaps the best summary of the topic:\n\n<blockquote>The asking price for red mercury ranged from $100,000 to $300,000 per kilogram. Sometimes the material would be irradiated or shipped in containers with radioactive symbols, perhaps to convince potential buyers of its strategic value.

They were tried for \"trying to set up funding or property for terrorism\" and \"having an article (a highly dangerous mercury based substance) for terrorism\". According to the prosecutor, red mercury was believed to be a material which could cause a large explosion, possibly even a nuclear reaction, but whether or not red mercury actually existed was irrelevant to the prosecution.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4943122.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Terror accused in 'mercury sting' | date=25 April 2006}}</ref> All three men were acquitted in July 2006.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5176382.stm | work=BBC News | first=Chris | last=Summers | title=What is red mercury? | date=25 July 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/5176522.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Trio cleared of red mercury plot | date=25 July 2006}}</ref>\n\n== Analysis ==\n\nSeveral common mercury compounds are indeed red, such as [[mercury sulfide]] (from which the bright-red pigment [[vermilion]] was originally derived), [[mercury(II) oxide]], and [[mercury(II) iodide]], and others are explosive, such as [[mercury(II) fulminate]].

In general, however, none of these explanations appear to be scientifically or historically supportable.\n\n===Background===\nTraditional [[Nuclear weapon design#Two-stage thermonuclear weapons|staged thermonuclear weapons]] consist of two parts, a [[Nuclear fission|fission]] \"primary\" and a fusion/fission \"secondary\". The energy released by the primary when it explodes is used to (indirectly) compress the secondary and start a [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] reaction within it. Conventional explosives are far too weak to provide the level of compression needed.\n\nThe primary is generally built as small as possible, due to the fact that the energy released by the secondary is much larger, and thus building a larger primary is generally inefficient. There is a lower limit on the size of the primary that can be built, known as the [[critical mass]]. For weapons grade [[plutonium]], this is around 10&nbsp;kg. This can be reduced through the use of [[neutron reflector]]s or clever arrangements of explosives to compress the core, but these methods generally add to the size and complexity of the resulting device.\n\nDue to the need for a fission primary, and the difficulty of purifying weapons-grade fissile materials, the majority of [[arms control]] efforts to limit [[nuclear proliferation]] rely on the detection and control of the fissile material and the equipment needed to obtain it.\n\n===Shortcut to fissionable material===\nA theory popular in the mid-1990s was that red mercury facilitated the enrichment of uranium to weapons-grade purity. Conventionally, such enrichment is usually done with [[Zippe-type centrifuge]]s, and takes several years. Red mercury was speculated{{who|date=June 2011}} to eliminate this costly and time-consuming step. Although this would not eliminate the possibility of detecting the material, it could escape detection during enrichment as the facilities hosting centrifuges normally used in this process are very large and require equipment that can be fairly easily tracked internationally. Eliminating such equipment would in theory greatly ease the construction of a clandestine nuclear weapon.\n\n===Shortcut to fusible material===\nA key part of the secondary in a [[fusion bomb]] is [[Isotopes of lithium|lithium-6]]-deuteride. When irradiated with high-energy [[neutron]]s, Li-6 creates [[tritium]], which mixes with the deuterium in the same mixture and fuses at a relatively low temperature. Russian weapon designers have reported (1993) that red mercury was the Soviet codename for lithium-6, which has an affinity for mercury and tends to acquire a red colour due to mercuric impurities during its separation process.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Hibbs | first = Mark | author-link = | title = 'Red mercury' is lithium-6, Russian weaponsmiths say | journal = Nucleonics Week | volume = | issue = 10 | pages = | date = 22 July 1993 | url = | doi = | id = }}</ref><ref>M.

Cohen]], the \"father of the [[neutron bomb]]\", claimed for a long time that red mercury is a powerful explosive-like chemical known as a [[ballotechnics|ballotechnic]]. The energy released during its reaction is allegedly enough to directly compress the secondary without the need for a fission primary in a [[Nuclear weapon design|thermonuclear weapon]]. He claimed that he learned that the Soviet scientists perfected the use of red mercury and used it to produce a number of [[softball]]-sized [[Pure fusion weapon|pure fusion bombs]] weighing as little as {{convert|10|lb|abbr=on}}, which he claimed were made in large numbers.<ref name=fse>{{Cite journal | last = Cohen | first = Sam | last2 = Douglass | first2 = Joe | title = The nuclear threat that doesn't exist \u2013 or does it? | publisher = Financial Sense Editorials | date = 11 March 2003 | url = http://www.financialsense.com/editorials/douglass/2003/0311.html | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081016050603/http://www.financialsense.com/editorials/douglass/2003/0311.html | archivedate = 16 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\nHe went on to claim that the reason this is not more widely known is that elements within the US power structure are deliberately keeping it \"under wraps\" due to the frightening implications such a weapon would have on nuclear proliferation. Since a red mercury bomb would require no fissile material, it would seemingly be impossible to protect against its widespread proliferation given current arms control methodologies. Instead of trying to do so, they simply claim it does not exist, while acknowledging its existence privately. Cohen also claimed that when President [[Boris Yeltsin]] took power, he secretly authorized the sale of red mercury on the international market, and that fake versions of it were sometimes offered to gullible buyers.<ref name=fse/>\n\nCohen's claims appear to be difficult to support scientifically. The amount of energy released by the fission primary is thousands of times greater than that released by conventional explosives, and it appears{{who|date=June 2011}} that the \"red mercury\" approach would be orders of magnitude smaller than required. Furthermore, ballotechnic materials are those that do ''not'' explode, so it is difficult to understand how their energy could be used to produce compression at all.{{original research inline|date=June 2011}}\n\nAdditionally, it appears there is no independent confirmation of any sort of Cohen's claims to the reality of red mercury. The scientists{{who|date=June 2011}} in charge of the labs where the material would have been made have publicly dismissed the claims (see below), as have numerous US colleagues, including [[Edward Teller]].\n\nAccording to Cohen,<ref name=fse/> veteran nuclear weapon designer Dr. [[Frank Barnaby]] conducted secret interviews with Russian scientists who told him that red mercury was produced by dissolving mercury antimony oxide in mercury, heating and [[Irradiation|irradiating]] the resultant [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]], and then removing the elemental mercury through evaporation.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Barnaby | first = Frank | author-link = | title = Red mercury: Is there a pure-fusion bomb for sale? | journal = International Defense Review | volume = | issue = 6 | pages = 79\u201381 | year = 1994 | url = | doi = | id = }}</ref> The irradiation was reportedly carried out by placing the substance inside a nuclear reactor.<ref name=\"guardian\">{{Cite news | last = Adam | first = David | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = What is red mercury? | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | pages = | date = 30 September 2004 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/sep/30/thisweekssciencequestions1 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n===Stealth paint===\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the origins of the term \"red mercury\" was in the Russian newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'', which claimed that red mercury was \"a super-conductive material used for producing high-precision conventional and nuclear bomb explosives, 'stealth' surfaces and self-guided warheads.\"<ref name=Yelysingate /> Any substance with these sorts of highly differing properties would be suspect to most, but the stealth story continued to have some traction long after most had dismissed the entire story.\n\n===Nuclear \"sting\" operations===\nRed mercury is thought by some to be the invention of an intelligence agency or criminal gang for the purpose of deceiving terrorists and rogue states who were trying to acquire nuclear technology on the black market.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzlNgS70OHAC&pg=RA1-PA313|page=313|author=Eric Croddy, James J.

The articles were never specific as to what exactly red mercury was, but nevertheless claimed it was of great importance in nuclear bombs, or that it was used in the building of [[boosted fission weapon]]s. Almost as soon as the stories appeared, people started attempting to buy it. At that point the exact nature of the substance started to change, and eventually turned into anything the buyer happened to be interested in. As ''[[New Scientist]]'' reported in 1992, a [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]] report outlined that:\n\n<blockquote>When red mercury first appeared on the international black market 15 years ago, the supposedly top secret nuclear material was 'red' because it came from Russia. When it resurfaced last year in the formerly communist states of Eastern Europe it had unaccountably acquired a red colour. But then, as a report from the US Department of Energy reveals, mysterious transformations are red mercury's stock in trade.\n\nThe report, compiled by researchers at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, shows that in the hands of hoaxers and conmen, red mercury can do almost anything the aspiring Third World demagogue wants it to. You want a short cut to making an atom bomb? You want the key to Soviet ballistic missile guidance systems?

A study for the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]'' in 1997 has perhaps the best summary of the topic:\n\n<blockquote>The asking price for red mercury ranged from $100,000 to $300,000 per kilogram.

In general, however, none of these explanations appear to be scientifically or historically supportable.\n\n===Background===\nTraditional [[Nuclear weapon design#Two-stage thermonuclear weapons|staged thermonuclear weapons]] consist of two parts, a [[Nuclear fission|fission]] \"primary\" and a fusion/fission \"secondary\". The energy released by the primary when it explodes is used to (indirectly) compress the secondary and start a [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] reaction within it. Conventional explosives are far too weak to provide the level of compression needed.\n\nThe primary is generally built as small as possible, due to the fact that the energy released by the secondary is much larger, and thus building a larger primary is generally inefficient. There is a lower limit on the size of the primary that can be built, known as the [[critical mass]]. For weapons grade [[plutonium]], this is around 10&nbsp;kg. This can be reduced through the use of [[neutron reflector]]s or clever arrangements of explosives to compress the core, but these methods generally add to the size and complexity of the resulting device.\n\nDue to the need for a fission primary, and the difficulty of purifying weapons-grade fissile materials, the majority of [[arms control]] efforts to limit [[nuclear proliferation]] rely on the detection and control of the fissile material and the equipment needed to obtain it.\n\n===Shortcut to fissionable material===\nA theory popular in the mid-1990s was that red mercury facilitated the enrichment of uranium to weapons-grade purity. Conventionally, such enrichment is usually done with [[Zippe-type centrifuge]]s, and takes several years. Red mercury was speculated{{who|date=June 2011}} to eliminate this costly and time-consuming step. Although this would not eliminate the possibility of detecting the material, it could escape detection during enrichment as the facilities hosting centrifuges normally used in this process are very large and require equipment that can be fairly easily tracked internationally. Eliminating such equipment would in theory greatly ease the construction of a clandestine nuclear weapon.\n\n===Shortcut to fusible material===\nA key part of the secondary in a [[fusion bomb]] is [[Isotopes of lithium|lithium-6]]-deuteride. When irradiated with high-energy [[neutron]]s, Li-6 creates [[tritium]], which mixes with the deuterium in the same mixture and fuses at a relatively low temperature. Russian weapon designers have reported (1993) that red mercury was the Soviet codename for lithium-6, which has an affinity for mercury and tends to acquire a red colour due to mercuric impurities during its separation process.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Hibbs | first = Mark | author-link = | title = 'Red mercury' is lithium-6, Russian weaponsmiths say | journal = Nucleonics Week | volume = | issue = 10 | pages = | date = 22 July 1993 | url = | doi = | id = }}</ref><ref>M.

Cohen]], the \"father of the [[neutron bomb]]\", claimed for a long time that red mercury is a powerful explosive-like chemical known as a [[ballotechnics|ballotechnic]]. The energy released during its reaction is allegedly enough to directly compress the secondary without the need for a fission primary in a [[Nuclear weapon design|thermonuclear weapon]]. He claimed that he learned that the Soviet scientists perfected the use of red mercury and used it to produce a number of [[softball]]-sized [[Pure fusion weapon|pure fusion bombs]] weighing as little as {{convert|10|lb|abbr=on}}, which he claimed were made in large numbers.<ref name=fse>{{Cite journal | last = Cohen | first = Sam | last2 = Douglass | first2 = Joe | title = The nuclear threat that doesn't exist \u2013 or does it? | publisher = Financial Sense Editorials | date = 11 March 2003 | url = http://www.financialsense.com/editorials/douglass/2003/0311.html | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081016050603/http://www.financialsense.com/editorials/douglass/2003/0311.html | archivedate = 16 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\nHe went on to claim that the reason this is not more widely known is that elements within the US power structure are deliberately keeping it \"under wraps\" due to the frightening implications such a weapon would have on nuclear proliferation. Since a red mercury bomb would require no fissile material, it would seemingly be impossible to protect against its widespread proliferation given current arms control methodologies. Instead of trying to do so, they simply claim it does not exist, while acknowledging its existence privately. Cohen also claimed that when President [[Boris Yeltsin]] took power, he secretly authorized the sale of red mercury on the international market, and that fake versions of it were sometimes offered to gullible buyers.<ref name=fse/>\n\nCohen's claims appear to be difficult to support scientifically. The amount of energy released by the fission primary is thousands of times greater than that released by conventional explosives, and it appears{{who|date=June 2011}} that the \"red mercury\" approach would be orders of magnitude smaller than required. Furthermore, ballotechnic materials are those that do ''not'' explode, so it is difficult to understand how their energy could be used to produce compression at all.{{original research inline|date=June 2011}}\n\nAdditionally, it appears there is no independent confirmation of any sort of Cohen's claims to the reality of red mercury. The scientists{{who|date=June 2011}} in charge of the labs where the material would have been made have publicly dismissed the claims (see below), as have numerous US colleagues, including [[Edward Teller]].\n\nAccording to Cohen,<ref name=fse/> veteran nuclear weapon designer Dr. [[Frank Barnaby]] conducted secret interviews with Russian scientists who told him that red mercury was produced by dissolving mercury antimony oxide in mercury, heating and [[Irradiation|irradiating]] the resultant [[amalgam (chemistry)|amalgam]], and then removing the elemental mercury through evaporation.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Barnaby | first = Frank | author-link = | title = Red mercury: Is there a pure-fusion bomb for sale? | journal = International Defense Review | volume = | issue = 6 | pages = 79\u201381 | year = 1994 | url = | doi = | id = }}</ref> The irradiation was reportedly carried out by placing the substance inside a nuclear reactor.<ref name=\"guardian\">{{Cite news | last = Adam | first = David | author-link = | last2 = | first2 = | author2-link = | title = What is red mercury? | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | pages = | date = 30 September 2004 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2004/sep/30/thisweekssciencequestions1 | location=London}}</ref>\n\n===Stealth paint===\nAs mentioned earlier, one of the origins of the term \"red mercury\" was in the Russian newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'', which claimed that red mercury was \"a super-conductive material used for producing high-precision conventional and nuclear bomb explosives, 'stealth' surfaces and self-guided warheads.\"<ref name=Yelysingate /> Any substance with these sorts of highly differing properties would be suspect to most, but the stealth story continued to have some traction long after most had dismissed the entire story.\n\n===Nuclear \"sting\" operations===\nRed mercury is thought by some to be the invention of an intelligence agency or criminal gang for the purpose of deceiving terrorists and rogue states who were trying to acquire nuclear technology on the black market.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzlNgS70OHAC&pg=RA1-PA313|page=313|author=Eric Croddy, James J.

In some cases it was reported that unscrupulous traders may be deliberately promoting this misconception in an effort to build a market for recovered ordnance.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.landmineaction.org/resources/resource.asp?resID=1051 |title=Explosive remnants of War: unexploded ordnance and post-conflict communities |work=landmineaction.org |publisher=Landmine Action |date=31 March 2002 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211075530/http://www.landmineaction.org/resources/resource.asp?resID=1051 |archivedate=11 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\nAn explosion in [[Chitungwiza]], Zimbabwe that killed five people is attributed to a quest to reclaim red mercury from a live landmine.<ref>{{cite news|title=Soldier, ex-cop 'among dead' in Zengeza blast|url=http://www.newzimbabwe.com/news-10095-Soldier,+ex-cop+%E2%80%98among+Zengeza+dead/news.aspx|accessdate=26 January 2013|newspaper=New Zimbabwe|date=24 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Saudi Arabia===\nIn April 2009 it was reported from Saudi Arabia that rumors that [[Singer Corporation|Singer]] sewing machines contained \"red mercury\" had caused the prices of such machines to massively increase in the Kingdom, with some paying up to [[Saudi riyal|SR]]200,000 for a single machine which could previously have been bought for SR200.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/04/15/2543046.htm |title=Red mercury hoax sparks sewing machine frenzy |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=15 April 2009}}</ref>  Believers in the rumor claimed that the presence of red mercury in the sewing machines' needles could be detected using a mobile telephone; if the line cut off when the telephone was placed near to the needle, this supposedly proved that the substance was present.\n\nIn [[Medina]] there was a busy trade in the sewing machines, with buyers seen using mobile phones to check the machines for red mercury content, while it was reported that others had resorted to theft, with two tailors' shops in Dhulum broken into and their sewing machines stolen.

All four also belonged to [[Blood of Kingu]] until it was disbanded. Their lyrics embrace [[Slavic mythology]]. Many of the band's lyrics are derived from the works of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Ukrainian poets ([[Oleksandr Oles]], [[Oleh Olzhych]], [[Maik Yohansen]] etc.) and especially [[Taras Shevchenko]].\n\nDrudkh have been particularly secretive throughout the course of their career, even for a black metal band, giving no interviews and not releasing the lyrics to several of their albums.

Their early releases were released on CD through the [[England|English]] [[extreme metal]] record label [[Supernal Music]], with the exception of the EP (which was a vinyl release), and, again with the exception of the EP, on vinyl through two [[Finland|Finnish]] black metal labels, [[Northern Heritage]] and Faustian Distribution. More recent release have been through Season of Mist, which has also issued remastered versions of the band's earlier albums as [[digipak]]s.\n\nThe band's first album, ''[[Forgotten Legends]]'', was released on August 18, 2003. The album establishes the band's trademark epic sound; its three tracks and one [[conclusion (music)|outro]] span nearly forty minutes, with the longest track, \"False Dawn\", nearing the sixteen-minute mark. ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' included ''Forgotten Legends'' in its Top 40 Black Metal albums list.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.ign.com/boards/threads/terrorizer-magazines-top-40-black-metal-albums.186480191/\n| title = Terrorizer Magazine's Top 40 Black Metal Albums\n| work = IGN Boards\n| date = October 30, 2009\n| accessdate = November 5, 2019\n}}</ref>\n\n''[[Autumn Aurora]]'' followed on November 28, 2004 (see [[2004 in music]]). While continuing its predecessor's general mood and atmosphere, it distinguishes itself by incorporating [[synthesizer]]s and other such [[keyboard instrument]]s. ''Autumn Aurora'' has frequently been cited as Drudkh's finest album, although some fans give the nod to the later ''[[Blood in Our Wells]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} This record had a strong critical success: for example, it was chosen the best album of the year by [[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] web-zine.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/rants/6-714_best_albums_of_2004.aspx\n| title = CoC : Rant : Best Albums of 2004\n| work = [[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]]\n| date = February 28, 2005\n| accessdate = October 11, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Autumn Aurora'', Amorth (drums, keyboards) joined the band and replaced Yuriy.\n\n''[[The Swan Road]]'' (''\u041b\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0448\u043b\u044f\u0445''), released on March 14, 2005 (see [[2005 in music]]), marked a departure in a number of ways. It was well reviewed and is the first Drudkh album to have Ukrainian lyrics, all of which are adapted or taken directly from the work ''[[Haydamaky (poem)|The Haidamakas]]'' ([[1841 in literature|1841]]) by [[Taras Shevchenko]], narrating about the [[Koliyivshchyna|Ukrainian anti-Polish uprising]] of 1768.<ref>{{cite web\n| author = Polarstern, Smierc\n| date = 2010\n| url = http://politosophia.org/page/drudkh-s-anthology-of-time.html \n| title = Drudkh\u2019s anthology of time\n| work = Politosophia\n}}</ref> Its CD booklet included prints of Shevchenko's notebooks, which many non-Ukrainian-speaking fans mistook for song lyrics. The addition of Shevchenko's poetry can also be said to have given Drudkh's music a more pronounced [[Ukrainian nationalism|nationalistic leaning]] (a move continued on the next album). The music's atmosphere is also significantly more urgent, with the drums pushed to the forefront of the mix and a vastly increased use of [[blast beat]]s.\n\nOn March 23, 2006 (see [[2006 in music]]), Drudkh released ''Blood in Our Wells'' (''\u041a\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044f\u0445''), once again through Supernal Music. On this album, poetry from four nineteenth- and twentieth-century Ukrainian poets (including [[Oleksandr Oles]] and [[Lina Kostenko]]) serves as lyrical material, and the album itself was dedicated to [[Stepan Bandera]], leader of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]]. Musically, the album adds [[progressive rock]] influences and an increased use of traditional [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[guitar solo|soloing]] into the mix, while retaining the band's tradition of blending black metal and Ukrainian folk music. In part because several tracks sample the Ukrainian poetic film ''[[Mamay (film)|Mamay]]'' (2003), the album is considered more cinematic than its predecessors. Many fans have cited this album as the band's best work to date. It was Drudkh's first record to appear in the ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' Top 40 year list, placing at number 35.<ref name=rocklistmusic.co.uk>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/terroris.htm\n| title = Terrorizer Magazine\n| work = Rocklist.net\n| accessdate = October 11, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter the release of ''Blood in Our Wells'', Amorth was exiled from the band and new members Krechet (bass) and Vlad (drums) joined.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOn October 19, 2006, Drudkh released ''[[Songs of Grief and Solitude]]'' (''\u041f\u0456\u0441\u043d\u0456 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438 \u0456 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0456\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456''). This release is composed of folk music, with much of the music containing melodic elements from previous Drudkh compositions (for example, \"The Cranes Will Never Return Here\" is based on a riff from \"Solitude\" on ''Blood in Our Wells'', and \"Archaic Dance\" is based on a riff from \"Glare of 1768\" on ''The Swan Road''). It is entirely instrumental, with barely any drumming, and prominently features wind instruments. The album received mixed reviews, with some fans criticising the band for reusing old material, and others praising the band's radical reconstruction of its own sound.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOn April 16, 2007 (see [[2007 in music]]), Supernal Music released Drudkh's ''[[Anti-Urban]]'', a 45-RPM 10&nbsp;inch coloured vinyl limited to 999 copies containing exclusive tracks available only to Supernal Music customers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} [[Season of Mist]] later re-released it as a [[mini CD]] in 2009 as part of the deluxe box-set edition of ''[[Microcosmos (Drudkh album)|Microcosmos]]'', and it was also included on the band's collection ''Eastern Frontier in Flames''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe band's next release, a full-length black metal album titled ''[[Estrangement (album)|Estrangement]]'' (''\u0412i\u0434\u0447\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043di\u0441\u0442\u044c''), was released on August 25, 2007 as a deluxe edition.<ref name=supernalmusic>{{cite web\n| url = http://supernalmusic.livejournal.com/37340.html\n| title = Drudkh (Ukr): 'Estrangement' CD Deluxe\n| work = Supernal Music\n| date = August 30, 2007\n| accessdate = October 11, 2012\n}}</ref> The album, which had the working title ''River of Tears'', had been rumored to have a \"[[Burzum]]ic\" feel before its release, and in some ways this was borne out by the album's release; its songs were in many ways significantly more minimalistic than those on ''Blood in Our Wells''. Its lyrics were based completely on the 1931-1932 works of Ukrainian poet Oleh Olzhych. Reception to the album has been largely positive, with many fans hailing it as a return to the band's roots or praising the band's musicianship demonstrated in the album's many solos.

All four also belonged to [[Blood of Kingu]] until it was disbanded. Their lyrics embrace [[Slavic mythology]]. Many of the band's lyrics are derived from the works of nineteenth- and twentieth-century Ukrainian poets ([[Oleksandr Oles]], [[Oleh Olzhych]], [[Maik Yohansen]] etc.) and especially [[Taras Shevchenko]].\n\nDrudkh have been particularly secretive throughout the course of their career, even for a black metal band, giving no interviews and not releasing the lyrics to several of their albums. The band are considered a [[National Socialist black metal]] band.<ref name=\"semenyaka\">{{cite web|url=http://politosophia.org/page/when-the-gods-hear-the-call.html|title=When the gods hear the call: the conservative-revolutionary potential of Black Metal Art|last1=Semenyaka|first1=Olena|date=January 3, 2013|publisher=Politosophia|accessdate=July 13, 2016}}</ref> They have also disavowed political interpretations of their music specifically and \"extreme political views\" more generally, therefore declaring themselves a non-political band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Drudkh/9344|title=Drudkh - Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|website=Metal-archives.com|accessdate=2020-03-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/news/7991/Drudkh-Signs-To-Season-Of-Mist/|title=Drudkh Signs To Season Of Mist &#124; Sputnikmusic|website=Sputnikmusic.com|accessdate=2020-03-13}}</ref> From their conception until 2009, Drudkh did not have any official website, but in May 2009, [[Season of Mist]] launched an official [[Myspace]], operated by the label rather than the band.\n\n==History==\nDrudkh have released ten albums, two EPs, three splits, and one anthology collecting material from the band's early splits and EPs. Their early releases were released on CD through the [[England|English]] [[extreme metal]] record label [[Supernal Music]], with the exception of the EP (which was a vinyl release), and, again with the exception of the EP, on vinyl through two [[Finland|Finnish]] black metal labels, [[Northern Heritage]] and Faustian Distribution. More recent release have been through Season of Mist, which has also issued remastered versions of the band's earlier albums as [[digipak]]s.\n\nThe band's first album, ''[[Forgotten Legends]]'', was released on August 18, 2003. The album establishes the band's trademark epic sound; its three tracks and one [[conclusion (music)|outro]] span nearly forty minutes, with the longest track, \"False Dawn\", nearing the sixteen-minute mark. ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' included ''Forgotten Legends'' in its Top 40 Black Metal albums list.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.ign.com/boards/threads/terrorizer-magazines-top-40-black-metal-albums.186480191/\n| title = Terrorizer Magazine's Top 40 Black Metal Albums\n| work = IGN Boards\n| date = October 30, 2009\n| accessdate = November 5, 2019\n}}</ref>\n\n''[[Autumn Aurora]]'' followed on November 28, 2004 (see [[2004 in music]]). While continuing its predecessor's general mood and atmosphere, it distinguishes itself by incorporating [[synthesizer]]s and other such [[keyboard instrument]]s. ''Autumn Aurora'' has frequently been cited as Drudkh's finest album, although some fans give the nod to the later ''[[Blood in Our Wells]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} This record had a strong critical success: for example, it was chosen the best album of the year by [[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] web-zine.<ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/rants/6-714_best_albums_of_2004.aspx\n| title = CoC : Rant : Best Albums of 2004\n| work = [[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]]\n| date = February 28, 2005\n| accessdate = October 11, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''Autumn Aurora'', Amorth (drums, keyboards) joined the band and replaced Yuriy.\n\n''[[The Swan Road]]'' (''\u041b\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0448\u043b\u044f\u0445''), released on March 14, 2005 (see [[2005 in music]]), marked a departure in a number of ways. It was well reviewed and is the first Drudkh album to have Ukrainian lyrics, all of which are adapted or taken directly from the work ''[[Haydamaky (poem)|The Haidamakas]]'' ([[1841 in literature|1841]]) by [[Taras Shevchenko]], narrating about the [[Koliyivshchyna|Ukrainian anti-Polish uprising]] of 1768.<ref>{{cite web\n| author = Polarstern, Smierc\n| date = 2010\n| url = http://politosophia.org/page/drudkh-s-anthology-of-time.html \n| title = Drudkh\u2019s anthology of time\n| work = Politosophia\n}}</ref> Its CD booklet included prints of Shevchenko's notebooks, which many non-Ukrainian-speaking fans mistook for song lyrics. The addition of Shevchenko's poetry can also be said to have given Drudkh's music a more pronounced [[Ukrainian nationalism|nationalistic leaning]] (a move continued on the next album). The music's atmosphere is also significantly more urgent, with the drums pushed to the forefront of the mix and a vastly increased use of [[blast beat]]s.\n\nOn March 23, 2006 (see [[2006 in music]]), Drudkh released ''Blood in Our Wells'' (''\u041a\u0440\u043e\u0432 \u0443 \u043d\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0445 \u043a\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044f\u0445''), once again through Supernal Music. On this album, poetry from four nineteenth- and twentieth-century Ukrainian poets (including [[Oleksandr Oles]] and [[Lina Kostenko]]) serves as lyrical material, and the album itself was dedicated to [[Stepan Bandera]], leader of the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists]]. Musically, the album adds [[progressive rock]] influences and an increased use of traditional [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[guitar solo|soloing]] into the mix, while retaining the band's tradition of blending black metal and Ukrainian folk music. In part because several tracks sample the Ukrainian poetic film ''[[Mamay (film)|Mamay]]'' (2003), the album is considered more cinematic than its predecessors. Many fans have cited this album as the band's best work to date. It was Drudkh's first record to appear in the ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' Top 40 year list, placing at number 35.<ref name=rocklistmusic.co.uk>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/terroris.htm\n| title = Terrorizer Magazine\n| work = Rocklist.net\n| accessdate = October 11, 2012\n}}</ref>\n\nAfter the release of ''Blood in Our Wells'', Amorth was exiled from the band and new members Krechet (bass) and Vlad (drums) joined.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOn October 19, 2006, Drudkh released ''[[Songs of Grief and Solitude]]'' (''\u041f\u0456\u0441\u043d\u0456 \u0441\u043a\u043e\u0440\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438 \u0456 \u0441\u0430\u043c\u0456\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0456''). This release is composed of folk music, with much of the music containing melodic elements from previous Drudkh compositions (for example, \"The Cranes Will Never Return Here\" is based on a riff from \"Solitude\" on ''Blood in Our Wells'', and \"Archaic Dance\" is based on a riff from \"Glare of 1768\" on ''The Swan Road''). It is entirely instrumental, with barely any drumming, and prominently features wind instruments. The album received mixed reviews, with some fans criticising the band for reusing old material, and others praising the band's radical reconstruction of its own sound.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nOn April 16, 2007 (see [[2007 in music]]), Supernal Music released Drudkh's ''[[Anti-Urban]]'', a 45-RPM 10&nbsp;inch coloured vinyl limited to 999 copies containing exclusive tracks available only to Supernal Music customers.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} [[Season of Mist]] later re-released it as a [[mini CD]] in 2009 as part of the deluxe box-set edition of ''[[Microcosmos (Drudkh album)|Microcosmos]]'', and it was also included on the band's collection ''Eastern Frontier in Flames''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nThe band's next release, a full-length black metal album titled ''[[Estrangement (album)|Estrangement]]'' (''\u0412i\u0434\u0447\u0443\u0436\u0435\u043di\u0441\u0442\u044c''), was released on August 25, 2007 as a deluxe edition.<ref name=supernalmusic>{{cite web\n| url = http://supernalmusic.livejournal.com/37340.html\n| title = Drudkh (Ukr): 'Estrangement' CD Deluxe\n| work = Supernal Music\n| date = August 30, 2007\n| accessdate = October 11, 2012\n}}</ref> The album, which had the working title ''River of Tears'', had been rumored to have a \"[[Burzum]]ic\" feel before its release, and in some ways this was borne out by the album's release; its songs were in many ways significantly more minimalistic than those on ''Blood in Our Wells''. Its lyrics were based completely on the 1931-1932 works of Ukrainian poet Oleh Olzhych. Reception to the album has been largely positive, with many fans hailing it as a return to the band's roots or praising the band's musicianship demonstrated in the album's many solos. Notably, the album also featured the band's first prominent use of blast beats since ''The Swan Road''. A spoken introduction in the first track is taken from the 1995 Ukrainian feature film ''{{ill|Assassination.

He has been mostly voiced by [[Frank Welker]] since the character's inception in 1969.\n\n==Character description==\nIn most series, Fred wears a white and/or blue shirt and blue jeans. In the original series, Fred wears an orange [[ascot tie]] with a blue shirt and white sweater. In the 1990s direct-to-video movies, Fred generally wears a light blue shirt sometimes with a jacket. In the 2002 series ''[[What's New, Scooby-Doo?]]'', Fred's outfit was given an update, with the removal of his orange ascot and two blue stripes added to his sleeves. He is often shown constructing various [[Rube Goldberg machine|Rube Goldberg traps]] for villains, which Scooby-Doo or Shaggy would often set off by mistake, causing the villain to be captured in another way. Fred usually takes the lead in solving mysteries. When searching for clues, Fred and [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]] usually go together with [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]] coming along, but sometimes Fred and Daphne would pair off, leaving Velma to go with Shaggy and Scooby. Although generally a very nice and handsome guy, Fred can be bossy at times and will force Shaggy and Scooby to hang around until the mystery is solved.\n\nAccording to ''[[Scooby-Doo: Behind the Scenes]]'', his boyhood nickname was \"Pickle\". He was voted \"Best Looking\" in school and was once part of a performance troupe before he devoted himself to solving mysteries. With his dramatic studies, Fred is an expert of getting into the mind of the villains he and his friends face. He sings songs from [[Show Boat]] to his friends whenever feel exceptionally scared; Daphne claims it soothes them. Fred one day hopes to become a mystery writer where he can put all of his talents to the fullest.\n\nIn ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'', Fred was depicted as being somewhat less intelligent and was often believing in crazy conspiracy theories and legends such as [[Bigfoot]] and [[mole people]] and liked reading a Coolsville-based magazine called ''The National Exaggerator'' who his uncle, Eddie Jones, eventually bought. In each episode, Fred would (often incorrectly) blame the crime on the neighborhood bully, [[List of Scooby-Doo characters#Red Herring|Red Herring]] (a play on the idiom [[red herring]]). This more ditsy and scatterbrained version of Fred was also carried over to ''What's New, Scooby-Doo?'' but without his supernatural beliefs. In this teenage version, he is shown to have many interests (obsessions for traps, martial arts, wrestling, and weightlifting).\n\n===Development===\nFred Jones was inspired by the titular character of the late 1950s/early 1960s American sitcom ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]'', as played by [[Dwayne Hickman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://povonline.com/2002/News060902.htm |author=[[Mark Evanier]] |date=July 10, 2002 |title=News from Me |publisher=Povonline.com |accessdate=July 16, 2013 |quote=\"Fred was based on Dobie, Velma on Zelda, Daphne on Thalia and Shaggy on [[Maynard G.

He has been mostly voiced by [[Frank Welker]] since the character's inception in 1969.\n\n==Character description==\nIn most series, Fred wears a white and/or blue shirt and blue jeans. In the original series, Fred wears an orange [[ascot tie]] with a blue shirt and white sweater. In the 1990s direct-to-video movies, Fred generally wears a light blue shirt sometimes with a jacket. In the 2002 series ''[[What's New, Scooby-Doo?]]'', Fred's outfit was given an update, with the removal of his orange ascot and two blue stripes added to his sleeves. He is often shown constructing various [[Rube Goldberg machine|Rube Goldberg traps]] for villains, which Scooby-Doo or Shaggy would often set off by mistake, causing the villain to be captured in another way. Fred usually takes the lead in solving mysteries. When searching for clues, Fred and [[Daphne Blake|Daphne]] usually go together with [[Velma Dinkley|Velma]] coming along, but sometimes Fred and Daphne would pair off, leaving Velma to go with Shaggy and Scooby. Although generally a very nice and handsome guy, Fred can be bossy at times and will force Shaggy and Scooby to hang around until the mystery is solved.\n\nAccording to ''[[Scooby-Doo: Behind the Scenes]]'', his boyhood nickname was \"Pickle\". He was voted \"Best Looking\" in school and was once part of a performance troupe before he devoted himself to solving mysteries. With his dramatic studies, Fred is an expert of getting into the mind of the villains he and his friends face. He sings songs from [[Show Boat]] to his friends whenever feel exceptionally scared; Daphne claims it soothes them. Fred one day hopes to become a mystery writer where he can put all of his talents to the fullest.\n\nIn ''[[A Pup Named Scooby-Doo]]'', Fred was depicted as being somewhat less intelligent and was often believing in crazy conspiracy theories and legends such as [[Bigfoot]] and [[mole people]] and liked reading a Coolsville-based magazine called ''The National Exaggerator'' who his uncle, Eddie Jones, eventually bought. In each episode, Fred would (often incorrectly) blame the crime on the neighborhood bully, [[List of Scooby-Doo characters#Red Herring|Red Herring]] (a play on the idiom [[red herring]]). This more ditsy and scatterbrained version of Fred was also carried over to ''What's New, Scooby-Doo?'' but without his supernatural beliefs. In this teenage version, he is shown to have many interests (obsessions for traps, martial arts, wrestling, and weightlifting).\n\n===Development===\nFred Jones was inspired by the titular character of the late 1950s/early 1960s American sitcom ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]'', as played by [[Dwayne Hickman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://povonline.com/2002/News060902.htm |author=[[Mark Evanier]] |date=July 10, 2002 |title=News from Me |publisher=Povonline.com |accessdate=July 16, 2013 |quote=\"Fred was based on Dobie, Velma on Zelda, Daphne on Thalia and Shaggy on [[Maynard G.

DNA transposons insert themselves into different genomic locations without copying themselves that can cause harmful [[mutations]] (see [[horizontal gene transfer]]). Hence retrotransposons can be thought of as replicative, whereas DNA transposons are non-replicative. Due to their replicative nature, retrotransposons can increase eukaryotic genome size quickly and survive in eukaryotic genomes permanently. It is thought that staying in eukaryotic genomes for such long periods gave rise to special [[Insertion_(genetics)|insertion]] methods that do not affect eukaryotic gene function drastically. <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Finnegan DJ | title = Retrotransposons | journal = Cell Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 11 | pages = R432\u2013R437 | date = June 2012 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.04.025 | pmid = 22677280 }}</ref>\n\n==LTR retrotransposons==\n{{Main article |LTR retrotransposon}}\n===Structure and function===\nLong strands of [[Direct repeat|repetitive DNA]] can be found at each end of a LTR retrotransposon. These are termed [[long terminal repeat|long terminal repeats]] (LTR) that are each a few hundred base pairs long, hence retrotransposons with LTRs have the name long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon.\nLTR retrotransposons are over 5 kilobases long. Between the long terminal repeats there are genes that can be transcribed equivalent to retrovirus genes [[Group specific antigen|gag]] and [[Pol_(HIV)|pol]]. These genes overlap so they encode a protease that processes the resulting transcript into functional gene products. Gag gene products associate with other retrotransposon transcripts to form virus-like particles. Pol gene products include enzymes reverse transcriptase, [[integrase]] and [[ribonuclease]] H domains. Reverse transcriptase carries out reverse transcription of retrotransposon DNA. Integrase \u2018integrates\u2019 retrotransposon DNA into eukaryotic genome DNA. Ribonuclease cleaves phosphodiester bonds between RNA nucleotides. \n\n===Synthesis and transposition===\nLTR retrotransposons encode transcripts with tRNA binding sites so that they can undergo reverse transcription. The tRNA-bound RNA transcript binds to a piece of genomic RNA. Template strand of retrotransposon DNA can hence be synthesised. Ribonuclease H domains degrade eukaryotic genomic RNA to give adenine- and guanine-rich DNA sequences that flag where the complementary noncoding strand has to be synthesised. Integrase then \u2018integrates\u2019 the retrotransposon into eukaryotic DNA using the hydroxyl group at the start of retrotransposon DNA. This results in a retrotransposon flagged by long terminal repeats at its ends. Because the retrotransposon contains eukaryotic genome information it can insert copies of itself into other genomic locations within a eukaryotic cell.\n\n===Endogenous retrovirus===\n{{Main article |Endogenous retrovirus}}\n[[File:LINE1s and SINEs.png|thumb|400x400px|Genetic structure of murine LINE1 and SINEs.

When the retroviral DNA is integrated into the host genome they evolve into endogenous retroviruses that influence eukaryotic genomes. So many endogenous retroviruses have inserted themselves into eukaryotic genomes that they allow insight into biology between viral-host interactions and the role of retrotransposons in evolution and disease.\nMany retrotransposons share features with endogenous retroviruses, the property of recognising and fusing with the host genome. However, there is a key difference between retroviruses and retrotransposons, which is indicated by the env gene. Although similar to the gene carrying out the same function in retroviruses, the env gene is used to determine whether the gene is retroviral or retrotransposon. If the gene is retroviral it can evolve from a retrotransposon into a retrovirus. They differ by the order of sequences in pol genes. Env genes are found in LTR retrotransposon types Ty1-copia ([[Pseudoviridae]]), Ty3-gypsy ([[Metaviridae]]) and BEL/Pao. <ref name=\"Copland\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Copeland CS, Mann VH, Morales ME, Kalinna BH, Brindley PJ | title = The Sinbad retrotransposon from the genome of the human blood fluke, Schistosoma mansoni, and the distribution of related Pao-like elements | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 1 | pages = 20 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15725362 | pmc = 554778 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-5-20 }}</ref><ref name=\"wicker\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Wicker T, Sabot F, Hua-Van A, Bennetzen JL, Capy P, Chalhoub B, Flavell A, Leroy P, Morgante M, Panaud O, Paux E, SanMiguel P, Schulman AH | title = A unified classification system for eukaryotic transposable elements | journal = Nature Reviews.

SVA elements are the exception between the two as they share similarities with both LINEs and SINEs, containing Alu elements and different numbers of the same repeat. SVAs are shorter than LINEs but longer than SINEs. \n\nWhile historically viewed as \"junk DNA\", research suggests in some cases, both LINEs and SINEs were incorporated into novel genes so as to evolve new functionality.<ref name=\"Santangelo\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Santangelo AM, de Souza FS, Franchini LF, Bumaschny VF, Low MJ, Rubinstein M | title = Ancient exaptation of a CORE-SINE retroposon into a highly conserved mammalian neuronal enhancer of the proopiomelanocortin gene | journal = PLOS Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = 1813\u201326 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17922573 | pmc = 2000970 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pgen.0030166 }}</ref>\n\n===LINEs===\n{{Main article | Long interspersed nuclear element}}\n\nWhen a LINE is transcribed, the transcript contains an RNA polymerase II promoter that ensures LINEs can be copied into whichever location it decides to insert itself into.

This transcript is the RNA transposition intermediate.  \n\nThe RNA transposition intermediate moves from the nucleus into the cytoplasm for translation. This gives the two coding regions of a LINE that in turn binds back to the RNA it is transcribed from. The LINE RNA then moves back into the nucleus to insert into the eukaryotic genome. \n\nLINEs insert themselves into regions of the eukaryotic genome that are rich in bases AT. At AT regions LINE uses its nuclease to cut one strand of the eukaryotic double-stranded DNA. The adenine-rich sequence in LINE transcript base pairs with the cut strand to flag where the LINE will be inserted with hydroxyl groups.

Thus, providing  support for the fundamental \u201cmaster gene\u201d model of RE proliferation.\n\n==Role in human disease==\nRetrotransposons ensure they are not lost by chance by occurring only in cell genetics that can be passed on from one generation to the next from parent gametes. However, LINEs can transpose into the human embryo cells that eventually develop into the nervous system, raising the question whether this LINE retrotransposition affects brain function. LINE retrotransposition is also a feature of several cancers, but it is unclear whether retrotransposition itself causes cancer instead of just a symptom.\nUncontrolled retrotransposition is bad for both the host organism and retrotransposons themselves so they have to be regulated. Retrotransposons are regulated by [[RNA interference]]. RNA interference is carried out by a bunch of short [[Non-coding_RNA|non-coding RNAs]]. The short non-coding RNA interacts with protein Argonaute to degrade retrotransposon transcripts and change their DNA histone structure to reduce their transcription.\n\n==Role in evolution==\nLTR retrotransposons came about later than non-LTR retrotransposons, possibly from an ancestral non-LTR retrotransposon acquiring an integrase from a DNA transposon. Retroviruses gained additional properties to their virus envelopes by taking the relevant genes from other viruses using the power of LTR retrotransposon.\n\nDue to their retrotransposition mechanism, retrotransposons amplify in number quickly, composing 40% of the human genome. The insertion rates for LINE1, Alu and SVA elements are 1/200 - 1/20, 1/20 and 1/900 respectively. The LINE1 insertion rates have varied a lot over the past 35 million years, so they indicate points in genome evolution. \n\nNotably a large number of 100 kilobases in the maize genome show variety due to the presence or absence of retrotransposons. However since maize is unusually genetically compared to other plants it cannot be used to predict retrotransposition in other plants.\n\nMutations caused by retrotransposons include:\n* Gene inactivation\n* Changing gene regulation\n* Changing gene products\n* Acting as DNA repair sites\n==Role in biotechnology==\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Transposon]]\n* [[Paleogenetics]]\n* [[Paleovirology]]\n* [[Insertion sequences]]\n* [[Copy-number variation]]\n* [[Genomic organization]]\n* [[Interspersed repeat]]\n* [[Retrotransposon marker]]s, a powerful method of reconstructing phylogenies.\n* [[RetrOryza]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Repeated sequence}}\n\n[[Category:Mobile genetic elements]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Retrotransposons.png|right|Simplified representation of the life cycle of a retrotransposon|440px]]\n\n'''Retrotransposons''' (also called '''Class I transposable elements''' or '''transposons via RNA intermediates''') are a type of [[Gene|genetic]] component that copy and paste themselves into different genomic locations ([[transposon]]) by converting RNA back into DNA through the process [[reverse transcription]] using an RNA transposition intermediate.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Dombroski BA, Feng Q, Mathias SL, Sassaman DM, Scott AF, Kazazian HH, Boeke JD | title = An in vivo assay for the reverse transcriptase of human retrotransposon L1 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae | journal = Molecular and Cellular Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 7 | pages = 4485\u201392 | date = July 1994 | pmid = 7516468 | pmc = 358820 | doi = 10.1128/mcb.14.7.4485 }}</ref> \n\nThrough reverse transcription retrotransposons amplify themselves quickly to become abundant in eukaryotic genomes such as [[maize]] (49-78%) <ref name=\"SanMiguelandBennetzen\">{{cite journal |vauthors=SanMiguel P, Bennetzen JL |title=Evidence that a recent increase in maize genome size was caused by the massive amplification of intergene retrotranposons |journal=Annals of Botany |volume=82 |issue=Suppl A |pages=37\u201344 |year=1998 |url=http://aob.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/82/suppl_1/37.pdf |doi=10.1006/anbo.1998.0746}}</ref>and humans (42%).<ref name=\"Landeretal\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lander ES, Linton LM, Birren B, Nusbaum C, Zody MC, Baldwin J, etal | title = Initial sequencing and analysis of the human genome | journal = Nature | volume = 409 | issue = 6822 | pages = 860\u2013921 | date = February 2001 | pmid = 11237011 | doi = 10.1038/35057062 }}</ref> They are only present in eukaryotes but share features with [[retrovirus|retroviruses]] such as [[HIV]].\n\nThere are two main types of retrotransposon, LTR and non-LTRs.

DNA transposons insert themselves into different genomic locations without copying themselves that can cause harmful [[mutations]] (see [[horizontal gene transfer]]). Hence retrotransposons can be thought of as replicative, whereas DNA transposons are non-replicative. Due to their replicative nature, retrotransposons can increase eukaryotic genome size quickly and survive in eukaryotic genomes permanently. It is thought that staying in eukaryotic genomes for such long periods gave rise to special [[Insertion_(genetics)|insertion]] methods that do not affect eukaryotic gene function drastically. <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Finnegan DJ | title = Retrotransposons | journal = Cell Current Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 11 | pages = R432\u2013R437 | date = June 2012 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2012.04.025 | pmid = 22677280 }}</ref>\n\n==LTR retrotransposons==\n{{Main article |LTR retrotransposon}}\n===Structure and function===\nLong strands of [[Direct repeat|repetitive DNA]] can be found at each end of a LTR retrotransposon. These are termed [[long terminal repeat|long terminal repeats]] (LTR) that are each a few hundred base pairs long, hence retrotransposons with LTRs have the name long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon.\nLTR retrotransposons are over 5 kilobases long. Between the long terminal repeats there are genes that can be transcribed equivalent to retrovirus genes [[Group specific antigen|gag]] and [[Pol_(HIV)|pol]]. These genes overlap so they encode a protease that processes the resulting transcript into functional gene products. Gag gene products associate with other retrotransposon transcripts to form virus-like particles. Pol gene products include enzymes reverse transcriptase, [[integrase]] and [[ribonuclease]] H domains. Reverse transcriptase carries out reverse transcription of retrotransposon DNA. Integrase \u2018integrates\u2019 retrotransposon DNA into eukaryotic genome DNA. Ribonuclease cleaves phosphodiester bonds between RNA nucleotides. \n\n===Synthesis and transposition===\nLTR retrotransposons encode transcripts with tRNA binding sites so that they can undergo reverse transcription. The tRNA-bound RNA transcript binds to a piece of genomic RNA. Template strand of retrotransposon DNA can hence be synthesised. Ribonuclease H domains degrade eukaryotic genomic RNA to give adenine- and guanine-rich DNA sequences that flag where the complementary noncoding strand has to be synthesised. Integrase then \u2018integrates\u2019 the retrotransposon into eukaryotic DNA using the hydroxyl group at the start of retrotransposon DNA. This results in a retrotransposon flagged by long terminal repeats at its ends. Because the retrotransposon contains eukaryotic genome information it can insert copies of itself into other genomic locations within a eukaryotic cell.\n\n===Endogenous retrovirus===\n{{Main article |Endogenous retrovirus}}\n[[File:LINE1s and SINEs.png|thumb|400x400px|Genetic structure of murine LINE1 and SINEs.

When the retroviral DNA is integrated into the host genome they evolve into endogenous retroviruses that influence eukaryotic genomes. So many endogenous retroviruses have inserted themselves into eukaryotic genomes that they allow insight into biology between viral-host interactions and the role of retrotransposons in evolution and disease.\nMany retrotransposons share features with endogenous retroviruses, the property of recognising and fusing with the host genome. However, there is a key difference between retroviruses and retrotransposons, which is indicated by the env gene. Although similar to the gene carrying out the same function in retroviruses, the env gene is used to determine whether the gene is retroviral or retrotransposon. If the gene is retroviral it can evolve from a retrotransposon into a retrovirus. They differ by the order of sequences in pol genes. Env genes are found in LTR retrotransposon types Ty1-copia ([[Pseudoviridae]]), Ty3-gypsy ([[Metaviridae]]) and BEL/Pao. They encode glycoproteins on the retrovirus envelope needed for entry into the host cell. Retroviruses can move between cells whereas LTR retrotransposons can only move themselves into the genome of the same cell. <ref name=\"LTR retrotransposon diversity\">{{Cite journal|title=The diversity of LTR retrotransposons |journal=Genome Biology|language=en|doi=10.1186/gb-2004-5-6-225|last1=Havecker|first1=Ericka, R.|year=2004}}</ref> \nMany vertebrate genes were formed from retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons.

SVA are one of the youngest transposable element in great apes genome and among the most active and polymorphic in the human population.\n\nA recent study developed a network method that reveals SVA retroelement (RE) proliferation dynamics in\nhominid genomes <ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Levy OR, Knisbacher BA, Levanon EY, Havlin SH | title = Integrating networks and comparative genomics reveals retroelement proliferation dynamics in hominid genomes | journal = Science Advances | volume = 3 | issue = 7 | date = 2017 | pages = e1701256 | pmid = 29043294| pmc = 5640379 | doi = 10.1126/sciadv.1701256 }}</ref>The method enable to track the course of SVA proliferation, identify yet unknown active communities, and detect tentative \u201cmaster REs\u201d that play key roles in SVA propagation. Thus, providing  support for the fundamental \u201cmaster gene\u201d model of RE proliferation.\n\n==Role in human disease==\nRetrotransposons ensure they are not lost by chance by occurring only in cell genetics that can be passed on from one generation to the next from parent gametes. However, LINEs can transpose into the human embryo cells that eventually develop into the nervous system, raising the question whether this LINE retrotransposition affects brain function. LINE retrotransposition is also a feature of several cancers, but it is unclear whether retrotransposition itself causes cancer instead of just a symptom.\nUncontrolled retrotransposition is bad for both the host organism and retrotransposons themselves so they have to be regulated. Retrotransposons are regulated by [[RNA interference]]. RNA interference is carried out by a bunch of short [[Non-coding_RNA|non-coding RNAs]]. The short non-coding RNA interacts with protein Argonaute to degrade retrotransposon transcripts and change their DNA histone structure to reduce their transcription.\n\n==Role in evolution==\nLTR retrotransposons came about later than non-LTR retrotransposons, possibly from an ancestral non-LTR retrotransposon acquiring an integrase from a DNA transposon. Retroviruses gained additional properties to their virus envelopes by taking the relevant genes from other viruses using the power of LTR retrotransposon.\n\nDue to their retrotransposition mechanism, retrotransposons amplify in number quickly, composing 40% of the human genome. The insertion rates for LINE1, Alu and SVA elements are 1/200 - 1/20, 1/20 and 1/900 respectively. The LINE1 insertion rates have varied a lot over the past 35 million years, so they indicate points in genome evolution. \n\nNotably a large number of 100 kilobases in the maize genome show variety due to the presence or absence of retrotransposons. However since maize is unusually genetically compared to other plants it cannot be used to predict retrotransposition in other plants.\n\nMutations caused by retrotransposons include:\n* Gene inactivation\n* Changing gene regulation\n* Changing gene products\n* Acting as DNA repair sites\n==Role in biotechnology==\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Transposon]]\n* [[Paleogenetics]]\n* [[Paleovirology]]\n* [[Insertion sequences]]\n* [[Copy-number variation]]\n* [[Genomic organization]]\n* [[Interspersed repeat]]\n* [[Retrotransposon marker]]s, a powerful method of reconstructing phylogenies.\n* [[RetrOryza]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n{{Repeated sequence}}\n\n[[Category:Mobile genetic elements]]\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n", "name_user": "Pizzanotsinkships", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEndogenous retrovirus:references", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrotransposon"}

It has specific meanings both in politics, history and in the hierarchy of the [[Eastern Churches|Eastern Christian]] churches.\n\nIn secular use, the word eparchy denotes an administrative district in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] / [[Byzantine Empire]], or in modern [[Greece]] or [[Cyprus]].\n\nIn ecclesiastical use, an eparchy is a territorial [[diocese]] governed by a [[bishop]] of one of the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern churches]], who holds the title of eparch. It is part of a [[Metropolis (religious jurisdiction)|metropolis]].  Each eparchy is divided into [[parish]]es in the same manner as a diocese of western Christendom.

As such it was used, chiefly in the eastern parts of the Empire, to designate the [[Roman province]]s. The term '''eparch''' ({{lang-el|{{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2}}}}, ''eparchos'') however, designating an eparchy's governor, was most usually used to refer to the [[praetorian prefect]]s (singular in Greek: {{lang|grc|\u1f14\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b9\u03c4\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5}}, \"eparch of the praetorium\") in charge of the Empire's [[praetorian prefecture]]s, and to the [[Eparch of Constantinople]], the city's urban prefect.\n\n====Byzantine administration====\nThe [[Dominate]]-period administrative system was retained In the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine period]] of the Empire until the 7th century. As Greek became the Empire's main administrative language, replacing Latin, in the latter 6th century even the provinces of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]], in reconquered [[Italy]], were termed ''eparchiae'' in Greek as well as in Latin.\n\nIn the latter half of the 7th century, the old provincial administration was replaced by the [[Theme (Byzantine district)|thematic system]]. Even after that however, the term ''eparchos'' remained in use until the 840s for the senior administrative official of each ''thema'', under the governing ''[[strategos]]''. Thereafter, eparchs are evident in some cases as city governors, but the most important by far amongst them was the [[Eparch of Constantinople]], whose office had wide-ranging powers and functioned continuously until the 13th century.{{sfn|Ostrogorsky|1956}}\n\n===Modern Greece and Cyprus===\n{{details|Provinces of Greece}}\nThe term ''eparchia'' was revived as one of the administrative sub-provincial units of post-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] independent [[Greece]], the country being divided into [[prefectures of Greece|''nomoi'']] (\"Prefectures\"), of which in turn some were subdivided into ''eparchies''. From 1887, the ''eparchies'' were abolished as actual administrative units, but were retained for some state services, especially finance services and education, as well as for electoral purposes. Before the [[Second World War]], there were 139 ''eparchies'', and after the war, with the addition of the [[Dodecanese]] Islands, their number grew to 147. The provinces were abolished in the mainland (but retained for the islands), in the wide-ranging administrative reform implemented in 1997 (the \"[[Kapodistrias plan]]\") and replaced by enlarged [[Municipalities and communities of Greece|municipalities]] (''demoi'').\n\nIn [[Cyprus]], the term ''eparchia'' is used to refer to the [[Districts of Cyprus]].\n\n==Church hierarchy==<!-- This section is linked from [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] -->\n{{Catholic Church hierarchy sidebar}}\nThe [[Christian Church]] (before the split into [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]]) adopted elements of political, administrative system of the late [[Roman Empire]], as introduced by the reforms of [[Diocletian]] (284\u2013305).

The [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 accepted this arrangement and orders that: \"the authority [of appointing bishops] shall belong to the metropolitan in each eparchy\" (can. iv), i.e., in each such civil eparchy (province) there shall be a metropolitan bishop who has authority over the others.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989}}\n\nSince the use of the term eparchy was originally linked to metropolitan rights, later in [[Eastern Christianity]], after a process of [[Job title inflation|title-inflation]] and multiplying the numbers of metropolitans by elevating local bishops to honorary metropolitan rank without giving them any real metropolitan powers, the use of the word \"eparchy\" was gradually modified and came to refer to [[diocese]]s of such \"metropolitan\" bishops, and later to dioceses in general.

After an initial  November 1992 preview issue, ''Animerica'''s first regular issue was released in February of 1993 with a March 1993 cover date. In 1998, ''[[Animerica Extra]]'' was launched as a separate manga anthology magazine which eventually focused specifically on ''[[Sh\u014djo manga|sh\u014djo]]'' titles. It was canceled in 2004.\n\nViz changed the magazine's format in April 2005, with the new magazine being three different free publications of the same name. One is advertising-oriented and created specially for distribution at anime and manga conventions while the other is more general in scope and with a version each for distribution through [[Waldenbooks]] and [[Borders Group|Borders]] stores. A similar version was later added for [[Best Buy]] stores. All three versions have fewer and briefer articles and a lower page count.\n\n''Animerica'' was one of the first professional anime and manga magazines released in the United States, and one of the most popular in the 1990s. In 2004, it had a circulation of 45,000 readers, but low sales and high competition from ''[[Newtype USA]]'' resulted in the essential cancellation of the original magazine and its reformatting as a free digest. 100 copies of the first issue of the free digest were sent to 1,000 Waldenbooks and Border stores.\n\n==History==\n''Animerica'' was introduced in 1992 with the release of issue 0, a preview issue, in November 1992, with the first official issue following in March 1993. With Viz's connections to [[Shogakukan]], the magazine was one of the first professional-quality anime and manga oriented magazine to be released in the United States. At the magazine's launch, it was co-edited by Seiji Horibuchi, Satoru Fujii, and Trish Ledoux.<ref name=\"WatchingReading\">{{cite book |title=Watching Anime, Reading Manga |first=Fred |last=Patten |publisher=[[Stone Bridge Press]] |isbn=1-880656-92-2 |chapter=Fifteen Years of Japanese Animation Fandom |page=43 |year=2004 }}</ref> In 1998, Viz introduced a related magazine, ''[[Animerica Extra]]'', which was its first monthly manga anthology.

In 1997, a Japanese company named Redsun began using the domain name \"animerica.com\" to host an adult oriented and ''[[hentai]]'' distribution website. Viz attempted to purchase the domain name from the company, but Redsun refused. Viz filed a lawsuit claiming the website infringed on its trademark. The court agreed that the website was causing confusion with Viz's publication, but that the confusion was primarily limited to American audiences. The court refused Viz's request that the site be shut down and its assets frozen. It did, however, require that Redsun put a disclaimer on its website and all advertising noting that it was not affiliated with the ''Animerica'' magazine nor with Viz Media and that it provide a link to Viz's existing official website for the magazine at \"www.animerica-mag.com.\"<ref>[http://www.finnegan.com/publications/updatenewsletters/pubdetail.aspx?pub=acfe4961-5e14-4f3f-88d4-2125cfc55ba5 ''Viz Communications, Inc. v.

After an initial  November 1992 preview issue, ''Animerica'''s first regular issue was released in February of 1993 with a March 1993 cover date. In 1998, ''[[Animerica Extra]]'' was launched as a separate manga anthology magazine which eventually focused specifically on ''[[Sh\u014djo manga|sh\u014djo]]'' titles. It was canceled in 2004.\n\nViz changed the magazine's format in April 2005, with the new magazine being three different free publications of the same name. One is advertising-oriented and created specially for distribution at anime and manga conventions while the other is more general in scope and with a version each for distribution through [[Waldenbooks]] and [[Borders Group|Borders]] stores. A similar version was later added for [[Best Buy]] stores. All three versions have fewer and briefer articles and a lower page count.\n\n''Animerica'' was one of the first professional anime and manga magazines released in the United States, and one of the most popular in the 1990s. In 2004, it had a circulation of 45,000 readers, but low sales and high competition from ''[[Newtype USA]]'' resulted in the essential cancellation of the original magazine and its reformatting as a free digest. 100 copies of the first issue of the free digest were sent to 1,000 Waldenbooks and Border stores.\n\n==History==\n''Animerica'' was introduced in 1992 with the release of issue 0, a preview issue, in November 1992, with the first official issue following in March 1993. With Viz's connections to [[Shogakukan]], the magazine was one of the first professional-quality anime and manga oriented magazine to be released in the United States. At the magazine's launch, it was co-edited by Seiji Horibuchi, Satoru Fujii, and Trish Ledoux.<ref name=\"WatchingReading\">{{cite book |title=Watching Anime, Reading Manga |first=Fred |last=Patten |publisher=[[Stone Bridge Press]] |isbn=1-880656-92-2 |chapter=Fifteen Years of Japanese Animation Fandom |page=43 |year=2004 }}</ref> In 1998, Viz introduced a related magazine, ''[[Animerica Extra]]'', which was its first monthly manga anthology. This secondary magazine was canceled in 2004. To celebrate the magazine's ninth anniversary, Viz launched a redesign of the magazine starting with the November 2001 issue  that included a new cover design, a new logo, and an increased focus on news, reviews, and Japanese trends.

In 1997, a Japanese company named Redsun began using the domain name \"animerica.com\" to host an adult oriented and ''[[hentai]]'' distribution website. Viz attempted to purchase the domain name from the company, but Redsun refused. Viz filed a lawsuit claiming the website infringed on its trademark. The court agreed that the website was causing confusion with Viz's publication, but that the confusion was primarily limited to American audiences. The court refused Viz's request that the site be shut down and its assets frozen. It did, however, require that Redsun put a disclaimer on its website and all advertising noting that it was not affiliated with the ''Animerica'' magazine nor with Viz Media and that it provide a link to Viz's existing official website for the magazine at \"www.animerica-mag.com.\"<ref>[http://www.finnegan.com/publications/updatenewsletters/pubdetail.aspx?pub=acfe4961-5e14-4f3f-88d4-2125cfc55ba5 ''Viz Communications, Inc. v.

She shares her scrapbook with him and confides to Carl her desire to move her \"clubhouse\"&nbsp;\u2014 an abandoned house in the neighborhood&nbsp;\u2014 to a cliff overlooking Paradise Falls.\n\nCarl and Ellie grow up, marry, and live in the restored \"clubhouse\".

They save for the trip, but repeatedly have to spend the money on more pressing day-to-day needs. They nonetheless live a happy life. After retiring from their jobs at the local zoo, Carl buys plane tickets to Paradise Falls, but Ellie suddenly falls ill and dies.\n\nYears later in the present day, Carl still lives in the house by stubbornly [[holdout (real estate)|holding out]] while the neighborhood around him is being replaced by [[skyscraper]]s. When he accidentally injures a construction worker, the court deems him a public menace and orders him to move to a [[retirement home]]. However, Carl resolves to keep his promise to Ellie by turning his house into a makeshift [[airship]], using thousands of helium balloons saved from his old job as a balloon salesman. Russell, a young \"Wilderness Explorer\" who visits Carl so he can earn his final [[scout badge|merit badge]] for \"Assisting the Elderly\", becomes an accidental stowaway.\n\nThe flying house encounters a [[Cumulonimbus cloud|cumulonimbus]] storm and ends up high above South America. The house lands on a [[tepui]] opposite Paradise Falls. Carl and Russell harness themselves to the still-buoyant house and begin to walk it across the mesa, hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate. Russell encounters a tall colorful bird whom he names \"Kevin\", who is trying to gather food for her chicks. They then meet a [[Golden Retriever]] named Dug, who wears a special collar that allows him to speak, and who vows to take the bird to his master. The next day, they encounter a [[pack (canine)|pack]] of aggressive dogs led by Alpha, a [[Dobermann|Doberman Pinscher]], and are taken to their master, who turns out to be an elderly Charles Muntz. \n\nMuntz invites Carl and Russell aboard his [[Airship|dirigible]], where he explains to them that he is still desperately searching for the giant bird he promised to bring back, which is revealed to be of Kevin's species. Russell notes the bird's similarity to Kevin and Muntz becomes hostile, thinking they are attempting to capture the bird for themselves\u2014like many other visitors he implies to have killed. Realizing that Muntz has become insane, Carl and Russell flee with Kevin and Dug, but Muntz eventually captures Kevin and starts a fire beneath Carl's house. Carl saves the house, allowing Muntz to leave with Kevin, and Russell becomes upset at Carl's selfishness. The group finally arrive at Paradise Falls and park the house, where Carl sadly looks through Ellie's childhood scrapbook, only to find that she has filled in the supposedly blank pages with photos of their happy marriage, along with a final note thanking Carl for their \"adventure\" and encouraging him to move on from her death. \n\nReinvigorated, Carl goes outside to see Russell sailing off with some balloons and a [[leaf blower]] to rescue Kevin. By throwing out his furniture and keepsakes, Carl lightens the house enough for him and Dug to follow. Russell is captured by Muntz, but Carl and Dug manage to board the dirigible, tether the house, and free Russell and Kevin. Dug saddles Alpha with the [[Elizabethan collar|\"cone of shame\"]] and unexpectedly becomes the dogs' new leader. Muntz furiously pursues them around the airship and further cripples the flying house, cornering Kevin, Dug, and Russell inside. When the three leap back onto the dirigible, Muntz leaps after them and inadvertently gets caught on some balloon lines, causing him to fall to his death. The house, having lost too many balloons to fly, descends out of sight through the clouds.\n\nCarl and Russell reunite Kevin with her chicks and fly the dirigible back home. Russell receives his \"Assisting the Elderly\" badge, and Carl presents Russell with the \"Ellie Badge\"&nbsp;\u2014 a grape soda bottle cap that Ellie gave to Carl when they first met. Carl, Russell, and Dug later sit together, eating ice cream and counting approaching cars like Russell used to do with his dad. Unbeknownst to Carl, the house has landed on the cliff beside Paradise Falls exactly where Ellie had pictured it, fulfilling Carl's promise. The end credits show snapshots of Carl, Russell, and Dug happily enjoying life together.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Ed Asner]] as Carl Fredricksen: Docter and Rivera noted Asner's television alter ego, [[Lou Grant]], had been helpful in writing for Carl because it guided them in balancing likable and unlikable aspects of the curmudgeonly character.<ref name=\"slashvid\"/> When they met Asner and presented him with a model of his character, he joked, \"I don't look anything like that.\" (The appearance of Carl is meant to resemble [[Spencer Tracy]] as he appeared in his final film, ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]''.<ref name=\"exclaim\">{{cite news|last=Keast|first=James|title=Pixar Reveals Early Look At Up|url=http://exclaim.ca/News/pixar_reveals_early_look_at_up|accessdate=November 22, 2013|newspaper=Exclaim!|date=February 6, 2009}}</ref>) They tailored his dialogue for him, with short sentences and more [[consonant]]s, which \"cemented the notion that Carl, post-Ellie, is a disgruntled bear that's been poked awake during hibernation\".<ref name=time>{{cite news|last=Corliss|first=Richard|title=Up, Up and Away: Another New High for Pixar|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1896737,00.html|accessdate=November 22, 2013|newspaper=Time|date=May 28, 2009|authorlink=Richard Corliss}}</ref> In Colombia, unexpected publicity for the film was generated due to the uncanny similarity of Carl with Colombian ex-president [[Julio C\u00e9sar Turbay Ayala]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=\u00bfA qui\u00e9n se parece? |trans-title=Who does he look like? |work=Revista Semana |language= Spanish |date=May 23, 2009 |url= http://www.semana.com/gente/articulo/a-quien-parece/103378-3 |accessdate= June 14, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Cal (''sic'') Fredericksen y Julio C\u00e9sar Turbay |trans-title=Cal Fredricksen and Julio C\u00e9sar Turbay |work=La Silla Vac\u00eda |date=June 13, 2009 |url=http://galerias.lasillavacia.com/2397/pages/Julio-C%E9sar-Turbay-%96-Cal-Fredricksen.htm |accessdate=June 14, 2009 |language=Spanish }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n** Jeremy Leary as young Carl Fredricksen\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Charles F.

The initial version featured a floating city on an alien planet populated with muppet-like creatures,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iml_slMLBUs#t=39m25s|title=PETE DOCTER - In Conversation With... - TIFF 2015|publisher=TIFF Originals|via=YouTube|date=June 19, 2015}}</ref> with two brothers vying to inherit their father's kingdom, and when the brothers fell to Earth, they encountered a tall bird who helped them understand each other. But the story just didn't seem to work properly, and Docter and Peterson realized that the most intriguing element was the isolation of the floating city. Yet the people living there would consist of a whole community, and were therefore not really isolated. So the whole city was stripped down to a single flying house with just a single occupant, where balloons replaced the magic which kept the floating city up. After that they got the idea to use an old person, and found the contrast between the elderly grumpy man and the happy balloons in Docter's drawing appealing, inspiring them to work out his backstory. The next concept introduced many of the elements that eventually made their way into the film, but had Carl and Russell landing the house on a Soviet-era spy airship camouflaged as a giant cloud rather than on a tepui. This concept was rewritten due to its similarity to another idea Pixar was developing. Another idea Docter added, then removed, was magic fountain-of-youth eggs laid by the bird, in order to explain the age discrepancy between Muntz and Carl, but they decided this subplot was too distracting, and people would forgive the minor inconsistency.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Catmull|first1=Ed|last2=Wallace|first2=Amy|author-link1=Ed Catmull|author-link2=Amy Wallace|url=https://archive.org/details/creativityincove0000catm|url-access=registration|quote=Our tenth movie, Up.|title=Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration|date=April 8, 2014|publisher=[[Random House]]|pages=[https://archive.org/details/creativityincove0000catm/page/148 148]\u201350|isbn=978-0812993011}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.no/books?id=bYJZCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA11&dq=%22Two+brothers+who+lived+in+a+mythical,+Muppet-like+world%22&hl=no&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjfhdixhZbmAhXqlosKHa_UDm0Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%22Two%20brothers%20who%20lived%20in%20a%20mythical%2C%20Muppet-like%20world%22&f=false The Art of Up]</ref> Also, the biggest single influence on Up early on was [[The Station Agent]], by Tom McCarthy.<ref>[https://books.google.no/books?id=Dny9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA120&dq=%22Muppety,+made-up+creatures+that+lived+on+a+made-up+planet%22&hl=no&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwimoLKG2vfmAhVM4KYKHYt4C8IQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%22Muppety%2C%20made-up%20creatures%20that%20lived%20on%20a%20made-up%20planet%22&f=false On Animation: The Director's Perspective, Volum 2]</ref>\n\nDocter noted the film reflects his friendships with Disney veterans [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]], [[Ollie Johnston]], and [[Joe Grant]] (who all died before the film's release and thus the film was dedicated to them).

However, they also wanted him to grow more flexible near the end of the film, transforming into an \"action hero\".\n\nA technical director worked out that to make Carl's house fly, he would require 23&nbsp;million balloons, but Docter realized that number made the balloons look like small dots. Instead, the balloons created were made to be twice Carl's size. There are 10,297&nbsp;balloons for shots of the house just flying, 20,622&nbsp;balloons for the lift-off sequence, and a varying number in other scenes.<ref name=\"notes\" />\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Up (film score)}}\n''Up'' is the third Pixar film to be scored by [[Michael Giacchino]], after ''[[The Incredibles]]'' and ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]''. What Pete Docter wanted most importantly out of the music was the emotion, so Giacchino wrote a character theme-based score that producer Jonas Rivera thought enhanced the story. At the beginning of the movie, when young Carl is in the movie theater watching a newsreel about Muntz, the first piece of music heard is \"Muntz's Theme\", which starts out as a celebratory theme, and echoes through the film when Muntz reappears 70&nbsp;years later. \"Ellie's Theme\" is first heard when she is introduced as a little kid and plays several times during the film in different versions; for instance, during the sequence where Carl lifts his house with the balloons, the theme is changed from a simple piano melody to a full orchestral arrangement. Giacchino has compared the film to opera since each character has a unique theme that [[Thematic transformation|changes]] during a particular moment in the story.<ref name=\"allm\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r1590147 |title=Up <nowiki>[Original Score]</nowiki>|publisher=Allmusic.

The film centers on an elderly widower named Carl Fredricksen ([[Ed Asner]]) and an earnest boy named Russell ([[Jordan Nagai]]). By tying thousands of balloons to his house, Carl sets out to fulfill his dream to see the wilds of [[South America]] and complete a promise made to his late wife, Ellie. The film was directed by [[Pete Docter]] and co-directed by [[Bob Peterson (filmmaker)|Bob Peterson]], who also wrote the film's screenplay, as well as the story with [[Tom McCarthy (director)|Tom McCarthy]], with music composed by [[Michael Giacchino]].\n\nDocter began working on the story in 2004, which was based on fantasies of escaping from life when it becomes too irritating. He and eleven other Pixar artists spent three days in [[Venezuela]] gathering research and inspiration. The designs of the characters were caricatured and stylized considerably, and animators were challenged with creating realistic cloth.\n\n''Up'' was Pixar's first film to be presented in [[Disney Digital 3-D]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Wloszczyna|first=Susan|title=Pixar moves on 'Up!' with its 10th movie|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/2009-05-21-pixar-main_N.htm|newspaper=USA Today|date=May 21, 2009|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}</ref> It was released on May 29, 2009, and opened the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival]], becoming the first animated and 3-D film to do so.<ref>{{cite news|last=Horn|first=John|title=Pixar's 'Up!' to open Cannes Film Festival|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/awards/2009/03/pixars-up-to-op.html|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 19, 2009|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}</ref> The film grossed over $735 million, and received universal acclaim, with critics calling it one of the best animated films of all time.<ref>https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2018/06/12/100-best-animated-movies-all-time/696107002/</ref> Asner's vocal performance and Michael Giacchino's score were praised, as was the montage of Carl and his wife Ellie growing old together.

Muntz. When Muntz is accused of fabricating the skeleton of a giant exotic bird he says he discovered at Paradise Falls, he vows not to return until he captures one alive. One day, Carl befriends an extroverted girl named Ellie, also a Muntz fan. She shares her scrapbook with him and confides to Carl her desire to move her \"clubhouse\"&nbsp;\u2014 an abandoned house in the neighborhood&nbsp;\u2014 to a cliff overlooking Paradise Falls.\n\nCarl and Ellie grow up, marry, and live in the restored \"clubhouse\". After Ellie suffers a [[miscarriage]]<ref name=\"miscarriage\">{{cite web | first = John | last = Horn | url=https://articles.latimes.com/2009/jun/07/entertainment/ca-upmontage7 | title=A heartfelt film within a film in 'Up' |work=Los Angeles Times| date=June 7, 2009 | access-date=August 10, 2015 }}</ref> and they are told they cannot have a child, the couple remembers their childhood dream of visiting Paradise Falls. They save for the trip, but repeatedly have to spend the money on more pressing day-to-day needs. They nonetheless live a happy life. After retiring from their jobs at the local zoo, Carl buys plane tickets to Paradise Falls, but Ellie suddenly falls ill and dies.\n\nYears later in the present day, Carl still lives in the house by stubbornly [[holdout (real estate)|holding out]] while the neighborhood around him is being replaced by [[skyscraper]]s. When he accidentally injures a construction worker, the court deems him a public menace and orders him to move to a [[retirement home]]. However, Carl resolves to keep his promise to Ellie by turning his house into a makeshift [[airship]], using thousands of helium balloons saved from his old job as a balloon salesman. Russell, a young \"Wilderness Explorer\" who visits Carl so he can earn his final [[scout badge|merit badge]] for \"Assisting the Elderly\", becomes an accidental stowaway.\n\nThe flying house encounters a [[Cumulonimbus cloud|cumulonimbus]] storm and ends up high above South America. The house lands on a [[tepui]] opposite Paradise Falls. Carl and Russell harness themselves to the still-buoyant house and begin to walk it across the mesa, hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate. Russell encounters a tall colorful bird whom he names \"Kevin\", who is trying to gather food for her chicks. They then meet a [[Golden Retriever]] named Dug, who wears a special collar that allows him to speak, and who vows to take the bird to his master. The next day, they encounter a [[pack (canine)|pack]] of aggressive dogs led by Alpha, a [[Dobermann|Doberman Pinscher]], and are taken to their master, who turns out to be an elderly Charles Muntz. \n\nMuntz invites Carl and Russell aboard his [[Airship|dirigible]], where he explains to them that he is still desperately searching for the giant bird he promised to bring back, which is revealed to be of Kevin's species. Russell notes the bird's similarity to Kevin and Muntz becomes hostile, thinking they are attempting to capture the bird for themselves\u2014like many other visitors he implies to have killed. Realizing that Muntz has become insane, Carl and Russell flee with Kevin and Dug, but Muntz eventually captures Kevin and starts a fire beneath Carl's house. Carl saves the house, allowing Muntz to leave with Kevin, and Russell becomes upset at Carl's selfishness. The group finally arrive at Paradise Falls and park the house, where Carl sadly looks through Ellie's childhood scrapbook, only to find that she has filled in the supposedly blank pages with photos of their happy marriage, along with a final note thanking Carl for their \"adventure\" and encouraging him to move on from her death. \n\nReinvigorated, Carl goes outside to see Russell sailing off with some balloons and a [[leaf blower]] to rescue Kevin. By throwing out his furniture and keepsakes, Carl lightens the house enough for him and Dug to follow. Russell is captured by Muntz, but Carl and Dug manage to board the dirigible, tether the house, and free Russell and Kevin. Dug saddles Alpha with the [[Elizabethan collar|\"cone of shame\"]] and unexpectedly becomes the dogs' new leader. Muntz furiously pursues them around the airship and further cripples the flying house, cornering Kevin, Dug, and Russell inside. When the three leap back onto the dirigible, Muntz leaps after them and inadvertently gets caught on some balloon lines, causing him to fall to his death. The house, having lost too many balloons to fly, descends out of sight through the clouds.\n\nCarl and Russell reunite Kevin with her chicks and fly the dirigible back home. Russell receives his \"Assisting the Elderly\" badge, and Carl presents Russell with the \"Ellie Badge\"&nbsp;\u2014 a grape soda bottle cap that Ellie gave to Carl when they first met. Carl, Russell, and Dug later sit together, eating ice cream and counting approaching cars like Russell used to do with his dad. Unbeknownst to Carl, the house has landed on the cliff beside Paradise Falls exactly where Ellie had pictured it, fulfilling Carl's promise. The end credits show snapshots of Carl, Russell, and Dug happily enjoying life together.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Ed Asner]] as Carl Fredricksen: Docter and Rivera noted Asner's television alter ego, [[Lou Grant]], had been helpful in writing for Carl because it guided them in balancing likable and unlikable aspects of the curmudgeonly character.<ref name=\"slashvid\"/> When they met Asner and presented him with a model of his character, he joked, \"I don't look anything like that.\" (The appearance of Carl is meant to resemble [[Spencer Tracy]] as he appeared in his final film, ''[[Guess Who's Coming to Dinner]]''.<ref name=\"exclaim\">{{cite news|last=Keast|first=James|title=Pixar Reveals Early Look At Up|url=http://exclaim.ca/News/pixar_reveals_early_look_at_up|accessdate=November 22, 2013|newspaper=Exclaim!|date=February 6, 2009}}</ref>) They tailored his dialogue for him, with short sentences and more [[consonant]]s, which \"cemented the notion that Carl, post-Ellie, is a disgruntled bear that's been poked awake during hibernation\".<ref name=time>{{cite news|last=Corliss|first=Richard|title=Up, Up and Away: Another New High for Pixar|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1896737,00.html|accessdate=November 22, 2013|newspaper=Time|date=May 28, 2009|authorlink=Richard Corliss}}</ref> In Colombia, unexpected publicity for the film was generated due to the uncanny similarity of Carl with Colombian ex-president [[Julio C\u00e9sar Turbay Ayala]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=\u00bfA qui\u00e9n se parece? |trans-title=Who does he look like? |work=Revista Semana |language= Spanish |date=May 23, 2009 |url= http://www.semana.com/gente/articulo/a-quien-parece/103378-3 |accessdate= June 14, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Cal (''sic'') Fredericksen y Julio C\u00e9sar Turbay |trans-title=Cal Fredricksen and Julio C\u00e9sar Turbay |work=La Silla Vac\u00eda |date=June 13, 2009 |url=http://galerias.lasillavacia.com/2397/pages/Julio-C%E9sar-Turbay-%96-Cal-Fredricksen.htm |accessdate=June 14, 2009 |language=Spanish }}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n** Jeremy Leary as young Carl Fredricksen\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Charles F.

The initial version featured a floating city on an alien planet populated with muppet-like creatures,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iml_slMLBUs#t=39m25s|title=PETE DOCTER - In Conversation With... - TIFF 2015|publisher=TIFF Originals|via=YouTube|date=June 19, 2015}}</ref> with two brothers vying to inherit their father's kingdom, and when the brothers fell to Earth, they encountered a tall bird who helped them understand each other. But the story just didn't seem to work properly, and Docter and Peterson realized that the most intriguing element was the isolation of the floating city. Yet the people living there would consist of a whole community, and were therefore not really isolated. So the whole city was stripped down to a single flying house with just a single occupant, where balloons replaced the magic which kept the floating city up. After that they got the idea to use an old person, and found the contrast between the elderly grumpy man and the happy balloons in Docter's drawing appealing, inspiring them to work out his backstory. The next concept introduced many of the elements that eventually made their way into the film, but had Carl and Russell landing the house on a Soviet-era spy airship camouflaged as a giant cloud rather than on a tepui. This concept was rewritten due to its similarity to another idea Pixar was developing. Another idea Docter added, then removed, was magic fountain-of-youth eggs laid by the bird, in order to explain the age discrepancy between Muntz and Carl, but they decided this subplot was too distracting, and people would forgive the minor inconsistency.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Catmull|first1=Ed|last2=Wallace|first2=Amy|author-link1=Ed Catmull|author-link2=Amy Wallace|url=https://archive.org/details/creativityincove0000catm|url-access=registration|quote=Our tenth movie, Up.|title=Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration|date=April 8, 2014|publisher=[[Random House]]|pages=[https://archive.org/details/creativityincove0000catm/page/148 148]\u201350|isbn=978-0812993011}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.no/books?id=bYJZCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA11&dq=%22Two+brothers+who+lived+in+a+mythical,+Muppet-like+world%22&hl=no&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjfhdixhZbmAhXqlosKHa_UDm0Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%22Two%20brothers%20who%20lived%20in%20a%20mythical%2C%20Muppet-like%20world%22&f=false The Art of Up]</ref> Also, the biggest single influence on Up early on was [[The Station Agent]], by Tom McCarthy.<ref>[https://books.google.no/books?id=Dny9DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA120&dq=%22Muppety,+made-up+creatures+that+lived+on+a+made-up+planet%22&hl=no&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwimoLKG2vfmAhVM4KYKHYt4C8IQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=%22Muppety%2C%20made-up%20creatures%20that%20lived%20on%20a%20made-up%20planet%22&f=false On Animation: The Director's Perspective, Volum 2]</ref>\n\nDocter noted the film reflects his friendships with Disney veterans [[Frank Thomas (animator)|Frank Thomas]], [[Ollie Johnston]], and [[Joe Grant]] (who all died before the film's release and thus the film was dedicated to them).

What Pete Docter wanted most importantly out of the music was the emotion, so Giacchino wrote a character theme-based score that producer Jonas Rivera thought enhanced the story. At the beginning of the movie, when young Carl is in the movie theater watching a newsreel about Muntz, the first piece of music heard is \"Muntz's Theme\", which starts out as a celebratory theme, and echoes through the film when Muntz reappears 70&nbsp;years later. \"Ellie's Theme\" is first heard when she is introduced as a little kid and plays several times during the film in different versions; for instance, during the sequence where Carl lifts his house with the balloons, the theme is changed from a simple piano melody to a full orchestral arrangement. Giacchino has compared the film to opera since each character has a unique theme that [[Thematic transformation|changes]] during a particular moment in the story.<ref name=\"allm\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/r1590147 |title=Up <nowiki>[Original Score]</nowiki>|publisher=Allmusic.

Her father ascended the throne on the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication]] of his brother [[King Edward VIII]] in 1936, from which time she was the [[heir presumptive]]. She began to undertake public duties [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|during the Second World War]], serving in the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]]. In 1947, she married [[Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], a former prince of Greece and Denmark, with whom she has four children: [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]; [[Anne, Princess Royal]]; [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]]; and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]].\n\nWhen her father died in February 1952, Elizabeth became [[head of the Commonwealth]] and [[queen regnant]] of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]], and [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]]. She has reigned as a [[constitutional monarch]] through major political changes, such as [[devolution in the United Kingdom]], Canadian [[patriation]], and the [[decolonisation of Africa]]. Between 1956 and 1992, the number of [[States headed by Elizabeth II|her realms]] varied as territories gained independence, and as realms, including South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon (renamed [[Sri Lanka]]), became republics. Her many historic visits and meetings include a [[State visit of Elizabeth II to the Republic of Ireland|state visit to the Republic of Ireland]] and visits to or from five [[pope]]s. Significant events have included her [[Coronation of Elizabeth II|coronation in 1953]] and the celebrations of her [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver]], [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden]], and [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond]] [[Jubilee]]s in 1977, 2002, and 2012, respectively. In 2017, she became the first British monarch to reach a [[Sapphire Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Sapphire Jubilee]].

Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Elizabeth]], and she was educated privately at home. Her father ascended the throne on the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication]] of his brother [[King Edward VIII]] in 1936, from which time she was the [[heir presumptive]]. She began to undertake public duties [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|during the Second World War]], serving in the [[Auxiliary Territorial Service]]. In 1947, she married [[Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]], a former prince of Greece and Denmark, with whom she has four children: [[Charles, Prince of Wales]]; [[Anne, Princess Royal]]; [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]]; and [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]].\n\nWhen her father died in February 1952, Elizabeth became [[head of the Commonwealth]] and [[queen regnant]] of seven independent Commonwealth countries: the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]], [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]], and [[Dominion of Ceylon|Ceylon]]. She has reigned as a [[constitutional monarch]] through major political changes, such as [[devolution in the United Kingdom]], Canadian [[patriation]], and the [[decolonisation of Africa]]. Between 1956 and 1992, the number of [[States headed by Elizabeth II|her realms]] varied as territories gained independence, and as realms, including South Africa, Pakistan, and Ceylon (renamed [[Sri Lanka]]), became republics. Her many historic visits and meetings include a [[State visit of Elizabeth II to the Republic of Ireland|state visit to the Republic of Ireland]] and visits to or from five [[pope]]s. Significant events have included her [[Coronation of Elizabeth II|coronation in 1953]] and the celebrations of her [[Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Silver]], [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Golden]], and [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Diamond]] [[Jubilee]]s in 1977, 2002, and 2012, respectively. In 2017, she became the first British monarch to reach a [[Sapphire Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Sapphire Jubilee]]. She is the [[List of British monarchs by longevity|longest-lived]] and [[List of monarchs in Britain by length of reign|longest-reigning British monarch]]. She is the [[List of longest-reigning monarchs|longest-serving female head of state]] in world history, and the world's [[List of oldest living state leaders|oldest living monarch]], [[List of current reigning monarchs by length of reign|longest-reigning current monarch]], and [[Lists of state leaders by age|oldest]] and [[List of current state leaders by date of assumption of office|longest-serving current head of state]].\n\nElizabeth has occasionally faced [[Republicanism in the United Kingdom|republican]] sentiments and press criticism of the [[British royal family|royal family]], in particular after the breakdown of her children's marriages, her ''[[Annus horribilis#Elizabeth II|annus horribilis]]'' in 1992, and the [[death of Diana, Princess of Wales|death in 1997]] of her former daughter-in-law [[Diana, Princess of Wales]]. However, in the United Kingdom, support for the monarchy has been and remains consistently high, as does her personal popularity.<!--e.g. Polls cited in \"Public perception and character\" section below: Ipsos MORI (2006 and 2012); Populus Ltd (2007); BBC (2007)-->\n\n== Early life ==\n[[File:Queen Elizabeth II 1929.jpg|thumb|right|upright|alt=Elizabeth as a thoughtful-looking toddler with curly, fair hair|On the [[List of covers of Time magazine (1920s)#1929|cover]] of [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']], April 1929]]\nElizabeth was born at 02:40 ([[GMT]]) on 21 April 1926, during the reign of her paternal grandfather, [[King George V]].

In 1965, however, the [[Rhodesia]]n Prime Minister, [[Ian Smith]], in opposition to moves towards majority rule, [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] while expressing \"loyalty and devotion\" to Elizabeth.

The midfield led by the inspired trio of [[Fabio Pecchia]], [[Matteo Brighi]] and [[Lamberto Zauli]] performed brilliantly all season, but Bologna's economy was not enough to keep those players at the club, and Pecchia signed for newcomers [[Calcio Como|Como]], while Zauli went to [[Serie B]] club [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo|Palermo]]. That Bologna could not retain players who could get a better pay at smaller but ambitious clubs was a worrying sign in spite of the spectacular season. It also had to sell defender [[Salvatore Fresi]] to champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], and looked set for a tougher season in [[2002-03 Serie A|2002-03]]. Fresi's 2001-02 season was included an incredible eight league goals, despite being a centre-half.\n\n==Squad==\n\n===Goalkeepers===\n* {{flagicon|ITA}} [[Gianluca Pagliuca]]\n* {{flagicon|ITA}}

1909|Bologna Football Club 1909]]''' came as close as ever to reach the [[UEFA Champions League]], when only a couple of mishaps at the end of the season stopped the dream season to come true. The midfield led by the inspired trio of [[Fabio Pecchia]], [[Matteo Brighi]] and [[Lamberto Zauli]] performed brilliantly all season, but Bologna's economy was not enough to keep those players at the club, and Pecchia signed for newcomers [[Calcio Como|Como]], while Zauli went to [[Serie B]] club [[U.S. Citt\u00e0 di Palermo|Palermo]]. That Bologna could not retain players who could get a better pay at smaller but ambitious clubs was a worrying sign in spite of the spectacular season. It also had to sell defender [[Salvatore Fresi]] to champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], and looked set for a tougher season in [[2002-03 Serie A|2002-03]]. Fresi's 2001-02 season was included an incredible eight league goals, despite being a centre-half.\n\n==Squad==\n\n===Goalkeepers===\n* {{flagicon|ITA}} [[Gianluca Pagliuca]]\n* {{flagicon|ITA}}
