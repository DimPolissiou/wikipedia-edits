The first capital was [[Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico|San Juan de los Caballeros]] (at [[San Gabriel de Yungue-Ouinge]]) from 1598 until 1610, and from 1610 onward the capital was [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San Francisco de As\u00eds]]. The naming, capital, the [[Palace of the Governors]], and [[rule of law]] were retained as the [[New Mexico Territory]], and the subsequent [[New Mexico|U.S. State of New Mexico]], became a part of the [[United States]]. The [[List of people from New Mexico|New Mexican citizenry]], primarily consisting of [[Hispanos of New Mexico|Hispano]], [[Puebloans|Pueblo]], [[Navajo]], [[Apache]], and [[Comanche]] peoples, became [[Citizenship of the United States|citizens of the United States]] as a result of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. It had 10 municipalities: [[Bernalillo]], [[Rio Arriba]], [[Rio Abajo]] (Santa Fe), [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]], [[Santa Ana Pueblo, New Mexico|Santa Ana]], [[Valencia]], [[San Miguel, New Mexico|San Miguel]], [[Socorro, New Mexico|Socorro]], [[Mora, New Mexico|Mora]] and [[Ysleta]] (actual north of [[El Paso]]).\n\n''{{lang|es|Nuevo M\u00e9xico}}'' is often incorrectly believed to have taken its name from the nation of Mexico. However, it was named by Spanish explorers who believed the area contained wealthy [[Amerindian]] cultures similar to those of the [[Aztec Empire]] (centered in the [[Valley of Mexico]]), and called the land the \"Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico\".<ref>{{cite book |first=David J. |last=Weber |title=The Spanish Frontier in North America |publisher=Yale University Press |location=[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and [[London]] |year=1992 |page=79 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Joseph P. |last=Sanchez |title=The Rio Abajo Frontier, 1540\u20131692: A History of Early Colonial New Mexico |location=Albuquerque |publisher=Museum of Albuquerque History Monograph Series |year=1987 |page=51 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |last=Stewart |first=George |authorlink=George R.

It had variably defined borders, and included sections of present-day U.S. states: western [[Texas]], southern [[Colorado]], southwestern [[Kansas]], and the [[Oklahoma]] panhandle. Actual Spanish settlements were centered at [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], and extended north to [[Taos Pueblo|Taos]] [[pueblo]] and south to [[Albuquerque]]. Except for the first decade of the province's existence, its capital was in the foothills of the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] at the ancient city of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San Francisco de As\u00eds]] ([[Santa Fe Historic District|modern day Santa Fe]]).\n\n==History==\n\n===Spanish colonial province===\n{{See also|Spanish missions in New Mexico}}\n;16th century\nThe Nuevo M\u00e9xico Province was created by [[Philip II of Spain]] and was officially settled during the 1598 expedition by [[Juan de O\u00f1ate]], governor; he established the colonial settlement San Gabriel de Los Espa\u00f1oles near [[Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo, New Mexico|Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo]]. The expedition had been authorized by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] to survey the region. Though the Spanish believed that cities of [[gold]] such as the ones of the [[Aztecs]], whom they had previously conquered, lay to the north in the unexplored territory, the major goal was to spread Catholicism. Other expeditions had taken place before O\u00f1ate's 1598 expedition. He was unable to find any riches, however. As governor, he mingled with the [[Puebloans|Pueblo]] people and was responsible for the establishment of Spanish rule in the area.\n\nO\u00f1ate served as the first governor of the Nuevo M\u00e9xico Province from 1598 to 1610. He hoped to make it a separate [[viceroy]]alty from New Spain in an original agreement made in 1595, but the terms failed when the Viceroy changed hands in 1596. After a two-year delay and lengthy vetting by the new viceroy, O\u00f1ate was finally allowed to cross the Rio Grande River into modern day Texas and New Mexico.\n\n;17th century\nMost of the Spanish [[Spanish missions in New Mexico|missions in Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] were established during the early 17th century with varying degrees of success and failure, oftentimes building directly atop ancient pueblo ruins, and in the centers of pueblos. Some pueblos were friendly to the foreigners, but after cultural differences and the banishment of local religions tensions against the Spanish rose significantly. After compounding misdeeds and overbearing taxes by the Spanish invaders, the indigenous communities rebelled in what is now referred to as the [[Pueblo Revolt]] of 1680. This rebellion saw the Spanish expelled from Nuevo M\u00e9xico for a period of 12 years and the pueblo people were able to regain lost lands. They returned to battle against the Spanish who sought restoration in 1692 of the conquered holdings. The reoccupation of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] was accomplished by [[Diego de Vargas]]. The province came under the jurisdiction of the [[Real Audiencia of Guadalajara]], with oversight by the [[Viceroy of New Spain]] at Mexico City.\n\n;18th century\nIn 1777, with the creation of the [[Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas]], the Nuevo M\u00e9xico Province was removed from the oversight of the Viceroy and placed solely in the jurisdiction of the Commandant General of the Provincias Internas.\n\n===Mexican territory===\n[[File:Mexico 1824 (equirectangular projection).png|thumb|Province of New Mexico when it belonged to Mexico in 1824]]\nThe province remained in Spanish control until [[Plan of Iguala|Mexico's declaration of independence]] in 1821. Under the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]], it became the federally administered Territory of New Mexico.\n\nThe part of the former province east of the [[Rio Grande]] was claimed by the [[Republic of Texas]] which won its independence in 1836. This claim was disputed by Mexico. In 1841, the Texans sent the [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition]], ostensibly for trade but with hopes of occupying the claimed area, but the expedition was captured by Mexican troops.<ref>Carroll, H.

The U.S. Army under [[Stephen Kearny]] occupied the territory in 1846 during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], a [[U.S. provisional government of New Mexico|provisional government]] was established, and Mexico recognized its loss to the United States in 1848 with the [[Mexican Cession]] in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]].\n\nTexas continued to claim the eastern part, but never succeeded in establishing control except in [[El Paso]]. However, in the [[Compromise of 1850]] Texas accepted $10 million in exchange for its claim to areas within and north of the present boundaries of New Mexico and the Texas panhandle.<ref>Griffin, Roger A.

The first capital was [[Espa\u00f1ola, New Mexico|San Juan de los Caballeros]] (at [[San Gabriel de Yungue-Ouinge]]) from 1598 until 1610, and from 1610 onward the capital was [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San Francisco de As\u00eds]]. The naming, capital, the [[Palace of the Governors]], and [[rule of law]] were retained as the [[New Mexico Territory]], and the subsequent [[New Mexico|U.S. State of New Mexico]], became a part of the [[United States]]. The [[List of people from New Mexico|New Mexican citizenry]], primarily consisting of [[Hispanos of New Mexico|Hispano]], [[Puebloans|Pueblo]], [[Navajo]], [[Apache]], and [[Comanche]] peoples, became [[Citizenship of the United States|citizens of the United States]] as a result of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. It had 10 municipalities: [[Bernalillo]], [[Rio Arriba]], [[Rio Abajo]] (Santa Fe), [[Taos]], [[Santa Ana]], [[Valencia]], [[San Miguel]], [[Socorro]], [[Mora]] and [[Ysleta]] (actual north of [[El Paso]]).\n\n''{{lang|es|Nuevo M\u00e9xico}}'' is often incorrectly believed to have taken its name from the nation of Mexico. However, it was named by Spanish explorers who believed the area contained wealthy [[Amerindian]] cultures similar to those of the [[Aztec Empire]] (centered in the [[Valley of Mexico]]), and called the land the \"Santa Fe de Nuevo M\u00e9xico\".<ref>{{cite book |first=David J. |last=Weber |title=The Spanish Frontier in North America |publisher=Yale University Press |location=[[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and [[London]] |year=1992 |page=79 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Joseph P. |last=Sanchez |title=The Rio Abajo Frontier, 1540\u20131692: A History of Early Colonial New Mexico |location=Albuquerque |publisher=Museum of Albuquerque History Monograph Series |year=1987 |page=51 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Names on the Land: A Historical Account of Place-Naming in the United States |last=Stewart |first=George |authorlink=George R.

It had variably defined borders, and included sections of present-day U.S. states: western [[Texas]], southern [[Colorado]], southwestern [[Kansas]], and the [[Oklahoma]] panhandle. Actual Spanish settlements were centered at [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], and extended north to [[Taos Pueblo|Taos]] [[pueblo]] and south to [[Albuquerque]]. Except for the first decade of the province's existence, its capital was in the foothills of the [[Sangre de Cristo Mountains]] at the ancient city of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|La Villa Real de la Santa Fe de San Francisco de As\u00eds]] ([[Santa Fe Historic District|modern day Santa Fe]]).\n\n==History==\n\n===Spanish colonial province===\n{{See also|Spanish missions in New Mexico}}\n;16th century\nThe Nuevo M\u00e9xico Province was created by [[Philip II of Spain]] and was officially settled during the 1598 expedition by [[Juan de O\u00f1ate]], governor; he established the colonial settlement San Gabriel de Los Espa\u00f1oles near [[Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo, New Mexico|Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo]]. The expedition had been authorized by [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] to survey the region. Though the Spanish believed that cities of [[gold]] such as the ones of the [[Aztecs]], whom they had previously conquered, lay to the north in the unexplored territory, the major goal was to spread Catholicism. Other expeditions had taken place before O\u00f1ate's 1598 expedition. He was unable to find any riches, however. As governor, he mingled with the [[Puebloans|Pueblo]] people and was responsible for the establishment of Spanish rule in the area.\n\nO\u00f1ate served as the first governor of the Nuevo M\u00e9xico Province from 1598 to 1610. He hoped to make it a separate [[viceroy]]alty from New Spain in an original agreement made in 1595, but the terms failed when the Viceroy changed hands in 1596. After a two-year delay and lengthy vetting by the new viceroy, O\u00f1ate was finally allowed to cross the Rio Grande River into modern day Texas and New Mexico.\n\n;17th century\nMost of the Spanish [[Spanish missions in New Mexico|missions in Nuevo M\u00e9xico]] were established during the early 17th century with varying degrees of success and failure, oftentimes building directly atop ancient pueblo ruins, and in the centers of pueblos. Some pueblos were friendly to the foreigners, but after cultural differences and the banishment of local religions tensions against the Spanish rose significantly. After compounding misdeeds and overbearing taxes by the Spanish invaders, the indigenous communities rebelled in what is now referred to as the [[Pueblo Revolt]] of 1680. This rebellion saw the Spanish expelled from Nuevo M\u00e9xico for a period of 12 years and the pueblo people were able to regain lost lands. They returned to battle against the Spanish who sought restoration in 1692 of the conquered holdings. The reoccupation of [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] was accomplished by [[Diego de Vargas]]. The province came under the jurisdiction of the [[Real Audiencia of Guadalajara]], with oversight by the [[Viceroy of New Spain]] at Mexico City.\n\n;18th century\nIn 1777, with the creation of the [[Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas]], the Nuevo M\u00e9xico Province was removed from the oversight of the Viceroy and placed solely in the jurisdiction of the Commandant General of the Provincias Internas.\n\n===Mexican territory===\n[[File:Mexico 1824 (equirectangular projection).png|thumb|Province of New Mexico when it belonged to Mexico in 1824]]\nThe province remained in Spanish control until [[Plan of Iguala|Mexico's declaration of independence]] in 1821. Under the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico]], it became the federally administered Territory of New Mexico.\n\nThe part of the former province east of the [[Rio Grande]] was claimed by the [[Republic of Texas]] which won its independence in 1836. This claim was disputed by Mexico. In 1841, the Texans sent the [[Texan Santa Fe Expedition]], ostensibly for trade but with hopes of occupying the claimed area, but the expedition was captured by Mexican troops.<ref>Carroll, H.

The U.S. Army under [[Stephen Kearny]] occupied the territory in 1846 during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], a [[U.S. provisional government of New Mexico|provisional government]] was established, and Mexico recognized its loss to the United States in 1848 with the [[Mexican Cession]] in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]].\n\nTexas continued to claim the eastern part, but never succeeded in establishing control except in [[El Paso]]. However, in the [[Compromise of 1850]] Texas accepted $10 million in exchange for its claim to areas within and north of the present boundaries of New Mexico and the Texas panhandle.<ref>Griffin, Roger A.

2016}}</ref>\n\n==Organisation==\n\n===Tournament format===\nCurrently, with eight teams, each team plays each other twice in a home-and-away [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format in the league phase. At the conclusion of the league stage, the top four teams will qualify for the playoffs. The top two teams from the league phase will play against each other in the first Qualifying match, with the winner going straight to the IPL final and the loser getting another chance to qualify for the IPL final by playing the second Qualifying match. Meanwhile, the third and fourth place teams from league phase play against each other in an eliminator match and the winner from that match will play the loser from the first Qualifying match. The winner of the second Qualifying match will move onto the final to play the winner of the first Qualifying match in the IPL Final match, where the winner will be crowned the Indian Premier League champions.\n\n===Player acquisition, squad composition and salaries===\nA team can acquire players through any of the three ways: the annual player auction, trading players with other teams during the trading windows, and signing replacements for unavailable players. Players sign up for the auction and also set their base price, and are bought by the franchise that bids the highest for them. Unsold players at the auction are eligible to be signed up as replacement signings. In the trading windows, a player can only be traded with his consent, with the franchise paying the difference if any between the old and new contracts. If the new contract is worth more than the older one, the difference is shared between the player and the franchise selling the player. There are generally three trading windows{{mdash}}two before the auction and one after the auction but before the start of the tournament. Players cannot be traded outside the trading windows or during the tournament, whereas replacements can be signed before or during the tournament.\n\nSome of the team composition rules (as of 2020 season) are as follows:\n*The squad strength must be between 18 and 25 players, with a maximum of 8 overseas players.\n*[[Salary cap]] of the entire squad must not exceed {{INRConvert|850|m}}.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kolkata to host IPL 2020 auction on December 19|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/kolkata-to-host-ipl-2020-auction-on-december-19/articleshow/71386522.cms|accessdate=15 October 2019}}</ref>\n*Under-19 players cannot be picked unless they have previously played [[first-class cricket|first-class]] or [[List A cricket|List A]] cricket.\n*A team can play a maximum of 4 overseas players in their playing eleven.<ref>{{cite web|title=Instances in IPL when team played less than 4 overseas players|url=https://www.crictracker.com/instances-ipl-team-played-less-4-overseas-players/|accessdate=20 February 2019|work=CricTracker|date=5 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe term of a player contract is one year, with the franchise having the option to extend the contract by one or two years. Since the 2014 season, the player contracts are denominated in the [[Indian rupee]], before which the contracts were in [[U.S. dollar]]s. Overseas players can be remunerated in the currency of the player's choice at the [[exchange rate]] on either the contract due date or the actual date of payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Player regulations for IPL 2014|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2014/content/story/703647.html|date=24 December 2013|work=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref> Prior to the 2014 season, Indian domestic players were not included in the player auction pool and could be signed up by the franchises at a discrete amount while a fixed sum of {{INRConvert|1|m}} to {{INRConvert|3|m}} would get deducted per signing from the franchise's salary purse. This received significant opposition from franchise owners who complained that richer franchises were \"luring players with under-the-table deals\" following which the IPL decided to include domestic players in the player auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2014/content/story/714115.html|title=IPL longlist features 651 uncapped players|date=30 January 2014|work=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2015 survey by Sporting Intelligence and ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'', the average IPL salary when [[pro rata|pro-rated]] is {{USD}}4.33 million per year, the second highest among all sports leagues in the world.

2016}}</ref>\n\n==Organisation==\n\n===Tournament format===\nCurrently, with eight teams, each team plays each other twice in a home-and-away [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format in the league phase. At the conclusion of the league stage, the top four teams will qualify for the playoffs. The top two teams from the league phase will play against each other in the first Qualifying match, with the winner going straight to the IPL final and the loser getting another chance to qualify for the IPL final by playing the second Qualifying match. Meanwhile, the third and fourth place teams from league phase play against each other in an eliminator match and the winner from that match will play the loser from the first Qualifying match. The winner of the second Qualifying match will move onto the final to play the winner of the first Qualifying match in the IPL Final match, where the winner will be crowned the Indian Premier League champions.\n\n===Player acquisition, squad composition and salaries===\nA team can acquire players through any of the three ways: the annual player auction, trading players with other teams during the trading windows, and signing replacements for unavailable players. Players sign up for the auction and also set their base price, and are bought by the franchise that bids the highest for them. Unsold players at the auction are eligible to be signed up as replacement signings. In the trading windows, a player can only be traded with his consent, with the franchise paying the difference if any between the old and new contracts. If the new contract is worth more than the older one, the difference is shared between the player and the franchise selling the player. There are generally three trading windows{{mdash}}two before the auction and one after the auction but before the start of the tournament. Players cannot be traded outside the trading windows or during the tournament, whereas replacements can be signed before or during the tournament.\n\nSome of the team composition rules (as of 2020 season) are as follows:\n*The squad strength must be between 18 and 25 players, with a maximum of 8 overseas players.\n*[[Salary cap]] of the entire squad must not exceed {{INRConvert|850|m}}.<ref>{{cite news|title=Kolkata to host IPL 2020 auction on December 19|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/kolkata-to-host-ipl-2020-auction-on-december-19/articleshow/71386522.cms|accessdate=15 October 2019}}</ref>\n*Under-19 players cannot be picked unless they have previously played [[first-class cricket|first-class]] or [[List A cricket|List A]] cricket.\n*A team can play a maximum of 4 overseas players in their playing eleven.<ref>{{cite web|title=Instances in IPL when team played less than 4 overseas players|url=https://www.crictracker.com/instances-ipl-team-played-less-4-overseas-players/|accessdate=20 February 2019|work=CricTracker|date=5 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe term of a player contract is one year, with the franchise having the option to extend the contract by one or two years. Since the 2014 season, the player contracts are denominated in the [[Indian rupee]], before which the contracts were in [[U.S. dollar]]s. Overseas players can be remunerated in the currency of the player's choice at the [[exchange rate]] on either the contract due date or the actual date of payment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Player regulations for IPL 2014|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2014/content/story/703647.html|date=24 December 2013|work=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref> Prior to the 2014 season, Indian domestic players were not included in the player auction pool and could be signed up by the franchises at a discrete amount while a fixed sum of {{INRConvert|1|m}} to {{INRConvert|3|m}} would get deducted per signing from the franchise's salary purse. This received significant opposition from franchise owners who complained that richer franchises were \"luring players with under-the-table deals\" following which the IPL decided to include domestic players in the player auction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/indian-premier-league-2014/content/story/714115.html|title=IPL longlist features 651 uncapped players|date=30 January 2014|work=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=20 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to a 2015 survey by Sporting Intelligence and ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'', the average IPL salary when [[pro rata|pro-rated]] is {{USD}}4.33 million per year, the second highest among all sports leagues in the world.

The place remains as Alameda de los Remedios and it is still planted with [[lime (fruit)|lime]] and [[Aesculus hippocastanum|horse-chestnut]] trees. A humble granite marker and a bronze plate recall the event. Additionally, the small Spanish village of Villanueva de la Sierra held the first modern Arbor Day, an initiative launched in 1805 by the local priest with the enthusiastic support of the entire population.\n\n{{Quote|While Napoleon was ravaging Europe with his ambition in this village in the Sierra de Gata lived a priest, don Juan Abern Samtr\u00e9s, which, according to the chronicles, \"convinced of the importance of trees for health, hygiene, decoration, nature, environment and customs, decides to plant trees and give a festive air. The festival began on Carnival Tuesday with the ringing of two bells of the church, and the Middle and the Big. After the Mass, and even coated with church ornaments, don Juan, accompanied by clergies, teachers and a large number of neighbours, planted the first tree, a poplar, in the place known as Valley of the Ejido. Tree plantations continued by Arroyada and Fuente de la Mora. Afterwards, there was a feast, and did not miss the dance. The party and plantations lasted three days.

This predates the claimed founding of the day by Don Clark of Schomberg, Ontario for his wife Margret Clark in 1906.
