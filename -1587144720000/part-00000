He is depicted as a short, paunchy skeleton who wears a blue jacket, black basketball shorts with a white lining, a white t-shirt, and pink slippers or white sneakers. His name is based on the [[Comic Sans]] font, which is used for most of his in-game dialogue. The character was praised by critics for his dialogue and [[Boss (video gaming)|boss fight]], which is considered to be the most difficult in the game.

He clarifies that he has no interest in capturing humans, unlike Papyrus, who he describes as a \"human-hunting FANATIC.\" After helping the player hide from Papyrus, Sans follows his brother throughout most of the forest, commentating on his puzzles and even contributing a word search, much to Papyrus' dismay. As the story proceeds, Sans continues to be a regular source of comic relief, performing such antics as attempting to sell the player fried snow. Later in the game, Sans invites the player to go eat at a restaurant with him. As he talks, he explains how he befriended a woman behind the large door in Snowdin who shared an equal love for puns as he did. He explains how he made a promise not to kill any humans who come to the Underground and states if he didn't make that promise the player would have been dead where they stand.\n\nSans makes one more appearance in the \"Judgement Hall\", where he reveals the true meaning of the \"EXP\" and \"LOVE\" values that the player has accumulated through the game: 'Execution Points' and 'Level of Violence', respectively. He judges the player for how high their EXP and LOVE values are before disappearing and letting the player proceed to fight the king, Asgore. After the player defeats Asgore and leaves the Underground, Sans calls them to inform them of what occurred after their departure, having different dialogue depending on the player's actions in game. If the player finishes the game without killing any monsters, Sans appears after Asgore's defeat along with the other main characters, but his soul gets absorbed by [[Flowey]] along with most of the other monsters. He is restored after the player defeats Flowey and escapes the Underground with the rest of the monsters.\n\nIf the player opts to kill every monster they encounter, Sans' behavior will be very different. He threatens the player with a \"bad time\" if they proceed with their actions before the Papyrus boss fight. If the player ignores Sans' warning and continues slaughtering every monster they encounter, he eventually confronts the player in the Judgement Hall to prevent them from destroying the world, acting as the route's [[Boss (video gaming)|final boss]]. Sans puts up a fierce fight but is eventually slain by the player, allowing them to finish the route.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/undertale-the-kotaku-review-1739735669|title=Undertale: The Kotaku Review|website=Kotaku}}</ref>\n\n===In ''Deltarune''===\nSans appears as a cameo in chapter one of ''[[Deltarune]]'', where he is found standing outside his shop.

After the player defeats Asgore and leaves the Underground, Sans calls them to inform them of what occurred after their departure, having different dialogue depending on the player's actions in game. If the player finishes the game without killing any monsters, Sans appears after Asgore's defeat along with the other main characters, but his soul gets absorbed by [[Flowey]] along with most of the other monsters. He is restored after the player defeats Flowey and escapes the Underground with the rest of the monsters.\n\nIf the player opts to kill every monster they encounter, Sans' behavior will be very different. He threatens the player with a \"bad time\" if they proceed with their actions before the Papyrus boss fight. If the player ignores Sans' warning and continues slaughtering every monster they encounter, he eventually confronts the player in the Judgement Hall to prevent them from destroying the world, acting as the route's [[Boss (video gaming)|final boss]]. Sans puts up a fierce fight but is eventually slain by the player, allowing them to finish the route.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/undertale-the-kotaku-review-1739735669|title=Undertale: The Kotaku Review|website=Kotaku}}</ref>\n\n===In ''Deltarune''===\nSans appears as a cameo in chapter one of ''[[Deltarune]]'', where he is found standing outside his shop.
