Its activities are informed by the main objective of its members which is to discover, develop and represent fashion models so as to enable them to enjoy profitable, safe and fulfilling careers.\nMembers meet at regular intervals and maintain an on-going dialogue with clients from all sectors and with other relevant stakeholders. These include NGOs, government and regulatory bodies such as HMRC, the Home Office / UK Border, and other trade associations.

The fracture toughness for plane stress conditions is typically twice as large as that for plane strain. However, because of the rapid rate of growth of a crack near the end of its life, variations in fracture toughness do not significantly alter the life of a component.\n\nCrack growth programs typically provide a choice of:\n* cycle counting methods to extract cycle extremes\n* geometry factors that select for the shape of the crack and the applied loading\n* crack growth equation\n* acceleration/retardation models\n* material properties such as yield strength and fracture toughness\n\n=== Analytical solution ===\nThe stress intensity factor is given by\n\n:<math>K = \\beta \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}, </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\sigma </math> is the applied uniform tensile stress acting on the specimen in the direction perpendicular to the crack plane, <math>a</math> is the crack length and <math>\\beta</math> is a dimensionless parameter that depends on the geometry of the specimen.

The fracture toughness for plane stress conditions is typically twice as large as that for plane strain. However, because of the rapid rate of growth of a crack near the end of its life, variations in fracture toughness do not significantly alter the life of a component.\n\nCrack growth programs typically provide a choice of:\n* cycle counting methods to extract cycle extremes\n* geometry factors that select for the shape of the crack and the applied loading\n* crack growth equation\n* acceleration/retardation models\n* material properties such as yield strength and fracture toughness\n\n=== Analytical solution ===\nThe stress intensity factor is given by\n\n:<math>K = \\beta \\sigma \\sqrt{\\pi a}, </math>\n\nwhere <math>\\sigma </math> is the applied uniform tensile stress acting on the specimen in the direction perpendicular to the crack plane, <math>a</math> is the crack length and <math>\\beta</math> is a dimensionless parameter that depends on the geometry of the specimen.

{"title_page": "Lord Hay's Masque", "text_new": "{{Italic title}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n{{Use British English|date=November 2012}}\n'''''Lord Hay's Masque''''' was an early [[Literature in English#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] era [[masque]], written by [[Thomas Campion]], with costumes, sets and stage effects designed by [[Inigo Jones]]. The masque was performed on [[Twelfth Night (holiday)|Twelfth Night]], 6 January [[1607 in literature|1607]], in the Great Hall of [[Whitehall Palace]]. It was the premier event at the [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] Court for the 1606-7 Christmas holiday season.\n\n==The marriage==\n''Lord Hay's Masque'' celebrated the wedding of an important Scottish aristocrat with a socially prominent English [[gentlewoman]] &mdash; in this case, the marriage of [[James Hay, 1st Earl of Carlisle|Sir James Hay]], a favorite of King [[James I of England|James I]] (and one of the masquers in ''Hymenaei'' the previous year), with Honoria Denny, daughter of [[Edward Denny, 1st Earl of Norwich|Edward, Lord Denny]]. The intricate politics of the Stuart Court decreed some key differences between the two events, though: while the bill for the previous masque, ''Hymenaei'', had been paid by King James, the expenses of the masque for Lord Hay were covered by the powerful Howard and [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Cecil]] families. The principal masquers were led by Theophilus Howard, Lord Walden, the son and heir of the Earl of Suffolk. Since James's queen consort, [[Anne of Denmark]], was antipathetic to the Howards, she sat out the masque, claiming illness.<ref>Barroll, pp. 109. 203.</ref> (Partially as a result, the documentary record on ''Lord Hay's Masque'' is thinner than for some other Court masques of the era.)\n\n==The masque==\nJones's design for the masque had a sylvan theme, centered on a Grove of [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] with nine golden trees, flanked by a Bower of [[Flora (mythology)|Flora]] on the right and a House of Night on the left. One scene featured artificial owls and bats flying around the set on wires. The nine gold trees moved and danced and split apart to reveal the nine principal masquers (the trees then sank into the stage below, at a touch from Night's wand). The masquers, dressed in carnation and cloth of silver and initially concealed in green and silver leaves, were nine knights of [[Apollo]], and the torchbearers were the nine Hours of the night.<ref>Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 241; Leapman, p. 93.</ref>\n\n==The music==\nThe masque was richly supplied with music, created by several composers &mdash; including Campion himself, who contributed two \"airs\" for songs and a dance. The published text indicates that the music was played by a \"consort of twelve,\" violins with three lutes, a \"consort of ten\" that included [[harpsichord]], [[Bandora (instrument)|bandora]], [[sackbut]], and two violins as well as lutes, and a group of [[cornet]]s. A few details of the musical arrangements have survived, including the fact that at least one song was sung by a doubled set of voices, with a treble and bass situated near the King and another set of singers on the stage, \"so that the words of the song might be heard of all.\"<ref>Walls, p. 43.</ref>\n\n==Publication==\nCampion's text was entered into the [[Stationers' Register]] on 26 January 1607 and was published in [[book size|quarto]] shortly after, printed by John Windet for the bookseller John Browne.<ref>Chambers, Vol. 3, p. 240.</ref> Campion's verses conjoin the personal and political, hailing the marriage of Hay and Denny and looking forward to a day when English/Scottish intermarriage will produce a new \"British\" citizen.\n\n==Aftermath==\nSuch political and social import is a heavy load to lay on a new marriage. Within two years the couple were facing difficulties. Honoria was supposedly unfaithful and Hay was jealous; he broke open her cabinets in search of love letters and threatened her servants. Lady [[Mary Wroth]] exploited their troubles in ''Urania,'' her prose [[roman \u00e0 clef]] about Stuart high society.<ref>Cerasano and Wynne-Davies, pp. 93-4.</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[The Lords's Masque|The Lords' Masque]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* Barroll, John Leeds.
