The [[Private (rank)|private]] (on the left) is wearing a [[belted plaid]].]]\n{{Culture of Scotland}}\n\n'''Tartan''' ({{lang-gd|breacan}} {{IPA-gd|\u02c8p\u027e\u02b2\u025bxk\u0259n|}}) is a patterned cloth consisting of criss-crossed horizontal and vertical bands in multiple colours. Tartans originated in woven wool, but now they are made in many other materials. Tartan is particularly associated with [[Scotland]]; Scottish [[kilt]]s almost always have tartan patterns.\n\nTartan is made with alternating bands of coloured (pre-dyed) threads woven as both [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[Warp and woof|weft]] at [[right angle]]s to each other. The weft is woven in a simple [[twill]], two over\u2014two under the warp, advancing one thread at each pass. This forms visible diagonal lines where different colours cross, which give the appearance of new colours blended from the original ones. The resulting blocks of colour repeat vertically and horizontally in a distinctive pattern of squares and lines known as a ''sett''.\n\nTartan is often mistakenly called \"plaid\" (particularly in the United States), but in Scotland, a ''[[Full plaid|plaid]]'' is a large piece of tartan cloth, worn as a [[Belted plaid|type of kilt]] or [[Earasaid|large shawl]]. The term ''plaid'' is also used in Scotland for an ordinary blanket such as one would have on a bed.<ref name=\"scottishtartans.org--faq\"/>\n\nThe [[Dress Act 1746|Dress Act of 1746]] attempted to bring the warrior clans under government control by banning the tartan and other aspects of [[Gaels|Gaelic culture]]. When the law was repealed in 1782, it was no longer ordinary Highland dress, but was adopted instead as the [[Highland dress|symbolic national dress of Scotland]].\n\nUntil the middle of the nineteenth century, the highland tartans were only associated with either regions or districts, rather than any specific [[Scottish clan]]. This was because like other materials, tartan designs were produced by local weavers for local tastes and would usually only use the [[natural dye]]s available in that area, as synthetic dye production was non-existent and transportation of other dye materials across long distances was prohibitively expensive.\n\nThe patterns were simply different regional checked-cloth patterns, chosen by the wearer's preference\u2014in the same way as people nowadays choose what colours and patterns they like in their clothing, without particular reference to propriety. It was not until the mid-nineteenth century that many patterns were created and artificially associated with Scottish clans, families, or institutions who were (or wished to be seen as) associated in some way with a Scottish heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishtartans.org/tartan.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210055101/http://www.scottishtartans.org/tartan.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 February 2006 |title=Introduction to Tartan |first=Matthew Allan C. |last=Newsome |publisher=Scottish Tartans Museum |location=[[Franklin, North Carolina]] |year=1994 |accessdate=31 May 2010 }}</ref> The Victorians' penchant for ordered taxonomy and the new chemical dyes then available meant that the idea of specific patterns of bright colours, or \"dress\" tartans, could be created and applied to a faux-nostalgic view of Scottish history.\n\nToday ''tartan'' is no longer limited to [[textile]]s, but is used on mediums such as paper, plastics, packaging, and wall coverings.<ref name=tartangenerator.com--construction>{{cite web |url=http://www.tartangenerator.com/tartan/pages/construction.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027160918/http://www.tartangenerator.com/tartan/pages/construction.html |archive-date=2007-10-27 |df=dmy-all |website=Tartangenerator.com |series=Tartan design software |title=Tartan constructor}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology and terminology==\n[[File:Tartan Weaving in Lochcarron.jpg|thumb|right|Tartan weaving in [[Lochcarron]], [[Scottish Highlands]]]]\n\nThe [[English language|English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]] word \"tartan\" is most likely derived from the [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|tartarin}}'' meaning \"[[Tatars|Tartar]] cloth\".<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |title=tartan (n.) |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=tartan&searchmode=none |accessdate=March 4, 2018}}</ref> It has also been suggested that \"tartan\" may be derived from modern [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''{{lang|gd|tarsainn}}'',<ref name=\"BanksdelaChapelle--57\">[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle 2007]]: p. 57.</ref> meaning \"across\". Today \"tartan\" usually refers to coloured patterns, though originally a tartan did not have to be made up of any pattern at all. As late as the 1830s tartan was sometimes described as \"plain coloured ... without pattern\".<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\" /> Patterned cloth from the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking [[Scottish Highlands]] was called ''{{lang|gd|breacan}}'', meaning many colours. Over time the meanings of ''tartan'' and ''{{lang|gd|breacan}}'' were combined to describe certain type of pattern on a certain type of cloth. The pattern of a tartan is called a ''sett''. The sett is made up of a series of woven threads which cross at [[right angle]]s.<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\" />\n\nToday ''tartan'' is generally used to describe the pattern, not limited to textiles.<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\"/> In North America the term ''plaid'' is commonly used to describe ''tartan''.<ref name=\"scottishtartans.org--faq\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishtartans.org/faq.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000417094827/http://www.scottishtartans.org/faq.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 April 2000 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=16 October 2008 |publisher=scottishtartans.org }}</ref> The word ''plaid'', derived from the Scottish Gaelic ''{{lang|gd|plaide}}'', meaning \"blanket\",<ref>[[#M1|MacBain 1911]]: p. 277. The original word was the Luwian \"pldtmn\" and then later Latin \"paludamentum\" or \"cloak\" (Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities. The paludamentum was a plaid or red cloak put on by Caesar in time of war.). See also: [[#M1|Merriam-Webster 2003]]: p. 947.</ref> was first used of any rectangular garment, sometimes made up of tartan, particularly that which preceded the modern kilt (see: [[belted plaid]]). In time, ''plaid'' was used to describe blankets themselves.<ref name=\"scottishtartans.org--faq\"/>\n\n==Construction==\nEach thread in the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] crosses each thread in the [[Warp and woof|weft]] at right angles. Where a thread in the warp crosses a thread of the same colour in the weft they produce a solid colour on the tartan, while a thread crossing another of a different colour produces an equal mixture of the two colours. Thus, a set of two base colours produces three different colours including one mixture. The total number of colours, including mixtures, increases [[quadratic growth|quadratically]] with the number of base colours so a set of six base colours produces fifteen mixtures and a total of twenty-one different colours. This means that the more stripes and colours used, the more blurred and subdued the tartan's pattern becomes.<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\"/><ref name=\"BanksdelaChapelle--61\">[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle 2007]]: p. 61.</ref>\n\nThe sequence of threads, known as the sett, starts at an edge and either repeats or reverses on what are called ''pivot'' points. In ''diagram A'', the sett reverses at the first pivot, then repeats, then reverses at the next pivot, and will carry on in this manner horizontally. In ''diagram B'', the sett reverses and repeats in the same way as the warp, and also carries on in the same manner vertically. The diagrams left illustrate the construction of a \"symmetrical\" tartan. However, on an \"asymmetrical\" tartan, the sett does not reverse at the pivots, it just repeats at the pivots. Also, some tartans (very few) do not have exactly the same sett for the warp and weft. This means the warp and weft will have alternate ''thread counts''.\n\nTartan is recorded by counting the threads of each colour that appear in the sett.{{efn|Early collectors of tartan recorded setts by measuring the width of each stripe in one eighths of an inch.<ref name=\"tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount\"/>}} The ''thread count'' not only describes the width of the stripes on a sett, but also the colours used. For example, the thread count \"K4 R24 K24 Y4\" corresponds to 4 ''black'' threads, 24 ''red'' threads, 24 ''black'' threads, 4 ''yellow'' threads.<ref name=\"tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount\" /> The first and last threads of the thread count are the pivot points.<ref name=\"tartangenerator.com--construction\" /> Though thread counts are indeed quite specific, they can be modified in certain circumstances, depending on the desired size of the tartan. For example, the sett of a tartan (about 6&nbsp;inches) may be too large to fit upon the face of a [[necktie]]. In this case the thread count has to be reduced ''in proportion'' (about 3&nbsp;inches).<ref name=\"tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tartansauthority.com/Web/Site/Tartan/Designing/WhatsAThreadcount.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040604051800/http://www.tartansauthority.com/Web/Site/Tartan/Designing/WhatsAThreadcount.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 June 2004 |title=What's a Threadcount |accessdate=16 October 2008 |publisher=[[Scottish Tartans Authority]] }}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Tartan diagram (warp and weft) A.svg|Diagram A, the warp\nFile:Tartan diagram (warp and weft) B.svg|Diagram B, the weft\nFile:Tartan diagram (warp and weft) C.svg|Diagram C, the tartan.

The resulting variations are termed: ''modern'', ''ancient'', and ''muted''.<ref name=ReproColr group=lower-alpha>\"Muted\" colours are also called \"reproduction\" colours.</ref> These terms only refer to dye colours.<ref name=E_P_MacDonald>{{cite web |url=http://www.tartansauthority.com/Web/Site/Tartan/Dyeing/UseOfColour.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040604053350/http://www.tartansauthority.com/Web/Site/Tartan/Dyeing/UseOfColour.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 June 2004 |title=The Use of Colour in Tartan |author=MacDonald, Peter Eslea |accessdate=22 October 2008 |publisher=[[Scottish Tartans Authority]]}}</ref>\n\n; Modern colours\n: Describes a tartan that is coloured using chemical dye, as opposed to natural dye. In the mid-19th century natural dyes began to be replaced by chemical dyes which were easier to use and were more economic for the booming tartan industry. Chemical dyes tend to produce a very strong, vivid colour compared to natural dyes. In ''modern'' colours, setts made up of blue, black, and green tend to be obscured.\n; Ancient colours\n: Refers to a lighter shade of tartan. These shades are meant to represent the colours that would result from fabric aging over time.\n; Muted colours\n: Also called ''reproduction'' colours, refers to tartan which is shade between ''modern'' and ''ancient''. Although this type of coloring is very recent, dating only from the early 1970s, these shades are thought to be the closest match to the colours attained by natural dyes used before the mid-19th century.\n\nThe idea that the various colours used in tartan have a specific meaning is purely a modern one. One such myth is that red tartans were \"battle tartans\", designed so they would not show blood. It is only recently created tartans, such as Canadian [[Regional tartans of Canada|provincial and territorial tartans]] (beginning 1950s) and U.S. [[List of U.S. state tartans|state tartans]] (beginning 1980s), that are designed with certain symbolic meaning for the colours used. For example, the colour ''green'' sometimes represents [[prairie]]s or forests, ''blue'' can represent lakes and rivers, and the colour ''yellow'' is sometimes used to represent various [[crop]]s.<ref name=\"MacDonald1995--48\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Pre-medieval origins===\n[[File:Scottish soldiers in service of Gustavus Adolphus, 1631-cropped-.jpg|thumb|The earliest image of Scottish soldiers wearing tartan, 1631 German engraving.<ref name=\"BanksdelaChapelle--63\"/>{{efn|The Highlanders depicted were sometimes mistakenly described as [[Irish people|Irish]] \"Irrl\u00e4nder oder Irren\".

The present official [[Clan Campbell]] tartans are predominantly blue, green and black.<ref name=\"ccsna-jsep50a\"/>]]\n\nThe tartan as we know it today is not thought to have existed in Scotland before the 16th century. By the late 16th century there are numerous references to striped or checkered plaids. It is not until the late 17th or early 18th century that any kind of uniformity in tartan is thought to have occurred.<ref>[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle (2007)]] pp. 66\u201367.</ref> [[Martin Martin]], in ''A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland'', published in 1703, wrote that Scottish tartans could be used to distinguish the inhabitants of different regions. He expressly wrote that the inhabitants of various islands and the mainland of the Highlands were not all dressed alike, but that the setts and colours of the various tartans varied from isle to isle.{{efn|[[Martin Martin]] wrote: \"each Isle differs from the other in thir fancy of making Plaids, as to the Stripes in Breadth and Colours. this Humour is as different thro the main Land of the Highlands, in so-far that they who have seen these Places are able, at the first view of a Man's Plaid to guess the Place of his Residence&nbsp;...\"<ref>[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle 2007]]: pp. 65\u201366. Banks and de la Chapelle cite this quotation from Scarlett, James D. ''Tartan, The Highland Textile'', p. 12.</ref>}} As he does not mention the use of a special pattern by each family, it would appear that such a distinction is a modern one.\n\nFor many centuries the patterns were loosely associated with the weavers of a particular area, though it was common for [[Scottish Highlands|highlanders]] to wear a number of different tartans at the same time. A 1587 charter granted to Hector [[Clan Maclean|Maclean]] of [[Duart Castle|Duart]] requires [[Ground rent|feu duty]] on land paid as 60 [[ell]]s of cloth of white, black and green colours. A witness of the 1689 [[Battle of Killiecrankie]] describes \"[[Glengarry|McDonnell]]'s men in their triple stripes\". From 1725 the government force of the ''Highland Independent Companies'' introduced a standardised tartan chosen to avoid association with any particular clan, and this was formalised when they became the [[Black Watch]] regiment in 1739.\n\n[[File:The MacDonald boys playing golf.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''The MacDonald boys playing [[golf]]'', 18th century, [[National Galleries of Scotland]]]]\n\nThe most effective fighters for [[Jacobitism]] were the supporting Scottish clans, leading to an association of tartans with the Jacobite cause. Efforts to pacify the Highlands led to the ''Dress Act of 1746'', banning tartans, except for the Highland regiments of the British army. \"[I]t was probably their use of it which gave birth to the idea of differentiating tartan by clans; for as the Highland regiments were multiplied ... so their tartan uniforms were differentiated.\"<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The Invention of Tradition: The Highland Tradition of Scotland |author=Hugh Trevor-Roper |title=The Invention of Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=varoQwAACAAJ |editor1-first=Eric |editor1-last=Hobsbawm |editor2-first=Terence |editor2-last=Ranger |editor1-link=Eric Hobsbawm |editor2-link=Terence Ranger |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1983 |isbn=0-521-24645-8}}</ref>\n\nThe Act was repealed in 1782, due to the efforts of the [[Highland Society of London]]. William Wilson & Sons of [[Bannockburn]] became the foremost weaving manufacturer around 1770 as suppliers of tartan to the military. Wilson corresponded with his agents in the Highlands to get information and samples of cloth from the clan districts to enable him to reproduce \"perfectly genuine patterns\" and recorded over 200 setts by 1822, many of which were tentatively named. The Cockburn Collection of named samples made by William Wilson & Sons was put together between 1810 and 1820 and is now in the [[Mitchell Library]] in [[Glasgow]].<ref>{{cite book |author=William Cockburn |title=A collection of old hard tartans made by Sir William Cockburn of Cockburn, Bart. between the years 1810\u20131820 |url= |year=1810 |isbn=}}</ref> At this time many setts were simply numbered, or given fanciful names such as the \"[[Robin Hood]]\" tartan, not associated with any specific clan.\n\n===The absence of early clan tartans===\n[[File:The Battle of Culloden.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[David Morier]]'s ''An Incident in the Rebellion of 1745''. The eight featured highlanders in the painting wear over twenty different tartans.<ref>[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle (2007)]] p. 84.</ref>]]\nIt is generally regarded that \"clan tartans\" date no earlier than the beginning of the 19th century, and are an example of an [[invented tradition]]. Contemporary portraits show that although tartan is of an early date, the pattern worn depended not on the wearer's clan, but rather upon his or her present affiliation, place of origin or current residence, or personal taste.\n\n[[David Morier]]'s well-known painting of the Highland charge at the Battle of Culloden (right) shows the clansmen wearing various tartans. The setts painted all differ from one another and very few of those painted resemble any of today's clan tartans.<ref name=\"Campbell--259261\" /> It is maintained by many{{who|date=December 2019}} that clan tartans were not in use at the time of the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746. The method of identifying friend from foe was not through tartans but by the colour of ribbon worn upon the [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]].{{efn|James Ray who served in the government forces at the Battle of Culloden, wrote in 1752: \"In their flight I came up with a pretty young Highlander, who called out to me, Hold your Hand, I'm a Cambell.

Evidence suggests that in 1725 the Independent Highland Companies may have worn a uniform tartan.<ref name=\"Campbell--259261\" />\n\n==Modern tartans==\nBy the 19th century the Highland romantic revival, inspired by [[James Macpherson]]'s [[Ossian]] poems and the writings of Sir [[Walter Scott]], led to wider interest, with clubs like the Celtic Society of Edinburgh welcoming Lowlanders. The pageantry invented for the 1822 [[visit of King George IV to Scotland]] brought a sudden demand for tartan cloth and made it the [[Folk costume|national dress]] of the whole of Scotland, rather than just the Highlands and Islands, with the invention of many new clan-specific tartans to suit.\n\n===Georgian royal patronage===\n{{Further|Visit of King George IV to Scotland}}\n[[File:George IV in kilt, by Wilkie.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[David Wilkie (artist)|Wilkie]]'s idealised depiction of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]], in full [[Highland dress]], during the visit to Scotland in 1822{{efn|Sir [[David Wilkie (artist)|David Wilkie]]'s portrait of [[George IV of the United Kingdom|George IV]] depicts the king as being much slimmer than he actually was.

The two claimed to be grandsons of Prince Charles Edward Stuart and his wife [[Princess Louise of Stolberg-Gedern|Princess Louise of Stolberg]], and consequently later became known as the \"[[Sobieski Stuarts]]\".

Prince Albert personally took care of the interior design, where he made great use of tartan. He used the red ''Royal Stewart'' and the green ''Hunting Stewart'' tartans for carpets, while using the ''Dress Stewart'' for curtains and upholstery. The Queen designed the ''Victoria'' tartan, and Prince Albert the ''Balmoral'', still used as a royal tartan today.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tartan in Royal Dress |url=https://www.rct.uk/collection/themes/exhibitions/fashioning-a-reign/palace-of-holyroodhouse/tartan-in-royal-dress |accessdate=3 February 2020 |agency=Royal Collection Trust}}</ref>\n\nVictoria and Albert spent a considerable amount of time at their estate, and in doing so hosted many \"Highland\" activities.

Alexander Macdonald, 2nd [[Baron Macdonald]] was so far removed from his Highland heritage that he wrote to the Society: \"Being really ignorant of what is exactly The Macdonald Tartan, I request you will have the goodness to exert every Means in your power to Obtain a perfectly genuine Pattern, Such as Will Warrant me in Authenticating it with my Arms.\"\n\nToday tartan and \"clan tartan\" is an important part of a Scottish clan. Almost all Scottish clans have several tartans attributed to their name. Several clans have \"official\" tartans. Although it is possible for anyone to create a tartan and name it any name they wish, the only person with the authority to make a clan's tartan \"official\" is the chief.{{efn|Although there are many tartans attributed to the Campbells, and many tartans named ''Campbell'', there are only four tartans recognised by the current chief as [[Clan Campbell]] tartans: ''Campbell'' (a.k.a. ''Black Watch''), ''Campbell of Breadalbane'', ''Campbell of Cawdor'', and ''Campbell of Loudoun''.<ref name=\"ccsna-jsep50a\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ccsna.org/jsep50a.htm |title=Which are the authentic Campbell tartans? |accessdate=9 October 2008 |publisher=ccsna.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814041325/http://www.ccsna.org/jsep50a.htm |archive-date=14 August 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nIn some cases, following such recognition from the clan chief, the clan tartan is recorded and registered by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]]. Once approved by the Lord Lyon, after recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Tartan, the clan tartan is then recorded in the Lyon Court Books.<ref name=\"Campbell--259261\">Campbell of Airds (2000), pp. 259\u2013261.</ref> In at least one instance a clan tartan appears in the heraldry of a clan chief and is considered by the Lord Lyon as the \"proper\" tartan of the clan.{{efn|The crest of the chief of [[Clan MacLennan]] is ''A demi-piper all Proper, garbed in the proper tartan of the Clan Maclennan''.<ref>[[#P|Way of Plean; Squire (2000)]], p. 214.</ref> Note the highland MacLennans use the same tartan as the lowland [[Clan Logan|Logans]].

This is the personal tartan of Queen [[Elizabeth II]]. The sett was first published in 1831 in the book ''The Scottish Gael'' by James Logan. In addition to its use in clothing, such as skirts and scarves, Royal Stewart tartan has also appeared on biscuit tins for Scottish [[shortbread]].<ref>Marketing\". p. 9. Haymarket Press, 1973</ref>\n\nAnother popular tartan is the [[List of tartans|Black Watch]] (also known as Grant Hunting, Universal, and Government).<ref name=\"MacDonald1995--48\"/> This tartan, a darkened variant of the main Clan Campbell tartan (Ancient or Old Campbell), was used and is still used by several military units in the [[British Army]] and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces.\n\n<gallery mode = packed heights = 130px>\nFile:Royal Stewart tartan.png|Royal Stewart tartan\nFile:Black_Watch_or_Campbell_tartan.svg|Black Watch tartan\n</gallery>\n\n==Other tartans==\n[[File:Highland Dance 002.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Highland dancing]] at a 2005 [[Highland games]] held in the Pacific Northwest, U.S.]]\nIn addition to clan tartans, many tartan patterns have been developed for individuals, families, districts, institutions, and corporations.

By then, tartan had shifted from being mainly a component of men's clothing to become an important part of women's fashion. In consequence of its association with the British aristocracy and military, tartan developed an air of dignity and exclusivity. Because of this, tartan has made reappearances in the world of fashion several times.\n\nFor instance, tartan made a resurgence in its use in [[punk fashion]]. In the late 1970s, [[Punk rock|punk music]] was a way for youth in the British Isles to voice their discontent with the [[ruling class]]. The unorthodox use of tartan, which had long been associated with authority and [[Gentry|gentility]], was then seen as the expression of discontent against modern society.

Even so, there are no laws or rules on who can, or cannot, wear a particular tartan. The concept of the entitlement to certain tartans has led to the term of ''universal tartan'', or ''free tartan'', which describes tartan which can be worn by anyone.

The claimed \"rules\" are mere conventions, with different levels of importance depending on the symbolic meaning of the tartan on some particular occasion. For example, when a district tartan is worn at a football game, or a family tartan at a family event, such as the investiture of a new clan chief, the issue of wearing the event's tartan is of greater concern than wearing the same tartan when attending Highland Games where no event is scheduled where the tartan would have special significance. The same rules apply as do to wearing ''any clothing'' that prominently displays colors with national or political significance, such as un-patterned orange or green cloth in Ireland (regardless of whether it is worn as a kilt), or red, white, and blue colors at national events in France or the United States.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Scotland|United Kingdom}}\n* [[Argyle (pattern)]]\n* [[Carnegie Mellon University]], whose athletic mascot is Scotty the Scottie Dog; their athletic teams are known as \"The Tartans\"\n* [[Check (pattern)]]\n* [[Flannel]]\n* [[List of tartans]]\n* [[List of U.S. state tartans]], officially recognised tartans of states in the US (created in the 1980s)\n* [[Madras (cloth)]]\n* [[Regional tartans of Canada]], officially recognised tartans of the provinces and territories of Canada (created in the 1950s)\n* [[Sobieski Stuarts]]\n* [[Tartan Army]], popular name for the fans of the Scotland football team\n* [[Tartan Day]], a day of celebration, in Canada and the US, recognising the influence of Scottish immigration to these countries\n* [[Tartanry]]\n* ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]'', the Victorian forgery that is the source of many of today's clan tartans\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== General sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Scottish Clans and Their Tartans |year=2005 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=1-4179-6815-X |ref=A1}} (originally published by: W. & A.

The [[Private (rank)|private]] (on the left) is wearing a [[belted plaid]].]]\n{{Culture of Scotland}}\n\n'''Tartan''' ({{lang-gd|breacan}} {{IPA-gd|\u02c8p\u027e\u02b2\u025bxk\u0259n|}}) is a patterned cloth consisting of criss-crossed horizontal and vertical bands in multiple colours. Tartans originated in woven wool, but now they are made in many other materials. Tartan is particularly associated with [[Scotland]]; Scottish [[kilt]]s almost always have tartan patterns.\n\nTartan is made with alternating bands of coloured (pre-dyed) threads woven as both [[warp (weaving)|warp]] and [[Warp and woof|weft]] at [[right angle]]s to each other. The weft is woven in a simple [[twill]], two over\u2014two under the warp, advancing one thread at each pass. This forms visible diagonal lines where different colours cross, which give the appearance of new colours blended from the original ones. The resulting blocks of colour repeat vertically and horizontally in a distinctive pattern of squares and lines known as a ''sett''.\n\nTartan is often mistakenly called \"plaid\" (particularly in the United States), but in Scotland, a ''[[Full plaid|plaid]]'' is a large piece of tartan cloth, worn as a [[Belted plaid|type of kilt]] or [[Earasaid|large shawl]]. The term ''plaid'' is also used in Scotland for an ordinary blanket such as one would have on a bed.<ref name=\"scottishtartans.org--faq\"/>\n\nThe [[Dress Act 1746|Dress Act of 1746]] attempted to bring the warrior clans under government control by banning the tartan and other aspects of [[Gaels|Gaelic culture]]. When the law was repealed in 1782, it was no longer ordinary Highland dress, but was adopted instead as the [[Highland dress|symbolic national dress of Scotland]].\n\nUntil the middle of the nineteenth century, the highland tartans were only associated with either regions or districts, rather than any specific [[Scottish clan]]. This was because like other materials, tartan designs were produced by local weavers for local tastes and would usually only use the [[natural dye]]s available in that area, as synthetic dye production was non-existent and transportation of other dye materials across long distances was prohibitively expensive.\n\nThe patterns were simply different regional checked-cloth patterns, chosen by the wearer's preference\u2014in the same way as people nowadays choose what colours and patterns they like in their clothing, without particular reference to propriety. It was not until the mid-nineteenth century that many patterns were created and artificially associated with Scottish clans, families, or institutions who were (or wished to be seen as) associated in some way with a Scottish heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishtartans.org/tartan.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210055101/http://www.scottishtartans.org/tartan.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 February 2006 |title=Introduction to Tartan |first=Matthew Allan C. |last=Newsome |publisher=Scottish Tartans Museum |location=[[Franklin, North Carolina]] |year=1994 |accessdate=31 May 2010 }}</ref> The Victorians' penchant for ordered taxonomy and the new chemical dyes then available meant that the idea of specific patterns of bright colours, or \"dress\" tartans, could be created and applied to a faux-nostalgic view of Scottish history.\n\nToday ''tartan'' is no longer limited to [[textile]]s, but is used on mediums such as paper, plastics, packaging, and wall coverings.<ref name=tartangenerator.com--construction>{{cite web |url=http://www.tartangenerator.com/tartan/pages/construction.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027160918/http://www.tartangenerator.com/tartan/pages/construction.html |archive-date=2007-10-27 |df=dmy-all |website=Tartangenerator.com |series=Tartan design software |title=Tartan constructor}}</ref>\n\n==Etymology and terminology==\n[[File:Tartan Weaving in Lochcarron.jpg|thumb|right|Tartan weaving in [[Lochcarron]], [[Scottish Highlands]]]]\n\nThe [[English language|English]] and [[Scots language|Scots]] word \"tartan\" is most likely derived from the [[French language|French]] ''{{lang|fr|tartarin}}'' meaning \"[[Tatars|Tartar]] cloth\".<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary |title=tartan (n.) |url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=tartan&searchmode=none |accessdate=March 4, 2018}}</ref> It has also been suggested that \"tartan\" may be derived from modern [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''{{lang|gd|tarsainn}}'',<ref name=\"BanksdelaChapelle--57\">[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle 2007]]: p. 57.</ref> meaning \"across\". Today \"tartan\" usually refers to coloured patterns, though originally a tartan did not have to be made up of any pattern at all. As late as the 1830s tartan was sometimes described as \"plain coloured ... without pattern\".<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\" /> Patterned cloth from the [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]]-speaking [[Scottish Highlands]] was called ''{{lang|gd|breacan}}'', meaning many colours. Over time the meanings of ''tartan'' and ''{{lang|gd|breacan}}'' were combined to describe certain type of pattern on a certain type of cloth. The pattern of a tartan is called a ''sett''. The sett is made up of a series of woven threads which cross at [[right angle]]s.<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\" />\n\nToday ''tartan'' is generally used to describe the pattern, not limited to textiles.<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\"/> In North America the term ''plaid'' is commonly used to describe ''tartan''.<ref name=\"scottishtartans.org--faq\">{{cite web |url=http://www.scottishtartans.org/faq.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000417094827/http://www.scottishtartans.org/faq.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 April 2000 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=16 October 2008 |publisher=scottishtartans.org }}</ref> The word ''plaid'', derived from the Scottish Gaelic ''{{lang|gd|plaide}}'', meaning \"blanket\",<ref>[[#M1|MacBain 1911]]: p. 277. The original word was the Luwian \"pldtmn\" and then later Latin \"paludamentum\" or \"cloak\" (Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities. The paludamentum was a plaid or red cloak put on by Caesar in time of war.). See also: [[#M1|Merriam-Webster 2003]]: p. 947.</ref> was first used of any rectangular garment, sometimes made up of tartan, particularly that which preceded the modern kilt (see: [[belted plaid]]). In time, ''plaid'' was used to describe blankets themselves.<ref name=\"scottishtartans.org--faq\"/>\n\n==Construction==\nEach thread in the [[Warp (weaving)|warp]] crosses each thread in the [[Warp and woof|weft]] at right angles. Where a thread in the warp crosses a thread of the same colour in the weft they produce a solid colour on the tartan, while a thread crossing another of a different colour produces an equal mixture of the two colours. Thus, a set of two base colours produces three different colours including one mixture. The total number of colours, including mixtures, increases [[quadratic growth|quadratically]] with the number of base colours so a set of six base colours produces fifteen mixtures and a total of twenty-one different colours. This means that the more stripes and colours used, the more blurred and subdued the tartan's pattern becomes.<ref name=\"scottish.parliament.uk--tartan-ScarlettJames\"/><ref name=\"BanksdelaChapelle--61\">[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle 2007]]: p. 61.</ref>\n\nThe sequence of threads, known as the sett, starts at an edge and either repeats or reverses on what are called ''pivot'' points. In ''diagram A'', the sett reverses at the first pivot, then repeats, then reverses at the next pivot, and will carry on in this manner horizontally. In ''diagram B'', the sett reverses and repeats in the same way as the warp, and also carries on in the same manner vertically. The diagrams left illustrate the construction of a \"symmetrical\" tartan. However, on an \"asymmetrical\" tartan, the sett does not reverse at the pivots, it just repeats at the pivots. Also, some tartans (very few) do not have exactly the same sett for the warp and weft. This means the warp and weft will have alternate ''thread counts''.\n\nTartan is recorded by counting the threads of each colour that appear in the sett.{{efn|Early collectors of tartan recorded setts by measuring the width of each stripe in one eighths of an inch.<ref name=\"tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount\"/>}} The ''thread count'' not only describes the width of the stripes on a sett, but also the colours used. For example, the thread count \"K4 R24 K24 Y4\" corresponds to 4 ''black'' threads, 24 ''red'' threads, 24 ''black'' threads, 4 ''yellow'' threads.<ref name=\"tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount\" /> The first and last threads of the thread count are the pivot points.<ref name=\"tartangenerator.com--construction\" /> Though thread counts are indeed quite specific, they can be modified in certain circumstances, depending on the desired size of the tartan. For example, the sett of a tartan (about 6&nbsp;inches) may be too large to fit upon the face of a [[necktie]]. In this case the thread count has to be reduced ''in proportion'' (about 3&nbsp;inches).<ref name=\"tartansauthority.com--WhatsAThreadcount\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tartansauthority.com/Web/Site/Tartan/Designing/WhatsAThreadcount.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040604051800/http://www.tartansauthority.com/Web/Site/Tartan/Designing/WhatsAThreadcount.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 June 2004 |title=What's a Threadcount |accessdate=16 October 2008 |publisher=[[Scottish Tartans Authority]] }}</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Tartan diagram (warp and weft) A.svg|Diagram A, the warp\nFile:Tartan diagram (warp and weft) B.svg|Diagram B, the weft\nFile:Tartan diagram (warp and weft) C.svg|Diagram C, the tartan.

In the mid-19th century natural dyes began to be replaced by chemical dyes which were easier to use and were more economic for the booming tartan industry. Chemical dyes tend to produce a very strong, vivid colour compared to natural dyes. In ''modern'' colours, setts made up of blue, black, and green tend to be obscured.\n; Ancient colours\n: Refers to a lighter shade of tartan. These shades are meant to represent the colours that would result from fabric aging over time.\n; Muted colours\n: Also called ''reproduction'' colours, refers to tartan which is shade between ''modern'' and ''ancient''. Although this type of coloring is very recent, dating only from the early 1970s, these shades are thought to be the closest match to the colours attained by natural dyes used before the mid-19th century.\n\nThe idea that the various colours used in tartan have a specific meaning is purely a modern one. One such myth is that red tartans were \"battle tartans\", designed so they would not show blood. It is only recently created tartans, such as Canadian [[Regional tartans of Canada|provincial and territorial tartans]] (beginning 1950s) and U.S. [[List of U.S. state tartans|state tartans]] (beginning 1980s), that are designed with certain symbolic meaning for the colours used.

By the late 16th century there are numerous references to striped or checkered plaids. It is not until the late 17th or early 18th century that any kind of uniformity in tartan is thought to have occurred.<ref>[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle (2007)]] pp. 66\u201367.</ref> [[Martin Martin]], in ''A Description of the Western Islands of Scotland'', published in 1703, wrote that Scottish tartans could be used to distinguish the inhabitants of different regions. He expressly wrote that the inhabitants of various islands and the mainland of the Highlands were not all dressed alike, but that the setts and colours of the various tartans varied from isle to isle.{{efn|[[Martin Martin]] wrote: \"each Isle differs from the other in thir fancy of making Plaids, as to the Stripes in Breadth and Colours. this Humour is as different thro the main Land of the Highlands, in so-far that they who have seen these Places are able, at the first view of a Man's Plaid to guess the Place of his Residence&nbsp;...\"<ref>[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle 2007]]: pp. 65\u201366. Banks and de la Chapelle cite this quotation from Scarlett, James D. ''Tartan, The Highland Textile'', p. 12.</ref>}} As he does not mention the use of a special pattern by each family, it would appear that such a distinction is a modern one.\n\nFor many centuries the patterns were loosely associated with the weavers of a particular area, though it was common for [[Scottish Highlands|highlanders]] to wear a number of different tartans at the same time. A 1587 charter granted to Hector [[Clan Maclean|Maclean]] of [[Duart Castle|Duart]] requires [[Ground rent|feu duty]] on land paid as 60 [[ell]]s of cloth of white, black and green colours. A witness of the 1689 [[Battle of Killiecrankie]] describes \"[[Glengarry|McDonnell]]'s men in their triple stripes\". From 1725 the government force of the ''Highland Independent Companies'' introduced a standardised tartan chosen to avoid association with any particular clan, and this was formalised when they became the [[Black Watch]] regiment in 1739.\n\n[[File:The MacDonald boys playing golf.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''The MacDonald boys playing [[golf]]'', 18th century, [[National Galleries of Scotland]]]]\n\nThe most effective fighters for [[Jacobitism]] were the supporting Scottish clans, leading to an association of tartans with the Jacobite cause. Efforts to pacify the Highlands led to the ''Dress Act of 1746'', banning tartans, except for the Highland regiments of the British army. \"[I]t was probably their use of it which gave birth to the idea of differentiating tartan by clans; for as the Highland regiments were multiplied ... so their tartan uniforms were differentiated.\"<ref>{{cite book |chapter=The Invention of Tradition: The Highland Tradition of Scotland |author=Hugh Trevor-Roper |title=The Invention of Tradition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=varoQwAACAAJ |editor1-first=Eric |editor1-last=Hobsbawm |editor2-first=Terence |editor2-last=Ranger |editor1-link=Eric Hobsbawm |editor2-link=Terence Ranger |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1983 |isbn=0-521-24645-8}}</ref>\n\nThe Act was repealed in 1782, due to the efforts of the [[Highland Society of London]]. William Wilson & Sons of [[Bannockburn]] became the foremost weaving manufacturer around 1770 as suppliers of tartan to the military. Wilson corresponded with his agents in the Highlands to get information and samples of cloth from the clan districts to enable him to reproduce \"perfectly genuine patterns\" and recorded over 200 setts by 1822, many of which were tentatively named. The Cockburn Collection of named samples made by William Wilson & Sons was put together between 1810 and 1820 and is now in the [[Mitchell Library]] in [[Glasgow]].<ref>{{cite book |author=William Cockburn |title=A collection of old hard tartans made by Sir William Cockburn of Cockburn, Bart. between the years 1810\u20131820 |url= |year=1810 |isbn=}}</ref> At this time many setts were simply numbered, or given fanciful names such as the \"[[Robin Hood]]\" tartan, not associated with any specific clan.\n\n===The absence of early clan tartans===\n[[File:The Battle of Culloden.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[David Morier]]'s ''An Incident in the Rebellion of 1745''. The eight featured highlanders in the painting wear over twenty different tartans.<ref>[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle (2007)]] p. 84.</ref>]]\nIt is generally regarded that \"clan tartans\" date no earlier than the beginning of the 19th century, and are an example of an [[invented tradition]]. Contemporary portraits show that although tartan is of an early date, the pattern worn depended not on the wearer's clan, but rather upon his or her present affiliation, place of origin or current residence, or personal taste.\n\n[[David Morier]]'s well-known painting of the Highland charge at the Battle of Culloden (right) shows the clansmen wearing various tartans. The setts painted all differ from one another and very few of those painted resemble any of today's clan tartans.<ref name=\"Campbell--259261\" /> It is maintained by many{{who|date=December 2019}} that clan tartans were not in use at the time of the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746. The method of identifying friend from foe was not through tartans but by the colour of ribbon worn upon the [[Bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]].{{efn|James Ray who served in the government forces at the Battle of Culloden, wrote in 1752: \"In their flight I came up with a pretty young Highlander, who called out to me, Hold your Hand, I'm a Cambell.

The Queen designed the ''Victoria'' tartan, and Prince Albert the ''Balmoral'', still used as a royal tartan today.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tartan in Royal Dress |url=https://www.rct.uk/collection/themes/exhibitions/fashioning-a-reign/palace-of-holyroodhouse/tartan-in-royal-dress |accessdate=3 February 2020 |agency=Royal Collection Trust}}</ref>\n\nVictoria and Albert spent a considerable amount of time at their estate, and in doing so hosted many \"Highland\" activities. Victoria was attended by pipers and her children were attired in [[Highland dress]]. Prince Albert himself loved watching the [[Highland games]].<ref name=\"BanksdelaChapelle--108-109\">[[#B|Banks; de la Chapelle 2007]]: pp. 108\u2013109.</ref>{{efn|Queen Victoria wrote of her time in Scotland: \"Yes; and I feel a sort of reverence in going over these scenes in this most beautiful country, which I am proud to call my own, where there was such devoted loyalty to the family of my ancestors\u2014for [[House of Stuart|Stuart blood]] is in my veins, and I am now their representative, and the people are as devoted and loyal to me as they were to that unhappy race\".<ref>[[#V|Victoria 1885]]: p. 173.</ref>}} Ironically, as the craze swept over Scotland the Highland population suffered grievously from the [[Highland Clearances]], when thousands of Gaelic-speaking Scots from the Highlands and Isles were evicted by landlords (in many cases the very men who would have been their own clan chiefs) to make way for sheep.<ref name=\"Magnusson--653-654\"/>\n\n===Modern registration of clan tartans===\n[[File:Drawing of Armstrongtartan.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Clan Armstrong]] tartan]]\n\nThe naming and registration of official clan tartans began on 8 April 1815, when the [[Highland Society of London]] (founded 1778) resolved that all the clan chiefs each \"be respectfully solicited to furnish the Society with as much of the Tartan of his Lordship's Clan as will serve to Show the Pattern and to Authenticate the Same by Attaching Thereunto a Card bearing the Impression of his Lordship's Arms.\" Many had no idea of what their tartan might be, but were keen to comply and to provide authentic signed and sealed samples. Alexander Macdonald, 2nd [[Baron Macdonald]] was so far removed from his Highland heritage that he wrote to the Society: \"Being really ignorant of what is exactly The Macdonald Tartan, I request you will have the goodness to exert every Means in your power to Obtain a perfectly genuine Pattern, Such as Will Warrant me in Authenticating it with my Arms.\"\n\nToday tartan and \"clan tartan\" is an important part of a Scottish clan. Almost all Scottish clans have several tartans attributed to their name. Several clans have \"official\" tartans. Although it is possible for anyone to create a tartan and name it any name they wish, the only person with the authority to make a clan's tartan \"official\" is the chief.{{efn|Although there are many tartans attributed to the Campbells, and many tartans named ''Campbell'', there are only four tartans recognised by the current chief as [[Clan Campbell]] tartans: ''Campbell'' (a.k.a. ''Black Watch''), ''Campbell of Breadalbane'', ''Campbell of Cawdor'', and ''Campbell of Loudoun''.<ref name=\"ccsna-jsep50a\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ccsna.org/jsep50a.htm |title=Which are the authentic Campbell tartans? |accessdate=9 October 2008 |publisher=ccsna.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814041325/http://www.ccsna.org/jsep50a.htm |archive-date=14 August 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nIn some cases, following such recognition from the clan chief, the clan tartan is recorded and registered by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]].

This is the personal tartan of Queen [[Elizabeth II]]. The sett was first published in 1831 in the book ''The Scottish Gael'' by James Logan. In addition to its use in clothing, such as skirts and scarves, Royal Stewart tartan has also appeared on biscuit tins for Scottish [[shortbread]].<ref>Marketing\". p. 9. Haymarket Press, 1973</ref>\n\nAnother popular tartan is the [[List of tartans|Black Watch]] (also known as Grant Hunting, Universal, and Government).<ref name=\"MacDonald1995--48\"/> This tartan, a darkened variant of the main Clan Campbell tartan (Ancient or Old Campbell), was used and is still used by several military units in the [[British Army]] and other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] forces.\n\n<gallery mode = packed heights = 130px>\nFile:Royal Stewart tartan.png|Royal Stewart tartan\nFile:Black_Watch_or_Campbell_tartan.svg|Black Watch tartan\n</gallery>\n\n==Other tartans==\n[[File:Highland Dance 002.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Highland dancing]] at a 2005 [[Highland games]] held in the Pacific Northwest, U.S.]]\nIn addition to clan tartans, many tartan patterns have been developed for individuals, families, districts, institutions, and corporations.

By then, tartan had shifted from being mainly a component of men's clothing to become an important part of women's fashion. In consequence of its association with the British aristocracy and military, tartan developed an air of dignity and exclusivity. Because of this, tartan has made reappearances in the world of fashion several times.\n\nFor instance, tartan made a resurgence in its use in [[punk fashion]]. In the late 1970s, [[Punk rock|punk music]] was a way for youth in the British Isles to voice their discontent with the [[ruling class]]. The unorthodox use of tartan, which had long been associated with authority and [[Gentry|gentility]], was then seen as the expression of discontent against modern society.

The claimed \"rules\" are mere conventions, with different levels of importance depending on the symbolic meaning of the tartan on some particular occasion. For example, when a district tartan is worn at a football game, or a family tartan at a family event, such as the investiture of a new clan chief, the issue of wearing the event's tartan is of greater concern than wearing the same tartan when attending Highland Games where no event is scheduled where the tartan would have special significance. The same rules apply as do to wearing ''any clothing'' that prominently displays colors with national or political significance, such as un-patterned orange or green cloth in Ireland (regardless of whether it is worn as a kilt), or red, white, and blue colors at national events in France or the United States.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Scotland|United Kingdom}}\n* [[Argyle (pattern)]]\n* [[Carnegie Mellon University]], whose athletic mascot is Scotty the Scottie Dog; their athletic teams are known as \"The Tartans\"\n* [[Check (pattern)]]\n* [[Flannel]]\n* [[List of tartans]]\n* [[List of U.S. state tartans]], officially recognised tartans of states in the US (created in the 1980s)\n* [[Madras (cloth)]]\n* [[Regional tartans of Canada]], officially recognised tartans of the provinces and territories of Canada (created in the 1950s)\n* [[Sobieski Stuarts]]\n* [[Tartan Army]], popular name for the fans of the Scotland football team\n* [[Tartan Day]], a day of celebration, in Canada and the US, recognising the influence of Scottish immigration to these countries\n* [[Tartanry]]\n* ''[[Vestiarium Scoticum]]'', the Victorian forgery that is the source of many of today's clan tartans\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist|1}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== General sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |title=The Scottish Clans and Their Tartans |year=2005 |publisher=Kessinger Publishing |isbn=1-4179-6815-X |ref=A1}} (originally published by: W. & A.

Specifically they criticise the Tabligh Jamaat's neutral position towards issues in South Asia such as the introduction of an [[Constitution of Pakistan of 1956|Islamic constitution in Pakistan]] (1950s), Islam vs Socialism (1969\u20131971), communal riots in India in the 1970s and 1980s, the Khatm-e-Nabuwwat Movement (1974), and [[Tehreek Nizam-e-Mustafa|Nizam-e-Mustafa Movement]] (1977).<ref name=AMFO1994:518>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=518}}</ref> The Tablighi Jamaat, in response, states that it is only by avoiding the political debates that the Tablighi Jamaat has been successful in reawakening the spiritual conscience of the followers. The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals.

The apolitical stance also helped them operate in difficult times, such as during the governments of [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] (1960s) and [[Indira Gandhi]] (1975\u201377), when other sociopolitical Islamic groups faced restrictions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jamestown.org/program/growing-islamic-state-influence-in-pakistan-fuels-sectarian-violence/|title=Growing Islamic State Influence in Pakistan Fuels Sectarian Violence|website=Jamestown|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=AMFO1994:518/>\n\nThe difference of opinion regarding political participation also marks the fundamental difference between the Tablighi Jamaat and Islamist movements. While the Islamists believe that the acquisition of political power is the absolute requirement for the establishment of an Islamic society, the Tablighi Jamaat believes that merely the political power is not enough to ensure effective organisation of the Islamic social order.<ref name=AMFO1994:519>{{harvnb|Ahmad|1994|p=519}}</ref> The exclusive focus of the Tablighi Jamaat's attention is the individual, and members believe the reformation of society and institutions will only be effective through education and reform of individuals.

The network initially evolved from a privately operated system of feeder services to railway stations in the outer suburbs, and a publicly operated network of bus services introduced to replace trams in the inner suburbs. The bus network has undergone major reform in recent years, with the New South Wales Government taking responsibility for route and fare-setting, opening contracts for most routes up to competitive tendering, and introducing more cross-regional services.\n\nThe New South Wales Government's transport authority, [[Transport for NSW]], administers the various bus networks in Sydney.\n* [[Commuter bus]] services including [[Metrobus (Sydney)|Metrobus]] and On Demand routes.\n* [[NightRide]], a network of train replacement services that operates each night between midnight and 5am.\n* [[Sydney Olympic Park bus routes]], a network of nine routes used to convey passengers to major events at the precinct\n* School buses.\nThe networks, except the Olympic Park and On Demand routes, are part of Transport for NSW's [[Opal ticketing system]].\n\nCommuter and school services are assigned to one of [[Sydney Metropolitan Bus Service Contracts|14 contract regions]]. In the 2018-19 financial year, 280.6 million passenger journeys were made on services in Sydney's bus contract regions.<ref name=\"TfNSW Opal figures\"/>\n\n== History ==\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Sydney's public transport network was composed of a suburban railway and inner-city trams, both operated by the [[New South Wales Government Railways]]. These were complemented by various privately operated ferry services on [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and the [[Parramatta River]], and a few horse-drawn services.\n\nThe Railways experimented with a steam-powered bus service from [[Potts Point]] to [[Darlinghurst]] in 1905, but the vehicles quickly proved unsatisfactory and the service was shut down within a year.<ref name=lee>{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Robert|title=Transport: an Australian history|date=2010|publisher=UNSW Press|location=Sydney}}</ref> The city's second bus route ran from [[Newport, New South Wales|Newport]], in the north of the [[Northern Beaches]] district, to [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]], commencing in 1906. This was operated by the privately owned Manly-Pittwater Motor Omnibus Company. The company did not prosper, however, and the business was wound up in 1908.<ref>{{cite web|last1=JMacR|title=Manly's first bus|url=http://manlylocalstudies.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/manlys-first-bus.html|website=Manly Library Local Studies Blog|accessdate=6 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe return of servicemen from [[World War I]] in the late 1910s provided fresh impetus to the motor omnibus industry. Here, suddenly, were thousands of men with experience working with heavy vehicles \u2013 all looking for work.<ref name=nla>{{cite web| first1=Margaret | last1=Simpson | date=2006|title=New South Wales Government and private bus ticket collection | publication-date=1960 | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/192444483 | accessdate=6 March 2016 }}</ref> In 1915, only 15 motorised buses were known to operate in Sydney. By 1929, the city's bus fleet numbered more than 600. A private bus industry, dominated by owner-operators and small family businesses, was taking shape.<ref name=lee />\n\nSeeking to protect the tram system from competition, [[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]] [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]] introduced the ''Transport Act 1930'', which empowered a new Metropolitan Transport Trust to shut down private bus routes that competed with trams, trains or other buses. The Railways were also restructured, with the tram system hived off into a new Department of Road Transport & Tramways in 1932.<ref>{{cite web|title=Department of Road Transport & Tramways|url=http://search-cloudfront.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/537|author=State Records Authority of New South Wales|access-date=3 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201155845/http://search-cloudfront.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/537|archive-date=1 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Department introduced its first bus service, [[Sydney bus route 144|route 144]] from [[St Leonards, New South Wales|St Leonards]] to Manly, on Christmas Day of that year.\n\nLang's reforms established a structure for the bus network that was to endure for close to a century. On the one hand, the Department \u2013 forerunner to today's [[State Transit Authority]] \u2013 began to shut down its trams and build an extensive bus network serving the inner suburbs and Northern Beaches. On the other, the heavily regulated private operators remained small-scale, relegated to the status of feeder services for the Government's trains. But Lang's draconian Transport Act held at least one benefit for the bus companies: just as the trams were protected from them, so too were they protected from new entrants to the industry.<ref name=lee />\n\n=== From trams to buses ===\nRoute [[Sydney bus route 144|144]] started as a service in the 1920s connecting trains, trams and ferries. But the Department's focus began to shift inexorably towards building its bus network, starting in 1937 when [[Kogarah]]'s steam trams were replaced with [[Trolleybuses in Sydney|trolleybuses]]. Two years later, tram services from Manly were replaced with buses. In 1948, a recommendation was handed to the Department that the entire network be replaced with buses. Though initially controversial, the move to a bus network secured broad political support and was completed between 1957 and 1961. The Department, renamed 'Government Transport' in 1952, became an operator of buses only.<ref name=lee /><ref>{{cite web|title=Department of Government Tram and Omnibus Services (1952) / Department of Government Transport (1952-1972)|url=http://search-cloudfront.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/538|author=State Records Authority of New South Wales}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nFor much of the 20th century, land use planning in Sydney restricted development to corridors within a short distance of the existing railway lines. This discipline broke down in the 1980s, however, when the [[Wran ministry (1983-84)|Wran Government]] released [[Sydney Into Its Third Century|new areas for development]] far from existing rail lines.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sydney Into Its Third Century: Metropolitan Strategy for the Sydney Region |year=1988|author=Department of Environment & Planning|location=Sydney|author-link=Department of Planning and Environment (New South Wales)}}</ref><ref name=\"dos\">{{cite web |url= http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/planning |title = Planning | first1=Paul | last1=Ashton | first2=Robert | last2=Freestone | date = 2008 |work = Dictionary of Sydney |publisher = Dictionary of Sydney Trust}}</ref> This meant that buses outside of the inner-city, government-operated network, would play an increasing role in meeting Sydney's transport needs.\n\nLang's model divided the city into hundreds of exclusive fiefdoms and did not allow for cross-regional services. Some private operators responded with joint ventures under the \"Red Arrow\" brand, agreeing to jointly operate routes between major centres in each other's territories. Some of these routes survive in whole or part today.\n\n=== Contracts ===\nFrom 1930 until 1990, private bus companies in Sydney operated as licensed local monopolies, with a relatively free hand to set fares, determine routes, set service levels and choose vehicles. The [[Greiner-Murray ministry (1988-91)|Greiner Government]] changed this with the introduction of the ''Passenger Transport Act 1990''. Although the government was loth to challenge the operators' local dominance, it insisted on forming contractual relationships between bus companies and the Department of Transport. These formed the basis for improvements to service standards and \u2013 in time \u2013 would allow the Government to consolidate the industry and create a truly integrated public transport network. The Government also dismantled one of the shibboleths of the Lang era, allowing [[Forest Coach Lines]] and [[Westbus]] to run direct services to the City, rather than just the nearest train station. In 1992, an inbound bus lane was installed on the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] to facilitate the additional services.\n\n=== Unsworth review ===\nDevelopment in the [[Hills District|Hills]] and [[Forest District (Sydney)|Forest]] districts, far from railway lines, meant that long-distance private bus services poured across the Harbour Bridge to the City each morning. The growth of employment centres outside of the City and inner suburbs, including the growing significance of Parramatta, meant that more and more commuters were making cross-regional, rather than suburb-to-city, trips. Finally, the profusion of bus networks \u2013 in 2004, they numbered more than 80 \u2013 was confusing to planners and passengers alike. In return for their acceptance of limits to their operations, the small family-owned bus companies had enjoyed immunity from competition themselves. The result was a disparity in fares, vehicles and service quality across Sydney.\n\nThe Government commissioned a report into the bus network from former premier [[Barrie Unsworth]]. This report, released in 2004, formed a blueprint for major changes to the bus network, including:\n* harmonisation of private and State Transit fares\n* consolidation of bus regions and competitive tendering for rights to operate\n* introduction of new, cross-regional routes.\n\nConsolidation of bus contract regions, from more than 80 to just 15, forced the amalgamation of decades-old bus companies and cleared the way for the entry of players from interstate and overseas.\n\nStarting in October 2008 a number of Metrobus routes were introduced.\n\nCross-regional connectivity received further boosts with the completion of dedicated T-way networks, between [[Liverpool-Parramatta T-way|Liverpool and Parramatta]] and between [[North-West T-way|Parramatta, Blacktown and Rouse Hill]].\n\n==Contract regions==\n{{main|Sydney Metropolitan Bus Service Contracts}}\nMost services are provided under a service contract between the operator and Transport for NSW.

Hillsbus uses this suffix for services via [[Lane Cove Tunnel]]).\n*'''Any other letter''' - Used by some operators to denote the destination of routes with more than two termini. For example, the suffixes W and K are used by [[Busabout Sydney|Busabout]] to denote variants of routes 884 and 883 that service [[Wedderburn, New South Wales|Wedderburn]] and [[Kentlyn, New South Wales|Kentlyn]] respectively.\n\nState Transit and Transit Systems Region 6 school bus services are suffixed with '''N''' ([[Sydney Metropolitan Bus_Service Contracts#Region_8|Region 8]]), '''S''' ([[Sydney Metropolitan Bus_Service Contracts#Region_6|Region 6]]), '''E''' ([[Sydney Metropolitan Bus_Service Contracts#Region_9|Region 9]]) and '''W''' ([[Sydney Metropolitan Bus_Service Contracts#Region_7|Region 7]]).

These replacement services are contracted out to a bus company by [[Sydney Trains]]. Because it is impossible for one bus company to provide enough buses, the company will then subcontract some of the work to other bus companies.\nOn most of these services, no fare is charged as these routes are not programmed into the Opal system and there is no requirement for buses provided to have Opal equipment installed. However, this is slowly changing, with some rail replacement services now having Opal set up to charge rail fares.\n\nThe routes are defined by Sydney Trains, with route numbers consisting of one or two digits, optionally followed by \"A\" (usually indicates short working variant), then the train line the route replaces.

The network initially evolved from a privately operated system of feeder services to railway stations in the outer suburbs, and a publicly operated network of bus services introduced to replace trams in the inner suburbs. The bus network has undergone major reform in recent years, with the New South Wales Government taking responsibility for route and fare-setting, opening contracts for most routes up to competitive tendering, and introducing more cross-regional services.\n\nThe New South Wales Government's transport authority, [[Transport for NSW]], administers the various bus networks in Sydney.\n* [[Commuter bus]] services including [[Metrobus (Sydney)|Metrobus]] and On Demand routes.\n* [[NightRide]], a network of train replacement services that operates each night between midnight and 5am.\n* [[Sydney Olympic Park bus routes]], a network of nine routes used to convey passengers to major events at the precinct\n* School buses.\nThe networks, except the Olympic Park and On Demand routes, are part of Transport for NSW's [[Opal ticketing system]].\n\nCommuter and school services are assigned to one of [[Sydney Metropolitan Bus Service Contracts|14 contract regions]]. In the 2018-19 financial year, 280.6 million passenger journeys were made on services in Sydney's bus contract regions.<ref name=\"TfNSW Opal figures\"/>\n\n== History ==\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, Sydney's public transport network was composed of a suburban railway and inner-city trams, both operated by the [[New South Wales Government Railways]]. These were complemented by various privately operated ferry services on [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]] and the [[Parramatta River]], and a few horse-drawn services.\n\nThe Railways experimented with a steam-powered bus service from [[Potts Point]] to [[Darlinghurst]] in 1905, but the vehicles quickly proved unsatisfactory and the service was shut down within a year.<ref name=lee>{{cite book|last1=Lee|first1=Robert|title=Transport: an Australian history|date=2010|publisher=UNSW Press|location=Sydney}}</ref> The city's second bus route ran from [[Newport, New South Wales|Newport]], in the north of the [[Northern Beaches]] district, to [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]], commencing in 1906. This was operated by the privately owned Manly-Pittwater Motor Omnibus Company. The company did not prosper, however, and the business was wound up in 1908.<ref>{{cite web|last1=JMacR|title=Manly's first bus|url=http://manlylocalstudies.blogspot.com.au/2012/12/manlys-first-bus.html|website=Manly Library Local Studies Blog|accessdate=6 March 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe return of servicemen from [[World War I]] in the late 1910s provided fresh impetus to the motor omnibus industry. Here, suddenly, were thousands of men with experience working with heavy vehicles \u2013 all looking for work.<ref name=nla>{{cite web| first1=Margaret | last1=Simpson | date=2006|title=New South Wales Government and private bus ticket collection | publication-date=1960 | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/192444483 | accessdate=6 March 2016 }}</ref> In 1915, only 15 motorised buses were known to operate in Sydney. By 1929, the city's bus fleet numbered more than 600. A private bus industry, dominated by owner-operators and small family businesses, was taking shape.<ref name=lee />\n\nSeeking to protect the tram system from competition, [[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]] [[Jack Lang (Australian politician)|Jack Lang]] introduced the ''Transport Act 1930'', which empowered a new Metropolitan Transport Trust to shut down private bus routes that competed with trams, trains or other buses. The Railways were also restructured, with the tram system hived off into a new Department of Road Transport & Tramways in 1932.<ref>{{cite web|title=Department of Road Transport & Tramways|url=http://search-cloudfront.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/537|author=State Records Authority of New South Wales|access-date=3 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201155845/http://search-cloudfront.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/537|archive-date=1 February 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Department introduced its first bus service, [[Sydney bus route 144|route 144]] from [[St Leonards, New South Wales|St Leonards]] to Manly, on Christmas Day of that year.\n\nLang's reforms established a structure for the bus network that was to endure for close to a century. On the one hand, the Department \u2013 forerunner to today's [[State Transit Authority]] \u2013 began to shut down its trams and build an extensive bus network serving the inner suburbs and Northern Beaches. On the other, the heavily regulated private operators remained small-scale, relegated to the status of feeder services for the Government's trains. But Lang's draconian Transport Act held at least one benefit for the bus companies: just as the trams were protected from them, so too were they protected from new entrants to the industry.<ref name=lee />\n\n=== From trams to buses ===\nRoute [[Sydney bus route 144|144]] started as a service in the 1920s connecting trains, trams and ferries. But the Department's focus began to shift inexorably towards building its bus network, starting in 1937 when [[Kogarah]]'s steam trams were replaced with [[Trolleybuses in Sydney|trolleybuses]]. Two years later, tram services from Manly were replaced with buses. In 1948, a recommendation was handed to the Department that the entire network be replaced with buses. Though initially controversial, the move to a bus network secured broad political support and was completed between 1957 and 1961. The Department, renamed 'Government Transport' in 1952, became an operator of buses only.<ref name=lee /><ref>{{cite web|title=Department of Government Tram and Omnibus Services (1952) / Department of Government Transport (1952-1972)|url=http://search-cloudfront.records.nsw.gov.au/agencies/538|author=State Records Authority of New South Wales}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nFor much of the 20th century, land use planning in Sydney restricted development to corridors within a short distance of the existing railway lines. This discipline broke down in the 1980s, however, when the [[Wran ministry (1983-84)|Wran Government]] released [[Sydney Into Its Third Century|new areas for development]] far from existing rail lines.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sydney Into Its Third Century: Metropolitan Strategy for the Sydney Region |year=1988|author=Department of Environment & Planning|location=Sydney|author-link=Department of Planning and Environment (New South Wales)}}</ref><ref name=\"dos\">{{cite web |url= http://dictionaryofsydney.org/entry/planning |title = Planning | first1=Paul | last1=Ashton | first2=Robert | last2=Freestone | date = 2008 |work = Dictionary of Sydney |publisher = Dictionary of Sydney Trust}}</ref> This meant that buses outside of the inner-city, government-operated network, would play an increasing role in meeting Sydney's transport needs.\n\nLang's model divided the city into hundreds of exclusive fiefdoms and did not allow for cross-regional services. Some private operators responded with joint ventures under the \"Red Arrow\" brand, agreeing to jointly operate routes between major centres in each other's territories. Some of these routes survive in whole or part today.\n\n=== Contracts ===\nFrom 1930 until 1990, private bus companies in Sydney operated as licensed local monopolies, with a relatively free hand to set fares, determine routes, set service levels and choose vehicles. The [[Greiner-Murray ministry (1988-91)|Greiner Government]] changed this with the introduction of the ''Passenger Transport Act 1990''. Although the government was loth to challenge the operators' local dominance, it insisted on forming contractual relationships between bus companies and the Department of Transport. These formed the basis for improvements to service standards and \u2013 in time \u2013 would allow the Government to consolidate the industry and create a truly integrated public transport network. The Government also dismantled one of the shibboleths of the Lang era, allowing [[Forest Coach Lines]] and [[Westbus]] to run direct services to the City, rather than just the nearest train station. In 1992, an inbound bus lane was installed on the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] to facilitate the additional services.\n\n=== Unsworth review ===\nDevelopment in the [[Hills District|Hills]] and [[Forest District (Sydney)|Forest]] districts, far from railway lines, meant that long-distance private bus services poured across the Harbour Bridge to the City each morning. The growth of employment centres outside of the City and inner suburbs, including the growing significance of Parramatta, meant that more and more commuters were making cross-regional, rather than suburb-to-city, trips. Finally, the profusion of bus networks \u2013 in 2004, they numbered more than 80 \u2013 was confusing to planners and passengers alike. In return for their acceptance of limits to their operations, the small family-owned bus companies had enjoyed immunity from competition themselves. The result was a disparity in fares, vehicles and service quality across Sydney.\n\nThe Government commissioned a report into the bus network from former premier [[Barrie Unsworth]]. This report, released in 2004, formed a blueprint for major changes to the bus network, including:\n* harmonisation of private and State Transit fares\n* consolidation of bus regions and competitive tendering for rights to operate\n* introduction of new, cross-regional routes.\n\nConsolidation of bus contract regions, from more than 80 to just 15, forced the amalgamation of decades-old bus companies and cleared the way for the entry of players from interstate and overseas.\n\nStarting in October 2008 a number of Metrobus routes were introduced.\n\nCross-regional connectivity received further boosts with the completion of dedicated T-way networks, between [[Liverpool-Parramatta T-way|Liverpool and Parramatta]] and between [[North-West T-way|Parramatta, Blacktown and Rouse Hill]].\n\n==Contract regions==\n{{main|Sydney Metropolitan Bus Service Contracts}}\nMost services are provided under a service contract between the operator and Transport for NSW.

These replacement services are contracted out to a bus company by [[Sydney Trains]]. Because it is impossible for one bus company to provide enough buses, the company will then subcontract some of the work to other bus companies.\nOn most of these services, no fare is charged as these routes are not programmed into the Opal system and there is no requirement for buses provided to have Opal equipment installed. However, this is slowly changing, with some rail replacement services now having Opal set up to charge rail fares.\n\nThe routes are defined by Sydney Trains, with route numbers consisting of one or two numbers, optionally followed by A (usually indicates short working variant), then the train line the route replaces. Examples include 35T3, 61T8 etc.\n\n==On Demand services==\nSince late 2017 a number of On Demand services have been introduced throughout the metropolitan and outer metropolitan bus regions.
