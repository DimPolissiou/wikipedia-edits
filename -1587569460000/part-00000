It is at the same level as a prefecture for administrative purposes. It contains the [[Lhasa|Chengguan District]], [[Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District]], [[Dagz\u00ea District]], and other rural areas.{{sfn|Barnett|1996|p=82}}}} ({{zh|s=\u62c9\u8428\u5e02|t=\u62c9\u85a9\u5e02|p=L\u0101s\u00e0 Sh\u00ec}}) is a [[prefecture-level city]], one of the main administrative divisions of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of [[China]]. It covers an area of {{convert|29274|km2}} of rugged and sparsely populated terrain. Its capital and largest city is [[Lhasa]], with around 300,000 residents, which mostly corresponds with the administrative Chengguan District, while its suburbs extend into [[Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District]] and [[Dagz\u00ea District]]. The consolidated prefecture-level city contains additional five, mostly rural, counties.\n\nThe city boundaries roughly correspond to the basin of the [[Lhasa River]], a major tributary of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River]]. It lies on the [[Lhasa terrane]], the last unit of crust to accrete to the Eurasian plate before the continent of India collided with Asia about 50 million years ago and pushed up the [[Himalayas]]. The terrane is high, contains a complex pattern of faults and is tectonically active. The temperature is generally warm in summer and rises above freezing on sunny days in winter. Most of the rain falls in summer. The upland areas and northern grasslands are used for grazing yaks, sheep and goats, while the river valleys support agriculture with crops such as barley, wheat and vegetables. Wildlife is not abundant, but includes the rare [[snow leopard]] and [[black-necked crane]]. Mining has caused some environmental problems.\n\nThe 2000 census gave a total population of 474,490, of whom 387,124 were ethnic Tibetans. The Han Chinese population at the time was mainly concentrated in urban areas. The prefecture-level city is traversed by two major highways and by the [[Qinghai\u2013Tibet railway]], which terminates in the city of Lhasa. Two large dams on the Lhasa River deliver hydroelectric power, as do many smaller dams and the [[Yangbajain Geothermal Station|Yangbajain Geothermal Field]]. The population is well-served by primary schools and basic medical facilities, although more advanced facilities are lacking. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and monastic life have been dominant aspects of the local culture since the 7th century. Most of the monasteries were destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]], but since then many have been restored and serve as tourist attractions.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\nLhasa lies in south-central Tibet, to the north of the Himalayas.\nThe prefecture-level city is {{convert|277|km}} from east to west and {{convert|202|km}} from north to south.

It is at the same level as a prefecture for administrative purposes. It contains the [[Lhasa|Chengguan District]], [[Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District]], [[Dagz\u00ea District]], and other rural areas.{{sfn|Barnett|1996|p=82}}}} ({{zh|s=\u62c9\u8428\u5e02|\u62c9\u85a9\u5e02|p=L\u0101s\u00e0 Sh\u00ec}}) is a [[prefecture-level city]], one of the main administrative divisions of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] of [[China]]. It covers an area of {{convert|29274|km2}} of rugged and sparsely populated terrain. Its capital and largest city is [[Lhasa]], with around 300,000 residents, which mostly corresponds with the administrative Chengguan District, while its suburbs extend into [[Doilungd\u00eaq\u00ean District]] and [[Dagz\u00ea District]]. The consolidated prefecture-level city contains additional five, mostly rural, counties.\n\nThe city boundaries roughly correspond to the basin of the [[Lhasa River]], a major tributary of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River]]. It lies on the [[Lhasa terrane]], the last unit of crust to accrete to the Eurasian plate before the continent of India collided with Asia about 50 million years ago and pushed up the [[Himalayas]]. The terrane is high, contains a complex pattern of faults and is tectonically active. The temperature is generally warm in summer and rises above freezing on sunny days in winter. Most of the rain falls in summer. The upland areas and northern grasslands are used for grazing yaks, sheep and goats, while the river valleys support agriculture with crops such as barley, wheat and vegetables. Wildlife is not abundant, but includes the rare [[snow leopard]] and [[black-necked crane]]. Mining has caused some environmental problems.\n\nThe 2000 census gave a total population of 474,490, of whom 387,124 were ethnic Tibetans. The Han Chinese population at the time was mainly concentrated in urban areas. The prefecture-level city is traversed by two major highways and by the [[Qinghai\u2013Tibet railway]], which terminates in the city of Lhasa. Two large dams on the Lhasa River deliver hydroelectric power, as do many smaller dams and the [[Yangbajain Geothermal Station|Yangbajain Geothermal Field]]. The population is well-served by primary schools and basic medical facilities, although more advanced facilities are lacking. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] and monastic life have been dominant aspects of the local culture since the 7th century. Most of the monasteries were destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]], but since then many have been restored and serve as tourist attractions.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\nLhasa lies in south-central Tibet, to the north of the Himalayas.\nThe prefecture-level city is {{convert|277|km}} from east to west and {{convert|202|km}} from north to south. It covers an area of {{convert|29518|km2}}.{{sfn|Lhasa, Baidu Baike}}\nIt is bordered by [[Nagqu]] City to the north, [[Nyingchi]] City to the east, [[Shannan, Tibet|Shannan]]/Lhoka City to the south and [[Shigatse|Xigaz\u00ea]] City to the west.{{sfn|Tibet Maps, ChinaTourGuide}}\nThe prefecture-level city roughly corresponds to the basin of the [[Lhasa River]], which is the center of Tibet politically, economically and culturally.{{sfn|Shen|1995|p=151}} Chengguan District is also the center of Tibet in terms of transport, communications, education and religion, as well as being the most developed part of Tibet and a major tourist destination with sights such as the [[Potala Palace]], [[Jokhang]] and [[Ramoche Temple]].{{sfn|Chengguan District of Lhasa, Baidu Baike}}\n\n===Lhasa River basin===\n[[File:Tibet-6080 (2695594944).jpg|thumb|[[Lhasa River]] to the south of [[Lhasa]]]]\n\nLhasa prefecture-level city roughly corresponds to the basin of the [[Lhasa River]], a major tributary of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River]]. Exceptions are the north of [[Damxung County]], which crosses the watershed of the [[Nyenchen Tanglha Mountains]] and includes part of the [[Namtso]] lake,{{sfn|Damxung, Baidu Baike}}{{efn|Namtso lake is the second-largest salt lake in China.

This division was the only division formed outside of United States territory during World War II (a distinction it would repeat when reformed during the Vietnam War).<ref>Stanton, Shelby. ''The Rise and Fall of an American Army''. Presidio Press, 1985. p. 186.</ref> At the suggestion of a subordinate, the division's commander, [[Major General]] [[Alexander Patch]], requested that the new unit be known as the ''Americal Division''\u2014the name being a contraction of '''\"American, New Caledonian Division\"'''. This was unusual, as all other U.S. divisions are known by a number. After World War II the Americal Division was officially re-designated as the 23rd Infantry Division. However, it was rarely referred to as such, even on official orders.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War the division had a mixed record. It combined solid service in numerous battles and campaigns with the [[My Lai massacre]], which was committed by a platoon of the division's subordinate 11th Infantry Brigade, led by Lieutenant [[William Calley]].\n\nThe Division also had another setback on the early morning of 28 March 1971, Vietcong sapper commandos sneaked into [[Battle of FSB Mary Ann|FSB Mary Ann]], proceeded to throw explosives and tear gas, knife sleeping soldiers and blowing up key infrastructure delaying rescue. This attack caused 116 casualties leaving 33 killed and 83 wounded.<ref name=\"Nolan, Keith William 2007\">{{Cite book|title=Sappers in the wire : the life and death of Firebase Mary Ann|author=Nolan, Keith William|date=2007|origyear=1995|publisher=Texas A & M University Press|oclc=647013278}}</ref>\n\nThe division was inactivated following its withdrawal from Vietnam in November 1971.\n\n==Operations in World War II==\nThe [[164th Infantry Regiment (United States)|164th Infantry Regiment]] of the Americal Division went into action on Guadalcanal on 13 October 1942 alongside the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] as the first United States Army unit to conduct an offensive operation against the enemy in either the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific]] or [[European Theater of Operations, United States Army|European Theater of Operations]] during [[World War II]]. Eight other U.S. Army divisions began offensive combat operations in late 1942: the [[32nd Infantry Division (United States)|32nd]] and the [[41st Infantry Division (United States)|41st Infantry Division]]s in the Pacific on [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]]; and in [[Operation Torch|North Africa]], the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st]], [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd]], [[9th Infantry Division (United States)|9th]], and [[34th Infantry Division (United States)|34th Infantry Division]]s, and the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st]] and [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|2nd Armored Division]]s.)\n{{command structure\n|name= Americal Division\n|date=May\u2013August 1942\n|parent= \n|subordinate=\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, Task Force 6814 (including attached Division Surgeon's Office)\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 51st Infantry Brigade\n* 132nd Infantry Regiment, less Cannon Company\n* 164th Infantry Regiment, less Cannon Company\n* 182nd Infantry Regiment, less Cannon Company\n* 1 platoon, 39th Military Police Company\n* 26th Signal Company\n* 72nd Field Artllery Regiment (105 mm)\n* 200th Field Artillery Regiment (155 mm)\n* 57th Engineer Combat Battalion\n* 101st Medical Regiment (less two companies and Division Surgeon's Office)\n}}\n===Formation===\nAs the \"[[square division|square]]\" [[division (military)|divisions]] of the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] were being transitioned to the [[triangular division]] [[Table of Organization and Equipment|TO&E]] in 1942, they each \"shed\" an [[infantry]] regiment, leaving several trained and operational \"orphan\" regiments available for independent service.\n\nThe \"[[line infantry|line]]\" regiments selected to form the Americal Division were the [[132nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|132nd Infantry Regiment]] from Illinois, formerly part of the [[33rd Infantry Division (United States)|33rd Infantry Division]], the [[164th Infantry Regiment (United States)|164th Infantry Regiment]] from [[North Dakota]], formerly part of the [[34th Infantry Division (United States)|34th Infantry Division]], and the [[182nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|182nd Infantry Regiment]] from [[Massachusetts]], formerly part of the [[26th Infantry Division (United States)|26th Infantry Division]].\n\n===New Caledonia===\nNew Caledonia, a likely target for the Japanese for its critical strategic position on the lines of communication with New Zealand and Australia and its nickel and chromium mines, was now under the control of the Free French with a poorly equipped and trained native force and a company of Australian commandos.\n\nThe United States Army was already building airfields with Australian labor on the island which according to early agreements fell into the British sphere and delegated to the Australians for defense. The French objected to the arrangement and, increasingly worried about Japanese invasion being attracted by the airfield, demanded additional American forces.\n\nWith pressing needs to build up defenses in Hawaii and Australia, Army planners decided to put together a force rather than commit an already organized division. The regiments available through the reorganization of divisions along with other elements made available a force of about 15,000 men. This force, designated Task Force 6814 and often mentioned as Poppy Force (New Caledonia was code named Poppy), under Brigadier General [[Alexander Patch|Alexander M. Patch, Jr.]] had the elements of a division and more in its composition. For example, there was a brigade headquarters from the 26th Division, two infantry regiments and a field artillery regiment along with support elements augmented by a battalion of light tanks, antiaircraft and coast artillery regiments and a pursuit squadron. The force's mission was to hold New Caledonia.  It was an independent command, directly under the War Department in Washington.{{sfn|Morton|1962|pp=204\u2013212}}{{sfn|Leighton|1955-68|pp=177\u2013185}}\n\nWithin two weeks, despite an urgent need of shipping elsewhere and at the cost of delaying and rearranging schedules elsewhere and consultations at the head of state level, Task Force 6814 along with some 4,000 troops destined for Australia were assembled in the largest single troop convoy up until that time, designated BT-200 and totaling over 20,000 troops aboard seven transports,.<ref group=note>The transports were: [[SS Argentina (1929)|''Argentina'']] (1929) {{GRT|20,614}}, [http://www.angelfire.com/cantina/que_pasa/Retirement.html ''Cristobal'' (1939) {{GRT|10,021}}], [[USAT J.

General Patch, preceding the force by air, had arrived on 5 March with news for the French that American forces were underway. Despite having no early prospect of reinforcements, another infantry regiment arrived in April, along with the authority to organize an infantry division from elements of the overall force and, in May, the Americal Division was organized.{{sfn|Morton|1962|pp=204\u2013212}}{{sfn|Leighton|1955-68|pp=177\u2013185}}\n\nOn 14 March 1942, two days after the task force later to be known as the Americal Division landed in Noum\u00e9a, New Caledonia, the 182nd Infantry was detailed to provide a special unit to be called Force A for advance occupation and outpost of the New Hebrides, a group of islands lying directly across the supply to United States.\n\nAssigned to this duty were companies L and M and attached elements from Headquarters Company, Service Company, the Medical Detachment plus a platoon of the 101st Engineers.\n\nThe total strength being in the vicinity of 480 men was under the command of Brigadier General Rose. That a brigadier general should be placed in command of two infantry rifle companies indicated the degree of importance, and hazard, that G.H.Q. placed upon the mission.<ref>comment from the source, a personal diary of 2nd Lt. R.M. Whittet 1941\u20131944 A 330391</ref> Mainly though it was so he could deal directly with the highest local French authorities.\n\nThe men were assembled and told that Force A and 50 Australians held the most advanced outpost of the Allied Forces in the South Pacific along with Australian forces at Port Moresby, Papua. No retreat was possible, no reinforcements could be relied on. Supply was unreliable and limited.\n\nOn 28 March 1942, a unit of Force A left an isolated coconut plantation called Euralia for Port Havanah with two 2nd lieutenants and 22 men on a small auxiliary sailboat with equipment and 10 days' rations to begin their 'guerrilla' action by gathering the native headhunters and plantation workers from the nearby islands as reinforcements.{{command structure\n|name= Americal Division\n|date=August 1942-May 1943\n|parent= \n|subordinate=\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, Task Force 6814 (including attached Division Surgeon's Office)\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 51st Infantry Brigade\n* 132nd Infantry Regiment, less Cannon Company\n* 164th Infantry Regiment, less Cannon Company\n* 182nd Infantry Regiment, less Cannon Company\n* 1 platoon, 39th Military Police Company\n* 26th Signal Company\n* Headquarters, American Division Artillery (activated 26 October 1942)\n* 221st Field Artillery Battalion (155 mm)\n* 223rd Field Artillery Battalion (155 mm) (relieved from division 26 February 1943)\n* 245th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n* 246th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n* 247th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n* 57th Engineer Combat Battalion\n* 101st Medical Regiment (less two companies and Division Surgeon's Office)\n}}\n===Guadalcanal===\n{{Main|Battle of Guadalcanal}}\nIn contrast to several other US Army divisions in the [[Pacific War]], soldiers in the Americal division received extensive weapons training as well as company- and battalion-level exercises in jungle terrain while at [[New Caledonia]]. Under the command of General Patch, the Americal Division was the first US Army unit to be sent to [[Guadalcanal]].  Largely because of transport constraints, the Americal arrived piecemeal and was fed into combat alongside the battle-hardened and exhausted [[1st Marine Division (United States)|US 1st Marine Division]], which it eventually relieved. Its soldiers were quick to assimilate from the Marines on Guadalcanal lessons on battle tactics against Japanese forces. Americal casualties were consequently less than what might be expected.\n\nThe 164th Infantry Regiment landed on Guadalcanal on 13 October 1942 ahead of its brother regiments, as emergency reinforcement for the 1st Marine Division.  The Regiment was the first U.S. Army unit to engage in offensive action during World War II as part of the Battle of Guadalcanal. Between 24 and 27 October, elements of the regiment withstood repeated assaults from Japanese battalions and inflicted some two thousand enemy casualties; the 164th also supported and participated in Marine attacks. The First Marine Division's commander, Major General A. A. Vandegrift, was so impressed by the soldiers' stand that he issued a unit commendation to the regiment for having demonstrated \"an overwhelming superiority over the enemy.\" In addition, General Vandegrift took the unusual step of awarding Lt. Colonel Robert Hall, commander of the 3rd Battalion, 164th, with the Navy Cross for his role in these battles. The 164th was then occasionally referred to as the '164th Marines' due to their special relationship with the Marines on Guadalcanal.\n\nIn November the 164th took part in the offensive across the [[Matanikau River]]. Other elements of the division arrived piecemeal in the last few weeks of 1942.\n\nIn January 1943, the 132nd Infantry Regiment of the division took Hill 27 and 31 of the [[Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse|Mount Austen]] complex. The division later participated in offensives to sweep Guadalcanal of remaining Japanese resistance. After the last Japanese defenders were killed, captured, or evacuated from the island, the division was relieved on 9 February 1943.\n\nDespite its ad-hoc formation, the Americal Division fought well at Guadalcanal. The 164th Regiment took part in repulsing a major Japanese offensive in October 1942, while the 132nd Regiment, along with the 25th Infantry Division assaulted the highly fortified Japanese Gifu defensive complex at [[Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse|Mount Austen]] in January 1943. Historians describe the Americal Division as the most effective of all the US Army divisions in that campaign. Following the withdrawal of the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]], the division continued operations on Guadalcanal as part of the [[XIV Corps (United States)|U.S. XIV Corps]] with the 25th Infantry Division (who later earned their 'Tropic Lightning' nickname here) and the 2nd Marine Division (Arrived earlier as reinforcements to the 1st MarDiv) until all of the Japanese resistance had ended.\n\n===Bougainville===\n{{Main| Bougainville campaign (1943\u201345)}}\n{{command structure\n|name= Americal Division <ref>https://history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/cbtchron/infcomp.html Component Elements of the Infantry Divisions in World War II</ref>\n|date=May 1943-December 1945\n|parent= \n|subordinate=\n* Headquarters, Americal Division\n* [[132nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|132nd Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[164th Infantry Regiment (United States)|164th Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[182nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|182nd Infantry Regiment]]\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, Americal Division Artillery\n** 221st Field Artillery Battalion ([[M114 155 mm howitzer|155 mm]])\n** 245th Field Artillery Battalion ([[M101 howitzer|105 mm]])\n** 246th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n** 247th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n* 57th [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Engineer]] Combat Battalion\n* 121st [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|Medical]] Battalion\n* 21st Cavalry [[Reconnaissance]] Troop (Mechanized)\n* Headquarters, Special Troops, Americal Division\n** Headquarters Company, Americal Division\n** 721st [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance]] Light Maintenance Company\n** 125th [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|Quartermaster]] Company\n** 26th [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal]] Company\n** Military Police Platoon\n** Band\n* 182nd [[Counterintelligence Corps]] Detachment\n}}\nThe division next moved to the [[Fiji]] Islands, beginning 5 March 1943, to assume the defense of the main island of [[Viti Levu]] and to engage in extensive training.\n\nDuring the period 25 December 1943 to 12 January 1944 the Americal Division landed on [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]], relieving the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]]. They were given the task (alongside the [[37th Infantry Division (United States)|37th Infantry Division]] and a Marine defense battalion) of holding and extending the right half of a previously established perimeter.\n\nWarned by intelligence, they met a massive and sustained Japanese counter-attack, which began on 7 March 1944. Despite ample warning and thorough defensive preparations, the battle soon degenerated into a bitter, close-quarters infantry affair, with artillery restricted by the need to avoid friendly troops and tanks unable to reach the scene. The 37th and Americal Divisions stood firm, and by 25 March, the Japanese were forced to retreat. It was the last Japanese ground offensive in the South Pacific.\n\nThe division went on the offensive in March 1944, driving the Japanese east of [[Mavavia River]], 7\u20139 April 1944, and seizing numerous strategic hill bases during the remainder of the month. Training and long-range patrol activity continued until 30 November 1944 when the division was relieved.\n\n===Philippines===\n{{Main| Battle of Leyte}}\nOn 8 January 1945, the division began movement to [[Leyte Island|Leyte]] and [[Samar Island|Samar]], to take part in cleaning out remaining Japanese forces on those islands, and to invade [[Biri, Northern Samar|Biri]], [[Capul]], [[Ticao Island|Ticao]], and [[Burias (island)|Burias]]. On Leyte, the division was relieved on 13 March 1945 and then landed on [[Cebu Island|Cebu]] on 26 March, and seized the city and airfield by 28 March. Divisional combat teams made landings on [[Bohol Island|Bohol]], [[Negros Island|Negros]], and [[Mindanao Island|Mindanao]], where they cleared out pockets of resisting Japanese until 17 June when ordered to return to Cebu, arriving on 25 June. The Americal Division added by the newly local Filipino troops of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and [[Philippine Constabulary]] and the recognized guerrillas for the liberated in Visayas and Mindanao against the Japanese.\n\nTraining continued on Cebu for the proposed invasion of Japan, but the Japanese surrendered on 14 August 1945. On 10 September 1945, the Americal Division landed in Japan and took part in the occupation of the [[Yokohama]]&ndash;[[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]]&ndash;[[Yokosuka]] area.\n\n===Casualties===\n*'''Total battle casualties:''' 4,050<ref name=\"Nonbattle Deaths 1953\">Army Battle Casualties and Nonbattle Deaths, Final Report (Statistics and Analysis Branch, Office of the Adjutant General, 1 June 1953)</ref>\n*'''Killed in action:''' 981<ref name=\"Nonbattle Deaths 1953\"/>\n*'''Wounded in action:''' 3,052<ref name=\"Nonbattle Deaths 1953\"/>\n*'''Missing in action:''' 16<ref name=\"Nonbattle Deaths 1953\"/>\n*'''Prisoner of war:''' 1<ref name=\"Nonbattle Deaths 1953\"/>\n\n==Postwar==\nThe division returned to the United States on 21 November 1945, and was inactivated on 12 December 1945.

Its precursor, a division-sized task force known as [[Task Force Oregon]] was created in [[Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i Province|Qu\u1ea3ng Ng\u00e3i]] and [[Qu\u1ea3ng T\u00edn Province|Qu\u1ea3ng T\u00edn]] provinces from the 3rd Brigade of the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]], the 1st Brigade of the [[101st Airborne Division]], and the [[196th Infantry Brigade (United States)|196th Light Infantry Brigade]] (all brigades that deployed separately to Vietnam in 1966). Task Force Oregon operated in close cooperation with the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] in the I Corps Military Region. As more US Army units arrived in Vietnam the two divisional brigades were released back to their parent organizations and two arriving separate brigades were assigned to Task Force Oregon, which was in turn re-designated the 23rd Infantry Division (Americal). The division was composed of the [[11th Infantry Brigade (United States)|11th]], 196th, and [[198th Infantry Brigade (United States)|198th Light Infantry Brigades]] and divisional support units. Both the 11th and 198th brigades were newly formed units.\n\nThe Americal, in Vietnam, suffered an important defeat at the [[Battle of Kham Duc]] but gave a solid performance during the [[Tet Offensive]], the [[Battle of Lo Giang]] and the [[Battle of Landing Zone Center|Battle of Landing Zone Center/Hill 352]]. Platoon Sergeant [[Finnis McCleery]] was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his valiant efforts on Hill 352. Sgt. [[Alan Allen]] was awarded the [[Silver Star]] for this same battle.

The blue color stands for infantry.<ref name=tioh/>\n\nOn the distinctive unit insignia, the blue saltire (cross of St. Andrew) alludes to New Caledonia in the Southwest Pacific where the division was created and first activated on 27 May 1942. Each of the four white stars stands for the [[Southern Cross]] constellation on its division insignia, as well as the four World War II campaigns ([[Guadalcanal Campaign|Guadalcanal]], [[Solomon Islands campaign|Northern Solomons]], [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]] and [[Southern Philippines]]) in which the division participated. The anchor refers to the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] (Navy) awarded the division for Guadalcanal. The red arrowhead and Philippine sun stand for the assault landing, Southern Philippines, and the award of the [[Presidential Unit Citation (Philippines)|Philippine Presidential Unit Citation]] (7 October 1944 to 4 July 1945). The unsheathed sword with point to top refers to Vietnam where the division was active. In view of the division's origin and outstanding service in World War II and inasmuch as it was one of the few U.S. Army divisions to bear a name instead of a number, the division's former name \"Americal\" has been taken as a motto, the association with that name being both inspirational and of historical military significance.<ref name=tioh/>\n\n==Commanders==\nMG [[Alexander M.

The French objected to the arrangement and, increasingly worried about Japanese invasion being attracted by the airfield, demanded additional American forces.\n\nWith pressing needs to build up defenses in Hawaii and Australia, Army planners decided to put together a force rather than commit an already organized division. The regiments available through the reorganization of divisions along with other elements made available a force of about 15,000 men. This force, designated Task Force 6814 and often mentioned as Poppy Force (New Caledonia was code named Poppy), under Brigadier General [[Alexander Patch|Alexander M. Patch, Jr.]] had the elements of a division and more in its composition. For example, there was a brigade headquarters from the 26th Division, two infantry regiments and a field artillery regiment along with support elements augmented by a battalion of light tanks, antiaircraft and coast artillery regiments and a pursuit squadron. The force's mission was to hold New Caledonia.  It was an independent command, directly under the War Department in Washington.{{sfn|Morton|1962|pp=204\u2013212}}{{sfn|Leighton|1955-68|pp=177\u2013185}}\n\nWithin two weeks, despite an urgent need of shipping elsewhere and at the cost of delaying and rearranging schedules elsewhere and consultations at the head of state level, Task Force 6814 along with some 4,000 troops destined for Australia were assembled in the largest single troop convoy up until that time, designated BT-200 and totaling over 20,000 troops aboard seven transports,.<ref group=note>The transports were: [[SS Argentina (1929)|''Argentina'']] (1929) {{GRT|20,614}}, [http://www.angelfire.com/cantina/que_pasa/Retirement.html ''Cristobal'' (1939) {{GRT|10,021}}], [[USAT J.

General Patch, preceding the force by air, had arrived on 5 March with news for the French that American forces were underway. Despite having no early prospect of reinforcements, another infantry regiment arrived in April, along with the authority to organize an infantry division from elements of the overall force and, in May, the Americal Division was organized.{{sfn|Morton|1962|pp=204\u2013212}}{{sfn|Leighton|1955-68|pp=177\u2013185}}\n\nOn 14 March 1942, two days after the task force later to be known as the Americal Division landed in Noum\u00e9a, New Caledonia, the 182nd Infantry was detailed to provide a special unit to be called Force A for advance occupation and outpost of the New Hebrides, a group of islands lying directly across the supply to United States.\n\nAssigned to this duty were companies L and M and attached elements from Headquarters Company, Service Company, the Medical Detachment plus a platoon of the 101st Engineers.\n\nThe total strength being in the vicinity of 480 men was under the command of Brigadier General Rose.

No retreat was possible, no reinforcements could be relied on. Supply was unreliable and limited.\n\nOn 28 March 1942, a unit of Force A left an isolated coconut plantation called Euralia for Port Havanah with two 2nd lieutenants and 22 men on a small auxiliary sailboat with equipment and 10 days' rations to begin their 'guerrilla' action by gathering the native headhunters and plantation workers from the nearby islands as reinforcements.{{command structure\n|name= Americal Division\n|date=August 1942-May 1943\n|parent= \n|subordinate=\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Detachment, Task Force 6814 (including attached Division Surgeon's Office)\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 51st Infantry Brigade\n* 132nd Infantry Regiment, less Cannon Company\n* 164th Infantry Regiment, less Cannon Company\n* 182nd Infantry Regiment, less Cannon Company\n* 1 platoon, 39th Military Police Company\n* 26th Signal Company\n* Headquarters, American Division Artillery (activated 26 October 1942)\n* 221st Field Artillery Battalion (155 mm)\n* 223rd Field Artillery Battalion (155 mm) (relieved from division 26 February 1943)\n* 245th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n* 246th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n* 247th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n* 57th Engineer Combat Battalion\n* 101st Medical Regiment (less two companies and Division Surgeon's Office)\n}}\n===Guadalcanal===\n{{Main|Battle of Guadalcanal}}\nIn contrast to several other US Army divisions in the [[Pacific War]], soldiers in the Americal division received extensive weapons training as well as company- and battalion-level exercises in jungle terrain while at [[New Caledonia]]. Under the command of General Patch, the Americal Division was the first US Army unit to be sent to [[Guadalcanal]].  Largely because of transport constraints, the Americal arrived piecemeal and was fed into combat alongside the battle-hardened and exhausted [[1st Marine Division (United States)|US 1st Marine Division]], which it eventually relieved. Its soldiers were quick to assimilate from the Marines on Guadalcanal lessons on battle tactics against Japanese forces. Americal casualties were consequently less than what might be expected.\n\nThe 164th Infantry Regiment landed on Guadalcanal on 13 October 1942 ahead of its brother regiments, as emergency reinforcement for the 1st Marine Division.  The Regiment was the first U.S. Army unit to engage in offensive action during World War II as part of the Battle of Guadalcanal. Between 24 and 27 October, elements of the regiment withstood repeated assaults from Japanese battalions and inflicted some two thousand enemy casualties; the 164th also supported and participated in Marine attacks. The First Marine Division's commander, Major General A. A. Vandegrift, was so impressed by the soldiers' stand that he issued a unit commendation to the regiment for having demonstrated \"an overwhelming superiority over the enemy.\" In addition, General Vandegrift took the unusual step of awarding Lt. Colonel Robert Hall, commander of the 3rd Battalion, 164th, with the Navy Cross for his role in these battles. The 164th was then occasionally referred to as the '164th Marines' due to their special relationship with the Marines on Guadalcanal.\n\nIn November the 164th took part in the offensive across the [[Matanikau River]]. Other elements of the division arrived piecemeal in the last few weeks of 1942.\n\nIn January 1943, the 132nd Infantry Regiment of the division took Hill 27 and 31 of the [[Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse|Mount Austen]] complex. The division later participated in offensives to sweep Guadalcanal of remaining Japanese resistance. After the last Japanese defenders were killed, captured, or evacuated from the island, the division was relieved on 9 February 1943.\n\nDespite its ad-hoc formation, the Americal Division fought well at Guadalcanal. The 164th Regiment took part in repulsing a major Japanese offensive in October 1942, while the 132nd Regiment, along with the 25th Infantry Division assaulted the highly fortified Japanese Gifu defensive complex at [[Battle of Mount Austen, the Galloping Horse, and the Sea Horse|Mount Austen]] in January 1943. Historians describe the Americal Division as the most effective of all the US Army divisions in that campaign. Following the withdrawal of the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]], the division continued operations on Guadalcanal as part of the [[XIV Corps (United States)|U.S. XIV Corps]] with the 25th Infantry Division (who later earned their 'Tropic Lightning' nickname here) and the 2nd Marine Division (Arrived earlier as reinforcements to the 1st MarDiv) until all of the Japanese resistance had ended.\n\n===Bougainville===\n{{Main| Bougainville campaign (1943\u201345)}}\n{{command structure\n|name= Americal Division <ref>https://history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/cbtchron/infcomp.html Component Elements of the Infantry Divisions in World War II</ref>\n|date=May 1943-December 1945\n|parent= \n|subordinate=\n* Headquarters, Americal Division\n* [[132nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|132nd Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[164th Infantry Regiment (United States)|164th Infantry Regiment]]\n* [[182nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|182nd Infantry Regiment]]\n* Headquarters and Headquarters Battery, Americal Division Artillery\n** 221st Field Artillery Battalion ([[M114 155 mm howitzer|155 mm]])\n** 245th Field Artillery Battalion ([[M101 howitzer|105 mm]])\n** 246th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n** 247th Field Artillery Battalion (105 mm)\n* 57th [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Engineer]] Combat Battalion\n* 121st [[Medical Corps (United States Army)|Medical]] Battalion\n* 21st Cavalry [[Reconnaissance]] Troop (Mechanized)\n* Headquarters, Special Troops, Americal Division\n** Headquarters Company, Americal Division\n** 721st [[Ordnance Corps (United States Army)|Ordnance]] Light Maintenance Company\n** 125th [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|Quartermaster]] Company\n** 26th [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Signal]] Company\n** Military Police Platoon\n** Band\n* 182nd [[Counterintelligence Corps]] Detachment\n}}\nThe division next moved to the [[Fiji]] Islands, beginning 5 March 1943, to assume the defense of the main island of [[Viti Levu]] and to engage in extensive training.\n\nDuring the period 25 December 1943 to 12 January 1944 the Americal Division landed on [[Bougainville Campaign|Bougainville]], relieving the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd Marine Division]]. They were given the task (alongside the [[37th Infantry Division (United States)|37th Infantry Division]] and a Marine defense battalion) of holding and extending the right half of a previously established perimeter.\n\nWarned by intelligence, they met a massive and sustained Japanese counter-attack, which began on 7 March 1944. Despite ample warning and thorough defensive preparations, the battle soon degenerated into a bitter, close-quarters infantry affair, with artillery restricted by the need to avoid friendly troops and tanks unable to reach the scene. The 37th and Americal Divisions stood firm, and by 25 March, the Japanese were forced to retreat. It was the last Japanese ground offensive in the South Pacific.\n\nThe division went on the offensive in March 1944, driving the Japanese east of [[Mavavia River]], 7\u20139 April 1944, and seizing numerous strategic hill bases during the remainder of the month. Training and long-range patrol activity continued until 30 November 1944 when the division was relieved.\n\n===Philippines===\n{{Main| Battle of Leyte}}\nOn 8 January 1945, the division began movement to [[Leyte Island|Leyte]] and [[Samar Island|Samar]], to take part in cleaning out remaining Japanese forces on those islands, and to invade [[Biri, Northern Samar|Biri]], [[Capul]], [[Ticao Island|Ticao]], and [[Burias (island)|Burias]]. On Leyte, the division was relieved on 13 March 1945 and then landed on [[Cebu Island|Cebu]] on 26 March, and seized the city and airfield by 28 March. Divisional combat teams made landings on [[Bohol Island|Bohol]], [[Negros Island|Negros]], and [[Mindanao Island|Mindanao]], where they cleared out pockets of resisting Japanese until 17 June when ordered to return to Cebu, arriving on 25 June. The Americal Division added by the newly local Filipino troops of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and [[Philippine Constabulary]] and the recognized guerrillas for the liberated in Visayas and Mindanao against the Japanese.\n\nTraining continued on Cebu for the proposed invasion of Japan, but the Japanese surrendered on 14 August 1945.

Task Force Oregon operated in close cooperation with the [[1st Marine Division (United States)|1st Marine Division]] in the I Corps Military Region. As more US Army units arrived in Vietnam the two divisional brigades were released back to their parent organizations and two arriving separate brigades were assigned to Task Force Oregon, which was in turn re-designated the 23rd Infantry Division (Americal). The division was composed of the [[11th Infantry Brigade (United States)|11th]], 196th, and [[198th Infantry Brigade (United States)|198th Light Infantry Brigades]] and divisional support units. Both the 11th and 198th brigades were newly formed units.\n\nThe Americal, in Vietnam, suffered an important defeat at the [[Battle of Kham Duc]] but gave a solid performance during the [[Tet Offensive]], the [[Battle of Lo Giang]] and the [[Battle of Landing Zone Center|Battle of Landing Zone Center/Hill 352]].

The anchor refers to the [[Presidential Unit Citation (United States)|Presidential Unit Citation]] (Navy) awarded the division for Guadalcanal. The red arrowhead and Philippine sun stand for the assault landing, Southern Philippines, and the award of the [[Presidential Unit Citation (Philippines)|Philippine Presidential Unit Citation]] (7 October 1944 to 4 July 1945). The unsheathed sword with point to top refers to Vietnam where the division was active. In view of the division's origin and outstanding service in World War II and inasmuch as it was one of the few U.S. Army divisions to bear a name instead of a number, the division's former name \"Americal\" has been taken as a motto, the association with that name being both inspirational and of historical military significance.<ref name=tioh/>\n\n==Commanders==\nMG [[Alexander M.
