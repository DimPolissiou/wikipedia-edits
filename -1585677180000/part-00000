It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on March 31, 2010. In the episode, the South Park [[KFC]] is replaced by a medical [[marijuana dispensary]], and Cartman gets involved in [[Underground economy|black market]] selling the KFC chicken. Meanwhile, [[Randy Marsh (South Park)|Randy Marsh]] gets a medical referral for marijuana by giving himself [[testicular cancer]], which makes his testicles grow to grotesquely huge proportions.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]]. \"Medicinal Fried Chicken\" was first broadcast when Detroit  was considering revising state medicinal weed laws and restricting fast food eateries. The episode provided social commentary against both types of laws, and suggested legislating lifestyle choices is ineffective and inevitably leads to black markets.\n\nThe Cartman drug market subplot was heavily influenced by the 1983 crime film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', with Cartman resembling fictional drug lord [[Tony Montana]] and KFC founder [[Colonel Sanders]] as antagonist [[List of Scarface characters|Alejandro Sosa]]. The episode also included several jokes about [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and the [[Pope Benedict XVI#Sexual abuse in the Catholic Church|child sexual abuse scandals]] that had been surrounding the [[Catholic Church]] at the time. The concept of a former KFC restaurant becoming a [[marijuana dispensary]] came from a news story about a real [[marijuana dispensary]] in [[Palms, Los Angeles]], built at a site formerly housing a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise.<ref name=LAWeekly>{{cite news|last=Romero |first=Dennis |title='South Park' Episode Takes Cues From L.A.'s Famous KFC Pot Shop |work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=April 1, 2010 |url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/ladaily/city-news/south-park-kfc-pot-shop/ |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404065720/http://blogs.laweekly.com/ladaily/city-news/south-park-kfc-pot-shop/ |archivedate=April 4, 2010 }}</ref><ref name=Gothamist>{{cite web |last=Behrens |first=Zach |title=South Park Pays Homage to L.A.'s Fast Food Medicinal Marijuana Dispensary in Palms |publisher=[[LAist|Gothamist]] |date=April 1, 2010 |url=http://laist.com/2010/04/01/south_park_plays_homage_to_las_kfc.php |accessdate=April 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405192606/http://laist.com/2010/04/01/south_park_plays_homage_to_las_kfc.php |archivedate=April 5, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n\"Medicinal Fried Chicken\" received generally positive reviews, with many commentators praising the social commentary and [[sophomoric humor|sophomoric]] testicle jokes alike. According to [[Nielsen ratings|Media Research]], the episode was seen by 30.99 million viewers, making it one of the most successful cable programs of the week. Although a KFC spokesman had a lukewarm response to \"Medicinal Fried Chicken\", officials from the KFC hometown of [[Corbin, Kentucky]] were pleased the city was featured in the episode.\n\n== Plot ==\nNew state laws prohibiting fast food restaurants in low-income neighborhoods result in the closure of all [[KFC]] eateries in [[Colorado]], much to the dismay of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], who is addicted to the food. When [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy Marsh]] learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical [[marijuana dispensary]], he attempts to give himself [[cancer]] so he can get a doctor's referral for marijuana after first gaining a clean bill of health from his doctor since he had assumed permits are given to the healthy. By [[irradiating]] his groin with a microwave oven with a large amount of chicken nuggets, Randy successfully gives himself [[testicular cancer]], making his testicles so large that he has to use a [[wheelbarrow]] to carry them. Randy obtains his medical referral and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his testicles continue to grow to the point that he uses them as a [[space hopper]] for movement. Randy finds that larger testicles are attractive to women, including his wife, [[Sharon Marsh]], so he encourages his friends to also get testicular cancer. The local doctor, unaware of the men's self-irradiation, becomes convinced that a recent change in South Park is responsible for the cancer outbreak.\n\nMeanwhile, Cartman learns that all KFCs in Colorado have been shut down because of a new law which bans fast food. After receiving treatment for KFC [[drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], Cartman is introduced to Billy Miller, a local boy who runs an illegal KFC [[drug cartel|cartel]] from his home. Billy hires Cartman to sell his illegal food, a job that provides Cartman with the same food as payment. After Cartman demonstrates his ruthlessness against a cheating street dealer, Billy sends him and another employee, Tommy, to [[Corbin, Kentucky]] to buy chicken directly from [[Colonel Sanders]]. Sanders is impressed by Cartman but has Tommy executed after discovering him to be a mole for healthy foods advocate [[Jamie Oliver]]. Cartman wins over the Colonel's trust, but is warned to never betray him. Cartman eventually betrays Billy by telling Billy's mother that he got an F on his social studies test, and takes over the cartel after Billy is grounded. The Colonel assigns Cartman the task of [[assassination|assassinating]] Oliver to prevent him from giving a speech in the [[United Nations]]. However, the gluttonous Cartman soon comes to abuse the KFC food he is assigned to sell, and forgets the Colonel's assassination order. The Colonel, furious at Cartman's incompetence, sends a squad of gunmen to kill him, leading to a firefight with the police that kills Billy's mother, and which Cartman escapes unscathed.\n\nRandy's testicles grow so large that he is unable to fit through the doors of the [[marijuana dispensary]]. Prohibited by law from purchasing marijuana outside the premises, Randy and the other self-irradiated men begin protesting for larger marijuana dispensary doors. As politicians discuss the issue, the marijuana dispensary owner suggests that marijuana simply be legalized, arguing that people are abusing the medicinal system anyway.

It originally aired on [[Comedy Central]] in the United States on March 31, 2010. In the episode, the South Park [[KFC]] is replaced by a medical [[marijuana dispensary]], and Cartman gets involved in [[Underground economy|black market]] selling the KFC chicken. Meanwhile, [[Randy Marsh (South Park)|Randy Marsh]] gets a medical referral for marijuana by giving himself [[testicular cancer]], which makes his testicles grow to grotesquely huge proportions.\n\nThe episode was written and directed by series co-creator [[Trey Parker]]. \"Medicinal Fried Chicken\" was first broadcast when Detroit  was considering revising state medicinal weed laws and restricting fast food eateries. The episode provided social commentary against both types of laws, and suggested legislating lifestyle choices is ineffective and inevitably leads to black markets.\n\nThe Cartman drug market subplot was heavily influenced by the 1983 crime film ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'', with Cartman resembling fictional drug lord [[Tony Montana]] and KFC founder [[Colonel Sanders]] as antagonist [[List of Scarface characters|Alejandro Sosa]]. The episode also included several jokes about [[Pope Benedict XVI]] and the [[Pope Benedict XVI#Sexual abuse in the Catholic Church|child sexual abuse scandals]] that had been surrounding the [[Catholic Church]] at the time. The concept of a former KFC restaurant becoming a [[marijuana dispensary]] came from a news story about a real [[marijuana dispensary]] in [[Palms, Los Angeles]], built at a site formerly housing a Kentucky Fried Chicken franchise.<ref name=LAWeekly>{{cite news|last=Romero |first=Dennis |title='South Park' Episode Takes Cues From L.A.'s Famous KFC Pot Shop |work=[[LA Weekly]] |date=April 1, 2010 |url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/ladaily/city-news/south-park-kfc-pot-shop/ |accessdate=April 4, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404065720/http://blogs.laweekly.com/ladaily/city-news/south-park-kfc-pot-shop/ |archivedate=April 4, 2010 }}</ref><ref name=Gothamist>{{cite web |last=Behrens |first=Zach |title=South Park Pays Homage to L.A.'s Fast Food Medicinal Marijuana Dispensary in Palms |publisher=[[LAist|Gothamist]] |date=April 1, 2010 |url=http://laist.com/2010/04/01/south_park_plays_homage_to_las_kfc.php |accessdate=April 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405192606/http://laist.com/2010/04/01/south_park_plays_homage_to_las_kfc.php |archivedate=April 5, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n\"Medicinal Fried Chicken\" received generally positive reviews, with many commentators praising the social commentary and [[sophomoric humor|sophomoric]] testicle jokes alike. According to [[Nielsen ratings|Media Research]], the episode was seen by 30.99 million viewers, making it one of the most successful cable programs of the week. Although a KFC spokesman had a lukewarm response to \"Medicinal Fried Chicken\", officials from the KFC hometown of [[Corbin, Kentucky]] were pleased the city was featured in the episode.\n\n== Plot ==\nNew state laws prohibiting fast food restaurants in low-income neighborhoods result in the closure of all [[KFC]] eateries in [[Colorado]], much to the dismay of [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], who is addicted to the food. When [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Randy Marsh]] learns that South Park's KFC outlet is now a medical [[marijuana dispensary]], he attempts to give himself [[cancer]] so he can get a doctor's referral for marijuana after first gaining a clean bill of health from his doctor since he had assumed permits are given to the healthy. By [[irradiating]] his groin with a microwave oven, Randy successfully gives himself [[testicular cancer]], making his testicles so large that he has to use a [[wheelbarrow]] to carry them. Randy obtains his medical referral and starts smoking marijuana regularly. Meanwhile, his testicles continue to grow to the point that he uses them as a [[space hopper]] for movement. Randy finds that larger testicles are attractive to women, including his wife, [[Sharon Marsh]], so he encourages his friends to also get testicular cancer. The local doctor, unaware of the men's self-irradiation, becomes convinced that a recent change in South Park is responsible for the cancer outbreak.\n\nMeanwhile, Cartman learns that all KFCs in Colorado have been shut down because of a new law which bans fast food. After receiving treatment for KFC [[drug withdrawal|withdrawal]], Cartman is introduced to Billy Miller, a local boy who runs an illegal KFC [[drug cartel|cartel]] from his home. Billy hires Cartman to sell his illegal food, a job that provides Cartman with the same food as payment. After Cartman demonstrates his ruthlessness against a cheating street dealer, Billy sends him and another employee, Tommy, to [[Corbin, Kentucky]] to buy chicken directly from [[Colonel Sanders]]. Sanders is impressed by Cartman but has Tommy executed after discovering him to be a mole for healthy foods advocate [[Jamie Oliver]]. Cartman wins over the Colonel's trust, but is warned to never betray him. Cartman eventually betrays Billy by telling Billy's mother that he got an F on his social studies test, and takes over the cartel after Billy is grounded. The Colonel assigns Cartman the task of [[assassination|assassinating]] Oliver to prevent him from giving a speech in the [[United Nations]]. However, the gluttonous Cartman soon comes to abuse the KFC food he is assigned to sell, and forgets the Colonel's assassination order. The Colonel, furious at Cartman's incompetence, sends a squad of gunmen to kill him, leading to a firefight with the police that kills Billy's mother, and which Cartman escapes unscathed.\n\nRandy's testicles grow so large that he is unable to fit through the doors of the [[marijuana dispensary]]. Prohibited by law from purchasing marijuana outside the premises, Randy and the other self-irradiated men begin protesting for larger marijuana dispensary doors. As politicians discuss the issue, the marijuana dispensary owner suggests that marijuana simply be legalized, arguing that people are abusing the medicinal system anyway. A local doctor then opines that the ban on KFC had led to the rise in testicular cancer because the chicken was somehow preventing it. Colorado bans marijuana once again. KFC reopens locations in the state, which are now re-branded as \"Medicinal Fried Chicken.\" Randy has his cancerous testicles removed and replaced with [[prosthesis|prosthetic]] ones, and has the skin from his removed enlarged scrotum made into a new skin coat for [[Randy and Sharon Marsh|Sharon]].\n\n==Production==\n[[File:TreyParkerHWOFApr2013.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[South Park]]'' co-creator [[Trey Parker]] wrote \"Medicinal Fried Chicken\"]]\n\"Medicinal Fried Chicken\" was written by series co-founders [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]], was directed by Parker, and was rated [[TV-MA]] in the United States.

The War of the Falklands War, for example, was fought in the Americas but the Islands were invaded by a military from the Americas (the Argentine military). They were subsequently defended (not ''invaded'') by the UK. Another example, Pearl Harbor, experienced an attack, not an ''invasion'' by the Japanese. The only possible exception to the Cinco de Mayo claim above might be the brief occupation/invasion of two of the Alaskan Aleutian Islands by the Japanese military during WWII. This event, however, was so insignificant as to be virtually negligible: the islands invaded had a total population of 12 Americans and some 45 natives, the invasion was short-lived, and the battle fought there had no notoriety other than the psychological effect on the Americans that the Japanese had invaded American territory again (Alaska was not yet a full-fledged state). In short, the military importance of these small pieces of land was nowhere comparable to the superior military significance of the Battle of Puebla.|group=note}} Historian [[Justo Sierra]] has written in his ''Political Evolution of the Mexican People'' that, had Mexico not defeated the French in Puebla on May 5, 1862, France would have gone to the aid of the [[Confederate States of America]] in the [[American Civil War]] and the United States' destiny would have been different.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.banderasnews.com/0705/edat-frenchdefeat.htm |title=Mexico's Lasting European Influence.

The War of the Falklands War, for example, was fought in the Americas but the Islands were invaded by a military from the Americas (the Argentine military). They were subsequently defended (not ''invaded'') by the UK. Another example, Pearl Harbor, experienced an attack, not an ''invasion'' by the Japanese. The only possible exception to the Cinco de Mayo claim above might be the brief occupation/invasion of two of the Alaskan Aleutian Islands by the Japanese military during WWII. This event, however, was so insignificant as to be virtually negligible: the islands invaded had a total population of 12 Americans and some 45 natives, the invasion was short-lived, and the battle fought there had no notoriety other than the psychological effect on the Americans that the Japanese had invaded American territory again (Alaska was not yet a full-fledged state).

It has been serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' since November 9, 2016, with the individual chapters collected and published by [[Kodansha]] into eleven ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of August 2019. The story follows an immortal being whose purpose is to gain knowledge of the world. As the story progresses, this being takes the form of an abandoned boy and his wolf. \n\nIn North America, the manga has been licensed by [[Kodansha USA]] for a digital and printed English release.\n\nAn [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Brain's Base]] will premiere in October 2020.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nThe manga follows a mysterious immortal being named Fushi, sent to the Earth with no emotions nor identity. Fushi is able to take the shape of those around that leave a strong impression on him. Starting as a sphere, he takes the form of a rock, then a dying wolf. As a wolf, Fushi meets a boy living alone. The boy dies after living with Fushi for some time, and Fushi takes his human form, but without any knowledge of how to speak or live. From that point on, Fushi meets and parts with numerous people over the course of hundreds of years, maturing as a person and taking on the forms of those who die. He acquires numerous other powers, such as the ability to recreate objects he has interacted with in the past, and feel the pain and joy of others.\n\nDuring Fushi's journey, he is aided by a mysterious black-hooded figure with even greater powers than his own, who claims to be his creator, and is opposed by plant-like beings called knockers who can steal his forms. After fighting the knockers for centuries, Fushi kills almost all of them in a climactic battle, then spends years spreading his body across the planet to prevent them from coming back, ending part one of the manga.\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\nYoshitoki \u014cima launched ''To Your Eternity'' in the issue #50 of [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]]'' [[manga]] magazine ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' on November 9, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-11-02/a-silent-voice-oima-launches-fumetsu-no-anata-e-fantasy-manga-on-november-9/.108367 |title=A Silent Voice's \u014cima Launches Fumetsu no Anata e Fantasy Manga on November 9 |date=November 2, 2016 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=September 20, 2017}}</ref> The manga was announced on May 23, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-05-24/a-silent-voice-oima-launches-new-fantasy-manga-in-fall/.102452 |title=A Silent Voice's \u014cima Launches New Fantasy Manga in Fall |date=May 23, 2016 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=September 18, 2017}}</ref> It is \u014cima's second series in ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine''; her first series was the critically acclaimed ''[[A Silent Voice (manga)|A Silent Voice]]''.

The story follows an immortal being whose purpose is to gain knowledge of the world. As the story progresses, this being takes the form of an abandoned boy and his wolf. \n\nIn North America, the manga has been licensed by [[Kodansha USA]] for a digital and printed English release.\n\nAn [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Brain's Base]] will premiere in October 2020.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nThe manga follows a mysterious immortal being named Fushi, sent to the Earth with no emotions nor identity. Fushi is able to take the shape of those around that leave a strong impression on him. Starting as a sphere, he takes the form of a rock, then a dying wolf. As a wolf, Fushi meets a boy living alone. The boy dies after living with Fushi for some time, and Fushi takes his human form, but without any knowledge of how to speak or live. From that point on, Fushi meets and parts with numerous people over the course of hundreds of years, maturing as a person and taking on the forms of those who die. He acquires numerous other powers, such as the ability to recreate objects he has interacted with in the past, and feel the pain and joy of others.\n\nDuring Fushi's journey, he is aided by a mysterious black-hooded figure with even greater powers than his own, who claims to be his creator, and is opposed by plant-like beings called knockers who can steal his forms. After fighting the knockers for centuries, Fushi kills almost all of them in a climactic battle, then spends years spreading his body across the planet to prevent them from coming back, ending part one of the manga.\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\nYoshitoki \u014cima launched ''To Your Eternity'' in the issue #50 of [[Kodansha]]'s ''[[Sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]]'' [[manga]] magazine ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' on November 9, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-11-02/a-silent-voice-oima-launches-fumetsu-no-anata-e-fantasy-manga-on-november-9/.108367 |title=A Silent Voice's \u014cima Launches Fumetsu no Anata e Fantasy Manga on November 9 |date=November 2, 2016 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=September 20, 2017}}</ref> The manga was announced on May 23, 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-05-24/a-silent-voice-oima-launches-new-fantasy-manga-in-fall/.102452 |title=A Silent Voice's \u014cima Launches New Fantasy Manga in Fall |date=May 23, 2016 |publisher=[[Anime News Network]] |accessdate=September 18, 2017}}</ref> It is \u014cima's second series in ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine''; her first series was the critically acclaimed ''[[A Silent Voice (manga)|A Silent Voice]]''.

It was created to coincide with the [[Lego Ninjago]] line of construction toys, many of which are based on elements of the series. It centers on the fictional world of Ninjago, telling the story of a group of teenage [[Ninja]] and their battles against the forces of evil. The series was animated in Copenhagen, Denmark, by Wil Film ApS for the Masters of Spinjitzu Saga (Season 1-10). Animation was relocated to [[WildBrain|WildBrain Studios]] in Canada for the Secrets of the Forbidden Spinjitzu and Prime Empire chapters. The English-language voice cast has been recorded in Canada for its entire run.\n\n''Ninjago'' began with two pilot episodes in January 2011, which were followed by two 13-episode seasons that aired from January to November 2012. Both the Lego theme and the series had an intended shelf life of three years, so the second season was originally intended to be the last. However, continued success of the series and its product line led to the show continuing ever since with twelve seasons being produced as of 2020.\n\nThe series was created by Michael Hegner and Tommy Andreasen, two Danish film producers. In Denmark, where the series' original production companies are located, ''Ninjago'' premiered on [[Nickelodeon (Denmark)|Nickelodeon]]. It airs on various Nickelodeon networks internationally and on [[Cartoon Network]] in the United States, United Kingdom and Poland. In [[Canada]], the series is broadcast on [[Teletoon]] and [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]].<ref name=teletoon>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/2012/08/pr-teletoon-programming-highlights-september-2012/|title=PR: TELETOON Programming Highlights, September 2012|work=toonzone.net}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe show is mainly set in the [[realm]] of Ninjago, a place loosely inspired by [[East Asian culture|East Asian myths and culture]]. While featuring several historically designed buildings and traditional clothing, Ninjago is in a modern setting, incorporating large metropolises with skyscrapers, current-age (and futuristic) vehicles, modern electronics, semi-robotic exo-suits, and other futuristic technology.\n\n==Synopsis==\nLong before the events of the series, the First Spinjitzu Master used the power of the Golden Weapons to create the realm of Ninjago. Trained in the legendary art of Spinjitzu by the wise Master Wu, a group of heroic ninja (Kai, Jay, Cole, and Zane, and eventually Lloyd and Nya) fight to defend their land against the various foes who wish to conquer it.\n\n===Pilot Episodes (2011)===\nLong before time had a name, the First Spinjitzu Master created the [[realm]] of [[Ninjago]] with the four Golden Weapons of Spinjitzu: the Scythe of Quakes, the Shurikens of Ice, the Nunchucks of Lightning, and the Sword of Fire. Before he passed, his sons swore to protect the weapons from evil, but the older brother, Garmadon, was taken over by darkness and aimed to wield all four weapons so he could recreate Ninjago in his own image. In the ensuing battle between brothers, the younger brother Wu cast Garmadon down to the Underworld, hiding the weapons across the land and placing a guardian at each hiding spot. In anticipation of Garmadon's return, Wu seeks out four talented young Ninja to learn the ways of the Ninja, master the art of Spinjitzu, and find the Golden Weapons before Garmadon and his minions can claim them for their maniacal machinations.\n\n===Season 1: Rise of the Snakes (2012)===\nSince Lord Garmadon's disappearance, peace has returned to Ninjago. Rather than prepare for his return, the Ninja have become lazy, playing video games and eating junk food instead of continuing their training. With their guard down, they find themselves thrown back into action when Garmadon's son Lloyd releases the five warring tribes of Serpentine, a race of snake-people who once ruled over Ninjago before being sealed away in underground tombs. Now led by the treacherous Pythor P. Chumsworth, last of the fearsome Anacondrai, the vengeful snakes seek to find the four Silver Fangblades to awaken the Great Devourer, an indestructible giant serpent that grows the more it consumes. To stop them, the Ninja make new allies as they try to overcome emotional barriers and unlock their True Potential and trying to learn the identity of the legendary Green Ninja spoken of in a prophecy.\n\n===Season 2: Legacy of the Green Ninja (2012) ===\nAfter defeating the Great Devourer, Lord Garmadon has escaped with the Golden Weapons and taken command of the Serpentine. At the Golden Peaks, birthplace of the weapons, he forges them into a Mega Weapon. Able to create anything he pleases, Garmadon aims to interrupt Lloyd's training and prevent him from achieving his destiny as the Green Ninja. To ensure Lloyd is ready to face his father, the Ninja combat Garmadon's creations at every turn. But both sides are unaware of an evil dwelling on the fabled Island of Darkness pulling the strings for thousands of years to conquer all. The fate of Ninjago hangs in the balance as the Final Battle between good and evil looms closer.\n\n===Season 3: Rebooted (2014)===\nGood prevailed in the Final Battle with Lloyd as the Ultimate Spinjitzu Master defeating the Overlord and saving both Ninjago and his father. Ninjago City was left in ruin until genius inventor Cyrus Borg led the reconstruction process bringing about New Ninjago City, a hub of futuristic technological advancements. In this hi-tech age of peace, the Ninja have retired to teaching at Wu's Academy. During a field trip to Borg Tower, center of all this innovation, they discover that the Overlord has survived his fight with the Golden Ninja in the form of a virus, infecting Borg's systems. To escape the Digiverse, he plots to steal Lloyd's Golden Power and become a prophesized evil known as the Golden Master. Leaving Lloyd under the protection of a now pacifistic Sensei Garmadon, the Ninja must find the hard-drive containing the Digital Overlord and reboot the system with Borg's tech-hacking Techno Blades, to keep their friend safe and put an end to the Overlord's evil once and for all.\n\n===Season 4: The Tournament of Elements (2015)===\nTo defeat the Golden Master, Zane was forced to absorb power from the Golden Armor, sacrificing his life and leaving the Ninja team fractured in the process. But when notorious crime boss and noodle house owner Master Chen invites them to his Tournament of Elements; a competition between other Elemental Masters like them, with the promise of seeing Zane again, the Ninja, accompanied by Sensei Garmadon, find themselves traveling to Chen's Island and quickly making enemies. However, when they discover that Chen and his cult of Anacondrai worshippers use the Staff of Elements to strip those who lose of their Elemental Powers for a spell that could restart a war from Ninjago's past, they attempt to form an alliance with the Elemental Masters.\n\n===Season 5: Possession (2015)===\nChen and his Anacondrai Cultists have been banished to the Cursed Realm by General Arcturus and the Anacondrai Generals. But to free the generals, Garmadon had to take their place amongst the cursed. As a distraught Lloyd mourns the loss of his father, he is called to a solo mission where he is possessed by the jealous ghost of Wu's first student Morro, the Master of Wind, who escaped the Cursed Realm when Garmadon opened the portal. Now, the powerless Ninja face their friend as Morro aims to find the Tomb of the First Spinjitzu Master and use the Realm Crystal, gateway to the Sixteen Realms parallel to Ninjago, to allow his master to curse all that exists. To stop him, the Ninja ally with mercenary and shady businessman Ronin, mastering the lost art of Airjitzu and following three clues to the tomb's location engraved on Wu's staff. But the true key to victory lies with Nya, who learns she is the current Master of Water, which happens to be a ghost's greatest weakness and Nya finds her true potential.\n\n===Season 6: Skybound (2016)===\nTheir victory over the Preeminent has brought the Ninja overwhelming fame. While they struggle to continue to defend Ninjago while warding off obsessed fans, Jay tangles with seeing a future with Nya in the First Spinjitzu Master's Tomb. Things go further downhill for the heroes when the ghost of Chen's right-hand man Clouse (who survived the destruction of the Cursed Realm) releases Nadakhan the Djinn, the captain of the Misfortune's Keep and Sky Pirates. Framing the Ninja and reuniting with his crew, Nadakhan learns that the destruction of the Cursed Realm has caused the collapse of its Sister Realm and his former home and kingdom of Djinjago. With their fans turned against them and their team dwindling in numbers as the Djinn turns their wishes against them to trap them in his Sword of Souls, the Ninja find themselves in a battle across Ninjago to stop a vengeful Nadakhan from rebuilding his Realm with chunks of theirs. But when he sets his eyes on marrying Nya, a love-struck Jay must find the right wish to save his love, home, and friends.\n\n===Day of the Departed (2016)===\nOn the Day of the Departed, the people of Ninjago light lanterns to remember those they've lost. While his friends celebrate, Cole, whose ghostly state has deteriorated to the point of him randomly fading in and out of existence, intends to exact revenge on Master Yang for turning him into a ghost during the Ninja's attempt to learn Airjitzu. Commandeering the Yin Blade, a dark magic weapon Yang once used in an attempt to gain immortality, Cole enters the Temple of Airjitzu and prepares to \"close the circle\" by defeating the Airjitzu Master. But when his gambit for revenge leads to the accidental revival of some of the Ninja's greatest enemies, the heroes find themselves facing their vengeful foes once again as they attempt to take the Ninja's place amongst the living using magic Departed Blades. Meanwhile, Cole faces Yang and his students alone as, thanks to his actions, the Airjitzu Master has reclaimed the Yin Blade and plots to take advantage of a special Yin Yang Eclipse to cut the Rift of Return which will allow him to return to the living world.\n\n===Season 7: The Hands of Time (2017)===\nFollowing the events on the Day of the Departed, both Cole and the Temple of Airjitzu have been restored. As the Ninja setup base in the temple, they find themselves stuck cleaning up the damage at the Ninjago Museum of History. Here, they learn of the Hands of Time, twin Elemental Masters of Time itself who betrayed the Elemental Masters after the Serpentine Wars in belief their Element was the strongest. Meanwhile, at the ruins of the Monastery of Spinjitzu, Wu awaits the return of Acronix, the younger of the \"Time Twins\", to finish the battle they started 40 years ago. But without the rest of the team by his side, Wu is overwhelmed by Acronix who uses a move known as the \"Time Punch\" to accelerate Wu's aging one day per hour. Now Acronix has reunited with Krux, the older twin, who has remained hidden in Ninjago disguised as Museum Curator Dr. Saunders. The Ninja must now battle the Hands of Time and their army of Vermillion, the children of the Great Devourer, as they begin kidnapping Ninjago's best builders and stealing metal all over the city. But as they near closer to uncovering the villains' ultimate goal, the battle becomes personal for Kai and Nya who discover their parents may be involved with the Hands of Time.\n\n===Season 8: Sons of Garmadon (2018)===\nOne year after Wu and the Hands of Time were lost in time aboard the Iron Doom, the Ninja have scattered across Ninjago, tackling missions while searching for their master's whereabouts. In their absence, Ninjago City has been overrun by a cult-like crime syndicate known as the Sons of Garmadon who worship the evil Lord Garmadon. When a mysterious relic known as the Oni Mask of Vengeance is stolen from Borg Industries, The Ninja are summoned by the Royal Family, who ask the heroes to protect the three Oni Masks (The Oni Mask of Deception, the Oni Mask of Vengeance, and the Oni Mask of Hatred), relics from the First Realm which when united would allow the Sons of Garmadon to resurrect a purely evil Garmadon, as well as their adopted daughter, the Jade Princess Harumi. In order to stop the Sons of Garmadon from desecrating his father's sacrifice, Lloyd and the Ninja attempt to find the identity of their leader, the Quiet One, before they can determine the location of the elusive Oni Mask of Hatred, while learning secrets about the origins of Ninjago itself. In the process, Lloyd begins to bond with Harumi who has also lost her parents. But as they grow closer, the Ninja make the startling discovery that someone in their makeshift family is the Quiet One.\n\n===Season 9: Hunted (2018)===\nWith Emperor Garmadon in ruling Ninjago City with an iron fist and the original four Ninja as well as are stranded in Realm of Oni and Dragons after the Colossus destroyed the Destiny's Bounty, any ally of the Ninja and citizen is hunted and imprisoned in Kryptarium Prison. Lloyd, Nya, and the rest of their remaining allies, including a portion of the Elemental Masters, form a resistance to endure and fight back against Harumi, the Sons of Garmadon, and Lord Garmadon himself. Unbeknownst to them, the other Ninja are alive and thanks to Mistak\u00e9's Traveler's Tea, they are in the Realm of the Oni and the Dragon. Here, the barbaric Dragon Hunters, led by the power hungry Iron Baron, capture Dragons and exploit their Elemental Powers to sustain their society. As Dragons are the only beings who can ferry between Realms, the Ninja and a teenage Wu must find the mythical Dragon Armor once worn by the First Spinjitzu Master himself, in order to convince Firstbourne, the mother of all Dragons, to allow them to ride her children out of the Realm so they can rejoin the fight against Lord Garmadon, and save Ninjago.\n\n===Season 10: March of the Oni (2019)===\nShortly after Lord Garmadon's defeat, Ninjago is slowly returning to normal. However, Garmadon calls out to Lloyd to warn him about some dark forces that will soon conquer Ninjago, although Lloyd refuses to listen, believing that his father can't be trusted. Garmadon's warnings soon come true when the Oni invade Ninjago through the Realm Crystal and prove too much for the Ninja to handle. With no other choice, the Ninja form an uneasy alliance with Garmadon to defeat the Oni and save Ninjago from darkness. Will they prevail or will the legacy of Ninjago be lost forever?\n\n===Season 11: Secrets of the Forbidden Spinjitzu (2019-2020)===\n====The Fire Chapter====\nSix months after they defeated the Oni, the Ninja have become relaxed, lazy, and out of shape. In order to keep their skills and powers intact, they search for activity or a threat to face. Strangely enough, Ninjago has been in a state of lasting peace. However, Zane begins suffering odd visions of him being killed by Aspheera, Queen of the evil Pyro Vipers, as well as a mysterious castle guarded by the dragon Boreal and home to the Ice Emperor and his Blizzard Samurai. While Zane remains unsure about these frightening visions, the Ninja find their quest when Professor [[Lego: The Adventures of Clutch Powers|Clutch Powers]] discovers a mysterious Ancient Pyramid which supposedly only a Ninja could survive exploring. Unbeknownst to them, the next threat to Ninjago is right around the corner, as the tomb serves as a prison for Aspheera. After she is unwillingly released by the Ninja, she steals Kai's powers and uses them to revive her army of Pyro Vipers, preparing to conquer Ninjago and exact revenge on somebody who betrayed her thousands of years ago. The Ninja are left trapped in the pyramid, but are eventually rescued by P.I.X.A.L., and attempt to stop Aspheera's campaign of conquest. The Ninja soon learn about the Scrolls of Forbidden Spinjitzu, which grant the user great powers, but can also corrupt them, as well as that Sensei Wu is the one that Aspheera is looking for, as he and Garmadon befriended her back when they were children and taught her Spinjitzu, but she betrayed them and used it for evil, taking over the Serpentines, leading to Wu and Garmadon defeating Aspheera using Forbidden Spinjitzu and imprisoning her inside the pyramid. After Aspheera steals one of the two Scrolls of Forbbiden from the museum, the Ninja go after the other, just as Aspheera and her forces attack the Monastery of Spinjitzu. Using the second scroll, the Ninja defeat Aspheera, but Zane is hit with a spell aimed at Wu and gets transported to the Never-Realm. Wu volunteers to go to the Never-Realm on his own and rescue Zane, but the Ninja overpower him and go there themselves, before Wu could warn them that there is no way of return.\n\n====The Ice Chapter====\nThe Ninja arrive in the Never-Realm and are brought to a village where they reveal their agenda and help the locals fend off the Blizzard Samurai, led by the mysterious Ice Emperor and his right-hand man Vex. The Ninja believe that Zane was captured by the Ice Emperor and decide to stay at the village, where Kai unsuccessfully attempts to regain his powers, Cole leaves to find the Traveller's Tree in order to collect some leaves for the Travellers' Tea that would help them get back home, along the way befriending Krag, the last survivor of the Yeti species (as they were all slaughtered by the Blizzard Samurai), and Lloyd leaves to find Zane's mech. Along the way, he befriends a Formling named Akita, who can transform into a wolf and wishes to exact revenge on the Ice Emperor for freezing her people. Meanwhile, the village is attacked by the Ice Emperor's dragon Boreal, forcing the remaining Ninja to flee and continue their journey. Lloyd and Akita are later attacked by Boreal as well, who kidnaps Lloyd and takes him to the Ice Emperor, revealed to be none other than Zane: after being banished to the Never-Realm years ago (as time passes differently here), he lost his memory and was manipulated by Vex, a Formling who wished to exact revenge on his people for mocking him due to not being able to change his form, into believing that he is the Ice Emperor, the rightful ruler of the Never-Realm; the two of them then dethroned the actual Emperor, Grimfax, and Zane used the Scroll of Forbidden Spinjitzu to corrupt people, turning them into the Blizzard Samurai, later also freezing the Formlings and massacring the Yetis. Lloyd tries to get Zane to remember who he truly was, but fails, as the scroll corrupted him as well, and is locked up, where he meets Akita's brother Kataru. The two soon form and alliance with Grimfax (who became a general within the Blizzard Samurai army after being corrupted, but maintained all of his memories and wishes to reclaim his throne) to dethrone Zane and liberate the Never-Realm. Eventually, Kai recovers his powers, destroying Boreal, and Zane recovers his all of his memories after Vex attemplts to kill Lloyd, stopping him, before using his powers to undo the effects of the Forbidden Spinjitzu and restore peace to the Never-Realm. Afterwards, Grimfax becomes Emperor of the Never-Realm once again, Vex is banished for his crimes, and all the Ninja say goodbye to their newfound friends and allies, returning home in Ninjago.\n\n===Season 12: Prime Empire (2020)===\n\u201cWould you like to enter Prime Empire?\u201dA legendary arcade game has resurfaced, and the whole of NINJAGO City is hooked, but it soon becomes clear\u2026this is no ordinary game!

The current leader of the Ninja, son of Garmadon and Misako, nephew of Master Wu, and the grandson of the First Spinjitzu Master. He frequently wields either a [[sword]] or [[Dual wield|dual swords]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lego.com/en-gb/themes/ninjago/characters/lloyd-f2117af0c8ba45a297655963d70bee0c|title=Lego Ninjago \u2013 Lloyd|publisher=[[Lego.com]]|accessdate=2018-08-07}}</ref>  Lloyd's powers are vaguely defined, a fact admitted by his friends, but he possesses the ability to manipulate green energy and passively shield his body. Lloyd made his debut in Season 1 as a mischievous child wanting to be an evil warlord just like his father. This resulted in childish schemes that were often foiled by the original four Ninja. Lloyd was eventually captured and reformed by the Ninja and Master Wu, Lloyd's paternal uncle, and eventually discovered his destiny as the Green Ninja. While initially mischievous and naive, Lloyd has been tempered by experience and time into a mature and capable ninja. Though still the youngest, he has emerged as the natural leader of the Ninja, displaying wisdom beyond his years. Lloyd greatly appreciates his friends, saying that it was them who taught him the \"importance of being brave, of being strong, and most importantly, being good\". He believes the team's strength comes from \"no one being more important than the other\". Though he can still be rash in matters of family (especially regarding his father) there are few more dedicated and determined to protecting their friends and Ninjago.\n* '''Kai''' (voiced by [[Vincent Tong]]) \u2013 The Red Ninja and Elemental Master of [[Fire]]. Like Lloyd, he frequently wields either a sword or [[Dual wield|dual swords]]. His elemental power grants him limited [[pyrokinesis]] and fire immunity. Kai is fiercely loyal to his friends and family, often willing to do anything to ensure their safety. He often acts on emotion instead of reason, causing him to be hotheaded, cocky, and rash. He also has a strong sense of responsibility, feeling enormous guilt in situations where his friends suffer, such as when Zane sacrificed himself and when Lloyd was possessed. Kai is the elder brother of Nya and son of Ray and Maya.\n*  '''Jay''' (voiced by [[Michael Adamthwaite]]) \u2013 The Blue Ninja and Elemental Master of [[Lightning]]. He frequently wields [[nunchucks]] and more recently, a [[kusarigama]]. His elemental power grants him limited electricity manipulation. He is also a skilled [[mechanic]] and technologically savvy. Jay is inventive and quick-witted, often using comedy to alleviate stressful situations. He is easily excitable and prone to freaking out when in crises but like the other Ninja is intensely loyal to his friends, especially his girlfriend Nya. He is the son of Cliff Gordon and was adopted and raised by Ed and Edna Walker.\n* '''Zane''' (voiced by [[Brent Miller (actor)|Brent Miller]]) \u2013 The White/Titanium Ninja and Elemental Master of [[Ice]]. He frequently wields three pointed [[shuriken]] and, more recently, a [[bow and arrows]]. His elemental power grants him limited cryokinesis. Zane is intelligent and calculating, often providing intel to the other ninja as it applies to their situation. Initially, he lacked normal social skills. It was later revealed that this was due to Zane secretly being a nindroid, a fact unknown to both the Ninja and Zane himself. Though he is still logical and matter-of-fact, his brotherhood with the other Ninja have enabled him to pick up more human characteristics such as humor. He is the son/creation of Dr. Julien.\n* '''Cole''' (voiced by [[Kirby Morrow]]) \u2013 The grounded and solid Black Ninja and Elemental Master of [[Earth]]. He frequently wields a [[scythe]] and, in recent additions to the series, a [[war hammer]]. His elemental power grants him limited earth manipulation and [[super strength]]. The original leader of the Ninja, he is very loyal to his friends and family and has a special love for food, especially cake. \n* '''Nya''' (voiced by [[Kelly Metzger]]) \u2013 The Silver/Maroon Ninja, Elemental Master of [[Water]], and original Samurai X. She frequently wields a [[sword]] and, more recently, a [[spear]]. Her elemental power grants her hydrokinesis. Originally not a part of the Ninja team, Nya joined when her skills as an elemental master of water were needed to combat the threat of the ghost. Tough and determined, she refuses to let anyone tell her what to do. Though she can sometimes be stubborn, Nya true does care about her friends and family often making the most mature decisions of the group and serving as emotional support. A skilled mechanic, she often constructs vehicles for the other Ninja. Nya is Kai's younger sister, daughter of Ray and Maya, and girlfriend of Jay.\n* '''P.I.X.A.L. (Primary Interactive X-ternal Assistant Life-form)''' (voiced by Jennifer Hayward) \u2013 A female Nindroid who was originally an assistant to her creator/father Cyrus Borg. She joined the Ninja's team after being influenced by her fellow robot Zane. She was disassembled in season 4 but then uploaded into Zane's systems as an [[artificial intelligence]] system. In season 7, she secretly rebuilt herself and became the new Samurai X. She often provides technical support to the Ninja while serving as Zane's love interest.\n* '''Wu''' (voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]], Caleb Skeris as a baby, Madyx Whiteway as a child) \u2013 The wise, old master of the Ninja who frequently wields his father's staff. He is Lloyd's uncle, younger son of the First Spinjitzu Master, and brother to Garmadon. Because of his Oni heritage, Wu has lived for over a thousand years and has the power to create and manipulate matter. \n* '''Garmadon''' (voiced by Mark Oliver, Kai Emmett as a child) \u2013 Lloyd's father, Wu's older brother, and elder son of the First Spinjitzu Master. Garmadon was a main antagonist for the first two seasons but was later cleansed of evil and became a Sensei to the Ninja. In season 4 he was sacrificed to the Cursed Realm to stop Master Chen's Anacondrai Army. Garmadon was revived in season 8 by the Sons of Garmadon as a being of pure evil and proceeded to conquer all of Ninjago and proclaimed himself as the Realm's new Emperor. However at the end of season 9, Garmadon's reign of terror was finally brought to an end and he and the Sons of Garmadon were all arrested and locked up in Kryptarium Prison. In season 10, he was released to help the Ninja defeat the Oni, after which he left to an unknown part of Ninjago. Because of his Oni heritage, Garmadon has lived for over a thousand years and possesses the ability to destroy matter.\n\n===Ninja Allies===\n* '''Dareth''' (voiced by [[Alan Marriott (voice actor)|Alan Marriott]]) \u2013 The bumbling self-proclaimed \"Brown Ninja\" and Grand Sensei of Dareth's Mojo Dojo. He is a frequent ally of the Ninja both by choice and coincidence.\n* '''Mistak\u00e9''' (voiced by [[Mackenzie Gray]] Seasons 1\u20132, Mark Oliver Season 4, [[Tabitha St. Germain]] Seasons 8\u20139) \u2013 An often grouchy old lady who is old friends with Master Wu. She owns a tea shop that sells rare tea with magical properties. In season 9, she revealed to securely be an Oni in disguise. In the same season, it is implied that she was killed by Garmadon.\n* '''Cyrus Borg''' (voiced by [[Lee Tockar]]) \u2013  A tech genius and head of Borg Industries, he is the creator/father of P.I.X.A.L. who has invented all sorts of cutting edge electronic tools and gadgets. He first sought out the Ninja after the Digital Overlord overtook his systems and has built a variety of tools, security systems, machines, and [[vehicles]] to assist the Ninja.\n* '''Ronin''' (voiced by [[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]]) \u2013 A mercenary motivated by self-interest who will assist the Ninja if it suits his needs.\n* '''Police Commissioner''' (voiced by [[Michael Donovan]]) \u2013 The head of Ninjago police, he was originally introduced in season six as an antagonist who pursued the Ninja when they were framed for committing various crimes. Since the Ninja were proved innocent, however, he has assisted them both personally and with the full backing of the police force.\n* '''Krag''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]) - The last surviving yeti in the Never-Realm whom Cole befriends.\n\n===Family Members===\n* '''First Spinjitzu Master''' (voiced by Jim Conrad) - The Inventor of Spinjitzu, father of Wu and Garmadon, and grandfather of Lloyd. Originally from the Realm of Oni and Dragon, he created the realm of Ninjago and fought the Overlord to a standstill. He died long before the start of the series.\n* '''Misako''' (voiced by [[Kathleen Barr]]) \u2013 Garmadon's wife and Lloyd's mother. Misako is an [[archaeologist]] and frequent ally of the Ninja.\n* '''Dr. Julien''' (voiced by Mark Oliver) \u2013 The inventor The creator/father of Zane. He died sometime between seasons 2 and 3.\n* '''Ed Walker''' (voiced by Colin Murdock) \u2013 The adoptive father of Jay and the husband of Edna Walker, as well as the co-owner of Ed & Edna's Scrap N Junk.\n* '''Edna Walker''' (voiced by Jillian Michaels) \u2013 The adoptive mother of Jay and the wife of Ed Walker, as well as the co-owner of Ed & Edna's Scrap N Junk.\n* '''Lou''' (voiced by [[Kirby Morrow]]) \u2013 Cole's father and notable member of the Royal Blacksmiths, a famous song and [[dance troupe]].\n* '''Ray''' (voiced by [[Vincent Tong]]) \u2013 Kai and Nya's Father, and former Elemental Master of Fire. He previously fought alongside his wife under Masters Wu and Garmadon as part of the First Elemental Alliance during the First Serpentine War. He is a skilled [[blacksmith]].\n* '''Maya''' (voiced by Jillian Michaels) \u2013 Kai and Nya's mother and former Elemental Master of Water. She previously fought alongside her husband under Masters Wu and Garmadon as part of the First Elemental Alliance during the First Serpentine War.\n\n===Skulkin===\nThe Skulkin are a breed of living skeletons who were once ruled by Samukai. After becoming their leader, Garmadon sent the Skulkin to Ninjago to find the Four Golden Weapons of Spinjitzu, to which they do so. The Skulkin are defeated by the Ninja, though Samukai tries to use the Weapons himself. The power of the weapons destroys him, allowing Garmadon to escape his imprisonment and leaving the Skulkin leaderless. However, Garmadon rebands the Skulkin and leads them to rescue the Ninja and help them steal the Fang Blades from the Serpentine, as part of the temporary alliance Garmadon made with the Ninja to stop the Serpentine's leader Pythor from unleashing the Great Devourer, the very same giant snake who turned Garmadon evil. The Skulkin are willing to help along with this because, as Kruncha comments \"Everybody hates snakes.\"\n \n* '''Samukai''' (voiced by [[Michael Kopsa]]) \u2013 The four-armed Skulkin Ruler of the Underworld until Lord Garmadon defeated him in single combat and took over. He led the attacks on Ninjago, sent by Garmadon to retrieve the four Golden Weapons. He attempted to betray Garmadon by keeping the weapons for himself but, unable to control the power of the four golden weapons at once, was instead overloaded with power and killed. His body created a portal to another realm with Garmadon traveled though to amass more power. He temporarily returned on the Day of the Departed seeking revenge on Jay.\n* '''Kruncha''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]) \u2013 A brutish Skulkin General who served under Samukai and was part of the raids to retrieve the Golden Weapons. After the Skulkin's defeat, he found himself roaming Ninjago and taking odd jobs with Nuckal.\n* '''Nuckal''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]) \u2013 A crazy Skulkin General. He served under Samukai and was part of the raids to retrieve the Golden Weapons. After the Skulkin's defeat, he found himself roaming Ninjago and taking odd jobs with Kruncha.\n* '''Wyplash''' (voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]) \u2013 A paranoid Skulkin General. Unlike Samukai, Kruncha, and Nuckal, he was not part of the Golden Weapon raids. After the Skulkin were defeated, he attempted to ambush Nya but was soundly beaten by the lone warrior.\n\n===Serpentine===\nThe Serpentine are a warrior race of humanoid serpents. Originally a race created by the First Spinjitzu Master, they held a prophecy that foretold the coming of the Golden Master. Their attempts to warn the humans resulted in a war that culminated with them being driven underground, partly because both sides were manipulated by Master Chen. Released by Lloyd Garmadon, the Serpentine attempted to conquer Ninjago several times under the leadership of Pythor, Lord Garmadon, and finally Skales. However, after losing in battle to the Overlord's Stone Army, the Serpentine made a home for themselves underground and later aid the people of New Ninjago City escape the Golden Master's attack and then against Master Chen's army of fake Anacondrai.\n \n* '''The Great Devourer''' \u2013 A giant snake worshiped as a goddess by the Serpentine, known to be very dangerous and deadly with the ability to increase its size by consuming anything in its path, including its own kind. The Great Devourer is the main cause of the events in the series as it was responsible for turning Garmadon evil through its venom, and it was the Anacondrai General Pythor intended to release to exact revenge on the people of Ninjago. But the Great Devourer proved to be beyond anyone's control, swallowing Pythor and Sensei Wu alive, the former suffering side effects from exposure to the serpent's stomach acid, and running rampant on Ninjago with the Ninja unable to subdue it. However, in the end, the Ninja manage to lure the Devourer into a trap during its siege of Ninjago City, allowing Lord Garmadon to destroy the Great Devourer with the power of the Golden Weapons in revenge for the grief and madness it caused to him. Despite its death, the monster's venom still seeps into Ninjago City's sewage system, eventually reawakening the Stone Army. However, the Stone Army was eventually destroyed, and upon the Overlord Dragon's defeat Garmadon was cleansed of the Devourer's venom and its effects. It's proven to be female in season 7.\n* Anacondrai \u2013 An honor-bound anaconda-type Serpentine tribe that is the most feared of the Serpentine, able to turn themselves invisible. They are known for their purple coloration, and unlike other Serpentine tribes they all-not just their generals-have snake tails in place of legs. While their leading members were exiled to the Cursed Realm, the rest of the Anacondrai were trapped underground and apparently resorted to cannibalism until only Pythor remained. However, Master Chen and his group of cultists sought to bring them back, using dark magic to become Anacondrai themselves.\n** '''Pythor P. Chumsworth''' (voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]) \u2013 The General and last remaining member of the Anacondrai Tribe and former Snake King of the Serpentine, unique among his kind due to his elongated neck and habit of swallowing people larger than himself. Unlike his kind, Pythor is cowardly and dishonest yet has an arrogant sense of pride. While his tribe were sealed away, the Anacondrai Tribe had no food source and ultimately fell to starvation with Pythor becoming the sole survivor. Upon being released, Pythor pretended to be Lloyd's ally to steal the map to the Serpentine tombs to release the Constrictai and the Venomari Tribes. Soon after finding the lost city of Ouroborus, through deceit and an alliance with Skales, Pythor becomes the first Snake King of all Serpentine. It becomes clear soon that Pythor had been driven insane by his imprisonment and his hatred of the surface dwellers, using the allegiance of the tribes to unleash the Great Devourer to exact revenge on people of Ninjago for locking up the Serpentine underground. As the series progressed, Pythor finally managed to collect all four Silver Fang Blades, despite the oppression from the Ninja, Lord Garmadon, and the Skulkin, realizing too late that the Great Devourer would consume everything in its path, including himself alongside Sensei Wu. In season 3, Pythor is revealed to have survived his ordeal within the Great Devourer's stomach with his scales bleached white as he went into hiding. Still bent on revenge against the humans, Pythor aids the Overlord by converting Sensei Wu into Tech Wu and then tricking the ninja into giving him a beacon leading him to Lloyd. This season also revealed a fascination with a breed of electric eel/water snake known as electrocobrai, which he used as a power source for the Overlord and his creations. He swallows the shrinking pill that was meant for the Overlord in \"The Titanium Ninja\" and is chased by the Falcon. In season four he is among the many inmates of Kryptarium Prison-living in a dollhouse inside of a cell-and reveals to the ninja that the Anacondrai were tricked into attacking the humans during the war. He is captured by Chen and his sweat is used to make the Fake Anacondrai permanent, but he manages to discover a means of defeating them by releasing the spirits of the Anacondrai Generals. In gratitude for finally making them proud, Arcturus restores Pythor to his original size, though not his former coloration. He appears to be fond of the name \"Rodrigo\", as he applied this name to a toy basketball he owned while in prison and a rat that he tamed and rode into the final battle with the Anacondrai Cult.\n** '''General Arcturus''' (voiced by [[Scott McNeil]]) \u2013 General and leader of the Anacondrai Tribe and Supreme Leader of the Serpentine during the First Serpentine War. He and the other Anacondrai generals were banished to the Cursed Realm after being defeated by the Elemental Alliance. The ghosts of the Anacondrai generals were later freed in order to defeat Chen's Anacondrai Cultist Army.\n* Hypnobrai \u2013 A [[cobra]]-type Serpentine tribe that specializes in mind-control. They were locked in a frozen tomb in a tundra. All of them have red eyes they use to hypnotize victims (which explains that their name is a pun on \"Hypnotize\"). The symbol of the staff and the Hypnobrai has a hypnotizing shape like a swirl. Their color is blue.\n** '''Skales''' (voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]]) - Leader and general of the Hypnobrai Tribe and current Snake King of Serpentine following the perceived death of Pythor. Originally ranked a warrior, Skales became general after challenging and defeating then general Slithraa. After being defeated time and time again by the Ninja he and the rest of the Serpentine found themselves trapped underground by the Stone Army. The Serpentine then reformed, took an oath of [[pacifism]], and began to live peacefully alongside the other inhabitants of Ninjago. Skales settled down, started a family, and has assisted the Ninja in matters relating to snakes. Like all Hypnobrai, Skales can [[hypnosis|hypnotize]] his foes if they stare into his eyes. He is also a master of the ancient art of Fang-kwon-do.\n** '''Slithraa''' (voiced by [[John Novak]]) \u2013 The former leader and general of the Hypnobrai Tribe. After accidentally hypnotizing himself, he became a servant to Lloyd Garmadon and led his tribe in accomplishing the childish schemes of the young boy. Frustrated by being ordered around by a boy, Skales saw an opportunity to rise in power. After another failed scheme, Slithraa was challenged by Skales to a match in the Slither Pit for the right to lead the Hypnobrai. Slithraa was subsequently defeated by Skales and demoted to warrior.\n* Fangpyre \u2013 A [[pit viper]]-type Serpentine tribe who specializes in venomous bites that transforms the victim into a Serpentine (depending on their element) with snake-like traits. Strangely if a Fangpyre bites a vehicle, it transforms instantly. But if they bite a person, it takes a long time for them to transform (probably because the person's immune system fights the transformation). Their anti-venom, as with the other Serpentine Tribes, is located inside the staff of their tribe. If a Fangpyre bites another Fangpyre, the Fangpyre grows another head, resulting in the slightly comedic quirk that each head speaks halves or thirds of a sentence if it is long enough. The sign of the staff and the Fangpyre are fangs with a snake tongue sticking out.\n** '''Fangtom''' (voiced by [[Mackenzie Gray]]) \u2013 The two-headed leader and General of the Fangpyre Tribe. He is old friends with Skales and, like all Fangpyre, has the ability to turn anyone or anything into a snake by bitting and injecting them with his poisonous [[venom]].\n* Constrictai \u2013 A [[boa constrictor]]-type Serpentine tribe who specializes in constricting anyone and burrowing underground at a fast speed. They're also the shortest and the dumbest of all Serpentine tribes, but they are second strongest after the Anacondrai. The sign of the staff and the Constrictai is orange and has three rings connecting to each other representing constricting. The anti-venom in the staff awakens those knocked out when being choked. They were sealed within the Mountain of a Million Steps until released by Pythor.\n** '''Skalidor''' (voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]) \u2013 The powerful leader and general of the Constrictai Tribe. Like all Constrictai, Skalidor has the ability to burrow underground and possesses abundant strength.\n* Venomari \u2013 A [[spitting cobra]]-type Serpentine tribe with odd tusks and multiple eyes who specializes in spitting a hallucination-inducing venom. They were sealed in a tomb within the Poisonous Bogs until Pythor released them. The symbol of the staff and the Venomari is green with drops of venom coming out of the symbol.\n** '''Acidicus''' (voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]]) \u2013 The intelligent leader and general of the Venomari Tribe. Like all Venomari, Acidicus has the ability to spit venom at his foes which causes fear inducing [[hallucinations]].\n* Vermillion \u2013 The Vermillion are masses of snakes that can assume human form and are the pure first-generation progeny and children of the Great Devourer.\n** '''Machia''' (voiced by [[Kathleen Barr]]) \u2013 The Supreme Commander of the Vermillion Tribe with [[Gorgon]]-like hair.\n** '''Raggmunk''' (voiced by [[Michael Adamthwaite]]) \u2013 General of the Vermillion Tribe.\n** '''Blunck''' (voiced by [[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]]) \u2013 General of the Vermillion Tribe.\n* Pyro Vipers - A new, original tribe of Serpentine named by Gayle Gossip. They are the reanimated, zombified corpses of the original Serpentine race during the days of the First Spinjitzu Master, who may have evolved into the tribes known during the wars. Joined by the Elemental Cobras and Fire Fang, they're led by Queen Aspheera to wreak havoc on Ninjago, acquire the Forbidden Scroll and banish Master Wu to the Never-Realm. Their fate after attacking the Spinjago Monastery is unknown, but it's possible they were imprisoned in Kryptarium.\n** '''Aspheera''' (voiced by [[Pauline Newstone]]) - A young sorceress of the ancient Serpentine who desired to learn Spinjitzu. In exchange for learning combat, she released Garmadon and Wu from the dungeons after they trespassed on the valley against their father's law. Based on Aspheera's development, she and Wu became friends for the next few months/years, and Wu has her master Spinjitzu. However she betrays her promise to Wu, to never use Spinjitzu for evil, and overthrows King Mambo with the intention to conquer Ninjago for herself. Garmadon and Wu arm themselves with the Forbidden Scrolls on staffs and defeat Aspheera in the throne room.

It was created to coincide with the [[Lego Ninjago]] line of construction toys, many of which are based on elements of the series. It centers on the fictional world of Ninjago, telling the story of a group of teenage [[Ninja]] and their battles against the forces of evil. The series was animated in Copenhagen, Denmark, by Wil Film ApS for the Masters of Spinjitzu Saga (Season 1-10). Animation was relocated to [[WildBrain|WildBrain Studios]] in Canada for the Secrets of the Forbidden Spinjitzu and Prime Empire chapters. The English-language voice cast has been recorded in Canada for its entire run.\n\n''Ninjago'' began with two pilot episodes in January 2011, which were followed by two 13-episode seasons that aired from January to November 2012. Both the Lego theme and the series had an intended shelf life of three years, so the second season was originally intended to be the last. However, continued success of the series and its product line led to the show continuing ever since with twelve seasons being produced as of 2020.\n\nThe series was created by Michael Hegner and Tommy Andreasen, two Danish film producers. In Denmark, where the series' original production companies are located, ''Ninjago'' premiered on [[Nickelodeon (Denmark)|Nickelodeon]]. It airs on various Nickelodeon networks internationally and on [[Cartoon Network]] in the United States, United Kingdom and Poland. In [[Canada]], the series is broadcast on [[Teletoon]] and [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]].<ref name=teletoon>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonzone.net/2012/08/pr-teletoon-programming-highlights-september-2012/|title=PR: TELETOON Programming Highlights, September 2012|work=toonzone.net}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe show is mainly set in the [[realm]] of Ninjago, a place loosely inspired by [[East Asian culture|East Asian myths and culture]]. While featuring several historically designed buildings and traditional clothing, Ninjago is in a modern setting, incorporating large metropolises with skyscrapers, current-age (and futuristic) vehicles, modern electronics, semi-robotic exo-suits, and other futuristic technology.\n\n==Synopsis==\nLong before the events of the series, the First Spinjitzu Master used the power of the Golden Weapons to create the realm of Ninjago. Trained in the legendary art of Spinjitzu by the wise Master Wu, a group of heroic ninja (Kai, Jay, Cole, and Zane, and eventually Lloyd and Nya) fight to defend their land against the various foes who wish to conquer it.\n\n===Pilot Episodes (2011)===\nLong before time had a name, the First Spinjitzu Master created the [[realm]] of [[Ninjago]] with the four Golden Weapons of Spinjitzu: the Scythe of Quakes, the Shurikens of Ice, the Nunchucks of Lightning, and the Sword of Fire. Before he passed, his sons swore to protect the weapons from evil, but the older brother, Garmadon, was taken over by darkness and aimed to wield all four weapons so he could recreate Ninjago in his own image. In the ensuing battle between brothers, the younger brother Wu cast Garmadon down to the Underworld, hiding the weapons across the land and placing a guardian at each hiding spot. In anticipation of Garmadon's return, Wu seeks out four talented young Ninja to learn the ways of the Ninja, master the art of Spinjitzu, and find the Golden Weapons before Garmadon and his minions can claim them for their maniacal machinations.\n\n===Season 1: Rise of the Snakes (2012)===\nSince Lord Garmadon's disappearance, peace has returned to Ninjago. Rather than prepare for his return, the Ninja have become lazy, playing video games and eating junk food instead of continuing their training. With their guard down, they find themselves thrown back into action when Garmadon's son Lloyd releases the five warring tribes of Serpentine, a race of snake-people who once ruled over Ninjago before being sealed away in underground tombs. Now led by the treacherous Pythor P. Chumsworth, last of the fearsome Anacondrai, the vengeful snakes seek to find the four Silver Fangblades to awaken the Great Devourer, an indestructible giant serpent that grows the more it consumes. To stop them, the Ninja make new allies as they try to overcome emotional barriers and unlock their True Potential and trying to learn the identity of the legendary Green Ninja spoken of in a prophecy.\n\n===Season 2: Legacy of the Green Ninja (2012) ===\nAfter defeating the Great Devourer, Lord Garmadon has escaped with the Golden Weapons and taken command of the Serpentine. At the Golden Peaks, birthplace of the weapons, he forges them into a Mega Weapon. Able to create anything he pleases, Garmadon aims to interrupt Lloyd's training and prevent him from achieving his destiny as the Green Ninja. To ensure Lloyd is ready to face his father, the Ninja combat Garmadon's creations at every turn. But both sides are unaware of an evil dwelling on the fabled Island of Darkness pulling the strings for thousands of years to conquer all. The fate of Ninjago hangs in the balance as the Final Battle between good and evil looms closer.\n\n===Season 3: Rebooted (2014)===\nGood prevailed in the Final Battle with Lloyd as the Ultimate Spinjitzu Master defeating the Overlord and saving both Ninjago and his father. Ninjago City was left in ruin until genius inventor Cyrus Borg led the reconstruction process bringing about New Ninjago City, a hub of futuristic technological advancements. In this hi-tech age of peace, the Ninja have retired to teaching at Wu's Academy. During a field trip to Borg Tower, center of all this innovation, they discover that the Overlord has survived his fight with the Golden Ninja in the form of a virus, infecting Borg's systems. To escape the Digiverse, he plots to steal Lloyd's Golden Power and become a prophesized evil known as the Golden Master. Leaving Lloyd under the protection of a now pacifistic Sensei Garmadon, the Ninja must find the hard-drive containing the Digital Overlord and reboot the system with Borg's tech-hacking Techno Blades, to keep their friend safe and put an end to the Overlord's evil once and for all.\n\n===Season 4: The Tournament of Elements (2015)===\nTo defeat the Golden Master, Zane was forced to absorb power from the Golden Armor, sacrificing his life and leaving the Ninja team fractured in the process. But when notorious crime boss and noodle house owner Master Chen invites them to his Tournament of Elements; a competition between other Elemental Masters like them, with the promise of seeing Zane again, the Ninja, accompanied by Sensei Garmadon, find themselves traveling to Chen's Island and quickly making enemies. However, when they discover that Chen and his cult of Anacondrai worshippers use the Staff of Elements to strip those who lose of their Elemental Powers for a spell that could restart a war from Ninjago's past, they attempt to form an alliance with the Elemental Masters.\n\n===Season 5: Possession (2015)===\nChen and his Anacondrai Cultists have been banished to the Cursed Realm by General Arcturus and the Anacondrai Generals. But to free the generals, Garmadon had to take their place amongst the cursed. As a distraught Lloyd mourns the loss of his father, he is called to a solo mission where he is possessed by the jealous ghost of Wu's first student Morro, the Master of Wind, who escaped the Cursed Realm when Garmadon opened the portal. Now, the powerless Ninja face their friend as Morro aims to find the Tomb of the First Spinjitzu Master and use the Realm Crystal, gateway to the Sixteen Realms parallel to Ninjago, to allow his master to curse all that exists. To stop him, the Ninja ally with mercenary and shady businessman Ronin, mastering the lost art of Airjitzu and following three clues to the tomb's location engraved on Wu's staff. But the true key to victory lies with Nya, who learns she is the current Master of Water, which happens to be a ghost's greatest weakness and Nya finds her true potential.\n\n===Season 6: Skybound (2016)===\nTheir victory over the Preeminent has brought the Ninja overwhelming fame. While they struggle to continue to defend Ninjago while warding off obsessed fans, Jay tangles with seeing a future with Nya in the First Spinjitzu Master's Tomb. Things go further downhill for the heroes when the ghost of Chen's right-hand man Clouse (who survived the destruction of the Cursed Realm) releases Nadakhan the Djinn, the captain of the Misfortune's Keep and Sky Pirates. Framing the Ninja and reuniting with his crew, Nadakhan learns that the destruction of the Cursed Realm has caused the collapse of its Sister Realm and his former home and kingdom of Djinjago. With their fans turned against them and their team dwindling in numbers as the Djinn turns their wishes against them to trap them in his Sword of Souls, the Ninja find themselves in a battle across Ninjago to stop a vengeful Nadakhan from rebuilding his Realm with chunks of theirs. But when he sets his eyes on marrying Nya, a love-struck Jay must find the right wish to save his love, home, and friends.\n\n===Day of the Departed (2016)===\nOn the Day of the Departed, the people of Ninjago light lanterns to remember those they've lost. While his friends celebrate, Cole, whose ghostly state has deteriorated to the point of him randomly fading in and out of existence, intends to exact revenge on Master Yang for turning him into a ghost during the Ninja's attempt to learn Airjitzu. Commandeering the Yin Blade, a dark magic weapon Yang once used in an attempt to gain immortality, Cole enters the Temple of Airjitzu and prepares to \"close the circle\" by defeating the Airjitzu Master. But when his gambit for revenge leads to the accidental revival of some of the Ninja's greatest enemies, the heroes find themselves facing their vengeful foes once again as they attempt to take the Ninja's place amongst the living using magic Departed Blades. Meanwhile, Cole faces Yang and his students alone as, thanks to his actions, the Airjitzu Master has reclaimed the Yin Blade and plots to take advantage of a special Yin Yang Eclipse to cut the Rift of Return which will allow him to return to the living world.\n\n===Season 7: The Hands of Time (2017)===\nFollowing the events on the Day of the Departed, both Cole and the Temple of Airjitzu have been restored. As the Ninja setup base in the temple, they find themselves stuck cleaning up the damage at the Ninjago Museum of History. Here, they learn of the Hands of Time, twin Elemental Masters of Time itself who betrayed the Elemental Masters after the Serpentine Wars in belief their Element was the strongest. Meanwhile, at the ruins of the Monastery of Spinjitzu, Wu awaits the return of Acronix, the younger of the \"Time Twins\", to finish the battle they started 40 years ago. But without the rest of the team by his side, Wu is overwhelmed by Acronix who uses a move known as the \"Time Punch\" to accelerate Wu's aging one day per hour. Now Acronix has reunited with Krux, the older twin, who has remained hidden in Ninjago disguised as Museum Curator Dr. Saunders. The Ninja must now battle the Hands of Time and their army of Vermillion, the children of the Great Devourer, as they begin kidnapping Ninjago's best builders and stealing metal all over the city. But as they near closer to uncovering the villains' ultimate goal, the battle becomes personal for Kai and Nya who discover their parents may be involved with the Hands of Time.\n\n===Season 8: Sons of Garmadon (2018)===\nOne year after Wu and the Hands of Time were lost in time aboard the Iron Doom, the Ninja have scattered across Ninjago, tackling missions while searching for their master's whereabouts. In their absence, Ninjago City has been overrun by a cult-like crime syndicate known as the Sons of Garmadon who worship the evil Lord Garmadon. When a mysterious relic known as the Oni Mask of Vengeance is stolen from Borg Industries, The Ninja are summoned by the Royal Family, who ask the heroes to protect the three Oni Masks (The Oni Mask of Deception, the Oni Mask of Vengeance, and the Oni Mask of Hatred), relics from the First Realm which when united would allow the Sons of Garmadon to resurrect a purely evil Garmadon, as well as their adopted daughter, the Jade Princess Harumi. In order to stop the Sons of Garmadon from desecrating his father's sacrifice, Lloyd and the Ninja attempt to find the identity of their leader, the Quiet One, before they can determine the location of the elusive Oni Mask of Hatred, while learning secrets about the origins of Ninjago itself. In the process, Lloyd begins to bond with Harumi who has also lost her parents. But as they grow closer, the Ninja make the startling discovery that someone in their makeshift family is the Quiet One.\n\n===Season 9: Hunted (2018)===\nWith Emperor Garmadon in ruling Ninjago City with an iron fist and the original four Ninja as well as are stranded in Realm of Oni and Dragons after the Colossus destroyed the Destiny's Bounty, any ally of the Ninja and citizen is hunted and imprisoned in Kryptarium Prison. Lloyd, Nya, and the rest of their remaining allies, including a portion of the Elemental Masters, form a resistance to endure and fight back against Harumi, the Sons of Garmadon, and Lord Garmadon himself. Unbeknownst to them, the other Ninja are alive and thanks to Mistak\u00e9's Traveler's Tea, they are in the Realm of the Oni and the Dragon. Here, the barbaric Dragon Hunters, led by the power hungry Iron Baron, capture Dragons and exploit their Elemental Powers to sustain their society. As Dragons are the only beings who can ferry between Realms, the Ninja and a teenage Wu must find the mythical Dragon Armor once worn by the First Spinjitzu Master himself, in order to convince Firstbourne, the mother of all Dragons, to allow them to ride her children out of the Realm so they can rejoin the fight against Lord Garmadon, and save Ninjago.\n\n===Season 10: March of the Oni (2019)===\nShortly after Lord Garmadon's defeat, Ninjago is slowly returning to normal. However, Garmadon calls out to Lloyd to warn him about some dark forces that will soon conquer Ninjago, although Lloyd refuses to listen, believing that his father can't be trusted. Garmadon's warnings soon come true when the Oni invade Ninjago through the Realm Crystal and prove too much for the Ninja to handle. With no other choice, the Ninja form an uneasy alliance with Garmadon to defeat the Oni and save Ninjago from darkness. Will they prevail or will the legacy of Ninjago be lost forever?\n\n===Season 11: Secrets of the Forbidden Spinjitzu (2019-2020)===\n====Part 1: The Fire Chapter====\nSix months after they defeated the Oni, the Ninja have become relaxed, lazy, and out of shape. In order to keep their skills and powers intact, they search for activity or a threat to face. Strangely enough, Ninjago has been in a state of lasting peace. However, Zane begins suffering odd visions of him being killed by Aspheera, Queen of the evil Pyro Vipers, as well as a mysterious castle guarded by the dragon Boreal and home to the Ice Emperor and his Blizzard Samurai. While Zane remains unsure about these frightening visions, the Ninja find their quest when Professor [[Lego: The Adventures of Clutch Powers|Clutch Powers]] discovers a mysterious Ancient Pyramid which supposedly only a Ninja could survive exploring. Unbeknownst to them, the next threat to Ninjago is right around the corner, as the tomb serves as a prison for Aspheera. After she is unwillingly released by the Ninja, she steals Kai's powers and uses them to revive her army of Pyro Vipers, preparing to conquer Ninjago and exact revenge on somebody who betrayed her thousands of years ago. The Ninja are left trapped in the pyramid, but are eventually rescued by P.I.X.A.L., and attempt to stop Aspheera's campaign of conquest. The Ninja soon learn about the Scrolls of Forbidden Spinjitzu, which grant the user great powers, but can also corrupt them, as well as that Sensei Wu is the one that Aspheera is looking for, as he and Garmadon befriended her back when they were children and taught her Spinjitzu, but she betrayed them and used it for evil, taking over the Serpentines, leading to Wu and Garmadon defeating Aspheera using Forbidden Spinjitzu and imprisoning her inside the pyramid. After Aspheera steals one of the two Scrolls of Forbbiden from the museum, the Ninja go after the other, just as Aspheera and her forces attack the Monastery of Spinjitzu. Using the second scroll, the Ninja defeat Aspheera, but Zane is hit with a spell aimed at Wu and gets transported to the Never-Realm. Wu volunteers to go to the Never-Realm on his own and rescue Zane, but the Ninja overpower him and go there themselves, before Wu could warn them that there is no way of return.\n\n====Part 2: The Ice Chapter====\nThe Ninja arrive in the Never-Realm and are brought to a village where they reveal their agenda and help the locals fend off the Blizzard Samurai, led by the mysterious Ice Emperor and his right-hand man Vex. The Ninja believe that Zane was captured by the Ice Emperor and decide to stay at the village, where Kai unsuccessfully attempts to regain his powers, Cole leaves to find the Traveller's Tree in order to collect some leaves for the Travellers' Tea that would help them get back home, along the way befriending Krag, the last survivor of the Yeti species (as they were all slaughtered by the Blizzard Samurai), and Lloyd leaves to find Zane's mech. Along the way, he befriends a Formling named Akita, who can transform into a wolf and wishes to exact revenge on the Ice Emperor for freezing her people. Meanwhile, the village is attacked by the Ice Emperor's dragon Boreal, forcing the remaining Ninja to flee and continue their journey. Lloyd and Akita are later attacked by Boreal as well, who kidnaps Lloyd and takes him to the Ice Emperor, revealed to be none other than Zane: after being banished to the Never-Realm years ago (as time passes differently here), he lost his memory and was manipulated by Vex, a Formling who wished to exact revenge on his people for mocking him due to not being able to change his form, into believing that he is the Ice Emperor, the rightful ruler of the Never-Realm; the two of them then dethroned the actual Emperor, Grimfax, and Zane used the Scroll of Forbidden Spinjitzu to corrupt people, turning them into the Blizzard Samurai, later also freezing the Formlings and massacring the Yetis. Lloyd tries to get Zane to remember who he truly was, but fails, as the scroll corrupted him as well, and is locked up, where he meets Akita's brother Kataru. The two soon form and alliance with Grimfax (who became a general within the Blizzard Samurai army after being corrupted, but maintained all of his memories and wishes to reclaim his throne) to dethrone Zane and liberate the Never-Realm. Eventually, Kai recovers his powers, destroying Boreal, and Zane recovers his all of his memories after Vex attemplts to kill Lloyd, stopping him, before using his powers to undo the effects of the Forbidden Spinjitzu and restore peace to the Never-Realm. Afterwards, Grimfax becomes Emperor of the Never-Realm once again, Vex is banished for his crimes, and all the Ninja say goodbye to their newfound friends and allies, returning home in Ninjago.\n\n===Season 12: Prime Empire (2020)===\nWhen the old, legendary video-game, \"Prime Empire\", resurfaces, players begin to disappear. After Jay plays and then disappears, the Ninja must enter a dangerous digital world ruled by the mysterious villain Unagami to save him.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Characters by voice actor and season\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Character\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Pilots: Masters of Spinjitzu (2011)|Pilot]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 1: Rise of the Snakes (2012)|1]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 2: Legacy of the Green Ninja (2012)|2]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 3: Rebooted (2014)|3]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 4: Tournament of Elements (2015)|4]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 5: Possession (2015)|5]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 6: Skybound (2016)|6]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 7: The Hands of Time (2017)|7]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 8: Sons of Garmadon (2018)|8]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 9: Hunted (2018)|9]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 10: March of the Oni (2019)|10]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 11: Secrets of the Forbidden Spinjitzu (2019)|11]]\n! scope=\"col\" width=80 | [[List of Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu episodes#Season 12: Prime Empire (2020)|12]]\n|-\n!

The current leader of the Ninja, son of Garmadon and Misako, nephew of Master Wu, and the grandson of the First Spinjitzu Master. He frequently wields either a [[sword]] or [[Dual wield|dual swords]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lego.com/en-gb/themes/ninjago/characters/lloyd-f2117af0c8ba45a297655963d70bee0c|title=Lego Ninjago \u2013 Lloyd|publisher=[[Lego.com]]|accessdate=2018-08-07}}</ref>  Lloyd's powers are vaguely defined, a fact admitted by his friends, but he possesses the ability to manipulate green energy and passively shield his body. Lloyd made his debut in Season 1 as a mischievous child wanting to be an evil warlord just like his father. This resulted in childish schemes that were often foiled by the original four Ninja. Lloyd was eventually captured and reformed by the Ninja and Master Wu, Lloyd's paternal uncle, and eventually discovered his destiny as the Green Ninja. While initially mischievous and naive, Lloyd has been tempered by experience and time into a mature and capable ninja. Though still the youngest, he has emerged as the natural leader of the Ninja, displaying wisdom beyond his years. Lloyd greatly appreciates his friends, saying that it was them who taught him the \"importance of being brave, of being strong, and most importantly, being good\". He believes the team's strength comes from \"no one being more important than the other\". Though he can still be rash in matters of family (especially regarding his father) there are few more dedicated and determined to protecting their friends and Ninjago.\n* '''Kai''' (voiced by [[Vincent Tong]]) \u2013 The Red Ninja and Elemental Master of [[Fire]]. Like Lloyd, he frequently wields either a sword or [[Dual wield|dual swords]]. His elemental power grants him limited [[pyrokinesis]] and fire immunity. Kai is fiercely loyal to his friends and family, often willing to do anything to ensure their safety. He often acts on emotion instead of reason, causing him to be hotheaded, cocky, and rash. He also has a strong sense of responsibility, feeling enormous guilt in situations where his friends suffer, such as when Zane sacrificed himself and when Lloyd was possessed. Kai is the elder brother of Nya and son of Ray and Maya.\n*  '''Jay Walker (born Jay Gordon)''' (voiced by [[Michael Adamthwaite]]) \u2013 The Blue Ninja and Elemental Master of [[Lightning]]. He frequently wields [[nunchucks]] and more recently, a [[kusarigama]]. His elemental power grants him limited electricity manipulation. He is also a skilled [[mechanic]] and technologically savvy. Jay is inventive and quick-witted, often using comedy to alleviate stressful situations. He is easily excitable and prone to freaking out when in crises but like the other Ninja is intensely loyal to his friends, especially his girlfriend Nya. He is the son of Cliff Gordon and was adopted and raised by Ed and Edna Walker.\n* '''Zane''' (voiced by [[Brent Miller (actor)|Brent Miller]]) \u2013 The White/Titanium Ninja and Elemental Master of [[Ice]]. He frequently wields three pointed [[shuriken]] and, more recently, a [[bow and arrows]]. His elemental power grants him limited cryokinesis. Zane is intelligent and calculating, often providing intel to the other ninja as it applies to their situation. Initially, he lacked normal social skills. It was later revealed that this was due to Zane secretly being a nindroid, a fact unknown to both the Ninja and Zane himself. Though he is still logical and matter-of-fact, his brotherhood with the other Ninja have enabled him to pick up more human characteristics such as humor. He is the son/creation of Dr. Julien.\n* '''Cole''' (voiced by [[Kirby Morrow]]) \u2013 The grounded and solid Black Ninja and Elemental Master of [[Earth]]. He frequently wields a [[scythe]] and, in recent additions to the series, a [[war hammer]]. His elemental power grants him limited earth manipulation and [[super strength]]. The original leader of the Ninja, he is very loyal to his friends and family and has a special love for food, especially cake. \n* '''Nya''' (voiced by [[Kelly Metzger]]) \u2013 The Silver/Maroon Ninja, Elemental Master of [[Water]], and original Samurai X. She frequently wields a [[sword]] and, more recently, a [[spear]]. Her elemental power grants her hydrokinesis. Originally not a part of the Ninja team, Nya joined when her skills as an elemental master of water were needed to combat the threat of the ghost. Tough and determined, she refuses to let anyone tell her what to do. Though she can sometimes be stubborn, Nya true does care about her friends and family often making the most mature decisions of the group and serving as emotional support. A skilled mechanic, she often constructs vehicles for the other Ninja. Nya is Kai's younger sister, daughter of Ray and Maya, and girlfriend of Jay.\n* '''P.I.X.A.L. (Primary Interactive X-ternal Assistant Life-form)''' (voiced by Jennifer Hayward) \u2013 A female Nindroid who was originally an assistant to her creator/father Cyrus Borg. She joined the Ninja's team after being influenced by her fellow robot Zane. She was disassembled in season 4 but then uploaded into Zane's systems as an [[artificial intelligence]] system. In season 7, she secretly rebuilt herself and became the new Samurai X. She often provides technical support to the Ninja while serving as Zane's love interest.\n* '''Sensei/Master Wu''' (voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]], Caleb Skeris as a baby, Madyx Whiteway as a child) \u2013 The wise, old master of the Ninja who frequently wields his father's staff. He is Lloyd's uncle, younger son of the First Spinjitzu Master, and brother to Garmadon. Because of his Oni heritage, Wu has lived for over a thousand years and has the power to create and manipulate matter. \n* '''Lord/Sensei/Master/Emperor Garmadon''' (voiced by Mark Oliver, Kai Emmett as a child) \u2013 Lloyd's father, Wu's older brother, and elder son of the First Spinjitzu Master. Garmadon was a main antagonist for the first two seasons but was later cleansed of evil and became a Sensei to the Ninja. In season 4 he was sacrificed to the Cursed Realm to stop Master Chen's Anacondrai Army. Garmadon was revived in season 8 by the Sons of Garmadon as a being of pure evil and proceeded to conquer all of Ninjago and proclaimed himself as the Realm's new Emperor. However at the end of season 9, Garmadon's reign of terror was finally brought to an end and he and the Sons of Garmadon were all arrested and locked up in Kryptarium Prison. In season 10, he was released to help the Ninja defeat the Oni, after which he left to an unknown part of Ninjago. Because of his Oni heritage, Garmadon has lived for over a thousand years and possesses the ability to destroy matter.\n\n===Ninja Allies===\n* '''Dareth''' (voiced by [[Alan Marriott (voice actor)|Alan Marriott]]) \u2013 The bumbling self-proclaimed \"Brown Ninja\" and Grand Sensei of Dareth's Mojo Dojo. He is a frequent ally of the Ninja both by choice and coincidence.\n* '''Mistak\u00e9''' (voiced by [[Mackenzie Gray]] Seasons 1\u20132, Mark Oliver Season 4, [[Tabitha St. Germain]] Seasons 8\u20139) \u2013 An often grouchy old lady who is old friends with Master Wu. She owns a tea shop that sells rare tea with magical properties. In season 9, she revealed to securely be an Oni in disguise. In the same season, it is implied that she was killed by Garmadon.\n* '''Cyrus Borg''' (voiced by [[Lee Tockar]]) \u2013  A tech genius and head of Borg Industries, he is the creator/father of P.I.X.A.L. who has invented all sorts of cutting edge electronic tools and gadgets. He first sought out the Ninja after the Digital Overlord overtook his systems and has built a variety of tools, security systems, machines, and [[vehicles]] to assist the Ninja.\n* '''Ronin''' (voiced by [[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]]) \u2013 A mercenary motivated by self-interest who will assist the Ninja if it suits his needs.\n* '''Police Commissioner''' (voiced by [[Michael Donovan]]) \u2013 The head of Ninjago police, he was originally introduced in season six as an antagonist who pursued the Ninja when they were framed for committing various crimes. Since the Ninja were proved innocent, however, he has assisted them both personally and with the full backing of the police force.\n* '''Krag''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]) - The last surviving yeti in the Never-Realm whom Cole befriends.\n\n===Family Members===\n* '''First Spinjitzu Master''' (voiced by Jim Conrad) - The Inventor of Spinjitzu, father of Wu and Garmadon, and grandfather of Lloyd. Originally from the Realm of Oni and Dragon, he created the realm of Ninjago and fought the Overlord to a standstill. He died long before the start of the series.\n* '''Misako''' (voiced by [[Kathleen Barr]]) \u2013 Garmadon's wife and Lloyd's mother. Misako is an [[archaeologist]] and frequent ally of the Ninja.\n* '''Dr. Julien''' (voiced by Mark Oliver) \u2013 The inventor The creator/father of Zane. He died sometime between seasons 2 and 3.\n* '''Ed Walker''' (voiced by Colin Murdock) \u2013 The adoptive father of Jay and the husband of Edna Walker, as well as the co-owner of Ed & Edna's Scrap N Junk.\n* '''Edna Walker''' (voiced by Jillian Michaels) \u2013 The adoptive mother of Jay and the wife of Ed Walker, as well as the co-owner of Ed & Edna's Scrap N Junk.\n* '''Lou''' (voiced by [[Kirby Morrow]]) \u2013 Cole's father and notable member of the Royal Blacksmiths, a famous song and [[dance troupe]].\n* '''Ray''' (voiced by [[Vincent Tong]]) \u2013 Kai and Nya's Father, and former Elemental Master of Fire. He previously fought alongside his wife under Masters Wu and Garmadon as part of the First Elemental Alliance during the First Serpentine War. He is a skilled [[blacksmith]].\n* '''Maya''' (voiced by Jillian Michaels) \u2013 Kai and Nya's mother and former Elemental Master of Water. She previously fought alongside her husband under Masters Wu and Garmadon as part of the First Elemental Alliance during the First Serpentine War.\n\n===Skulkin===\nThe Skulkin are a breed of living skeletons who were once ruled by Samukai. After becoming their leader, Garmadon sent the Skulkin to Ninjago to find the Four Golden Weapons of Spinjitzu, to which they do so. The Skulkin are defeated by the Ninja, though Samukai tries to use the Weapons himself. The power of the weapons destroys him, allowing Garmadon to escape his imprisonment and leaving the Skulkin leaderless. However, Garmadon rebands the Skulkin and leads them to rescue the Ninja and help them steal the Fang Blades from the Serpentine, as part of the temporary alliance Garmadon made with the Ninja to stop the Serpentine's leader Pythor from unleashing the Great Devourer, the very same giant snake who turned Garmadon evil. The Skulkin are willing to help along with this because, as Kruncha comments \"Everybody hates snakes.\"\n \n* '''Samukai''' (voiced by [[Michael Kopsa]]) \u2013 The four-armed Skulkin Ruler of the Underworld until Lord Garmadon defeated him in single combat and took over. He led the attacks on Ninjago, sent by Garmadon to retrieve the four Golden Weapons. He attempted to betray Garmadon by keeping the weapons for himself but, unable to control the power of the four golden weapons at once, was instead overloaded with power and killed. His body created a portal to another realm with Garmadon traveled though to amass more power. He temporarily returned on the Day of the Departed seeking revenge on Jay.\n* '''Kruncha''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]) \u2013 A brutish Skulkin General who served under Samukai and was part of the raids to retrieve the Golden Weapons. After the Skulkin's defeat, he found himself roaming Ninjago and taking odd jobs with Nuckal.\n* '''Nuckal''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]) \u2013 A crazy Skulkin General. He served under Samukai and was part of the raids to retrieve the Golden Weapons. After the Skulkin's defeat, he found himself roaming Ninjago and taking odd jobs with Kruncha.\n* '''Wyplash''' (voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]) \u2013 A paranoid Skulkin General. Unlike Samukai, Kruncha, and Nuckal, he was not part of the Golden Weapon raids. After the Skulkin were defeated, he attempted to ambush Nya but was soundly beaten by the lone warrior.\n\n===Serpentine===\nThe Serpentine are a warrior race of humanoid serpents. Originally a race created by the First Spinjitzu Master, they held a prophecy that foretold the coming of the Golden Master. Their attempts to warn the humans resulted in a war that culminated with them being driven underground, partly because both sides were manipulated by Master Chen. Released by Lloyd Garmadon, the Serpentine attempted to conquer Ninjago several times under the leadership of Pythor, Lord Garmadon, and finally Skales. However, after losing in battle to the Overlord's Stone Army, the Serpentine made a home for themselves underground and later aid the people of New Ninjago City escape the Golden Master's attack and then against Master Chen's army of fake Anacondrai.\n \n* '''The Great Devourer''' \u2013 A giant snake worshiped as a goddess by the Serpentine, known to be very dangerous and deadly with the ability to increase its size by consuming anything in its path, including its own kind. The Great Devourer is the main cause of the events in the series as it was responsible for turning Garmadon evil through its venom, and it was the Anacondrai General Pythor intended to release to exact revenge on the people of Ninjago. But the Great Devourer proved to be beyond anyone's control, swallowing Pythor and Sensei Wu alive, the former suffering side effects from exposure to the serpent's stomach acid, and running rampant on Ninjago with the Ninja unable to subdue it. However, in the end, the Ninja manage to lure the Devourer into a trap during its siege of Ninjago City, allowing Lord Garmadon to destroy the Great Devourer with the power of the Golden Weapons in revenge for the grief and madness it caused to him. Despite its death, the monster's venom still seeps into Ninjago City's sewage system, eventually reawakening the Stone Army. However, the Stone Army was eventually destroyed, and upon the Overlord Dragon's defeat Garmadon was cleansed of the Devourer's venom and its effects. It's proven to be female in season 7.\n* Anacondrai \u2013 An honor-bound anaconda-type Serpentine tribe that is the most feared of the Serpentine, able to turn themselves invisible. They are known for their purple coloration, and unlike other Serpentine tribes they all-not just their generals-have snake tails in place of legs. While their leading members were exiled to the Cursed Realm, the rest of the Anacondrai were trapped underground and apparently resorted to cannibalism until only Pythor remained. However, Master Chen and his group of cultists sought to bring them back, using dark magic to become Anacondrai themselves.\n** '''Pythor P. Chumsworth''' (voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]) \u2013 The General and last remaining member of the Anacondrai Tribe and former Snake King of the Serpentine, unique among his kind due to his elongated neck and habit of swallowing people larger than himself. Unlike his kind, Pythor is cowardly and dishonest yet has an arrogant sense of pride. While his tribe were sealed away, the Anacondrai Tribe had no food source and ultimately fell to starvation with Pythor becoming the sole survivor. Upon being released, Pythor pretended to be Lloyd's ally to steal the map to the Serpentine tombs to release the Constrictai and the Venomari Tribes. Soon after finding the lost city of Ouroborus, through deceit and an alliance with Skales, Pythor becomes the first Snake King of all Serpentine. It becomes clear soon that Pythor had been driven insane by his imprisonment and his hatred of the surface dwellers, using the allegiance of the tribes to unleash the Great Devourer to exact revenge on people of Ninjago for locking up the Serpentine underground. As the series progressed, Pythor finally managed to collect all four Silver Fang Blades, despite the oppression from the Ninja, Lord Garmadon, and the Skulkin, realizing too late that the Great Devourer would consume everything in its path, including himself alongside Sensei Wu. In season 3, Pythor is revealed to have survived his ordeal within the Great Devourer's stomach with his scales bleached white as he went into hiding. Still bent on revenge against the humans, Pythor aids the Overlord by converting Sensei Wu into Tech Wu and then tricking the ninja into giving him a beacon leading him to Lloyd. This season also revealed a fascination with a breed of electric eel/water snake known as electrocobrai, which he used as a power source for the Overlord and his creations. He swallows the shrinking pill that was meant for the Overlord in \"The Titanium Ninja\" and is chased by the Falcon. In season four he is among the many inmates of Kryptarium Prison-living in a dollhouse inside of a cell-and reveals to the ninja that the Anacondrai were tricked into attacking the humans during the war. He is captured by Chen and his sweat is used to make the Fake Anacondrai permanent, but he manages to discover a means of defeating them by releasing the spirits of the Anacondrai Generals. In gratitude for finally making them proud, Arcturus restores Pythor to his original size, though not his former coloration. He appears to be fond of the name \"Rodrigo\", as he applied this name to a toy basketball he owned while in prison and a rat that he tamed and rode into the final battle with the Anacondrai Cult.\n** '''General Arcturus''' (voiced by [[Scott McNeil]]) \u2013 General and leader of the Anacondrai Tribe and Supreme Leader of the Serpentine during the First Serpentine War. He and the other Anacondrai generals were banished to the Cursed Realm after being defeated by the Elemental Alliance. The ghosts of the Anacondrai generals were later freed in order to defeat Chen's Anacondrai Cultist Army.\n* Hypnobrai \u2013 A [[cobra]]-type Serpentine tribe that specializes in mind-control. They were locked in a frozen tomb in a tundra. All of them have red eyes they use to hypnotize victims (which explains that their name is a pun on \"Hypnotize\"). The symbol of the staff and the Hypnobrai has a hypnotizing shape like a swirl. Their color is blue.\n** '''Skales''' (voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]]) - Leader and general of the Hypnobrai Tribe and current Snake King of Serpentine following the perceived death of Pythor. Originally ranked a warrior, Skales became general after challenging and defeating then general Slithraa. After being defeated time and time again by the Ninja he and the rest of the Serpentine found themselves trapped underground by the Stone Army. The Serpentine then reformed, took an oath of [[pacifism]], and began to live peacefully alongside the other inhabitants of Ninjago. Skales settled down, started a family, and has assisted the Ninja in matters relating to snakes. Like all Hypnobrai, Skales can [[hypnosis|hypnotize]] his foes if they stare into his eyes. He is also a master of the ancient art of Fang-kwon-do.\n** '''Slithraa''' (voiced by [[John Novak]]) \u2013 The former leader and general of the Hypnobrai Tribe. After accidentally hypnotizing himself, he became a servant to Lloyd Garmadon and led his tribe in accomplishing the childish schemes of the young boy. Frustrated by being ordered around by a boy, Skales saw an opportunity to rise in power. After another failed scheme, Slithraa was challenged by Skales to a match in the Slither Pit for the right to lead the Hypnobrai. Slithraa was subsequently defeated by Skales and demoted to warrior.\n* Fangpyre \u2013 A [[pit viper]]-type Serpentine tribe who specializes in venomous bites that transforms the victim into a Serpentine (depending on their element) with snake-like traits. Strangely if a Fangpyre bites a vehicle, it transforms instantly. But if they bite a person, it takes a long time for them to transform (probably because the person's immune system fights the transformation). Their anti-venom, as with the other Serpentine Tribes, is located inside the staff of their tribe. If a Fangpyre bites another Fangpyre, the Fangpyre grows another head, resulting in the slightly comedic quirk that each head speaks halves or thirds of a sentence if it is long enough. The sign of the staff and the Fangpyre are fangs with a snake tongue sticking out.\n** '''Fangtom''' (voiced by [[Mackenzie Gray]]) \u2013 The two-headed leader and General of the Fangpyre Tribe. He is old friends with Skales and, like all Fangpyre, has the ability to turn anyone or anything into a snake by bitting and injecting them with his poisonous [[venom]].\n* Constrictai \u2013 A [[boa constrictor]]-type Serpentine tribe who specializes in constricting anyone and burrowing underground at a fast speed. They're also the shortest and the dumbest of all Serpentine tribes, but they are second strongest after the Anacondrai. The sign of the staff and the Constrictai is orange and has three rings connecting to each other representing constricting. The anti-venom in the staff awakens those knocked out when being choked. They were sealed within the Mountain of a Million Steps until released by Pythor.\n** '''Skalidor''' (voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]) \u2013 The powerful leader and general of the Constrictai Tribe. Like all Constrictai, Skalidor has the ability to burrow underground and possesses abundant strength.\n* Venomari \u2013 A [[spitting cobra]]-type Serpentine tribe with odd tusks and multiple eyes who specializes in spitting a hallucination-inducing venom. They were sealed in a tomb within the Poisonous Bogs until Pythor released them. The symbol of the staff and the Venomari is green with drops of venom coming out of the symbol.\n** '''Acidicus''' (voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]]) \u2013 The intelligent leader and general of the Venomari Tribe. Like all Venomari, Acidicus has the ability to spit venom at his foes which causes fear inducing [[hallucinations]].\n* Vermillion \u2013 The Vermillion are masses of snakes that can assume human form and are the pure first-generation progeny and children of the Great Devourer.\n** '''Machia''' (voiced by [[Kathleen Barr]]) \u2013 The Supreme Commander of the Vermillion Tribe with [[Gorgon]]-like hair.\n** '''Raggmunk''' (voiced by [[Michael Adamthwaite]]) \u2013 General of the Vermillion Tribe.\n** '''Blunck''' (voiced by [[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]]) \u2013 General of the Vermillion Tribe.\n* Pyro Vipers - A new, original tribe of Serpentine named by Gayle Gossip. They are the reanimated, zombified corpses of the original Serpentine race during the days of the First Spinjitzu Master, who may have evolved into the tribes known during the wars. Joined by the Elemental Cobras and Fire Fang, they're led by Queen Aspheera to wreak havoc on Ninjago, acquire the Forbidden Scroll and banish Master Wu to the Never-Realm. Their fate after attacking the Spinjago Monastery is unknown, but it's possible they were imprisoned in Kryptarium.\n** '''Aspheera''' (voiced by [[Pauline Newstone]]) - A young sorceress of the ancient Serpentine who desired to learn Spinjitzu. In exchange for learning combat, she released Garmadon and Wu from the dungeons after they trespassed on the valley against their father's law. Based on Aspheera's development, she and Wu became friends for the next few months/years, and Wu has her master Spinjitzu. However she betrays her promise to Wu, to never use Spinjitzu for evil, and overthrows King Mambo with the intention to conquer Ninjago for herself. Garmadon and Wu arm themselves with the Forbidden Scrolls on staffs and defeat Aspheera in the throne room. She blames Wu for not teaching her Forbidden Spinjitzu and turning on her, believing that her actions of mutiny were acceptable. When she's sentenced to magical entombment, she swears vengeance on Wu. Around a thousand years later, Jay and Nya accidentally set her free when the Ninja are exploring the pyramid in the Desert of Doom. It was a vision predicted by Zane since the season's beginning. Aspheera steals Kai's fire powers and revives the mummified Serpentines. She destroys the pyramid, summons an army of cobras and her Fire Fang serpent. She comes to conflict with the Ninja multiple times upon seizing the Forbidden Scroll. She corners Wu, Kai, Jay, and Cole in the Monastery's cave, and fights P.I.X.A.L.'s Titan Mech. The fight is joined by Lloyd, Nya, and Zane, who have found the second Forbidden Scroll. Aspheera is defeated by Zane and locked in Kryptarium Prison in Garmadon's cell, but not before banishing Zane to the forsaken Never-Realm.\n** '''Char''' (voiced by [[Brian Drummond]]) - Aspheera's second in command, who displays attraction to his mistress and immense loyalty. He behaves like an immature child, which gets on Aspheera's nerves, but serves fiercely to the end.\n** '''King Mambo The Fifth''' (voiced by [[Michael Dobson (actor)|Michael Dobson]]) - The original king of the Serpentine during the days of the First Spinjitzu Master, who has Garmadon and Wu imprisoned after breaking their truce. He was overthrown by Aspheera but restored to his rightful place on the throne when Wu defeats Aspheera. He then sentences Aspheera to magical entombment as punishment.\n\n===Overlord's Forces===\n* '''The Overlord''' (voiced by [[Scott McNeil]]) \u2013 The Ultimate Evil who fought the First Spinjitzu Master to a draw. Lloyd defeated the Overlord in the Season 2 finale by unlocking his Golden Powers. The Overlord returned in Season 3 as a digital entity who seeped into and took over the technology of New Ninjago City.\n* '''General Kozu''' (voiced by [[Paul Dobson (actor)|Paul Dobson]]) \u2013 The four-armed general of the Overlord's Stone Army. He is the only member of the Stone Army that can speak English.\n* '''General Cryptor''' (voiced by [[Richard Newman (actor)|Richard Newman]]) \u2013 The general of the Overlord's Nindroid Army.\n* '''Min-Droid''' (voiced by [[Michael Adamthwaite]]) \u2013 A member of the Nindroid Army who is shorter the rest of his robotic brethren because the factory that produced him ran out of metal. He is highly sensitive about his size and teasing at the hands of the other Nindroids (especially Cryptor) have given him a short-tempered and vicious disposition. Despite his size, he is actually a capable and observant fighter.\n\n===Anacondrai Cultists===\n* '''Master Chen''' (voiced by [[Ian James Corlett]]) \u2013 Skylor's father and leader of the Anacondrai Cultists. He was exiled to an island after allying himself with the Serpentine and betraying humanity during the first Serpentine War. He later attempted to steal the powers of the elemental masters to transform him and his followers into powerful Anacondrai warriors to conquer Ninjago but was defeated and banished to the Cursed Realm. Chen was destroyed when the Preeminent was dropped into the ocean. He was later resurrected by Yang seeking revenge on Kai and Nya.\n* '''Clouse''' (voiced by [[Scott McNeil]]) \u2013 A dark sorcerer and Chen's right-hand man. He and Garmadon previously trained under Master Chen before the First Serpentine War. He was sent to the Cursed Realm after being defeated by Garmadon, but escaped the realm before its destruction. He is currently roaming Ninjago as ghost, his whereabouts unknown.\n* '''Eyezor''' (voiced by [[Michael Donovan]]) \u2013 A smug and aggressive one-eyed general of Chen's cult. He oversaw transportation of goods from the noodle factory to Chen's off island noodle house.\n* '''Zugu''' (voiced by [[Brian Dobson (actor)|Brian Dobson]]) \u2013 A hulking and immovable general of Chen's cult.

The Ninja travel to the Toxic Bogs, after which they have a vision of weapons that can restore their memories. They collect the weapons and go to see Lloyd, who takes them to see his mother for help. Once they find the Primal Fulcrum, the Ninja free Lloyd's mother from Ronin's control. Ronin freezes them and grabs the remaining elemental forges.

Its plantigrade feet have the bottom mostly covered by a single pad that is cream-colored like its belly, while its eyes are light blue in color. When Charizard is Mega Evolved, it can take on one of two forms. Both forms are characterized by white pupils, bigger and sharper teeth, claws and horns and the bright coloring of the belly reaching the whole bottom of the muzzle, that also features a more pronounced beak. In its \"X\" form, its color scheme changes from orange and cream to black and blue, with red eyes, two claws appearing on each shoulder and wings acquiring a multilobed, feather-like structure. The flame at the tip of its tail becomes blue and blue flames are constantly breathed out from the sides of its mouth. In its \"Y\" form, its appearance is influenced by that of [[Pteranodon]]s, with a central big pointed horn, loss of fingers passing through the patagia of the main wings that increase in size, smaller wings stemming from Pteranodon-like hands. It also gains a more slender appearance with a thinner torso, a longer tail and digitigrade feet that are longer and devoid of pads.\n\nThe video games describe Charizard as having wings that can carry them close to an altitude of 4,600&nbsp;feet,<ref name=\"dexfirered\">{{pok\u00e9dex|firered|Its wings can carry this Pok\u00e9mon close to an altitude of 4,600&nbsp;feet.

Eventually, the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Origins]]'' episode known as ''Charizard'' confirmed that the flame at the tip of Charizard's tail keeps burning in water, and Charizard is able to swim.\n\nWidely popular augmented reality mobile game, ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]'', describes Charizard as a flame Pok\u00e9mon.

Its plantigrade feet have the bottom mostly covered by a single pad that is cream-colored like its belly, while its eyes are light blue in color. When Charizard is Mega Evolved, it can take on one of two forms. Both forms are characterized by white pupils, bigger and sharper teeth, claws and horns and the bright coloring of the belly reaching the whole bottom of the muzzle, that also features a more pronounced beak. In its \"X\" form, its color scheme changes from orange and cream to black and blue, with red eyes, two claws appearing on each shoulder and wings acquiring a multilobed, feather-like structure. The flame at the tip of its tail becomes blue and blue flames are constantly breathed out from the sides of its mouth. In its \"Y\" form, its appearance is influenced by that of [[Pteranodon]]s, with a central big pointed horn, loss of fingers passing through the patagia of the main wings that increase in size, smaller wings stemming from Pteranodon-like hands. It also gains a more slender appearance with a thinner torso, a longer tail and digitigrade feet that are longer and devoid of pads.\n\nThe video games describe Charizard as having wings that can carry them close to an altitude of 4,600&nbsp;feet,<ref name=\"dexfirered\">{{pok\u00e9dex|firered|Its wings can carry this Pok\u00e9mon close to an altitude of 4,600&nbsp;feet.

Eventually, the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Origins]]'' episode known as ''Charizard'' confirmed that the flame at the tip of Charizard's tail keeps burning in water, and Charizard is able to swim.\n\nWidely popular augmented reality mobile game, ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]'', describes Charizard as a flame Pok\u00e9mon.
