{"title_page": "Advanced composite materials (engineering)", "text_new": "{{about| advanced materials and their applications| the scientific journal| Advanced Composite Materials (journal)}}\n'''Advanced composite materials''' (ACMs) are also known as  '''advanced polymer matrix composites'''. These  are generally characterized or determined by unusually high strength fibres with unusually high [[stiffness]], or [[modulus of elasticity]]  characteristics, compared to other materials, while bound together by weaker matrices. These are termed advanced composite materials (ACM) in comparison to the [[composite material]]s commonly in use such as [[reinforced concrete]], or even concrete itself. The [[Composite laminates|high strength fibers]] are also low [[density]] while occupying a large fraction of the [[volume]]\n\nAdvanced composites exhibit desirable [[physical properties|physical]] and [[chemical properties]] that include light weight coupled with high stiffness ([[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]]), and strength along the direction of the reinforcing fiber, dimensional stability, temperature and chemical resistance, [[Flexible response|flex performance]], and relatively easy processing. Advanced composites are replacing metal components in many uses, particularly in the [[aerospace industry]].\n\nComposites are classified according to their [[states of matter|matrix phase]]. These classifications are polymer matrix composites (PMCs), [[Ceramic Matrix Composite|ceramic matrix composite]]s (CMCs), and [[metal matrix composite]]s (MMCs). Also, materials within these categories are often called \"advanced\" if they combine the properties of high (axial, [[longitude|longitudinal]]) strength values and high ([[Geometry|axial]], longitudinal) stiffness values, with low weight, corrosion resistance, and in some cases special [[electrical]] properties.\n\nAdvanced composite materials have broad, proven applications, in the [[aircraft]], aerospace, and [[sports equipment]] sectors. Even more specifically ACMs are very attractive for aircraft and aerospace structural parts. ACMs have been developing for NASA's ''[[Advanced Space Transportation Program]]'', armor protection for ''[[Army aviation]]'' and the ''[[Federal Aviation Administration]]'' of the USA, and high-temperature shafting for the ''[[Comanche helicopter]]''.  Additionally, ACMs have a decades long history in  military and government [[aerospace industry|aerospace industries]]. However, much of the technology is new and not presented formally in secondary or [[undergraduate education]], and the technology of advanced composites manufacture is continually evolving.<ref name=Pilato-Michno>\n{{Cite book\n  | last = Pilato\n  | first =L.\n  |author2=Michno, Michael J.\n  | title =Advanced composite materials| publisher =Springer-Verlag New York| date =January 1994  \n  | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=O379nM3QZwsC&dq=Advanced+Composite+Materials\n  | format =Chap 1 Introduction, and Chapter 2 \"Matrix Resins\"| isbn =978-3-540-57563-4\n}}</ref><ref name=OSHA-ACM/><ref name=ACM-group/>\n:{{OSHA}}\n:{{Include-NASA}}\n\n==Overview and historical perspective==\nManufacturing ACMs is a multibillion-dollar industry worldwide. Composite products range from [[skateboard]]s to components of the [[space shuttle]]. The industry can be generally divided into two basic segments, industrial composites and advanced composites. Several of the composites manufacturing processes are common to both segments. The two basic segments are described below.<ref name=Pilato-Michno/><ref name=OSHA-ACM/>\n\n===Industrial composites===\nThe industrial composites industry has been in place for over 40 years in the U.S. This large industry utilizes various [[resin]] systems including [[polyester]],  [[epoxy]], and other specialty resins. These materials, along with a [[catalyst]] or [[curing agent]] and some type of fiber reinforcement (typically glass fibers) are used in the production of a wide spectrum of industrial components and consumer goods: boats, piping, auto bodies, and a variety of other parts and components.<ref name=Pilato-Michno/><ref name=OSHA-ACM/>\n\n===Advanced composites===\nThe Advanced polymer matrix composites industry, or Advanced composite materials industry,  is characterized by the use of expensive, high-performance resin systems and high-strength, high-stiffness fiber reinforcement. The aerospace industry, including [[military aircraft|military]] and [[commercial aircraft]] of all types, is the major customer for advanced composites. These materials have also been adopted for use by the [[sporting goods]] suppliers who sell [[high-performance equipment]] to the [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[fishing]], and [[archery]] markets;<ref name=Pilato-Michno/><ref name=OSHA-ACM/><ref name=ACM-group/> as well as in the swimming pool industry with Composite wall structures.<ref>http://www.onlyalpha.com</ref>\n\nWhile aerospace is the predominant market for advanced composites today, the industrial and [[automotive market]]s will increasingly see the use of advanced composites toward the year 2000(Its now 2019 this is out of date). At present, both manual and automated processes are employed in making advanced-composite parts. As automated processes become more predominant, the costs of advanced composites are expected to decline to the point at which these materials will be used widely in electronic, machinery, and surface transportation equipment.\n\nSuppliers of advanced composite materials tend to be larger companies capable of doing the [[research and development]] necessary to provide the high-performance resin systems used in this segment of the industry. End-users also tend to be large, and many are in the aircraft and aerospace businesses.<ref name=Pilato-Michno/><ref name=OSHA-ACM/><ref name=ACM-group/>\n\n==Matrix Materials==\nAdvanced composite systems are divided into two basic types based on the chemical characteristics of the matrix, the two most common are thermosets and thermoplastics. Thermosets are by far the predominant type in use today. Thermosets are subdivided into several resin systems including epoxies, phenolics, polyurethanes, and polyimides. Of these, epoxy systems currently dominate the advanced composite industry.<ref name=Pilato-Michno/><ref name=OSHA-ACM/><ref name=ACM-group/>\n\n===Thermosets===\n[[Thermoset]] resins require addition of a [[curing agent]] or hardener and impregnation onto a reinforcing material, followed by a [[curing agent|curing step]] to produce a cured or finished part. Once cured, the part cannot be changed or reformed, except for finishing. Some of the more common thermosets include [[epoxy]], [[polyurethane]]s, phenolic and amino resins, [[bismaleimide]]s (BMI, polyimides), [[polyamide]]s.<ref name=Pilato-Michno/><ref name=OSHA-ACM/><ref name=ACM-group/>\n\nOf these, epoxies are the most commonly used in the industry. Epoxy resins have been in use in U.S. industry for over 40 years. Epoxy compounds are also referred to as glycidyl compounds. The epoxy molecule can also be expanded or cross-linked with other molecules to form a wide variety of resin products, each with distinct performance characteristics. These resins range from low-viscosity liquids to high-molecular weight solids. Typically they are high-viscosity liquids.\n\nThe second of the essential ingredients of an advanced composite system is the curing agent or hardener. These compounds are very important because they control the reaction rate and determine the performance characteristics of the finished part. Since these compounds act as catalysts for the reaction, they must contain active sites on their molecules. Some of the most commonly used curing agents in the advanced composite industry are the aromatic amines. Two of the most common are methylene-dianiline (MDA) and sulfonyldianiline (DDS).{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n[[SiC\u2013SiC matrix composite]]s are a high-temperature ceramic matrix processed from [[preceramic polymer]]s (polymeric SiC precursors) to infiltrate a fibrous preform to create a SiC matrix.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nannetti | first1 = C.

These include aliphatic and cycloaliphatic amines, polyaminoamides, amides, and anhydrides. Again, the choice of curing agent depends on the cure and performance characteristics desired for the finished part. Polyurethanes are another group of resins used in advanced composite processes. These compounds are formed by reacting the [[polyol]] component with an isocyanate compound, typically [[toluene diisocyanate]] (TDI); [[methylene diisocyanate]] (MDI) and [[hexamethylene diisocyanate]] (HDI) are also widely used. Phenolic and amino resins are another group of PMC resins. The bismaleimides and polyamides are relative newcomers to the advanced composite industry and have not been studied to the extent of the other resins.<ref name=Pilato-Michno/><ref name=OSHA-ACM/><ref name=ACM-group/>\n\n===Thermoplastics===\n[[Thermoplastic]]s currently represent a relatively small part of the ACM industry. They are typically supplied as nonreactive solids (no [[chemical reaction]] occurs during processing) and require only [[thermodynamics|heat and pressure]] to form the finished part. Unlike the thermosets, the thermoplastics can usually be reheated and reformed into another shape, if desired.<ref name=Pilato-Michno/><ref name=OSHA-ACM/><ref name=ACM-group/>\n\n==Fiber reinforcements==\nFiber reinforcement materials are added to the resin system increase the tensile strength and stiffness of the finished part. The selection of reinforcement material is based on the properties desired in the finished product. These materials do not react with the resin but are a distinct and integral part of the advanced composite system.\n\nThe three basic types of fiber reinforcement materials in use in the advanced composite industry are\n\n* carbon ([[Carbon (fibre)]], [[graphite]], [[carbon nanotube]]s)\n* [[aramid]]\n* [[glass fiber]]s\n\nFibers used in advanced composite manufacture come in various forms, including tows, yarns, rovings, chopped strands, and woven fabric \nmats. Each of these has its own special application. When prepreg materials are used in parts manufacture, woven fabric or mats are required. In processes such as filament wet winding or pultrusion, yarns and rovings are used.<ref name=OSHA-ACM/><ref name=ACM-group/>\n\n==Prepreg==\nPrepregs are resin-impregnated cloth, mat, or filaments in flat form that can be stored for later use. The resin is often partially cured to a tack-free state called \"B-staging.\" Catalysts, inhibitors, flame retardants, and other additives may be included to obtain specific end-use properties and improve processing, storage, and handling characteristics.<ref name=Pilato-Michno/><ref name=OSHA-ACM>{{cite web\n  | last =OSHA \n  | title =Polymer Matrix Materials: Advanced Composites \n  | publisher =U.S. Department of Labor  \n  | date =May 4, 2009 \n  | url =http://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/otm_iii/otm_iii_1.html#1 \n  | accessdate =2010-06-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100528112048/http://www.osha.gov/dts/osta/otm/otm_iii/otm_iii_1.html| archivedate= 28 May 2010 | url-status= live}}  Public domain content from a U.S. government department.

Composites, on the other hand, are less damage tolerant and undergo much less plastic deformation before failure. An airplane made entirely from aluminium can be repaired almost anywhere.

It resulted in the Conservatives, led by its fourth leader, [[Sir Alec Douglas-Home]], narrowly losing the election to the Labour Party, led by [[Harold Wilson]], with Labour having an [[overall majority]] of four seats. It resulted in Labour ending its thirteen years in opposition and led to Wilson to become, at the time, the youngest Prime Minister in more than 150 years.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n{{UK general election navigation|clear=none|1955|1959|1964|1966|1970}}\n\n== Background ==\nBoth major parties had changed leadership in 1963; after the sudden death of [[Hugh Gaitskell]] early in the year, Labour chose [[Harold Wilson]] (who was then thought of as being on the party's centre-left), while [[Sir Alec Douglas-Home]] (then the [[Earl of Home]]) had taken over as Conservative leader and Prime Minister in the autumn after [[Harold Macmillan]] announced his resignation. Douglas-Home shortly afterwards disclaimed his title under the [[Peerage Act 1963]] in order to lead the party from the Commons.\n\nMacmillan had led the Conservative government since January 1957. Despite initial popularity and a resounding election victory in 1959, he had become increasingly unpopular in the early-1960s, and while it was for a while thought likely that the Conservatives would win the scheduled 1964 general election, albeit with a reduced majority, the emergence of the [[Profumo affair]] in March 1963 and Macmillan's handling of the matter all but destroyed the credibility of his government. While he survived a [[vote of no confidence]] in June 1963, polling indicated that the Conservatives would lose the next election heavily if Macmillan remained in power, which, along with health issues, caused Macmillan to announce his resignation in the autumn of 1963.\n\nDouglas-Home faced a difficult task in rebuilding the party's popularity with just a year elapsing between taking office and having to face a general election. Wilson had begun to try to tie the Labour Party to the growing confidence of Britain in the 1960s, asserting that the \"white heat of revolution\" would sweep away \"restrictive practices&nbsp;... on both sides of industry\". The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] enjoyed a resurgence after a virtual wipeout in the 1950s, and doubled its share of the vote, primarily at the expense of the Conservatives. Although Labour did not increase its vote share significantly, the fall in support for the Conservatives led to Wilson securing an overall majority of four seats.<ref name=SusVic>{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393293.stm |title=1964: Labour scrapes through |date=5 April 2005 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=21 May 2018}}</ref> This proved to be unworkable, and Wilson called a [[snap election]] in [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]].\n\n== Campaign ==\nThe pre-election campaign was prolonged, as Douglas-Home delayed calling a general election to give himself as much time as possible to improve the prospects of his party. The election campaign formally began on 15 September 1964 when Douglas-Home saw the Queen and asked for a dissolution of Parliament. The campaign was dominated by some of the more voluble characters of the political scene at the time. While [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]], deputy leader of the Labour Party, toured the country making energetic speeches (and the occasional [[gaffe]]), [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]] was a leading spokesman for the Conservatives. The image of Hogg lashing out at a Wilson poster with his walking stick was one of the most striking of the campaign. Many party speakers, especially at televised rallies, had to deal with hecklers; in particular Douglas-Home was treated very roughly at a meeting in [[Birmingham]].\n\nThe election night was broadcast live by the BBC, and was presented for the fifth and final time by [[Richard Dimbleby]], with [[Robin Day]], [[Ian Trethowan]], [[Cliff Michelmore]] and [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]].<ref>{{YouTube |id=3ix4IP9-M9g |title=UK General Election 1964 \u2013 Results Round-up}} {{Retrieved|21 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Opinion poll summary ==\n* NOP: Lab swing 3.5% (Lab majority of 12)\n* [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]: Lab swing 4% (Lab majority of 23)\n* Research Services: Lab swing 2.75% (Con majority of 30)\n* ''[[Daily Express]]'': Lab swing of 1.75% (Con majority of 60){{efn|This summary of opinion poll findings from the last few days of the campaign is given early in the BBC's election night coverage.}}\n\n== Results ==\nThe election resulted in a very slim majority of four seats for the Labour Party, forming a government for the first time since 1951. Labour achieved a swing of just over 3%, although its vote rose by only 0.3%. The main shift was the swing from the Conservatives to the Liberals of 5.7%. The Liberals won nearly twice as many votes as in 1959, partly because they had 150 more candidates. [[Harold Wilson|Wilson]] became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], replacing [[Alec Douglas-Home|Douglas-Home]]. The four-seat majority was not sustainable for a full Parliament, and Wilson called another [[1966 United Kingdom general election|general election in 1966]]. In particular the small majority meant the government could not implement its policy of nationalising the steel industry, due to the opposition of two of its backbenchers, [[Woodrow Wyatt]] and [[Desmond Donnelly]].\n\nThis was the only election in Britain's recent history when all seats were won by the three main parties: no minor parties, [[independent politician|independents]] or splinter groups won any seats. It was also the last election in which one party, namely the Conservative Party, contested every single seat. The Conservatives had previously held off on contesting certain Liberal-held seats as per local-level agreements to avoid vote-splitting, but ended that policy at this election. The resultant splitting of votes actually helped grant Labour a majority, by throwing two formerly Liberal-held seats in northern England to Labour; however, the outcome of the election would not have been meaningfully altered had the Liberals retained the seats, as Labour would still have had as many seats as the other two parties combined, and Liberal leader [[Jo Grimond]] was not inclined to prop up a minority Conservative government.\n\n{| style=\"width:70%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ style=\"width:50.0%; text-align:right\" | \u2193{{fsp}}\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}; width:50.3%;\" | '''317'''\n| style=\"background:{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}; width:48.3%;\" | '''304'''\n| style=\"color:black; background:{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}; width:1.4%;\" | '''9'''\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}};\">'''Labour'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}};\">'''Conservative'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:black;\">'''Lib'''</span>\n|}\n\n{{Election Summary Begin with Leaders| title = UK General Election 1964}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Labour Party (UK)\n  |leader = [[Harold Wilson]]\n  |candidates = 628\n  |seats = 317\n  |gain = 65\n  |loss = 6\n  |net = +59\n  |votes = 12,205,808\n  |votes % = 44.1\n  |seats % = 50.3\n  |plus/minus = +0.3\n  |government = yes\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Conservative Party (UK)\n  |leader = [[Alec Douglas-Home]]\n  |candidates = 630\n  |seats = 304\n  |gain = 5\n  |loss = 66\n  |net = &minus;61\n  |votes = 12,002,642\n  |votes % = 43.4\n  |seats % = 48.3\n  |plus/minus = &minus;6.0\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Liberal Party (UK)\n  |leader = [[Jo Grimond]]\n  |candidates = 365\n  |seats = 9\n  |gain = 5\n  |loss = 2\n  |net = +3\n  |votes = 3,099,283\n  |votes % = 11.2\n  |seats % = 1.4\n  |plus/minus = +5.3\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Independent Republican (Ireland)\n  |leader = ''N/A''\n  |candidates = 12\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = 0\n  |net = 0\n  |votes = 101,628\n  |votes % = 0.4\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = ''N/A''\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Plaid Cymru\n  |leader = [[Gwynfor Evans]]\n  |candidates = 23\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = 0\n  |net = 0\n  |votes = 69,507\n  |votes % = 0.3\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = 0.0\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Scottish National Party\n  |leader = [[Arthur Donaldson]]\n  |candidates = 15\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = 0\n  |net = 0\n  |votes = 64,044\n  |votes % = 0.2\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = +0.1\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Communist Party of Great Britain\n  |leader = [[John Gollan]]\n  |candidates = 36\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = 0\n  |net = 0\n  |votes = 46,442\n  |votes % = 0.2\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = +0.1\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Independent (politician)\n  |leader = ''N/A''\n  |candidates = 20\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = 0\n  |net = 0\n  |votes = 18,677\n  |votes % = 0.1\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = ''N/A''\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Independent Liberal\n  |leader = ''N/A''\n  |candidates = 4\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = 0\n  |net = 0\n  |votes = 16,064\n  |votes % = 0.1\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = ''N/A''\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Republican Labour Party\n  |leader = [[Gerry Fitt]]\n  |candidates = [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|1]]\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = 0\n  |net = 0\n  |votes = 14,678\n  |votes % = 0.1\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = ''N/A''\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Independent Conservative\n  |leader = ''N/A''\n  |candidates = 5\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = [[Caithness and Sutherland (UK Parliament constituency)|1]]\n  |net = &minus;1\n  |votes = 6,459\n  |votes % = 0.0\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = ''N/A''\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = British National Party (1960)\n  |leader = [[John Bean]]\n  |candidates = [[Southall (UK Parliament constituency)|1]]\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = 0\n  |net = 0\n  |votes = 3,410\n  |votes % = 0.0\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = ''N/A''\n}}\n{{Election Summary with Leaders|\n  |party = [[Get Britain Out|Anti-Common Market League]]\n  |leader = John Paul & Michael Shay\n  |candidates = 2\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = 0\n  |net = 0\n  |votes = 3,083\n  |votes % = 0.0\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = ''N/A''\n}}\n{{Election Summary with Leaders|\n  |party = [[Independent Nuclear Disarmament Election Committee|Ind.

It resulted in the Conservatives, led by its fourth leader, [[Sir Alec Douglas-Home]], narrowly losing the election to the Labour Party, led by [[Harold Wilson]], with Labour having an [[overall majority]] of four seats. It resulted in Labour ending its thirteen years in opposition and led to Wilson to become, at the time, the youngest Prime Minister in more than 150 years.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n{{UK general election navigation|clear=none|1955|1959|1964|1966|1970}}\n\n== Background ==\nBoth major parties had changed leadership in 1963; after the sudden death of [[Hugh Gaitskell]] early in the year, Labour chose [[Harold Wilson]] (who was then thought of as being on the party's centre-left), while [[Sir Alec Douglas-Home]] (then the [[Earl of Home]]) had taken over as Conservative leader and Prime Minister in the autumn after [[Harold Macmillan]] announced his resignation. Douglas-Home shortly afterwards disclaimed his title under the [[Peerage Act 1963]] in order to lead the party from the Commons.\n\nMacmillan had led the Conservative government since January 1957. Despite initial popularity and a resounding election victory in 1959, he had become increasingly unpopular in the early-1960s, and while it was for a while thought likely that the Conservatives would win the scheduled 1964 general election, albeit with a reduced majority, the emergence of the [[Profumo affair]] in March 1963 and Macmillan's handling of the matter all but destroyed the credibility of his government. While he survived a [[vote of no confidence]] in June 1963, polling indicated that the Conservatives would lose the next election heavily if Macmillan remained in power, which, along with health issues, caused Macmillan to announce his resignation in the autumn of 1963.\n\nDouglas-Home faced a difficult task in rebuilding the party's popularity with just a year elapsing between taking office and having to face a general election. Wilson had begun to try to tie the Labour Party to the growing confidence of Britain in the 1960s, asserting that the \"white heat of revolution\" would sweep away \"restrictive practices&nbsp;... on both sides of industry\". The [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] enjoyed a resurgence after a virtual wipeout in the 1950s, and doubled its share of the vote, primarily at the expense of the Conservatives. Although Labour did not increase its vote share significantly, the fall in support for the Conservatives led to Wilson securing an overall majority of four seats.<ref name=SusVic>{{citation |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393293.stm |title=1964: Labour scrapes through |date=5 April 2005 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=21 May 2018}}</ref> This proved to be unworkable, and Wilson called a [[snap election]] in [[1966 United Kingdom general election|1966]].\n\n== Campaign ==\nThe pre-election campaign was prolonged, as Douglas-Home delayed calling a general election to give himself as much time as possible to improve the prospects of his party. The election campaign formally began on 15 September 1964 when Douglas-Home saw the Queen and asked for a dissolution of Parliament. The campaign was dominated by some of the more voluble characters of the political scene at the time. While [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]], deputy leader of the Labour Party, toured the country making energetic speeches (and the occasional [[gaffe]]), [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]] was a leading spokesman for the Conservatives. The image of Hogg lashing out at a Wilson poster with his walking stick was one of the most striking of the campaign. Many party speakers, especially at televised rallies, had to deal with hecklers; in particular Douglas-Home was treated very roughly at a meeting in [[Birmingham]].\n\nThe election night was broadcast live by the BBC, and was presented for the fifth and final time by [[Richard Dimbleby]], with [[Robin Day]], [[Ian Trethowan]], [[Cliff Michelmore]] and [[David Butler (psephologist)|David Butler]].<ref>{{YouTube |id=3ix4IP9-M9g |title=UK General Election 1964 \u2013 Results Round-up}} {{Retrieved|21 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Opinion poll summary ==\n* NOP: Lab swing 3.5% (Lab majority of 12)\n* [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]]: Lab swing 4% (Lab majority of 23)\n* Research Services: Lab swing 2.75% (Con majority of 30)\n* ''[[Daily Express]]'': Lab swing of 1.75% (Con majority of 60){{efn|This summary of opinion poll findings from the last few days of the campaign is given early in the BBC's election night coverage.}}\n\n== Results ==\nThe election resulted in a very slim majority of four seats for the Labour Party, forming a government for the first time since 1951. Labour achieved a swing of just over 3%, although its vote rose by only 0.3%. The main shift was the swing from the Conservatives to the Liberals of 5.7%. The Liberals won nearly twice as many votes as in 1959, partly because they had 150 more candidates. [[Harold Wilson|Wilson]] became [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], replacing [[Alec Douglas-Home|Douglas-Home]]. The four-seat majority was not sustainable for a full Parliament, and Wilson called another [[1966 United Kingdom general election|general election in 1966]]. In particular the small majority meant the government could not implement its policy of nationalising the steel industry, due to the opposition of two of its backbenchers, [[Woodrow Wyatt]] and [[Desmond Donnelly]].\n\nThis was the only election in Britain's recent history when all seats were won by the three main parties: no minor parties, [[independent politician|independents]] or splinter groups won any seats. It was also the last election in which one party, namely the Conservative Party, contested every single seat. The Conservatives had previously held off on contesting certain Liberal-held seats as per local-level agreements to avoid vote-splitting, but ended that policy at this election. The resultant splitting of votes actually helped grant Labour a majority, by throwing two formerly Liberal-held seats in northern England to Labour; however, the outcome of the election would not have been meaningfully altered had the Liberals retained the seats, as Labour would still have had as many seats as the other two parties combined, and Liberal leader [[Jo Grimond]] was not inclined to prop up a minority Conservative government.\n\n{| style=\"width:70%; text-align:center;\"\n|+ style=\"width:50.0%; text-align:right\" | \u2193{{fsp}}\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n| style=\"background:{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}; width:50.3%;\" | '''317'''\n| style=\"background:{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}}; width:48.3%;\" | '''304'''\n| style=\"color:black; background:{{Liberal Party (UK)/meta/color}}; width:1.4%;\" | '''9'''\n|-\n| <span style=\"color:{{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}};\">'''Labour'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:{{Conservative Party (UK)/meta/color}};\">'''Conservative'''</span>\n| <span style=\"color:black;\">'''Lib'''</span>\n|}\n\n{{Election Summary Begin with Leaders| title = UK General Election 1964}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Labour Party (UK)\n  |leader = [[Harold Wilson]]\n  |candidates = 628\n  |seats = 317\n  |gain = 65\n  |loss = 6\n  |net = +59\n  |votes = 12,205,808\n  |votes % = 44.1\n  |seats % = 50.3\n  |plus/minus = +0.3\n  |government = yes\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Conservative Party (UK)\n  |leader = [[Alec Douglas-Home]]\n  |candidates = 630\n  |seats = 304\n  |gain = 5\n  |loss = 66\n  |net = &minus;61\n  |votes = 12,002,642\n  |votes % = 43.4\n  |seats % = 48.3\n  |plus/minus = &minus;6.0\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Liberal Party (UK)\n  |leader = [[Jo Grimond]]\n  |candidates = 365\n  |seats = 9\n  |gain = 5\n  |loss = 2\n  |net = +3\n  |votes = 3,099,283\n  |votes % = 11.2\n  |seats % = 1.4\n  |plus/minus = +5.3\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Independent Republican (Ireland)\n  |leader = ''N/A''\n  |candidates = 12\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = 0\n  |net = 0\n  |votes = 101,628\n  |votes % = 0.4\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = ''N/A''\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Plaid Cymru\n  |leader = [[Gwynfor Evans]]\n  |candidates = 23\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = 0\n  |net = 0\n  |votes = 69,507\n  |votes % = 0.3\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = 0.0\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Scottish National Party\n  |leader = [[Arthur Donaldson]]\n  |candidates = 15\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = 0\n  |net = 0\n  |votes = 64,044\n  |votes % = 0.2\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = +0.1\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Communist Party of Great Britain\n  |leader = [[John Gollan]]\n  |candidates = 36\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = 0\n  |net = 0\n  |votes = 46,442\n  |votes % = 0.2\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = +0.1\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Independent (politician)\n  |leader = ''N/A''\n  |candidates = 20\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = 0\n  |net = 0\n  |votes = 18,677\n  |votes % = 0.1\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = ''N/A''\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Independent Liberal\n  |leader = ''N/A''\n  |candidates = 4\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = 0\n  |net = 0\n  |votes = 16,064\n  |votes % = 0.1\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = ''N/A''\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Republican Labour Party\n  |leader = [[Gerry Fitt]]\n  |candidates = [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|1]]\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = 0\n  |net = 0\n  |votes = 14,678\n  |votes % = 0.1\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = ''N/A''\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = Independent Conservative\n  |leader = ''N/A''\n  |candidates = 5\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = [[Caithness and Sutherland (UK Parliament constituency)|1]]\n  |net = &minus;1\n  |votes = 6,459\n  |votes % = 0.0\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = ''N/A''\n}}\n{{Election Summary Party with Leaders|\n  |party = British National Party (1960)\n  |leader = [[John Bean]]\n  |candidates = [[Southall (UK Parliament constituency)|1]]\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = 0\n  |net = 0\n  |votes = 3,410\n  |votes % = 0.0\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = ''N/A''\n}}\n{{Election Summary with Leaders|\n  |party = [[Get Britain Out|Anti-Common Market League]]\n  |leader = John Paul & Michael Shay\n  |candidates = 2\n  |seats = 0\n  |gain = 0\n  |loss = 0\n  |net = 0\n  |votes = 3,083\n  |votes % = 0.0\n  |seats % = \n  |plus/minus = ''N/A''\n}}\n{{Election Summary with Leaders|\n  |party = [[Independent Nuclear Disarmament Election Committee|Ind.

It is based on the 1993 [[The Night at the Museum|children's book of the same name]] by [[Croatia]]n illustrator [[Milan Trenc]] and is the first installment in the [[Night at the Museum (film series)|''Night at the Museum'' series]]. The film star [[Ben Stiller]] as Larry Daley, a divorced father who applies for a job as a [[security guard|night watchman]] at New York City's [[American Museum of Natural History]] and subsequently discovers that the exhibits, animated by a magical [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] artifact, come to life at night. [[20th Century Fox]] released the film on December 22, 2006, and it grossed $574 million.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nLarry Daley is a divorced man who has been unable to keep a stable job and has failed at many business ventures, including being an inventor. His former wife Erica ([[Kim Raver]]) believes that he is a bad example to their ten-year-old son Nick, and Larry fears that Nick respects his future [[stepfather]], [[Bond (finance)|bond]] [[trader (finance)|trader]] Don, more than him.\n\nCecil Fredricks, an elderly night [[security guard]] about to retire from the [[American Museum of Natural History]], hires Larry despite his unpromising [[r\u00e9sum\u00e9]]. The museum, which is rapidly losing money, plans to replace Cecil and his two colleagues Gus and Reginald with one guard. Cecil gives Larry an instruction booklet on how to handle museum security, advises Larry to leave some of the lights on, and warns him not to let anything \"in...or out\".\n\nOnce night falls, Larry discovers that the [[exhibits]] come to life, including a playful ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' skeleton nicknamed \"Rexy\" who behaves like a dog; a mischievous [[capuchin monkey]] named Dexter which steals Larry's keys and tears up his instruction booklet; rival [[miniature figure (gaming)|miniature]] civilizations led by [[American frontier|Old West]] cowboy Jedediah and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] general Octavius; abusive, limb-ripping [[Attila|Attila the Hun]]; an [[Easter Island]] [[Moai]] obsessed with [[chewing gum|\"gum-gum\"]] who addresses Larry as Dum-Dum; and a [[Wax sculpture|wax model]] of [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Roosevelt explains that since an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]&mdash;the Golden Tablet of [[Pharaoh]] Ahkmenrah&mdash;came to the museum in 1952, all of the exhibits come to life each night. If the exhibits are outside the museum during [[sunrise]], they turn to dust. Roosevelt helps Larry by restoring order, but only for one night.\n\nLarry quits the next morning, saying to the three guards he doesn't want a job that is life-threatening. However, he sees Nick coming to see him at work the next morning, where Larry offers Nick a tour of the museum. After seeing Nick's interest in his job, Larry decides to remain as a night guard. When Larry tells Cecil about how Dexter tore up his instructions, Cecil advises him to study [[history]] to prepare himself for his nightly duties. He also learns history from a museum [[docent]] Rebecca Hutman, who is writing a [[dissertation]] on [[Sacagawea]], but does not feel she knows enough about her subject.\n\nThe next night, Larry uses what he has learned to better control the exhibits. However, things go wrong anyway and four [[Neanderthal]]s set fire to a display and some other things. One of the Neanderthal turns into dust after escaping from the museum at dawn by jumping out of a window from becoming entranced by a group of homeless people that were standing by a fire; leading to a [[Street sweeper|street sweeper]] truck to clean up his remains. The next morning, museum director Dr. McPhee almost tries to fires Larry after what had happened to the Neanderthal exhibit. He offers Rebecca a meeting with Sacagawea, but she believes that he is mocking her and the museum.\n\nLarry brings Nick to the museum to show him the exhibits, but strangely none of them are coming to life. They find Cecil, Gus, and Reginald stealing the tablet and other valuable objects. Like the exhibits, the guards receive enhanced vitality from the artifact; wishing to retain their youth, health and to fund their retirements, the three plan to [[Frameup|frame]] Larry for the thefts. They have also disabled the tablet to stop the exhibits from interfering. With his father's encouragement, Nick reactivates the tablet-(which awakens all the exhibits), and runs away with the artifact in tow. After a chase ensues throughout the museum, Cecil locks up Nick and his father in the Egyptian room and steals back the tablet. Larry releases Ahkmenrah's [[Mummy (monster)|mummy]] from his [[sarcophagus]]. The pharaoh speaks English from many years as an exhibit at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and helps Larry and Nick escape. The three find the other exhibits fighting; Larry confronts Attila, realizing his behavior came from being hurt a long time ago when he was very young, resulting in Larry comforting a sobbing Attila while singing a [[lullaby]] to him and convinces them to work together.\n\nThe exhibits capture Gus and Reginald without difficulty, but Cecil escapes by [[stagecoach]] with Larry, Nick, Ahkmenrah, Jed, Octavius, Rexy, and Atilla the Hun in pursuit in [[Central Park]], where they stop him and regain the tablet. Jed and Octavius are presumably killed when their remote-controlled [[Hummer]] crashes, but they somehow survive. Rebecca sees the exhibits return to the museum before sunrise and realizes that Larry was telling the truth; he introduces her to Sacagawea. Dr. McPhee fires Larry again after seeing news reports of the strange events around the museum &ndash; such as [[cave painting]]s in the museum's [[81st Street \u2013 Museum of Natural History (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|subway station]], dinosaur [[trace fossil|footprints]] in [[Central Park]], and cavemen sightings. However, upon seeing how much these events raised attendance, he thinks better of it and gives Larry his job back. Larry, Nick, and the exhibits celebrate the following night and throw a huge party for everyone. \n\nDuring the credits, it was shown that Cecil, Gus and Reginald weren't handed over to the authorities and are now working as [[janitor]]s at the museum, cleaning up after the party.\n\n==Cast==\n===Humans===\n* [[Mickey Rooney]] as Gus Daley, a night-shift security guard at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York.\n* [[Dick Van Dyke]] as Cecil Fredericks, a veteran security guard\n* [[Carla Gugino]] as Rebecca Hutman, a museum docent\n* [[Mickey Rooney]] as Larry, a veteran security guard, who takes instant dislike to Gus Daley.\n* [[Bill Cobbs]] as Reginald, a veteran security guard\n* [[Jake Cherry]] as Nicholas \"Nick\" Daley, Gus\u2019s son\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Dr. McPhee, the curator of the Museum of Natural History and Larry's boss\n* [[Kim Raver]] as Erica Daley, Gus\u2019s former wife and Nick's mother\n* [[Charlie Murphy]] as the taxi-driver\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Don, Erica's fianc\u00e9\n* [[Anne Meara]] as Debbie\n\n===Exhibits===\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as \"Jedediah\", a miniature [[cowboy]] figure (Uncredited and only Credited in the rest of the film series)\n* [[Robin Williams]] as a [[wax sculpture|wax model]] of [[Theodore Roosevelt]]\n* [[Patrick Gallagher (actor)|Patrick Gallagher]] as a wax model of [[Attila|Attila the Hun]]\n* [[Rami Malek]] as the mummy of Pharaoh Ahkmenrah\n* [[Pierfrancesco Favino]] as a [[bronze statue]] of [[Christopher Columbus]]\n* [[Steve Coogan]] as Octavius, a miniature [[Roman army|Roman]] general figure\n* [[Mizuo Peck]] as a polyurethane model of [[Sacagawea]]\n* Kerry van der Griend, Dan Rizzuto, Matthew Harrison, and Jody Racicot as wax models of [[Neanderthal]]s\n* Martin Christopher as a wax model of [[Meriwether Lewis]]\n* Martin Sims as a wax model of [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]]\n* Randy Lee, Darryl Quon, Gerald Wong, and Paul Chih-Ping Cheng as wax models of the [[Huns]]\n* [[Brad Garrett]] as the voice of the [[Moai|Easter Island Head]]\n* [[Crystal the Monkey]] as Dexter, a [[taxidermy|stuffed]] [[Capuchin monkey]]\n\n==Production==\nThe building featured in the film, which was constructed on a sound stage in [[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]], is based on the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City, external shots of which were used in the movie.<ref name=\"MLG\">{{cite web | title=MovieLocationsGuide.com | work=Night at the Museum Filming Locations | url=http://www.movielocationsguide.com/Night_at_the_Museum/filming_locations | accessdate=January 8, 2007}}</ref>\n\nTrainers spent several weeks training Crystal, who plays the troublemaking monkey Dexter, to slap and bite Stiller in the film.\n\nDirector [[Shawn Levy]] credited Ben Stiller for the ensemble cast: \"When actors hear that Ben Stiller is in a movie they want to work with him.

Garant]] and [[Thomas Lennon]]. It is based on the 1993 [[The Night at the Museum|children's book of the same name]] by [[Croatia]]n illustrator [[Milan Trenc]] and is the first installment in the [[Night at the Museum (film series)|''Night at the Museum'' series]]. The film star [[Ben Stiller]] as Larry Daley, a divorced father who applies for a job as a [[security guard|night watchman]] at New York City's [[American Museum of Natural History]] and subsequently discovers that the exhibits, animated by a magical [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] artifact, come to life at night. [[20th Century Fox]] released the film on December 22, 2006, and it grossed $574 million.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Plot==\nLarry Daley is a divorced man who has been unable to keep a stable job and has failed at many business ventures, including being an inventor. His former wife Erica ([[Kim Raver]]) believes that he is a bad example to their ten-year-old son Nick, and Larry fears that Nick respects his future [[stepfather]], [[Bond (finance)|bond]] [[trader (finance)|trader]] Don, more than him.\n\nCecil Fredricks, an elderly night [[security guard]] about to retire from the [[American Museum of Natural History]], hires Larry despite his unpromising [[r\u00e9sum\u00e9]]. The museum, which is rapidly losing money, plans to replace Cecil and his two colleagues Gus and Reginald with one guard. Cecil gives Larry an instruction booklet on how to handle museum security, advises Larry to leave some of the lights on, and warns him not to let anything \"in...or out\".\n\nOnce night falls, Larry discovers that the [[exhibits]] come to life, including a playful ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' skeleton nicknamed \"Rexy\" who behaves like a dog; a mischievous [[capuchin monkey]] named Dexter which steals Larry's keys and tears up his instruction booklet; rival [[miniature figure (gaming)|miniature]] civilizations led by [[American frontier|Old West]] cowboy Jedediah and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] general Octavius; abusive, limb-ripping [[Attila|Attila the Hun]]; an [[Easter Island]] [[Moai]] obsessed with [[chewing gum|\"gum-gum\"]] who addresses Larry as Dum-Dum; and a [[Wax sculpture|wax model]] of [[Theodore Roosevelt]]. Roosevelt explains that since an [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]&mdash;the Golden Tablet of [[Pharaoh]] Ahkmenrah&mdash;came to the museum in 1952, all of the exhibits come to life each night. If the exhibits are outside the museum during [[sunrise]], they turn to dust. Roosevelt helps Larry by restoring order, but only for one night.\n\nLarry quits the next morning, saying to the three guards he doesn't want a job that is life-threatening. However, he sees Nick coming to see him at work the next morning, where Larry offers Nick a tour of the museum. After seeing Nick's interest in his job, Larry decides to remain as a night guard. When Larry tells Cecil about how Dexter tore up his instructions, Cecil advises him to study [[history]] to prepare himself for his nightly duties. He also learns history from a museum [[docent]] Rebecca Hutman, who is writing a [[dissertation]] on [[Sacagawea]], but does not feel she knows enough about her subject.\n\nThe next night, Larry uses what he has learned to better control the exhibits. However, things go wrong anyway and four [[Neanderthal]]s set fire to a display and some other things. One of the Neanderthal turns into dust after escaping from the museum at dawn by jumping out of a window from becoming entranced by a group of homeless people that were standing by a fire; leading to a [[Street sweeper|street sweeper]] truck to clean up his remains. The next morning, museum director Dr. McPhee almost tries to fires Larry after what had happened to the Neanderthal exhibit. He offers Rebecca a meeting with Sacagawea, but she believes that he is mocking her and the museum.\n\nLarry brings Nick to the museum to show him the exhibits, but strangely none of them are coming to life. They find Cecil, Gus, and Reginald stealing the tablet and other valuable objects. Like the exhibits, the guards receive enhanced vitality from the artifact; wishing to retain their youth, health and to fund their retirements, the three plan to [[Frameup|frame]] Larry for the thefts. They have also disabled the tablet to stop the exhibits from interfering. With his father's encouragement, Nick reactivates the tablet-(which awakens all the exhibits), and runs away with the artifact in tow. After a chase ensues throughout the museum, Cecil locks up Nick and his father in the Egyptian room and steals back the tablet. Larry releases Ahkmenrah's [[Mummy (monster)|mummy]] from his [[sarcophagus]]. The pharaoh speaks English from many years as an exhibit at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], and helps Larry and Nick escape. The three find the other exhibits fighting; Larry confronts Attila, realizing his behavior came from being hurt a long time ago when he was very young, resulting in Larry comforting a sobbing Attila while singing a [[lullaby]] to him and convinces them to work together.\n\nThe exhibits capture Gus and Reginald without difficulty, but Cecil escapes by [[stagecoach]] with Larry, Nick, Ahkmenrah, Jed, Octavius, Rexy, and Atilla the Hun in pursuit in [[Central Park]], where they stop him and regain the tablet. Jed and Octavius are presumably killed when their remote-controlled [[Hummer]] crashes, but they somehow survive. Rebecca sees the exhibits return to the museum before sunrise and realizes that Larry was telling the truth; he introduces her to Sacagawea. Dr. McPhee fires Larry again after seeing news reports of the strange events around the museum &ndash; such as [[cave painting]]s in the museum's [[81st Street \u2013 Museum of Natural History (IND Eighth Avenue Line)|subway station]], dinosaur [[trace fossil|footprints]] in [[Central Park]], and cavemen sightings. However, upon seeing how much these events raised attendance, he thinks better of it and gives Larry his job back. Larry, Nick, and the exhibits celebrate the following night and throw a huge party for everyone. \n\nDuring the credits, it was shown that Cecil, Gus and Reginald weren't handed over to the authorities and are now working as [[janitor]]s at the museum, cleaning up after the party.\n\n==Cast==\n===Humans===\n* [[Ben Stiller]] as Lawrence \"Larry\" Daley, a night-shift security guard at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York.\n* [[Dick Van Dyke]] as Cecil Fredericks, a veteran security guard\n* [[Carla Gugino]] as Rebecca Hutman, a museum docent\n* [[Mickey Rooney]] as Gus, a veteran security guard, who takes instant dislike to Larry Daley.\n* [[Bill Cobbs]] as Reginald, a veteran security guard\n* [[Jake Cherry]] as Nicholas \"Nick\" Daley, Larry's son\n* [[Ricky Gervais]] as Dr. McPhee, the curator of the Museum of Natural History and Larry's boss\n* [[Kim Raver]] as Erica Daley, Larry's former wife and Nick's mother\n* [[Charlie Murphy]] as the taxi-driver\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as Don, Erica's fianc\u00e9\n* [[Anne Meara]] as Debbie\n\n===Exhibits===\n* [[Owen Wilson]] as \"Jedediah\", a miniature [[cowboy]] figure (Uncredited and only Credited in the rest of the film series)\n* [[Robin Williams]] as a [[wax sculpture|wax model]] of [[Theodore Roosevelt]]\n* [[Patrick Gallagher (actor)|Patrick Gallagher]] as a wax model of [[Attila|Attila the Hun]]\n* [[Rami Malek]] as the mummy of Pharaoh Ahkmenrah\n* [[Pierfrancesco Favino]] as a [[bronze statue]] of [[Christopher Columbus]]\n* [[Steve Coogan]] as Octavius, a miniature [[Roman army|Roman]] general figure\n* [[Mizuo Peck]] as a polyurethane model of [[Sacagawea]]\n* Kerry van der Griend, Dan Rizzuto, Matthew Harrison, and Jody Racicot as wax models of [[Neanderthal]]s\n* Martin Christopher as a wax model of [[Meriwether Lewis]]\n* Martin Sims as a wax model of [[William Clark (explorer)|William Clark]]\n* Randy Lee, Darryl Quon, Gerald Wong, and Paul Chih-Ping Cheng as wax models of the [[Huns]]\n* [[Brad Garrett]] as the voice of the [[Moai|Easter Island Head]]\n* [[Crystal the Monkey]] as Dexter, a [[taxidermy|stuffed]] [[Capuchin monkey]]\n\n==Production==\nThe building featured in the film, which was constructed on a sound stage in [[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]], is based on the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City, external shots of which were used in the movie.<ref name=\"MLG\">{{cite web | title=MovieLocationsGuide.com | work=Night at the Museum Filming Locations | url=http://www.movielocationsguide.com/Night_at_the_Museum/filming_locations | accessdate=January 8, 2007}}</ref>\n\nTrainers spent several weeks training Crystal, who plays the troublemaking monkey Dexter, to slap and bite Stiller in the film.\n\nDirector [[Shawn Levy]] credited Ben Stiller for the ensemble cast: \"When actors hear that Ben Stiller is in a movie they want to work with him.

The conflicts involved numerous nominally independent rulers and their vassals, struggles for succession and territory, and included a diplomatic and military struggle between the [[French East India Company]] and the [[British East India Company]]. They were mainly fought within the territories of [[Mughal India]] with the assistance of various fragmented polities loyal to the \"Great Moghul\". As a result of these military contests, the British East India Company established its dominance among the European trading companies within India. The French company was pushed to a corner and was confined primarily to [[Pondicherry district|Pondich\u00e9ry]]. The East India Company's dominance eventually led to control by the British Company over most of India and eventually to the establishment of the [[British Raj]].\n\nIn the 18th century, the coastal [[Carnatic region]] was a dependency of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]]. Three Carnatic Wars were fought between 1746 and 1763.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:CarnaticRegion.jpg|thumb|left|Showing the Carnatic Region of what is now [[India]].]]\nThe [[Mughal tribe|Mughal]] Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] died in 1707. He was succeeded by [[Bahadur Shah I]], but there was a general decline in central control over the empire during the tenure of [[Jahandar Shah]] and later emperors. [[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asif Jah I|Nizam-ul-Mulk]] established Hyderabad as an independent kingdom. A power struggle ensued after his death between his son, [[Nasir Jang Mir Ahmad|Nasir Jung]], and his grandson, [[Muhyi ad-Din Muzaffar Jang Hidayat|Muzaffar Jung]], which was the opportunity France and England needed to interfere in Indian politics. France aided Muzaffar Jung while England aided Nasir Jung. Several erstwhile Mughal territories were autonomous such as the Carnatic, ruled by [[Nawab]] [[Dost Ali Khan]], despite being under the legal purview of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. French and English interference included those of the affairs of the Nawab. Dost Ali's death sparked a power struggle between his son-in-law [[Chanda Sahib]], supported by the French, and [[Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah|Muhammad Ali]], supported by the English.<ref name=Naravane>{{Cite book |last=Naravane |first=M.S. |title=Battles of the Honorourable East India Company |publisher=A.P.H. Publishing Corporation |year=2014 |isbn=9788131300343 |pages=150\u2013159}}</ref>\n\nOne major instigator of the Carnatic Wars was the Frenchman [[Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Dupleix]], who arrived in India in 1715, rising to become the French East India Company's governor in 1742. Dupleix sought to expand French influence in India, which was limited to a few trading outposts, the chief one being [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]]. Immediately upon his arrival in India, he organized Indian recruits under French officers for the first time, and engaged in intrigues with local rulers to expand French influence. However, he was met by the equally challenging and determined young officer from the British Army, [[Robert Clive]].\n\n\"The Austrian War of Succession in 1740 and later the war in 1756 automatically led to a conflict in India...and British reverses during the American War of Independence (1775-1783) in the 1770s had an impact on events in India.\"<ref name=Naravane/>\n\n==First Carnatic War (1746\u20131748)==\n{{main|First Carnatic War}}\n[[File:Dupleix meeting the Soudhabar of the Deccan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Dupleix|Dupleix]] meeting the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Subedar]] of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], [[Muzaffar Jung]].]]\n\nIn 1740 the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] broke out in Europe. Great Britain was drawn into the war in 1744, opposed to France and its allies. The trading companies of both countries maintained cordial relations in India while their parent countries were bitter enemies on the European continent. Dodwell writes, \"Such were the friendly relations between the English and the French that the French sent their goods and merchandise from [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] to [[Chennai|Madras]] for safe custody.\"<ref>Dodwell, H. H. (ed), Cambridge History of India, Vol. v.</ref> Although French company officials were ordered to avoid conflict, British officials were not, and were furthermore notified that a [[Royal Navy]] fleet was en route. After the British initially captured a few French merchant ships, the French called for backup from as far afield as [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]] (now [[Mauritius]]), beginning an escalation in naval forces in the area. In July 1746 French commander [[Bertrand-Fran\u00e7ois Mah\u00e9 de La Bourdonnais|La Bourdonnais]] and British Admiral [[Edward Peyton]] fought [[Action of 6 July 1746|an indecisive action]] off Negapatam, after which the British fleet withdrew to Bengal. On 21 September 1746, the French [[Battle of Madras|captured the British outpost at Madras]]. La Bourdonnais had promised to return Madras to the English, but [[Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Dupleix|Dupleix]] withdrew that promise, and one to give Madras to Anwar-ud-din after the capture. The Nawab then sent a 10,000-man army to take Madras from the French but was decisively repulsed by a small French force in the [[Battle of Adyar]]. The French then made several attempts to capture the British [[Fort St. David]] at [[Cuddalore]], but the timely arrivals of reinforcements halted these and eventually turned the tables on the French. British Admiral [[Edward Boscawen]] [[Siege of Pondicherry (1748)|besieged Pondicherry]] in the later months of 1748, but lifted the siege with the advent of the [[monsoon]] rains in October.<ref name=Naravane/>\n\nWith the termination of the War of Austrian Succession in Europe, the First Carnatic War also came to an end. In the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]], Madras was given back to the British in exchange for the French fortress of [[Fortress of Louisbourg|Louisbourg]] in [[North America]], which the British [[Siege of Louisbourg (1745)|had captured]]. The war was principally notable in India as the first military experience of [[Robert Clive]], who was taken prisoner at Madras but managed to escape, and who then participated in the defence of Cuddalore and the siege of Pondicherry.\n\n==Second Carnatic War (1749\u20131754)==\n[[File:WAR ELEPHANTS CHARGE THE GATES OF THE FORT AT ARCOT..gif|thumb|upright|The [[Siege of Arcot]] (1751) was a major battle fought between [[Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive|Robert Clive]] and the combined forces of the [[Mughal Empire]]'s [[Nawab of the Carnatic]], [[Chanda Sahib]], assisted by a small number of troops from the [[French East India Company]].]]\n\nThough a state of war did not exist in Europe, the [[proxy war]] continued in India. On one side was Nasir Jung, the Nizam and his protege Muhammad Ali, supported by the English, and on the other was Chanda Sahib and Muzaffar Jung, supported by the French, vying to become the Nawab of Arcot. Muzaffar Jung and Chanda Sahib were able to capture Arcot while Nasir Jung's subsequent death allowed Muzaffar Jung to take control of Hyderabad. Muzaffar's reign was short as he was soon killed, and [[Salabat Jung]] became Nizam. In 1751, however, [[Robert Clive]] led British troops to capture [[Arcot, Vellore|Arcot]], and successfully [[Siege of Arcot|defend]] it. The war ended with the [[Treaty of Pondicherry]], signed in 1754, which recognised Muhammad Ali Khan Walajah as the [[Nawab of the Carnatic]]. [[Charles Godeheu]] replaced [[Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Dupleix|Dupleix]], who died in poverty back in France.<ref name=Naravane/>\n\n==Third Carnatic War (1756\u20131763)==\nThe outbreak of the [[Seven Years' War]] in Europe in 1756 resulted in renewed conflict between French and British forces in India. The '''Third Carnatic War''' spread beyond southern India and into [[Bengal]] where British forces captured the French settlement of Chandernagore (now [[Chandannagar]]) in 1757. However, the war was decided in the south, where the British successfully defended [[Siege of Madras|Madras]], and [[Sir Eyre Coote, KB|Sir Eyre Coote]] decisively defeated the French, commanded by [[Thomas Arthur, comte de Lally|Comte de Lally]] at the [[Battle of Wandiwash]] in 1760. After Wandiwash, the French capital of [[Pondicherry]] fell to the British in [[Siege of Pondicherry (1760)|1761]].<ref name=Naravane/>\n\nThe war concluded with the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, which returned Chandernagore and [[Pondicherry district|Pondich\u00e9ry]] to France, and allowed the French to have \"factories\" ([[trading post]]s) in India but forbade French traders from administering them. The French agreed to support British client governments, thus ending French ambitions of an Indian empire and making the British the dominant foreign power in India.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:India; (1909) (14566747909).jpg|[[Robert Clive]] fires a cannon in the [[Siege of Arcot]].\nFile:Repr\u00e9sentations des positions des escadres des navires fran\u00e7ais et anglais devant Pondich\u00e9ry (sud\u2013est de l\u2019Inde) - Archives Nationales - MAR-B-4-77 fol 277 - (1).jpg|French and English boats position near [[Pondicherry]].

War}}\n{{Campaignbox Seven Years' War: East Indies}}\n{{Campaignbox Seven Years' War}}\n}}\nThe '''Carnatic Wars''' (also spelled '''Karnatic Wars''') were a series of military conflicts in the middle of the 18th century in  [[India]]. The conflicts involved numerous nominally independent rulers and their vassals, struggles for succession and territory, and included a diplomatic and military struggle between the [[French East India Company]] and the [[British East India Company]]. They were mainly fought within the territories of [[Mughal India]] with the assistance of various fragmented polities loyal to the \"Great Moghul\". As a result of these military contests, the British East India Company established its dominance among the European trading companies within India. The French company was pushed to a corner and was confined primarily to [[Pondicherry district|Pondich\u00e9ry]]. The East India Company's dominance eventually led to control by the British Company over most of India and eventually to the establishment of the [[British Raj]].\n\nIn the 18th century, the coastal [[Carnatic region]] was a dependency of [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]]. Three Carnatic Wars were fought between 1746 and 1763.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:CarnaticRegion.jpg|thumb|left|Showing the Carnatic Region of what is now [[India]].]]\nThe [[Mughal tribe|Mughal]] Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] died in 1707. He was succeeded by [[Bahadur Shah I]], but there was a general decline in central control over the empire during the tenure of [[Jahandar Shah]] and later emperors. [[Qamar-ud-din Khan, Asif Jah I|Nizam-ul-Mulk]] established Hyderabad as an independent kingdom. A power struggle ensued after his death between his son, [[Nasir Jang Mir Ahmad|Nasir Jung]], and his grandson, [[Muhyi ad-Din Muzaffar Jang Hidayat|Muzaffar Jung]], which was the opportunity France and England needed to interfere in Indian politics. France aided Muzaffar Jung while England aided Nasir Jung. Several erstwhile Mughal territories were autonomous such as the Carnatic, ruled by [[Nawab]] [[Dost Ali Khan]], despite being under the legal purview of the [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. French and English interference included those of the affairs of the Nawab. Dost Ali's death sparked a power struggle between his son-in-law [[Chanda Sahib]], supported by the French, and [[Muhammad Ali Khan Wallajah|Muhammad Ali]], supported by the English.<ref name=Naravane>{{Cite book |last=Naravane |first=M.S. |title=Battles of the Honorourable East India Company |publisher=A.P.H. Publishing Corporation |year=2014 |isbn=9788131300343 |pages=150\u2013159}}</ref>\n\nOne major instigator of the Carnatic Wars was the Frenchman [[Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Dupleix]], who arrived in India in 1715, rising to become the French East India Company's governor in 1742. Dupleix sought to expand French influence in India, which was limited to a few trading outposts, the chief one being [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]] on the [[Coromandel Coast]]. Immediately upon his arrival in India, he organized Indian recruits under French officers for the first time, and engaged in intrigues with local rulers to expand French influence. However, he was met by the equally challenging and determined young officer from the British Army, [[Robert Clive]].\n\n\"The Austrian War of Succession in 1740 and later the war in 1756 automatically led to a conflict in India...and British reverses during the American War of Independence (1775-1783) in the 1770s had an impact on events in India.\"<ref name=Naravane/>\n\n==First Carnatic War (1746\u20131748)==\n{{main|First Carnatic War}}\n[[File:Dupleix meeting the Soudhabar of the Deccan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Joseph Fran\u00e7ois Dupleix|Dupleix]] meeting the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] [[Subedar]] of the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]], [[Muzaffar Jung]].]]\n\nIn 1740 the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] broke out in Europe.

The absence of regulation of the manufacture and use of cosmetics has led to negative [[adverse effect|side effects]], [[deformities]], blindness, and even death through the ages. Examples are the prevalent use of [[ceruse]] (white lead), to cover the face during the [[Renaissance]], and blindness caused by the [[mascara]] Lash Lure during the early 20th century.\n\n[[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian men]] and women used makeup to enhance their appearance. They were very fond of eyeliner and eye-shadows in dark colors including blue, red, and black. Ancient [[Sumer]]ian men and women were possibly the first to invent and wear lipstick, about 5,000 years ago.<ref>{{citation |title=Reading Our Lips: The History of Lipstick Regulation in Western Seats of Power |year=2006 |author=Schaffer, Sarah |publisher=Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard |accessdate=2014-06-05 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/10018966}}</ref> They crushed [[gemstone]]s and used them to decorate their faces, mainly on the lips and around the eyes.<ref name=\"lipstick3\">{{cite news |url= http://inventorspot.com/articles/the_slightly_gross_origins_lipstick_13653|title=The History of Lipstick And It's Slightly Gross Origins| publisher=InventorSpot|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref> Also around 3000 BC to 1500 BC, women in the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] applied red tinted lipstick to their lips for face decoration.<ref>Williams, Yona .

Cosmetics are mentioned in the [[Old Testament]], such as in 2 Kings 9:30, where [[Jezebel]] painted her eyelids\u2014approximately 840 BC\u2014and in the book of [[Esther]], where beauty treatments are described.\n\nOne of the most popular [[traditional Chinese medicine]]s is the fungus ''[[Tremella fuciformis]]'', used as a beauty product by women in China and Japan. The fungus reportedly increases moisture retention in the skin and prevents senile degradation of micro-blood vessels in the skin, reducing wrinkles and smoothing fine lines.  Other anti-aging effects come from increasing the presence of [[superoxide dismutase]] in the brain and liver; it is an [[enzyme]] that acts as a potent [[antioxidant]] throughout the body, particularly in the skin. Tremella fuciformis is also known in Chinese medicine for nourishing the lungs.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Reshetnikov SV, Wasser SP, Duckman I, Tsukor K |title=Medicinal value of the genus ''Tremella'' Pers.

For example, in the 19th century, [[Queen Victoria]] publicly declared makeup improper, vulgar, and acceptable only for use by actors.<ref>{{cite book | title = Lipstick: A Celebration of the World's Favorite Cosmetic | first = J | last = Pallingston | isbn = 978-0-312-19914-2 | publisher = St. Martin's Press | year = 1998}}</ref>\n\nMany women in the 19th century liked to be thought of as fragile ladies. They compared themselves to delicate flowers and emphasized their delicacy and femininity. They always aimed to look pale and interesting. Sometimes ladies discreetly used a little rouge on the cheeks and used \"[[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]]\" to dilate their eyes so it would make them stand out more. Makeup was frowned upon in general, especially during the 1870s when social etiquette became more rigid. Teachers and clergywomen specifically were forbidden from the use of cosmetic products.\n\nDuring the 19th century, there was a high number of incidences of lead-poisoning because of the fashion for red and white lead makeup and powder. This led to swelling and inflammation of the eyes, weakened tooth enamel, and caused the skin to blacken. Heavy use was known to lead to death. However, in the second part of the 19th century, great advances were made in chemistry from the chemical fragrances that enabled a much easier production of cosmetic products.\n\nIt was socially acceptable for actresses in the 1800s to use makeup, and famous beauties such as [[Sarah Bernhardt]] and [[Lillie Langtry]] could be powdered. Most cosmetic products available were still either chemically dubious or found in the kitchen amid food coloring, berries and [[beetroot]].\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, cosmetics were in widespread use by women in nearly all [[industrial society|industrial societies]] around the world. The cosmetic industry became a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the beginning of the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/sports-and-everyday-life/fashion-and-clothing/clothing-jewelry-and-personal-adornment/cosmetics|title=Cosmetics}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 at the feminist [[Miss America protest]], protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \"Freedom Trash Can\".

The market was developed in the US during the 1910s by [[Elizabeth Arden]], [[Helena Rubinstein]], and [[Max Factor]]. These firms were joined by [[Revlon]] just before [[World War II]] and [[Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies|Est\u00e9e Lauder]] just after.\n\nAlthough modern makeup has been traditionally used mainly by women, an increasing number of men are using cosmetics usually associated to women to enhance or cover their own facial features such as blemishes, dark circles, and so on.

They include, but are not limited to, products that can be applied to the face: [[Human skin|skin]]-care [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]], [[lipstick]]s, [[Human eye|eye]] and facial makeup, [[Wet wipe|towelettes]], and [[colored contact lenses]]; to the body: [[deodorant]]s, [[lotion]]s, [[Powder (substance)|powders]], [[perfume]]s, baby products, bath oils, [[bubble bath]]s, [[bath salts]], and body [[butter]]s; to the hands/nails: fingernail and toe [[nail polish]], and [[hand sanitizer]]; to the hair: permanent chemicals, [[hair]] [[hair coloring|colors]], [[hair spray]]s, and [[gel]]s.\n\nA subset of cosmetics is called \"makeup\", refers primarily to products containing color pigments that are intended to alter the user's appearance. Manufacturers may distinguish between \"decorative\" and \"care\" cosmetics.\n\nCosmetics that are meant to be used on the face and eye area are usually applied with a brush, a makeup sponge, or the fingertips.\n\nMost cosmetics are distinguished by the area of the body intended for application.\n* [[Lipstick]], [[lip gloss]], [[lip liner]], [[Lip augmentation|lip plumper]], [[lip balm]], lip stain, lip conditioner, lip primer, lip boosters, and lip butters:<ref name=USHealthandHuman>{{cite web|title=Cosmetics and Your Health \u2013 FAQs |url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |publisher=Womenshealth.gov |date=November 2004 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312162359/http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |archivedate=2013-03-12 }}</ref> Lipsticks are intended to add color and texture to the lips and often come in a wide range of colors, as well as finishes such as matte, satin, gloss and lustre. Lip stains have a water or gel base and may contain alcohol to help the product stay on leaving a matte look. They temporarily saturate the lips with a dye. Usually designed to be waterproof, the product may come with an applicator [[makeup brush|brush]], directly through the applicator, rollerball, or could be applied with a finger. Lip glosses are intended to add shine to the lips and may add a tint of color, as well as being scented or flavored. Lip balms are most often used to moisturize, tint, and protect the lips. Some brands contain [[sunscreen]]. Using a priming lip product such as lip balm or chapstick can prevent chapped lips.\n* [[Primer (cosmetics)|Primer]] is used to set the face before makeup is applied. This creates another layer between the skin to prevent acne and makeup clogging up pores. Primer creates an even tone throughout the skin and makes makeup last longer. Primer is applied throughout the face including eyes, lips, and lashes. This product has a creamy texture and applies smoothly.\n* [[Concealer]] covers imperfections of the skin. Concealer is often used for any extra coverage needed to cover acne/pimple blemishes, undereye circles, and other imperfections. Concealer is often thicker and more solid than foundation, and provides longer lasting, more detailed coverage as well as creating a fresh clean base for all the rest of the makeup. This product also brightens up the skin and applying under the foundation can remove blemishes and discoloration because of acne scars. Some formulations are intended only for the eye or only for the face. This product can also be used for contouring the face like ones nose, cheekbones, and jaw line to add a more defined look to the total face. In that case, adding a setting powder will add a matte finish.\n* [[Foundation (cosmetics)|Foundation]] is used to smooth out the [[face]] by covering spots, [[acne]], blemishes, or uneven skin tone. These are sold in a liquid, cream, or powder, or more recently in a mousse. Foundation provides sheer, matte, dewy or full coverage.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Foundation primer is applied before foundation to fill out pores, create a dewy look or create a smoother finish. They usually come in cream formulas to be applied before foundation as a base.\n* [[Face powder]] sets the foundation and under eye concealer, giving it a [[wikt:Special:Search/matte|matte]] finish while also concealing small flaws or blemishes. It can also be used to [[Baking (make-up)|bake]] the foundation, so that it stays on longer and create a matte finish. Tinted face powders may be worn alone as a light foundation so that the full face does not look as caked-up as it could.\n* [[Rouge (cosmetics)|Rouge, blush, or blusher]] is cheek coloring to bring out the color in the [[cheek]]s and make the [[Zygomatic bone|cheekbones]] appear more defined. Rouge comes in powder, cream, and liquid forms. Different blush colors are used to complement different skin tones.<ref name=USHealthandHuman />\n* [[Highlighter (cosmetics)|Highlight]], used to draw attention to the high points of the face such as the cheekbones, below the eyebrows, nose, upper lip, and collar bones. This product also adds a glow; comes in liquid, cream, and powder forms. It often contains a substance to provide shimmer. Alternatively, a lighter-toned foundation/concealer can be used.\n* [[Bronzer]] gives skin a bit of color and contours the face for a sharper definition or creates a tan-look. Bronzer is considered to be more of a natural look and can be used for everyday wear. Bronzer enhances the color of the face.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> It comes in either matte, semi-matte/satin, or shimmer finishes.\n* [[Mascara]] is used to darken, lengthen, thicken, or draw attention to the [[eyelash]]es. It is available in various colors. Some mascaras include [[glitter]] flecks. There are many formulas, including [[Waterproofing|waterproof]] versions for those prone to [[allergies]] or sudden tears. It is often used after an [[eyelash curler]] and mascara primer.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Many mascaras have components to help lashes appear longer and thicker.\n[[File:Pre-wedding make-up.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eye shadow]] being applied]]\n[[File:Jim Brochu.jpg|thumb|[[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actor [[Jim Brochu]] applies makeup before the opening night of a play.]]\n* [[Eye shadow]] is a pigmented powder/cream or substance used to accentuate the eye area, traditionally on, above, and under the eyelids.  Many colours may be used at once and blended together to create different effects using a blending brush.  This is conventionally applied with a range of eyeshadow brushes, though it isn't uncommon for alternative methods of application to be used such as fingers. However, it is important to have clean fingers because oils from your skin can result in pimples <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eyeshadow|title=eyeshadow \u2013 definition of eyeshadow in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref>\n* [[Eye liner]] is used to enhance and elongate the apparent size or depth of the [[eye]]. For example, white eyeliner on the waterline and inner corners of the eye makes the eyes look bigger and more awake. It can come in the form of a pencil, a gel, or a liquid and can be found in almost any color. Conversely, black eyeliner makes eyes look smaller, brightens up the face and draws attention to the eyes.\n* [[Eyebrow]] pencils, creams, [[wax]]es, gels, and powders are used to color, fill in, and define the brows.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Popular in recent years, the \"Instagram look\" is creating fuller eyebrows by filling it, sharper angles, and adding gel to set it.\n* [[Nail polish]] is used to color the [[Nail (anatomy)|fingernails]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|toenails]].<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Transparent, colorless versions may strengthen nails or be used as a top or base coat to protect the nail or polish. This can be found in gloss, matte, and powder.\n* [[Setting spray]] is used as the last step in the process of applying makeup. It keeps applied makeup intact for long periods. An addition to setting spray is setting powder, which may be either pigmented or translucent. Both of these products claim to keep makeup from absorbing into the skin or melting off.\n* [[Eyelash extensions|False eyelashes]] are used when exaggerated eyelashes are desired. Their basic design usually consists of human hair, mink hair, or synthetic materials attached to a thin cloth-like band, which is applied with glue to the lashline. Designs vary in length and color. Rhinestones, gems, and even feathers and lace occur on some false eyelash designs. Eyelashes can be purchased in several drug or beauty supply stores and can be applied with eyelash glue. These eyelashes are not permanent and can be taken off easily by gently taking them off with your fingers.\n* [[Contouring]] is designed to give shape to an area of the face.  The aim is to enhance the natural shading on the face to give the illusion of a more defined facial structure which can be altered to preference.  Brighter skin coloured makeup products are used to 'highlight' areas which are wanted to draw attention to or to be caught in the light, whereas darker shades are used to create a shadow.  These light and dark tones are blended on the skin to create the illusion of a more definite face shape. It can be achieved using a \"contour palette\" \u2013 which can be either cream or powder.\nCosmetics can be also described by the physical composition of the product. Cosmetics can be liquid or cream [[emulsion]]s; powders, both pressed and loose; dispersions; and [[anhydrous]] creams or sticks.\n\n== Products ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}\n\nCleansing is a standard step in skin care routines.  Skin cleaning include some or all of these steps or cosmetics:\n\n* Cleansers or foaming washes are used to remove excess dirt, oil, and makeup left on the skin. Different cleansing products are aimed at various types of skin, such as sulfate-free cleansers and spin brushes.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n*Cleansing oil or oil cleanser is an oil-based solution that gently emulsifies the skin's natural oils. Cleansing oils are not recommended to individuals with blemish prone-skin.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n* Toners are used after cleansing the skin to freshen it up, boost the appearance of one's complexion, and remove any traces of cleanser, mask, or makeup, as well to help restore the skin's natural pH. They are usually applied to a cotton pad and wiped over the skin, but can be sprayed onto the skin from a spray bottle. Toners typically contain alcohol, water, and herbal extracts or other chemicals depending on skin type whether oily, dry, or combination. Toners containing alcohol are quite astringent, and usually targeted at oily skins. Dry or normal skin should be treated with alcohol-free toners. Witch hazel solution is a popular toner for all skin types, but many other products are available. Many toners contain [[salicylic acid]] and/or [[benzoyl peroxide]].\n* [[Facial mask]]s are treatments applied to the skin and then removed. Typically, they are applied to a dry, cleansed face, avoiding the eyes and lips.\n** Clay-based masks use kaolin clay or fuller's earth to transport essential oils and chemicals to the skin, and are typically left on until completely dry. As the clay dries, it absorbs excess oil and dirt from the surface of the skin and may help to clear blocked pores or draw comedones to the surface. Because of its drying actions, clay-based masks should only be used on oily skins.\n** Peel masks are typically gel-like in consistency, and contain acids or exfoliating agents to help exfoliate the skin, along with other ingredients to hydrate, discourage wrinkles, or treat uneven skin tone. They are left on to dry and then gently peeled off. They should be avoided by people with dry or sensitive skin, as they tend to be very drying.\n** Sheet masks are a relatively new product that are becoming extremely popular in Asia. Sheet masks consist of a thin cotton or fiber sheet with holes cut out for the eyes and lips and cut to fit the contours of the face, onto which serums and skin treatments are brushed in a thin layer; the sheets may be soaked in the treatment. Masks are available to suit almost all skin types and skin complaints. Sheet masks are quicker, less messy, and require no specialized knowledge or equipment for their use compared to other types of face masks, but they may be difficult to find and purchase outside Asia.\n* [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|Exfoliants]] are products that help slough off dry, dead skin cells to improve the skin's appearance. This is achieved either by using mild acids or other chemicals to loosen old skin cells, or abrasive substances to physically scrub them off. Exfoliation can even out patches of rough skin, improve circulation to the skin, clear blocked pores to discourage acne and improve the appearance and healing of scars.\n** Chemical exfoliants may include citric acid (from citrus fruits), acetic acid (from vinegar), malic acid (from fruit), glycolic acid, lactic acid, or salicylic acid. They may be liquids or gels, and may or may not contain an abrasive to remove old skin cells afterwards.\n\nAbrasive exfoliants include gels, creams or lotions, as well as physical objects. [[Luffa|Loofahs]], [[microfiber]] cloths, natural sponges, or brushes may be used to exfoliate skin, simply by rubbing them over the face in a circular motion. Gels, creams, or lotions may contain an acid to encourage dead skin cells to loosen, and an abrasive such as [[microbead]]s, sea salt and sugar, ground nut shells, rice bran, or ground apricot kernels to scrub the dead cells off the skin. Salt and sugar scrubs tend to be the harshest, while scrubs containing beads or rice bran are typically very gentle.\n\n* [[Moisturizer]]s are creams or lotions that hydrate the skin and help it to retain moisture; they may contain [[essential oil]]s, herbal extracts, or chemicals to assist with oil control or reducing irritation. Night creams are typically more hydrating than day creams, but may be too thick or heavy to wear during the day, hence their name. Tinted moisturizers contain a small amount of foundation, which can provide light coverage for minor blemishes or to even out skin tones. They are usually applied with the fingertips or a cotton pad to the entire face, avoiding the lips and area around the eyes. Eyes require a different kind of moisturizer compared with the rest of the face. The skin around the eyes is extremely thin and sensitive, and is often the first area to show signs of aging. Eye creams are typically very light lotions or gels, and are usually very gentle; some may contain ingredients such as caffeine or [[Vitamin K]] to reduce puffiness and dark circles under the eyes. Eye creams or gels should be applied over the entire eye area with a finger, using a patting motion. Finding a moisturizer with SPF is beneficial to prevent aging and wrinkles.\n\n== Brushes ==\nA makeup brush is used to apply makeup onto the face. There are two types of makeup brushes: synthetic and natural. Synthetic brushes are best for cream products while natural brushes are ideal for powder products.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/real-and-synthetic-makeup-brushes-difference-guide|title=This Is the Real Difference Between Natural and Synthetic Makeup Brushes|last=Webster|first=Emma Sarran|work=Teen Vogue|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en}}</ref> Using the appropriate brush to apply a certain product allows the product to blend into the skin smoothly and evenly.\n\n* A [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]] brush is usually a dense brush that distributes the product evenly while smoothing out the face. This brush is best used to achieve full coverage.\n* A [[concealer]] brush has a small, tapered tip that allows for precise spot correction such as blemishes or discoloration.\n* A stippling brush has soft, synthetic bristles that gives an airbrushed effect. This brush is best used to achieve light to medium coverage.\n* A [[Rouge (cosmetics)|blush]] brush comes in all shapes and sizes and is used to apply blush, allowing the blush to look natural while giving a flush of color.\n* A [[Face powder|powder]] brush tends to be big and fluffy for quick and easy application of dusting powder all over the face. Powder gives the appearance of a matte effect.\n* A bronzer blush, which can also serve as a contour brush is an angled brush that gives the face dimensions and illusions, by allowing the makeup to be placed in substitution of bone structure. This brush can also be used to add a shimmering highlight illusion to the cheekbones, nose and chin.\n* A highlight brush, also known as a fan brush, has bristles that are typically spread out and is used to apply where the sun would naturally hit.\n* An [[Eye shadow|eyeshadow]] brush is a dense brush that allows shadow to be packed onto the eyelid.\n* A blending eyeshadow brush is used to blend out any harsh lines you may have from the eyeshadow and can soften the eyeshadow look.\n* An [[Eye liner|eyeliner]] brush is tapered with an extra fine tip used for gel eyeliners which allows precision to line the eyes.\n* A spoolie is used to brush out the eyebrows and can also be used as a mascara wand.\n* A lip brush is small to ensure precision and is used to apply lipstick evenly onto the lips.\n* An eyebrow brush is tapered and is slanting from the top, which tends to define the eyebrows and fill in the empty spaces between brows, to give them a fuller and denser look.\n\n== Other products ==\n{{Main|Skin care|Sunscreen|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}\nThere are two categories of personal care products. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics as products intended to cleanse or beautify (for instance, shampoos and lipstick). A separate category exists for medications, which are intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent [[disease]], or to affect the structure or function of the body (for instance, sunscreens and acne creams). Some products, such as moisturizing sunscreens and anti-dandruff shampoos, are regulated within both categories.<ref name=\"Kessler2015\">Kessler R.

Typical organic compounds are modified natural oils and fats as well as a variety of petrochemically derived agents.  Inorganic compounds are processed minerals such as iron oxides, talc, and zinc oxide.  The oxides of zinc and iron are classified as [[pigment]]s, i.e. colorants that have no solubility in solvents.\n\n=== Natural ===\n{{See also|Organic movement|Maker culture}}\nHandmade and [[Organic certification|certified organic]] products are becoming more [[mainstream]], due to the fact that certain chemicals in some [[skincare]] products may be harmful if absorbed through the skin. Products claimed to be organic should, in the U.S., be certified \"USDA Organic\".<ref>{{cite news | title = Natural, Organic Beauty | work=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/fashion/01skin.html?_r=1&oref=slogin | first=Natasha | last=Singer | date=2007-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Mineral ===\nThe term \"mineral makeup\" applies to a category of face makeup, including foundation, eye shadow, blush, and bronzer, made with loose, dry mineral powders.  These powders are often mixed with oil-water [[emulsion]]s. Lipsticks, liquid foundations, and other liquid cosmetics, as well as compressed makeups such as eye shadow and blush in compacts, are often called mineral makeup if they have the same primary ingredients as dry mineral makeups. However, liquid makeups must contain preservatives and compressed makeups must contain binders, which dry mineral makeups do not.  Mineral makeup usually does not contain synthetic fragrances, preservatives, parabens, mineral oil, and chemical dyes. For this reason, dermatologists may consider mineral makeup to be gentler to the skin than makeup that contains those ingredients.<ref name=\"The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup\">{{cite web | url=https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/the-lowdown-on-mineral-makeup#2 | title=The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup | website=WebMD | accessdate=29 October 2018 | page=2}}</ref>  Some minerals are nacreous or pearlescent, giving the skin a shining or sparking appearance. One example is [[bismuth oxychloride]].<ref name=Ullmann /> There are various mineral-based makeup brands, including: Bare Minerals, [[Tarte Cosmetics|Tarte]], [[Bobbi Brown]], and [[Stila]].\n\n==== Porous minerals ====\nPorous minerals is a subcategory of mineral makeup ingredients where the porosity of the mineral particles enables extraordinary absorption capacity compared to non-porous mineral materials. This feature improves sebum control, long-lasting mattifying effect or gives a matte texture when used in makeup. Porous minerals can also act as carriers, absorbing a wide range of substances into its porous network.\n\n==== Benefits of mineral-based makeup ====\nAlthough some ingredients in cosmetics may cause concerns, some are widely seen as beneficial. Titanium dioxide, found in sunscreens, and zinc oxide have anti-inflammatory properties.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/literature-review-safety-titanium-dioxide-and-zinc-oxide-nanoparticles-sunscreens|title=Literature review on the safety of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles in sunscreens|last=Administration|first=Australian Government Department of Health.

It is in direct contact with the cosmetic product. Secondary packaging is the outer wrapping of one or several cosmetic container(s). An important difference between primary and secondary packaging is that any information that is necessary to clarify the safety of the product must appear on the primary package. Otherwise, much of the required information can appear on just the secondary packaging.<ref name=\"CosmeticsEuropeRegulation\">{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmetics Regulation|url=https://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/cosmetics-industry/understanding-cosmetics-regulation/|publisher=Cosmetics Europe Association|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nCosmetic packaging is standardized by the [[ISO 22715]], set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]]{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref name=\"ISO22715:2006\">{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO 22715:2006 Cosmetics \u2013 Packaging and labelling|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36436|publisher=ISO.org|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref> and regulated by national or regional regulations such as those issued by the [[Regulation (European Union)|EU]] or the [[FDA]].

In this industry, it is common fall back on a suitably qualified person, such as an independent third party inspection and testing company, to verify the cosmetics\u2019 compliance with the requirements of applicable cosmetic regulations and other relevant legislation, including [[Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals|REACH]], [[Good manufacturing practice|GMP]], [[Dangerous goods|hazardous substances]], etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bis.gov.uk/policies/consumer-issues/product-safety/cosmetic-products-safety-regulations-2008-as-amended|title=Product safety for manufacturers|work=bis.gov.uk}}</ref>\n\nIn the European Union, the circulation of cosmetic products and their safety has been a subject of legislation since 1976.

For instance, all annexes of the Regulation 1223/2009 were aimed to address potential risks to human [[health]].\nUnder the EU cosmetic regulation, manufacturers, retailers, and importers of cosmetics in Europe will be designated as \"Responsible Person\".<ref>[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2009:342:0059:0209:en:PDF \"EU Cosmetic Regulation 1223/2009\"], European Parliament & Council, 30 November 2009, Retrieved 7 April 2015</ref> This new status implies that the responsible person has the legal [[Legal liability|liability]] to ensure that the cosmetics and [[brand]]s they manufacture or sell comply with the current cosmetic regulations and norms.

The rules apply to manufacturers, importers, and retailers of cosmetics in Brazil, and most of them have been harmonized so they can apply to the entire [[Mercosur]].\n\nThe current legislation restricts the use of certain substances such as pyrogallol, [[formaldehyde]], or paraformaldehyde and bans the use of others such as lead [[acetate]] in cosmetic products. All restricted and forbidden substances and products are listed in the regulation RDC 16/11 and RDC 162, 09/11/01.\n\nMore recently, a new cosmetic [[Technical Regulation]] (RDC 15/2013) was set up to establish a list of authorized and restricted substances for cosmetic use, used in products such as [[Hair coloring|hair dyes]], nail hardeners, or used as product preservatives.\n\nMost Brazilian regulations are optimized, harmonized, or adapted in order to be applicable and extended to the entire Mercosur [[economic zone]].\n\n=== International ===\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) published new guidelines on the safe manufacturing of cosmetic products under a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) regime. Regulators in several countries and regions have adopted this standard, '''ISO 22716:2007''', effectively replacing existing guidance and standards.\nISO 22716 provides a comprehensive approach for a quality management system for those engaged in the manufacturing, packaging, testing, storage, and transportation of cosmetic end products. The standard deals with all aspects of the supply chain, from the early delivery of raw materials and components until the shipment of the final product to the consumer.\n\nThe standard is based on other quality management systems, ensuring smooth integration with such systems as ISO 9001 or the British Retail Consortium (BRC) standard for consumer products. Therefore, it combines the benefits of GMP, linking cosmetic product safety with overall business improvement tools that enable organisations to meet global consumer demand for cosmetic product safety certification.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36437 ISO 22716] ISO Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practices, Retrieved 09/27/2012</ref>\n\nIn July 2012, since microbial contamination is one of the greatest concerns regarding the quality of cosmetic products, the ISO has introduced a new standard for evaluating the antimicrobial protection of a cosmetic product by preservation efficacy testing and microbiological risk assessment.\n\n== Careers ==\n[[File:Professional Make-up Artist.jpg|right|thumb|A professional [[makeup artist]] servicing a client]]\n[[File:Alek Wek.jpg|right|thumb|Model [[Alek Wek]] receiving makeup from a professional.]]\n\nAn account executive is responsible for visiting department and specialty stores with counter sales of cosmetics.

They are usually paid by the hour by a cosmetic company; however, they sometimes work independently.\n\nProfessionals in cosmetics [[marketing]] careers manage research focus groups, promote the desired brand image, and provide other marketing services (sales forecasting, allocation to retailers, etc.).\n\nMany involved within the cosmetics industry often specialize in a certain area of cosmetics such as [[prosthetic makeup|special effects makeup]] or makeup techniques specific to the film, media, and fashion sectors.\n\nThe newest cosmetic based career is a beauty influencer. A beauty influencer is someone who has used their large social media following as a platform to make a name for themselves in the cosmetics industry.

Examples are the prevalent use of [[ceruse]] (white lead), to cover the face during the [[Renaissance]], and blindness caused by the [[mascara]] Lash Lure during the early 20th century.\n\n[[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian men]] and women used makeup to enhance their appearance. They were very fond of eyeliner and eye-shadows in dark colors including blue, red, and black. Ancient [[Sumer]]ian men and women were possibly the first to invent and wear lipstick, about 5,000 years ago.<ref>{{citation |title=Reading Our Lips: The History of Lipstick Regulation in Western Seats of Power |year=2006 |author=Schaffer, Sarah |publisher=Digital Access to Scholarship at Harvard |accessdate=2014-06-05 |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/10018966}}</ref> They crushed [[gemstone]]s and used them to decorate their faces, mainly on the lips and around the eyes.<ref name=\"lipstick3\">{{cite news |url= http://inventorspot.com/articles/the_slightly_gross_origins_lipstick_13653|title=The History of Lipstick And It's Slightly Gross Origins| publisher=InventorSpot|accessdate=2010-02-09}}</ref> Also around 3000 BC to 1500 BC, women in the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] applied red tinted lipstick to their lips for face decoration.<ref>Williams, Yona .

Cosmetics are mentioned in the [[Old Testament]], such as in 2 Kings 9:30, where [[Jezebel]] painted her eyelids\u2014approximately 840 BC\u2014and in the book of [[Esther]], where beauty treatments are described.\n\nOne of the most popular [[traditional Chinese medicine]]s is the fungus ''[[Tremella fuciformis]]'', used as a beauty product by women in China and Japan. The fungus reportedly increases moisture retention in the skin and prevents senile degradation of micro-blood vessels in the skin, reducing wrinkles and smoothing fine lines.  Other anti-aging effects come from increasing the presence of [[superoxide dismutase]] in the brain and liver; it is an [[enzyme]] that acts as a potent [[antioxidant]] throughout the body, particularly in the skin.

They compared themselves to delicate flowers and emphasized their delicacy and femininity. They always aimed to look pale and interesting. Sometimes ladies discreetly used a little rouge on the cheeks and used \"[[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]]\" to dilate their eyes so it would make them stand out more. Makeup was frowned upon in general, especially during the 1870s when social etiquette became more rigid. Teachers and clergywomen specifically were forbidden from the use of cosmetic products.\n\nDuring the 19th century, there was a high number of incidences of lead-poisoning because of the fashion for red and white lead makeup and powder. This led to swelling and inflammation of the eyes, weakened tooth enamel, and caused the skin to blacken. Heavy use was known to lead to death. However, in the second part of the 19th century, great advances were made in chemistry from the chemical fragrances that enabled a much easier production of cosmetic products.\n\nIt was socially acceptable for actresses in the 1800s to use makeup, and famous beauties such as [[Sarah Bernhardt]] and [[Lillie Langtry]] could be powdered. Most cosmetic products available were still either chemically dubious or found in the kitchen amid food coloring, berries and [[beetroot]].\n\nBy the middle of the 20th century, cosmetics were in widespread use by women in nearly all [[industrial society|industrial societies]] around the world. The cosmetic industry became a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the beginning of the 21st century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/sports-and-everyday-life/fashion-and-clothing/clothing-jewelry-and-personal-adornment/cosmetics|title=Cosmetics}}</ref>\n\nIn 1968 at the feminist [[Miss America protest]], protestors symbolically threw a number of feminine products into a \"Freedom Trash Can\".

The market was developed in the US during the 1910s by [[Elizabeth Arden]], [[Helena Rubinstein]], and [[Max Factor]]. These firms were joined by [[Revlon]] just before [[World War II]] and [[Est\u00e9e Lauder Companies|Est\u00e9e Lauder]] just after.\n\nAlthough modern makeup has been traditionally used mainly by women, an increasing number of men are using cosmetics usually associated to women to enhance or cover their own facial features such as blemishes, dark circles, and so on. Cosmetics brands release [[Male cosmetics|products specially tailored for men]], and men are increasingly using them.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/cos-206.html |title=FDA Authority Over Cosmetics |publisher=Cfsan.fda.gov |accessdate=2011-10-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513223418/http://www.cfsan.fda.gov/~dms/cos-206.html |archive-date=2009-05-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nCosmetics are intended to be applied externally. They include, but are not limited to, products that can be applied to the face: [[Human skin|skin]]-care [[Cream (pharmaceutical)|creams]], [[lipstick]]s, [[Human eye|eye]] and facial makeup, [[Wet wipe|towelettes]], and [[colored contact lenses]]; to the body: [[deodorant]]s, [[lotion]]s, [[Powder (substance)|powders]], [[perfume]]s, baby products, bath oils, [[bubble bath]]s, [[bath salts]], and body [[butter]]s; to the hands/nails: fingernail and toe [[nail polish]], and [[hand sanitizer]]; to the hair: permanent chemicals, [[hair]] [[hair coloring|colors]], [[hair spray]]s, and [[gel]]s.\n\nA subset of cosmetics is called \"makeup\", refers primarily to products containing color pigments that are intended to alter the user's appearance. Manufacturers may distinguish between \"decorative\" and \"care\" cosmetics.\n\nCosmetics that are meant to be used on the face and eye area are usually applied with a brush, a makeup sponge, or the fingertips.\n\nMost cosmetics are distinguished by the area of the body intended for application.\n* [[Lipstick]], [[lip gloss]], [[lip liner]], [[Lip augmentation|lip plumper]], [[lip balm]], lip stain, lip conditioner, lip primer, lip boosters, and lip butters:<ref name=USHealthandHuman>{{cite web|title=Cosmetics and Your Health \u2013 FAQs |url=http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |publisher=Womenshealth.gov |date=November 2004 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312162359/http://www.womenshealth.gov/publications/our-publications/fact-sheet/cosmetics-your-health.cfm |archivedate=2013-03-12 }}</ref> Lipsticks are intended to add color and texture to the lips and often come in a wide range of colors, as well as finishes such as matte, satin, gloss and lustre. Lip stains have a water or gel base and may contain alcohol to help the product stay on leaving a matte look. They temporarily saturate the lips with a dye. Usually designed to be waterproof, the product may come with an applicator [[makeup brush|brush]], directly through the applicator, rollerball, or could be applied with a finger. Lip glosses are intended to add shine to the lips and may add a tint of color, as well as being scented or flavored. Lip balms are most often used to moisturize, tint, and protect the lips. Some brands contain [[sunscreen]]. Using a priming lip product such as lip balm or chapstick can prevent chapped lips.\n* [[Primer (cosmetics)|Primer]] is used to set the face before makeup is applied. This creates another layer between the skin to prevent acne and makeup clogging up pores. Primer creates an even tone throughout the skin and makes makeup last longer. Primer is applied throughout the face including eyes, lips, and lashes. This product has a creamy texture and applies smoothly.\n* [[Concealer]] covers imperfections of the skin. Concealer is often used for any extra coverage needed to cover acne/pimple blemishes, undereye circles, and other imperfections. Concealer is often thicker and more solid than foundation, and provides longer lasting, more detailed coverage as well as creating a fresh clean base for all the rest of the makeup. This product also brightens up the skin and applying under the foundation can remove blemishes and discoloration because of acne scars. Some formulations are intended only for the eye or only for the face. This product can also be used for contouring the face like ones nose, cheekbones, and jaw line to add a more defined look to the total face. In that case, adding a setting powder will add a matte finish.\n* [[Foundation (cosmetics)|Foundation]] is used to smooth out the [[face]] by covering spots, [[acne]], blemishes, or uneven skin tone. These are sold in a liquid, cream, or powder, or more recently in a mousse. Foundation provides sheer, matte, dewy or full coverage.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Foundation primer is applied before foundation to fill out pores, create a dewy look or create a smoother finish. They usually come in cream formulas to be applied before foundation as a base.\n* [[Face powder]] sets the foundation and under eye concealer, giving it a [[wikt:Special:Search/matte|matte]] finish while also concealing small flaws or blemishes. It can also be used to [[Baking (make-up)|bake]] the foundation, so that it stays on longer and create a matte finish. Tinted face powders may be worn alone as a light foundation so that the full face does not look as caked-up as it could.\n* [[Rouge (cosmetics)|Rouge, blush, or blusher]] is cheek coloring to bring out the color in the [[cheek]]s and make the [[Zygomatic bone|cheekbones]] appear more defined. Rouge comes in powder, cream, and liquid forms. Different blush colors are used to complement different skin tones.<ref name=USHealthandHuman />\n* [[Highlighter (cosmetics)|Highlight]], used to draw attention to the high points of the face such as the cheekbones, below the eyebrows, nose, upper lip, and collar bones. This product also adds a glow; comes in liquid, cream, and powder forms. It often contains a substance to provide shimmer. Alternatively, a lighter-toned foundation/concealer can be used.\n* [[Bronzer]] gives skin a bit of color and contours the face for a sharper definition or creates a tan-look. Bronzer is considered to be more of a natural look and can be used for everyday wear. Bronzer enhances the color of the face.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> It comes in either matte, semi-matte/satin, or shimmer finishes.\n* [[Mascara]] is used to darken, lengthen, thicken, or draw attention to the [[eyelash]]es. It is available in various colors. Some mascaras include [[glitter]] flecks. There are many formulas, including [[Waterproofing|waterproof]] versions for those prone to [[allergies]] or sudden tears. It is often used after an [[eyelash curler]] and mascara primer.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Many mascaras have components to help lashes appear longer and thicker.\n[[File:Pre-wedding make-up.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Eye shadow]] being applied]]\n[[File:Jim Brochu.jpg|thumb|[[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] actor [[Jim Brochu]] applies makeup before the opening night of a play.]]\n* [[Eye shadow]] is a pigmented powder/cream or substance used to accentuate the eye area, traditionally on, above, and under the eyelids.  Many colours may be used at once and blended together to create different effects using a blending brush.  This is conventionally applied with a range of eyeshadow brushes, though it isn't uncommon for alternative methods of application to be used such as fingers. However, it is important to have clean fingers because oils from your skin can result in pimples <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/eyeshadow|title=eyeshadow \u2013 definition of eyeshadow in English {{!}} Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref>\n* [[Eye liner]] is used to enhance and elongate the apparent size or depth of the [[eye]]. For example, white eyeliner on the waterline and inner corners of the eye makes the eyes look bigger and more awake. It can come in the form of a pencil, a gel, or a liquid and can be found in almost any color. Conversely, black eyeliner makes eyes look smaller, brightens up the face and draws attention to the eyes.\n* [[Eyebrow]] pencils, creams, [[wax]]es, gels, and powders are used to color, fill in, and define the brows.<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Popular in recent years, the \"Instagram look\" is creating fuller eyebrows by filling it, sharper angles, and adding gel to set it.\n* [[Nail polish]] is used to color the [[Nail (anatomy)|fingernails]] and [[Nail (anatomy)|toenails]].<ref name=USHealthandHuman /> Transparent, colorless versions may strengthen nails or be used as a top or base coat to protect the nail or polish. This can be found in gloss, matte, and powder.\n* [[Setting spray]] is used as the last step in the process of applying makeup. It keeps applied makeup intact for long periods. An addition to setting spray is setting powder, which may be either pigmented or translucent. Both of these products claim to keep makeup from absorbing into the skin or melting off.\n* [[Eyelash extensions|False eyelashes]] are used when exaggerated eyelashes are desired. Their basic design usually consists of human hair, mink hair, or synthetic materials attached to a thin cloth-like band, which is applied with glue to the lashline. Designs vary in length and color. Rhinestones, gems, and even feathers and lace occur on some false eyelash designs. Eyelashes can be purchased in several drug or beauty supply stores and can be applied with eyelash glue. These eyelashes are not permanent and can be taken off easily by gently taking them off with your fingers.\n* [[Contouring]] is designed to give shape to an area of the face.  The aim is to enhance the natural shading on the face to give the illusion of a more defined facial structure which can be altered to preference.  Brighter skin coloured makeup products are used to 'highlight' areas which are wanted to draw attention to or to be caught in the light, whereas darker shades are used to create a shadow.  These light and dark tones are blended on the skin to create the illusion of a more definite face shape. It can be achieved using a \"contour palette\" \u2013 which can be either cream or powder.\nCosmetics can be also described by the physical composition of the product. Cosmetics can be liquid or cream [[emulsion]]s; powders, both pressed and loose; dispersions; and [[anhydrous]] creams or sticks.\n\n== Products ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2012}}\n\nCleansing is a standard step in skin care routines.  Skin cleaning include some or all of these steps or cosmetics:\n\n* Cleansers or foaming washes are used to remove excess dirt, oil, and makeup left on the skin. Different cleansing products are aimed at various types of skin, such as sulfate-free cleansers and spin brushes.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n*Cleansing oil or oil cleanser is an oil-based solution that gently emulsifies the skin's natural oils. Cleansing oils are not recommended to individuals with blemish prone-skin.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n* Toners are used after cleansing the skin to freshen it up, boost the appearance of one's complexion, and remove any traces of cleanser, mask, or makeup, as well to help restore the skin's natural pH. They are usually applied to a cotton pad and wiped over the skin, but can be sprayed onto the skin from a spray bottle. Toners typically contain alcohol, water, and herbal extracts or other chemicals depending on skin type whether oily, dry, or combination. Toners containing alcohol are quite astringent, and usually targeted at oily skins. Dry or normal skin should be treated with alcohol-free toners. Witch hazel solution is a popular toner for all skin types, but many other products are available. Many toners contain [[salicylic acid]] and/or [[benzoyl peroxide]].\n* [[Facial mask]]s are treatments applied to the skin and then removed. Typically, they are applied to a dry, cleansed face, avoiding the eyes and lips.\n** Clay-based masks use kaolin clay or fuller's earth to transport essential oils and chemicals to the skin, and are typically left on until completely dry. As the clay dries, it absorbs excess oil and dirt from the surface of the skin and may help to clear blocked pores or draw comedones to the surface. Because of its drying actions, clay-based masks should only be used on oily skins.\n** Peel masks are typically gel-like in consistency, and contain acids or exfoliating agents to help exfoliate the skin, along with other ingredients to hydrate, discourage wrinkles, or treat uneven skin tone. They are left on to dry and then gently peeled off. They should be avoided by people with dry or sensitive skin, as they tend to be very drying.\n** Sheet masks are a relatively new product that are becoming extremely popular in Asia. Sheet masks consist of a thin cotton or fiber sheet with holes cut out for the eyes and lips and cut to fit the contours of the face, onto which serums and skin treatments are brushed in a thin layer; the sheets may be soaked in the treatment. Masks are available to suit almost all skin types and skin complaints. Sheet masks are quicker, less messy, and require no specialized knowledge or equipment for their use compared to other types of face masks, but they may be difficult to find and purchase outside Asia.\n* [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|Exfoliants]] are products that help slough off dry, dead skin cells to improve the skin's appearance. This is achieved either by using mild acids or other chemicals to loosen old skin cells, or abrasive substances to physically scrub them off. Exfoliation can even out patches of rough skin, improve circulation to the skin, clear blocked pores to discourage acne and improve the appearance and healing of scars.\n** Chemical exfoliants may include citric acid (from citrus fruits), acetic acid (from vinegar), malic acid (from fruit), glycolic acid, lactic acid, or salicylic acid. They may be liquids or gels, and may or may not contain an abrasive to remove old skin cells afterwards.\n\nAbrasive exfoliants include gels, creams or lotions, as well as physical objects. [[Luffa|Loofahs]], [[microfiber]] cloths, natural sponges, or brushes may be used to exfoliate skin, simply by rubbing them over the face in a circular motion. Gels, creams, or lotions may contain an acid to encourage dead skin cells to loosen, and an abrasive such as [[microbead]]s, sea salt and sugar, ground nut shells, rice bran, or ground apricot kernels to scrub the dead cells off the skin. Salt and sugar scrubs tend to be the harshest, while scrubs containing beads or rice bran are typically very gentle.\n\n* [[Moisturizer]]s are creams or lotions that hydrate the skin and help it to retain moisture; they may contain [[essential oil]]s, herbal extracts, or chemicals to assist with oil control or reducing irritation. Night creams are typically more hydrating than day creams, but may be too thick or heavy to wear during the day, hence their name. Tinted moisturizers contain a small amount of foundation, which can provide light coverage for minor blemishes or to even out skin tones. They are usually applied with the fingertips or a cotton pad to the entire face, avoiding the lips and area around the eyes. Eyes require a different kind of moisturizer compared with the rest of the face. The skin around the eyes is extremely thin and sensitive, and is often the first area to show signs of aging. Eye creams are typically very light lotions or gels, and are usually very gentle; some may contain ingredients such as caffeine or [[Vitamin K]] to reduce puffiness and dark circles under the eyes. Eye creams or gels should be applied over the entire eye area with a finger, using a patting motion. Finding a moisturizer with SPF is beneficial to prevent aging and wrinkles.\n\n== Brushes ==\nA makeup brush is used to apply makeup onto the face. There are two types of makeup brushes: synthetic and natural. Synthetic brushes are best for cream products while natural brushes are ideal for powder products.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/real-and-synthetic-makeup-brushes-difference-guide|title=This Is the Real Difference Between Natural and Synthetic Makeup Brushes|last=Webster|first=Emma Sarran|work=Teen Vogue|access-date=2018-05-07|language=en}}</ref> Using the appropriate brush to apply a certain product allows the product to blend into the skin smoothly and evenly.\n\n* A [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]] brush is usually a dense brush that distributes the product evenly while smoothing out the face. This brush is best used to achieve full coverage.\n* A [[concealer]] brush has a small, tapered tip that allows for precise spot correction such as blemishes or discoloration.\n* A stippling brush has soft, synthetic bristles that gives an airbrushed effect. This brush is best used to achieve light to medium coverage.\n* A [[Rouge (cosmetics)|blush]] brush comes in all shapes and sizes and is used to apply blush, allowing the blush to look natural while giving a flush of color.\n* A [[Face powder|powder]] brush tends to be big and fluffy for quick and easy application of dusting powder all over the face. Powder gives the appearance of a matte effect.\n* A bronzer blush, which can also serve as a contour brush is an angled brush that gives the face dimensions and illusions, by allowing the makeup to be placed in substitution of bone structure. This brush can also be used to add a shimmering highlight illusion to the cheekbones, nose and chin.\n* A highlight brush, also known as a fan brush, has bristles that are typically spread out and is used to apply where the sun would naturally hit.\n* An [[Eye shadow|eyeshadow]] brush is a dense brush that allows shadow to be packed onto the eyelid.\n* A blending eyeshadow brush is used to blend out any harsh lines you may have from the eyeshadow and can soften the eyeshadow look.\n* An [[Eye liner|eyeliner]] brush is tapered with an extra fine tip used for gel eyeliners which allows precision to line the eyes.\n* A spoolie is used to brush out the eyebrows and can also be used as a mascara wand.\n* A lip brush is small to ensure precision and is used to apply lipstick evenly onto the lips.\n* An eyebrow brush is tapered and is slanting from the top, which tends to define the eyebrows and fill in the empty spaces between brows, to give them a fuller and denser look.\n\n== Other products ==\n{{Main|Skin care|Sunscreen|Health effects of sunlight exposure}}\nThere are two categories of personal care products. The Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act defines cosmetics as products intended to cleanse or beautify (for instance, shampoos and lipstick). A separate category exists for medications, which are intended to diagnose, cure, mitigate, treat, or prevent [[disease]], or to affect the structure or function of the body (for instance, sunscreens and acne creams). Some products, such as moisturizing sunscreens and anti-dandruff shampoos, are regulated within both categories.<ref name=\"Kessler2015\">Kessler R.

Makeup sponges can be used to apply foundation, blend concealer, and apply powder or highlighter. The most popular brand of makeup sponges is the Beauty Blender.\n\n== Ingredients ==\n{{Main|Ingredients of cosmetics}}\nA variety of [[organic compound]]s and [[inorganic compound]]s comprise typical cosmetics.  Typical organic compounds are modified natural oils and fats as well as a variety of petrochemically derived agents.  Inorganic compounds are processed minerals such as iron oxides, talc, and zinc oxide.  The oxides of zinc and iron are classified as [[pigment]]s, i.e. colorants that have no solubility in solvents.\n\n=== Natural ===\n{{See also|Organic movement|Maker culture}}\nHandmade and [[Organic certification|certified organic]] products are becoming more [[mainstream]], due to the fact that certain chemicals in some [[skincare]] products may be harmful if absorbed through the skin. Products claimed to be organic should, in the U.S., be certified \"USDA Organic\".<ref>{{cite news | title = Natural, Organic Beauty | work=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/01/fashion/01skin.html?_r=1&oref=slogin | first=Natasha | last=Singer | date=2007-11-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Mineral ===\nThe term \"mineral makeup\" applies to a category of face makeup, including foundation, eye shadow, blush, and bronzer, made with loose, dry mineral powders.  These powders are often mixed with oil-water [[emulsion]]s. Lipsticks, liquid foundations, and other liquid cosmetics, as well as compressed makeups such as eye shadow and blush in compacts, are often called mineral makeup if they have the same primary ingredients as dry mineral makeups. However, liquid makeups must contain preservatives and compressed makeups must contain binders, which dry mineral makeups do not.  Mineral makeup usually does not contain synthetic fragrances, preservatives, parabens, mineral oil, and chemical dyes. For this reason, dermatologists may consider mineral makeup to be gentler to the skin than makeup that contains those ingredients.<ref name=\"The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup\">{{cite web | url=https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/the-lowdown-on-mineral-makeup#2 | title=The Lowdown on Mineral Makeup | website=WebMD | accessdate=29 October 2018 | page=2}}</ref>  Some minerals are nacreous or pearlescent, giving the skin a shining or sparking appearance. One example is [[bismuth oxychloride]].<ref name=Ullmann /> There are various mineral-based makeup brands, including: Bare Minerals, [[Tarte Cosmetics|Tarte]], [[Bobbi Brown]], and [[Stila]].\n\n==== Porous minerals ====\nPorous minerals is a subcategory of mineral makeup ingredients where the porosity of the mineral particles enables extraordinary absorption capacity compared to non-porous mineral materials. This feature improves sebum control, long-lasting mattifying effect or gives a matte texture when used in makeup. Porous minerals can also act as carriers, absorbing a wide range of substances into its porous network.\n\n==== Benefits of mineral-based makeup ====\nAlthough some ingredients in cosmetics may cause concerns, some are widely seen as beneficial. Titanium dioxide, found in sunscreens, and zinc oxide have anti-inflammatory properties.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tga.gov.au/literature-review-safety-titanium-dioxide-and-zinc-oxide-nanoparticles-sunscreens|title=Literature review on the safety of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide nanoparticles in sunscreens|last=Administration|first=Australian Government Department of Health.

It is in direct contact with the cosmetic product. Secondary packaging is the outer wrapping of one or several cosmetic container(s). An important difference between primary and secondary packaging is that any information that is necessary to clarify the safety of the product must appear on the primary package. Otherwise, much of the required information can appear on just the secondary packaging.<ref name=\"CosmeticsEuropeRegulation\">{{cite web|title=Understanding the Cosmetics Regulation|url=https://www.cosmeticseurope.eu/cosmetics-industry/understanding-cosmetics-regulation/|publisher=Cosmetics Europe Association|accessdate=3 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nCosmetic packaging is standardized by the [[ISO 22715]], set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]]{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref name=\"ISO22715:2006\">{{cite web|last1=International Organization for Standardization|title=ISO 22715:2006 Cosmetics \u2013 Packaging and labelling|url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36436|publisher=ISO.org|accessdate=2 November 2016}}</ref> and regulated by national or regional regulations such as those issued by the [[Regulation (European Union)|EU]] or the [[FDA]].

All restricted and forbidden substances and products are listed in the regulation RDC 16/11 and RDC 162, 09/11/01.\n\nMore recently, a new cosmetic [[Technical Regulation]] (RDC 15/2013) was set up to establish a list of authorized and restricted substances for cosmetic use, used in products such as [[Hair coloring|hair dyes]], nail hardeners, or used as product preservatives.\n\nMost Brazilian regulations are optimized, harmonized, or adapted in order to be applicable and extended to the entire Mercosur [[economic zone]].\n\n=== International ===\nThe [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) published new guidelines on the safe manufacturing of cosmetic products under a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) regime. Regulators in several countries and regions have adopted this standard, '''ISO 22716:2007''', effectively replacing existing guidance and standards.\nISO 22716 provides a comprehensive approach for a quality management system for those engaged in the manufacturing, packaging, testing, storage, and transportation of cosmetic end products. The standard deals with all aspects of the supply chain, from the early delivery of raw materials and components until the shipment of the final product to the consumer.\n\nThe standard is based on other quality management systems, ensuring smooth integration with such systems as ISO 9001 or the British Retail Consortium (BRC) standard for consumer products. Therefore, it combines the benefits of GMP, linking cosmetic product safety with overall business improvement tools that enable organisations to meet global consumer demand for cosmetic product safety certification.<ref>[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=36437 ISO 22716] ISO Guidelines on Good Manufacturing Practices, Retrieved 09/27/2012</ref>\n\nIn July 2012, since microbial contamination is one of the greatest concerns regarding the quality of cosmetic products, the ISO has introduced a new standard for evaluating the antimicrobial protection of a cosmetic product by preservation efficacy testing and microbiological risk assessment.\n\n== Careers ==\n[[File:Professional Make-up Artist.jpg|right|thumb|A professional [[makeup artist]] servicing a client]]\n[[File:Alek Wek.jpg|right|thumb|Model [[Alek Wek]] receiving makeup from a professional.]]\n\nAn account executive is responsible for visiting department and specialty stores with counter sales of cosmetics. They explain new products and \"gifts with purchase\" arrangements (free items given out upon purchase of cosmetics items costing over some set amount).\n\nA beauty adviser provides product advice based on the client's skin care and makeup requirements. Beauty advisers can be certified by an Anti-Aging Beauty Institute.\n\nA [[Cosmetology|cosmetician]] is a professional who provides facial and body treatments for clients. The term [[Cosmetology|cosmetologist]] is sometimes used interchangeably with this term, but the former most commonly refers to a certified professional. A freelance [[makeup artist]] provides clients with beauty advice and cosmetics assistance. They are usually paid by the hour by a cosmetic company; however, they sometimes work independently.\n\nProfessionals in cosmetics [[marketing]] careers manage research focus groups, promote the desired brand image, and provide other marketing services (sales forecasting, allocation to retailers, etc.).\n\nMany involved within the cosmetics industry often specialize in a certain area of cosmetics such as [[prosthetic makeup|special effects makeup]] or makeup techniques specific to the film, media, and fashion sectors.\n\nThe newest cosmetic based career is a beauty influencer. A beauty influencer is someone who has used their large social media following as a platform to make a name for themselves in the cosmetics industry. The most successful beauty influencers such as Jeffree Star, James Charles, and Jaclyn Hill, go on to create their own makeup brands or collaborate with other major brands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Airbrush makeup]]\n* [[Baking (make-up)|Baking]]\n* [[Body art]]\n* [[Cosmeceutical]]\n* [[Cosmetic packaging]]\n* [[Electrotherapy (cosmetic)]]\n* [[Female cosmetic coalitions]]\n* [[Henna]]\n* [[List of cosmetic ingredients]]\n* [[Male cosmetics]]\n* [[Maker culture]]\n* [[Moulage]]\n* [[Natural skin care]]\n* [[Permanent makeup]]\n* [[Skin care]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book|last=Winter|first=Ruth|title=A Consumer's Dictionary of Cosmetic Ingredients: Complete Information About the Harmful and Desirable Ingredients in Cosmetics (Paperback)|origyear=2005|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=US|isbn=978-1-4000-5233-2|year=2005}}\n\n{{Sister project links| wikt=no | commons=Category:Cosmetics | b=no | n=no | q=Cosmetics | s=no | v=no | voy=no | species=no | d=no}}\n\n{{Cosmetics}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cosmetics| ]]\n[[Category:Skin care]]\n", "name_user": "82.26.152.174", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmetics"}

The tank version variant were the first passenger tank engines to enter service in the world.\n\nThey have been claimed to be the first locomotives to use outside horizontal cylinders{{efn|Outside cylinders means the cylinders were placed outside of the wheels. It is possible some earlier engines may have had outside cylinders. Dodd's Star of 1833 and possibly one other may have a claim.}} and also the first to use 4 eccentric cranks.  The use of outside cylinders on a short wheelbases with no wheel balances resulted in an oscillating movement at speed, resulting in a nickname of \"Boxers\" and most being rebuilt from {{Whyte|2-2-0}} to incorporate trailing axle becoming configured as {{Whyte|2-2-2}}.\n\nLocomotives were supplied to the [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] (L&MR), [[Dublin and Kingstown Railway|Dublin and Kingstown]] (D&KR), [[London and Greenwich Railway|London and Greenwich]] (L&GR) Railways, and a few other minor railways.\n\n==History==\nGeorge Forrester's Vauxhall Foundry had been established in Liverpool by 1827, taking over a disused cotton mill.  The location was about {{Convert|1.5|mi|km}} from the L&MR's Edge Hill Workshops and was also convenient to the docks.  The L&MR had started operating in 1830, becoming the first example of successfully operating railway in the world and the model upon which the next generation of railways used as a study example for their own projects.  While most L&MR locomotives in the early 1830s were supplied by [[Robert Stephenson and Company]] of Newcastle that company was unable to supply demand and other suppliers were entering the market.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}  Forrester's had first become with the proposal to construct locomotives in response to a tender invitation by the L&MR in May 1831 but pulled out following a misunderstanding with the L&MR's secretary [[Henry Booth]], the tender being satisfied by ''Bee'' and ''Liver'' from Edward Bury and [[Experiment (locomotive)|''Experiment'']] from Robert Sharp.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|p=157}}  Forresters, along with other firms, did however perform some locomotive component construction or repair work for the L&MR in the early 1830s.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|p=162}}\n\n===Design===\n{{Under construction|section=yes}}\nThe D&KR had started their procurement for tendering for locomotives in August 1833 approaching nine firms with a requirement for six locomotives to be delivered in perfect working order by 1 May 1834; the seven who replied all commenting on the short timescale.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|pp=173\u2013174}}  The D&KR engaged [[John Urpeth Rastrick]] as consultant to visit the prospective builders and he returned with a specification which matched an improved [[Experiment (locomotive)|''Experiment'']] locomotive from [[Sharp, Roberts and Co.|Sharp Brothers]] of Manchester.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|pp=173\u2013174}}  D&KR engineers [[Charles Blacker Vignoles|Vignoles]] and [[Thomas Fleming Bergin|Bergin]] has concerns over the vertical cylinders and other aspects of '''Experiment'' and Sharp Brothers design and the D&KR board of directors asked the locomotive manufacturers to submit their own proposals; Liverpools's [[Edward Bury]], favoured by some of the D&KR's [[Quaker]] board, being eliminated at his stage over insistence of use of an inside-cylinder design with a crank axle which was not favoured by D&KR engineers.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|pp=173\u2013174}}\n\nIn December 1833 With time running short to get locomotives built for their planned start of operations the D&KR board finally placed based an order for three locomotives from Sharp Brothers that were to become the [[Hibernia (locomotive)|''Hibernia'']] type, and three from George Forrester.  They would have originally preferred to have placed all six with one manufacturer for parts commonality however ability to complete the build in the needed timescale had become a priority and degrees of uncertainty about both designs may have been a factor.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|pp=172\u2013174}} Forrester had not built any locomotive prior to the D&KR order,{{Sfnp|Lowe|2014|pp=176\u2013177}} so winning the order may seem unexpected.  Forrester did have some advantages: Liverpool base at convenient to the L&MR and their workshops; Good communications with regualr steam packet to Dublin; previous component build work for the L&MR; amiable relations with the customer; and a reputation for good workmanship, though that may have gained later.{{cn|date=March 2020}  The design may have been evolved with the collaboration of or intention to satisfy Vignoles and Bergin.  Snell claims Vignoles obtained a set of drawings from Dodds, albeit Snell also claims Dodds influence was not present until later D&KR engines.  While seemingly not involved in the design the employment of [[Alexander Allan (locomotive engineer)|Alexander Allan]] from [[Stephenson]]'s would have been a help.  It is also the case Forrester was given the Stephenson locomotive ''Milo'' by the L&MR in 1834 with a view to a repair quote; the L&MR eventually accepting ''Milo'' was uneconomic to repair leaving Forrester to scrap ''Milo'' and with the L&MR proving ''Swiftsure'' as a replacement \u2014 the precise dates are unclear and it was possibly too late in the year to reverse engineer any of ''Milo{{'}}s'' features into the Forrester design.{{cn|date=March 2020|reason=Need to go over this section carefully}}\n\nD&KR officials often did spot visits to Forresters during the their locomotives construction and were generally well received by Forresters, their spot checks at Sharps sometimes gave indication of staff problems and absenteeism.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=177}}\n\nThe company first began to produce railway locomotives in 1834.{{Sfnp|Lowe|2014|pp=176\u2013177}}  The locomotives constructed in that year were ''Swiftsure'' for the L&MR; with ''Vauxhall'', ''Dublin'' and ''Kingstown'' for the D&KR which was to begin operations in December of that year.  ''Swiftsure'' was a locomotive built by Forresters of the Vauxhall Foundry in Liverpool which entered service for the L&MR in 1834 as No. 36.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} It is claimed to be the first locomotive built by the company.{{Sfnp|Stretton|1903|pp=62\u201363}}{{Sfnp|Pangborn|1894|loc=pp. n105\u2013n106}} The type were the first locomotives to use outside cylinders and also the first outside and inside frames, though the later was not appreciated at the time and only adopted some ten years later.{{Sfnp|Nock|1975|pp=7\u20139}} The combination of outside frames on a short {{Whyte|2-2-0}} wheelbase with unbalanced driving wheels led to an oscillating motion and led to the nickname of \"Boxers\".{{Sfnp|Nock|1975|pp=7\u20139}}{{Additional citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=unbalanced driving wheels}}  Many locomotives eventually were fitted with a trailing axle to become a {{Whyte|2-2-2|T}} to help reduce the problem.\n\n===Liverpool and Manchester===\n''Swiftsure'' entered service on the L&MR as a {{Whyte|2-2-0}} in October 1834 with two outside {{convert|11|x|18|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} cylinders,{{efn|The date seems surprisingly late in the year if {{harv|Thomas|1980|pp=162\u2013163}} is correct.}} for a price of \u00a3860.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|pp=162\u2013163}}  It was noted as being involved in a collision with at [[Parkside railway station (Merseyside)|Parkside]] on 11 November 1934 with the consequence that a labourer was crushed between wagons of the stationary between the wagons of the stationary luggage train.{{efn|Freight or goods trains were termed luggage trains in this period.}} The labourer was later to die of his injuries and the \"occasional engineman\" charge of ''Swiftsure'' was held responsible for entering a watering stop at more than {{Convert|6|mph|kph}} and was sanctioned by losing his turn on the promotion list.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|pp=210}}  ''Swiftsure'' was involved in a further incident in July 1835 whilst descending the incline at [[Whiston, Merseyside]] when a train of five [[silk]] wagons caught fire; the train took several hundred yards to stop and some wagons were only detached with difficulty.  The L&MR was ultimately advised to pay \u00a33,000 damages for the high value load on the basis they had not adequately displayed notices that the owners should have insured it.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|p=206}} ''Swiftsure'' was involved in several experiments during its service life. In November 1836 the L&MR performed a coal burning trial involving ''Swiftsure'' and several other locomotives, the results being generally unsuccessful with ''Swiftsure''{{'}}s firebox damaged by excessive heat.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|pp=175\u2013176}} Locomotives at this period were forced to use the more expensive and sometimes problematic coke in order to fulfill the requirement to \"consume their own smoke\"; it took several years for the technology to use coal successfully in locomotives to evolve.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|p=175}}\n\n===Dublin and Kingstown===\nThe Forresters' locomotives for the D&KR became known as ''Vauxhall'', ''Dublin'' and ''Kingstown''; the names representing the location of manufacture and the termini of the line.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe first of the D&KR locomotives{{efn|It would probably be reasonably assumed this was ''Vauxhall'' but it is not named as such in the source.}} ran sufficiently well on tests on the L&MR that it was permitted by their superintendent Manchester to take charge of the first class train to Liverpool on 27 June 1834. The journey was completed in 1h 17m with several D&KR people on board including [[James Pim|Pim (Junior)]], [[Thomas Flemming Bergin]], Vignoles and other directors.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=177}}\n\n''Vauxhall'' along with ''Hibernia'' were transported to Dublin on the same sailing before being hauled though the streets on temporary tracks.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=177}}  There is a legend ''Vauxhall'' was the first locomotive to reach the D&KR's [[Permanent way|tracks]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe first recorded service of the invited members of the public being transported was a special preview trip to Martello Tower and Booterstown by ''Vauxhall'' on 4 October 1834.  The honour of the first trial run over the entire length of the line fell to Forresters Hibernia on 9 October 1834 with ''Vauxhall'' doing a trip later in the day.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe honour of the first scheduled train in Ireland fell to Sharp's locomotive ''Hibernia'' at 09:00 17 December 1834; this being the famously celebrated inaugural run.  While Forrester's ''Vauxhall'' ran the next service and both continued running trips throughout the day.  The D&KR commenced its full scheduled service in January 1835.\n\nMaintenance of the class was at the Serpentine Road [[Grand Canal Street railway works|\"engine hospital\"]] with one section reserved for Forrester locomotives with their man [[Alexander Allan (locomotive engineer)|Alexander Allan]] on site for one year per the purchase contract.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=177}}\n\nMost (all) were rebuilt to {{Whyte|2-2-0}} tank engines to match the later Comet Class.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===London and Greenwich===\nThe [[London and Greenwich Railway]] began a public service on the {{Convert|2+1/2|mi|km}} section between {{rws|Spa Road}} and {{rws|Deptford}} in February 1836.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1986|p=50}} Locomotives in use at this point were two [[Planet (locomotive)|''Planet'']] type of the {{Whyte|2-2-0}} configuration. ''Royal William'' was supplied by William Marshall & Sons.{{efn|{{harv|Thomas|1986}} locates Marshall & Sons at Tipton while {{harv|Lowe|2014|pp=458\u2013459}} indicates [[Gravesend]].}} Lowe also finds alternative sources indicating No. 1 was supplied by [[Charles Tayleur and Company]] which had links to Stephenson and this was as a set of parts and assembled on site.  That source also indicates Marshalls were previously Braithwaites until 1839,{{harv|Whishaw|1842|loc=p=xii(n552)}} and ''Venus'' supplied by the L&MR possibly as a hire to replaced an esoteric {{Whyte|0-2-0}} rotary steam engine supplied by [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Earl Dundonald]].  ''Victoria'' from Forresters became the third operational engine in May 1836 for the sum of \u00a31010 10s 0d.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1986|pp=176\u2212177}} The L&GR had initially ordered locomotives from [[Robert Stephenson and Company|Stephenson's]] and [[Edward Bury and Company|Burys]] however neither actually supplied.{{efn|{{harv|Lowe|2014|pp=458\u2013459}} says Bury subcontracted to Forrester (both factories were in the Liverpool docks area) while Stephenson had links to Charles Tayleur.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}}}  Forrester's second engine ''Walter''{{efn|Forrester's had named the locomotive ''William'' but the L&GR renamed it ''Walter'' to avoid a clash, presumably after their director George Walter.}} arrived in December 1836 in time for the extension to [[London Bridge station]], becoming the sixth operational engine, ''Royal William'' having acquired three sister locomotives in the interim.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1986|pp=176\u2212177}}  ''Victoria'' and ''Walter'' with their {{Whyte|2-2-0|WT}} configuration and acquired the nickname \"Boxers\" for the typical yawing motion of type.  Trials in 1837 revealed that ''Walter'' was more powerful than ''Royal William''. Both were converted to tender locomotives, possibly in an effort to reduce the yawing.  They were painted green, acquiring the numbers five and six respectively and possibly losing their names from the 1840s.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n''Victoria'' had a trailing axle added in 1841 to become a {{Whyte|2-2-0}}, before becoming a pumping engine at [[Bricklayers Arms railway yard|Bricklayers Arms]] from December 1845 and was finally acquired by C. Tomkins at [[Reading]] for scrap for \u00a3110.  ''Walter'' was never fitted with a trailing axle.  It saw service at [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]] repair shops from January 1846 followed by an assignment to the [[Gomshall]] sandpits from 1853 until it was scrapped along with ''Victoria''.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1986|p=191}}\n\n===Birmingham and Gloucester===\nThe [[Birmingham and Gloucester Railway]] possessed four Forrester {{Whyte|2-2-2}}s:{{Sfnp|Various|1842|p=202}} ''the Cheltenham'', ''the Worcester'', ''the Bromsgrove'' and ''the Cheltenham''.{{Sfnp|Whisham|1842|p=30}}  These appear to be tender locomotive given the company had 15 tenders for 15 locomotives at one point.{{Sfnp|Whisham|1982|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n===Other railways===\nParliamentary papers published in 1842 seem to yield examples of other railways using {{Whyte|2-2-0}} and {{Whyte|2-2-2}} Forrester engines.{{Sfnp|Various|1841}}  The [[Preston and Wyre Joint Railway|Preston and Wyre Railway]] (P&WR) had a Forrester {{Whyte|2-2-0}} it sued for light goods, ballasting work, and occasional special passenger trains.  Its other engine was a {{Whyte|2-2-2}} goods and its passenger services were generally worked by another railway.  The P&WR was aware their six-wheeled locomotive seemed to cause far less track wear than several other four wheel locomotives used on the railway, but that there 4 wheel Forrester could negotiate some curves the six wheel could not.{{Sfnp|Various|1842|pp=219\u2013220}}{{efn|The P&WR included docks where sharp curves might be found.}}  The [[Grand Junction Railway]] had between one and three Forrester engines {{Whyte|2-2-2}} engines based on the information they had three locomotives with outside cylinders with one different to the other two.{{Sfnp|Various|1842|pp=211\u2013212}}  The [[Manchester and Bolton Railway#Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal Company|Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal Navigation and Railway]] (MB&CNR) had two Forrester {{Whyte|2-2-0}}s and eight {{Whyte|0-4-0}}s from [[Edward Bury]] and [[Fairnburn]] with a preference to go for Bury's engine if more were needed.{{sfnp|Various|1842|pp=205-206}}\n\n==Legacy==\nThe class was to form the basis for the locomotives produced for the D&KR excepting the three from Sharpes and ''Star'' from Dodds.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}  The locomotives [[Alexander Allan (locomotive engineer)|Alexander Allan]] went on design for the [[Grand Junction Railway]] and [[London and North Western Railway]] (including the [[Crewe type (locomotive)]]) showed influences from Forrester practice.{{Sfnp|Lowe|2014|p=177}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|ref=}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite letter|last=Bergin|first1=T.

While most L&MR locomotives in the early 1830s were supplied by [[Robert Stephenson and Company]] of Newcastle that company was unable to supply demand and other suppliers were entering the market.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}  Forrester's had first become with the proposal to construct locomotives in response to a tender invitation by the L&MR in May 1831 but pulled out following a misunderstanding with the L&MR's secretary [[Henry Booth]], the tender being satisfied by ''Bee'' and ''Liver'' from Edward Bury and [[Experiment (locomotive)|''Experiment'']] from Robert Sharp.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|p=157}}  Forresters, along with other firms, did however perform some locomotive component construction or repair work for the L&MR in the early 1830s.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|p=162}}\n\n===Design===\n{{Under construction|section=yes}}\nThe D&KR had started their procurement for tendering for locomotives in August 1833 approaching nine firms with a requirement for six locomotives to be delivered in perfect working order by 1 May 1834; the seven who replied all commenting on the short timescale.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|pp=173\u2013174}}  The D&KR engaged [[John Urpeth Rastrick]] as consultant to visit the prospective builders and he returned with a specification which matched an improved [[Experiment (locomotive)|''Experiment'']] locomotive from [[Sharp, Roberts and Co.|Sharp Brothers]] of Manchester.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|pp=173\u2013174}}  D&KR engineers [[Charles Blacker Vignoles|Vignoles]] and [[Thomas Fleming Bergin|Bergin]] has concerns over the vertical cylinders and other aspects of '''Experiment'' and Sharp Brothers design and the D&KR board of directors asked the locomotive manufacturers to submit their own proposals; Liverpools's [[Edward Bury]], favoured by some of the D&KR's [[Quaker]] board, being eliminated at his stage over insistence of use of an inside-cylinder design with a crank axle which was not favoured by D&KR engineers.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|pp=173\u2013174}}\n\nIn December 1833 With time running short to get locomotives built for their planned start of operations the D&KR board finally placed based an order for three locomotives from Sharp Brothers that were to become the [[Hibernia (locomotive)|''Hibernia'']] type, and three from George Forrester.  They would have originally preferred to have placed all six with one manufacturer for parts commonality however ability to complete the build in the needed timescale had become a priority and degrees of uncertainty about both designs may have been a factor.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|pp=172\u2013174}} Forrester had not built any locomotive prior to the D&KR order,{{Sfnp|Lowe|2014|pp=176\u2013177}} so winning the order may seem unexpected.  Forrester did have some advantages: Liverpool base at convenient to the L&MR and their workshops; Good communications with regualr steam packet to Dublin; previous component build work for the L&MR; amiable relations with the customer; and a reputation for good workmanship, though that may have gained later.{{cn|date=March 2020}  The design may have been evolved with the collaboration of or intention to satisfy Vignoles and Bergin.  Snell claims Vignoles obtained a set of drawings from Dodds, albeit Snell also claims Dodds influence was not present until later D&KR engines.  While seemingly not involved in the design the employment of [[Alexander Allan (locomotive engineer)|Alexander Allan]] from [[Stephenson]]'s would have been a help.  It is also the case Forrester was given the Stephenson locomotive ''Milo'' by the L&MR in 1834 with a view to a repair quote; the L&MR eventually accepting ''Milo'' was uneconomic to repair leaving Forrester to scrap ''Milo'' and with the L&MR proving ''Swiftsure'' as a replacement \u2014 the precise dates are unclear and it was possibly too late in the year to reverse engineer any of ''Milo{{'}}s'' features into the Forrester design.{{cn|date=March 2020|reason=Need to go over this section carefully}}\n\nD&KR officials often did spot visits to Forresters during the their locomotives construction and were generally well received by Forresters, their spot checks at Sharps sometimes gave indication of staff problems and absenteeism.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=177}}\n\nThe company first began to produce railway locomotives in 1834.{{Sfnp|Lowe|2014|pp=176\u2013177}}  The locomotives constructed in that year were ''Swiftsure'' for the L&MR; with ''Vauxhall'', ''Dublin'' and ''Kingstown'' for the D&KR which was to begin operations in December of that year.  ''Swiftsure'' was a locomotive built by Forresters of the Vauxhall Foundry in Liverpool which entered service for the L&MR in 1834 as No. 36.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} It is claimed to be the first locomotive built by the company.{{Sfnp|Stretton|1903|pp=62\u201363}}{{Sfnp|Pangborn|1894|loc=pp. n105\u2013n106}} The type were the first locomotives to use outside cylinders and also the first outside and inside frames, though the later was not appreciated at the time and only adopted some ten years later.{{Sfnp|Nock|1975|pp=7\u20139}} The combination of outside frames on a short {{Whyte|2-2-0}} wheelbase with unbalanced driving wheels led to an oscillating motion and led to the nickname of \"Boxers\".{{Sfnp|Nock|1975|pp=7\u20139}}{{Additional citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=unbalanced driving wheels}}  Many locomotives eventually were fitted with a trailing axle to become a {{Whyte|2-2-2|T}} to help reduce the problem.\n\n===Liverpool and Manchester===\n''Swiftsure'' entered service on the L&MR as a {{Whyte|2-2-0}} in October 1834 with two outside {{convert|11|x|18|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} cylinders,{{efn|The date seems surprisingly late in the year if {{harv|Thomas|1980|pp=162\u2013163}} is correct.}} for a price of \u00a3860.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|pp=162\u2013163}}  It was noted as being involved in a collision with at [[Parkside railway station (Merseyside)|Parkside]] on 11 November 1934 with the consequence that a labourer was crushed between wagons of the stationary between the wagons of the stationary luggage train.{{efn|Freight or goods trains were termed luggage trains in this period.}} The labourer was later to die of his injuries and the \"occasional engineman\" charge of ''Swiftsure'' was held responsible for entering a watering stop at more than {{Convert|6|mph|kph}} and was sanctioned by losing his turn on the promotion list.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|pp=210}}  ''Swiftsure'' was involved in a further incident in July 1835 whilst descending the incline at [[Whiston, Merseyside]] when a train of five [[silk]] wagons caught fire; the train took several hundred yards to stop and some wagons were only detached with difficulty.  The L&MR was ultimately advised to pay \u00a33,000 damages for the high value load on the basis they had not adequately displayed notices that the owners should have insured it.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|p=206}} ''Swiftsure'' was involved in several experiments during its service life. In November 1836 the L&MR performed a coal burning trial involving ''Swiftsure'' and several other locomotives, the results being generally unsuccessful with ''Swiftsure''{{'}}s firebox damaged by excessive heat.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|pp=175\u2013176}} Locomotives at this period were forced to use the more expensive and sometimes problematic coke in order to fulfill the requirement to \"consume their own smoke\"; it took several years for the technology to use coal successfully in locomotives to evolve.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1980|p=175}}\n\n===Dublin and Kingstown===\nThe Forresters' locomotives for the D&KR became known as ''Vauxhall'', ''Dublin'' and ''Kingstown''; the names representing the location of manufacture and the termini of the line.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe first of the D&KR locomotives{{efn|It would probably be reasonably assumed this was ''Vauxhall'' but it is not named as such in the source.}} ran sufficiently well on tests on the L&MR that it was permitted by their superintendent Manchester to take charge of the first class train to Liverpool on 27 June 1834. The journey was completed in 1h 17m with several D&KR people on board including [[James Pim|Pim (Junior)]], [[Thomas Flemming Bergin]], Vignoles and other directors.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=177}}\n\n''Vauxhall'' along with ''Hibernia'' were transported to Dublin on the same sailing before being hauled though the streets on temporary tracks.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=177}}  There is a legend ''Vauxhall'' was the first locomotive to reach the D&KR's [[Permanent way|tracks]].{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe first recorded service of the invited members of the public being transported was a special preview trip to Martello Tower and Booterstown by ''Vauxhall'' on 4 October 1834.  The honour of the first trial run over the entire length of the line fell to Forresters Hibernia on 9 October 1834 with ''Vauxhall'' doing a trip later in the day.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe honour of the first scheduled train in Ireland fell to Sharp's locomotive ''Hibernia'' at 09:00 17 December 1834; this being the famously celebrated inaugural run.  While Forrester's ''Vauxhall'' ran the next service and both continued running trips throughout the day.  The D&KR commenced its full scheduled service in January 1835.\n\nMaintenance of the class was at the Serpentine Road [[Grand Canal Street railway works|\"engine hospital\"]] with one section reserved for Forrester locomotives with their man [[Alexander Allan (locomotive engineer)|Alexander Allan]] on site for one year per the purchase contract.{{Sfnp|Murray|1981|p=177}}\n\nMost (all) were rebuilt to {{Whyte|2-2-0}} tank engines to match the later Comet Class.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===London and Greenwich===\nThe [[London and Greenwich Railway]] began a public service on the {{Convert|2+1/2|mi|km}} section between {{rws|Spa Road}} and {{rws|Deptford}} in February 1836.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1986|p=50}} Locomotives in use at this point were two [[Planet (locomotive)|''Planet'']] type of the {{Whyte|2-2-0}} configuration. ''Royal William'' was supplied by William Marshall & Sons.{{efn|{{harv|Thomas|1986}} locates Marshall & Sons at Tipton while {{harv|Lowe|2014|pp=458\u2013459}} indicates [[Gravesend]].}} Lowe also finds alternative sources indicating No. 1 was supplied by [[Charles Tayleur and Company]] which had links to Stephenson and this was as a set of parts and assembled on site.  That source also indicates Marshalls were previously Braithwaites until 1839,{{harv|Whishaw|1842|loc=p=xii(n552)}} and ''Venus'' supplied by the L&MR possibly as a hire to replaced an esoteric {{Whyte|0-2-0}} rotary steam engine supplied by [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Earl Dundonald]].  ''Victoria'' from Forresters became the third operational engine in May 1836 for the sum of \u00a31010 10s 0d.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1986|pp=176\u2212177}} The L&GR had initially ordered locomotives from [[Robert Stephenson and Company|Stephenson's]] and [[Edward Bury and Company|Burys]] however neither actually supplied.{{efn|{{harv|Lowe|2014|pp=458\u2013459}} says Bury subcontracted to Forrester (both factories were in the Liverpool docks area) while Stephenson had links to Charles Tayleur.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}}}  Forrester's second engine ''Walter''{{efn|Forrester's had named the locomotive ''William'' but the L&GR renamed it ''Walter'' to avoid a clash, presumably after their director George Walter.}} arrived in December 1836 in time for the extension to [[London Bridge station]], becoming the sixth operational engine, ''Royal William'' having acquired three sister locomotives in the interim.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1986|pp=176\u2212177}}  ''Victoria'' and ''Walter'' with their {{Whyte|2-2-0|WT}} configuration and acquired the nickname \"Boxers\" for the typical yawing motion of type.  Trials in 1837 revealed that ''Walter'' was more powerful than ''Royal William''. Both were converted to tender locomotives, possibly in an effort to reduce the yawing.  They were painted green, acquiring the numbers five and six respectively and possibly losing their names from the 1840s.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n''Victoria'' had a trailing axle added in 1841 to become a {{Whyte|2-2-0}}, before becoming a pumping engine at [[Bricklayers Arms railway yard|Bricklayers Arms]] from December 1845 and was finally acquired by C. Tomkins at [[Reading]] for scrap for \u00a3110.  ''Walter'' was never fitted with a trailing axle.  It saw service at [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]] repair shops from January 1846 followed by an assignment to the [[Gomshall]] sandpits from 1853 until it was scrapped along with ''Victoria''.{{Sfnp|Thomas|1986|p=191}}\n\n===Birmingham and Gloucester===\nThe The [[Birmingham and Gloucester Railway]] possessed four Forrester {{Whyte|2-2-2}}s:{{Sfnp|Various|1842|p=202}} ''the Cheltenham'', ''the Worcester'', ''the Bromsgrove'' and ''the Cheltenham''.{{Sfnp|Whisham|1842|p=30}}  These appear to be tender locomotive given the company had 15 tenders for 15 locomotives at one point.{{Sfnp|Whisham|1982|pp=30\u201331}}\n\n===Other railways===\nParliamentary papers published in 1842 seem to yield examples of other railways using {{Whyte|2-2-0}} and {{Whyte|2-2-2}} Forrester engines.{{Sfnp|Various|1841}}  The [[Preston and Wyre Joint Railway|Preston and Wyre Railway]] (P&WR) had a Forrester {{Whyte|2-2-0}} it sued for light goods, ballasting work, and occasional special passenger trains.  Its other engine was a {{Whyte|2-2-2}} goods and its passenger services were generally worked by another railway.  The P&WR was aware their six wheeled locomotive seemed to cause far less track wear than several other four wheel locomotives used on the railway, but that there 4 wheel Forrester could negotiate some curves the six wheel could not.{{Sfnp|Various|1842|pp=219\u2013220}}{{efn|The P&WR included docks where sharp curves might be found.}}  The [[Grand Junction Railway]] had between one and three Forrester engines {{Whyte|2-2-2}} engines based on the information they had three locomotives with outside cylinders with one different to the other two.{{Sfnp|Various|1842|pp=211\u2013212}}  The [[Manchester and Bolton Railway#Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal Company|Manchester, Bolton & Bury Canal Navigation and Railway]] (MB&CNR) had two Forrester {{Whyte|2-2-0}}s and eight {{Whyte|0-4-0}}s from [[Edward Bury]] and [[Fairnburn]] with a preference to go for Bury's engine if more were needed.{{sfnp|Various|1842|pp=205-206}}\n\n==Legacy==\nThe class was to form the basis for the locomotives produced for the D&KR excepting the three from Sharpes and ''Star'' from Dodds.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}  The locomotives [[Alexander Allan (locomotive engineer)|Alexander Allan]] went on design for the [[Grand Junction Railway]] and [[London and North Western Railway]] (including the [[Crewe type (locomotive)]]) showed influences from Forrester practice.{{Sfnp|Lowe|2014|p=177}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|ref=}}\n{{Refbegin}}\n* {{cite letter|last=Bergin|first1=T.

The points earned in the opening series determine which division a team will be sorted for the continuation of the season.\n\n'''Divisional series'''\n\nIn the divisional series, the teams are grouped into two divisions of six teams. Each division is played as a double round-robin, each team plays a total of ten games. The top six ranked teams in the preliminary series qualify for the Upper Division ({{Lang-fi|Ylempi jatkosarja}}). Upper Division teams are guaranteed placement in the playoffs; the points earned in the ten divisional series games are added to the points totals from the preliminary series and used to establish the teams' [[playoff berth]]s, from first to sixth.\n\nThe bottom four teams in the opening series move on to the Lower Division ({{Lang-fi|Alempi jatkosarja}}), where they are joined by the top two teams from the Cross-Qualifiers ({{Lang-fi|Ristiinkarsinta}}) of the Naisten Mestis, the league directly below Naisten Liiga. The Lower Division teams compete for the seventh and eighth [[Seed (sports)|seed]] positions in the playoffs; only the top two ranked teams from the Lower Division earn places in the playoffs. Unlike the in Upper Division, all Lower Division teams start the divisional series with zero points, only points earned in the series are considered when the teams are ranked.  \n\n'''Qualifying series'''\n\nThe Lower Division teams ranked third through sixth continue on to the qualifying series ({{Lang-fi|Karsintasarja}}). The points earned in the six qualifying series games are added to the points totals from the Lower Division divisional series. The two teams with the highest point totals qualify for the 2020\u201321 Naisten Liiga season, the two lower ranked teams are relegated to the Naisten Mestis for the following season.\n\n== Teams ==\n\n{{Location map+ |Finland |width=265 |caption=Location of teams in '''Naisten Liiga 2019\u201320''' |places=\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat= 62.591667 |long=23.616667 |label=[[Alavuden Peli-Veikot|APV]] |position=left}}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat=60.189167 |long=24.922222 |label=[[HIFK (women's ice hockey)|HIFK]] }}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat=60.995 |long=24.431944 |label=[[HPK Kiekkonaiset|HPK]]}}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat=61.495833 |long=23.824167 |label=[[Ilves Naiset|Ilves]] |position=top}}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat=62.895278 |long=27.666111 |label=[[KalPa Naiset|KalPa]] }}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat= 60.175556 |long= 24.8025 |label=[[Kiekko-Espoo|K-Espoo]]|position=bottom }}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat=65.008333 |long=25.495    |label=[[Oulun K\u00e4rp\u00e4t Naiset|K\u00e4rp\u00e4t]]}}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat=61.120556 |long=21.503056 |label=[[Lukko Naiset|Lukko]] |position=left}}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat=66.5 |long= 25.733333 |label=[[RoKi Naiset|RoKi]]|position=}}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat=63.079722 |long=21.641667 |label=[[Vaasan Sport Naiset|Sport]]|position=top}}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat= 62.808333 |long=23.508333 |label=[[Team Kuortane|Kuortane]]}}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat=60.456389 |long=22.186944 |label=[[TPS Naiset|TPS]] |position=left}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"\" 85%\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n|'''Team name'''\n|'''Full team name'''\n|'''Location'''\n|'''Head coach'''\n|'''Home venue'''\n|'''Captain'''\n|-\n|[[Stadin Gimmat|'''HIFK''']]\n| ''Stadin Gimmat'' or ''HIFK Naiset''\n|[[File:Helsinki.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Helsinki]]\n|[[Saara Niemi]]\n|Malmin j\u00e4\u00e4halli\n|[[Karoliina Rantam\u00e4ki]]\n|-\n|[[HPK Kiekkonaiset|'''HPK''']]\n|''H\u00e4meenlinnan Pallokerho Kiekkonaiset''\n|[[File:H\u00e4meenlinna.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[H\u00e4meenlinna]]\n|[[Katja Pasanen]]\n|Metritriski Areena\n|[[Riikka Noronen]]\n|-\n|[[Ilves Naiset|'''Ilves''']]\n|''Tampereen Ilves Naiset''\n|[[File:Tampere.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Tampere]]\n|[[Ville Tolvanen]]\n|Tesoman j\u00e4\u00e4halli\n|[[Johanna Juutilainen]]\n|-\n|[[KalPa Naiset|'''KalPa''']]\n|''Kalevan Pallo Naiset''\n|[[File:Kuopio.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Kuopio]]\n|[[Marjo Voutilainen]]\n|Olvi Areena\n|[[Emma Ritari]]\n|-\n|'''[[Kiekko-Espoo]]'''\n|''Kiekko-Espoo Naiset''\n|[[File:Espoo.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Espoo]]\n|[[Sami Haapanen]]\n|Tapiolan harjoitussaree\n|[[Minttu Tuominen]]\n|-\n|[[K\u00e4rp\u00e4t Naiset|'''K\u00e4rp\u00e4t''']]\n|''Oulun K\u00e4rp\u00e4t Naiset''\n|[[File:Oulu.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Oulu]]\n|[[Janne Salmela]]\n|Oulun Energia Areena\n|[[Saila Saari]]\n|-\n|[[Lukko Naiset|'''Lukko''']]\n|''Rauman Lukko Naiset''\n|[[File:Rauma.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]]\n|[[Marko Toivonen]]\n|Kivikyl\u00e4n Areena\n|[[Maija Koski]]\n|-\n|[[Vaasan Sport Naiset|'''Sport''']]\n|''Vaasan Sport Naiset''\n|[[File:Vaasa.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Vaasa]]\n|[[Marko Haapala]]\n|Vaasan S\u00e4hk\u00f6 Areena\n|[[Elina Ojala]]\n|-\n|'''[[Team Kuortane]]'''\n|''Team Kuortane''\n|[[File:Kuortane.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Kuortane]]\n|[[Mira Kuisma]]\n|Kuortaneen j\u00e4\u00e4halli\n|[[Emilia Vesa]]\n|-\n|[[TPS Naiset|'''TPS''']]\n|''Turun Palloseura Naiset''\n|[[File:Turku.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Turku]]\n|[[Matti T\u00e4hk\u00e4p\u00e4\u00e4]]\n|Marli Areena\n|[[Minni Lehtopelto]]\n|-\n|}\n\n'''Teams promoted from the [[Naisten Mestis]] to the Lower Division'''\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"\" 85%\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n|'''Team name'''\n|'''Full team name'''\n|'''Location'''\n|'''Head coach'''\n|'''Home venue'''\n|'''Captain'''\n|-\n|[[Alavuden Peli-Veikot|'''APV''']]\n|''Alavuden Peli-Veikot Naiset''\n|[[File:T\u00f6ys\u00e4.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Alavus]]\n|[[Noora M\u00e4kiranta]]\n|Alavus Areena\n|[[Pirjetta Turunen]]\n|-\n| [[RoKi Naiset|'''RoKi''']]\n|''Rovaniemen Kiekko Naiset''\n|[[file:Rovaniemi.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Rovaniemi]]\n|[[Tuomas Liitola]]\n|[[Lappi Areena]]\n|[[Ella Lahtela]]\n|-\n|}\n\n== Regular season ==\n=== Preliminaries ===\nSeries was played from 7 September to 24 November 2019.

[[Naisten Liiga (ice hockey)|Naisten Liiga]], the premier level of women's [[ice hockey]] in [[Finland]], since the league\u2019s establishment in 1982.\n\nThe season was cancelled by the [[Finnish Ice Hockey Association]] on 12 March 2020 in response to concerns about the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19 pandemic]]. The Aurora Borealis Cup final series between Kiekko-Espoo and KalPa was scheduled to begin on 14 March 2020,, making the 2019\u20132020 season the only Naisten Liiga season in which the Finnish Championship was not awarded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leijonat.fi/index.php/uutiset/jaakiekkoliitto/item/37699-koronavirus-lopettaa-jaakiekkoliiton-alaisten-sarjojen-kauden-myos-alle-16-ja-17-vuotiaiden-kotimaan-maaottelut-peruttu|title=Koronavirus lopettaa J\u00e4\u00e4kiekkoliiton alaisten sarjojen kauden|last=Mennander|first=Pasi|date=2020-03-12|website=leijonat.fi|publisher=[[Finnish Ice Hockey Association]]|language=fi-fi|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-16|Publish=}}</ref>\n\n== League changes ==\n=== Season format ===\nThe season format designated for the 2019\u201320 season was a modified version of the format established for the [[2018\u201319 Naisten Liiga season|2018\u201319 season]]. While the opening series remained unchanged, the divisional series was expanded to six teams in each division. In order to fill the two empty slots of the Lower Division, two teams from the [[Naisten Mestis]] were added to the Liiga for the divisional series and onward. The [[playoff format]] was modified to account for the increased number of teams; eight teams would qualify for the playoffs rather than the previous six. This change allowed for a traditional [[single-elimination tournament]] to be played from the [[Quarterfinal#Nomenclature|quarterfinal]] stage rather than having the top two teams automatically progress to the [[Semifinal#Nomenclature|semifinal]] round.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://finhockey.fi/index.php/joukkueelle/sarjatoiminta|title=Sarjatoiminta: Sarjojen pelaamistavat miehet, naiset ja A\u2013C nuoret: Kaavio Naisten Sarjat 19-20|last=|first=|date=June 2019|website=|publisher=[[Finnish Ice Hockey Association]]|language=fi-fi|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-21}}</ref>\n\n'''Preliminary series'''\n\nThe preliminary series ({{Lang-fi|Alkusarja}}) is played as a double [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin]] plus a two-game Opening Weekend Tournament; each of the ten teams plays a total of twenty matches. Points are awarded by match outcome, regulation wins earn three points, overtime wins earn 2 points, overtime losses earn 1 point, and no points are awarded for regulation losses. The points earned in the opening series determine which division a team will be sorted for the continuation of the season.\n\n'''Divisional series'''\n\nIn the divisional series, the teams are grouped into two divisions of six teams. Each division is played as a double round-robin, each team plays a total of ten games. The top six ranked teams in the preliminary series qualify for the Upper Division ({{Lang-fi|Ylempi jatkosarja}}). Upper Division teams are guaranteed placement in the playoffs; the points earned in the ten divisional series games are added to the points totals from the preliminary series and used to establish the teams' [[playoff berth]]s, from first to sixth.\n\nThe bottom four teams in the opening series move on to the Lower Division ({{Lang-fi|Alempi jatkosarja}}), where they are joined by the top two teams from the Cross-Qualifiers ({{Lang-fi|Ristiinkarsinta}}) of the Naisten Mestis, the league directly below Naisten Liiga. The Lower Division teams compete for the seventh and eighth [[Seed (sports)|seed]] positions in the playoffs; only the top two ranked teams from the Lower Division earn places in the playoffs. Unlike the in Upper Division, all Lower Division teams start the divisional series with zero points, only points earned in the series are considered when the teams are ranked.  \n\n'''Qualifying series'''\n\nThe Lower Division teams ranked third through sixth continue on to the qualifying series ({{Lang-fi|Karsintasarja}}). The points earned in the six qualifying series games are added to the points totals from the Lower Division divisional series. The two teams with the highest point totals qualify for the 2020\u201321 Naisten Liiga season, the two lower ranked teams are relegated to the Naisten Mestis for the following season.\n\n== Teams ==\n\n{{Location map+ |Finland |width=265 |caption=Location of teams in '''Naisten Liiga 2019\u201320''' |places=\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat= 62.591667 |long=23.616667 |label=[[Alavuden Peli-Veikot|APV]] |position=left}}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat=60.189167 |long=24.922222 |label=[[HIFK (women's ice hockey)|HIFK]] }}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat=60.995 |long=24.431944 |label=[[HPK Kiekkonaiset|HPK]]}}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat=61.495833 |long=23.824167 |label=[[Ilves Naiset|Ilves]] |position=top}}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat=62.895278 |long=27.666111 |label=[[KalPa Naiset|KalPa]] }}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat= 60.175556 |long= 24.8025 |label=[[Kiekko-Espoo|K-Espoo]]|position=bottom }}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat=65.008333 |long=25.495    |label=[[Oulun K\u00e4rp\u00e4t Naiset|K\u00e4rp\u00e4t]]}}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat=61.120556 |long=21.503056 |label=[[Lukko Naiset|Lukko]] |position=left}}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat=66.5 |long= 25.733333 |label=[[RoKi Naiset|RoKi]]|position=}}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat=63.079722 |long=21.641667 |label=[[Vaasan Sport Naiset|Sport]]|position=top}}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat= 62.808333 |long=23.508333 |label=[[Team Kuortane|Kuortane]]}}\n{{Location map~ |Finland |lat=60.456389 |long=22.186944 |label=[[TPS Naiset|TPS]] |position=left}}\n}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"\" 85%\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n|'''Team name'''\n|'''Full team name'''\n|'''Location'''\n|'''Head coach'''\n|'''Home venue'''\n|'''Captain'''\n|-\n|[[Stadin Gimmat|'''HIFK''']]\n| ''Stadin Gimmat'' or ''HIFK Naiset''\n|[[File:Helsinki.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Helsinki]]\n|[[Saara Niemi]]\n|Malmin j\u00e4\u00e4halli\n|[[Karoliina Rantam\u00e4ki]]\n|-\n|[[HPK Kiekkonaiset|'''HPK''']]\n|''H\u00e4meenlinnan Pallokerho Kiekkonaiset''\n|[[File:H\u00e4meenlinna.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[H\u00e4meenlinna]]\n|[[Katja Pasanen]]\n|Metritriski Areena\n|[[Riikka Noronen]]\n|-\n|[[Ilves Naiset|'''Ilves''']]\n|''Tampereen Ilves Naiset''\n|[[File:Tampere.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Tampere]]\n|[[Ville Tolvanen]]\n|Tesoman j\u00e4\u00e4halli\n|[[Johanna Juutilainen]]\n|-\n|[[KalPa Naiset|'''KalPa''']]\n|''Kalevan Pallo Naiset''\n|[[File:Kuopio.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Kuopio]]\n|[[Marjo Voutilainen]]\n|Olvi Areena\n|[[Emma Ritari]]\n|-\n|'''[[Kiekko-Espoo]]'''\n|''Kiekko-Espoo Naiset''\n|[[File:Espoo.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Espoo]]\n|[[Sami Haapanen]]\n|Tapiolan harjoitussaree\n|[[Minttu Tuominen]]\n|-\n|[[K\u00e4rp\u00e4t Naiset|'''K\u00e4rp\u00e4t''']]\n|''Oulun K\u00e4rp\u00e4t Naiset''\n|[[File:Oulu.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Oulu]]\n|[[Janne Salmela]]\n|Oulun Energia Areena\n|[[Saila Saari]]\n|-\n|[[Lukko Naiset|'''Lukko''']]\n|''Rauman Lukko Naiset''\n|[[File:Rauma.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Rauma, Finland|Rauma]]\n|[[Marko Toivonen]]\n|Kivikyl\u00e4n Areena\n|[[Maija Koski]]\n|-\n|[[Vaasan Sport Naiset|'''Sport''']]\n|''Vaasan Sport Naiset''\n|[[File:Vaasa.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Vaasa]]\n|[[Marko Haapala]]\n|Vaasan S\u00e4hk\u00f6 Areena\n|[[Elina Ojala]]\n|-\n|'''[[Team Kuortane]]'''\n|''Team Kuortane''\n|[[File:Kuortane.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Kuortane]]\n|[[Mira Kuisma]]\n|Kuortaneen j\u00e4\u00e4halli\n|[[Emilia Vesa]]\n|-\n|[[TPS Naiset|'''TPS''']]\n|''Turun Palloseura Naiset''\n|[[File:Turku.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Turku]]\n|[[Matti T\u00e4hk\u00e4p\u00e4\u00e4]]\n|Marli Areena\n|[[Minni Lehtopelto]]\n|-\n|}\n\n'''Teams promoted from the [[Naisten Mestis]] to the Lower Division'''\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"\" 85%\"\n|- style=\"background:#efefef;\"\n|'''Team name'''\n|'''Full team name'''\n|'''Location'''\n|'''Head coach'''\n|'''Home venue'''\n|'''Captain'''\n|-\n|[[Alavuden Peli-Veikot|'''APV''']]\n|''Alavuden Peli-Veikot Naiset''\n|[[File:T\u00f6ys\u00e4.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Alavus]]\n|[[Noora M\u00e4kiranta]]\n|Alavus Areena\n|[[Pirjetta Turunen]]\n|-\n| [[RoKi Naiset|'''RoKi''']]\n|''Rovaniemen Kiekko Naiset''\n|[[file:Rovaniemi.vaakuna.svg|20px]] [[Rovaniemi]]\n|[[Tuomas Liitola]]\n|[[Lappi Areena]]\n|[[Ella Lahtela]]\n|-\n|}\n\n== Regular season ==\n=== Preliminaries ===\nSeries was played from 7 September to 24 November 2019.
