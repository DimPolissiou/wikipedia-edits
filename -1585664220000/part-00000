retired professional [[association football|footballer]] who played as [[Striker]].\n\n==Club career==\n===Early career===\nBerg started to play for a local club [[Torsby IF]] in 2002. After that, he moved to [[IFK Velen]] in 2003.\n\n===IFK G\u00f6teborg===\nAfter spending two years in the youth team, during the 2005 season Berg was promoted to the regular squad and played for [[IFK G\u00f6teborg]] in the [[Allsvenskan]]. During the time playing for IFK G\u00f6teborg, he played alongside his older brother [[Jonatan Berg|Jonatan]].\n\nBerg played for IFK G\u00f6teborg until the 2007 summer and put forth an attracting performance throughout his final season, as he maintained a high scoring efficiency throughout the league matches. G\u00f6teborg won the league that season and Berg received a standing ovation upon leaving the field after the 5\u20130 away victory over [[Kalmar FF]] where Berg scored, which was his last for the club because of his suspension for the game against [[Djurg\u00e5rdens IF Fotboll|Djurg\u00e5rdens IF]]\n\nAmong dedicated IFK G\u00f6teborg supporters, Berg is known as ''Svarte-Marcus'' (\"Black Marcus\") due to his many goals in the G\u00f6teborg youth and reserve teams, and later also senior team. The nickname is an homage to the legendary IFK G\u00f6teborg striker [[Filip Johansson|Filip ''\"Svarte-Filip\"'' Johansson]].<ref>http://matsolasfanclub.blogg.se/2006/january/liten-ordlista-for-ifk-goteborgsupportrar.html</ref>\n\n===Groningen===\nOn 10 August 2007, Dutch club [[FC Groningen]] signed Berg for a reported [[Pound sterling|\u00a3]]2.5&nbsp;million<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sportinglife.com/football/overseas/holland/news/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=international_feed/07/08/11/SOCCER_Ned-FC_Groningen.html | title = Groningen Swoop for Berg | publisher = sportinglife.com | accessdate = 9 February 2010}}</ref> to replace the departing [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]-bound [[Luis Su\u00e1rez]].\n\nBerg had a good debut season in the Netherlands.

The city was founded and supported by the railroad, and the success of cotton production attracted significant wealth and prosperity to the community in the early 20th century. Despite the onslaught of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], the city continued to be economically viable well into the mid-20th century by its traditional means. Today, the community now serves as a manufacturing hub, a tourist destination, and a [[bedroom community]] serving the greater Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Metroplex.\n\nThe area that would later become the city of Ennis was first inhabited by the [[Tonkawa]] Native Americans. The area was also the hunting grounds of several Native American tribes including the [[Waco people|Waco]], [[Bidai]], [[Anadarko people|Anadarko]], and [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] tribes. These tribes frequented the area until Anglo pioneers arrived in the early-to-mid 19th century. When Ellis County was established and organized in 1850, much of the area was sparsely inhabited by isolated farmsteads as the nearby city of Dallas was in its infancy at the time. However, communities such as [[Ovilla, Texas|Ovilla]], Waxahachie, and Burnham would have been settled and founded prior to the establishment of the city of Ennis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hce04|title=ELLIS COUNTY|last=J.|first=HAASER, ROBERT|date=2010-06-12|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 1871 the [[Houston and Central Texas Railroad]] (H&TC) arrived at the spot that would become Ennis as it built north towards Dallas. The city was surveyed a year later and named after Cornelius Ennis, a founder of the H&TC Railroad who also served as [[Mayor of Houston]] (1856\u201357) and director of the [[Houston Tap and Brazoria Railway]].<ref name=\"ennishistoricalsociety.org\">[http://ennishistoricalsociety.org/ Ennis Historical Society]. Ennis Historical Society. Retrieved on May 22, 2015.</ref>\n\nBetween 1874 and 1890, the population of Ennis grew tenfold from approximately 300 to 3,000. Many of the new settlers came from the war-torn [[Confederate States of America]] and others came from the war-ravaged European nations that later became [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=\"ennishistoricalsociety.org\" /> This early growth was attributed to the success of cotton production in the region, making Ennis a center of trade and commerce for both farmers and the railroad. The influx of Czech migrants would also shape and transform the cultural heritage of the community for years to come.\n\nIn 1891, the H&TC chose Ennis to be its northern division headquarters. The machine shops and roundhouse employed several hundred men. One condition of the agreement was that as long as Ennis was able to furnish water the shops could not be moved from the community. The city built the first of three lakes for this purpose: Old City Lake in 1892, followed by New Lake in 1895, and Lake Clark (an extension of New Lake) in 1940.<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\">[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hje11 ENNIS, TX | The Handbook of Texas Online| Texas State Historical Association (TSHA)]. Tshaonline.org (June 12, 2010). Retrieved on 2015-05-22.</ref> However H&TC would later be acquired by the [[Texas and New Orleans Railroad]] (T&NO), a subsidiary of [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]], in 1934. While it no longer hosted the company headquarters, the shops and yard in Ennis would remain and continue to be used as a hub for other lines and branches serving the city.\n\nOn July 14, 1902, the [[Corsicana, Texas|Corsicana]] Oil Citys of the [[Texas League]] moved that day's game against Texarkana to Ennis, due to [[Sunday blue laws]] in Coriscana. Future major-leaguer [[Nig Clarke]] set an all-time record by hitting eight home runs in ten at bats in a 51\u20133 victory. (Clarke was helped mightily by the fact that Ennis' tiny ballpark featured a right field fence only about 210 feet from home plate.)<ref>[http://www.milb.com/milb/history/top100.jsp?idx=51 1902 Corsicana Oil Citys]</ref>\n\nThe expansion of the cotton industry supplemented by the railroad provided access to foreign and domestic markets through the port of Houston. By 1920, a total of 152,601 bales of cotton were ginned and shipped from Ellis County, the most of any county in America. The Ennis Chamber of Commerce adopted the slogan 'Where Railroads and Cotton Fields Meet.\" These two industries - trade and cotton production - produced immense wealth for the community that could be seen in the residential development of the city. Lawyers, doctors, businessmen, and other wealthy residents built churches of many different denominations and numerous fraternal organizations met regularly. Elegant houses along \u201cthe Avenue\u201d and north were accompanied by dozens of [[Folk Victorian]] houses and [[Craftsman style]] bungalows.<ref name=\"ennishistoricalsociety.org\" /> These Victorian houses and Craftsman bungalows in the northwestern part of the city would eventually become a part of the Templeton-McCanless Residential Historic District.\n\nBy the mid-20th century Ennis had become a modern community with schools, three movie theaters, several drugstores, banks and automobile dealerships. The sons and daughters of early settlers had developed new traditions like the [[National Polka Festival]] and the Ennis Bluebonnet Trail. Moreover, the city was connected to [[Dallas]] to the north and [[Houston]] to the South by Interstate Highway 45. Since then, citizens of Ennis have been able to experience the best of two worlds, participation in the attractions of a large, dynamic city and the familiar street-scape of a unique, nurturing community.<ref name=\"ennishistoricalsociety.org\"/>\n\nThe commercial strip along Ennis Ave. between Downtown and Interstate 45 was hit by an [[EF1]] tornado in the [[tornado outbreak of May 15\u201317, 2013]], rendering four homes uninhabitable and damaging as many as 55 businesses. The damage caused by the tornado impacted the [[National Register Historic District]] and many other businesses in town, with some of the historic downtown buildings facing demolition. However, the demolition of these historic buildings were opposed by local community leaders and activists. As a result, these damaged buildings were sold by the city to developers with the intention of repairing the buildings and revitalizing the neglected Downtown Historical District. These revitalization plans were implemented in the Downtown Comprehensive Plan, and the city was re-admitted to the Texas Main Street Program in January 2015. Today, almost all of the buildings pending demolition have since been rebuilt and renovated, and revitalization efforts have encouraged the startup of new businesses and festivals in the historic district.\n\n===Railroads in Ennis===\nThroughout the city's history, railroads have been instrumental in the community's early economic boom and supplemented the city's growth for over a century. Three railroads initially laid tracks and operated to and from Ennis - the Houston and Texas Central running north to south-east, the [[Texas Midland Railroad]] spurring to the northeast, and the Waxahachie Tap Railroad - later known as the Central Texas and Northwestern Railroad (CT&N) - coming in from the northwest. The CT&N was merged into the H&TC by the early 1900s and both remaining railroads serving the city would be merged into the [[Texas and New Orleans Railroad]] in 1934, eventually merging into its parent company [[Southern Pacific Railway]] by 1961. In 1996, Southern Pacific would merge into [[Union Pacific Railroad]] which is now serves as the sole rail operator in the city, maintaining a yard and local base of operations for the Ennis Subdivision.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:2015.20 Album 2 (43) (18895788616) (cropped).jpg|thumb|\"Hotel and Station at Ennis, Texas\", circa 1917.

Not only was the community strategically located in the middle of the Blackland Prairie, but it was located along the proposed H&TC line from Houston to Dallas - the first rail connection between both cities. However, the railroad's decision to establish Ennis meant that the nearby town of Burnham - located five miles south near the present-day community of Ensign - would be bypassed. The issue of this decision presented itself when many businesses in Burnham were attracted to the railroad and relocated to Ennis. As a result, a mob of angry residents reacted violently to the railroad's bypass and attacked citizens in the city of Ennis, killing one and injuring several others. Burnham, an otherwise well-planned and relatively developed city, would eventually decline and become a ghost town in the coming decades.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hrb89|title=BURNHAM, TX|last=C.|first=MAXWELL, LISA|date=2010-06-12|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 1870 - as the H&TC was laying track in Ellis County - residents of the neighboring city of [[Waxahachie, Texas|Waxahachie]] refused to give bonds to the railroad and resisted the development of a rail link to the system. After the railroad brought significant growth to Ennis and the decline of the bypassed community of Burnham took hold, attitudes changes as opportunistic businessmen and lawmakers chartered the Waxahachie Tap Railroad to link Waxahachie to the H&TC in an effort to reap some of the economic benefits. Construction was completed in 1879, establishing a 13-mile connection across Ellis County between both cities. In 1881, the railroad would be reorganized into the Central Texas and Northwestern Railway and secured state legislation permitting the railroad to build out west into the [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]], but no further construction would be made on the railroad. Eventually, the CT&N was merged into the H&TC in 1901.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/eqw07|title=Waxahachie Tap Railroad|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 1882, the H&TC began construction on a spur line which would span over 100 miles from Ennis to the city of [[Paris, Texas]], linking a southern terminus of the [[St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad]]. This would bypass the city of Dallas and provide a direct link from [[St. Louis, Missouri]] to the port cities of Houston and [[Galveston]]. However, in 1885 - just three years into construction - the H&TC went into receivership after only building half of the line, stopping just south of the city of [[Quinlan, Texas|Quinlan]]. In 1892, the [[Texas Midland Railroad]] was chartered by businesswoman [[Hetty Green]] who would purchase the northeastern spur from the H&TC. The link between the cities of Ennis and Paris would finally be made 13 years later after the initial proposal of the route when construction was completed in 1895 under the direction of Hetty Green's son.\n\nAfter a decade of operation, the Texas Midland was bought out by parties interested in a link and partnership between the Frisco Line and [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad|Rock Island Line]]. Plans were announced to build a line 65 miles south from Ennis to [[Waco, Texas|Waco]] to connect with the recently established [[Burlington-Rock Island Railroad]], a joint venture of the Rock Island Line and [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Burlington Route]]. There was significant potential of Ennis becoming a major railroad hub and junction, which could have significantly boosted its already booming development. However, this southern extension would never come to fruition and the Texas Midland would eventually be bought out and annexed by Southern Pacific in 1928, which leased the line to its subsidiary Texas and New Orleans Railroad. In 1934, the T&NO would fully acquire both the Texas Midland and the Houston and Texas Central, dissolving both companies in a merger to consolidate the H&TC line into the Southern Pacific system and fully abandon the Texas Midland Route. While Ennis would continue to see T&NO service to Dallas and Houston, the northeastern spur from Ennis to Paris would sit abandoned and go unused for almost a decade. A washout of the bridge spanning the Trinity River would lead to the official abandonment and decommissioning of the line between Ennis and Kaufman in 1942, with the line incrementally seeing full abandonment thirty years later in 1972.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abandonedrails.com/Texas_Midland_Railroad|title=The Texas Midland Railroad - Abandoned Rails|website=www.abandonedrails.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref> Today, segments of original Texas Midland track can be seen in areas along Breckenridge Street, which was formerly used in [[street-running]] operations for an industrial spur near downtown.\n\n[[File:Interurban Railway Museum October 2015 03 (Texas Electric Railway Car 360).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Texas Electric Railway Car on display at the [[Interurban Railway Museum]].]]\nThe city was also served by the [[Texas Electric Railway]], an extensive [[interurban]] railway network in North Texas that stretched over 200 miles in length at its peak.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestoryoftexas.com/discover/texas-story-project/interurban-railway-dallas|title=Texas Electric Railway's Interurban Service|website=www.thestoryoftexas.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref> The line historically ran through Ennis at street level along Dallas Street before running parallel to the T&NO tracks outside of the city center. From 1913 to 1941, Ennis was a stop along the Dallas-Corsicana Line, but the rise of the automobile, decline in ridership, and the economic strain of World War II led to the suspension of service and closure of the line. Like the Texas Midland's spur along Breckenridge Street, the interurban line ran along Dallas Street and was likewise paved over after service was suspended. However, these tracks were revealed and partially removed during street renovations in the late-2010s.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, the significance of the railroad began to decline in the city, as the postwar boom of the mid-century favored the automobile over the locomotive. Texas and New Orleans' [[Sunbeam]] and Hustler services were cut in 1955 and 1957 respectively, after serving the city since the T&NO's takeover of the H&TC. Passenger service would not return to Ennis, as attempts by [[Amtrak]] to restore service to the city were largely unsuccessful. Ten years after the T&NO's merger into Southern Pacific in 1961, Southern Pacific would initially resist attempts to route the [[Lone Star (Amtrak train)|Lone Star]] along the line through Ennis in the early 1970s. In 1989, a spur of the [[Texas Eagle]] - the successor of the Lone Star service - running from Dallas to Houston would run nonstop through the city during the alternate service's brief three-year stint in the early 1990s. Shortly after in 1996, Southern Pacific would merge into Union Pacific, who has since been the sole railroad operating in the city. Union Pacific would go on to commemorate the city's significant railroad history by honoring the legacy of its local yard workers - some of whom were fourth and fifth-generation railroaders - in awarding the city a membership to the company's Train Town USA registry in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uprr.com/newsinfo/releases/community/2013/train_town/0225_ennis.shtml|title=UP: Ennis, Texas, Awarded Membership in Union Pacific's Train Town USA Registry|website=uprr.com|language=en|access-date:2020-03-05</ref>\n\n===Templeton-McCanless Historic District===\n\nThe Templeton-McCanless Residential Historic District is named in honor of two notable figures instrumental in the early development of the city, one of whom - [[Hix McCanless]] - was the architect for several early homes built in Ennis from the late 19th century to early 20th century. Because of the city's economic boom and the general prosperity of the [[Gilded Age]] during this era, many of these early homes were built indulgently with ornate details and great levels of craftsmanship in adherence to the pre-modern architectural styles of the time - namely in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], [[American Craftsman]], and [[Folk Victorian]] styles. However, many of these original homes were lost to neglect, demolition, fire, and careless renovation during the 20th century, precipitating the need to preserve the locally historic significance of those remaining. The historic district was created in 1986 after five years of grassroots efforts from the Ennis Heritage Society (now the Ennis Historical Society) and is now an officially registered district in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] dedicated to the protection and preservation of these homes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ennishistoricalsociety.org/index.html|title=Ennis Historical Society|website=ennishistoricalsociety.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref> Today, dozens of homes are preserved in the styles and eclecticism which dominated pre-contemporary design, predominantly those prevalent at the turn of the century. Some of the homes have been named after the architect of the house or the family name of its first residents.

First held in 1967, this three-day festival has been hosted annually during the [[Memorial Day]] weekend to commemorate the city's historic [[Czech Texan]] history and heritage. The festival features [[Czech cuisine]], [[polka]] music, a Memorial Day parade through downtown, and [[polka]] dances hosted at event halls operated by fraternal organizations such as [[Sokol]] or the [[Knights of Columbus]]. There is also a homecoming-like competition among residents and these community-based fraternal organizations to annually crown the ''Duke and Dutchess of Ennis''. The Ennis Polka Run also takes place to help fund the Rotary Club and the Children's Reading Club of Ennis.\n\nThe second major festival hosted in Ennis is the Bluebonnet Trails Festival, celebrating the [[Bluebonnet (plant)|state flower of Texas]] and the vibrant bloom of wildflowers in the surrounding countryside. The event attracts tens of thousands of tourists each year to events including sightseeing excursions and a festival in downtown. The festival is held on the third weekend of April, and the Bluebonnet Trails are hosted for the entire month. First hosted along the Kachina Prairie Park's historic mile-long trail system in 1938, the Bluebonnet Trails have since expanded into a route map of several dozen miles along rural farm roads throughout the surrounding countryside east and northeast of the city. The routes for these sightseeing excursions have been officially hosted and mapped out by the Ennis Garden Club since 1951. To commemorate the popularity of the Bluebonnet Trails Festival and the efforts made to celebrate and preserve the state flower of Texas, Ennis was designated by the 1997 Texas State Legislature as the \"Official Bluebonnet City of Texas\" and home to the \"Official Bluebonnet Trail of Texas.\"\n\nSeveral other local events and festivals are hosted in the city throughout the year, mostly within the historic city center. The Unity One \"Blues on Main\" Summer Music Festival is a jazz and blues festival hosted in June; Ennis Freedom Fest is a parade and firework show hosted on the [[4th of July]]; the Fall Festival and Monster Mash Dash 5k Marathon are hosted in October; and the Lights of Ennis Festival, the Parade of Lights, and the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] Procession are hosted in December during the Christmas season.\n\n==Attractions==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Galaxy Drive-in movie Ennis, Texas.jpeg|The Galaxy Drive-in Theater.\nFile:USACE Bardwell Dam and Lake.jpg|[[United States Army Corps of Engineers|USACE]] Bardwell Dam and Lake\nFile:Texas Tourist Development Agency - Attractions, Activities, and Events 1991077 002 (18097084333).jpg|A Polkafest attendee in [[Czech traditional clothing|Czech folk costume]]\nFile:Ennis September 2017 31 (Texas Motorplex).jpg|Main Gate and Pressbox at the Texas Motorplex\n</gallery>\n\n'''[[Lake Bardwell]]''' is a reservoir managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers located 5 miles south of Ennis.

The city was founded and supported by the railroad, and the success of cotton production attracted significant wealth and prosperity to the community in the early 20th century. Despite the onslaught of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], the city continued to be economically viable well into the mid-20th century by its traditional means. Today, the community now serves as a manufacturing hub, a tourist destination, and a [[bedroom community]] serving the greater Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Metroplex.\n\nThe area that would later become the city of Ennis was first inhabited by the [[Tonkawa]] Native Americans. The area was also the hunting grounds of several Native American tribes including the [[Waco people|Waco]], [[Bidai]], [[Anadarko people|Anadarko]], and [[Kickapoo people|Kickapoo]] tribes. These tribes frequented the area until Anglo pioneers arrived in the early-to-mid 19th century. When Ellis County was established and organized in 1850, much of the area was sparsely inhabited by isolated farmsteads as the nearby city of Dallas was in its infancy at the time. However, communities such as [[Ovilla, Texas|Ovilla]], Waxahachie, and Burnham would have been settled and founded prior to the establishment of the city of Ennis.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hce04|title=ELLIS COUNTY|last=J.|first=HAASER, ROBERT|date=2010-06-12|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 1871 the [[Houston and Central Texas Railroad]] (H&TC) arrived at the spot that would become Ennis as it built north towards Dallas. The city was surveyed a year later and named after Cornelius Ennis, a founder of the H&TC Railroad who also served as [[Mayor of Houston]] (1856\u201357) and director of the [[Houston Tap and Brazoria Railway]].<ref name=\"ennishistoricalsociety.org\">[http://ennishistoricalsociety.org/ Ennis Historical Society]. Ennis Historical Society. Retrieved on May 22, 2015.</ref>\n\nBetween 1874 and 1890, the population of Ennis grew tenfold from approximately 300 to 3,000. Many of the new settlers came from the war-torn [[Confederate States of America]] and others came from the war-ravaged European nations that later became [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref name=\"ennishistoricalsociety.org\" /> This early growth was attributed to the success of cotton production in the region, making Ennis a center of trade and commerce for both farmers and the railroad. The influx of Czech migrants would also shape and transform the cultural heritage of the community for years to come.\n\nIn 1891, the H&TC chose Ennis to be its northern division headquarters. The machine shops and roundhouse employed several hundred men. One condition of the agreement was that as long as Ennis was able to furnish water the shops could not be moved from the community. The city built the first of three lakes for this purpose: Old City Lake in 1892, followed by New Lake in 1895, and Lake Clark (an extension of New Lake) in 1940.<ref name=\"tshaonline.org\">[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hje11 ENNIS, TX | The Handbook of Texas Online| Texas State Historical Association (TSHA)]. Tshaonline.org (June 12, 2010). Retrieved on 2015-05-22.</ref> However H&TC would later be acquired by the [[Texas and New Orleans Railroad]] (T&NO), a subsidiary of [[Southern Pacific Transportation Company|Southern Pacific]], in 1934. While it no longer hosted the company headquarters, the shops and yard in Ennis would remain and continue to be used as a hub for other lines and branches serving the city.\n\nOn July 14, 1902, the [[Corsicana, Texas|Corsicana]] Oil Citys of the [[Texas League]] moved that day's game against Texarkana to Ennis, due to [[Sunday blue laws]] in Coriscana. Future major-leaguer [[Nig Clarke]] set an all-time record by hitting eight home runs in ten at bats in a 51\u20133 victory. (Clarke was helped mightily by the fact that Ennis' tiny ballpark featured a right field fence only about 210 feet from home plate.)<ref>[http://www.milb.com/milb/history/top100.jsp?idx=51 1902 Corsicana Oil Citys]</ref>\n\nThe expansion of the cotton industry supplemented by the railroad provided access to foreign and domestic markets through the port of Houston. By 1920, a total of 152,601 bales of cotton were ginned and shipped from Ellis County, the most of any county in America. The Ennis Chamber of Commerce adopted the slogan 'Where Railroads and Cotton Fields Meet.\" These two industries - trade and cotton production - produced immense wealth for the community that could be seen in the residential development of the city. Lawyers, doctors, businessmen, and other wealthy residents built churches of many different denominations and numerous fraternal organizations met regularly. Elegant houses along \u201cthe Avenue\u201d and north were accompanied by dozens of [[Folk Victorian]] houses and [[Craftsman style]] bungalows.<ref name=\"ennishistoricalsociety.org\" /> These Victorian houses and Craftsman bungalows in the northwestern part of the city would eventually become a part of the Templeton-McCanless Residential Historic District.\n\nBy the mid-20th century Ennis had become a modern community with schools, three movie theaters, several drugstores, banks and automobile dealerships. The sons and daughters of early settlers had developed new traditions like the [[National Polka Festival]] and the Ennis Bluebonnet Trail. Moreover, the city was connected to [[Dallas]] to the north and [[Houston]] to the South by Interstate Highway 45. Since then, citizens of Ennis have been able to experience the best of two worlds, participation in the attractions of a large, dynamic city and the familiar street-scape of a unique, nurturing community.<ref name=\"ennishistoricalsociety.org\"/>\n\nThe commercial strip along Ennis Ave. between Downtown and Interstate 45 was hit by an [[EF1]] tornado in the [[tornado outbreak of May 15\u201317, 2013]], rendering four homes uninhabitable and damaging as many as 55 businesses. The damage caused by the tornado impacted the [[National Register Historic District]] and many other businesses in town, with some of the historic downtown buildings facing demolition. However, the demolition of these historic buildings were opposed by local community leaders and activists. As a result, these damaged buildings were sold by the city to developers with the intention of repairing the buildings and revitalizing the neglected Downtown Historical District. These revitalization plans were implemented in the Downtown Comprehensive Plan, and the city was re-admitted to the Texas Main Street Program in January 2015. Today, almost all of the buildings pending demolition have since been rebuilt and renovated, and revitalization efforts have encouraged the startup of new businesses and festivals in the historic district.\n\n===Railroads in Ennis===\nThroughout the city's history, railroads have been instrumental in the community's early economic boom and supplemented the city's growth for over a century. Three railroads initially laid tracks and operated to and from Ennis - the Houston and Texas Central running north to south-east, the [[Texas Midland Railroad]] spurring to the northeast, and the Waxahachie Tap Railroad - later known as the Central Texas and Northwestern Railroad (CT&N) - coming in from the northwest. The CT&N was merged into the H&TC by the early 1900s and both remaining railroads serving the city would be merged into the [[Texas and New Orleans Railroad]] in 1934, eventually merging into its parent company [[Southern Pacific Railway]] by 1961. In 1996, Southern Pacific would merge into [[Union Pacific Railroad]] which is now serves as the sole rail operator in the city, maintaining a yard and local base of operations for the Ennis Subdivision.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"150px\">\nFile:2015.20 Album 2 (43) (18895788616) (cropped).jpg|thumb|\"Hotel and Station at Ennis, Texas\", circa 1917.

Not only was the community strategically located in the middle of the Blackland Prairie, but it was located along the proposed H&TC line from Houston to Dallas - the first rail connection between both cities. However, the railroad's decision to establish Ennis meant that the nearby town of Burnham - located five miles south near the present-day community of Ensign - would be bypassed. The issue of this decision presented itself when many businesses in Burnham were attracted to the railroad and relocated to Ennis. As a result, a mob of angry residents reacted violently to the railroad's bypass and attacked citizens in the city of Ennis, killing one and injuring several others. Burnham, an otherwise well-planned and relatively developed city, would eventually decline and become a ghost town in the coming decades.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hrb89|title=BURNHAM, TX|last=C.|first=MAXWELL, LISA|date=2010-06-12|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 1870 - as the H&TC was laying track in Ellis County - residents of the neighboring city of [[Waxahachie, Texas|Waxahachie]] refused to give bonds to the railroad and resisted the development of a rail link to the system. After the railroad brought significant growth to Ennis and the decline of the bypassed community of Burnham took hold, attitudes changes as opportunistic businessmen and lawmakers chartered the Waxahachie Tap Railroad to link Waxahachie to the H&TC in an effort to reap some of the economic benefits. Construction was completed in 1879, establishing a 13-mile connection across Ellis County between both cities. In 1881, the railroad would be reorganized into the Central Texas and Northwestern Railway and secured state legislation permitting the railroad to build out west into the [[Texas Panhandle|Panhandle]], but no further construction would be made on the railroad. Eventually, the CT&N was merged into the H&TC in 1901.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/eqw07|title=Waxahachie Tap Railroad|website=tshaonline.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref>\n\nIn 1882, the H&TC began construction on a spur line which would span over 100 miles from Ennis to the city of [[Paris, Texas]], linking a southern terminus of the [[St. Louis and San Francisco Railroad]]. This would bypass the city of Dallas and provide a direct link from [[St. Louis, Missouri]] to the port cities of Houston and [[Galveston]]. However, in 1885 - just three years into construction - the H&TC went into receivership after only building half of the line, stopping just south of the city of [[Quinlan, Texas|Quinlan]]. In 1892, the [[Texas Midland Railroad]] was chartered by businesswoman [[Hetty Green]] who would purchase the northeastern spur from the H&TC. The link between the cities of Ennis and Paris would finally be made 13 years later after the initial proposal of the route when construction was completed in 1895 under the direction of Hetty Green's son.\n\nAfter a decade of operation, the Texas Midland was bought out by parties interested in a link and partnership between the Frisco Line and [[Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad|Rock Island Line]]. Plans were announced to build a line 65 miles south from Ennis to [[Waco, Texas|Waco]] to connect with the recently established [[Burlington-Rock Island Railroad]], a joint venture of the Rock Island Line and [[Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad|Burlington Route]]. There was significant potential of Ennis becoming a major railroad hub and junction, which could have significantly boosted its already booming development. However, this southern extension would never come to fruition and the Texas Midland would eventually be bought out and annexed by Southern Pacific in 1928, which leased the line to its subsidiary Texas and New Orleans Railroad. In 1934, the T&NO would fully acquire both the Texas Midland and the Houston and Texas Central, dissolving both companies in a merger to consolidate the H&TC line into the Southern Pacific system and fully abandon the Texas Midland Route. While Ennis would continue to see T&NO service to Dallas and Houston, the northeastern spur from Ennis to Paris would sit abandoned and go unused for almost a decade. A washout of the bridge spanning the Trinity River would lead to the official abandonment and decommissioning of the line between Ennis and Kaufman in 1942, with the line incrementally seeing full abandonment thirty years later in 1972.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abandonedrails.com/Texas_Midland_Railroad|title=The Texas Midland Railroad - Abandoned Rails|website=www.abandonedrails.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref> Today, segments of original Texas Midland track can be seen in areas along Breckenridge Street, which was formerly used in [[street-running]] operations for an industrial spur near downtown.\n\n[[File:Interurban Railway Museum October 2015 03 (Texas Electric Railway Car 360).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Texas Electric Railway Car on display at the [[Interurban Railway Museum]].]]\nThe city was also served by the [[Texas Electric Railway]], an extensive [[interurban]] railway network in North Texas that stretched over 200 miles in length at its peak.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestoryoftexas.com/discover/texas-story-project/interurban-railway-dallas|title=Texas Electric Railway's Interurban Service|website=www.thestoryoftexas.com|language=en|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref> The line historically ran through Ennis at street level along Dallas Street before running parallel to the T&NO tracks outside of the city center. From 1913 to 1941, Ennis was a stop along the Dallas-Corsicana Line, but the rise of the automobile, decline in ridership, and the economic strain of World War II led to the suspension of service and closure of the line. Like the Texas Midland's spur along Breckenridge Street, the interurban line ran along Dallas Street and was likewise paved over after service was suspended. However, these tracks were revealed and partially removed during street renovations in the late-2010's.\n\nBy the mid-20th century, the significance of the railroad began to decline in the city, as the postwar boom of the mid-century favored the automobile over the locomotive. Texas and New Orleans' [[Sunbeam]] and Hustler services were cut in 1955 and 1957 respectively, after serving the city since the T&NO's takeover of the H&TC. Passenger service would not return to Ennis, as attempts by [[Amtrak]] to restore service to the city were largely unsuccessful. Ten years after the T&NO's merger into Southern Pacific in 1961, Southern Pacific would initially resist attempts to route the [[Lone Star (Amtrak train)|Lone Star]] along the line through Ennis in the early 1970s. In 1989, a spur of the [[Texas Eagle]] - the successor of the Lone Star service - running from Dallas to Houston would run nonstop through the city during the alternate service's brief three-year stint in the early 1990s. Shortly after in 1996, Southern Pacific would merge into Union Pacific, who has since been the sole railroad operating in the city. Union Pacific would go on to commemorate the city's significant railroad history by honoring the legacy of its local yard workers - some of whom were fourth and fifth-generation railroaders - in awarding the city a membership to the company's Train Town USA registry in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uprr.com/newsinfo/releases/community/2013/train_town/0225_ennis.shtml|title=UP: Ennis, Texas, Awarded Membership in Union Pacific's Train Town USA Registry|website=uprr.com|language=en|access-date:2020-03-05</ref>\n\n===Templeton-McCanless Historic District===\n\nThe Templeton-McCanless Residential Historic District is named in honor of two notable figures instrumental in the early development of the city, one of whom - [[Hix McCanless]] - was the architect for several early homes built in Ennis from the late 19th century to early 20th century. Because of the city's economic boom and the general prosperity of the [[Gilded Age]] during this era, many of these early homes were built indulgently with ornate details and great levels of craftsmanship in adherence to the pre-modern architectural styles of the time - namely in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], [[American Craftsman]], and [[Folk Victorian]] styles. However, many of these original homes were lost to neglect, demolition, fire, and careless renovation during the 20th century, precipitating the need to preserve the locally historic significance of those remaining. The historic district was created in 1986 after five years of grassroots efforts from the Ennis Heritage Society (now the Ennis Historical Society) and is now an officially registered district in the [[National Register of Historic Places]] dedicated to the protection and preservation of these homes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ennishistoricalsociety.org/index.html|title=Ennis Historical Society|website=ennishistoricalsociety.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-05}}</ref> Today, dozens of homes are preserved in the styles and eclecticism which dominated pre-contemporary design, predominantly those prevalent at the turn of the century. Some of the homes have been named after the architect of the house or the family name of its first residents. A few examples can be seen in the gallery below.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"100px\">\nFile:Atwood-Burden House.JPG|E.K.

First held in 1967, this three-day festival has been hosted annually during the [[Memorial Day]] weekend to commemorate the city's historic [[Czech Texan]] history and heritage. The festival features [[Czech cuisine]], [[polka]] music, a Memorial Day parade through downtown, and [[polka]] dances hosted at event halls operated by fraternal organizations such as [[Sokol]] or the [[Knights of Columbus]]. There is also a homecoming-like competition among residents and these community-based fraternal organizations to annually crown the ''Duke and Dutchess of Ennis''. The Ennis Polka Run also takes place to help fund the Rotary Club and the Children's Reading Club of Ennis.\n\nThe second major festival hosted in Ennis is the Bluebonnet Trails Festival, celebrating the [[Bluebonnet (plant)|state flower of Texas]] and the vibrant bloom of wildflowers in the surrounding countryside. The event attracts tens of thousands of tourists each year to events including sightseeing excursions and a festival in downtown. The festival is held on the third weekend of April, and the Bluebonnet Trails are hosted for the entire month. First hosted along the Kachina Prairie Park's historic mile-long trail system in 1938, the Bluebonnet Trails have since expanded into a route map of several dozen miles along rural farm roads throughout the surrounding countryside east and northeast of the city. The routes for these sightseeing excursions have been officially hosted and mapped out by the Ennis Garden Club since 1951. To commemorate the popularity of the Bluebonnet Trails Festival and the efforts made to celebrate and preserve the state flower of Texas, Ennis was designated by the 1997 Texas State Legislature as the \"Official Bluebonnet City of Texas\" and home to the \"Official Bluebonnet Trail of Texas.\"\n\nSeveral other local events and festivals are hosted in the city throughout the year, mostly within the historic city center. The Unity One \"Blues on Main\" Summer Music Festival is a jazz and blues festival hosted in June; Ennis Freedom Fest is a parade and firework show hosted on the [[4th of July]]; the Fall Festival and Monster Mash Dash 5k Marathon are hosted in October; and the Lights of Ennis Festival, the Parade of Lights, and the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] Procession are hosted in December during the Christmas season.\n\n==Attractions==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Galaxy Drive-in movie Ennis, Texas.jpeg|The Galaxy Drive-in Theater.\nFile:USACE Bardwell Dam and Lake.jpg|[[United States Army Corps of Engineers|USACE]] Bardwell Dam and Lake\nFile:Texas Tourist Development Agency - Attractions, Activities, and Events 1991077 002 (18097084333).jpg|A Polkafest attendee in [[Czech traditional clothing|Czech folk costume]]\nFile:Ennis September 2017 31 (Texas Motorplex).jpg|Main Gate and Pressbox at the Texas Motorplex\n</gallery>\n\n'''[[Lake Bardwell]]''' is a reservoir managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers located 5 miles south of Ennis.

It annually hosts the NHRA O'Reilly Fall Nationals each September, when hundreds of professional and amateur drag racers compete for over $2 million in prize money.\n\nThe '''Ennis Railroad and Cultural Heritage Museum''' is housed in the former Van Noy restaurant building. The museum's collections include: railroad and cultural memorabilia including items related to the Houston and Central Texas Railroad; a large diorama of the old engine roundhouse that once existed just north of the museums location; a large collection of rare china; and a MKT caboose.\n\nThe '''Kachina Prairie''' is a city park preserving one of the last remaining examples of untouched [[Texas blackland prairie]]. The first Ennis bluebonnet trail was marked through this area in 1938.\n\n==In popular culture==\nScenes from the following movies were filmed in Ennis: ''[[Deadly Blessing]]'' (1981) starring [[Sharon Stone]]; ''On Valentine\u2019s Day'' (1986) starring [[Hallie Foote]] and [[Michael Higgins (actor)|Michael Higgins]]; and ''[[Walking Tall: The Payback]]'' (2007) with [[Kevin Sorbo]] and [[Haley Ramm]].<ref>[http://etypeservices.com/SWF/LocalUser/admin1891//Magazine83901/Full/index.aspx?II=83901 Ennis Daily News]{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.
