The slot corresponding to its uppercase form is occupied by the lowercase letter ''[[\u00df]]'' from the German language, which did not have an [[Capital \u1e9e|uppercase form]] at the time when the standard was created.\n\n=== Quotation marks ===\nFor some languages listed above, the correct typographical [[Quotation mark#Summary table|quotation marks]] are missing, as only {{code|\u00ab \u00bb}}, {{code|\" \"}}, and {{code|' '}} are included. Also, this scheme does not provide for oriented (6- or 9-shaped) single or double quotation marks. Some fonts will display the spacing grave accent (0x60) and the apostrophe (0x27) as a matching pair of oriented single quotation marks, but this is not considered part of the modern standard.\n\n== History ==\nISO 8859-1 was based on the [[Multinational Character Set]] used by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) in the popular [[VT220]] terminal in 1983. It was developed within the [[Ecma International|European Computer Manufacturers Association]] (ECMA), and published in March 1985 as ECMA-94,<ref name=\"ECMA_1985_ECMA94_R1\" /> by which name it is still sometimes known. The second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)<ref>[https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-094.pdf second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)]</ref> also included [[ISO/IEC 8859-2|ISO 8859-2]], [[ISO/IEC 8859-3|ISO 8859-3]], and [[ISO/IEC 8859-4|ISO 8859-4]] as part of the specification.\n\nThe original draft of ISO 8859-1 placed French ''\u0152'' and ''\u0153'' at code points 215 (0xD7) and 247 (0xF7), as in the ECMA-94. However, the delegate from France, being neither a linguist nor a typographer, falsely stated that these are not independent French letters on their own, but mere [[Orthographic ligature|ligatures]] (like ''\ufb01'' or ''\ufb02''), supported by the delegate team from [[Bull Publishing Company]], who regularly did not print French with ''\u0152/\u0153'' in their house style at the time. An anglophone delegate from Canada insisted in retaining ''\u0152/\u0153'' but was rebuffed by the French delegate and the team from Bull. These code points were soon filled with \u00d7 and \u00f7 under the suggestion of the German delegation. Then things went even worse for the French language, when it was again falsely stated that the letter ''\u00ff'' is \"not French\", resulting in the absence of the capital ''\u0178''. In fact, the letter ''\u00ff'' is found in a number of French proper names, and the capital letter has been used in dictionaries and encyclopedias.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacques|first=Andr\u00e9|title=ISO Latin-1, norme de codage des caract\u00e8res europ\u00e9ens?

|quote=[\u2026] Since 1982 the urgency of the need for an 8-bit single-byte coded character set was recognized in ECMA as well as in ANSI/X3L2 and numerous working papers were exchanged between the two groups. In February 1984 ECMA TC1 submitted to ISO/TC97/SC2 a proposal for such a coded character set. At its meeting of April 1984 SC decided to submit to TC97 a proposal for a new item of work for this topic. Technical discussions during and after this meeting led TC1 to adopt the coding scheme proposed by X3L2. Part 1 of Draft International Standard DTS 8859 is based on this joint ANSI/ECMA proposal. [\u2026] Adopted as an ECMA Standard by the General Assembly of Dec. 13\u201314, 1984. [\u2026] |df= }}</ref>}} In the original draft, however, \u0152 was at codepoint 215 (0xD7) and \u0153 was at codepoint 247 (0xF7).\n\n== Similar character sets ==\n{{Main|Western Latin character sets (computing)}}\n\n=== ISO/IEC 8859-15 ===\n[[ISO/IEC 8859-15]] was developed in 1999, as an update of ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. It provides some characters for French and Finnish text and the [[euro sign]], which are missing from ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. This required the removal of some infrequently used characters from ISO/IEC 8859-1, including fraction symbols and letter-free diacritics: {{code|\u00a4}}, {{code|\u00a6}}, {{code|\u00a8}}, {{code|\u00b4}}, {{code|\u00b8}}, {{code|\u00bc}}, {{code|\u00bd}}, and {{code|\u00be}}. Ironically, three of the newly added characters ({{code|\u0152}}, {{code|\u0153}}, and {{code|\u0178}}) had already been present in [[DEC (company)|DEC]]'s 1983 [[Multinational Character Set]] (MCS), the predecessor to ISO/IEC 8859-1 (1987). Since their original code points were now reused for other purposes, the characters had to be reintroduced under different, less logical code points.\n\nISO-IR-204, a more minor modification, had been registered in 1998, altering ISO-8859-1 by replacing the [[universal currency sign]] (\u00a4) with the euro sign<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1 |url=https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/iso-ir/204.pdf |title=ISO-IR 204: Supplementary set for Latin-1 alternative with EURO SIGN |author=ITS Information Technology Standardization |publisher=ITSCJ/[[Information Processing Society of Japan|IPSJ]] |date=1998-09-16}}</ref> (the same substitution made by ISO-8859-15).\n\n=== Windows-1252 ===\nThe popular [[Windows-1252]] character set adds all the missing characters provided by [[ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-15]], plus a number of typographic symbols, by replacing the rarely used C1 controls in the range 128 to 159 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] 80 to 9F). It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text as being in ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by \"smart quotes\" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Many web browsers and e-mail clients will interpret ISO-8859-1 control codes as Windows-1252 characters, and that behavior was later standardized in [[HTML5]].<ref>{{cite web |last=van Kesteren |first=Anne |url=https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |work=Encoding Standard |title=5.2 Names and labels |publisher=[[WHATWG]] |date=27 January 2015 |access-date=4 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204174315/https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |archive-date=4 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Mac Roman ===\nThe [[Apple Macintosh]] computer introduced a character encoding called [[Mac Roman]] in 1984. It was meant to be suitable for Western European [[desktop publishing]]. It is a superset of [[ASCII]], and has most of the characters that are in ISO-8859-1 and all the extra characters from Windows-1252 but in a totally different arrangement. The few printable characters that are in ISO 8859-1, but not in this set, are often a source of trouble when editing text on Web sites using older Macintosh browsers, including the last version of [[Internet Explorer for Mac]].\n\n=== Other ===\nDOS had [[code page 850]], which had all printable characters that ISO-8859-1 had (albeit in a totally different arrangement) plus the most widely used [[graphic character]]s from [[code page 437]].\n\nBetween 1989<ref name=\"HP82240B_1989\"/> and 2015,<!-- end of production of HP 50g, HP's last RPL calculator --> [[Hewlett-Packard]] used another superset of ISO-8859-1 on many of their calculators.

It is the basis for most popular 8-bit character sets and the first block of characters in [[Unicode]].\n\nISO-8859-1 was (according to the standards at least) the default encoding of documents delivered via [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] with a [[media type|MIME type]] beginning with \"text/\" ([[HTML5]] changed this to [[Windows-1252]]).<ref>[https://www.w3.org/TR/encoding/#names-and-labels W3C/WHATWG Encoding specification: Names and Labels]</ref><ref>[https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/infrastructure.html#encoding-terminology HTML5 specification: 2.1.6 Character encodings]</ref> {{As of|2020|04}}, 2.2% of all (and 0.7% of the top-1000<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://w3techs.com/technologies/cross/character_encoding/ranking|title=Usage Survey of Character Encodings broken down by Ranking|website=w3techs.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>) [[World Wide Web|Web sites]] claim to use {{nowrap|ISO 8859-1}}.<ref name=\"encoding\">{{cite web|url=https://w3techs.com/technologies/history_overview/character_encoding|title=Historical trends in the usage of character encodings, April 2020|publisher=|accessdate=2020-04-14}}</ref> However, this includes an unknown number of pages actually using Windows-1252 and/or [[UTF-8]], both of which are commonly recognized by browsers, despite the character set tag.\n\nIt is the default encoding of the values of certain descriptive HTTP headers, and defines the repertoire of characters allowed in [[HTML]]&nbsp;3.2 documents (HTML&nbsp;4.0 uses [[Unicode]], ''i.e.'', [[UTF-8]]), and is specified by many other standards.

The slot corresponding to its uppercase form is occupied by the lowercase letter ''[[\u00df]]'' from the German language, which did not have an [[Capital \u1e9e|uppercase form]] at the time when the standard was created.\n\n=== Quotation marks ===\nFor some languages listed above, the correct typographical [[Quotation mark#Summary table|quotation marks]] are missing, as only {{code|\u00ab \u00bb}}, {{code|\" \"}}, and {{code|' '}} are included. Also, this scheme does not provide for oriented (6- or 9-shaped) single or double quotation marks. Some fonts will display the spacing grave accent (0x60) and the apostrophe (0x27) as a matching pair of oriented single quotation marks, but this is not considered part of the modern standard.\n\n== History ==\nISO 8859-1 was based on the [[Multinational Character Set]] used by [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) in the popular [[VT220]] terminal in 1983. It was developed within the [[Ecma International|European Computer Manufacturers Association]] (ECMA), and published in March 1985 as ECMA-94,<ref name=\"ECMA_1985_ECMA94_R1\" /> by which name it is still sometimes known. The second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)<ref>[https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/Ecma-094.pdf second edition of ECMA-94 (June 1986)]</ref> also included [[ISO/IEC 8859-2|ISO 8859-2]], [[ISO/IEC 8859-3|ISO 8859-3]], and [[ISO/IEC 8859-4|ISO 8859-4]] as part of the specification.\n\nThe original draft of ISO 8859-1 placed French ''\u0152'' and ''\u0153'' at code points 215 (0xD7) and 247 (0xF7), as in the ECMA-94. However, the delegate from France, being neither a linguist nor a typographer, falsely stated that these are not independent French letters on their own, but mere [[Orthographic ligature|ligatures]] (like ''\ufb01'' or ''\ufb02''), supported by the delegate team from [[Bull Publishing Company]], who regularly did not print French with ''\u0152/\u0153'' in their house style at the time. An anglophone delegate from Canada insisted in retaining ''\u0152/\u0153'' but was rebuffed by the French delegate and the team from Bull. These code points were soon filled with \u00d7 and \u00f7 under the suggestion of the German delegation. Then things went even worse for the French language, when it was again falsely stated that the letter ''\u00ff'' is \"not French\", resulting in the absence of the capital ''\u0178''. In fact, the letter ''\u00ff'' is found in a number of French proper names, and the capital letter has been used in dictionaries and encyclopedias.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jacques|first=Andr\u00e9|title=ISO Latin-1, norme de codage des caract\u00e8res europ\u00e9ens?

|quote=[\u2026] Since 1982 the urgency of the need for an 8-bit single-byte coded character set was recognized in ECMA as well as in ANSI/X3L2 and numerous working papers were exchanged between the two groups. In February 1984 ECMA TC1 submitted to ISO/TC97/SC2 a proposal for such a coded character set. At its meeting of April 1984 SC decided to submit to TC97 a proposal for a new item of work for this topic. Technical discussions during and after this meeting led TC1 to adopt the coding scheme proposed by X3L2. Part 1 of Draft International Standard DTS 8859 is based on this joint ANSI/ECMA proposal. [\u2026] Adopted as an ECMA Standard by the General Assembly of Dec. 13\u201314, 1984. [\u2026] |df= }}</ref>}} In the original draft, however, \u0152 was at codepoint 215 (0xD7) and \u0153 was at codepoint 247 (0xF7).\n\n== Similar character sets ==\n{{Main|Western Latin character sets (computing)}}\n\n=== ISO/IEC 8859-15 ===\n[[ISO/IEC 8859-15]] was developed in 1999, as an update of ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. It provides some characters for French and Finnish text and the [[euro sign]], which are missing from ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-1. This required the removal of some infrequently used characters from ISO/IEC 8859-1, including fraction symbols and letter-free diacritics: {{code|\u00a4}}, {{code|\u00a6}}, {{code|\u00a8}}, {{code|\u00b4}}, {{code|\u00b8}}, {{code|\u00bc}}, {{code|\u00bd}}, and {{code|\u00be}}. Ironically, three of the newly added characters ({{code|\u0152}}, {{code|\u0153}}, and {{code|\u0178}}) had already been present in [[DEC (company)|DEC]]'s 1983 [[Multinational Character Set]] (MCS), the predecessor to ISO/IEC 8859-1 (1987). Since their original code points were now reused for other purposes, the characters had to be reintroduced under different, less logical code points.\n\nISO-IR-204, a more minor modification, had been registered in 1998, altering ISO-8859-1 by replacing the [[universal currency sign]] (\u00a4) with the euro sign<ref>{{citation|mode=cs1 |url=https://www.itscj.ipsj.or.jp/iso-ir/204.pdf |title=ISO-IR 204: Supplementary set for Latin-1 alternative with EURO SIGN |author=ITS Information Technology Standardization |publisher=ITSCJ/[[Information Processing Society of Japan|IPSJ]] |date=1998-09-16}}</ref> (the same substitution made by ISO-8859-15).\n\n=== Windows-1252 ===\nThe popular [[Windows-1252]] character set adds all the missing characters provided by [[ISO/IEC&nbsp;8859-15]], plus a number of typographic symbols, by replacing the rarely used C1 controls in the range 128 to 159 ([[hexadecimal|hex]] 80 to 9F). It is very common to mislabel Windows-1252 text as being in ISO-8859-1. A common result was that all the quotes and apostrophes (produced by \"smart quotes\" in word-processing software) were replaced with question marks or boxes on non-Windows operating systems, making text difficult to read. Many web browsers and e-mail clients will interpret ISO-8859-1 control codes as Windows-1252 characters, and that behavior was later standardized in [[HTML5]].<ref>{{cite web |last=van Kesteren |first=Anne |url=https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |work=Encoding Standard |title=5.2 Names and labels |publisher=[[WHATWG]] |date=27 January 2015 |access-date=4 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204174315/https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels |archive-date=4 February 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Mac Roman ===\nThe [[Apple Macintosh]] computer introduced a character encoding called [[Mac Roman]] in 1984. It was meant to be suitable for Western European [[desktop publishing]]. It is a superset of [[ASCII]], and has most of the characters that are in ISO-8859-1 and all the extra characters from Windows-1252 but in a totally different arrangement. The few printable characters that are in ISO 8859-1, but not in this set, are often a source of trouble when editing text on Web sites using older Macintosh browsers, including the last version of [[Internet Explorer for Mac]].\n\n=== Other ===\nDOS had [[code page 850]], which had all printable characters that ISO-8859-1 had (albeit in a totally different arrangement) plus the most widely used [[graphic character]]s from [[code page 437]].\n\nBetween 1989<ref name=\"HP82240B_1989\"/> and 2015,<!-- end of production of HP 50g, HP's last RPL calculator --> [[Hewlett-Packard]] used another superset of ISO-8859-1 on many of their calculators.

The [[National Football Museum]] stated that he is \"widely recognised as the most naturally talented English footballer of his generation\".<ref name=\"nfm\" />\n\nBorn and raised in [[Gateshead]], Gascoigne signed schoolboy terms with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], before turning professional with the [[Football League First Division|top tier]] (pre-[[Premier League]] creation) club in 1985. Three years later he was sold on to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a \u00a32.2 million fee. He won the [[FA Cup]] with Spurs in [[1991 FA Cup Final|1991]], before being sold to Italian club [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for \u00a35.5 million the following year. In July 1995, he was transferred to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] for \u00a34.3 million and helped the club to two league titles and two trophies. He returned to England in a \u00a33.4 million move to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in March 1998. He made his debut in the Premier League in the 1998\u201399 season, having already featured in the [[1998 Football League Cup Final]]. He switched to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in July 2000, and later had spells with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Gansu Tianma F.C.|Gansu Tianma]] (China), and [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]].\n\nGascoigne was part of the England team that reached fourth place in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], where he famously [[crying|cried]] after receiving a yellow card in the [[West Germany v England (1990 FIFA World Cup)|semi-final with West Germany]] which meant he would have been suspended for the final had England won the game. He also helped the team to the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1996]], which included scoring a goal against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2013 as \"one of the most iconic goals in the game's recent history\".<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/13/vault-paul-gascoigne-wondergoal-scotland-euro-96 | title= From the Vault: Paul Gascoigne's wondergoal against Scotland at Euro 96| first=Paul| last=Campbell| work=[[The Guardian]] | date=13 August 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref> He has been involved in a number of high-profile [[goal celebration]]s at both club and international level, including the \"dentist's chair\" celebration from Euro '96, and mimicking playing the flute with Rangers in 1998.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football's best and worst goal celebrations |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/6250946/Football-goal-celebrations-best-and-worst.html |accessdate=10 October 2018 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nIn the later parts of his career and especially following retirement, Gascoigne's life became dominated by severe mental and emotional problems, particularly [[alcoholism]].

He is also known by his nickname, '''Gazza'''. He earned 57 [[cap (sport)|caps]] during his England career. The [[National Football Museum]] stated that he is \"widely recognised as the most naturally talented English footballer of his generation\".<ref name=\"nfm\" />\n\nBorn and raised in [[Gateshead]], Gascoigne signed schoolboy terms with [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], before turning professional with the [[Football League First Division|top tier]] (pre-[[Premier League]] creation) club in 1985. Three years later he was sold on to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a \u00a32.2 million fee. He won the [[FA Cup]] with Spurs in [[1991 FA Cup Final|1991]], before being sold to Italian club [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] for \u00a35.5 million the following year. In July 1995, he was transferred to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] for \u00a34.3 million and helped the club to two league titles and two trophies. He returned to England in a \u00a33.4 million move to [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in March 1998. He made his debut in the Premier League in the 1998\u201399 season, having already featured in the [[1998 Football League Cup Final]]. He switched to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in July 2000, and later had spells with [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Gansu Tianma F.C.|Gansu Tianma]] (China), and [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]].\n\nGascoigne was part of the England team that reached fourth place in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]], where he famously [[crying|cried]] after receiving a yellow card in the [[West Germany v England (1990 FIFA World Cup)|semi-final with West Germany]] which meant he would have been suspended for the final had England won the game. He also helped the team to the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 1996]], which included scoring a goal against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2013 as \"one of the most iconic goals in the game's recent history\".<ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/aug/13/vault-paul-gascoigne-wondergoal-scotland-euro-96 | title= From the Vault: Paul Gascoigne's wondergoal against Scotland at Euro 96| first=Paul| last=Campbell| work=[[The Guardian]] | date=13 August 2013 | accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref> He has been involved in a number of high-profile [[goal celebration]]s at both club and international level, including the \"dentist's chair\" celebration from Euro '96, and mimicking playing the flute with Rangers in 1998.<ref>{{cite news |title=Football's best and worst goal celebrations |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/6250946/Football-goal-celebrations-best-and-worst.html |accessdate=10 October 2018 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref>\n\nIn the later parts of his career and especially following retirement, Gascoigne's life became dominated by severe mental and emotional problems, particularly [[alcoholism]]. He has been jailed or [[involuntary commitment|sectioned]] on numerous occasions and his struggles receive regular coverage in the British press. He has frequently attempted to live without alcohol, though rehabilitation programmes have provided only temporary relief. His personal issues ended his coaching career, and he has not worked in football since being dismissed as the manager of [[Kettering Town F.C.|Kettering Town]] in 2005.\n\n==Early life==\nGascoigne was born in [[Gateshead]], County Durham, on 27 May 1967.<ref>{{Hugman|7083|accessdate=24 October 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"newcastle\">{{cite web |url=http://www.nufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HeroesDetail/0,,10278~550714,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424061003/http://www.nufc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/HeroesDetail/0,,10278~550714,00.html |archivedate=24 April 2008 |title=Heroes: Paul Gascoigne |publisher=Newcastle United F.C}}</ref> His father, John (1946\u20132018), was a [[Brick hod|hod carrier]], and his mother, Carol, worked in a factory.<ref>{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=12}}</ref> He was named Paul John Gascoigne in tribute to [[Paul McCartney]] and [[John Lennon]] of [[the Beatles]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=13}}</ref>\n\nHe attended [[Breckenbeds Junior High School]], then the [[Heathfield Senior High School]], both in the [[Low Fell]] area of Gateshead.<ref>{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=23}}</ref> He was noticed by football scouts while playing for Gateshead Boys, though failed to impress in a trial at [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=30}}</ref> Further trials at [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] and [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] also proved unsuccessful, before the team he supported, [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], signed him as a schoolboy in 1980.<ref name=\"Gascoigne 2004 31\">{{harvnb|Gascoigne|2004|p=31}}</ref> Gascoigne frequently got into trouble with his friend Jimmy \"Five Bellies\" Gardner.

It was also with his actions. Clark explained how he was playing in a youth international match at Wembley stadium.

Supporters of Sanders believed that the convention rules, which had been largely the same for the previous 8 years, gave an unfair amount of power to the convention chair. The rules specifically lay out that all convention votes must be done by voice vote, and that only the convention chair can declare the winner or call for a more specific method of voting among the thousands of delegates. During the vote the convention chair, Roberta Lange accepted the \"yeas\" even though the \"nays\" were louder than the \"yeas\" in the room. However both preliminary and final delegate counts showed that Clinton supporters outnumbered Sanders supporters in the room. Once Lange accepted the \"yeas\", upset Sanders supporters rushed the main stage, yelling obscenities at Lange and other members of the party\u2019s executive board.

The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] held its [[South Carolina Republican primary, 2016|South Carolina primary]] on the same day, while their own [[Nevada Republican caucuses, 2016|Nevada caucuses]] took place on February 23.\n\nWith all other candidates having dropped out of the race ahead of the Nevada caucuses, the two remaining candidates were [[Bernie Sanders]] and [[Hillary Clinton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nvdems.com/caucus/candidates/|title=2016 Candidates|publisher=NVDems|date=2014-06-20|accessdate=2016-05-21}}</ref>\n\n==Process==\n[[File:Washoe County Democratic Convention 2016 (25925609250).jpg|thumb|Tension arises at the Washoe County Democratic Convention 2016, between Sanders supporters in front and Clinton supporters behind.]]\nOf the total number of 43 delegates the Nevada Democratic Party may send to the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]], 35 are pledged and 8 are unpledged.\n\nThe delegate selection process is a system with three levels:\n# The first step in the delegate selection process were the precinct caucuses on February 20, which elected about 12,000 delegates to the county conventions.\n# At the county conventions on April 2, the county delegates selected about 4,000 delegates to the state convention.\n# At the state convention on May 14\u201315, the final 35 pledged delegates to the National Convention will be selected. 23 of them are allocated proportionally based on congressional district results, whereas the remaining 12 are allocated based on the state convention as a whole.\n\n==State convention==\nThe state convention was held in May as the final stage of the delegate selection process. Supporters of Sanders believed that the convention rules, which had been largely the same for the previous 8 years, gave an unfair amount of power to the convention chair. The rules specifically lay out that all convention votes must be done by voice vote, and that only the convention chair can declare the winner or call for a more specific method of voting among the thousands of delegates. During the vote the convention chair, Roberta Lange accepted the \"yeas\" even though the \"nays\" were louder than the \"yeas\" in the room. However both preliminary and final delegate counts showed that Clinton supporters outnumbered Sanders supporters in the room. Once Lange accepted the \"yeas\", upset Sanders supporters rushed the main stage, yelling obscenities at Lange and other members of the party\u2019s executive board. The event was quickly shut down after that. Casino spokeswoman Jennifer Forkis said the event ran over its allotted time by about four hours, meaning security hired for the event would soon leave their shifts. \"Without adequate security personnel, and in consultation with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and event organizers, a decision was made that it was in the best interest of everyone in attendance to end the event,\" Forkis said in a statement.<ref>https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2016/may/18/jeff-weaver/allegations-fraud-and-misconduct-nevada-democratic/</ref>\n\n==Debates and forums==\n===October 2015 debate in Las Vegas===\n{{main|First Democratic Party presidential debate, October 2015 in Las Vegas, Nevada}}\n\nOn October 13, 2015, the Democratic Party's very first debate was held at the [[Wynn Las Vegas|Wynn Hotel]] in [[Las Vegas]].

The western ridgeline of the valley, also part of the greater Massanutten range, is composed primarily of three named mountains, from north to south: Three Top Mountain, Powell Mountain and Short Mountain. Additionally, behind Three Top and Powell mountains another ridgeline in the chain is called Green Mountain which is actually higher in elevation than the 3 westernmost named mountains and between which is a smaller highland valley, called Little Fort Valley. The far southern end of Fort Valley also contains a small highland sub-valley called Crisman's Hollow, between Catback and Kerns mountains. Duncan's Knob at 2,800 feet, on Catback Mountain, and Strickler's Knob at over 2,700 feet on Masanutten Mountain are the two highest points in the Fort Valley Ridgeline. In addition, there are several other named smaller mountains, knobs, notches and mountain gaps within the ridges of Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley is almost entirely enclosed. At its southern end it is enclosed with an access point named Moreland Gap, and to the north it is constricted and nearly closed but for where [[Passage Creek]] flows through a narrow gap providing passage towards Front Royal. Passage Creek also is a prominent element of Fort Valley, running the entire length of the valley at its center, starting in Crishman Hollow in the mountain in the southernmost valley and flowing north, fed by other streams and runs, until it exits Fort Valley just past Elizabeth Furnace. The valley opens out toward the center, becoming about {{convert|3|mi|spell=in}} wide at its widest. The extreme southern end of the valley, the highlands of Crishman Hollow, is in Page County. The remainder of Fort Valley is in Shenandoah County, with the border of Shenandoah and Page counties being along the eastern ridgeline of Masanutten Mountain.  In all, Fort Valley is {{convert|23|mi}} long. \n\nFort Valley is entirely rural, consisting mostly of private farmland, surrounded by the [[George Washington National Forest]] (GWNF), which covers the slopes and ridges on both the east and west mountains. The [[Elizabeth Furnace]] and [[Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area]] of the GWNF are located within Fort Valley. \n\n==Roads and Gaps==\n\nBetween Three Top, Powell and Green Mountain there are two significant gaps, Mine Gap and Woodstock Gap, the latter of which features a dirt road, Rt 758, from the town of  Woodstock to the [https://www.fs.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsinternet/cs/recarea?ss=110808&navtype=BROWSEBYSUBJECT&cid=FSE_003738&navid=110240000000000&pnavid=110000000000000&position=generalinfo&recid=74047&ttype=recarea&pname=Woodstock%20Tower%20Observation%20Site Woodstock Tower], which sits on the ridge of Powell Mountain.  Woodstock Tower offers panoramic views of the town and the Shenandoah Valley and was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1935. \n\nBetween Powell and Short mountains is Edinburg Gap, a more frequently traveled paved road that offers primary access from the west into Fort Valley. At the top of Edinburg Gap on the southern side there is an extensive all terrain vehicle (ATV) trail system set up by the Forest Service. On the northern side of the gap starts Peter's Mill Road, an off-highway vehicle (OHV) road made available for jeeps and four wheel drive vehicles. Peter's Mill Road runs from Edinburg Gap to Woodstock Gap along the higher reaches of the Little Fort Valley. In the east, Fort Valley is accessed via a paved road through Edith Gap that also serves as entrance to Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area. There are no roads accessing Fort Valley over Massanutten Mountain from Camp Roosevelt on the southeast to Elizabeth furnace at the northern apex of the valley.\n\nRoads exit the valley at its northern end ([[Virginia State Route 678|S.R. 678]]) between [[Strasburg, Virginia|Strasburg]] and [[Front Royal, Virginia|Front Royal]], at Edinburg Gap ([[Virginia State Route 675|S.R. 675]]) towards [[Edinburg, Virginia|Edinburg]], Moreland Gap ([[Virginia State Route 730|S.R. 730]]) towards [[New Market, Virginia|New Market]], and Edith Gap (S.R. 675) towards [[Luray, Virginia|Luray]]. There is also the dirt road that leads to [[Woodstock, Virginia|Woodstock]] ([[Virginia State Route 758|S.R 758]]) over Powell Mountain.\n\n==Hiking Trails and Recreation Areas==\n\nThe [[Tuscarora_Trail|Tuscarora trail]], a 252-mile long distance hiking trail that passes through Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland,  Pennsylvania, proceeds along the northeast ridgeline of Fort Valley, entering from just above [https://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/shenandoah-river Shenandoah State Park] on the eastern ridgeline of Massanutten Mountain. The hiking trail passes through the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area, ascends Green Mountain and exits on Doll's Ridge on the western slope of Three Top Mountain as it descends towards the [[Tom's Brook Battlefield]] in the Shenandoah Valley. \n\nThe [[Massanutten Trail]] circumnavigates the entire ridgeline of the Fort Valley, 71 miles in total. It was built by the Potomac Appalachian Trail Club (PATC), completed in 2001. Prior to 2001, different portions of the trail had been known by different names and blazed in different colors. With the completion of the missing links, the Forest Service renamed the combined trails as the Massanutten Trail and provided orange blazes along the trail's entire length around Fort Valley.\n\nFort Valley features two developed U.S. Forest Service recreation areas, [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73687 Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area] toward the northern apex of the Valley, and [https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/gwj/recarea/?recid=73633 Camp Roosevelt Recreation Area] at Edith Gap in the southeast end of the valley. Both recreation areas were built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. Camp Roosevelt features a hang gliding site nearby, a pavilion, camp sites and access to the Masanutten Trail.  Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area features a pavilion and multiple camping areas, interpretive trails related the historical iron industry at the site, and acess to the Masanutten and Tuscarora trails which share a length of trail leading to Elizabeth Furnace from the east and separate at Elizabeth Furnace north (Massanutten Trail) and west (Tuscarora Trail.)\n\n==Special Biological Areas==\n\nThe ridges of Fort Valley administered by the U.S. Forest Service contain several Special Biological Areas (SBA). These include Mudhole Gap SBA in the northern end of the Little Fort Valley; Peters Mill Run Bog SBA in the upper reaches of the Little Fort Valley area just south of Woodstock Tower; Signal Knob SBA and the Edinburg Gap Shale Barrens SBA, two of the easternmost Appalachian shale barrens <ref>https://www.conservationgateway.org/ConservationByGeography/NorthAmerica/UnitedStates/edc/Documents/HabitatGuides/13.pdf</ref>; and Scothorn Gap SBA, a 34 acre forest plan-designated Special Biological Area in the southernmost edge of Masanutten Mountain. Waterfall Mountain Cliffs, in the southern extremity of the Fort Valley's Masanutten Mountain ridgeline just south of Scothorn Gap, has been recommended by Virginia Division of Natural Heritage to be designated as a Special Biological Area as it contains significant amounts of semi-primitive acreage.<ref>http://www.vawilderness.org/uploads/1/7/4/4/17446555/massanutten.pdf</ref>\n\n==History==\nFort Valley was a native American hunting ground. The name Massanutten is said to mean \"Indian Basket,\" the Fort Valley being contained and perhaps shaped like an Indian basket and certainly abounding in wild game in early times.<ref>http://www.vagenweb.org/shenandoah/hom/S_pfv.html</ref>  While no permanent settlements were located there, Indian relics have been found on several temporary village sites. In 1740s Massanutten Mountain was called Peaked Mountain, and later it was known as Buffalo Mountain. George Washington surveyed Fort Valley for [[Lord Fairfax]] in 1748<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>.\n\nA first settler named Powell, reputed to be a fugitive from the law, took refuge in the valley in the northwestern mountain. Likely because it was not easily accessible in the colonial era, the area was then called Powell's Fort Mountain or Powell's Fort Valley, and later just \"The Fort.\" The area Powell inhabited is now known as Powell's Mountain, and Fort Valley. Powell is said to have found silver or gold in the area. About 1733, three frontier hunters settled in \"The Fort\" and others soon followed.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>\n\nAccording to tradition, [[Daniel Morgan]] built the first road into Fort Valley at the order of [[George Washington]], with a view to holing up in this naturally fortified valley as a possible winter retreat had the Continental Army been defeated by the [[British Army|British]] during the [[American Revolution]]. Washington had spent extensive time surveying the valley in his earlier life, and likely had  been impressed by the natural defenses offered by the mountain-contained valley. Thirty years later, after a hard winter at Valley Forge, Washington stated that if the war did not turn in their favor by the next winter, rather than surrender the Army would move south to the Shenandoah and make a stand in \"The Fort.\" About this time Morgan reportedly began building a road into the valley, but when the Continental armies had success work stopped.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref> Primary access would have been through a high pass now called Sherman's Gap along rough road partially constructed by Morgan; the route became known as Morgan's Road. Portions of the road are still visible and accessible by a hiking trail near Sherman's Gap, but in lower elevations the route is lost and unknown. In any case, the [[Continental Army]]'s victory at [[Siege of Yorktown|Yorktown]] made Washington's theoretical plans unnecessary. Why Morgan would have picked a military road over a nearly 2,000 foot minor gap as opposed an easier route along the water line of Passage Creek is unclear, leading some to believe the story is apocryphal. \n\n[[Elizabeth Furnace]] was a blast furnace in the Shenandoah Valley that created pig iron from 1836 \u2013 1888, using Passage Creek for water power. Iron ore was mined in the mountains, purified in the furnace, then pig iron was transported transported over Massanutten Mountain to the South Fork of the Shenandoah River, where it was transported for forging in Harpers Ferry, Virginia (later West Virginia.) The road used to transport the iron is in use today as a hiking trail. At one time, Elizabeth Furnace supported a community associated with the local iron industry. Elizabeth Furnace was destroyed by Union troops in 1864 during operations associated with the [[Battle of Cedar Creek]]. The furnace reopened in 1883 but lacked sufficient output to be competitive with new mines in the midwest, and was abandoned in 1888. The Elizabeth Furnace Cabin is one of the few wooden buildings remaining from the early 1800s when Elizabeth Furnace was active. <ref>https://shenandoahcountyva.us/tourism/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2014/01/Elizabeth_Furnace_rec_Area_info_booklet-sm-res1.pdf</ref>. In 1936 the Civilian Conservation Corps constructed the Elizabeth Furnace Recreation Area on the site.\n\nSignal Knob, a 2,111 foot barren promontory at the extreme northern ridgeline of Fort Valley offering sweeping panoramic views of the Shenandoah Valley northeast and west, was utilized during a Civil War as an important Confederate military observation post. In skirmishing over control of Signal Knob, several Confederate soldiers were killed. One still lies buried there and his grave that inspired the poem, \"The Georgia Volunteer.\"<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref> From Signal Knob the view of the Shenandoah Valley battlefields of Cedar Creek, [[Fisher's Hill]] and Tom's Brook is unobstructed. Signal Knob is accessed by an 11.5 mile round-trip hike from Elizabeth Furnace. Otherwise, during the Civil War no battle was fought in the isolated and contained Fort Valley, but [[General Imboden]]'s cavalry camped there at times.<ref>http://www.patc.us/history/archive/massntn.html</ref>\n\nThe [[Daniel Munch House]], a historic home and farm built in 1834 overlooking Passage Creek in Fort Valley, was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2002.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>  Daniel Munch was a successful farmer and distiller, the son on early German settlers who moved to Fort Valley in 1779.
