It is mainly organized for choosing a new [[head of state]] in case of sudden death, adopting a new constitution, or to settle national or regional issue such as war.<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1782079.stm | work=BBC News | title=Q&A: What is a loya jirga? | date=July 1, 2002 | accessdate=May 11, 2010}}</ref> It predates modern-day written or fixed laws and is mostly favored by the [[Pashtun people]] but to a lesser extent by other nearby groups that have been influenced by Pashtuns (historically known as [[Afghan (ethnonym)|Afghans]]).\n\nIn [[Afghanistan]], ''loya jirgas'' have been reportedly organized since at least the early 18th century when the [[Hotaki dynasty|Hotaki]] and [[Durrani dynasty|Durrani]] dynasties rose to power.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/11/opinion/11krakauer.html?scp=8&sq=jon%20krakauer&st=cse |title=To Save Afghanistan, Look to Its Past |author=Jon Krakauer |newspaper=New York Times |date=September 11, 2009 |accessdate=2014-10-29}}</ref>\n\n==History and terminology ==\n\nThere is a myth in the sense that the ancient [[Aryan]] tribes, who are hypothesized to have spoken [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]], came down in intermittent waves from [[Central Asia]] and Afghanistan. They practiced a sort of ''jirga'' system with two types of councils \u2013 ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' and ''{{transl|pus|sabh\u0101}}''. The ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' (summit) comprised elders and tribal chiefs. The king also joined sessions of the ''{{transl|pus|simite}}''. ''Sabh\u0101'' was a sort of rural council. In India it is referred to as ''Samiti'' and ''Sabha''.\n\nIt was used over time for the selection of rulers and headmen and the airing of matters of principle. From the time of the great Kushan ruler [[Kanishka]] to the 1970s, there were sixteen [[nation]]al ''loya jirgas'' and hundreds of smaller ones. The institution, which is centuries old, is a similar idea to the Islamic ''[[shura]]'' (consultative assembly).<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nIn the [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan society]], the ''loya jirga'' is still maintained and favored, mostly by tribal leaders to solve internal or external disputes with other tribes. In some cases it functions like a [[town hall meeting]].\n\nWhen the Afghans took power they tried to legitimize their hold with such a ''jirga''. While in the beginning only Pashtuns were allowed to participate in the ''jirgas'', later other ethnic groups like [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] and [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] were allowed to participate as well, however they were little more than observers. The member of the ''jirgas'' were mostly members of the Royal Family, religious leaders and tribal leaders of the Afghans. King [[Amanullah Khan]] institutionalized the ''jirga''. From Amanullah until the reign of [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] (1933\u20131973) and [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] (1973\u20131978) the ''jirga'' was recognized as a common meeting of regional Pashtun leaders.\n\nThe meetings do not have scheduled occurrences, but rather are called for when issues or disputes arise. There is no time limit for a ''loya jirga'' to conclude, and the meetings often take time because decisions can only be made as a group and arguments can drag out for days. Various issues can be addressed such as major disaster, foreign policy, declaration of war, the legitimacy of leaders, and the introduction of new ideas and laws.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nSome of the historical ''loya jirgas'' in the [[history of Afghanistan]] are:\n*'''1707\u20131709''' \u2013 ''Loya jirga'' was gathered by [[Mir Wais Hotak]] at [[Kandahar]] in 1707, but according to [[Ghulam Mohammad Ghobar]] it was gathered in Manja in 1709.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wolas.beepworld.de/mirwaisneeka.htm |title=Mirwais Neeka |publisher=Wolas.beepworld.de |date= |accessdate=2013-04-15}}</ref>\n*'''October 1747''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Kandahar]] was attended by Afghan representatives who appointed [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] as their new leader.\n*'''September 1928''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Paghman]], called by [[King Amanullah]], the third loya jirga of his reign (1919\u20131929) to discuss reforms.\n*'''September 1930''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' of 286 called by [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]] to confirm his accession to the throne.\n*'''1941''' \u2013 Called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve neutrality in [[World War II]].\n*'''1947''' \u2013 Held by Pashtuns in the [[FATA|Tribal Agencies]] to choose between joining [[India]] or [[Pakistan]].\n*'''July 26, 1949''' \u2013 [[Afghanistan-Pakistan relations]] rapidly deteriorated over a dispute, officially declared that it did not recognize the 1893 [[Durand Line]] border any longer between the two countries.<ref>Agha Amin, [http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 \"Resolving the Afghan-Pakistan Border Question\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012045458/http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 |date=October 12, 2008}}, ''Journal of Afghanistan Studies'', Kabul, (accessed December 12, 2009).</ref>\n*'''September 1964''' \u2013 A meeting of 452 called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve a new constitution.\n*'''July 1974''' \u2013 A meeting with Pakistan over the Durand Line.\n*'''[[1977 Afghan Constitutional Assembly election|January 1977]]''' \u2013 Approved the new constitution of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] establishing one-party rule in the [[Daouds Republic of Afghanistan|Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''April 1985''' \u2013 To ratify the new constitution of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''September 2001''' \u2013 Four different loya jirga movements anticipating the end of [[Taliban]] rule.

They practiced a sort of ''jirga'' system with two types of councils \u2013 ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' and ''{{transl|pus|sabh\u0101}}''. The ''{{transl|pus|simite}}'' (summit) comprised elders and tribal chiefs. The king also joined sessions of the ''{{transl|pus|simite}}''. ''Sabh\u0101'' was a sort of rural council. In India it is referred to as ''Samiti'' and ''Sabha''.\n\nIt was used over time for the selection of rulers and headmen and the airing of matters of principle. From the time of the great Kushan ruler [[Kanishka]] to the 1970s, there were sixteen [[nation]]al ''loya jirgas'' and hundreds of smaller ones. The institution, which is centuries old, is a similar idea to the Islamic ''[[shura]]'' (consultative assembly).<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\"/>\n\nIn the [[Demographics of Afghanistan|Afghan society]], the ''loya jirga'' is still maintained and favored, mostly by tribal leaders to solve internal or external disputes with other tribes. In some cases it functions like a [[town hall meeting]].\n\nWhen the Afghans took power they tried to legitimize their hold with such a ''jirga''. While in the beginning only Pashtuns were allowed to participate in the ''jirgas'', later other ethnic groups like [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] and [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] were allowed to participate as well, however they were little more than observers. The member of the ''jirgas'' were mostly members of the Royal Family, religious leaders and tribal leaders of the Afghans. King [[Amanullah Khan]] institutionalized the ''jirga''. From Amanullah until the reign of [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] (1933\u20131973) and [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] (1973\u20131978) the ''jirga'' was recognized as a common meeting of regional Pashtun leaders.\n\nThe meetings do not have scheduled occurrences, but rather are called for when issues or disputes arise. There is no time limit for a ''loya jirga'' to conclude, and the meetings often take time because decisions can only be made as a group and arguments can drag out for days. Various issues can be addressed such as major disaster, foreign policy, declaration of war, the legitimacy of leaders, and the introduction of new ideas and laws.\n\n==Afghanistan==\nSome of the historical ''loya jirgas'' in the [[history of Afghanistan]] are:\n*'''1707\u20131709''' \u2013 ''Loya jirga'' was gathered by [[Mir Wais Hotak]] at [[Kandahar]] in 1707, but according to [[Ghulam Mohammad Ghobar]] it was gathered in Manja in 1709.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wolas.beepworld.de/mirwaisneeka.htm |title=Mirwais Neeka |publisher=Wolas.beepworld.de |date= |accessdate=2013-04-15}}</ref>\n*'''October 1747''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Kandahar]] was attended by Afghan representatives who appointed [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] as their new leader.\n*'''September 1928''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' at [[Paghman]], called by [[King Amanullah]], the third loya jirga of his reign (1919\u20131929) to discuss reforms.\n*'''September 1930''' \u2013 A ''jirga'' of 286 called by [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]] to confirm his accession to the throne.\n*'''1941''' \u2013 Called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve neutrality in [[World War II]].\n*'''1947''' \u2013 Held by Pashtuns in the [[FATA|Tribal Agencies]] to choose between joining [[India]] or [[Pakistan]].\n*'''July 26, 1949''' \u2013 [[Afghanistan-Pakistan relations]] rapidly deteriorated over a dispute, officially declared that it did not recognize the 1893 [[Durand Line]] border any longer between the two countries.<ref>Agha Amin, [http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 \"Resolving the Afghan-Pakistan Border Question\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012045458/http://www.chowk.com/ilogs/65724/47736 |date=October 12, 2008}}, ''Journal of Afghanistan Studies'', Kabul, (accessed December 12, 2009).</ref>\n*'''September 1964''' \u2013 A meeting of 452 called by [[Mohammed Zahir Shah]] to approve a new constitution.\n*'''July 1974''' \u2013 A meeting with Pakistan over the Durand Line.\n*'''[[1977 Afghan Constitutional Assembly election|January 1977]]''' \u2013 Approved the new constitution of [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]] establishing one-party rule in the [[Daouds Republic of Afghanistan|Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''April 1985''' \u2013 To ratify the new constitution of the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan]].\n*'''September 2001''' \u2013 Four different loya jirga movements anticipating the end of [[Taliban]] rule.

Excessive use of energy without adequate disposal of heat, for example, could plausibly make the planet of a civilization approaching Type&nbsp;I unsuitable to the biology of the [[human|dominant life-forms]] and their food sources. If Earth is an example, then sea temperatures in excess of {{convert|35|C|F}} would jeopardize marine life and make the cooling of mammals to temperatures suitable for their [[metabolism]] difficult if not impossible. Of course, these [[theoretical]] speculations may not become problems possibly through the applications of future [[engineering]] and [[technology]]. Also, by the time a civilization reaches Type&nbsp;I it may have colonized other planets or created [[O'Neill cylinder|O'Neill-type colonies]], so that waste heat could be distributed throughout the planetary system\n\nThe limitation of biological life-form and the evolution of computing technology may lead to the transformation of the civilization through [[Mind uploading]] during the transition from Type I to Type II, leading to [[Matrioshka brain|digitalized civilization]]).\n\n==Extensions to the original scale==\nMany extensions and modifications to the Kardashev scale have been proposed.\n\n* '''Types 0, IV, and V Kardashev rating:''' The most straightforward extension of the scale to even more hypothetical Type&nbsp;IV beings who can control or use the entire universe or Type&nbsp;V who control collections of universes.

Excessive use of energy without adequate disposal of heat, for example, could plausibly make the planet of a civilization approaching Type&nbsp;I unsuitable to the biology of the [[human|dominant life-forms]] and their food sources. If Earth is an example, then sea temperatures in excess of {{convert|35|C|F}} would jeopardize marine life and make the cooling of mammals to temperatures suitable for their [[metabolism]] difficult if not impossible. Of course, these [[theoretical]] speculations may not become problems possibly through the applications of future [[engineering]] and [[technology]].

They occupied some area in an cool mountain slopes of the [[Barisan Mountains|Barisan mountain range]] in both sides of [[Bengkulu Province|Bengkulu]] and [[South Sumatra Province|South Sumatra]]. With approximately more than 1,3 million people, they form the largest ethnic group in Bengkulu Province. Rejangese people predominantly live as a majority in 5 out 10 regencies and city of Bengkulu Province, while the rest of them who lives in South Sumatera resides at 7 villages in the district called as Bermani Ulu Rawas. The Rejangs are predominantly an Islam adherent group with small numbers following a religion other than Islam. According to research, Rejangese people are the descendants of the Bukar-Sadong people who migrated from Northern Borneo ([[Sarawak]]).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe etymology of the name of Rejang or in [[Rejang language]] itself as Jang is remains unclear.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.klikwarta.com/index.php/rejang-salah-satu-suku-tertua-di-sumatera |title=Rejang Salah Satu Suku Tertua di Sumatera |publisher=Klik Warta |author=Benny Hakim Benardie |date=3 January 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-04 }}</ref> It is not clearly known when the name Rejang people was used or when did they first regard themselves as Rejang. Another question that is yet to be certain if the name Rejang itself is a term or reference name that was given by other neighboring ethnic groups. According to the locals of [[Lebong Regency]], it is believed that the word ''Rejang'' means \"to cross over\". This belief if based on a widely spread myth among the Rejang community in Tapus, which is believed to be the oldest Rejang settlement. The belief mentions that the ancestors of the Rejang people came from a distant land where its exact location is unknown. Hence, some scholars believe that the term Jang or Rejang has a correlation with the possibility of Rejangese people in ancient time did not reside in Sumatra.\n\nOn the basis of that belief, therefore according to Professor Richard McGinn's observation that presents a theory or hypothesis that the ancestors of the Rejang people originate from a region in the northern part of West Borneo that is known as [[Sarawak]] today, from which the ancestors of the Rejang people crossed over the [[Karimata Strait]] from [[Borneo]] to [[Sumatra]] with unclear reason. The term Jang or the verb Merejang means \"passed\" (specifically means \"passed the strait\") or \"traveling not on land\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repository.unib.ac.id/8995/1/I%2CII%2CIII%2CI-14-put-FH.pdf |title=Penyelesaian Konflik Ssosial Yang Timbul Dari Pemasangan Tapal Batas Kabupaten Rejang Lebong Dan Kabupaten Kepahiang Berbasis Hukum Kearifan Lokal |publisher=Universitas Bengkulu |author=Putra Setiadi |year=2014 |accessdate=2018-07-01 }}</ref> However, the meaning of Jang word which is the native term used by Rejangese people to describe themselves as a single entity remains unclear. The usage of that word also limited just for describing the entity of Jang and uncommon in the daily conversation. Upon their arrival at the estuary of the [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]], they went upwards [[Musi River (Indonesia)|Musi River]] and [[Rawas River]] towards the upstream to the place where majority of the Rejang settlements are today in the interior of [[Bengkulu Province]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Richard McGinn|title=Outline of Rejang Syntax|year=1939|publisher=Badan Penyelenggara Seri NUSA, Universitas Atma Jaya|oclc=896427174|page=59}}</ref> The term Rejang is also the same as the [[Rejang River]] in [[Sarawak]], [[Malaysia]], the place where it is thought to be the land of origin of the Rejang people before settling in [[Sumatra]].<ref name=\"OOBSHFR\"/>\n\nApart from that among the community of Taba Anyar Village, there is a story that the term Rejang and Lebong are correlated and is used as the name for [[Rejang Lebong Regency]] came from the common practice of ''merajang rebung'' (meaning \"chopping bamboo shoots\") in the Rejang community that is still seen today. Bamboo shoots have long been consumed as a food source in the interior of [[Bengkulu Province]]. From the common practice of chopping bamboo shoots, then came the term Rejang and Lebong. Nevertheless, this one story is doubted by many parties due to the impression of simply rhyme matching the terms alone.\n\n==Population==\nThe population is not well measured, with estimates from 250,000 to a million.

According to reports of Dutch officials in [[Bengkulu]], the Rejang was divided into 5 linguistic and tribal groups, each of which was subject to a separate leader.

[[Bengkulu language]] at this moment is seen as a lingua franca to carry out communication between the native Rejang people and the non-native ethnic people.

[[Sarawak]] is the region where it is said to be the birthplace of the Rejang people before migrating to [[Sumatra]]. The [[Rejang language]] according to Professor Richard McGinn does not have a single related language in [[Sumatra]].

According to other tales, [[Rejang script]] is referred to as ''rikung'' due to its cornering angles.

''Diwo'' refers to \"gods\" and ''nyang'' refers to \"goddess\". The names of the gods and goddesses of the folk belief of the Rejang people are almost unknown. However, the most well known is the Goddess of Paddy or Goddess of Fertility that is known as Nyang Serai. Nyang Serai is the Rejang people's version of Javanese Goddess of Paddy, [[Dewi Sri]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Wolfgang Marschall & Victor T.

One of the main locations to ''betarak'' is in [[Mount Kaba]]. [[Mount Kaba]] is actually opened to the public. This area is a conservation area and permission from the officers at the entrance is required and it is an obligation to report the number of hikers. Nevertheless, based on the tale of Muning Raib, Rejang people from [[Curup]] are forbidden to enter [[Mount Kaba]] to avoid misfortune or calamity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pedomanbengkulu.com/2018/03/legenda-muning-raib-dalam-cerita-rakyat-bengkulu/ |title=Legenda Muning Raib dalam Cerita Rakyat Bengkulu |publisher=Pedoman Bengkulu |author=Eva De |year=12 March 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-24 }}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the ''diwo'' or ''nyang'' that's worshiped by the community, the ''smat'' group on the other hand are feared; be it of its nature to consume its victim nor to dwell in certain locations in the lands of the Rejang people. In order to avoid ''smat'', prayer and seeking permission must be done before entering a place or taking something from nature. Seeking a permission is done by saying, \"''stabik nik, keme nupang melitas''\", which means \"excuse me, granny, we're passing by\". Types of ''smat'' that the Rejang people believe are such as ''sebei sebkeu'', ''si'amang bi'oa'', ''sumei'' and ''smat la'ut''. There are some ''smat''s that are positioned as guards or ''tunggau'' in certain places. The most well known ''tunggau'' among the Rejang people is the Dung Ulau Tujuak or the Seven Headed Snake that inhabits the ''srawung'' or underwater cave beneath the [[Tes Lake]], [[Lebong Regency]].\n\nThe old Rejang society regard the jungle as a gift by God and as the source of life. The jungle are the source of timber, honey and animal game. When clearing the jungle, the ''tabeus'' ritual is carried out to seek permission from the ancestral guardian of the jungle before the clearing of the jungle is carried out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://liveindonesia.id/en/ilmu-penjinak-api-di-suku-serawai-dan-rejang/ |title=Ilmu Penjinak Api Di Suku Serawai Dan Rejang |publisher=Live Knowledge |author=Harry Siswoyo |date=19 February 2017 |accessdate=2018-06-25 }}</ref> Just as in other society, the jungle or ''imbo'' are usually inhabited by mystical animals such as ''imeu'' or tiger. For the Rejang community, the tiger is seen as an ancestral incarnation, sacred and should not be hurt or killed. Tigers are seen as old relatives addressed as ''datuk'', ''ninik'' or ''puyang''.\n\n===Present day beliefs===\nAt present, many of the Rejang people embraces [[Islam]].

They occupied some area in an cool mountain slopes of the [[Barisan Mountains|Barisan mountain range]] in both sides of [[Bengkulu Province|Bengkulu]] and [[South Sumatra Province|South Sumatra]]. With approximately more than 1,3 million people, they form the largest ethnic group in Bengkulu Province. Rejangese people predominantly live as a majority in 5 out 10 regencies and city of Bengkulu Province, while the rest of them who lives in South Sumatera resides at 7 villages in the district called as Bermani Ulu Rawas. The Rejangs are predominantly an Islam adherent group with small numbers following a religion other than Islam. According to research, Rejangese people are the descendants of the Bukar-Sadong people who moved from the Northern Borneo ([[Sarawak]]).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe etymology of the name of Rejang or in [[Rejang language]] itself as Jang is remains unclear.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.klikwarta.com/index.php/rejang-salah-satu-suku-tertua-di-sumatera |title=Rejang Salah Satu Suku Tertua di Sumatera |publisher=Klik Warta |author=Benny Hakim Benardie |date=3 January 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-04 }}</ref> It is not clearly known when the name Rejang people was used or when did they first regard themselves as Rejang. Another question that is yet to be certain if the name Rejang itself is a term or reference name that was given by other neighboring ethnic groups. According to the locals of [[Lebong Regency]], it is believed that the word ''Rejang'' means \"to cross over\". This belief if based on a widely spread myth among the Rejang community in Tapus, which is believed to be the oldest Rejang settlement. The belief mentions that the ancestors of the Rejang people came from a distant land where its exact location is unknown. Hence, some scholars believe that the term Jang or Rejang has a correlation with the possibility of Rejangese people in ancient time did not reside in Sumatra.\n\nOn the basis of that belief, therefore according to Professor Richard McGinn's observation that presents a theory or hypothesis that the ancestors of the Rejang people originate from a region in the northern part of West Borneo that is known as [[Sarawak]] today, from which the ancestors of the Rejang people crossed over the [[Karimata Strait]] from [[Borneo]] to [[Sumatra]] with unclear reason. The term Jang or the verb Merejang means \"passed\" (specifically means \"passed the strait\") or \"traveling not on land\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repository.unib.ac.id/8995/1/I%2CII%2CIII%2CI-14-put-FH.pdf |title=Penyelesaian Konflik Ssosial Yang Timbul Dari Pemasangan Tapal Batas Kabupaten Rejang Lebong Dan Kabupaten Kepahiang Berbasis Hukum Kearifan Lokal |publisher=Universitas Bengkulu |author=Putra Setiadi |year=2014 |accessdate=2018-07-01 }}</ref> However, the meaning of Jang word which is the native term used by Rejangese people to describe themselves as a single entity remains unclear. The usage of that word also limited just for describing the entity of Jang and uncommon in the daily conversation.

Bamboo shoots have long been consumed as a food source in the interior of [[Bengkulu Province]]. From the common practice of chopping bamboo shoots, then came the term Rejang and Lebong. Nevertheless, this one story is doubted by many parties due to the impression of simply rhyme matching the terms alone.\n\n==Population==\nThe population is not well measured, with estimates from 250,000 to a million.

The main characteristics of the script are the sharp and bold straight lines in contrary to [[Javanese script]] and [[Balinese script]] that are more wavy. The evolution of the [[Rejang script]] that led to its sharp, straight and bold lines is said to be the consequences of the adaption of writing on wood, bones, bark cloth, bamboo, buffalo horn and (now lost) copper plates.<ref>{{cite book|author=Peter T.

According to folk tales, the [[Rejang script]] was first written with sharp tools including sickle which produces sharp lines. According to other tales, [[Rejang script]] is referred to as ''rikung'' due to its cornering angles. There are 19 main consonants (''buak tu'ai'') in [[Rejang script]], changes in vowel sound (''tando ketikeak'') and 9 doubling consonants (''buak ngimbang'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://repository.unib.ac.id/8964/1/I%2CII%2CIII%2CI-14-ria-FK.pdf |title=Studi Deskriptif Implementasi Muatan Lokal Bahasa Rejang Dalam Menanamkan Rasa Cinta Tanah Air Siswa Kelas IV SDN 04 Kecamatan Kerkap Bengkulu Utara |author=Ria Nurdayani |publisher=Universitas Bengkulu |page=15 |year=2014 |accessdate=2018-06-17 }}</ref> These 28 alphabets are assigned single or double [[diacritic]] marks to produce sounds other than \"a\" and also produce [[diphthong]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0/ch17.pdf |title=Unicode\u00ae 10.0.0 |publisher=Unicode |page=675 |isbn=978-1-936213-16-0 |date=20 June 2017 |accessdate=2018-06-17 }}</ref>\n\n==Religion==\n===Folk religion===\nNot much is known about the religion or the beliefs that is practiced by the ancestors of the Rejang people. The most clearest and important relics that exist today that states about the spiritual or religious experiences of the old Rejang society are the ''rejung'' and ''kedurai agung'' tradition. Both of these traditions are inseparable from each other.

''Diwo'' refers to \"gods\" and ''nyang'' refers to \"goddess\". The names of the gods and goddesses of the folk belief of the Rejang people are almost unknown. However, the most well known is the Goddess of Paddy or Goddess of Fertility that is known as Nyang Serai. Nyang Serai is the Rejang people's version of Javanese Goddess of Paddy, [[Dewi Sri]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Wolfgang Marschall & Victor T.

One of the main locations to ''betarak'' is in [[Mount Kaba]]. [[Mount Kaba]] is actually opened to the public. This area is a conservation area and permission from the officers at the entrance is required and it is an obligation to report the number of hikers. Nevertheless, based on the tale of Muning Raib, Rejang people from [[Curup]] are forbidden to enter [[Mount Kaba]] to avoid misfortune or calamity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pedomanbengkulu.com/2018/03/legenda-muning-raib-dalam-cerita-rakyat-bengkulu/ |title=Legenda Muning Raib dalam Cerita Rakyat Bengkulu |publisher=Pedoman Bengkulu |author=Eva De |year=12 March 2018 |accessdate=2018-06-24 }}</ref>\n\nIn contrast to the ''diwo'' or ''nyang'' that's worshiped by the community, the ''smat'' group on the other hand are feared; be it of its nature to consume its victim nor to dwell in certain locations in the lands of the Rejang people. In order to avoid ''smat'', prayer and seeking permission must be done before entering a place or taking something from nature. Seeking a permission is done by saying, \"''stabik nik, keme nupang melitas''\", which means \"excuse me, granny, we're passing by\". Types of ''smat'' that the Rejang people believe are such as ''sebei sebkeu'', ''si'amang bi'oa'', ''sumei'' and ''smat la'ut''. There are some ''smat''s that are positioned as guards or ''tunggau'' in certain places. The most well known ''tunggau'' among the Rejang people is the Dung Ulau Tujuak or the Seven Headed Snake that inhabits the ''srawung'' or underwater cave beneath the [[Tes Lake]], [[Lebong Regency]].\n\nThe old Rejang society regard the jungle as a gift by God and as the source of life. The jungle are the source of timber, honey and animal game. When clearing the jungle, the ''tabeus'' ritual is carried out to seek permission from the ancestral guardian of the jungle before the clearing of the jungle is carried out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://liveindonesia.id/en/ilmu-penjinak-api-di-suku-serawai-dan-rejang/ |title=Ilmu Penjinak Api Di Suku Serawai Dan Rejang |publisher=Live Knowledge |author=Harry Siswoyo |date=19 February 2017 |accessdate=2018-06-25 }}</ref> Just as in other society, the jungle or ''imbo'' are usually inhabited by mystical animals such as ''imeu'' or tiger. For the Rejang community, the tiger is seen as an ancestral incarnation, sacred and should not be hurt or killed. Tigers are seen as old relatives addressed as ''datuk'', ''ninik'' or ''puyang''.\n\n===Present day beliefs===\nAt present, many of the Rejang people embraces [[Islam]].

He also scored 18 goals in 16 appearances for England.\n\nA statue of Dean was unveiled outside [[Goodison Park]] in May 2001.

Dean's family on both sides hailed from [[Chester]]. He was the grandson of Ralph Brett, a train driver who drove the royal train during the reign of [[George V]]. Dean grew up as a supporter of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] thanks to the efforts of his father, William Sr., who took him to a match during the 1914\u20131915 title-winning season.\n\nDean's childhood coincided with the [[World War I|First World War]], and between the ages of 7 and 11 he delivered cow's milk to local families as part of the \"war effort: \"Well, it was war time you see, so you were grafting all the time.

Dean's father would later retire with the company.{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=10}}\n\nDean took a night job so that he could concentrate on his first love, football: \"The other two apprentice fitters, they didn't like the night job because there were too many bloody rats around there, coming out of the Anglo-Oil company and the Vacuum Oil Company &nbsp;... rats as big as whippets. So I took their night job, and of course, I could always have a game of football then.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> Dean would kick the trespassing rats against the wall.\n\nThe sons of Dean's manager at Wirral Railway were directors of [[New Brighton A.F.C.]], and they were interested in signing Dean. However, Dean told the club he was not interested in signing and instead played for local team Pensby United in [[Pensby, Merseyside|Pensby]]. It was at Pensby United where Dean attracted the attention of a Tranmere Rovers scout.<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/>\n\n===\"Dixie\" nickname===\nSome said that Dean and his family disliked his nickname, and preferred people to call him \"Bill\" or \"Billy\". The popular theory regarding how Dean acquired his nickname is that he did so in his youth, perhaps due to his dark complexion and hair (which bore a resemblance to people from the [[Southern United States]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/everton-fc/everton-dixie-dean/2007/01/23/footballing-world-wakes-up-to-dixie-100252-18518223/2/|title=Footballing world wakes up to Dixie|last=Prentice|first=David|date=23 January 2007|work=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=10 June 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In Dean's obituary in ''[[The Times]]'', [[Geoffrey Green]] suggested that the nickname was taken from a \"Dixie\" song that was popular during Dean's childhood; there was \"something of the [[Uncle Tom]] about his features\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Mr Dixie Dean|last=Green|first=Geoffrey|work=The Times|page=16}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, Tranmere Rovers club historian Gilbert Upton uncovered evidence, verified by Dean's late Godmother, that the name \"Dixie\" was a corruption of his childhood nickname, Digsy (acquired from his approach to the children's game of tag, where Dean would dig his fist into a girl's back\u2014 hence \"Digsy\").{{sfn|Upton|1992}}\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Tranmere Rovers===\nHe played football for Laird Street School, Moreton Bible Class, Heswell and Pensby United. He then joined the pro ranks with his local club, [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] in November 1923. He was 16 at the time.\n\nWhilst at Tranmere, he was on the receiving end of a tough challenge which resulted in him losing a [[testicle]] in a reserve game against [[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]].{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=8}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/18/seven-sins-football-wrath-part-two|title=The seven deadly sins of football: Wrath&nbsp;\u2013 From Big Jack Charlton to the fan's hand grenade at Millwall |date=18 May 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> Immediately following the challenge, a teammate rubbed the area to ease the pain. Dean shouted \"Don't rub 'em, count 'em!\".{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn his 16 months at Tranmere spanning seasons 1923/24 and 1924/25 he scored 27 goals in 30 league appearances. All 27 were in the second of those two seasons in which he averaged exactly a goal per game. His exploits attracted the interest of many clubs across England, including [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> Upon leaving Tranmere Rovers, secretary [[Bert Cooke]] reneged on an agreement to pay 10 percent of the transfer fee to Dean. Dean was paid one percent of the fee, which he gave to his parents (who donated it to [[Birkenhead General Hospital]]).\n\n===Everton===\nHis father had taken him to a league game at [[Goodison Park]] when he was eight years old. It was a dream come true for Dean when Everton secretary [[Thomas H. McIntosh]] arranged to meet him at the Woodside Hotel in 1925. Dean was so excited that he ran the {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} distance from his home in north Birkenhead to the riverside to meet him.<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> He signed for Everton in March 1925 having just turned 18.\n\nHe later revealed that he expected a \u00a3300 signing fee to be given to his parents when he transferred to Everton. They received only \u00a330, and Tranmere Rovers manager Bert Cooke told him \"that's all the League will allow\". Dean appealed to John McKenna, chairman of [[the Football Association]], but was told \"I'm afraid you've signed, and that's it.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> Dean signed for Everton for \u00a33,000, then a record fee received for Tranmere Rovers. He made an immediate impact, scoring 32 goals in his first full season. A motorcycling accident at [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]], [[North Wales]] in summer 1926 left Dean with a fractured skull and jaw, and doctors were unsure whether he would be able to play again. In his next game for Everton he scored using his head, leading Evertonians to joke that the doctor left a metal plate in Dean's head.\n\nDean's greatest point of note is that he is still the only player in English football to score 60 league goals in one season ([[1927-28 in English football|1927\u201328]]).<ref name=\"English League Leading Goalscorers 1889-2007\">{{cite web\n| title = English League Leading Goalscorers 1889\u20132007\n| url = http://rsssf.com/tablese/engtops.html\n| publisher = RSSSF\n| accessdate =14 August 2007}}</ref> At that season's end he was 21 years old. Middlesbrough's [[George Camsell]], who holds the highest goals-to-games ratio for England, had scored 59 league goals the previous season, although this was in the Second Division.\n\nIn that 1927-28 season Everton won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title. When they were relegated to [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1930 Dean stayed with them. The club went on to immediately win the Second Division in [[1930-31 in English football|1931]], followed by the First Division again in [[1931-32 in English football|1932]]. They then immediately won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1933 FA Cup Final|1933]] (in which he scored in the [[1933 FA Cup Final|final]]) \u2013 a sequence unmatched since.\n\nIn December 1933, Dean issued a public appeal to have stolen goods returned to him. ''[[The Times]]'' issued a statement: \"Dixie Dean, the Everton and England forward appeals to the thief who robbed him of an international cap and presentation clock to return them. His house in Caldy Road, Walton, Liverpool was entered in his absence over Christmas, and the thief left behind gold watches and jewelry (sic).\"<ref>{{cite news|title=News in brief|date=30 December 1933|work=The Times|page=7}}</ref> By then, Dean was captain of the side. However, the harsh physical demands of the game (as it was played then) took their toll and he was dropped from the first team in 1937.\n\n===Notts County===\nDean went on to play for [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] for one season, in which he scored three goals in nine games.\n\n===Sligo Rovers===\nAt age 32, Dean signed for Irish team Sligo Rovers in January 1939 to help the club in their FAI Cup campaign. On his arrival, the Railway station in [[Sligo]] was said to be filled with locals trying to catch a glimpse of him. Dean scored ten goals in seven games for the club,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/amateur-football/2009/12/09/the-cameo-that-shaped-seamus-100252-25354309/|title=The cameo that shaped Seamus|last=Randles|first=Dave|date=9 December 2009|publisher=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> including five in a 7\u20131 win over [[Waterford F.C.|Waterford]] (which remains a club record for the most goals scored in a single game). He also played in four Cup matches, scoring once (in the 1\u20131 final against [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]], who won the replay 1\u20130). Dean's runner-up medal was later stolen from his hotel room; on a return trip to Ireland to watch Rovers 39 years later in the 1978 [[FAI Cup]] final, a package was delivered to his hotel room with the medal inside.\n\n===Hurst===\nDean ended his professional playing days with [[Ashton United F.C.|Hurst]] (now [[Ashton United F.C.|Ashton United]]) in the [[Cheshire County League]] 1939\u201340 season, managing two games (and one goal) before the outbreak of war truncated his career. He made his debut in a 4\u20130 loss to [[Stalybridge Celtic F.C.|Stalybridge Celtic]]; 5,600 people attended the game, paying sixpence, earning the club gate receipts of \u00a3140.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashtonutd.com/dixiedean.htm|title=Dixie Dean|publisher=Ashton United|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nDean made his d\u00e9but for the [[England national football team]] against British rivals Wales at the [[Racecourse Ground]] in [[Wrexham]] in February 1927, less than a month after his 20th birthday. His final game for England came in a 1\u20130 victory over Ireland in October 1932 at [[Blackpool F.C.]]'s [[Bloomfield Road]], when Dean was 25 years old.\n\nDean was involved in the [[1927 British Home Championship|1927]] and [[1929 British Home Championship|1929]] editions of the [[British Home Championship]]. During the 1927 edition, Dean scored four goals in his two games for England and scored twice against Scotland at Hampden Park. Despite the loss, the Scots won the competition overall and applauded Dean (who finished the tournament as top scorer). In the 1929 edition, he scored in his only outing against Ireland at Goodison Park.\n\nThe only international competitions outside the British Home Championship during Dean's international career were the 1928 and 1936 Olympic Games and the inaugural [[FIFA World Cup]], which took place in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]]; however, neither [[Great Britain national football team|Great Britain]] nor England participated. Dean represented England 16 times, scoring 18 goals in 8 games (including [[hat-trick]]s against Belgium and Luxembourg).\n\n[[Image:dixie-dean-wix-cigarettes.png|thumb|150px|right|alt=Dean. arms folded, in 1928 Wix Cigarettes newspaper advertisement|Dean in 1928 newspaper advertisement for Wix Cigarettes]]\n\n==Personal life and post-football career==\nDean became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] in 1931 while playing for Everton and England.

March 1980) was an English [[association football|footballer]] who played as a centre forward.\n\nBorn in [[Birkenhead]], he began his career at his hometown club [[Tranmere Rovers]] before moving on to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], the club he had supported as a child. He was particularly known for scoring goals with his head. Dean played the majority of his career at Everton before injuries caught up with him and he moved on to new challenges at [[Notts County]]. He is best known for his exploits during the 1927\u201328 season, which saw him score a record 60 league goals. He also scored 18 goals in 16 appearances for England.\n\nA statue of Dean was unveiled outside [[Goodison Park]] in May 2001. A year later, he became one of 22 players inducted into the inaugural [[English Football Hall of Fame]]. Dean was the first Everton player to wear the number-9 shirt, which in later years would become iconic at the club.\n\n==Early years==\nDean was born at 313 Laird Street in [[Birkenhead]], [[Cheshire]], across the [[River Mersey]] from [[Liverpool]]. Dean's family on both sides hailed from [[Chester]]. He was the grandson of Ralph Brett, a train driver who drove the royal train during the reign of [[George V]]. Dean grew up as a supporter of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] thanks to the efforts of his father, William Sr., who took him to a match during the 1914\u20131915 title-winning season.\n\nDean's childhood coincided with the [[World War I|First World War]], and between the ages of 7 and 11 he delivered cow's milk to local families as part of the \"war effort: \"Well, it was war time you see, so you were grafting all the time. I used to take milk out. I'd be up at half-past four in the morning and go down and get the ponies and the milk floats, then I'd come out to this place in Upton, between [[Upton, Merseyside|Upton]] and [[Arrowe Park]], and Burgess' Farm was there. We used to collect the milk in the big urns and take it out to people's houses, serving it out of the ladle. And not only that, you had an allotment, and that was in school time. And there was no such thing as pinching and stealing and all that bloody caper. In those days, you were growing all that stuff and you needed it for the war time.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingintelligence.com/2010/03/09/dixie-dean-i-never-had-any-lessons-at-school-no-maths-no-english-nothing-except-football/|title=Interview with John Roberts|last=Roberts|first=John|publisher=SportingIntelligence.com|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nDean attended Laird Street School,{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=10}} but felt he received no formal education: \"My only lesson was football&nbsp;... I used to give the pens out on Friday afternoons&nbsp;... the ink, and the chalks. That was the only job I had in school&nbsp;... I never had any lessons.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> When he turned 11 he attended Albert (Memorial) Industrial School, a [[borstal]] school in Birkenhead, because of the football facilities on offer. The Dean family home had little room for him due to the family's size; Dean was happy with the arrangement, since he could play on the school's football team.{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=10}} Dean falsely told fellow pupils he had been caught stealing, since he wanted to be \"one of the boys\".{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nHe left school at 14 and worked for [[Wirral Railway]] as an apprentice fitter; his father also worked there, and had been working since he was 11 years old<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> for [[Great Western Railway]]. The elder Dean later became a train driver before moving to Birkenhead to work for Wirral Railway, to be closer to his future wife (and William Jr.'s mother) Sarah. Dean's father would later retire with the company.{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=10}}\n\nDean took a night job so that he could concentrate on his first love, football: \"The other two apprentice fitters, they didn't like the night job because there were too many bloody rats around there, coming out of the Anglo-Oil company and the Vacuum Oil Company &nbsp;... rats as big as whippets. So I took their night job, and of course, I could always have a game of football then.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> Dean would kick the trespassing rats against the wall.\n\nThe sons of Dean's manager at Wirral Railway were directors of [[New Brighton A.F.C.]], and they were interested in signing Dean. However, Dean told the club he was not interested in signing and instead played for local team Pensby United in [[Pensby, Merseyside|Pensby]]. It was at Pensby United where Dean attracted the attention of a Tranmere Rovers scout.<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/>\n\n===\"Dixie\" nickname===\nSome said that Dean and his family disliked his nickname, and preferred people to call him \"Bill\" or \"Billy\". The popular theory regarding how Dean acquired his nickname is that he did so in his youth, perhaps due to his dark complexion and hair (which bore a resemblance to people from the [[Southern United States]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/everton-fc/everton-dixie-dean/2007/01/23/footballing-world-wakes-up-to-dixie-100252-18518223/2/|title=Footballing world wakes up to Dixie|last=Prentice|first=David|date=23 January 2007|work=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=10 June 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In Dean's obituary in ''[[The Times]]'', [[Geoffrey Green]] suggested that the nickname was taken from a \"Dixie\" song that was popular during Dean's childhood; there was \"something of the [[Uncle Tom]] about his features\".<ref>{{cite news|title=Mr Dixie Dean|last=Green|first=Geoffrey|work=The Times|page=16}}</ref>\n\nAlternatively, Tranmere Rovers club historian Gilbert Upton uncovered evidence, verified by Dean's late Godmother, that the name \"Dixie\" was a corruption of his childhood nickname, Digsy (acquired from his approach to the children's game of tag, where Dean would dig his fist into a girl's back\u2014 hence \"Digsy\").{{sfn|Upton|1992}}\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Tranmere Rovers===\nHe played football for Laird Street School, Moreton Bible Class, Heswell and Pensby United. He then joined the pro ranks with his local club, [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] in November 1923. He was 16 at the time.\n\nWhilst at Tranmere, he was on the receiving end of a tough challenge which resulted in him losing a [[testicle]] in a reserve game against [[Altrincham F.C.|Altrincham]].{{sfn|Keith|2003|p=8}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/may/18/seven-sins-football-wrath-part-two|title=The seven deadly sins of football: Wrath&nbsp;\u2013 From Big Jack Charlton to the fan's hand grenade at Millwall |date=18 May 2009|work=The Guardian|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> Immediately following the challenge, a teammate rubbed the area to ease the pain. Dean shouted \"Don't rub 'em, count 'em!\".{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\nIn his 16 months at Tranmere spanning seasons 1923/24 and 1924/25 he scored 27 goals in 30 league appearances. All 27 were in the second of those two seasons in which he averaged exactly a goal per game. His exploits attracted the interest of many clubs across England, including [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]].<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> Upon leaving Tranmere Rovers, secretary [[Bert Cooke]] reneged on an agreement to pay 10 percent of the transfer fee to Dean. Dean was paid one percent of the fee, which he gave to his parents (who donated it to [[Birkenhead General Hospital]]).\n\n===Everton===\nHis father had taken him to a league game at [[Goodison Park]] when he was eight years old. It was a dream come true for Dean when Everton secretary [[Thomas H. McIntosh]] arranged to meet him at the Woodside Hotel in 1925. Dean was so excited that he ran the {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} distance from his home in north Birkenhead to the riverside to meet him.<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> He signed for Everton in March 1925 having just turned 18.\n\nHe later revealed that he expected a \u00a3300 signing fee to be given to his parents when he transferred to Everton. They received only \u00a330, and Tranmere Rovers manager Bert Cooke told him \"that's all the League will allow\". Dean appealed to John McKenna, chairman of [[the Football Association]], but was told \"I'm afraid you've signed, and that's it.\"<ref name=\"john-roberts-interview\"/> Dean signed for Everton for \u00a33,000, then a record fee received for Tranmere Rovers. He made an immediate impact, scoring 32 goals in his first full season. A motorcycling accident at [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]], [[North Wales]] in summer 1926 left Dean with a fractured skull and jaw, and doctors were unsure whether he would be able to play again. In his next game for Everton he scored using his head, leading Evertonians to joke that the doctor left a metal plate in Dean's head.\n\nDean's greatest point of note is that he is still the only player in English football to score 60 league goals in one season ([[1927-28 in English football|1927\u201328]]).<ref name=\"English League Leading Goalscorers 1889-2007\">{{cite web\n| title = English League Leading Goalscorers 1889\u20132007\n| url = http://rsssf.com/tablese/engtops.html\n| publisher = RSSSF\n| accessdate =14 August 2007}}</ref> At that season's end he was 21 years old. Middlesbrough's [[George Camsell]], who holds the highest goals-to-games ratio for England, had scored 59 league goals the previous season, although this was in the Second Division.\n\nIn that 1927-28 season Everton won the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] title. When they were relegated to [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1930 Dean stayed with them. The club went on to immediately win the Second Division in [[1930-31 in English football|1931]], followed by the First Division again in [[1931-32 in English football|1932]]. They then immediately won the [[FA Cup]] in [[1933 FA Cup Final|1933]] (in which he scored in the [[1933 FA Cup Final|final]]) \u2013 a sequence unmatched since.\n\nIn December 1933, Dean issued a public appeal to have stolen goods returned to him. ''[[The Times]]'' issued a statement: \"Dixie Dean, the Everton and England forward appeals to the thief who robbed him of an international cap and presentation clock to return them. His house in Caldy Road, Walton, Liverpool was entered in his absence over Christmas, and the thief left behind gold watches and jewelry (sic).\"<ref>{{cite news|title=News in brief|date=30 December 1933|work=The Times|page=7}}</ref> By then, Dean was captain of the side. However, the harsh physical demands of the game (as it was played then) took their toll and he was dropped from the first team in 1937.\n\n===Notts County===\nDean went on to play for [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] for one season, in which he scored three goals in nine games.\n\n===Sligo Rovers===\nAt age 32, Dean signed for Irish team Sligo Rovers in January 1939 to help the club in their FAI Cup campaign. On his arrival, the Railway station in [[Sligo]] was said to be filled with locals trying to catch a glimpse of him. Dean scored ten goals in seven games for the club,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/amateur-football/2009/12/09/the-cameo-that-shaped-seamus-100252-25354309/|title=The cameo that shaped Seamus|last=Randles|first=Dave|date=9 December 2009|publisher=Liverpool Echo|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref> including five in a 7\u20131 win over [[Waterford F.C.|Waterford]] (which remains a club record for the most goals scored in a single game). He also played in four Cup matches, scoring once (in the 1\u20131 final against [[Shelbourne F.C.|Shelbourne]], who won the replay 1\u20130). Dean's runner-up medal was later stolen from his hotel room; on a return trip to Ireland to watch Rovers 39 years later in the 1978 [[FAI Cup]] final, a package was delivered to his hotel room with the medal inside.\n\n===Hurst===\nDean ended his professional playing days with [[Ashton United F.C.|Hurst]] (now [[Ashton United F.C.|Ashton United]]) in the [[Cheshire County League]] 1939\u201340 season, managing two games (and one goal) before the outbreak of war truncated his career. He made his debut in a 4\u20130 loss to [[Stalybridge Celtic F.C.|Stalybridge Celtic]]; 5,600 people attended the game, paying sixpence, earning the club gate receipts of \u00a3140.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ashtonutd.com/dixiedean.htm|title=Dixie Dean|publisher=Ashton United|accessdate=9 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nDean made his d\u00e9but for the [[England national football team]] against British rivals Wales at the [[Racecourse Ground]] in [[Wrexham]] in February 1927, less than a month after his 20th birthday. His final game for England came in a 1\u20130 victory over Ireland in October 1932 at [[Blackpool F.C.]]'s [[Bloomfield Road]], when Dean was 25 years old.\n\nDean was involved in the [[1927 British Home Championship|1927]] and [[1929 British Home Championship|1929]] editions of the [[British Home Championship]]. During the 1927 edition, Dean scored four goals in his two games for England and scored twice against Scotland at Hampden Park. Despite the loss, the Scots won the competition overall and applauded Dean (who finished the tournament as top scorer). In the 1929 edition, he scored in his only outing against Ireland at Goodison Park.\n\nThe only international competitions outside the British Home Championship during Dean's international career were the 1928 and 1936 Olympic Games and the inaugural [[FIFA World Cup]], which took place in [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]]; however, neither [[Great Britain national football team|Great Britain]] nor England participated. Dean represented England 16 times, scoring 18 goals in 8 games (including [[hat-trick]]s against Belgium and Luxembourg).\n\n[[Image:dixie-dean-wix-cigarettes.png|thumb|150px|right|alt=Dean. arms folded, in 1928 Wix Cigarettes newspaper advertisement|Dean in 1928 newspaper advertisement for Wix Cigarettes]]\n\n==Personal life and post-football career==\nDean became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] in 1931 while playing for Everton and England.

See Audie Murphy talk page: Archive #1 \u00a722--> was an American soldier, actor, songwriter, and rancher. He was one of the most decorated [[United States|American]] combat soldiers of [[World War II]].<!-- LEAVE THIS ALONE! Do not change to \"most decorated\". Do not edit war over this wording. See Audie Murphy talk page: discussions on all talk page archives, all reviews.  --> He received every military combat award for valor available from the [[U.S. Army]], as well as French and Belgian awards for heroism. Murphy received the [[Medal of Honor]] for valor that he demonstrated at the age of 19 for single-handedly holding off a company of German soldiers for an hour at the [[Colmar Pocket]] in France in January 1945, then leading a successful counterattack while wounded and out of ammunition.\n\nMurphy was born into a large family of [[sharecroppers]] in [[Hunt County, Texas]]. His father abandoned them, and his mother died when he was a teenager. Murphy left school in fifth grade to pick [[cotton]] and find other work to help support his family; his skill with a hunting rifle helped feed his family.\n\nAfter the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, Murphy's older sister helped him to falsify documentation about his birthdate in order to meet the minimum-age requirement for enlisting in the military. Turned down initially for being underweight by the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]] and the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], he eventually was able to enlist in the Army. He first saw action in the 1943 [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]; then in 1944 he participated in the [[Battle of Anzio]], the liberation of Rome, and the [[Operation Dragoon|invasion of southern France]]. Murphy fought at [[Mont\u00e9limar]] and led his men on a successful assault at the L'Omet quarry near [[Cleurie]] in northeastern France in October.\n\nAfter the war, Murphy embarked on a 21-year acting career. He played himself in the 1955 autobiographical film ''[[To Hell and Back (film)|To Hell and Back]]'', based on his 1949 memoirs of the same name, but most of his roles were in [[Western (genre)|westerns]]. He made guest appearances on celebrity television shows and starred in the series ''[[Whispering Smith (TV series)|Whispering Smith]]''. Murphy was a fairly accomplished songwriter. He bred [[American Quarter Horse|quarter horses]] in California and Arizona, and became a regular participant in horse racing.\n\nSuffering from what would today be described as [[post traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), Murphy slept with a loaded handgun under his pillow. He looked for solace in addictive sleeping pills. In his last few years, he was plagued by money problems but refused offers to appear in alcohol and cigarette commercials because he did not want to set a bad example. Murphy died in a plane crash in Virginia in 1971, which was shortly before his 46th birthday. He was interred with military honors at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], where his grave is one of the most visited.\n\n==Early life==\nMurphy was the seventh of twelve children born to Emmett Berry Murphy and his wife Josie Bell Killian in [[Kingston, Texas]].{{refn|group=ALM|name=birth|Murphy's son Terry is the President of the Audie Murphy Research Foundation, which in both its biographical sketch and Murphy Family Tree list his year of birth as 1925.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Audie L.

She had the most beautiful hair I've ever seen. It reached almost to the floor. She rarely talked; and always seemed to be searching for something. What it was I don't know.

After the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, he tried to enlist,{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=7}} but the Army, Navy and Marine Corps all turned him down for being underweight and underage. After his sister provided an [[affidavit]] that falsified his birth date by a year, he was accepted by the U.S. Army on 30 June 1942.{{refn|group=ALM|name=birth}}{{refn|group=ALM|name=weight|Conflicting information exists as to Murphy's date and place of enlistment. The Audie L. Murphy Memorial website has scanned documents from the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration that include Corinne Burns' statement and Murphy's \"Induction Record\", which shows him \"Enlisted at Dallas, Texas\" on 30 June 1942, and the line above it says \"Accepted for service at Greenville, Texas\". The National Register of Historic Places Listing added the Greenville post office as historic site number 74002081 in 1974, citing it as Murphy's place of enlistment, possibly referring to the act the military termed \"Accepted for service\". The NRHP also shows his enlistment date as 20 June 1942 which might be the date he was accepted for service.{{sfn|Tate|2006|pp=152\u201363}}<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Audie L.

See Audie Murphy talk page: Archive #1 \u00a722--> was an American soldier, actor, songwriter, and rancher. He was one of the most decorated [[United States|American]] combat soldiers of [[World War II]].<!-- LEAVE THIS ALONE! Do not change to \"most decorated\". Do not edit war over this wording. See Audie Murphy talk page: discussions on all talk page archives, all reviews.  --> He received every military combat award for valor available from the [[U.S. Army]], as well as French and Belgian awards for heroism. Murphy received the [[Medal of Honor]] for valor that he demonstrated at the age of 19 for single-handedly holding off a company of German soldiers for an hour at the [[Colmar Pocket]] in France in January 1945, then leading a successful counterattack while wounded and out of ammunition.\n\nMurphy was born into a large family of [[sharecroppers]] in [[Hunt County, Texas]]. His father abandoned them, and his mother died when he was a teenager. Murphy left school in fifth grade to pick [[cotton]] and find other work to help support his family; his skill with a hunting rifle helped feed his family.\n\nAfter the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941, Murphy's older sister helped him to falsify documentation about his birthdate in order to meet the minimum-age requirement for enlisting in the military. Turned down initially for being underweight by the [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]] and the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]], he eventually was able to enlist in the Army. He first saw action in the 1943 [[Allied invasion of Sicily]]; then in 1944 he participated in the [[Battle of Anzio]], the liberation of Rome, and the [[Operation Dragoon|invasion of southern France]]. Murphy fought at [[Mont\u00e9limar]] and led his men on a successful assault at the L'Omet quarry near [[Cleurie]] in northeastern France in October.\n\nAfter the war, Murphy embarked on a 21-year acting career. He played himself in the 1955 autobiographical film ''[[To Hell and Back (film)|To Hell and Back]]'', based on his 1949 memoirs of the same name, but most of his roles were in [[Western (genre)|westerns]]. He made guest appearances on celebrity television shows and starred in the series ''[[Whispering Smith (TV series)|Whispering Smith]]''. Murphy was a fairly accomplished songwriter. He bred [[American Quarter Horse|quarter horses]] in California and Arizona, and became a regular participant in horse racing.\n\nSuffering from what would today be described as [[post traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD), Murphy slept with a loaded handgun under his pillow. He looked for solace in addictive sleeping pills. In his last few years, he was plagued by money problems but refused offers to appear in alcohol and cigarette commercials because he did not want to set a bad example. Murphy died in a plane crash in Virginia in 1971, which was shortly before his 46th birthday. He was interred with military honors at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], where his grave is one of the most visited.\n\n==Early life==\nMurphy was the seventh of twelve children born to Emmett Berry Murphy and his wife Josie Bell Killian in [[Kingston, Texas]].{{refn|group=ALM|name=birth|Murphy's son Terry is the President of the Audie Murphy Research Foundation, which in both its biographical sketch and Murphy Family Tree list his year of birth as 1925.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Audie L.

She had the most beautiful hair I've ever seen. It reached almost to the floor. She rarely talked; and always seemed to be searching for something. What it was I don't know.

After the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, he tried to enlist,{{sfn|Murphy|2002|p=7}} but the Army, Navy and Marine Corps all turned him down for being underweight and underage. After his sister provided an [[affidavit]] that falsified his birth date by a year, he was accepted by the U.S. Army on 30 June 1942.{{refn|group=ALM|name=birth}}{{refn|group=ALM|name=weight|Conflicting information exists as to Murphy's date and place of enlistment. The Audie L. Murphy Memorial website has scanned documents from the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration that include Corinne Burns' statement and Murphy's \"Induction Record\", which shows him \"Enlisted at Dallas, Texas\" on 30 June 1942, and the line above it says \"Accepted for service at Greenville, Texas\". The National Register of Historic Places Listing added the Greenville post office as historic site number 74002081 in 1974, citing it as Murphy's place of enlistment, possibly referring to the act the military termed \"Accepted for service\". The NRHP also shows his enlistment date as 20 June 1942 which might be the date he was accepted for service.{{sfn|Tate|2006|pp=152\u201363}}<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Audie L.
