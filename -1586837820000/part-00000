{"title_page": "Neutron detection", "text_new": "{{Science with neutrons}}\n'''Neutron detection''' is the effective detection of [[neutron]]s entering a well-positioned [[detector]]. There are two key aspects to effective neutron detection: hardware and software. Detection hardware refers to the kind of neutron detector used (the most common today is the [[Scintillation counter|scintillation detector]]) and to the electronics used in the detection setup. Further, the hardware setup also defines key experimental parameters, such as source-detector distance, [[solid angle]] and detector shielding. Detection software consists of analysis tools that perform tasks such as graphical analysis to measure the number and energies of neutrons striking the detector.\n\n==Basic physics==\n\n===Signatures by which a neutron may be detected===\nAtomic and subatomic particles are detected by the signature they produce through interaction with their surroundings. The interactions result from the particles' fundamental characteristics.\n* Charge: Neutrons are neutral particles and do not ionize directly; hence they are harder than charged particles to detect directly. Further, their paths of motion are only weakly affected by electric and magnetic fields.\n* Mass: The neutron mass of {{val|1.0086649156|(6)|ul=u}}<ref name=RPP>[http://pdg.lbl.gov/2006/tables/bxxx.pdf Particle Data Group's Review of Particle Physics 2006]</ref> is not directly detectable, but does influence reactions through which it can be detected.\n* Reactions: Neutrons react with a number of materials through [[elastic scattering]] producing a recoiling nucleus, [[inelastic scattering]] producing an excited nucleus, or absorption with transmutation of the resulting nucleus. Most detection approaches rely on detecting the various reaction products.\n* Magnetic moment: Although neutrons have a [[neutron magnetic moment|magnetic moment]] of {{val|-1.9130427|(5)}}&nbsp;[[Nuclear magneton|\u03bc<sub>N</sub>]], techniques for detection of the magnetic moment are too insensitive to use for neutron detection.\n* Electric dipole moment: The neutron is predicted to have only a tiny [[Neutron electric dipole moment|electric dipole moment]], which has not yet been detected. Hence it is not a viable detection signature.\n* Decay: Outside the nucleus, free neutrons are unstable and have a [[mean lifetime]] of {{val|885.7|0.8|u=s}} (about 14 minutes, 46 seconds).<ref name=\"RPP\"/> Free neutrons decay by emission of an electron and an electron antineutrino to become a proton, a process known as [[beta decay]]:<ref>[http://pdg.lbl.gov/2007/tables/bxxx.pdf Particle Data Group Summary Data Table on Baryons]</ref>\n:::{{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0}} \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino}}.\n:Although the {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} produced by neutron decay are detectable, the decay rate is too low to serve as the basis for a practical detector system.\n\n===Classic neutron detection options===\nAs a result of these properties, detection of neutrons fall into several major categories:<ref name=Tsoul>{{Cite book | last = Tsoulfanidis | first = Nicholas | title = Measurement and Detection of Radiation | publisher = Taylor & Francis | year = 1995|edition=2nd | location = Washington, D.C. | pages =467\u2013501 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1-56032-317-4 }}</ref>\n\n*Absorptive reactions with prompt reactions - low energy neutrons are typically detected indirectly through absorption reactions. Typical absorber materials used have high [[Cross section (physics)|cross sections]] for absorption of neutrons and include [[helium-3]], [[lithium-6]], [[boron-10]], and [[uranium-235]]. Each of these reacts by emission of high energy ionized particles, the [[Particle identification#Specific ionization|ionization track]] of which can be detected by a number of means.  Commonly used reactions include <sup>3</sup>He(n,p) <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>6</sup>Li(n,t) <sup>4</sup>He, <sup>10</sup>B(n,\u03b1) <sup>7</sup>Li and the fission of uranium.<ref name=Tsoul/>\n*Activation processes - Neutrons may be detected by reacting with absorbers in a [[Neutron capture|radiative capture]], [[Spallation#Nuclear spallation|spallation]] or similar reaction, producing reaction products that then decay at some later time, releasing [[beta particle]]s or [[gamma ray|gamma]]s. Selected materials (e.g., [[indium]], [[gold]], [[rhodium]], [[iron]] (<sup>56</sup>Fe(n,p)\u2009<sup>56</sup>Mn), [[aluminum]] (<sup>27</sup>Al(n,\u03b1)<sup>24</sup>Na),\u2009[[niobium]] (<sup>93</sup>Nb(n,2n)\u2009<sup>92m</sup>Nb), & [[silicon]] (<sup>28</sup>Si(n,p) <sup>28</sup>Al)) have extremely large cross sections for the capture of neutrons within a very narrow band of energy. Use of multiple absorber samples allows characterization of the neutron energy spectrum. Activation also allows recreation of an historic neutron exposure (e.g., forensic recreation of neutron exposures during an [[criticality accident|accidental criticality]]).<ref name=Tsoul/>\n*Elastic scattering reactions (also referred to as proton-recoil) - High energy neutrons are typically detected indirectly through [[elastic scattering]] reactions. Neutrons collide with the nuclei of atoms in the detector, transferring energy to those nuclei and creating ions, which are detected. Since the maximum transfer of energy occurs when the mass of the atom with which the neutron collides is comparable to the neutron mass, hydrogenous<ref>Materials with a high hydrogen content such as water or plastic</ref> materials are often the preferred medium for such detectors.<ref name=Tsoul/>\n\n==Types of neutron detectors==\n\n===Gas proportional detectors===\n[[Proportional counter|Gas proportional detectors]] can be adapted to detect neutrons. While neutrons do not typically cause [[ionization]], the addition of a [[nuclide]] with high [[neutron cross-section]] allows the detector to respond to neutrons. Nuclides commonly used for this purpose are [[helium-3]], [[lithium-6]], [[boron|boron-10]] and [[uranium-235]]. Since these materials are most likely to react with [[Thermal neutron#Thermal neutrons|thermal neutron]]s (i.e., neutrons that have slowed to equilibrium with their surroundings), they are typically surrounded by [[Neutron moderator|moderating materials]] to reduce their energy and increase the likelihood of detection.\n\nFurther refinements are usually necessary to differentiate the neutron signal from the effects of other types of radiation. Since the energy of a thermal neutron is relatively low, charged particle reactions are discrete (i.e., essentially monoenergetic and lie within a narrow bandwidth of energies) while other reactions such as gamma reactions will span a broad energy range, it is possible to discriminate among the sources.\n\nAs a class, gas ionization detectors measure the number ([[counts per second|count rate]]), and not the energy of neutrons.\n\n====<sup>3</sup>He gas-filled proportional detectors====\nAn isotope of Helium, <sup>3</sup>He provides for an effective neutron detector material because <sup>3</sup>He reacts by absorbing thermal neutrons, producing a <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>3</sup>H ion. Its sensitivity to gamma rays is negligible, providing a very useful neutron detector. Unfortunately the supply of <sup>3</sup>He is limited to production as a byproduct from the decay of tritium (which has a 12.3 year half-life); tritium is produced either as part of weapons programs as a booster for nuclear weapons or as a byproduct of reactor operation.\n\n====BF<sub>3</sub> gas-filled proportional detectors====\nAs elemental boron is not gaseous, neutron detectors containing boron may alternately use [[boron trifluoride]] (BF<sub>3</sub>) enriched to 96% boron-10 (natural boron is 20% <sup>10</sup>B, 80% <sup>11</sup>B).<ref>[http://www.orau.org/PTP/collection/proportional%20counters/bf3info.htm Boron Trifluoride (BF<sub>3</sub>) Neutron Detectors<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Boron trifluoride is highly toxic.\nThe sensitivity of this detector is around 35-40 CPS/nv whereas that of Boron lined is about 4 CPS/nv. This is because in Boron lined, n reacts with Boron and hence produce ion pairs inside the layer. Hence charged particles produced (Alpha and Li) they lose some of their energy inside that layer. Low energy charged particles are unable to reach the Ionization chamber's gas environment. Hence, the number of ionizations produced in gas is also lower.\n\nWhereas In BF3 gas filled, N reacts with B in gas. and fully energetic Alpha and Li are able to produce more ionizations and give more pulses.\n\n====Boron lined proportional detectors====\nAlternately, boron-lined gas-filled proportional counters react similarly to BF<sub>3</sub> gas-filled proportional detectors, with the exception that the walls are coated with <sup>10</sup>B. In this design, since the reaction takes place on the surface, only one of the two particles will escape into the proportional counter.\n\n===Scintillation neutron detectors===\n\nScintillation neutron detectors include liquid organic scintillators,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Yousuke | first = I. | authorlink = |author2=Daiki, S. |author3=Hirohiko, K. |author4=Nobuhiro, S. |author5=Kenji, I. | title = Deterioration of pulse-shape discrimination in liquid organic scintillator at high energies | journal = Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record | volume = 1| issue = | pages = 6/219\u20136/221 | publisher = IEEE | location = | year = 2000 | url = | doi = 10.1109/NSSMIC.2000.949173 | id = | isbn = 978-0-7803-6503-2 }}</ref> crystals,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Kawaguchi | first = N. | authorlink = |author2=Yanagida, T. |author3=Yokota, Y. |author4=Watanabe, K. |author5=Kamada, K. |author6=Fukuda, K. |author7=Suyama, T. |author8= Yoshikawa, A.  | title = Study of crystal growth and scintillation properties as a neutron detector of 2-inch diameter eu doped LiCaAlF6 single crystal | journal = Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record | volume = | issue = | pages = 1493\u20131495 | publisher = IEEE | location = | year = 2009 | url = | doi = 10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5402299 | id = | isbn = 978-1-4244-3961-4 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.quantumdetectors.com/products/isis-neutron-beam-monitor Example crystal scintillator based neutron monitor.]</ref> plastics, glass<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Bollinger | first = L.

The <sup>6</sup>Li has a high cross-section for thermal neutron absorption through the <sup>6</sup>Li(n,\u03b1) reaction. Neutron absorption produces a tritium ion, an alpha particle, and kinetic energy. The alpha particle and triton interact with the glass matrix to produce ionization, which transfers energy to Ce<sup>3+</sup> ions and results in the emission of photons with wavelength 390&nbsp;nm - 600&nbsp;nm as the excited state Ce<sup>3+</sup> ions return to the ground state. The event results in a flash of light of several thousand photons for each neutron absorbed. A portion of the scintillation light propagates through the glass fiber, which acts as a waveguide. The fibers ends are optically coupled to a pair of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to detect photon bursts. The detectors can be used to detect both neutrons and gamma rays, which are typically distinguished using pulse-height discrimination. Substantial effort and progress in reducing fiber detector sensitivity to gamma radiation has been made. Original detectors suffered from false neutrons in a 0.02 mR gamma field. Design, process, and algorithm improvements now enable operation in gamma fields up to 20 mR/h (<sup>60</sup>Co).\n\nThe scintillating fiber detectors have excellent sensitivity, they are rugged, and have fast timing (~60 ns) so that a large dynamic range in counting rates is possible. The detectors have the advantage that they can be formed into any desired shape, and can be made very large or very small for use in a variety of applications.<ref name=\"GinhovenKouzes2009\">{{Cite journal | last = Van Ginhoven | first = R.

However, these semiconductor materials are designed for use as gamma-ray spectrometers and, hence, are intrinsically sensitive to the gamma-ray background.  With adequate energy resolution, pulse height discrimination can be used to separate the prompt gamma-ray emissions from neutron interactions.  However, the effective neutron detection efficiency is compromised because of the relatively small Compton ratio.  In other words, the majority of events add to the Compton continuum rather than to the full energy peak, thus, making discrimination between neutrons and background gamma rays difficult.  Also, both natural Cd and Hg have relatively large thermal-neutron (n,\u03b3) cross sections of 2444 b and 369.8 b, respectively. Consequently, most thermal neutrons are absorbed near the detector surface so that nearly half of the prompt gamma rays are emitted in directions away from the detector bulk and, thus, produce poor gamma-ray reabsorption or interaction efficiency.\n\n===Neutron activation detectors===\nActivation samples may be placed in a neutron field to characterize the energy spectrum and intensity of the neutrons.

Most neutron detectors used in thermal-spectrum nuclear reactors are optimized to detect [[thermal neutron]]s. \n*Plasma physics: Neutron detection is used in fusion plasma physics experiments such as [[Joint European Torus|JET]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Frenje|first=J.|chapter=The MPR Neutron Diagnostic at Jet \u2014 An ITER Prototype Study|date=1996|pages=417\u2013420|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9781461380207|doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-0369-5_49|title=Diagnostics for Experimental Thermonuclear Fusion Reactors}}</ref> For example, the detected neutron rate from a plasma can give information about the ion temperature.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Principles of plasma diagnostics |last=Hutchinson |first=I.

Neutron detectors used for radiation safety must take into account the [[relative biological effectiveness]] (i.e., the way damage caused by neutrons varies with energy).\n*Cosmic ray detection: Secondary neutrons are one component of [[particle shower]]s produced in Earth's atmosphere by [[cosmic ray]]s. Dedicated ground-level neutron detectors, namely [[neutron monitor]]s, are employed to monitor variations in cosmic ray flux.\n*Special nuclear material detection: [[Special nuclear material]]s (SNM) such as [[uranium-233]] and [[plutonium-239]] decay by [[spontaneous fission]], yielding neutrons. Neutrons detectors can be used for monitor for SNM in commerce.\n\n==Experimental neutron detection==\n\nExperiments that make use of this science include scattering experiments in which neutrons directed and then scattered from a sample are to be detected. Facilities include the [[ISIS neutron source]] at the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]], the [[Spallation Neutron Source]] at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], and the [[Paul Scherrer Institute#Spallation Neutron Source .28SINQ.29|Spallation Neutron Source (SINQ)]] at the [[Paul Scherrer Institute]], in which the neutrons are produced by spallation reaction, and the traditional research reactor facilities in which neutrons are produced during fission of uranium isotopes. Noteworthy among the various neutron detection experiments is the trademark experiment of the [[European Muon Collaboration]], first performed at [[CERN]] and now termed the \"EMC experiment.\" The same experiment is performed today with more sophisticated equipment to obtain more definite results related to the original [[EMC effect]].\n\n=== Challenges in neutron detection in an experimental environment===\n\nNeutron detection in an experimental environment is not an easy science. The major challenges faced by modern-day neutron detection include [[background noise]], high detection rates, neutron neutrality, and low neutron energies.\n\n==== Background noise ====\n\nThe main components of background noise in neutron detection are high-energy [[photon]]s, which aren't easily eliminated by physical barriers. The other sources of noise, such as [[alpha particle|alpha]] and [[beta particle]]s, can be eliminated by various shielding materials, such as [[lead]], plastic, thermo-coal, etc. Thus, photons cause major interference in neutron detection, since it is uncertain if neutrons or photons are being detected by the neutron detector. Both register similar energies after scattering into the detector from the target or ambient light, and are thus hard to distinguish. [[Coincidence circuit|Coincidence]] detection can also be used to discriminate real neutron events from photons and other radiation.\n\n==== High detection rates ====\n\nIf the detector lies in a region of high beam activity, it is hit continuously by neutrons and background noise at overwhelmingly high rates. This obfuscates collected data, since there is extreme overlap in measurement, and separate events are not easily distinguished from each other. Thus, part of the challenge lies in keeping detection rates as low as possible and in designing a detector that can keep up with the high rates to yield coherent data.\n\n==== Neutrality of neutrons ====\n\nNeutrons are neutral and thus do not respond to electric fields. This makes it hard to direct their course towards a detector to facilitate detection. Neutrons also do not ionize atoms except by direct collision, so [[gaseous ionization detector]]s are ineffective.\n\n==== Varying behavior with energy ====\n\nDetectors relying on neutron absorption are generally more sensitive to low-energy [[thermal neutron]]s, and are orders of magnitude less sensitive to high-energy neutrons. [[Scintillation detectors]], on the other hand, have trouble registering the impacts of low-energy neutrons.\n\n=== Experimental setup and method ===\n[[Image:Setup.png|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Figure 1: The experimental setup]]\nFigure 1 shows the typical main components of the setup of a neutron detection unit. In principle, the diagram shows the setup as it would be in any modern [[particle physics]] lab, but the specifics describe the setup in [[Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility|Jefferson Lab]] ([[Newport News, Virginia]]).\n\nIn this setup, the incoming particles, comprising neutrons and photons, strike the neutron detector; this is typically a scintillation detector consisting of [[scintillating material]], a [[waveguide]], and a [[photomultiplier]] tube (PMT), and will be connected to a data acquisition (DAQ) system to register detection details.\n\nThe detection signal from the neutron detector is connected to the scaler unit, gated delay unit, trigger unit and the [[oscilloscope]]. The scaler unit is merely used to count the number of incoming particles or events. It does so by incrementing its tally of particles every time it detects a surge in the detector signal from the zero-point. There is very little [[dead time]] in this unit, implying that no matter how fast particles are coming in, it is very unlikely for this unit to fail to count an event (e.g. incoming particle). The low dead time is due to sophisticated electronics in this unit, which take little time to recover from the relatively easy task of registering a logical high every time an event occurs. The trigger unit coordinates all the electronics of the system and gives a logical high to these units when the whole setup is ready to record an event run.\n\nThe oscilloscope registers a current pulse with every event. The pulse is merely the ionization current in the detector caused by this event plotted against time. The total energy of the incident particle can be found by integrating this current pulse with respect to time to yield the total charge deposited at the end of the PMT. This integration is carried out in the [[Analog-to-digital converter|analog-digital converter]] (ADC). The total deposited charge is a direct measure of the energy of the ionizing particle (neutron or photon) entering the neutron detector. This signal integration technique is an established method for measuring ionization in the detector in nuclear physics.<ref name=Leo>{{cite book |author=Leo, W. R. |year=1994 |title=Techniques for Nuclear and Particle Physics Experiments |pages= |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |isbn= }}</ref> The ADC has a higher dead time than the oscilloscope, which has limited memory and needs to transfer events quickly to the ADC. Thus, the ADC samples out approximately one in every 30 events from the oscilloscope for analysis. Since the typical event rate is around 10<sup>6</sup> neutrons every second,<ref name=Cerny>{{cite journal |author=Cerny, J. C., Dolemal, Z., Ivanov, M. P., Kuzmin, E.

The key to further analysis lies in the difference between the shape of the photon ionization-current pulse and that of the neutron. The photon pulse is longer at the ends (or \"tails\") whereas the neutron pulse is well-centered.<ref name=Cerny/> This fact can be used to identify incoming neutrons and to count the total rate of incoming neutrons. The steps leading to this separation (those that are usually performed at leading national laboratories, Jefferson Lab specifically among them) are gated pulse extraction and plotting-the-difference.\n\n==== Gated pulse extraction ====\n\nIonization current signals are all pulses with a local peak in between. Using a logical [[AND gate]] in continuous time (having a stream of \"1\" and \"0\" pulses as one input and the current signal as the other), the tail portion of every current pulse signal is extracted. This gated discrimination method is used on a regular basis on liquid scintillators.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jastaniah, S. D., Sellin, P. J. |year=2003 |title=Digital techniques for n\u2013\u03b3 pulse shape discrimination capture-gated neutron spectroscopy using liquid |volume=517 |issue=1\u20133 |pages=202\u2013210 |journal=[[Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A]] |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2003.08.178 |bibcode=2004NIMPA.517..202J }}</ref> The gated delay unit is precisely to this end, and makes a delayed copy of the original signal in such a way that its tail section is seen alongside its main section on the oscilloscope screen.\n\nAfter extracting the tail, the usual current integration is carried out on both the tail section and the complete signal. This yields two ionization values for each event, which are stored in the event table in the DAQ system.\n\n==== Plotting the difference ====\n[[Image:Tail Energy against Total energy for Photons and Nuetrons.png|thumb|upright=1.25|right|Figure 2: Expected plot of tail energy against energy in the complete pulse plotted for all event energies. Dots represent number densities of events.]]\n\nIn this step lies the crucial point of the analysis: the extracted ionization values are plotted. Specifically, the graph plots energy deposition in the tail against energy deposition in the entire signal for a range of neutron energies. Typically, for a given energy, there are many events with the same tail-energy value. In this case, plotted points are simply made denser with more overlapping dots on the two-dimensional plot, and can thus be used to eyeball the number of events corresponding to each energy-deposition. A considerable random fraction (1/30) of all events is plotted on the graph.\n\nIf the tail size extracted is a fixed proportion of the total pulse, then there will be two lines on the plot, having different slopes. The line with the greater slope will correspond to photon events and the line with the lesser slope to neutron events. This is precisely because the photon energy deposition current, plotted against time, leaves a longer \"tail\" than does the neutron deposition plot, giving the photon tail more proportion of the total energy than neutron tails.\n\nThe effectiveness of any detection analysis can be seen by its ability to accurately count and separate the number of neutrons and photons striking the detector. Also, the effectiveness of the second and third steps reveals whether event rates in the experiment are manageable. If clear plots can be obtained in the above steps, allowing for easy neutron-photon separation, the detection can be termed effective and the rates manageable. On the other hand, smudging and indistinguishability of data points will not allow for easy separation of events.\n\n===Rate control===\n\nDetection rates can be kept low in many ways. Sampling of events can be used to choose only a few events for analysis. If the rates are so high that one event cannot be distinguished from another, physical experimental parameters (shielding, detector-target distance, solid-angle, etc.) can be manipulated to give the lowest rates possible and thus distinguishable events.\n\n===Finer detection points===\n\nIt is important here to observe precisely those variables that matter, since there may be false indicators along the way. For example, ionization currents might get periodic high surges, which do not imply high rates but just high energy depositions for stray events. These surges will be tabulated and viewed with cynicism if unjustifiable, especially since there is so much background noise in the setup.\n\nOne might ask how experimenters can be sure that every current pulse in the oscilloscope corresponds to exactly one event. This is true because the pulse lasts about 50&nbsp;[[nanosecond|ns]], allowing for a maximum of {{val|2|e=7}} events every second. This number is much higher than the actual typical rate, which is usually an [[order of magnitude]] less, as mentioned above.<ref name=Cerny/> This means that is it highly unlikely for there to be two particles generating one current pulse. The current pulses last 50&nbsp;ns each, and start to register the next event after a gap from the previous event.\n\nAlthough sometimes facilitated by higher incoming neutron energies, neutron detection is generally a difficult task, for all the reasons stated earlier. Thus, better scintillator design is also in the foreground and has been the topic of pursuit ever since the invention of scintillation detectors. Scintillation detectors were invented in 1903 by Crookes but were not very efficient until the PMT (photomultiplier tube) was developed by Curran and Baker in 1944.<ref name=Leo/> The PMT gives a reliable and efficient method of detection since it multiplies the detection signal tenfold. Even so, scintillation design has room for improvement as do other options for neutron detection besides scintillation.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bonner sphere]] \u2013 tool for determining neutron energies\n* [[Nested Neutron Spectrometer]] - A field portable neutron spectrometer based on the Bonner Sphere Principle\n* [[Large Area Neutron Detector]]\n* [[Neutron Probe]]\n* [[Anger camera]] - position sensitive neutron detectors are developed using technologies of the Anger camera\n* [[Microchannel plate detector]] - position sensitive neutron detectors are developed using technologies of the microchannel plate detector\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<!--Bulleted references were originally formatted as in-text citations, but as of 2007-07-04 the reference text could not be found-->\n*{{cite web |author=Cates, G.

There are two key aspects to effective neutron detection: hardware and software. Detection hardware refers to the kind of neutron detector used (the most common today is the [[Scintillation counter|scintillation detector]]) and to the electronics used in the detection setup. Further, the hardware setup also defines key experimental parameters, such as source-detector distance, [[solid angle]] and detector shielding. Detection software consists of analysis tools that perform tasks such as graphical analysis to measure the number and energies of neutrons striking the detector.\n\n==Basic physics==\n\n===Signatures by which a neutron may be detected===\nAtomic and subatomic particles are detected by the signature they produce through interaction with their surroundings. The interactions result from the particles' fundamental characteristics.\n* Charge: Neutrons are neutral particles and do not ionize directly; hence they are harder than charged particles to detect directly. Further, their paths of motion are only weakly affected by electric and magnetic fields.\n* Mass: The neutron mass of {{val|1.0086649156|(6)|ul=u}}<ref name=RPP>[http://pdg.lbl.gov/2006/tables/bxxx.pdf Particle Data Group's Review of Particle Physics 2006]</ref> is not directly detectable, but does influence reactions through which it can be detected.\n* Reactions: Neutrons react with a number of materials through [[elastic scattering]] producing a recoiling nucleus, [[inelastic scattering]] producing an excited nucleus, or absorption with transmutation of the resulting nucleus. Most detection approaches rely on detecting the various reaction products.\n* Magnetic moment: Although neutrons have a [[neutron magnetic moment|magnetic moment]] of {{val|-1.9130427|(5)}}&nbsp;[[Nuclear magneton|\u03bc<sub>N</sub>]], techniques for detection of the magnetic moment are too insensitive to use for neutron detection.\n* Electric dipole moment: The neutron is predicted to have only a tiny [[Neutron electric dipole moment|electric dipole moment]], which has not yet been detected. Hence it is not a viable detection signature.\n* Decay: Outside the nucleus, free neutrons are unstable and have a [[mean lifetime]] of {{val|885.7|0.8|u=s}} (about 14 minutes, 46 seconds).<ref name=\"RPP\"/> Free neutrons decay by emission of an electron and an electron antineutrino to become a proton, a process known as [[beta decay]]:<ref>[http://pdg.lbl.gov/2007/tables/bxxx.pdf Particle Data Group Summary Data Table on Baryons]</ref>\n:::{{SubatomicParticle|Neutron0}} \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Electron antineutrino}}.\n:Although the {{SubatomicParticle|Proton+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} produced by neutron decay are detectable, the decay rate is too low to serve as the basis for a practical detector system.\n\n===Classic neutron detection options===\nAs a result of these properties, detection of neutrons fall into several major categories:<ref name=Tsoul>{{Cite book | last = Tsoulfanidis | first = Nicholas | title = Measurement and Detection of Radiation | publisher = Taylor & Francis | year = 1995|edition=2nd | location = Washington, D.C. | pages =467\u2013501 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-1-56032-317-4 }}</ref>\n\n*Absorptive reactions with prompt reactions - low energy neutrons are typically detected indirectly through absorption reactions. Typical absorber materials used have high [[Cross section (physics)|cross sections]] for absorption of neutrons and include [[helium-3]], [[lithium-6]], [[boron-10]], and [[uranium-235]]. Each of these reacts by emission of high energy ionized particles, the [[Particle identification#Specific ionization|ionization track]] of which can be detected by a number of means.  Commonly used reactions include <sup>3</sup>He(n,p) <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>6</sup>Li(n,t) <sup>4</sup>He, <sup>10</sup>B(n,\u03b1) <sup>7</sup>Li and the fission of uranium.<ref name=Tsoul/>\n*Activation processes - Neutrons may be detected by reacting with absorbers in a [[Neutron capture|radiative capture]], [[Spallation#Nuclear spallation|spallation]] or similar reaction, producing reaction products that then decay at some later time, releasing [[beta particle]]s or [[gamma ray|gamma]]s. Selected materials (e.g., [[indium]], [[gold]], [[rhodium]], [[iron]] (<sup>56</sup>Fe(n,p)\u2009<sup>56</sup>Mn), [[aluminum]] (<sup>27</sup>Al(n,\u03b1)<sup>24</sup>Na),\u2009[[niobium]] (<sup>93</sup>Nb(n,2n)\u2009<sup>92m</sup>Nb), & [[silicon]] (<sup>28</sup>Si(n,p) <sup>28</sup>Al)) have extremely large cross sections for the capture of neutrons within a very narrow band of energy. Use of multiple absorber samples allows characterization of the neutron energy spectrum. Activation also allows recreation of an historic neutron exposure (e.g., forensic recreation of neutron exposures during an [[criticality accident|accidental criticality]]).<ref name=Tsoul/>\n*Elastic scattering reactions (also referred to as proton-recoil) - High energy neutrons are typically detected indirectly through [[elastic scattering]] reactions. Neutrons collide with the nuclei of atoms in the detector, transferring energy to those nuclei and creating ions, which are detected. Since the maximum transfer of energy occurs when the mass of the atom with which the neutron collides is comparable to the neutron mass, hydrogenous<ref>Materials with a high hydrogen content such as water or plastic</ref> materials are often the preferred medium for such detectors.<ref name=Tsoul/>\n\n==Types of neutron detectors==\n\n===Gas proportional detectors===\n[[Proportional counter|Gas proportional detectors]] can be adapted to detect neutrons. While neutrons do not typically cause [[ionization]], the addition of a [[nuclide]] with high [[neutron cross-section]] allows the detector to respond to neutrons. Nuclides commonly used for this purpose are [[helium-3]], [[lithium-6]], [[boron|boron-10]] and [[uranium-235]]. Since these materials are most likely to react with [[Thermal neutron#Thermal neutrons|thermal neutron]]s (i.e., neutrons that have slowed to equilibrium with their surroundings), they are typically surrounded by [[Neutron moderator|moderating materials]] to reduce their energy and increase the likelihood of detection.\n\nFurther refinements are usually necessary to differentiate the neutron signal from the effects of other types of radiation. Since the energy of a thermal neutron is relatively low, charged particle reactions are discrete (i.e., essentially monoenergetic and lie within a narrow bandwidth of energies) while other reactions such as gamma reactions will span a broad energy range, it is possible to discriminate among the sources.\n\nAs a class, gas ionization detectors measure the number ([[counts per second|count rate]]), and not the energy of neutrons.\n\n====<sup>3</sup>He gas-filled proportional detectors====\nAn isotope of Helium, <sup>3</sup>He provides for an effective neutron detector material because <sup>3</sup>He reacts by absorbing thermal neutrons, producing a <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>3</sup>H ion. Its sensitivity to gamma rays is negligible, providing a very useful neutron detector. Unfortunately the supply of <sup>3</sup>He is limited to production as a byproduct from the decay of tritium (which has a 12.3 year half-life); tritium is produced either as part of weapons programs as a booster for nuclear weapons or as a byproduct of reactor operation.\n\n====BF<sub>3</sub> gas-filled proportional detectors====\nAs elemental boron is not gaseous, neutron detectors containing boron may alternately use [[boron trifluoride]] (BF<sub>3</sub>) enriched to 96% boron-10 (natural boron is 20% <sup>10</sup>B, 80% <sup>11</sup>B).<ref>[http://www.orau.org/PTP/collection/proportional%20counters/bf3info.htm Boron Trifluoride (BF<sub>3</sub>) Neutron Detectors<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Boron trifluoride is highly toxic.\nThe sensitivity of this detector is around 35-40 CPS/nv whereas that of Boron lined is about 4 CPS/nv. This is because in Boron lined, n reacts with Boron and hence produce ion pairs inside the layer. Hence charged particles produced (Alpha and Li) they lose some of their energy inside that layer. Low energy charged particles are unable to reach the Ionization chamber's gas environment. Hence, the number of ionizations produced in gas is also lower.\n\nWhereas In BF3 gas filled, N reacts with B in gas. and fully energetic Alpha and Li are able to produce more ionizations and give more pulses.\n\n====Boron lined proportional detectors====\nAlternately, boron-lined gas-filled proportional counters react similarly to BF<sub>3</sub> gas-filled proportional detectors, with the exception that the walls are coated with <sup>10</sup>B. In this design, since the reaction takes place on the surface, only one of the two particles will escape into the proportional counter.\n\n===Scintillation neutron detectors===\n\nScintillation neutron detectors include liquid organic scintillators,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Yousuke | first = I. | authorlink = |author2=Daiki, S. |author3=Hirohiko, K. |author4=Nobuhiro, S. |author5=Kenji, I. | title = Deterioration of pulse-shape discrimination in liquid organic scintillator at high energies | journal = Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record | volume = 1| issue = | pages = 6/219\u20136/221 | publisher = IEEE | location = | year = 2000 | url = | doi = 10.1109/NSSMIC.2000.949173 | id = | isbn = 978-0-7803-6503-2 }}</ref> crystals,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Kawaguchi | first = N. | authorlink = |author2=Yanagida, T. |author3=Yokota, Y. |author4=Watanabe, K. |author5=Kamada, K. |author6=Fukuda, K. |author7=Suyama, T. |author8= Yoshikawa, A.  | title = Study of crystal growth and scintillation properties as a neutron detector of 2-inch diameter eu doped LiCaAlF6 single crystal | journal = Nuclear Science Symposium Conference Record | volume = | issue = | pages = 1493\u20131495 | publisher = IEEE | location = | year = 2009 | url = | doi = 10.1109/NSSMIC.2009.5402299 | id = | isbn = 978-1-4244-3961-4 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.quantumdetectors.com/products/isis-neutron-beam-monitor Example crystal scintillator based neutron monitor.]</ref> plastics, glass<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Bollinger | first = L.

The <sup>6</sup>Li has a high cross-section for thermal neutron absorption through the <sup>6</sup>Li(n,\u03b1) reaction. Neutron absorption produces a tritium ion, an alpha particle, and kinetic energy. The alpha particle and triton interact with the glass matrix to produce ionization, which transfers energy to Ce<sup>3+</sup> ions and results in the emission of photons with wavelength 390&nbsp;nm - 600&nbsp;nm as the excited state Ce<sup>3+</sup> ions return to the ground state. The event results in a flash of light of several thousand photons for each neutron absorbed. A portion of the scintillation light propagates through the glass fiber, which acts as a waveguide. The fibers ends are optically coupled to a pair of photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) to detect photon bursts. The detectors can be used to detect both neutrons and gamma rays, which are typically distinguished using pulse-height discrimination. Substantial effort and progress in reducing fiber detector sensitivity to gamma radiation has been made. Original detectors suffered from false neutrons in a 0.02 mR gamma field. Design, process, and algorithm improvements now enable operation in gamma fields up to 20 mR/h (<sup>60</sup>Co).\n\nThe scintillating fiber detectors have excellent sensitivity, they are rugged, and have fast timing (~60 ns) so that a large dynamic range in counting rates is possible. The detectors have the advantage that they can be formed into any desired shape, and can be made very large or very small for use in a variety of applications.<ref name=\"GinhovenKouzes2009\">{{Cite journal | last = Van Ginhoven | first = R.

These detectors rely upon the prompt gamma-ray emissions from the <sup>113</sup>Cd(n, \u03b3)<sup>114</sup>Cd reaction (producing 558.6 keV and 651.3 keV gamma rays) and the <sup>199</sup>Hg(n, \u03b3) <sup>200</sup>Hg reaction (producing 368.1 keV and 661.1 keV gamma rays).  However, these semiconductor materials are designed for use as gamma-ray spectrometers and, hence, are intrinsically sensitive to the gamma-ray background.  With adequate energy resolution, pulse height discrimination can be used to separate the prompt gamma-ray emissions from neutron interactions.  However, the effective neutron detection efficiency is compromised because of the relatively small Compton ratio.  In other words, the majority of events add to the Compton continuum rather than to the full energy peak, thus, making discrimination between neutrons and background gamma rays difficult.  Also, both natural Cd and Hg have relatively large thermal-neutron (n,\u03b3) cross sections of 2444 b and 369.8 b, respectively. Consequently, most thermal neutrons are absorbed near the detector surface so that nearly half of the prompt gamma rays are emitted in directions away from the detector bulk and, thus, produce poor gamma-ray reabsorption or interaction efficiency.\n\n===Neutron activation detectors===\nActivation samples may be placed in a neutron field to characterize the energy spectrum and intensity of the neutrons.

Each application has different requirements for the detection system.\n\n*Reactor instrumentation: Since reactor power is essentially linearly proportional to the [[Neutron flux]], neutron detectors provide an important measure of power in nuclear power and research reactors. [[Boiling water reactor]]s may have dozens of neutron detectors, one per fuel assembly. Most neutron detectors used in thermal-spectrum nuclear reactors are optimized to detect [[thermal neutron]]s. \n*Plasma physics: Neutron detection is used in fusion plasma physics experiments such as [[Joint European Torus|JET]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Frenje|first=J.|chapter=The MPR Neutron Diagnostic at Jet \u2014 An ITER Prototype Study|date=1996|pages=417\u2013420|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9781461380207|doi=10.1007/978-1-4613-0369-5_49|title=Diagnostics for Experimental Thermonuclear Fusion Reactors}}</ref> For example, the detected neutron rate from a plasma can give information about the ion temperature.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Principles of plasma diagnostics |last=Hutchinson |first=I.

Neutron detectors used for radiation safety must take into account the [[relative biological effectiveness]] (i.e., the way damage caused by neutrons varies with energy).\n*Cosmic ray detection: Secondary neutrons are one component of [[particle shower]]s produced in Earth's atmosphere by [[cosmic ray]]s. Dedicated ground-level neutron detectors, namely [[neutron monitor]]s, are employed to monitor variations in cosmic ray flux.\n*Special nuclear material detection: [[Special nuclear material]]s (SNM) such as [[uranium-233]] and [[plutonium-239]] decay by [[spontaneous fission]], yielding neutrons. Neutrons detectors can be used for monitor for SNM in commerce.\n\n==Experimental neutron detection==\n\nExperiments that make use of this science include scattering experiments in which neutrons directed and then scattered from a sample are to be detected. Facilities include the [[ISIS neutron source]] at the [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]], the [[Spallation Neutron Source]] at the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]], and the [[Paul Scherrer Institute#Spallation Neutron Source .28SINQ.29|Spallation Neutron Source (SINQ)]] at the [[Paul Scherrer Institute]], in which the neutrons are produced by spallation reaction, and the traditional research reactor facilities in which neutrons are produced during fission of uranium isotopes. Noteworthy among the various neutron detection experiments is the trademark experiment of the [[European Muon Collaboration]], first performed at [[CERN]] and now termed the \"EMC experiment.\" The same experiment is performed today with more sophisticated equipment to obtain more definite results related to the original [[EMC effect]].\n\n=== Challenges in neutron detection in an experimental environment===\n\nNeutron detection in an experimental environment is not an easy science. The major challenges faced by modern-day neutron detection include [[background noise]], high detection rates, neutron neutrality, and low neutron energies.\n\n==== Background noise ====\n\nThe main components of background noise in neutron detection are high-energy [[photon]]s, which aren't easily eliminated by physical barriers. The other sources of noise, such as [[alpha particle|alpha]] and [[beta particle]]s, can be eliminated by various shielding materials, such as [[lead]], plastic, thermo-coal, etc. Thus, photons cause major interference in neutron detection, since it is uncertain if neutrons or photons are being detected by the neutron detector. Both register similar energies after scattering into the detector from the target or ambient light, and are thus hard to distinguish. [[Coincidence circuit|Coincidence]] detection can also be used to discriminate real neutron events from photons and other radiation.\n\n==== High detection rates ====\n\nIf the detector lies in a region of high beam activity, it is hit continuously by neutrons and background noise at overwhelmingly high rates. This obfuscates collected data, since there is extreme overlap in measurement, and separate events are not easily distinguished from each other. Thus, part of the challenge lies in keeping detection rates as low as possible and in designing a detector that can keep up with the high rates to yield coherent data.\n\n==== Neutrality of neutrons ====\n\nNeutrons are neutral and thus do not respond to electric fields. This makes it hard to direct their course towards a detector to facilitate detection. Neutrons also do not ionize atoms except by direct collision, so [[gaseous ionization detector]]s are ineffective.\n\n==== Varying behavior with energy ====\n\nDetectors relying on neutron absorption are generally more sensitive to low-energy [[thermal neutron]]s, and are orders of magnitude less sensitive to high-energy neutrons. [[Scintillation detectors]], on the other hand, have trouble registering the impacts of low-energy neutrons.\n\n=== Experimental setup and method ===\n[[Image:Setup.png|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Figure 1: The experimental setup]]\nFigure 1 shows the typical main components of the setup of a neutron detection unit. In principle, the diagram shows the setup as it would be in any modern [[particle physics]] lab, but the specifics describe the setup in [[Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility|Jefferson Lab]] ([[Newport News, Virginia]]).\n\nIn this setup, the incoming particles, comprising neutrons and photons, strike the neutron detector; this is typically a scintillation detector consisting of [[scintillating material]], a [[waveguide]], and a [[photomultiplier]] tube (PMT), and will be connected to a data acquisition (DAQ) system to register detection details.\n\nThe detection signal from the neutron detector is connected to the scaler unit, gated delay unit, trigger unit and the [[oscilloscope]]. The scaler unit is merely used to count the number of incoming particles or events. It does so by incrementing its tally of particles every time it detects a surge in the detector signal from the zero-point. There is very little [[dead time]] in this unit, implying that no matter how fast particles are coming in, it is very unlikely for this unit to fail to count an event (e.g. incoming particle). The low dead time is due to sophisticated electronics in this unit, which take little time to recover from the relatively easy task of registering a logical high every time an event occurs. The trigger unit coordinates all the electronics of the system and gives a logical high to these units when the whole setup is ready to record an event run.\n\nThe oscilloscope registers a current pulse with every event. The pulse is merely the ionization current in the detector caused by this event plotted against time. The total energy of the incident particle can be found by integrating this current pulse with respect to time to yield the total charge deposited at the end of the PMT. This integration is carried out in the [[Analog-to-digital converter|analog-digital converter]] (ADC). The total deposited charge is a direct measure of the energy of the ionizing particle (neutron or photon) entering the neutron detector. This signal integration technique is an established method for measuring ionization in the detector in nuclear physics.<ref name=Leo>{{cite book |author=Leo, W. R. |year=1994 |title=Techniques for Nuclear and Particle Physics Experiments |pages= |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |isbn= }}</ref> The ADC has a higher dead time than the oscilloscope, which has limited memory and needs to transfer events quickly to the ADC. Thus, the ADC samples out approximately one in every 30 events from the oscilloscope for analysis. Since the typical event rate is around 10<sup>6</sup> neutrons every second,<ref name=Cerny>{{cite journal |author=Cerny, J. C., Dolemal, Z., Ivanov, M. P., Kuzmin, E.

The key to further analysis lies in the difference between the shape of the photon ionization-current pulse and that of the neutron. The photon pulse is longer at the ends (or \"tails\") whereas the neutron pulse is well-centered.<ref name=Cerny/> This fact can be used to identify incoming neutrons and to count the total rate of incoming neutrons. The steps leading to this separation (those that are usually performed at leading national laboratories, Jefferson Lab specifically among them) are gated pulse extraction and plotting-the-difference.\n\n==== Gated pulse extraction ====\n\nIonization current signals are all pulses with a local peak in between. Using a logical [[AND gate]] in continuous time (having a stream of \"1\" and \"0\" pulses as one input and the current signal as the other), the tail portion of every current pulse signal is extracted. This gated discrimination method is used on a regular basis on liquid scintillators.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Jastaniah, S. D., Sellin, P. J. |year=2003 |title=Digital techniques for n\u2013\u03b3 pulse shape discrimination capture-gated neutron spectroscopy using liquid |volume=517 |issue=1\u20133 |pages=202\u2013210 |journal=[[Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A]] |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2003.08.178 |bibcode=2004NIMPA.517..202J }}</ref> The gated delay unit is precisely to this end, and makes a delayed copy of the original signal in such a way that its tail section is seen alongside its main section on the oscilloscope screen.\n\nAfter extracting the tail, the usual current integration is carried out on both the tail section and the complete signal. This yields two ionization values for each event, which are stored in the event table in the DAQ system.\n\n==== Plotting the difference ====\n[[Image:Tail Energy against Total energy for Photons and Nuetrons.png|thumb|upright=1.25|right|Figure 2: Expected plot of tail energy against energy in the complete pulse plotted for all event energies. Dots represent number densities of events.]]\n\nIn this step lies the crucial point of the analysis: the extracted ionization values are plotted. Specifically, the graph plots energy deposition in the tail against energy deposition in the entire signal for a range of neutron energies. Typically, for a given energy, there are many events with the same tail-energy value. In this case, plotted points are simply made denser with more overlapping dots on the two-dimensional plot, and can thus be used to eyeball the number of events corresponding to each energy-deposition. A considerable random fraction (1/30) of all events is plotted on the graph.\n\nIf the tail size extracted is a fixed proportion of the total pulse, then there will be two lines on the plot, having different slopes. The line with the greater slope will correspond to photon events and the line with the lesser slope to neutron events. This is precisely because the photon energy deposition current, plotted against time, leaves a longer \"tail\" than does the neutron deposition plot, giving the photon tail more proportion of the total energy than neutron tails.\n\nThe effectiveness of any detection analysis can be seen by its ability to accurately count and separate the number of neutrons and photons striking the detector. Also, the effectiveness of the second and third steps reveals whether event rates in the experiment are manageable. If clear plots can be obtained in the above steps, allowing for easy neutron-photon separation, the detection can be termed effective and the rates manageable. On the other hand, smudging and indistinguishability of data points will not allow for easy separation of events.\n\n===Rate control===\n\nDetection rates can be kept low in many ways. Sampling of events can be used to choose only a few events for analysis. If the rates are so high that one event cannot be distinguished from another, physical experimental parameters (shielding, detector-target distance, solid-angle, etc.) can be manipulated to give the lowest rates possible and thus distinguishable events.\n\n===Finer detection points===\n\nIt is important here to observe precisely those variables that matter, since there may be false indicators along the way. For example, ionization currents might get periodic high surges, which do not imply high rates but just high energy depositions for stray events. These surges will be tabulated and viewed with cynicism if unjustifiable, especially since there is so much background noise in the setup.\n\nOne might ask how experimenters can be sure that every current pulse in the oscilloscope corresponds to exactly one event. This is true because the pulse lasts about 50&nbsp;[[nanosecond|ns]], allowing for a maximum of {{val|2|e=7}} events every second. This number is much higher than the actual typical rate, which is usually an [[order of magnitude]] less, as mentioned above.<ref name=Cerny/> This means that is it highly unlikely for there to be two particles generating one current pulse. The current pulses last 50&nbsp;ns each, and start to register the next event after a gap from the previous event.\n\nAlthough sometimes facilitated by higher incoming neutron energies, neutron detection is generally a difficult task, for all the reasons stated earlier. Thus, better scintillator design is also in the foreground and has been the topic of pursuit ever since the invention of scintillation detectors. Scintillation detectors were invented in 1903 by Crookes but were not very efficient until the PMT (photomultiplier tube) was developed by Curran and Baker in 1944.<ref name=Leo/> The PMT gives a reliable and efficient method of detection since it multiplies the detection signal tenfold. Even so, scintillation design has room for improvement as do other options for neutron detection besides scintillation.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bonner sphere]] \u2013 tool for determining neutron energies\n* [[Nested Neutron Spectrometer]] - A field portable neutron spectrometer based on the Bonner Sphere Principle\n* [[Large Area Neutron Detector]]\n* [[Neutron Probe]]\n* [[Anger camera]] - position sensitive neutron detectors are developed using technologies of the Anger camera\n* [[Microchannel plate detector]] - position sensitive neutron detectors are developed using technologies of the microchannel plate detector\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<!--Bulleted references were originally formatted as in-text citations, but as of 2007-07-04 the reference text could not be found-->\n*{{cite web |author=Cates, G.
