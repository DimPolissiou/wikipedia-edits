Under the terms of a [[plea bargain]], Shawcross was allowed to plead guilty to one charge of [[manslaughter]], for which he served 14 years of a 25-year sentence. He killed most of his victims in 1988 and 1989 after being [[parole]]d early which led to criticism of the justice system. A food service worker, Shawcross trawled the streets of Rochester in his girlfriend's 1984 sky blue [[Dodge Omni]] (later using her blue-grey 1987 [[Chevy Celebrity]]), looking for sex workers to abduct.\n\nHe died in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 2008, while serving a prison sentence of 250 years for his crimes. Dr. [[Michael H.

The ''Salle des Illustres'' contains 19th century works of art.\n\n\n== Gallery ==\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200px\">\nCapitole_Toulouse_-_Le_donjon.jpg|The [[capitouls]]' former tower (1525-1530, except for the top).\nAugustins_-_Dame_Tholose_-_1550_-_Jean_Rancy.jpg|Jean Rancy's ''Dame Tholose'', 1544-1550, that served as a weather vane on the tower.\nCapitole_de_Toulouse_-_Cour_Henri_IV_-_portail_de_Nicolas_Bachelier.jpg|The Renaissance portal in the courtyard (16th and 17th c.).\nPortebachelier-01(1).jpg|The lower part of the portal (1546) represents [[Athena|Pallas]], protector of the city since Roman times.\nBas-Relief_in_cour_Henri_IV.jpg|The middle part of the portal (1561) depicts enslaved prisoners.\nCapitole_de_Toulouse_-_Cour_Henri_IV_-_Henri_IV_par_Thomas_Hurtamat_1607.jpg|The upper part of the portal (1602-1609) features a statue of King Henry IV.\nCoat_of_arms_in_Cour_Henri_IV_Gervais_de_Mourat.JPG|The inner courtyard (1602-1606) is decorated with many coats of arms of [[capitouls]].\nCapitole-27.jpg|The main facade (1750-1760).\nCoats_of_arms,_balcony_of_Capitole_of_Toulouse_10.JPG|The balconies are decorated with the coats of arms of the [[capitouls]].\nCapitole_Toulouse_-_Grand_escalier_-_Raimond_VI_comte_de_Toulouse,_l'excommuni\u00e9_1156-1222_-_Ren\u00e9-Henri_Ravaut.jpg|Painting of [[Raymond VI, Count of Toulouse|Raymond VI]], Count of Toulouse, excommunicated by the Pope.\nInt\u00e9rieur_du_Capitole_de_Toulouse,_vers_la_Salle_des_Illustres_05.JPG|Painting of the first session of the [[Floral Games]].\nCapitole_Toulouse_-_Salle_Gervais.jpg|Gervais hall, former wedding hall.\nCapitole_Toulouse_-_Salle_Gervais_-_Amour_source_heureuse_de_vie_\u00e0_vingt_ans_-_par_Paul_Gervais.jpg|Painting in Gervais hall.\nCapitole_Toulouse_-_Salle_Henri-Martin_-_L'\u00e9t\u00e9_par_Henri_Martin.jpg|Painting in [[Henri-Jean Guillaume Martin|Henri Martin]] hall.\nCapitole_Toulouse_-_Salle_des_Illustres.jpg|Hall of Illustrious.\nCapitole_Toulouse_-_Salle_des_Illustres_-_Toulouse_coop\u00e9rant_\u00e0_la_d\u00e9fense_nationale_1897_-_Jean-Andr\u00e9_Rixens.jpg|Paintings on the ceiling of the Hall of Illustrious.\nCapitole_Toulouse_-_Salle_des_Illustres_-_Apollon_et_les_Arts_1897_-_Paul_Gervais.jpg|Paintings on the ceiling of the Hall of Illustrious.\nLa_Couronne_de_Toulouse_1894_-_Edouard_Debat-Ponsan_-_salle_des_Illustres,_Toulouse.jpg|Paintings on the ceiling of the Hall of Illustrious.\nCapitole_Toulouse_-_Salle_des_Illustres_-_L'entr\u00e9e_\u00e0_Toulouse_du_pape_Urbain_II_en_1096_par_Benjamin_Constant.jpg|Painting on a wall in the Hall of Illustrious, representing [[Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse|Raymond IV]] welcoming the Pope in 1096.\nCapitole_Toulouse_-_Salle_des_Illustres_-_Dura_lex,_sed_lex_ou_La_Loi,_la_Justice,_la_V\u00e9rit\u00e9_(1905)_par_Paul_Gervais.jpg|Painting on a wall in the Hall of Illustrious, ''Dura lex, sed lex''.\nCapitole_Toulouse_-_Salle_du_Conseil_municipal.jpg|Council Chamber.\nCapitole_Toulouse_-_Salle_du_Conseil_municipal_-Toulouse_vue_du_Bazacle_-_Edmond_Yarz.jpg|Painting of Toulouse in the Council Chamber.\nCapitole_Toulouse_-_Salle_du_Conseil_municipal_-_Les_vendanges_-_Henri_Bonis.jpg|Grape harvest painting in the Council Chamber.\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Capitouls]]\n* [[List of the mayors of Toulouse]]\n* [[Parliament of Toulouse]]\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n===Bibliography===\n* {{citation |last=Turning |first=Patricia |url=https://books.google.com.hk/books?id=VPsky0R6JvYC&pg=PP1 |title=Municipal Officials, Their Public, and the Negotiation of Justice in Medieval Languedoc: Fear Not the Madness of the Raging Mob |series=''Later Medieval Europe'', No. 10 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |date=2013 |isbn=978-90-04-23464-2 }}.\n\n{{commonscat}}\n\n{{coord|43.60446|N|1.44403|E|source:placeopedia|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Toulouse]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in France]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Toulouse]]\n[[Category:City and town halls in France]]\n\n\n{{France-hist-stub}}\n{{HauteGaronne-geo-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Shiraz Ph\u00e9nom\u00e8ne", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capitole_de_Toulouse"}

He was dropped off, along with ten classmates, and had to walk less than a block to his home. According to his confession, Chavez blocked Ryce's path with his pickup truck and forced him at gunpoint into the truck. Chavez took Ryce to his trailer where he raped him. About four hours later, when he heard a helicopter hovering above, Ryce ran to the door and tried to open it only to be shot in the back by Chavez, who held the child until he took his last breath.

He lived in a trailer on their property. Around the time of Ryce's disappearance, Scheinhaus reported several items missing from her home including a handgun and jewelry. Scheinhaus suspected Chavez, after consulting with a psychic, but had no evidence to support her suspicions. Aided by a locksmith, Scheinhaus entered Chavez's trailer. She found her handgun and young Ryce's bookbag. She reported her findings to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] on December&nbsp;5, 1995. Chavez was found a day later and taken in for questioning.\n\nBeing advised of his rights and after a 55-hour-long interrogation, Chavez openly admitted to abducting, raping and murdering Ryce. Chavez also led police to the boy's body, which was dismembered and hidden in cement in three plastic planters.\n\n=== The murder case ===\nIn the fall of 1998, Juan Carlos Chavez was convicted of kidnapping, sexual battery, and capital murder.

In 1659, the instructions for the establishment of the Paris Foreign Missions Society were given by Rome's [[Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith]], and marked the creation of a missionary institution that did not depend on the control of the traditional missionary and [[colonialism|colonial powers]] of Spain or Portugal.<ref>Missions, p.3</ref> In the 350 years since its foundation, the institution has sent more than 4,200 missionary priests to Asia and North America, with the mission of adapting to local customs, establishing a native [[clergy]], and keeping close contacts with Rome.<ref name=\"Missions\">Missions, p.4</ref>\n\nIn the 19th century, the local persecutions of missionary priests of the Paris Foreign Missions Society was often a pretext for French military intervention in Asia.<ref name=\"Missions_2\">Missions, p.5</ref> In [[Vietnam]], the persecutions were used by the French government to justify the armed interventions of [[Jean-Baptiste C\u00e9cille]] and [[Rigault de Genouilly]]. In China, the murder of Father [[Auguste Chapdelaine]] became the ''[[casus belli]]'' for the French involvement in the [[Second Opium War]] in 1856. In [[Korea]], persecutions were used to justify the 1866 [[French Campaign against Korea, 1866|French campaign against Korea]].\n\nToday, the Paris Foreign Missions Society remains an active institution in the evangelization of Asia.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:MEP_in_Paris.jpg|thumb|Building of the Missions \u00e9trang\u00e8res de Paris, 128 [[Rue du Bac]], Paris.]]\n[[File:MEP symbol.jpg|thumb|Symbol of the Missions \u00c9trang\u00e8res de Paris.]]\n\nThe traditional colonial powers of Spain and Portugal had initially received from the [[Pope]] an exclusive agreement to evangelize conquered lands, a system known as ''[[Padroado Real]]'' in Portuguese and ''[[Patronato real]]'' in Spanish. After some time however, Rome grew dissatisfied with the ''Padroado'' system, due to its limited means, strong involvement with politics, and dependence on the kings of Spain and Portugal for any decision.<ref name=\"Mantienne\">Mantienne, p.22</ref>\n\nFrom a territorial standpoint also, Portugal had been losing ground against the new colonial powers of England and the [[Dutch Republic]], meaning that it was becoming less capable of evangelizing new territories.<ref name=\"Les Missions Etrang\u00e8res, p.30\">''Les Missions \u00e9trang\u00e8res'', p.30</ref> In territories that it used to control, Portugal had seen some disasters; for instance, [[Kirishitan|Japanese Christianity]] was eradicated from around 1620.<ref name=\"Les Missions\">''Les Missions Etrang\u00e8res'', p.25</ref> Finally, Roman officials had doubts about the efficacy of religious orders, such as the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], [[Franciscans]], [[Jesuits]] or [[Barnabites]], since they were highly vulnerable in case of persecutions.  They did not seem able to develop local clergy, who would be less vulnerable to state persecution.<ref name=\"Les Missions\"/> Sending bishops to develop a strong local clergy seemed to be the solution to achieve future expansion:<ref name=\"Les Missions\"/>\n\n{{Quotation|\"We have all reason to fear that what happened to the Church of Japan could also happen to the Church of Annam, because these kings, in [[Tonkin]] as well as in [[Cochinchina]], are very powerful and accustomed to war...

missionary efforts, had established the [[Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith]] (''Congregatio de Propaganda Fide'', commonly known as ''[[Congregation for the Evangelization of

Each bishop received annually 1200 [[francs]], each mission had its general needs and works allowance, which varied according to its importance, and could amount to from 10,000 to 30,000 francs.\n\n[[File:MEP Departures of 1856.jpg|thumb|1856 departures of MEP missionaries.]]\n[[File:1864 MEP departures.jpg|thumb|1864 departures of MEP missionaries.

Fifteen missionaries died in prison or were beheaded during the 17th and 18th centuries and the beginning of the 19th century; but after that those killed among the missionaries were very numerous. (See [[Martyr Saints of China]]). Altogether, about 200 MEP missionaries died of violent death.

These persecutions were described in Europe by books, pamphlets, annals, and journals, inspiring numerous young men either with the desire for [[martyrdom]] or that of evangelization. They played a part in inspiring European nations, especially France and England, to intervene in [[Indochina]] and China.<ref name=\"Missions_2\"/>\n\nAnother cause of the progress of the missionaries was the ease and frequency of communication in consequence of the invention of steam and the opening of the [[Suez Canal]]. A voyage could be made safely in one month which formerly required eight to ten months amid many dangers. In Vietnam, the persecutions of numerous priests such as [[Pierre Borie]] or [[Augustin Schoeffer]] was used as a justification for the armed interventions of [[Jean-Baptiste C\u00e9cille]] and [[Rigault de Genouilly]], ultimately leading to the occupation of Vietnam and the creation of [[French Indochina]].

This was done by stealth, either via the Korean border with Manchuria or the Yellow Sea. These French missionaries of the Paris Foreign Missions Society arrived in Korea in the 1840s to proselytize to a growing Korean flock that had in fact independently introduced Catholicism into Korea but needed ordained ministers.\n\n====1839 persecutions====\nOn 26 April 1836, [[Laurent-Joseph-Marius Imbert]] of the Paris Foreign Missions Society was appointed [[Vicar Apostolic]] of Korea and [[Titular bishop|Titular Bishop]] of [[Capsa (see)|Capsa]]. On 14 May 1837, he was [[ordination|ordained]] Titular Bishop of Capsa and crossed secretly from Manchuria to Korea the same year. On 10 August 1839, Bishop Imbert, who was secretly going about his missionary work, was betrayed. He was taken to [[Seoul]] where he was tortured to reveal the whereabouts of foreign missionaries. He wrote a note to his fellow missionaries, Fathers [[Pierre-Philibert Maubant]] and [[Jacques-Honor\u00e9 Chastan]], asking them to surrender to the Korean authorities as well. They were taken before an interrogator and questioned for three days to reveal the names and whereabouts of their converts. As torture failed to break them down, they were sent to another prison and beheaded on 21 September 1839 at [[Saenamteo]]. Their bodies remained exposed for several days but were finally buried on Noku Mountain.\n\n====1866 persecutions====\n[[File:Questionning of Simeon Berneux.jpg|thumb|The questioning of [[Sim\u00e9on-Fran\u00e7ois Berneux|Sim\u00e9on Berneux]].]]\nBishop [[Sim\u00e9on-Fran\u00e7ois Berneux]], appointed in 1856 as head of the infant Korean Catholic church, estimated in 1859 that the number of Korean faithful had reached nearly 17,000. At first the Korean court turned a blind eye to such incursions. This attitude changed abruptly, however, with the enthronement of [[King Gojong of Joseon|King Gojong]] in 1864. By the time the Heungseon Daewongun assumed de facto control of the government in 1864 there were twelve French Paris Foreign Missions Society priests living and preaching in Korea and an estimated 23,000 native Korean converts.\n\n[[File:St-Berneux.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Sim\u00e9on-Fran\u00e7ois Berneux|Bishop Berneux]] of the Paris Foreign Missions Society was tortured and then beheaded on March 7, 1866.<ref>[http://www.sspxasia.com/Newsletters/2001/Jan-Mar/A-Korean-Martyr-for-the-Society-of-St-Pius-X.htm Source]</ref>]]\nIn January, 1866 Russian ships appeared on the east coast of Korea demanding trading and residency rights in what seemed an echo of the demands made on China by other western powers. Native Korean Christians, with connections at court, saw in this an opportunity to advance their cause and suggested an alliance between France and Korea to repel the Russian advances, suggesting further that this alliance could be negotiated through Bishop Berneux. The Heungseon Daewongun seemed open to this idea, though it is uncertain whether this was ruse to bring the head of the Korean Catholic Church out into the open.

After the signature of the [[Treaty of Nanking]] by Great Britain in 1842, both France and the United States tried to increase their efforts in the Orient.\n\nThe first attempts at resuming contacts occurred with the [[Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom]] (modern [[Okinawa]]), a vassal of the Japanese fief of [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] since 1609. In 1844, a French naval expedition under Captain Fornier-Duplan onboard ''Alcm\u00e8ne'' visited [[Okinawa]] on April 28, 1844. Trade was denied, but Father Forcade of the Paris Foreign Missions Society was left behind with a Chinese translator, named Auguste Ko. Forcade and Ko remained in the Temple of Amiku, city of [[Tomari, Okinawa|Tomari]], under strict surveillance, only able to learn the Japanese language from monks. After a period of one year, on May 1, 1846, the French ship ''Sabine'', commanded by Gu\u00e9rin, arrived, soon followed by ''La Victorieuse'', commanded by [[Rigault de Genouilly]], and ''Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'', under [[Admiral C\u00e9cille]].

France sent an embassy under Rear-Admiral C\u00e9cille onboard ''La Virginie'' in order to obtain similar advantages. A convention was signed on November 24, 1855.\n\nAs contacts between France and Japan developed during the [[Bakumatsu]] period (on the military side this is the period of the first [[French military mission to Japan (1867\u20131868)|French military mission to Japan]]), Japan was formed into a unique Vicariate Apostolic from 1866 until 1876.

The Missions would be firmly re-established through a decree by [[Louis XVIII]] in March 1815.<ref>''Les Missions Etrangeres'', p.135</ref>\n\nSeveral causes contributed to the rapid growth of the Society in the 19th century; chiefly the charity of the Propagation of the Faith and the [[Society of the Holy Childhood]].  Each bishop received annually 1200 [[francs]], each mission had its general needs and works allowance, which varied according to its importance, and could amount to from 10,000 to 30,000 francs.\n\n[[File:MEP Departures of 1856.jpg|thumb|1856 departures of MEP missionaries.]]\n[[File:1864 MEP departures.jpg|thumb|1864 departures of MEP missionaries. The four on the left would become martyrs in Korea.]]\nThe second cause was persecution. Fifteen missionaries died in prison or were beheaded during the 17th and 18th centuries and the beginning of the 19th century; but after that those killed among the missionaries were very numerous. (See [[Martyr Saints of China]]). Altogether, about 200 MEP missionaries died of violent death. Among them 23 were beatified, of whom 20 were canonized,<ref>Website of the [[College General]]: [http://www.rc.net/malaysia/collegegeneral/MEP.htm]</ref> with an additional 3 in 2000.\n\nAuthors such as [[Chateaubriand]], with his ''[[G\u00e9nie du christianisme]]'', also contributed to the recovery of the militant spirit of Catholicism, after the troubles of the [[French Revolution]].<ref>''Les Missions Etrangeres'', p.137</ref>\n\nBy 1820, the territory of the Missions, which included India since the prohition of the [[Company of Jesus]] (the [[Jesuits]]) in 1776, extended to Korea, Japan, [[Manchuria]], [[Tibet]], [[Burma]], [[Malaysia]] etc...<ref name=\"Missions_2\"/>\n\nIn the 19th century, the local persecutions of missionary priests of the Paris Foreign Missions Society was often a pretext for French military intervention in Asia,<ref name=\"Missions_2\"/> based on the doctrine of the [[Protectorate of missions]]. These persecutions were described in Europe by books, pamphlets, annals, and journals, inspiring numerous young men either with the desire for [[martyrdom]] or that of evangelization. They played a part in inspiring European nations, especially France and England, to intervene in [[Indochina]] and China.<ref name=\"Missions_2\"/>\n\nAnother cause of the progress of the missionaries was the ease and frequency of communication in consequence of the invention of steam and the opening of the [[Suez Canal]]. A voyage could be made safely in one month which formerly required eight to ten months amid many dangers. In Vietnam, the persecutions of numerous priests such as [[Pierre Borie]] or [[Augustin Schoeffer]] was used as a justification for the armed interventions of [[Jean-Baptiste C\u00e9cille]] and [[Rigault de Genouilly]], ultimately leading to the occupation of Vietnam and the creation of [[French Indochina]]. In Korea, the beheading of [[Sim\u00e9on-Fran\u00e7ois Berneux]] and other priests justified the 1866 [[French Campaign against Korea, 1866|French Campaign against Korea]].\n\n===Vietnam===\n{{See also|Martyrs of Vietnam|Roman Catholicism in Vietnam|France-Vietnam relations}}\n[[File:Martyrdom of Joseph Marchand.jpg|thumb|left|Martyrdom of [[Joseph Marchand]] in Vietnam in 1835.]]\nIn 1825, emperor [[Minh M\u1ea1ng]], the son and successor of [[Gia Long]], prohibited foreign missionaries in Vietnam, on the grounds that they perverted the people.

These French missionaries of the Paris Foreign Missions Society arrived in Korea in the 1840s to proselytize to a growing Korean flock that had in fact independently introduced Catholicism into Korea but needed ordained ministers.\n\n====1839 persecutions====\nOn 26 April 1836, [[Laurent-Joseph-Marius Imbert]] of the Paris Foreign Missions Society was appointed [[Vicar Apostolic]] of Korea and [[Titular bishop|Titular Bishop]] of [[Capsa (see)|Capsa]]. On 14 May 1837, he was [[ordination|ordained]] Titular Bishop of Capsa and crossed secretly from Manchuria to Korea the same year. On 10 August 1839, Bishop Imbert, who was secretly going about his missionary work, was betrayed. He was taken to [[Seoul]] where he was tortured to reveal the whereabouts of foreign missionaries. He wrote a note to his fellow missionaries, Fathers [[Pierre-Philibert Maubant]] and [[Jacques-Honor\u00e9 Chastan]], asking them to surrender to the Korean authorities as well. They were taken before an interrogator and questioned for three days to reveal the names and whereabouts of their converts. As torture failed to break them down, they were sent to another prison and beheaded on 21 September 1839 at [[Saenamteo]]. Their bodies remained exposed for several days but were finally buried on Noku Mountain.\n\n====1866 persecutions====\n[[File:Questionning of Simeon Berneux.jpg|thumb|The questioning of [[Sim\u00e9on-Fran\u00e7ois Berneux|Sim\u00e9on Berneux]].]]\nBishop [[Sim\u00e9on-Fran\u00e7ois Berneux]], appointed in 1856 as head of the infant Korean Catholic church, estimated in 1859 that the number of Korean faithful had reached nearly 17,000. At first the Korean court turned a blind eye to such incursions. This attitude changed abruptly, however, with the enthronement of [[King Gojong of Joseon|King Gojong]] in 1864. By the time the Heungseon Daewongun assumed de facto control of the government in 1864 there were twelve French Paris Foreign Missions Society priests living and preaching in Korea and an estimated 23,000 native Korean converts.\n\n[[File:St-Berneux.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Sim\u00e9on-Fran\u00e7ois Berneux|Bishop Berneux]] of the Paris Foreign Missions Society was tortured and then beheaded on March 7, 1866.<ref>[http://www.sspxasia.com/Newsletters/2001/Jan-Mar/A-Korean-Martyr-for-the-Society-of-St-Pius-X.htm Source]</ref>]]\nIn January, 1866 Russian ships appeared on the east coast of Korea demanding trading and residency rights in what seemed an echo of the demands made on China by other western powers. Native Korean Christians, with connections at court, saw in this an opportunity to advance their cause and suggested an alliance between France and Korea to repel the Russian advances, suggesting further that this alliance could be negotiated through Bishop Berneux. The Heungseon Daewongun seemed open to this idea, though it is uncertain whether this was ruse to bring the head of the Korean Catholic Church out into the open. Berneux was summoned to the capital, but upon his arrival in February 1866, he was seized and executed. A roundup then began of the other French Catholic priests and native converts.\n\n[[File:Pierre Henri Dorie Korea 1864.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Pierre Henri Dori\u00e9]] of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, also martyred in Korea in 1866.]]\nAs a result of the Korean dragnet all but three of the French missionaries were captured and executed: among them were Bishop Sim\u00e9on Berneux, Bishop Antoine Daveluy, Father Just de Breteni\u00e8res, Father [[Louis Beaulieu]], Father [[Pierre Henri Dori\u00e9]], Father Pierre Auma\u00eetre, Father Luc Martin Huin, all of them members of the Paris Foreign Missions Society and canonized by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 6 May 1984.

Fortuitously in Tianjin at the time of Ridel's arrival was the commander of the French Far Eastern Squadron, Rear Admiral [[Pierre-Gustave Roze]].

After the signature of the [[Treaty of Nanking]] by Great Britain in 1842, both France and the United States tried to increase their efforts in the Orient.\n\nThe first attempts at resuming contacts occurred with the [[Ry\u016bky\u016b Kingdom]] (modern [[Okinawa]]), a vassal of the Japanese fief of [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] since 1609. In 1844, a French naval expedition under Captain Fornier-Duplan onboard ''Alcm\u00e8ne'' visited [[Okinawa]] on April 28, 1844. Trade was denied, but Father Forcade of the Paris Foreign Missions Society was left behind with a Chinese translator, named Auguste Ko. Forcade and Ko remained in the Temple of Amiku, city of [[Tomari, Okinawa|Tomari]], under strict surveillance, only able to learn the Japanese language from monks. After a period of one year, on May 1, 1846, the French ship ''Sabine'', commanded by Gu\u00e9rin, arrived, soon followed by ''La Victorieuse'', commanded by [[Rigault de Genouilly]], and ''Cl\u00e9op\u00e2tre'', under [[Admiral C\u00e9cille]]. They came with the news that [[Pope Gregory XVI]] had nominated Forcade [[Bishop]] of [[Samos]] and [[Vicar Apostolic]] of Japan.<ref>[[Dublin Review (Catholic periodical)|The Dublin Review]], Nicholas Patrick Wiseman [https://books.google.com/books?id=3ffc5WINgHAC&q=Forcade+Bishop&dq=Forcade+Bishop&pgis=1]</ref> C\u00e9cille offered the kingdom French protection against British expansionism, but in vain, and only obtained that two missionaries could stay.\n\n[[File:Mgr Petitjean first Vicar Apostolic of Japan.jpg|thumb|right|Mgr Petitjean, of the Paris Foreign Missions Society, first effective Vicar Apostolic of Japan.]]\nForcade and Ko were picked up to be used as translators in Japan, and father Leturdu was left in Tomari, soon joined by Father Mathieu Adnet. On July 24, 1846, Admiral C\u00e9cille arrived in [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]], but failed in his negotiations and was denied landing, and Bishop Forcade never set foot in mainland Japan.<ref>Religion in Japan: Arrows to Heaven and Earth By [[Peter Francis Kornicki]], James McMullen (1996) Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-55028-9}}, p.162</ref> The Ryu-Kyu court in [[Naha]] complained in early 1847 about the presence of the French missionaries, who had to be removed in 1848.\n\nFrance would have no further contacts with Okinawa for the next 7 years, until news came that [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Perry]] had obtained an agreement with the islands on July 11, 1854, following his treaty with Japan. France sent an embassy under Rear-Admiral C\u00e9cille onboard ''La Virginie'' in order to obtain similar advantages. A convention was signed on November 24, 1855.\n\nAs contacts between France and Japan developed during the [[Bakumatsu]] period (on the military side this is the period of the first [[French military mission to Japan (1867\u20131868)|French military mission to Japan]]), Japan was formed into a unique Vicariate Apostolic from 1866 until 1876.
