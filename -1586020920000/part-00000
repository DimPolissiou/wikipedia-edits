It is a country along the Marmara Sealine. The area, which was inhabited since the 8th century BC, was formerly known as \u03a4\u03c1\u03af\u03b3\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, ''Trigleia'' or \u0392\u03c1\u03cd\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd, ''Brylleion'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]. When demand for the products of Southern Marmara from the ancient world increased, ports have been constructed in [[Kios]] ([[Gemlik]]), [[Kur\u015funlu, Bursa|Kur\u015funlu]], [[Apamea Myrlea]]([[Mudanya]]), [[Si\u011fi]] ([[Kumyaka]]), and Trilye (Zeytinba\u011f\u0131) and the region boomed. The most important historical structure in Trilye (Triglia) is that of the Byzantine Haghioi Theodoroi Church, known today as the Fatih Mosque. Mudanya, a residential and commercial development in this township is under state protection as a historical site.\n\nTrisect has been an important religious center for [[Greek Orthodox]] Christians for a long time. Trilye is a first level protected area since 1980 because of the Byzantine and Ottoman architectural monuments and is considered as an open-air museum thanks to the historical buildings and houses. Osman Gazi\u2019s Turkmens in Bursa and surroundings have started settling in this location from the beginning of the year 1303. Kaymak Oba, Mirza Oba and \u00c7epni villages located at the back of Trilye are believed to have been established during this era. After Mudanya was conquered in 1321 Trilye\u2019s ports and other ports in the region started being used. The land at the western parts of Bursa namely the area between current Minor Industry Area (K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Sanayi B\u00f6lgesi) and Uluabat Lake were very fertile. Grapes, cocoons and cereal crops were grown in this region. In addition the Tahtal\u0131, Demirci and Do\u011fanc\u0131 regions had high quality wood used in the production of ships. There are signs proving a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] cargo boat has visited Trilye port in the 1330s.\n\nChurches and monasteries were constructed in Trigleia and its surroundings on the patronage of Byzantine Emperors.\n\nOnly 2500 people currently live in the town due to the impact of the 1923 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]]. Only the ruins of the Byzantines remain, the ruins of old Byzantine churches. Greek houses built at the end of the 19th century prior to the Genocide line the remaining streets. Nevertheless, the town is under the protection of the Ministry of Culture so no one can destroy the old houses or rebuild them in a different style than the original one. The place is known for its olives and had historically been inhabited by Greek artisans engaged in the silk trade. 'Zeytingbagi' means 'olive yard'.\n\n==History==\n\nThe area has been host to various civilizations since antiquity. Tirilye is the original village. Although the name of the village has been officially changed to Zeytinba\u011f\u0131 (Olive Orchard), that name is rarely, if ever, used in daily life, and the name Trilye is used instead.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\nThere are several legends about the origins of the name. One is that the area was famous for red mullet and red gurnard and that those fish were the main course of the Byzantine emperors' tables. \"[[Trigleia]]\" ([[Triglia lucerna]]) is a word in Greek for such fish.\n\nAnother legend comes from the Genoese. Three inhabitants of the village were distressed by the looting of pirates. Therefore, they combined their power and decided to live together. The name Tirilye is said to be derived from those three villagers.\n\nEven after the Ottoman Empire absorbed the area, it remained Greek-populated. Although some Muslims from several areas in Anatolia had settled here the Christian population remained in the majority.\nDuring the [[Greek genocide]], the wealthier class of the inhabitants of the village opened their shops and started distributing oil, rice, sugar, etc., to the poor, but were prevented from continuing further distribution by the Government officials.<ref name=\"Persecution_of_the_Greeks_in_Turkey_1914_1918\">{{cite book| title = Persecution of the Greeks in Turkey, 1914-1918| url = https://archive.org/details/persecutionofgre00consrich| publisher = Constantinople [London, Printed by the Hesperia Press]|date=1919}}</ref> One Church was turned into a Mosque.<ref name=\"Persecution_of_the_Greeks_in_Turkey_1914_1918\"/>  Houses were demolished.<ref name=\"Persecution_of_the_Greeks_in_Turkey_1914_1918\"/>  \n\nAfter the [[Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922]] and the [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]] that followed the Greeks left the village. The Greeks migrated to Greece with the help of local businessman and ship owner [[Phillipos Kavounidis]]. The refugees were taken mainly to two places 1) to [[Rafina]], near Athens, where icons from the churches can currently be seen inside one of the local churches and 2) to Nea Triglia, Chalkidiki. In turn, Muslim immigrants mainly from Salonica ([[Thessaloniki]] and [[Langadas]]) and other places were settled in Tirilye.\n\n==Fatih Mosque==\n{{main|Fatih Mosque, Tirilye}}\n[[File:Fatih Cami.JPG|thumb|Fatih Mosque]]\nThe Fatih Mosque (Turkish: Fatih Camii) is a mosque in Tirilye, which was converted from an 8th-century Byzantine church dedicated to Saint Stefanos (Moni Hinolakou- \u039c\u03bf\u03bd\u03ae \u03a7\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03bb\u03ac\u03ba\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5). The building was constructed between 720 and 730 AD, originally as the Church of Christ and Saint Stefanos. After the Ottoman conquest of the town, it was converted (in 1661) to a mosque and named \"Fatih\", which means \"conqueror\". The mosque was briefly rededicated as a church during the Greek orccupation of the area in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919\u20131922.\n\nThe church is the oldest Byzantine building in the region, and has protected status. It is of the typical Byzantine cross-in-square style and has Byzantine column headings at the entrance and a dome {{convert|19|m|ft|abbr=off}} high. The mosque is entuered thorough a portico covered with a wooden roof which is standing on four columns that have ornamented metal headings. The building has a mihrab that is covered with a half-dome.

The construction of the magnificent building started in 1909 and was completed in three years (1912). It is situated on an area of {{convert|965|m2|abbr=off}}, is four stories high and is located on the hill at the west of \u0130skele Street. In 1924 after the establishment of the republic it is opened as a school called Dar-\u00fcl Eytam for orphans, who were the children of soldiers that died in the war. The building served as a boarding school, a primary school and a secondary school later on. The historical building that was evacuated in 1989 was transferred to Uluda\u011f University first and then was transferred to Zeytinba\u011f\u0131 Municipality for restorations. It has been declared as a protected monument by 1299/31.8.1990 decision of BURSA K\u00dcLT\u00dcR ve TAB\u0130AT VARLIKLARINI KORUMA KURULU B\u00dcRO M\u00dcD\u00dcRL\u00dc\u011e\u00dc.\n\n== Virgin Mary-Metropolis Church ==\n{{main| Virgin Mary- Metropolis Church, Tirilye}}\nThe complex, which was constructed in Trilye in 1878 as a Greek Church, after 1924 The Dar-\u00fcl Eytam School, which opens to the Stone School (being used for the workshops for carpentry and iron works for 400 students), and the \u201cD\u00fcndar House\", used as a mess house. The church had three vertical lines similar to all other churches(Vertical lines are separated with columns), but the abscissa of the church was demolished for creating a new entrance, causing the upper part of the entrance to be higher than the sides. The Church building was used as a mess hall until the school was closed in September 1927. Due to its function it was called \u201cmess hall\u201d until its restoration, which turned the building into Faruk \u00c7elik Cultural Center.

Upon the request of the Greek Culture Delegation a ceremony was held in this building during the visit of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople|Bartholomew I]] to Tirilye on July 1, 2009. Starting from 2019 \"Theofaneia\" ceremony is held each year (on 19/1/2019 and 20/1/2020) by Patriarch Bartholomew.\n\n== Churches in the city==\nIn Triyle there were seven churches, three monasteries and three holy springs in Zeytinba\u011f\u0131 however only four of these churches have survived up until now and are Ayios Stefanos or Moni Hinolakou (Fatih Camii since 1661), Panagia Pantovasilissa (Kemer Kilise), Ayios Georgios Ano (known as Dundar's House) and Virgin Mary-Metropolis. Of the monasteries, only Ayios Ioannis Theologos (Pelekete) Monastery has even partially survived among the three monasteries. On one of the demolished churches (Ayios Yoannis) has been built the Trilye Town Hall. The ruins of the three monasteries, which were built during the Byzantine era, are out of Trilye. One of these is the Medikion Monastery (Hagios Sergios Monastery) located on the road to E\u015fkel Village. The monastery was built during the 8th century and is now operated as a farm.

The third ruin is the one of the Rhyakos Soteros Monastery known as the Aya Sotiri by the public. Most of the buildings of the monastery are ruined. However, their owners still use some buildings as shelters. Turks, who settled in the area during Yavuz Sultan Selim Time, also built a Turkish bath and a School in 1907. Those structures are regarded as important historical locations, which have also survived into modern day.\n\n==Panagia Pantobasilissa (Lady Queen of All) Church==\n\n{{main|Panagia Pantobasilissa church, Tirilye}}\nPanagia Pantobasilissa or Arched Church as it is called in the region is known to be the first church where the walls were decorated with [[fresco]]es.\n\nIt is indicated in some handwritten scripts that the church was dedicated to [[Panagia]] Pantobasillissa (Mary Queen of All).

It has been declared as a protected monument by 1299/31.8.1990 decision of BURSA K\u00dcLT\u00dcR ve TAB\u0130AT VARLIKLARINI KORUMA KURULU B\u00dcRO M\u00dcD\u00dcRL\u00dc\u011e\u00dc.\n\n== Virgin Mary-Metropolis Church ==\n{{main| Virgin Mary- Metropolis Church, Tirilye}}\nThe complex, which was constructed in Trilye in 1878 as a Greek Church, after 1924 The Dar-\u00fcl Eytam School, which opens to the Stone School (being used for the workshops for carpentry and iron works for 400 students), and the \u201cD\u00fcndar House\", used as a mess house. The church had three vertical lines similar to all other churches(Vertical lines are separated with columns), but the abscissa of the church was demolished for creating a new entrance, causing the upper part of the entrance to be higher than the sides. The Church building was used as a mess hall until the school was closed in September 1927. Due to its function it was called \u201cmess hall\u201d until its restoration, which turned the building into Faruk \u00c7elik Cultural Center. Upon the request of the Greek Culture Delegation a ceremony was held in this building during the visit of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople|Bartholomew I]] to Tirilye on July 1, 2009. Starting from 2019 \"Theofaneia\" ceremony is held each year (on 19/1/2019 and 20/1/2020) by Patriarch Bartholomew.\n\n== Churches in the city==\nIn Triyle there were seven churches, three monasteries and three holy springs in Zeytinba\u011f\u0131 however only four of these churches have survived up until now and are Ayios Stefanos or Moni Hinolakou (Fatih Camii since 1661), Panagia Pantovasilissa (Kemer Kilise), Ayios Georgios Ano (known as Dundar's House) and Virgin Mary-Metropolis. Of the monasteries, only Ayios Ioannis Theologos (Pelekete) Monastery has even partially survived among the three monasteries. On one of the demolished churches (Ayios Yoannis) has been built the Trilye Town Hall. The ruins of the three monasteries, which were built during the Byzantine era, are out of Trilye. One of these is the Medikion Monastery (Hagios Sergios Monastery) located on the road to E\u015fkel Village. The monastery was built during the 8th century and is now operated as a farm. Today, all that remains are the perimeter walls, and the magnificent entrance doors, being{{convert|200|kg|0|abbr=on}}. The ruin of the second monastery is {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} far from the town and is called Hagios Ioannis Theologos (Pelekete) Aya Yani Monastery, which is known as the Ayani Ranch by the public. The monastery was built in 709 and used until 1922; only some ruins of the church and walls are remaining today. The third ruin is the one of the Rhyakos Soteros Monastery known as the Aya Sotiri by the public. Most of the buildings of the monastery are ruined. However, their owners still use some buildings as shelters. Turks, who settled in the area during Yavuz Sultan Selim Time, also built a Turkish bath and a School in 1907. Those structures are regarded as important historical locations, which have also survived into modern day.\n\n==Panagia Pantobasilissa (Lady Queen of All) Church==\n\n{{main|Panagia Pantobasilissa church, Tirilye}}\nPanagia Pantobasilissa or Arched Church as it is called in the region is known to be the first church where the walls were decorated with [[fresco]]es.\n\nIt is indicated in some handwritten scripts that the church was dedicated to [[Panagia]] Pantobasillissa (Mary Queen of All). The church is based on a [[Greek cross]] plan to in the east and west directions. Although the building is not used currently it has still survived. According to the construction style of its walls, it is believed that the building was constructed at the end of the 13th century. The church has pictures on its walls at different layers and is considered to be very important for Christians. The first layer of frescos were made at the start of the 14th century, the second layer of frescos were made in 1723. It is believed that the columns were brought from [[Alexandria]]. There are support pillars at the fa\u00e7ades and the public calls the building as the Arched Church.\n\n==D\u00fcndar House==\n{{main|Agios Ioannis church, Tirilye}}\n\nThe Hagios Ioannes Greek Church (Yuannes Church), which is known as the D\u00fcndar House in the region, has been transferred to private property after Greeks abandoned the region. Three-floored western part of the church, which was constructed in the 19th century, is currently being used as a residence. The main entrance is through a stone door. There are Byzantine decorations and stone ornaments on its walls.\n\n==Monastery of Hagios Sergios==\n{{main|Medikion monastery}}\n\nIt is located at the beginning of the road that leaves the main road in the south of Tirilye and leads to the land with olive groves. The monastery was established in the late 8th century, and produced some important [[iconodule]] figures during the [[Byzantine Iconoclasm]]. After that, its history is obscure; it is mentioned in 1054, and it is known that it burned down and was rebuilt in 1800\u201301, but had fallen into disuse by the end of the 19th century, Today, only the outer wall of the complex survives.\n\n==Pelekete monastery==\n{{main|Pelekete monastery}}\n\nThe ruin of the  monastery is {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=on}} far from the town and is called Hagios Ioannes Theologos (Pelekete) Aya Yani Monastery, which is known as the Ayani Ranch by the public.

It has been understood that the Genoese have used Trilye and Apemeia (Mudanya) ports for transporting the salt extracted from the northern part of the Appolonia Lake. Trilye was an important port for exporting the goods produced in the fertile lands to the center of the Byzantine Empire.{{fact|date=January 2019}}\n\n==Swallow's Nest (Historical Pine Teahouse) (Tarihi \u00c7aml\u0131 Kahve)==\n{{main|Swallow's Nest, Tirilye}}\n\nThe Historical Pine Coffee lies on a high hill past the Stone School and is referred as the balcony of Trilye.

Its walls were laid with rough stone and brick; in the laying system, typical lighting gaps peculiar to baths were allowed. The space above the g\u00f6bek ta\u015f\u0131 (heated marble platform on which one lies to sweat in a Turkish bath) is covered with two small domes. Other spaces are covered with broken-roof.

They developed a complex culture based on using the bison as their main source of food, and adopting horses in the 17th century from Spanish colonists.\n\nFrom the 16th century to 18th century, the [[Kingdom of France]] claimed ownership of large parts of [[North America]] both east and west of the Mississippi River. In 1762, after losing the [[French and Indian War]] to Great Britain, France secretly ceded [[New France]] to [[Spain]], per the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]]. In 1763 France ceded its territories east of the Mississippi River to Great Britain.\n\nIt regained the western territory under [[Napoleon]], who sold it in 1803 to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. He had decided to get rid of the New World territories after failing to regain control of [[Saint-Domingue]], where a slave rebellion had toppled colonial control. In 1804 [[Haiti]] declared independence as the second republic of the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe Plains Indians retained control of much of their territory until the late 19th century, giving way finally before superior United States arms and technology. Their territories were invaded by settlers, and crossed by the development of improved routes for settlers' emigrant wagon trains to the West Coast, followed by more permanent construction of transcontinental railroads. These brought tens of thousands of settlers to the Plains.\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.  In 1803, most of the land for [[History of Kansas|modern day Kansas]] was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile [[Louisiana Purchase]] for 2.83 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] per [[acre]].\n\nIn 1854, the [[Kansas Territory]] was organized; and in 1861 [[Kansas]] became the 34th [[U.S. state]].  '''Ellsworth County''' was established February 26, 1867.  The county was named after the old [[Fort Ellsworth]], named in honor of 2nd Lieutenant Allen Ellsworth of the 7th Iowa Cavalry (Company H), who supervised construction of the fort in 1864 during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

The fort was subsequently moved to a new site about one mile to the northeast, and the old fort's remaining buildings were ordered torn down in June 1867.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nOn March 22, 1869, Fourteen [[Pawnee people|Pawnee Indians]], including scouts who had been honorably discharged after working for the army, were traveling through Ellsworth County when they ran into U.S. cavalry troops. Though the Pawnees had discharge papers from the army, a fight ensued. The Indians retreated to a sandstone cave, known today as Palmer's Cave. Their attackers set fire to grass at the cave's entrance, and six to nine Pawnees were killed as they ran out. The others died from exposure without their possessions. A few days later, the post surgeon at nearby [[Fort Harker (Kansas)|Fort Harker]], in today's town of [[Kanopolis, Kansas|Kanopolis]], removed six heads from their bodies, and shipped them to the Army Medical Museum in Washington, D.C., for cranial study.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Unspeakable Sadness: The Dispossession of the Nebraska Indians|last=Wishart|first=David|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=182, 183|quote=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kansaspublicradio.org/kpr-news/painting-symbolizes-dark-chapter-kansas-history-one-youve-likely-never|title=Spencer Painting Symbolizes Dark Chapter of Kansas History Few Have Ever Read|date=2017-01-27|newspaper=Kansas Public Radio|access-date=2017-02-13|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the later 19th century, this area became known for cattle ranching and cattle drives.

They developed a complex culture based on using the bison as their main source of food, and adopting horses in the 17th century from Spanish colonists.\n\nFrom the 16th century to 18th century, the [[Kingdom of France]] claimed ownership of large parts of [[North America]] both east and west of the Mississippi River. In 1762, after losing the [[French and Indian War]] to Great Britain, France secretly ceded [[New France]] to [[Spain]], per the [[Treaty of Fontainebleau (1762)|Treaty of Fontainebleau]]. In 1763 France ceded its territories east of the Mississippi River to Great Britain.\n\nIt regained the western territory under [[Napoleon]], who sold it in 1803 to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. He had decided to get rid of the New World territories after failing to regain control of [[Saint-Domingue]], where a slave rebellion had toppled colonial control. In 1804 [[Haiti]] declared independence as the second republic of the Western Hemisphere.\n\nThe Plains Indians retained control of much of their territory until the late 19th century, giving way finally before superior United States arms and technology. Their territories were invaded by settlers, and crossed by the development of improved routes for settlers' emigrant wagon trains to the West Coast, followed by more permanent construction of transcontinental railroads. These brought tens of thousands of settlers to the Plains.\n\n===19th century===\nIn 1802, Spain returned most of the land to France, but keeping title to about 7,500 square miles.  In 1803, most of the land for [[History of Kansas|modern day Kansas]] was acquired by the United States from France as part of the 828,000 square mile [[Louisiana Purchase]] for 2.83 [[Penny (United States coin)|cents]] per [[acre]].\n\nIn 1854, the [[Kansas Territory]] was organized; and in 1861 [[Kansas]] became the 34th [[U.S. state]].  '''Ellsworth County''' was established February 26, 1867.  The county was named after the old [[Fort Ellsworth]], named in honor of 2nd Lieutenant Allen Ellsworth of the 7th Iowa Cavalry (Company H), who supervised construction of the fort in 1864 during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

The fort was subsequently moved to a new site about one mile to the northeast, and the old fort's remaining buildings were ordered torn down in June 1867.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nOn March 22, 1869, Fourteen [[Pawnee people|Pawnee Indians]], including scouts who had been honorably discharged after working for the army, were traveling through Ellsworth County when they ran into U.S. cavalry troops. Though the Pawnees had discharge papers from the army, a fight ensued. The Indians retreated to a sandstone cave, known today as Palmer's Cave. Their attackers set fire to grass at the cave\u2019s entrance, and six to nine Pawnees were killed as they ran out. The others died from exposure without their possessions. A few days later, the post surgeon at nearby [[Fort Harker (Kansas)|Fort Harker]], in today\u2019s town of [[Kanopolis, Kansas|Kanopolis]], removed six heads from their bodies, and shipped them to the Army Medical Museum in Washington, D.C., for cranial study.<ref>{{Cite book|title=An Unspeakable Sadness: The Dispossession of the Nebraska Indians|last=Wishart|first=David|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=182, 183|quote=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kansaspublicradio.org/kpr-news/painting-symbolizes-dark-chapter-kansas-history-one-youve-likely-never|title=Spencer Painting Symbolizes Dark Chapter of Kansas History Few Have Ever Read|date=2017-01-27|newspaper=Kansas Public Radio|access-date=2017-02-13|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn the later 19th century, this area became known for cattle ranching and cattle drives.
