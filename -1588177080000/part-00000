During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the airport was used by fighters of [[Royal Air Force]]. Commercial activity and [[general aviation]] flight training at Luton resumed during 1952. By the 1960s, Luton Airport was playing a key role in the development of the [[package holiday]] business; by 1969, a fifth of all holiday flights from the UK departed from Luton Airport. From the mid-1960s, [[business aircraft|executive aircraft]] have been based at the airport. During the late 1970s, an expansion plan was initiated at Luton to accommodate as many as 5 million passengers per year, although the airport experienced a reduction in passenger numbers in the 1980s. In 1990, the airport was renamed ''London Luton Airport'' to re-emphasise the airport's proximity to the capital. \n\nThe arrival of new operators at Luton during 1990s, such as [[charter flight|charter operator]] [[MyTravel Group]] and new [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost]] scheduled flights from [[Debonair (airline)|Debonair]] and [[EasyJet]], contributed to a rapid increase in passenger numbers that made it the fastest growing major airport in the UK. In August 1997, to fund an \u00a380&nbsp;million extension of the airport, a 30-year concession contract was issued to a [[public-private partnership]] consortium, ''London Luton Airport Operations Limited''. Throughout the 1990s, \u00a330 million was invested in Luton's infrastructure and facilities. In November 1999, a new \u00a340 million terminal was opened by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]]; the new building houses 60 check-in desks, baggage and flight information systems and a range of commercial outlets. During 2004/5, the departure and arrivals lounges and other facilities were redeveloped at a cost of \u00a338 million.\n\nIn 2018, over 16.5 million passengers passed through the airport, a record total for Luton making it the [[Busiest airports in the United Kingdom by total passenger traffic|fifth \nbusiest airport]] in the UK.<ref name=\"stats\">{{cite web |url=http://www.caa.co.uk/Data-and-analysis/UK-aviation-market/Airports/Datasets/ |title=Aircraft and passenger traffic data from UK airports |publisher=[[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|UK Civil Aviation Authority]] |date=3 March 2017 |accessdate=14 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211070518/http://www.caa.co.uk/Data-and-analysis/UK-aviation-market/Airports/Datasets/ |archive-date=11 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is the fourth-largest airport serving the London area after [[Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] and [[Stansted Airport|Stansted]], and is one of London's six international airports along with [[London City Airport|London City]] and [[Southend Airport|Southend]]. The airport serves as a base for [[EasyJet]], [[TUI Airways]], [[Ryanair]] and [[Wizz Air]] and previously served as a base for [[Monarch Airlines]] until it ceased operations in October 2017.

From the mid-1960s, [[business aircraft|executive aircraft]] have been based at the airport, initially operated by McAlpine Aviation. These activities have grown and several executive jet operators and maintenance companies are currently based at Luton.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nBy the 1960s, Luton Airport was playing a key role in the development of the [[package holiday]] business, the popularity of the foreign holiday had risen dramatically as the launch of new services had allowed greater numbers of people to travel abroad for the first time.<ref name = \"guide hist\"/> Luton became the operating base for several [[charter airline]]s, such as [[Court Line#Autair|Autair]] (which went on to become [[Court Line#Court Line|Court Line]]), [[Britannia Airways|Euravia]] (now [[TUI Airways]], following Euravia's change of name to [[Britannia Airways]] and subsequent merger with [[First Choice Airways]] and TUI rebrand) and [[Dan-Air]].\n\nBy 1969, a fifth of all holiday flights from the UK departed from Luton Airport; during 1972, Luton Airport was the most profitable airport in the country.<ref name = \"guide hist\"/> However, Luton suffered a severe setback in August 1974 when major [[package holiday]] operator [[Clarksons Travel Group|Clarksons]] and its in-house airline [[Court Line]] (which also operated coach links) ceased operations and were [[Liquidation|liquidated]].<ref name=\"history\"/> Nevertheless, by 1978, the airport's management initiated an expansion plan as to allow Luton to accommodate as many as 5 million passengers per year.<ref name = \"guide hist\"/>\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\n[[File:LondonLutonAirportOriginal.svg|thumb|The airport's logo 2001-2005]]\n[[File:Luton Airport logo.svg|thumb|The airport's logo 2005-2014]]\nDuring the 1980s, the airport experienced a decline in customer numbers; this was due to lack of reinvestment while the nearby [[Stansted Airport]], which was also located north of London, was growing. The council responded to lobbying and focused again on developing the airport. During 1985, a new international terminal building was opened by [[Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]].<ref name = \"guide hist\"/> Further updates and changes over the following 15 years were made, including the opening of a new international terminal an automated baggage handling facility, a new control tower with updated air traffic control systems, a new cargo centre and runway upgrades. In 1987, Luton Airport became a [[limited company]], of which Luton Borough Council was the sole shareholder; this reorganisation was taken as it was felt that the airport ought to be operated at arm's length via an independent management team.<ref name = \"guide hist\"/>\n\nWhile developing the basic infrastructure, various business partners were courted and business models were considered. The process envisaged a cargo centre, an airport railway station, and people mover from station to airport terminal (hence the unused underpass parallel to the road as you approach the terminal).{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} During 1991, an attempt was made to sell Luton Airport, but it would be unsuccessful; instead, a new management team was appointed to turnaround the business, stem the losses, and improve passenger numbers. Over the following five years, \u00a330 million was invested in Luton's infrastructure and facilities.<ref name = \"guide hist\"/>\n\nOriginally, the airport's runways had been grass tracks 18/36 and 06/24, and then a concrete runway 08/26. By the end of the 1980s, there was only one runway, 08/26. The 18/36 grass runway had disappeared under a [[landfill]], while 06/24 had effectively become a [[taxiway]]. For Luton to maintain viability, it was necessary to update airfield services, and achieve [[Instrument landing system#ILS categories|CAT III]] status. This meant updating the [[instrument landing system]] (ILS); glidepath and localiser and removing the hump in the runway; even a six-foot person could not see one end of the runway from the other. The hump was removed by building up layers at the end of the runway; this was done over 72 successive nights between October 1988 and February 1989, with the height being raised 90&nbsp;mm on one particular night. During the course of this work, the airport would re-open for flights during the day.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn 1990, the airport was renamed ''London Luton Airport'' to re-emphasise the airport's proximity to the UK capital.<ref name = \"guide hist\"/> In 1991, another setback occurred when [[Ryanair]], which had flown from the airport to [[Ireland]] for a number of years, transferred its London operating base from Luton to rival Stansted. This move was attributed as causing a decline in passenger numbers at Luton.<ref name = \"guide hist\"/> Later in the 1990s, [[MyTravel Group]] began [[charter flight]]s from the airport, using the ''[[Airtours International Airways|Airtours]]'' brand and new [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost]] scheduled flights from [[Debonair (airline)|Debonair]] and [[EasyJet]], the latter making Luton its base.<ref name=\"history\"/> The arrival of these new operators marked a rapid increase in passenger numbers; during 1997/1998, 3.4 million people travelled via the airport, while 4.4 million travellers were recording during the following year, making Luton Airport the fastest growing major airport in the UK.<ref name = \"guide hist\"/>\n\nIn August 1997, to fund an \u00a380&nbsp;million extension of the airport, the council issued a 30-year concession contract to a [[public-private partnership]] consortium, London Luton Airport Operations Limited, a partnership of Airport Group International (AGI) and [[Barclays]] Private Equity.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], the airport was used by fighters of [[Royal Air Force]]. Commercial activity and [[general aviation]] flight training at Luton resumed during 1952. By the 1960s, Luton Airport was playing a key role in the development of the [[package holiday]] business; by 1969, a fifth of all holiday flights from the UK departed from Luton Airport. From the mid-1960s, [[business aircraft|executive aircraft]] have been based at the airport. During the late 1970s, an expansion plan was initiated at Luton to accommodate as many as 5 million passengers per year, although the airport experienced a reduction in passenger numbers in the 1980s. In 1990, the airport was renamed ''London Luton Airport'' to re-emphasise the airport's proximity to the capital. \n\nThe arrival of new operators at Luton during 1990s, such as [[charter flight|charter operator]] [[MyTravel Group]] and new [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost]] scheduled flights from [[Debonair (airline)|Debonair]] and [[EasyJet]], contributed to a rapid increase in passenger numbers that made it the fastest growing major airport in the UK. In August 1997, to fund an \u00a380&nbsp;million extension of the airport, a 30-year concession contract was issued to a [[public-private partnership]] consortium, ''London Luton Airport Operations Limited''. Throughout the 1990s, \u00a330 million was invested in Luton's infrastructure and facilities. In November 1999, a new \u00a340 million terminal was opened by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]]; the new building houses 60 check-in desks, baggage and flight information systems and a range of commercial outlets. During 2004/5, the departure and arrivals lounges and other facilities were redeveloped at a cost of \u00a338 million.\n\nIn 2018, over 16.5 million passengers passed through the airport, a record total for Luton making it the [[Busiest airports in the United Kingdom by total passenger traffic|fifth \nbusiest airport]] in the UK.<ref name=\"stats\">{{cite web |url=http://www.caa.co.uk/Data-and-analysis/UK-aviation-market/Airports/Datasets/ |title=Aircraft and passenger traffic data from UK airports |publisher=[[Civil Aviation Authority (United Kingdom)|UK Civil Aviation Authority]] |date=3 March 2017 |accessdate=14 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170211070518/http://www.caa.co.uk/Data-and-analysis/UK-aviation-market/Airports/Datasets/ |archive-date=11 February 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is the fourth-largest airport serving the London area after [[Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] and [[Stansted Airport|Stansted]], and is one of London's six international airports along with [[London City Airport|London City]] and [[Southend Airport|Southend]].

These activities have grown and several executive jet operators and maintenance companies are currently based at Luton.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nBy the 1960s, Luton Airport was playing a key role in the development of the [[package holiday]] business, the popularity of the foreign holiday had risen dramatically as the launch of new services had allowed greater numbers of people to travel abroad for the first time.<ref name = \"guide hist\"/> Luton became the operating base for several [[charter airline]]s, such as [[Court Line#Autair|Autair]] (which went on to become [[Court Line#Court Line|Court Line]]), [[Britannia Airways|Euravia]] (now [[TUI Airways]], following Euravia's change of name to [[Britannia Airways]] and subsequent merger with [[First Choice Airways]] and TUI rebrand) and [[Dan-Air]].\n\nBy 1969, a fifth of all holiday flights from the UK departed from Luton Airport; during 1972, Luton Airport was the most profitable airport in the country.<ref name = \"guide hist\"/> However, Luton suffered a severe setback in August 1974 when major [[package holiday]] operator [[Clarksons Travel Group|Clarksons]] and its in-house airline [[Court Line]] (which also operated coach links) ceased operations and were [[Liquidation|liquidated]].<ref name=\"history\"/> Nevertheless, by 1978, the airport's management initiated an expansion plan as to allow Luton to accommodate as many as 5 million passengers per year.<ref name = \"guide hist\"/>\n\n===1980s and 1990s===\n[[File:LondonLutonAirportOriginal.svg|thumb|The airport's logo 2001-2005]]\n[[File:Luton Airport logo.svg|thumb|The airport's logo 2005-2014]]\nDuring the 1980s, the airport experienced a decline in customer numbers; this was due to lack of reinvestment while the nearby [[Stansted Airport]], which was also located north of London, was growing. The council responded to lobbying and focused again on developing the airport. During 1985, a new international terminal building was opened by [[Prince of Wales|The Prince of Wales]].<ref name = \"guide hist\"/> Further updates and changes over the following 15 years were made, including the opening of a new international terminal an automated baggage handling facility, a new control tower with updated air traffic control systems, a new cargo centre and runway upgrades. In 1987, Luton Airport became a [[limited company]], of which Luton Borough Council was the sole shareholder; this reorganisation was taken as it was felt that the airport ought to be operated at arm's length via an independent management team.<ref name = \"guide hist\"/>\n\nWhile developing the basic infrastructure, various business partners were courted and business models were considered. The process envisaged a cargo centre, an airport railway station, and people mover from station to airport terminal (hence the unused underpass parallel to the road as you approach the terminal).{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} During 1991, an attempt was made to sell Luton Airport, but it would be unsuccessful; instead, a new management team was appointed to turnaround the business, stem the losses, and improve passenger numbers. Over the following five years, \u00a330 million was invested in Luton's infrastructure and facilities.<ref name = \"guide hist\"/>\n\nOriginally, the airport's runways had been grass tracks 18/36 and 06/24, and then a concrete runway 08/26. By the end of the 1980s, there was only one runway, 08/26. The 18/36 grass runway had disappeared under a [[landfill]], while 06/24 had effectively become a [[taxiway]]. For Luton to maintain viability, it was necessary to update airfield services, and achieve [[Instrument landing system#ILS categories|CAT III]] status. This meant updating the [[instrument landing system]] (ILS); glidepath and localiser and removing the hump in the runway; even a six-foot person could not see one end of the runway from the other. The hump was removed by building up layers at the end of the runway; this was done over 72 successive nights between October 1988 and February 1989, with the height being raised 90&nbsp;mm on one particular night. During the course of this work, the airport would re-open for flights during the day.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn 1990, the airport was renamed ''London Luton Airport'' to re-emphasise the airport's proximity to the UK capital.<ref name = \"guide hist\"/> In 1991, another setback occurred when [[Ryanair]], which had flown from the airport to [[Ireland]] for a number of years, transferred its London operating base from Luton to rival Stansted. This move was attributed as causing a decline in passenger numbers at Luton.<ref name = \"guide hist\"/> Later in the 1990s, [[MyTravel Group]] began [[charter flight]]s from the airport, using the ''[[Airtours International Airways|Airtours]]'' brand and new [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost]] scheduled flights from [[Debonair (airline)|Debonair]] and [[EasyJet]], the latter making Luton its base.<ref name=\"history\"/> The arrival of these new operators marked a rapid increase in passenger numbers; during 1997/1998, 3.4 million people travelled via the airport, while 4.4 million travellers were recording during the following year, making Luton Airport the fastest growing major airport in the UK.<ref name = \"guide hist\"/>\n\nIn August 1997, to fund an \u00a380&nbsp;million extension of the airport, the council issued a 30-year concession contract to a [[public-private partnership]] consortium, London Luton Airport Operations Limited, a partnership of Airport Group International (AGI) and [[Barclays]] Private Equity. AGI was a specialist airport management and development company once owned by [[Lockheed Martin]]. In 1999, AGI was sold to [[TBI plc]]; in 2001, Barclays also sold its shares in Luton to TBI plc.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nThe main feature of the development phase in 1998 was a \u00a340&nbsp;million terminal made from aluminium and glass, based on an original design by [[Foster + Partners]]. The new terminal, which was officially opened in November 1999 by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] and [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Prince Philip]], houses 60 check-in desks, baggage and flight information systems and a wide range of shops, restaurants and bars.<ref name=\"history\"/> During late 1999, British railway infrastructure company [[Railtrack]] opened the new [[Luton Airport Parkway railway station]]; built at a cost of \u00a323 million, the station facilitated a travel time to central London of less than 30 minutes.<ref name = \"guide hist\"/>\n\n===Development since the 2000s===\n[[File:Luton_Airport_-_geograph.org.uk_-_560676.jpg|thumb|The terminal exterior prior to its major expansion]]\n[[File:Luton airport3.JPG|thumb|Waiting area]]\n[[File:Boarding gates and apron at London Luton Airport - geograph.org.uk - 1446390.jpg|thumb|Apron]]\nIn September 2004, Luton Airport embarked on a 10-month project to develop the departure and arrivals lounges and other facilities at a cost of \u00a338 million; this work included a {{convert|9000|sqft|-2|abbr=on}} area featuring a spectacular vaulted ceiling was completed with the new terminal, but intended to lie unused until required.

A full-length runway would increase airlines' operational flexibility by enabling the use of aircraft that have a greater [[payload (air and space craft)|payload]] capacity and longer [[range (aircraft)|range]] than is currently possible.

The airport is linked to M1's Junction 10 by the dual-carriageway A1081 road. There is a short stay car park adjacent to the terminal, together with medium and long term on airport car parks to the west and east of the terminal respectively and linked to the terminal by shuttle buses. Pre-booked off airport parking is also available from several independent operators.\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:Luton Airport Parkway railway station.jpg|thumb|[[First Capital Connect]] train at [[Luton Airport Parkway railway station|Luton Airport Parkway]]]]\n[[Luton Airport Parkway railway station|Luton Airport Parkway]] has since 1999 served the airport. It is on the [[Midland Main Line]] from [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]], between which, journeys take as little as 22 minutes, on services branded [[East Midlands Railway|EMR]].\n\n*[[Thameslink and Great Northern|Thameslink]] is the primary operator, with services running from the station to [[Bedford railway station|Bedford]], [[St Albans City railway station|St Albans]], London, [[Wimbledon railway station|Wimbledon]], [[Sutton railway station, London|Sutton]], [[Gatwick Airport railway station|Gatwick Airport]] and [[Brighton railway station|Brighton]].\n\n*[[East Midlands Railway]] operate semi-fast services calling at the station hourly. These trains run south directly to London St Pancras and north to Bedford, [[Wellingborough railway station|Wellingborough]], [[Kettering railway station|Kettering]], [[Corby railway station|Corby]], [[Market Harborough railway station|Market Harborough]], [[Leicester railway station|Leicester]], [[Loughborough railway station|Loughborough]], [[Beeston railway station|Beeston]] and [[Nottingham railway station|Nottingham]].\n\nA shuttle bus service connects the station to the airport, a distance of just over a mile.
