Although it was built primarily for baseball, its general shape was very similar to the major league [[multi-purpose stadium]]s that were beginning to emerge in the mid-1960s. The Metroplex had been mentioned as a possible expansion site since the 1950s, and Arlington Mayor [[Tom Vandergriff]] figured that Arlington, halfway between the two cities, would be the best site for a prospective major league team.\n\n===1970s&ndash;1980s===\nIn 1971, the struggling [[Washington Senators (1961\u201371)|Washington Senators]] announced their intentions to move to the Metroplex as the Texas Rangers.

In his book ''Storied Stadiums'', [[Curt Smith (author)|Curt Smith]] described it as \"small, (but) not intimate\".\n\nThe scoreboard in the Rangers' early days was a long, horizontal [[rectangle]] with a panel shaped like the state of [[Texas]].

First, before installation of the wrap-around scoreboard and billboards, the predominant gusty winds from the south knocked down many fly balls that would otherwise have been home runs. Second, the large number of metal bleacher seats came in handy on Bat Night, the promotional game in most years when children age 13 and under received a real bat that could be pounded on the bleachers. Some seasons, it was the only sell-out for the usually poor Rangers squads, and the spectacle of 10,000-15,000 kids banging their bats all at once created a deafening sound.\n\n===1990s===\n[[File:Arlington Stadium site 2012.JPG|thumb|250px|A large portion of the stadium's site is now occupied by an empty field, pictured in 2012.

The bleachers were painted green, but their original blue color is occasionally visible in spots where the green paint has chipped. Home plate was inserted into place at the Ballpark in Arlington by Tom Schieffer (Texas Rangers President), Richard Greene (then mayor of Arlington), Tom Vandergriff (former mayor responsible for bringing the team to Arlington), and [[George W.

Fighting for control of the territory in the [[French and Indian War]] (1754-1763) became part of the international [[Seven Years' War]] (1756-1763). During this period, the region routinely suffered turmoil, massacres, and battles. The 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] ceded the Ohio Country to the [[British Empire]].\n\n===Virginia Military District===\nAfter the [[American Revolution]], the [[Virginia Military District]] became part of Ohio Country as a territory of Virginia. Colonists from the East Coast moved in, but rather than finding an empty [[frontier]], they encountered people of the [[Miami tribe|Miami]], [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]], [[Shawnee]], and [[Mingo]] nations, as well as European traders. The tribes resisted expansion by the fledgling United States, leading to years of bitter conflict. The decisive [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] resulted in the [[Treaty of Greenville]], which finally opened the way for new settlements. By 1797, a young [[surveying|surveyor]] from [[Virginia]] named [[Lucas Sullivant]] had founded a permanent settlement on the west bank of the forks of the Scioto River and Olentangy River. An admirer of [[Benjamin Franklin]], Sullivant chose to name his [[frontier]] village \"[[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]]\".<ref>Lentz, p. 33</ref> The location was desirable for its proximity to [[Navigability|navigable]] rivers\u2014but Sullivant was initially foiled when, in 1798, a large [[flood]] wiped out the new settlement.<ref>Moore, p. 101</ref> He persevered, and the village was rebuilt.\n\nAfter the Revolution land comprising parts of Franklin and adjacent counties was set aside by the [[United States Congress]] for settlement by [[Canadians]] and [[Nova Scotia]]ns who were sympathetic to the colonial cause and had their land and possessions seized by the British government.  The [[Refugee Tract]], consisting of over 103,000 acres, was 42 miles long and 3 to 4 1/2 miles wide, was claimed in part by 62 eligible men.  The Statehouse sits on land once contained in the Refugee Tract.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Columbus City Hall (16095449327).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Old City Hall, completed in 1872, demolished in 1921]]\nAfter Ohio achieved statehood in 1803, political infighting among prominent Ohio leaders led to the state capital moving from [[Chillicothe, Ohio|Chillicothe]] to [[Zanesville, Ohio|Zanesville]] and back again. Desiring to settle on a location, the state legislature considered [[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]], [[Dublin, Ohio|Dublin]], [[Worthington, Ohio|Worthington]], and [[Delaware, Ohio|Delaware]] before compromising on a plan to build a new city in the state's center, near major transportation routes, primarily rivers. Named in honor of Christopher Columbus, the city was founded on February 14, 1812, on the \"High Banks opposite Franklinton at the Forks of the Scioto most known as Wolf's Ridge.\"<ref>Lentz, pp. 41\u201343</ref> At the time, this area was a dense forestland, used only as a hunting ground.<ref>Moore, p. 122</ref>\n\nThe \"[[Columbus City Council|Burough of Columbus]]\" {{sic}} was officially established on February 10, 1816.<ref>Moore, pp. 135\u2013136</ref> Nine people were elected to fill the various positions of Mayor, Treasurer, and several others. In 1816-1817, [[Jarvis W. Pike]] would serve as the 1st Mayor. Although the recent [[War of 1812]] had brought prosperity to the area, the subsequent recession and conflicting claims to the land threatened the new town's success. Early conditions were abysmal with frequent bouts of fevers and an outbreak of [[cholera]] in 1833.<ref>Moore, pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nThe [[National Road]] reached Columbus from [[Baltimore]] in 1831, which complemented the city's new link to the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]] and facilitated a population boom.<ref>Lentz, p. 58</ref> A wave of European [[immigrants]] led to the creation of two ethnic [[enclave]]s on the city's outskirts. A large [[Irish people|Irish]] population settled in the north along Naghten Street (presently Nationwide Boulevard), while the [[Germans]] took advantage of the cheap land to the south, creating a community that came to be known as the ''[[German Village|Das Alte S\u00fcdende]]'' (The Old South End).

North\u2013south streets run 12 degrees west of due north, parallel to High Street; the avenues (vis. Fifth Avenue, Sixth Avenue, Seventh Avenue, and so on) run east\u2013west.<ref>Moore, p. 127</ref>\n\nThe address system begins its numbering at the intersection of Broad and High, with numbers increasing in magnitude with distance from Broad or High. Numbered avenues begin with First Avenue, about {{convert|1+1/4|mi|abbr=on}} north of Broad Street, and increase in number as one progresses northward. Numbered streets begin with Second Street, which is two blocks west of High Street, and Third Street, which is a block east of High Street, then progress eastward from there. Even-numbered addresses are on the north and east sides of streets, putting odd addresses on the south and west sides of streets. A difference of 700 house numbers means a distance of about {{convert|1|mi|abbr=on}} (along the same street).<ref name=\"fracomap\" /> For example, 351 W 5th Avenue is approximately {{convert|1/2|mi|m|abbr=on}} west of High Street on the south side of Fifth Avenue. Buildings along north\u2013south streets are numbered in a similar manner: the building number indicates the approximate distance from Broad Street, the prefixes 'N' and 'S' indicate whether that distance is to be measured to the north or south of Broad Street and the street number itself indicates how far the street is from the center of the city at the intersection of Broad and High.\n\nThis street numbering system does not hold true over a large area. The area served by numbered avenues runs from about Marble Cliff to South Linden to the Airport, and the area served by numbered streets covers Downtown and nearby neighborhoods to the east and south, with only a few exceptions. There are quite few intersections between numbered streets and avenues. Furthermore, named streets and avenues can have any orientation. For example, while all of the numbered avenues run east\u2013west, perpendicular to High Street, many named, non-numbered avenues run north\u2013south, parallel to High. The same is true of many named streets: while the numbered streets in the city run north\u2013south, perpendicular to Broad Street, many named, non-numbered streets run east\u2013west, perpendicular to High Street.\n\nThe addressing system, however, covers nearly all of Franklin County, with only a few older suburbs retaining self-centered address systems. The address scale of 700 per mile results in addresses approaching, but not usually reaching, 10,000 at the county's borders.\n\nOther major, local roads in Columbus include Main Street, Morse Road, Dublin-Granville Road ([[Ohio State Route 161|SR-161]]), Cleveland Avenue/Westerville Road ([[Ohio State Highway 3|SR-3]]), Olentangy River Road, Riverside Drive, Sunbury Road, Fifth Avenue, and Livingston Avenue.\n\n===Highways===\nColumbus is bisected by two major [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highways]], [[Interstate 70 (Ohio)|Interstate 70]] running east\u2013west, and [[Interstate 71 (Ohio)|Interstate 71]] running north to roughly southwest. They combine downtown for about {{convert|1.5|mi|abbr=on}} in an area locally known as \"The Split\", which is a major [[traffic congestion]] point, especially during [[rush hour]]. [[U.S. Route 40 in Ohio|U.S. Route 40]], originally known as the [[National Road]], runs east\u2013west through Columbus, comprising Main Street to the east of downtown and Broad Street to the west. [[U.S. Route 23 (Ohio)|U.S. Route 23]] runs roughly north\u2013south, while [[U.S. Route 33 (Ohio)|U.S. Route 33]] runs northwest-to-southeast. The [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|Interstate 270]] [[Beltway|Outerbelt]] encircles most of the city, while the newly redesigned Innerbelt consists of the [[Interstate 670 (Ohio)|Interstate 670]] spur on the north side (which continues to the east past the Airport and to the west where it merges with I-70), [[Ohio State Highway 315|State Route 315]] on the west side, the I-70/71 split on the south side, and I-71 on the east.

Fighting for control of the territory in the [[French and Indian War]] (1754-1763) became part of the international [[Seven Years' War]] (1756-1763). During this period, the region routinely suffered turmoil, massacres, and battles. The 1763 [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] ceded the Ohio Country to the [[British Empire]].\n\n===Virginia Military District===\nAfter the [[American Revolution]], the [[Virginia Military District]] became part of Ohio Country as a territory of Virginia. Colonists from the East Coast moved in, but rather than finding an empty [[frontier]], they encountered people of the [[Miami tribe|Miami]], [[Lenape|Delaware]], [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]], [[Shawnee]], and [[Mingo]] nations, as well as European traders. The tribes resisted expansion by the fledgling United States, leading to years of bitter conflict. The decisive [[Battle of Fallen Timbers]] resulted in the [[Treaty of Greenville]], which finally opened the way for new settlements. By 1797, a young [[surveying|surveyor]] from [[Virginia]] named [[Lucas Sullivant]] had founded a permanent settlement on the west bank of the forks of the Scioto River and Olentangy River. An admirer of [[Benjamin Franklin]], Sullivant chose to name his [[frontier]] village \"[[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]]\".<ref>Lentz, p. 33</ref> The location was desirable for its proximity to [[Navigability|navigable]] rivers\u2014but Sullivant was initially foiled when, in 1798, a large [[flood]] wiped out the new settlement.<ref>Moore, p. 101</ref> He persevered, and the village was rebuilt.\n\nAfter the Revolution land comprising parts of Franklin and adjacent counties was set aside by the [[United States Congress]] for settlement by [[Canadians]] and [[Nova Scotia]]ns who were sympathetic to the colonial cause and had their land and possessions seized by the British government.  The [[Refugee Tract]], consisting of over 103,000 acres, was 42 miles long and 3 to 4 1/2 miles wide, was claimed in part by 62 eligible men.  The Statehouse sits on land once contained in the Refugee Tract.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Columbus City Hall (16095449327).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Old City Hall, completed in 1872, demolished in 1921]]\nAfter Ohio achieved statehood in 1803, political infighting among prominent Ohio leaders led to the state capital moving from [[Chillicothe, Ohio|Chillicothe]] to [[Zanesville, Ohio|Zanesville]] and back again. Desiring to settle on a location, the state legislature considered [[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]], [[Dublin, Ohio|Dublin]], [[Worthington, Ohio|Worthington]], and [[Delaware, Ohio|Delaware]] before compromising on a plan to build a new city in the state's center, near major transportation routes, primarily rivers. Named in honor of Christopher Columbus, the city was founded on February 14, 1812, on the \"High Banks opposite Franklinton at the Forks of the Scioto most known as Wolf's Ridge.\"<ref>Lentz, pp. 41\u201343</ref> At the time, this area was a dense forestland, used only as a hunting ground.<ref>Moore, p. 122</ref>\n\nThe \"[[Columbus City Council|Burough of Columbus]]\" {{sic}} was officially established on February 10, 1816.<ref>Moore, pp. 135\u2013136</ref> Nine people were elected to fill the various positions of Mayor, Treasurer, and several others. In 1816-1817, [[Jarvis W. Pike]] would serve as the 1st Mayor. Although the recent [[War of 1812]] had brought prosperity to the area, the subsequent recession and conflicting claims to the land threatened the new town's success. Early conditions were abysmal with frequent bouts of fevers and an outbreak of [[cholera]] in 1833.<ref>Moore, pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nThe [[National Road]] reached Columbus from [[Baltimore]] in 1831, which complemented the city's new link to the [[Ohio and Erie Canal]] and facilitated a population boom.<ref>Lentz, p. 58</ref> A wave of European [[immigrants]] led to the creation of two ethnic [[enclave]]s on the city's outskirts. A large [[Irish people|Irish]] population settled in the north along Naghten Street (presently Nationwide Boulevard), while the [[Germans]] took advantage of the cheap land to the south, creating a community that came to be known as the ''[[German Village|Das Alte S\u00fcdende]]'' (The Old South End). Columbus's German population constructed numerous breweries, [[Trinity Lutheran Seminary]], and [[Capital University]].<ref name = \"zuahxa\">Lentz, pp. 63\u201364</ref>\n\nWith a population of 3,500, Columbus was officially chartered as a city on March 3, 1834. On that day the legislature carried out a [[Private bill|special act]], which granted legislative authority to the [[city council]] and judicial authority to the mayor. Elections were held in April of that year, with voters choosing one [[John Brooks (mayor)|John Brooks]] as the first mayor.<ref>Moore, p. 156</ref> Columbus annexed the then-separate city of [[Franklinton, Columbus, Ohio|Franklinton]] in 1837.<ref name=\"test\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=HQ-DgBzxfx4C&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=columbus+annexed+franklinton#v=onepage&q=columbus%20annexed%20franklinton&f=false |title=Columbus 1860-1910 |date=April 26, 2006 |accessdate=March 15, 2013|isbn=9780738539621 |last1=Barrett |first1=Richard E. }}</ref>\n\nIn 1850, the [[Columbus and Xenia Railroad]] became the first railroad into the city, followed by the [[Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad]] in 1851.

The major daily newspaper in Columbus is ''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]''. There are also neighborhood/suburb specific papers, such as the Dispatch Printing Company's ''ThisWeek Community News'', , the ''[[Columbus Messenger]]'', and the ''Short North Gazette''. ''[[The Lantern]]'' and ''[[UWeekly]]'' serve the [[Ohio State University]] community. \"Alternative\" arts/culture/politics-oriented papers include [[Outlook Media]]'s ''Outlook: Columbus'' (serving the city's [[LGBT]] community), and ''[[Columbus Alive|aLIVE]]'' (formerly the independent ''Columbus Alive'' and now owned by the ''Columbus Dispatch'').

North\u2013south streets run 12 degrees west of due north, parallel to High Street; the avenues (vis. Fifth Avenue, Sixth Avenue, Seventh Avenue, and so on) run east\u2013west.<ref>Moore, p. 127</ref>\n\nThe address system begins its numbering at the intersection of Broad and High, with numbers increasing in magnitude with distance from Broad or High. Numbered avenues begin with First Avenue, about {{convert|1+1/4|mi|abbr=on}} north of Broad Street, and increase in number as one progresses northward. Numbered streets begin with Second Street, which is two blocks west of High Street, and Third Street, which is a block east of High Street, then progress eastward from there. Even-numbered addresses are on the north and east sides of streets, putting odd addresses on the south and west sides of streets. A difference of 700 house numbers means a distance of about {{convert|1|mi|abbr=on}} (along the same street).<ref name=\"fracomap\" /> For example, 351 W 5th Avenue is approximately {{convert|1/2|mi|m|abbr=on}} west of High Street on the south side of Fifth Avenue. Buildings along north\u2013south streets are numbered in a similar manner: the building number indicates the approximate distance from Broad Street, the prefixes 'N' and 'S' indicate whether that distance is to be measured to the north or south of Broad Street and the street number itself indicates how far the street is from the center of the city at the intersection of Broad and High.\n\nThis street numbering system does not hold true over a large area. The area served by numbered avenues runs from about Marble Cliff to South Linden to the Airport, and the area served by numbered streets covers Downtown and nearby neighborhoods to the east and south, with only a few exceptions. There are quite few intersections between numbered streets and avenues. Furthermore, named streets and avenues can have any orientation. For example, while all of the numbered avenues run east\u2013west, perpendicular to High Street, many named, non-numbered avenues run north\u2013south, parallel to High. The same is true of many named streets: while the numbered streets in the city run north\u2013south, perpendicular to Broad Street, many named, non-numbered streets run east\u2013west, perpendicular to High Street.\n\nThe addressing system, however, covers nearly all of Franklin County, with only a few older suburbs retaining self-centered address systems. The address scale of 700 per mile results in addresses approaching, but not usually reaching, 10,000 at the county's borders.\n\nOther major, local roads in Columbus include Main Street, Morse Road, Dublin-Granville Road ([[Ohio State Route 161|SR-161]]), Cleveland Avenue/Westerville Road ([[Ohio State Highway 3|SR-3]]), Olentangy River Road, Riverside Drive, Sunbury Road, Fifth Avenue, and Livingston Avenue.\n\n===Highways===\nColumbus is bisected by two major [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highways]], [[Interstate 70 (Ohio)|Interstate 70]] running east\u2013west, and [[Interstate 71 (Ohio)|Interstate 71]] running north to roughly southwest. They combine downtown for about {{convert|1.5|mi|abbr=on}} in an area locally known as \"The Split\", which is a major [[traffic congestion]] point, especially during [[rush hour]]. [[U.S. Route 40 in Ohio|U.S. Route 40]], originally known as the [[National Road]], runs east\u2013west through Columbus, comprising Main Street to the east of downtown and Broad Street to the west. [[U.S. Route 23 (Ohio)|U.S. Route 23]] runs roughly north\u2013south, while [[U.S. Route 33 (Ohio)|U.S. Route 33]] runs northwest-to-southeast. The [[Interstate 270 (Ohio)|Interstate 270]] [[Beltway|Outerbelt]] encircles most of the city, while the newly redesigned Innerbelt consists of the [[Interstate 670 (Ohio)|Interstate 670]] spur on the north side (which continues to the east past the Airport and to the west where it merges with I-70), [[Ohio State Highway 315|State Route 315]] on the west side, the I-70/71 split on the south side, and I-71 on the east. Due to its central location within Ohio and abundance of outbound roadways, nearly all of the state's destinations are within a 2 or 3 hour drive of Columbus.\n\n===Bridges===\n[[File:Broad Street Bridge Columbus 2018a.jpg|thumb|The [[Discovery Bridge (Columbus, Ohio)|Discovery Bridge]]]]\nThe Columbus riverfront hosts several bridges.

This is usually the opposite of the desired effect when welding, as it tends to embrittle the site, but may not be a problem for general mild steel welding, where ultimate ductility is not a major concern.\n\nIt is used in many consumer products that require pressurized gas because it is inexpensive and nonflammable, and because it undergoes a phase transition from gas to liquid at room temperature at an attainable pressure of approximately 60 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (870 psi, 59 atm), allowing far more carbon dioxide to fit in a given container than otherwise would. Life jackets often contain canisters of pressured carbon dioxide for quick inflation. [[Aluminium]] capsules of {{CO2}} are also sold as supplies of compressed gas for [[air gun]]s, [[paintball]] markers/guns, inflating bicycle tires, and for making [[carbonated water]]. Rapid vaporization of liquid carbon dioxide is used for blasting in coal mines.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} High concentrations of carbon dioxide can also be used to kill pests.

It does not itself react to extinguish the flame, but starves the flame of oxygen by displacing it. Some [[Fire extinguisher#Clean agents and carbon dioxide|fire extinguishers]], especially those designed for electrical fires, contain liquid carbon dioxide under pressure. Carbon dioxide extinguishers work well on small flammable liquid and electrical fires, but not on ordinary combustible fires, because although it excludes oxygen, it does not cool the burning substances significantly and when the carbon dioxide disperses they are free to catch fire upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen. Their desirability in electrical fire stems from the fact that, unlike water or other chemical based methods, Carbon dioxide will not cause short circuits, leading to even more damage to equipment. Because it is a gas, it is also easy to dispense large amounts of the gas automatically in IT infrastructure rooms, where the fire itself might be hard to reach with more immediate methods because it is behind rack doors and inside of cases. Carbon dioxide has also been widely used as an extinguishing agent in fixed fire protection systems for local application of specific hazards and total flooding of a protected space.<ref>National Fire Protection Association Code 12</ref> [[International Maritime Organization]] standards also recognize carbon dioxide systems for fire protection of ship holds and engine rooms. Carbon dioxide based fire protection systems have been linked to several deaths, because it can cause suffocation in sufficiently high concentrations. A review of {{CO2}} systems identified 51 incidents between 1975 and the date of the report (2000), causing 72 deaths and 145 injuries.<ref>Carbon Dioxide as a Fire Suppressant: Examining the Risks, US EPA. 2000.</ref>\n\n=== Supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> as solvent ===\n{{See also|Supercritical carbon dioxide}}\n\nLiquid carbon dioxide is a good [[solvent]] for many [[lipophilic]] [[organic compound]]s and is used to remove [[caffeine]] from [[coffee]].<ref name=Tsotsas/> Carbon dioxide has attracted attention in the [[pharmaceutical]] and other chemical processing industries as a less toxic alternative to more traditional solvents such as [[organochloride]]s.

Solid carbon dioxide is called \"dry ice\" and is used for small shipments where refrigeration equipment is not practical. Solid carbon dioxide is always below {{convert|-78.5|C|F}} at regular atmospheric pressure, regardless of the air temperature.\n\n{{anchor|R744}} Liquid carbon dioxide (industry nomenclature R744 or R-744) was used as a refrigerant prior to the discovery of [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] and may enjoy a renaissance due to the fact that [[R134a]] contributes to [[climate change]] more than {{CO2}} does. Its physical properties are highly favorable for cooling, refrigeration, and heating purposes, having a high volumetric cooling capacity. Due to the need to operate at pressures of up to 130 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (1880 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]]), {{CO2}} systems require highly resistant components that have already been developed for mass production in many sectors. In automobile air conditioning, in more than 90% of all driving conditions for latitudes higher than 50\u00b0, R744 operates more efficiently than systems using R134a.

Concentrations in poorly ventilated spaces can be found even higher than this (range of 3,000 or 4,000).\n\nMiners, who are particularly vulnerable to gas exposure due to an insufficient ventilation, referred to mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen as \"[[blackdamp]],\" \"choke damp\" or \"stythe.\" Before more effective technologies were developed, [[miners]] would frequently monitor for dangerous levels of blackdamp and other gases in mine shafts by bringing a caged [[Domestic Canary|canary]] with them as they worked. The canary is more sensitive to asphyxiant gases than humans, and as it became unconscious would stop singing and fall off its perch. The [[Davy lamp]] could also detect high levels of blackdamp (which sinks, and collects near the floor) by burning less brightly, while [[methane]], another suffocating gas and explosion risk, would make the lamp burn more brightly.\n\nIn February 2020, three people died from suffocation at a party in Moscow when dry ice (frozen CO2) was added to a swimming pool to cool it down.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51680049</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Human physiology ===\n\n==== Content ====\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+[[Reference range]]s or averages for [[partial pressure of carbon dioxide|partial pressures of carbon dioxide]] (abbreviated p{{CO2}})\n|-\n! !!

However, the {{CO2}} bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen. Instead, it combines with the N-terminal groups on the four globin chains. However, because of [[allosteric regulation|allosteric]] effects on the hemoglobin molecule, the binding of {{CO2}} decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen. This is known as the [[Haldane Effect]], and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. Conversely, a rise in the partial pressure of {{CO2}} or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin, which is known as the [[Bohr effect]].\n\n==== Regulation of respiration ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2014}}\nCarbon dioxide is one of the mediators of local [[autoregulation]] of blood supply. If its concentration is high, the [[capillaries]] expand to allow a greater blood flow to that tissue.\n\nBicarbonate ions are crucial for regulating blood pH. A person's breathing rate influences the level of {{CO2}} in their blood. Breathing that is too slow or shallow causes [[respiratory acidosis]], while breathing that is too rapid leads to [[hyperventilation]], which can cause [[alkalosis|respiratory alkalosis]].\n\nAlthough the body requires oxygen for metabolism, low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing. Rather, breathing is stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels. As a result, breathing low-pressure air or a gas mixture with no oxygen at all (such as pure nitrogen) can lead to loss of consciousness without ever experiencing [[air hunger]]. This is especially perilous for high-altitude fighter pilots. It is also why flight attendants instruct passengers, in case of loss of cabin pressure, to apply the [[oxygen mask]] to themselves first before helping others; otherwise, one risks losing consciousness.<ref name=\"solarnav\"/>\n\nThe respiratory centers try to maintain an arterial {{CO2}} pressure of 40&nbsp;mm Hg. With intentional hyperventilation, the {{CO2}} content of arterial blood may be lowered to 10\u201320&nbsp;mm Hg (the oxygen content of the blood is little affected), and the respiratory drive is diminished. This is why one can hold one's breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating. This carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming, which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Chemistry}}\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Arterial blood gas}}\n* {{annotated link|Bosch reaction}}\n* {{annotated link|Bottled gas}}\n* {{annotated link|Carbon dioxide sensor}}\n* {{annotated link|Carbon sequestration}}\n* {{annotated link|Cave of Dogs}}\n* {{annotated link|EcoCute}} \u2013 as refrigerants\n* {{annotated link|Emission standard}}s\n* {{annotated link|Indoor air quality#Carbon dioxide|Indoor air quality}}\n* {{annotated link|Kaya identity}}\n* {{annotated link|Lake Kivu}}\n* {{annotated link|List of least carbon efficient power stations}}\n* {{annotated link|List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions}}\n* {{annotated link|Meromictic lake}}\n* {{annotated link|pCO2}}\n* {{annotated link|Gilbert Plass}} (early work on {{CO2}} and climate change)\n* {{annotated link|Sabatier reaction}}\n* NASA's {{annotated link|Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2}}\n* {{annotated link|Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |first=O.A. |last=Sepp\u00e4nen |last2=Fisk |first2=W.J. |last3=Mendell |first3=M.J. |title=Association of Ventilation Rates and {{CO2}} Concentrations with Health and Other Responses in Commercial and Institutional Buildings |journal=Indoor Air |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=226\u2013252 |date=December 1999 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.1999.00003.x |pmid=10649857 |url=https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/43334.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227032839/https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/43334.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}\n* {{cite journal |last=Shendell |first=D.G. |last2=Prill |first2=R. |last3=Fisk |first3=W.J. |last4=Apte |first4=M.G. |last5=Blake |first5=D. |last6=Faulkner |first6=D. |title=Associations between classroom {{CO2}} concentrations and student attendance in Washington and Idaho |journal=Indoor Air |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=333\u2013341 |date=October 2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00251.x |pmid=15330793 |url=https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/lbnl-54413.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227030811/https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/lbnl-54413.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2016 |df=dmy-all |hdl=2376/5954 }}\n* {{cite journal |first=Jens |last=Soentgen |title= Hot air: The science and politics of {{CO2}} |journal=Global Environment |volume= 7 |issue=1 |pages= 134\u2013171 |date= February 2014 |doi= 10.3197/197337314X13927191904925 }}\n* {{cite book |title=Good plant design and operation for onshore carbon capture installations and onshore pipelines: a recommended practice guidance document |url=https://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/good-plant-design-and-operation-onshore-carbon-capture-installations-and-onshore-pipelines-recommended-practice-guidance-document |publisher=Energy Institute and Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute |date=1 Sep 2010 |website=Global CCS Institute |quote=This new title is an essential guide for engineers, managers, procurement specialists and designers working on global carbon capture and storage projects. |access-date=2 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107001428/https://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/good-plant-design-and-operation-onshore-carbon-capture-installations-and-onshore-pipelines-recommended-practice-guidance-document |archive-date=7 November 2018 |url-status=dead }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Library resources box |lcheading=Carbon dioxide}}\n* {{ICSC|0021}}<!-- in general: {{ICSC|AllDigits|TwoDigits}} -->\n* [http://sdsdata.org/68399 Carbon dioxide MSDS] by Amerigas in the SDSdata.org database.\n* [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0103.html CDC \u2013 NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards \u2013 Carbon Dioxide]\n* [http://www.uigi.com/carbondioxide.html {{CO2}} Carbon Dioxide Properties, Uses, Applications]\n* [http://www.dryiceinfo.com/science.htm Dry Ice information]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070225181531/http://www.cmdl.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/ Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide] (NOAA)\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=RicDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53 \"A War Gas That Saves Lives\"].

This is usually the opposite of the desired effect when welding, as it tends to embrittle the site, but may not be a problem for general mild steel welding, where ultimate ductility is not a major concern.\n\nIt is used in many consumer products that require pressurized gas because it is inexpensive and nonflammable, and because it undergoes a phase transition from gas to liquid at room temperature at an attainable pressure of approximately 60 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (870 psi, 59 atm), allowing far more carbon dioxide to fit in a given container than otherwise would. Life jackets often contain canisters of pressured carbon dioxide for quick inflation. [[Aluminium]] capsules of {{CO2}} are also sold as supplies of compressed gas for [[air gun]]s, [[paintball]] markers/guns, inflating bicycle tires, and for making [[carbonated water]]. Rapid vaporization of liquid carbon dioxide is used for blasting in coal mines.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} High concentrations of carbon dioxide can also be used to kill pests.

It does not itself react to extinguish the flame, but starves the flame of oxygen by displacing it. Some [[Fire extinguisher#Clean agents and carbon dioxide|fire extinguishers]], especially those designed for electrical fires, contain liquid carbon dioxide under pressure. Carbon dioxide extinguishers work well on small flammable liquid and electrical fires, but not on ordinary combustible fires, because although it excludes oxygen, it does not cool the burning substances significantly and when the carbon dioxide disperses they are free to catch fire upon exposure to atmospheric oxygen. Their desirability in electrical fire stems from the fact that, unlike water or other chemical based methods, Carbon dioxide will not cause short circuits, leading to even more damage to equipment. Because it is a gas, it is also easy to dispense large amounts of the gas automatically in IT infrastructure rooms, where the fire itself might be hard to reach with more immediate methods because it is behind rack doors and inside of cases. Carbon dioxide has also been widely used as an extinguishing agent in fixed fire protection systems for local application of specific hazards and total flooding of a protected space.<ref>National Fire Protection Association Code 12</ref> [[International Maritime Organization]] standards also recognize carbon dioxide systems for fire protection of ship holds and engine rooms. Carbon dioxide based fire protection systems have been linked to several deaths, because it can cause suffocation in sufficiently high concentrations. A review of {{CO2}} systems identified 51 incidents between 1975 and the date of the report (2000), causing 72 deaths and 145 injuries.<ref>Carbon Dioxide as a Fire Suppressant: Examining the Risks, US EPA. 2000.</ref>\n\n=== Supercritical CO<sub>2</sub> as solvent ===\n{{See also|Supercritical carbon dioxide}}\n\nLiquid carbon dioxide is a good [[solvent]] for many [[lipophilic]] [[organic compound]]s and is used to remove [[caffeine]] from [[coffee]].<ref name=Tsotsas/> Carbon dioxide has attracted attention in the [[pharmaceutical]] and other chemical processing industries as a less toxic alternative to more traditional solvents such as [[organochloride]]s.

Solid carbon dioxide is called \"dry ice\" and is used for small shipments where refrigeration equipment is not practical. Solid carbon dioxide is always below {{convert|-78.5|C|F}} at regular atmospheric pressure, regardless of the air temperature.\n\n{{anchor|R744}} Liquid carbon dioxide (industry nomenclature R744 or R-744) was used as a refrigerant prior to the discovery of [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]] and may enjoy a renaissance due to the fact that [[R134a]] contributes to [[climate change]] more than {{CO2}} does. Its physical properties are highly favorable for cooling, refrigeration, and heating purposes, having a high volumetric cooling capacity. Due to the need to operate at pressures of up to 130 [[Bar (unit)|bar]] (1880 [[Pounds per square inch|psi]]), {{CO2}} systems require highly resistant components that have already been developed for mass production in many sectors. In automobile air conditioning, in more than 90% of all driving conditions for latitudes higher than 50\u00b0, R744 operates more efficiently than systems using R134a.

Concentrations in poorly ventilated spaces can be found even higher than this (range of 3,000 or 4,000).\n\nMiners, who are particularly vulnerable to gas exposure due to an insufficient ventilation, referred to mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen as \"[[blackdamp]],\" \"choke damp\" or \"stythe.\" Before more effective technologies were developed, [[miners]] would frequently monitor for dangerous levels of blackdamp and other gases in mine shafts by bringing a caged [[Domestic Canary|canary]] with them as they worked. The canary is more sensitive to asphyxiant gases than humans, and as it became unconscious would stop singing and fall off its perch. The [[Davy lamp]] could also detect high levels of blackdamp (which sinks, and collects near the floor) by burning less brightly, while [[methane]], another suffocating gas and explosion risk, would make the lamp burn more brightly.\n\nIn February 2020, three people died from suffocation at a party in Moscow when dry ice (frozen CO2) was added to a swimming pool to cool it down.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-51680049</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Human physiology ===\n\n==== Content ====\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+[[Reference range]]s or averages for [[partial pressure of carbon dioxide|partial pressures of carbon dioxide]] (abbreviated p{{CO2}})\n|-\n! !!

However, the {{CO2}} bound to hemoglobin does not bind to the same site as oxygen. Instead, it combines with the N-terminal groups on the four globin chains. However, because of [[allosteric regulation|allosteric]] effects on the hemoglobin molecule, the binding of {{CO2}} decreases the amount of oxygen that is bound for a given partial pressure of oxygen. This is known as the [[Haldane Effect]], and is important in the transport of carbon dioxide from the tissues to the lungs. Conversely, a rise in the partial pressure of {{CO2}} or a lower pH will cause offloading of oxygen from hemoglobin, which is known as the [[Bohr effect]].\n\n==== Regulation of respiration ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=June 2014}}\nCarbon dioxide is one of the mediators of local [[autoregulation]] of blood supply. If its concentration is high, the [[capillaries]] expand to allow a greater blood flow to that tissue.\n\nBicarbonate ions are crucial for regulating blood pH. A person's breathing rate influences the level of {{CO2}} in their blood. Breathing that is too slow or shallow causes [[respiratory acidosis]], while breathing that is too rapid leads to [[hyperventilation]], which can cause [[alkalosis|respiratory alkalosis]].\n\nAlthough the body requires oxygen for metabolism, low oxygen levels normally do not stimulate breathing. Rather, breathing is stimulated by higher carbon dioxide levels. As a result, breathing low-pressure air or a gas mixture with no oxygen at all (such as pure nitrogen) can lead to loss of consciousness without ever experiencing [[air hunger]]. This is especially perilous for high-altitude fighter pilots. It is also why flight attendants instruct passengers, in case of loss of cabin pressure, to apply the [[oxygen mask]] to themselves first before helping others; otherwise, one risks losing consciousness.<ref name=\"solarnav\"/>\n\nThe respiratory centers try to maintain an arterial {{CO2}} pressure of 40&nbsp;mm Hg. With intentional hyperventilation, the {{CO2}} content of arterial blood may be lowered to 10\u201320&nbsp;mm Hg (the oxygen content of the blood is little affected), and the respiratory drive is diminished. This is why one can hold one's breath longer after hyperventilating than without hyperventilating. This carries the risk that unconsciousness may result before the need to breathe becomes overwhelming, which is why hyperventilation is particularly dangerous before free diving.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Chemistry}}\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Arterial blood gas}}\n* {{annotated link|Bosch reaction}}\n* {{annotated link|Bottled gas}}\n* {{annotated link|Carbon dioxide sensor}}\n* {{annotated link|Carbon sequestration}}\n* {{annotated link|Cave of Dogs}}\n* {{annotated link|EcoCute}} \u2013 as refrigerants\n* {{annotated link|Emission standard}}s\n* {{annotated link|Indoor air quality#Carbon dioxide|Indoor air quality}}\n* {{annotated link|Kaya identity}}\n* {{annotated link|Lake Kivu}}\n* {{annotated link|List of least carbon efficient power stations}}\n* {{annotated link|List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions}}\n* {{annotated link|Meromictic lake}}\n* {{annotated link|pCO2}}\n* {{annotated link|Gilbert Plass}} (early work on {{CO2}} and climate change)\n* {{annotated link|Sabatier reaction}}\n* NASA's {{annotated link|Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2}}\n* {{annotated link|Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite journal |first=O.A. |last=Sepp\u00e4nen |last2=Fisk |first2=W.J. |last3=Mendell |first3=M.J. |title=Association of Ventilation Rates and {{CO2}} Concentrations with Health and Other Responses in Commercial and Institutional Buildings |journal=Indoor Air |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=226\u2013252 |date=December 1999 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.1999.00003.x |pmid=10649857 |url=https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/43334.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227032839/https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/43334.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}\n* {{cite journal |last=Shendell |first=D.G. |last2=Prill |first2=R. |last3=Fisk |first3=W.J. |last4=Apte |first4=M.G. |last5=Blake |first5=D. |last6=Faulkner |first6=D. |title=Associations between classroom {{CO2}} concentrations and student attendance in Washington and Idaho |journal=Indoor Air |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=333\u2013341 |date=October 2004 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0668.2004.00251.x |pmid=15330793 |url=https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/lbnl-54413.pdf |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227030811/https://indoor.lbl.gov/sites/all/files/lbnl-54413.pdf |archivedate=27 December 2016 |df=dmy-all |hdl=2376/5954 }}\n* {{cite journal |first=Jens |last=Soentgen |title= Hot air: The science and politics of {{CO2}} |journal=Global Environment |volume= 7 |issue=1 |pages= 134\u2013171 |date= February 2014 |doi= 10.3197/197337314X13927191904925 }}\n* {{cite book |title=Good plant design and operation for onshore carbon capture installations and onshore pipelines: a recommended practice guidance document |url=https://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/good-plant-design-and-operation-onshore-carbon-capture-installations-and-onshore-pipelines-recommended-practice-guidance-document |publisher=Energy Institute and Global Carbon Capture and Storage Institute |date=1 Sep 2010 |website=Global CCS Institute |quote=This new title is an essential guide for engineers, managers, procurement specialists and designers working on global carbon capture and storage projects. |access-date=2 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107001428/https://hub.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/good-plant-design-and-operation-onshore-carbon-capture-installations-and-onshore-pipelines-recommended-practice-guidance-document |archive-date=7 November 2018 |url-status=dead }}\n{{refend}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{Library resources box |lcheading=Carbon dioxide}}\n* {{ICSC|0021}}<!-- in general: {{ICSC|AllDigits|TwoDigits}} -->\n* [http://sdsdata.org/68399 Carbon dioxide MSDS] by Amerigas in the SDSdata.org database.\n* [https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0103.html CDC \u2013 NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards \u2013 Carbon Dioxide]\n* [http://www.uigi.com/carbondioxide.html {{CO2}} Carbon Dioxide Properties, Uses, Applications]\n* [http://www.dryiceinfo.com/science.htm Dry Ice information]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070225181531/http://www.cmdl.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/ Trends in Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide] (NOAA)\n* [https://books.google.com/books?id=RicDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53 \"A War Gas That Saves Lives\"].
