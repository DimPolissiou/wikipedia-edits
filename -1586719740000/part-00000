Engdahl, Sylvia (New York: Greenhaven Press, 2010), 35.</ref> Despite the support of fellow senators, representatives, and First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], Congress failed to pass any national change. However, public interest in lowering the vote became a topic of interest at the local level. In 1943 and 1955 respectively, the Georgia and Kentucky legislatures passed measures to lower the voting age to 18.<ref>Neale, Thomas H., \"Lowering the Voting Age was not a New Idea\", in ''Amendment XXVI Lowering the Voting Age'', ed. Engdahl, Sylvia (New York: Greenhaven Press, 2010), 36\u201337.</ref>\n\nPresident [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], in his 1954 [[State of the Union]] address, became the first president to publicly support prohibiting age-based denials of [[suffrage]] for those 18 and older.<ref>Dwight D. Eisenhower, \"Public Papers of the Presidents\", January 7, 1954, p. 22.</ref> During the 1960s, both Congress and the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] came under increasing pressure to lower the minimum voting age from 21 to 18. This was in large part due to the [[Vietnam War]], in which many young men who were ineligible to vote were [[Conscription in the United States|conscripted]] to fight in the war, thus lacking any means to influence the people sending them off to risk their lives. \"Old enough to fight, old enough to vote\" was a common slogan used by proponents of lowering the voting age. The slogan traced its roots to [[World War II]], when President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] lowered the military draft age to eighteen.\n\nIn 1963, the President's Commission on Registration and Voting Participation, in its report to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]], further encouraged considering lowering the voting age. Historian Thomas H. Neale argues that the move to lower the voting age followed a historical pattern similar to other extensions of the [[Suffrage|franchise]]; with the escalation of the war in Vietnam, constituents were mobilized and eventually a constitutional amendment passed.<ref>Neale, Thomas H., \"Lowering the Voting Age was not a New Idea\", in ''Amendment XXVI Lowering the Voting Age'', ed. Engdahl, Sylvia (New York: Greenhaven Press, 2010), 38.</ref>\n\nIn 1970, Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] proposed amending the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] to lower the voting age nationally.<ref>Kennedy, Edward M. \"The Time Has Come to Let Young People Vote\", in Amendment XXVI Lowering the Voting Age, ed. Engdahl, Sylvia (New York: Greenhaven Press, 2010), 56-64.</ref> On June 22, 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]] signed an extension of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that required the voting age to be 18 in all federal, state, and local elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=2553|title=196 - Statement on Signing the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970|author=University of California, Santa Barbara|author-link=University of California, Santa Barbara|publisher=presidency.ucsb.edu}}</ref> In his statement on signing the extension, Nixon said:\n\n{{quote|Despite my misgivings about the constitutionality of this one provision, I have signed the bill.

Mitchell|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> In the 1966 decision of ''[[Katzenbach v. Morgan]]'', the Supreme Court had ruled that \"if Congress acts to enforce the 14th Amendment by passing a law declaring that a type of state law discriminates against a certain class of persons, the Supreme Court will let the law stand if the justices can 'perceive a basis' for Congress's actions\".<ref>Graham, Fred P., in ''Amendment XXVI Lowering the Voting Age'', ed. Engdahl, Sylvia (New York: Greenhaven Press, 2010), 67.</ref>\n\nPresident Nixon disagreed with Kennedy. In a letter to the Speaker of the House and the House minority and majority leaders, he asserted that the issue is not whether the voting age should be lowered, but how; in his own interpretation of the ''Katzenbach'' case, Nixon argued that to include age as something discriminatory would be too big a stretch and voiced concerns that the damage of a Supreme Court decision to overturn the Voting Rights Act could be disastrous.<ref>Nixon, Richard, \"Changing the Voting age will Require a Constitutional Amendment\", in ''Amendment XXVI Lowering the Voting Age'', ed. Engdahl, Sylvia (New York: Greenhaven Press, 2010), 70-77.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Oregon v. Mitchell]]'' (1970), the Supreme Court considered whether the voting-age provisions Congress added to the Voting Rights Act in 1970 were constitutional. The Court struck down the provisions that established 18 as the voting age in state and local elections. However, the Court upheld the provision establishing the voting age as 18 in federal elections. The Court was deeply divided in this case, and a majority of justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tokaji|first=Daniel P.|title=Intent and Its Alternatives: Defending the New Voting Rights Act|journal=Alabama Law Review|year=2006|volume=58|page=353|url=http://www.law.ua.edu/pubs/lrarticles/Volume%2058/Issue%202/tokaji.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}</ref><ref>''[[Oregon v.

Professor William G. Carleton wondered why the vote was proposed for youth at a time when the period of adolescence had grown so substantially rather than in the past when people had more responsibilities at earlier ages.<ref>Carleton, William G., \"Teen Voting Would Accelerate Undesirable Changes in the Democratic Process\", in ''Amendment XXVI Lowering the Voting Age'', ed. Engdahl, Sylvia (New York: Greenhaven Press, 2010), 47.</ref> Carleton further criticized the move to lower the vote citing American preoccupations with youth in general, exaggerated reliance on higher education, and equating technological savvy with responsibility and intelligence.<ref>Carleton, William G., \"Teen Voting Would Accelerate Undesirable Changes in the Democratic Process\", in ''Amendment XXVI Lowering the Voting Age'', ed. Engdahl, Sylvia (New York: Greenhaven Press, 2010), 48-49.</ref> He denounced the military service argument as well, calling it a \"cliche\".<ref>Carleton, William G., \"Teen Voting Would Accelerate Undesirable Changes in the Democratic Process\", in ''Amendment XXVI Lowering the Voting Age'', ed.

The draft conscripted young men between the ages of 18 and 21 into the armed forces, primarily the [[U.S. Army]], to serve in or support military combat operations in Vietnam.<ref>https://www.history.com/topics/the-26th-amendment</ref> A common slogan of proponents of lowering the voting age was \"old enough to fight, old enough to vote.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://constitutioncenter.org/interactive-constitution/amendments/amendment-xxvi|title=The 26th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution|website=National Constitution Center \u2013 The 26th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref>\n\nCongress lowered the national voting age to 18 in a 1970 bill that extended the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|Voting Rights Act]], but the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] subsequently held in the case of ''[[Oregon v.

Engdahl, Sylvia (New York: Greenhaven Press, 2010), 35.</ref> Despite the support of fellow senators, representatives, and First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], Congress failed to pass any national change. However, public interest in lowering the vote became a topic of interest at the local level. In 1943 and 1955 respectively, the Georgia and Kentucky legislatures passed measures to lower the voting age to 18.<ref>Neale, Thomas H., \"Lowering the Voting Age was not a New Idea\", in ''Amendment XXVI Lowering the Voting Age'', ed. Engdahl, Sylvia (New York: Greenhaven Press, 2010), 36\u201337.</ref>\n\nPresident [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], in his 1954 [[State of the Union]] address, became the first president to publicly support prohibiting age-based denials of [[suffrage]] for those 18 and older.<ref>Dwight D. Eisenhower, \"Public Papers of the Presidents\", January 7, 1954, p. 22.</ref> During the 1960s, both Congress and the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislatures]] came under increasing pressure to lower the minimum voting age from 21 to 18. This was in large part due to the [[Vietnam War]], in which many young men who were ineligible to vote were [[Conscription in the United States|conscripted]] to fight in the war, thus lacking any means to influence the people sending them off to risk their lives. \"Old enough to fight, old enough to vote\" was a common slogan used by proponents of lowering the voting age. The slogan traced its roots to [[World War II]], when President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] lowered the military draft age to eighteen.\n\nIn 1963, the President's Commission on Registration and Voting Participation, in its report to President [[Lyndon B. Johnson|Johnson]], further encouraged considering lowering the voting age. Historian Thomas H. Neale argues that the move to lower the voting age followed a historical pattern similar to other extensions of the [[Suffrage|franchise]]; with the escalation of the war in Vietnam, constituents were mobilized and eventually a constitutional amendment passed.<ref>Neale, Thomas H., \"Lowering the Voting Age was not a New Idea\", in ''Amendment XXVI Lowering the Voting Age'', ed. Engdahl, Sylvia (New York: Greenhaven Press, 2010), 38.</ref>\n\nIn 1970, Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] proposed amending the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] to lower the voting age nationally.<ref>Kennedy, Edward M. \"The Time Has Come to Let Young People Vote\", in Amendment XXVI Lowering the Voting Age, ed. Engdahl, Sylvia (New York: Greenhaven Press, 2010), 56-64.</ref> On June 22, 1970, President [[Richard Nixon]] signed an extension of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that required the voting age to be 18 in all federal, state, and local elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=2553|title=196 - Statement on Signing the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970|author=University of California, Santa Barbara|author-link=University of California, Santa Barbara|publisher=presidency.ucsb.edu}}</ref> In his statement on signing the extension, Nixon said:\n\n{{quote|Despite my misgivings about the constitutionality of this one provision, I have signed the bill.

Mitchell|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|language=en|access-date=2019-06-03}}</ref> In the 1966 decision of ''[[Katzenbach v. Morgan]]'', the Supreme Court had ruled that \"if Congress acts to enforce the 14th Amendment by passing a law declaring that a type of state law discriminates against a certain class of persons, the Supreme Court will let the law stand if the justices can 'perceive a basis' for Congress's actions\".<ref>Graham, Fred P., in ''Amendment XXVI Lowering the Voting Age'', ed. Engdahl, Sylvia (New York: Greenhaven Press, 2010), 67.</ref>\n\nPresident Nixon disagreed with Kennedy. In a letter to the Speaker of the House and the House minority and majority leaders, he asserted that the issue is not whether the voting age should be lowered, but how; in his own interpretation of the ''Katzenbach'' case, Nixon argued that to include age as something discriminatory would be too big a stretch and voiced concerns that the damage of a Supreme Court decision to overturn the Voting Rights Act could be disastrous.<ref>Nixon, Richard, \"Changing the Voting age will Require a Constitutional Amendment\", in ''Amendment XXVI Lowering the Voting Age'', ed. Engdahl, Sylvia (New York: Greenhaven Press, 2010), 70-77.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Oregon v. Mitchell]]'' (1970), the Supreme Court considered whether the voting-age provisions Congress added to the Voting Rights Act in 1970 were constitutional. The Court struck down the provisions that established 18 as the voting age in state and local elections. However, the Court upheld the provision establishing the voting age as 18 in federal elections. The Court was deeply divided in this case, and a majority of justices did not agree on a rationale for the holding.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Tokaji|first=Daniel P.|title=Intent and Its Alternatives: Defending the New Voting Rights Act|journal=Alabama Law Review|year=2006|volume=58|page=353|url=http://www.law.ua.edu/pubs/lrarticles/Volume%2058/Issue%202/tokaji.pdf|accessdate=July 29, 2015}}</ref><ref>''[[Oregon v.

The German band [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]] further developed the burgeoning scene with explicitly neo-Nazi lyrics and artistic themes. The movement became especially popular in Central and Eastern Europe, where it was developed by bands such as the Polish groups [[Graveland]] and [[Infernum]] and the Ukrainian band [[Hate Forest]]. The United States bands [[Grand Belial's Key]] and [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]] also became involved in the by-now international NSBM movement. As the movement grew internationally, it started to overlap with existing [[White power music|white power musical forms]] such as [[Rock Against Communism]], [[Nazi punk|hatecore]], and the far-fight faction of [[Oi!]]. The Canadian neo-Nazi record label [[Resistance Records]] started releasing NSBM recordings, and even purchased Vikernes' label Cymophane Records. The associated United States political organization [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]] white supremacist [[William Luther Pierce]] also became interested in the movement, and assisted Absurd frontman Hendrik M\u00f6bus when he fled to the United States to avoid arrest in Germany. In the early 2000s, bands such the Ukrainian [[Drudkh]] and [[Kroda]] and the Russian \u041c8\u041b8\u0422\u0425 continued the scene's popularity in Eastern Europe. In 2012, the NSBM [[Asgardsrei festival]] was established in [[Moscow]], Russia, and then in 2014 relocated to [[Kiev]], Ukraine, where it is closely linked to the activities of the [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian nationalist]] network [[Azov Battalion]] and functions as an international hub for neo-Nazism and other far-right politics.\n\n==Black metal==\n{{Main|Black metal}}\nBlack metal is a style of [[extreme metal]] music that originated in the 1980s from the work of [[thrash metal]] bands such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]] (from [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[England]]) \u2014 whose 1982 album ''[[Black Metal (Venom album)|Black Metal]]'' coined the term for the genre, [[Mercyful Fate]] (from [[Copenhagen]], Denmark), [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] (from [[V\u00e4llingby]], Sweden), [[Slayer]] (from [[Huntington Park, California]], United States), [[Hellhammer]] (from [[N\u00fcrensdorf]], Switzerland), [[Celtic Frost]] (from [[Z\u00fcrich]], Switzerland), and [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] (from [[Gelsenkirchen]], Germany).<ref name=\"Stylus Magazine\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref>Moynihan & Soderlind, 2009, p. 10</ref><ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|last=Venkatesh|first=Vivek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwSXBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA368#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Educational, Psychological, and Behavioral Considerations in Niche Online Communities|last2=Podoshen|first2=Jeffrey S.|last3=Perri|first3=David|last4=Urbaniak|first4=Kathryn|date=2014-02-28|publisher=[[IGI Global]]|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4666-5207-1|editor-last=Venkatesh|editor-first=Vivek|location=Hershey|pages=368|language=en|chapter=21: From Pride and Prejudice to Shame: Multiple Facets of the Black Metal Scene within and without Online Environments|editor-last2=Wallin|editor-first2=Jason|editor-last3=Castro|editor-first3=Juan Carlos|editor-last4=Lewis|editor-first4=Jason Edward}}</ref> A lyrical focus that is anti-Christian, Satanist, [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]], or a combination thereof, is often considered a prerequisite for the genre, and originally the term \"black metal\" was synonymous with \"Satanic metal\".<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles.aspx?id=6-668|title=CoC : Rant : Black Metal: A Brief Guide|last=Kalis|first=Quentin|date=August 31, 2004|website=[[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=\":10\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Stan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=avjCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA193#v=onepage&q&f=false1|title=The Bloomsbury Handbook of Popular Music and Social Class|last2=Nielsen|first2=Nina|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|year=2020|isbn=9781501345388|editor-last=Peddie|editor-first=Ian|location=London|pages=193|chapter=Gaahl - Monster or Postmodern Prometheus?

NSBM artists typically combine neo-Nazi imagery and ideology with [[Modern Paganism#Ethnicity and region|ethnic European paganism]], [[Satanism]], or [[Occultism in Nazism|Nazi occultism]], or a combination thereof, and vehemently oppose [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and [[Judaism]]. NSBM is not seen as a distinct genre, but as a [[neo-v\u00f6lkisch movements|neo-v\u00f6lkisch movement]] within black metal. According to [[Mattias Gardell]], NSBM musicians see this ideology as \"a logical extension of the political and spiritual dissidence inherent in black metal\".<ref name=\"Gardell\">Mattias Gardell, [[Gods of the Blood|''Gods of the Blood'' (2003)]], p.307</ref>\n\nNSBM artists are not always explicit with their political beliefs in the music, instead expressing their beliefs offstage.<ref name=reichsrock>{{cite book|last1=Dyck|first1=Kirsten|title=Reichsrock: The International Web of White-Power and Neo-Nazi Hate Music|date=2016|publisher=[[Rutgers University Press]]|location=New Brunswick|isbn=9780813574738|pages=58\u201361|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sREVDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_navlinks_s|accessdate=January 9, 2017}}</ref> Artists who hold [[Far-right politics|far-right]] or [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] beliefs but do not express these in their music are not often deemed NSBM by the greater black metal scene, but may be labelled as such by outside analysts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bifff-berlin.de/aktuell72.html |title=Rechtes Neuheiden-Festival mit Nazi-Runen im \"SO 36\" |publisher=BIFFF ...|language=de}}</ref> Some black metal bands have also made references to [[Nazi Germany]] purely for [[shock value]], much like some [[punk rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands. While some black-metallers boycott NSBM artists, many are indifferent or appreciate the music without supporting the musicians.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=99}}\n\nThe emergence of NSBM coincided with the rise of the [[early Norwegian black metal scene]] in the early 1990s, particularly through the band [[Burzum]], whose sole member, [[Varg Vikernes]], developed his [[Satanism|Satanist]] beliefs and antagonism to Christianity into an increasingly white nationalist and neo-Nazi form of [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]]. The German band [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]] further developed the burgeoning scene with explicitly neo-Nazi lyrics and artistic themes. The movement became especially popular in Central and Eastern Europe, where it was developed by bands such as the Polish groups [[Graveland]] and [[Infernum]] and the Ukrainian band [[Hate Forest]]. The United States bands [[Grand Belial's Key]] and [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]] also became involved in the by-now international NSBM movement. As the movement grew internationally, it started to overlap with existing [[White power music|white power musical forms]] such as [[Rock Against Communism]], [[Nazi punk|hatecore]], and the far-fight faction of [[Oi!]]. The Canadian neo-Nazi record label [[Resistance Records]] started releasing NSBM recordings, and even purchased Vikernes' label Cymophane Records. The associated United States political organization [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]] white supremacist [[William Luther Pierce]] also became interested in the movement, and assisted Absurd frontman Hendrik M\u00f6bus when he fled to the United States to avoid arrest in Germany. In the early 2000s, bands such the Ukrainian [[Drudkh]] and [[Kroda]] and the Russian \u041c8\u041b8\u0422\u0425 continued the scene's popularity in Eastern Europe. In 2012, the NSBM [[Asgardsrei festival]] was established in [[Moscow]], Russia, and then in 2014 relocated to [[Kiev]], Ukraine, where it is closely linked to the activities of the [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian nationalist]] network [[Azov Battalion]] and functions as an international hub for neo-Nazism and other far-right politics.\n\n==Black metal==\n{{Main|Black metal}}\nBlack metal is a style of [[extreme metal]] music that originated in the 1980s from the work of [[thrash metal]] bands such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]] (from [[Newcastle upon Tyne|Newcastle]], [[England]]) \u2014 whose 1982 album ''[[Black Metal (Venom album)|Black Metal]]'' coined the term for the genre, [[Mercyful Fate]] (from [[Copenhagen]], Denmark), [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]] (from [[V\u00e4llingby]], Sweden), [[Slayer]] (from [[Huntington Park, California]], United States), [[Hellhammer]] (from [[N\u00fcrensdorf]], Switzerland), [[Celtic Frost]] (from [[Z\u00fcrich]], Switzerland), and [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] (from [[Gelsenkirchen]], Germany).<ref name=\"Stylus Magazine\" /><ref name=\":8\" /><ref>Moynihan & Soderlind, 2009, p. 10</ref><ref name=\":10\">{{Cite book|last=Venkatesh|first=Vivek|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LwSXBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA368#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Educational, Psychological, and Behavioral Considerations in Niche Online Communities|last2=Podoshen|first2=Jeffrey S.|last3=Perri|first3=David|last4=Urbaniak|first4=Kathryn|date=2014-02-28|publisher=[[IGI Global]]|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4666-5207-1|editor-last=Venkatesh|editor-first=Vivek|location=Hershey|pages=368|language=en|chapter=21: From Pride and Prejudice to Shame: Multiple Facets of the Black Metal Scene within and without Online Environments|editor-last2=Wallin|editor-first2=Jason|editor-last3=Castro|editor-first3=Juan Carlos|editor-last4=Lewis|editor-first4=Jason Edward}}</ref> A lyrical focus that is anti-Christian, Satanist, [[Modern Paganism|neopagan]], or a combination thereof, is often considered a prerequisite for the genre, and originally the term \"black metal\" was synonymous with \"Satanic metal\".<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles.aspx?id=6-668|title=CoC : Rant : Black Metal: A Brief Guide|last=Kalis|first=Quentin|date=August 31, 2004|website=[[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]]|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-10}}</ref><ref name=\":10\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=Hawkins|first=Stan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=avjCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA193#v=onepage&q&f=false1|title=The Bloomsbury Handbook of Popular Music and Social Class|last2=Nielsen|first2=Nina|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|year=2020|isbn=9781501345388|editor-last=Peddie|editor-first=Ian|location=London|pages=193|chapter=Gaahl - Monster or Postmodern Prometheus?

The Wellington Racing Club responded to the downgrade by reducing the distance to 2400 metres in order to attract a higher quality field.  The race reverted back to 3200m from 2016 to help encourage New Zealand stayers<ref>https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/racing/72273641/staying-power-wellington-cup-likely-to-return-to-3200-metre-distance</ref>.

A follow-up to 1986's ''[[Out Run]]'', it was released as a dedicated game, as well as an upgrade kit for the original ''Out Run'' [[printed circuit board|board]].\n\nLike its predecessor, ''Turbo OutRun'' has players driving a Ferrari, this time a [[Ferrari F40]]. Players now traverse a set route across the entire continental [[United States]] from [[New York City]] to [[Los Angeles]] instead of the branching paths of the first game. In addition to a [[time limit (video gaming)|time limit]], ''Turbo OutRun'' also adds a computer-controlled opponent driving a [[Porsche 959]]. The \"Turbo\" in the title also plays a factor as players can now press a button to receive a brief turbo boost of speed. Various [[power-up]]s which increase the vehicle's attributes can now be chosen at various stages of the game.\n\n[[Porting|Ports]] of ''Turbo OutRun'' were released for home computers as well as Sega's own [[Mega Drive]].\n\n==Overview==\nIn ''Turbo Outrun'' the player controls a male driver sitting alongside his girlfriend in a [[Ferrari F40]], racing against the clock and a computer-controlled opponent in a silver [[Porsche 959]] in a race across the United States. The goal is to reach [[Los Angeles]] from the starting point of [[New York City]]. Unlike the original ''Out Run'', there are no branch roads to choose from. Instead, there is only one path that can be taken to reach the goal.\n\nA notable feature of the game is that the player can increase speed by using [[turbo]] boost by pressing a button on the side of the console-mounted shifter; the engine temperature will increase in kind on the on-screen [[Dashboard#Dashboard items|gauge]]. When the gauge reaches \"OVERHEAT!\" turbo boost cannot be used until the temperature decreases.\n\nAnother notable difference is that police cars occasionally appear that try to stop the player. They have to either be outrun by using the turbo boost or destroyed by the player by ramming them off-road and into an object on the side of the road.\n\nUnlike the original [[Out Run]], Turbo Out Run offers the player a choice between [[automatic transmission]] or two-speed [[manual transmission]].<ref>[http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/reviews/view.php%3Fid%3D756] Retrieved 16 January 2016</ref>\n\nAt every sub-goal (reached after passing through about four cities), a power-up can be chosen, the three being: Hi-Power Engine, Special Turbo, and Super Grip Tires. If the CPU opponent reaches the sub-goal before the player, at the next race, the driver's girlfriend will move to the opponent's car. He can still win the girl back if he beats the CPU opponent to the next sub-goal. If the player beats the opponent with the girl in hand, a 1,000,000 point bonus is given. Also, the girl kisses the driver in front of his CPU opponent.  If the player reaches the final checkpoint, in the process, the player will pass the CPU opponent and the ending scene is played.\n\nIt was available in a stand-up cabinet, and a sit-down cabinet with decals giving it an appearance of a [[Ferrari F40]], the car featured in the game. There were also conversion kits available to convert original ''Out Run'' machines to ''Turbo OutRun''.\n\nComputer ports of the game were received with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Commodore 64 version was widely seen as a good game but 16-bit conversions got very negative reviews.\n\n==Stage Order==\nThe courses are raced straightforward in 4 sections consisting of 4 stages each with no fork roads.\n\n* Stage 1: [[New York City|New York]] (Start of game)\n* Stage 2: [[Washington D.C.]]\n* Stage 3: [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]\n* Stage 4: [[Indianapolis]] (End of section 1)\n* Stage 5: [[Chicago]] (Runs along [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]])\n* Stage 6: [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]\n* Stage 7: [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]\n* Stage 8: [[Atlanta]] (End of section 2)\n* Stage 9: [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]\n* Stage 10: [[New Orleans]]\n* Stage 11: [[San Antonio]]\n* Stage 12: [[Dallas]] (End of section 3)\n* Stage 13: [[Oklahoma City]]\n* Stage 14: [[Denver]]\n* Stage 15: [[Grand Canyon]] (Runs along Route 66)\n* Stage 16: [[Los Angeles]] (End of game)\n\nAside from the reduction in length (the 9000 km route would take approx 80 hours, the game can be finished in 15 minutes), some of the stages are not accurately portrayed to their real life counterparts. For example: Atlanta is nothing more than a field covered in [[snow]] (more resembling [[Stone Mountain Park]]) and Dallas looks like the [[Gobi Desert]].\n\n==Music==\nUnlike the 1986 original game ''[[Out Run]]'', the music cannot be selected, rather the games background music play in each section of the game in this order:\n\nJapan & US Layout:\n* Rush a Difficulty (Stages 1\u20134)\n* Keep Your Heart (Stages 5\u20138)\n* Shake the Street (Stages 9\u201312)\n* Who Are You? (Stages 13\u201316)\n\nEuropean Layout:\n* Shake the Street (Stages 1\u20134)\n* Rush a Difficulty (Stages 5\u20138)\n* Who Are You? (Stages 9\u201312)\n* Keep Your Heart (Stages 13\u201316)\n\nIn the 1993 [[arcade game]] [[Daytona USA (arcade game)|''Daytona USA'']], a song from ''Turbo Outrun'' can be played on the name entry screen by entering the initials TOR. The result is the opening couple of bars of \"Rush A Difficulty\".\n\n=== Commodore 64 soundtrack ===\nThe Commodore 64 home version soundtrack, composed and arranged by [[Jeroen Tel]], was well received. The soundtrack won the \"Best music on 8-bit computer 1989\" award on [[European Computer Trade Show]]. The title track is a remix of \"Magical Sound Shower\" from ''Out Run'', featuring sound samples from Jeroen Tel himself; due to sampling quality, he was actually saying \"One, two, ''tree''... hit it, Out Run\" while recording, instead of \"three\", to avoid it sounding like \"free\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Brock-Nannestad|first=Laust|title=SID Tune Information List v44|date=2006-01-18|url=http://www.stil.c64.org/|accessdate=2006-07-31|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012074655/http://www.stil.c64.org/|archivedate=2008-10-12}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| CRASH = 79% (Spectrum)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/Crash/Issue73/Pages/Crash7300040.jpg |title=Archive \u2013 Magazine viewer |publisher=World of Spectrum |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref>\n| CVG = 93% (C64)<ref>https://archive.org/stream/cvg-magazine-097/CVG_097_Dec_1989#page/n55/mode/2up</ref>\n| SUser = 78% (Spectrum)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/SinclairUser/Issue094/Pages/SinclairUser09400009.jpg |title=Archive \u2013 Magazine viewer |publisher=World of Spectrum |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref>\n| YSinclair = 70% (Spectrum)<ref name=\"ysrnry1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/turbooutrun.htm |title=Turbo OutRun |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |accessdate=2012-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ADseIp9J?url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/turbooutrun.htm |archivedate=2012-08-27 }}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[Commodore User]]''\n| rev1Score = 8/10 (Arcade)<ref name=cu-arcade>https://archive.org/stream/commodore-user-magazine-68/Commodore_User_Issue_68_1989_May#page/n95/mode/2up</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Zzap!64]]''\n| rev2Score = 97% (C64)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/zzap100/100thspec5.html |title=Zzap!64 100th Issue Pull-Out Special Page 5 |publisher=Zzap64.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]''\n| rev3Score = 53% (Mega&nbsp;Drive)<ref>Mega rating, issue 9, page 23, [[Future Publishing]], June 1993</ref>\n| rev4 = ''Mean Machines''\n| rev4Score = 42% (Mega&nbsp;Drive)<ref>''Mean Machines'', Issue 18, March 1992, pp. 78-9</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[MegaTech]]''\n| rev5Score = 41% (Mega&nbsp;Drive)<ref>MegaTech rating, [[EMAP]], issue 5, page 79, May 1992</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[ACE (games magazine)|ACE]]''\n| rev6Score = 601/1000 (Amiga/ST)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/ACE/Issue28/Pages/ACE2800065.jpg |title=Archive \u2013 Magazine viewer |publisher=World of Spectrum |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref>\n\n| award1Pub = ''Zzap!64''\n| award1 = Gold Medal\n}}\n''Turbo Outrun'' received positive to mixed reviews, depending on the version.

The only aspect of the game to receive genuine praise was the high-scores screen design.

Various [[power-up]]s which increase the vehicle's attributes can now be chosen at various stages of the game.\n\n[[Porting|Ports]] of ''Turbo OutRun'' were released for home computers as well as Sega's own [[Mega Drive]].\n\n==Overview==\nIn ''Turbo Outrun'' the player controls a male driver sitting alongside his girlfriend in a [[Ferrari F40]], racing against the clock and a computer-controlled opponent in a blue [[Porsche 959]] in a race across the United States. The goal is to reach [[Los Angeles]] from the starting point of [[New York City]]. Unlike the original ''Out Run'', there are no branch roads to choose from. Instead, there is only one path that can be taken to reach the goal.\n\nA notable feature of the game is that the player can increase speed by using [[turbo]] boost by pressing a button on the side of the console-mounted shifter; the engine temperature will increase in kind on the on-screen [[Dashboard#Dashboard items|gauge]]. When the gauge reaches \"OVERHEAT!\" turbo boost cannot be used until the temperature decreases.\n\nAnother notable difference is that police cars occasionally appear that try to stop the player. They have to either be outrun by using the turbo boost or destroyed by the player by ramming them off-road and into an object on the side of the road.\n\nUnlike the original [[Out Run]], Turbo Out Run offers the player a choice between [[automatic transmission]] or two-speed [[manual transmission]].<ref>[http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/reviews/view.php%3Fid%3D756] Retrieved 16 January 2016</ref>\n\nAt every sub-goal (reached after passing through about four cities), a power-up can be chosen, the three being: Hi-Power Engine, Special Turbo, and Super Grip Tires. If the CPU opponent reaches the sub-goal before the player, at the next race, the driver's girlfriend will move to the opponent's car. He can still win the girl back if he beats the CPU opponent to the next sub-goal. If the player beats the opponent with the girl in hand, a 1,000,000 point bonus is given. Also, the girl kisses the driver in front of his CPU opponent.  If the player reaches the final checkpoint, in the process, the player will pass the CPU opponent and the ending scene is played.\n\nIt was available in a stand-up cabinet, and a sit-down cabinet with decals giving it an appearance of a [[Ferrari F40]], the car featured in the game. There were also conversion kits available to convert original ''Out Run'' machines to ''Turbo OutRun''.\n\nComputer ports of the game were received with varying degrees of enthusiasm. Commodore 64 version was widely seen as a good game but 16-bit conversions got very negative reviews.\n\n==Stage Order==\nThe courses are raced straightforward in 4 sections consisting of 4 stages each with no fork roads.\n\n* Stage 1: [[New York City|New York]] (Start of game)\n* Stage 2: [[Washington D.C.]]\n* Stage 3: [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]\n* Stage 4: [[Indianapolis]] (End of section 1)\n* Stage 5: [[Chicago]] (Runs along [[U.S. Route 66|Route 66]])\n* Stage 6: [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]\n* Stage 7: [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]\n* Stage 8: [[Atlanta]] (End of section 2)\n* Stage 9: [[Miami, Florida|Miami]]\n* Stage 10: [[New Orleans]]\n* Stage 11: [[San Antonio]]\n* Stage 12: [[Dallas]] (End of section 3)\n* Stage 13: [[Oklahoma City]]\n* Stage 14: [[Denver]]\n* Stage 15: [[Grand Canyon]] (Runs along Route 66)\n* Stage 16: [[Los Angeles]] (End of game)\n\nAside from the reduction in length (the 9000 km route would take approx 80 hours, the game can be finished in 15 minutes), some of the stages are not accurately portrayed to their real life counterparts. For example: Atlanta is nothing more than a field covered in [[snow]] (more resembling [[Stone Mountain Park]]) and Dallas looks like the [[Gobi Desert]].\n\n==Music==\nUnlike the 1986 original game ''[[Out Run]]'', the music cannot be selected, rather the games background music play in each section of the game in this order:\n\nJapan & US Layout:\n* Rush a Difficulty (Stages 1\u20134)\n* Keep Your Heart (Stages 5\u20138)\n* Shake the Street (Stages 9\u201312)\n* Who Are You? (Stages 13\u201316)\n\nEuropean Layout:\n* Shake the Street (Stages 1\u20134)\n* Rush a Difficulty (Stages 5\u20138)\n* Who Are You? (Stages 9\u201312)\n* Keep Your Heart (Stages 13\u201316)\n\nIn the 1993 [[arcade game]] [[Daytona USA (arcade game)|''Daytona USA'']], a song from ''Turbo Outrun'' can be played on the name entry screen by entering the initials TOR. The result is the opening couple of bars of \"Rush A Difficulty\".\n\n=== Commodore 64 soundtrack ===\nThe Commodore 64 home version soundtrack, composed and arranged by [[Jeroen Tel]], was well received. The soundtrack won the \"Best music on 8-bit computer 1989\" award on [[European Computer Trade Show]]. The title track is a remix of \"Magical Sound Shower\" from ''Out Run'', featuring sound samples from Jeroen Tel himself; due to sampling quality, he was actually saying \"One, two, ''tree''... hit it, Out Run\" while recording, instead of \"three\", to avoid it sounding like \"free\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Brock-Nannestad|first=Laust|title=SID Tune Information List v44|date=2006-01-18|url=http://www.stil.c64.org/|accessdate=2006-07-31|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012074655/http://www.stil.c64.org/|archivedate=2008-10-12}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| CRASH = 79% (Spectrum)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/Crash/Issue73/Pages/Crash7300040.jpg |title=Archive \u2013 Magazine viewer |publisher=World of Spectrum |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref>\n| CVG = 93% (C64)<ref>https://archive.org/stream/cvg-magazine-097/CVG_097_Dec_1989#page/n55/mode/2up</ref>\n| SUser = 78% (Spectrum)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/SinclairUser/Issue094/Pages/SinclairUser09400009.jpg |title=Archive \u2013 Magazine viewer |publisher=World of Spectrum |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref>\n| YSinclair = 70% (Spectrum)<ref name=\"ysrnry1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/turbooutrun.htm |title=Turbo OutRun |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |accessdate=2012-08-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ADseIp9J?url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/turbooutrun.htm |archivedate=2012-08-27 }}</ref>\n| rev1 = ''[[Commodore User]]''\n| rev1Score = 8/10 (Arcade)<ref name=cu-arcade>https://archive.org/stream/commodore-user-magazine-68/Commodore_User_Issue_68_1989_May#page/n95/mode/2up</ref>\n| rev2 = ''[[Zzap!64]]''\n| rev2Score = 97% (C64)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zzap64.co.uk/zzap100/100thspec5.html |title=Zzap!64 100th Issue Pull-Out Special Page 5 |publisher=Zzap64.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref>\n| rev3 = ''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]''\n| rev3Score = 53% (Mega&nbsp;Drive)<ref>Mega rating, issue 9, page 23, [[Future Publishing]], June 1993</ref>\n| rev4 = ''Mean Machines''\n| rev4Score = 42% (Mega&nbsp;Drive)<ref>''Mean Machines'', Issue 18, March 1992, pp. 78-9</ref>\n| rev5 = ''[[MegaTech]]''\n| rev5Score = 41% (Mega&nbsp;Drive)<ref>MegaTech rating, [[EMAP]], issue 5, page 79, May 1992</ref>\n| rev6 = ''[[ACE (games magazine)|ACE]]''\n| rev6Score = 601/1000 (Amiga/ST)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wos.meulie.net/pub/sinclair/magazines/ACE/Issue28/Pages/ACE2800065.jpg |title=Archive \u2013 Magazine viewer |publisher=World of Spectrum |date= |accessdate=2012-08-06}}</ref>\n\n| award1Pub = ''Zzap!64''\n| award1 = Gold Medal\n}}\n''Turbo Outrun'' received positive to mixed reviews, depending on the version.

We say that the number ''x'' is a ''periodic point of period m'' if ''f''<sup>&nbsp;''m''</sup>(''x'') =&nbsp;''x'' (where ''f''<sup>&nbsp;''m''</sup> denotes the [[iterated function|composition of ''m'' copies of ''f'']]) and having ''least period m'' if furthermore ''f''<sup>&nbsp;''k''</sup>(''x'') \u2260 ''x'' for all 0&nbsp;<&nbsp;''k''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''m''. We are interested in the possible periods of periodic points of ''f''. Consider the following ordering of the positive [[integer]]s:\n:<math>\\begin{array}{cccccccc}\n3 & 5 & 7 & 9 & 11 & \\ldots & (2n+1)\\cdot2^{0} & \\ldots\\\\\n3\\cdot2 & 5\\cdot2 & 7\\cdot2 & 9\\cdot2 & 11\\cdot2 & \\ldots & (2n+1)\\cdot2^{1} & \\ldots\\\\\n3\\cdot2^{2} & 5\\cdot2^{2} & 7\\cdot2^{2} & 9\\cdot2^{2} & 11\\cdot2^{2} & \\ldots & (2n+1)\\cdot2^{2} & \\ldots\\\\\n3\\cdot2^{3} & 5\\cdot2^{3} & 7\\cdot2^{3} & 9\\cdot2^{3} & 11\\cdot2^{3} & \\ldots & (2n+1)\\cdot2^{3} & \\ldots\\\\\n & \\vdots\\\\\n\\ldots & 2^{n} & \\ldots & 2^{4} & 2^{3} & 2^{2} & 2 & 1\\end{array}</math>\n\nIt consists of:\n* the odd numbers in increasing order,\n* 2 times the odds in increasing order,\n* 4 times the odds in increasing order,\n* 8 times the odds,\n* etc.\n* at the end we put the powers of two in decreasing order.\n\nThis ordering is a [[total order]] (every positive integer appears exactly once somewhere on this list), but not a [[well-order]] (e.g. there is no 'earliest' power of 2 in it).\n\nSharkovskii's theorem states that if ''f'' has a periodic point of least period ''m'', and ''m'' precedes ''n'' in the above ordering, then ''f'' has also a periodic point of least period ''n''.\n\nAs a consequence, we see that if ''f'' has only finitely many periodic points, then they must all have periods that are powers of two. Furthermore, if there is a periodic point of period three, then there are periodic points of all other periods.\n\nSharkovskii's theorem does not state that there are ''stable'' cycles of those periods, just that there are cycles of those periods. For systems such as the [[logistic map]], the [[bifurcation diagram]] shows a range of parameter values for which apparently the only cycle has period 3. In fact, there must be cycles of all periods there, but they are not stable and therefore not visible on the computer-generated picture.\n\nThe assumption of continuity is important, as the discontinuous [[piecewise linear function]] <math>f:[0,3) \\to [0,3)</math> defined as:\n: <math>f: x\\mapsto \\begin{cases}x+1 &\\mathrm{for\\ } 0\\le x<2 \\\\ x-2 &\\mathrm{for\\ } 2\\le x< 3\\end{cases}</math>\nfor which every value has period 3, would otherwise be a counterexample.\n\nSimilarly essential is the assumption of <math>f</math> being defined on an interval \u2013 otherwise <math>f : x \\mapsto (1 - x)^{-1}</math>, which is defined on real numbers except the one: <math>\\mathbb R\\setminus\\{1\\},</math> for which every non-zero value has period 3, would be a counterexample.\n\n==Generalizations==\n\nSharkovskii also proved the converse theorem: every [[upper set]] of the above order is the set of periods for some continuous function from an interval to itself.

The poets included: [[Leslie Scalapino]], [[Stephen Rodefer]], [[Bruce Andrews]], [[Charles Bernstein]], [[Ron Silliman]], [[Barrett Watten]], [[Lyn Hejinian]], [[Tom Mandel (poet)|Tom Mandel]], [[Bob Perelman]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Alan Davies (poet)|Alan Davies]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[Clark Coolidge]], [[Hannah Weiner]], [[Susan Howe]], and [[Tina Darragh]].\n\nLanguage poetry emphasizes the reader's role in bringing meaning out of a work. It plays down expression, seeing the poem as a construction in and of language itself. In more theoretical terms, it challenges the \"[[nature|natural]]\" presence of a speaker behind the text; and emphasizes the [[disjunction]] and the [[Substance theory|materiality]] of the [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]].<ref name=\"Kaoirala\">Saroj Koirala (2016), \"[https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/TUJ/article/view/25968 Linking Words with the World: The Language Poetry Mission]\", ''Tribhuvan University Journal'', vol. 29, no. 1, pp. 175-190; here: p. 179. {{doi|10.3126/tuj.v29i1.25968}}. Retrieved 2020-04-11.</ref> These poets favor [[prose poetry]], especially in longer and non-[[narrative]] forms.<ref name=\"Kaoirala\"/>\n\nIn developing their [[poetics]], members of the Language school took as their starting point the emphasis on method evident in the [[modernist poetry|modernist]] tradition, particularly as represented by [[Gertrude Stein]], [[William Carlos Williams]], and [[Louis Zukofsky]]. Language poetry is an example of poetic [[postmodernism]]. Its immediate postmodern precursors were the [[The New American Poetry 1945-1960|New American poets]], a term including the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], the [[Objectivist poets]], the [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain School]], the [[Beat generation|Beat]] poets, and the [[San Francisco Renaissance]].\n\nLanguage poetry has been a [[controversy|controversial topic]] in American [[Literature|letters]] from the 1970s to the present. Even the name has been controversial: while a number of poets and critics have used the name of the journal to refer to the group, many others have chosen to use the term, when they used it at all, without the [[equals sign]]s. The terms \"language writing\" and \"language-centered writing\" are also commonly used, and are perhaps the most generic terms. None of the poets associated with the tendency has used the equal signs when referring to the writing collectively. Its use in some critical articles can be taken as an indicator of the author's outsider status.<ref>Michael Greer (Winter/Spring 1989). \"Ideology and Theory in Recent Experimental Writing or, the Naming of 'Language Poetry'\", ''boundary 2'', vol. 16, no. 2/3, pp. 335\u2013355.

On the West Coast, an early seed of language poetry was the launch of ''[[This (magazine)|This]]'' magazine, edited by [[Robert Grenier (poet)|Robert Grenier]] and Watten, in 1971. ''[[L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E (magazine)|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E]]'', edited by [[Bruce Andrews]] and [[Charles Bernstein]], ran from 1978 to 1982, and was published in New York. It featured poetics, forums on writers in the movement, and themes such as \"The Politics of Poetry\" and \"Reading Stein\". [[Ron Silliman]]'s poetry newsletter ''Tottel's'' (1970\u201381),<ref>Available online at the ''Eclipse'' archive: [http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/projects/TOTTELS/ ''Tottel's Magazine''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807171904/http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/projects/TOTTELS/ |date=2007-08-07 }}.</ref> [[Bruce Andrews]]'s selections in a special issue of ''Toothpick'' (1973), as well as [[Lyn Hejinian]]'s editing of Tuumba Press, and James Sherry's editing of ROOF magazine also contributed to the development of ideas in language poetry. The first significant collection of language-centered poetics was the article, \"The Politics of the Referent,\" edited by [[Steve McCaffery]] for the Toronto-based publication, ''Open Letter'' (1977).\n\nIn an essay from the first issue of ''This'', Grenier declared: \"I HATE SPEECH\". Grenier's ironic statement (itself a speech act), and a questioning attitude to the referentiality of language, became central to language poets. Ron Silliman, in the introduction to his anthology ''In the American Tree,'' appealed to a number of young U.S. poets who were dissatisfied with the work of the [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain]] and [[Beat generation|Beat]] poets.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 90%; background:#CC9966; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | \n\"I HATE SPEECH\" \u2014 '''Robert Grenier'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" | \n: \"Thus capitalized, these words in an essay entitled \"On Speech,\" the second of five short critical pieces by Robert Grenier in the first issue of ''This'', the magazine he cofounded with Barrett Watten in winter, 1971, announced a breach \u2013 and a new moment in American writing.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" | '''Ron Silliman'''<ref>\"Introduction: Language, Realism, Poetry,\" ''In The American Tree'' (See below \"Further reading: Anthologies\")</ref>\n|}\n\nThe range of poetry published that focused on \"[[Philosophy of language|language]]\" in ''This,'' ''Tottel's,'' ''L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E'', and also in several other key publications and essays of the time, established the field of discussion that would emerge as Language (or L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E) poetry.\n\nDuring the 1970s, a number of magazines published poets who would become associated with the Language movement. These included ''A Hundred Posters'' (edited by [[Alan Davies (poet)|Alan Davies]]), ''Big Deal,'' ''Dog City,'' ''Hills,'' ''L\u00e0 Bas,'' ''MIAM,'' ''Oculist Witnesses,'' ''QU,'' and ''Roof.'' ''[[Poetics Journal]],'' which published writings in poetics and was edited by [[Lyn Hejinian]] and [[Barrett Watten]], appeared from 1982 to 1998. Significant early gatherings of Language writing included Bruce Andrews's selection in ''Toothpick'' (1973); Silliman's selection \"The Dwelling Place: 9 Poets\" in ''Alcheringa,'' (1975), and Charles Bernstein's \"A Language Sampler,\" in ''The Paris Review'' (1982).\n\nCertain poetry reading series, especially in New York, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco, were important venues for the performance of this new work, and for the development of dialogue and collaboration among poets. Most important were Ear Inn reading series in New York, founded in 1978 by Ted Greenwald and Charles Bernstein and later organized through James Sherry's Segue Foundation and curated by Mitch Highfill, Jeanne Lance, Andrew Levy, Rob Fitterman, Laynie Brown, Alan Davies, and [[The Poetry Society of New York]]; Folio Books in Washington, D.C., founded by Doug Lang; and the Grand Piano reading series in San Francisco, which was curated by [[Barrett Watten]], [[Ron Silliman]], [[Tom Mandel (poet)|Tom Mandel]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Ted Pearson]], [[Carla Harryman]], and [[Steve Benson (poet)|Steve Benson]] at various times.\n\nPoets, some of whom have been mentioned above, who were associated with the first wave of Language poetry include: [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Stephen Rodefer]] (1940\u20132015), [[Steve Benson (poet)|Steve Benson]], [[Abigail Child]], [[Clark Coolidge]], [[Tina Darragh]], [[Alan Davies (poet)|Alan Davies]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[P. Inman]], [[Lynne Dryer]], [[Madeline Gins]], [[Michael Gottlieb (poet)|Michael Gottlieb]], [[Fanny Howe]], [[Susan Howe]], [[Jackson Mac Low]] (1922\u20132004), [[Tom Mandel (poet)|Tom Mandel]], [[Bernadette Mayer]], [[Steve McCaffery]], [[Michael Palmer (poet)|Michael Palmer]], [[Ted Pearson]], [[Bob Perelman]], [[Nick Piombino]], [[Peter Seaton]] (1942\u20132010), [[Joan Retallack]], [[Erica Hunt]], [[James Sherry (poet)|James Sherry]], [[Jean Day]], [[Kit Robinson]], [[Ted Greenwald]], [[Leslie Scalapino]] (1944\u20132010), [[Diane Ward]], [[Rosmarie Waldrop]], and [[Hannah Weiner]] (1928\u20131997). This list accurately reflects the high proportion of [[List of women poets|female poets]] across the spectrum of the Language writing movement.<ref>{{citation|author=Ann Vickery|title=Leaving Lines of Gender: A Feminist Genealogy of Language Writing|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|year=2000}}</ref> [[African-American literature|African-American poets]] associated with the movement include Hunt, [[Nathaniel Mackey]], and [[Harryette Mullen]].\n\n==Poetics of language writing: theory and practice==\nLanguage poetry emphasizes the reader's role in bringing meaning out of a work. It developed in part in response to what poets considered the uncritical use of expressive lyric sentiment among earlier poetry movements. In the 1950s and 1960s, certain groups of poets had followed [[William Carlos Williams]] in his use of [[idiomatic]] American English rather than what they considered the 'heightened', or overtly poetic language favored by the [[New Criticism]] movement. [[New York School (art)|New York School]] poets like [[Frank O'Hara]] and [[Black Mountain poets|the Black Mountain group]] emphasized both speech and everyday language in their poetry and poetics.\n\nIn contrast, some of the Language poets emphasized [[metonymy]], [[synecdoche]] and extreme instances of [[parataxis|paratactical]] structures in their compositions, which, even when employing everyday speech, created a far different texture. The result is often alien and difficult to understand at first glance, which is what Language poetry intends: for the reader to participate in creating the meaning of the poem.<ref>See, for example, [[Ronald Johnson (poet)|Ronald Johnson]]'s ''RADI OS'' in  [http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/projects/LANGUAGEn1/pictures/007.shtml L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, volume 1].</ref>\n\nWatten's & Grenier's magazine '''[[This (magazine)|This]]''' (and '''[[This Press]]''' which Watten edited), along with the magazine ''L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E'', published work by notable [[Black Mountain poets]] such as [[Robert Creeley]] and [[Larry Eigner]]. Silliman considers Language poetry to be a continuation (albeit incorporating a critique) of the earlier movements. Watten has emphasized the discontinuity between the [[The New American Poetry 1945-1960|New American poets]], whose writing, he argues, privileged self-expression, and the Language poets, who see the poem as a construction in and of language itself. In contrast, Bernstein has emphasized the expressive possibilities of working with constructed, and even found, language.\n\n[[Gertrude Stein]], particularly in her writing after ''Tender Buttons,'' and [[Louis Zukofsky]], in his book-length poem ''A,'' are the modernist poets who most influenced the Language school. In the postwar period, [[John Cage]], [[Jackson Mac Low]], and poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] ([[John Ashbery]], [[Frank O'Hara]], [[Ted Berrigan]]) and [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain School]] ([[Robert Creeley]], [[Charles Olson]], and [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]]) are most recognizable as precursors to the Language poets. Many of these poets used procedural methods based on mathematical sequences and other logical organising devices to structure their poetry. This practice proved highly useful to the language group. The application of process, especially at the level of the [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], was to become the basic tenet of language [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]. Stein's influence was related to her own frequent use of language divorced from reference in her own writings. The language poets also drew on the philosophical works of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], especially the concepts of [[language-game]]s, meaning as use, and [[family resemblance]] among different uses, as the solution to the [[Problem of universals]].\n\n===Language poetry in the early 21st century===\nIn many ways, what Language poetry is <!-- not a mistake-->is still being determined. Most of the poets whose work falls within the bounds of the Language school are still alive and still active contributors. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Language poetry was widely received as a significant movement in innovative poetry in the U.S., a trend accentuated by the fact that some of its leading proponents took up academic posts in the [[Poetics]], [[Creative Writing]] and [[English Literature]] departments in prominent universities ([[University of Pennsylvania]], [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|SUNY Buffalo]], [[Wayne State University]], [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[University of California, San Diego]], [[University of Maine]], the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]]).\n\nLanguage poetry also developed affiliations with literary scenes outside the States, notably England, Canada (through the [[Kootenay school of writing]] in Vancouver), [[French literature|France]], the [[USSR]], [[Brazil]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australia]]. It had a particularly interesting relation to the UK ''[[avant-garde]]'': in the 1970s and 1980s there were extensive contacts between American Language poets and veteran UK writers like [[Tom Raworth]] and [[Allen Fisher]], or younger figures such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], and [[Ken Edwards]] (whose magazine ''Reality Studios'' was instrumental in the transatlantic dialogue between American and UK ''avant-garde''s). Other writers, such as [[J.H. Prynne]] and those associated with the so-called [[British Poetry Revival#Cambridge|\"Cambridge\" poetry scene]] ([[Rod Mengham]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Peter Riley]]) were perhaps more skeptical about language poetry and its associated [[polemics]] and theoretical documents, though Geoff Ward wrote a book about the phenomena.\n\nA second generation of poets influenced by the Language poets includes [[Eric Selland]] (also a noted translator of modern Japanese poetry), [[Lisa Robertson (poet)|Lisa Robertson]], [[Juliana Spahr]], the [[Kootenay School]] poets, [[conceptual writing]], [[Flarf]] collectives, and many others.\n\nA significant number of women poets, and magazines and anthologies of innovative women's poetry, have been associated with language poetry on both sides of the Atlantic. They often represent a distinct set of concerns. Among the poets are [[Leslie Scalapino]], [[Madeline Gins]], [[Susan Howe]], [[Lyn Hejinian]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Jean Day]], [[Hannah Weiner]], [[Tina Darragh]], [[Erica Hunt]], [[Lynne Dreyer]], [[Harryette Mullen]], [[Beverly Dahlen]], [[Johanna Drucker]], [[Abigail Child]], and [[Karen Mac Cormack]]; among the magazines [[HOW/ever]], later the e-based journal [[HOW2]]; and among the anthologies ''[[Out of Everywhere: Linguistically Innovative Poetry by Women in North America & the UK]],'' edited by Maggie O'Sullivan for Reality Street Editions in London (1996) and Mary Margaret Sloan's ''[[Moving Borders: Three Decades of Innovative Writing by Women]]'' (Jersey City: Talisman Publishers, 1998).\n\nTen of the Language poets, each of whom at one time curated the reading series at the San Francisco coffee house of that name, collaborated to write ''The Grand Piano'', \"an experiment in collective autobiography\" published in ten small volumes. Editing and communication for the collaboration was accomplished over email. Authors of The Grand Piano were [[Lyn Hejinian]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Tom Mandel (poet) |Tom Mandel]], [[Ron Silliman]], [[Barrett Watten]], [[Steve Benson (poet) |Steve Benson]], [[Bob Perelman]], [[Ted Pearson]], and [[Kit Robinson]]. An eleventh member of the project, [[Alan Bernheimer]], served as an archivist and contributed one essay on the filmmaker [[Warren Sonbert]]. The authors of The Grand Piano sought to reconnect their writing practices and to \"recall and contextualize events from the period of the late 1970s.\"<ref>Barrett Watten, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070630065810/http://www.english.wayne.edu/fac_pages/ewatten/posts/post34.html \"How ''The Grand Piano'' Is Being Written\"], archived from the [http://www.english.wayne.edu/fac_pages/ewatten/posts/post34.html original] on 2007-06-30.

Retrieved 2020-04-12.</ref> Each volume of ''The Grand Piano'' features essays by all ten authors in different sequence; often responding to prompts and problems arising from one another's essays in the series.\n\nSome poets, such as [[Norman Finkelstein (poet)|Norman Finkelstein]], have stressed their own ambiguous relationship to \"Language poetry\", even after decades of fruitful engagement. Finkelstein, in a discussion with Mark Scroggins about ''The Grand Piano'', points to a \"risk\" when previously marginalized poets try to write their own literary histories, \"not the least of which is a self-regard bordering on narcissism\".<ref>Mark Scroggin (April 2007), [http://kulturindustrie.blogspot.com/2007/04/toy-piano.html \"The Toy Piano\"], ''Culture Industry'' blog, with commentary by Norman Finkelstein.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of poetry groups and movements]]\n* [[List of literary movements]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n==Further reading==\n\n===Anthologies===\n*[[Donald Allen|Allen, Donald]], ed.

The poets included: [[Leslie Scalapino]], [[Stephen Rodefer]], [[Bruce Andrews]], [[Charles Bernstein]], [[Ron Silliman]], [[Barrett Watten]], [[Lyn Hejinian]], [[Tom Mandel (poet)|Tom Mandel]], [[Bob Perelman]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Alan Davies (poet)|Alan Davies]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[Clark Coolidge]], [[Hannah Weiner]], [[Susan Howe]], and [[Tina Darragh]].\n\nLanguage poetry emphasizes the reader's role in bringing meaning out of a work. It plays down expression, seeing the poem as a construction in and of language itself. In more theoretical terms, it challenges the \"[[nature|natural]]\" presence of a speaker behind the text; and emphasizes the [[disjunction]] and the [[Substance theory|materiality]] of the [[Sign (linguistics)|signifier]].<ref name=\"Kaoirala\">Saroj Koirala (2016), \"[https://www.nepjol.info/index.php/TUJ/article/view/25968 Linking Words with the World: The Language Poetry Mission]\", ''Tribhuvan University Journal'', vol. 29, no. 1, pp. 175-190; here: p. 179. {{doi|10.3126/tuj.v29i1.25968}}. Retrieved 2020-04-11.</ref> These poets favor [[prose poetry]], especially in longer and non-[[narrative]] forms.<ref name=\"Kaoirala\"/>\n\nIn developing their [[poetics]], members of the Language school took as their starting point the emphasis on method evident in the [[modernist poetry|modernist]] tradition, particularly as represented by [[Gertrude Stein]], [[William Carlos Williams]], and [[Louis Zukofsky]]. Language poetry is an example of poetic [[postmodernism]]. Its immediate postmodern precursors were the [[The New American Poetry 1945-1960|New American poets]], a term including the [[New York School (art)|New York School]], the [[Objectivist poets]], the [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain School]], the [[Beat generation|Beat]] poets, and the [[San Francisco Renaissance]].\n\nLanguage poetry has been a [[controversy|controversial topic]] in American [[Literature|letters]] from the 1970s to the present. Even the name has been controversial: while a number of poets and critics have used the name of the journal to refer to the group, many others have chosen to use the term, when they used it at all, without the [[equals sign]]s. The terms \"language writing\" and \"language-centered writing\" are also commonly used, and are perhaps the most generic terms. None of the poets associated with the tendency has used the equal signs when referring to the writing collectively. Its use in some critical articles can be taken as an indicator of the author's outsider status.<ref>Michael Greer (Winter/Spring 1989). \"Ideology and Theory in Recent Experimental Writing or, the Naming of 'Language Poetry'\", ''boundary 2'', vol. 16, no. 2/3, pp. 335\u2013355.

On the West Coast, an early seed of language poetry was the launch of ''[[This (magazine)|This]]'' magazine, edited by [[Robert Grenier (poet)|Robert Grenier]] and Watten, in 1971. ''[[L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E (magazine)|L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E]]'', edited by [[Bruce Andrews]] and [[Charles Bernstein]], ran from 1978 to 1982, and was published in New York. It featured poetics, forums on writers in the movement, and themes such as \"The Politics of Poetry\" and \"Reading Stein\". [[Ron Silliman]]'s poetry newsletter ''Tottel's'' (1970\u201381),<ref>Available online at the ''Eclipse'' archive: [http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/projects/TOTTELS/ ''Tottel's Magazine''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807171904/http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/projects/TOTTELS/ |date=2007-08-07 }}.</ref> [[Bruce Andrews]]'s selections in a special issue of ''Toothpick'' (1973), as well as [[Lyn Hejinian]]'s editing of Tuumba Press, and James Sherry's editing of ROOF magazine also contributed to the development of ideas in language poetry. The first significant collection of language-centered poetics was the article, \"The Politics of the Referent,\" edited by [[Steve McCaffery]] for the Toronto-based publication, ''Open Letter'' (1977).\n\nIn an essay from the first issue of ''This'', Grenier declared: \"I HATE SPEECH\". Grenier's ironic statement (itself a speech act), and a questioning attitude to the referentiality of language, became central to language poets. Ron Silliman, in the introduction to his anthology ''In the American Tree,'' appealed to a number of young U.S. poets who were dissatisfied with the work of the [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain]] and [[Beat generation|Beat]] poets.\n\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float: left; margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 1em; font-size: 90%; background:#CC9966; width:30em; max-width: 40%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: center;\" | \n\"I HATE SPEECH\" \u2014 '''Robert Grenier'''\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" | \n: \"Thus capitalized, these words in an essay entitled \"On Speech,\" the second of five short critical pieces by Robert Grenier in the first issue of ''This'', the magazine he cofounded with Barrett Watten in winter, 1971, announced a breach \u2013 and a new moment in American writing.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: right;\" | '''Ron Silliman'''<ref>\"Introduction: Language, Realism, Poetry,\" ''In The American Tree'' (See below \"Further reading: Anthologies\")</ref>\n|}\n\nThe range of poetry published that focused on \"[[Philosophy of language|language]]\" in ''This,'' ''Tottel's,'' ''L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E'', and also in several other key publications and essays of the time, established the field of discussion that would emerge as Language (or L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E) poetry.\n\nDuring the 1970s, a number of magazines published poets who would become associated with the Language movement. These included ''A Hundred Posters'' (edited by [[Alan Davies (poet)|Alan Davies]]), ''Big Deal,'' ''Dog City,'' ''Hills,'' ''L\u00e0 Bas,'' ''MIAM,'' ''Oculist Witnesses,'' ''QU,'' and ''Roof.'' ''[[Poetics Journal]],'' which published writings in poetics and was edited by [[Lyn Hejinian]] and [[Barrett Watten]], appeared from 1982 to 1998. Significant early gatherings of Language writing included Bruce Andrews's selection in ''Toothpick'' (1973); Silliman's selection \"The Dwelling Place: 9 Poets\" in ''Alcheringa,'' (1975), and Charles Bernstein's \"A Language Sampler,\" in ''The Paris Review'' (1982).\n\nCertain poetry reading series, especially in New York, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco, were important venues for the performance of this new work, and for the development of dialogue and collaboration among poets. Most important were Ear Inn reading series in New York, founded in 1978 by Ted Greenwald and Charles Bernstein and later organized through James Sherry's Segue Foundation and curated by Mitch Highfill, Jeanne Lance, Andrew Levy, Rob Fitterman, Laynie Brown, Alan Davies, and [[The Poetry Society of New York]]; Folio Books in Washington, D.C., founded by Doug Lang; and the Grand Piano reading series in San Francisco, which was curated by [[Barrett Watten]], [[Ron Silliman]], [[Tom Mandel (poet)|Tom Mandel]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Ted Pearson]], [[Carla Harryman]], and [[Steve Benson (poet)|Steve Benson]] at various times.\n\nPoets, some of whom have been mentioned above, who were associated with the first wave of Language poetry include: [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Stephen Rodefer]] (1940\u20132015), [[Steve Benson (poet)|Steve Benson]], [[Abigail Child]], [[Clark Coolidge]], [[Tina Darragh]], [[Alan Davies (poet)|Alan Davies]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[P. Inman]], [[Lynne Dryer]], [[Madeline Gins]], [[Michael Gottlieb (poet)|Michael Gottlieb]], [[Fanny Howe]], [[Susan Howe]], [[Jackson Mac Low]] (1922\u20132004), [[Tom Mandel (poet)|Tom Mandel]], [[Bernadette Mayer]], [[Steve McCaffery]], [[Michael Palmer (poet)|Michael Palmer]], [[Ted Pearson]], [[Bob Perelman]], [[Nick Piombino]], [[Peter Seaton]] (1942\u20132010), [[Joan Retallack]], [[Erica Hunt]], [[James Sherry (poet)|James Sherry]], [[Jean Day]], [[Kit Robinson]], [[Ted Greenwald]], [[Leslie Scalapino]] (1944\u20132010), [[Diane Ward]], [[Rosmarie Waldrop]], and [[Hannah Weiner]] (1928\u20131997). This list accurately reflects the high proportion of [[List of women poets|female poets]] across the spectrum of the Language writing movement.<ref>{{citation|author=Ann Vickery|title=Leaving Lines of Gender: A Feminist Genealogy of Language Writing|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|year=2000}}</ref> [[African-American literature|African-American poets]] associated with the movement include Hunt, [[Nathaniel Mackey]], and [[Harryette Mullen]].\n\n==Poetics of language writing: theory and practice==\nLanguage poetry emphasizes the reader's role in bringing meaning out of a work. It developed in part in response to what poets considered the uncritical use of expressive lyric sentiment among earlier poetry movements. In the 1950s and 1960s, certain groups of poets had followed [[William Carlos Williams]] in his use of [[idiomatic]] American English rather than what they considered the 'heightened', or overtly poetic language favored by the [[New Criticism]] movement. [[New York School (art)|New York School]] poets like [[Frank O'Hara]] and [[Black Mountain poets|the Black Mountain group]] emphasized both speech and everyday language in their poetry and poetics.\n\nIn contrast, some of the Language poets emphasized [[metonymy]], [[synecdoche]] and extreme instances of [[parataxis|paratactical]] structures in their compositions, which, even when employing everyday speech, created a far different texture. The result is often alien and difficult to understand at first glance, which is what Language poetry intends: for the reader to participate in creating the meaning of the poem.<ref>See, for example, [[Ronald Johnson (poet)|Ronald Johnson]]'s ''RADI OS'' in  [http://english.utah.edu/eclipse/projects/LANGUAGEn1/pictures/007.shtml L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E, volume 1].</ref>\n\nWatten's & Grenier's magazine '''[[This (magazine)|This]]''' (and '''[[This Press]]''' which Watten edited), along with the magazine ''L=A=N=G=U=A=G=E'', published work by notable [[Black Mountain poets]] such as [[Robert Creeley]] and [[Larry Eigner]]. Silliman considers Language poetry to be a continuation (albeit incorporating a critique) of the earlier movements. Watten has emphasized the discontinuity between the [[The New American Poetry 1945-1960|New American poets]], whose writing, he argues, privileged self-expression, and the Language poets, who see the poem as a construction in and of language itself. In contrast, Bernstein has emphasized the expressive possibilities of working with constructed, and even found, language.\n\n[[Gertrude Stein]], particularly in her writing after ''Tender Buttons,'' and [[Louis Zukofsky]], in his book-length poem ''A,'' are the modernist poets who most influenced the Language school. In the postwar period, [[John Cage]], [[Jackson Mac Low]], and poets of the [[New York School (art)|New York School]] ([[John Ashbery]], [[Frank O'Hara]], [[Ted Berrigan]]) and [[Black Mountain poets|Black Mountain School]] ([[Robert Creeley]], [[Charles Olson]], and [[Robert Duncan (poet)|Robert Duncan]]) are most recognizable as precursors to the Language poets. Many of these poets used procedural methods based on mathematical sequences and other logical organising devices to structure their poetry. This practice proved highly useful to the language group. The application of process, especially at the level of the [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]], was to become the basic tenet of language [[Praxis (process)|praxis]]. Stein's influence was related to her own frequent use of language divorced from reference in her own writings. The language poets also drew on the philosophical works of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], especially the concepts of [[language-game]]s, meaning as use, and [[family resemblance]] among different uses, as the solution to the [[Problem of universals]].\n\n===Language poetry in the early 21st century===\nIn many ways, what Language poetry is <!-- not a mistake-->is still being determined. Most of the poets whose work falls within the bounds of the Language school are still alive and still active contributors. During the late 1980s and early 1990s, Language poetry was widely received as a significant movement in innovative poetry in the U.S., a trend accentuated by the fact that some of its leading proponents took up academic posts in the [[Poetics]], [[Creative Writing]] and [[English Literature]] departments in prominent universities ([[University of Pennsylvania]], [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|SUNY Buffalo]], [[Wayne State University]], [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[University of California, San Diego]], [[University of Maine]], the [[Iowa Writers' Workshop]]).\n\nLanguage poetry also developed affiliations with literary scenes outside the States, notably England, Canada (through the [[Kootenay school of writing]] in Vancouver), [[French literature|France]], the [[USSR]], [[Brazil]], [[Finland]], [[Sweden]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australia]]. It had a particularly interesting relation to the UK ''[[avant-garde]]'': in the 1970s and 1980s there were extensive contacts between American Language poets and veteran UK writers like [[Tom Raworth]] and [[Allen Fisher]], or younger figures such as [[Caroline Bergvall]], [[Maggie O'Sullivan]], [[cris cheek]], and [[Ken Edwards]] (whose magazine ''Reality Studios'' was instrumental in the transatlantic dialogue between American and UK ''avant-garde''s). Other writers, such as [[J.H. Prynne]] and those associated with the so-called [[British Poetry Revival#Cambridge|\"Cambridge\" poetry scene]] ([[Rod Mengham]], [[Douglas Oliver]], [[Peter Riley]]) were perhaps more skeptical about language poetry and its associated [[polemics]] and theoretical documents, though Geoff Ward wrote a book about the phenomena.\n\nA second generation of poets influenced by the Language poets includes [[Eric Selland]] (also a noted translator of modern Japanese poetry), [[Lisa Robertson (poet)|Lisa Robertson]], [[Juliana Spahr]], the [[Kootenay School]] poets, [[conceptual writing]], [[Flarf]] collectives, and many others.\n\nA significant number of women poets, and magazines and anthologies of innovative women's poetry, have been associated with language poetry on both sides of the Atlantic. They often represent a distinct set of concerns. Among the poets are [[Leslie Scalapino]], [[Madeline Gins]], [[Susan Howe]], [[Lyn Hejinian]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Jean Day]], [[Hannah Weiner]], [[Tina Darragh]], [[Erica Hunt]], [[Lynne Dreyer]], [[Harryette Mullen]], [[Beverly Dahlen]], [[Johanna Drucker]], [[Abigail Child]], and [[Karen Mac Cormack]]; among the magazines [[HOW/ever]], later the e-based journal [[HOW2]]; and among the anthologies ''[[Out of Everywhere: Linguistically Innovative Poetry by Women in North America & the UK]],'' edited by Maggie O'Sullivan for Reality Street Editions in London (1996) and Mary Margaret Sloan's ''[[Moving Borders: Three Decades of Innovative Writing by Women]]'' (Jersey City: Talisman Publishers, 1998).\n\nTen of the Language poets, each of whom at one time curated the reading series at the San Francisco coffee house of that name, collaborated to write ''The Grand Piano'', \"an experiment in collective autobiography\" published in ten small volumes. Editing and communication for the collaboration was accomplished over email. Authors of The Grand Piano were [[Lyn Hejinian]], [[Carla Harryman]], [[Rae Armantrout]], [[Tom Mandel (poet) |Tom Mandel]], [[Ron Silliman]], [[Barrett Watten]], [[Steve Benson (poet) |Steve Benson]], [[Bob Perelman]], [[Ted Pearson]], and [[Kit Robinson]]. An eleventh member of the project, [[Alan Bernheimer]], served as an archivist and contributed one essay on the filmmaker [[Warren Sonbert]]. The authors of The Grand Piano sought to reconnect their writing practices and to \"recall and contextualize events from the period of the late 1970s.\"<ref>Barrett Watten, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070630065810/http://www.english.wayne.edu/fac_pages/ewatten/posts/post34.html \"How ''The Grand Piano'' Is Being Written\"], archived from the [http://www.english.wayne.edu/fac_pages/ewatten/posts/post34.html original] on 2007-06-30.

{"title_page": "Thomas FitzWilliam, 1st Viscount FitzWilliam", "text_new": "'''Thomas FitzWilliam, 1st Viscount Fitzwilliam''' (1581\u20131650) was an Irish nobleman of the Stuart age. He was born to wealth and privilege, and acquired a peerage, but due to his loyalty to the English  Crown he suffered  considerable hardship  during the [[English Civil War]], and died in poverty.\n\n==Background==\nHe was born in [[Dublin]], probably at [[Merrion Castle]], eldest of the five  sons  of Sir Richard FitzWiliam, Constable of [[Wicklow]], and Jane Preston, daughter of Christopher Preston, 4th [[Viscount Gormanston]].<ref>Ball, F. Elrington  ''History of Dublin'' Alexander Thom and Co. Dublin 1902-1920 Vol.2  p.11</ref> The FitzWilliam family are recorded   in Dublin from about 1210, and by the time of Thomas's  birth they  were among the wealthiest and most influential families in [[the Pale]].\n\n==Early career==\nThomas was only fourteen when his father died.  As a young man he spent some time in [[London]] studying law at [[Gray's Inn]].  He  was [[knighted]] in 1605, the year of his marriage.\n\nIn 1608 he narrowly avoided being caught up  in the rebellion of Sir [[Cahir O'Doherty]], having stood [[surety]]  for the good behaviour of O'Doherty, who had married Thomas's  aunt Mary Preston.<ref>Ball, p.12</ref> A messenger arrived at Merrion Castle ordering FitzWilliam to produce the person of O'Doherty; fortunately FitzWilliam was not at home. No doubts   seem to have been entertained about his own loyalty to the Crown, except perhaps during the latter part of the  English  Civil War, and in 1629 King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] created him [[Viscount FitzWilliam]] in recognition of his family's long record of service to the Crown.<ref>Cokayne  ''Complete Peerage'' 6 volumes. Reissued  2000 Vol. 5, p. 527</ref> It appears that a good deal was expected in return for the title, and Thomas had to make substantial gifts of money  to the King. This put a particular burden on his estates since he was involved in  protracted litigation with his numerous brothers and sisters, due to  his father's breaking of an [[entail]] on the estates, which benefitted Thomas  at the expense of  his siblings. Like nearly all of his family he inclined to the [[Roman Catholic]]  faith, while adhering in public to the [[Church of Ireland]]; later generations of  Fitzwilliams were more overt in their support for the Catholic  religion.\n\n==Civil war and last years==\nWhen the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] broke out, FitzWilliam, unlike many of the nobility of the Pale, remained loyal to the Crown, despite strong pressure from his mother's family, the Prestons of Gormanston, to join the [[Irish Confederacy]].<ref>Ball, p.13</ref> He was one of  only three nobles to offer their assistance in the [[Royalist]] defence of Dublin, and a garrison was placed in Merrion Castle. It was betrayed in June 1642 and thereafter FitzWilliam only lived there for short periods. He went to London to offer his services to the Crown, but  despite his long record of loyalty to the Crown he was rebuffed, apparently on account of his known leanings towards the Roman Catholic religion,  and he  took no further part in the fighting. In his last years he led an unsettled existence, living  sometimes at Merrion Castle,  sometimes with his eldest son at [[Howth]], and sometimes in [[Louth, County Louth|Louth]]. At times he seems to have been almost destitute, and  he wrote to  [[ James Butler, 1st Duke  of Ormonde]] in 1647 asking for repayment of a [[debt]]. In 1648 he was promised a [[pension]]  of \u00a3100 a year, but it is unclear if he ever received it.<ref>Ball, p.16</ref>\n\nDue perhaps to the confused conditions of the [[ English Civil War]], little seems to be known about the date and place of his death. Even the year has been disputed, but is generally stated to be 1650. He was certainly dead before 1655 when his eldest surviving son Oliver was allowed to inherit a part of the estates, though most of them were not restored until 1663.<ref>Ball, p.18</ref>\n\n==Family==\nIn 1605 he married Margaret Plunkett, daughter of Oliver Plunkett, 4th [[Baron Louth]] and  his wife Frances, who was the daughter of [[Nicholas Bagenal]] and Eleanor Griffith,   and  sister of [[Henry Bagenal]] and of Mabel, Countess of Tyrone.<ref>Cokayne ''Complete Peerage'', p. 527</ref> They had four sons:\n*Richard, who predeceased his father: He married Elizabeth Stanihust but  had no children;\n*[[Oliver FitzWilliam, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell]],  who   was married  three times but had no children;\n*Christopher, who lived mainly in England:  he married Jane Brereton of [[Malpas, Cheshire|Malpas]] (whose sister Dorothy was  his brother Oliver's first wife)  and  had one surviving daughter but no son;\n*[[William FitzWilliam, 3rd Viscount FitzWilliam]], ancestor of  all succeeding Viscounts Fitzwilliam.\n\n==Character==\nHis friend [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde]] described him as a man who was  \"in every way faithful to his allegiance\".<ref>Ball, p.13</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fitzwilliam, Thomas Fitzwilliam, 1st Viscount}}\n[[Category:Viscounts in the Peerage of Ireland]]\n[[Category:1581 births]]\n[[Category:1650 deaths]]\n[[Category:16th-century Irish people]]\n[[Category:17th-century Irish people]]\n[[Category:People from Mount Merrion]]\n[[Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland]]\n", "text_old": "'''Thomas FitzWilliam, 1st Viscount Fitzwilliam''' (1581\u20131650) was an Irish nobleman of the Stuart age.

Reissued  2000 Vol. 5, p. 527</ref> It appears that a good deal was expected in return for the title, and Thomas had to make substantial gifts of money  to the King. This put a particular burden on his estates since he was involved in  protracted litigation with his numerous brothers and sisters, due to  his father's breaking of an [[entail]] on the estates, which benefitted Thomas  at the expense of  his siblings. Like nearly all of his family he inclined to the [[Roman Catholic]]  faith, while adhering in public to the [[Church of Ireland]]; later generations of  Fitzwilliams were more overt in their support for the Catholic  religion.\n\n==Civil war and last years==\nWhen the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] broke out, FitzWilliam, unlike many of the nobility of the Pale, remained loyal to the Crown, despite strong pressure from his mother's family, the Prestons of Gormanston, to join the [[Irish Confederacy]].<ref>Ball, p.13</ref> He was one of  only three nobles to offer their assistance in the [[Royalist]] defence of Dublin, and a garrison was placed in Merrion Castle. It was betrayed in June 1642 and thereafter FitzWilliam only lived there for short periods. He went to London to offer his services to the Crown, but  despite his long record of loyalty to the Crown he was rebuffed, apparently on account of his known leanings towards the Roman Catholic religion,  and he  took no further part in the fighting. In his last years he led an unsettled existence, living  sometimes at Merrion Castle,  sometimes with his eldest son at [[Howth]], and sometimes in [[Louth, County Louth|Louth]]. At times he seems to have been almost destitute, and  he wrote to  [[ James Butler, 1st Duke  of Ormonde]] in 1647 asking for repayment of a [[debt]]. In 1648 he was promised a [[pension]]  of \u00a3100 a year, but it is unclear if he ever received it.<ref>Ball, p.16</ref>\n\nDue perhaps to the confused conditions of the [[ English Civil War]], little seems to be known about the date and place of his death. Even the year has been disputed, but is generally stated to be 1650. He was certainly dead before 1655 when his eldest surviving son Oliver was allowed to inherit a part of the estates, though most of them were not restored until 1663.<ref>Ball, p.18</ref>\n\n==Family==\nIn 1605 he married Margaret Plunkett, daughter of Oliver Plunkett, 4th [[Baron Louth]] and  his wife Frances, who was the daughter of [[Nicholas Bagenal]] and Eleanor Griffith,   and  sister of [[Henry Bagenal]] and of Mabel, Countess of Tyrone.<ref>Cokayne ''Complete Peerage'', p. 527</ref> They had four sons:\n*Richard, who predeceased his father: He married Elizabeth Stanihust but  had no children;\n*[[Oliver FitzWilliam, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell]],  who   was married  three times but had no children;\n*Christopher, who lived mainly in England:  he married Jane Brereton of [[Malpas, Cheshire|Malpas]] (whose sister Dorothy was  his brother Oliver's first wife)  and  had one surviving daughter but no son;\n*[[William FitzWilliam, 3rd Viscount FitzWilliam]], ancestor of  all succeeding Viscounts Fitzwilliam.\n\n==Character==\nHis friend [[James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde]] described him as a man who was  \"in every way faithful to his allegiance\".<ref>Ball, p.13</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fitzwilliam, Thomas Fitzwilliam, 1st Viscount}}\n[[Category:Viscounts in the Peerage of Ireland]]\n[[Category:1581 births]]\n[[Category:1650 deaths]]\n[[Category:16th-century Irish people]]\n[[Category:17th-century Irish people]]\n[[Category:People from Mount Merrion]]\n[[Category:People of Elizabethan Ireland]]\n", "name_user": "Chrisdoyleorwell", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eEarly career", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_FitzWilliam,_1st_Viscount_FitzWilliam"}
