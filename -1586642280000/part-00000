Its main campus, Ciudad Universitaria Rodrigo Facio,  is located in [[San Pedro, Costa Rica|San Pedro Montes de Oca]], in the province of [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]].  It is the oldest and largest institution of higher learning in Costa Rica, originally established as the ''Universidad de Santo Tom\u00e1s'' in 1843. It is also the most important research university in the country and Central America, plus, considered as one of the most prestigious and recognized in Latin America. Approximately 45,000 students attend UCR throughout the year.\n\n==History==\nThe first institution dedicated to higher education in Costa Rica was the ''University of Saint Thomas'' (''Universidad de Santo Tom\u00e1s''), which was established in 1843.  That institution maintained close ties with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and was closed in 1888 by the progressive and [[anti-clerical]] government of President [[Bernardo Soto Alfaro]] as part of a campaign to modernize public education.  The schools of [[law]], [[agronomy]], [[fine arts]], and [[pharmacy]] continued to operate independently.  In 1940, those four schools were re-united to establish the modern UCR, during the reformist administration of President [[Rafael \u00c1ngel Calder\u00f3n Guardia]].\n\nThe UCR remained the country's sole university until the [[Costa Rica Institute of Technology]] (''Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Costa Rica'') and the [[National University of Costa Rica]] (''Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica'') were opened by the government in 1972 and 1973, respectively.  Years later, in 1979, another public university opened: the [[Distance State University]] (''Universidad Estatal a Distancia''), modeled after the British [[Open University]]. Today, Costa Rica has five public universities (the fifth being the newly created National Technical University), and approximately fifty three small private ones, but the UCR remains the largest and most well funded institution.\n\n==Application==\nCosta Rican applicants to the UCR must take an admission test. This test is similar to the [[SAT]] in the United States. The score of this test is used along with the grades from the student's last years in high school to determine the student's admission score, which is later used to determine admission to a specific major and financial aid. 800 is the highest possible score on the admission test and 442 is the minimum score required for admission. Students who score 800 usually appear in the front pages of Costa Rican newspapers.\n\n[[Undergraduate]] Admission is highly selective, having an acceptance rate of approximately 25%. In 2009, out of the 31.042 that completed the admission test, only 16.593 got above the necessary 442 points to be admitted into the university.  However, being admitted to the university doesn't assure admission to a chosen departmental program, or major. In 2007, only 60% of those admitted to the university got accepted into their chosen major.  The remaining 40% have to take classes that may not work for their major, hoping it will lift their grade point average to the level necessary to be admitted to the program of their liking.\n\nInternational applicants must revalidate their high school certificate and grades from their country of origin at the Ministry of Public Education (''Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica'') in order to apply and take the admission test. [[Graduate school]] applicants must revalidate their undergraduate certificate also.\n\n==Campuses and local branches==\n[[Image:Biblioteca-Carlos-Monge-UCR.JPG|thumb|right|[[Carlos Monge]] Library, a library on the main campus in San Pedro.]]\n\nThe main campus is located on a {{convert|100|ha|sing=on|abbr=on}} campus in San Pedro, San Jos\u00e9 ([[Rodrigo Facio]] campus). Other regional campuses are located throughout the country to reach rural Costa Ricans.

Its main campus, Ciudad Universitaria Rodrigo Facio,  is located in [[San Pedro, Costa Rica|San Pedro Montes de Oca]], in the province of [[San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica|San Jos\u00e9]].  It is the oldest and largest institution of higher learning in Costa Rica, originally established as the ''Universidad de Santo Tom\u00e1s'' in 1843. It is also the most important research university in the country and Central America, plus, considered as one of the most prestigious and recognized in Latin America. Approximately 45,000 students attend UCR throughout the year.\n\n==History==\nThe first institution dedicated to higher education in Costa Rica was the ''University of Saint Thomas'' (''Universidad de Santo Tom\u00e1s''), which was established in 1843.  That institution maintained close ties with the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and was closed in 1888 by the progressive and [[anti-clerical]] government of President [[Bernardo Soto Alfaro]] as part of a campaign to modernize public education.  The schools of [[law]], [[agronomy]], [[fine arts]], and [[pharmacy]] continued to operate independently.  In 1940, those four schools were re-united to establish the modern UCR, during the reformist administration of President [[Rafael \u00c1ngel Calder\u00f3n Guardia]].\n\nThe UCR remained the country's sole university until the [[Costa Rica Institute of Technology]] (''Instituto Tecnol\u00f3gico de Costa Rica'') and the [[National University of Costa Rica]] (''Universidad Nacional de Costa Rica'') were opened by the government in 1972 and 1973, respectively.  Years later, in 1979, another public university opened: the [[Distance State University]] (''Universidad Estatal a Distancia''), modeled after the British [[Open University]]. Today, Costa Rica has five public universities (the fifth being the newly created National Technical University), and approximately fifty three small private ones, but the UCR remains the largest and most well funded institution.\n\n==Application==\nCosta Rican applicants to the UCR must take an admission test. This test is similar to the [[SAT]] in the United States. The score of this test is used along with the grades from the student's last years in high school to determine the student's admission score, which is later used to determine admission to a specific major and financial aid. 800 is the highest possible score on the admission test and 442 is the minimum score required for admission. Students who score 800 usually appear in the front pages of Costa Rican newspapers.\n\n[[Undergraduate]] Admission is highly selective, having an acceptance rate of approximately 25%. In 2009, out of the 31.042 that completed the admission test, only 16.593 got above the necessary 442 points to be admitted into the university.  However, being admitted to the university doesn't assure admission to a chosen departmental program, or major. In 2007, only 60% of those admitted to the university got accepted into their chosen major.  The remaining 40% have to take classes that may not work for their major, hoping it will lift their grade point average to the level necessary to be admitted to the program of their liking.\n\nInternational applicants must revalidate their high school certificate and grades from their country of origin at the Ministry of Public Education (''Ministerio de Educaci\u00f3n P\u00fablica'') in order to apply and take the admission test. [[Graduate school]] applicants must revalidate their undergraduate certificate also.\n\n==Campuses and local branches==\n[[Image:Biblioteca-Carlos-Monge-UCR.JPG|thumb|right|[[Carlos Monge]] Library, a library on the main campus in San Pedro.]]\n\nThe main campus is located on a {{convert|100|ha|sing=on|abbr=on}} campus in San Pedro, San Jos\u00e9 ([[Rodrigo Facio]] campus).
