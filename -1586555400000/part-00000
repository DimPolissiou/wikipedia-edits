{"title_page": "List of members of the 1st Parliament of Zimbabwe", "text_new": "This is a list of members of the [[1st Parliament of Zimbabwe]], which began in 1980 and expired in 1985. Per the [[Lancaster House Agreement]], 20 out of the 100 seats in the [[House of Assembly (Zimbabwe)|House of Assembly]] and 10 out of the 40 seats in the [[Senate of Zimbabwe|Senate]] were reserved for [[White people in Zimbabwe|white Zimbabweans]]. The 2nd Parliament's membership was set by the [[1980 Southern Rhodesian general election]], which gave [[ZANU\u2013PF]] a nearly 57 percent majority of common seats in the House of Assembly, with [[Zimbabwe African People's Union|PF\u2013ZAPU]] taking most of the remaining seats. The 20 seats reserved for whites were initially all held by the conservative [[Rhodesian Front]], but a majority later became independents.\n\n== Composition ==\n\n=== Senate ===\n{|

Romanized Jewish historian [[Josephus]] knew them as the nation descended from Magog the [[Japhetites|Japhetite]], as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], and explained them to be the [[Scythians]]. In the hands of Early Christian writers they became apocalyptic hordes, and throughout the Medieval period variously identified as the [[Vikings]], [[Huns]], [[Khazars]], [[Mongols]], [[Ural-Altaic race|Turanians]] or other [[Eurasian nomads|nomads]], or even the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of [[Israelites|Israel]].\n\nThe legend of Gog and Magog and the gates were also interpolated into the [[Alexander romance]]s. In one version, \"Goth and Magothy\" (that means Muralla in Maranaw people) are kings of the Unclean Nations, driven beyond a mountain pass by Alexander, and blocked from returning by his new wall. Gog and Magog are said to engage in [[human cannibalism]] in the romances and derived literature. They have also been depicted on Medieval cosmological maps, or ''[[mappa mundi|mappae mundi]]'', sometimes alongside Alexander's wall.\n\nThe conflation of Gog and Magog with the legend of Alexander and the Iron Gates was disseminated throughout the Near East in the early centuries of the Christian and Islamic era.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=123}} They appear in the [[Quran]] in chapter [[Al-Kahf]] as Yajuj and Majuj ({{Lang-ar|{{Nastaliq|\u064a\u0623\u062c\u0648\u062c \u0648\u0645\u0623\u062c\u0648\u062c}}}}; {{transl|ar|DIN|Ya\u02bej\u016bj wa-Ma\u02bej\u016bj}}), primitive and immoral tribes that were separated and barriered off by [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] (possessor of the Two Horns), who is mentioned in the Qu'ran as a great righteous ruler and conqueror.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=57, fn 3}} Many modern Muslim historians and geographers regarded the [[Vikings]] as the emergence of Gog and Magog.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b4MjAQAAMAAJ&q=vikings+and+gog+and+magog&dq=vikings+and+gog+and+magog&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj40viCj_zkAhWHgVwKHRsQAaoQ6AEINzAC|title=Kings and Vikings: Scandinavia and Europe, A.D. 700-1100|first=P.

Romanized Jewish historian [[Josephus]] knew them as the nation descended from Magog the [[Japhetites|Japhetite]], as in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], and explained them to be the [[Scythians]]. In the hands of Early Christian writers they became apocalyptic hordes, and throughout the Medieval period variously identified as the [[Vikings]], [[Huns]], [[Khazars]], [[Mongols]], [[Ural-Altaic race|Turanians]] or other [[Eurasian nomads|nomads]], or even the [[Ten Lost Tribes]] of [[Israelites|Israel]].\n\nThe legend of Gog and Magog and the gates were also interpolated into the [[Alexander romance]]s. In one version, \"Goth and Magothy\" (that means Muralla in Maranaw people) are kings of the Unclean Nations, driven beyond a mountain pass by Alexander, and blocked from returning by his new wall. Gog and Magog are said to engage in [[human cannibalism]] in the romances and derived literature. They have also been depicted on Medieval cosmological maps, or ''[[mappa mundi|mappae mundi]]'', sometimes alongside Alexander's wall.\n\nThe conflation of Gog and Magog with the legend of Alexander and the Iron Gates was disseminated throughout the Near East in the early centuries of the Christian and Islamic era.{{sfn|Bietenholz|1994|p=123}} They appear in the [[Quran]] in chapter [[Al-Kahf]] as Yajuj and Majuj ({{Lang-ar|{{Nastaliq|\u064a\u0623\u062c\u0648\u062c \u0648\u0645\u0623\u062c\u0648\u062c}}}}; {{transl|ar|DIN|Ya\u02bej\u016bj wa-Ma\u02bej\u016bj}}), primitive and immoral tribes that were separated and barriered off by [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] (possessor of the Two Horns), who is mentioned in the Qu'ran as a great righteous ruler and conqueror.{{sfn|Van Donzel|Schmidt|2010|pp=57, fn 3}} Many modern Muslim historians and geographers regarded the [[Vikings]] as the emergence of Gog and Magog.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=b4MjAQAAMAAJ&q=vikings+and+gog+and+magog&dq=vikings+and+gog+and+magog&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj40viCj_zkAhWHgVwKHRsQAaoQ6AEINzAC|title=Kings and Vikings: Scandinavia and Europe, A.D. 700-1100|first=P.

Various ancient [[Imperial Regalia of Japan|imperial regalia]] are given to the new sovereign during the course of the rite.\n\n==Ceremonies==\nThe Japanese enthronement ceremony consists of three main parts:\n\n===Presentation of the Three Sacred Treasures===\n[[File:\"Inheritance Ceremony of Kenji and others.jpg|thumb|left|Presentation of the sword ''[[Kusanagi]]-no-Tsurugi'' and the ''[[Yasakani no Magatama]]'' at the enthronement of Emperor [[Akihito]], 1989]]\nThe first is the simplest, ''Kenji-t\u014d-Sh\u014dkei-no-gi'' (\u5263\u74bd\u7b49\u627f\u7d99\u306e\u5100), it takes place immediately after the death or abdication of the preceding sovereign. The successor is formally presented with boxes containing two of the three items that compose the [[Imperial Regalia of Japan]]: (1) a replica sword representing the sword ''[[Kusanagi]]-no-Tsurugi'' (lit. \"Grasscutter Sword\") (\u8349\u8599\u528d), though the original is allegedly enshrined at [[Atsuta Shrine]] in [[Nagoya]]; and (2) the ''[[Yasakani no magatama]]'' (\u516b\u5c3a\u74ca\u66f2\u7389), a necklace of [[Magatama|comma-shaped stone beads]]. The third and most important of the items of the regalia is the mirror ''[[Yata no Kagami]]'' (\u516b\u54ab\u93e1), which is enshrined in the [[Ise Grand Shrine]] as the ''[[shintai|go-shintai]]'' (\u5fa1\u795e\u4f53), or the embodiment of the Sun Goddess herself. It is permanently housed in the shrine, and is not presented to the emperor for the enthronement ceremony. Imperial messengers and priests are sent to this shrine, as well as to the tomb-shrines of the four emperors whose reigns immediately preceded his, to inform them of the new emperor's accession.\n\nThe three items of the imperial regalia were originally said to have been given by the Sun goddess, [[Amaterasu]], to her grandson when he first descended to earth and became the founder of the imperial dynasty. Unlike other monarchies, Japan has no crown in its regalia. In the [[2019 Japanese imperial transition|2019 enthronement ceremony]], the treasures were presented to the new emperor in the morning of his ascension date. The visits to the Ise Grand Shrine by Imperial messengers and [[Kannushi|priest]]s, as well as to the tombs of the previous four emperors, continued on as in past enthronements.\n\n===Enthronement===\n[[File:Imperial_throne.jpg|thumb|left|''Takamikura'' used for the Enthronement.]]\n[[File:1990 enthronement banzai banner \u842c\u6b73\u65db.svg|thumb|[[Ten thousand years#Japan|Banzai]] banner used for the enthronement ceremony.]]\n\nThe second part of the ceremony, called ''Sokuirei-Seiden-no-gi'' (\u5373\u4f4d\u793c\u6b63\u6bbf\u306e\u5100), is the enthronement ritual itself; the last such ceremony was held in 2019 for [[Naruhito]]. This ancient rite was traditionally held in [[Kyoto]], the former capital of Japan; beginning in 1990, it is done in [[Tokyo]]. The 1990 enthronement of [[Akihito]] was the first to be covered on television, and have [[Imperial Guard (Japan)#Imperial Guard of the National Police Agency, 1947\u2013present|Imperial Guard]]s in traditional uniforms. It was done indoors, with the elevated stand placed inside the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]] complex. Only part of the ritual is public, and the regalia itself is generally seen only by the emperor and a few [[Shinto]] priests. First came a three-hour ceremony in which the new emperor ritually informed his ancestors that the enthronement is about to take place. This was followed by the enthronement itself, which takes place per tradition in an enclosure called the ''Takamikura'', containing a great square pedestal upholding three octagonal pedestals topped by a simple chair. This was surrounded by an octagonal pavilion with curtains, surmounted by a great golden [[Fenghuang|Phoenix]].<ref name=\"time2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,928214-1,00.html |title=Emperor Enthroned&nbsp;\u2013 TIME |publisher=Time.com |author=|date=November 19, 1928 |accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref> At the same time, the empress, in full dress regalia, moved to a smaller adjacent throne beside her husband's. Traditional drums were, at this point of the ceremony, beaten to start the proceedings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Japan emperor to announce enthronement in ancient-style ceremony |url=https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20191022/p2g/00m/0na/014000c |website=Mainichi Daily News |language=en |date=22 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe new emperor proceeded to the chair, where after being seated, the ''Kusanagi'', ''Yasakani no Magatama'', [[Privy Seal of Japan|privy seal]] and [[State Seal of Japan|state seal]] were placed on stands next to him. A simple wooden [[Shaku (ritual baton)|sceptre]] was presented to the emperor, who faced his [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime minister]] standing in an adjacent courtyard, representing the Japanese people. The emperor offered an address announcing his accession to the throne, calling upon his subjects to single-mindedly assist him in attaining all of his aspirations. His prime minister replied with an address promising fidelity and devotion, followed by a \"[[Ten thousand years#Japan|three cheers of Banzai]]\" from all of those present. The timing of this last event was precisely synchronized, so that Japanese around the world could join in the \"Banzai\" shout at precisely the moment that it was being offered in Kyoto or in Tokyo.<ref name=\"time2\"/>\n\nThis moment of the rite ends with the firing of a [[21-gun salute]] by the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]]. After this, both seals and the two regalia items are carried off the imperial pavilion.\n\nFollowing this, the emperor and empress, now back to wearing civilian mess dress, are then both driven all over Tokyo via the Imperial automobile convoy to acknowledge the cheers of the people of the capital and tourists assembled on the major streets. On the way the emperor receives his first salute as head of state by police personnel of the Imperial Guard and the 302nd JGSDF Security Company of the Eastern Army, the JSDF's official guard of honour formation, and then by a joint service guard of honour battalion of guardsmen from the headquarters units of the JSDF's three service branches, which present arms and salute on the eyes left. In the past, in his former role as commander-in-chief, he received the salutes of the Imperial Guard formations and assembled formations of both the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] either during the motorcade or while mounted on horseback.\n\n===The Daij\u014d-sai===\n[[File:Emperor Akihito Daij\u014dsai(1990).jpg|thumb|The Daij\u014d-sai of Emperor Akihito in 1990]]\nThe ''Daij\u014d-sai'' (\u5927\u5617\u796d), the first [[Niiname-no-Matsuri|Niiname-sai]] (\u65b0\u5617\u796d) or the Great Thanksgiving Festival, is the third and most important of the [[inauguration]] rituals, because it is the one in which the emperor is united to the sun-goddess Amaterasu, in such a way as to share in a unique way in her [[divinity]]. \n\nFirst, two special [[rice paddies]] are chosen and purified by elaborate [[Shinto]] purification rites. The families of the farmers who are to cultivate the rice in these paddies must be in perfect health. Once the rice is grown and harvested, it is stored in a special Shinto shrine as its ''go-shintai'' (\u5fa1\u795e\u4f53), the embodiment of a [[kami]] or divine force. Each kernel must be whole and unbroken, and is individually polished before it is boiled. Some [[sake]] is also brewed from this rice. The two sets of rice seedlings now blessed each come from the western and eastern prefectures of Japan, and the chosen rice from these is assigned from a designated prefecture each in the west and east of the country, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, two [[thatched roof]] two-room [[hut (dwelling)|hut]]s are built within a corresponding special enclosure, using a native Japanese building style that predates and is thus devoid of all [[Culture of China|Chinese]] cultural influence. One room contains a large [[couch]] at its center; the second is used by musicians. All furniture and household items also preserve these earliest, and thus most purely Japanese forms: e.g., all [[pottery]] objects are fired but unglazed. These two structures represent the house of the preceding emperor and that of the new emperor. In earlier times, when the head of a household died his house was burned; before the founding of [[Kyoto]], whenever an emperor died his entire capital city was burned as a rite of purification. As in the earlier ceremony, the two houses represent housing styles from western and eastern parts of Japan. Since 1990, the temporary enclosure is located at the eastern grounds of the Imperial Palace complex.\n\n[[File:Igimono1.JPG|thumb|Ritual items from the enthronement of the Japanese emperor]]\n\nAfter a ritual [[bathing|bath]], the emperor is dressed entirely in the white silk dress of a Shinto priest, but with a special long train. Surrounded by [[courtier]]s (some of them carrying torches), the emperor solemnly enters first the enclosure and then each of these huts in turn and performs the same ritual\u2014from 6:30 to 9:30 PM in the first, and in the second from 12:30 to 3:30 AM on the same night. A [[mat]] is unrolled before him and then rolled up again as he walks, so that his feet never touch the ground. A special [[umbrella]] is held over the sovereign's head, in which the shade hangs from a phoenix carved at the end of the pole and prevents any defilement of his sacred person coming from the air above him. Kneeling on a [[mat]] situated to face the [[Grand Shrine of Ise]], as the traditional [[gagaku]] court music is played by the court orchestra the emperor makes an offering of the sacred rice, the sake made from this rice, [[millet]], fish and a variety of other foods from both the land and the sea, to Amaterasu. Then he eats some of this sacred rice himself, as an act of divine communion that consummates his singular unity with Amaterasu-\u014dmikami, thus making him (in Shinto tradition) the [[intermediary]] between Amaterasu and the Japanese people.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-23/news/mn-5212_1_sun-goddess | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Karl | last=Schoenberger | date=November 23, 1990 | accessdate=2010-05-02 | title=Akihito in Final Ritual of Passage}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/23/world/akihito-performs-his-solitary-rite.html | work=The New York Times | title=Akihito Performs His Solitary Rite | first=Steven R. | last=Weisman | date=November 23, 1990 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> This is followed by three banquets and a visit to the shrines of his ancestors.<ref name=\"time2\"/>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Enthronement Ceremony of Emperor K\u014dmei.png|[[Emperor K\u014dmei]]\nFile:Kone.jpg\nFile:Benkan_emperor_komei.jpg\nFile:Sokutai-Kurohou for male attendants.JPG\nFile:Ceremony of Enthronement1.jpg\nFile:\u5a01\u5100\u306e\u8005(Military officer).png\nFile:\u885b\u9580(gatekeeper).png\nFile:Sokutai-Akehou for the bearers of ceremonial items.JPG\nFile:Sokutai-Hanadahou for the bearers of ceremonial items.JPG\nFile:\u5341\u4e8c\u5358\u3067\u3059.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*[[Robert S.

Various ancient [[Imperial Regalia of Japan|imperial regalia]] are given to the new sovereign during the course of the rite.\n\n==Ceremonies==\nThe Japanese enthronement ceremony consists of three main parts:\n\n===Presentation of the Three Sacred Treasures===\n[[File:\"Inheritance Ceremony of Kenji and others.jpg|thumb|left|Presentation of the sword ''[[Kusanagi]]-no-Tsurugi'' and the ''[[Yasakani no Magatama]]'' at the enthronement of Emperor [[Akihito]], 1989]]\nThe first is the simplest, ''Kenji-t\u014d-Sh\u014dkei-no-gi'' (\u5263\u74bd\u7b49\u627f\u7d99\u306e\u5100), it takes place immediately after the death or abdication of the preceding sovereign. The successor is formally presented with boxes containing two of the three items that compose the [[Imperial Regalia of Japan]]: (1) a replica sword representing the sword ''[[Kusanagi]]-no-Tsurugi'' (lit. \"Grasscutter Sword\") (\u8349\u8599\u528d), though the original is allegedly enshrined at [[Atsuta Shrine]] in [[Nagoya]]; and (2) the ''[[Yasakani no magatama]]'' (\u516b\u5c3a\u74ca\u66f2\u7389), a necklace of [[Magatama|comma-shaped stone beads]]. The third and most important of the items of the regalia is the mirror ''[[Yata no Kagami]]'' (\u516b\u54ab\u93e1), which is enshrined in the [[Ise Grand Shrine]] as the ''[[shintai|go-shintai]]'' (\u5fa1\u795e\u4f53), or the embodiment of the Sun Goddess herself. It is permanently housed in the shrine, and is not presented to the emperor for the enthronement ceremony. Imperial messengers and priests are sent to this shrine, as well as to the tomb-shrines of the four emperors whose reigns immediately preceded his, to inform them of the new emperor's accession.\n\nThe three items of the imperial regalia were originally said to have been given by the Sun goddess, [[Amaterasu]], to her grandson when he first descended to earth and became the founder of the imperial dynasty. Unlike other monarchies, Japan has no crown in its regalia. In the [[2019 Japanese imperial transition|2019 enthronement ceremony]], the treasures were presented to the new emperor in the morning of his ascension date. The visits to the Ise Grand Shrine by Imperial messengers and [[Kannushi|priest]]s, as well as to the tombs of the previous four emperors, continued on as in past enthronements.\n\n===Enthronement===\n[[File:Imperial_throne.jpg|thumb|left|''Takamikura'' used for the Enthronement.]]\n[[File:1990 enthronement banzai banner \u842c\u6b73\u65db.svg|thumb|[[Ten thousand years#Japan|Banzai]] banner used for the enthronement ceremony.]]\n\nThe second part of the ceremony, called ''Sokuirei-Seiden-no-gi'' (\u5373\u4f4d\u793c\u6b63\u6bbf\u306e\u5100), is the enthronement ritual itself; the last such ceremony was held in 2019 for [[Naruhito]]. This ancient rite was traditionally held in [[Kyoto]], the former capital of Japan; beginning in 1990, it is done in [[Tokyo]]. The 1990 enthronement of [[Akihito]] was the first to be covered on television, and have [[Imperial Guard (Japan)#Imperial Guard of the National Police Agency, 1947\u2013present|Imperial Guard]]s in traditional uniforms. It was done indoors, with the elevated stand placed inside the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]] complex. Only part of the ritual is public, and the regalia itself is generally seen only by the emperor and a few [[Shinto]] priests. First came a three-hour ceremony in which the new emperor ritually informed his ancestors that the enthronement is about to take place. This was followed by the enthronement itself, which takes place per tradition in an enclosure called the ''Takamikura'', containing a great square pedestal upholding three octagonal pedestals topped by a simple chair. This was surrounded by an octagonal pavilion with curtains, surmounted by a great golden [[Fenghuang|Phoenix]].<ref name=\"time2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,928214-1,00.html |title=Emperor Enthroned&nbsp;\u2013 TIME |publisher=Time.com |author=|date=November 19, 1928 |accessdate=2008-10-12}}</ref> At the same time, the empress, in full dress regalia, moved to a smaller adjacent throne beside her husband's. Traditional drums were, at this point of the ceremony, beaten to start the proceedings.<ref>{{cite web |title=Japan emperor to announce enthronement in ancient-style ceremony |url=https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20191022/p2g/00m/0na/014000c |website=Mainichi Daily News |language=en |date=22 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe new emperor proceeded to the chair, where after being seated, the ''Kusanagi'', ''Yasakani no Magatama'', [[Privy Seal of Japan|privy seal]] and [[State Seal of Japan|state seal]] were placed on stands next to him. A simple wooden [[Shaku (ritual baton)|sceptre]] was presented to the emperor, who faced his [[Prime Minister of Japan|prime minister]] standing in an adjacent courtyard, representing the Japanese people. The emperor offered an address announcing his accession to the throne, calling upon his subjects to single-mindedly assist him in attaining all of his aspirations. His prime minister replied with an address promising fidelity and devotion, followed by a \"[[Ten thousand years#Japan|three cheers of Banzai]]\" from all of those present. The timing of this last event was precisely synchronized, so that Japanese around the world could join in the \"Banzai\" shout at precisely the moment that it was being offered in Kyoto or in Tokyo.<ref name=\"time2\"/>\n\nThis moment of the rite ends with the firing of a [[21-gun salute]] by the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]]. After this, both seals and the two regalia items are carried off the imperial pavilion.\n\nFollowing this, the emperor and empress, now back to wearing civilian mess dress, are then both driven all over Tokyo via the Imperial automobile convoy to acknowledge the cheers of the people of the capital and tourists assembled on the major streets. On the way the emperor receives his first salute as head of state by police personnel of the Imperial Guard and the 302nd JGSDF Security Company of the Eastern Army, the JSDF's official guard of honour formation, and then by a joint service guard of honour battalion of guardsmen from the headquarters units of the JSDF's three service branches, which present arms and salute on the eyes left. In the past, in his former role as commander-in-chief, he received the salutes of the Imperial Guard formations and assembled formations of both the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] and the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] either during the motorcade or while mounted on horseback.\n\n===The Daij\u014d-sai===\n[[File:Emperor Akihito Daij\u014dsai(1990).jpg|thumb|The Daij\u014d-sai of Emperor Akihito in 1990]]\nThe ''Daij\u014d-sai'' (\u5927\u5617\u796d), the first [[Niiname-no-Matsuri|Niiname-sai]] (\u65b0\u5617\u796d) or the Great Thanksgiving Festival, is the third and most important of the [[inauguration]] rituals, because it is the one in which the emperor is united to the sun-goddess Amaterasu, in such a way as to share in a unique way in her [[divinity]]. \n\nFirst, two special [[rice paddies]] are chosen and purified by elaborate [[Shinto]] purification rites. The families of the farmers who are to cultivate the rice in these paddies must be in perfect health. Once the rice is grown and harvested, it is stored in a special Shinto shrine as its ''go-shintai'' (\u5fa1\u795e\u4f53), the embodiment of a [[kami]] or divine force. Each kernel must be whole and unbroken, and is individually polished before it is boiled. Some [[sake]] is also brewed from this rice. The two sets of rice seedlings now blessed each come from the western and eastern prefectures of Japan, and the chosen rice from these is assigned from a designated prefecture each in the west and east of the country, respectively.\n\nMeanwhile, two [[thatched roof]] two-room [[hut (dwelling)|hut]]s are built within a corresponding special enclosure, using a native Japanese building style that predates and is thus devoid of all [[Culture of China|Chinese]] cultural influence. One room contains a large [[couch]] at its center; the second is used by musicians. All furniture and household items also preserve these earliest, and thus most purely Japanese forms: e.g., all [[pottery]] objects are fired but unglazed. These two structures represent the house of the preceding emperor and that of the new emperor. In earlier times, when the head of a household died his house was burned; before the founding of [[Kyoto]], whenever an emperor died his entire capital city was burned as a rite of purification. As in the earlier ceremony, the two houses represent housing styles from western and eastern parts of Japan. Since 1990, the temporary enclosure is located at the eastern grounds of the Imperial Palace complex.\n\n[[File:Igimono1.JPG|thumb|Ritual items from the enthronement of the Japanese emperor]]\n\nAfter a ritual [[bathing|bath]], the emperor is dressed entirely in the white silk dress of a Shinto priest, but with a special long train. Surrounded by [[courtier]]s (some of them carrying torches), the emperor solemnly enters first the enclosure and then each of these huts in turn and performs the same ritual\u2014from 6:30 to 9:30 PM in the first, and in the second from 12:30 to 3:30 AM on the same night. A [[mat]] is unrolled before him and then rolled up again as he walks, so that his feet never touch the ground. A special [[umbrella]] is held over the sovereign's head, in which the shade hangs from a phoenix carved at the end of the pole and prevents any defilement of his sacred person coming from the air above him. Kneeling on a [[mat]] situated to face the [[Grand Shrine of Ise]], as the traditional [[gagaku]] court music is played by the court orchestra the emperor makes an offering of the sacred rice, the sake made from this rice, [[millet]], fish and a variety of other foods from both the land and the sea, to Amaterasu. Then he eats some of this sacred rice himself, as an act of divine communion that consummates his singular unity with Amaterasu-\u014dmikami, thus making him (in Shinto tradition) the [[intermediary]] between Amaterasu and the Japanese people.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-23/news/mn-5212_1_sun-goddess | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Karl | last=Schoenberger | date=November 23, 1990 | accessdate=2010-05-02 | title=Akihito in Final Ritual of Passage}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/23/world/akihito-performs-his-solitary-rite.html | work=The New York Times | title=Akihito Performs His Solitary Rite | first=Steven R. | last=Weisman | date=November 23, 1990 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}</ref> This is followed by three banquets and a visit to the shrines of his ancestors.<ref name=\"time2\"/>\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Enthronement Ceremony of Emperor K\u014dmei.png|[[Emperor K\u014dmei]]\nFile:Kone.jpg\nFile:Benkan_emperor_komei.jpg\nFile:Sokutai-Kurohou for male attendants.JPG\nFile:Ceremony of Enthronement1.jpg\nFile:\u5a01\u5100\u306e\u8005(Military officer).png\nFile:\u885b\u9580(gatekeeper).png\nFile:Sokutai-Akehou for the bearers of ceremonial items.JPG\nFile:Sokutai-Hanadahou for the bearers of ceremonial items.JPG\nFile:\u5341\u4e8c\u5358\u3067\u3059.JPG\n</gallery>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n*[[Robert S.
