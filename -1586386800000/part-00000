Their travels enable them to meet famous Filipino heroes like [[Jose Rizal]], [[Andres Bonifacio]], [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], [[Apolinario Mabini]], [[Emilio Jacinto]], [[Melchora Aquino]], [[Antonio Luna]], [[Gabriela Silang]], [[Teresa Magbanua]], [[Josefa Llanes Escoda]], [[Gomburza|GOMBURZA]], [[Graciano Lopez Jaena]], [[Gregorio del Pilar]], [[Francisco Balagtas]], [[Le\u00f3n Kilat]], [[Marcelo H. Del Pilar]] and many others.\n\nThe first episode of the show had Noli and Ana hiding in a cave in the mountains while fleeing from a gang of bullies. In the cave, an elderly man ([[Rolando Tinio]]) meets them and presents himself as the guardian of the cave which holds the memories of Philippine history and the spirit of the country. He then reveals that Noli and Ana were destined to discover the mysterious cave and are chosen ones of pure heart to access a heavy book known as ''\"Aklat ng Kasaysayan\"'' (Book of History). The Guardian then sends them on a magical adventure through time to retrieve various lost and stolen historical items from different time periods. At the end of each travel, the two schoolchildren return with the artifacts and presents them to the guardian, who later becomes a grandfather figure to the children.\n\nThroughout the series, the main setting for the beginning and ending of each episodes is a cave and elderly person is a male. An elderly woman appeared in the next few episodes and also becomes a grandmother figure to the children. After Tinio's death in 1997, the elderly woman becomes a mainstay guardian to the children who regularly visit the cave and also becomes the cave's secret holder. The Book of History is retained.\n\nIn the later episodes, the cave setting has been changed to a different setting although the Book of History is still retained. The Rhona Mahilum episode is an example of this change; the show begins in a forest where Noli and Ana camp while the adult guardian is an aunt of theirs and the ending is set in the hospital where the episode's title character is admitted.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main characters===\n* Angelo Cometa as Noli - the male lead of the series. Cometa played the character which was later cut off after he outgrew his role and aged out of middle school age.\n* Various actresses as Ana - Noli's friend and female lead of the series.

The character replaced Tinio's character after Tinio died in 1997.\n* Malou De Guzman as Tita - the aunt of Ana and Noli.\n* Mark Guayco as Rolan - the new male lead of the series who replaced Noli ''(after he was deemed outgrown of elementary school age)'' and is first introduced in the \"Fely Tatlonghari\" episode. \n* Claudine Alejandro as Lisa - Rolan's friend and the new female lead of the series in \"Fely Tatlonghari\" episode.

She has also appeared on other reality shows such as ''[[The Surreal Life]]'', ''[[Kill Reality]]'', ''[[Punk'd]]'' and ''[[Fear Factor]]''. She has also made appearances in TV ads and music videos, posed nude in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, appeared in the horror film ''[[The Scorned]]'', and competed successfully in celebrity poker tournaments.<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/person/461964/Trishelle-Canatella \"Trishelle-Canatella\"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved February 10, 2014.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nCannatella was born on November 4, 1979, and raised in [[Cut Off, Louisiana]]. She is of French and Italian ancestry. She was raised as a [[Southern Baptist]], and has described herself as a \"momma's girl\". Her mother, a devout Christian, took her family to church three or four times a week. When she was 14, her mother died from a [[brain tumor]]. Cannatella was on several athletic teams throughout her high school career at [[South Lafourche High School]]. After visiting her sister Buffy at the [[University of Southern Mississippi]], Cannatella decided on that college, which she began attending at age 17, though she never finished.\n\n==Career==\n\n===''The Real World'' and ''The Challenge''===\nSullen about the impending need to pay back her student loans as her graduation neared in 2002, Cannatella heard a radio ad for a show called ''Lost in the U.S.A.'', which offered a $50,000 prize, and would be co-produced by [[Bunim-Murray Productions]] and air on [[The WB]]. The show was axed during the auditions, and she was invited to audition for Bunim-Murray's [[The Real World: Las Vegas|twelfth season]] of the long-running reality show ''[[The Real World]]'', which was set in Las Vegas and would later air in 2002-2003. She accepted, but perceived the questions she was asked during the audition process to be part of an attempt by the producers to cast her as the stereotypical racist and homophobic southern cast member, and later, in light of the questions they asked about her religion, as the \"holy roller\". Cannatella was selected as a cast member. During her stay, she and her roommates worked in the hotel and clubs. Cannatella and her fellow castmates felt pressure from the producers to act out for the cameras in order to make appealing airtime, saying that she was asked leading questions by the producers about her plans on certain nights. She also notes that alcohol was made readily available to the cast, which she pointed out in light of the fact that [[alcoholism]] runs in her family.<ref name=THS>''[[The E! True Hollywood Story]]: Bad Girls of Reality TV''. [[E!]]. January 3, 2008.</ref>\n\nDuring the season of ''[[Road Rules: Campus Crawl]]'', which was filmed at the same time as ''The Real World: Las Vegas'', the cast members from the two shows faced off against each other in a series of challenges.\n\nIn 2003, Cannatella was also a member of the Real World team during the ''[[Real World/Road Rules Challenge: The Gauntlet]]'', but was sent home when she lost a gauntlet to Sarah Greyson. She also competed in the succeeding season, ''[[Real World/Road Rules Challenge: The Inferno|The Inferno]]'', but was eliminated second. In May 2007, she appeared on the reunion show, ''[[Reunited: The Real World Las Vegas]]''.\n\nIn 2012, she returned to the Challenge and competed with former ''Real World'' housemate, Alton Williams, [[The Real World: Las Vegas (2011)|''The Real World: Las Vegas'' (2011)]] alums Dustin Zito and Nany Gonz\u00e1lez in ''[[The Challenge: Battle of the Seasons]]''; she and Zito finished the season in second place after Williams and Gonzalez were eliminated earlier in the season.\n\nThe next year, Cannatella returned for another ''Challenge'' season titled ''[[The Challenge: Rivals II|Rivals II]]'', where she was placed in a team with fellow contestant Sarah Rice (''The Real World: Brooklyn'') from whom she had conflict with in ''Battle of the Seasons''. In Episode 3, Cannatella quit the game after she got into an argument with Aneesa Ferreira, and became intolerant of the conditions in the house. Rice was sent home by default because she was left without a partner.\n\n===Other television work===\nIn 2005, Cannatella was a part of the reality show ''[[Kill Reality]]'' which chronicled the making of the movie ''[[The Scorned]]''. She has also appeared in an episode of the reality show that pranks celebrities, ''[[Punk'd]]'', hosted by [[Ashton Kutcher]].<ref name=IMDb/>\n\nCannatella appeared on ''[[Fear Factor]]'' in a special reality themed episode in 2006.<ref name=IMDb/> Her partner was ex-boyfriend [[The Miz|Mike Mizanin]]. The two competed against other teams of former reality contestants including [[Jonny Fairplay]] and [[Victoria Fuller]]. In the end, Cannatella and Mizanin won the show, taking home the prize money and several other prizes.\n\nCannatella appeared in the [[USA Network]] reality series ''[[Dr. Steve-O]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/10/01/trishelle_talks_about_new_show_dr_steve_|title= Trishelle Talks About New Show 'Dr. Steve-O,' Wearing A Bee-Kini & Why She's A Badass|publisher=Starpulse|date=October 1, 2007}}</ref> She was the first cast member signed to the [[CMT (U.S. TV channel)|CMT]] show ''[[Hulk Hogan's Celebrity Championship Wrestling]]''.

She has also appeared on other reality shows such as ''[[The Surreal Life]]'', ''[[Kill Reality]]'', ''[[Punk'd]]'' and ''[[Fear Factor]]''. She has also made appearances in TV ads and music videos, posed nude in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, appeared in the horror film ''[[The Scorned]]'', and competed successfully in celebrity poker tournaments.<ref>[http://movies.nytimes.com/person/461964/Trishelle-Canatella \"Trishelle-Canatella\"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved February 10, 2014.</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nCannatella was born on November 4, 1979, and raised in [[Cut Off, Louisiana]]. She is of French and Italian ancestry. She was raised as a [[Southern Baptist]], and has described herself as a \"momma's girl\". Her mother, a devout Christian, took her family to church three or four times a week. When she was 14, her mother died from a [[brain tumor]]. Cannatella was on several athletic teams throughout her high school career at [[South Lafourche High School]]. After visiting her sister Buffy at the [[University of Southern Mississippi]], Cannatella decided on that college, which she began attending at age 17, though she never finished.\n\n==Career==\n\n===''The Real World'' and ''The Challenge''===\nSullen about the impending need to pay back her student loans as her graduation neared in 2002, Cannatella heard a radio ad for a show called ''Lost in the U.S.A.'', which offered a $50,000 prize, and would be co-produced by [[Bunim-Murray Productions]] and air on [[The WB]]. The show was axed during the auditions, and she was invited to audition for Bunim-Murray's [[The Real World: Las Vegas|twelfth season]] of the long-running reality show ''[[The Real World]]'', which was set in Las Vegas and would later air in 2002-2003. She accepted, but perceived the questions she was asked during the audition process to be part of an attempt by the producers to cast her as the stereotypical racist and homophobic southern cast member, and later, in light of the questions they asked about her religion, as the \"holy roller\". Cannatella was selected as a cast member. During her stay, she and her roommates worked in the hotel and clubs. Cannatella and her fellow castmates felt pressure from the producers to act out for the cameras in order to make appealing airtime, saying that she was asked leading questions by the producers about her plans on certain nights. She also notes that alcohol was made readily available to the cast, which she pointed out in light of the fact that [[alcoholism]] runs in her family.<ref name=THS>''[[The E! True Hollywood Story]]: Bad Girls of Reality TV''. [[E!]]. January 3, 2008.</ref>\n\nDuring the season of ''[[Road Rules: Campus Crawl]]'', which was filmed at the same time as ''The Real World: Las Vegas'', the cast members from the two shows faced off against each other in a series of challenges.\n\nIn 2003, Cannatella was also a member of the Real World team during the ''[[Real World/Road Rules Challenge: The Gauntlet]]'', but was sent home when she lost a gauntlet to Sarah Greyson. She also competed in the succeeding season, ''[[Real World/Road Rules Challenge: The Inferno|The Inferno]]'', but was eliminated second. In May 2007, she appeared on the reunion show, ''[[Reunited: The Real World Las Vegas]]''.\n\nIn 2012, she returned to the Challenge and competed with former ''Real World'' housemate, Alton Williams, [[The Real World: Las Vegas (2011)|''The Real World: Las Vegas'' (2011)]] alums Dustin Zito and Nany Gonz\u00e1lez in ''[[The Challenge: Battle of the Seasons]]''; she and Zito finished the season in second place after Williams and Gonzalez were eliminated earlier in the season.\n\nThe next year, Cannatella returned for another ''Challenge'' season titled ''[[The Challenge: Rivals II|Rivals II]]'', where she was placed in a team with fellow contestant Sarah Rice (''The Real World: Brooklyn'') from whom she had conflict with in ''Battle of the Seasons''. In Episode 3, Cannatella quit the game after she got into an argument with Aneesa Ferreira, and became intolerant of the conditions in the house. Rice was sent home by default because she was left without a partner.\n\n===Other television work===\nIn 2005, Cannatella was a part of the reality show ''[[Kill Reality]]'' which chronicled the making of the movie ''[[The Scorned]]''. She has also appeared in an episode of the reality show that pranks celebrities, ''[[Punk'd]]'', hosted by [[Ashton Kutcher]].<ref name=IMDb/>\n\nCannatella appeared on ''[[Fear Factor]]'' in a special reality themed episode in 2006.<ref name=IMDb/> Her partner was ex-boyfriend [[The Miz|Mike Mizanin]]. The two competed against other teams of former reality contestants including [[Jonny Fairplay]] and [[Victoria Fuller]].

Early principal activities were farming, salt works, shipping, whaling, and [[sheep husbandry]], which was very popular due to the introduction of [[Merino]] sheep and the beginnings of water-powered mills that could process the wool. In 1837, Falmouth averaged about 50 sheep per square mile.\n\nFalmouth saw brief action in the [[War of 1812]], when the area around Falmouth Heights, on its southern coast, was bombarded by several British [[frigate]]s and [[ships of the line]], and [[Massachusetts militia]] hastily entrenched themselves on the beaches to repulse a possible British landing which never came. By 1872, the train had come to Falmouth and Woods Hole, and some of the first summer homes were established. By the late 19th century, [[cranberry|cranberries]] were being cultivated and [[strawberries]] were being raised for the Boston market. Large-scale dairying was tried in the early 20th century in interior regions. After the improvement in highways, and thanks in part to the heavy use of neighboring [[Camp Edwards]] (now part of [[Joint Base Cape Cod]]) during World War II, population growth increased significantly. Large homebuilding booms occurred in the 1970s, followed by others in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn the late 1800s, after railroad service was established between Boston and Cape Cod, James Madison Beebe bought over {{convert|700|acre}} and built Highfield Hall, which is now a museum, and much of the land is preserved as Beebe Woods. In 1965, [[Robert Manry]] sailed from Falmouth aboard his {{convert|13.5|ft|adj=on}} sailboat and reached Falmouth, England, 78 days later.\n\n===Historic districts===\nThe town of Falmouth has seven historic districts, including four on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]:\n*[[Falmouth Village Green Historic District|Falmouth Village Green]]\n*[[North Falmouth Village Historic District|North Falmouth Village]]\n*[[Waquoit Historic District|Waquoit]]\n*[[West Falmouth Village Historic District|West Falmouth Village]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.falmouthmass.us/history/register.pdf |title=Town of Falmouth, Historical Commission |access-date=2012-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802232830/http://www.falmouthmass.us/history/register.pdf |archive-date=2014-08-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nThe other three historic districts are in Woods Hole, Davisville, and Quissett.\n\nIn addition to the historic districts, Falmouth has ten individual sites on the National Register:\n*[[Central Fire Station (Falmouth, Massachusetts)|Central Fire Station]] \n*[[Crowell-Bourne Farm]]\n*[[Elnathan Nye House]]\n*[[Falmouth Pumping Station]]\n*[[Josiah Tobey House]]\n*[[Lawrence Academy (Falmouth, Massachusetts)|Lawrence Academy]]\n*[[Nobska Light]]\n*[[Poor House and Methodist Cemetery]]\n*[[Teaticket School]]\n*[[Woods Hole School]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.falmouthmass.us/depart.php?depkey=hdc |title=Town of Falmouth, Historic Districts Commission |access-date=2012-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116093144/http://www.falmouthmass.us/depart.php?depkey=hdc |archive-date=2012-01-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOffshore Falmouth in [[Buzzards Bay]], [[Cleveland East Ledge Light]] is listed with the National Register.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Falmouth - Woods Hole 1.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Juniper Point, the eastern point of Woods Hole in Falmouth]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|141.0|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|114.1|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|26.8|km2|order=flip}}, or 19.04%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> Most of Falmouth, like the rest of Cape Cod, sits on glacial sands composed of glacial [[outwash]] deposits. However, the soil in the southwestern part of the town, consisting of [[moraine]] deposits, is more rocky and dense, like the rest of [[New England]], and many [[glacial erratic]]s are scattered about, having been dropped by the retreating glaciers. The climate is temperate marine. There is no exposed bedrock. Rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year and averages 2 to 3 in (50 \u2013 75&nbsp;mm) per month.\n\nFalmouth lies on the southwestern tip of Cape Cod. It is bordered by [[Bourne, Massachusetts|Bourne]] and [[Sandwich, Massachusetts|Sandwich]] to the north, [[Mashpee, Massachusetts|Mashpee]] to the east, [[Vineyard Sound]] to the south, and [[Buzzards Bay]] to the west. At its closest point, Falmouth is approximately {{convert|560|yd|m}} from [[Nonamesset Island]], the easternmost island of the town of [[Gosnold, Massachusetts|Gosnold]] and the [[Elizabeth Islands]]. It is approximately {{convert|3+1/3|mi}} north-northwest of [[Martha's Vineyard]], the closest land to the island. Falmouth is approximately {{convert|14|mi}} south of the [[Bourne Bridge]], {{convert|22|mi}} west of [[Barnstable, Massachusetts|Barnstable]], and {{convert|77|mi}} south-southeast of [[Boston]].\n\nFalmouth's topography is similar to the rest of Cape Cod's, with many small ponds, creeks, and [[inlet]]s surrounded by the [[pine]]s and [[oak]]s of the Cape and often rocky beachfront. Falmouth's southern shore is notable for a series of ponds and rivers spaced very closely together, all of which travel some distance into the town. These include, from west to east, Falmouth Inner Harbor, Little Pond, Great Pond (which leads to the Dexter and [[Coonamesset River|Coonamesset]] rivers), Green Pond, Bourne's Pond, Eel Pond (which leads to the [[Childs River]]), and [[Waquoit Bay]], which lies along the Mashpee town line. The Buzzards Bay side of the town is primarily [[bay]]s divided by necks, peninsulas connected to land by [[isthmus|isthmi]]. The largest inlet is Megansett Cove along the Bourne town line. The Buzzards Bay shore of Falmouth is punctuated by a number of hamlets, including, from north to south, Megansett, [[New Silver Beach]], Old Silver, Chappaquoit, Sippewisset, Quissett, and [[Woods Hole]].\n\n==Climate==\n\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, Falmouth, Massachusetts has a warm-summer, wet all year, [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb''). Dfb climates are characterized by at least one month having an average mean temperature \u2264 32.0&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u2264 0.0&nbsp;\u00b0C), at least four months with an average mean temperature \u2265 50.0&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u2265 10.0&nbsp;\u00b0C), all months with an average mean temperature \u2264 71.6&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u2264 22.0&nbsp;\u00b0C), and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. The average seasonal (Nov-Apr) snowfall total is around 30 in (76&nbsp;cm). The average snowiest month is February which corresponds with the annual peak in [[nor'easter]] activity. According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], the [[plant hardiness zone]] is 7a with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 1.3&nbsp;\u00b0F (-17.1&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name=\"USDA\">{{cite web|url=https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/InteractiveMap.aspx|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=2019-06-28|title=USDA Interactive Plant Hardiness Map}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box |width=auto\t\n|location = Falmouth, Barnstable County, Massachusetts (1981 \u2013 2010 averages)\n|single line = Y\t\n|Jan high F =\t38.1\n|Feb high F =\t39.8\n|Mar high F =\t45.2\n|Apr high F =\t54.2\n|May high F =\t63.4\n|Jun high F =\t72.6\n|Jul high F =\t78.5\n|Aug high F =\t78.1\n|Sep high F =\t72.0\n|Oct high F =\t62.3\n|Nov high F =\t53.4\n|Dec high F =\t43.7\n|year high F=\t58.5\n| Jan mean F =\t30.5\n| Feb mean F =\t32.2\n| Mar mean F =\t37.7\n| Apr mean F =\t46.3\n| May mean F =\t55.5\n| Jun mean F =\t65.1\n| Jul mean F =\t71.2\n| Aug mean F =\t70.7\n| Sep mean F =\t64.1\n| Oct mean F =\t54.2\n| Nov mean F =\t45.7\n| Dec mean F =\t36.2\n| year mean F =\t50.9\n|Jan low F =\t21.0\n|Feb low F =\t22.9\n|Mar low F =\t28.9\n|Apr low F =\t37.7\n|May low F =\t47.0\n|Jun low F =\t57.0\n|Jul low F =\t63.4\n|Aug low F =\t62.6\n|Sep low F =\t55.3\n|Oct low F =\t44.7\n|Nov low F =\t36.2\n|Dec low F =\t26.8\n|year low F=\t42.1\n|precipitation colour = green\t\n|Jan precipitation inch =\t4.11\n|Feb precipitation inch =\t3.57\n|Mar precipitation inch =\t5.20\n|Apr precipitation inch =\t4.50\n|May precipitation inch =\t3.52\n|Jun precipitation inch =\t3.78\n|Jul precipitation inch =\t3.35\n|Aug precipitation inch =\t3.92\n|Sep precipitation inch =\t3.91\n|Oct precipitation inch =\t4.23\n|Nov precipitation inch =\t4.53\n|Dec precipitation inch =\t4.52\n|year precipitation inch=\t49.14\n| humidity colour = green\t\n| Jan humidity =\t68.6\n| Feb humidity =\t67.9\n| Mar humidity =\t66.4\n| Apr humidity =\t66.9\n| May humidity =\t70.3\n| Jun humidity =\t73.7\n| Jul humidity =\t75.6\n| Aug humidity =\t75.6\n| Sep humidity =\t75.2\n| Oct humidity =\t71.8\n| Nov humidity =\t69.8\n| Dec humidity =\t69.5\n| year humidity =\t71.0\n| Jan dew point F = 21.4\n| Feb dew point F = 22.8\n| Mar dew point F = 27.5\n| Apr dew point F = 35.9\n| May dew point F = 46.0\n| Jun dew point F = 56.5\n| Jul dew point F = 63.1\n| Aug dew point F = 62.6\n| Sep dew point F = 56.1\n| Oct dew point F = 45.3\n| Nov dew point F = 36.4\n| Dec dew point F = 27.2\n| year dew point F = 41.8\n|source 1 = PRISM Climate Group<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prism.oregonstate.edu/explorer/|title=PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State U|website=www.prism.oregonstate.edu|accessdate=June 26, 2019}}</ref>}}\n\n==Ecology==\n\nAccording to the [[A.

As one of two major east\u2013west routes on the Cape, Route 28 is regularly congested, and there is minimal room for widening opportunities. [[Massachusetts Route 151|Route 151]] runs east\u2013west through the northern section of the town, connecting North Falmouth and Hatchville with Mashpee.{{citation needed||date=May 2016}}\n\nFalmouth is home to [[The Woods Hole, Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket Steamship Authority]]. Daily ferry service brings tourists, residents and supplies from Woods Hole to [[Nantucket]] and [[Martha's Vineyard]]. It is the main ferry line between the Vineyard and the mainland (as Nantucket is further east, its main line leaves [[Hyannis, Massachusetts|Hyannis]]). A seasonal ferry, the ''Island Queen'', runs from Falmouth Harbor to Martha's Vineyard.{{citation needed||date=May 2016}}\n\nThe [[Massachusetts Coastal Railroad]] provides rail freight service to North Falmouth, where a spur runs into Otis Air Base to serve a trash transfer station. Also, as of a June 25, 2009 capecodonline.com article, the company plans to re-extend passenger railroad service to the town, complete with dinner and tourist trains, though this will also be only to North Falmouth, due to the fact that the other {{convert|8|mi|0}} of railroad track had been replaced with the current [[Shining Sea Bikeway]]. On November 21, 2009, North Falmouth saw its first passenger train in at least 12 years. The nearest inter-city ([[Amtrak]]) passenger rail stations are [[Providence (Amtrak station)|Providence]] and Boston's [[South Station]]. The [[Middleborough/Lakeville (MBTA station)|Middleborough/Lakeville]] and [[Kingston/Route 3 (MBTA station)|Kingston/Route 3]] stations of the [[Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority|MBTA's]] [[MBTA commuter rail|commuter rail]] system provide the closest service to Boston.{{citation needed||date=May 2016}}\n\nThere is a private air park in East Falmouth,<ref>[http://www.airnav.com/airport/5B6 airnav.com]</ref> and the nearest national and international air service is at [[Logan International Airport]] in Boston and [[T.

Early principal activities were farming, salt works, shipping, whaling, and [[sheep husbandry]], which was very popular due to the introduction of [[Merino]] sheep and the beginnings of water-powered mills that could process the wool. In 1837, Falmouth averaged about 50 sheep per square mile.\n\nFalmouth saw brief action in the [[War of 1812]], when the area around Falmouth Heights, on its southern coast, was bombarded by several British [[frigate]]s and [[ships of the line]], and [[Massachusetts militia]] hastily entrenched themselves on the beaches to repulse a possible British landing which never came. By 1872, the train had come to Falmouth and Woods Hole, and some of the first summer homes were established. By the late 19th century, [[cranberry|cranberries]] were being cultivated and [[strawberries]] were being raised for the Boston market. Large-scale dairying was tried in the early 20th century in interior regions. After the improvement in highways, and thanks in part to the heavy use of neighboring [[Camp Edwards]] (now part of [[Joint Base Cape Cod]]) during World War II, population growth increased significantly. Large homebuilding booms occurred in the 1970s, followed by others in the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn the late 1800s, after railroad service was established between Boston and Cape Cod, James Madison Beebe bought over {{convert|700|acre}} and built Highfield Hall, which is now a museum, and much of the land is preserved as Beebe Woods. In 1965, [[Robert Manry]] sailed from Falmouth aboard his {{convert|13.5|ft|adj=on}} sailboat and reached Falmouth, England, 78 days later.\n\n===Historic districts===\nThe town of Falmouth has seven historic districts, including four on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]:\n*[[Falmouth Village Green Historic District|Falmouth Village Green]]\n*[[North Falmouth Village Historic District|North Falmouth Village]]\n*[[Waquoit Historic District|Waquoit]]\n*[[West Falmouth Village Historic District|West Falmouth Village]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.falmouthmass.us/history/register.pdf |title=Town of Falmouth, Historical Commission |access-date=2012-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802232830/http://www.falmouthmass.us/history/register.pdf |archive-date=2014-08-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nThe other three historic districts are in Woods Hole, Davisville, and Quissett.\n\nIn addition to the historic districts, Falmouth has ten individual sites on the National Register:\n*[[Central Fire Station (Falmouth, Massachusetts)|Central Fire Station]] \n*[[Crowell-Bourne Farm]]\n*[[Elnathan Nye House]]\n*[[Falmouth Pumping Station]]\n*[[Josiah Tobey House]]\n*[[Lawrence Academy (Falmouth, Massachusetts)|Lawrence Academy]]\n*[[Nobska Light]]\n*[[Poor House and Methodist Cemetery]]\n*[[Teaticket School]]\n*[[Woods Hole School]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.falmouthmass.us/depart.php?depkey=hdc |title=Town of Falmouth, Historic Districts Commission |access-date=2012-09-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116093144/http://www.falmouthmass.us/depart.php?depkey=hdc |archive-date=2012-01-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nOffshore Falmouth in [[Buzzards Bay]], [[Cleveland East Ledge Light]] is listed with the National Register.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Falmouth - Woods Hole 1.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Juniper Point, the eastern point of Woods Hole in Falmouth]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|141.0|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|114.1|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|26.8|km2|order=flip}}, or 19.04%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> Most of Falmouth, like the rest of Cape Cod, sits on glacial sands composed of glacial [[outwash]] deposits. However, the soil in the southwestern part of the town, consisting of [[moraine]] deposits, is more rocky and dense, like the rest of [[New England]], and many [[glacial erratic]]s are scattered about, having been dropped by the retreating glaciers. The climate is temperate marine. There is no exposed bedrock. Rainfall is evenly distributed throughout the year and averages 2 to 3 in (50 \u2013 75&nbsp;mm) per month.\n\nFalmouth lies on the southwestern tip of Cape Cod. It is bordered by [[Bourne, Massachusetts|Bourne]] and [[Sandwich, Massachusetts|Sandwich]] to the north, [[Mashpee, Massachusetts|Mashpee]] to the east, [[Vineyard Sound]] to the south, and [[Buzzards Bay]] to the west. At its closest point, Falmouth is approximately {{convert|560|yd|m}} from [[Nonamesset Island]], the easternmost island of the town of [[Gosnold, Massachusetts|Gosnold]] and the [[Elizabeth Islands]]. It is approximately {{convert|3+1/3|mi}} north-northwest of [[Martha's Vineyard]], the closest land to the island. Falmouth is approximately {{convert|14|mi}} south of the [[Bourne Bridge]], {{convert|22|mi}} west of [[Barnstable, Massachusetts|Barnstable]], and {{convert|77|mi}} south-southeast of [[Boston]].\n\nFalmouth's topography is similar to the rest of Cape Cod's, with many small ponds, creeks, and [[inlet]]s surrounded by the [[pine]]s and [[oak]]s of the Cape and often rocky beachfront. Falmouth's southern shore is notable for a series of ponds and rivers spaced very closely together, all of which travel some distance into the town. These include, from west to east, Falmouth Inner Harbor, Little Pond, Great Pond (which leads to the Dexter and [[Coonamesset River|Coonamesset]] rivers), Green Pond, Bourne's Pond, Eel Pond (which leads to the [[Childs River]]), and [[Waquoit Bay]], which lies along the Mashpee town line. The Buzzards Bay side of the town is primarily [[bay]]s divided by necks, peninsulas connected to land by [[isthmus|isthmi]]. The largest inlet is Megansett Cove along the Bourne town line. The Buzzards Bay shore of Falmouth is punctuated by a number of hamlets, including, from north to south, Megansett, [[New Silver Beach]], Old Silver, Chappaquoit, Sippewisset, Quissett, and [[Woods Hole]].\n\n==Climate==\n\nAccording to the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, Falmouth, Massachusetts has a warm-summer, wet all year, [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb''). Dfb climates are characterized by at least one month having an average mean temperature \u2264 32.0&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u2264 0.0&nbsp;\u00b0C), at least four months with an average mean temperature \u2265 50.0&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u2265 10.0&nbsp;\u00b0C), all months with an average mean temperature \u2264 71.6&nbsp;\u00b0F (\u2264 22.0&nbsp;\u00b0C), and no significant precipitation difference between seasons. The average seasonal (Nov-Apr) snowfall total is around 30 in (76&nbsp;cm). The average snowiest month is February which corresponds with the annual peak in [[nor'easter]] activity. According to the [[United States Department of Agriculture]], the [[plant hardiness zone]] is 7a with an average annual extreme minimum air temperature of 1.3&nbsp;\u00b0F (-17.1&nbsp;\u00b0C).<ref name=\"USDA\">{{cite web|url=https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/InteractiveMap.aspx|publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]]|accessdate=2019-06-28|title=USDA Interactive Plant Hardiness Map}}</ref>\n\n{{Weather box |width=auto\t\n|location = Falmouth, Barnstable County, Massachusetts (1981 \u2013 2010 averages)\n|single line = Y\t\n|Jan high F =\t38.1\n|Feb high F =\t39.8\n|Mar high F =\t45.2\n|Apr high F =\t54.2\n|May high F =\t63.4\n|Jun high F =\t72.6\n|Jul high F =\t78.5\n|Aug high F =\t78.1\n|Sep high F =\t72.0\n|Oct high F =\t62.3\n|Nov high F =\t53.4\n|Dec high F =\t43.7\n|year high F=\t58.5\n| Jan mean F =\t30.5\n| Feb mean F =\t32.2\n| Mar mean F =\t37.7\n| Apr mean F =\t46.3\n| May mean F =\t55.5\n| Jun mean F =\t65.1\n| Jul mean F =\t71.2\n| Aug mean F =\t70.7\n| Sep mean F =\t64.1\n| Oct mean F =\t54.2\n| Nov mean F =\t45.7\n| Dec mean F =\t36.2\n| year mean F =\t50.9\n|Jan low F =\t21.0\n|Feb low F =\t22.9\n|Mar low F =\t28.9\n|Apr low F =\t37.7\n|May low F =\t47.0\n|Jun low F =\t57.0\n|Jul low F =\t63.4\n|Aug low F =\t62.6\n|Sep low F =\t55.3\n|Oct low F =\t44.7\n|Nov low F =\t36.2\n|Dec low F =\t26.8\n|year low F=\t42.1\n|precipitation colour = green\t\n|Jan precipitation inch =\t4.11\n|Feb precipitation inch =\t3.57\n|Mar precipitation inch =\t5.20\n|Apr precipitation inch =\t4.50\n|May precipitation inch =\t3.52\n|Jun precipitation inch =\t3.78\n|Jul precipitation inch =\t3.35\n|Aug precipitation inch =\t3.92\n|Sep precipitation inch =\t3.91\n|Oct precipitation inch =\t4.23\n|Nov precipitation inch =\t4.53\n|Dec precipitation inch =\t4.52\n|year precipitation inch=\t49.14\n| humidity colour = green\t\n| Jan humidity =\t68.6\n| Feb humidity =\t67.9\n| Mar humidity =\t66.4\n| Apr humidity =\t66.9\n| May humidity =\t70.3\n| Jun humidity =\t73.7\n| Jul humidity =\t75.6\n| Aug humidity =\t75.6\n| Sep humidity =\t75.2\n| Oct humidity =\t71.8\n| Nov humidity =\t69.8\n| Dec humidity =\t69.5\n| year humidity =\t71.0\n| Jan dew point F = 21.4\n| Feb dew point F = 22.8\n| Mar dew point F = 27.5\n| Apr dew point F = 35.9\n| May dew point F = 46.0\n| Jun dew point F = 56.5\n| Jul dew point F = 63.1\n| Aug dew point F = 62.6\n| Sep dew point F = 56.1\n| Oct dew point F = 45.3\n| Nov dew point F = 36.4\n| Dec dew point F = 27.2\n| year dew point F = 41.8\n|source 1 = PRISM Climate Group<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prism.oregonstate.edu/explorer/|title=PRISM Climate Group, Oregon State U|website=www.prism.oregonstate.edu|accessdate=June 26, 2019}}</ref>}}\n\n==Ecology==\n\nAccording to the [[A.

The latter term is not to be confused with [[Idealism|metaphysical idealism]], a viewpoint about existence and [[rationality]] unrelated to the ethical concept.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe term \"ideal\" is applied not only to individuals but also to organizations large and small, from [[church (congregation)|independent churches]] to [[Activism|social activist groups]] to [[Political party|political parties]] to [[nation state]]s and more. An entity's ideals usually function as a way to set firm guidelines for [[decision making]], with the possibility of having to sacrifice and undergo loss being in the background. While ideals constitute [[fuzzy concept]]s without that clear-cut a definition, they remain an influential part not just of personal choice but of larger, civilization-wide social direction. Ideals as a topic receive both scholarly and layman discussion within a variety of fields including [[philosophy]] both historically and more recently.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broader context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' are inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai>{{citebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeTEDwAAQBAJ|first=Kai|last=Cabrera|publisher=[[Scientific e-Resources]]|date=2018|title=Ethics for Governance|ISBN=9781839473906|pages=1-3}}</ref> Whether [[Ethics in religion|based in religious traditions]] or [[Secular ethics|fundamentally secular]], an entity's relative prioritization of ideals often serves to indicate the extent of that entity's moral dedication. For example, someone who espouses the ideal of [[honesty]] yet expresses the willingness to [[lie]] to protect a friend demonstrates not only devotion to the different ideal of [[friendship]] but also belief in that other ideal to supersede honesty in importance. A particular case of this, frequently known as 'the inquiring murderer', is well-known as an intellectual criticism of [[Kantianism]] and its [[categorical imperative]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nBroader philosophical schools with a strong emphasis on idealistic viewpoints include [[Christian ethics]], [[Jewish ethics]], and [[Platonist ethics]].<ref name=rorty/> Development of state-based and international ideals in terms of large-scale social policy has additionally been long studied by scholars, individuals looking particularly at the [[Foresight (psychology)|psychological foresight]] and determination required to manage effective foreign policy. [[Democratic peace theory]] in [[international relations]] study is an example.{{fact|date=April 2020}} [[Idealism in international relations|Idealism in the context of foreign relations]] generally involves the advocacy of institutions enacting policies such as [[international law]] implementation and other measures in order to avoid [[warfare]].<ref name=global/>\n\nDifferent issues in analyzing idealistic ethics exist. Specifically, scholars such as [[Terry Eagleton]] have opined that the practical plausibility of particular ideals wind up being inverse to their intellectual legitimacy. Thus, an idealist with values at odds with his or her actual behavior stands apart, in Eagleton's view, from one who sets forth his or her ethics based fundamentally on his or her pragmatic desires, the latter's set of principles as such losing the philosophically impressive nature of the former.<ref name=terry/> As well, philosophical commentators such as [[Richard Rorty]] have criticized the very concept of unchanging ideals existing separate to [[human nature]] as such.<ref name=rorty/> In the [[Politics|political context]], scholars such as [[Gerald Gaus]] have argued that particular strains of idealism cause individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy.<ref name=will/>\n\nHistorically, advocates for idealism in the context of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" include [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[John Locke]]. Their emphasis on rational thinking led them to develop theories of ideal morality based around [[reason]]. Works authored by the former on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', and ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the latter commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> To Kant, no clear-cut divide exists between [[morality]] and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with ethical analysis.<ref name=notre>{{citejournal|title=Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|accessdate=April 7, 2020|authorlink=Frederick Rauscher|first=Frederick|last=Rauscher|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/anthropology-from-a-pragmatic-point-of-view/}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of demonstrated life experience and proliferation of personal stories via [[mass media]], multiple idealistic individuals have received attention as [[moral example]]s for others to draw understanding from. For instance, [[United States]] leaders known for their idealism include [[President of the United States|American Presidents]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]],<ref name=hull/><ref name=lecture/> [[Ronald Reagan]],<ref name=diggins/><ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Barack Obama]],<ref name=outdated/><ref name=sarson/><ref name=union/> while [[Europe|European]] officials similarly known for such ethical attitudes include [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Prime Minister of France]] and senior general,<ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Prime Minister of Germany]].<ref name=craig/><ref name=global/><ref name=hans/> Private individuals known for their prominent ideals include [[Fred Rogers]], U.S. [[television personality]],<ref name=rogers/> and [[Terry Fox]], Canadian [[athlete]] and [[Charitable organization|charity]] advocate.<ref name=derringer/><ref name=hero/><ref name=mile/> Multiple idealistically optimistic characters have been featured in prominent creative media, the [[Star Trek|''Star Trek'' franchise]] centered around [[space exploration]] being a well-known example of fictional idealism.<ref name=peter/><ref name=sopan/>\n\n==Background and history==\n===Terminology===\nThe term \"idealism\" and the related labeling, whether self-applied or otherwise, of individuals and/or groups as being \"idealist\" or against such people has a certain complexity to it. In the sense of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical thought]], \"[[idealism]]\" is generally described as centering around a particular view of objective reality versus the perception of reality as well the nature of if potential knowledge exists independently to humanity or whether knowledge is solely tied to experiences in the mind. Even within that particular intellectual sphere, the stamp of \"idealist\" as placed on particular [[Philosophy|philosophers]] attracts considerable controversy.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn [[Colloquialism|colloquial language]], the term \"ideal\" is often applied loosely, with varying circumstances getting described as such in highly different contexts. For instance, in [[cooking]] the descriptions of certain ingredient portions, heating temperatures, preparation times, and the like are often labeled as \"ideal\" or otherwise. Such uses of the term are also highly distinct from the historical and social concept of having an \"ethical ideal\" as such.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Definitions and justifications===\n[[File:Plato_Pio-Clementino_Inv305_n2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher Plato argued that ideals exist in a kind of independence from humanity such that [[reason]] discovers the principles rather than simply creates them.<ref name=nicholas/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Untied States|American]] philosopher [[Ralph Barton Perry]] has defined idealistic morality as being the result of a particular viewpoint about knowledge itself, writing in his book ''The Moral Economy'',\n{{Quote|\"Moral idealism means to interpret life consistently with ethical, scientific, and metaphysical truth. It endeavors to justify the maximum of hope, without compromising or confusing any enlightenment judgement of truth. In this it is, I think, not only consistent with the spirit of a liberal and rational age but also with the primary motive of religion. There can be no religion... without an open and candid mind as well as an indomitable purpose.\"<ref name=perry/>}}\n\nSomewhat in contrast, American scholar [[Nicholas Rescher]] has stated that the metaphysical nature of ideals possesses a particular status as \"useful fictions\" in terms of their entailed existence, writing in his book ''Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry Into the Nature and Function of Ideals'',\n{{quote|\"The 'reality' of an ideal lies not in its substantive realization in some separate domain but in its formative impetus upon human thought and action in this imperfect world. The object at issue with an ideal does not, and cannot, ''exist'' as such. What does, however, exist is the idea of such an object. Existing, as it must, in thought alone (in the manner appropriate to ideas), it exerts a powerful[ly] organizing and motivating force on our thinking, providing at once a standard of appraisal and a stimulus to action.\"<ref name=nicholas/>}}\n\nHowever, multiple thinkers have asserted that ideals as such constitute things that ought to be said to exist in the real world, having a substance partly to the same extent as flesh and blood people and similar concrete entities. A prominent example of this certain viewpoint is the iconic Greek philosopher [[Plato]]. To him, ideals represented self-contained objects existing in their own domain that humanity discovered through [[reason]] rather than invented out of whole cloth for people's own benefit. Thus, while existing in relation to the human mind, ideals still possessed a certain kind of metaphysical independence.<ref name=nicholas/>\n\n===Historical development and recent analysis===\n[[Image:Gerome - Diogenes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient cynicism|Ancient cynics]] such as [[Diogenes]] dismissed optimistic views of [[human nature]] as baseless given common brutality, with the moral ideals of the time receiving skepticism as he sought his own internal compass.<ref name=cynic/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the wider context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' are inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai/> Thus, ideals have been the topic of discussion and debate since the beginnings of organized human [[civilization]]. The [[history of philosophy]] has varied widely over the many centuries as to conceptions of what moral idealism actually is and how it gets applied in actual life experience.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFrom antiquity onward, multiple philosophers have remarked that human beings appear to, by instinct, behave in a matter with few if any ideals and general morals of whatever kind. Thinker [[David Hume]], for instance, explicitly declared people to be inherent \"[[Slavery|slaves]]\" to their passions.<ref name=kant/> When forming his own theories of morality, Hume considered it folly to emphasize what people hopefully wish to achieve and additionally commented that enforcing ideals without proper grounding in practical, already existing mores undermines society itself.<ref>{{citenews|journal=[[The Nation (journal)|The Nation]]|accessdate=April 7, 2020|title=Hume's Call to Action|authorlink=Richard Bourke (academic)|date=April 20, 2016|first=Richard|last=Bourke|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/humes-call-to-action/}}</ref> [[Ancient cynicism|Cynics of the ancient world]] frequently referred to humanity in general as not only not perfectible but fundamentally depraved. [[Diogenes]], while arguing that some individuals could through great effort achieve some kind of a moral dignity, was a prominent example in his dismissal of the values common in his day; he sought his own path based on a particular set of ideals that involved begging on the streets, living in a barrel, and wearing rags.<ref name=cynic>{{citeweb|url=https://academyofideas.com/2013/05/diogenes-the-cynic/|title=Diogenes the Cynic|accessdate=April 6, 2020|date=May 26, 2013|publisher=[[AcademyofIdeas.com]]}}</ref>\n\nMultiple philosophers have argued in favor of particular types of idealism as well for years. In terms of broader discussions on ethics, many classical European philosophers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]] have famously argued that strong moral standards on individual choice exist based upon standards of [[rationality]] that can be found through [[Logic|logical analysis]] by reasonable observers. Specifically, instrumental principles based on satisfying one\u2019s desires make up the basis for ideal ethics through Hobbes' approach. External principles existing in the discoverable state of nature outside of human experience yet possible to tease out through personal study constitute Locke's background source for ideal ethics.<ref name=kant>{{citeweb|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/|title=Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy|accessdate=April 8, 2020|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=July 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPhilosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s particular view of [[human nature]] and intellectual inquiry, later summed up under the banner of \"[[Kantianism]]\", stressed the inherent power of logical thinking in terms of moral analysis. Kant's advocacy for the \"[[categorical imperative]]\", a doctrine through which every individual choice has be made with the consideration of the decider that it ought to be a universally held maxim, took place in the broader context of his metaphysical views. To Kant, defiance of higher idealistic principles was not only wrong in a practical sense but in a fundamentally rational and thus moral sense as well. Works authored by Kant on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the latter commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> To Kant, no ironclad divide exists between [[morality]] and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with ethical analysis.<ref name=notre/>\n\n[[File:Sermon-on-the-mount-tiffany.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sermon of the Mount]] is a key moment that has been frequently used in the development of [[Christian ethics]] and the sense of idealism embodied within that school of thought.{{fact|date=April 2020}}]]\n\nIn both [[Jewish ethics]] and later [[Christian ethics]], the holding of moral ideals over personal convenience and even otherwise perfectly logical expectations is frequently praised. [[Golden rule]] based moral standards involve restrictions such as holding back the quest for [[vengeance (concept)|vengeance]] by the wronged such that punishment only gets applied in a limited, specific fashion; this example being later evaluated as the [[tit-for-tat]] strategy in [[game theory]]. In terms of [[Christianity]], the teachings of the [[Gospels]] and particularly the setting forth of clear-cut principles on the [[Sermon on the Mount]] constitute an extension of the golden rule; individuals, under [[Jesus Christ|Jesus']] exhortations, are called to hold to the ideal of treating other people even better than they rationally expected to be treated back. Specific phrases such as '[[turn the other cheek]]' have come about in terms of moral instruction to effectively convey this idealism.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nWhile [[Western world|Western nations]] have widely retained these influences, in practical terms a great many powerful rulers and prominent thinkers since the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] have pushed back on higher notions of idealistic ethics. Many have done so based on little other than expediency. However, whether explicitly in words or explicitly through deeds, more cynical figures have counter-argued from points of view that can broadly be labeled as \"[[moral relativism]]\". As the arguments have gone, human beings constitute little more than crude matter and cannot reasonably be held to act in any sort of larger principle; survival remains their core instinct such that civilization functions as a thin veneer over base instincts.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe advent of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\", which in large part centered around the application of rational-based principles such as the [[scientific method]] upon human nature, caused increased interest in ethical philosophy as a field of study. Notions of \"benevolence\" attracted widespread attention in terms of governance, with leaders exhorted to act based on idealistic principles and to particularly champion causes such as the facilitating of the arts, increased educational efforts, effective stewardship of national resources, and the like. This movement increased trends away from [[absolute monarchy]] and [[dictatorship]] towards that of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Republic|republican government]]. The scientifically based, forward thinking viewpoint about human nature became later known as \"[[classical liberalism]]\".{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|Philosopher [[John Locke]], a prominent figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]], articulated a vision of the individual and collective pursuit of ideals arising from the logical study and analysis of the state of nature.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\nModern Western philosophy in terms of its discussion of ideals largely takes place within the framework of Enlightenment thinking. As per the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]], itself an evolution from the earlier [[American Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Constitution of the United States]], many theorizing academics of the 19th century and the 20th century have set forth an optimistic view of humanity; all individuals by nature of their mere existence are thought to have been born inherently good, inherently equal, and inherently free. A defining inflection point of this trend is the experience of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]], with the experience creating a sort of dualistic approach to [[ideology]] in which [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] [[democracy]] centered around classical liberalism is inherently pitted forever in struggle with [[Tyranny|tyrannies]] centered around mass misery.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the advent of the 21st century, philosophizers have debated the rapid evolution of different cultures, particularly given advancing technology, and the seeming acceptance of egalitarian values previously thought of as radical or undesirable by [[Center-left politics|center-left]], [[Political moderation|moderate]], and [[Center-right politics|center-right]] individuals. The conflict between these people, many of them belonging to younger generations such as the [[Millennial]]s, and those [[Political extremism|political extremists]] of the [[Far-right politics|global far-right movement]], the social trend often called \"[[Neo-nationalism|new nationalism]]\", has defined new distinctions between what it means to be a \"moral idealist\". As well, the question of the fundamental change of humanity itself has attracted much attention; what a [[transhuman]] or even [[posthuman]] individual possesses in terms of ideals in contrast with regular human beings remains an open question.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broadest sense, the question of whether or not humanity has fundamentally progressed towards a set of moral ideals as time has passed has never achieved any particular consensus. Examples of philosophers who argue partially in support of the notion include the American thinker [[Richard Rorty]], a figure who has criticized the very concept of unchanging ethical principles set forth in inherent humanity while still lauding general social progress.<ref name=rorty/> Optimistic views sometimes draw from the work of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] religious figure [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. He famously stated that humanity will advance in terms of not just scientific development but also idealistic morality to a sort of final oneness regarded by him as the '[[Omega Point]]'.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Recent debates and discussions==\n===In applied ethics===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe specific philosophical school known as \"[[applied ethics]]\" frequently involves discussion over ideals and the desirability of holding to them or abandoning them, depending on the context. In some theories of applied ethics, relative importance gets given to such social orders as a way to [[Dispute resolution|resolve disputes effectively]]. In analysis of [[legal theory]], for instance, a [[judge]] is sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of [[truth]], which would likely advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of fairness, which would likely advise seeking to restore goodwill between individuals regardless of specific findings during a particular case. Said judge may also have to consider the principle of the [[right to a speedy trial]] as well, which places limits on the previous two ideals given the time involved in ferreting out case details.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn an August 2005 address, philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] remarked upon the \"moral idealism common to Platonism, Judaism, and Christianity\" and the related notion of strictly specified principles through the lens of applied ethics, asserting to a group of business professionals,\n{{quote|\"[I]ndividuals become aware of more alternatives, and therefore wiser, as they grow older. The human race as a whole has become wiser as history has moved along. The source of these new alternatives is the human imagination. It is the ability to come up with new ideas, rather than the ability to get in touch with unchanging essences, that is the engine of moral progress.\"<ref name=rorty>https://www.jstor.org/stable/3857921</ref>}}\n\n===In secular ethics===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the widespread movement away from traditional religious beliefs in both the [[Anglosphere]] and other nations in the 20th century, the question of to what extent the ideals held by the irreligious or even anti-religious owe a debt to particular faith groups has attracted much attention. Specifically, certain authors known as \"[[New atheism|new atheists]]\" such as [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]] have argued that newly emerging forms of [[secular ethics]] constitute an approach of people treating each other that is more logical, just, and reasonable when seen as a rejoiner to previous forms of \"traditional values\". At the same time, multiple thinkers have advocated for moral relativism and a reduced or non-existent sense of holding to previously well-promoted ideals as a direct result of their wholesale rejection of religion.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Appeals to idealism in practice==\n===In conceptual and historical politics===\n\n[[File:Pericles.jpg|thumb|right|Greek statesman [[Pericles]]' vision of [[Athenian democracy]] stressed a sense of what he saw as core ideals, particularly the intelligence and tolerance displayed by Athenians.<ref name=pericles/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdeals have played a role in [[politics]] for [[millennia]]. For example, iconic Greek statesman [[Pericles]] famously presented an ideal-based view of the [[Mediterranean]] world. In 431, shortly after the [[Peloponnesian War]] had started, his 'Funeral Oration' made to commemorate fallen soldiers, described for posterity by the historian [[Thucydides]], presented a view of [[Athens]] and the city-state's broader civilization that emphasized a sense of cleverness and open-mindedness that Pericles believed gave it the strength to rise to different challenges.<ref name=pericles>{{citenews|journal=[[Pbs.org]]|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/background/36.html|title=Pericles Funeral Oration in Depth|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref> Other early historical figures known for appealing to ethical ideals in their oratory include Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]], the figure's commentary on [[Hellenic Greece|Hellenized]] values leading to his moral appeal among supporters. In contrast to what he saw as [[decadence]] spreading into [[Rome]] and nearby areas from elsewhere, Cato articulated support for what he labeled as traditional Roman ethics.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMost political revolutions draw support from the mass appeal of a certain moral idealism in contrast to the doctrines of those holding [[Power (sociology)|power]], having the various grievances with the status quo created from real or perceived misrule spark ethical debate. During the [[French Revolution]], the rhetorical principles of ''\"[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]\"'' (English: ''\"Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood\"'') got raised to the status of clear-cut ideals, the new nation-state constituted a sort of grand experiment in what became in de facto and later de jure a new [[religion]]. Many political movements in modern times center themselves upon multiple ideals found to be reinforcing. A recent example is the [[peace movement]] and the opposition expressed worldwide to [[warfare]] in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] as well as elsewhere.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn many cases current and historical, one finds instances in which proclaimed ideals simply aren't lived up to by various figures while in office, despite claims made by the officials before taking power and since attaining it.

Political theorist [[Bernard Crick]] has stated that a way to solve this [[dilemma]] is to have ideals that themselves are descriptive of a generalized process rather than a specific outcome, particularly when the latter is hard to achieve.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe line between an ideal and a [[virtue]] is difficult to access given that both are [[fuzzy concept]]s. In general, some philosophers have argued that an ideal usually constitutes something more inherent that one can make a [[Habituation|habit]] while virtues, instead, necessarily involve going above and beyond regular decision making in order to actively strive for something, constituting a behavior that's inherently highly difficult to turn into a regular practice.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nKant wrote in his work ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'' pitting idealism against the enactment of personal [[vice]], arguing,\n{{quote|\"Young man! Deny yourself satisfaction (of amusement, of debauchery, of love, etc.), not with the Stoical intention of complete abstinence, but with the refined Epicurean intention of having in view an ever-growing pleasure. This stinginess with the cash of your vital urge makes you definitely richer through the postponement of pleasure, even if you should, for the most part, renounce the indulgence of it until the end of your life. The awareness of having pleasure under your control is, like everything idealistic, more fruitful and more abundant than everything that satisfies the sense through indulgence because it is thereby simultaneously consumed and consequently lost from the aggregate of totality.\"<ref>''Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View''. Immanuel Kant. Translated by Victor Lyle Dowdell. Revised and Edited by Hans H. Rudnick. With an Introduction by Frederick P. Van De Pitte. Southern Illinois University Press. Carbondale & Edwardsville.</ref>}}\n\n===Relative ideals===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Robert S. Hartman]] has contended that since, colloquially, labeling an entity as ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class, therefore the term has particular implications when used in an ethical context. For example, the ideal student is the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles, according to Hartman. Since one can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, Hartman has stated, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is to Hartman. Thus, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is worse than a very smooth one drawn with a compass' aid, but both are better than a regularly made square.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFor Hartman, the world in general presents a situation in which each particular entity ought usually to become more like its ideal if possible. This entails that, in [[ethics]], each individual should analogously to become more like the hypothetical ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self, in Hartman's view.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Totalizing ideals versus emergent ideals===\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\nThe question of to what extent one can hold to certain ideals practically and how facing resistance will shape them include philosopher [[Terry Eagleton]]. Writing in his book ''After Theory'', he has commented,\n{{quote|\"Moral values which state what you ought to do are impressively idealistic, but too blatantly at odds with your behaviour.

While the titular inquisitor rationally argues for the relativist view that people seek safety and security over higher callings, Christ surprisingly kisses the aged, emotionally distant leader on the lips; while still holding to his views, the moved inquisitor allows Christ to leave freely. The ethical conflict posed by the characters's fundamental opposition, notably, fails to come to a resolution in the work, the [[ambiguity]] gaining much notice by later commentators.<ref>{{citeweb|title=The Grand Inquisitor \u2014 Dostoevsky\u2019s Greatest Scene|accessdate=April 8, 2020|publisher=[[Medium.com]]|url=https://medium.com/classical-humanist/the-grand-inquisitor-dostoevskys-greatest-scene-3616517002cc|first=Kevin|last=Shau|date=September 16, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Comic books]] often incorporate conflicts between traditional heroes and heroines, ones who act out of a sense of altruism and cling to strict sets of ideals, with [[Antihero|antiheroes]] and other morally ambiguous individuals that still feature prominent superpowers.

The latter term is not to be confused with [[Idealism|metaphysical idealism]], a viewpoint about existence and [[rationality]] unrelated to the ethical concept.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe term \"ideal\" is applied not only to individuals but also to organizations large and small, from [[church (congregation)|independent churches]] to [[Activism|social activist groups]] to [[Political party|political parties]] to [[nation state]]s and more. An entity's ideals usually function as a way to set firm guidelines for [[decision making]], with the possibility of having to sacrifice and undergo loss being in the background. While ideals constitute [[fuzzy concept]]s without that clear-cut a definition, they remain an influential part not just of personal choice but of larger, civilization-wide social direction. Ideals as a topic receive both scholarly and layman discussion within a variety of fields including [[philosophy]] both historically and more recently.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broader context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' are inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai>{{citebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeTEDwAAQBAJ|first=Kai|last=Cabrera|publisher=[[Scientific e-Resources]]|date=2018|title=Ethics for Governance|ISBN=9781839473906|pages=1-3}}</ref> Whether [[Ethics in religion|based in religious traditions]] or [[Secular ethics|fundamentally secular]], an entity's relative prioritization of ideals often serves to indicate the extent of that entity's moral dedication. For example, someone who espouses the ideal of [[honesty]] yet expresses the willingness to [[lie]] to protect a friend demonstrates not only devotion to the different ideal of [[friendship]] but also belief in that other ideal to supersede honesty in importance. A particular case of this, frequently known as 'the inquiring murderer', is well-known as an intellectual criticism of [[Kantianism]] and its [[categorical imperative]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nBroader philosophical schools with a strong emphasis on idealistic viewpoints include [[Christian ethics]], [[Jewish ethics]], and [[Platonist ethics]].<ref name=rorty/> Development of state-based and international ideals in terms of large-scale social policy has additionally been long studied by scholars, individuals looking particularly at the [[Foresight (psychology)|psychological foresight]] and determination required to manage effective foreign policy. [[Democratic peace theory]] in [[international relations]] study is an example.{{fact|date=April 2020}} [[Idealism in international relations|Idealism in the context of foreign relations]] generally involves the advocacy of institutions enacting policies such as [[international law]] implementation and other measures in order to avoid [[warfare]].<ref name=global/>\n\nDifferent issues in analyzing idealistic ethics exist. Specifically, scholars such as [[Terry Eagleton]] have opined that the practical plausibility of particular ideals wind up being inverse to their intellectual legitimacy. Thus, an idealist with values at odds with his or her actual behavior stands apart, in Eagleton's view, from one who sets forth his or her ethics based fundamentally on his or her pragmatic desires, the latter's set of principles as such losing the philosophically impressive nature of the former.<ref name=terry/> As well, philosophical commentators such as [[Richard Rorty]] have criticized the very concept of unchanging ideals existing separate to [[human nature]] as such.<ref name=rorty/> In the [[Politics|political context]], scholars such as [[Gerald Gaus]] have argued that particular strains of idealism cause individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy.<ref name=will/>\n\nHistorically, advocates for idealism in the context of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\" include [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[John Locke]]. Their emphasis on rational thinking led them to develop theories of ideal morality based around [[reason]]. Works authored by the former on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', and ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the latter commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> To Kant, no clear-cut divide exists between [[morality]] and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with ethical analysis.<ref name=notre>{{citejournal|title=Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View|journal=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews|accessdate=April 7, 2020|authorlink=Frederick Rauscher|first=Frederick|last=Rauscher|url=https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/anthropology-from-a-pragmatic-point-of-view/}}</ref>\n\nIn terms of demonstrated life experience and proliferation of personal stories via [[mass media]], multiple idealistic individuals have received attention as [[moral example]]s for others to draw understanding from. For instance, [[United States]] leaders known for their idealism include [[President of the United States|American Presidents]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]],<ref name=hull/><ref name=lecture/> [[Ronald Reagan]],<ref name=diggins/><ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Barack Obama]],<ref name=outdated/><ref name=sarson/><ref name=union/> while [[Europe|European]] officials similarly known for such ethical attitudes include [[Charles de Gaulle]], [[Prime Minister of France]] and senior general,<ref name=zaretsky/> and [[Konrad Adenauer]], [[Prime Minister of Germany]].<ref name=craig/><ref name=global/><ref name=hans/> Private individuals known for their prominent ideals include [[Fred Rogers]], U.S. [[television personality]],<ref name=rogers/> and [[Terry Fox]], Canadian [[athlete]] and [[Charitable organization|charity]] advocate.<ref name=derringer/><ref name=hero/><ref name=mile/> Multiple idealistically optimistic characters have been featured in prominent creative media, the [[Star Trek|''Star Trek'' franchise]] centered around [[space exploration]] being a well-known example of fictional idealism.<ref name=peter/><ref name=sopan/>\n\n==Background and history==\n===Terminology===\nThe term \"idealism\" and the related labeling, whether self-applied or otherwise, of individuals and/or groups as being \"idealist\" or against such people has a certain complexity to it. In the sense of [[Metaphysics|metaphysical thought]], \"[[idealism]]\" is generally described as centering around a particular view of objective reality versus the perception of reality as well the nature of if potential knowledge exists independently to humanity or whether knowledge is solely tied to experiences in the mind. Even within that particular intellectual sphere, the stamp of \"idealist\" as placed on particular [[Philosophy|philosophers]] attracts considerable controversy.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn [[Colloquialism|colloquial language]], the term \"ideal\" is often applied loosely, with varying circumstances getting described as such in highly different contexts. For instance, in [[cooking]] the descriptions of certain ingredient portions, heating temperatures, preparation times, and the like are often labeled as \"ideal\" or otherwise. Such uses of the term are also highly distinct from the historical and social concept of having an \"ethical ideal\" as such.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Definitions and justifications===\n[[File:Plato_Pio-Clementino_Inv305_n2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher Plato argued that ideals exist in a kind of independence from humanity such that [[reason]] discovers the principles rather than simply creates them.<ref name=nicholas/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[Untied States|American]] philosopher [[Ralph Barton Perry]] has defined idealistic morality as being the result of a particular viewpoint about knowledge itself, writing in his book ''The Moral Economy'',\n{{Quote|\"Moral idealism means to interpret life consistently with ethical, scientific, and metaphysical truth. It endeavors to justify the maximum of hope, without compromising or confusing any enlightenment judgement of truth. In this it is, I think, not only consistent with the spirit of a liberal and rational age but also with the primary motive of religion. There can be no religion... without an open and candid mind as well as an indomitable purpose.\"<ref name=perry/>}}\n\nSomewhat in contrast, American scholar [[Nicholas Rescher]] has stated that the metaphysical nature of ideals possesses a particular status as \"useful fictions\" in terms of their entailed existence, writing in his book ''Ethical Idealism: An Inquiry Into the Nature and Function of Ideals'',\n{{quote|\"The 'reality' of an ideal lies not in its substantive realization in some separate domain but in its formative impetus upon human thought and action in this imperfect world. The object at issue with an ideal does not, and cannot, ''exist'' as such. What does, however, exist is the idea of such an object. Existing, as it must, in thought alone (in the manner appropriate to ideas), it exerts a powerful[ly] organizing and motivating force on our thinking, providing at once a standard of appraisal and a stimulus to action.\"<ref name=nicholas/>}}\n\nHowever, multiple thinkers have asserted that ideals as such constitute things that ought to be said to exist in the real world, having a substance partly to the same extent as flesh and blood people and similar concrete entities. A prominent example of this certain viewpoint is the iconic Greek philosopher [[Plato]]. To him, ideals represented self-contained objects existing in their own domain that humanity discovered through [[reason]] rather than invented out of whole cloth for people's own benefit. Thus, while existing in relation to the human mind, ideals still possessed a certain kind of metaphysical independence.<ref name=nicholas/>\n\n===Historical development and recent analysis===\n[[Image:Gerome - Diogenes.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ancient cynicism|Ancient cynics]] such as [[Diogenes]] dismissed optimistic views of [[human nature]] as baseless given common brutality, with the moral ideals of the time receiving skepticism as he sought his own internal compass.<ref name=cynic/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the wider context of [[ethics]], the very terms 'ethical' and 'ideal' are inherently tied. Philosopher [[Rushworth Kidder]] has stated that \"standard definitions of ethics have typically included such phrases as 'the science of the ideal human character'\".<ref name=kai/> Thus, ideals have been the topic of discussion and debate since the beginnings of organized human [[civilization]]. The [[history of philosophy]] has varied widely over the many centuries as to conceptions of what moral idealism actually is and how it gets applied in actual life experience.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFrom antiquity onward, multiple philosophers have remarked that human beings appear to, by instinct, behave in a matter with few if any ideals and general morals of whatever kind. Thinker [[David Hume]], for instance, explicitly declared people to be inherent \"[[Slavery|slaves]]\" to their passions.<ref name=kant/> When forming his own theories of morality, Hume considered it folly to emphasize what people hopefully wish to achieve and additionally commented that enforcing ideals without proper grounding in practical, already existing mores undermines society itself.<ref>{{citenews|journal=[[The Nation (journal)|The Nation]]|accessdate=April 7, 2020|title=Hume's Call to Action|authorlink=Richard Bourke (academic)|date=April 20, 2016|first=Richard|last=Bourke|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/humes-call-to-action/}}</ref> [[Ancient cynicism|Cynics of the ancient world]] frequently referred to humanity in general as not only not perfectible but fundamentally depraved. [[Diogenes]], while arguing that some individuals could through great effort achieve some kind of a moral dignity, was a prominent example in his dismissal of the values common in his day; he sought his own path based on a particular set of ideals that involved begging on the streets, living in a barrel, and wearing rags.<ref name=cynic>{{citeweb|url=https://academyofideas.com/2013/05/diogenes-the-cynic/|title=Diogenes the Cynic|accessdate=April 6, 2020|date=May 26, 2013|publisher=[[AcademyofIdeas.com]]}}</ref>\n\nMultiple philosophers have argued in favor of particular types of idealism as well for years. In terms of broader discussions on ethics, many classical European philosophers such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]] have famously argued that strong moral standards on individual choice exist based upon standards of [[rationality]] that can be found through [[Logic|logical analysis]] by reasonable observers. Specifically, instrumental principles based on satisfying one\u2019s desires make up the basis for ideal ethics through Hobbes' approach. External principles existing in the discoverable state of nature outside of human experience yet possible to tease out through personal study constitute Locke's background source for ideal ethics.<ref name=kant>{{citeweb|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant-moral/|title=Kant\u2019s Moral Philosophy|accessdate=April 8, 2020|publisher=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|date=July 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nPhilosopher [[Immanuel Kant]]'s particular view of [[human nature]] and intellectual inquiry, later summed up under the banner of \"[[Kantianism]]\", stressed the inherent power of logical thinking in terms of moral analysis. Kant's advocacy for the \"[[categorical imperative]]\", a doctrine through which every individual choice has be made with the consideration of the decider that it ought to be a universally held maxim, took place in the broader context of his metaphysical views. To Kant, defiance of higher idealistic principles was not only wrong in a practical sense but in a fundamentally rational and thus moral sense as well. Works authored by Kant on the topic include the initial publication ''[[The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals]]'' followed by ''[[The Critique of Practical Reason]]'', ''[[The Metaphysics of Morals]]'', ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'', ''[[Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason]]'', the latter commentaries developing the intellectual figure's thinking.<ref name=kant/> To Kant, no ironclad divide exists between [[morality]] and the [[Nature|natural world]], with empirical analysis of human [[psychology]] dovetailing with ethical analysis.<ref name=notre/>\n\n[[File:Sermon-on-the-mount-tiffany.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Sermon of the Mount]] is a key moment that has been frequently used in the development of [[Christian ethics]] and the sense of idealism embodied within that school of thought.{{fact|date=April 2020}}]]\n\nIn both [[Jewish ethics]] and later [[Christian ethics]], the holding of moral ideals over personal convenience and even otherwise perfectly logical expectations is frequently praised. [[Golden rule]] based moral standards involve restrictions such as holding back the quest for [[vengeance (concept)|vengeance]] by the wronged such that punishment only gets applied in a limited, specific fashion; this example being later evaluated as the [[tit-for-tat]] strategy in [[game theory]]. In terms of [[Christianity]], the teachings of the [[Gospels]] and particularly the setting forth of clear-cut principles on the [[Sermon on the Mount]] constitute an extension of the golden rule; individuals, under [[Jesus Christ|Jesus']] exhortations, are called to hold to the ideal of treating other people even better than they rationally expected to be treated back. Specific phrases such as '[[turn the other cheek]]' have come about in terms of moral instruction to effectively convey this idealism.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nWhile [[Western world|Western nations]] have widely retained these influences, in practical terms a great many powerful rulers and prominent thinkers since the [[fall of the Roman Empire]] have pushed back on higher notions of idealistic ethics. Many have done so based on little other than expediency. However, whether explicitly in words or explicitly through deeds, more cynical figures have counter-argued from points of view that can broadly be labeled as \"[[moral relativism]]\". As the arguments have gone, human beings constitute little more than crude matter and cannot reasonably be held to act in any sort of larger principle; survival remains their core instinct such that civilization functions as a thin veneer over base instincts.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe advent of the \"[[Age of Enlightenment]]\", which in large part centered around the application of rational-based principles such as the [[scientific method]] upon human nature, caused increased interest in ethical philosophy as a field of study. Notions of \"benevolence\" attracted widespread attention in terms of governance, with leaders exhorted to act based on idealistic principles and to particularly champion causes such as the facilitating of the arts, increased educational efforts, effective stewardship of national resources, and the like. This movement increased trends away from [[absolute monarchy]] and [[dictatorship]] towards that of [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Republic|republican government]]. The scientifically based, forward thinking viewpoint about human nature became later known as \"[[classical liberalism]]\".{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:Locke-John-LOC.jpg|thumb|right|Philosopher [[John Locke]], a prominent figure of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment era]], articulated a vision of the individual and collective pursuit of ideals arising from the logical study and analysis of the state of nature.<ref name=kant/>]]\n\nModern Western philosophy in terms of its discussion of ideals largely takes place within the framework of Enlightenment thinking. As per the [[United Nations Declaration of Human Rights]], itself an evolution from the earlier [[American Declaration of Independence]] and the [[Constitution of the United States]], many theorizing academics of the 19th century and the 20th century have set forth an optimistic view of humanity; all individuals by nature of their mere existence are thought to have been born inherently good, inherently equal, and inherently free. A defining inflection point of this trend is the experience of [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]], with the experience creating a sort of dualistic approach to [[ideology]] in which [[Capitalism|capitalistic]] [[democracy]] centered around classical liberalism is inherently pitted forever in struggle with [[Tyranny|tyrannies]] centered around mass misery.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the advent of the 21st century, philosophizers have debated the rapid evolution of different cultures, particularly given advancing technology, and the seeming acceptance of egalitarian values previously thought of as radical or undesirable by [[Center-left politics|center-left]], [[Political moderation|moderate]], and [[Center-right politics|center-right]] individuals. The conflict between these people, many of them belonging to younger generations such as the [[Millennial]]s, and those [[Political extremism|political extremists]] of the [[Far-right politics|global far-right movement]], the social trend often called \"[[Neo-nationalism|new nationalism]]\", has defined new distinctions between what it means to be a \"moral idealist\". As well, the question of the fundamental change of humanity itself has attracted much attention; what a [[transhuman]] or even [[posthuman]] individual possesses in terms of ideals in contrast with regular human beings remains an open question.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn the broadest sense, the question of whether or not humanity has fundamentally progressed towards a set of moral ideals as time has passed has never achieved any particular consensus. Examples of philosophers who argue partially in support of the notion include the American thinker [[Richard Rorty]], a figure who has criticized the very concept of unchanging ethical principles set forth in inherent humanity while still lauding general social progress.<ref name=rorty/> Optimistic views sometimes draw from the work of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] religious figure [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]]. He famously stated that humanity will advance in terms of not just scientific development but also idealistic morality to a sort of final oneness regarded by him as the '[[Omega Point]]'.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Recent debates and discussions==\n===In applied ethics===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe specific philosophical school known as \"[[applied ethics]]\" frequently involves discussion over ideals and the desirability of holding to them or abandoning them, depending on the context. In some theories of applied ethics, relative importance gets given to such social orders as a way to [[Dispute resolution|resolve disputes effectively]]. In analysis of [[legal theory]], for instance, a [[judge]] is sometimes called on to resolve the balance between the ideal of [[truth]], which would likely advise hearing out all evidence, and the ideal of fairness, which would likely advise seeking to restore goodwill between individuals regardless of specific findings during a particular case. Said judge may also have to consider the principle of the [[right to a speedy trial]] as well, which places limits on the previous two ideals given the time involved in ferreting out case details.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn an August 2005 address, philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] remarked upon the \"moral idealism common to Platonism, Judaism, and Christianity\" and the related notion of strictly specified principles through the lens of applied ethics, asserting to a group of business professionals,\n{{quote|\"[I]ndividuals become aware of more alternatives, and therefore wiser, as they grow older. The human race as a whole has become wiser as history has moved along. The source of these new alternatives is the human imagination. It is the ability to come up with new ideas, rather than the ability to get in touch with unchanging essences, that is the engine of moral progress.\"<ref name=rorty>https://www.jstor.org/stable/3857921</ref>}}\n\n===In secular ethics===\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nWith the widespread movement away from traditional religious beliefs in both the [[Anglosphere]] and other nations in the 20th century, the question of to what extent the ideals held by the irreligious or even anti-religious owe a debt to particular faith groups has attracted much attention. Specifically, certain authors known as \"[[New atheism|new atheists]]\" such as [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]] have argued that newly emerging forms of [[secular ethics]] constitute an approach of people treating each other that is more logical, just, and reasonable when seen as a rejoiner to previous forms of \"traditional values\". At the same time, multiple thinkers have advocated for moral relativism and a reduced or non-existent sense of holding to previously well-promoted ideals as a direct result of their wholesale rejection of religion.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Appeals to idealism in practice==\n===In conceptual and historical politics===\n\n[[File:Pericles.jpg|thumb|right|Greek statesman [[Pericles]]' vision of [[Athenian democracy]] stressed a sense of what he saw as core ideals, particularly the intelligence and tolerance displayed by Athenians.<ref name=pericles/>]]\n\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdeals have played a role in [[politics]] for [[millennia]]. For example, iconic Greek statesman [[Pericles]] famously presented an ideal-based view of the [[Mediterranean]] world. In 431, shortly after the [[Peloponnesian War]] had started, his 'Funeral Oration' made to commemorate fallen soldiers, described for posterity by the historian [[Thucydides]], presented a view of [[Athens]] and the city-state's broader civilization that emphasized a sense of cleverness and open-mindedness that Pericles believed gave it the strength to rise to different challenges.<ref name=pericles>{{citenews|journal=[[Pbs.org]]|url=https://www.pbs.org/empires/thegreeks/background/36.html|title=Pericles Funeral Oration in Depth|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref> Other early historical figures known for appealing to ethical ideals in their oratory include Roman statesman [[Cato the Elder]], the figure's commentary on [[Hellenic Greece|Hellenized]] values leading to his moral appeal among supporters. In contrast to what he saw as [[decadence]] spreading into [[Rome]] and nearby areas from elsewhere, Cato articulated support for what he labeled as traditional Roman ethics.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nMost political revolutions draw support from the mass appeal of a certain moral idealism in contrast to the doctrines of those holding [[Power (sociology)|power]], having the various grievances with the status quo created from real or perceived misrule spark ethical debate. During the [[French Revolution]], the rhetorical principles of ''\"[[Libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]\"'' (English: ''\"Liberty, Equality, Brotherhood\"'') got raised to the status of clear-cut ideals, the new nation-state constituted a sort of grand experiment in what became in de facto and later de jure a new [[religion]]. Many political movements in modern times center themselves upon multiple ideals found to be reinforcing. A recent example is the [[peace movement]] and the opposition expressed worldwide to [[warfare]] in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]] as well as elsewhere.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn many cases current and historical, one finds instances in which proclaimed ideals simply aren't lived up to by various figures while in office, despite claims made by the officials before taking power and since attaining it. In [[British English]], politicians openly changing their opinions in defiance of previous assertions about their ethics are labeled as making a \"u-turn\". In [[American English]], a similar individual will be pejoratively called a \"flip-flopper\". While different, the terms [[U-turn (politics)|mean the same thing]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIdealism in the context of politics has attracted criticism from multiple fronts. A prominent example is U.S. philosopher [[Gerald Gaus]], the author of ''[[The Tyranny of the Ideal: Justice in a Diverse Society]]'', and his argument that an overriding emphasis on ideals causes individuals to wish for impossible political perfection and thus lose their sense of what constituents practical policy advocacy as well as logical choices during [[Election|elections]]. Gaus makes other warnings such as that people can lose their sense of how much has already been achieved and how well current situations have become in certain circumstances. In general, Gaus advocates for [[compromise]] and incremental socio-political reform.<ref name=will>{{citenews|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/8/4/12376522/political-idealism-enemy|date=August 4, 2016|title=How political idealism leads us astray|accessdate=April 4, 2020|authorlink=Will Wilkinson|first=Will|last=Wilkinson|publisher=[[Vox.com]]}}</ref>\n\n===In traditional achievement===\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}c\n\nIn a less abstract sense, certain famous private individuals can be thought to embody certain ideals due to multiple factors such as their [[courage]], [[intelligence]], [[personal endurance]], and the like. Although existing in real life and thus being subject to complexities that philosophical [[thought experiment]]s often don't feature, these [[moral example]]s can establish a link between dry intellectual principles and broader issues found in regular people's decision making. Naturally, even the famous possess complex and multi-faceted traits and to be considered an ideal usually constitutes a necessary simplification process; with only a few traits on prominent display, they are an easy [[archetype]] from which one can [[Mimicry|mimic]].{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn [[Islam]], for instance, the life of the prophet [[Muhammad]] is held up as \"ideal\", yet all of his words and deeds must be interpreted for believers through the lens of his life's broader path.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n[[File:President George W.

In general, some philosophers have argued that an ideal usually constitutes something more inherent that one can make a [[Habituation|habit]] while virtues, instead, necessarily involve going above and beyond regular decision making in order to actively strive for something, constituting a behavior that's inherently highly difficult to turn into a regular practice.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nKant wrote in his work ''[[Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View]]'' pitting idealism against the enactment of personal [[vice]], arguing,\n{{quote|\"Young man!

Hartman]] has contended that since, colloquially, labeling an entity as ideal means that something is the best member of the set of all things of that class, therefore the term has particular implications when used in an ethical context. For example, the ideal student is the best member of the set of all students in exactly the same way that the ideal circle is the best circle that can be imagined of the class of all circles, according to Hartman. Since one can define the properties that the ideal member of a class should have, Hartman has stated, the value of any actual object can be empirically determined by comparing it to the ideal. The closer an object's actual properties match up to the properties of the ideal, the better the object is to Hartman. Thus, a bumpy circle drawn in the sand is worse than a very smooth one drawn with a compass' aid, but both are better than a regularly made square.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\nFor Hartman, the world in general presents a situation in which each particular entity ought usually to become more like its ideal if possible. This entails that, in [[ethics]], each individual should analogously to become more like the hypothetical ideal person, and a person's morality can actually be measured by examining how close they live up to their ideal self, in Hartman's view.{{fact|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Totalizing ideals versus emergent ideals===\n{{expand-section|date=April 2020}}\nThe question of to what extent one can hold to certain ideals practically and how facing resistance will shape them include philosopher [[Terry Eagleton]]. Writing in his book ''After Theory'', he has commented,\n{{quote|\"Moral values which state what you ought to do are impressively idealistic, but too blatantly at odds with your behaviour.

Upon the actor's death in 2003, journal ''The Guardian'' published a review of his life that labeled him the \"screen epitome of idealistic individualism\"; the actor's [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal values]] became as much a part of his public persona as his film career, Peck particularly taking a stand in his choice of roles against [[antisemitism]].

While the titular inquisitor rationally argues for the relativist view that people seek safety and security over higher callings, Christ surprisingly kisses the aged, emotionally distant leader on the lips; while still holding to his views, the moved inquisitor allows Christ to leave freely.

The grass plot in front of the house surrounded with ever-greens and shrubs, with a ''Gothic'' bench on one side, is very pretty, and the clumps to the water's edge well disposed : From thence, passing by a bridge, you follow the water through a pasture ground, with walks and benches around it; the banks closely shaven, the bends of them natural, and quite in the stile of a real river. About the middle of the field it divides and forms a small island, which contains two or three clumps of shrubs, and is a very great ornament to the place; the walk after-wards leads to the other winding ones around the field, which is certainly laid out in general in a good taste. There are, however, one or two circumstances, that cannot fail of striking every spectator, which, if they were a little altered, would be a great improvement. Directly across the whole runs a common foot-way, which, though walled in, cuts the grounds too much; a broad arch or two thrown over it, well covered with earth and planted with shrubs, would take off the ill effect of crossing this path. In the water is the imitation of a rock, every kind of which is totally unconsonant with the pleasing and agreeable emotions of the gently-winding stream, and smoothly-shaven banks; besides, any rock worth seeing would swallow up this water. In the next place here are some urns, an ornament, when properly disposed, of great efficacy; but close, shaded and sequestered spots, whereon the eye falls by accident, as it were, are the places for urns, and not open lawns, full in view, and to be walked around. It is surprising, that the ideas of imitating nature, in rejecting a strait line for the water, and giving its banks the wave of a real stream, should not be extended to hiding the conclusion, by winding it among the wood where it could not be followed; and it would have been a great improvement, to have given the stream in one place a much greater wave, so as to have enlarged it to four times its present width; this would have added much to the variety of the scene. Lastly, I might remark, that the circular bason near the end of the river has a very bad effect; any water so very artificial, should not be seen with the same eye that views the imitation of a real stream.}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|{{coord|53.7804635|-0.41392538|display=inline|type:landmark|name = Kingtree House (site of)}}, Kingtree House, demolished 1960s.<ref name=\"kht\"/>|group=\"map\"}}\n\n{{quote|\"At this place Mr. Watson has a pleasure-ground, which is very well worth seeing; it consists of shrubberies with winding walks, and the imitation of a meandering river through the whole...\"|[[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]]| A six months tour through the north of England.<ref name=\"watsonshrub\"/>}}\n\n[[File:Snuff Mill House - geograph.org.uk - 384243.jpg|Snuff Mill House, built 1750 (2007)|thumb|upright]]\n[[Snuff (tobacco)|Snuff]] was manufactured in the south of the village in the 18th&nbsp;century; towards the end of the century a large mill owned by [[Quaker]] William Travis was producing 15&nbsp;hundredweight of snuff per week.<ref name=\"c1797\"/><ref>{{cite book| url =https://archive.org/details/generalconcisehi00shea|title= General and concise history and description of the town and port of Kingston-upon-Hull |first = James Joseph |last = Sheahan| publisher = Simpkin, Marshall & Co.| year = 1864| page = [https://archive.org/details/generalconcisehi00shea/page/303 303]}}</ref> William Travis had a three storied house built in 1750 next to the mill.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1103397|desc=Snuff Mill House and railings|accessdate=4 December 2012| fewer-links=y}}</ref><ref group=\"map\">{{coord|53.7768|-0.4084|display=inline|type:landmark|name = Snuff Mill House}}, Snuff Mill House</ref>\n\nThe road from Cottingham to Hull connected with the Hull to Beverley Road (turnpiked by Act of 1744) at [[Newland, Kingston upon Hull|Newland]] toll bar; it was turnpiked as an extension of the Hull to Beverley Road in 1764.

The grass plot in front of the house surrounded with ever-greens and shrubs, with a ''Gothic'' bench on one side, is very pretty, and the clumps to the water's edge well disposed : From thence, passing by a bridge, you follow the water through a pasture ground, with walks and benches around it; the banks closely shaven, the bends of them natural, and quite in the stile of a real river. About the middle of the field it divides and forms a small island, which contains two or three clumps of shrubs, and is a very great ornament to the place; the walk after-wards leads to the other winding ones around the field, which is certainly laid out in general in a good taste. There are, however, one or two circumstances, that cannot fail of striking every spectator, which, if they were a little altered, would be a great improvement. Directly across the whole runs a common foot-way, which, though walled in, cuts the grounds too much; a broad arch or two thrown over it, well covered with earth and planted with shrubs, would take off the ill effect of crossing this path. In the water is the imitation of a rock, every kind of which is totally unconsonant with the pleasing and agreeable emotions of the gently-winding stream, and smoothly-shaven banks; besides, any rock worth seeing would swallow up this water. In the next place here are some urns, an ornament, when properly disposed, of great efficacy; but close, shaded and sequestered spots, whereon the eye falls by accident, as it were, are the places for urns, and not open lawns, full in view, and to be walked around. It is surprising, that the ideas of imitating nature, in rejecting a strait line for the water, and giving its banks the wave of a real stream, should not be extended to hiding the conclusion, by winding it among the wood where it could not be followed; and it would have been a great improvement, to have given the stream in one place a much greater wave, so as to have enlarged it to four times its present width; this would have added much to the variety of the scene. Lastly, I might remark, that the circular bason near the end of the river has a very bad effect; any water so very artificial, should not be seen with the same eye that views the imitation of a real stream.}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|{{coord|53.7804635|-0.41392538|display=inline|type:landmark|name = Kingtree House (site of)}}, Kingtree House, demolished 1960s.<ref name=\"kht\"/>|group=\"map\"}}\n\n{{quote|\"At this place Mr. Watson has a pleasure-ground, which is very well worth seeing; it consists of shrubberies with winding walks, and the imitation of a meandering river through the whole...\"|[[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]]| A six months tour through the north of England.<ref name=\"watsonshrub\"/>}}\n\n[[File:Snuff Mill House - geograph.org.uk - 384243.jpg|Snuff Mill House, built 1750 (2007)|thumb|upright]]\n[[Snuff (tobacco)|Snuff]] was manufactured in the south of the village in the 18th&nbsp;century; towards the end of the century a large mill owned by [[Quaker]] William Travis was producing 15&nbsp;hundredweight of snuff per week.<ref name=\"c1797\"/><ref>{{cite book| url =https://archive.org/details/generalconcisehi00shea|title= General and concise history and description of the town and port of Kingston-upon-Hull |first = James Joseph |last = Sheahan| publisher = Simpkin, Marshall & Co.| year = 1864| page = [https://archive.org/details/generalconcisehi00shea/page/303 303]}}</ref> William Travis had a three storied house built in 1750 next to the mill.<ref>{{NHLE|num=1103397|desc=Snuff Mill House and railings|accessdate=4 December 2012| fewer-links=y}}</ref><ref group=\"map\">{{coord|53.7768|-0.4084|display=inline|type:landmark|name = Snuff Mill House}}, Snuff Mill House</ref>\n\nThe road from Cottingham to Hull connected with the Hull to Beverley Road (turnpiked by Act of 1744) at [[Newland, Kingston upon Hull|Newland]] toll bar; it was turnpiked as an extension of the Hull to Beverley Road in 1764.
