In 1870 with Rs.21,000 capital, he founded a trading company. Further he bought a bankrupt oil mill at [[Chinchpokli]] and converted it into a cotton mill, under the name Alexandra Mill which he sold for a profit after 2 years. In 1874, he set up another cotton mill at [[Nagpur]] named Empress Mill. He dreamed of achieving 4 goals, setting up an iron and steel company, a unique hotel, a world-class learning institution and a hydro-electric plant. During his lifetime, in 1903, the [[The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel|Taj Mahal Hotel]] at [[Colaba]] waterfront was opened making it the first hotel with electricity in India.\n\n=== 1904\u20131938 ===\nAfter Jamsetji's death, his older son [[Dorabji Tata]] became the Chairman in 1904. Sir Dorabji established the Tata Iron and Steel company (TISCO), now known as [[Tata Steel]] in 1907. Marking the group's global ambitions, Tata Limited opened its first overseas office in [[London]]. Following the founder's goals, Western India's first hydro plant was brought to life, giving birth to [[Tata Power]]. Yet another dream, Indian Institute of Science was established with the first batch admitted in 1911.\n\n=== 1938\u20131991 ===\n[[J. R. D. Tata|JRD Tata]] was made Chairman of the Tata Group in 1938. Under his chairmanship, the assets of the Tata Group grew from US$101 million to over US$5 billion. Starting with 14 enterprises, upon his departure half a century later in 1988, Tata Sons had grown to a conglomerate of 95 enterprises. These enterprises consisted of ventures that the company had either started or in which they held controlling interest. New sectors such as chemicals, technology, cosmetics, marketing, engineering, and manufacturing, tea, and software services earned them recognition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tata-Group|title=Tata Group {{!}} History, Companies, Subsidiaries, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952, JRD founded an airline, known as [[Air India|Tata Air Services]] (later renamed Tata Airlines). In 1953, the Government of India passed the Air Corporations Act and purchased a majority stake in the carrier from [[Tata Sons]], though JRD Tata would continue as Chairman till 1977.\n\nIn 1945, [[Tata Motors]] was founded, first focused on locomotives. In 1954, it entered the commercial vehicle market after forming a joint venture with [[Daimler-Benz]]. In 1968, [[Tata Consultancy Services]] was founded.\n\n=== From 1991 till present ===\nIn 1991, [[Ratan Tata]] was made Chairman of Tata Group. This was also the year of [[Economic liberalisation in India|economic liberalization in India]], opening up the market to foreign competitors. During this time, Tata Group began to acquire a number of companies, including [[Tetley]] (2000), [[Tata Steel Europe|Corus Group]] (2007), and [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] and [[Land Rover]] (2008).

In 1870 with Rs.21,000 capital, he founded a trading company. Further he bought a bankrupt oil mill at [[Chinchpokli]] and converted it into a cotton mill, under the name Alexandra Mill which he sold for a profit after 2 years. In 1874, he set up another cotton mill at [[Nagpur]] named Empress Mill. He dreamed of achieving 4 goals, setting up an iron and steel company, a unique hotel, a world-class learning institution and a hydro-electric plant. During his lifetime, in 1903, the [[The Taj Mahal Palace Hotel|Taj Mahal Hotel]] at [[Colaba]] waterfront was opened making it the first hotel with electricity in India.\n\n=== 1904\u20131938 ===\nAfter Jamsetji's death, his older son [[Dorabji Tata]] became the Chairman in 1904. Sir Dorabji established the Tata Iron and Steel company (TISCO), now known as [[Tata Steel]] in 1907. Marking the group's global ambitions, Tata Limited opened its first overseas office in [[London]]. Following the founder's goals, Western India's first hydro plant was brought to life, giving birth to [[Tata Power]]. Yet another dream, Indian Institute of Science was established with the first batch admitted in 1911.\n\n=== 1938\u20131991 ===\n[[J. R. D. Tata|JRD Tata]] was made Chairman of the Tata Group in 1938. Under his chairmanship, the assets of the Tata Group grew from US$101 million to over US$5 billion. Starting with 14 enterprises, upon his departure half a century later in 1988, Tata Sons had grown to a conglomerate of 95 enterprises. These enterprises consisted of ventures that the company had either started or in which they held controlling interest. New sectors such as chemicals, technology, cosmetics, marketing, engineering, and manufacturing, tea, and software services earned them recognition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tata-Group|title=Tata Group {{!}} History, Companies, Subsidiaries, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1952, JRD founded an airline, known as [[Air India|Tata Air Services]] (later renamed Tata Airlines). In 1953, the Government of India passed the Air Corporations Act and purchased a majority stake in the carrier from [[Tata Sons]], though JRD Tata would continue as Chairman till 1977.\n\nIn 1945, [[Tata Motors]] was founded, first focused on locomotives. In 1954, it entered the commercial vehicle market after forming a joint venture with [[Daimler-Benz]]. In 1968, [[Tata Consultancy Services]] was founded.\n\n=== From 1991 till present ===\nIn 1991, [[Ratan Tata]] was made Chairman of Tata Group.

Stewart]]. Their [[speedometer]]s were used in the [[Ford Model T]]. In 1912 John Stewart joined with [[Edgar Bassick]] to make vehicle instruments and horns. Bassick owned Alemite Co. and Stewart had bought the Warner Instrument Company; thus the name was changed to the Stewart-Warner Corporation. The company started in [[Chicago]] and built a manufacturing plant on [[Diversey Parkway]]. The building kept expanding and finally covered one million square feet (93,000 m\u00b2) and six floors. At its peak S-W employed 6000 people at the Diversey complex.<ref>\"A Plan for Stewart Warner Site,\" ''Chicago Tribune'', June 17, 1993</ref> They also made [[radio]]s and [[refrigerator]]s, among other products, and produced the ubiquitous \"zerk\" [[grease fitting]], named after its inventor, associated with the company. In the last years of the company's Chicago factory, it owned a number of aging six-spindle [[Brown & Sharpe]] and New Britain screw machines.\n\nStewart-Warner had other locations, including at 2600 North Pulaski in Chicago, and in later years a distribution center in Elgin, Illinois, located just south of I-90 and east of Rt. 25.<ref>''The Milwaukee Road in Chicago''; book published by the Milwaukee Road Historical Association, 2007, Special Publication Number 6</ref> The company also opened a plant in Harlow, Essex, England in the late 1950s, which became its European headquarters.  Stan Hagerman initially was Director of the UK plant, followed by Curtis W. Van Allen in 1960, who later became Vice President and General Manager of International Operations in Chicago.\n\nThe Diversey Parkway complex was the site of both S-W's international headquarters and the Instrument & Alemite manufacturing operations.  \"Alemite\" referred to S-W's line of lubricating stations, and \"Instruments\" referred to speedometers and similar gauges. The front that faced Diversey was the location of corporate offices, while to the rear was manufacturing with a warehouse south of Diversey. A large employee cafeteria was inside the main building, which also included an underground garage for executives (including CEO Bennett Archambault, who arrived each morning by limousine) with an entrance off Wolcott just north of Diversey. Corporate archives were housed in the basement below the main tower, and executive offices were in the top floors of the tower.  Stewart-Warner operated a free shuttle van service for employees who commuted by train to and from the Clybourn Metra (C&NW) station. In 1981 S-W experienced a labor strike at the Chicago operations.<ref>Ackland, Len (1981-03-25). \"Union votes to end strike at Stewart\". ''Chicago Tribune''. p. 3, section 4 .</ref> The Elgin site was eventually taken over by [[Middleby Corporation]].\n\nThe main Chicago plant and headquarters of Stewart-Warner along Diversey Parkway in Chicago were located in the Deering Industrial Area in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood.  As such, S-W was served by both the Chicago and North Western Railroad on the north side, and by both the Milwaukee Road and C&NW on the south end at the warehouse north of Clybourn and east of Wolcott.  In later years S-W was served by only the C&NW off tracks along the east side of the S-W plant and parallel to the C&NW North Line.<ref>\"The Chicago Files: Milwaukee Road's Deering Line;\" Tom Burke, author, Spring 2006 edition of ''The Milwaukee Railroader'' historical journal.  Published by the Milwaukee Railroad Historical Association.</ref>\n\nThe company also made heat exchangers starting in the 1940s under the South Wind Division, but after then, it became independent of its parent. Stewart-Warner ranked 95th among United States corporations in the value of [[World War II]] military production contracts.<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]], ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.619</ref>  The Stewart-Warner name is still in use, but there is no corporate link to the original S-W, and the website is hyphenated: http://www.stewart-warner.com.\n\nStewart-Warner was also a manufacturer and distributor of scoreboards, beginning in 1966.  Scoreboards created and installed by Stewart-Warner during the 1960s and 1970s included those at [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]]; [[Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium]]; [[Fenway Park]] in [[Boston]], [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] in [[Detroit]]; [[Exhibition Stadium]] in [[Toronto]]; [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], [[Anaheim Stadium]], [[Arrowhead Stadium]] and [[Royals Stadium]] in [[Kansas City]]; [[Aloha Stadium]] in [[Honolulu]]; [[Giants Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]; [[McNichols Sports Arena]] and [[Mile High Stadium]] in [[Denver]]; [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] in [[Wisconsin]]; [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]]; [[Veterans Stadium]] and the [[Spectrum (arena)|Spectrum]] in [[Philadelphia]]; Busch Stadium in St. Louis; and the [[Capital Centre (Landover, Maryland)|Capital Centre]] in [[Landover, Maryland]].  The latter featured the first videoscreen in a stadium or arena, the Telscreen.  Perhaps most famously, Stewart-Warner supplied the scoreboards for the six stadia that hosted the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Argentina]] as a joint venture with Argentinian state company Autotrol.\n\n[[File:7407 SW 7405 package top.jpg|thumb|Stewart-Warner [[7400 Series]] integrated circuit]]\nIn 1963,<ref>{{cite book |last=Braun |first=Ernest |date=1982 |title=Revolution in Miniature: The History and Impact of Semiconductor Electronics |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=03c4wldf-k4C&pg=PA127&lpg=PA127&dq=stewart-warner+microcircuits&source=bl&ots=ZY6CvMUJGO&sig=rdD8_bMvas26UGEzf1u_20dZgmM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiH59iE09XVAhVJ0FQKHY4rALMQ6AEITTAI#v=onepage&q=stewart-warner%20microcircuits&f=false|publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=127 |isbn=0521289033}}</ref> Stewart-Warner established an integrated circuit fabrication facility, Stewart-Warner Microcircuits, in [[Sunnyvale]], California.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dummer |first=G.

Stewart]]. Their [[speedometer]]s were used in the [[Ford Model T]]. In 1912 John Stewart joined with [[Edgar Bassick]] to make vehicle instruments and horns. Bassick owned Alemite Co. and Stewart had bought the Warner Instrument Company; thus the name was changed to the Stewart-Warner Corporation. The company started in [[Chicago]] and built a manufacturing plant on [[Diversey Parkway]]. The building kept expanding and finally covered one million square feet (93,000 m\u00b2) and six floors. At its peak S-W employed 6000 people at the Diversey complex.<ref>\"A Plan for Stewart Warner Site,\" ''Chicago Tribune'', June 17, 1993</ref> They also made [[radio]]s and [[refrigerator]]s, among other products, and produced the ubiquitous \"zerk\" [[grease fitting]], named after its inventor, associated with the company. In the last years of the company's Chicago factory, it owned a number of aging six-spindle [[Brown & Sharpe]] and New Britain screw machines.\n\nStewart-Warner had other locations, including at 2600 North Pulaski in Chicago, and in later years a distribution center in Elgin, Illinois, located just south of I-90 and east of Rt. 25.<ref>''The Milwaukee Road in Chicago''; book published by the Milwaukee Road Historical Association, 2007, Special Publication Number 6</ref> The company also opened a plant in Harlow, Essex, England in the late 1950s, which became its European headquarters.  Stan Hagerman initially was Director of the UK plant, followed by Curtis W. Van Allen in 1960, who later became Vice President and General Manager of International Operations in Chicago.\n\nThe Diversey Parkway complex was the site of both S-W's international headquarters and the Instrument & Alemite manufacturing operations.  \"Alemite\" referred to S-W's line of lubricating stations, and \"Instruments\" referred to speedometers and similar gauges. The front that faced Diversey was the location of corporate offices, while to the rear was manufacturing with a warehouse south of Diversey. A large employee cafeteria was inside the main building, which also included an underground garage for executives (including CEO Bennett Archambault, who arrived each morning by limousine) with an entrance off Wolcott just north of Diversey. Corporate archives were housed in the basement below the main tower, and executive offices were in the top floors of the tower.  Stewart-Warner operated a free shuttle van service for employees who commuted by train to and from the Clybourn Metra (C&NW) station. In 1981 S-W experienced a labor strike at the Chicago operations.<ref>Ackland, Len (1981-03-25). \"Union votes to end strike at Stewart\". ''Chicago Tribune''. p. 3, section 4 .</ref> The Elgin site was eventually taken over by [[Middleby Corporation]].\n\nThe main Chicago plant and headquarters of Stewart-Warner along Diversey Parkway in Chicago were located in the Deering Industrial Area in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood.  As such, S-W was served by both the Chicago and North Western Railroad on the north side, and by both the Milwaukee Road and C&NW on the south end at the warehouse north of Clybourn and east of Wolcott.  In later years S-W was served by only the C&NW off tracks along the east side of the S-W plant and parallel to the C&NW North Line.<ref>\"The Chicago Files: Milwaukee Road's Deering Line;\" Tom Burke, author, Spring 2006 edition of ''The Milwaukee Railroader'' historical journal.  Published by the Milwaukee Railroad Historical Association.</ref>\n\nThe company also made heat exchangers starting in the 1940s under the South Wind Division, but after then, it became independent of its parent. Stewart-Warner ranked 95th among United States corporations in the value of [[World War II]] military production contracts.<ref>[[Whiz Kids (Department of Defense)|Peck, Merton J.]] & [[Frederic M. Scherer|Scherer, Frederic M.]], ''The Weapons Acquisition Process: An Economic Analysis'' (1962) [[Harvard Business School]] p.619</ref>  The Stewart-Warner name is still in use, but there is no corporate link to the original S-W, and the website is hyphenated: http://www.stewart-warner.com.\n\nStewart-Warner was also a manufacturer and distributor of scoreboards, beginning in 1966.  Scoreboards created and installed by Stewart-Warner during the 1960s and 1970s included those at [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Uniondale, New York]]; [[Atlanta\u2013Fulton County Stadium]]; [[Fenway Park]] in [[Boston]], [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]] in [[Detroit]]; [[Exhibition Stadium]] in [[Toronto]]; [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], [[Anaheim Stadium]], [[Arrowhead Stadium]] and [[Royals Stadium]] in [[Kansas City]]; [[Aloha Stadium]] in [[Honolulu]]; [[Giants Stadium]] in [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]; [[McNichols Sports Arena]] and [[Mile High Stadium]] in [[Denver]]; [[Milwaukee County Stadium]] in [[Wisconsin]]; [[Three Rivers Stadium]] in [[Pittsburgh]]; [[Veterans Stadium]] and the [[Spectrum (arena)|Spectrum]] in [[Philadelphia]]; Busch Stadium in St. Louis; and the [[Capital Centre]] in [[Landover, Maryland]].  The latter featured the first videoscreen in a stadium or arena, the Telscreen.  Perhaps most famously, Stewart-Warner supplied the scoreboards for the six stadia that hosted the [[1978 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Argentina]] as a joint venture with Argentinian state company Autotrol.\n\n[[File:7407 SW 7405 package top.jpg|thumb|Stewart-Warner [[7400 Series]] integrated circuit]]\nIn 1963,<ref>{{cite book |last=Braun |first=Ernest |date=1982 |title=Revolution in Miniature: The History and Impact of Semiconductor Electronics |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=03c4wldf-k4C&pg=PA127&lpg=PA127&dq=stewart-warner+microcircuits&source=bl&ots=ZY6CvMUJGO&sig=rdD8_bMvas26UGEzf1u_20dZgmM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiH59iE09XVAhVJ0FQKHY4rALMQ6AEITTAI#v=onepage&q=stewart-warner%20microcircuits&f=false|publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=127 |isbn=0521289033}}</ref> Stewart-Warner established an integrated circuit fabrication facility, Stewart-Warner Microcircuits, in [[Sunnyvale]], California.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dummer |first=G.

He won the vacant [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[heavyweight]] title in 1968 by defeating [[Jerry Quarry]], making one successful title defense in the same year against [[Floyd Patterson]], before losing to [[Joe Frazier]] in 1970.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born one of ten children. His father, Walter, was a pastor, and Ellis was brought up as a Christian.<ref>Courier Journal</ref> As a teenager he worked in a cement finishing factory.<ref>New York Times</ref> He also sang in the local church choir, later joined by his wife Mary. He continued church involvement all his adult life. In his youth he admired the boxer [[Joe Louis]].<ref>New York Times, 6 May 2014</ref>\n\n==Amateur career==\nEllis got into boxing as a teenager after watching a friend box fellow [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] youngster [[Muhammad Ali]] (then known as Cassius Clay) on a local amateur boxing television show called [[Tomorrow's Champions]]. \"I had a friend of mine named Donnie Hall, and he fought Ali,\" Ellis said. \"Donnie lost, and I thought I could maybe be a fighter then.\" Ellis went with Hall to Louisville's Columbia Gym, where the coach was a police officer named [[Joe Elsby Martin, Sr.|Joe Martin]].<ref>[http://www.thomloverro.com/2004.htm The ''Washington Times'' \u2013 July 31, 2004]</ref>\n\nEllis won 59 of 66 amateur bouts and was a [[Golden Gloves]] champion. He boxed Ali twice as an amateur, with Ali winning the first bout and Ellis winning the second.\n\n==Professional career==\nEllis turned professional as a [[middleweight]] in 1961. Early in his pro career, he was trained and managed by [[Bud Bruner]]. With Bruner, he compiled a record of 15\u20135 (6 KOs). His five losses were decisions to top Middleweight contenders Holly Mims (whom he defeated in a rematch), Henry Hank, [[Rubin Carter|Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter]], [[Don Fullmer]], and [[George Benton]]. This start probably helped his speed of punch, movement and finesse.\n\nAt the end of 1964, after losing three out of four fights, Ellis decided to leave Bruner. He later recalled Bruner fondly. \"I liked him, and I fought a lot of top-rated fighters when I was with him, but eventually I had to move on,\" Ellis said. \"He did me justice, and we always remained friends.\"<ref>The ''Courier-Journal'' \u2013 February 23, 1996</ref>\n\nEllis wrote a letter to an at first skeptical<ref>New York Times 6 may 2014</ref> [[Angelo Dundee]], the trainer of Ali, and asked him to handle his career. Dundee agreed to be both manager and trainer. Ellis became a sparring partner for Ali and fought on several of Ali's early pre-world championship undercards. Six of his first eight fights with Dundee were on an Ali undercards.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1080682/1/index.htm ''Sports Illustrated'' \u2013 December 11, 1967]</ref>\n\nBy the mid 1960s Ellis was fighting heavyweights. Being a tall natural athletic build he'd had increasing trouble keeping down to middleweight. [[Dr. Ferdie Pacheco]], who worked with both Ali & Ellis throughout their careers, called Ellis's development from middleweight to heavyweight one of the most dramatic he could recall.<ref>Ferdie's book ''Fight Doctor''</ref>\n\n===WBA heavyweight title eliminator matches===\nBy 1966, Ellis was fighting as a heavyweight. When Ali was stripped of the world title for refusing to enter the military, the [[World Boxing Association]] staged an eight-man tournament that featured most of the top heavyweight contenders. Ellis, who was ranked eighth in the world after eight consecutive wins, was invited to be in the tournament. [[Joe Frazier]], ranked second by the WBA, chose not to participate in the tournament. Instead, Frazier fought for the vacant [[New York State Athletic Commission]] World Heavyweight Championship, which he won with an eleventh-round knockout of [[Buster Mathis]].\n\nIn the opening round of the tournament, Ellis fought [[Leotis Martin]] on August 5, 1967 in [[Houston, Texas]]. Ellis, the betting underdog, battered Martin's face into a bloody mask, and the referee stopped the fight in the ninth round.\n\nEllis met [[Oscar Bonavena]] in the second round of the tournament. The fight took place on December 2, 1967 in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. Ellis, once again the underdog, dropped Bonavena with a right once in the third round and once in the tenth. After twelve rounds, Ellis was awarded a unanimous decision. This fight was regarded as one of the best of his career. He seemed to be in control for most of the fight apart from the ninth round. Ellis advanced to the tournament final.<ref>Boxing history by Sam Andre, Hamlyn publisher.

A cautious Ellis won a 15-round split decision<ref>Sam Andre's Pictorial History of Boxing</ref> to capture the vacant WBA Heavyweight Championship. Quarry said, \"If they'd given me the decision, I'd have given it back.

Ellis, who suffered a broken nose in the second round, was awarded the decision by the referee, the sole judge. Many in the crowd of 30,000 disagreed with the decision and started chanting, \"Floyd champ!\" The ''[[New York Times]]'' scored the fight seven rounds to six for Ellis, with two even.<ref>The ''New York Times'' \u2013 September 15, 1968</ref>\n\nFollowing the defeat of Patterson, Ellis was out of the ring for seventeen months. He was going to fight [[Henry Cooper]] in the United Kingdom, even though the [[British Boxing Board of Control]] refused to recognize the fight as a world title bout: the BBBofC was affiliated with the [[World Boxing Council]], who stated that they would only recognize a fight between Joe Frazier and a suitable contender as being for the world title. The fight was postponed a couple of times and eventually cancelled because Cooper injured his knee.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=abYlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8_QFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2347,5330686&dq=jimmy+ellis+henry+cooper+recognize&hl=en ''Washington Afro-American'' \u2013 September 30, 1969]</ref>  Ellis then planned to fight Bob Cleroux in [[Montreal]], but Cleroux lost what was supposed to be a tune-up fight against the lightly regarded Billy Joiner.

The undefeated Frazier, a heavy betting favorite, proved to be too strong and powerful. Ellis, who had never been floored as a heavyweight, was knocked down twice in the fourth round by a relentless Frazier, and Angelo Dundee stopped the fight before the start of the fifth round. <ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jimmy-ellis-boxer-who-became-world-heavyweight-champion-and-close-friend-sparring-partner-and-ring-9356810.html ''The Independent'' \u2013 May 12, 2014]</ref> It was the first knockout loss for Ellis.\n\n===Ellis vs. Ali===\nAfter winning his next three fights, Ellis fought Muhammad Ali in the [[Houston Astrodome]] on July 26, 1971. Angelo Dundee chose to work with Ellis for the fight. He was Ali's trainer, but he was both manager and trainer for Ellis. Working with Ellis meant that he would get a bigger share of the purse. Ali accepted the arrangement and got Harry Wiley, who had worked with [[Henry Armstrong]] and [[Sugar Ray Robinson]], to be his trainer for the Ellis fight.<ref>[http://www.secondsout.com/features/main-features/muhammad-ali-vs-jimmy-ellis-the-inevitable-fight---40-years-on Muhammad Ali vs. Jimmy Ellis: The Inevitable Fight \u2013 40 Years On]</ref>\n\nEllis fought well over the first three rounds, but the fight turned after Ellis was hurt by a right hand in the fourth round. The right hand \"hurt me so bad I couldn't really fight my best after that,\" Ellis said. \"It ruined me.\" The referee stopped the fight in the twelfth round as Ellis remained on his feet. No knockdowns were recorded throughout the fight.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1085128/index.htm ''Sports Illustrated'' \u2013 August 2, 1971]</ref>\n\n===Diminishing skills===\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}\nAfter the loss to Ali, Ellis won his next eight fights by knockout. But on June 18, 1973, he fought [[Earnie Shavers]], who was 44\u20132 (43 KOs), at Madison Square Garden. Ellis, ranked fourth by the WBA, stunned Shavers with a chopping right to the jaw and backed him into a corner. Shavers took numerous shots in the corner before clinching. After the referee separated the fighters, Shavers put Ellis down for the count with a powerful single right uppercut to the chin. The time was 2:39 in the first round.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TIgxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xqEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6581,1058082&dq=shavers+jimmy+ellis&hl=en The ''Montreal Gazette'' \u2013 June 19, 1973]</ref>\n\nEllis came back with a knockout win against [[club fighter]] Memphis Al Jones, but with his skills in decline, he went winless in his next five fights. He lost a split decision to [[Boone Kirkman]], fought a draw with Larry Middleton, dropped decisions to [[Ron Lyle]] and [[Joe Bugner]], and was stopped in nine rounds in a rematch with [[Joe Frazier]].\n\nThe rematch with [[Joe Frazier]] took place in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], on March 2, 1975. Ellis trained at the Golden Bowl Gym in Camberwell, Melbourne with martial arts 4th Dan Gerry Scaife. Ellis won the first three rounds, but Frazier then picked up the intensity and took control. With Ellis bloody and battered, Angelo Dundee signaled for referee [[Bob Foster (boxer)|Bob Foster]] to stop the fight in the ninth round.\n\n===Retirement===\nOn May 6, 1975, in what would be his last fight, Ellis knocked out club fighter [[Carl Baker (boxer)|Carl Baker]] in the first round. He retired aged 35 after suffering a training injury that left him partially blind in his left eye. Ellis finished with a record of 40\u201312\u20131 (24 KOs).\n\n==Later life==\nAfter retiring from boxing, Ellis trained boxers. Later he worked for the Louisville Parks Department on athletic and recreational projects between 1989 and 2003.<ref>''New York Times'', 6 May 2014</ref> In 2004, Ellis told the ''Washington Times'' \"...All I ever wanted to be was a good fighter and good man.'<ref>''New York Times'', 6 May 2014</ref> He seemed to achieve it. Brother Jeff gave a tribute on his death saying \" He was someone you could model yourself on\"<ref>Wiky sports, May 2014</ref> Ellis was a reserved family man who shunned flash although had a determined competitive streak in boxing.\n\nWith wife Mary he had six children,2 sons and 4 daughters. His brother Charles boxed in the 1964 Olympics.\nEllis was personally kind and gracious. He maintained a brotherly relationship with Ali over all the decades. Ali himself often recalled Ellis as a great friend. Ellis wasn't always pleased by the sparring partner tag but felt he had proved himself above that.<ref>''New York Times'' 6 May 2014</ref>\n\nHe suffered from [[dementia pugilistica]], for over a

24, 1940 \u2013 May 6, 2014) was a mid-20th century American [[professional boxer]]. He won the vacant [[World Boxing Association|WBA]] [[heavyweight]] title in 1968 by defeating [[Jerry Quarry]], making one successful title defense in the same year against [[Floyd Patterson]], before losing to [[Joe Frazier]] in 1970.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born one of ten children. His father, Walter, was a pastor, and Ellis was brought up as a Christian.<ref>Courier Journal</ref> As a teenager he worked in a cement finishing factory.<ref>New York Times</ref> He also sang in the local church choir, later joined by his wife Mary. He continued church involvement all his adult life. In his youth he admired the boxer [[Joe Louis]].<ref>New York Times, 6 May 2014</ref>\n\n==Amateur career==\nEllis got into boxing as a teenager after watching a friend box fellow [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]] youngster [[Muhammad Ali]] (then known as Cassius Clay) on a local amateur boxing television show called [[Tomorrow's Champions]]. \"I had a friend of mine named Donnie Hall, and he fought Ali,\" Ellis said. \"Donnie lost, and I thought I could maybe be a fighter then.\" Ellis went with Hall to Louisville's Columbia Gym, where the coach was a police officer named [[Joe Elsby Martin, Sr.|Joe Martin]].<ref>[http://www.thomloverro.com/2004.htm The ''Washington Times'' \u2013 July 31, 2004]</ref>\n\nEllis won 59 of 66 amateur bouts and was a [[Golden Gloves]] champion. He boxed Ali twice as an amateur, with Ali winning the first bout and Ellis winning the second.\n\n==Professional career==\nEllis turned professional as a [[middleweight]] in 1961. Early in his pro career, he was trained and managed by [[Bud Bruner]]. With Bruner, he compiled a record of 15\u20135 (6 KOs). His five losses were decisions to top Middleweight contenders Holly Mims (whom he defeated in a rematch), Henry Hank, [[Rubin Carter|Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter]], [[Don Fullmer]], and [[George Benton]]. This start probably helped his speed of punch, movement and finesse.\n\nAt the end of 1964, after losing three out of four fights, Ellis decided to leave Bruner. He later recalled Bruner fondly. \"I liked him, and I fought a lot of top-rated fighters when I was with him, but eventually I had to move on,\" Ellis said. \"He did me justice, and we always remained friends.\"<ref>The ''Courier-Journal'' \u2013 February 23, 1996</ref>\n\nEllis wrote a letter to an at first skeptical<ref>New York Times 6 may 2014</ref> [[Angelo Dundee]], the trainer of Ali, and asked him to handle his career. Dundee agreed to be both manager and trainer. Ellis became a sparring partner for Ali and fought on several of Ali's early pre-world championship undercards. Six of his first eight fights with Dundee were on an Ali undercards.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1080682/1/index.htm ''Sports Illustrated'' \u2013 December 11, 1967]</ref>\n\nBy the mid 1960s Ellis was fighting heavyweights. Being a tall natural athletic build he'd had increasing trouble keeping down to middleweight. [[Dr. Ferdie Pacheco]], who worked with both Ali & Ellis throughout their careers, called Ellis's development from middleweight to heavyweight one of the most dramatic he could recall.<ref>Ferdie's book ''Fight Doctor''</ref>\n\n===WBA heavyweight title eliminator matches===\nBy 1966, Ellis was fighting as a heavyweight. When Ali was stripped of the world title for refusing to enter the military, the [[World Boxing Association]] staged an eight-man tournament that featured most of the top heavyweight contenders. Ellis, who was ranked eighth in the world after eight consecutive wins, was invited to be in the tournament. [[Joe Frazier]], ranked second by the WBA, chose not to participate in the tournament. Instead, Frazier fought for the vacant [[New York State Athletic Commission]] World Heavyweight Championship, which he won with an eleventh-round knockout of [[Buster Mathis]].\n\nIn the opening round of the tournament, Ellis fought [[Leotis Martin]] on August 5, 1967 in [[Houston, Texas]]. Ellis, the betting underdog, battered Martin's face into a bloody mask, and the referee stopped the fight in the ninth round.\n\nEllis met [[Oscar Bonavena]] in the second round of the tournament. The fight took place on December 2, 1967 in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. Ellis, once again the underdog, dropped Bonavena with a right once in the third round and once in the tenth. After twelve rounds, Ellis was awarded a unanimous decision. This fight was regarded as one of the best of his career. He seemed to be in control for most of the fight apart from the ninth round. Ellis advanced to the tournament final.<ref>Boxing history by Sam Andre, Hamlyn publisher.

Ellis, who suffered a broken nose in the second round, was awarded the decision by the referee, the sole judge. Many in the crowd of 30,000 disagreed with the decision and started chanting, \"Floyd champ!\" The ''[[New York Times]]'' scored the fight seven rounds to six for Ellis, with two even.<ref>The ''New York Times'' \u2013 September 15, 1968</ref>\n\nFollowing the defeat of Patterson, Ellis was out of the ring for seventeen months. He was going to fight [[Henry Cooper]] in the United Kingdom, even though the [[British Boxing Board of Control]] refused to recognize the fight as a world title bout: the BBBofC was affiliated with the [[World Boxing Council]], who stated that they would only recognize a fight between Joe Frazier and a suitable contender as being for the world title. The fight was postponed a couple of times and eventually cancelled because Cooper injured his knee.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=abYlAAAAIBAJ&sjid=8_QFAAAAIBAJ&pg=2347,5330686&dq=jimmy+ellis+henry+cooper+recognize&hl=en ''Washington Afro-American'' \u2013 September 30, 1969]</ref>  Ellis then planned to fight Bob Cleroux in [[Montreal]], but Cleroux lost what was supposed to be a tune-up fight against the lightly regarded Billy Joiner. Finally, Ellis was going to fight [[Gregorio Peralta]] in [[Argentina]], but promoters canceled the fight 24 hours before it was to take place because of poor ticket sales.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=CnoyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HrkFAAAAIBAJ&pg=890,4475902&dq=jimmy+ellis+cleroux+joiner&hl=en ''The Montreal Gazette'' \u2013 July 22, 1971]</ref><ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sMYQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=z5ADAAAAIBAJ&pg=4233,4108700&dq=peralta+jimmy+ellis&hl=en ''The Age'' \u2013 December 23, 1969]</ref>\n\n===Unification title match with Joe Frazier===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2014}}\nOn February 16, 1970, Ellis fought Joe Frazier to unify the World Heavyweight Championship at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. The undefeated Frazier, a heavy betting favorite, proved to be too strong and powerful. Ellis, who had never been floored as a heavyweight, was knocked down twice in the fourth round by a relentless Frazier, and Angelo Dundee stopped the fight before the start of the fifth round. <ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/jimmy-ellis-boxer-who-became-world-heavyweight-champion-and-close-friend-sparring-partner-and-ring-9356810.html ''The Independent'' \u2013 May 12, 2014]</ref> It was the first knockout loss for Ellis.\n\n===Ellis vs. Ali===\nAfter winning his next three fights, Ellis fought Muhammad Ali in the [[Houston Astrodome]] on July 26, 1971. Angelo Dundee chose to work with Ellis for the fight. He was Ali's trainer, but he was both manager and trainer for Ellis. Working with Ellis meant that he would get a bigger share of the purse. Ali accepted the arrangement and got Harry Wiley, who had worked with [[Henry Armstrong]] and [[Sugar Ray Robinson]], to be his trainer for the Ellis fight.<ref>[http://www.secondsout.com/features/main-features/muhammad-ali-vs-jimmy-ellis-the-inevitable-fight---40-years-on Muhammad Ali vs. Jimmy Ellis: The Inevitable Fight \u2013 40 Years On]</ref>\n\nEllis fought well over the first three rounds, but the fight turned after Ellis was hurt by a right hand in the fourth round. The right hand \"hurt me so bad I couldn't really fight my best after that,\" Ellis said. \"It ruined me.\" The referee stopped the fight in the twelfth round as Ellis remained on his feet. No knockdowns were recorded throughout the fight.<ref>[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1085128/index.htm ''Sports Illustrated'' \u2013 August 2, 1971]</ref>\n\n===Diminishing skills===\n{{refimprove section|date=March 2015}}\nAfter the loss to Ali, Ellis won his next eight fights by knockout. But on June 18, 1973, he fought [[Earnie Shavers]], who was 44\u20132 (43 KOs), at Madison Square Garden. Ellis, ranked fourth by the WBA, stunned Shavers with a chopping right to the jaw and backed him into a corner. Shavers took numerous shots in the corner before clinching. After the referee separated the fighters, Shavers put Ellis down for the count with a powerful single right uppercut to the chin. The time was 2:39 in the first round.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=TIgxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xqEFAAAAIBAJ&pg=6581,1058082&dq=shavers+jimmy+ellis&hl=en The ''Montreal Gazette'' \u2013 June 19, 1973]</ref>\n\nEllis came back with a knockout win against [[club fighter]] Memphis Al Jones, but with his skills in decline, he went winless in his next five fights. He lost a split decision to [[Boone Kirkman]], fought a draw with Larry Middleton, dropped decisions to [[Ron Lyle]] and [[Joe Bugner]], and was stopped in nine rounds in a rematch with [[Joe Frazier]].\n\nThe rematch with [[Joe Frazier]] took place in [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], on March 2, 1975. Ellis trained at the Golden Bowl Gym in Camberwell, Melbourne with martial arts 4th Dan Gerry Scaife. Ellis won the first three rounds, but Frazier then picked up the intensity and took control. With Ellis bloody and battered, Angelo Dundee signaled for referee [[Bob Foster (boxer)|Bob Foster]] to stop the fight in the ninth round.\n\n===Retirement===\nOn May 6, 1975, in what would be his last fight, Ellis knocked out club fighter [[Carl Baker (boxer)|Carl Baker]] in the first round. He retired aged 35 after suffering a training injury that left him partially blind in his left eye. Ellis finished with a record of 40\u201312\u20131 (24 KOs).\n\n==Later life==\nAfter retiring from boxing, Ellis trained boxers. Later he worked for the Louisville Parks Department on athletic and recreational projects between 1989 and 2003.<ref>''New York Times'', 6 May 2014</ref> In 2004, Ellis told the ''Washington Times'' \"...All I ever wanted to be was a good fighter and good man.'<ref>''New York Times'', 6 May 2014</ref> He seemed to achieve it. Brother Jeff gave a tribute on his death saying \" He was someone you could model yourself on\"<ref>Wiky sports, May 2014</ref> Ellis was a reserved family man who shunned flash although had a determined competitive streak in boxing.\n\nWith wife Mary he had six children,2 sons and 4 daughters. His brother Charles boxed in the 1964 Olympics.\nEllis was personally kind and gracious. He maintained a brotherly relationship with Ali over all the decades. Ali himself often recalled Ellis as a great friend. Ellis wasn't always pleased by the sparring partner tag but felt he had proved himself above that.<ref>''New York Times'' 6 May 2014</ref>\n\nHe suffered from [[dementia pugilistica]], for over a decade before his death.<ref>Bloomberg News, May 2014</ref> It was reported that Ellis' condition was so bad that he believed his deceased wife, Mary who died in 2006, was still

Sheriff Longmire's longtime friend Henry Standing Bear ([[Lou Diamond Phillips]]), a [[Cheyenne]] man, provides insight to and sometimes aids in dealing with tribal police. (The [[Indian reservation]] has its own police force, which has authority within the reservation boundaries, except for capital crimes.) As the series progresses, the friends deal with issues of gambling at a casino on the reservation, issues of competing jurisdictional authority for protecting people and prosecuting crimes, and other issues of contemporary Native American life.\n\nIn the first season, Walt's adult daughter Cady ([[Cassidy Freeman]]) is concerned that her father has been stuck since the death of her mother. While preparing to run for re-election, Walt has delegated most police duties to deputies Branch Connally ([[Bailey Chase]]) and \"The Ferg\" (Adam Bartley). Branch has also entered the election, to unseat Longmire, and he is secretly dating Cady. Victoria \"Vic\" Moretti ([[Katee Sackhoff]]), a transplanted Philadelphia homicide detective, arrived in Wyoming six months prior and works as one of Walt's deputies.\n\nIn random [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scenes, Walt and Henry travel separately to [[Denver, Colorado]], where Walt attacks someone in a [[meth house]]. Denver Police Homicide Detective Fales ([[Charles S. Dutton]]) later comes to Wyoming to talk to Walt and Cady about Cady's mother's death. Cady is shocked to learn her mother was murdered, as Walt had told her she died of cancer. Fales tells Walt they found the murder suspect buried in a shallow grave. Walt denies killing the man; however, Detective Fales suspects that if Walt did not commit the murder, then Henry did.\n\nIn the second season, Cady goes to Denver to speak to Detective Fales, who gives her the details of her mother's murder and informs her the suspected murderer has also been killed. When Fales questions her, she says that her father confides in Henry Standing Bear, inadvertently giving Fales a new target of investigation. Henry tells Walt that he killed the murderer because Walt was unable to do so. Vic encounters Ed Gorski ([[Lee Tergesen]]), a retired cop from Philadelphia. They discuss the suicide of Gorski's former partner, whom Vic had implicated in a corruption scandal that prompted an internal affairs investigation. Gorski blames Vic for his partner's death and begins to stalk her. Frightened by Gorski's manner, Vic asks Henry for help, and Walt visits Gorski to warn him away. Gorski is subsequently beaten severely. Hector, a Cheyenne mercenary believed to have assaulted Gorski, is protected by Walt. Henry confesses to Walt that he hired Hector to kill Miller Beck, the murderer of Walt's wife, but Hector explains that he beat him and took his teeth as trophies. Fales and his team find the teeth at Henry's bar and arrest him. Walt wins the election. Cady is hospitalized after being hit by a car after hers is sabotaged. Branch investigates, leading to a confrontation with members of the local Cheyenne reservation.\n\nIn the third season, as Branch recovers from being shot, he comes to believe he was shot by David Ridges, a Cheyenne who was thought to have committed suicide and been cremated. Walt and the others do not believe him, and he begins his own investigation. In prison, Henry is abused by other Native Americans, led by former Cheyenne reservation police chief Malachi Strand ([[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]]). Strand believes Henry contributed to his arrest through his friendship with Walt. When Malachi makes it difficult for Henry to obtain an attorney, Cady decides to represent him. Henry gets released on bail and sets out to prove his innocence.\n\nMalachi is also released and begins working as security for Jacob Nighthorse, a prominent Cheyenne businessman and developer. Both Branch and Henry uncover clues that point to Nighthorse's being involved in their cases, with Ridges as a key figure. Walt believes Nighthorse might have had a part in his wife's murder. He begins to believe that Branch is obsessed by his ideas about Ridges and suspends him temporarily, putting him in the care of his father Barlow. Walt and Henry learn that Ridges killed Miller Beck. Walt learns of Ridges' hideout location and kills him in a confrontation, in self defense. Fales drops all charges against Henry, but the investigations continue. Branch questions his father, who admits to having paid Nighthorse to hire Ridges to kill Walt's wife in hopes of helping Branch become sheriff. The season ends with the sound of a gunshot.\n\nIn the fourth season, Walt, Vic, and Ferg set out to search for Branch, after finding a disturbing typewritten note on his home computer. Walt finds him dead in a river from what appears to be a self-inflicted shotgun wound. Walt refuses to rule Branch's death a suicide after he finds soil in the shotgun shell. This shows that the shell had been ejected from firing and put back into the gun. Walt thinks that Nighthorse is behind the murder, until a drunken Barlow Connally confesses to the sheriff about killing his own son. The murder had followed Branch's finding out that his father had ordered the murder of Walt's wife. After his confession, Barlow provokes Walt to shoot and kill him, increasing official suspicion of the sheriff's behavior. Meanwhile, Walt and his department join forces with Mathias ([[Zahn McClarnon]]), chief of the Cheyenne tribal police, to investigate the rape of a Cheyenne woman, Gabriella ([[Julia Jones]]), by several oil-field workers. The men escape prosecution because of conflicting authority and the reluctance of federal officials to prosecute. Walker ([[Callum Keith Rennie]]), the oil foreman, buys off Gabriella's family, who urge dropping the case. Henry takes up Hector's role of avenger and plans to exact justice on the rapists.  One is found dead, and Gabriella shoots the other as Henry is threatening him. Shot in the dark by Walt, Henry takes Gabriella into the [[Crow Nation]] territory to protect her. Both Walt and Walker seek to find her, ending up in a stand-off. Later, Mathias catches up with Henry and takes him into custody. Walt relaxes at home with his new love interest, Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan ([[Ally Walker]]), but an unknown intruder invades and shoots them.\n\nIn the fifth season, Walt conducts an intense search for the person who kidnapped Donna after the home invasion and seriously wounded him. Walt and Donna continue their relationship. Nighthorse becomes increasingly suspicious of Malachi's activities, and suspects he is skimming at the casino or otherwise earning illegal money. Mathias figures out that Henry has taken over Hector's duties as vigilante and uses that to his advantage. A heroin operation by the Irish mob is discovered in Walt's jurisdiction. Walt defends a wrongful-death suit; if he loses, he will lose everything he owns, and probably his job. Vic learns she is pregnant and suffers an assault. Walt ends his relationship with Donna. A future possibility of a relationship with Vic is suggested as they acknowledge their feelings toward each other.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movienewsguide.com/longmire-season-6-cancelled-bloodline-happened-season-5-final-episode-watch/285699 |title= What Happened In Season 5 Final Episode? |last=Muppala |first=Savitha |date=September 26, 2016  |website=Movie News Guide |publisher=Tune Media |access-date=January 6, 2017 |quote=The finale sees Walt and Vic recognizing and acknowledging and their feelings for each other.}}</ref> As Henry gives a ride home to a presumably drunk woman, Malachi and his men kidnap him.

His wife died a year before the series started, and he has told his daughter and friends that she died of cancer.

His uncle, Lucian Connally, was Walt's predecessor as sheriff, and Branch hopes to be sheriff one day, as well. He was romantically involved with Cady Longmire. After being shot by David Ridges in season two, he is shown during the next season recovering and investigating the attack. He was suspended from the force at the end of season three. \n* [[Cassidy Freeman]] as Cady Longmire is Walt's daughter, an attorney who initially works for a local law firm. Later, she works for Jacob Nighthorse, to provide representation to residents on the reservation. She was romantically involved with Branch Connally for a time. Later on, she becomes romantically involved with \"Zach\" Heflin. In the series finale, her father convinces her to run for sheriff.\n* [[Adam Bartley]] as Archie \"The Ferg\" Ferguson is an awkward but hard-working young deputy, who felt unappreciated next to his more senior deputies, the handsome Branch Connally and the former Philadelphia Detective Vic Morretti. His eclectic knowledge and skills have helped solve cases, justifying Walt's hiring him, despite the fact that one reason Walt hired him was as a favor to his father. He continues to feel overlooked, even when he is promoted to a more senior deputy status. In the early seasons, he has an unrequited crush on Cady. In season five, he meets Meg, a local nurse.\n\n===Recurring===\n<!-- Recurring cast is listed in order of credits, and in order of their appearance on the show, as per [[WP:TVCAST]] -->\n* Louanne Stephens as Ruby - dispatcher and manager of the sheriff's office (seasons 1-6).\n* [[Zahn McClarnon]] as Chief Mathias - chief of the Cheyenne reservation's [[Indian tribal police|tribal police]] (seasons 1-6).\n* [[A Martinez]] as Jacob Nighthorse - a local Cheyenne businessman representing the interests of his people (seasons 1-6).

Sheriff Longmire's longtime friend Henry Standing Bear ([[Lou Diamond Phillips]]), a [[Cheyenne]] man, provides insight to and sometimes aids in dealing with tribal police. (The [[Indian reservation]] has its own police force, which has authority within the reservation boundaries, except for capital crimes.) As the series progresses, the friends deal with issues of gambling at a casino on the reservation, issues of competing jurisdictional authority for protecting people and prosecuting crimes, and other issues of contemporary Native American life.\n\nIn the first season, Walt's adult daughter Cady ([[Cassidy Freeman]]) is concerned that her father has been stuck since the death of her mother. While preparing to run for re-election, Walt has delegated most police duties to deputies Branch Connally ([[Bailey Chase]]) and \"The Ferg\" (Adam Bartley). Branch has also entered the election, to unseat Longmire, and he is secretly dating Cady. Victoria \"Vic\" Moretti ([[Katee Sackhoff]]), a transplanted Philadelphia homicide detective, arrived in Wyoming six months prior and works as one of Walt's deputies.\n\nIn random [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scenes, Walt and Henry travel separately to [[Denver, Colorado]], where Walt attacks someone in a [[meth house]]. Denver Police Homicide Detective Fales ([[Charles S. Dutton]]) later comes to Wyoming to talk to Walt and Cady about Cady's mother's death. Cady is shocked to learn her mother was murdered, as Walt had told her she died of cancer. Fales tells Walt they found the murder suspect buried in a shallow grave. Walt denies killing the man; however, Detective Fales suspects that if Walt did not commit the murder, then Henry did.\n\nIn the second season, Cady goes to Denver to speak to Detective Fales, who gives her the details of her mother's murder and informs her the suspected murderer has also been killed. When Fales questions her, she says that her father confides in Henry Standing Bear, inadvertently giving Fales a new target of investigation. Henry tells Walt that he killed the murderer because Walt was unable to do so. Vic encounters Ed Gorski ([[Lee Tergesen]]), a retired cop from Philadelphia. They discuss the suicide of Gorski's former partner, whom Vic had implicated in a corruption scandal that prompted an internal affairs investigation. Gorski blames Vic for his partner's death and begins to stalk her. Frightened by Gorski's manner, Vic asks Henry for help, and Walt visits Gorski to warn him away. Gorski is subsequently beaten severely. Hector, a Cheyenne mercenary believed to have assaulted Gorski, is protected by Walt. Henry confesses to Walt that he hired Hector to kill Miller Beck, the murderer of Walt's wife, but Hector explains that he beat him and took his teeth as trophies. Fales and his team find the teeth at Henry's bar and arrest him. Walt wins the election. Cady is hospitalized after being hit by a car after hers is sabotaged. Branch investigates, leading to a confrontation with members of the local Cheyenne reservation.\n\nIn the third season, as Branch recovers from being shot, he comes to believe he was shot by David Ridges, a Cheyenne who was thought to have committed suicide and been cremated. Walt and the others do not believe him, and he begins his own investigation. In prison, Henry is abused by other Native Americans, led by former Cheyenne reservation police chief Malachi Strand ([[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]]). Strand believes Henry contributed to his arrest through his friendship with Walt. When Malachi makes it difficult for Henry to obtain an attorney, Cady decides to represent him. Henry gets released on bail and sets out to prove his innocence.\n\nMalachi is also released and begins working as security for Jacob Nighthorse, a prominent Cheyenne businessman and developer. Both Branch and Henry uncover clues that point to Nighthorse's being involved in their cases, with Ridges as a key figure. Walt believes Nighthorse might have had a part in his wife's murder. He begins to believe that Branch is obsessed by his ideas about Ridges and suspends him temporarily, putting him in the care of his father Barlow. Walt and Henry learn that Ridges killed Miller Beck. Walt learns of Ridges' hideout location and kills him in a confrontation, in self defense. Fales drops all charges against Henry, but the investigations continue. Branch questions his father, who admits to having paid Nighthorse to hire Ridges to kill Walt's wife in hopes of helping Branch become sheriff. The season ends with the sound of a gunshot.\n\nIn the fourth season, Walt, Vic, and Ferg set out to search for Branch, after finding a disturbing typewritten note on his home computer. Walt finds him dead in a river from what appears to be a self-inflicted shotgun wound. Walt refuses to rule Branch's death a suicide after he finds soil in the shotgun shell. This shows that the shell had been ejected from firing and put back into the gun. Walt thinks that Nighthorse is behind the murder, until a drunken Barlow Connally confesses to the sheriff about killing his own son. The murder had followed Branch's finding out that his father had ordered the murder of Walt's wife. After his confession, Barlow provokes Walt to shoot and kill him, increasing official suspicion of the sheriff's behavior. Meanwhile, Walt and his department join forces with Mathias ([[Zahn McClarnon]]), chief of the Cheyenne tribal police, to investigate the rape of a Cheyenne woman, Gabriella ([[Julia Jones]]), by several oil-field workers. The men escape prosecution because of conflicting authority and the reluctance of federal officials to prosecute. Walker ([[Callum Keith Rennie]]), the oil foreman, buys off Gabriella's family, who urge dropping the case. Henry takes up Hector's role of avenger and plans to exact justice on the rapists.  One is found dead, and Gabriella shoots the other as Henry is threatening him. Shot in the dark by Walt, Henry takes Gabriella into the [[Crow Nation]] territory to protect her. Both Walt and Walker seek to find her, ending up in a stand-off. Later, Mathias catches up with Henry and takes him into custody. Walt relaxes at home with his new love interest, Dr. Donna Sue Monaghan ([[Ally Walker]]), but an unknown intruder invades and shoots them.\n\nIn the fifth season, Walt conducts an intense search for the person who kidnapped Donna after the home invasion and seriously wounded him. Walt and Donna continue their relationship. Nighthorse becomes increasingly suspicious of Malachi's activities, and suspects he is skimming at the casino or otherwise earning illegal money. Mathias figures out that Henry has taken over Hector's duties as vigilante and uses that to his advantage. A heroin operation by the Irish mob is discovered in Walt's jurisdiction. Walt defends a wrongful-death suit; if he loses, he will lose everything he owns, and probably his job. Vic learns she is pregnant and suffers an assault. Walt ends his relationship with Donna. A future possibility of a relationship with Vic is suggested as they acknowledge their feelings toward each other.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.movienewsguide.com/longmire-season-6-cancelled-bloodline-happened-season-5-final-episode-watch/285699 |title= What Happened In Season 5 Final Episode? |last=Muppala |first=Savitha |date=September 26, 2016  |website=Movie News Guide |publisher=Tune Media |access-date=January 6, 2017 |quote=The finale sees Walt and Vic recognizing and acknowledging and their feelings for each other.}}</ref> As Henry gives a ride home to a presumably drunk woman, Malachi and his men kidnap him.

The album was released in mid [[1985 in music|1985]], on the labels [[Warner Bros. Records]], and [[Full Moon Records]]. The album was produced by [[Grammy Award]] winning producer and sound engineer [[Keith Olsen]] as well as Walsh himself. The album peaked at number 65 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\n==Album artwork==\nThe [[cover art]] for the album features the painting ''[[Zwei M\u00e4nner in Betrachtung des Mondes]]'' (Two Men Contemplating the Moon), a famous work by the [[Germans|German]] nineteenth-century romantic landscape artist [[Caspar David Friedrich]], with a grainy photograph of Walsh in behind. The back cover is another painting by Friedrich, ''[[Wanderer above the Sea of Fog|Der Wanderer \u00fcber dem Nebelmeer]]'' (Wanderer above the Sea of Fog).\n\n==Composition==\nThe album includes a cover of [[Michael Stanley]]'s \"Rosewood Bitters,\" which got some [[FM broadcast band|FM]] airplay in the US;<ref>http://popdose.com/basement-songs-joe-walsh-rosewood-bitters/</ref> Walsh played [[slide guitar]] on the original recording which Stanley originally recorded. On this version instead he plays an [[electric guitar]].<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-confessor-mw0000650947</ref>\n  \n\"Slow Dancing\" is a song written by [[Sniff 'n' the Tears|Loz Netto]] for Walsh. Netto was the [[guitarist]] in the [[England|English]] band called \"Moon\" from the mid 1970s and the band \"[[Sniff 'n' the Tears]]\" from the late 1970s.\n\nA variety of styles are explored on this album, including elements of [[blues]], [[Pop music|pop]], and even [[Caribbean]] music. The title song is more in the vein of [[progressive rock]].\n\n==Recording==\nThe album would be something that Walsh's new girlfriend [[Stevie Nicks]] would get involved with. Nicks' old friend [[Keith Olsen]] was hired to produce the album and the musicians were the superimposed [[Los Angeles|LA]] session stalwarts like: [[Jim Keltner]], [[Mike Porcaro]], [[Waddy Wachtel]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Alan Pasqua]] and a lot of musicians Walsh had never worked with before, the only familiar face was [[Timothy B.

[[Guitar World]], critic Bruce Malamut wrote that the album is \"the apologia of a strictly raised mid-western episcopalian after living in [[rock and roll]] [[sin]] for \u2018Fifteen Years\u2019 on the road,\" and that \"The balance \u2026 is a [[Sobriety|sober]] [[retrospective]] from rock\u2019s own [[Harpo Marx]].\"<ref>http://www.answers.com/topic/joe-walsh</ref> [[Rolling Stone]] said that \"Walsh is trying to make the kind of record he used to make a decade ago, and the result is, well, out of date, sound ''[sic]'' like something out of a 1975 time capsule.\"<ref name=\"nysse.com\"/> Writing retrospectively for [[AllMusic]], critic James Chrispell highly complimented the title track, but wrote of the album \"Joe Walsh just hasn't been able to produce a complete album of great material, and The Confessor is no exception.

The album was released in mid [[1985 in music|1985]], on the labels [[Warner Bros. Records]], and [[Full Moon Records]]. The album was produced by [[Grammy Award]] winning producer and sound engineer [[Keith Olsen]] as well as Walsh himself. The album peaked at number 65 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].\n\n==Album artwork==\nThe [[cover art]] for the album features the painting ''[[Zwei M\u00e4nner in Betrachtung des Mondes]]'' (Two Men Contemplating the Moon), a famous work by the [[Germans|German]] nineteenth-century romantic landscape artist [[Caspar David Friedrich]], with a grainy photograph of Walsh in behind. The back cover is another painting by Friedrich, ''[[Wanderer above the Sea of Fog|Der Wanderer \u00fcber dem Nebelmeer]]'' (Wanderer above the Sea of Fog).\n\n==Composition==\nThe album includes a cover of [[Michael Stanley]]'s \"Rosewood Bitters,\" which got some [[FM broadcast band|FM]] airplay in the US;<ref>http://popdose.com/basement-songs-joe-walsh-rosewood-bitters/</ref> Walsh played [[slide guitar]] on the original recording which Stanley originally recorded. On this version instead he plays an [[electric guitar]].<ref>http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-confessor-mw0000650947</ref>\n  \n\"Slow Dancing\" is a song written by [[Sniff 'n' the Tears|Loz Netto]] for Walsh. Netto was the [[guitarist]] in the [[England|English]] band called \"Moon\" from the mid 1970s and the band \"[[Sniff 'n' the Tears]]\" from the late 1970s.\n\nA variety of styles are explored on this album, including elements of [[blues]], [[Pop music|pop]], and even [[Caribbean]] music. The title song is more in the vein of [[progressive rock]].\n\n==Recording==\nThe album would be something that Walsh's new girlfriend [[Stevie Nicks]] would get involved with. Nicks' old friend [[Keith Olsen]] was hired to produce the album and the musicians were the superimposed [[Los Angeles|LA]] session stalwarts like: [[Jim Keltner]], [[Mike Porcaro]], [[Waddy Wachtel]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Alan Pasqua]] and a lot of musicians Walsh had never worked with before, the only familiar face was [[Timothy B. Schmit]] (of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]) who only recorded backing vocals.<ref name=\"nysse.com\">http://www.nysse.com/jw/anthology.html</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 =[[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|2.5|5}} <ref name=\"AM\">{{cite web |first=James |last=Chrispell |title= ''The Confessor'' > Review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id= r21464 |pure_url=yes}} |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |accessdate=July 9, 2011}}</ref>\n}}\nUpon its release, the album was poorly received by many critics but sold quite well. [[Guitar World]], critic Bruce Malamut wrote that the album is \"the apologia of a strictly raised mid-western episcopalian after living in [[rock and roll]] [[sin]] for \u2018Fifteen Years\u2019 on the road,\" and that \"The balance \u2026 is a [[Sobriety|sober]] [[retrospective]] from rock\u2019s own [[Harpo Marx]].\"<ref>http://www.answers.com/topic/joe-walsh</ref> [[Rolling Stone]] said that \"Walsh is trying to make the kind of record he used to make a decade ago, and the result is, well, out of date, sound ''[sic]'' like something out of a 1975 time capsule.\"<ref name=\"nysse.com\"/> Writing retrospectively for [[AllMusic]], critic James Chrispell highly complimented the title track, but wrote of the album \"Joe Walsh just hasn't been able to produce a complete album of great material, and The Confessor is no exception. The first half is dreck... Worthwhile for the title track alone.\"<ref name=\"AM\" />\n\n==Live performances and Tour==\nAfter the release of the album, Walsh toured again with [[Joe Vitale (musician)|Joe Vitale]] in [[Australia]] and in the [[United States|US]]. In Australia the band was called \"Creatures From America\". In the US they were the opening act on some gigs for [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]].<ref name=\"waddywachtelinfo.com\">http://waddywachtelinfo.com/JoeWalsh2.html</ref>\n\n\"[[The Confessor (song)|The Confessor]]\" and \"Good Man Down\" were the only tracks from this album which were performed live on that tour.<ref name=\"waddywachtelinfo.com\"/>\n\n;Partial list of the Australian concerts:\n* 7/12 - Tivoli nightclub, [[Sydney]]\n* ?? - Prospect Hill Hotel, [[Melbourne]]\n\n;Partial list of the US concerts:\n* 14/7 - [[Cleveland Stadium|Municipal Stadium]], [[Cleveland]], OH\n* 23/7 - [[Spectrum (arena)|The Spectrum]], [[Philadelphia]], PA (with \"[[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]\")\n* 24/7 - [[Capital Centre]], [[Landover, Maryland|Landover]], MD (with Foreigner)\n* 3/8 - [[Nikon at Jones Beach Theater]], [[Wantagh]], NY (with \"Foreigner\")\n* 21/8 - Molson Amphitheater, [[Barrie]], ON\n* 25/8 - [[Silver Stadium]], [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], NY (with \"Foreigner\")\n* 29/8 - Saratoga Springs Performing Arts Center, Saratoga Springs, NY\n* 3/9 - [[Ohio Center]], [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], OH (with \"Foreigner\")\n* 5/9 - [[Syria Mosque]], [[Pittsburgh]], PA\n* 7/9 8/9 - [[Pine Knob Music Theater]], [[Clarkston, Michigan|Clarkston]], MI (with \"Foreigner\")\n* 11/9 - [[Meadowlands Arena]], [[East Rutherford]], NJ (with \"Foreigner\")\n* 12/9 - [[Madison Square Garden]], [[New York City|New York]], NY (with \"Foreigner\")\n* 13/9 - [[Blossom Music Center]], [[Cuyahoga Falls]], OH\n* 21/9 - [[Kemper Arena]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], MO, (with \"Foreigner\")\n\n;Also in 1985\n* 28/5 - [[Late Night With David Letterman|Late Night With]] [[David Letterman]] - Walsh and Waddy Wachtel perform with a band.\n* ?/5 - Walsh performed with Wachtel at the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] in [[New York City]].
