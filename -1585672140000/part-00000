Its jurisdiction encompasses the province of [[Pampanga]] and includes the [[suffragan]] sees of lba (Zambales), Tarlac (Tarlac) and Balanga (Bataan).\n\nThe seat of the archbishop is the Metropolitan Cathedral of St. Ferdinand and Our Lady of Assumption Parish, and it is the mother church of the archdiocese.\n\n==History==\n\n===From diocese to archdiocese===\n\nThe diocese of San Fernando, Pampanga was created on December 11, 1948, through the [[Apostolic Constitution]]  ''Probe Noscitur''; it comprised the provinces of Pampanga, Bataan, Zambales, parts of Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija. It was initially a [[suffragan]] of the Archdiocese of Manila. The first bishop was the Most Rev. C\u00e9sar Mar\u00eda Guerrero, DD, a native of [[Manila]]; he received his appointment from the Vatican on May 29, 1949, and was installed on September 8 of the same year. The parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, in the provincial capital town of San Fernando, was selected as the seat of the new diocese; the parish church was thus elevated into a cathedral and was renamed Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption.\n\n<!-- Taken during a major ordination rite in Floridablanca, dated 17 December 1955 -->Bishop Guerrero established the Mater Boni Consilii (now Mother of Good Counsel) Seminary in 1950 (it was originally in Guagua, then Apalit, before being relocated to its present site in San Fernando): the Cruzada de Penitencia y Caridad (or devotion to the Virgen delos Remedios) in 1952, which continues to this day; and Carmelite Monastery in Angeles in 1956, where on March 14, 1957, he retired due to poor health. He died on March 27, 1961, and was buried beside the monastery chapel, according to his wishes.\n\nEventually the diocese was dismembered when provincial boundaries became more pronounced.   Zambales was established as a prelature on October 18, 1955, Nueva Ecija as a diocese on February 16, 1963, Tarlac as a diocese on May 10, 1963, and Bataan as a diocese on March 17, 1975.\n\nThe Most Rev. Emilio A. Cinense, DD, a native of Guimba, Nueva Ecija, became the second bishop of San Fernando on March 15, 1957.  It was during this term that the Diocese of San Fernando was elevated to a Metropolitan See and Archdiocese; the canonical erection was held on June 15, 1975.  The new archdiocese comprised the whole province of Pampanga with three suffragan dioceses: Tarlac, Iba (Zambales) and Balanga (Bataan).\n\nAfter the death of Archbishop Cinense, the Most Rev. Oscar C. Cruz, DD, the native of Balanga, Bataan, and at the time rector of San Carlos Seminary, was appointed second Archbishop of San Fernando on May 22, 1978; he resigned on October 24, 1988.  On January 31, 1989, the Most Rev. Paciano B. Aniceto of Sta. Ana, Pampanga, former rector of the Mother of Good Counsel Seminary and Bishop of Iba, was appointed third (and first Pampanga-born) Archbishop of San Fernando; he was formally installed on March 14, 1989.\n\nOn December 11, 1998, the Golden Jubilee anniversary of its creation as a diocese  the Archdiocese of San Fernando's Cathedral of the Assumption was consecrated and rededicated as The Metropolitan Cathedral of San Fernando, during ceremonies presided over by the papal nuncio, the Most Rev. Antonio Franco, DD.\n\n===Pampanga: first and last Augustinian territory in Luzon===\n[[File:JfChancery0475Lavariafvf_12.JPG|thumb|Bishop David, Archbishop Lavarias, and Apu Ceto]] \nPampanga was not only the pioneer and premiere territory of the Augustinian Order in Luzon but also the last bastion of their evangelical ministry.  They administered Pampanga throughout the 300-year. Spanish colonial period (with a few interruptions) and way beyond it, from 1572 all the way to 1960 when they ceded their last parish to local diocesan clergy (although the last Augustinian priest working in the Kapampangan Region died only as recently as 1993). Here's a brief description of the twenty mission stations (now parishes) founded by the Augustinians in Pampanga; many existed as communities before the Spaniards came.\n\nLUBAO (1572): Maestre de Campo Martin helped P. Fray Gallagos found Lubao in 1572. In 1580 a school of Latin and humanities was established for the inhabitants and missionaries from Spain and Mexico. The first Augustinian printing press in the country was located in this town. Fray Antonio Herrera built the church, the largest in Pampanga.\n\nBETIS (1572): Also founded in 1572 by Fray Fernando Pinto. Although the Libro lists P. Fray Mateo Peralta as its first parroco, P. Fray Jose de la Cruz built the stone church. Early friars describe the faithful of Betis as the most pious and industrious people in the whole province; also, Betis is said to have produced the largest number of priests in the entire country.\n\nMACABEBE (1575): P. Sebastian Molina was Macabebe's first pastor. Equally prominent friars \u2013 PP. Montoya, Tallada, Coronel, Medina, and the illustrious Foronda, all writers in Pampango \u2013 later followed him. The first Pampango book ever published, Vida de san Nicolas do tolentino ( 1614), was written by Fray Tallada when he was minister of this town.\n\nCANDABA (1575): P. Fray Manrique was the pioneer missionary of Candava (Candaba), also founded in 1575. P. Fray Jose de la Cruz, who built the churches of Betis and Mexico, built its stone church only in 1665, P. Fray Estaban Ibeas built its cimborrio (dome), and P. Fray Bravo the tower. The convent was built by the early fathers and later embellished by Fathers Ferrer, Ibeas and Bernando.\n\nBACOLOR (1576): P. Fray Diego Ochoa, author of the first Arte, Vocabulario y Confesionario en Pampango, founded Bacolor. The church is said to be the most beautiful in the province, featuring a grand transept, a project of PP. Fray Manuel Diaz, E. Alvarez and Antonio Bravo, and boasts of having the biggest convent in the whole province. It also has a spacious cemetery equipped with a fine chapel.\n\nMEXICO (1581): The town was initially called Nuevo Mexico, with Fr. Bernardino de Quevedo and Fr. Pedro de Abuyoas first priors. The first church, built by P. Fray Jose de la Cruz in 1665, was destroyed by the great earthquake of 1880, leaving intact the bell tower. Fr. Esteban D. Ibeas had a provisional structure of wood and iron built. The construction of the permanent church, which Fr. Ibeas had planned, was never realized because he was recalled to Manila, and eventually died of cancer of the tongue.\n\nARAYAT (1590): Among the friars assigned to this town were Fathers Contreras, Ven. Bedoya, Ortiz, and Ossorio who built its beautiful church of cut stone and bricks. Fathers Jose Torres and Juan Tarrero later rebuilt it from 1858 to 1892. Arayat owes to Fr. Torres the construction of a beautiful ba\u00f1o (bath house) at the foot of the mountain about two kilometres from the town proper, which is now still a popular destination.\n\nGUAGUA (1590): Fr. Bernardo de Quevedo founded the Guagua mission in 1590 with Fr. Juan de Zabala as first resident priest. One Augustinian wrote that \u201cGuagua occupies the second place among the convents of Pampanga, just after that of Bacolor, although formerly it was number one.\u201d One reason for Guagua's progress was the existence of Parian, an area where natives mixed with Chinese merchants in marriage and in business. Originally these Chinese were refugees from persecution by Gen. Simon de Anda, who had accused them of conniving with the British invaders in 1762 and plotting to assassinate the Governor General and some Augustinians. Another Augustinian likened the Holy Week processions in Guagua as comparable to those held in Spain.\n\nSASMUAN (1590): Sexmoan (Sasmuan) visited Guagua in 1590 and Lubao in 1611. In 1613 its residents complained of the inconvenience of having to go to Lubao for Mass, confession and catechism. In 1615, Fr. Pedro de Zu\u00f1iga was appointed vicar of Sexmoan. Fr. Jose Duque built the first church. Chronicler Fray Gaspar de San Agustin wrote; \u201cThe church is very beautiful, and it is placed under the advocation of Santa Lucia; the convent is of first class too\u201d. Both buildings were swept away by the overflowing river beside them. In 1884, Fr. Toribio Fanjul restored the church.\n\nPORAC (1594): Fr. Mateo de Peralta founded Porac in 1954 by organizing the Negritoes from various rancherias into a single town. In 1607, Porac was annexed to Bacolor as a visit; in 1641, the convent was relieved of its obligation to pay rent to Manila, due to extreme poverty. Fathers Manuel Obregon (1726) and Nicolas Mornier (1735) are credited to have constructed the church, which was destroyed by an earthquake in 1863 and restored by Frs. Isidoro Fernando and Esteban Ibeas (while stationed at Sta. Rita). Damaged again in World War II, it was restored by Fr. Daniel Castrillo, the last Augustinian parish priest of Pampanga.\n\nAPALIT (1597): The first prior was Fr. Pedro de Vergara, but it was Fr. Juan Cabello that started the construction of the first church constructed by Fr. Antonio Redondo in 1876-83. It cost P40,000 but Fr. Redondo spent only P 30, 000 through good fiscal management. It is said that the sacristan would go around town ringing a bell, preceded by the brass band, and the townspeople would follow him with their donations of sand and other materials: \u201cThe whole town of Apalit helped either with monetary donations, personal service or their good wishes.\"\n\nMAGALANG (1605): Fr. Gonzalo de Salazar served as first prior in 1605 in the town's original site at barrio Macapsa. It was transferred to San Bartolome, which was abandoned due to flood in 1856, prompting another transfer to its present site in barrio Talimunduc. Fr. Ramon Sarrionandia supervised the transfer and gave the town its name, San Pedro de Magalang. The first church, built in 1725 in San Bartolome, was destroyed in the flood; the present church was built by Fr. Sarrionandia in 1886.\n\nMINALIN (1614): Minalin was segregated from its matrix Macabebe in 1614; Fr. Miguel de Salda\u00f1a served as the first prior only in 1618. No records exist on when the church was constructed and by whom; only one record states it was finished in 1834. Augustinian figures as well as what appears to be a map of the town marked 1619 are found in the convent, although it is unlikely the map was painted in that year.\n\nSANTA RITA (1726): Fr. Pedro de San Nicolas served as minister of both Porac and Sta. Rita in 1722, but it was only in 1726 when Sta. Rita had its own priest and therefore became an independent parish. Fr. Francisco Royo built the present church in 1839; Fr. Juan Merino completed it in 1868. These two priests also opened the road linking Sta. Rita with Porac and Guagua. During the Revolution, the townspeople hid their last Augustinian parish priest, Fr. Celestino Garcia, in their houses until the forces of Gen. Maximino Hizon captured him in Bacolor and took him all the way to Lepanto in the Cordilleras.\n\nSAN LUIS (1740): Formerly known as San Nicolas de Cabagsa, in honor of former parish priest Fr. Nicolas de Ordu\u00f1o (cabagsac means a place where fruit bags are bagged out), the town had Fr. Jose Echevarria as first prior in 1742. There is no data on who built the church or when, except that Fr. Isidro Bernardo made great restorations in 1883.\n\nSAN FERNANDO (1754): San Fernando had its first prior, Fr. Sebastian Moreno, only two years after its foundation in 1754. He also started the construction of the church; Fr. Mariano Alafont completed it in 1761. Destroyed in 1828, it was restored by Fr. Pedro Medina and Fr. Antonio Redondo, who had paintings done on the ceiling and the majestic dome built. It was destroyed again in 1899 by Antonio Luna's soldiers, rebuilt, and then burned down in 1939. Architect Fernando Ocampo designed it after the war.\n\nSANTA ANA (1756): As early as 1598, the town (formerly named Pimpin) functioned as visita of Arayat, and it was in 1756 that Augustinians declared it an independent parish with Fr. Lorenzo Guerra as first prior. The church was built in 1853; Fr. Lucas Gonzales added the five-story belfry in 1857. The stones used came from Meycauayan and the wood from Porac and Betis.\n\nSAN SIMON (1771): The town's original name was Virgen del Pilar, after its founder, Mariano del Pilar de los Reyes. After the British Occupation of 1762-65, Gen. Simon de Anda renamed it San Simon after his own name. The Augustinians appointed the first prior only in 1771, Fr. Fernando Medalla. In 1870, Fr. Benito Ubierna built the first church; the revolutionaries burned it down in 1898.\n\nSTO. TOMAS (1793): Formerly called Baliuag, Sto. Tomas parish was founded in 1763, by secular priests, although by 1853 the Augustinians had reclaimed it. The church was built by secular priest, later repaired by Fray Guillermo Masnou. Convent was built later by Fray Tarrero and Fray Bedoya.\n\nANGELES (1820): The former barrio of San Fernando became a separate town in 1829. Initially ministered by a secular priest, Angeles (formerly Culiat) got its first Augustinian prior, Fr. Vicente Andres, in 1843.  Fr. Guillermo Masnou built a wooden church in 1855 to replace the first nipa church, while Fr. Ramon Sarrionandia started the construction in 1860 of the present stone edifice. Fr. Rufino Santos (not the cardinal) did some restoration work in 1893. It took 37 years to complete the church in 1897.\n\nFLORIDABLANCA (1867): Formerly a hacienda of Lubao called San Jose de Calumpaui, the town was renamed Floridablanca after the Count of Floridablanca, Spain (Don Jose Monino), who reportedly owned vast tracts of land in the town.  Fr. Jose Hernandez served as the first prior after the town became a parish in 1867, the same year Calumpaui became Floridablanca.  Fr. Luciano Morron Ylla constructed the church and convent in 1887.  The parish was under the Augustinians until 1960.\n\nMASANTOL (1887): The town, formerly a barrio of Macabebe, was founded in 1887\u2014probably the last own founded by the Augustinians in Pampanga.  It became an independent parish with the name San Miguel de Masantol in 1894.\n\nMABALACAT (1712): This town was formerly an earlier mission of the Augustinians. Due to some insurmountable difficulties it was abandoned and later was given to the Augustinian Recollects in 1712. Fr. Andres de San Fulgencio is one of the three friars who pioneered in the mission. The famous bamboo organ builder, Fr. Diego Cera's first assignment after his ordination in Spain. It was turn over to the secular priest in 1898.\n\n==Suffragan dioceses==\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Balanga|Diocese of Balanga]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Iba|Diocese of Iba]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarlac|Diocese of Tarlac]]\n\n==Prelates of the See==\n\n===Ordinary before the Elevation to a Metropolitan See===\n*1949-1957 (Resigned) : '''Most Rev.

Cristo Del Perdon==\nTrue to form, Kapampangans make a big fuss over appearances; they don't quite know how to solve the problem of two images of the same Virgen\u2014the officially crowned replica and the sidelined antique original. The crusade, in which the image of Our Lady of Remedies (Virgen de los Remedios) is taken in daily processions all over Pampanga 365 days a year, is tradition that can be found only in this province of Pampanga. Today, however, the original purpose of the crusade - and the Virgin - have long since forgotten: the fact that the crusade was established to help in the battle against the Communist [[Hukbalahap]] in the province in the 1950s.\n\n[[File:Crusade of Virgen Delos Remedios & Sto. Cristo del Perdon.jpg|thumb|331x331px|The Crusade of the Virgen De Los Remedios & Sto. Cristo Del Perdon during their visit in Christ, Prince of Peace Parish in October 2011.]]\nOn one hand, the original image stays in its original chapel in Baliti, San Fernando City, on the other hand, three replicas have been made to serve as symbols of the crusade. The Baliti faithful recently begun actively promoting its shrine as a pilgrimage site, a la Our Lady of Manaoag in Pangasinan. However, for the rest of Pampanga, devotion is mostly directed to the most visible and accessible two pilgrim images which are replicas of the replica; these two images are processioned non-stop even to the farthest fishing villages and mountain hamlets. However, the biggest crowds gather (albeit once a year only) around the first replica of the original image, the one that is taken out once a year (from the Archdiocesan Chancery) for the annual coronation rites (alternately in San Fernando and Angeles). Thus, there are four identical images of same Virgen de los Remedios: one stationery image in Baliti, another that is kept in the Chancery, taken out only every September 8; and the two pilgrim images constantly going around the province for the crusade. In this processions, the image of the Santo Cristo de Perdon accompanies the Virgen\u2014underscoring the belief of Catholics that the Blessed Virgin helps bring Christ even to the most unreachable people.\n\n=== Beginning of the devotions ===\n\nIt all began when the Diocese of San Fernando was created on December 11, 1948 as a separate diocese away from the Archdiocese of Manila. Its first bishop was the most Rev. Cesar Ma. Guerrero, DD, who immediately identified the most pressing problem of Pampanga as the peasant uprising against the feudal system, fueled by a communist ideology. Socialist mayors were being elected, including those in Angeles and San Fernando; the sonorous sound of the tambuli was a nightly occurrence, and so were parades of peasants waving red flags. The people did go to Mass, pray the Angelus and the rosary, but as Bishop Guerrero said, \u201cAqui en Pampanga hay mucha piedad, pero poca caridad!\u201d (\u201cHere in Pampanga there is much piety, but little charity!\u201d) in the vernacular: \u201cDeng Kapampangan, mapangadi la, pero ali la mapamie!\u201d\n\nAfter much prayer and reflection, to counteract Communist support among the farmers of Pampanga Bishop Guerrero established the Cruzada ning Pamanisi at Lugud (Crusade of Penance and Charity), during a meeting held on the third Sunday of February, 1952, at the San Guillermo Parish in Bacolor, Pampanga. He appointed the parish's co-adjutor Fr. Diosdado Victorio as director of the Cruzada, who chose the image of the Lady of Remedies (Virgen de los Remedios), then enshrined in the Virgen de los Remedios Parish (not San Roque parish as previously thought) in Brgy. Baliti, San Fernando, Pampanga, as the image that would accompany the Cruzada across the province. It may be deduced that Bishop Guerrero's choice of patron saint may have been influenced by his personal devotion to Virgen de los Remedios, patron saint of Malate, his former parish. The beautiful andas (shoulder-borne carriage) on which the image was mounted was commissioned by Do\u00f1a Jacinta vda. De Tayag of Bacolor.\n\nThe crusade officially started on May 1, 1952, or four years after the birth of diocese, in the San Miguel Arcangel Parish on Masantol, the southernmost town of Pampanga. Throughout the year well-attended processions marked the transfer of the image from Parish to parish.\n\nPart of the tradition of the crusade was the donation of all alms and goods collected from the previously visited parish to the next parish. Soon, the processions of the Virgen de los Remedios  featured truckloads of material goods being distributed to the indigent residents; thus, Kapampangan learned to share their processions and the visits of the Virgen became joyous occasions of replenishing both the soul and the body.\n\nAnd when all the parishes had been visited by the image of the Virgen, it was the turn of Baliti, its home parish. Obviously the people of Baliti had sorely missed their beloved Virgen; they had also celebrated their fiesta earlier without the image. When the time came for the crusade's second round of provincial visits, Bishop Guerrero, who had arrived in Baliti to pick up the image, was politely told by Baliti's parish priest, Fr. Generoso Pallasingui, that his parishioners would not the allow the image to leave the parish again. Msgr. Jose de la Cruz, now 92, who was present in the meeting, said in a recent interview that Fr. Pallasigui was quite worried that \u201cblood would flow\u201d if Bishop Guerrero insisted on taking the image away. (Apparently the people and their officials had made their feelings clear to the priest earlier.)\n\nThe people of Baliti graciously lent the image of their parish patroness for the first year of provincial processions. However, when it wasn't returned in time for their barrio fiesta, and when talk circulated that the image did not belong to them anymore but to the entire province, their mood turned from gracious to sour to indignation.\n\nMsgr. De la Cruz, then the director of the Kapampangan radio program Ing Siuala nang Maria (The Voice of Mary), recalls that the bishop decided right then and there to have a replica image. \u201cConsidering that Baliti was Huk-infested at that time,\u201d Msgr. De la Cruz said, \u201cthe bishop thought it wise to let the matter rest. Besides, the Cruzada was intended to bring the people closer to God, not away from Him.\u201d He said the people may have reacted to an earlier comment he had made on the program that \u201cno single parish owns the Virgen de los Remedios. Every parish that the image visits owns it in the duration of the visit\". The comment is canonically sound because all church edifices and all artifacts found inside are technically the property of the diocese, and thus, the image is also considered property owned by the diocese and not by the Crusade.\n\n=== Road to the coronation === \n\nThe first replica was thus hastily made by the late Victoriano Siongco of the Catholic Trade Center of San Fernando. It was so well made that when the processions began for the crusade\u2019s year 2 in late 1953, the people did not realize it was a different image. Bishop Guerrero next decided to apply to the Vatican for permission to have the image canonically crowned.\n\nThe criteria for a canonical coronation of a religious image are; (a) there must be widespread devotion around the image; and (b) the image must have proven antiquity. It was the second criterion that made Msgr. De la Cruz pause. Which of the two images should be canonically crowned the antique Baliti image or the new replica to which popular devotion had now been transferred? Bishop Guerrero told the priest. \u201cJust pray, Pepe.\u201d\n\nOn the September 8, 1956, more than 70,000 Kapampangans witnessed the canonical coronation of the replica, performed by the Pope's emissary to the Philippines, Msgr. Egidio Vagnozzi, held on capitol grounds in San Fernando.\n\nAfter that, the popular devotion around the crowned image of the Virgen de los Remedios grew even more. Towns that were visited often kept the image way beyond the allotted period, which slowed down the itinerary. It took 10 years or more before the image returned to the same town, which was why people pulled all stops whenever the image finally did come back to their town.\n\nIt was also around this time that the image of Santo Cristo del Perdon (Crucified Christ, Lord of Pardon) was added to accompany the Virgen. There was discussion on which image should come first during the procession, until it was decided to put the Santo Cristo del Perdon first, not only to emphasize that Christ should be first (despite the popular belief that the more important should be last) but also since Cruzada is based on penance, the first image that the people should see must be that of suffering.\n\nIn 1978 or 1979, San Fernando Archbishop Oscar V. Cruz wanted to solve the problem of the extremely slow pace of the Virgen's provincial rounds. There was a proposal to have (9) new images made so that each of the diocese's nine vicariates (cluster of parishes based on geography) would have its own Virgen. Msgr. De la Cruz informed Archbishop Cruz that \u201cIt was not the intention of Bishop Guerrero to have multiple images going around\u201d So the compromise was reached that only two images should go around, one for the northern towns of Pampanga, and one for the southern towns. But then again, the bishop anticipated debate on which group of towns would get the canonically crowned image and which would get the new one. So he solomonically decided to have two new replicas made for the crusade in the north and the south, while the canonically crowned image would stay in the chancery (Bishop's residence) and would come out only every September 8 for the reenactment of the canonical coronation. (Many Kapampangans today erroneously call the annual event \u201ccanonical coronation\u201d the Virgen was canonically crowned only once, September 8, 1956; the succeeding September 8 events are all merely anniversaries or reenactments of that first and only canonical coronation.)\n\nThe two new images were introduced during the 1981 reenactment, held in Minalin. (Reenactments were held in whichever town the Virgen was visiting around the time of the anniversary; however, when flooding worsened after Pinatubo, especially in the southern towns, the archdiocese decided to hold the reenactment alternately between San Fernando and Angeles, simply because they are the only towns with enough facilities to accommodate the big crowds and because they are relatively dry during the monsoon season.)\n\n==Vicariates==\n\n===Vicariate of St. John Marie Vianney===\nThe [[San Fernando City, Pampanga|City of San Fernando]] and the Town of [[Bacolor, Pampanga|Bacolor]]\n\n*'''Metropolitan Cathedral of St. Ferdinand and Our Lady of Assumption Parish''' - City of San Fernando\n*'''St. Joseph, Husband of Mary Parish (Santuario de San Jose, Arsobispado de Pampanga)''' - San Jose, City of San Fernando\n*'''Sto.

Its jurisdiction encompasses the province of [[Pampanga]] and includes the [[suffragan]] sees of lba (Zambales), Tarlac (Tarlac) and Balanga (Bataan).\n\nThe seat of the archbishop is the Metropolitan Cathedral of St. Ferdinand and Our Lady of Assumption Parish, and it is the mother church of the archdiocese.\n\n==History==\n\n===From Diocese to Archdiocese===\n\nThe diocese of San Fernando, Pampanga was created on December 11, 1948, through the [[Apostolic Constitution]]  ''Probe Noscitur''; it comprised the provinces of Pampanga, Bataan, Zambales, parts of Tarlac, and Nueva Ecija. It was initially a [[suffragan]] of the Archdiocese of Manila. The first bishop was the Most Rev. C\u00e9sar Mar\u00eda Guerrero, DD, a native of [[Manila]]; he received his appointment from the Vatican on May 29, 1949, and was installed on September 8 of the same year. The parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, in the provincial capital town of San Fernando, was selected as the seat of the new diocese; the parish church was thus elevated into a cathedral and was renamed Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption.\n\n<!-- Taken during a major ordination rite in Floridablanca, dated 17 December 1955 -->Bishop Guerrero established the Mater Boni Consilii (now Mother of Good Counsel) Seminary in 1950 (it was originally in Guagua, then Apalit, before being relocated to its present site in San Fernando): the Cruzada de Penitencia y Caridad (or devotion to the Virgen delos Remedios) in 1952, which continues to this day; and Carmelite Monastery in Angeles in 1956, where on March 14, 1957, he retired due to poor health. He died on March 27, 1961, and was buried beside the monastery chapel, according to his wishes.\n\nEventually the diocese was dismembered when provincial boundaries became more pronounced.   Zambales was established as a prelature on October 18, 1955, Nueva Ecija as a diocese on February 16, 1963, Tarlac as a diocese on May 10, 1963, and Bataan as a diocese on March 17, 1975.\n\nThe Most Rev. Emilio A. Cinense, DD, a native of Guimba, Nueva Ecija, became the second bishop of San Fernando on March 15, 1957.  It was during this term that the Diocese of San Fernando was elevated to a Metropolitan See and Archdiocese; the canonical erection was held on June 15, 1975.  The new archdiocese comprised the whole province of Pampanga with three suffragan dioceses: Tarlac, Iba (Zambales) and Balanga (Bataan).\n\nAfter the death of Archbishop Cinense, the Most Rev. Oscar C. Cruz, DD, the native of Balanga, Bataan, and at the time rector of San Carlos Seminary, was appointed second Archbishop of San Fernando on May 22, 1978; he resigned on October 24, 1988.  On January 31, 1989, the Most Rev. Paciano B. Aniceto of Sta. Ana, Pampanga, former rector of the Mother of Good Counsel Seminary and Bishop of Iba, was appointed third (and first Pampanga-born) Archbishop of San Fernando; he was formally installed on March 14, 1989.\n\nOn December 11, 1998, the Golden Jubilee anniversary of its creation as a diocese  the Archdiocese of San Fernando's Cathedral of the Assumption was consecrated and rededicated as The Metropolitan Cathedral of San Fernando, during ceremonies presided over by the papal nuncio, the Most Rev. Antonio Franco, DD.\n\n===Pampanga: First and Last Augustinian territory in Luzon===\n[[File:JfChancery0475Lavariafvf_12.JPG|thumb|Bishop David, Archbishop Lavarias, and Apu Ceto]] \nPampanga was not only the pioneer and premiere territory of the Augustinian Order in Luzon but also the last bastion of their evangelical ministry.  They administered Pampanga throughout the 300-year. Spanish colonial period (with a few interruptions) and way beyond it, from 1572 all the way to 1960 when they seeded their last parish to local diocesan clergy (although the last Augustinian priest working in the Kapampangan Region died only as recently as 1993). Here's a brief description of the twenty mission stations (now parishes) founded by the Augustinians in Pampanga.  (Editor's Note: Many these communities had existed long before the Spaniards came; \u201cfounding\u201d here is used to mean establishing a mission).\n\nLUBAO (1572)\nMaestre de Campo Martin de helped P. Fray Gallagos found Lubao in 1572. In 1580 a school of Latin and Humanities was established for the inhabitants and missionaries from Spain and Mexico. The first Augustinian Printing Press in the country was located in this town. Fray Antonio Herrera built the church, the largest in Pampanga.\n\nBETIS (1572)\nAlso founded in 1572 by Fray Fernando Pinto, although the Libro list P. Fray Mateo Peralta as its first parroco P. Fray Jose de la Cruz built the stone church. Early friars describe the faithful of Betis as the most pious and industrious people in the whole province, not to mention that Betis is said to have produced the most number of priest not only in Pampanga but in the entire country.\n\nMACABEBE (1575)\nP. Sebastian Molina was Macabebe's first pastor. Equally prominent friars. PP. Montoya, Tallada, Coronel, Medina, and the illustrious Foronda- all writers in Pampango-later followed him. The first Pampango book ever published, Vida de san Nicolas do tolentino ( 1614), was written by Fray Tallada when he was minister of this town.\n\nCANDABA (1575) \nP. Fray Manrique was the pioneer missionary of Candava (Candaba), also founded in 1575. P. Fray Jose de la Cruz, who built the churches of Betis and Mexico, built its stone church only in 1665, P. Fray Estaban Ibeas built its cimborrio (dome), and P. Fray Bravo the tower. The convent was built by the early fathers and later embellished by Fathers Ferrer, Ibeas and Bernando.\n\nBACOLOR (1576)\nP. Fray Diego Ochoa, author of the first Arte, Vocabulario y Confesionario en Pampango, founded Bacolor. The church is said to be the most beautiful in the province, featuring a grand transept, a project o PP. Fray Manuel Diaz, E. Alvarez and Antonio Bravo, and boasts of having the biggest convent in the whole province. It also has a spacious cemetery equipped with a fine chapel.\n\nMEXICO (1581)\nThe town was initially called Nuevo Mexico, with Fr. Bernardino de Quevedo and Fr. Pedro de Abuyoas first priors. The first church, built by P. Fray Jose de la Cruz in 1665, was destroyed by the great earthquake of 1880 \u2013 leaving intact the bell tower. Fr. Esteban D. Ibeas had a provisional structure of wood and iron built. The construction of the permanent church, which Fr. Ibeas had planned, was never realized because he was recalled to Manila, and eventually died of cancer of the tongue.\n\nARAYAT (1590)\nAmong the friars assigned to this town were Fathers Contreras, Ven. Bedoya, Ortiz, and Ossorio who built its beautiful church of cut stone and bricks. Fathers Jose Torres and Juan Tarrero later rebuilt it from 1858 to 1892. Arayat owes to Fr. Torres the construction of a beautiful ba\u00f1o (bath house) at the foot of the mountain about two kilometres from the town proper, which is now still popular destination.\n\nGUAGUA (1590)\nFr. Bernardo de Quevedo founded the Guagua mission in 1590 with Fr. Juan de Zabala as first resident priest. One Augustinian wrote that \u201cGuagua occupies the second place among the convents of Pampanga, just after that of Bacolor although formerly it was number one.\u201d One reason for Guagua's progress was the existence of Parian, an area where natives mixed with Chinese merchants in marriage and in business. Originally these Chinese were refugees from persecution by Gen. Simon de Anda, who had accused them of conniving with the British invaders in 1762 and plotting to assassinate the Governor General and some Augustinians. Another Augustinian likened the Holy week processions in Guagua as comparable to those held in Spain.\n\nSASMUAN (1590)\nSexmoan (Sasmuan) visited Guagua in 1590 and Lubao in 1611. In 1613 its residents complained of the inconvenience of having to go to Lubao for Mass, confession and catechism. In 1615, Fr. Pedro de Zu\u00f1iga was appointed vicar of Sexmoan. Fr. Jose Duque built he first chronicler Fray Gaspar de San Agustin wrote; \u201cThe church is very beautiful, and it is placed under the advocation of Santa Lucia the convent is of first class too\u201d. Both buildings were swept away by the overflowing river beside them. In 1884, Fr. Toribio Fanjul restored the church.\n\nPORAC (1594)\nFr. Mateo de Peralta founded Porac in 1954 by organizing the Negritoes from various rancherias into a single town. In 1607, Porac was annexed to Bacolor as a visit; in 1641, the convent was relieved of its obligation to pay rent to Manila due to extreme poverty. Fathers Manuel Obregon (1726) and Nicolas Mornier (1735) are credited to have constructed the church, which was destroyed by an earthquake in 1863 and restored by Frs. Isidoro Fernando and Esteban Ibeas (while stationed at Sta. Rita). Damaged again in World War II, it was restored by Fr. Daniel Castrillo, the last Augustinian parish priest of Pampanga.\n\nAPALIT (1597)\nThe first prior was Fr. Pedro de Vergara, but it was Fr. Juan Cabello that started the construction of the first church constructed by Fr. Antonio Redondo in 1876-83. It cost P40,000 but Fr. Redondo spent on P 30, 000 through good fiscal management. It is said that the sacristan would go around town ringing a bell and preceded by the brass band, and the townspeople would follow him with their donations of sand and other materials; \u201cwhole town of Apalit helped either with monetary donations, personal service or their good wishes.\n\nMAGALANG (1605)\nFr. Gonzalo de Salazar served as first prior in 1605 in the town's original site at barrio Macapsa. It was transferred to San Bartolome, which was abandoned due to flood in 1856, prompting another transfer, to its present site in barrio Talimunduc. Fr. Ramon Sarrionandia supervised the transfer and gave the town its name San Pedro de Magalang. The first church, built in 1725 in San Bartolome, was destroyed in the flood; the present church was built by Fr. Sarrionandia in 1886.\n\nMINALIN (1614)\nMinalin was segregated from its matrix Macabebe in 1614; Fr. Miguel de Salda\u00f1a served as the first prior only in 1618. No records exist on when the church was constructed and by whom; only one record states it was finished in 1834. Augustinian figures as well as what appears to be a map of the town marked 1619 (although unlikely the map was painted in that year) are found in the convent.\n\nSANTA RITA (1726)\nFr. Pedro de San Nicolas served as minister of both Porac and Sta. Rita in 1722, but it was only in 1726 when Sta. Rita had its own priest and therefore became an independent parish. Fr. Francisco Royo built the present church in 1839; Fr. Juan Merino completed it in 1868. These two priests also opened the road linking Sta. Rita with Porac and Guagua. During the Revolution, the townspeople hid their last Augustinian parish priest, Fr. Celestino Garcia in their houses until the forces of Gen. Maximino Hizon captured him in Bacolor and took him all the way to Lepanto in the Cordilleras.\n\nSAN LUIS (1740) \nFormerly known as San Nicolas de Cabagsa, in honor of former parish priest Fr. Nicolas de Ordu\u00f1o (cabagsac means a place where fruit bags are bagged out), the town had Fr. Jose Echevarria as first prior in 1742. There is no data on who built the church or when, except that Fr. Isidro Bernardo made great restorations in 1883.\n\nSAN FERNANDO (1754)\nSan Fernando had its first prior, Fr. Sebastian Moreno, only two years after its foundation in 1754. He also started the construction of the church; Fr. Mariano Alafont completed it in 1761. Destroyed in 1828, it was restored by Fr. Pedro Medina and Fr. Antonio Redondo, who had paintings done on the ceiling and the majestic dome built. It was destroyed again in 1899 by Antonio Luna's soldiers, rebuilt, and then burned down in 1939. Archt. Fernando Ocampo, who designed it after the war.\n\nSANTA ANA (1756)\nAs early as 1598, the town (formerly named Pimpin) functioned as visita of Arayat, and it was in 1756 that Augustinians declared it an independent parish, with Fr. Lorenzo Guerra as first prior. The church was built in 1853; Fr. Lucas Gonzales added the five-story belfry in 1857. The stones used came from Meycauayan and the wood from Porac and Betis.\n\nSAN SIMON (1771)\nThe town's original name was Virgen del Pilar, after its founder, Mariano del Pilar de los Reyes. After the British Occupation of 1762-65, Gen. Simon de Anda renamed it San Simon after his own name. The Augustinians appointed the first prior only in 1771, Fr. Fernando Medalla. In 1870, Fr. Benito Ubierna built the first church; the revolutionaries burned it down in 1898.\n\nSTO. TOMAS (1793)\nFormerly called Baliuag, Sto. Tomas parish was founded in 1763, by secular priests, although by 1853 the Augustinians had reclaimed it. The church was built by secular priest, later repaired by Fray Guillermo Masnou. Convent was built later by Fray Tarrero and Fray Bedoya.\n\nANGELES (1820)\nThe former barrio of San Fernando became a separate town in 1829. Initially ministered by a secular priest, Angeles (formerly Culiat) got its first Augustinian prior, Fr. Vicente Andres, in 1843.  Fr. Guillermo Masnou built a wooden church in 1855 to replace the first nipa church, while Fr. Ramon Sarrionandia started the construction in 1860 of the present stone edifice. Fr. Rufino Santos (not the cardinal) did some restoration work in 1893. It took 37 years to complete the church in 1897.\n\nFLORIDABLANCA (1867)\nFormerly a hacienda of Lubao called San Jose de Calumpaui, the town was renamed Floridablanca after the Count of Floridablanca, Spain (Don Jose Monino), who reportedly owned vast tracts of land in the town.  Fr. Jose Hernandez served as the first prior after the town became a parish in 1867, the same year Calumpaui became Floridablanca.  Fr. Luciano Morron Ylla constructed the church and convent in 1887.  The parish was under the Augustinians until 1960.\n\nMASANTOL (1887)\nThe town, formerly a barrio of Macabebe, was founded in 1887\u2014probably the last own founded by the Augustinians in Pampanga.  It became an independent parish with the name San Miguel de Masantol in 1894.\n\nMABALACAT (1712)\nThis town was formerly an earlier mission of the Augustinians. Due to some insurmountable difficulties it was abandoned and later was given to the Augustinian Recollects in 1712. Fr. Andres de San Fulgencio is one of the three friars who pioneered in the mission. The famous bamboo organ builder, Fr. Diego Cera's first assignment after his ordination in Spain. It was turn over to the secular priest in 1898.\n\n==Suffragan dioceses==\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Balanga|Diocese of Balanga]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Iba|Diocese of Iba]]\n*[[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarlac|Diocese of Tarlac]]\n\n==Prelates of the See==\n\n===Ordinary before the Elevation to a Metropolitan See===\n*1949-1957 (Resigned) : '''Most Rev.

Cristo Del Perdon==\nTrue to form, Kapampangans make a big fuss over appearances; they don't quite know how to solve the problem of two images of the same Virgen\u2014the officially crowned replica and the sidelined antique original. The crusade, in which the image of Our Lady of Remedies (Virgen de los Remedios) is taken in daily processions all over Pampanga 365 days a year, is tradition that can be found only in this province of Pampanga. Today, however, the original purpose of the crusade - and the Virgin - have long since forgotten: the fact that the crusade was established to help in the battle against the Communist [[Hukbalahap]] in the province in the 1950s.\n\n[[File:Crusade of Virgen Delos Remedios & Sto. Cristo del Perdon.jpg|thumb|331x331px|The Crusade of the Virgen De Los Remedios & Sto. Cristo Del Perdon during their visit in Christ, Prince of Peace Parish in October 2011.]]\nOn one hand, the original image stays in its original chapel in Baliti, San Fernando City, on the other hand, three replicas have been made to serve as symbols of the crusade. The Baliti faithful recently begun actively promoting its shrine as a pilgrimage site, a la Our Lady of Manaoag in Pangasinan. However, for the rest of Pampanga, devotion is mostly directed to the most visible and accessible two pilgrim images which are replicas of the replica; these two images are processioned non-stop even to the farthest fishing villages and mountain hamlets. However, the biggest crowds gather (albeit once a year only) around the first replica of the original image, the one that is taken out once a year (from the Archdiocesan Chancery) for the annual coronation rites (alternately in San Fernando and Angeles). Thus, there are four identical images of same Virgen de los Remedios: one stationery image in Baliti, another that is kept in the Chancery, taken out only every September 8; and the two pilgrim images constantly going around the province for the crusade. In this processions, the image of the Santo Cristo de Perdon accompanies the Virgen\u2014underscoring the belief of Catholics that the Blessed Virgin helps bring Christ even to the most unreachable people.\n\n=== Beginning of the devotions ===\n\nIt all began when the Diocese of San Fernando was created on December 11, 1948 as a separate diocese away from the Archdiocese of Manila. Its first bishop was the most Rev. Cesar Ma. Guerrero, DD, who immediately identified the most pressing problem of Pampanga as the peasant uprising against the feudal system, fueled by a communist ideology. Socialist mayors were being elected, including those in Angeles and San Fernando; the sonorous sound of the tambuli was a nightly occurrence, and so were parades of peasants waving red flags. The people did go to Mass, pray the Angelus and the rosary, but as Bishop Guerrero said, \u201cAqui en Pampanga hay mucha piedad, pero poca caridad!\u201d (\u201cHere in Pampanga there is much piety, but little charity!\u201d) in the vernacular: \u201cDeng Kapampangan, mapangadi la, pero ali la mapamie!\u201d\n\nAfter much prayer and reflection, to counteract Communist support among the farmers of Pampanga Bishop Guerrero established the Cruzada ning Pamanisi at Lugud (Crusade of Penance and Charity), during a meeting held on the third Sunday of February, 1952, at the San Guillermo Parish in Bacolor, Pampanga. He appointed the parish's co-adjutor Fr. Diosdado Victorio as director of the Cruzada, who chose the image of the Lady of Remedies (Virgen de los Remedios), then enshrined in the Virgen de los Remedios Parish (not San Roque parish as previously thought) in Brgy. Baliti, San Fernando, Pampanga, as the image that would accompany the Cruzada across the province. It may be deduced that Bishop Guerrero's choice of patron saint may have been influenced by his personal devotion to Virgen de los Remedios, patron saint of Malate, his former parish. The beautiful andas (shoulder-borne carriage) on which the image was mounted was commissioned by Do\u00f1a Jacinta vda. De Tayag of Bacolor.\n\nThe crusade officially started on May 1, 1952, or four years after the birth of diocese, in the San Miguel Arcangel Parish on Masantol, the southernmost town of Pampanga. Throughout the year well-attended processions marked the transfer of the image from Parish to parish.\n\nPart of the tradition of the crusade was the donation of all alms and goods collected from the previously visited parish to the next parish. Soon, the processions of the Virgen de los Remedios  featured truckloads of material goods being distributed to the indigent residents; thus, Kapampangan learned to share their processions and the visits of the Virgen became joyous occasions of replenishing both the soul and the body.\n\nAnd when all the parishes had been visited by the image of the Virgen, it was the turn of Baliti, its home parish. Obviously the people of Baliti had sorely missed their beloved Virgen; they had also celebrated their fiesta earlier without the image. When the time came for the crusade's second round of provincial visits, Bishop Guerrero, who had arrived in Baliti to pick up the image, was politely told by Baliti's parish priest, Fr. Generoso Pallasingui, that his parishioners would not the allow the image to leave the parish again. Msgr. Jose de la Cruz, now 92, who was present in the meeting, said in a recent interview that Fr. Pallasigui was quite worried that \u201cblood would flow\u201d if Bishop Guerrero insisted on taking the image away. (Apparently the people and their officials had made their feelings clear to the priest earlier.)\n\nThe people of Baliti graciously lent the image of their parish patroness for the first year of provincial processions. However, when it wasn't returned in time for their barrio fiesta, and when talk circulated that the image did not belong to them anymore but to the entire province, their mood turned from gracious to sour to indignation.\n\nMsgr. De la Cruz, then the director of the Kapampangan radio program Ing Siuala nang Maria (The Voice of Mary), recalls that the bishop decided right then and there to have a replica image. \u201cConsidering that Baliti was Huk-infested at that time,\u201d Msgr. De la Cruz said, \u201cthe bishop thought it wise to let the matter rest. Besides, the Cruzada was intended to bring the people closer to God, not away from Him.\u201d He said the people may have reacted to an earlier comment he had made on the program that \u201cno single parish owns the Virgen de los Remedios. Every parish that the image visits owns it in the duration of the visit\". The comment is canonically sound because all church edifices and all artifacts found inside are technically the property of the diocese, and thus, the image is also considered property owned by the diocese and not by the Crusade.\n\n=== Road to the coronation === \n\nThe first replica was thus hastily made by the late Victoriano Siongco of the Catholic Trade Center of San Fernando. It was so well made that when the processions began for the crusade\u2019s year 2 in late 1953, the people did not realize it was a different image. Bishop Guerrero next decided to apply to the Vatican for permission to have the image canonically crowned.\n\nThe criteria for a canonical coronation of a religious image are; (a) there must be widespread devotion around the image; and (b) the image must have proven antiquity. It was the second criterion that made Msgr. De la Cruz pause. Which of the two images should be canonically crowned the antique Baliti image or the new replica to which popular devotion had now been transferred? Bishop Guerrero told the priest. \u201cJust pray, Pepe.\u201d\n\nOn the September 8, 1956, more than 70,000 Kapampangans witnessed the canonical coronation of the replica, performed by the Pope's emissary to the Philippines, Msgr. Egidio Vagnozzi, held on capitol grounds in San Fernando.\n\nAfter that, the popular devotion around the crowned image of the Virgen de los Remedios grew even more. Towns that were visited often kept the image way beyond the allotted period, which slowed down the itinerary. It took 10 years or more before the image returned to the same town, which was why people pulled all stops whenever the image finally did come back to their town.\n\nIt was also around this time that the image of Santo Cristo del Perdon (Crucified Christ, Lord of Pardon) was added to accompany the Virgen. There was discussion on which image should come first during the procession, until it was decided to put the Santo Cristo del Perdon first, not only to emphasize that Christ should be first (despite the popular belief that the more important should be last) but also since Cruzada is based on penance, the first image that the people should see must be that of suffering.\n\nIn 1978 or 1979, San Fernando Archbishop Oscar V. Cruz wanted to solve the problem of the extremely slow pace of the Virgen's provincial rounds. There was a proposal to have (9) new images made so that each of the diocese's nine vicariates (cluster of parishes based on geography) would have its own Virgen. Msgr. De la Cruz informed Archbishop Cruz that \u201cIt was not the intention of Bishop Guerrero to have multiple images going around\u201d So the compromise was reached that only two images should go around, one for the northern towns of Pampanga, and one for the southern towns. But then again, the bishop anticipated debate on which group of towns would get the canonically crowned image and which would get the new one. So he solomonically decided to have two new replicas made for the crusade in the north and the south, while the canonically crowned image would stay in the chancery (Bishop's residence) and would come out only every September 8 for the reenactment of the canonical coronation. (Many Kapampangans today erroneously call the annual event \u201ccanonical coronation\u201d the Virgen was canonically crowned only once, September 8, 1956; the succeeding September 8 events are all merely anniversaries or reenactments of that first and only canonical coronation.)\n\nThe two new images were introduced during the 1981 reenactment, held in Minalin. (Reenactments were held in whichever town the Virgen was visiting around the time of the anniversary; however, when flooding worsened after Pinatubo, especially in the southern towns, the archdiocese decided to hold the reenactment alternately between San Fernando and Angeles, simply because they are the only towns with enough facilities to accommodate the big crowds and because they are relatively dry during the monsoon season.)\n\n==Vicariates==\n\n===Vicariate of St. John Marie Vianney===\nThe [[San Fernando City, Pampanga|City of San Fernando]] and the Town of [[Bacolor, Pampanga|Bacolor]]\n\n*'''Metropolitan Cathedral of St. Ferdinand and Our Lady of Assumption Parish''' - City of San Fernando\n*'''St. Joseph, Husband of Mary Parish (Santuario de San Jose, Arsobispado de Pampanga)''' - San Jose, City of San Fernando\n*'''Sto.

They are inhabitants of Cameroon's West and Northwest Regions. They are part of the [[Semi-Bantu]] (or Grassfields Bantu) [[ethnic group]].  The Bamileke are regrouped under several groups, each under the guidance of a [[Tribal chief|chief]] or [[Fon (Cameroon)|fon]]. They speak a number of related languages from the [[Bantoid languages|Bantoid]] branch of the [[Niger\u2013Congo language family]]. These languages are closely related, however, and some classifications identify a [[Bamileke languages|Bamileke]] [[dialect continuum]] with seventeen or more dialects. The Bamileke people are known for their very striking and often intricately beaded masquerades, including the impressive elephant mask. \n\n==Organization==\nThe Bamileke are organized under several chiefdom (or fondom). Of these, the fondoms of [[Bafang]], [[Bafoussam]], [[Bandjoun]], [[Baham, Cameroon|Baham]], [[Bangangt\u00e9]], [[Bawaju]], [[Dschang]], and [[Mbouda]] are the most prominent. The Bamileke also share much history and culture with the neighbouring fondoms of the [[Northwest Region, Cameroon|Northwest region]] and notably the [[Lebialem]] region of the [[Southwest Region, Cameroon|Southwest region]], but the groups have been divided since their territories were split between the French and English in [[Scramble for Africa|colonial times]].\n\n==Languages==\n{{main|Bamileke languages}}\nFollowing Ethnologue classification, we can identify 11 different languages or dialects:\n\nVariants of [[Ghomala']] are spoken in most of the [[Mifi]], [[Koung-Khi]], [[Hauts-Plateaux]] [[Departments of Cameroon|department]]s, the eastern [[Menoua]], and portions of [[Bamboutos]], by 260,00 people (1982, SIL). The main fondoms are [[Baham, Cameroon|Baham]], [[Bafoussam]], [[Bamendjou]], [[Bandjoun]].\n\nTowards southwest is spoken [[Fe'fe' language|Fe'fe']] in the [[Haut-Nkam|Upper Nkam division]]. The main towns include [[Bafang]], [[Baku]], and [[K\u00e9kem]].\n\n[[Nda'nda']] occupy the western third of the [[Nd\u00e9]] division. The major settlement is at [[Bazou]].\n\n[[Yemba language|Yemba]] is spoken by 300,000 or more people in 1992. Their lands span most of the [[Menoua]] division to the west of the Bandjoun, with their capital at [[Dschang]]. [[Fokou\u00e9]] is another major settlement.\n\n[[Medumba]] is spoken in most of the Nd\u00e9 division, by 210,000 people in 1991, with major settlements at [[Bangangt\u00e9]] and [[Tonga]].\n\n[[Mengaka]], [[Ngiemboon]], [[Ngomba language|Ngomba]] and [[Ngombale]] are spoken in [[Mbouda]].\n\n'''Kwa''' is spoken between the Nd\u00e9 and the Littoral region, '''[[Ngwe language|Ngwe]]''' around Fontem in the Southwest region, and [[Mmuock_language|Mmuock (language)]] by the [[Mmuock]] people in the Lebialem division of the Southwest region.\n\nBamileke belongs to the Mbam-Nkam group of Grassfields languages, whose attachment to the Bantu division is still disputed. While some consider it a Bantu or semi-Bantu language, others prefer to include Bamileke in the [[Niger-Congo]] group.<ref name=\"Bamileke Language\">{{cite web |title=Cameroon: Treatment of members of the Bamileke tribe by the authorities, and the language spoken and written by this tribe |url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3f7d4d7134.html |website=Refworld |publisher=Canada: Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada |accessdate=10 June 2018}}</ref>[[File:V\u00e9g\u00e9tation Bamougong.jpg|left|thumb|Bamileke Grassland|alt=|300x300px]]\n==History==\n<!---Main source: ''\u201cHistoire et anthropologie du peuple bamil\u00e9k\u00e9\u201d'' (Paris: l\u2019Harmattan, 2016, 338p.), by Dieudonn\u00e9 Toukam.ISBN 978-2-296-11827-0--->\nThe Bamileke, whose origins trace to Egypt, migrated to what is now northern Cameroon between the 11th and 14th centuries. In the 17th century they migrated further south and west to avoid being forced to convert to Islam. Today, a majority of peoples within this people cluster are Christians. The Bamileke are the native people of three regions of Cameroon, namely West, North-West and South-West. Though greater part of this people are from the West region, it is estimated that almost half of Bamileke are from the English speaking regions, the majority of which are from the North-West region (there are 123 Bamileke groupings in this region, against 6 in the South-West and 106 in the Western region). The Grassfields area therefore encompasses the West and North-West and small part of the South-West region of Cameroon. Apart from the Bamileke, there are other tribes that are historically more or less linked to the Bamileke, whether by blood or through certain cultural intercourse  (Dieudonn\u00e9 Toukam, \u201cHistoire et anthropologie du peuple bamil\u00e9k\u00e9\u201d, 2016), as well as recently settled foreigners (Fulani, Haoussa, Igbo, etc.)\n\nThe Bamileke speak a semi-Bantu language and are related to [[Bantu peoples]].  Historically, the [[Bamum people|Bamun]] and the Bamileke were united. The founder of the Bamun group ([[Nchare]]) was the younger brother of the founder of Bafoussam. Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 are a group comprising many tribes. In this group, there are several superficial cultural disparities, including Dschang, Bafang, [[Baga people|Bagangt\u00e9]], Mbouda and Bafoussam.\n\nDuring the mid-17th century, the Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 people's forefathers left the North to avoid being forced to convert to Islam. They migrated as far south as Foumban. Conquerors came all the way to Foumban to try to impose Islam on them. A war began, pushing some people to leave while others remained, submitting to Islam. This marks the division between the Bamun and Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 people.\n\nBantu refers to a large, complex linguistic grouping of peoples in Africa. The Cameroon-Bamileke Bantu people cluster encompasses multiple Bantu ethnic groups primarily found in Cameroon, the largest of which is the Bamileke. [[File:Funeral rite in Mmuock Leteh.jpg|thumb|A funeral rite performed in Mmuock Leteh, Southwest Region|alt=|350x350px]]\nIn the 17th century they migrated further south and west to avoid being forced to convert to Islam. Another reason for migration was to resist enslavement during the [[Atlantic Slave Trade]]. Today, a majority of peoples within this people cluster are Christians.\n\n===German administration===\n[[Germany]] gained control of \"Kamerun\" in 1884. <!-- The Bamileke quickly adapted to the new realities of [[colonialism]] by establishing themselves as enterprising traders and partners with the new rulers. The Germans urged or forced large numbers of Bamileke settlers to move south to work the coastal [[plantation]]s they had planted there. This is wrong. At that time, the German was only at the coast of \"Cameroon\" -->\n\nThe [[Germany|Germans]] first applied the term \"Bamileke\" to the people as administrative shorthand for the people of the region. <!-- It was during German (and later [[France|French]]) colonial rule that the Bamileke first began to regard themselves as a single, albeit fragmented, people. This is not true-->\n\n===French administration and post-independence===\nThe Bamileke are very dynamic and have a great sense of entrepreneurship. Thus, they can be found in almost all regions of Cameroon and in the world, mainly as business owners.\n\nIn 1955, the colonial French power banned the [[Union des Populations du Cameroun]] (UPC) political party, which was claiming the independence of Cameroon. Following that, the French started an offensive against UPC militants. Much of fighting occurred in the West region, region of the Bamileke. Some tens of thousands of people died in the UPC conflict with French and Cameroonian troops.<ref>The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Africa (1981)</ref><ref>\"WHPSI\": The World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators by Charles Lewis Taylor</ref><ref>Johnson, Willard R. 1970. The Cameroon Federation; political integration in a fragmentary society. Princeton: Princeton University Press.</ref>\n\n==Lifestyle and settlement patterns==\n\n===Political structure and agriculture===\n[[Image:Statue d'un chef coutumier \u00e0 Bana.jpg|thumb|Statue of a chief at [[Bana, Cameroon|Bana]].]]\n[[File:Bamileke Notables Seat.jpg|left|thumb|Stool used by notables of the Fon's (kings) of the Bamileke court. ]]\nThe Bamileke's settlements follow a well-organized and structured pattern. Houses of family members are often grouped together, often surrounded by small fields. Men typically clear the fields, but it is largely women who work them. Most work is done with tools such as machetes and hoes. Staple crops include [[Taro|cocoyam]]s, [[peanut|groundnut]]s and [[maize]].\n\nBamileke settlement are organized as chiefdoms. The chief, or ''fon'' or ''fong'' is considered as the spiritual, political, judicial and military leader. The Chief is also considered as the 'Father' of the chiefdom. He thus has great respect from the population. The successor of the 'Father' is chosen among his children. The successor's identity is typically kept secret until the fon's death.\n\nThe fon has typically 9 ministers and several other advisers and councils. The ministers are in charge of the crowning of the new fon.\nThe council of ministers, also known as the Council of Notables is called ''Kamveu''. In addition, a \"queen mother\" or ''mafo'' was an important figure for some fons in the past. Below the fon and his advisers lie a number of ward heads, each responsible for a particular portion of the village. Some Bamileke groups also recognise sub-chiefs, or ''fonte''.\n\n===Economic activities===\nTraditional homes are constructed by first erecting a [[raffia]]-pole frame into four square walls. Builders then stuff the resulting holes with grass and cover the whole building with mud. The thatched roof is typically shaped into a tall cone.

After a man's death, all of his possessions typically go to a single, male heir. [[Polygamy]] (more specifically, [[polygyny]]) is practiced, and some important individuals may have literally hundreds of wives. Marriages typically involve a [[bride price]] to be paid to the bride's family.\n\nIt is argued that the Bamileke inheritance customs contributed to their success in the modern world:\n\n\"Succession and inheritance rules are determined by the principle of [[patrilineal]] descent. According to custom, the eldest son is the probable heir, but a father may choose any one of his sons to succeed him. An heir takes his dead father's name and inherits any titles held by the latter, including the right to membership in any societies to which he belonged. And, until the mid-1960s, when the law governing polygamy was changed, the heir also inherited his father's wives--a considerable economic responsibility. The rights in land held by the deceased were conferred upon the heir subject to the approval of the chief, and, in the event of financial inheritance, the heir was not obliged to share this with other family members. The ramifications of this are significant. First, dispossessed family members were not automatically entitled to live off the wealth of the heir. Siblings who did not share in the inheritance were, therefore, strongly encouraged to make it on their own through individual initiative and by assuming responsibility for earning their livelihood. Second, this practice of individual responsibility in contrast to a system of strong family obligations prevented a drain on individual financial resources. Rather than spend all of the inheritance maintaining unproductive family members, the heir could, in the contemporary period, utilize his resources in more financially productive ways such as for savings and investment. [...] Finally, the system of inheritance, along with the large-scale migration resulting from population density and land pressures, is one of the internal incentives that accounts for Bamileke success in the nontraditional world\".<ref>A.I.D.

They are inhabitants of Cameroon's West and Northwest Regions. They are part of the [[Semi-Bantu]] (or Grassfields Bantu) [[ethnic group]].  The Bamileke are regrouped under several groups, each under the guidance of a [[Tribal chief|chief]] or [[Fon (Cameroon)|fon]]. They speak a number of related languages from the [[Bantoid languages|Bantoid]] branch of the [[Niger\u2013Congo language family]]. These languages are closely related, however, and some classifications identify a [[Bamileke languages|Bamileke]] [[dialect continuum]] with seventeen or more dialects. The Bamileke people are known for their very striking and often intricately beaded masquerades, including the impressive elephant mask. \n\n==Organization==\nThe Bamileke are organized under several chiefdom (or fondom). Of these, the fondoms of [[Bafang]], [[Bafoussam]], [[Bandjoun]], [[Baham, Cameroon|Baham]], [[Bangangt\u00e9]], [[Bawaju]], [[Dschang]], and [[Mbouda]] are the most prominent. The Bamileke also share much history and culture with the neighbouring fondoms of the [[Northwest Region, Cameroon|Northwest region]] and notably the [[Lebialem]] region of the [[Southwest Region, Cameroon|Southwest region]], but the groups have been divided since their territories were split between the French and English in [[Scramble for Africa|colonial times]].\n\n==Languages==\n{{main|Bamileke languages}}\nFollowing Ethnologue classification, we can identify 11 different languages or dialects:\n\nVariants of [[Ghomala']] are spoken in most of the [[Mifi]], [[Koung-Khi]], [[Hauts-Plateaux]] [[Departments of Cameroon|department]]s, the eastern [[Menoua]], and portions of [[Bamboutos]], by 260,00 people (1982, SIL). The main fondoms are [[Baham, Cameroon|Baham]], [[Bafoussam]], [[Bamendjou]], [[Bandjoun]].\n\nTowards southwest is spoken [[Fe'fe' language|Fe'fe']] in the [[Haut-Nkam|Upper Nkam division]]. The main towns include [[Bafang]], [[Baku]], and [[K\u00e9kem]].\n\n[[Nda'nda']] occupy the western third of the [[Nd\u00e9]] division. The major settlement is at [[Bazou]].\n\n[[Yemba language|Yemba]] is spoken by 300,000 or more people in 1992. Their lands span most of the [[Menoua]] division to the west of the Bandjoun, with their capital at [[Dschang]]. [[Fokou\u00e9]] is another major settlement.\n\n[[Medumba]] is spoken in most of the Nd\u00e9 division, by 210,000 people in 1991, with major settlements at [[Bangangt\u00e9]] and [[Tonga]].\n\n[[Mengaka]], [[Ngiemboon]], [[Ngomba language|Ngomba]] and [[Ngombale]] are spoken in [[Mbouda]].\n\n'''Kwa''' is spoken between the Nd\u00e9 and the Littoral region, '''[[Ngwe language|Ngwe]]''' around Fontem in the Southwest region, and [[Mmuock_language|Mmuock (language)]] by the [[Mmuock]] people in the Lebialem division of the Southwest region.\n\nBamileke belongs to the Mbam-Nkam group of Grassfields languages, whose attachment to the Bantu division is still disputed. While some consider it a Bantu or semi-Bantu language, others prefer to include Bamileke in the [[Niger-Congo]] group.<ref name=\"Bamileke Language\">{{cite web |title=Cameroon: Treatment of members of the Bamileke tribe by the authorities, and the language spoken and written by this tribe |url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3f7d4d7134.html |website=Refworld |publisher=Canada: Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada |accessdate=10 June 2018}}</ref>[[File:V\u00e9g\u00e9tation Bamougong.jpg|left|thumb|Bamileke Grassland|alt=|300x300px]]\n==History==\n<!---Main source: ''\u201cHistoire et anthropologie du peuple bamil\u00e9k\u00e9\u201d'' (Paris: l\u2019Harmattan, 2016, 338p.), by Dieudonn\u00e9 Toukam.ISBN 978-2-296-11827-0--->\nThe Bamileke, whose origins trace to Egypt, migrated to what is now northern Cameroon between the 11th and 14th centuries. In the 17th century they migrated further south and west to avoid being forced to convert to Islam. Today, a majority of peoples within this people cluster are Christians. The Bamileke are the native people of three regions of Cameroon, namely West, North-West and South-West. Though greater part of this people are from the West region, it is estimated that almost half of Bamileke are from the English speaking regions, the majority of which are from the North-West region (there are 123 Bamileke groupings in this region, against 6 in the South-West and 106 in the Western region). The Grassfields area therefore encompasses the West and North-West and small part of the South-West region of Cameroon. Apart from the Bamileke, there are other tribes that are historically more or less linked to the Bamileke, whether by blood or through certain cultural intercourse  (Dieudonn\u00e9 Toukam, \u201cHistoire et anthropologie du peuple bamil\u00e9k\u00e9\u201d, 2016), as well as recently settled foreigners (Fulani, Haoussa, Igbo, etc.)\n\nThe Bamileke speak a semi-Bantu language and are related to [[Bantu peoples]].  Historically, the [[Bamum people|Bamun]] and the Bamileke were united. The founder of the Bamun group ([[Nchare]]) was the younger brother of the founder of Bafoussam. Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 are a group comprising many tribes. In this group, there are several superficial cultural disparities, including Dschang, Bafang, [[Baga people|Bagangt\u00e9]], Mbouda and Bafoussam.\n\nDuring the mid-17th century, the Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 people's forefathers left the North to avoid being forced to convert to Islam. They migrated as far south as Foumban. Conquerors came all the way to Foumban to try to impose Islam on them. A war began, pushing some people to leave while others remained, submitting to Islam. This marks the division between the Bamun and Bamil\u00e9k\u00e9 people.\n\nBantu refers to a large, complex linguistic grouping of peoples in Africa. The Cameroon-Bamileke Bantu people cluster encompasses multiple Bantu ethnic groups primarily found in Cameroon, the largest of which is the Bamileke. [[File:Funeral rite in Mmuock Leteh.jpg|thumb|A funeral rite performed in Mmuock Leteh, Southwest Region|alt=|350x350px]]\nIn the 17th century they migrated further south and west to avoid being forced to convert to Islam. Another reason for migration was to resist enslavement during the [[Atlantic Slave Trade]]. Today, a majority of peoples within this people cluster are Christians.\n\n===German administration===\n[[Germany]] gained control of \"Kamerun\" in 1884. <!-- The Bamileke quickly adapted to the new realities of [[colonialism]] by establishing themselves as enterprising traders and partners with the new rulers. The Germans urged or forced large numbers of Bamileke settlers to move south to work the coastal [[plantation]]s they had planted there. This is wrong. At that time, the German was only at the coast of \"Cameroon\" -->\n\nThe [[Germany|Germans]] first applied the term \"Bamileke\" to the people as administrative shorthand for the people of the region. <!-- It was during German (and later [[France|French]]) colonial rule that the Bamileke first began to regard themselves as a single, albeit fragmented, people. This is not true-->\n\n===French administration and post-independence===\nThe Bamileke are very dynamic and have a great sense of entrepreneurship. Thus, they can be found in almost all regions of Cameroon and in the world, mainly as business owners.\n\nIn 1955, the colonial French power banned the [[Union des Populations du Cameroun]] (UPC) political party, which was claiming the independence of Cameroon. Following that, the French started an offensive against UPC militants. Much of fighting occurred in the West region, region of the Bamileke. Some tens of thousands of people died in the UPC conflict with French and Cameroonian troops.<ref>The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Africa (1981)</ref><ref>\"WHPSI\": The World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators by Charles Lewis Taylor</ref><ref>Johnson, Willard R. 1970.

Houses of family members are often grouped together, often surrounded by small fields. Men typically clear the fields, but it is largely women who work them. Most work is done with tools such as machetes and hoes. Staple crops include [[Taro|cocoyam]]s, [[peanut|groundnut]]s and [[maize]].\n\nBamileke settlement are organized as chiefdoms. The chief, or ''fon'' or ''fong'' is considered as the spiritual, political, judicial and military leader. The Chief is also considered as the 'Father' of the chiefdom. He thus has great respect from the population. The successor of the 'Father' is chosen among his children. The successor's identity is typically kept secret until the fon's death.\n\nThe fon has typically 9 ministers and several other advisers and councils. The ministers are in charge of the crowning of the new fon.\nThe council of ministers, also known as the Council of Notables is called ''Kamveu''. In addition, a \"queen mother\" or ''mafo'' was an important figure for some fons in the past. Below the fon and his advisers lie a number of ward heads, each responsible for a particular portion of the village. Some Bamileke groups also recognise sub-chiefs, or ''fonte''.\n\n===Economic activities===\nTraditional homes are constructed by first erecting a [[raffia]]-pole frame into four square walls. Builders then stuff the resulting holes with grass and cover the whole building with mud. The thatched roof is typically shaped into a tall cone. Nowadays, however, this type of construction is mostly reserved for barns, storage buildings, and gathering places for various traditional [[secret society|secret societies]]. Instead, modern Bamileke homes are made of bricks of either sun-dried mud or of concrete. Roofs are of metal sheeting.[[File:Fun\u00e9railles-Bamougong.jpg|thumb|Performers enacting a ''zing'', a funeral dance, at Bamougong with elephant mask|alt=Elephant Mask]]\n\n===Religious beliefs===\nDuring the colonial period, parts of the Bamileke adopted [[Christianity]].

It received its name from [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]], the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] consul and victor of the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands]] who negotiated it with a subordinate of [[Hamilcar Barca]] in 241 BC. According to the historian [[Polybius]], the terms of the accord dictated that [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] must evacuate [[Sicily]], not make war upon [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] or its allies, hand over all prisoners taken during the war, and pay an indemnity of 2200 [[talent (weight)|talents]] (66 tons) of silver in 20 annual installments. Originally rejected by the Roman people, these terms were eventually adopted with very little change under the authority of Quintus Lutatius Cerco, the brother of Gaius Lutatius Catulus. In the final agreement, Carthage was only given ten years to pay an indemnity of 3200 talents (96 tons), and had to evacuate the islands between [[Sicily]] and [[Italy]] ([[Ustica]] and the [[Aeolian Islands]]) and [[Aegadian Islands]] off western coast of Sicily.\n\n==Sources==\n\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|Polybius}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the First Punic War{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa|188}} BC), a Greek sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for his [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the end of the war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the treaty in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war and the treaty that ended it exist, but in fragmentary or summary form.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} Modern historians usually also take into account the histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}}\n\n== First Punic War ==\n\nThe [[Roman Republic]] had been [[Roman expansion in Italy|aggressively expanding]] in the southern Italian mainland for a century before the First Punic War.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=157\u2013158}} It had conquered peninsular Italy south of the River [[Arno]] by 272 BC.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=21\u201322}} During this period [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], with its capital in what is now [[Tunisia]], had come to dominate southern [[Spain]], much of the coastal regions of North Africa, the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Corsica]], [[Sardinia]], and the western half of [[Sicily]] in a military and commercial empire.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=29\u201330}} In 264 BC Carthage and Rome were the preeminent powers in the western Mediterranean.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=25\u201326}} The two states had several times asserted their mutual friendship via [[Treaties between Rome and Carthage|formal alliances]]: in 509 BC, 348 BC and around 279 BC.

Their experience over the previous two centuries of warfare on Sicily was that decisive action was impossible; military efforts petered out after heavy losses and huge expense.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=179}} The Carthaginians were defeated in several large naval battles; shortly after the last of these, the large majority of the Roman fleet was destroyed in a storm, with an estimated loss of 100,000 men.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=107\u2013108, 110\u2013115, 115\u2013116}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=78}} The Romans rapidly rebuilt their fleet, to lose another 150 ships to another storm in 253 BC. They rebuilt again, and in 250 BC blockaded the main Carthaginian base on Sicily of [[Lilybaeum]] with 200 warships.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=189\u2013190}}\n\nThe Carthaginians broke the blockade in 249 BC with victories at [[Battle of Drepana|Drepana]] and [[Battle of Phintias|Phintias]]. These defeats so demoralized the Romans that they restricted their naval activities to small-scale operations for seven years.{{sfn|Casson|1995|pp=149\u2013150}}{{sfn|Rankov|2015|p=163}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=122} The war had developed into a struggle in which the Romans were attempting to decisively defeat the Carthaginians and, at a minimum, control the whole of Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=129}} The Carthaginians were engaging in their traditional policy of waiting for their opponents to wear themselves out, in the expectation of then regaining some or all of their possessions and negotiating a mutually satisfactory peace treaty. Rome was the stronger land-based power and had gained control of most of Sicily.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=92, 96\u201397, 130}} The Carthaginian leadership preferred to expand their area of control in North Africa at the expense of the [[Berbers#Antiquity|Libyans]], especially the [[Numidians]]. Carthage probably viewed Sicily as a secondary theatre.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=94}}\n\nThe Carthaginians held only two cities on Sicily: Lilybaeum and [[Drepana]]; these were well-fortified and situated on the west coast, where they could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=94\u201395}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=64\u201366}} When [[Hamilcar Barca]]{{#tag:ref|Hamilcar Barca was the father of [[Hannibal]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=165}}|group=note}} took command of the Carthaginians on Sicily in 247 BC he was only given a small army and the Carthaginian fleet was gradually withdrawn.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=144}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=92\u201394}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=95}} After more than 20 years of war, both states were financially and demographically exhausted.{{sfn|Bringmann|2007|p=127}} Evidence of Carthage's financial situation includes their request for a 2,000 [[Talent (measurement)|talent]] loan{{#tag:ref|2,000 talents was approximately {{convert|51|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=off}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} from [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], which was refused.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=92}} Rome was also close to [[Sovereign default|bankruptcy]] and the number of adult male citizens, who provided the manpower for the navy and the [[Roman legion|legions]], had declined by 17 per cent since the start of the war.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=91}}\n\nIn late 243 BC, realizing they would not capture Drepana and Lilybaeum unless they could extend their blockade to the sea, the Senate decided to build a new fleet.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} With the state's coffers exhausted, the Senate approached Rome's wealthiest citizens for loans to finance the construction of one ship each, repayable from the [[War reparations|reparations]] to be imposed on Carthage once the war was won. The result was a fleet of approximately 200 large warships, built, equipped, and crewed without government expense.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=49}} The Carthaginians raised a larger fleet which they intended to use to run supplies into Sicily. It was intercepted by the Roman fleet under [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] and [[Quintus Valerius Falto]], and in a hard-fought battle the better-trained Romans defeated the undermanned and ill-trained Carthaginian fleet.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}} After achieving this decisive victory, the Romans continued their land operations in Sicily against Lilybaeum and Drepana.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\n== Treaty ==\n[[File:Q._Lutatius_Cerco,_denarius,_109-108_BC,_RRC_305-1.jpg|thumb|250x250px|[[Denarius]] of Quintus Lutatius Cerco, minted ''circa'' 109 BC.

The reverse shows a ship within a wreath of oak leaves, alluding to the naval victory of Gaius Lutatius Catulus.{{sfn|Crawford|1974|p=315}}]]\nThe Carthaginian Senate was reluctant to allocate the resources necessary to have another fleet built and manned.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} Instead, it ordered Hamilcar to negotiate a peace treaty with the Romans, on whatever terms he could negotiate. After receiving orders to make peace , Hamilcar left Sicily in a rage, convinced that the surrender was unnecessary. The evacuation of the Carthaginian army of 20,000 men from Sicily was left in the hands of his subordinate [[Gesco (died 239 BC)|Gesco]]. It is possible that for political and prestege reasons Hamilcar did not wish to be associated with the treaty which formalised Carthage's defeat in the 23 year long war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=133}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} \n\nThe Treaty of Lutatius was signed and brought the First Punic War to its end: Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an [[indemnity]] of 3,200 talents{{#tag:ref|3,200 talents was approximately {{convert|81|lt|kg|disp=flip}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} over ten years.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}\n\nThe Treaty received its name from [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]], the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] consul and victor of the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands]] who negotiated it on behalf of the Romans. According to the historian [[Polybius]], the terms of the accord dictated that [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] must evacuate [[Sicily]], not make war upon [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] or its allies, hand over all prisoners taken during the war, and pay an indemnity of 2200 [[talent (weight)|talents]] (66 tons) of silver in 20 annual installments.

Eventually the troops mutinied and turned against Carthage. The news of a formed, experienced, anti-Carthaginian army in the heart of its territory spread rapidly and many cities and towns rose in rebellion; some were freshly conquered and all had been harshly oppressed in order to finance the recently ended war. They added 70,000 men to the rebel force and supplied finance and food. Rome pointedly declined to take advantage of Carthage's troubles and adhered to the terms of the recent treaty. Italians were prohibited from trading with the rebels but encouraged to trade with Carthage; 2,743 Carthaginian prisoners still held were released without a ransom being required and were immediately enrolled into Carthage's army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}} [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero]], the king of the Roman satellite kingdom of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], was allowed to supply Carthage with the large amounts of food it needed and was no longer able to obtain from its own hinterland.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} In late 240 or early 239 BC the Carthaginian garrisons on [[Sardinia]] joined the mutiny, killing their officers and the island's governor. The Carthaginians sent a force to retake the island. When it arrived its members also mutinied, joined the previous mutineers, and killed all of the Carthaginians on the island. The mutineers then appealed to Rome for protection, which was refused.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=212}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2000|p=376}}\n\nProbably in 237 BC{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=136}} the indigenous inhabitants of Sardinia rose up and drove out the mutinous garrison, which took refuge in Italy. As the war in Africa came to a close, they appealed again for Roman assistance. This time the Romans agreed and prepared an expedition to seize both Sardinia and [[Corsica]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}} It is unclear from the sources why the Romans acted differently from three years earlier.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=210}} Polybius held that this action was indefensible.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=569}} Carthage sent an embassy to Rome, which quoted the Treaty of Lutatius and claimed they were outfitting their own expedition to retake the island, which it had held for 300 years. The [[Roman Senate]] cynically stated that they considered the preparation of this force an act of war. Their peace terms were the ceding of Sardinia and Corsica and the payment of an additional 1,200 talent indemnity.{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=569}}{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=209, 212\u2013213}}{{#tag:ref|1,200 talents was approximately {{convert|30|lt|kg|disp=flip}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} Weakened by 30 years of war, Carthage agreed rather than enter into a conflict with Rome again.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n\nThe war had lasted 23 years, the longest war in Romano-Greek history and the greatest naval war of the ancient world.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=x}} In its aftermath Carthage attempted to avoid paying in full the foreign troops who had fought its war. Eventually [[Mercenary War|they rebelled]] and were joined by many disgruntled local groups. They were put down with great difficulty and considerable savagery. Rome took advantage of the chaos to seize Corsica and Sardinia, in defiance of the terms of their treaty.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}} They also imposed an additional 1,200 talent indemnity.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=209, 212\u2013213}}{{#tag:ref|1,200 talents was approximately {{convert|30|lt|kg|disp=flip}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} Polybius considered this act of bad faith by the Romans to be the single greatest cause of war with Carthage breaking out again in 218 BC in the [[Second Punic War]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=175}}\n\nFor Rome, the treaty marked the start of its expansion beyond the Italian Peninsula. Sicily became the first [[Roman province]] as [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicilia]], governed by a former [[praetor]]. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. Carthage was not reconciled to this situation, and when Carthage besieged the Roman-protected town of [[Saguntum]] in eastern Iberia in 218 BC, it ignited the [[Second Punic War]] with Rome.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=13}}\n\n==Notes, citations and sources==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=note|30em}}\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Bagnall |first=Nigel |date=1999 |title=The Punic Wars: Rome, Carthage and the Struggle for the Mediterranean |url={{Google Books|W9u9mCSV4AgC|plainurl=y}} |location=London |publisher=Pimlico |page= |isbn=978-0-7126-6608-4 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Bringmann|first=Klaus|title=A History of the Roman Republic|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|publisher=Polity Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7456-3370-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftlpza5l9R4C|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book |url={{Google Books|sDpMh0gK2OUC|plainurl=y}} |title=Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World |first=Lionel|last= Casson  |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-8018-5130-8|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Collins|first=Roger|title=Spain: An Oxford Archaeological Guide|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-19-285300-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Trj8L8rPVRcC|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|last=Crawford\n|first=Michael\n|date=1974\n|title=Roman Republican Coinage\n|url=\n|location=Cambridge\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|oclc=859598398\n|isbn=\n|author-link=Michael Crawford (historian)\n|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{Cite journal\n| volume =65\n| issue =1\n| pages =32\u201337\n| last =Curry\n| first =Andrew\n| title =The Weapon That Changed History\n| journal =Archaeology\n| date =2012\n| jstor =41780760\n|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|authorlink=Adrian Goldsworthy|title=The Fall of Carthage: The Punic Wars 265\u2013146 BC|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|year=2006|isbn=978-0-304-36642-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nsnFSQAACAAJ|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|last=Hau\n|first=Lisa\n|date=2016\n|title=Moral History from Herodotus to Diodorus Siculus\n|url=\n|location=Edinburgh\n|publisher=Edinburgh University Press\n|page=\n|isbn=978-1-4744-1107-3\n|author-link=\n\n|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{Cite journal\n| volume =143\n| issue =3/4\n| pages =369\u2013380 \n|first=Dexter\n|last=Hoyos\n|date=2000\n| title =Towards a Chronology of the 'Truceless War', 241\u2013237 B.

It received its name from [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]], the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] consul and victor of the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands]] who negotiated it with a subordinate of [[Hamilcar Barca]] in 241 BC. According to the historian [[Polybius]], the terms of the accord dictated that [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] must evacuate [[Sicily]], not make war upon [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]] or its allies, hand over all prisoners taken during the war, and pay an indemnity of 2200 [[talent (weight)|talents]] (66 tons) of silver in 20 annual installments. Originally rejected by the Roman people, these terms were eventually adopted with very little change under the authority of Quintus Lutatius Cerco, the brother of Gaius Lutatius Catulus. In the final agreement, Carthage was only given ten years to pay an indemnity of 3200 talents (96 tons), and had to evacuate the islands between [[Sicily]] and [[Italy]] ([[Ustica]] and the [[Aeolian Islands]]) and [[Aegadian Islands]] off western coast of Sicily.\n\n==Sources==\n\n[[File:Stele des Polybios.jpg|thumb|upright=0.45|alt=A monochrome relief stele depicting a man in classical Greek clothing raising one arm|{{center|Polybius}}]]\n\nThe main source for almost every aspect of the First Punic War{{#tag:ref|The term ''Punic'' comes from the Latin word {{lang|la|Punicus}} (or {{lang|la|Poenicus}}), meaning \"[[History of Carthage|Carthaginian]]\", and is a reference to the Carthaginians' [[Phoenicia]]n ancestry.{{sfn|Sidwell|Jones|1997|p=16}}|group=note}} is the historian [[Polybius]] ({{circa|200}} \u2013 {{circa|188}} BC), a Greek sent to [[Rome]] in 167 BC as a hostage.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}} His works include a now lost manual on military tactics,{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=53}} but he is known today for his [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']], written sometime after 146 BC, or about a century after the end of the war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=20}}{{sfn|Walbank|1990|pp=11\u201312}} Polybius's work is considered broadly objective and largely neutral as between Carthaginian and Roman points of view.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi}}{{sfn|Hau|2016|pp=23\u201324}}\n\nCarthaginian written records [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|were destroyed]] along with their capital, [[Carthage]], in 146 BC and so Polybius's account of the First Punic War is based on several, now-lost, [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin]] sources.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=23}} Polybius was an analytical historian and wherever possible personally interviewed participants in the events he wrote about.{{sfn|Shutt|1938|p=55}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}} Only the first book of the 40 comprising ''The Histories'' deals with the First Punic War.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}} The accuracy of Polybius's account has been much debated over the past 150 years, but the modern consensus is to accept it largely at face value, and the details of the treaty in modern sources are almost entirely based on interpretations of Polybius's account.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=20\u201321}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|pp=x\u2013xi, 82\u201384}} The modern historian Andrew Curry considers that \"Polybius turns out to [be] fairly reliable\";{{sfn|Curry|2012|p=34}} while Dexter Hoyos describes him as \"a remarkably well-informed, industrious, and insightful historian\".{{sfn|Hoyos|2015|p=102}} Other, later, histories of the war and the treaty that ended it exist, but in fragmentary or summary form.{{sfn|Tipps|1985|p=432}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=22}} Modern historians usually also take into account the histories of [[Diodorus Siculus]] and [[Cassius Dio|Dio Cassius]], although the classicist [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] states that \"Polybius' account is usually to be preferred when it differs with any of our other accounts\".{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=21}}{{#tag:ref|Sources other than Polybius are discussed by Bernard Mineo in \"Principal Literary Sources for the Punic Wars (apart from Polybius)\".{{sfn|Mineo|2015|pp=111\u2013127}}|group=note}}\n\n== First Punic War ==\n\nThe [[Roman Republic]] had been [[Roman expansion in Italy|aggressively expanding]] in the southern Italian mainland for a century before the First Punic War.{{sfn|Miles|2011|pp=157\u2013158}} It had conquered peninsular Italy south of the River [[Arno]] by 272 BC.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=21\u201322}} During this period [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]], with its capital in what is now [[Tunisia]], had come to dominate southern [[Spain]], much of the coastal regions of North Africa, the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Corsica]], [[Sardinia]], and the western half of [[Sicily]] in a military and commercial empire.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=29\u201330}} In 264 BC Carthage and Rome were the preeminent powers in the western Mediterranean.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=25\u201326}} The two states had several times asserted their mutual friendship via [[Treaties between Rome and Carthage|formal alliances]]: in 509 BC, 348 BC and around 279 BC.

Carthage probably viewed Sicily as a secondary theatre.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=94}}\n\nThe Carthaginians held only two cities on Sicily: Lilybaeum and [[Drepana]]; these were well-fortified and situated on the west coast, where they could be supplied and reinforced without the Romans being able to use their superior army to interfere.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=94\u201395}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=64\u201366}} When [[Hamilcar Barca]]{{#tag:ref|Hamilcar Barca was the father of [[Hannibal]].{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=165}}|group=note}} took command of the Carthaginians on Sicily in 247 BC he was only given a small army and the Carthaginian fleet was gradually withdrawn.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=144}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|pp=92\u201394}}{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=95}} After more than 20 years of war, both states were financially and demographically exhausted.{{sfn|Bringmann|2007|p=127}} Evidence of Carthage's financial situation includes their request for a 2,000 [[Talent (measurement)|talent]] loan{{#tag:ref|2,000 talents was approximately {{convert|51|lt|kg|disp=flip|abbr=off}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} from [[Ptolemaic Egypt]], which was refused.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=92}} Rome was also close to [[Sovereign default|bankruptcy]] and the number of adult male citizens, who provided the manpower for the navy and the [[Roman legion|legions]], had declined by 17 per cent since the start of the war.{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=91}}\n\nIn late 243 BC, realizing they would not capture Drepana and Lilybaeum unless they could extend their blockade to the sea, the Senate decided to build a new fleet.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=195}} With the state's coffers exhausted, the Senate approached Rome's wealthiest citizens for loans to finance the construction of one ship each, repayable from the [[War reparations|reparations]] to be imposed on Carthage once the war was won. The result was a fleet of approximately 200 large warships, built, equipped, and crewed without government expense.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=49}} The Carthaginians raised a larger fleet which they intended to use to run supplies into Sicily. It was intercepted by the Roman fleet under [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]] and [[Quintus Valerius Falto]], and in a hard-fought battle the better-trained Romans defeated the undermanned and ill-trained Carthaginian fleet.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=96}} After achieving this decisive victory, the Romans continued their land operations in Sicily against Lilybaeum and Drepana.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=125\u2013126}}\n\n== Treaty ==\n[[File:Q._Lutatius_Cerco,_denarius,_109-108_BC,_RRC_305-1.jpg|thumb|250x250px|[[Denarius]] of Quintus Lutatius Cerco, minted ''circa'' 109 BC.

The evacuation of the Carthaginian army of 20,000 men from Sicily was left in the hands of his subordinate [[Gesco (died 239 BC)|Gesco]]. It is possible that for political and prestege reasons Hamilcar did not wish to be associated with the treaty which formalised Carthage's defeat in the 23 year long war.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|p=133}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=157}}{{sfn|Bagnall|1999|p=97}} \n\nThe Treaty of Lutatius was signed and brought the First Punic War to its end: Carthage evacuated Sicily, handed over all prisoners taken during the war, and paid an [[indemnity]] of 3,200 talents{{#tag:ref|3,200 talents was approximately {{convert|81|lt|kg|disp=flip}} of silver.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=158}}|group=note}} over ten years.{{sfn|Miles|2011|p=196}}\n\nThe Treaty received its name from [[Gaius Lutatius Catulus]], the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] consul and victor of the [[Battle of the Aegates Islands]] who negotiated it on behalf of the Romans.

Eventually the troops mutinied and turned against Carthage. The news of a formed, experienced, anti-Carthaginian army in the heart of its territory spread rapidly and many cities and towns rose in rebellion; some were freshly conquered and all had been harshly oppressed in order to finance the recently ended war. They added 70,000 men to the rebel force and supplied finance and food. Rome pointedly declined to take advantage of Carthage's troubles and adhered to the terms of the recent treaty. Italians were prohibited from trading with the rebels but encouraged to trade with Carthage; 2,743 Carthaginian prisoners still held were released without a ransom being required and were immediately enrolled into Carthage's army.{{sfn|Goldsworthy|2006|pp=135\u2013136}}{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}} [[Hiero II of Syracuse|Hiero]], the king of the Roman satellite kingdom of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], was allowed to supply Carthage with the large amounts of food it needed and was no longer able to obtain from its own hinterland.{{sfn|Lazenby|1996|p=173}}{{sfn|Scullard|2006|p=568}} In late 240 or early 239 BC the Carthaginian garrisons on [[Sardinia]] joined the mutiny, killing their officers and the island's governor.

As the war in Africa came to a close, they appealed again for Roman assistance.

Sicily became the first [[Roman province]] as [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicilia]], governed by a former [[praetor]]. Henceforth Rome was the leading military power in the western Mediterranean, and increasingly the Mediterranean region as a whole. Carthage was not reconciled to this situation, and when Carthage besieged the Roman-protected town of [[Saguntum]] in eastern Iberia in 218 BC, it ignited the [[Second Punic War]] with Rome.{{sfn|Collins|1998|p=13}}\n\n==Notes, citations and sources==\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|group=note|30em}}\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{refbegin|30em|indent=yes}}\n\n* {{cite book |last=Bagnall |first=Nigel |date=1999 |title=The Punic Wars: Rome, Carthage and the Struggle for the Mediterranean |url={{Google Books|W9u9mCSV4AgC|plainurl=y}} |location=London |publisher=Pimlico |page= |isbn=978-0-7126-6608-4 |ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Bringmann|first=Klaus|title=A History of the Roman Republic|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|publisher=Polity Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7456-3370-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ftlpza5l9R4C|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book |url={{Google Books|sDpMh0gK2OUC|plainurl=y}} |title=Ships and Seamanship in the Ancient World |first=Lionel|last= Casson  |location=Baltimore |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-8018-5130-8|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book|last=Collins|first=Roger|title=Spain: An Oxford Archaeological Guide|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-19-285300-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Trj8L8rPVRcC|ref=harv}}\n<ref>[[Michael Crawford (historian)|Michael Crawford]], ''Roman Republican Coinage'', , 1974, p. 315.</ref>\n* {{cite book\n|last=Crawford\n|first=Michael\n|date=1974\n|title=Roman Republican Coinage\n|url=\n|location=Cambridge\n|publisher=Cambridge University Press\n|oclc=859598398\n|isbn=\n|author-link=Michael Crawford (historian)\n|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{Cite journal\n| volume =65\n| issue =1\n| pages =32\u201337\n| last =Curry\n| first =Andrew\n| title =The Weapon That Changed History\n| journal =Archaeology\n| date =2012\n| jstor =41780760\n|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book|last=Goldsworthy|first=Adrian|authorlink=Adrian Goldsworthy|title=The Fall of Carthage: The Punic Wars 265\u2013146 BC|publisher=Phoenix|location=London|year=2006|isbn=978-0-304-36642-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nsnFSQAACAAJ|ref=harv}}\n\n* {{cite book\n|last=Hau\n|first=Lisa\n|date=2016\n|title=Moral History from Herodotus to Diodorus Siculus\n|url=\n|location=Edinburgh\n|publisher=Edinburgh University Press\n|page=\n|isbn=978-1-4744-1107-3\n|author-link=\n\n|ref=harv}}\n\n*{{Cite journal\n| volume =143\n| issue =3/4\n| pages =369\u2013380 \n|first=Dexter\n|last=Hoyos\n|date=2000\n| title =Towards a Chronology of the 'Truceless War', 241\u2013237 B.

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"Love Is the Hero\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life (1950-1980) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self-titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. Despite a promising start, the band broke up in the late 1970s and Squier, the band's frontman, left to pursue a solo career.\n\nSquier signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and released his solo debut in spring of 1980. ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFresh off his debut album, Squier asked [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] to produce his next album, but he declined due to scheduling conflicts. However, he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]] who had produced Queen's then-latest album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack teamed to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which became a smash. Its lead single, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting the Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well charting high in Canada and Britain (where the song remains his only chart entry). \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In The Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-up singles and the album cut \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\" became a radio favourite and subsequently one of his signerature songs. Squier became popular on the new MTV cable channel as well as on Album Rock radio. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling about 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Squier noted in a 1992 interview that \"the label didn't even ''want'' 'The Stroke' on the album\".\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor''.'' The album also climbed into ''Billboard's'' Top Five and sold just under 3 million copies in the United States. The title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for 6 weeks and reached No. 32 on the Hot 100. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier led his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier's fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' came in September 1984 and brought him his third consecutive platinum certification. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. Co-produced by a veteran songwriter [[Jim Steinman]], ''Signs of Life'' saw Squier melting synth-pop into his guitar-based hard rock, which alienated his rock audience. Despite \"Rock Me Tonite\" being his highest charting US single, its homoerotic video has been considered by some, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered; he reportedly played for half-empty arenas on the most dates of Signs Of Life Tour. He fired both of his managers soon after realizing the damage and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed, that the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem as a sellout for his older fans.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued the tour and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, performing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 song on the Mainstream Rock charts and featured a performance-based music video, more familiar to his style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold a disappointing 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. It was also Squier's first album not to be supported with a tour since Capitol decided not to promote it - which later built strong tensions between the label and Squier.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]].'' It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did partly restore Squier's success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock with small hints of then-successful glam metal; it's nowadays regarded as one of the strongest inputs of his catalogue by his fanbase. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled No Excess was also well received. However, despite a promising comeback chances, Squier's popularity continued to descend and he wasn't able to pull off a notable return anymore.\n\nSquier made music into the 1990s and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. The album was criticized for the lack of innovation in songwriting and peaked only at #117 in US, becoming his lowest charting album since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies, despite its opening track \"Angry\" receiving modest airplay and becoming his last new entry on the Mainstream Rock charts. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He embarked on a mini-tour to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\".{{unsourced|section|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier joined [[Bad Company]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]] on a nationwide summer tour.\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project.

His best known and most favoured songs include \"[[The Stroke]]\", \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\", \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\", \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In the Dark]]\", \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\", \"[[Everybody Wants You]]\", \"[[Emotions in Motion]]\", \"Love Is the Hero\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\".\n\n==Career==\n\n=== Early life (1950-1980) ===\nBilly Squier was born in Wellesley, Massachusetts. He is a 1968 graduate of Wellesley High School. While growing up, he began playing piano and guitar, but did not become serious with music until discovering John Mayall's Bluesbreakers (with Eric Clapton). When Squier was nine, his grandfather taught him to play piano. After he stopped taking piano lessons, he became interested in guitar after getting one from his older brother (or as an other story goes, he bought a guitar from his neighbour for 90 dollars). Squier formed his first band, The Reltneys, when he was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vintageguitar.com/3221/billy-squier/|title=Billy Squier|last=Meeker|first=Ward|date=2015-03-01|website=Vintage Guitar\u00ae magazine|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref> \n\nSquier's first public performances were at a [[Boston]] nightclub in Kenmore Square called [[the Psychedelic Supermarket]] in 1968, which was where he saw Eric Clapton and the band [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. His first original effort was with the band Magic Terry & the Universe in 1969. In the early 1970s, he formed Kicks, which included future [[New York Dolls]] drummer [[Jerry Nolan]] and also briefly attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in 1971. He then joined The Sidewinders. Squier left the group to form the band Piper in 1976, which released two studio records, ''Piper'' and ''Can't Wait'', and was praised by critics; upon reviewing their self titled'','' ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' Magazine touted it as \"the greatest debut album ever produced by a US rock band\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annecarlini.com/ex_interviews.php?id=124 |title=Exclusive Magazine |publisher=Anne Carlini |date= |accessdate=2015-02-20}}</ref> Piper were managed by the same management company as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and opened for them during their 1977 tour, including two nights of a sold-out run at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. Despite a promising start, the band broke up in the late 1970s and Squier, the band's frontman, left to pursue a solo career.\n\nSquier signed a solo deal with [[Capitol Records]] in 1979 and released his solo debut in spring of 1980. ''[[The Tale of the Tape]]'' provided him with strong momentum, spending three months on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' album chart, though peaking only at #169. Squier's first singles \"You Should Be High Love\" and \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" missed the charts but got moderate radio play nationally. The album later became best known for the latter, whose booming drum intro (Squier beating a drum case dubbed over drummer Bobby Chouinard's backbeat) became a sampling staple in hip hop, being sampled in almost 300 songs as of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosampled.com/Billy-Squier/The-Big-Beat/|title=The Big Beat by Billy Squier on WhoSampled|website=WhoSampled|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial success (1981-1984) ===\nFresh off his debut album, Squier asked [[Brian May]] of [[Queen (band)|Queen]] to produce his next album, but he declined due to scheduling conflicts. However, he recommended [[Reinhold Mack]] who had produced Queen's then-latest album ''[[The Game (Queen album)|The Game]].'' Squier and Mack teamed to produce ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'', which became a smash. Its lead single, \"[[The Stroke]],\" became his breakthrough hit, hitting the Top 20 in the US and reaching the top five in Australia as well charting high in Canada and Britain (where the song remains his only chart entry). \"[[In the Dark (Billy Squier song)|In The Dark]]\" and \"[[My Kinda Lover]]\" were successful follow-up singles and the album cut \"[[Lonely Is the Night]]\" became a radio favourite and subsequently one of his signerature songs. Squier became popular on the new MTV cable channel as well as on Album Rock radio. ''Don't Say No'' peaked at #5 on Billboard 200 and lasted well over two years on the chart, eventually selling about 4 million copies in the US alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/billy-squier-dont-say-no/|title=Revisiting Billy Squier's Breakthrough Album, 'Don't Say No'|last=Giles|first=Jeff|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref> Squier noted in a 1992 interview that \"the label didn't even ''want'' 'The Stroke' on the album\".\n\nHis third album ''[[Emotions in Motion|Emotions In Motion]]'' was released in 1982 and became nearly as successful as its predecessor''.'' The album also climbed into ''Billboard's'' Top Five and sold just under 3 million copies in the United States. The title track of the album, on which Squier was backed by [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]], was a popular MTV video, but the album's biggest hit was \"[[Everybody Wants You]],\" which held the No. 1 spot on the ''Billboard'' Album Rock Tracks for 6 weeks and reached No. 32 on the Hot 100. Squier was the opening act for the North American leg of Queen's 1982 Hot Space Tour.<ref>{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 1982|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Queen_-_07-27-1982_-_Washington_Post_-_Capital_Centre|title=Queen's Flashy Rock}}</ref> That same year he recorded a song, \"Fast Times (The Best Years of Our Lives)\" for the film ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''. The next year, Squier led his own arena tour for the first time and was supported by English newcomer [[Def Leppard]]. He helped the band break through in the US, in conjunction with the release of their album ''[[Pyromania (album)|Pyromania]]''.\n\nSquier's fourth album ''[[Signs of Life (Billy Squier album)|Signs of Life]]'' came in September 1984 and brought him his third consecutive platinum certification. Its lead single, \"[[Rock Me Tonite]],\" reached #15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], hit the Top 10 of the [[Cash Box]] singles chart, and became his second #1 hit on the Mainstream Rock charts. Co-produced by a veteran songwriter [[Jim Steinman]], ''Signs of Life'' saw Squier melting synth-pop into his guitar-based hard rock, which alienated his rock audience. Despite \"Rock Me Tonite\" being his highest charting US single, its homoerotic video has been considered by some, including Squier himself, to be the reason for his subsequent downfall.<ref name=\"I Want My MTV\">{{cite book|last=Marks|first=Craig|title=I Want My MTV: The Uncensored Story of the Music Video Revolution|year=2011|publisher=Dutton|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-525-95230-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250 250\u201355]|chapter=21|author2=Tannenbaum, Rob|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/iwantmymtvuncens00mark/page/250}}</ref> Squier's album and ticket sales suffered; he reportedly played for half-empty arenas on the most dates of Signs Of Life Tour. He fired both of his managers soon after realizing the damage and put the biggest blame on the video's director, [[Kenny Ortega]], for misleading him and altering his original concepts. However, whereas Ortega himself has denied Squier's accusations, it is also believed, that the overall commercial appeal of ''Signs of Life'' made him seem as a sellout for his older fans.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Squier continued the tour and released two more singles from ''Signs of Life'' later that same year: hard rocker \"All Night Long\" and more experimental \"Eye on You\", though with a little chart impact. In December, he appeared on [[Saturday Night Live]] as a musical guest, performing \"Rock Me Tonite\" and \"All Night Long\", which had became his fifth Top 10 song on the Mainstream Rock charts and featured a performance-based music video, more familiar to his style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/season-10/episode/7-ed-begley-jr-with-billy-squier-64776|title=SNL Season 10 Episode 07 - Ed Begley, Jr., Billy Squier - NBC.com|website=NBC|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tampabay.com/forget-rock-me-tonite--our-love-for-billy-squier-goes-all-night-long/2264984/|title=Forget 'Rock Me Tonite' ...

The album spawned a minor hit, \"[[Love Is The Hero]]\", which featured [[Freddie Mercury]] on backing vocals, who also co-wrote and arranged the song \"Lady With a Tenor Sax\", which also appears on the album. ''Enough Is Enough'' sold a disappointing 300,000 copies and broke his platinum album streak right away. It was also Squier's first album not to be supported with a tour since Capitol decided not to promote it - which later built strong tensions between the label and Squier.\n\nSquier spent the next three years working on his sixth full-length ''[[Hear & Now (Billy Squier album)|Hear & Now]]'', which was finally released in 1989. The album peaked only at #64, but still sold a little better than ''[[Enough Is Enough (Billy Squier album)|Enough Is Enough]].'' It featured a modestly successful comeback single, his last Hot 100 hit \"Don't Say You Love Me\", which hit #58 on the Billboard Hot 100 and went to #4 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Mainstream Rock chart - his first Top 5 hit there and overall best charting single since \"[[Rock Me Tonite]]\". Also featured on the album are power ballad \"Don't Let Me Go\" and [[Desmond Child]] collaboration \"Tied Up\". The album did partly restore Squier's success by harking back to his early 1980s hard rock with small hints of then-successful glam metal; it's nowadays regarded as one of the strongest inputs of his catalogue by his fanbase. \"Don't Say You Love Me\" featured a popular MTV video and the album's promotional tour entitled No Excess was also well received. However, despite a promising comeback chances, Squier's popularity continued to descend and he wasn't able to pull off a notable return anymore.\n\nSquier continued making music into the 1990's and released his seventh album, ''[[Creatures of Habit (Billy Squier album)|Creatures of Habit]]'', in 1991. The album was criticized for the lack of innovation in songwriting and peaked only at #117 in US, becoming his lowest charting album since ''[[The Tale of the Tape|Tale of the Tape]]''. However, it did feature successful radio hits, \"She Goes Down\" - Squier's last Top 5 radio hit - and \"Facts of Life\". ''Creatures of Habit'' was supported with a tour, his last big tour for a decade.\n\nIn the middle of grunge's heyday, Squier released his final album with [[Capitol Records]] in 1993, ''[[Tell the Truth (Billy Squier album)|Tell the Truth]],'' which featured different sets of musicians performing the various tracks. Despite Squier himself comparing it favourably to ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]],'' Capitol did little to nothing to promote the product and it became his first album not to chart at all and sold an estimated 100,000 copies, despite its opening track \"Angry\" receiving modest airplay and becoming his last new entry on the Mainstream Rock charts. Feeling betrayed, he walked away from the label and music business for good.\n\nIn 1994, Squier's original screenplay ''Run To Daylight'' was short-listed at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. The film itself was never produced.\n\nOn February 17, 1998, during the initial run of ''[[Mercury: The Afterlife and Times of a Rock God]] -'' a [[monodrama]] about the life of Freddie Mercury - Squier debuted a song that he wrote in memory of his friend titled \"I Have Watched You Fly\" on stage before a performance of the play. He introduced the song by saying, \"I was privileged to know Freddie as a friend. I'm honored to share the stage with him in the afterlife.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Barron|first=James|title=PUBLIC LIVES; Theater Records|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9806E2DC153FF93BA25751C0A96E958260|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 18, 1998|author2=Martin, Douglas}}</ref> That same year Squier released independently his last studio album to date, a stripped and acoustic blues effort entitled ''[[Happy Blue]].'' He embarked on a mini-tour to showcase songs from the album, which included a stripped-down acoustic version of his [[classic rock]] mega-hit, \"[[The Stroke]]\".{{unsourced|section|date=December 2019}}\n\n=== Later career (1998-) ===\nAs time passed, Squier's albums went out of print, except for ''[[Don't Say No (Billy Squier album)|Don't Say No]]'' and some greatest hits compilations; however, many of these would later be re-released.\n\nThe year 2001 marked the 20th anniversary of ''Don't Say No.'' In the same year, Squier joined [[Bad Company]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]] on a nationwide summer tour.\n\nIn 2004, \"Everybody Wants You\" was remixed with the group Fischerspooner's song \"Emerge\" and included on the ''[[Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]]'' soundtrack. In 2006, Squier joined [[Richard Marx]], [[Edgar Winter]], [[Rod Argent]], [[Hamish Stuart]], and [[Sheila E]] touring with [[Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band]]. A documentary of the tour, including a full-length concert performance, was subsequently made available on DVD. In 2007, Squier appeared at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with [[Ronnie Spector]], [[Mitch Ryder]], [[Tone Loc]], [[Deniece Williams]], [[Dr. Hook]], and [[Tom Cochrane]]. In 2008, Squier joined [[Colin Hay]], Edgar Winter, [[Gary Wright]], Hamish Stuart and [[Gregg Bissonette]] touring with Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band. In 2009, Squier launched a nationwide summer/fall tour with a band that included drummer Nir Z, guitarist Marc Copely, long-time bassist Mark Clarke and keyboard player Alan St. Jon.\n\nSquier played a special acoustic show at B.B. King's in New York on November 30, 2005. Highlights of the show were acoustic versions of \"Everybody Wants You,\" \"Nobody Knows,\" \"Learn How to Live,\" \"Christmas is the Time to Say I Love You,\" and most of the Happy Blue project. VH1 Classic and New York hard rock radio icon Eddie Trunk introduced Squier that night as \"one of the greatest singer/songwriters in the history of rock.\"\n\nSampling of \"[[The Big Beat (Billy Squier song)|The Big Beat]]\" continued as of 2016. The late [[Jam Master Jay]]'s reference to the song as a classic beat in the early days of hip hop paid great dividends for Squier. The three-piece hip hop group [[Run DMC]] performed a track live at The Funhouse entitled \"Here We Go,\" using the song's backbeat. [[Jay-Z]]'s \"99 Problems,\" a massive hit in 2003, was on that beat, as were British grime/hip-hop MC Dizzee Rascal's \"Fix Up, Look Sharp\" [[Kanye West]]'s \"Addiction\" and, in 2012, the [[Alicia Keys]] selection \"Girl on Fire.\"\n\n<br />{{sources|section|date=December 2019}}\n\nIn May 2010, Squier was part of the Boston Legends Tribute to [[James Cotton]] including [[Magic Dick]] ([[J.
