Learning French is like any other task, it can be difficult at first, but eventually, it becomes subconscious. The earlier the student can be exposed to it, the easier it will be grasped. Students that are in French Immersion schools complete the same curriculum subjects as other schools but have the advantage of learning a new language.\n\nThe French Immersion program was designed to take benefit of children's capacity to learn freely and smoothly. Also, take advantage of their communicative competence and open perspectives on language and society. Therefore, learning French becomes unconscious, and there is a heavy focus on understanding before pronouncing.\n\n\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board]]\n* [[:Category:High schools in Hamilton, Ontario|List of High Schools in Hamilton]]\n* [[List of school districts in Ontario]]\n* [[List of high schools in Ontario]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website}}\n* {{URL|https://www.hwcdsb.ca/board/policies/|Policies, Protocols and By-Laws}}\n* {{URL|https://www.hwcdsb.ca/board/meetingsminutes/|Public Meetings and Minutes}}\n\n{{Hamilton}}\n\n[[Category:Education in Hamilton, Ontario]]\n[[Category:Roman Catholic school districts in Ontario]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Catholic school board}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2018}}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=November 2018}}\n{{Infobox school district\n| name = Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board\n| logo = Hamilton-Wentworth CDSB logo.jpg\n| logo_alt = Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board logo\n| logo_caption = Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board logo\n| address = 90 Mulberry Street\n| city = [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]\n| province = [[Ontario]]\n| postalcode = [[Postal codes in Canada|L8R 2C8]]\n| country = Canada\n| coordinates = {{coord|43.26303|N|79.87055|W|type:edu_region:CA-ON|display=inline,title}}\n| type = [[Board of education|School Board]]\n| motto = Believing, Achieving, Serving\n| grades = [[Kindergarten|K]]\u2013[[Twelfth grade|{{Ordinal|12|sup=yes}}]]\n| established = {{Unbulleted list|{{Start date and age|1855}}|1969 (amalgamation)|1998 (present form)}}\n| chair_of_the_board = Patrick J.

The knife has a distinct recurve in the blade. It is used as both a tool and as a weapon in the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, it was, and in many cases still is, the basic utility knife of the [[Gurkha]]. It is a characteristic weapon of the [[Nepalese Army]], the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] of the [[British Army]], the [[Assam Rifles]], the [[Kumaon Regiment]], the [[The Garhwal Rifles|Garhwal Rifles]], the [[Gorkha regiments (India)|Gorkha regiments]] of the [[Indian Army]], and of all [[Gurkha]] regiments throughout the world, so much so that some English-speakers refer to the weapon as a \"Gurkha blade\" or \"Gurkha knife\". The kukri often appears in [[Nepalese people|Nepalese]] heraldry and is used in many traditional rites such as wedding ceremonies. \n\nA common myth is that a kukri must draw blood before sheathed; in fact they are frequently used as utility tools, extraordinary stories of their use in combat by the Gurkhas may contribute to this misconception<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vcgca.org/our-people/profile/19/rambahadur-limbu|title=The VC and GC Association|last=Association|first=Victoria Cross and George Cross|website=vcgca.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gurkhabde.com/the-kukri/|title=The Kukri|last=Latter|first=Mick|date=2013-03-26|website=Welcome to the Gurkha Brigade Association|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>.

Among the oldest existing kukri are those belonging to Drabya Shah (c. 1559), housed in the National Museum of Nepal in [[Kathmandu]].\n\nThe kukri came to be known to the Western world when the [[East India Company]] came into conflict with the growing [[Gorkha Kingdom]], culminating in the [[Gurkha War]] of 1814\u20131816.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} It gained literary attention in the 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]'' by Irish author [[Bram Stoker]]. Despite the popular image of Dracula having a stake driven through his heart at the conclusion of a climactic battle between Dracula's bodyguards and the heroes, Mina's narrative describes his throat being sliced through by Jonathan Harker's kukri and his heart pierced by Quincey Morris's [[Bowie knife]].<ref>Stoker, Dacre and Ian Holt (2009).

The weapon gained fame in the Gurkha War and its continued use through both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] enhanced its reputation among both Allied troops and enemy forces. Its acclaim was demonstrated in North Africa by one unit's situation report. It reads: \"Enemy losses: ten killed, our nil. Ammunition expenditure nil.\"<ref>Reagan, Geoffrey (1992).

The Karda and Chakmak are used as a utility knife and a sharpening tool respectively ]]\nThe kukri is designed primarily for chopping. The shape varies a great deal from being quite straight to highly curved with angled or smooth spines. There are substantial variations in dimensions and blade thickness depending on intended tasks as well as the region of origin and the smith that produced it. As a general guide the spines vary from {{cvt|5|-|10|mm|frac=16}} at the handle, and can taper to {{cvt|2|mm|frac=16}} by the point while the blade lengths can vary from {{cvt|26|-|38|cm}} for general use.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nA kukri designed for general purpose is commonly {{cvt|40|-|45|cm}} in overall length and weighs approximately {{cvt|450|-|900|g|lb|0}}. Larger examples are impractical for everyday use and are rarely found except in collections or as ceremonial weapons. Smaller ones are of more limited utility, but very easy to carry.\n\nAnother factor that affects its weight and balance is the construction of the blade. To reduce weight while keeping strength, the blade might be hollow forged, or a [[Fuller (weapon)|fuller]] is created. Kukris are made with several different types of fuller including ''tin Chira'' (triple fuller), ''Dui Chira'' (double fuller), ''Ang Khola'' (single fuller), or basic non-tapered spines with a large bevelled edge.\n\nKukri blades usually have a notch (''karda'', ''kauda'', ''Gaudi'', ''Kaura'', or ''Cho'') at the base of the blade. Various reasons are given for this, both practical and ceremonial: that it makes blood and sap drop off the blade rather than running onto the handle and thereby prevent the handle from becoming slippery;<ref>{{cite episode |title=Episode 3 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/i/p00jvf2t/ |accessdate=8 August 2013 |series=In the Highest Tradition |last=Wooldridge |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Wooldridge |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Two]] |airdate=20 November 1989 |time=13 minutes 25 seconds |quote=Here if I may describe, you see a little pattern there, which some people say that it has got some religious significance, but I doubt very much.

The notch may also represent the teats of a cow, a reminder that the kukri should not be used to kill a cow, an animal revered and worshipped by Hindus. {{citation needed|reason=Relief cut for differential tempered edge|date=July 2016}} The notch may also be used as a catch, to hold tight against a belt, or to bite onto twine to be suspended.{{original research inline|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe handles are most often made of [[hardwood]] or [[water buffalo]] horn, but [[ivory]], bone, and metal handles have also been produced. The handle quite often has a flared butt that allows better retention in draw cuts and chopping. Most handles have metal bolsters and butt plates which are generally made of [[brass]] or steel.\n\nThe traditional handle attachment in Nepal is the partial [[Tang (tools)|tang]], although the more modern versions have the stick tang which has become popular.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The full tang is mainly used on some military models but has not become widespread in Nepal itself.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe kukri typically comes in either a decorated wooden scabbard or one which is wrapped in leather. Traditionally, the scabbard also holds two smaller blades: an unsharpened ''checkmark'' to burnish the blade, and another accessory blade called a ''karda''. Some older style scabbards include a pouch for carrying flint or dry tinder.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Manufacture==\n[[File:Gurkha IOC 3.jpg|thumb|200px|A Gurkha officer of the [[Gurkha Contingent]], [[Singapore Police Force]] patrols around [[Raffles City Singapore|Raffles City]] during the [[117th IOC Session]]. He wears the distinctively tilted [[Hat Terrai Gurkha]], the kukri can be seen attached to the back of his belt]]\nThe Biswakarma [[Kami (caste)]] are the traditional inheritors of the art of kukri-making.<ref name=\"kami\">{{Cite web|url=https://himalayan-imports.com/kami.html|title=Kamis, Khukuri makers of Nepal|website=himalayan-imports.com|accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref> Modern kukri blades are often forged from [[spring steel]], sometimes collected from recycled [[Suspension (vehicle)|truck suspension units]].<ref name=\"kami\"/> The [[tang (tools)|tang]] of the blade usually extends all the way through to the end of the handle;{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} the small portion of the tang that projects through the end of the handle are hammered flat to secure the blade. Kukri blades have a hard, tempered edge and a softer spine. This enables them to maintain a sharp edge, yet tolerate impacts.\n\nKukri handles, usually made from hardwood or buffalo horn, are often fastened with a kind of tree sap called ''laha'' (also known as \"Himalayan epoxy\"). With a wood or horn handle, the tang may be heated and burned into the handle to ensure a tight fit, since only the section of handle which touches the blade is burned away. In more modern kukri, handles of cast [[aluminium]] or [[brass]] are press-fitted to the tang; as the hot metal cools it shrinks, locking onto the blade. Some kukri (such as the ones made by contractors for the modern Indian Army), have a very wide tang with handle slabs fastened on by two or more rivets, commonly called a [[full tang]] (''panawal'') configuration.\n\nTraditional profiling of the blade edge is performed by a two-man team; one spins a grinding wheel forwards and backwards by means of a rope wound several times around an axle while the sharpener applies the blade. The wheel is made by hand from fine river sand bound by ''laha'', the same adhesive used to affix the handle to the blade. Routine sharpening is traditionally accomplished by passing a ''chakmak'' over the edge in a manner similar to that used by chefs to [[sharpening steel|steel]] their knives.\n\nKukri scabbards are usually made of wood or metal with an animal skin or metal or wood covering. The leather work is often done by a ''[[Sirki|Sarki]]''.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:1-4th Gurkhas at kit inspection showing kukris (Photo 24-98).jpg|thumb|Gurkhas at kit inspection showing kukri in France during World War I]]\n[[File: Khukuri knife and scabbard.jpg|thumb|Kukri knife and scabbard on display at the [[Imperial War Museum North]]]]\n\n===Weaponry===\nThe kukri is effective as a chopping weapon, due to its weight, and slashing weapon, because the curved shape creates a \"wedge\" effect which causes the blade to cut effectively and deeper. Because the blade bends towards the opponent, the user need not angle the wrist while executing a chopping motion.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Unlike a straight-edged sword, the center of mass combined with the angle of the blade allow the kukri to slice as it chops.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The edge slides across the target's surface while the center of mass maintains momentum as the blade moves through the target's cross-section. This gives the kukri a penetrative force disproportional to its length. The design enables the user to inflict deep wounds and to penetrate bone.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Utility===\nWhile most famed from use in the military, the kukri is the most commonly used multipurpose tool in the fields and homes in Nepal. Its use has varied from building, clearing, chopping firewood, digging, slaughtering animals for food, cutting meat and vegetables, skinning animals, and opening cans. Its use as a general farm and household tool disproves the often stated \"taboo\" that the weapon cannot be sheathed \"until it has drawn blood\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gurkhabde.com/the-kukri/|title=The Kukri|last=Latter|first=Mick|date=2013-03-26|website=Welcome to the Gurkha Brigade Association|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>\n\nThe kukri is versatile. It can function as a smaller knife by using the narrower part of the blade, closest to the handle. The heavier and wider end of the blade, towards the tip, functions as an axe or a small shovel.\n\n==Anatomy==\n===Blade===\n* Keeper (''Hira Jornu''): Spade/Diamond shaped metal/brass plate used to seal the butt cap.\n* Butt Cap (''Chapri''): Thick metal/brass plate used to secure the handle to the tang.\n* Tang (''Paro''): Rear piece of the blade that goes through the handle.\n* Bolster (''Kanjo''): Thick metal/brass round shaped plate between blade and handle made to support and reinforce the fixture.\n* Spine (''Beet''): Thickest blunt edge of the blade.\n* Fuller/Groove (''Khol''): Straight groove or deep line that runs along part of the upper spine.\n* Peak (''Juro''): Highest point of the blade.\n* Main body (''Ang''): Main surface or panel of the blade.\n* Fuller (''Chirra''): Curvature/Hump in the blade made to absorb impact and to reduce unnecessary weight.\n* Tip (''Toppa''): the Starting point of the blade.\n* Edge (''Dhaar''): Sharp edge of the blade.\n* Belly (''Bhundi''): Widest part/area of the blade.\n* Bevel (''Patti''): Slope from the main body until the sharp edge.\n* Notch (''Cho''): A distinctive cut (numeric '3 '-like shape) in the edge.

The Eastern blades are originated and named according to the towns and villages of [[Eastern Nepal]].{{cn|date=March 2020}} The Eastern Khukuris are Angkhola Khukuri, Bhojpure Khukuri, Chainpure Khukuri, Cheetlange (Chitlange) Khukuri, Chirwa (Chiruwa) Khukuri, Dhankute Khukuri, Ganjawla Khukuri, Panawala Khukuri, Sirupate Khukuri translates as ''Siru'' grass leaf like.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.kukrimart.com | title=Kukri Mart - Handmade Genuine Gurkhas Knives and original Nepalese Khukuris}}</ref> Khukuris made in locations like [[Chainpur, Kosi|Chainpur]], [[Bhojpur, Nepal|Bhojpur]], and [[Dhankuta]] in Eastern Nepal are excellent and ornate knives.<ref>Visit Nepal '98: By The Official Travel Manual of Visit Nepal '98 VNY'98 Secretariat, 1998</ref>\nWestern blades are generally broader.

The knife has a distinct recurve in the blade. It is used as both a tool and as a weapon in the Indian subcontinent. Traditionally, it was, and in many cases still is, the basic utility knife of the [[Gurkha]]. It is a characteristic weapon of the [[Nepalese Army]], the [[Royal Gurkha Rifles]] of the [[British Army]], the [[Assam Rifles]], the [[Kumaon Regiment]], the [[The Garhwal Rifles|Garhwal Rifles]], the [[Gorkha regiments (India)|Gorkha regiments]] of the [[Indian Army]], and of all [[Gurkha]] regiments throughout the world, so much so that some English-speakers refer to the weapon as a \"Gurkha blade\" or \"Gurkha knife\". The kukri often appears in [[Nepalese people|Nepalese]] and [[Indian Gorkha]] heraldry and is used in many traditional rites such as wedding ceremonies. \n\nA common myth is that a kukri must draw blood before sheathed; in fact they are frequently used as utility tools, extraordinary stories of their use in combat by the Gurkhas may contribute to this misconception<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vcgca.org/our-people/profile/19/rambahadur-limbu|title=The VC and GC Association|last=Association|first=Victoria Cross and George Cross|website=vcgca.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gurkhabde.com/the-kukri/|title=The Kukri|last=Latter|first=Mick|date=2013-03-26|website=Welcome to the Gurkha Brigade Association|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>.

Among the oldest existing kukri are those belonging to Drabya Shah (c. 1559), housed in the National Museum of Nepal in [[Kathmandu]].\n\nThe kukri came to be known to the Western world when the [[East India Company]] came into conflict with the growing [[Gorkha Kingdom]], culminating in the [[Gurkha War]] of 1814\u20131816.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} It gained literary attention in the 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]'' by Irish author [[Bram Stoker]].

The weapon gained fame in the Gurkha War and its continued use through both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] enhanced its reputation among both Allied troops and enemy forces.

The Karda and Chakmak are used as a utility knife and a sharpening tool respectively ]]\nThe kukri is designed primarily for chopping. The shape varies a great deal from being quite straight to highly curved with angled or smooth spines. There are substantial variations in dimensions and blade thickness depending on intended tasks as well as the region of origin and the smith that produced it. As a general guide the spines vary from {{cvt|5|-|10|mm|frac=16}} at the handle, and can taper to {{cvt|2|mm|frac=16}} by the point while the blade lengths can vary from {{cvt|26|-|38|cm}} for general use.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nA kukri designed for general purpose is commonly {{cvt|40|-|45|cm}} in overall length and weighs approximately {{cvt|450|-|900|g|lb|0}}. Larger examples are impractical for everyday use and are rarely found except in collections or as ceremonial weapons. Smaller ones are of more limited utility, but very easy to carry.\n\nAnother factor that affects its weight and balance is the construction of the blade. To reduce weight while keeping strength, the blade might be hollow forged, or a [[Fuller (weapon)|fuller]] is created. Kukris are made with several different types of fuller including ''tin Chira'' (triple fuller), ''Dui Chira'' (double fuller), ''Ang Khola'' (single fuller), or basic non-tapered spines with a large bevelled edge.\n\nKukri blades usually have a notch (''karda'', ''kauda'', ''Gaudi'', ''Kaura'', or ''Cho'') at the base of the blade. Various reasons are given for this, both practical and ceremonial: that it makes blood and sap drop off the blade rather than running onto the handle and thereby prevent the handle from becoming slippery;<ref>{{cite episode |title=Episode 3 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/i/p00jvf2t/ |accessdate=8 August 2013 |series=In the Highest Tradition |last=Wooldridge |first=Ian |authorlink=Ian Wooldridge |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC Two]] |airdate=20 November 1989 |time=13 minutes 25 seconds |quote=Here if I may describe, you see a little pattern there, which some people say that it has got some religious significance, but I doubt very much.

The notch may also represent the teats of a cow, a reminder that the kukri should not be used to kill a cow, an animal revered and worshipped by Hindus. {{citation needed|reason=Relief cut for differential tempered edge|date=July 2016}} The notch may also be used as a catch, to hold tight against a belt, or to bite onto twine to be suspended.{{original research inline|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe handles are most often made of [[hardwood]] or [[water buffalo]] horn, but [[ivory]], bone, and metal handles have also been produced. The handle quite often has a flared butt that allows better retention in draw cuts and chopping. Most handles have metal bolsters and butt plates which are generally made of [[brass]] or steel.\n\nThe traditional handle attachment in Nepal is the partial [[Tang (tools)|tang]], although the more modern versions have the stick tang which has become popular.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} The full tang is mainly used on some military models but has not become widespread in Nepal itself.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nThe kukri typically comes in either a decorated wooden scabbard or one which is wrapped in leather. Traditionally, the scabbard also holds two smaller blades: an unsharpened ''checkmark'' to burnish the blade, and another accessory blade called a ''karda''. Some older style scabbards include a pouch for carrying flint or dry tinder.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Manufacture==\n[[File:Gurkha IOC 3.jpg|thumb|200px|A Gurkha officer of the [[Gurkha Contingent]], [[Singapore Police Force]] patrols around [[Raffles City Singapore|Raffles City]] during the [[117th IOC Session]].

Kukri blades have a hard, tempered edge and a softer spine. This enables them to maintain a sharp edge, yet tolerate impacts.\n\nKukri handles, usually made from hardwood or buffalo horn, are often fastened with a kind of tree sap called ''laha'' (also known as \"Himalayan epoxy\"). With a wood or horn handle, the tang may be heated and burned into the handle to ensure a tight fit, since only the section of handle which touches the blade is burned away. In more modern kukri, handles of cast [[aluminium]] or [[brass]] are press-fitted to the tang; as the hot metal cools it shrinks, locking onto the blade. Some kukri (such as the ones made by contractors for the modern Indian Army), have a very wide tang with handle slabs fastened on by two or more rivets, commonly called a [[full tang]] (''panawal'') configuration.\n\nTraditional profiling of the blade edge is performed by a two-man team; one spins a grinding wheel forwards and backwards by means of a rope wound several times around an axle while the sharpener applies the blade. The wheel is made by hand from fine river sand bound by ''laha'', the same adhesive used to affix the handle to the blade. Routine sharpening is traditionally accomplished by passing a ''chakmak'' over the edge in a manner similar to that used by chefs to [[sharpening steel|steel]] their knives.\n\nKukri scabbards are usually made of wood or metal with an animal skin or metal or wood covering. The leather work is often done by a ''[[Sirki|Sarki]]''.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:1-4th Gurkhas at kit inspection showing kukris (Photo 24-98).jpg|thumb|Gurkhas at kit inspection showing kukri in France during World War I]]\n[[File: Khukuri knife and scabbard.jpg|thumb|Kukri knife and scabbard on display at the [[Imperial War Museum North]]]]\n\n===Weaponry===\nThe kukri is effective as a chopping weapon, due to its weight, and slashing weapon, because the curved shape creates a \"wedge\" effect which causes the blade to cut effectively and deeper. Because the blade bends towards the opponent, the user need not angle the wrist while executing a chopping motion.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Unlike a straight-edged sword, the center of mass combined with the angle of the blade allow the kukri to slice as it chops.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} The edge slides across the target's surface while the center of mass maintains momentum as the blade moves through the target's cross-section. This gives the kukri a penetrative force disproportional to its length. The design enables the user to inflict deep wounds and to penetrate bone.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Utility===\nWhile most famed from use in the military, the kukri is the most commonly used multipurpose tool in the fields and homes in Nepal. Its use has varied from building, clearing, chopping firewood, digging, slaughtering animals for food, cutting meat and vegetables, skinning animals, and opening cans. Its use as a general farm and household tool disproves the often stated \"taboo\" that the weapon cannot be sheathed \"until it has drawn blood\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gurkhabde.com/the-kukri/|title=The Kukri|last=Latter|first=Mick|date=2013-03-26|website=Welcome to the Gurkha Brigade Association|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-03-25}}</ref>\n\nThe kukri is versatile. It can function as a smaller knife by using the narrower part of the blade, closest to the handle. The heavier and wider end of the blade, towards the tip, functions as an axe or a small shovel.\n\n==Anatomy==\n===Blade===\n* Keeper (''Hira Jornu''): Spade/Diamond shaped metal/brass plate used to seal the butt cap.\n* Butt Cap (''Chapri''): Thick metal/brass plate used to secure the handle to the tang.\n* Tang (''Paro''): Rear piece of the blade that goes through the handle.\n* Bolster (''Kanjo''): Thick metal/brass round shaped plate between blade and handle made to support and reinforce the fixture.\n* Spine (''Beet''): Thickest blunt edge of the blade.\n* Fuller/Groove (''Khol''): Straight groove or deep line that runs along part of the upper spine.\n* Peak (''Juro''): Highest point of the blade.\n* Main body (''Ang''): Main surface or panel of the blade.\n* Fuller (''Chirra''): Curvature/Hump in the blade made to absorb impact and to reduce unnecessary weight.\n* Tip (''Toppa''): the Starting point of the blade.\n* Edge (''Dhaar''): Sharp edge of the blade.\n* Belly (''Bhundi''): Widest part/area of the blade.\n* Bevel (''Patti''): Slope from the main body until the sharp edge.\n* Notch (''Cho''): A distinctive cut (numeric '3 '-like shape) in the edge.

She leaves her child with a [[mongoose]] friend. When she returns, she sees blood on the mongoose's mouth, and kills the friend, believing the animal killed her child. The woman discovers her child alive, and learns that the blood on the mongoose mouth came from it biting the snake while defending her child from the snake's attack. She regrets having killed the friend because of her hasty action.\n\n==Links with other fables==\nThe fables of ''Panchatantra'' are found in numerous world languages.

Indian painting, 1610.]]\n\nIn the Indian tradition, ''The Panchatantra'' is a {{IAST|n\u012bti\u015b\u0101stra}}. ''N\u012bti'' can be roughly translated as \"the wise conduct of life\"<ref name=niti/> and a ''\u015b\u0101stra'' is a technical or scientific treatise; thus it is considered a treatise on political science and human conduct. Its literary sources are \"the expert tradition of political science and the folk and literary traditions of storytelling\". It draws from the [[Dharma]] [[Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha|and]] [[Artha]] ''\u015b\u0101stra''s, quoting them extensively.<ref name=olivelle18/> It is also explained that ''n\u012bti'' \"represents an admirable attempt to answer the insistent question how to win the utmost possible joy from life in the world of men\" and that ''n\u012bti'' is \"the harmonious development of the powers of man, a life in which security, prosperity, resolute action, friendship, and good learning are so combined to produce joy\".<ref name=niti/>\n\n''The Panchatantra'' shares many stories in common with the Buddhist [[Jataka tales]], purportedly told by the historical [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] before his death around 400 BCE. As the scholar Patrick Olivelle writes, \"It is clear that the Buddhists did not invent the stories. [...] It is quite uncertain whether the author of [the Panchatantra] borrowed his stories from the ''J\u0101taka''s or the ''Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata'', or whether he was tapping into a common treasury of tales, both oral and literary, of ancient India.\"<ref name=olivelle18/> Many scholars believe the tales were based on earlier oral folk traditions, which were finally written down, although there is no conclusive evidence.<ref>Bedekar: \"Its probable relation to early folk and oral tradition of storytelling in India has been suggested by many. Rather, it is fashionable to make such statements that 'Panchatantra' and allied Katha literature in India had their origin in early folk stories. However, not a single credible evidence has been produced till this date, other than lengthy discussions on hypothetical assumptions.\"</ref> In the early 20th century, [[W. Norman Brown]] found that many folk tales in India appeared to be borrowed from literary sources and not vice versa.<ref>[[W. Norman Brown|Brown, Norman W.]] 1919. \"'The Panchatantra' in Modern Indian Folklore\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society,'' Vol 39, pp 1 &17: \"It is doubtless true that in the remote past many stories had their origin among the illiterate folk, often in pre-literary times, and were later taken into literature. It is also just as true that many stories that appear in literature existed there first and are not indebted to the folklore for their origin. But leaving aside questions concerning the early history of Hindu stories and dealing strictly with modern Indian fiction, we find that folklore has frequently taken its material from literature. This process has been so extensive that of the 3000 tales so far reported, all of which have been collected during the past fifty years, at least half can be shown to be derived from literary sources. [...] This table affords considerable evidence in support of the theory that it is the folk tales and not the literary tales that are borrowed.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nalanda Temple 2 ei7-42.jpg|thumb|left|Panchtantra illustration in Nalanda Temple, 7th century CE (Turtle and the Geese)]]\nAn early Western scholar who studied ''The Panchatantra'' was Dr. [[Johannes Hertel]], who thought the book had a [[Machiavelli|Machiavellian]] character.

They glorify shrewdness and practical wisdom, in the affairs of life, and especially of politics, of government.\"<ref name=e1965/> Other scholars dismiss this assessment as one-sided, and view the stories as teaching {{IAST|dharma}}, or proper moral conduct.<ref>{{citation | last=Falk|first=H. | title=Quellen des Pa\u00f1catantra | year=1978 | pages=173\u2013188}}</ref> Also:<ref>{{citation | year=1996 | title = Comparative ethics in Hindu and Buddhist traditions | author1=Roderick Hindery | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | isbn=978-81-208-0866-9 | page=166 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-FswBLvTkvQC&pg=PA166&dq=roguery}}</ref>\n{{quote|On the surface, the Pa\u00f1catantra presents stories and sayings which favor the outwitting of roguery, and practical intelligence rather than virtue.

It is not quite so strange, however, when one recalls that the Arabs had much preferred the poetic art and were at first suspicious of and untrained to appreciate, let alone imitate, current higher forms of prose literature in the lands they occupied.\n\nLeaving aside the great skill of its translation (which was to serve as the basis for later translations into some forty languages), the work itself is far from primitive, having benefited already at that time 750 CE from a lengthy history of stylistic revision. ''Kalilah and Dimnah'' is in fact the patriarchal form of the Indic fable in which animals behave as humans&nbsp;\u2014 as distinct from the Aesopic fable in which they behave as animals. Its philosophical heroes through the ''initial'' interconnected episodes ''illustrating The Loss of Friends, the first Hindu principle of polity'' are the two jackals, Kalilah and Dimnah.\n\nIt seems unjust, in the light of posterity's appreciation of his work, that Ibn al-Muqaffa was put to death after charges of heresy about 755 CE.}} See also pages 69 \u2013 72 for his vivid summary of Ibn al-Muqaffa's historical context.\n</ref> and \"is considered the first masterpiece of [[Arabic literature|Arabic literary prose]].\"<ref name=\"mitejmes\" /><!-- In the ''The Golden Age of Persia'', [[Richard Nelson Frye]] ascribes significant Arabic literary developments to al-Muqaffa -->\n\nSome scholars believe that Ibn al-Muqaffa's translation of the second section, illustrating the Sanskrit principle of ''Mitra Laabha'' (Gaining Friends), became the unifying basis for the [[Brethren of Purity]] (''Ikwhan al-Safa'')&nbsp;\u2014 the anonymous 9th-century CE encyclopedists whose prodigious literary effort, ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Sincerity]]'', codified Indian, Persian and Greek knowledge. A suggestion made by Goldziher, and later written on by [[Philip K. Hitti]] in his ''[[History of the Arabs (book)|History of the Arabs]]'', proposes that \"The appellation is presumably taken from the story of the ringdove in ''Kalilah wa-Dimnah'' in which it is related that a group of animals by acting as faithful friends (''ikhwan al-safa'') to one another escaped the snares of the hunter.\" This story is mentioned as an [[exemplum]] when the Brethren speak of mutual aid in one ''risaala'' ([[treatise]]), a crucial part of their system of ethics.\n\n[[File:Jacobs-0073-lxiii.png|thumb|right|The bird lures fish and kills them, until he tries the same trick with a lobster.

From Arabic it was re-translated into Syriac in the 10th or 11th century, into [[Greek language|Greek]] (as ''Stephanites and Ichnelates'') in 1080 by the Jewish Byzantine doctor [[Simeon Seth]],<ref>L.-O.

This Hebrew version was translated into [[Latin]] by [[John of Capua]] as  ''Directorium Humanae Vitae'', or \"Directory of Human Life\", and printed in 1480, and became the source of most European versions.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Bidpai, Fables of|volume=3}}</ref>\nA German translation, ''Das Buch der Beispiele'', of the Panchatantra was printed in 1483, making this one of the earliest books to be printed by [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s press after the Bible.<ref name=thane>Vijay Bedekar, [http://www.orientalthane.com/speeches/speech2008.htm History of the Migration of ''Panchatantra''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820052550/http://www.orientalthane.com/speeches/speech2008.htm |date=20 August 2012 }}, Institute for Oriental Study, Thane</ref>\n\nThe Latin version was translated into Italian by [[:it:Anton Francesco Doni|Antonfrancesco Doni]] in 1552.

Indian painting, 1610.]]\n\nIn the Indian tradition, ''The Panchatantra'' is a {{IAST|n\u012bti\u015b\u0101stra}}. ''N\u012bti'' can be roughly translated as \"the wise conduct of life\"<ref name=niti/> and a ''\u015b\u0101stra'' is a technical or scientific treatise; thus it is considered a treatise on political science and human conduct. Its literary sources are \"the expert tradition of political science and the folk and literary traditions of storytelling\". It draws from the [[Dharma]] [[Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha|and]] [[Artha]] ''\u015b\u0101stra''s, quoting them extensively.<ref name=olivelle18/> It is also explained that ''n\u012bti'' \"represents an admirable attempt to answer the insistent question how to win the utmost possible joy from life in the world of men\" and that ''n\u012bti'' is \"the harmonious development of the powers of man, a life in which security, prosperity, resolute action, friendship, and good learning are so combined to produce joy\".<ref name=niti/>\n\n''The Panchatantra'' shares many stories in common with the Buddhist [[Jataka tales]], purportedly told by the historical [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] before his death around 400 BCE. As the scholar Patrick Olivelle writes, \"It is clear that the Buddhists did not invent the stories. [...] It is quite uncertain whether the author of [the Panchatantra] borrowed his stories from the ''J\u0101taka''s or the ''Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata'', or whether he was tapping into a common treasury of tales, both oral and literary, of ancient India.\"<ref name=olivelle18/> Many scholars believe the tales were based on earlier oral folk traditions, which were finally written down, although there is no conclusive evidence.<ref>Bedekar: \"Its probable relation to early folk and oral tradition of storytelling in India has been suggested by many. Rather, it is fashionable to make such statements that 'Panchatantra' and allied Katha literature in India had their origin in early folk stories. However, not a single credible evidence has been produced till this date, other than lengthy discussions on hypothetical assumptions.\"</ref> In the early 20th century, [[W. Norman Brown]] found that many folk tales in India appeared to be borrowed from literary sources and not vice versa.<ref>[[W. Norman Brown|Brown, Norman W.]] 1919. \"'The Panchatantra' in Modern Indian Folklore\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society,'' Vol 39, pp 1 &17: \"It is doubtless true that in the remote past many stories had their origin among the illiterate folk, often in pre-literary times, and were later taken into literature. It is also just as true that many stories that appear in literature existed there first and are not indebted to the folklore for their origin. But leaving aside questions concerning the early history of Hindu stories and dealing strictly with modern Indian fiction, we find that folklore has frequently taken its material from literature. This process has been so extensive that of the 3000 tales so far reported, all of which have been collected during the past fifty years, at least half can be shown to be derived from literary sources. [...] This table affords considerable evidence in support of the theory that it is the folk tales and not the literary tales that are borrowed.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nalanda Temple 2 ei7-42.jpg|thumb|left|Panchtantra illustration in Nalanda Temple, 7th century CE (Turtle and the Geese)]]\nAn early Western scholar who studied ''The Panchatantra'' was Dr. [[Johannes Hertel]], who thought the book had a [[Machiavelli|Machiavellian]] character.

It is not quite so strange, however, when one recalls that the Arabs had much preferred the poetic art and were at first suspicious of and untrained to appreciate, let alone imitate, current higher forms of prose literature in the lands they occupied.\n\nLeaving aside the great skill of its translation (which was to serve as the basis for later translations into some forty languages), the work itself is far from primitive, having benefited already at that time 750 CE from a lengthy history of stylistic revision. ''Kalilah and Dimnah'' is in fact the patriarchal form of the Indic fable in which animals behave as humans&nbsp;\u2014 as distinct from the Aesopic fable in which they behave as animals. Its philosophical heroes through the ''initial'' interconnected episodes ''illustrating The Loss of Friends, the first Hindu principle of polity'' are the two jackals, Kalilah and Dimnah.\n\nIt seems unjust, in the light of posterity's appreciation of his work, that Ibn al-Muqaffa was put to death after charges of heresy about 755 CE.}} See also pages 69 \u2013 72 for his vivid summary of Ibn al-Muqaffa's historical context.\n</ref> and \"is considered the first masterpiece of [[Arabic literature|Arabic literary prose]].\"<ref name=\"mitejmes\" /><!-- In the ''The Golden Age of Persia'', [[Richard Nelson Frye]] ascribes significant Arabic literary developments to al-Muqaffa -->\n\nSome scholars believe that Ibn al-Muqaffa's translation of the second section, illustrating the Sanskrit principle of ''Mitra Laabha'' (Gaining Friends), became the unifying basis for the [[Brethren of Purity]] (''Ikwhan al-Safa'')&nbsp;\u2014 the anonymous 9th-century CE encyclopedists whose prodigious literary effort, ''[[Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Sincerity]]'', codified Indian, Persian and Greek knowledge. A suggestion made by Goldziher, and later written on by [[Philip K. Hitti]] in his ''[[History of the Arabs (book)|History of the Arabs]]'', proposes that \"The appellation is presumably taken from the story of the ringdove in ''Kalilah wa-Dimnah'' in which it is related that a group of animals by acting as faithful friends (''ikhwan al-safa'') to one another escaped the snares of the hunter.\" This story is mentioned as an [[exemplum]] when the Brethren speak of mutual aid in one ''risaala'' ([[treatise]]), a crucial part of their system of ethics.\n\n[[File:Jacobs-0073-lxiii.png|thumb|right|The bird lures fish and kills them, until he tries the same trick with a lobster. Illustration from the ''[[editio princeps]]'' of the [[Latin]] version by [[John of Capua]].]]\n\n===Spread to the rest of Europe===\nAlmost all pre-modern European translations of the Panchatantra arise from this Arabic version. From Arabic it was re-translated into Syriac in the 10th or 11th century, into [[Greek language|Greek]] (as ''Stephanites and Ichnelates'') in 1080 by the Jewish Byzantine doctor [[Simeon Seth]],<ref>L.-O. Sj\u00f6berg, ''Stephanites und Ichnelates: \u00dcberlieferungsgeschichte und Text'' (Uppsala, 1962).</ref> into 'modern' Persian by Abu'l Ma'ali Nasr Allah Munshi in 1121, and in 1252 into Spanish (old Castilian, ''[[Calila e Dimna]]'').\n\nPerhaps most importantly, it was translated into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] by Rabbi Joel in the 12th century. This Hebrew version was translated into [[Latin]] by [[John of Capua]] as  ''Directorium Humanae Vitae'', or \"Directory of Human Life\", and printed in 1480, and became the source of most European versions.<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Bidpai, Fables of|volume=3}}</ref>\nA German translation, ''Das Buch der Beispiele'', of the Panchatantra was printed in 1483, making this one of the earliest books to be printed by [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]'s press after the Bible.<ref name=thane>Vijay Bedekar, [http://www.orientalthane.com/speeches/speech2008.htm History of the Migration of ''Panchatantra''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820052550/http://www.orientalthane.com/speeches/speech2008.htm |date=20 August 2012 }}, Institute for Oriental Study, Thane</ref>\n\nThe Latin version was translated into Italian by [[:it:Anton Francesco Doni|Antonfrancesco Doni]] in 1552.

Edgerton undertook a minute study of all texts which seemed \"to provide useful evidence on the lost Sanskrit text to which, it must be assumed, they all go back\", and believed he had reconstructed the original Sanskrit Panchatantra; this version is known as the Southern Family text.\n\nAmong modern translations, [[Arthur W.

The Cultural Capital status was expected to bring about an abrupt increase in quantity and quality of cultural events in 2007.\n\n==Tourism==\nIn 2007, Sibiu was the [[European Capital of Culture]] (together with [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]). This was the most important cultural event that has ever happened in the city, and a great number of tourists came, both domestic and foreign.\n\nThe city of Sibiu and its surroundings are one of the most visited areas in Romania. It holds one of the best preserved historical sites in the country, many of its medieval fortifications having been kept in excellent state. Its old center has begun the process for becoming a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2004. Sibiu and its surrounding area have many significant museums, with 12 institutions housing art collections, paintings, and exhibits in decorative arts, archeology, anthropology, history, industrial archeology and history of technology and natural sciences.\n\nThe city also lies close to the [[F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 Mountains]] \u2013 a popular trekking destination, close to the [[P\u0103ltini\u0219]] and Arena Platos ski resorts \u2013 both winter holiday destinations, and it is at the heart of the former Saxon communities in Transylvania renowned for its [[Villages with fortified churches in Transylvania|fortified churches]].[[File:Sibiu Biserica evanghelica Gusterita (5).JPG|thumb|Fortified Lutheran church of Gu\u0219teri\u021ba neighbourhood, 13th century]]\n\nSince 2007, a traditional [[Christmas market]] has been held in Sibiu.

The old city of Sibiu lies on the right bank of the Cibin River, on a hill situated at about 200 m from the river. It consists of two distinct entities: the ''Upper Town'' and the ''Lower Town''. Traditionally, the Upper Town was the wealthier part and commercial outlet, while the Lower Town served as the manufacturing area.\n\n'''The Lower Town'''\n\n(German: ''Unterstadt'', Romanian: ''Ora\u0219ul de jos'') comprises the area between the river and the hill, and it developed around the earliest fortifications. The streets are long and quite wide for medieval city standards, with small city squares at places. The architecture is rather rustic: typically two-storey houses with tall roofs and gates opening passages to inner courts.\n\nMost of the exterior fortifications were lost to industrial development and modern urban planning in the mid-late 19th century; only four towers still exist. A building associated with newer urbanism of the period is the ''Independen\u021ba'' Highschool.\n\nThis area has the oldest church in the city \u2013 in fact the first mention of the city itself is the reconfirmation of the local provostship as ''praepositum Cibiniensem'' \u2013 that was the religious center of the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxons]] until the 15th century.<ref>Magyar katolikus lexikon XII.

As the main area for [[Bourgeoisie|burgher]] activities, the area contains most points of interest in the city.\n\n'''Grand Square'''\n\n(German: ''Gro\u00dfer Ring'', Romanian: ''Pia\u021ba Mare'' ) is, as its name suggests, the [[List of town squares by size|largest square]] of the city, and has been the center of the city since the 15th century. At 142 meters long and 93 meters wide, it is one of the largest ones in Transylvania.\n\n[[Brukenthal Palace]], one of the most important [[Baroque]] monuments in Romania, lies on the north-western corner of the square. It was erected between 1777 and 1787 as the main residence for the Governor of Transylvania [[Samuel von Brukenthal]]. It houses the main part of the ''National Brukenthal Museum'', opened in 1817, making it one of the oldest museums in the world. Next to the palace is the ''Blue House'' or ''Moringer House'', an 18th-century Baroque house bearing the old coat of arms of Sibiu on its fa\u00e7ade.\n\n[[File:Sibiu (15257629580).jpg|213x213px|thumb|Sibiu City Hall]]\n\nOn the north side is the [[Jesuit Church, Sibiu|Jesuit Church]], along with its dependencies, the former residence of the Jesuits in Sibiu. Also on the north side, at the beginning of the 20th century an ''[[Art Nouveau]]'' building was constructed on the west part, now it houses the mayor's office.\n\n[[File:Podul mincinosilor.jpg|thumb|212x212px|Liars Bridge in Lesser Square, erected in 1859]]\n\nNext to the Jesuit Church on the north side is the [[Council Tower of Sibiu|Council Tower]], the city's symbol. This former fortification tower from the 13th century has been successively rebuilt over the years. The building nearby used to be the City Council's meeting place; beneath it lies an access way between the ''Grand Square'' and the ''Lesser Square''.\n\nOn the south and east sides are two- or three-storey houses, having tall attics with small windows known as the ''city's eyes''. Most of these houses are dated 15th to 19th centuries, and most of them are Renaissance or Baroque in style.\n\n'''Lesser Square'''\n(''Small Square'', German: ''Kleiner Ring'') as its name implies, is a smaller square situated in the northern part of the Upper Town. After the 2007 rehabilitation there has been an increase in the number of small businesses such as pubs and restaurants in this area.\n\nThe square is connected to the other two squares and to other streets by small, narrow passages. The main access from the Lower City is through Ocnei Street, which divides the square in two. The street passes under the ''Liar's Bridge'' \u2013 the first bridge in Romania to have been cast in iron (1859).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://welcometoromania.ro/Sibiu/Sibiu_Podul_Mincinosilor_e.htm|title=The Bridge of Lies, Sibiu\u00b7|last=WR|website=welcometoromania.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104171643/http://welcometoromania.ro/Sibiu/Sibiu_Podul_Mincinosilor_e.htm|archivedate=4 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nTo the right of the bridge is another symbol of the city, ''The House of the Arts'', a 14th-century arched building formerly belonging to the Butchers' Guild. On the left side of the bridge is the ''Luxemburg House'', a Baroque four-storey building.\n\n'''Huet Square'''\nis the third of the three main squares of Sibiu. Its most notable feature is the [[Sibiu Lutheran Cathedral|Evangelical Lutheran Cathedral]] in its center. It is the place where the earliest fortifications have been built in the late 12th century or early 13th century. The buildings around this square are mainly [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]. On the west side lies the Brukenthal Highschool, in place of a former 14th-century school.\n\n[[File:Sibio, la Dika Turo de oriento, 4.jpeg|thumb|215x215px|right|[[Thalia Hall|The Thick Tower]]]]\n\n'''The Fortifications'''\nof Sibiu made the city one of the most important fortified cities in Central Europe. Multiple rings were built around the city, most of them out of clay bricks. The south-eastern fortifications are the best kept, and all three parallel lines are still visible. The first is an exterior earth mound, the second is a 10-meter-tall red brick wall, and the third line comprises towers linked by another 10-meter-tall wall. All structures are connected via a labyrinth of tunnels and passageways, designed to ensure transport between the city and lines of defense.\n\nIn the 16th century more modern elements were added to the fortifications, mainly leaf-shaped [[bastion]]s. Two of these survived to this day, as the ''Haller Bastion'' (all the way down Coposu Boulevard) and \"Soldisch Bastion\".\n\n'''The Passage of the Stairs''',\nleads down to the lower section of Sibiu. It descends along some fortifications under the support arches. It is one of several passages linking the two sides of the old city.\n\n==Health==\n[[File:Spitalul Judetean Sibiu.jpg|thumb|Sibiu County Hospital]]\nSibiu is one of the important medical centers of Romania, housing many important medical facilities:\n* County Hospital\n* Academic Emergency Hospital;\n* Hospital of Pediatrics;\n* Military Emergency Hospital;\n* CFR Hospital (Romanian Railways Hospital);\n* \"Dr. Gheorghe Preda\" Psychiatry Hospital\n* other smaller private clinics\n\nThe city also houses one of the largest private hospitals in the country, Polisano.\n\n==Education==\n\n[[File:Liceul Samuel von Brukenthal.jpg|thumb|Samuel von Brukenthal High School]]\n\nSibiu is an important centre of higher education, with over 23,000 students in four public and private higher institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ulbsibiu.ro/en/despre_ulbs/|title=:: L B U S :: About LBUS|first=Departamentul de Comunica\u0163ii \u0219i Marketing al|last=ULBS|website=www.ulbsibiu.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404104637/http://www.ulbsibiu.ro/en/despre_ulbs/|archivedate=4 April 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.mediafax.ro/social/reportaj-sefa-de-promotie-la-academia-fortelor-terestre-a-fost-o-lupta-intre-a-rezista-si-a-avea-vointa-foto-12957248 Land Forces Military Academy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130124204/http://www.mediafax.ro/social/reportaj-sefa-de-promotie-la-academia-fortelor-terestre-a-fost-o-lupta-intre-a-rezista-si-a-avea-vointa-foto-12957248 |date=2015-01-30 }} at mediafax.ro</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roger-univ.ro/universitate/prezentare-urgs.html|title=Universitatea Romano-Germana din Sibiu|website=www.roger-univ.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219173051/http://www.roger-univ.ro/universitate/prezentare-urgs.html|archivedate=19 February 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uamsibiu.ro/universitate/istoric/|title=Istoricul Universitatii Alma Mater Sibiu \u2013 Universitatea Alma Mater Sibiu|website=www.uamsibiu.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504160830/http://www.uamsibiu.ro/universitate/istoric/|archivedate=4 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Lucian Blaga University of Sibiu]] was founded in 1990, with five faculties: Engineering and Sciences; Language Sciences; History and Law; Medicine; Food and Textile Processing Technology.

The first Romanian-owned bank had its headquarters here (The ''Albina'' Bank), as did the [[Asocia\u021bia Transilvan\u0103 pentru Literatura Rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u0219i Cultura Poporului Rom\u00e2n|ASTRA]] (Transylvanian Association for Romanian Literature and Romanian's People Culture). After the [[Romanian Orthodox]] Church was granted status in the [[Austrian Empire]] from the 1860s onwards, Sibiu became the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan seat]], and the city is still regarded as the third-most important centre of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]. Between the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]] and 1867 (the year of the ''[[Ausgleich]]''), Sibiu was the meeting-place of the [[Transylvanian Diet]], which had taken its most representative form after the Empire agreed to extend voting rights in the region.\n\nAfter [[World War I]], when [[Austria-Hungary]] was dissolved, Sibiu became part of Romania; the majority of its population was still ethnic German (until 1941) and counted a large Romanian community, as well as a smaller Hungarian one. Starting from the 1950s and until after 1990, most of the city's ethnic Germans emigrated to [[Germany]] and [[Austria]]. Among the roughly 2,000 who have remained is [[Klaus Iohannis|Klaus Johannis]], the {{As of|2014|alt=current}} [[President of Romania]].\n\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nFile:Sibiu_Centru_vedere_panoramica.jpg|Panoramic view of Sibiu from 1928\nFile:Sibiu vedere de pe Deaulul Gusteritei.jpg|View from Gu\u0219teri\u021ba hill\nFile:Johann B\u00f6bel - Poarta Burger-Ocnei, la 1857.jpg|Burger-Ocnei gate\nFile:Johann Bobel - Turnul Portii Cisnadiei.jpg|Cisn\u0103die's Gate Tower\nFile:Johann B\u00f6bel - Strada Turnului \u015fi biserica Evanghelic\u0103.jpg|Tower's Street and the Evangelical Lutheran Church\nFile:Hermanstatt (Sibiu), 17th century engraving.jpg|Copper engraving of Sibiu (''Hermanstatt''), {{circa}} 1630.\nFile:Lanzedelli - T\u00e2rg \u00een Transilvania 4.jpg|A busy market scene in Sibiu, 1818\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\n\n[[File:Sibiu region.png|thumb|Topographic map of the Sibiu region]]\n\n[[File:Sibiu-pictures-001.jpg|alt=|thumb|]]\n\nSibiu is situated near the geographical center of Romania at {{Coord|45.792784|N|24.152069|E|region:RO_type:city}}. Set in the Cibin Depression, the city is about 20&nbsp;km from the [[F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 Mountains]], 12&nbsp;km from the [[Cibin Mountains]], and about 15&nbsp;km from the [[Lotru Mountains]], which border the depression in its southwestern section. The northern and eastern limits of Sibiu are formed by the T\u00e2rnavelor Plateau, which descends to the Cibin Valley through Gu\u0219teri\u021bei Hill.\n \nThe Cibin river as well as some smaller streams runs through Sibiu. The geographical position of Sibiu makes it one of the most important transportation hubs in Romania with important roads and railway lines passing through it.\n\n===City districts===\nThe following districts are part of Sibiu. Some were villages annexed by the city but most were built as the city developed and increased its surface.\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*Historic Center \u2013 Divided into the Upper Town and Lower Town\n*Centru (Centre)\n*Lupeni\n*[[Trei Stejari]]\n*[[Vasile Aron (Sibiu district)|Vasile Aaron]]\n*[[Hipodrom (Sibiu district)|Hipodrom I, II, III, IV]]\n*[[Valea Aurie]] (Golden Valley)\n*Tili\u0219ca\n*[[\u0218trand]]\n*[[Turni\u0219or]] (Little Tower; {{lang-de|Neppendorf}})\n*Pia\u021ba Cluj\n*[[\u021aiglari]]\n*[[Terezian (Sibiu district)|Terezian]]\n*Re\u0219i\u021ba\n*[[Lazaret (Sibiu district)|Lazaret]]\n*[[Gu\u0219teri\u021ba]] ({{lang-de|Hammersdorf}})\n*[[Brosc\u0103rie]]\n*Viile Sibiului\n*Tineretului\n*Veteranilor de R\u0103zboi\n{{Div col end}}\n\nThe Southern part, including the [[ASTRA National Museum Complex]] and the Zoo, also falls within the city limits.\n\n== Climate ==\nSibiu's climate is [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] with average temperatures of {{convert|8|to|9|C|F}}.

Also, here you can find the Zoological Garden and Ethnography Museum.\n\nThere is a [[Sibiu Steam Locomotives Museum|Steam Locomotives Museum]] close to the railway station, sheltering around 40 [[steam locomotive|locomotives]], two of which are functional.\n\nThe first park in the city was The Promenade, later called \"The Disabled Promenade.\" established in 1791, today part of Parcul Cet\u0103\u021bii (Citadel Park). Current arrangement of the park, including the space between the walls, dates from 1928.\n\nThe Sub Arini Park, established between 1857 and 1859 based on plans of military engineer Michael Seyfried,<ref>[https://www.siebenbuerger.de/zeitung/artikel/kultur/14902-eine-graefin-mit-herz.html]</ref> is one of the biggest and best-maintained parks in Romania.

The Cultural Capital status was expected to bring about an abrupt increase in quantity and quality of cultural events in 2007.\n\n==Tourism==\nIn 2007, Sibiu was the [[European Capital of Culture]] (together with [[Luxembourg (city)|Luxembourg]]). This was the most important cultural event that has ever happened in the city, and a great number of tourists came, both domestic and foreign.\n\nThe city of Sibiu and its surroundings are one of the most visited areas in Romania. It holds one of the best preserved historical sites in the country, many of its medieval fortifications having been kept in excellent state. Its old center has begun the process for becoming a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2004. Sibiu and its surrounding area have many significant museums, with 12 institutions housing art collections, paintings, and exhibits in decorative arts, archeology, anthropology, history, industrial archeology and history of technology and natural sciences.\n\nThe city also lies close to the [[F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 Mountains]] \u2013 a popular trekking destination, close to the [[P\u0103ltini\u0219]] and Arena Platos ski resorts \u2013 both winter holiday destinations, and it is at the heart of the former Saxon communities in Transylvania renowned for its [[Villages with fortified churches in Transylvania|fortified churches]].[[File:Sibiu Biserica evanghelica Gusterita (5).JPG|thumb|Fortified Lutheran church of Gu\u0219teri\u021ba neighbourhood, 13th century]]\n\nSince 2007, a traditional [[Christmas market]] has been held in Sibiu.

The old city of Sibiu lies on the right bank of the Cibin River, on a hill situated at about 200 m from the river. It consists of two distinct entities: the ''Upper Town'' and the ''Lower Town''. Traditionally, the Upper Town was the wealthier part and commercial outlet, while the Lower Town served as the manufacturing area.\n\n'''The Lower Town'''\n\n(German: ''Unterstadt'', Romanian: ''Ora\u0219ul de jos'') comprises the area between the river and the hill, and it developed around the earliest fortifications. The streets are long and quite wide for medieval city standards, with small city squares at places. The architecture is rather rustic: typically two-storey houses with tall roofs and gates opening passages to inner courts.\n\nMost of the exterior fortifications were lost to industrial development and modern urban planning in the mid-late 19th century; only four towers still exist. A building associated with newer urbanism of the period is the ''Independen\u021ba'' Highschool.\n\nThis area has the oldest church in the city \u2013 in fact the first mention of the city itself is the reconfirmation of the local provostship as ''praepositum Cibiniensem'' \u2013 that was the religious center of the [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxons]] until the 15th century.<ref>Magyar katolikus lexikon XII.

As the main area for [[Bourgeoisie|burgher]] activities, the area contains most points of interest in the city.\n\n'''Grand Square'''\n\n(German: ''Gro\u00dfer Ring'', Romanian: ''Pia\u021ba Mare'' ) is, as its name suggests, the [[List of town squares by size|largest square]] of the city, and has been the center of the city since the 15th century. At 142 meters long and 93 meters wide, it is one of the largest ones in Transylvania.\n\n[[Brukenthal Palace]], one of the most important [[Baroque]] monuments in Romania, lies on the north-western corner of the square. It was erected between 1777 and 1787 as the main residence for the Governor of Transylvania [[Samuel von Brukenthal]]. It houses the main part of the ''National Brukenthal Museum'', opened in 1817, making it one of the oldest museums in the world. Next to the palace is the ''Blue House'' or ''Moringer House'', an 18th-century Baroque house bearing the old coat of arms of Sibiu on its fa\u00e7ade.\n\n[[File:Sibiu (15257629580).jpg|213x213px|thumb|Sibiu City Hall]]\n\nOn the north side is the [[Jesuit Church, Sibiu|Jesuit Church]], along with its dependencies, the former residence of the Jesuits in Sibiu. Also on the north side, at the beginning of the 20th century an ''[[Art Nouveau]]'' building was constructed on the west part, now it houses the mayor's office.\n\n[[File:Podul mincinosilor.jpg|thumb|212x212px|Liars Bridge in Lesser Square, erected in 1859]]\n\nNext to the Jesuit Church on the north side is the [[Council Tower of Sibiu|Council Tower]], the city's symbol. This former fortification tower from the 13th century has been successively rebuilt over the years. The building nearby used to be the City Council's meeting place; beneath it lies an access way between the ''Grand Square'' and the ''Lesser Square''.\n\nOn the south and east sides are two- or three-storey houses, having tall attics with small windows known as the ''city's eyes''. Most of these houses are dated 15th to 19th centuries, and most of them are Renaissance or Baroque in style.\n\n'''Lesser Square'''\n(''Small Square'', German: ''Kleiner Ring'') as its name implies, is a smaller square situated in the northern part of the Upper Town. After the 2007 rehabilitation there has been an increase in the number of small businesses such as pubs and restaurants in this area.\n\nThe square is connected to the other two squares and to other streets by small, narrow passages. The main access from the Lower City is through Ocnei Street, which divides the square in two. The street passes under the ''Liar's Bridge'' \u2013 the first bridge in Romania to have been cast in iron (1859).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://welcometoromania.ro/Sibiu/Sibiu_Podul_Mincinosilor_e.htm|title=The Bridge of Lies, Sibiu\u00b7|last=WR|website=welcometoromania.ro|accessdate=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104171643/http://welcometoromania.ro/Sibiu/Sibiu_Podul_Mincinosilor_e.htm|archivedate=4 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nTo the right of the bridge is another symbol of the city, ''The House of the Arts'', a 14th-century arched building formerly belonging to the Butchers' Guild. On the left side of the bridge is the ''Luxemburg House'', a Baroque four-storey building.\n\n'''Huet Square'''\nis the third of the three main squares of Sibiu. Its most notable feature is the [[Sibiu Lutheran Cathedral|Evangelical Lutheran Cathedral]] in its center. It is the place where the earliest fortifications have been built in the late 12th century or early 13th century. The buildings around this square are mainly [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]. On the west side lies the Brukenthal Highschool, in place of a former 14th-century school.\n\n[[File:Sibio, la Dika Turo de oriento, 4.jpeg|thumb|215x215px|right|[[Thalia Hall|The Thick Tower]]]]\n\n'''The Fortifications'''\nof Sibiu made the city one of the most important fortified cities in Central Europe. Multiple rings were built around the city, most of them out of clay bricks. The south-eastern fortifications are the best kept, and all three parallel lines are still visible. The first is an exterior earth mound, the second is a 10-meter-tall red brick wall, and the third line comprises towers linked by another 10-meter-tall wall. All structures are connected via a labyrinth of tunnels and passageways, designed to ensure transport between the city and lines of defense.\n\nIn the 16th century more modern elements were added to the fortifications, mainly leaf-shaped [[bastion]]s.

The suspension would have only been one week had he not have carried over points from a previous grapple tackle in round 1 of the year's competition. This meant he was suspended for Melbourne's [[2008 NRL Grand Final|2008 grand final]]. Melbourne Storm CEO Brian Waldron and coach [[Craig Bellamy (rugby league)|Craig Bellamy]] claimed the judiciary had made their minds up before Cameron's case was heard. The judiciary panel members then threatened to sue the club if the comments were not retracted. Cameron signed a four-year extension to his contract in December 2008, resulting in him being a contracted player through to the end of at least the 2012 season. His contract is rumoured to be partly funded by third party sponsors who do not contribute to the standard salary cap. He became the Melbourne Storm's most experienced playing player due to the retirement of [[Matt Geyer]] at the end of 2008. He became the last current Storm player in the squad who played under [[Mark Murray (rugby league)|Mark Murray]] as well as the only one to have played in a season when the Storm did not make the finals due to their performance (the Storm finished 10th in 2002, the year Smith made his debut).\n\nIn April 2009, he was named in the preliminary 25 man squad to represent Queensland in the opening [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] match for 2009.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]]|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,25398645-5016947,00.html|title=Queensland name preliminary State of Origin squad|accessdate=28 April 2009|date=28 April 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxsports.com.au%2Fstory%2F0%2C8659%2C25398645-5016947%2C00.html&date=2009-05-28|archivedate=28 May 2009 }}</ref> He was selected for Australia in the one-off test match against New Zealand on 8 May 2009.<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]]|title=Kangaroos selectors stick by losing World Cup team for New Zealand Test|first=Tom|last=Wald|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,25422175-5016947,00.html|date=3 May 2009|accessdate=3 May 2009}}</ref> In the preliminary final in which Melbourne defeated the [[Brisbane Broncos]] 40\u201310, he became Storm's highest ever point scorer, beating [[Matt Orford]]'s record of 877.

Melbourne Storm CEO Brian Waldron and coach [[Craig Bellamy (rugby league)|Craig Bellamy]] claimed the judiciary had made their minds up before Cameron's case was heard.

Developed by [[Parkway Holdings]], the company sold the building to Asia Pacific Investment Company in 2000. The mall is managed by [[Lendlease]].\n\n==History==\nParkway Parade was developed by Parkway Holdings and was completed in December 1983. At that time of completion, it was one of the first suburban shopping malls in Singapore. It featured many major tenants setting up their stores in the suburbs for the first time, such as Isetan, Marks and Spencer, Yaohan Best, children's department store Small World and MPH Bookstores. It also featured a wide array of food choices, including Chuck'E'Cheese, Hardees', and Petite Park. The mall also had an amusement centre occupying Levels 3 and 4 (Funland) and a playground at Level 7, which was the largest mall playground in Singapore at that time.\n\nIn 2000, the property was sold to Asia Pacific Insurance Company, and subsequently Lendlease was appointed to manage the mall.\n\nThe mall commenced its first makeover in March 2002 and was completed in two phases. The first phase included a new tenant mix, to reflect the positioning of the mall. This included anchor tenant, [[Giant Hypermarket|Giant]], occupying nearly half of the third floor. The mall's second phase was completed in November 2003, with a brand-new and expanded [[food court]] at the Basement floor and an [[Al fresco dining|alfresco]]-dining area on the first floor.

Developed by [[Parkway Holdings]], the company sold the building to Asia Pacific Investment Company in 2000. The mall is managed by [[Lendlease]].\n\n==History==\nParkway Parade was developed by Parkway Holdings and was completed in December 1983. At that time of completion, it was one of the first suburban shopping malls in Singapore. It featured many major tenants setting up their stores in the suburbs for the first time, such as Isetan, Marks and Spencer, Yaohan Best, children's department store Small World and MPH Bookstores. It also featured a wide array of food choices, including Chuck'E'Cheese, Hardees', and Petite Park. The mall also had an amusement centre occupying Levels 3 and 4 (Funland) and a playground at Level 7, which was the largest mall playground in Singapore at that time.\n\nIn 2000, the property was sold to Asia Pacific Insurance Company, and subsequently Lendlease was appointed to manage the mall.\n\nThe mall commenced its first makeover in March 2002 and was completed in two phases. The first phase included a new tenant mix, to reflect the positioning of the mall. This included anchor tenant, [[Giant Hypermarket|Giant]], occupying nearly half of the third floor. The mall's second phase was completed in November 2003, with a brand-new and expanded [[food court]] at the Basement floor and an [[Al fresco dining|alfresco]]-dining area on the first floor. It also included the completion of the 'Waterfall' leisure and dining precinct with one of the country's tallest glass waterfall, a water play area, six food and beverage outdoor kiosks and a restaurant. The mall was fully renovated in November 2003.\n\nFurther facelifts were done to mall's exterior featuring an expanded [[Al fresco dining|alfresco]]-dining to the first floor. in 2011, with the removal of the 'Waterfall' leisure feature and repositioning of the entrance area. Completed in end 2012, the new [[Al fresco dining|alfresco]]-dining area houses around 10 new tenants to the expansion, which includes Din Tai Fung, Papparich and Twelve Cupcakes.\n\nIn 2015, another round of renovations were made to keep the mall updated.
