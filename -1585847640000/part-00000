The next Europeans to reach Chile were Diego de Almagro and his band of [[Conquistador|Spanish conquistadors]], who came from [[Peru]] in 1535 seeking gold.

Although the Spanish did not find the extensive gold and silver they sought, they recognized the agricultural potential of Chile's central valley, and Chile became part of the [[Spanish Empire]].<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nConquest took place gradually, and the Europeans suffered repeated setbacks. A massive [[Mapuche]] insurrection that began in 1553 resulted in Valdivia's death and the destruction of many of the colony's principal settlements. Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the Mapuche and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven northward. The abolition of [[slavery]] by the Spanish crown in 1683 was done in recognition that enslaving the Mapuche intensified resistance rather than cowing them into submission. Despite royal prohibitions, relations remained strained from continual colonialist interference.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/storiadellaguer00caivgoog/storiadellaguer00caivgoog_djvu.txt |title=B\u00e1rbaros, page 66.

Buccaneers and English adventurers menaced the colony in addition to the Mapuche, as was shown by [[Sir Francis Drake]]'s 1578 raid on Valpara\u00edso, the colony's principal port.

A national [[Junta (governing body)|junta]] in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand]] \u2013 heir to the deposed king \u2013 was formed on 18 September 1810. The [[Government Junta of Chile (1810)|Government Junta of Chile]] proclaimed Chile an autonomous republic within the Spanish monarchy (in memory of this day, Chile celebrates its [[Fiestas Patrias (Chile)|National Day]] on 18 September each year).\n\nAfter these events, a movement for total independence, under the command of [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]] (one of the most renowned patriots) and his two brothers Juan Jos\u00e9 and [[Luis Carrera]], soon gained a wider following. Spanish attempts to re-impose arbitrary rule during what was called the [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]] led to a prolonged struggle, including infighting from [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], who challenged Carrera's leadership.\n\nIntermittent warfare continued until 1817. With Carrera in prison in Argentina, O'Higgins and anti-Carrera cohort [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]], hero of the [[Argentine War of Independence]], led [[Army of the Andes|an army]] that [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes]] into Chile and defeated the royalists. On 12 February 1818, [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|Chile was proclaimed an independent republic]]. The political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th-century Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. A strong presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nChile slowly started to expand its influence and to establish its borders. By the Tantauco Treaty, the archipelago of Chilo\u00e9 was incorporated in 1826. The economy began to boom due to the discovery of silver ore in Cha\u00f1arcillo, and the growing trade of the port of Valpara\u00edso, which led to conflict over maritime supremacy in the Pacific with Peru. At the same time, attempts were made to strengthen sovereignty in southern Chile intensifying [[Occupation of Araucan\u00eda|penetration into Araucan\u00eda]] and [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|colonizing Llanquihue with German immigrants]] in 1848. Through the founding of [[Fort Bulnes]] by the [[Schooner Ancud]] under the command of [[John Williams Wilson]], the [[Magallanes Region|Magallanes region]] joined the country in 1843, while the [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta region]], at the time part of Bolivia, began to fill with people.\n\n[[File:Sinking of the Esmeralda during the battle of Iquique.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Battle of Iquique]] on 21 May 1879. The victory of Chile in the [[War of the Pacific]] allowed its expansion into new territories.]]\n\nToward the end of the 19th century, the government in Santiago consolidated its position in the south by the [[Occupation of Araucan\u00eda]]. The [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] confirmed Chilean sovereignty over the [[Strait of Magellan]]. As a result of the [[War of the Pacific]] with Peru and Bolivia (1879\u201383), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating Bolivia's access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable [[Caliche (mineral)#Chilean caliche|nitrate]] deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence. Chile had joined the stand as one of the high-income countries in South America by 1870.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of the Global Economy.

However, the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests, particularly the House of Edwards who had strong ties to foreign investors. Soon after, the country engaged in a [[Argentine\u2013Chilean naval arms race|vastly expensive naval arms race]] with [[Argentina]] that nearly led to war.\n\n===20th century===\n{{see also|Parliamentary Era in Chile|1960 Valdivia earthquake|South American dreadnought race}}\n[[File:Chilean battleship Almirante Latorre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Chile's ''Almirante Latorre'' [[dreadnought]] in 1921]]\nThe Chilean economy partially degenerated into a system protecting the interests of a ruling [[oligarchy]]. By the 1920s, the emerging middle and working classes were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, [[Arturo Alessandri]], whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress. In the 1920s, [[Marxism|Marxist]] groups with strong popular support arose.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nA military coup led by General [[Luis Altamirano]] in 1924 set off a period of political instability that lasted until 1932. Of the ten governments that held power in that period, the longest lasting was that of General [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo]], who briefly held power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in what was a [[de facto]] dictatorship (although not really comparable in harshness or corruption to the type of military dictatorship that have often bedeviled the rest of Latin America).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Authoritarianism in Latin America since independence|last=Fowler|first=Will|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=University of Virginia|isbn=0-313-29843-2|pages=30\u201396}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Frazier|first=Lessie Jo |title=Salt in the Sand: Memory, Violence, and the Nation-State in Chile, 1890 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQU-GYGeVSEC&pg=PA163|accessdate=14 July 2013|date=17 July 2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-4003-4|pages=163\u2013184}}</ref>\n\nBy relinquishing power to a democratically elected successor, Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo retained the respect of a large enough segment of the population to remain a viable politician for more than thirty years, in spite of the vague and shifting nature of his ideology. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. During the period of [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]] dominance (1932\u201352), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo to office for another six years. [[Jorge Alessandri]] succeeded Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo in 1958, bringing Chilean conservatism back into power democratically for another term.\n\nThe [[1964 Chilean presidential election|1964 presidential election]] of [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] by an [[absolute majority]] initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan \"Revolution in Liberty\", the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and [[agrarian reform]], including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.<ref name=\"countrystudies\">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/chile/85.htm|title=Development and Breakdown of Democracy, 1830\u20131973|work=Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress|date=31 March 1994}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Salvador Allende Gossens-.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|[[Salvador Allende]]]]\n\nIn the 1970 election, Senator [[Salvador Allende]] of the [[Socialist Party of Chile]] (then part of the \"[[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]]\" coalition which included the Communists, Radicals, Social-Democrats, dissident Christian Democrats, the Popular Unitary Action Movement, and the Independent Popular Action),<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/> achieved a partial majority in a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in a three-way contest, followed by candidates Radomiro Tomic for the Christian Democrat Party and Jorge Alessandri for the Conservative Party.

These include eliminating the positions of appointed senators and [[senators for life]], granting the President authority to remove the commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, and reducing the presidential term from six to four years.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4157908.stm|title=Chile scraps Pinochet-era system|publisher=BBC | date=16 August 2005 | accessdate=31 December 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Congress of Chile]] has a 38-seat [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] and a 120-member [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]]. Senators serve for eight years with staggered terms, while deputies are elected every 4 years. The last congressional elections were held on 17 November 2013, concurrently with the presidential election. The current Senate has a 21\u201315 split in favor of the governing coalition and 2 independents. The current lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, contains 67 members of the governing center-left coalition, 48 from the center-right opposition and 5 from small parties or independents. The Congress is located in the port city of Valpara\u00edso, about {{convert|140|km|0|abbr=off}} west of the capital, Santiago.\n\n[[File:Congresschile.jpg|thumb|[[National Congress of Chile|National Congress]] building in [[Valpara\u00edso]]]]\n\nChile's congressional elections are governed by a [[Binomial System|binomial system]] that, for the most part, rewards the two largest representations equally, often regardless of their relative popular support. Parties are thus forced to form wide coalitions and, historically, the two largest coalitions (Concertaci\u00f3n and Alianza) split most of the seats. Only if the leading coalition ticket out-polls the second place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1 does the winning coalition gain both seats, which tends to lock the legislature in a roughly 50\u201350 split.\n\nChile's judiciary is independent and includes a court of appeal, a system of military courts, a constitutional tribunal, and the [[Supreme Court of Chile]]. In June 2005, Chile completed a nationwide overhaul of its criminal justice system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chileangovernment.cl/index.php?id=448&option=com_content&task=view |work=Chilean Government |title=President Lagos: We can make a greater effort to make yesterday's and today's trials equally just |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080423171251/http://www.chileangovernment.cl/index.php?id=448&option=com_content&task=view |archivedate=23 April 2008 }}</ref> The reform has replaced inquisitorial proceedings with an adversarial system more similar to that of the United States.\n\nIn the 2001 congressional elections, the conservative [[Independent Democratic Union]] (UDI) surpassed the [[Christian Democratic Party of Chile|Christian Democrats]] for the first time to become the largest party in the lower house. In the [[2005 Chilean parliamentary election|2005 parliamentary election]], both leading parties, the Christian Democrats and the UDI lost representation in favor of their respective allies [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] (which became the biggest party in the Concertaci\u00f3n block) and [[National Renewal (Chile)|National Renewal]] in the right-wing alliance. In the 2009 legislative elections in Chile, the [[Communist Party of Chile|Communist Party]] won 3 out of 120 seats in the Chamber of Deputies for the first time in 30 years (the Communist Party was not allowed to exist as such during the dictatorship).\n\nChileans voted in the first round of presidential elections on 17 November 2013. None of the nine presidential candidates got more than 50 percent of the vote. As a result, the top two candidates, center-left [[Nueva Mayor\u00eda]] coalition's [[Michelle Bachelet]] and center-right [[Alianza (Chile)|Alianza]] coalition's [[Evelyn Matthei]], competed in a run-off election on 15 December 2013, which Bachelet won. This was Chile's sixth presidential election since the end of the Pinochet era. All six have been judged free and fair. The president is constitutionally barred from serving consecutive terms.\n\n=== Foreign relations ===\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Chile}}\n[[File:Foreign relations of Chile.svg|thumb|upright=1.55|State of Chile's international relations in the world:\n{{legend|#006680|Chile}}\n{{legend|#008000|Country with diplomatic relations and Chilean embassy in the country.}}\n{{legend|#00AA88|Country with diplomatic relations and an embassy in Chile, but no Chilean embassy.}}\n{{legend|#8DD35F|Country with diplomatic relations but without ambassadors.}}\n{{legend|#cccccc|Country with no diplomatic relations currently.}}\n]]\n\nSince the early decades after independence, Chile has always had an active involvement in foreign affairs. In 1837 the country aggressively challenged the dominance of Peru's port of [[Callao]] for preeminence in the Pacific trade routes, defeating the short-lived alliance between Peru and Bolivia, the [[Peru-Bolivian Confederation]] (1836\u201339) in the [[War of the Confederation]]. The war dissolved the confederation while distributing power in the Pacific. A second international war, the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879\u201383), further increased Chile's regional role, while adding considerably to its territory.<ref name=\"hudson\"/>\n\nDuring the 19th century, Chile's commercial ties were primarily with Britain, a nation that had a major influence on the formation of the Chilean navy. The French influenced Chile's legal and educational systems and had a decisive impact on Chile, through the architecture of the capital in the boom years at the turn of the 20th century. German influence came from the organization and training of the army by [[Prussia]]ns.<ref name=\"hudson\"/>\n\nOn 26 June 1945, Chile participated as a founding member of the United Nations being among 50 countries that signed the [[United Nations Charter]] in San Francisco, California.<ref>{{cite web |title=Founding Member States |url=https://research.un.org/en/unmembers/founders |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=14 September 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190704121608/https://research.un.org/en/unmembers/founders |archivedate=4 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Chile |url=https://library.un.org/unms?combine=Chile |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=14 September 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914180256/https://library.un.org/unms?combine=Chile |archivedate=14 September 2019}}</ref> With the military coup of 1973, Chile became isolated politically as a result of widespread human rights abuses.<ref name=\"hudson\"/>\n\nSince its return to democracy in 1990, Chile has been an active participant in the international political arena. Chile completed a 2-year non-permanent position on the UN Security Council in January 2005. Jose Miguel Insulza, a Chilean national, was elected Secretary General of the Organization of American States in May 2005 and confirmed in his position, being re-elected in 2009. Chile is currently serving on the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Board of Governors, and the 2007\u20132008 chair of the board is Chile's ambassador to the IAEA, Milenko E. Skoknic. The country is an active member of the UN family of agencies and participates in UN peacekeeping activities.

Peruvians claim the Northern part of Chile, which is now South West of Peru. This is also known as the \"triangulation\" which was made to fix the boundary problem between Chile and Peru. The decisions were accomplished on 27 January 1839 by the International Court of Justice <ref>{{cite web |last1=Webb |first1=Peter H. |title=Chile, Peru, and the ICJ Boundary Settlement |url=http://blogs.law.unc.edu/ncilj/2014/02/24/chile-peru-and-the-icj-boundary-settlement/ |website=North Carolina Journal of International Law |publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Law |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> This became the [[War of the Pacific]] which was in the years 1879\u20131883.<ref>{{cite web |title=War of the Pacific |url=https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-the-Pacific |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopedia Britannica Inc. |accessdate=19 October 2018}}</ref> This conflict was caused by the mineral resources Chile had, Peruvians believed they belonged to them as well. Chile had to control sea shipping to Peru and sent out an army to invade Peru on 8 October 1879. The attempt was also made to The United States but failed badly on October 1880. There was a resistance between Peruvians and Chileans for a few years because they could not reach an agreement. The United States offered help with a treaty for both Peru and Chile, better known as the Treaty of Anc\u00f3n. This was later signed by both of them on 20 October 1883 to keep peace between them. In 2008, Peru took Chile to court over their maritime disputes. Then later in 2014, the International Court of Justice's ruling resulted in Chile losing 80 miles from Northwestern ocean zone.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bonnefoy |first1=Pascale |title=Court Grants Peru Ocean Territory Claimed by Chile |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/28/world/americas/court-grants-peru-ocean-territory-claimed-by-chile.html |newspaper=New York Times |publisher=New York Times Company |accessdate=19 October 2018|date=28 January 2014 }}</ref> This ruling severely impacted fishers in the country making Chile lose a valuable trade in Northwest Chile.\n\nThe Chilean government has diplomatic relations with most countries. It settled all its territorial disputes with Argentina during the 1990s except for part of the border at [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]]. Chile and Bolivia severed diplomatic ties in 1978 over Bolivia's desire to regain sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean after losing it to Chile in the 1879\u201383 War of the Pacific.

The relatively small Central Valley, which includes Santiago, dominates the country in terms of population and agricultural resources. This area is also the historical center from which Chile expanded in the late 19th century, when it integrated the northern and southern regions. Southern Chile is rich in forests, grazing lands, and features a string of volcanoes and lakes. The southern coast is a labyrinth of fjords, inlets, canals, twisting peninsulas, and islands.

To view maps based on [[SRTM]] topographic relief of the country, see [[:commons:Atlas of Chile/Clickable map|here]].]]\n[[File:Majestic Ojos del Salado volcano (4320230217).jpg|thumbnail|View of [[Ojos del Salado]] from the Chilean side.]]\n\nChile is located along a highly [[seismic]] and [[volcanic]] zone, part of the Pacific Ring of Fire, due to the subduction of the Nazca and Antarctic plates in the [[South American plate]].\n\nLate [[Paleozoic]], 251 million years ago, Chile belonged to the continental block called Gondwana. It was just a depression accumulated marine sediments began to rise at the end of the Mesozoic, 66 million years ago, due to the collision between the Nazca and South American plates, resulting in the Andes. The territory would be shaped by millions of years due to the folding of the rocks, forming the current relief.\n\nThe Chilean relief consists of the central depression, which crosses the country longitudinally, flanked by two mountain ranges that make up about 80% of the territory: the Andes mountains to the east-natural border with [[Bolivia]] and [[Argentina]] in the [[Atacama Region|region of Atacama]] and the Coastal Range west-minor height from the Andes. Chile's highest peak is the [[Nevado Ojos del Salado]], at 6891.3 m, which is also the highest volcano in the world. The highest point of the Coastal Range is Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna, at 3114 meters, located in the Sierra Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna, the south of [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta]]. Among the coastal mountains and the Pacific is a series of coastal plains, of variable length, which allow the settlement of coastal towns and big ports. Some areas of the plains territories encompass territory east of the Andes, and the Patagonian steppes and Magellan, or are high plateaus surrounded by high mountain ranges, such as the Altiplano or Puna de Atacama.\n\nThe [[Far North, Chile|Far North]] is the area between the northern boundary of the country and the [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] 26\u00b0 S, covering the first three regions. It is characterized by the presence of the [[Atacama desert]], the most arid in the world. The desert is fragmented by streams that originate in the area known as the [[Pampa del Tamarugal|pampas Tamarugal]]. The Andes, split in two and whose eastern arm runs [[Bolivia]], has a high altitude and volcanic activity, which has allowed the formation of the Andean altiplano and salt structures as the [[Salar de Atacama]], due to the gradual accumulation of sediments over time.\n[[File:Volcano Osorno and Petrohu\u00e9 waterfalls.JPG|thumbnail|[[Osorno (volcano)|Osorno Volcano]] and the [[Petrohu\u00e9 River]]]]\n[[File:Glaciar y laguna Nef, afluente Baker,.JPG|thumbnail|[[Nef Glacier]] and the Plomo Lake]]\n\nTo the south is the [[Norte Chico, Chile|Norte Chico]], extending to the [[Aconcagua River|Aconcagua river]]. Los Andes begin to decrease its altitude to the south and closer to the coast, reaching 90&nbsp;km away at the height of [[Illapel]], the narrowest part of the Chilean territory. The two mountain ranges intersect, virtually eliminating the intermediate depression. The existence of rivers flowing through the territory allows the formation of [[Transverse Valleys|transverse valleys]], where agriculture has developed strongly in recent times, while the [[coastal plains]] begin to expand.\n\nThe [[Zona Central, Chile|Central]] area is the most populated region of the country. The coastal plains are wide and allow the establishment of cities and ports along the Pacific. The Andes maintains altitudes above 6000m but descend slowly starts approaching the 4000 meters on average. The intermediate depression reappears becoming a fertile valley that allows agricultural development and human settlement, due to sediment accumulation. To the south, the Cordillera de la Costa reappears in the [[Nahuelbuta Range|range of Nahuelbuta]] while glacial sediments originate a series of lakes in the area of [[La Frontera, Chile|La Frontera]].\n\nPatagonia extends from within Reloncavi, at the height of parallel 41\u00b0S, to the south. During the [[Llanquihue glaciation|last glaciation]], this area was covered by ice that strongly eroded Chilean relief structures. As a result, the intermediate depression sinks in the sea, while the coastal mountains rise to a series of archipelagos, such as [[Chilo\u00e9 Island|Chilo\u00e9]] and the [[Chonos Archipelago|Chonos]], disappearing in Taitao peninsula, in the parallel 47\u00b0S. The Andes mountain range loses height and erosion caused by the action of glaciers has caused [[fjords]].\n\nEast of the Andes, on the continent, or north of it, on the [[Tierra del Fuego (main island)|island of Tierra del Fuego]] are located relatively flat plains, which in the Strait of Magellan cover large areas.\n\nThe Andes, as he had done previously Cordillera de la Costa, begins to break in the ocean causing a myriad of islands and islets and disappear into it, sinking and reappearing in the Southern Antilles arc and then the Antarctic Peninsula, where it is called Antartandes, in the Chilean Antarctic Territory, lying between the meridians 53\u00b0W and 90\u00b0W.\n\nIn the middle of the Pacific, the country has sovereignty over several islands of volcanic origin, collectively known as Insular Chile. Of these, we highlight the archipelago of Juan Fernandez and Easter Island, which is located in the fracture zone between the Nazca plate and the Pacific plate known as East Pacific Rise.\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n[[File:Lago General Carrera - Camino a Capilla de M\u00e1rmol.JPG|thumb|left|[[General Carrera Lake|General Carrera lake]], the largest in the country.]]\n\nDue to the characteristics of the territory, Chile is crossed by numerous rivers generally short in length and with low torrential flow. They commonly extend from the [[Andes Mountains|Andes]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]], flowing in an East to West.\n\nBecause of the [[Atacama desert]], in the Norte Grande there are only short [[endorheic]] character streams, except for the [[Loa River]], the longest in the country 440&nbsp;km.<ref name=hydr>{{cite journal |author1=Niemeyer, Hans |author2=Cereceda, Pilar |year=1983 |title=Hydrography |journal=Geography of Chile |publisher=[[Military Geographic Institute (Chile)|Military Geographic Institute]] |edition=1st |location=Santiago |volume=8 }}</ref> In the high valleys, wetland areas generate [[Chungar\u00e1 Lake]], located at 4500 meters above sea level. It and the [[Lauca River]] are shared with [[Bolivia]], as well as the [[Lluta River]].\n\nIn the center-north of the country, the number of rivers that form valleys of agricultural importance increases. Noteworthy are the Elqui with 75&nbsp;km<ref name=hydr/> long, 142&nbsp;km Aconcagua, Maipo with 250&nbsp;km<ref name=hydr/> and its tributary, the Mapocho with 110&nbsp;km, and Maule with 240&nbsp;km.

Due to its geographical isolation and strict customs policies Chile is free from diseases such as [[mad cow disease]], [[Drosophilidae|fruit fly]] and [[Phylloxera]]. This, its location in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], which has quite different harvesting times from the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and its wide range of agriculture conditions are considered Chile's main comparative advantages. However, Chile's mountainous landscape limits the extent and intensity of agriculture so that arable land corresponds only to 2.62% of the total territory. Chile currently utilizes 14,015 Hectares of agricultural land.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://data.oecd.org/chile.htm|title=Chile - OECD Data|website=theOECD|language=en|access-date=2 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Chile}}\n[[File:Salar de Atacama.jpg|thumb|[[Salar de Atacama]] in the [[Atacama Desert]]]]\n[[File:Valle_del_Elqui,_La_Serena-Chile.JPG|thumb|[[Elqui Valley (wine region)|Elqui Valley]], wine and pisco region]]\n[[File:Cerro Concepcion.jpg|thumb|[[Valpara\u00edso]]]]\n[[File:Puerto Varas Osorno.jpg|thumb|[[Puerto Varas]]]]\n\nTourism in Chile has experienced sustained growth over the last few decades.

Other results achieved by the national football team include two [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] titles ([[2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica|2015]] and [[Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario|2016]]), and two runners up positions, one silver and two bronze medals at the [[Pan American Games]], a bronze medal at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]] and two third places finishes in the FIFA under-17 and under-20 youth tournaments. The top league in the [[Chilean football league system]] is the [[Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n]], which is named by the [[International Federation of Football History & Statistics|IFFHS]] as the ninth strongest national football league in the world.<ref name=iffhs>{{cite web |url=http://www.iffhs.de/?b6e28fa3002f71504e52d17f7370eff3702bb1c2bb11 |title=The strongest National League in the World 2011 |work=IFFHS |accessdate=18 April 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe main football clubs are [[Colo-Colo]], [[Club Universidad de Chile|Universidad de Chile]] and [[Club Deportivo Universidad Cat\u00f3lica|Universidad Cat\u00f3lica]]. Colo-Colo is the country's most successful football club, having both the most national and international championships, including the coveted [[Copa Libertadores]] South American club tournament. Universidad de Chile was the last international champion ([[Copa Sudamericana]] 2011).\n\nTennis is Chile's most successful sport. Its [[Chile Davis Cup team|national team]] won the [[World Team Cup]] clay tournament twice (2003 & 2004), and played the [[Davis Cup]] final against [[Italy]] in 1976. At the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] the country captured gold and bronze in men's singles and gold in men's doubles. [[Marcelo R\u00edos]] became the first Latin American man to reach the number one spot in the [[List of ATP number 1 ranked singles tennis players|ATP singles rankings]] in 1998. [[Anita Lizana]] won the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in 1937, becoming the first woman from Latin America to win a [[Grand Slam (tennis)|Grand Slam]] tournament. [[Luis Ayala (tennis)|Luis Ayala]] was twice a runner-up at the French Open and both R\u00edos and [[Fernando Gonz\u00e1lez]] reached the Australian Open men's singles finals. Gonz\u00e1lez also won a silver medal in singles at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]] in Beijing.\n\nAt the Summer Olympic Games Chile boasts a total of two gold medals (tennis), seven silver medals (athletics, [[Equestrian at the Summer Olympics|equestrian]], [[boxing]], shooting and tennis) and four bronze medals (tennis, boxing and football). In 2012, Chile won its first Paralympic Games medal (gold in Athletics).\n\n[[File:15 Abril 2015, Ministro \u00c1lvaro Elizalde junto a la Presidenta Michelle Bachelet reciben al Equipo Campe\u00f3n Mundial de Polo en La Moneda.

A sport similar to [[hockey]] called ''[[chueca]]'' was played by the Mapuche people during the Spanish conquest. [[Skiing]] and [[snowboarding]] are practiced at ski centers located in the Central Andes, and in southern ski centers near to cities as Osorno, Puerto Varas, Temuco and Punta Arenas. [[Surfing in Chile|surfing]] is popular at some coastal towns. [[Polo]] is professionally practiced within Chile, with the country achieving top prize in the 2008 and 2015 [[World Polo Championship]].\n\n[[Basketball]] is a popular sport in which Chile has earned a bronze medal in the first men's [[FIBA World Championship]] held in 1950 and winning a second bronze medal when Chile hosted the [[1959 FIBA World Championship]]. Chile hosted the first [[FIBA World Championship for Women]] in 1953 finishing the tournament with the silver medal. [[San Pedro de Atacama]] is host to the annual \"Atacama Crossing\", a six-stage, {{convert|250|km|adj=on}} footrace which annually attracts about 150 competitors from 35 countries.

The next Europeans to reach Chile were Diego de Almagro and his band of [[Conquistador|Spanish conquistadors]], who came from [[Peru]] in 1535 seeking gold. The Spanish encountered various cultures that supported themselves principally through [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture and hunting.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n[[File:Pedro de Valdivia.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Pedro de Valdivia]], conqueror of Chile]]\nThe conquest of Chile began in earnest in 1540 and was carried out by [[Pedro de Valdivia]], one of [[Francisco Pizarro]]'s lieutenants, who founded the city of Santiago on 12 February 1541. Although the Spanish did not find the extensive gold and silver they sought, they recognized the agricultural potential of Chile's central valley, and Chile became part of the [[Spanish Empire]].<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nConquest took place gradually, and the Europeans suffered repeated setbacks. A massive [[Mapuche]] insurrection that began in 1553 resulted in Valdivia's death and the destruction of many of the colony's principal settlements. Subsequent major insurrections took place in 1598 and in 1655. Each time the Mapuche and other native groups revolted, the southern border of the colony was driven northward. The abolition of [[slavery]] by the Spanish crown in 1683 was done in recognition that enslaving the Mapuche intensified resistance rather than cowing them into submission. Despite royal prohibitions, relations remained strained from continual colonialist interference.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/storiadellaguer00caivgoog/storiadellaguer00caivgoog_djvu.txt |title=B\u00e1rbaros, page 66.

Serving as a sort of frontier [[garrison]], the colony found itself with the mission of forestalling encroachment by both the Mapuche and Spain's European enemies, especially the [[British Empire|British]] and the Dutch. Buccaneers and English adventurers menaced the colony in addition to the Mapuche, as was shown by [[Sir Francis Drake]]'s 1578 raid on Valpara\u00edso, the colony's principal port. Chile hosted one of the largest standing armies in the Americas, making it one of the most militarized of the Spanish possessions, as well as a [[Real Situado|drain on the treasury of the Viceroyalty of Peru]].<ref name=\"hudson\"/>\n\nThe first general census was conducted by the government of [[Agust\u00edn de J\u00e1uregui]] between 1777 and 1778; it indicated that the population consisted of 259,646 inhabitants: 73.5 percent of [[White Latin American|European descent]], 7.9 percent [[mestizo]]s, 8.6 percent [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] and 9.8 percent blacks. Francisco Hurtado, Governor of the province of [[Chilo\u00e9 Province|Chilo\u00e9]], conducted a census in 1784 and found the population consisted of 26,703 inhabitants, 64.4 percent of whom were whites and 33.5 percent of whom were natives.\n\nThe Diocese of [[Concepci\u00f3n, Chile|Concepci\u00f3n]] conducted a census in areas south of the [[Maule river]] in 1812, but did not include the indigenous population or the inhabitants of the province of Chilo\u00e9.

A national [[Junta (governing body)|junta]] in the name of [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand]] \u2013 heir to the deposed king \u2013 was formed on 18 September 1810. The [[Government Junta of Chile (1810)|Government Junta of Chile]] proclaimed Chile an autonomous republic within the Spanish monarchy (in memory of this day, Chile celebrates its [[Fiestas Patrias (Chile)|National Day]] on 18 September each year).\n\nAfter these events, a movement for total independence, under the command of [[Jos\u00e9 Miguel Carrera]] (one of the most renowned patriots) and his two brothers Juan Jos\u00e9 and [[Luis Carrera]], soon gained a wider following. Spanish attempts to re-impose arbitrary rule during what was called the [[Reconquista (Spanish America)|Reconquista]] led to a prolonged struggle, including infighting from [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], who challenged Carrera's leadership.\n\nIntermittent warfare continued until 1817. With Carrera in prison in Argentina, O'Higgins and anti-Carrera cohort [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]], hero of the [[Argentine War of Independence]], led [[Army of the Andes|an army]] that [[Crossing of the Andes|crossed the Andes]] into Chile and defeated the royalists. On 12 February 1818, [[Chilean Declaration of Independence|Chile was proclaimed an independent republic]]. The political revolt brought little social change, however, and 19th-century Chilean society preserved the essence of the stratified colonial social structure, which was greatly influenced by family politics and the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]]. A strong presidency eventually emerged, but wealthy landowners remained powerful.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nChile slowly started to expand its influence and to establish its borders. By the Tantauco Treaty, the archipelago of Chilo\u00e9 was incorporated in 1826. The economy began to boom due to the discovery of silver ore in Cha\u00f1arcillo, and the growing trade of the port of Valpara\u00edso, which led to conflict over maritime supremacy in the Pacific with Peru. At the same time, attempts were made to strengthen sovereignty in southern Chile intensifying [[Occupation of Araucan\u00eda|penetration into Araucan\u00eda]] and [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|colonizing Llanquihue with German immigrants]] in 1848. Through the founding of [[Fort Bulnes]] by the [[Schooner Ancud]] under the command of [[John Williams Wilson]], the [[Magallanes Region|Magallanes region]] joined the country in 1843, while the [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta region]], at the time part of Bolivia, began to fill with people.\n\n[[File:Sinking of the Esmeralda during the battle of Iquique.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Battle of Iquique]] on 21 May 1879.

The [[Boundary treaty of 1881 between Chile and Argentina]] confirmed Chilean sovereignty over the [[Strait of Magellan]]. As a result of the [[War of the Pacific]] with Peru and Bolivia (1879\u201383), Chile expanded its territory northward by almost one-third, eliminating Bolivia's access to the Pacific, and acquired valuable [[Caliche (mineral)#Chilean caliche|nitrate]] deposits, the exploitation of which led to an era of national affluence. Chile had joined the stand as one of the high-income countries in South America by 1870.<ref>{{cite book|title=A History of the Global Economy.

However, the Civil War had also been a contest between those who favored the development of local industries and powerful Chilean banking interests, particularly the House of Edwards who had strong ties to foreign investors. Soon after, the country engaged in a [[Argentine\u2013Chilean naval arms race|vastly expensive naval arms race]] with [[Argentina]] that nearly led to war.\n\n===20th century===\n{{see also|Parliamentary Era in Chile|1960 Valdivia earthquake|South American dreadnought race}}\n[[File:Chilean battleship Almirante Latorre.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Chile's ''Almirante Latorre'' [[dreadnought]] in 1921]]\nThe Chilean economy partially degenerated into a system protecting the interests of a ruling [[oligarchy]]. By the 1920s, the emerging middle and working classes were powerful enough to elect a reformist president, [[Arturo Alessandri]], whose program was frustrated by a conservative congress. In the 1920s, [[Marxism|Marxist]] groups with strong popular support arose.<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/>\n\nA military coup led by General [[Luis Altamirano]] in 1924 set off a period of political instability that lasted until 1932. Of the ten governments that held power in that period, the longest lasting was that of General [[Carlos Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo]], who briefly held power in 1925 and then again between 1927 and 1931 in what was a [[de facto]] dictatorship (although not really comparable in harshness or corruption to the type of military dictatorship that have often bedeviled the rest of Latin America).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Authoritarianism in Latin America since independence|last=Fowler|first=Will|year=1996|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=University of Virginia|isbn=0-313-29843-2|pages=30\u201396}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Frazier|first=Lessie Jo |title=Salt in the Sand: Memory, Violence, and the Nation-State in Chile, 1890 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gQU-GYGeVSEC&pg=PA163|accessdate=14 July 2013|date=17 July 2007|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=978-0-8223-4003-4|pages=163\u2013184}}</ref>\n\nBy relinquishing power to a democratically elected successor, Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo retained the respect of a large enough segment of the population to remain a viable politician for more than thirty years, in spite of the vague and shifting nature of his ideology. When constitutional rule was restored in 1932, a strong middle-class party, the Radicals, emerged. It became the key force in coalition governments for the next 20 years. During the period of [[Radical Party (Chile)|Radical Party]] dominance (1932\u201352), the state increased its role in the economy. In 1952, voters returned Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo to office for another six years. [[Jorge Alessandri]] succeeded Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez del Campo in 1958, bringing Chilean conservatism back into power democratically for another term.\n\nThe [[1964 Chilean presidential election|1964 presidential election]] of [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrat]] [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] by an [[absolute majority]] initiated a period of major reform. Under the slogan \"Revolution in Liberty\", the Frei administration embarked on far-reaching social and economic programs, particularly in education, housing, and [[agrarian reform]], including rural unionization of agricultural workers. By 1967, however, Frei encountered increasing opposition from leftists, who charged that his reforms were inadequate, and from conservatives, who found them excessive. At the end of his term, Frei had not fully achieved his party's ambitious goals.<ref name=\"countrystudies\">{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/chile/85.htm|title=Development and Breakdown of Democracy, 1830\u20131973|work=Country Studies|publisher=Library of Congress|date=31 March 1994}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Salvador Allende Gossens-.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|[[Salvador Allende]]]]\n\nIn the 1970 election, Senator [[Salvador Allende]] of the [[Socialist Party of Chile]] (then part of the \"[[Popular Unity (Chile)|Popular Unity]]\" coalition which included the Communists, Radicals, Social-Democrats, dissident Christian Democrats, the Popular Unitary Action Movement, and the Independent Popular Action),<ref name=\"countrystudies\"/> achieved a partial majority in a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of votes in a three-way contest, followed by candidates Radomiro Tomic for the Christian Democrat Party and Jorge Alessandri for the Conservative Party.

Senators serve for eight years with staggered terms, while deputies are elected every 4 years. The last congressional elections were held on 17 November 2013, concurrently with the presidential election. The current Senate has a 21\u201315 split in favor of the governing coalition and 2 independents. The current lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, contains 67 members of the governing center-left coalition, 48 from the center-right opposition and 5 from small parties or independents. The Congress is located in the port city of Valpara\u00edso, about {{convert|140|km|0|abbr=off}} west of the capital, Santiago.\n\n[[File:Congresschile.jpg|thumb|[[National Congress of Chile|National Congress]] building in [[Valpara\u00edso]]]]\n\nChile's congressional elections are governed by a [[Binomial System|binomial system]] that, for the most part, rewards the two largest representations equally, often regardless of their relative popular support. Parties are thus forced to form wide coalitions and, historically, the two largest coalitions (Concertaci\u00f3n and Alianza) split most of the seats. Only if the leading coalition ticket out-polls the second place coalition by a margin of more than 2-to-1 does the winning coalition gain both seats, which tends to lock the legislature in a roughly 50\u201350 split.\n\nChile's judiciary is independent and includes a court of appeal, a system of military courts, a constitutional tribunal, and the [[Supreme Court of Chile]].

Peruvians claim the Northern part of Chile, which is now South West of Peru. This is also known as the \"triangulation\" which was made to fix the boundary problem between Chile and Peru.

Chile had to control sea shipping to Peru and sent out an army to invade Peru on 8 October 1879. The attempt was also made to The United States but failed badly on October 1880. There was a resistance between Peruvians and Chileans for a few years because they could not reach an agreement. The United States offered help with a treaty for both Peru and Chile, better known as the Treaty of Anc\u00f3n. This was later signed by both of them on 20 October 1883 to keep peace between them.

It was just a depression accumulated marine sediments began to rise at the end of the Mesozoic, 66 million years ago, due to the collision between the Nazca and South American plates, resulting in the Andes. The territory would be shaped by millions of years due to the folding of the rocks, forming the current relief.\n\nThe Chilean relief consists of the central depression, which crosses the country longitudinally, flanked by two mountain ranges that make up about 80% of the territory: the Andes mountains to the east-natural border with [[Bolivia]] and [[Argentina]] in the [[Atacama Region|region of Atacama]] and the Coastal Range west-minor height from the Andes. Chile's highest peak is the [[Nevado Ojos del Salado]], at 6891.3 m, which is also the highest volcano in the world. The highest point of the Coastal Range is Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna, at 3114 meters, located in the Sierra Vicu\u00f1a Mackenna, the south of [[Antofagasta Region|Antofagasta]]. Among the coastal mountains and the Pacific is a series of coastal plains, of variable length, which allow the settlement of coastal towns and big ports. Some areas of the plains territories encompass territory east of the Andes, and the Patagonian steppes and Magellan, or are high plateaus surrounded by high mountain ranges, such as the Altiplano or Puna de Atacama.\n\nThe [[Far North, Chile|Far North]] is the area between the northern boundary of the country and the [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] 26\u00b0 S, covering the first three regions. It is characterized by the presence of the [[Atacama desert]], the most arid in the world. The desert is fragmented by streams that originate in the area known as the [[Pampa del Tamarugal|pampas Tamarugal]]. The Andes, split in two and whose eastern arm runs [[Bolivia]], has a high altitude and volcanic activity, which has allowed the formation of the Andean altiplano and salt structures as the [[Salar de Atacama]], due to the gradual accumulation of sediments over time.\n[[File:Volcano Osorno and Petrohu\u00e9 waterfalls.JPG|thumbnail|[[Osorno (volcano)|Osorno Volcano]] and the [[Petrohu\u00e9 River]]]]\n[[File:Glaciar y laguna Nef, afluente Baker,.JPG|thumbnail|[[Nef Glacier]] and the Plomo Lake]]\n\nTo the south is the [[Norte Chico, Chile|Norte Chico]], extending to the [[Aconcagua River|Aconcagua river]]. Los Andes begin to decrease its altitude to the south and closer to the coast, reaching 90&nbsp;km away at the height of [[Illapel]], the narrowest part of the Chilean territory. The two mountain ranges intersect, virtually eliminating the intermediate depression. The existence of rivers flowing through the territory allows the formation of [[Transverse Valleys|transverse valleys]], where agriculture has developed strongly in recent times, while the [[coastal plains]] begin to expand.\n\nThe [[Zona Central, Chile|Central]] area is the most populated region of the country. The coastal plains are wide and allow the establishment of cities and ports along the Pacific. The Andes maintains altitudes above 6000m but descend slowly starts approaching the 4000 meters on average. The intermediate depression reappears becoming a fertile valley that allows agricultural development and human settlement, due to sediment accumulation. To the south, the Cordillera de la Costa reappears in the [[Nahuelbuta Range|range of Nahuelbuta]] while glacial sediments originate a series of lakes in the area of [[La Frontera, Chile|La Frontera]].\n\nPatagonia extends from within Reloncavi, at the height of parallel 41\u00b0S, to the south. During the [[Llanquihue glaciation|last glaciation]], this area was covered by ice that strongly eroded Chilean relief structures. As a result, the intermediate depression sinks in the sea, while the coastal mountains rise to a series of archipelagos, such as [[Chilo\u00e9 Island|Chilo\u00e9]] and the [[Chonos Archipelago|Chonos]], disappearing in Taitao peninsula, in the parallel 47\u00b0S. The Andes mountain range loses height and erosion caused by the action of glaciers has caused [[fjords]].\n\nEast of the Andes, on the continent, or north of it, on the [[Tierra del Fuego (main island)|island of Tierra del Fuego]] are located relatively flat plains, which in the Strait of Magellan cover large areas.\n\nThe Andes, as he had done previously Cordillera de la Costa, begins to break in the ocean causing a myriad of islands and islets and disappear into it, sinking and reappearing in the Southern Antilles arc and then the Antarctic Peninsula, where it is called Antartandes, in the Chilean Antarctic Territory, lying between the meridians 53\u00b0W and 90\u00b0W.\n\nIn the middle of the Pacific, the country has sovereignty over several islands of volcanic origin, collectively known as Insular Chile. Of these, we highlight the archipelago of Juan Fernandez and Easter Island, which is located in the fracture zone between the Nazca plate and the Pacific plate known as East Pacific Rise.\n\n=== Hydrography ===\n[[File:Lago General Carrera - Camino a Capilla de M\u00e1rmol.JPG|thumb|left|[[General Carrera Lake|General Carrera lake]], the largest in the country.]]\n\nDue to the characteristics of the territory, Chile is crossed by numerous rivers generally short in length and with low torrential flow. They commonly extend from the [[Andes Mountains|Andes]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]], flowing in an East to West.\n\nBecause of the [[Atacama desert]], in the Norte Grande there are only short [[endorheic]] character streams, except for the [[Loa River]], the longest in the country 440&nbsp;km.<ref name=hydr>{{cite journal |author1=Niemeyer, Hans |author2=Cereceda, Pilar |year=1983 |title=Hydrography |journal=Geography of Chile |publisher=[[Military Geographic Institute (Chile)|Military Geographic Institute]] |edition=1st |location=Santiago |volume=8 }}</ref> In the high valleys, wetland areas generate [[Chungar\u00e1 Lake]], located at 4500 meters above sea level. It and the [[Lauca River]] are shared with [[Bolivia]], as well as the [[Lluta River]].\n\nIn the center-north of the country, the number of rivers that form valleys of agricultural importance increases. Noteworthy are the Elqui with 75&nbsp;km<ref name=hydr/> long, 142&nbsp;km Aconcagua, Maipo with 250&nbsp;km<ref name=hydr/> and its tributary, the Mapocho with 110&nbsp;km, and Maule with 240&nbsp;km. Their waters mainly flow from Andean snowmelt in the summer and winter rains. The major lakes in this area are the artificial lake Rapel, the Colbun Maule lagoon and the lagoon of La Laja.\n\n== Demographics ==\n[[File:Chile-demography.png|thumb|upright=1.35|Population of Chile from 1820, projected up to 2050]]\n{{Main|Demographics of Chile}}\n\nChile's 2017 census reported a population of 17,574,003.

Due to its geographical isolation and strict customs policies Chile is free from diseases such as [[mad cow disease]], [[Drosophilidae|fruit fly]] and [[Phylloxera]]. This, its location in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], which has quite different harvesting times from the [[Northern Hemisphere]], and its wide range of agriculture conditions are considered Chile's main comparative advantages.

This was nearly a year before [[Robert Peary]], who similarly claimed to have reached the North Pole on April 6, 1909. Both men's accounts have been disputed ever since.<ref>Henderson 2009, pp. 58\u201369.</ref> His expedition discovered [[Meighen Island]], the only discovery of an island in the [[North American Arctic]] by an expedition with a United States national on board.\n\nIn December 1909, after reviewing Cook's limited records, a commission of the [[University of Copenhagen]] ruled his claim unproven. In 1911, Cook published a memoir of his expedition, continuing his claim. His account of reaching the summit of [[Denali]] has also been discredited.\n\n== Biography ==\nCook's birthplace is often listed as [[Callicoon (CDP), New York]], but he was born in [[Hortonville, New York]], also in the Town of Delaware in Sullivan County.<ref>Bryce (1997), p. 3.</ref> His parents were recent German immigrants who anglicized their name by adopting a phonetic version of their surname. He attended local schools before college. He graduated from [[Columbia University]] and did medical studies at [[New York University Medical School]], receiving his doctorate <!-- or M.D.? -->in 1890. \n\nCook married Libby Forbes in 1889. She died two years later. In 1902, on his 37th birthday, he married Marie Fidele Hunt. They had two daughters together.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/frederick-albert-cook-explorer-and-physician-usa-his-news-photo/501373901|title=Ruth and Helene Cook|work=Haeckel Collection|publisher=Getty Images|accessdate=2018-09-26}}</ref> After more than two decades of marriage, they divorced in 1923.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Early expeditions ===\nCook was the surgeon on [[Robert Peary]]'s Arctic expedition of 1891\u20131892, and on the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] of 1897\u20131899. He contributed to saving the lives of its crew members when their ship\u2014the {{RV|Belgica|1884|2}}\u2014was ice-bound during the winter, as they had not prepared for such an event. It became the first expedition to winter in the Antarctic region. To prevent [[scurvy]], Cook went hunting to keep the crew supplied with fresh meat.\n\nIn 1897, Cook twice visited [[Tierra del Fuego]], where he met Anglican missionary [[Thomas Bridges (Anglican missionary)|Thomas Bridges]]. They studied the [[Ona people|Ona]] and [[Yahgan]] peoples, with whom Bridges had worked for two decades. During this time, he had prepared a manuscript on their language's grammar and a dictionary of more than 30,000 words. Cook borrowed the manuscript for reference but failed to return it before Bridges' death in 1898. Several years later, he tried to publish the dictionary as his own.<ref name=\"parson\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/05/21/104935739.pdf \"Cook Tried to Steal Parson's Life Work\"]. ''New York Times'', May 21, 1910. Accessed October 3, 2013</ref>\n\n=== Summit of Denali ===\n[[File:Fakepeak.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Alleged photo of Denali's summit, now known as [[Fake Peak]]]]\nIn 1903, Cook led an expedition to [[Denali]], during which he circumnavigated the range. He made a second journey in 1906, after which he claimed to have achieved the first summit of its peak with one other expedition crew member. Other members, including Belmore Browne, whom Cook had left on the lower mountain, immediately but privately expressed doubt. Cook's claims were not publicly challenged until 1909 when the dispute with Peary over the North Pole claim erupted, with Peary's supporters claiming Cook's Denali ascent was also fraudulent.\n\nUnlike [[Hudson Stuck]] in 1913, Cook had not taken photographs from atop McKinley. His alleged photo of the summit was found to have been taken on [[Fake Peak|a small outcrop on a ridge beside the Ruth Glacier]], {{Convert|19|mi|km|abbr=}} away.<ref>Bryce, R. (1997). [http://www.dioi.org/vols/w73.pdf \"An aerial photograph by Bradford Washburn\"]. ''DIO''. '''7''' (2). p. 40.</ref>\n\nIn late 1909, [[Ed Barrill]], Cook's sole companion during the 1906 climb, signed an affidavit saying that they had not reached the summit. In the late 20th century, historians found that he had been paid by Peary supporters to deny Cook's claim. (Henderson writes that this fact was covered up at the time, but Bryce says that it was never a secret.)<ref>[http://www.dioi.org/vols/w93.pdf ''DIO'']. '''9''' (3). p. 129. note 18.</ref> Up until a month before, Barrill had consistently asserted that he and Cook had reached the summit. His 1909 affidavit included a map correctly locating what came to be called [[Fake Peak]], featured in Cook's \"summit\" photo, and showing that he and Cook had turned back at the Gateway.<ref>Bryce, R.

He planned to attempt to reach the [[North Pole]], although he did not announce his intention until August 1907, when he was already in the Arctic. He left [[Annoatok]], a small settlement in the north of [[Greenland]], in February 1908. Cook claimed that he reached the pole on April 21, 1908, after traveling north from [[Axel Heiberg Island]], taking with him only two Inuit men, Ahpellah and Etukishook. On the journey south, he claimed to have been cut off from his intended route to Annoatok by open water. Living off local game, his party was forced to push south to [[Jones Sound]], spending the open water season and part of the winter on [[Devon Island]]. From there they traveled north, eventually crossing [[Nares Strait]] to Annoatok on the Greenland side in the spring of 1909. They said they almost died of starvation during the journey.\n\nCook and his two companions were gone from Annoatok for 14 months, and their whereabouts in that period is a matter of intense controversy. In the view of Canadian historian [[Pierre Berton]] (Berton, 2001), Cook's story of his trek around the Arctic islands is probably legitimate. Other writers have relied on later accounts told by Cook's companions to investigators, who seemed to present another view.\n\nThere are similarities between Ahpellah and Etukishook's sketched route of their journey south, and the route taken by the fictional shipwrecked explorers in [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[The Adventures of Captain Hatteras]]''. For example, the route the two Inuit traced on a map goes over both the Pole of Cold and the wintering site of the fictional expedition. Both expeditions went to the same area of [[Jones Sound]] in hopes of finding a whaling ship to take them to civilization.<ref>Osczevski (2003).</ref>\n\nCook's claim was initially widely believed, but it was disputed by Cook's rival polar explorer [[Robert Peary]], who claimed to have reached the North Pole in April 1909. Cook initially congratulated Peary for his achievement, but Peary and his supporters launched a campaign to discredit Cook. They enlisted the aid of socially prominent persons outside the field of science, such as [[American football|football]] [[Coach (sport)|coach]] [[Fielding H. Yost]] (as related in [[Fred Russell]]'s 1943 book, ''I'll Go Quietly'').\n\n[[File:Picture of Frederick Cook.jpg|thumb|Cook in arctic gear]]\nCook never produced detailed original navigational records to substantiate his claim to have reached the North Pole. He said that his detailed records were part of his belongings, contained in three boxes, which he left at Annoatok in April 1909. He had left them with [[Harry Whitney]], an American hunter who had traveled to Greenland with Peary the previous year due to the lack of manpower for a second sledge-journey {{Convert|700|mi|km|abbr=}} south to [[Upernavik]]. When Whitney tried to bring Cook's boxes with him on his return to the US on Peary's ship ''Roosevelt'' in 1909, Peary refused to allow them on board. As a result, Whitney left Cook's boxes in a cache in Greenland. They were never found.\n\nOn December 21, 1909, a commission at the [[University of Copenhagen]], after having examined evidence submitted by Cook, ruled that his records did not contain proof that the explorer reached the Pole.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/12/22/101752152.pdf | title=University Finds That Cook's Papers Contain no Proof That He Reached the North Pole | newspaper=The New York Times | date=December 22, 1909 | accessdate=2011-12-20}}</ref> (Peary refused to submit his records for review by such a third party, and for decades the [[National Geographic Society]], which held his papers, refused researchers access to them.)\n\nCook intermittently claimed he had kept copies of his sextant navigational data, and in 1911 published some.<ref>Cook, F. (1911). ''My Attainment of the Pole''. pp. 258, 274. Cook's first account of what he left with Whitney did not mention data, and Whitney knew of no data in what was left with him.

The major conflicts have been resolved in the light of improved geographical knowledge.<ref>Osczevski, R. J. (2003). ''Arctic''. '''56''' (4).</ref> Whitney was convinced that they had reached the North Pole with Cook, but was reluctant to be drawn into the controversy.\n\nThe Peary expedition's people (primarily [[Matthew Henson]], who had a working knowledge of Inuit, and George Borup, who did not) claimed that Ahwelah and Etukishook told them they had traveled only a few days from land. A map allegedly was drawn by Ahwelaw and Etukishook that correctly located and accurately depicted then-unknown [[Meighen Island]], which strongly suggests that they visited it as they claimed.<ref>Osczevski, R.

Amundsen also had the advantage of traveling over a continent. He left unmistakable evidence of his presence at the South Pole, whereas any ice on which Cook might or might not have camped would have drifted many miles in the year between the competing claims.\n\nAt the end of his 1911 memoir, Cook wrote: \"I have stated my case, presented my proofs. As to the relative merits of my claim, and Mr. Peary's, place the two records side by side. Compare them. I shall be satisfied with your decision.\"\n\n== Reputation ==\nCook's reputation never recovered from the attacks on his claim. While Peary's North Pole claim was widely accepted for most of the 20th century, it has since been discredited by a variety of reviewers, including the [[National Geographic Society]], which long supported him. Cook spent the next few years defending his claim and threatening to sue writers who said that he had faked the trip. \n\nResearching the complicated story of the conflicting claims, the writer Robert Bryce began to assess how the men's personalities and goals were in contrast, and evaluated them against the period of the [[Gilded Age]].<ref name=\"ringle\"/> He believes that Cook, as a physician and [[ethnographer]], cared about the people on his expedition and admired the Inuit. Bryce writes that Cook \"genuinely loved and hungered for the real meat of exploration\u2014mapping new routes and shorelines, learning and adapting to the survival techniques of the Eskimos, advancing his own knowledge\u2014and that of the world\u2014for its own sake.\"<ref name=\"ringle\">[http://www.surveyhistory.org/the_polar_controversy_resolved1.htm Ken Ringle, review: \"''Cook & Peary - The Polar Controversy Resolved''\"], ''Backsights'', 1997, published by Surveyors Historical Society, accessed 3 October 2013</ref> But, he could not find supporters to help finance the expeditions without a goal that was more flashy. There was tremendous pressure on each man to be the first to reach the Pole, in order to gain financial support for continued expeditions.\n\n=== Fraud trial ===\nIn 1919, Cook started promoting startup oil companies in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. In April 1923, Cook and 24 other Fort Worth oil promoters were indicted in a federal crackdown on fraudulent oil company promotions. Three of Cook's employees pleaded guilty, but Cook insisted on his innocence and went to trial. Also tried was his head advertising copywriter, S. E. J. Cox, who had been previously convicted of mail fraud in connection with his own oil company promotions.\n\nAmong other deceptive practices, Cook was charged with paying dividends from stock sales, rather than from profits. Cook's attorney was former politician [[Joseph Weldon Bailey]], who clashed frequently with the judge. The jury found Cook guilty on 14 counts of fraud. In November 1923, Judge Killits sentenced Cook and 13 other oil company promoters to prison terms. Cook drew the longest sentence, 14 years 9 months. His attorney appealed the verdict, but the conviction was upheld.<ref>Olien, R. (1989). \"Doctor Frederick A. Cook and the Petroleum Producers' Association\", ''Journal of the West''. '''28''' (4). pp. 33\u201336.</ref>\n\n== Later life ==\nCook was imprisoned until 1930. [[Roald Amundsen]], who believed he owed his life to Cook's extrication of the ''Belgica'', visited him several times.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Cook was [[pardon]]ed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1940, ten years after his release and shortly before his death of a cerebral hemorrhage on August 5. He was interred at the Chapel of [[Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo]].\n\n== Popular culture ==\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085360/ ''Cook & Peary: The Race to the Pole''] (1983) \u2013 American TV movie\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088551/ ''The Last Place on Earth''] (1985) \u2013 British miniseries\n* ''The Navigator of New York'' (2003) \u2013 Novel by [[Wayne Johnston (author)|Wayne Johnston]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book\n |last       = Berton\n |first      = P.

This was nearly a year before [[Robert Peary]], who similarly claimed to have reached the North Pole on April 6, 1909. Both men's accounts have been disputed ever since.<ref>Henderson 2009, pp. 58\u201369.</ref> His expedition discovered [[Meighen Island]], the only discovery of an island in the [[North American Arctic]] by an expedition with a United States national on board.\n\nIn December 1909, after reviewing Cook's limited records, a commission of the [[University of Copenhagen]] ruled his claim unproven. In 1911, Cook published a memoir of his expedition, continuing his claim. His account of reaching the summit of [[Denali]] has also been discredited.\n\n== Biography ==\nCook's birthplace is often listed as [[Callicoon (CDP), New York]], but he was born in [[Hortonville, New York]], also in the Town of Delaware in Sullivan County.<ref>Bryce (1997), p. 3.</ref> His parents were recent German immigrants who anglicized their name by adopting a phonetic version of their surname. He attended local schools before college. He graduated from [[Columbia University]] and did medical studies at [[New York University Medical School]], receiving his doctorate <!-- or M.D.? -->in 1890. \n\nCook married Libby Forbes in 1889. She died two years later. In 1902, on his 37th birthday, he married Marie Fidele Hunt. They had two daughters together.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/frederick-albert-cook-explorer-and-physician-usa-his-news-photo/501373901|title=Ruth and Helene Cook|work=Haeckel Collection|publisher=Getty Images|accessdate=2018-09-26}}</ref> After more than two decades of marriage, they divorced in 1923.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Early expeditions ===\nCook was the surgeon on [[Robert Peary]]'s Arctic expedition of 1891\u20131892, and on the [[Belgian Antarctic Expedition]] of 1897\u20131899. He contributed to saving the lives of its crew members when their ship\u2014the {{RV|Belgica|1884|2}}\u2014was ice-bound during the winter, as they had not prepared for such an event. It became the first expedition to winter in the Antarctic region. To prevent [[scurvy]], Cook went hunting to keep the crew supplied with fresh meat.\n\nIn 1897, Cook twice visited [[Tierra del Fuego]], where he met Anglican missionary [[Thomas Bridges (Anglican missionary)|Thomas Bridges]]. They studied the [[Ona people|Ona]] and [[Yahgan]] peoples, with whom Bridges had worked for two decades. During this time, he had prepared a manuscript on their language's grammar and a dictionary of more than 30,000 words. Cook borrowed the manuscript for reference but failed to return it before Bridges' death in 1898. Several years later, he tried to publish the dictionary as his own.<ref name=\"parson\">[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/05/21/104935739.pdf \"Cook Tried to Steal Parson's Life Work\"].

He made a second journey in 1906, after which he claimed to have achieved the first summit of its peak with one other expedition crew member. Other members, including Belmore Browne, whom Cook had left on the lower mountain, immediately but privately expressed doubt. Cook's claims were not publicly challenged until 1909 when the dispute with Peary over the North Pole claim erupted, with Peary's supporters claiming Cook's Denali ascent was also fraudulent.\n\nUnlike [[Hudson Stuck]] in 1913, Cook had not taken photographs from atop McKinley. His alleged photo of the summit was found to have been taken on [[Fake Peak|a small outcrop on a ridge beside the Ruth Glacier]], {{Convert|19|mi|km|abbr=}} away.<ref>Bryce, R. (1997).

In the late 20th century, historians found that he had been paid by Peary supporters to deny Cook's claim.

He planned to attempt to reach the [[North Pole]], although he did not announce his intention until August 1907, when he was already in the Arctic. He left [[Annoatok]], a small settlement in the north of [[Greenland]], in February 1908. Cook claimed that he reached the pole on April 21, 1908, after traveling north from [[Axel Heiberg Island]], taking with him only two Inuit men, Ahpellah and Etukishook. On the journey south, he claimed to have been cut off from his intended route to Annoatok by open water. Living off local game, his party was forced to push south to [[Jones Sound]], spending the open water season and part of the winter on [[Devon Island]]. From there they traveled north, eventually crossing [[Nares Strait]] to Annoatok on the Greenland side in the spring of 1909. They said they almost died of starvation during the journey.\n\nCook and his two companions were gone from Annoatok for 14 months, and their whereabouts in that period is a matter of intense controversy. In the view of Canadian historian [[Pierre Berton]] (Berton, 2001), Cook's story of his trek around the Arctic islands is probably legitimate. Other writers have relied on later accounts told by Cook's companions to investigators, who seemed to present another view.\n\nThere are similarities between Ahpellah and Etukishook's sketched route of their journey south, and the route taken by the fictional shipwrecked explorers in [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[The Adventures of Captain Hatteras]]''. For example, the route the two Inuit traced on a map goes over both the Pole of Cold and the wintering site of the fictional expedition. Both expeditions went to the same area of [[Jones Sound]] in hopes of finding a whaling ship to take them to civilization.<ref>Osczevski (2003).</ref>\n\nCook's claim was initially widely believed, but it was disputed by Cook's rival polar explorer [[Robert Peary]], who claimed to have reached the North Pole in April 1909. Cook initially congratulated Peary for his achievement, but Peary and his supporters launched a campaign to discredit Cook. They enlisted the aid of socially prominent persons outside the field of science, such as [[American football|football]] [[Coach (sport)|coach]] [[Fielding H. Yost]] (as related in [[Fred Russell]]'s 1943 book, ''I'll Go Quietly'').\n\n[[File:Picture of Frederick Cook.jpg|thumb|Cook in arctic gear]]\nCook never produced detailed original navigational records to substantiate his claim to have reached the North Pole. He said that his detailed records were part of his belongings, contained in three boxes, which he left at Annoatok in April 1909. He had left them with [[Harry Whitney]], an American hunter who had traveled to Greenland with Peary the previous year due to the lack of manpower for a second sledge-journey {{Convert|700|mi|km|abbr=}} south to [[Upernavik]]. When Whitney tried to bring Cook's boxes with him on his return to the US on Peary's ship ''Roosevelt'' in 1909, Peary refused to allow them on board. As a result, Whitney left Cook's boxes in a cache in Greenland. They were never found.\n\nOn December 21, 1909, a commission at the [[University of Copenhagen]], after having examined evidence submitted by Cook, ruled that his records did not contain proof that the explorer reached the Pole.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1909/12/22/101752152.pdf | title=University Finds That Cook's Papers Contain no Proof That He Reached the North Pole | newspaper=The New York Times | date=December 22, 1909 | accessdate=2011-12-20}}</ref> (Peary refused to submit his records for review by such a third party, and for decades the [[National Geographic Society]], which held his papers, refused researchers access to them.)\n\nCook intermittently claimed he had kept copies of his sextant navigational data, and in 1911 published some.<ref>Cook, F. (1911). ''My Attainment of the Pole''. pp. 258, 274. Cook's first account of what he left with Whitney did not mention data, and Whitney knew of no data in what was left with him. See Rawlins, 1973, pp. 87, 166, 301\u2013302.</ref> These have an incorrect solar diameter.<ref>Rawlins (1972). ''[[Norwegian Journal of Geography]]''. Oslo University. '''26'''. pp. 135\u2013140.</ref> Ahwelah and Etukishook, Cook's Inuit companions, gave seemingly conflicting details about where they had gone with him. The major conflicts have been resolved in the light of improved geographical knowledge.<ref>Osczevski, R. J. (2003). ''Arctic''. '''56''' (4).</ref> Whitney was convinced that they had reached the North Pole with Cook, but was reluctant to be drawn into the controversy.\n\nThe Peary expedition's people (primarily [[Matthew Henson]], who had a working knowledge of Inuit, and George Borup, who did not) claimed that Ahwelah and Etukishook told them they had traveled only a few days from land. A map allegedly was drawn by Ahwelaw and Etukishook that correctly located and accurately depicted then-unknown [[Meighen Island]], which strongly suggests that they visited it as they claimed.<ref>Osczevski, R. J. (2003). \"Frederick Cook and the Forgotten Pole\". ''Arctic''. '''56''' (2). pp. 207\u2013217.</ref><ref>Rawlins, 1973, Chapter 6.</ref> Meighen Island, a genuine Cook discovery, is the only island to be discovered by a United States expedition in the North American arctic.<ref>[http://www.dioi.org/cot.htm#mvmn Discoveries: \"Meighen Island\"], DIOI</ref> For more detail see Bryce (1997) and Henderson (2005).\n\nThe conflicting claims of Cook and Peary prompted [[Roald Amundsen]] to take extensive precautions in navigation during his [[South Pole]] expedition so there could be no doubt concerning attainment of the pole if successful. Amundsen also had the advantage of traveling over a continent. He left unmistakable evidence of his presence at the South Pole, whereas any ice on which Cook might or might not have camped would have drifted many miles in the year between the competing claims.\n\nAt the end of his 1911 memoir, Cook wrote: \"I have stated my case, presented my proofs. As to the relative merits of my claim, and Mr. Peary's, place the two records side by side. Compare them. I shall be satisfied with your decision.\"\n\n== Reputation ==\nCook's reputation never recovered from the attacks on his claim. While Peary's North Pole claim was widely accepted for most of the 20th century, it has since been discredited by a variety of reviewers, including the [[National Geographic Society]], which long supported him. Cook spent the next few years defending his claim and threatening to sue writers who said that he had faked the trip. \n\nResearching the complicated story of the conflicting claims, the writer Robert Bryce began to assess how the men's personalities and goals were in contrast, and evaluated them against the period of the [[Gilded Age]].<ref name=\"ringle\"/> He believes that Cook, as a physician and [[ethnographer]], cared about the people on his expedition and admired the Inuit. Bryce writes that Cook \"genuinely loved and hungered for the real meat of exploration\u2014mapping new routes and shorelines, learning and adapting to the survival techniques of the Eskimos, advancing his own knowledge\u2014and that of the world\u2014for its own sake.\"<ref name=\"ringle\">[http://www.surveyhistory.org/the_polar_controversy_resolved1.htm Ken Ringle, review: \"''Cook & Peary - The Polar Controversy Resolved''\"], ''Backsights'', 1997, published by Surveyors Historical Society, accessed 3 October 2013</ref> But, he could not find supporters to help finance the expeditions without a goal that was more flashy. There was tremendous pressure on each man to be the first to reach the Pole, in order to gain financial support for continued expeditions.\n\n=== Fraud trial ===\nIn 1919, Cook started promoting startup oil companies in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]]. In April 1923, Cook and 24 other Fort Worth oil promoters were indicted in a federal crackdown on fraudulent oil company promotions. Three of Cook's employees pleaded guilty, but Cook insisted on his innocence and went to trial. Also tried was his head advertising copywriter, S. E. J. Cox, who had been previously convicted of mail fraud in connection with his own oil company promotions.\n\nAmong other deceptive practices, Cook was charged with paying dividends from stock sales, rather than from profits. Cook's attorney was former politician [[Joseph Weldon Bailey]], who clashed frequently with the judge. The jury found Cook guilty on 14 counts of fraud. In November 1923, Judge Killits sentenced Cook and 13 other oil company promoters to prison terms. Cook drew the longest sentence, 14 years 9 months. His attorney appealed the verdict, but the conviction was upheld.<ref>Olien, R. (1989). \"Doctor Frederick A. Cook and the Petroleum Producers' Association\", ''Journal of the West''. '''28''' (4). pp. 33\u201336.</ref>\n\n== Later life ==\nCook was imprisoned until 1930. [[Roald Amundsen]], who believed he owed his life to Cook's extrication of the ''Belgica'', visited him several times.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} Cook was [[pardon]]ed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1940, ten years after his release and shortly before his death of a cerebral hemorrhage on August 5. He was interred at the Chapel of [[Forest Lawn Cemetery, Buffalo]].\n\n== Popular culture ==\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085360/ ''Cook & Peary: The Race to the Pole''] (1983) \u2013 American TV movie\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088551/ ''The Last Place on Earth''] (1985) \u2013 British miniseries\n* ''The Navigator of New York'' (2003) \u2013 Novel by [[Wayne Johnston (author)|Wayne Johnston]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n*{{cite book\n |last       = Berton\n |first      = P.

It includes dates of [[declarations of independence]], [[geographical renaming|changes in country name]], changes of [[capital city]] or name, and significant [[Political history of the world|changes in territory]] such as the [[annexation]], [[cession]], or [[secession]] of land.\n\nThe types of changes listed here usually include (but are not limited to) the alteration of borders, the creation and fall of [[State (polity)|states]], changes of geographical names, as well as a few geographical changes caused by unusually destructive natural disasters. Through the knowledge of such dates and events, the approximate year and age of a [[world map]] could be calculated and estimated.\n\nNot all maps of the world created during a given age or period will be the same across the globe, as different [[cartography|mapmakers]]{{spnd}}or their employers{{spnd}}may have different views on the sovereignty or territorial integrity of the countries of the world or possess different levels of technological sophistication or geographical insight. {{citation needed span|Even maps created by the same mapmaker around the same time can differ significantly.|date=January 2019|reason=This statement needs not just a reference to two maps, but rather a WP:SECONDARY source that supports this assertion.}}\n\nThe timeline below presents its information in reverse chronological order, beginning in the modern era and working backwards.\n\nThis article uses the [[Common Era|Common Calendar System]], which was established as the new [[Gregorian calendar|Christian Calendar]] by [[Pope Gregory XIII]] in 1582. The Common Calendar uses the designation [[Common Era]] (CE or AD for [[Anno Domini]]) for years starting 1 January 1&nbsp;CE, and [[Before Common Era]] (BCE or BC for [[Before Christ]]) for years before that date. The Common Calendar also follows the [[ordinal number]]s rather than the [[cardinal number]]s, so there was no \"[[year zero]]\" in this format; that is, the date 1 January 1&nbsp;CE immediately followed the date 31 December 1&nbsp;BCE. For the same reason, while the [[Year 2000 problem|2000s]] began on Saturday, 1 January 2000&nbsp;CE, the official [[3rd millennium|Third Millennium]] began on Monday, 1 January 2001&nbsp;CE.\n\n{{center|\n'''&nbsp;[[#21st century|2000s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#1990s|1900s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#1890s|1800s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#18th century|1700s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#17th century|1600s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#16th century|1500s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#15th century|1400s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#14th century|1300s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#13th century|1200s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#12th century|1100s]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#11th century|1000s]]&nbsp;<br/>&nbsp;[[#1990s|1st&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;CE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#First Millennium&nbsp;BCE|1st&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#Second Millennium&nbsp;BCE|2nd&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#Third Millennium&nbsp;BCE|3rd&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#Fourth Millennium&nbsp;BCE|4th&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp; &nbsp;[[#Tenth Millennium&nbsp;BCE|10th&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;BCE]]&nbsp;'''\n}}\n\n{{Expand list|date=November 2019}}\n\n===21st century===\n\n==== 2020s ====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:6%\" |Year|| style=\"width:8%\" |Date|| style=\"width:86%\" |Event\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |2020\n| align=\"center\" |27&nbsp;March\n|[[North Macedonia]] [[North Macedonia\u2013NATO relations|becomes]] a member state of [[NATO]].\n|-\n|31 January\n|[[Brexit]]: The [[United Kingdom]] [[Withdrawal from the European Union|withdraws]] from the [[European Union]].\n|}\n====2010s====\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|-\n!style=\"width:6%\"|Year||style=\"width:8%\"|Date||style=\"width:86%\"|Event\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\"|2019\n|align=center|20&nbsp;March||'''[[Kazakhstan]]''' changes the name of its capital from Astana to [[Nur-Sultan]] in honour of ex-President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] after the [[Constitution of Kazakhstan]] is amended.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://meduza.io/news/2019/03/20/parlament-kazahstana-odobril-pereimenovanie-astany-v-nursultan|title=Parliament of Kazakhstan approves renaming of Astana to Nursultan|last=|first=|date=|website=meduza.io|language=Russian|access-date=21 March 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|align=center|12&nbsp;February||The [[Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia]] adopts the name '''[[Republic of North Macedonia]]''' as part of the [[Prespa agreement]], under which [[Greece]] will no longer veto the country's accession to [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vlada.mk/node/16763?ln=en-gb|title=Announcement of the Government of the Republic of North Macedonia for entry into force of the Final Agreement, Constitutional Amendments and Constitutional Law for Implementation of Amendments |work=Government of the Republic of North Macedonia |date=12 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190213025155/https://vlada.mk/node/16763?ln=en-gb |archive-date=13 February 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"TestoridesPaphitis2019\">{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/macedonia-vote-rattles-government-in-neighbor-greece/2019/01/11/5d31e88e-15a4-11e9-ab79-30cd4f7926f2_story.html |title=Europe: Macedonian lawmakers set to vote to change country's name |work=The Washington Post |date=11 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190113162131/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/macedonia-vote-rattles-government-in-neighbor-greece/2019/01/11/5d31e88e-15a4-11e9-ab79-30cd4f7926f2_story.html |archive-date=13 January 2019 |url-status=live |first=Konstantin |last=Testorides |author1-link=Konstantin Testorides |first2=Nicholas |last2=Paphitis |author2-link=Nicholas Paphitis |agency=Associated Press |quote=Macedonia late Friday {{bracket|11 January 2019}} fulfilled its part of a historic deal that will pave its way to NATO membership and normalize relations with neighboring Greece, after lawmakers approved constitutional changes to rename the country North Macedonia.&nbsp;... {{bracket|Under}} the full implementation of the agreement&nbsp;...

Tanner''''', 244 U.S. 590 (1917), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case in which the Court held that a Washington state law that prohibited employment agencies was unconstitutional.\n\n==Facts==\nWashington state attempted to pass a law, supported by the then Federal Department of Labor, to prohibit private employment agencies charging fees to people seeking work. It read as follows,\n\n{{quote|Section 1. The welfare of the State of Washington depends on the welfare of its workers, and demands that they be protected from conditions that result in their being liable to imposition and extortion.\n\nThe State of Washington therefore, exercising herein its police and sovereign power, declares that the system of collecting fees from the workers for furnishing them with employment, or with information leading thereto, results frequently in their becoming the victims of imposition and extortion, and is therefore detrimental to the welfare of the state.\n\nSection 2.

The ban was arbitrary and oppressive. Mr Justice Reynold said,\n\n{{quote|there is nothing inherently immoral or dangerous to public welfare in acting as paid representative of another to find a position in which he can earn an honest living. On the contrary, such service is useful, commendable, and in great demand. (at 593)}}\n\n===Dissent===\n[[Justice Brandeis]] (with whom Justice Holmes, Clarke and McKenna dissented) laid out in his dissenting judgment why employment agency activities were a legitimate concern. He highlighted sources from US Labor Department giving examples of abuse, attempts in over thirty states to regulate and have free public agencies compete. He stated how all methods short of abolition had ultimately failed (601-9).\n\nIn this period, the practice of charging destitute workers upfront fees for finding work was widespread. People might give up their last pennies for the chance of work. Sometimes, agencies made no effort to place the worker, or the work would last a few days and the employer would then split the next fee with the agent to bring in fresh replacements. Justice Brandeis cited from a report to a 1912 Congress Committee.\n\n{{quote|[[File:Brandeisl.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brandeis J]]'s dissent was notable as one of the first attempts to rely on policy documents in support of a judicial decision.]]\nTo declare the statute of a state, enacted in the exercise of the police power, invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment is a matter of such seriousness that I state the reasons for my dissent from the opinion of the court. The statute of the State of Washington commonly known as the \"Abolishing Employment Offices Measure\" was proposed by Initiative Petition No. 8, filed July 3, 1914, and was adopted November 3, 1914, at the general election, 162,054 votes being cast for the measure and 144,544 against it. In terms, the act merely prohibits the taking of fees from those seeking employment.<ref>\"An Act to Prohibit the Collection of Fees for the Securing of Employment, or Furnishing Information Leading Thereto, and Fixing a Penalty for Violation Thereof.\"\n\n\"Be it enacted by the people of the State of Washington:\"\n\n\"Section 1. The welfare of the State of Washington depends on the welfare of its workers, and demands that they be protected from conditions that result in their being liable to imposition and extortion. The State of Washington therefore, exercising herein police and sovereign power, declares that the system of collecting fees from the workers for furnishing them with employment, or with information leading thereto, results frequently in their becoming the victims of imposition and extortion, and is therefore detrimental to the welfare of the state.\"\n\n\"Section 2. It shall be unlawful for any employment agent, his representative, or any other person to demand or receive either directly or indirectly from any person seeking employment, or from any person in his or her behalf, any remuneration or fee whatsoever for furnishing him or her with employment or with information leading thereto.\"\n\n\"Section 3. For each and every violation of any of the provisions of this act, the penalty shall be a fine or [of] not more than $100 and imprisonment for not more than thirty days.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court of Washington has twice passed upon the scope of the act, holding in ''[[Huntsworth v. Tanner]]'', 87 Wash. 670, that it is not applicable to teachers, and in ''[[State v. Rossman]]'', 93 Wash. 530, that it is applicable to stenographers and bookkeepers.</ref>\n\nPlaintiffs, who are proprietors of private employment agencies in the City of Spokane, assert that this statute, if enforced, would compel them to discontinue business, and would thus, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, deprive them of their liberty and property without due process of law. The act leaves the plaintiffs free to collect fees from employers, and it appears that private employment offices thus restricted are still carrying on business.<ref>See Report of the Washington Bureau of Labor (1915, 1916), pp. 120-121. \"The free agencies, we are pleased to be able to say, are growing in popularity, and while they do not advertise their business with the same thrift that the other fellows did, they are coming into general service. There are three services of this kind: the private agency that receives all compensation from employers, either by the month, year, or per the service rendered, the federal agency, and the municipal agency; these latter two have offices in the larger places, and are doing good work, and the service is free to both employee and the employer. In the smaller cities and towns, the federal is the prevailing agency, and the postmaster of the place is usually the local representative.\"</ref> But even if it should prove, as plaintiffs allege, that their business could not live without collecting fees from employees, that fact would not necessarily render the act invalid. Private employment agencies are a business properly subject to police regulation and control. ''[[Brazee v. Michigan]]'', 241 U. S. 340. And this Court has made it clear that a statute enacted to promote health, safety, morals, or the public welfare may be valid, although it will compel discontinuance of existing businesses in whole or in part. Statutes prohibiting the manufacture and sale of liquor present the most familiar example of such a prohibition. But where, as here, no question of interstate commerce is involved, this Court has sustained also statutes or municipal ordinances which compelled discontinuance of such business as (a) of manufacturing and selling oleomargarine, ''[[Powell v. Pennsylvania]]'', 127 U. S. 678; (b) of selling cigarettes, ''[[Austin v. Tennessee]]'', 179 U. S. 343; (c) of selling futures in grain or other commodities, ''[[Booth v. Illinois]]'', 184 U. S. 425; (d) of selling stocks on margin, ''[[Otis v. Parker]]'', 187 U. S. 606; (e) of keeping billiard halls, ''[[Murphy v. California]]'', 225 U. S. 623; (f) of selling trading stamps, ''[[Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co.]]'', 240 U. S. 342, 240 U. S. 368.\n\nThese cases show that the scope of the police power is not limited to regulation, as distinguished from prohibition. They show also that the power of the state exists equally whether the end sought to be attained is the promotion of health, safety, or morals or is the prevention of fraud or the prevention of general demoralization.\n\n{{quote|\n\"If the state thinks that an admitted evil cannot be prevented except by prohibiting a calling or transaction not in itself necessarily objectionable, the courts cannot interfere unless, in looking at the substance of the matter, they can see that it 'is a clear, unmistakable infringement of rights secured by the fundamental law.'\"\n}}\n\n''[[Otis v. Parker]]'', 187 U. S. 606, 187 U. S. 609; ''[[Booth v. Illinois]]'', 184 U. S. 425, 184 U. S. 429. Or, as it is so frequently expressed, the action of the legislature is final unless the measure adopted appears clearly to be arbitrary or unreasonable, or to have no real or substantial relation to the object sought to be attained. Whether a measure relating to the public welfare is arbitrary or unreasonable, whether it has no substantial relation to the end proposed, is obviously not to be determined by assumptions or by a priori reasoning. The judgment should be based upon a consideration of relevant facts, actual or possible -- ex facto jus oritur. That ancient rule must prevail in order that we may have a system of living law.\n\nIt is necessary to inquire, therefore: what was the evil which the people of Washington sought to correct? Why was the particular remedy embodied in the statute adopted? And, incidentally, what has been the experience, if any, of other states or countries in this connection? But these inquiries are entered upon not for the purpose of determining whether the remedy adopted was wise, or even for the purpose of determining what the facts actually were. The decision of such questions lies with the legislative branch of the government. ''[[Powell v. Pennsylvania]]'', 127 U. S. 678, 127 U. S. 685. The sole purpose of the inquiries is to enable this Court to decide whether, in view of the facts, actual or possible, the action of the State of Washington was so clearly arbitrary or so unreasonable that it could not be taken \"by a free government without a violation of fundamental rights.\" See ''[[McCray v. United States]]'', 195 U. S. 27, 195 U. S. 64.\n\n1. The Evils<ref>The evils incident to private employment agencies first arrested public attention in America about 1890. During the fifteen years preceding the enactment of the Washington law, there were repeated investigations, official and unofficial, and there was much discussion and experimentation. See Free Public Employment Offices in the United States; U.S. Bureau of Labor, Bulletin No. 68, p. 1; Statistics of Unemployment and the Work of Employment Offices, U.S. Bureau of Labor Bulletin 109, p. 5; Subject Index of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bulletin No. 174, pp. 85-87; Munro, Bibliography of Municipal government, pp. 379-381.</ref>\n\nThe evils with which the people of Washington were confronted arose partly from the abuses incident to the system of private employment agencies and partly from its inadequacy.\n\n(a) The Abuses.\n\nThese are summarized in a report published by the United States Bureau of Labor in October, 1912,<ref>United States Bureau of Labor Bulletin No. 109, p. 36.</ref> thus:\n\n{{quote|\n\"Private employment agencies, which charge a fee for their services, are found in every city of any size in the United States. The nature of their business is such as to make possible most iniquitous practices. Their patrons are frequently men and women with only a dollar or two, which they are eager to give up for the opportunity of earning more. They are often of small intelligence and easily duped. Stories of how these agencies have swindled and defrauded those who sought employment through them are heard universally. Some of the more common of the fraudulent methods said to be used by these agencies are the following:\"\n\n\"1. Charging a fee and failing to make any effort to find work for the applicant.\"\n\n\"2. Sending applicants where no work exists.\"\n\n\"3. Sending applicants to distant points where no work or where unsatisfactory work exists, but whence the applicant will not return on account of the expense involved.\"\n\n\"4. Collusion between the agent and employer whereby the applicant is given a few days' work and then discharged to make way for new workmen, the agent and employer dividing the fee.\"\n\n\"5. Charging exorbitant fees, or giving jobs to such applicants as contribute extra fees, presents, etc.\"\n\n\"6. Inducing workers, particularly girls, who have been placed, to leave, pay another fee, and get a 'better job.' \"\n\n\"Other evils charged against employment agents are the congregating of persons for gambling or other evil practices, collusion with keepers of immoral houses, and the sending of women applicants to houses of prostitution; sometimes employment offices are maintained in saloons, with the resulting evils.\"}}\n\nIn the report to Congress of the United States Commission on Industrial Relations, created by Act of August 23, 1912, c. 351, 37 Stat. 415, which gave public hearings on the subject of employment offices in May 1914, the abuses are found to be as follows:<ref>Final Report and Testimony submitted to Congress by the Commission on Industrial Relations created by the Act of August 23, 1912, 64th Congress, 1st sess., Doc. 415, vol. I, pp. 109-111. See also vol. II. pp. 1165-1440.</ref>\n\n{{quote|\n\"23. There are many private employment agents who try to conduct their business honestly, but they are the exception, rather than the rule. The business as a whole reeks with fraud, extortion, and flagrant abuses of every kind. The most common evils are as follows:\"\n\n\"Fees are often charged out of all proportion to the service rendered. We know of cases where $5, $9, $10, and even $16 apiece has been paid for jobs at common labor. In one city, the fees paid by scrubwomen is at the rate of $24 a year for their poorly paid work. Then there is discrimination in the charges made for the same jobs. Often, too, men are sent a long distance, made to pay fees and transportation, only to find that no one at that place ordered men from the employment agent. A most pernicious practice is the collusion with foremen or superintendents by which the employment agent 'splits fees' with them. That is, the foreman agrees to hire men of a certain employment agent on condition that one fourth or one half of every fee collected from men whom he hires be given to him. This leads the foreman to discharge men constantly in order to have more men hired through the agent and more fees collected. It develops the 'three-gang' method so universally complained of by railroad and construction laborers, namely, one gang working, another coming to work from the employment agent, and a third going back to the city.\"\n\n\"Finally, there is the most frequent abuse -- misrepresentation of terms and condition of employment. Men are told that they will get more wages than are actually paid, or that the work will last longer than it actually will, or that there is a boarding house when there really is an insanitary camp, or that the cost of transportation will be paid, when it is to be deducted from the wages. They are not told of other deductions that will be made from wages; they are not informed about strikes that may be on at the places to which they are sent, nor about other important facts which they ought to know. These misrepresentations, it must be said, are often as much the fault of the employer as of the labor agent. Also, the employer will place his call for help with several agents, and each will send enough to fill the whole order, causing many to find no jobs. Labor agents and laborers alike are guilty of the misuse of free transportation furnished by employers to prospective help. And it is true also that many applicants perpetrate frauds on the labor agents themselves -- as, for example, causing them to return fees when positions actually were secured. This is the result of the general feeling that the whole system of paying fees for jobs is unjust, and if they must pay in order to get work, then any attempt to get the fee back is justifiable.\"}}\n\n(b) The Inadequacy.\n\nBut the evils were not limited to what are commonly called abuses, like the fraud and extortion described above. Even the exemplary private offices charging fees to workers might prove harmful for the reason thus stated in the report to Congress of the United States Commission on Industrial Relations, cited supra.\n\n{{quote|\n\"18... . Investigations show, however, that, instead of relieving unemployment and reducing irregularity, these employment agencies actually serve to congest the labor market and to increase idleness and irregularity of employment. They are interested primarily in the fees they can earn, and if they can earn more by bringing workers to an already overcrowded city, they do so. Again, it is an almost universal custom among private employment agents to fill vacancies by putting in them people who are working at other places. In this way, new vacancies are created, and more fees can be earned.\"\n\n\"19. They also fail to meet the problem because they are so numerous and are necessarily competitive. With few exceptions, there is no cooperation among them. This difficulty is further emphasized by the necessity of paying the registration fees required by many agencies; obviously the laborer cannot apply to very many if he has to pay a dollar at each one.\"\n\n\"20. The fees which private employment offices must charge are barriers which prevent the proper flow of labor into the channels where it is needed, and are a direct influence in keeping men idle. In the summer, when employment is plentiful, the fees are as low as 25 cents, and men are even referred to work free of charge. But this must necessarily be made up in the winter, when work is scarce. At such times, when men need work most badly, the private employment offices put up their fees and keep the unemployed from going to work until they can pay $2, $3, $5, and even $10 and more for their jobs. This necessity of paying for the privilege of going to work, and paying more the more urgently the job is needed, not only keeps people unnecessarily unemployed, but seems foreign to the spirit of American freedom and opportunity.\"\n\n\"21. An additional injustice inevitably connected with labor agencies which charge fees is that they must place the entire cost of the service upon those least able to bear it. Employment agents say that employers will not pay the fees; hence they must charge the employees. Among the wage earners, too, however, those who are least in need and can wait for work pay the least for jobs and even get them free, while those who are most in need make up for all the rest and pay the highest fees. The weakest and poorest classes of wage earners are therefore made to pay the largest share for a service rendered to employers, to workers, and to the public as well.\"\n}}\n\n2. The Remedies\n\nDuring the fifteen years preceding 1914, there had been extensive experimentation in the regulation of private employment agencies. Twenty-four states had attempted direct regulation under statutes, often supplemented by municipal ordinances.<ref>\"It is not necessary here to enter into the relative merits of governmental regulation and governmental operation. Suffice it to say that twenty-four states and the District of Columbia have attempted to regulate private employment agencies, and have made a miserable failure of it. The business lends itself easily to fraud and imposition, and it is far more true of the private agencies than of the public offices that they have been frauds as well as failures.\" Public Employment Offices -- W. M. Leiserson, 29 Political Science Quarterly (March 1914), p. 36. \"The United States possesses at the present time no adequate system, either state or national, for the regulation of private employment agencies, either from the point of view of the content of the laws, affording regulations of the business and restrictions as to how the business shall be carried on, or as to proper methods of enforcement.\" Labor Laws and Their Enforcement, edited by Susan M. Kingsbury (Boston, 1911) p. 366. See Chapter VI of this work for a study of the regulation of private employment agencies by Mabelle Moses. See also Chapter 663, Laws of 1913, State of Wisconsin.</ref> Nineteen states had attempted indirect regulation through the competition of state offices, and seven others through competition of municipal offices.<ref>Proceedings of the Association of Public Employment Offices (September 25, 1914), U.S. Dep. of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bulletin 192, p. 61.</ref> Other experiments in indirect regulation through competition petition were made by voluntary organizations, philanthropic, social, and industrial.<ref>Unemployment and Work of Employment Offices, Bulletin of U.S. Bureau of Labor No. 109, pp. 5, 37 (October, 1912).</ref> The results of those experiments were unsatisfactory. The abuses continued in large measure, and the private offices survived to a great extent the competition of the free agencies, public and private. There gradually developed a conviction that the evils of private agencies were inherent and ineradicable so long as they were permitted to charge fees to the workers seeking employment. And many believed that such charges were the root of the evil.\n\nOn September 25, 1914, the American Association of Public Employment Offices adopted at its annual meeting the following resolutions:\n\n{{quote|\n\"Resolved, That this association go on record as favoring the elimination as soon as possible, of all private employment agencies operating for a profit within the United States, and that it recommends to the consideration of the United States Commission on Industrial Relations and Congress and the various state legislatures legislation having this end in view.\"\n}}\n\nThe United States Commission on Industrial Relations declared in its report to Congress:<ref>Made in August 1915, and cited supra, Note 4 Between 1914 and this date, six states had legislated on the subject. See Unemployment Survey, 1914, 1915. 5 American Labor Legislation Review, p. 560.</ref>\n\n{{quote|\n\"24. Attempts to remove these abuses by regulation have been made in thirty-one states, but, with few exceptions, they have proved futile, and at most they have served only to promote a higher standard of honesty in the business, and have not removed the other abuses which are inherent in the system. Where the states and cities have spent much money for inspectors and complaint adjusters, there has been considerable improvement in the methods of private employment agencies, but most of the officers in charge of this regulation testify that the abuses are in 'the nature of the business,' and never can be entirely eliminated. They therefore favor the total abolition of private labor agencies. This is also the common opinion among working people, and in the several states, attempts have already been made to accomplish this by law.\"\n}}\n\nBut the remedies proposed were not limited to the suppression of private offices charging fees to workers and the extension of the system of state and municipal offices. The conviction became widespread that, for the solution of the larger problem of unemployment, the aid of the federal government and the utilization and development of its extensive machinery was indispensable. During the seven years preceding 1914, a beginning had been made in this respect. The Immigration Act of February 20, 1907, c. 1134, 34 Stat. 898, 909, created within the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization a Division of Information, charged with the duty of promoting \"a beneficial distribution of aliens.\" The services rendered by this division included, among others, some commonly performed by employment agencies. While it undertook to place in positions of employment only aliens, its operations were national in scope. The Act of March 4, 1913, creating the Department of Labor, resulted in a transfer of the Bureau of Immigration, including the Division of Information, to that department (37 Stat. 736). By this transfer, the scope of the division's work was enlarged to correspond with the broad powers of the Labor Department. These were declared by Congress to be:\n\n{{quote|\n\"to foster, promote and develop the welfare of the wage earners of the United States, to improve their working conditions, and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment.\"\n}}\n\nThen its efforts \"to distribute\" (that is, both to supply and to find places for) labor were extended to include citizens as well as aliens, and much was done to develop the machinery necessary for such distribution. In the summer of 1914, and in part before the filing in the State of Washington of the proposal for legislation here in question, action had been taken by the Department of Labor which attracted public attention. It undertook to supply harvest hands needed in the Middle West, and also to find work for the factory hands thrown out of employment by the great fire at Salem, Massachusetts, June 25, 1914.<ref>The fire was so extensive that the Congress appropriated $200,000 for relief of all sufferers. Act of August 1, 1914, c. 223, 38 Stat. 681.</ref> The division was strengthened by cooperation with other departments of the federal government (Agriculture, Interior, Commerce, and the Post office, with its 60,000 local offices) and with state and municipal employment offices. As early as June 13, 1914, the United States Department of Labor had also sought the cooperation in this work of all the leading newspapers in America, including those printed in foreign languages.<ref>Annual Report of the Secretary of Labor, 1914, pp. 48-55; Monthly Review of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, July 1915, p. 8; see also Annual Report of the Secretary of Labor, 1915, p. 36; \"Interdepartmental cooperation. -- Through the cooperation of the Post Office Department it became possible to bring to the aid of this labor-distribution service some 60,000 post offices, and thereby to create a network of communication between employers needing help without knowing where to get it and workers wanting employment without knowing where to find it. Either employer or workman may obtain at any post office in the United States a blank application supplied by this department, which, after filling out and signing it, he may deposit in the mails anywhere, free of postage... . Employment bulletins. -- The bulletins contain a statement of unmatched applications, no matter what part of the country they may come from. It is not expected, of course, that applications for work of a minor character will ordinarily be matched by applications for workers of that kind from distant stations. It is assumed, however, that bulletined applications may possibly be matched through the cooperation of nearby stations within a reasonable radius. The bulletins are also systematically sent to such newspapers as have indicated their desire to receive them for possible publication as news matter of interest to their respective readers.\"</ref>\n\n3. Conditions in the State of Washington\n\nThe peculiar needs of Washington emphasized the defects of the system of private employment offices.\n\n(a) The Evils.\n\nThe conditions generally prevailing are described in a report recently published by the United States Department of Labor, thus:<ref>Labor Laws and their Administration in the Pacific States. United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Bulletin No. 211 (1917), pp. 17, 18.</ref>\n\n{{quote|\n\"In no part of the United States, perhaps, is there so large a field for employment offices as in the Pacific states. As has been noted, industrial conditions there favor inconstancy of employment. Much of the business activity is based upon the casual, short-time job. This in itself means the frequent shifting of workers from place to place. And the shifting is the more difficult as much of the work offered is in more or less remote districts of the country... .\"\n\n\"The necessity laid upon so many workers of constantly seeking new jobs opens a peculiarly fertile field for their exploitation by unscrupulous private employment agencies. There is much testimony to the fact and frequency of such exploitation. The most striking evidence of this is that, in the State of Washington, private agencies made themselves so generally distrusted that, in 1915, their complete abolition was ordered by popular vote... .\"\n\n\"Prior to 1914, there was practically no legislation regarding private employment agencies, and there had been no attempt at state supervision of their conduct. But distrust of such agencies was constantly increasing, and culminated in the year mentioned in the passage by popular initiative of an act aiming at the total suppression of all private employment agencies of the commercial type.\"\n}}\n\nThe reports of the Washington State Bureau of Labor give this description:\n\n{{quote|\n\"The investigations of the Bureau show that the worst labor conditions in the state are to be found on highway and railroad construction work, and these are largely because the men are sent long distances by the employment agencies, are housed and fed poorly at the camps, and are paid on an average of $1.75 to $2.25 a day, out of which they are compelled to pay $5.50 to $7 per week for board, generally a hospital fee of some kind, always a fee to the employment agency, and their transportation to the point where the work is being done. The consequence is that they usually have but little money left when the work is finished, and if, as frequently happens, they work only a week or two and are then discharged, they are in as bad a situation as they were before they went to work, and sometimes worse, if they do not have enough money to get back to the place from which they started.<ref>Washington State Bureau of Labor, Report 1913, 1914, pp. 27, 28.</ref>\"\n\n\"That the honest toiler was their victim there is no question: not alone of a stiff fee for the information given, but a systematic method was adopted in order to keep the business going. Managers of agencies and managers of jobs, their superintendents, foremen, or subforemen were in this scheme for fleecing the workingman. Men in large numbers would be sent to contract jobs, and if on the railroads, 'free fare' was part of the inducement, or perhaps the agency would charge a nominal fee if the distance was great, and this, too, would become a perquisite of the bureau, to finally go through the clearing house. In many cases, men would be unsatisfactory -- at least they would be told so, discharged in a few days, and sent adrift as poor, may be poorer, than when they came there. New men would have to be secured, and thus the thing would go on revolving. So it went until at last it became so obnoxious that the public indignation was at length aroused, resulting in the passing of a law doing away with them.<ref>Washington state Bureau of Labor, Report 1915, 1916, p. 120.\n</ref>\"\n}}\n\nThe abuses and the inadequacy of the then existing system are also described by state officials in affidavits included in the record.\n\n(b) The Remedies.\n\nWashington had not tried direct regulation of private employment offices, but that method was being considered as late as 1912.<ref>Washington state Bureau of Labor, 1911-1912. Report of Commissioner, p. 16: \"It has been demonstrated that state control of employment agencies is the most effective way to properly regulate them. I would earnestly recommend a state law similar to the one in Illinois that went into effect July 1, 1911, and has proven to be the best law for this purpose in this country.\"</ref> Its people had had, on the other hand, exceptional opportunities of testing public employment offices. The municipal employment office established at Seattle in 1894 under an amendment of the city charter is among the oldest public offices in the United States. Tacoma established a municipal office in 1904, Spokane in 1905, and Everett in 1908.<ref>The first free public employment office in the United States was the municipal agency established in Cleveland in 1890. Then followed (in 1893) the Los Angeles office. Bulletin of United States Bureau of Labor No. 68, p. 1 (January 1907).</ref> The continuance and increase of these municipal offices indicate that their experience in public employment agencies was at least encouraging. And the low cost of operating them was extraordinary. In Spokane, the fees charged by private agencies ranged from $1 upward, and were usually about $2.<ref>Washington state Bureau of Labor Report 1913, 1914, p. 291. W. D. Wheaton, Labor Agent. \"The complaint against the private office is almost universal. The experience of this office is that private agencies charge all that the traffic will bear and that, in hard times, when work is scarce and the worker poverty-stricken, the fee is placed so high as to be almost prohibitive, and the agencies take longer chances, sometimes sending men on only a rumor, depending on their financial straits to make it impossible to return. The fees charged run from $1 for the poorest job of uncertain duration to as high as 10 percent of the first year's salary in educational lines, and 30 percent of the first month's salary in office or mercantile lines. Most of the agencies catering to the better class of positions charge a registration fee which is worked to the limit -- or rather, without limit. Advertisements for attractive positions are placed with the newspapers, and registration is made of all that apply, irrespective of whether the position has been filled or not, and generally at a fee of $2 or more. This registration fee is always followed by a percentage of the earnings when a position is secured, but only a small proportion of those registering are placed in positions. The average charge per position in all agencies will run high, and yet the applicant cannot have a feeling of security in the position obtained, for the reason that the great majority of private agencies are primarily interested in the fee, and are not as careful in placing applicants as they would be did the possibility of another fee not exist.\"</ref> In the Seattle free municipal agency, the cost of operation, per position filled, was reduced to a trifle over 4 cents.<ref>United States Bureau of Labor Bulletin No. 109, p. 136. \"The extremely low cost of each position filled is noteworthy, as is the large number of positions secured. A total of 37,834 positions were filled in 1906, and in 1909, 38,846. The cost per position was lowest in 1906, only 4.03 cents. Only twice since 1897 has the average cost gone above 6 cents.\"</ref> The preliminary steps for establishing \"Distribution Stations\" under the federal system, including one at Seattle, had been taken before the passage of the Washington law.<ref>See Report of Secretary of Labor, 1914, p. 51.</ref> Later, branch offices were established in thirteen other cities.<ref>Aberdeen, Bellingham, Custer, Everett, Friday Harbor, Lynden, Noosack, North Yakima, Port Angeles, Port Townsend, Spokane, Takoma, Walla Walla.

The fundamental problem\n\nThe problem which confronted the people of Washington was far more comprehensive and fundamental than that of protecting workers applying to the private agencies. It was the chronic problem of unemployment -- perhaps the gravest and most difficult problem of modern industry -- the problem which, owing to business depression, was the most acute in America during the years 1913 to 1915.<ref>The Unemployment Crisis of 1914, 1915, 5 American Labor Legislation Review, p. 475.</ref> In the State of Washington, the suffering from unemployment was accentuated by the lack of staple industries operating continuously throughout the year and by unusual fluctuations in the demand for labor, with consequent reduction of wages and increase of social unrest.<ref>Washington state Bureau of Labor Report, 1913, 1914, pp. 13, 16, 17. Unemployment Survey, 5 American Labor Legislation Review, 482, 483 (1915).</ref> Students of the larger problem of unemployment appear to agree that establishment of an adequate system of employment offices or labor exchanges<ref>Recent Advances in the Struggle against Unemployment, by Prof. Charles R. Henderson, 2 American Labor Legislation Review, 105, 106 (1911). \"The point of starting ameliorative effort is the employment agency or 'labor exchange.'\" \"When we compare the ordinary employment office with the board of trade for cotton or grain, or with the bankers' clearing house, we begin to realize how belated, rudimentary, and primitive our present labor exchange it. Yet the issues at stake are quite as vital in the case of demand and supply in the labor market as in the stock and grain exchange.\" A Problem of Industry, 4 American Labor Legislation Review, p. 211: \"The labor market is unorganized, resulting in confusion, waste, and loss to employers and employees. It means suffering to individual workers and their families, a lowering of the standard of living, impaired vitality and efficiency, and a tendency for the unemployed to become unemployable, dependent, degraded. In fact, the demoralizing effect of unemployment upon the individual is matched only by its wastefulness to society.\" The Prevention of Unemployment, 5 American Labor Legislation Review, p. 176: \"An essential step toward a solution of the problem of unemployment is the organization of the labor market through a connected network of public employment exchanges. This is vitally important as a matter of business organization, and not of philanthropy. It is of as much importance for the employer to find help rapidly and efficiently as it is for the worker to find work without delay. The necessity of organized markets is recognized in every other field of economic activity, but we have thus far taken only timid and halting steps in the organization of the labor market. The peddling method is still, even in our 'efficient' industrial system, the prevalent method of selling labor. Thus, a purely business transaction is carried on in a most unbusinesslike, not to say medieval, manner.\" Public Employment Bureaus, Charles B. Barnes, 5 American Labor Legislation Review, p. 195: \"Unemployment is no longer intermittent in this country; it has come to be a chronic condition which needs to be dealt with in a regular and systematic manner. The first step in properly dealing with this situation is the establishing of a series of cooperating public employment bureaus.\" The unemployed in Philadelphia, Department of Public Works (1915) p. 113.

There is reason to believe that the people of Washington not only considered the collection by the private employment offices of fees from employees a social injustice,<ref>Washington state Employment Agency Referendum, by W. M. Leiserson, 33 Survey, 87 (October 24, 1914): \"Anyone who knows the employment agency business and everyone who has tried earnestly to regulate private agencies will testify to the futility of regulation. But the inherent justice of the proposed Washington act can be shown in a better way. Ask the employment agent to whom he rendered the service, and he will answer 'to employer and to employee.' 'Then why don't you charge the employer?' 'It is impossible. If we depended upon employers for our fees, we would have to go out of business. They simply will not pay.' Every time this question is put to employment agents, the answer is the same: 'We charge the worker because we can get the fee from him and we cannot get it from the employer.' This is the downright wrong against which Washington Initiative No. 8 is directed.\"\n</ref> but that they considered the elimination of the practice a necessary preliminary to the establishment of a constructive policy for dealing with the subject of unemployment.<ref>General Discussion on Unemployment, 5 American Labor Legislation Review, p. 451; T. S. McMahon, Univ. of Washington. \"The people of the State of Washington are not indifferent to the problem of unemployment, nor do they show any tendency to offer charitable panaceas as a permanent remedy. They trying to work out some constructive policy, and as a preliminary step have made it illegal for employment offices to charge fees for jobs. A bill will be presented to the next legislature for the establishment of a network of public employment offices all over the state. This will make possible the complete organization of the labor market, which we hope is the first step toward the organization of industry itself. The aggressive attitude of the leaders among the workers has impressed upon the mind of the people the fact that the problem will have to be met in another way than by providing food and clothing for a period of distress such as we are passing through at the present time. I believe that this attitude on the part of the working people, which is characteristically western, will do more towards the solution of this problem than perhaps we, who discuss it in a theoretical way, can accomplish. They do have some plan of action, and some definite program. Either we shall have to work out some program of ultimate solution of unemployment or we will have to accept the solution they are offering us. The one they are offering us is socialism.\"</ref>\n\nIt is facts and considerations like these which may have led the people of Washington to prohibit the collection by employment agencies of fees from applicants for work. And weight should be given to the fact that the statute has been held constitutional by the Supreme Court of Washington and by the federal district court (three judges sitting) -- courts presumably familiar with the local conditions and needs.\n\nInsofar as protection of the applicant is a specific purpose of the statute, a precedent was furnished by the Act of Congress, December 21, 1898, 30 Stat. 755, 763 (considered in ''[[Patterson v. The Eudora]]'', 190 U. S. 169), which provides, among other things:\n\n{{quote|\n\"If any person shall demand or receive, either directly or indirectly, from any seaman or other person seeking employment as seaman, or from any person on his behalf, any remuneration whatever for providing him with employment, he shall for every such offense be liable to a penalty of not more than $100.\"\n}}\n\nInsofar as the statute may be regarded as a step in the effort to overcome industrial maladjustment and unemployment by shifting to the employer the payment of fees, if any, the action taken may be likened to that embodied in the Washington Workmen's Compensation Law (sustained in ''[[Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington]]'', 243 U. S. 219), whereby the financial burden of industrial accidents is required to be borne by the employers.\n\nAs was said in ''[[Holden v. Hardy]]'', 169 U. S. 366, 169 U. S. 387:\n\n{{quote|\n\"In view of the fact that, from the day Magna Charta was signed to the present moment, amendments to the structure of the law have been made with increasing frequency, it is impossible to suppose that they will not continue, and the law be forced to adapt itself to new conditions of society, and particularly to the new relations between employers and employees as they arise.\"\n}}\n\nIn my opinion, the judgment of the district court should be affirmed.}}\n\nMr Justice Holmes and Mr Justice Clarke concurred.\n\n==Importance==\n===International Labour Organization policy===\n{{see also|International Labour Organization}}\nProbably inspired by the dissenting judgments in this case, the [[International Labour Organization]]'s first ever Recommendation took on the views of Justice Brandeis. The Unemployment Recommendation, 1919 (No.1), Art. 1 called for each member to,\n\n{{quote|take measures to prohibit the establishment of employment agencies which charge fees or which carry on their business for profit. Where such agencies already exist, it is further recommended that they be permitted to operate only under government licenses, and that all practicable measures be taken to abolish such agencies as soon as possible.}}\n\nThe Unemployment Convention, 1919, Art. 2 instead required the alternative of,\n\n{{quote|a system of free public employment agencies under the control of a central authority. Committees, which shall include representatives of employers and workers, shall be appointed to advise on matters concerning the carrying on of these agencies.}}\n\nIn 1933 the [[Fee-Charging Employment Agencies Convention, 1933 (shelved)|Fee-Charging Employment Agencies Convention (No.34)]] formally called for abolition. The exception was if the agencies were licensed and a fee scale was agreed in advance. In 1949 a [[Fee-Charging Employment Agencies Convention (Revised), 1949|new revised Convention (No.96)]] was produced. This kept the same scheme, but secured an 'opt out' (Art.2) for members that did not wish to sign up. Agencies were an increasingly entrenched part of the labor market. The United States did not sign up to the Conventions. The latest Convention, the [[Private Employment Agencies Convention, 1997]] takes a much softer stance and calls merely for regulation.\n\n===Supreme Court policy===\nIn ''[[Ribnik v. McBride]]'', 277 U.S. 350 (1928), the Court struck down a similar New Jersey law attempting to regulate agencies, Justices Stone, Brandeis and Holmes dissenting. This is probably no longer good law.\n\nDoubt was placed on the leading dicta of ''Adams v. Tanner'' in ''[[Olsen v. State of Nebraska]]'', 313 U.S. 236 (1941), and ''[[Lincoln Union v. Northwestern Co.]]'', 335 U.S. 525, 535 (1949). In the latter, Mr Justice Black said that ''Adams v. Tanner'' was part of the \"constitutional philosophy\" that struck down [[minimum wage]]s and maximum working hours.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 244]]\n*''[[Olsen v.

On the contrary, such service is useful, commendable, and in great demand. (at 593)}}\n\n===Dissent===\n[[Justice Brandeis]] (with whom Justice Holmes, Clarke and McKenna dissented) laid out in his dissenting judgment why employment agency activities were a legitimate concern. He highlighted sources from US Labor Department giving examples of abuse, attempts in over thirty states to regulate and have free public agencies compete. He stated how all methods short of abolition had ultimately failed (601-9).\n\nIn this period, the practice of charging destitute workers upfront fees for finding work was widespread. People might give up their last pennies for the chance of work. Sometimes, agencies made no effort to place the worker, or the work would last a few days and the employer would then split the next fee with the agent to bring in fresh replacements. Justice Brandeis cited from a report to a 1912 Congress Committee.\n\n{{quote|[[File:Brandeisl.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brandeis J]]'s dissent was notable as one of the first attempts to rely on policy documents in support of a judicial decision.]]\nTo declare the statute of a state, enacted in the exercise of the police power, invalid under the Fourteenth Amendment is a matter of such seriousness that I state the reasons for my dissent from the opinion of the court. The statute of the State of Washington commonly known as the \"Abolishing Employment Offices Measure\" was proposed by Initiative Petition No. 8, filed July 3, 1914, and was adopted November 3, 1914, at the general election, 162,054 votes being cast for the measure and 144,544 against it. In terms, the act merely prohibits the taking of fees from those seeking employment.<ref>\"An Act to Prohibit the Collection of Fees for the Securing of Employment, or Furnishing Information Leading Thereto, and Fixing a Penalty for Violation Thereof.\"\n\n\"Be it enacted by the people of the State of Washington:\"\n\n\"Section 1. The welfare of the State of Washington depends on the welfare of its workers, and demands that they be protected from conditions that result in their being liable to imposition and extortion. The State of Washington therefore, exercising herein police and sovereign power, declares that the system of collecting fees from the workers for furnishing them with employment, or with information leading thereto, results frequently in their becoming the victims of imposition and extortion, and is therefore detrimental to the welfare of the state.\"\n\n\"Section 2. It shall be unlawful for any employment agent, his representative, or any other person to demand or receive either directly or indirectly from any person seeking employment, or from any person in his or her behalf, any remuneration or fee whatsoever for furnishing him or her with employment or with information leading thereto.\"\n\n\"Section 3. For each and every violation of any of the provisions of this act, the penalty shall be a fine or [of] not more than $100 and imprisonment for not more than thirty days.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court of Washington has twice passed upon the scope of the act, holding in ''[[Huntsworth v. Tanner]]'', 87 Wash. 670, that it is not applicable to teachers, and in ''[[State v. Rossman]]'', 93 Wash. 530, that it is applicable to stenographers and bookkeepers.</ref>\n\nPlaintiffs, who are proprietors of private employment agencies in the City of Spokane, assert that this statute, if enforced, would compel them to discontinue business, and would thus, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, deprive them of their liberty and property without due process of law. The act leaves the plaintiffs free to collect fees from employers, and it appears that private employment offices thus restricted are still carrying on business.<ref>See Report of the Washington Bureau of Labor (1915, 1916), pp. 120-121. \"The free agencies, we are pleased to be able to say, are growing in popularity, and while they do not advertise their business with the same thrift that the other fellows did, they are coming into general service. There are three services of this kind: the private agency that receives all compensation from employers, either by the month, year, or per the service rendered, the federal agency, and the municipal agency; these latter two have offices in the larger places, and are doing good work, and the service is free to both employee and the employer. In the smaller cities and towns, the federal is the prevailing agency, and the postmaster of the place is usually the local representative.\"</ref> But even if it should prove, as plaintiffs allege, that their business could not live without collecting fees from employees, that fact would not necessarily render the act invalid. Private employment agencies are a business properly subject to police regulation and control. ''[[Brazee v. Michigan]]'', 241 U. S. 340. And this Court has made it clear that a statute enacted to promote health, safety, morals, or the public welfare may be valid, although it will compel discontinuance of existing businesses in whole or in part. Statutes prohibiting the manufacture and sale of liquor present the most familiar example of such a prohibition. But where, as here, no question of interstate commerce is involved, this Court has sustained also statutes or municipal ordinances which compelled discontinuance of such business as (a) of manufacturing and selling oleomargarine, ''[[Powell v. Pennsylvania]]'', 127 U. S. 678; (b) of selling cigarettes, ''[[Austin v. Tennessee]]'', 179 U. S. 343; (c) of selling futures in grain or other commodities, ''[[Booth v. Illinois]]'', 184 U. S. 425; (d) of selling stocks on margin, ''[[Otis v. Parker]]'', 187 U. S. 606; (e) of keeping billiard halls, ''[[Murphy v. California]]'', 225 U. S. 623; (f) of selling trading stamps, ''[[Rast v. Van Deman & Lewis Co.]]'', 240 U. S. 342, 240 U. S. 368.\n\nThese cases show that the scope of the police power is not limited to regulation, as distinguished from prohibition. They show also that the power of the state exists equally whether the end sought to be attained is the promotion of health, safety, or morals or is the prevention of fraud or the prevention of general demoralization.\n\n{{quote|\n\"If the state thinks that an admitted evil cannot be prevented except by prohibiting a calling or transaction not in itself necessarily objectionable, the courts cannot interfere unless, in looking at the substance of the matter, they can see that it 'is a clear, unmistakable infringement of rights secured by the fundamental law.'\"\n}}\n\n''[[Otis v. Parker]]'', 187 U. S. 606, 187 U. S. 609; ''[[Booth v. Illinois]]'', 184 U. S. 425, 184 U. S. 429. Or, as it is so frequently expressed, the action of the legislature is final unless the measure adopted appears clearly to be arbitrary or unreasonable, or to have no real or substantial relation to the object sought to be attained. Whether a measure relating to the public welfare is arbitrary or unreasonable, whether it has no substantial relation to the end proposed, is obviously not to be determined by assumptions or by a priori reasoning. The judgment should be based upon a consideration of relevant facts, actual or possible -- ex facto jus oritur. That ancient rule must prevail in order that we may have a system of living law.\n\nIt is necessary to inquire, therefore: what was the evil which the people of Washington sought to correct? Why was the particular remedy embodied in the statute adopted? And, incidentally, what has been the experience, if any, of other states or countries in this connection? But these inquiries are entered upon not for the purpose of determining whether the remedy adopted was wise, or even for the purpose of determining what the facts actually were. The decision of such questions lies with the legislative branch of the government. ''[[Powell v. Pennsylvania]]'', 127 U. S. 678, 127 U. S. 685. The sole purpose of the inquiries is to enable this Court to decide whether, in view of the facts, actual or possible, the action of the State of Washington was so clearly arbitrary or so unreasonable that it could not be taken \"by a free government without a violation of fundamental rights.\" See ''[[McCray v. United States]]'', 195 U. S. 27, 195 U. S. 64.\n\n1. The Evils<ref>The evils incident to private employment agencies first arrested public attention in America about 1890. During the fifteen years preceding the enactment of the Washington law, there were repeated investigations, official and unofficial, and there was much discussion and experimentation. See Free Public Employment Offices in the United States; U.S. Bureau of Labor, Bulletin No. 68, p. 1; Statistics of Unemployment and the Work of Employment Offices, U.S. Bureau of Labor Bulletin 109, p. 5; Subject Index of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bulletin No. 174, pp. 85-87; Munro, Bibliography of Municipal government, pp. 379-381.</ref>\n\nThe evils with which the people of Washington were confronted arose partly from the abuses incident to the system of private employment agencies and partly from its inadequacy.\n\n(a) The Abuses.\n\nThese are summarized in a report published by the United States Bureau of Labor in October, 1912,<ref>United States Bureau of Labor Bulletin No. 109, p. 36.</ref> thus:\n\n{{quote|\n\"Private employment agencies, which charge a fee for their services, are found in every city of any size in the United States. The nature of their business is such as to make possible most iniquitous practices. Their patrons are frequently men and women with only a dollar or two, which they are eager to give up for the opportunity of earning more. They are often of small intelligence and easily duped. Stories of how these agencies have swindled and defrauded those who sought employment through them are heard universally. Some of the more common of the fraudulent methods said to be used by these agencies are the following:\"\n\n\"1. Charging a fee and failing to make any effort to find work for the applicant.\"\n\n\"2. Sending applicants where no work exists.\"\n\n\"3.

I, pp. 109-111. See also vol. II. pp. 1165-1440.</ref>\n\n{{quote|\n\"23. There are many private employment agents who try to conduct their business honestly, but they are the exception, rather than the rule. The business as a whole reeks with fraud, extortion, and flagrant abuses of every kind. The most common evils are as follows:\"\n\n\"Fees are often charged out of all proportion to the service rendered. We know of cases where $5, $9, $10, and even $16 apiece has been paid for jobs at common labor. In one city, the fees paid by scrubwomen is at the rate of $24 a year for their poorly paid work. Then there is discrimination in the charges made for the same jobs. Often, too, men are sent a long distance, made to pay fees and transportation, only to find that no one at that place ordered men from the employment agent. A most pernicious practice is the collusion with foremen or superintendents by which the employment agent 'splits fees' with them. That is, the foreman agrees to hire men of a certain employment agent on condition that one fourth or one half of every fee collected from men whom he hires be given to him. This leads the foreman to discharge men constantly in order to have more men hired through the agent and more fees collected. It develops the 'three-gang' method so universally complained of by railroad and construction laborers, namely, one gang working, another coming to work from the employment agent, and a third going back to the city.\"\n\n\"Finally, there is the most frequent abuse -- misrepresentation of terms and condition of employment. Men are told that they will get more wages than are actually paid, or that the work will last longer than it actually will, or that there is a boarding house when there really is an insanitary camp, or that the cost of transportation will be paid, when it is to be deducted from the wages. They are not told of other deductions that will be made from wages; they are not informed about strikes that may be on at the places to which they are sent, nor about other important facts which they ought to know. These misrepresentations, it must be said, are often as much the fault of the employer as of the labor agent. Also, the employer will place his call for help with several agents, and each will send enough to fill the whole order, causing many to find no jobs. Labor agents and laborers alike are guilty of the misuse of free transportation furnished by employers to prospective help. And it is true also that many applicants perpetrate frauds on the labor agents themselves -- as, for example, causing them to return fees when positions actually were secured. This is the result of the general feeling that the whole system of paying fees for jobs is unjust, and if they must pay in order to get work, then any attempt to get the fee back is justifiable.\"}}\n\n(b) The Inadequacy.\n\nBut the evils were not limited to what are commonly called abuses, like the fraud and extortion described above. Even the exemplary private offices charging fees to workers might prove harmful for the reason thus stated in the report to Congress of the United States Commission on Industrial Relations, cited supra.\n\n{{quote|\n\"18... . Investigations show, however, that, instead of relieving unemployment and reducing irregularity, these employment agencies actually serve to congest the labor market and to increase idleness and irregularity of employment. They are interested primarily in the fees they can earn, and if they can earn more by bringing workers to an already overcrowded city, they do so. Again, it is an almost universal custom among private employment agents to fill vacancies by putting in them people who are working at other places. In this way, new vacancies are created, and more fees can be earned.\"\n\n\"19. They also fail to meet the problem because they are so numerous and are necessarily competitive. With few exceptions, there is no cooperation among them. This difficulty is further emphasized by the necessity of paying the registration fees required by many agencies; obviously the laborer cannot apply to very many if he has to pay a dollar at each one.\"\n\n\"20. The fees which private employment offices must charge are barriers which prevent the proper flow of labor into the channels where it is needed, and are a direct influence in keeping men idle. In the summer, when employment is plentiful, the fees are as low as 25 cents, and men are even referred to work free of charge. But this must necessarily be made up in the winter, when work is scarce. At such times, when men need work most badly, the private employment offices put up their fees and keep the unemployed from going to work until they can pay $2, $3, $5, and even $10 and more for their jobs. This necessity of paying for the privilege of going to work, and paying more the more urgently the job is needed, not only keeps people unnecessarily unemployed, but seems foreign to the spirit of American freedom and opportunity.\"\n\n\"21. An additional injustice inevitably connected with labor agencies which charge fees is that they must place the entire cost of the service upon those least able to bear it. Employment agents say that employers will not pay the fees; hence they must charge the employees. Among the wage earners, too, however, those who are least in need and can wait for work pay the least for jobs and even get them free, while those who are most in need make up for all the rest and pay the highest fees. The weakest and poorest classes of wage earners are therefore made to pay the largest share for a service rendered to employers, to workers, and to the public as well.\"\n}}\n\n2. The Remedies\n\nDuring the fifteen years preceding 1914, there had been extensive experimentation in the regulation of private employment agencies. Twenty-four states had attempted direct regulation under statutes, often supplemented by municipal ordinances.<ref>\"It is not necessary here to enter into the relative merits of governmental regulation and governmental operation. Suffice it to say that twenty-four states and the District of Columbia have attempted to regulate private employment agencies, and have made a miserable failure of it. The business lends itself easily to fraud and imposition, and it is far more true of the private agencies than of the public offices that they have been frauds as well as failures.\" Public Employment Offices -- W. M. Leiserson, 29 Political Science Quarterly (March 1914), p. 36. \"The United States possesses at the present time no adequate system, either state or national, for the regulation of private employment agencies, either from the point of view of the content of the laws, affording regulations of the business and restrictions as to how the business shall be carried on, or as to proper methods of enforcement.\" Labor Laws and Their Enforcement, edited by Susan M. Kingsbury (Boston, 1911) p. 366. See Chapter VI of this work for a study of the regulation of private employment agencies by Mabelle Moses. See also Chapter 663, Laws of 1913, State of Wisconsin.</ref> Nineteen states had attempted indirect regulation through the competition of state offices, and seven others through competition of municipal offices.<ref>Proceedings of the Association of Public Employment Offices (September 25, 1914), U.S. Dep. of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bulletin 192, p. 61.</ref> Other experiments in indirect regulation through competition petition were made by voluntary organizations, philanthropic, social, and industrial.<ref>Unemployment and Work of Employment Offices, Bulletin of U.S. Bureau of Labor No. 109, pp. 5, 37 (October, 1912).</ref> The results of those experiments were unsatisfactory. The abuses continued in large measure, and the private offices survived to a great extent the competition of the free agencies, public and private. There gradually developed a conviction that the evils of private agencies were inherent and ineradicable so long as they were permitted to charge fees to the workers seeking employment. And many believed that such charges were the root of the evil.\n\nOn September 25, 1914, the American Association of Public Employment Offices adopted at its annual meeting the following resolutions:\n\n{{quote|\n\"Resolved, That this association go on record as favoring the elimination as soon as possible, of all private employment agencies operating for a profit within the United States, and that it recommends to the consideration of the United States Commission on Industrial Relations and Congress and the various state legislatures legislation having this end in view.\"\n}}\n\nThe United States Commission on Industrial Relations declared in its report to Congress:<ref>Made in August 1915, and cited supra, Note 4 Between 1914 and this date, six states had legislated on the subject. See Unemployment Survey, 1914, 1915. 5 American Labor Legislation Review, p. 560.</ref>\n\n{{quote|\n\"24. Attempts to remove these abuses by regulation have been made in thirty-one states, but, with few exceptions, they have proved futile, and at most they have served only to promote a higher standard of honesty in the business, and have not removed the other abuses which are inherent in the system. Where the states and cities have spent much money for inspectors and complaint adjusters, there has been considerable improvement in the methods of private employment agencies, but most of the officers in charge of this regulation testify that the abuses are in 'the nature of the business,' and never can be entirely eliminated. They therefore favor the total abolition of private labor agencies. This is also the common opinion among working people, and in the several states, attempts have already been made to accomplish this by law.\"\n}}\n\nBut the remedies proposed were not limited to the suppression of private offices charging fees to workers and the extension of the system of state and municipal offices. The conviction became widespread that, for the solution of the larger problem of unemployment, the aid of the federal government and the utilization and development of its extensive machinery was indispensable. During the seven years preceding 1914, a beginning had been made in this respect. The Immigration Act of February 20, 1907, c. 1134, 34 Stat. 898, 909, created within the Bureau of Immigration and Naturalization a Division of Information, charged with the duty of promoting \"a beneficial distribution of aliens.\" The services rendered by this division included, among others, some commonly performed by employment agencies. While it undertook to place in positions of employment only aliens, its operations were national in scope. The Act of March 4, 1913, creating the Department of Labor, resulted in a transfer of the Bureau of Immigration, including the Division of Information, to that department (37 Stat. 736). By this transfer, the scope of the division's work was enlarged to correspond with the broad powers of the Labor Department. These were declared by Congress to be:\n\n{{quote|\n\"to foster, promote and develop the welfare of the wage earners of the United States, to improve their working conditions, and to advance their opportunities for profitable employment.\"\n}}\n\nThen its efforts \"to distribute\" (that is, both to supply and to find places for) labor were extended to include citizens as well as aliens, and much was done to develop the machinery necessary for such distribution. In the summer of 1914, and in part before the filing in the State of Washington of the proposal for legislation here in question, action had been taken by the Department of Labor which attracted public attention. It undertook to supply harvest hands needed in the Middle West, and also to find work for the factory hands thrown out of employment by the great fire at Salem, Massachusetts, June 25, 1914.<ref>The fire was so extensive that the Congress appropriated $200,000 for relief of all sufferers. Act of August 1, 1914, c. 223, 38 Stat. 681.</ref> The division was strengthened by cooperation with other departments of the federal government (Agriculture, Interior, Commerce, and the Post office, with its 60,000 local offices) and with state and municipal employment offices. As early as June 13, 1914, the United States Department of Labor had also sought the cooperation in this work of all the leading newspapers in America, including those printed in foreign languages.<ref>Annual Report of the Secretary of Labor, 1914, pp. 48-55; Monthly Review of the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, July 1915, p. 8; see also Annual Report of the Secretary of Labor, 1915, p. 36; \"Interdepartmental cooperation. -- Through the cooperation of the Post Office Department it became possible to bring to the aid of this labor-distribution service some 60,000 post offices, and thereby to create a network of communication between employers needing help without knowing where to get it and workers wanting employment without knowing where to find it. Either employer or workman may obtain at any post office in the United States a blank application supplied by this department, which, after filling out and signing it, he may deposit in the mails anywhere, free of postage... . Employment bulletins. -- The bulletins contain a statement of unmatched applications, no matter what part of the country they may come from. It is not expected, of course, that applications for work of a minor character will ordinarily be matched by applications for workers of that kind from distant stations. It is assumed, however, that bulletined applications may possibly be matched through the cooperation of nearby stations within a reasonable radius. The bulletins are also systematically sent to such newspapers as have indicated their desire to receive them for possible publication as news matter of interest to their respective readers.\"</ref>\n\n3. Conditions in the State of Washington\n\nThe peculiar needs of Washington emphasized the defects of the system of private employment offices.\n\n(a) The Evils.\n\nThe conditions generally prevailing are described in a report recently published by the United States Department of Labor, thus:<ref>Labor Laws and their Administration in the Pacific States. United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Bulletin No. 211 (1917), pp. 17, 18.</ref>\n\n{{quote|\n\"In no part of the United States, perhaps, is there so large a field for employment offices as in the Pacific states. As has been noted, industrial conditions there favor inconstancy of employment. Much of the business activity is based upon the casual, short-time job. This in itself means the frequent shifting of workers from place to place. And the shifting is the more difficult as much of the work offered is in more or less remote districts of the country... .\"\n\n\"The necessity laid upon so many workers of constantly seeking new jobs opens a peculiarly fertile field for their exploitation by unscrupulous private employment agencies. There is much testimony to the fact and frequency of such exploitation. The most striking evidence of this is that, in the State of Washington, private agencies made themselves so generally distrusted that, in 1915, their complete abolition was ordered by popular vote... .\"\n\n\"Prior to 1914, there was practically no legislation regarding private employment agencies, and there had been no attempt at state supervision of their conduct. But distrust of such agencies was constantly increasing, and culminated in the year mentioned in the passage by popular initiative of an act aiming at the total suppression of all private employment agencies of the commercial type.\"\n}}\n\nThe reports of the Washington State Bureau of Labor give this description:\n\n{{quote|\n\"The investigations of the Bureau show that the worst labor conditions in the state are to be found on highway and railroad construction work, and these are largely because the men are sent long distances by the employment agencies, are housed and fed poorly at the camps, and are paid on an average of $1.75 to $2.25 a day, out of which they are compelled to pay $5.50 to $7 per week for board, generally a hospital fee of some kind, always a fee to the employment agency, and their transportation to the point where the work is being done. The consequence is that they usually have but little money left when the work is finished, and if, as frequently happens, they work only a week or two and are then discharged, they are in as bad a situation as they were before they went to work, and sometimes worse, if they do not have enough money to get back to the place from which they started.<ref>Washington State Bureau of Labor, Report 1913, 1914, pp. 27, 28.</ref>\"\n\n\"That the honest toiler was their victim there is no question: not alone of a stiff fee for the information given, but a systematic method was adopted in order to keep the business going. Managers of agencies and managers of jobs, their superintendents, foremen, or subforemen were in this scheme for fleecing the workingman. Men in large numbers would be sent to contract jobs, and if on the railroads, 'free fare' was part of the inducement, or perhaps the agency would charge a nominal fee if the distance was great, and this, too, would become a perquisite of the bureau, to finally go through the clearing house. In many cases, men would be unsatisfactory -- at least they would be told so, discharged in a few days, and sent adrift as poor, may be poorer, than when they came there. New men would have to be secured, and thus the thing would go on revolving. So it went until at last it became so obnoxious that the public indignation was at length aroused, resulting in the passing of a law doing away with them.<ref>Washington state Bureau of Labor, Report 1915, 1916, p. 120.\n</ref>\"\n}}\n\nThe abuses and the inadequacy of the then existing system are also described by state officials in affidavits included in the record.\n\n(b) The Remedies.\n\nWashington had not tried direct regulation of private employment offices, but that method was being considered as late as 1912.<ref>Washington state Bureau of Labor, 1911-1912. Report of Commissioner, p. 16: \"It has been demonstrated that state control of employment agencies is the most effective way to properly regulate them. I would earnestly recommend a state law similar to the one in Illinois that went into effect July 1, 1911, and has proven to be the best law for this purpose in this country.\"</ref> Its people had had, on the other hand, exceptional opportunities of testing public employment offices. The municipal employment office established at Seattle in 1894 under an amendment of the city charter is among the oldest public offices in the United States. Tacoma established a municipal office in 1904, Spokane in 1905, and Everett in 1908.<ref>The first free public employment office in the United States was the municipal agency established in Cleveland in 1890. Then followed (in 1893) the Los Angeles office. Bulletin of United States Bureau of Labor No. 68, p. 1 (January 1907).</ref> The continuance and increase of these municipal offices indicate that their experience in public employment agencies was at least encouraging. And the low cost of operating them was extraordinary. In Spokane, the fees charged by private agencies ranged from $1 upward, and were usually about $2.<ref>Washington state Bureau of Labor Report 1913, 1914, p. 291. W. D. Wheaton, Labor Agent. \"The complaint against the private office is almost universal. The experience of this office is that private agencies charge all that the traffic will bear and that, in hard times, when work is scarce and the worker poverty-stricken, the fee is placed so high as to be almost prohibitive, and the agencies take longer chances, sometimes sending men on only a rumor, depending on their financial straits to make it impossible to return. The fees charged run from $1 for the poorest job of uncertain duration to as high as 10 percent of the first year's salary in educational lines, and 30 percent of the first month's salary in office or mercantile lines. Most of the agencies catering to the better class of positions charge a registration fee which is worked to the limit -- or rather, without limit. Advertisements for attractive positions are placed with the newspapers, and registration is made of all that apply, irrespective of whether the position has been filled or not, and generally at a fee of $2 or more. This registration fee is always followed by a percentage of the earnings when a position is secured, but only a small proportion of those registering are placed in positions. The average charge per position in all agencies will run high, and yet the applicant cannot have a feeling of security in the position obtained, for the reason that the great majority of private agencies are primarily interested in the fee, and are not as careful in placing applicants as they would be did the possibility of another fee not exist.\"</ref> In the Seattle free municipal agency, the cost of operation, per position filed, was reduced to a trifle over 4 cents.<ref>United States Bureau of Labor Bulletin No. 109, p. 136. \"The extremely low cost of each position filled is noteworthy, as is the large number of positions secured. A total of 37,834 positions were filled in 1906, and in 1909, 38,846. The cost per position was lowest in 1906, only 4.03 cents. Only twice since 1897 has the average cost gone above 6 cents.\"</ref> The preliminary steps for establishing \"Distribution Stations\" under the federal system, including one at Seattle, had been taken before the passage of the Washington law.<ref>See Report of Secretary of Labor, 1914, p. 51.</ref> Later, branch offices were established in thirteen other cities.<ref>Aberdeen, Bellingham, Custer, Everett, Friday Harbor, Lynden, Noosack, North Yakima, Port Angeles, Port Townsend, Spokane, Takoma, Walla Walla.

The fundamental problem\n\nThe problem which confronted the people of Washington was far more comprehensive and fundamental than that of protecting workers applying to the private agencies. It was the chronic problem of unemployment -- perhaps the gravest and most difficult problem of modern industry -- the problem which, owing to business depression, was the most acute in America during the years 1913 to 1915.<ref>The Unemployment Crisis of 1914, 1915, 5 American Labor Legislation Review, p. 475.</ref> In the State of Washington, the suffering from unemployment was accentuated by the lack of staple industries operating continuously throughout the year and by unusual fluctuations in the demand for labor, with consequent reduction of wages and increase of social unrest.<ref>Washington state Bureau of Labor Report, 1913, 1914, pp. 13, 16, 17. Unemployment Survey, 5 American Labor Legislation Review, 482, 483 (1915).</ref> Students of the larger problem of unemployment appear to agree that establishment of an adequate system of employment offices or labor exchanges<ref>Recent Advances in the Struggle against Unemployment, by Prof. Charles R. Henderson, 2 American Labor Legislation Review, 105, 106 (1911). \"The point of starting ameliorative effort is the employment agency or 'labor exchange.'\" \"When we compare the ordinary employment office with the board of trade for cotton or grain, or with the bankers' clearing house, we begin to realize how belated, rudimentary, and primitive our present labor exchange it. Yet the issues at stake are quite as vital in the case of demand and supply in the labor market as in the stock and grain exchange.\" A Problem of Industry, 4 American Labor Legislation Review, p. 211: \"The labor market is unorganized, resulting in confusion, waste, and loss to employers and employees. It means suffering to individual workers and their families, a lowering of the standard of living, impaired vitality and efficiency, and a tendency for the unemployed to become unemployable, dependent, degraded. In fact, the demoralizing effect of unemployment upon the individual is matched only by its wastefulness to society.\" The Prevention of Unemployment, 5 American Labor Legislation Review, p. 176: \"An essential step toward a solution of the problem of unemployment is the organization of the labor market through a connected network of public employment exchanges. This is vitally important as a matter of business organization, and not of philanthropy. It is of as much importance for the employer to find help rapidly and efficiently as it is for the worker to find work without delay. The necessity of organized markets is recognized in every other field of economic activity, but we have thus far taken only timid and halting steps in the organization of the labor market. The peddling method is still, even in our 'efficient' industrial system, the prevalent method of selling labor. Thus, a purely business transaction is carried on in a most unbusinesslike, not to say medieval, manner.\" Public Employment Bureaus, Charles B. Barnes, 5 American Labor Legislation Review, p. 195: \"Unemployment is no longer intermittent in this country; it has come to be a chronic condition which needs to be dealt with in a regular and systematic manner.

There is reason to believe that the people of Washington not only considered the collection by the private employment offices of fees from employees a social injustice,<ref>Washington state Employment Agency Referendum, by W. M. Leiserson, 33 Survey, 87 (October 24, 1914): \"Anyone who knows the employment agency business and everyone who has tried earnestly to regulate private agencies will testify to the futility of regulation. But the inherent justice of the proposed Washington act can be shown in a better way. Ask the employment agent to whom he rendered the service, and he will answer 'to employer and to employee.' 'Then why don't you charge the employer?' 'It is impossible. If we depended upon employers for our fees, we would have to go out of business. They simply will not pay.' Every time this question is put to employment agents, the answer is the same: 'We charge the worker because we can get the fee from him and we cannot get it from the employer.' This is the downright wrong against which Washington Initiative No. 8 is directed.\"\n</ref> but that they considered the elimination of the practice a necessary preliminary to the establishment of a constructive policy for dealing with the subject of unemployment.<ref>General Discussion on Unemployment, 5 American Labor Legislation Review, p. 451; T. S. McMahon, Univ. of Washington. \"The people of the State of Washington are not indifferent to the problem of unemployment, nor do they show any tendency to offer charitable panaceas as a permanent remedy. They trying to work out some constructive policy, and as a preliminary step have made it illegal for employment offices to charge fees for jobs. A bill will be presented to the next legislature for the establishment of a network of public employment offices all over the state. This will make possible the complete organization of the labor market, which we hope is the first step toward the organization of industry itself. The aggressive attitude of the leaders among the workers has impressed upon the mind of the people the fact that the problem will have to be met in another way than by providing food and clothing for a period of distress such as we are passing through at the present time. I believe that this attitude on the part of the working people, which is characteristically western, will do more towards the solution of this problem than perhaps we, who discuss it in a theoretical way, can accomplish. They do have some plan of action, and some definite program. Either we shall have to work out some program of ultimate solution of unemployment or we will have to accept the solution they are offering us. The one they are offering us is socialism.\"</ref>\n\nIt is facts and considerations like these which may have led the people of Washington to prohibit the collection by employment agencies of fees from applicants for work. And weight should be given to the fact that the statute has been held constitutional by the Supreme Court of Washington and by the federal district court (three judges sitting) -- courts presumably familiar with the local conditions and needs.\n\nInsofar as protection of the applicant is a specific purpose of the statute, a precedent was furnished by the Act of Congress, December 21, 1898, 30 Stat. 755, 763 (considered in ''[[Patterson v. The Eudora]]'', 190 U. S. 169), which provides, among other things:\n\n{{quote|\n\"If any person shall demand or receive, either directly or indirectly, from any seaman or other person seeking employment as seaman, or from any person on his behalf, any remuneration whatever for providing him with employment, he shall for every such offense be liable to a penalty of not more than $100.\"\n}}\n\nInsofar as the statute may be regarded as a step in the effort to overcome industrial maladjustment and unemployment by shifting to the employer the payment of fees, if any, the action taken may be likened to that embodied in the Washington Workmen's Compensation Law (sustained in ''[[Mountain Timber Co. v. Washington]]'', 243 U. S. 219), whereby the financial burden of industrial accidents is required to be borne by the employers.\n\nAs was said in ''[[Holden v. Hardy]]'', 169 U. S. 366, 169 U. S. 387:\n\n{{quote|\n\"In view of the fact that, from the day Magna Charta was signed to the present moment, amendments to the structure of the law have been made with increasing frequency, it is impossible to suppose that they will not continue, and the law be forced to adapt itself to new conditions of society, and particularly to the new relations between employers and employees as they arise.\"\n}}\n\nIn my opinion, the judgment of the district court should be affirmed.}}\n\nMr Justice Holmes and Mr Justice Clarke concurred.\n\n==Importance==\n===International Labour Organization policy===\n{{see also|International Labour Organization}}\nProbably inspired by the dissenting judgments in this case, the [[International Labour Organization]]'s first ever Recommendation took on the views of Justice Brandeis. The Unemployment Recommendation, 1919 (No.1), Art. 1 called for each member to,\n\n{{quote|take measures to prohibit the establishment of employment agencies which charge fees or which carry on their business for profit. Where such agencies already exist, it is further recommended that they be permitted to operate only under government licenses, and that all practicable measures be taken to abolish such agencies as soon as possible.}}\n\nThe Unemployment Convention, 1919, Art. 2 instead required the alternative of,\n\n{{quote|a system of free public employment agencies under the control of a central authority. Committees, which shall include representatives of employers and workers, shall be appointed to advise on matters concerning the carrying on of these agencies.}}\n\nIn 1933 the [[Fee-Charging Employment Agencies Convention, 1933 (shelved)|Fee-Charging Employment Agencies Convention (No.34)]] formally called for abolition. The exception was if the agencies were licensed and a fee scale was agreed in advance. In 1949 a [[Fee-Charging Employment Agencies Convention (Revised), 1949|new revised Convention (No.96)]] was produced. This kept the same scheme, but secured an 'opt out' (Art.2) for members that did not wish to sign up. Agencies were an increasingly entrenched part of the labor market. The United States did not sign up to the Conventions. The latest Convention, the [[Private Employment Agencies Convention, 1997]] takes a much softer stance and calls merely for regulation.\n\n===Supreme Court policy===\nIn ''[[Ribnik v. McBride]]'', 277 U.S. 350 (1928), the Court struck down a similar New Jersey law attempting to regulate agencies, Justices Stone, Brandeis and Holmes dissenting. This is probably no longer good law.\n\nDoubt was placed on the leading dicta of ''Adams v. Tanner'' in ''[[Olsen v. State of Nebraska]]'', 313 U.S. 236 (1941), and ''[[Lincoln Union v. Northwestern Co.]]'', 335 U.S. 525, 535 (1949). In the latter, Mr Justice Black said that ''Adams v.

It is distinct from another Deep Dale, near [[Sheldon, Derbyshire|Sheldon]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} to the east.\n\nThe dale is cut into a plateau of farmland and lies just south west of the hamlet of [[King Sterndale]]. The head of the valley is called Back Dale and there is a side valley called Horseshoe Dale. Wye Dale is at the foot of the valley to the north. The valley is dry over the summer but has a [[Winterbourne (stream)|winterbourne stream]], fed by the Deepdale Side Resurgence spring and another spring by Thirst House Cave further up the valley. The stream runs into the [[River Wye, Derbyshire|River Wye]].<ref name=\"OS2\">[[Ordnance Survey|OS]] ''Explorer'' map OL24W, 1:25,000 series.</ref>\n\nThirst House Cave's name is derived from Th'Hurst House as it was earlier called Hob Hurst House, named after a goblin believed to live in the cave (not to be confused with Hob Hurst's House prehistoric burial mound on Beeley Moor).

It is distinct from another Deep Dale, near [[Sheldon, Derbyshire|Sheldon]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} to the east.\n\nThe dale is cut into a plateau of farmland and lies just south west of the hamlet of [[King Sterndale]]. The head of the valley is called Back Dale and there is a side valley called Horseshoe Dale. Wye Dale is at the foot of the valley to the north. The valley is dry over the summer but has a [[Winterbourne (stream)|winterbourne stream]], fed by the Deepdale Side Resurgence spring and another spring by Thirst House Cave further up the valley. The stream runs into the [[River Wye, Derbyshire|River Wye]].<ref name=\"OS2\">[[Ordnance Survey|OS]] ''Explorer'' map OL24W, 1:25,000 series.</ref>\n\nThirst House Cave's name is derived from Th'Hurst House as it was earlier called Hob Hurst House, named after a goblin believed to live in the cave (not to be confused with Hob Hurst's House prehistoric burial mound on Beeley Moor).
