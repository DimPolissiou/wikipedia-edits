Afterwards, many additional settlements, located in other archaeological sites, were identified as Ghassulian settlements. All these settlements had been built in areas that had not been previously inhabited, mainly on the outskirts of populated areas. Thus, Chalcolithic settlements have been discovered in the [[Jordan Rift Valley]], in the [[Israeli coastal plain]] and on its fringes, in the [[Judaean Desert]] and in the northern and western [[Negev]]. On the other hand, it seems that people of the Chalcolithic period did not settle in the mountainous regions of Israel or in northern Israel. Several facts allow us to assume that the carriers of this culture were immigrants who had brought their own culture with them: all excavated sites represent an advanced stage of this culture, whereas no evidence of its nascent stages has been discovered, so far, anywhere in the region.

born 15 September 1942) is a Zimbabwean revolutionary and politician who has served as [[President of Zimbabwe]] since 24 November 2017. A member of [[ZANU\u2013PF]] and a longtime ally of former President [[Robert Mugabe]], he held a series of Cabinet portfolios and was Mugabe's [[Vice-President of Zimbabwe|Vice-President]] until November 2017, when he was dismissed before coming to power in [[2017 Zimbabwean coup d'\u00e9tat|a coup d'\u00e9tat]]. He was inaugurated as President in August 2018 following the [[2018 Zimbabwean general election|2018 general election]].\n\nMnangagwa was born in 1942 in [[Zvishavane|Shabani]], [[Southern Rhodesia]], to a large [[Shona people|Shona]] family. His parents were farmers, and in the 1950s he and his family were forced to move to [[Northern Rhodesia]] because of his father's political activism. There, he became active in anti-colonial politics, and in 1963, he joined the newly-formed [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]], the militant wing of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU). He returned to Rhodesia in 1964 as leader of a group called the \"Crocodile Gang\", which attacked white-owned farms in the [[Eastern Highlands]]. In 1965, he bombed a train near Fort Victoria (now [[Masvingo]]) and was imprisoned for ten years, after which he was released and deported to the recently independent [[Zambia]]. He studied law at the [[University of Zambia]], and practiced as an attorney for two years before going to [[Portuguese Mozambique]] to rejoin ZANU. There he was assigned to be [[Robert Mugabe]]'s assistant and bodyguard, and accompanied him to the [[Lancaster House Agreement]], which resulted in the recognised independence of [[Zimbabwe]] in 1980.\n\nAfter independence, Mnangagwa held a series of senior cabinet positions under Mugabe. From 1980 to 1988, he was the country's first [[Minister of State for National Security in the President's Office (Zimbabwe)|Minister of State Security]], and oversaw the [[Central Intelligence Organisation]]. His role in the ''[[Gukurahundi]]'' massacres, in which thousands of [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] civilians were killed and which occurred during his tenure, is controversial. Mnangagwa was [[Ministry of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs|Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs]] from 1989 to 2000 and then served as [[List of Speakers of the House of Assembly of Zimbabwe|Speaker of the Parliament]] from 2000 until 2005, when he was demoted to [[Ministry of National Housing and Social Amenities (Zimbabwe)|Minister of Rural Housing]] for openly jockeying to succeed the aging Mugabe. He returned to favour during the [[2008 Zimbabwean general election|2008 general election]], in which he ran Mugabe's campaign, orchestrating political violence against the opposition [[Movement for Democratic Change \u2013 Tsvangirai]]. Mnangagwa served as [[Ministry of Defence (Zimbabwe)|Minister of Defence]] from 2009 until 2013, when he became justice minister again. He was also appointed First Vice-President in 2014 and was widely considered to be a leading candidate to succeed Mugabe.\n\nMnangagwa's ascendancy was opposed by the President's wife, [[Grace Mugabe]], and her [[Generation 40]] political faction. He was dismissed from his positions by Mugabe in November 2017, and fled to [[South Africa]]. Soon after, General [[Constantino Chiwenga]], backed by elements of the [[Zimbabwe Defence Forces]] and members of Mnangagwa's [[Lacoste (political faction)|Lacoste]] political faction, launched a [[2017 Zimbabwean coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]]. After losing the support of ZANU\u2013PF, Mugabe resigned, and Mnangagwa returned to Zimbabwe to assume the presidency. He secured his first full term as President in the July 2018 election with 50.8% of the vote.\n\nMnangagwa is nicknamed \"{{lang|sn|Garwe}}\" or \"{{lang|sn|Ngwena}}\", which means \"the crocodile\" in the [[Shona language]],<ref name=\"Bearak, 2017\" /><ref name=\"ShonaDict\" /> initially because that was the name of the guerrilla group he founded, but later because of his political shrewdness. The faction within ZANU\u2013PF that supports him is called [[Lacoste (political faction)|Lacoste]] after [[Lacoste|the French clothing company whose logo is a crocodile]].<ref>{{Cite

of America).ogg|listen|help=no}}); born 15 September 1942) is a Zimbabwean revolutionary and politician who has served as [[President of Zimbabwe]] since 24 November 2017. A member of [[ZANU\u2013PF]] and a longtime ally of former President [[Robert Mugabe]], he held a series of Cabinet portfolios and was Mugabe's [[Vice-President of Zimbabwe|Vice-President]] until November 2017, when he was dismissed before coming to power in [[2017 Zimbabwean coup d'\u00e9tat|a coup d'\u00e9tat]]. He was inaugurated as President in August 2018 following the [[2018 Zimbabwean general election|2018 general election]].\n\nMnangagwa was born in 1942 in [[Zvishavane|Shabani]], [[Southern Rhodesia]], to a large [[Shona people|Shona]] family. His parents were farmers, and in the 1950s he and his family were forced to move to [[Northern Rhodesia]] because of his father's political activism. There, he became active in anti-colonial politics, and in 1963, he joined the newly-formed [[Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army]], the militant wing of the [[Zimbabwe African National Union]] (ZANU). He returned to Rhodesia in 1964 as leader of a group called the \"Crocodile Gang\", which attacked white-owned farms in the [[Eastern Highlands]]. In 1965, he bombed a train near Fort Victoria (now [[Masvingo]]) and was imprisoned for ten years, after which he was released and deported to the recently independent [[Zambia]]. He studied law at the [[University of Zambia]], and practiced as an attorney for two years before going to [[Portuguese Mozambique]] to rejoin ZANU. There he was assigned to be [[Robert Mugabe]]'s assistant and bodyguard, and accompanied him to the [[Lancaster House Agreement]], which resulted in the recognised independence of [[Zimbabwe]] in 1980.\n\nAfter independence, Mnangagwa held a series of senior cabinet positions under Mugabe. From 1980 to 1988, he was the country's first [[Minister of State for National Security in the President's Office (Zimbabwe)|Minister of State Security]], and oversaw the [[Central Intelligence Organisation]]. His role in the ''[[Gukurahundi]]'' massacres, in which thousands of [[Northern Ndebele people|Ndebele]] civilians were killed and which occurred during his tenure, is controversial. Mnangagwa was [[Ministry of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs|Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs]] from 1989 to 2000 and then served as [[List of Speakers of the House of Assembly of Zimbabwe|Speaker of the Parliament]] from 2000 until 2005, when he was demoted to [[Ministry of National Housing and Social Amenities (Zimbabwe)|Minister of Rural Housing]] for openly jockeying to succeed the aging Mugabe. He returned to favour during the [[2008 Zimbabwean general election|2008 general election]], in which he ran Mugabe's campaign, orchestrating political violence against the opposition [[Movement for Democratic Change \u2013 Tsvangirai]]. Mnangagwa served as [[Ministry of Defence (Zimbabwe)|Minister of Defence]] from 2009 until 2013, when he became justice minister again. He was also appointed First Vice-President in 2014 and was widely considered to be a leading candidate to succeed Mugabe.\n\nMnangagwa's ascendancy was opposed by the President's wife, [[Grace Mugabe]], and her [[Generation 40]] political faction. He was dismissed from his positions by Mugabe in November 2017, and fled to [[South Africa]]. Soon after, General [[Constantino Chiwenga]], backed by elements of the [[Zimbabwe Defence Forces]] and members of Mnangagwa's [[Lacoste (political faction)|Lacoste]] political faction, launched a [[2017 Zimbabwean coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]]. After losing the support of ZANU\u2013PF, Mugabe resigned, and Mnangagwa returned to Zimbabwe to assume the presidency. He secured his first full term as President in the July 2018 election with 50.8% of the vote.\n\nMnangagwa is nicknamed \"{{lang|sn|Garwe}}\" or \"{{lang|sn|Ngwena}}\", which means \"the crocodile\" in the [[Shona language]],<ref name=\"Bearak, 2017\" /><ref name=\"ShonaDict\" /> initially because that was the name of the guerrilla group he founded, but later because of his political shrewdness. The faction within ZANU\u2013PF that supports him is called [[Lacoste (political faction)|Lacoste]] after [[Lacoste|the French clothing company whose logo is a crocodile]].<ref>{{Cite

The most common videos feature unintentional [[physical comedy]], pets or children and some staged [[practical joke|prank]]s. Originally airing as a [[television special|special]] in 1989, it later debuted as a regular weekly series in 1990. The show was hosted by [[Bob Saget]] for the 1989 special and the first eight seasons of the series incarnation. After Saget's retirement from hosting in 1997, [[John Fugelsang]] and [[Daisy Fuentes]] later took over as co-host for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials, hosted by various actors and comedians such as [[D.L. Hughley]] and [[Richard Kind]], ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in 2001 with new host [[Tom Bergeron]], who has since become the series' longest-serving host, hosting 15 seasons. Bergeron announced in 2014 that he would be leaving as host of the show, and [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] took over as host in 2015. On October 29, 2018, ABC renewed ''AFV'' for two more seasons, bringing to its 30th (which premiered on Sunday, September 29, 2019) and 31st seasons.\n\n==Premise==\nAFV is based on the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] program ''[[Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan]],'' which featured a segment in which viewers were invited to send in [[video clip]]s from their [[home movies]]; ABC, which owns half the program, pays a royalty fee to the Tokyo Broadcasting System for the use of the format (although the original parent show left the air in 1992).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105171457/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=Littleton, Cynthia|title=Putting the fun in 'Home Videos'; Vincent John Di Bona, executive producer of television program ''America's Funniest Home Videos''|journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=May 20, 1996|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Contestants can submit their videos by uploading them on the show's official website, AFV.com, on the AFV applications for Android or iOS or on the AFV Official Facebook fan page, or by sending them via mail to a [[Hollywood, California]] [[post-office box]] address.<ref name=\"contestrules\">https://www.afv.com/contest-rules</ref> The majority of the video clips are short (5\u201330 seconds) and are mostly related to the host's monologues. Videos usually feature people and animals getting into humorous accidents caught on camera; while others include clever marriage proposals, people and animals displaying interesting talents (such as pets that sound like they speak certain words or phrases, or genius toddlers with the ability to name all past [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]]), and [[practical joke]]s.

Besides hosting the series, Saget also served as a member of its writing staff, alongside Todd Thicke and Bob Arnott.

Beginning about the middle of the first season, the show began featuring the \"Assignment America\" segment, which called for a series of videos to be sent in (collected or made) pertaining to a specific theme. Another segment introduced during Saget's tenure as host called \"Backwards Classics,\" shows videos being played in reverse set to classical music. Since the show's debut as a regular series, the show routinely includes two to three times per episode, a montage of themed videos set to a particular song, called the \"Music Montage\"; classic songs (mostly from the 1950s through the 1970s, with only a few songs from the 1980s scattered in) were used during these montages in the original run of the series, though more recent pop, R&B and rock songs have been incorporated since Tom Bergeron became the show's host. In season five, an animated sidekick was introduced named \"Stretchy McGillicuddy\" (voiced by [[Danny Mann]]), who was known for trying to tease Saget and doing other crazy things. In one episode (in season five), he was shown on the two large TV monitors on both sides of the set and Bob had to turn him off with a remote. Stretchy's catchphrase was: \"Don't get a little touchy, Bob, I'm just a little stretchy!\" The character was dropped from the show at the end of the seventh season. In 1994, ABC canceled ''America's Funniest People'' after four seasons due to declining ratings and had to decide what to do with its Sunday night 7:30&nbsp;p.m. timeslot.

For Saget's final season on ''AFHV,'' two new episodes would be shown. Numerous comedy skits were performed on the set during Saget's tenure as host. The set consisted of a living room design (the main set, originally a three-wall design with a bay window, was remodeled for the 1992\u201393 season as a flatter frame outline with translucent walls \u2013 though the furniture featured on the original set remained). The beginning of each episode was tied in with a skit just before the transition was made from the introduction to Saget. This usually consisted of several actors in a fake room (usually in the upper part of the audience section or in another soundstage) pretending to get excited watching ''America's Funniest Home Videos,'' a technique that was scrapped at the end of the fifth season. Saget himself soon grew tired of the repetitive format and was eager to pursue other projects as a comedian, actor and director. Producer Di Bona held him to his contract, resulting in a frustrated Saget listlessly going through the motions, constantly getting out of character and making pointed remarks on the air during his last two seasons. Saget's contract expired in May 1997 and he decided to leave the show afterward. However, according to Di Bona, the producers felt a change (and change of hosts) was needed for ''AFV'' as a result of ABC going through a change of leadership (hence ABC's ownership transition from Capital Cities to Disney).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120437/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83875289.html \"News Lite: Names in the News; ABC 'Videos' Gets New Host\"], ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', August 2, 1997.

The show was expanded to a single full hour-long episode, instead of two consecutive half-hour episodes, and was shown Friday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern; however, it went on hiatus for two months due in part to the [[September 11 attacks]] and also because of ABC airing specials and trying a new Friday night lineup (''[[The Mole (U.S. season 2)|The Mole II: The Next Betrayal]],'' ''[[Thieves (TV series)|Thieves]]'' and\n''[[Once and Again]]''), which was ultimately short-lived (''Thieves'' ended after only ten episodes, the first eight of which aired) and the show returned to the schedule in December 2001. In his earlier episodes, Bergeron used the set (with the bulky see-through iMac computers) from the ''AFV'' specials that aired in 2000, until the latter part of his first season, when a new set (with a studio audience) was introduced featuring a round video screen with several monitors. In September 2003, the show returned to its former Sunday 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern timeslot, still an hour long (though special episodes occasionally aired on Friday nights until 2007). Unlike Saget, who provided voice-overs to the clips, Bergeron humorously narrated them, though he did lend his voice to some clips from time to time. Changes of the set were replacement of the round video wall by a curved video wall, changing the color of the pillars to blue (sometimes other colors), addition of curved light borders hanging through the set, lights under the center with return of the letters \"AFV.\" The Bergeron version added new segments, such as \"Tom's Home Movies,\" where his face is digitally superimposed over the face of a person in each of the videos with varying expressions shown to match the person's reaction to their mishaps in the videos (a recurring gag referenced by Bergeron in this segment is on his superimposed head being larger than normal size), various audience participation games using funny home videos including \"Head, Gut, or Groin,\" where Bergeron picked one or two members of the studio audience to guess whether the person in the video would be hit in the aforementioned three areas of the body in order to win an ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' compilation DVD (since the 2012\u201313 season, a [[bobblehead]] of Bergeron was given as the prize) and the \"slo-mo gizmo,\" where a video is played first at normal speed and then again at a slower speed and using [[telestrator]]. Bergeron nearly always ended each episode with the phrase \"If you get it on tape, you could get it in cash,\" which was later changed to \"Upload to us. Get rich, get famous\" by the 2008-09 season. That phrase would continue to be used for another 10 years, including into Ribiero's first three seasons until the season 29 premiere on Sunday, September 30, 2018. While only four or more of the Bergeron-era segments (\"Vs.,\" \"The Dog/Cat Park,\" \"Name That Sound\" and \"A Moment With...\" to say the least) and a few interactive games continue to be shown on Ribiero's ''AFV'' at present, the segments introduced (and still seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Bergeron hosted the show include: \n*\"Vs.\" (featuring compilations of two sets of related videos, in which the \"winner\" of the two is revealed at the end, followed by a fictional \"preview\" of the videos in which the winner is claimed to face in the next segment)\n*\"A Moment of EWWWWW!\" (featuring a video that focuses on something gross such as mucus hanging from a person's nose after sneezing)\n*\"The Dog/Cat Park\" (a compilation of animal videos featuring dogs or cats that is named accordingly to the animals featured)\n*\"AFV Family of the Week\" (featuring funny videos of adults and children, the \"family\" featured are actually people of no familial relation)\n*\"Nincompoop Corner\" (a compilation of videos of people getting into situations that humorously showcase a lack of good judgement)\n*\"AFV Dictionary\" (featuring a humorous dictionary definition made to apply to the video being shown)\n*\"Name that Sound\" (which features audio of an unusual sound, followed by a clip of the video which the sound came from that usually reveals a person or animal making the noise)\n*\"Pick the Real Video\" (a multiple-choice game in which audience members are asked to choose which video is the one that will be shown)\n*\"What's Behind the Blue Blob,\" \"Kid, Cat, or Canine\" (both are games which audience members are asked to guess the person, animal or object featured in the video that is then revealed)\n*\"The Naughty File\" (featuring a video incorporating inappropriate behavior such as a child urinating at a family gathering)\n*\"A Moment With...\" (An out of the ordinary video is shown for a few seconds)\n*\"What's with the French?\"\n*\"AFV Pop Quiz\" (a multiple-choice game leading into and out of a commercial break in which viewers are asked to guess what occurs next in the video)\n*\"The AFV $10,000 Club\" (an early segment in which a home video that already won $10,000 in a previous show was showcased) \n*''Mysterious Mysteries of Mystery'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a video with mysterious things happening like balloons replacing faces, in news headline form)\n*''On This Day in AFV History'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a very old video, with a date, which Tom says that date, for example, a video from October 10, 1987, features a kid petting a pig, which bites him in the crotch)\n*\"A Salute To... \" (a segment that salutes specifically themed clips)\nStarting with the 2007\u201308 season, the series began allowing viewers to upload their funny home videos online at ABC.com, but has since the 2012\u201313 season; launched their own website that same year and has viewers upload their videos instead to AFV.com, in addition to sending their videos via standard mail.

Bergeron's \"real\" final new episode aired on May 17, 2015, the season finale, ending his run as host after 15 seasons (the longest hosting tenure for the series to date). The episode-- taped on-location at [[Disneyland]] for that season's edition of the annual \"Grand Prize Spectacular,\" ''AFV''{{'}}s 25th anniversary and the Disneyland Resort's 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration that began on May 22, 2015 (which has appeared in various formats since 2005, in which one of the two (formerly three) $100,000 winners from the current season wins a [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]], or in earlier seasons, an [[Adventures by Disney]] vacation package)-- featured an [[auto-tune]]d montage of clips and outtakes from Bergeron's run as host and closed with him being escorted after walking off the outdoor stage near [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]] following the grand prize presentation on a golf cart driven by Saget in a special [[cameo appearance]].

Bergeron formally introduced Ribeiro's new role as host during the latter's guest performance on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 20)|season 20 finale]] of ''Dancing with the Stars'' (Ribeiro appeared as a DWTS competitor and won the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 19)|previous season]]). Before becoming the current host of the show, Ribeiro made his only guest appearance in the studio on a season 25 episode of ''AFV'' playing one of the show's audience participation games with then-host Bergeron called \"Who's Makin' That Racket?\". While some of the Bergeron-era clip segments, the in-studio audience and background parts of the Bergeron-era set props remained intact and/or continued to air for all five years of Ribiero's tenure as host, the stage featured a metal floor layout and stairway connected to a cube screen put together like a puzzle using smaller sized flat-panel TV screens and new segments (especially for Ribiero's run) continued to be added and aired on the show. The show also introduced the Squares-era (probably in reference to the cube screen) with Ribiero's entrance as host in 2015. Additional set props like the arrow screens with flat-panel monitors on them and light-up color-changing versions of the tables where some of the studio audience sit when not in the bleacher areas made their debut to the ''AFV'' set starting in 2019. Starting in March 2018, when ''American Idol'' returned to television as an ABC show after one year off the air since being cancelled by FOX, the credits started sometimes being shown on some episodes at the bottom of the screen entirely at the beginning and ending (during Ribeiro's signoffs) of the show with the spinning Vin Di Bona Productions signature logo and ABC copyright notice being shown in the image shots of the studio without the background bumpers and jingles at show's actual end. Also, starting in 2019, the main logo (not the letter initials) with announcer [[Jess Harnell]] using the full name of show as he's welcoming the studio audience and viewers to \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" (and introducing Ribiero to the set) at the beginning of the program was moved to the lower right corner of TV screens after many years and decades seen right at the center of the screen. Ribeiro also humorously narrates the clip, much like his predecessor, though he makes extensive use of rhyming in his speeches. The segments introduced (and still yet to be seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Ribiero hosted the show include:\n*\"#TBT: But On A...\" (a \"Throwback Thursday\" segment that started in the Ribiero-era of ''AFV'' that reunites viewers, including longtime viewers and fans of ''AFV'' on any day of the week, including Thursdays, Sundays and Mondays, with theirs and the show's nostalgic, classic and some new modern classic clips submitted over the decades past and present-- provided all episodes of ''AFV'' with or without this segment and regardless of host-- as shows and clips become reruns and classics in their own right when they reach syndication-- are aired on any local station, cable and broadcast network again and again on any day of the week and at present with new episodes of ''AFV'' and this segment airing on Sundays on ABC.

For the start of the season on October 8, 2017, instead of leading off Sunday nights, it aired Sunday nights at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT and was led into at the start of the season by ''[[The Toy Box]].'' During some parts of the holiday season starting on November 26, 2017 and remaining that way for almost the first two months of 2018 through January 21, 2018 (and final 'repeat/repeat' on February 4, 2018), ''AFV'' aired in a 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format. ''AFV'' returned with new episodes in the 7/6 central time slot (still an hour-long on Sunday nights) due to holiday movie presentations and specials airing on ABC on Sunday nights at 8/7 central during the holiday season on December 10, 2017, and then permanently starting on February 11, 2018. ABC repeated the 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format for ''AFV'' on January 6, 2019, with new episodes returning to the 7/6 central time slot on March 3, 2019, when ''American Idol'' premieres with ''AFV'' likely to be pre-empted in some time zones when ''American Idol'' airs the live (in all time-zones) finale episodes in May 2019. ABC renewed ''AFV'' for a 29th season on March 13, 2018, which premiered at its regular 7/6 central Sunday night timeslot (and was the lead-off starting on October 7, 2018 to ''Dancing With The Stars Juniors'') on September 30, 2018.\n\n==$100,000 contest==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nAfter every half of the season, the $10,000 winners from the preceding episodes are brought back to participate in a contest to win an additional $100,000. (Previously, there would be three $100,000 shows per season, after runs of shows consisting of either 5, 6, or 7 episodes. Beginning with the 24th season, the format changed to two $100,000 shows, each one after a 9-or-10-episode run. This format was also used in season 9, as well as seasons 12-14.) Two $100,000 contests air each season (the final $100,000 episode originally aired as the season finale until the 15th season, at which point it begin airing as the episode before each season's final episode), though only one aired in the first season.<ref name=\"afv.com\">{{cite web|url=http://afv.com/contest-rules/ |title=Contest Rules}}</ref>\n\n===Voting===\n*1990\u201397 (Saget era): ABC stations (5 in season one, 3 from 1990 to 1993, and 2 from 1993 onward) around the country are joined via satellite to cast their votes along with the Los Angeles studio audience (the final $100,000 show of season two was decided by a telephone vote).\n*1998\u2013present (post-Saget era): Three formats have been used at various times:\n# The Los Angeles studio audience votes to determine the winner.\n# Viewers log onto the show's website to cast their votes.\n# The show declares the winner by going to the Disney Parks and asking park-goers, as well inviting characters like Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy, to determine the $100,000 winning clip.<ref name=\"afv.com\"/>\n\n===Other contests===\n* 2002: \"Battle of the Best\": The Quad Squad ($25,000 and trip to Maui)<ref>{{cite web|last=Levin |first=Josh |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2148214/ |title=The agonizing journey from America's Funniest Home Videos to YouTube.&nbsp;\u2013 By Josh Levin&nbsp;\u2013 Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date=August 24, 2006 |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref>\n* 2005: Disney Dream Vacation ($100,000 and free vacations to all 11 [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme parks]] around the world)\n* 2006: Dancing Machine ($100,000 and free vacations to 500+ places for 48 years)\n* 2006: The Quad Squad ($250,000) (The Funniest Video of All Time)\n* 2009: Birthday Blowout ($100,000 and free vacations to 500+ places for 50 years)\n* 2015: H20 NO-NO: Trip To Disneyland for 60 People (to celebrate the Disneyland Resort 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration)\n* 2016: Donkey Delights: Trip to Disney World Florida and Shanghai Disneyland China\n* 2018: Sedated Saber Skirmish: Trip to Walt Disney World to experience the new Toy Story Land\n* 2019: Blast with the Laughing Gas: Trip to Aulani: A Disney Resort in Hawaii\n\n==Ratings==\n===Season averages===\n''America's Funniest Home Videos'' became an instant hit with audiences, with the original special in November 1989 averaging a 17.7 rating and 25 share, finishing at ninth place in the Nielsen ratings that week.

This version of the song accompanied the opening and closing credits for the first seven-and-a-half seasons. This theme was reused once again for when [[Tom Bergeron]] introduced [[Bob Saget]] as well as a montage of classic videos and Saget's first, original intro moment to the stage from the pilot episode and a latter segment (using the theme's original lyrics) showcasing Saget's run (during ''AFV''{{'}}s first eight seasons) on the show in the ''AFV'' 20th anniversary special, which aired in 2009. The show's online series of videos entitled ''AFV XD'' is noted for its use of this version of the theme song, as well as portions of the original graphics from the 1989\u201397 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/show/afvxd|title=AFV XD}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=No content on this channel.|date=October 2016}} During the final part of the $100,000 shows, bands as well as other artists would play the theme. Midway through Saget's final season in 1997, the theme was revamped (as well as the graphics and animation of the show's intro) featuring a duet of new vocals, Peter Hix (who had previously performed the theme song for ''America's Funniest People'') and Terry Wood. The new version was also set in a different key than the original. When ''AFHV'' returned for its ninth season with Fuentes and Fugelsang in 1998, a completely new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" made its debut. Since that time, the theme has been an instrumental (also composed by Slider) with a faster, ska/reggae beat, with the original key restored, making it sound similar to \"[[The Impression That I Get]]\" by [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]]. The 13th season uses the trimmed version of 1998 ''AFV'' theme song, in which was heard as a guitar chorus which was heard in theme song during seasons 14-22, as well as an alternate version of this theme exists that is stripped of the trumpets (this version is only heard as the closing theme during the 2002\u201303 season in ABC and broadcast syndication runs, as well as in re-edited bumpers with added video clips from that particular episode in some 2002\u201303 season episodes in broadcast syndication). In reruns of the Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes on [[WGN America]] and later the Bergeron episodes on WGN America and [[ABC Family]], the theme is noticeably slowed down during the show's opening titles and commercial bumpers. For season 26, with Ribeiro, a new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" was introduced with that season's premiere episode in 2015, replacing the 1998 theme after seventeen seasons. The current theme, which Slider also composed, is stylized more alike the original version with its key of that theme, as well as the additional hook of the 1998 version retained. The 1990, 1998 and 2015 themes can be heard in their entirety at the Television Production Music Museum. The 1997 theme used during Saget's last season has not been released to this day, as it is reportedly being held by Di Bona. \"The Funny Things You Do\" was the theme song to the [[Australia's Funniest Home Videos|Australian version]] between 1991 and 2004. It was replaced by an instrumental version as part of a major revamp in 2005.\n\n==Reruns/syndication==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nVirtually all episodes of ''AFHV'' are, or have been, in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]], with each host period packaged separately from each other. Until 2001, the Saget version was syndicated by [[20th Television]], which assumed syndication rights through its purchase of [[MTM Enterprises]], which had syndicated the show from 1995 to 1998.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120747/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html McClellan, Steve. \"MTM launches 'Videos'; MTM Television Distribution offers syndication of America's Funniest Home Videos\"], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'', October 3, 1994. Retrieved March 7, 2011, from HighBeam Research.</ref> [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] (formerly Buena Vista Television), the sister company of one of the show's production companies [[ABC Productions]], distributes all versions of the series. Ironically, [[Disney]]/[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] would [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquire]] [[20th Television]]'s parent ([[21st Century Fox]]) in 2019, thus effectively giving Disney ownership of the series' original syndicator (along with the remains of MTM).\n\n===Bob Saget episodes===\nThe Saget episodes were split into two separate packages: Seasons 1-5 (1989\u201394) and Seasons 6-8 (1994-97). All episodes from all the Bob Saget seasons aired in off-network syndication. The episodes from Seasons 1-5 aired on [[Ion Televison (American TV channel)|PAX]] from 2003 to 2005, [[Nick at Nite]] from April to October 2007 and [[Hallmark Channel]] from January 2010 to April 2011. When the Saget episodes aired in syndication thru MTM/20th Television, the contest plugs were replaced by a generic version announced by Gary Owens. In addition, the closing credits were slightly edited to include a telephone number to visit the show online. In the PAX airings, when back-to-back episodes aired, the end credits from the first episode (outside Di Bona's executive producer credit on some episodes and $100,000 shows where marching bands performed the show's theme in celebration) and the opening titles of the second episode were cut and replaced with an announcer saying \"Now don't go away, here's more of ''America's Funniest Home Videos!''\" before cutting to Anderson introducing Saget. These episodes also removed some videos, along with winner's interviews in order to fit more network advertising within a 30-minute time slot, a practice also used by Nick at Nite and Hallmark. Some contest plugs were also removed, except for PAX airings. Nick at Nite and Hallmark sometimes uses a modern generic contest plug announced by Harnell. Modern scrolling network-projected [[closing credits]] also scrolled by at the end of episodes, rather than the original credits. The episodes from Seasons 6-8 aired on [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] from September 2004 to October 2007 with outdated information and contest plugs removed.\n\n===Tom Bergeron episodes===\nThe Bergeron episodes began airing in off-network syndication on September 14, 2009; [[WGN America]] also aired the off-network syndicated episodes in late night until September 2011. [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]] has aired reruns of the Tom Bergeron-era episodes of ''AFV'' since 2016. Since 2014, re-edits of this episode run before the show's HD conversion premiered to fill a [[16:9]] frame and to remove outdated content and contest plugs. The 2009\u20132015 Tom Bergeron episodes began airing on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on September 15, 2014, with earlier episodes eventually becoming a part of the package until TBS stopped carrying the show in 2017.\n\n===Alfonso Ribeiro episodes===\nRibeiro's run has yet to enter syndication, though he does regular promotional advertising on the 2015\u2013present ''AFV'' set for [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]]'s syndication package of Bergeron-era episodes. ABC of course sometimes airs repeats of the current or previous season(s) (regardless of hosts) on Sunday evenings on weeks without a new episode and sometimes in other time slots, mainly Saturday evenings when no sports coverage is offered.\n\n===International airings===\nIn Canada, [[Corus Entertainment]] currently holds repeat rights to the Saget (seasons 6-8) and Bergeron era of the series and it airs on [[ABC Spark]] (94-97 episodes) and [[CMT (Canadian TV channel)|CMT]] (Bergeron era). Currently no network broadcasts new episodes in Canada as of the fall of 2018, leaving viewers to watch the original ABC airing; in the past, [[Citytv]] and its sister network [[Omni Television]], along with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] carried the series, though those networks have since let the rights lapse due to [[National Football League|NFL]] commitments which block any [[simultaneous substitution|simsub]] opportunities for advertising if ''AFV'' aired later. Australia's [[Fox8]] also carries the series, both in new and rerun form. The 2003-2015 Bergeron episodes began airing on [[BiteTV|Bite]] on August 28, 2014 and stopped airing on June 5, 2015.\n\n==Seasons==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The most common videos feature unintentional [[physical comedy]], pets or children and some staged [[practical joke|prank]]s. Originally airing as a [[television special|special]] in 1989, it later debuted as a regular weekly series in 1990. The show was hosted by [[Bob Saget]] for the 1989 special and the first eight seasons of the series incarnation. After Saget's retirement from hosting in 1997, [[John Fugelsang]] and [[Daisy Fuentes]] later took over as co-host for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials, hosted by various actors and comedians such as [[D.L. Hughley]] and [[Richard Kind]], ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in 2001 with new host [[Tom Bergeron]], who has since become the series' longest-serving host, hosting 15 seasons. Bergeron announced in 2014 that he would be leaving as host of the show, and [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] took over as host in 2015. On October 29, 2018, ABC renewed ''AFV'' for two more seasons, bringing to its 30th (which premiered on Sunday, September 29, 2019) and 31st seasons.\n\n==Premise==\nAFV is based on the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] program ''[[Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan]],'' which featured a segment in which viewers were invited to send in [[video clip]]s from their [[home movies]]; ABC, which owns half the program, pays a royalty fee to the Tokyo Broadcasting System for the use of the format (although the original parent show left the air in 1992).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105171457/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-date-November 5, 2012|author=Littleton, Cynthia|title=Putting the fun in 'Home Videos'; Vincent John Di Bona, executive producer of television program ''America's Funniest Home Videos''|journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=May 20, 1996|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Contestants can submit their videos by uploading them on the show's official website, AFV.com, on the AFV applications for Android or iOS or on the AFV Official Facebook fan page, or by sending them via mail to a [[Hollywood, California]] [[post-office box]] address.<ref name=\"contestrules\">https://www.afv.com/contest-rules</ref> The majority of the video clips are short (5\u201330 seconds) and are mostly related to the host's monologues. Videos usually feature people and animals getting into humorous accidents caught on camera; while others include clever marriage proposals, people and animals displaying interesting talents (such as pets that sound like they speak certain words or phrases, or genius toddlers with the ability to name all past [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]]), and [[practical joke]]s. A group of screeners view the submitted tapes, giving them a grade (on a scale of 1\u201310) based on that particular tape's humor. The videos deemed the funniest by the screeners then go on to the show's producers and then is turned over to Di Bona and another producer for final approval.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120124/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8162596.html Susan Bickelhaupt, Globe Staff. \"'Funniest Home Videos' Outstrips '60 Minutes'.\"], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', February 28, 1990.

Beginning about the middle of the first season, the show began featuring the \"Assignment America\" segment, which called for a series of videos to be sent in (collected or made) pertaining to a specific theme. Another segment introduced during Saget's tenure as host called \"Backwards Classics,\" shows videos being played in reverse set to classical music. Since the show's debut as a regular series, the show routinely includes two to three times per episode, a montage of themed videos set to a particular song, called the \"Music Montage\"; classic songs (mostly from the 1950s through the 1970s, with only a few songs from the 1980s scattered in) were used during these montages in the original run of the series, though more recent pop, R&B and rock songs have been incorporated since Tom Bergeron became the show's host. In season five, an animated sidekick was introduced named \"Stretchy McGillicuddy\" (voiced by [[Danny Mann]]), who was known for trying to tease Saget and doing other crazy things. In one episode (in season five), he was shown on the two large TV monitors on both sides of the set and Bob had to turn him off with a remote. Stretchy's catchphrase was: \"Don't get a little touchy, Bob, I'm just a little stretchy!\" The character was dropped from the show at the end of the seventh season.

For Saget's final season on ''AFHV,'' two new episodes would be shown. Numerous comedy skits were performed on the set during Saget's tenure as host. The set consisted of a living room design (the main set, originally a three-wall design with a bay window, was remodeled for the 1992\u201393 season as a flatter frame outline with translucent walls \u2013 though the furniture featured on the original set remained). The beginning of each episode was tied in with a skit just before the transition was made from the introduction to Saget. This usually consisted of several actors in a fake room (usually in the upper part of the audience section or in another soundstage) pretending to get excited watching ''America's Funniest Home Videos,'' a technique that was scrapped at the end of the fifth season. Saget himself soon grew tired of the repetitive format and was eager to pursue other projects as a comedian, actor and director. Producer Di Bona held him to his contract, resulting in a frustrated Saget listlessly going through the motions, constantly getting out of character and making pointed remarks on the air during his last two seasons. Saget's contract expired in May 1997 and he decided to leave the show afterward. However, according to Di Bona, the producers felt a change (and change of hosts) was needed for ''AFV'' as a result of ABC going through a change of leadership (hence ABC's ownership transition from Capital Cities to Disney).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120437/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83875289.html \"News Lite: Names in the News; ABC 'Videos' Gets New Host\"], ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', August 2, 1997.

The show was expanded to a single full hour-long episode, instead of two consecutive half-hour episodes, and was shown Friday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern; however, it went on hiatus for two months due in part to the [[September 11 attacks]] and also because of ABC airing specials and trying a new Friday night lineup (''[[The Mole (U.S. season 2)|The Mole II: The Next Betrayal]],'' ''[[Thieves (TV series)|Thieves]]'' and\n''[[Once and Again]]''), which was ultimately short-lived (''Thieves'' ended after only ten episodes, the first eight of which aired) and the show returned to the schedule in December 2001. In his earlier episodes, Bergeron used the set (with the bulky see-through iMac computers) from the ''AFV'' specials that aired in 2000, until the latter part of his first season, when a new set (with a studio audience) was introduced featuring a round video screen with several monitors. In September 2003, the show returned to its former Sunday 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern timeslot, still an hour long (though special episodes occasionally aired on Friday nights until 2007). Unlike Saget, who provided voice-overs to the clips, Bergeron humorously narrated them, though he did lend his voice to some clips from time to time. Changes of the set were replacement of the round video wall by a curved video wall, changing the color of the pillars to blue (sometimes other colors), addition of curved light borders hanging through the set, lights under the center with return of the letters \"AFV.\" The Bergeron version added new segments, such as \"Tom's Home Movies,\" where his face is digitally superimposed over the face of a person in each of the videos with varying expressions shown to match the person's reaction to their mishaps in the videos (a recurring gag referenced by Bergeron in this segment is on his superimposed head being larger than normal size), various audience participation games using funny home videos including \"Head, Gut, or Groin,\" where Bergeron picked one or two members of the studio audience to guess whether the person in the video would be hit in the aforementioned three areas of the body in order to win an ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' compilation DVD (since the 2012\u201313 season, a [[bobblehead]] of Bergeron was given as the prize) and the \"slo-mo gizmo,\" where a video is played first at normal speed and then again at a slower speed and using [[telestrator]]. Bergeron nearly always ended each episode with the phrase \"If you get it on tape, you could get it in cash,\" which was later changed to \"Upload to us. Get rich, get famous\" by the 2008-09 season. That phrase would continue to be used for another 10 years, including into Ribiero's first three seasons until the season 29 premiere on Sunday, September 30, 2018. While only four or more of the Bergeron-era segments (\"Vs.,\" \"The Dog/Cat Park,\" \"Name That Sound\" and \"A Moment With...\" to say the least) and a few interactive games continue to be shown on Ribiero's ''AFV'' at present, the segments introduced (and still seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Bergeron hosted the show include: \n*\"Vs.\" (featuring compilations of two sets of related videos, in which the \"winner\" of the two is revealed at the end, followed by a fictional \"preview\" of the videos in which the winner is claimed to face in the next segment)\n*\"A Moment of EWWWWW!\" (featuring a video that focuses on something gross such as mucus hanging from a person's nose after sneezing)\n*\"The Dog/Cat Park\" (a compilation of animal videos featuring dogs or cats that is named accordingly to the animals featured)\n*\"AFV Family of the Week\" (featuring funny videos of adults and children, the \"family\" featured are actually people of no familial relation)\n*\"Nincompoop Corner\" (a compilation of videos of people getting into situations that humorously showcase a lack of good judgement)\n*\"AFV Dictionary\" (featuring a humorous dictionary definition made to apply to the video being shown)\n*\"Name that Sound\" (which features audio of an unusual sound, followed by a clip of the video which the sound came from that usually reveals a person or animal making the noise)\n*\"Pick the Real Video\" (a multiple-choice game in which audience members are asked to choose which video is the one that will be shown)\n*\"What's Behind the Blue Blob,\" \"Kid, Cat, or Canine\" (both are games which audience members are asked to guess the person, animal or object featured in the video that is then revealed)\n*\"The Naughty File\" (featuring a video incorporating inappropriate behavior such as a child urinating at a family gathering)\n*\"A Moment With...\" (An out of the ordinary video is shown for a few seconds)\n*\"What's with the French?\"\n*\"AFV Pop Quiz\" (a multiple-choice game leading into and out of a commercial break in which viewers are asked to guess what occurs next in the video)\n*\"The AFV $10,000 Club\" (an early segment in which a home video that already won $10,000 in a previous show was showcased) \n*''Mysterious Mysteries of Mystery'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a video with mysterious things happening like balloons replacing faces, in news headline form)\n*''On This Day in AFV History'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a very old video, with a date, which Tom says that date, for example, a video from October 10, 1987, features a kid petting a pig, which bites him in the crotch)\n*\"A Salute To... \" (a segment that salutes specifically themed clips)\nStarting with the 2007\u201308 season, the series began allowing viewers to upload their funny home videos online at ABC.com, but has since the 2012\u201313 season; launched their own website that same year and has viewers upload their videos instead to AFV.com, in addition to sending their videos via standard mail.

Bergeron made his second ''AFV'' guest appearance alongside Ribiero, Saget and (from the John and Daisy-era) Fuentes for an ''AFV'' 30th anniversary special called \"AFV: America...This Is You\" on Sunday, December 8, 2019 to celebrate ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary.<ref name=VarietyRibeiroAFV>{{cite web|title=Alfonso Ribeiro Named New Host of 'America's Funniest Home Videos'|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/alfonso-ribeiro-americas-funniest-home-videos-new-host-1201500927/|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=May 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bob Saget Showed Up For Tom Bergeron's Last America's Funniest Home Videos Episode|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/m/television/Bob-Saget-Showed-Up-Tom-Bergeron-Last-America-Funniest-Home-Videos-Episode-71971.html|author=Nick Venable|website=Cinema Blend|date=May 18, 2015|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u2013present: Alfonso Ribeiro===\n[[File:AFHV new logo.png|thumb|Current version of alternative logo, used since 2015.]]\nOn May 19, 2015, two days after Bergeron's final episode aired, ABC announced that Ribeiro (known for playing [[Carlton Banks]] on ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'') would take over as host of ''AFV'' beginning with the season 26 premiere on October 11, 2015. Bergeron formally introduced Ribeiro's new role as host during the latter's guest performance on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 20)|season 20 finale]] of ''Dancing with the Stars'' (Ribeiro appeared as a DWTS competitor and won the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 19)|previous season]]). Before becoming the current host of the show, Ribeiro made his only guest appearance in the studio on a season 25 episode of ''AFV'' playing one of the show's audience participation games with then-host Bergeron called \"Who's Makin' That Racket?\". While some of the Bergeron-era clip segments, the in-studio audience and background parts of the Bergeron-era set props remained intact and/or continued to air for all five years of Ribiero's tenure as host, the stage featured a metal floor layout and stairway connected to a cube screen put together like a puzzle using smaller sized flat-panel TV screens and new segments (especially for Ribiero's run) continued to be added and aired on the show. The show also introduced the Squares-era (probably in reference to the cube screen) with Ribiero's entrance as host in 2015. Additional set props like the arrow screens with flat-panel monitors on them and light-up color-changing versions of the tables where some of the studio audience sit when not in the bleacher areas made their debut to the ''AFV'' set starting in 2019. Starting in March 2018, when ''American Idol'' returned to television as an ABC show after one year off the air since being cancelled by FOX, the credits started sometimes being shown on some episodes at the bottom of the screen entirely at the beginning and ending (during Ribeiro's signoffs) of the show with the spinning Vin Di Bona Productions signature logo and ABC copyright notice being shown in the image shots of the studio without the background bumpers and jingles at show's actual end. Also, starting in 2019, the main logo (not the letter initials) with announcer [[Jess Harnell]] using the full name of show as he's welcoming the studio audience and viewers to \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" (and introducing Ribiero to the set) at the beginning of the program was moved to the lower right corner of TV screens after many years and decades seen right at the center of the screen. Ribeiro also humorously narrates the clip, much like his predecessor, though he makes extensive use of rhyming in his speeches. The segments introduced (and still yet to be seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Ribiero hosted the show include:\n*\"#TBT: But On A...\" (a \"Throwback Thursday\" segment that started in the Ribiero-era of ''AFV'' that reunites viewers, including longtime viewers and fans of ''AFV'' on any day of the week, including Thursdays, Sundays and Mondays, with theirs and the show's nostalgic, classic and some new modern classic clips submitted over the decades past and present-- provided all episodes of ''AFV'' with or without this segment and regardless of host-- as shows and clips become reruns and classics in their own right when they reach syndication-- are aired on any local station, cable and broadcast network again and again on any day of the week and at present with new episodes of ''AFV'' and this segment airing on Sundays on ABC. In season 30, a temporary \"Throwback 30\" version of this segment debuted in ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary season that takes you to clips from specific years-- all clips from, let's say 1989-- similar to the \"On This Day In AFV History\" segment from Bergeron's ''AFV'' run, but with more clips and not just one)\n*\"Hey Alfonso!\" (segment not \"officially\" named until season 30 that since season 26 features kids and adults in videos asking Alfonso to show them and the viewers specifically themed clips-- Dogs, slow-mo, the like)\n*\"This One Time On AFV\" (clips shown with a [[Mother Goose]] or fairy tale storytelling skit)\n*\"Alfonso's Flubs\" (blooper clips of Ribeiro in the studio trying to get his monologue lines right)\n*\"Alfonso's Rhyme Time\" (Ribeiro comes up with rhyming words in his clip narration that relate to the funny subject matter of the clip)\n*\"I Think I See The Problem\" (a segment featuring clips of people looking for one way to solve a problem, but unintentionally discover another way household problems can be solved through funny fails)\n*\"#NotTrending\" (clips of attempted trends and fads by ordinary people never thought of that could catch on later, but haven't or don't look like they could trend or catch on soon on social media-- ''AFV'' is a start for them)\n*\"Maybe It's Not Your Thing\" (clips of people trying to do things and finally fail at doing that not be their thing)\n*\"Alfonso's Advice\" (Ribeiro giving advice to the viewer on how to avoid a fail as clips show people failing to follow the advice)\n*\"Video Symphony\" (Clips featuring sound effects in ''AFV''{{'}}s version of a musical symphony)\n*\"What The Fluff\" (Clips featuring people disappearing or sometimes attempting and failing to disappear \"magically\" behind towels by running; to the amazement and/or despair of kids and/or animals)\n*\"Bad Places To Sit\" (Clips featuring people sitting in bad chairs and calling down or animals sitting in strange, bad locations)\n*\"Something To Brighten Your Day\" (Clips to make you laugh and brighten your day after a bad day)\n*\"The Problem Then/Now\" (featuring clips from, let's say, 1989, 1993, 1997, 2001 and 2004 likely representing the \"Then\" and clips from 2017, 2019 and 2020 representing the \"Now\" while the \"Now's\" will eventually become \"Then's\" as the clips and episode become classics and reruns in their own right in the upcoming decades)\n*\"Horrible Headlines\" (''AFV''{{'}}s funny version of \"Fake News\" featuring horribly non-newsworthy funny-- or scary-- clips)\n*\"Catastrophe Countdown\" (Featuring clips of people who hopefully will avert catastrophe in 3, 2, 1 and catastrophe happens)\n*\"Here's Why\" (Showing viewers why people shouldn't do things the way they do them or get things where they shouldn't get them)\nBeginning with the 2018-19 season, Ribeiro nearly ended each week's episode with the phrase \"Good night, everybody and remember, send your video to us (or 'me' referring to Ribeiro), get yourself on TV\" after three (and including the final seven years of the Bergeron-era, 10) years of saying \"Upload to us.

For the start of the season on October 8, 2017, instead of leading off Sunday nights, it aired Sunday nights at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT and was led into at the start of the season by ''[[The Toy Box]].'' During some parts of the holiday season starting on November 26, 2017 and remaining that way for almost the first two months of 2018 through January 21, 2018 (and final 'repeat/repeat' on February 4, 2018), ''AFV'' aired in a 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format. ''AFV'' returned with new episodes in the 7/6 central time slot (still an hour-long on Sunday nights) due to holiday movie presentations and specials airing on ABC on Sunday nights at 8/7 central during the holiday season on December 10, 2017, and then permanently starting on February 11, 2018. ABC repeated the 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format for ''AFV'' on January 6, 2019, with new episodes returning to the 7/6 central time slot on March 3, 2019, when ''American Idol'' premieres with ''AFV'' likely to be pre-empted in some time zones when ''American Idol'' airs the live (in all time-zones) finale episodes in May 2019. ABC renewed ''AFV'' for a 29th season on March 13, 2018, which premiered at its regular 7/6 central Sunday night timeslot (and was the lead-off starting on October 7, 2018 to ''Dancing With The Stars Juniors'') on September 30, 2018.\n\n==$100,000 contest==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nAfter every half of the season, the $10,000 winners from the preceding episodes are brought back to participate in a contest to win an additional $100,000. (Previously, there would be three $100,000 shows per season, after runs of shows consisting of either 5, 6, or 7 episodes. Beginning with the 24th season, the format changed to two $100,000 shows, each one after a 9-or-10-episode run. This format was also used in season 9, as well as seasons 12-14.) Two $100,000 contests air each season (the final $100,000 episode originally aired as the season finale until the 15th season, at which point it begin airing as the episode before each season's final episode), though only one aired in the first season.<ref name=\"afv.com\">{{cite web|url=http://afv.com/contest-rules/ |title=Contest Rules}}</ref>\n\n===Voting===\n*1990\u201397 (Saget era): ABC stations (5 in season one, 3 from 1990 to 1993, and 2 from 1993 onward) around the country are joined via satellite to cast their votes along with the Los Angeles studio audience (the final $100,000 show of season two was decided by a telephone vote).\n*1998\u2013present (post-Saget era): Three formats have been used at various times:\n# The Los Angeles studio audience votes to determine the winner.\n# Viewers log onto the show's website to cast their votes.\n# The show declares the winner by going to the Disney Parks and asking park-goers, as well inviting characters like Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy, to determine the $100,000 winning clip.<ref name=\"afv.com\"/>\n\n===Other contests===\n* 2002: \"Battle of the Best\": The Quad Squad ($25,000 and trip to Maui)<ref>{{cite web|last=Levin |first=Josh |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2148214/ |title=The agonizing journey from America's Funniest Home Videos to YouTube.&nbsp;\u2013 By Josh Levin&nbsp;\u2013 Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date=August 24, 2006 |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref>\n* 2005: Disney Dream Vacation ($100,000 and free vacations to all 11 [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme parks]] around the world)\n* 2006: Dancing Machine ($100,000 and free vacations to 500+ places for 48 years)\n* 2006: The Quad Squad ($250,000) (The Funniest Video of All Time)\n* 2009: Birthday Blowout ($100,000 and free vacations to 500+ places for 50 years)\n* 2015: H20 NO-NO: Trip To Disneyland for 60 People (to celebrate the Disneyland Resort 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration)\n* 2016: Donkey Delights: Trip to Disney World Florida and Shanghai Disneyland China\n* 2018: Sedated Saber Skirmish: Trip to Walt Disney World to experience the new Toy Story Land\n* 2019: Blast with the Laughing Gas: Trip to Aulani: A Disney Resort in Hawaii\n\n==Ratings==\n===Season averages===\n''America's Funniest Home Videos'' became an instant hit with audiences, with the original special in November 1989 averaging a 17.7 rating and 25 share, finishing at ninth place in the Nielsen ratings that week.

This version of the song accompanied the opening and closing credits for the first seven-and-a-half seasons. This theme was reused once again for when [[Tom Bergeron]] introduced [[Bob Saget]] as well as a montage of classic videos and Saget's first, original intro moment to the stage from the pilot episode and a latter segment (using the theme's original lyrics) showcasing Saget's run (during ''AFV''{{'}}s first eight seasons) on the show in the ''AFV'' 20th anniversary special, which aired in 2009. The show's online series of videos entitled ''AFV XD'' is noted for its use of this version of the theme song, as well as portions of the original graphics from the 1989\u201397 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/show/afvxd|title=AFV XD}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=No content on this channel.|date=October 2016}} During the final part of the $100,000 shows, bands as well as other artists would play the theme. Midway through Saget's final season in 1997, the theme was revamped (as well as the graphics and animation of the show's intro) featuring a duet of new vocals, Peter Hix (who had previously performed the theme song for ''America's Funniest People'') and Terry Wood. The new version was also set in a different key than the original. When ''AFHV'' returned for its ninth season with Fuentes and Fugelsang in 1998, a completely new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" made its debut. Since that time, the theme has been an instrumental (also composed by Slider) with a faster, ska/reggae beat, with the original key restored, making it sound similar to \"[[The Impression That I Get]]\" by [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]]. The 13th season uses the trimmed version of 1998 ''AFV'' theme song, in which was heard as a guitar chorus which was heard in theme song during seasons 14-22, as well as an alternate version of this theme exists that is stripped of the trumpets (this version is only heard as the closing theme during the 2002\u201303 season in ABC and broadcast syndication runs, as well as in re-edited bumpers with added video clips from that particular episode in some 2002\u201303 season episodes in broadcast syndication). In reruns of the Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes on [[WGN America]] and later the Bergeron episodes on WGN America and [[ABC Family]], the theme is noticeably slowed down during the show's opening titles and commercial bumpers. For season 26, with Ribeiro, a new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" was introduced with that season's premiere episode in 2015, replacing the 1998 theme after seventeen seasons. The current theme, which Slider also composed, is stylized more alike the original version with its key of that theme, as well as the additional hook of the 1998 version retained. The 1990, 1998 and 2015 themes can be heard in their entirety at the Television Production Music Museum. The 1997 theme used during Saget's last season has not been released to this day, as it is reportedly being held by Di Bona. \"The Funny Things You Do\" was the theme song to the [[Australia's Funniest Home Videos|Australian version]] between 1991 and 2004. It was replaced by an instrumental version as part of a major revamp in 2005.\n\n==Reruns/syndication==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nVirtually all episodes of ''AFHV'' are, or have been, in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]], with each host period packaged separately from each other. Until 2001, the Saget version was syndicated by [[20th Television]], which assumed syndication rights through its purchase of [[MTM Enterprises]], which had syndicated the show from 1995 to 1998.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120747/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html McClellan, Steve. \"MTM launches 'Videos'; MTM Television Distribution offers syndication of America's Funniest Home Videos\"], ''[[Broadcasting & Cable]]'', October 3, 1994. Retrieved March 7, 2011, from HighBeam Research.</ref> [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] (formerly Buena Vista Television), the sister company of one of the show's production companies [[ABC Productions]], distributes all versions of the series. Ironically, [[Disney]]/[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] would [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquire]] [[20th Television]]'s parent ([[21st Century Fox]]) in 2019, thus effectively giving Disney ownership of the series' original syndicator (along with the remains of MTM).\n\n===Bob Saget episodes===\nThe Saget episodes were split into two separate packages: Seasons 1-5 (1989\u201394) and Seasons 6-8 (1994-97). All episodes from all the Bob Saget seasons aired in off-network syndication. The episodes from Seasons 1-5 aired on [[Ion Televison (American TV channel)|PAX]] from 2003 to 2005, [[Nick at Nite]] from April to October 2007 and [[Hallmark Channel]] from January 2010 to April 2011. When the Saget episodes aired in syndication thru MTM/20th Television, the contest plugs were replaced by a generic version announced by Gary Owens. In addition, the closing credits were slightly edited to include a telephone number to visit the show online. In the PAX airings, when back-to-back episodes aired, the end credits from the first episode (outside Di Bona's executive producer credit on some episodes and $100,000 shows where marching bands performed the show's theme in celebration) and the opening titles of the second episode were cut and replaced with an announcer saying \"Now don't go away, here's more of ''America's Funniest Home Videos!''\" before cutting to Anderson introducing Saget. These episodes also removed some videos, along with winner's interviews in order to fit more network advertising within a 30-minute time slot, a practice also used by Nick at Nite and Hallmark. Some contest plugs were also removed, except for PAX airings. Nick at Nite and Hallmark sometimes uses a modern generic contest plug announced by Harnell. Modern scrolling network-projected [[closing credits]] also scrolled by at the end of episodes, rather than the original credits. The episodes from Seasons 6-8 aired on [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] from September 2004 to October 2007 with outdated information and contest plugs removed.\n\n===Tom Bergeron episodes===\nThe Bergeron episodes began airing in off-network syndication on September 14, 2009; [[WGN America]] also aired the off-network syndicated episodes in late night until September 2011. [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]] has aired reruns of the Tom Bergeron-era episodes of ''AFV'' since 2016. Since 2014, re-edits of this episode run before the show's HD conversion premiered to fill a [[16:9]] frame and to remove outdated content and contest plugs. The 2009\u20132015 Tom Bergeron episodes began airing on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on September 15, 2014, with earlier episodes eventually becoming a part of the package until TBS stopped carrying the show in 2017.\n\n===Alfonso Ribeiro episodes===\nRibeiro's run has yet to enter syndication, though he does regular promotional advertising on the 2015\u2013present ''AFV'' set for [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]]'s syndication package of Bergeron-era episodes. ABC of course sometimes airs repeats of the current or previous season(s) (regardless of hosts) on Sunday evenings on weeks without a new episode and sometimes in other time slots, mainly Saturday evenings when no sports coverage is offered.\n\n===International airings===\nIn Canada, [[Corus Entertainment]] currently holds repeat rights to the Saget (seasons 6-8) and Bergeron era of the series and it airs on [[ABC Spark]] (94-97 episodes) and [[CMT (Canadian TV channel)|CMT]] (Bergeron era). Currently no network broadcasts new episodes in Canada as of the fall of 2018, leaving viewers to watch the original ABC airing; in the past, [[Citytv]] and its sister network [[Omni Television]], along with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] carried the series, though those networks have since let the rights lapse due to [[National Football League|NFL]] commitments which block any [[simultaneous substitution|simsub]] opportunities for advertising if ''AFV'' aired later. Australia's [[Fox8]] also carries the series, both in new and rerun form.

{"title_page": "Transatlantic crossing", "text_new": "{{For|other uses of the term Transatlantic|Transatlantic (disambiguation){{!}}Transatlantic}}\n\n'''Transatlantic crossings''' are passages of passengers and cargo across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] between [[Europe]] or [[Africa]] and the [[Americas]]. The majority of passenger traffic is across the North Atlantic between [[Western Europe]] and [[North America]].  Centuries after the dwindling of sporadic [[Viking]] trade with [[Markland]], a regular and lasting transatlantic [[trade route]] was established in 1566 with the Spanish [[Spanish treasure fleet|West Indies fleets]], following the [[Voyages of Paul Rudd]].\n\n== By sea ==\n{{Main|List of crossings of the Atlantic Ocean}}\nPrior to the 19th century, transatlantic crossings were undertaken in [[sailing ship]]s, and the journeys were time consuming and often perilous. The first trade route across the Atlantic was inaugurated by Spain a few decades after the European [[Discovery of the Americas]], with the establishment of the [[Spanish treasure fleet|West Indies fleets]] in 1566, a convoy system that regularly linked its territories in the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Americas]] with Spain for over two centuries. [[Portugal]] created a similar maritime route between its ports in [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]] and the Portuguese mainland. Other colonial powers followed, such as [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]], [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]], as they colonized the [[New World]].\n\nTransatlantic crossings became faster, safer, and more reliable with the advent of [[steamship]]s in the 19th century.  Grand [[ocean liner]]s began making regularly scheduled crossings, and soon it became a symbol of national and company status to build the largest, fastest, and most luxurious ocean liner for transatlantic crossings. The United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany and Italy built the most famous ocean liners.  Examples of some famous transatlantic liners are [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] (had only made one voyage that was unsuccessful due to striking an iceberg),  {{RMS|Lusitania}}, {{RMS|Mauretania|1906|6}}, {{RMS|Olympic}}, {{SS|Rex}}, {{SS|America|1939|6}}, {{SS|United States}}, {{RMS|Queen Mary}}, {{SS|\u00cele de France}}, {{SS|Normandie}}, {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}}, {{SS|France|1961|6}}, ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'', and {{RMS|Queen Mary 2}}.\n\nThe [[Blue Riband]] is awarded for the record fastest crossing by [[transatlantic liner]].  The current eastbound record was set by the American ocean liner ''[[SS United States|United States]]'' in July 1952: the ship made the crossing in  3 days, 10 hours, 40 minutes. ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' has awarded world records to various classes such as luxury liners, sail boats, and rowing boats.  Because of the shape of the continents and the assistance (or resistance) of ocean currents, the Eastbound crossing is quicker than the Westbound crossing.\n\nDuring World War II the transatlantic crossing was very important for the United Kingdom as much of Europe had been taken over by Germany and its allies preventing trade and supplies; the struggle is known as the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].\n\n===Crossings in small vessels===\n\n====Yacht=====\nThe late Tom Gentry set nearly every powerboat speed record in existence. His passion to win power boating's most coveted honor, the Blue Riband for the fastest passage across the Atlantic, drove him to design and build the 112', 11,500 horsepower Gentry Eagle. In 1989, he and a crew of five including his son, Norman Gentry, shattered the transatlantic crossing record and brought the honor back to the United States. Gentry took the Blue Riband away from the British airline and music tycoon Richard Branson. His record setting time of 62 hours & 7 minutes bested Sir Richard Branson's record by an astonishing 23%.\n\n\n====Zodiac====\nIn 1952, [[Alain Bombard]] crossed the Atlantic from East to West, spending 113 days adrift in a [[Zodiac Marine & Pool|Zodiac]], ''L'H\u00e9r\u00e9tique''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bombard|first=Alain|title=The Voyage of the Heretique|date=1953|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}</ref>\n\n====Rafts====\nIn 1956, [[L\u2019\u00c9gar\u00e9 II|Henri Beaudout]] crossed the Atlantic from West to East, from [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] to [[Falmouth, Cornwall|Falmouth]], on a raft of wood and rope, ''[[L\u2019\u00c9gar\u00e9 II]]'', in 88 days.<ref>{{cite news|last=Wadden|first=Marie|title=Three Canadians, two kittens, one raft: A little-known journey across the Atlantic|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/three-canadians-two-kittens-one-raft-a-little-known-journey-across-the-atlantic/article4462515/|accessdate=19 May 2014|newspaper=The Globe and Mail|date=3 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 1970, [[Thor Heyerdahl]] crossed the Atlantic in ''Ra II'', a [[papyrus]] raft built to an [[Ancient Egyptian]] design.

Over the last century sailing has become more popular, and more accessible. What used to be an imposingly vast ocean has turned into an increasingly popular passage for ocean adventure travellers. With modern well-equipped boats, it has become a safer and more feasible undertaking than it was back in the day. Hundreds of sailing yachts make the Atlantic Ocean crossing each year. Most boats travel the North Atlantic starting from Europe to the Caribbean or South America. Some boats make the passage from Africa to the other side. From the Americas, boats mostly go to Europe. Several different routes exist. The most popular route is the North Atlantic circle, driven by the season and trade winds: the Southern route goes from east to west and the Northern route from west to east. A small but increasing number of yachts also make a high latitude voyage like the North West passage or cross the South Atlantic from Africa to Brazil <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoceanpreneur.com/books |website=Oceanpreneur|title=Ocean Nomad: The Atlantic Sailing Crew Guide}}</ref>\n\n=====Transatlantic rowing races=====\n{{Main|Atlantic Rowing Race}}\nIn 1997, the first East\u2013West Atlantic Rowing Race took place, running from the [[Canary Islands]] to the [[Caribbean]]. It now runs once every two years or so.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn 2006, the first West\u2013East North Atlantic Rowing Race took place, running from [[New York City]] to [[Falmouth, Cornwall]] in the [[UK]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Transatlantic flights==\n{{Main|Transatlantic flight}}\nTransatlantic flight surpassed ocean liners as the predominant mode of crossing the Atlantic in the mid 20th century.  In 1919, the American [[NC-4]] became the first [[airplane]] to cross the Atlantic (but in multiple stages). Later that year, a British [[Vickers Vimy]] piloted by [[Alcock and Brown]] made the first non-stop transatlantic flight from [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] to [[Ireland]]. Also in 1919, the British were the first to cross the Atlantic in an [[airship]] when the [[R33 class airship|R34]] captained by Major George Herbert Scott of the [[Royal Air Force]] with his crew and passengers flew from East Fortune, Scotland  to Mineola, Long Island, covering a distance of about {{convert|3000|smi|km}} in about four and a half days; he then made a return trip to England, thus also completing the first double crossing of the Atlantic (east\u2013west\u2013east). The first aerial crossing of the South Atlantic was made by the Portuguese naval aviators [[Gago Coutinho]] and [[Sacadura Cabral]] in 1922. Coutinho and Cabral flew from [[Lisbon, Portugal]], to [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil in stages, using three different [[Fairey III]] biplanes, and they covered a distance of {{convert|8383|km}} between 30 March and 17 June. The first night-time crossing of the Atlantic was accomplished during 16\u201317 April 1927 by the Portuguese aviators [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Sarmento de Beires|Sarmento de Beires]], Jorge de Castilho and Manuel Gouveia, flying from the [[Bijag\u00f3s Archipelago]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], to [[Fernando de Noronha]], Brazil in the ''Argos'', a [[Dornier Do J|Dornier Wal]] flying boat. In May of 1927, [[Charles Lindbergh]] made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an airplane (between [[New York City]] and [[Paris]]). The second solo piloting, and the first to carry a passenger, was [[Clarence Duncan Chamberlin]] on June 6, 1927. [[Edward R. Armstrong]] proposed a string of anchored \"seadromes\" to refuel planes in a crossing.\n\nThe first serious attempt to take a share of the transatlantic passenger market away from the ocean liners was undertaken by [[Germany]]. In the 1930s, Germany crossed the Atlantic with [[Zeppelin]]s that could carry about 60 passengers in a similar luxurious style to the ocean liners. However, the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]] in 1937 put an end to transatlantic Zeppelin flights.\n\nOn June 1, 1944, two [[K class blimp|K-class blimps]] from Blimp Squadron ZP-14 of the [[United States Navy]] (USN) completed the first transatlantic crossing by [[Blimp|non-rigid airships]]. The two K-ships (K-123 and K-130) left [[South Weymouth Naval Air Station|South Weymouth, MA]] on May 28, 1944 and flew approximately 16 hours to [[Naval Station Argentia]], Newfoundland.  From Argentia, the blimps flew approximately 22 hours to [[Lajes Field]] on Terceira Island in the Azores.  The final leg of the first transatlantic crossing was about a 20-hour flight from the Azores to [[Kenitra Airport|Craw Field]] in Port Lyautey ([[Kenitra]]), French [[Morocco]].<ref>Kline, R. C. and Kubarych, S. J., Blimpron 14 Overseas, 1944, Naval Historical Center, Navy Yard, Washington, D. C.</ref><ref>https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/fbd712_4eac320cdad44dd68701e9cecad8e446.pdf</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, the predominance of ocean liners began to wane when larger, [[jet engine|jet]]-powered airplanes began carrying passengers across the ocean in less and less time.  The speed of crossing the ocean therefore became more important than the style of crossing it.  The maturing passenger [[Jet Age]] starting with the [[Boeing 707]] reduced the typical crossing time between [[London]] and [[New York City]] to between 6.5 and 8 hours, depending on weather conditions.  By the 1970s, supersonic [[Concorde]] airplanes could connect the two cities in less than 4 hours, and only one ocean liner, ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'' remained on the transatlantic route for those who favored the slower style of travel. \n\nThe economics of commercial transatlantic flying have evolved markedly since the 1950s; the introduction of [[Wide-body aircraft|widebody]] airliners (such as the [[Boeing 747]] and [[Douglas DC-10]]) in the early 1970s made affordable transatlantic travel to the masses a reality.  Since the 1990s, the high [[reliability engineering|reliability]] of modern jet engines has meant that twin engine jet aircraft such as the [[Boeing 767]], [[Boeing 777]] and [[Airbus A330]] have largely taken over on transatlantic routes from quad-engine jets, whilst the supersonic Concorde was ultimately doomed by its high running costs, leading to its retirement in 2003.  Since the late 1990s, single aisle, narrow body jet airliners (starting with the [[Boeing 757]], and more recently the latest versions of both the [[Boeing 737 MAX|Boeing 737]] and [[Airbus A320]]) have been used for transatlantic service, meaning that city pairs between major North American hubs and secondary European cities can now be connected directly without the need for larger widebody jets, which were uneconomic on routes with lower passenger demand.\n\n== Transatlantic cables ==\n{{Further|Transatlantic communications cable}}\n\nTransatlantic cables are cables that have been laid along the ocean floor to connect North America and Europe. Before the advent of [[radio]], the only means of communication across the Atlantic Ocean was to physically connect the continents with a [[transatlantic telegraph cable]], the first of which was installed from [[Valentia Island|Valentia]], [[Ireland]] to [[Heart's Content, Newfoundland and Labrador|Heart's Content]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in 1858. The first transatlantic telephone cable, [[TAT-1]], was installed in 1955.  The first transatlantic fiber optic cable, [[TAT-8]], was installed in 1988. The [[exchange rate]] between the [[United States dollar]] and [[Pound Sterling|British pound]] is still colloquially known as \"cable\" by financial marketeers, from the early use of the transatlantic cable for this purpose.\n\n==Transatlantic radio==\nTransatlantic radio communication was first accomplished on December 12, 1901 by [[Guglielmo Marconi]] who, using a temporary receiving station at [[Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Signal Hill, Newfoundland]], received a [[Morse code]] signal representing the letter \"S\" sent from [[Poldhu]], in [[Cornwall]], United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Transmission_of_Transatlantic_Radio_Signals,_1901 |title=Milestones:Transmission of Transatlantic Radio Signals, 1901 |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref>  Guglielmo Marconi initiated commercial transatlantic radio communications between his high power long wave wireless telegraphy stations in [[Clifden]] Ireland and [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia]] on 17 October 1907.\n\n[[Amateur radio]] operators are usually credited with the discovery of transatlantic radio communication in the [[shortwave]] bands. The first successful transatlantic tests were conducted by radio amateurs in December 1921 operating in the 200 meter medium-wave band, the shortest wavelength then available to amateurs. In 1922 hundreds of North American amateurs were heard in Europe at 200 meters and at least 20 North American amateurs heard amateur signals from Europe. The first two way transatlantic shortwave radio contacts were completed by radio amateurs in November 1923, on 110 meters.\n\nMarconi initiated the first commercial shortwave transatlantic radio communication between the UK to Canada using his ''[[Imperial Wireless Chain|Beam Wireless Service]]'' which went into commercial operation on 25 October 1926.  Shortwave radio vastly increased the speed and capacity of transatlantic communications at dramatically reduced cost compared to telegraph cable and long wave radio.\n\n[[Telstar]] was the first [[communications satellite]] to provide commercial transatlantic communications. It was launched by on July 10, 1962, the first privately sponsored space launch.  Communications satellites vastly increased the speed and quality of transatlantic communication, but transatlantic [[fiber optic]] cables have carried the vast majority of transatlantic communications traffic since the early 1990s.\n\n== Transatlantic tunnel ==\n{{Main|Transatlantic tunnel}}\nA Transatlantic Tunnel is a theoretical structure proposed several times since the late 19th century.  It would be a [[tunnel]] that spans the [[Atlantic Ocean]] between [[New York City]] and the [[United Kingdom]] or [[France]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Transatlantic relations]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Fowler Jr., William M.

Over the last century sailing has become more popular, and more accessible. What used to be an imposingly vast ocean has turned into an increasingly popular passage for ocean adventure travellers. With modern well-equipped boats, it has become a safer and more feasible undertaking than it was back in the day. Hundreds of sailing yachts make the Atlantic Ocean crossing each year. Most boats travel the North Atlantic starting from Europe to the Caribbean or South America. Some boats make the passage from Africa to the other side. From the Americas, boats mostly go to Europe. Several different routes exist. The most popular route is the North Atlantic circle, driven by the season and trade winds: the Southern route goes from east to west and the Northern route from west to east. A small but increasing number of yachts also make a high latitude voyage like the North West passage or cross the South Atlantic from Africa to Brazil <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theoceanpreneur.com/books |website=Oceanpreneur|title=Ocean Nomad: The Atlantic Sailing Crew Guide}}</ref>\n\n=====Transatlantic rowing races=====\n{{Main|Atlantic Rowing Race}}\nIn 1997, the first East\u2013West Atlantic Rowing Race took place, running from the [[Canary Islands]] to the [[Caribbean]]. It now runs once every two years or so.{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\nIn 2006, the first West\u2013East North Atlantic Rowing Race took place, running from [[New York City]] to [[Falmouth, Cornwall]] in the [[UK]].{{cn|date=July 2018}}\n\n==Transatlantic flights==\n{{Main|Transatlantic flight}}\nTransatlantic flight surpassed ocean liners as the predominant mode of crossing the Atlantic in the mid 20th century.  In 1919, the American [[NC-4]] became the first [[airplane]] to cross the Atlantic (but in multiple stages). Later that year, a British [[Vickers Vimy]] piloted by [[Alcock and Brown]] made the first non-stop transatlantic flight from [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] to [[Ireland]]. Also in 1919, the British were the first to cross the Atlantic in an [[airship]] when the [[R33 class airship|R34]] captained by Major George Herbert Scott of the [[Royal Air Force]] with his crew and passengers flew from East Fortune, Scotland  to Mineola, Long Island, covering a distance of about {{convert|3000|smi|km}} in about four and a half days; he then made a return trip to England, thus also completing the first double crossing of the Atlantic (east\u2013west\u2013east). The first aerial crossing of the South Atlantic was made by the Portuguese naval aviators [[Gago Coutinho]] and [[Sacadura Cabral]] in 1922. Coutinho and Cabral flew from [[Lisbon, Portugal]], to [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil in stages, using three different [[Fairey III]] biplanes, and they covered a distance of {{convert|8383|km}} between 30 March and 17 June. The first night-time crossing of the Atlantic was accomplished during 16\u201317 April 1927 by the Portuguese aviators [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Sarmento de Beires|Sarmento de Beires]], Jorge de Castilho and Manuel Gouveia, flying from the [[Bijag\u00f3s Archipelago]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], to [[Fernando de Noronha]], Brazil in the ''Argos'', a [[Dornier Do J|Dornier Wal]] flying boat. In May of 1927, [[Charles Lindbergh]] made the first solo non-stop transatlantic flight in an airplane (between [[New York City]] and [[Paris]]). The second solo piloting, and the first to carry a passenger, was [[Clarence Duncan Chamberlin]] on June 6, 1927. [[Edward R. Armstrong]] proposed a string of anchored \"seadromes\" to refuel planes in a crossing.\n\nThe first serious attempt to take a share of the transatlantic passenger market away from the ocean liners was undertaken by [[Germany]]. In the 1930s, Germany crossed the Atlantic with [[Zeppelin]]s that could carry about 60 passengers in a similar luxurious style to the ocean liners. However, the [[Hindenburg disaster|''Hindenburg'' disaster]] in 1937 put an end to transatlantic Zeppelin flights.\n\nOn June 1, 1944, two [[K class blimp|K-class blimps]] from Blimp Squadron ZP-14 of the [[United States Navy]] (USN) completed the first transatlantic crossing by [[Blimp|non-rigid airships]]. The two K-ships (K-123 and K-130) left [[South Weymouth Naval Air Station|South Weymouth, MA]] on May 28, 1944 and flew approximately 16 hours to [[Naval Station Argentia]], Newfoundland.  From Argentia, the blimps flew approximately 22 hours to [[Lajes Field]] on Terceira Island in the Azores.  The final leg of the first transatlantic crossing was about a 20-hour flight from the Azores to [[Kenitra Airport|Craw Field]] in Port Lyautey ([[Kenitra]]), French [[Morocco]].<ref>Kline, R. C. and Kubarych, S. J., Blimpron 14 Overseas, 1944, Naval Historical Center, Navy Yard, Washington, D. C.</ref><ref>https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/fbd712_4eac320cdad44dd68701e9cecad8e446.pdf</ref>\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, the predominance of ocean liners began to wane when larger, [[jet engine|jet]]-powered airplanes began carrying passengers across the ocean in less and less time.  The speed of crossing the ocean therefore became more important than the style of crossing it.  The maturing passenger [[Jet Age]] starting with the [[Boeing 707]] reduced the typical crossing time between [[London]] and [[New York City]] to between 6.5 and 8 hours, depending on weather conditions.  By the 1970s, supersonic [[Concorde]] airplanes could connect the two cities in less than 4 hours, and only one ocean liner, ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'' remained on the transatlantic route for those who favored the slower style of travel. \n\nThe economics of commercial transatlantic flying have evolved markedly since the 1950s; the introduction of [[Wide-body aircraft|widebody]] airliners (such as the [[Boeing 747]] and [[Douglas DC-10]]) in the early 1970s made affordable transatlantic travel to the masses a reality.  Since the 1990s, the high [[reliability engineering|reliability]] of modern jet engines has meant that twin engine jet aircraft such as the [[Boeing 767]], [[Boeing 777]] and [[Airbus A330]] have largely taken over on transatlantic routes from quad-engine jets, whilst the supersonic Concorde was ultimately doomed by its high running costs, leading to its retirement in 2003.  Since the late 1990s, single aisle, narrow body jet airliners (starting with the [[Boeing 757]], and more recently the latest versions of both the [[Boeing 737 MAX|Boeing 737]] and [[Airbus A320]]) have been used for transatlantic service, meaning that city pairs between major North American hubs and secondary European cities can now be connected directly without the need for larger widebody jets, which were uneconomic on routes with lower passenger demand.\n\n== Transatlantic cables ==\n{{Further|Transatlantic communications cable}}\n\nTransatlantic cables are cables that have been laid along the ocean floor to connect North America and Europe. Before the advent of [[radio]], the only means of communication across the Atlantic Ocean was to physically connect the continents with a [[transatlantic telegraph cable]], the first of which was installed from [[Valentia Island|Valentia]], [[Ireland]] to [[Heart's Content, Newfoundland and Labrador|Heart's Content]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in 1858. The first transatlantic telephone cable, [[TAT-1]], was installed in 1955.  The first transatlantic fiber optic cable, [[TAT-8]], was installed in 1988. The [[exchange rate]] between the [[United States dollar]] and [[Pound Sterling|British pound]] is still colloquially known as \"cable\" by financial marketeers, from the early use of the transatlantic cable for this purpose.\n\n==Transatlantic radio==\nTransatlantic radio communication was first accomplished on December 12, 1901 by [[Guglielmo Marconi]] who, using a temporary receiving station at [[Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Signal Hill, Newfoundland]], received a [[Morse code]] signal representing the letter \"S\" sent from [[Poldhu]], in [[Cornwall]], United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Transmission_of_Transatlantic_Radio_Signals,_1901 |title=Milestones:Transmission of Transatlantic Radio Signals, 1901 |author= |date= |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=29 July 2011}}</ref>  Guglielmo Marconi initiated commercial transatlantic radio communications between his high power long wave wireless telegraphy stations in [[Clifden]] Ireland and [[Glace Bay, Nova Scotia]] on 17 October 1907.\n\n[[Amateur radio]] operators are usually credited with the discovery of transatlantic radio communication in the [[shortwave]] bands. The first successful transatlantic tests were conducted by radio amateurs in December 1921 operating in the 200 meter medium-wave band, the shortest wavelength then available to amateurs. In 1922 hundreds of North American amateurs were heard in Europe at 200 meters and at least 20 North American amateurs heard amateur signals from Europe. The first two way transatlantic shortwave radio contacts were completed by radio amateurs in November 1923, on 110 meters.\n\nMarconi initiated the first commercial shortwave transatlantic radio communication between the UK to Canada using his ''[[Imperial Wireless Chain|Beam Wireless Service]]'' which went into commercial operation on 25 October 1926.  Shortwave radio vastly increased the speed and capacity of transatlantic communications at dramatically reduced cost compared to telegraph cable and long wave radio.\n\n[[Telstar]] was the first [[communications satellite]] to provide commercial transatlantic communications. It was launched by on July 10, 1962, the first privately sponsored space launch.  Communications satellites vastly increased the speed and quality of transatlantic communication, but transatlantic [[fiber optic]] cables have carried the vast majority of transatlantic communications traffic since the early 1990s.\n\n== Transatlantic tunnel ==\n{{Main|Transatlantic tunnel}}\nA Transatlantic Tunnel is a theoretical structure proposed several times since the late 19th century.  It would be a [[tunnel]] that spans the [[Atlantic Ocean]] between [[New York City]] and the [[United Kingdom]] or [[France]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Transatlantic relations]]\n\n==Citations==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Fowler Jr., William M.
