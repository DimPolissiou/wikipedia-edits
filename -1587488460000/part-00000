{"title_page": "List of science fiction authors", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{Speculative fiction sidebar|cTopic=Science fiction}}\nThis is an incomplete list of authors whose works of [[Speculative fiction|fantastic fiction]] would today be called science fiction, even if they predate or did not work in that genre. Some may also be considered [[List of fantasy authors|fantasy authors]], since many writers are equally comfortable with both genres, and since some works deliberately combine the two or blur the distinction. Most science fiction authors write as [[novelist]]s or [[short story]] writers, and more recently, often as [[playwright]]s or [[screen writer]]s.\n\nSome notable [[science fiction]]<!-- Not a compound adjective --> [[author]]s (in alphabetical order):\n\n{{compact ToC|top=yes|seealso=yes|extlinks=yes}}\n\n==A==\n<!-- NO REDLINKS PLEASE! -->\n[[File:CatherineAsaro2009.jpg|thumb|'''Catherine Asaro'''|upright]]\n[[File:Heinlein-decamp-and-asimov.jpg|thumb|[[Robert A.

By then, his father sent him to the Russian Air Force Academy, from which he graduated as a foreign cadet, and entered the IIAF in 1950 with the rank of first lieutenant.\n\nIn 1951, Jahanbani was selected to be sent to [[F\u00fcrstenfeldbruck Air Base]] in [[Germany]] to attend the jet pilot training school to become a pilot for the first Iranian jet fighter aircraft, the [[F-84 Thunderjet]], which was scheduled for delivery in 1955, along with 15 other pilots.

The chimpanzee and the closely related [[bonobo]] (sometimes called the \"pygmy chimpanzee\") are classified in the genus [[Pan (genus)|''Pan'']]. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that ''Pan'' is a [[sister taxon]] to the [[Human evolution|human lineage]] and is [[human]]s' closest living relative.\n\nThe chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair, but has a bare face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. It is larger and more [[Robustness (morphology)|robust]] than the bonobo, weighing {{convert|40|\u2013|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for males and {{convert|27|\u2013|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for females and standing {{convert|100|to|150|cm|ft|abbr=on}}. Its [[pregnancy|gestation]] period is eight months. The infant is weaned at about three years old, but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several years more. The chimpanzee lives in groups that range in size from 15 to 150 members, although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day. The species lives in a strict male-dominated hierarchy, where disputes are generally settled without the need for violence. Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded [[Tool use by animals|using tools]], modifying sticks, rocks, grass and leaves and using them for [[hunting]] and acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts and water. The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear small mammals.\n\nThe chimpanzee is listed on the [[IUCN Red List]] as an [[endangered]] species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range. The biggest threats to the chimpanzee are habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Chimpanzees appear in Western popular culture as stereotyped clown-figures, and have featured in entertainments such as [[chimpanzees' tea party|chimpanzees' tea parties]], circus acts and stage shows. They are sometimes kept as pets, though their strength and aggressiveness makes them dangerous in this role. Some hundreds have been kept in laboratories for research, especially in America. Many attempts have been made to teach languages such as [[American Sign Language]] to chimpanzees, with limited success.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English name \"chimpanzee\" is first recorded in 1738.<ref>{{cite web |title=chimpanzee|url=https://www.dictionary.com/browse/chimpanzee |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=2019-05-18}}</ref> It is derived from [[Vili language|Vili]] ''ci-mpenze''<ref>{{cite book |title=American Heritage Dictionary |date=2011 |edition=5th |chapter-url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=chimpanzee |access-date=31 August 2018 |chapter=chimpanzee |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company}}</ref> or [[Tshiluba language]] ''chimpenze'', with a meaning of \"[[ape]]\".<ref>{{cite web |title=chimpanzee |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/chimpanzee#etymonline_v_11268 |website=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=31 August 2018}}</ref> The colloquialism \"chimp\" was most likely coined some time in the late 1870s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/chimp |title=chimp definition &#124; Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=2009-06-06}}</ref> The genus name ''Pan'' derives from the [[Pan (god)|Greek god]], while the [[Specific name (zoology)|specific name]] ''troglodytes'' was taken from the [[Troglodytae]], a mythical race of cave-dwellers.<ref name=\"Corbey\"/><ref name=\"Stanford\"/>\n\n==Taxonomy and genetics==\nThe first great ape known to Western science in the 17th century was the \"[[orangutan|orang-outang]]\" (genus ''Pongo''), the local [[Malay language|Malay]] name being recorded in Java by the Dutch physician [[Jacobus Bontius]].

This allows them to easily corner the monkeys when chasing them in the appropriate direction. Chimps may also hunt as a coordinated team, so that they can corner their prey even in a continuous canopy. During an [[arboreal]] hunt, each chimp in the hunting groups has a role. \"Drivers\" serve to keep the prey running in a certain direction and follow them without attempting to make a catch. \"Blockers\" are stationed at the bottom of the trees and climb up to block prey that takes off in a different direction. \"Chasers\" move quickly and try to make a catch.

Chimpanzee habitats have been limited by [[deforestation]] in both West and Central Africa. Road building has caused habitat degradation and fragmentation of chimpanzee populations, and may allow [[poacher]]s more access to areas that had not been seriously affected by humans. Although deforestation rates are low in western Central Africa, selective logging may take place outside national parks.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\nChimpanzees are a common target for poachers. In Ivory Coast, chimpanzees make up 1\u20133% of [[bushmeat]] sold in urban markets. They are also taken, often illegally, for the pet trade, and are hunted for medicinal purposes in some areas. Farmers sometimes kill chimpanzees that threaten their crops; others are unintentionally maimed or killed by snares meant for other animals.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\nInfectious diseases are a main cause of death for chimpanzees. They succumb to many diseases that afflict humans, because the two species are so similar.

It has four confirmed subspecies and a fifth proposed subspecies. The chimpanzee and the closely related [[bonobo]] (sometimes called the \"pygmy chimpanzee\") are classified in the genus [[Pan (genus)|''Pan'']]. Evidence from fossils and DNA sequencing shows that ''Pan'' is a [[sister taxon]] to the [[Human evolution|human lineage]] and is [[human]]s' closest living relative.\n\nThe chimpanzee is covered in coarse black hair, but has a bare face, fingers, toes, palms of the hands, and soles of the feet. It is larger and more [[Robustness (morphology)|robust]] than the bonobo, weighing {{convert|40|\u2013|70|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for males and {{convert|27|\u2013|50|kg|lb|abbr=on}} for females and standing {{convert|100|to|150|cm|ft|abbr=on}}. Its [[pregnancy|gestation]] period is eight months. The infant is weaned at about three years old, but usually maintains a close relationship with its mother for several years more. The chimpanzee lives in groups that range in size from 15 to 150 members, although individuals travel and forage in much smaller groups during the day. The species lives in a strict male-dominated hierarchy, where disputes are generally settled without the need for violence. Nearly all chimpanzee populations have been recorded [[Tool use by animals|using tools]], modifying sticks, rocks, grass and leaves and using them for [[hunting]] and acquiring honey, termites, ants, nuts and water. The species has also been found creating sharpened sticks to spear small mammals.\n\nThe chimpanzee is listed on the [[IUCN Red List]] as an [[endangered]] species. Between 170,000 and 300,000 individuals are estimated across its range. The biggest threats to the chimpanzee are habitat loss, poaching, and disease. Chimpanzees appear in Western popular culture as stereotyped clown-figures, and have featured in entertainments such as [[chimpanzees' tea party|chimpanzees' tea parties]], circus acts and stage shows.

In the reanalysis, Terrace and Bever concluded that Nim's utterances could be explained merely as prompting on the part of the experimenters, as well as mistakes in reporting the data. \"Much of the apes' behavior is pure drill\", he said. \"Language still stands as an important definition of the human species.\" In this reversal, Terrace now argued Nim's use of ASL was not like human [[language acquisition]].

Chimpanzee habitats have been limited by [[deforestation]] in both West and Central Africa. Road building has caused habitat degradation and fragmentation of chimpanzee populations, and may allow [[poacher]]s more access to areas that had not been seriously affected by humans. Although deforestation rates are low in western Central Africa, selective logging may take place outside national parks.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\nChimpanzees are a common target for poachers. In Ivory Coast, chimpanzees make up 1\u20133% of [[bushmeat]] sold in urban markets. They are also taken, often illegally, for the pet trade, and are hunted for medicinal purposes in some areas. Farmers sometimes kill chimpanzees that threaten their crops; others are unintentionally maimed or killed by snares meant for other animals.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\nInfectious diseases are a main cause of death for chimpanzees. They succumb to many diseases that afflict humans, because the two species are so similar. As human populations grow, so does the risk of disease transmission between humans and chimpanzees.<ref name=\"iucn\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal |Animals |Mammals |Primates |Africa}}\n* {{annotated link|Anthropopithecus|''Anthropopithecus''}}\n* {{annotated link|Bili ape}}\n* {{annotated link|List of individual apes}}\n* {{annotated link|Prostitution among animals}}\n* {{annotated link|Theory of mind}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===General sources===\n*{{cite book | last=Goodall | first=Jane | authorlink=Jane Goodall | year=1986 | title=The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior | publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press | isbn=978-0-674-11649-8 | ref=harv | url=https://archive.org/details/chimpanzeesofgom00good}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category |Pan_troglodytes |Common chimpanzee}}\n{{Wikispecies |Pan troglodytes |Common Chimpanzee}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101124001529/http://www.discoverchimpanzees.org/ DiscoverChimpanzees.org]\n* [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/genome/guide/chimp/ Chimpanzee Genome resources]\n* [http://pin.primate.wisc.edu/factsheets/entry/chimpanzee Primate Info Net ''Pan troglodytes'' Factsheets]\n* [http://ecos.fws.gov/species_profile/servlet/gov.doi.species_profile.servlets.SpeciesProfile?spcode=A06C U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service Species Profile]\n* View the [http://www.ensembl.org/Pan_troglodytes/Info/Index/ common chimpanzee genome] in [[Ensembl]]\n* [http://humanorigins.si.edu/evidence/human-evolution-timeline-interactive Human Timeline (Interactive)] \u2013 [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], [[National Museum of Natural History]] (August 2016).\n{{Hominidae nav}}\n{{Apes}}\n\n{{Taxonbar |from=Q4126704}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:chimpanzee, common}}\n[[Category:Chimpanzees|common chimpanzee]]\n[[Category:Tool-using mammals]]\n[[Category:Primates of Africa]]\n[[Category:Extant Pliocene first appearances]]\n[[Category:Fauna of Sub-Saharan Africa]]\n[[Category:Mammals described in 1775|common chimpanzee]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]\n", "name_user": "2607:9880:2ca8:a8:5452:5eee:78a6:ec6f", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Fixed typo)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimpanzee"}

After starting to act in a London theatre club at the age of 15, he began his film career by playing [[Cedric Diggory]] in the fantasy film ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' (2005). He went on to star as [[Edward Cullen]] in the [[The Twilight Saga (film series)|film adaptations]] of the [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'' novels]], consisting of five films between 2008 and 2012, which earned a combined total of over $3.3 billion worldwide. It brought Pattinson worldwide fame and established him among the highest-paid actors in the world. In 2010, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named him one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]], and he was featured in the [[Forbes Celebrity 100]] list.\n\nAfter starring in the romantic dramas ''[[Remember Me (2010 film)|Remember Me]]'' (2010) and ''[[Water for Elephants (film)|Water for Elephants]]'' (2011), Pattinson eschewed roles in big-budget films in favour of independent productions helmed by auteurs, which have earned him critical acclaim. He played a manipulative billionaire in [[David Cronenberg]]'s thriller ''[[Cosmopolis (film)|Cosmopolis]]'' (2012), an aspiring actor in Cronenberg's satire ''[[Maps to the Stars]]'' (2014), an explorer in [[James Gray (film director)|James Gray]]'s adventure drama ''[[The Lost City of Z (film)|The Lost City of Z]]'' (2017), a bank robber in the [[Safdie Brothers]]' crime drama ''[[Good Time (film)|Good Time]]'' (2017), a criminal in a spaceship in [[Claire Denis]]' science fiction drama ''[[High Life (2018 film)|High Life]]'' (2018), and a troubled lighthouse keeper in [[Robert Eggers]]' horror film ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|The Lighthouse]]'' (2019).\n\nPattinson composes and plays his own music. He sang songs for the ''Twilight'' film series and the 2008 independent comedy-drama film ''[[How to Be]]''. Since 2015, Pattinson is the ambassador of the [[GO Campaign]], a nonprofit organization that raises awareness and funds to help orphans and vulnerable children around the world. He is also a supporter of the [[End Child Prostitution and Trafficking]] (ECPAT) campaign, [[Parents and Abducted Children Together]] (PACT), is a member of [[International Medical Corps]], and has shared details about cancer through [[Public service announcement|PSAs]] to raise awareness about the disease.\n\n==Early life==\nRobert Douglas Thomas Pattinson<ref>{{cite web|title=Getting to know the \"Twilight\" actors|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/getting-to-know-the-twilight-actors-1.3314180|website=Newsday.com|year=2008|accessdate=3 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120011322/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/getting-to-know-the-twilight-actors-1.3314180|archive-date=20 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/robert-pattison.html|title=Robert Pattinson Biography|website=The Biography Channel UK|publisher=[[The Biography Channel]].

After starting to act in a London theatre club at the age of 15, he began his film career by playing [[Cedric Diggory]] in the fantasy film ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire]]'' (2005). He went on to star as [[Edward Cullen]] in the [[The Twilight Saga (film series)|film adaptations]] of the [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'' novels]], consisting of five films between 2008 and 2012, which earned a combined total of over $3.3 billion worldwide. It brought Pattinson worldwide fame and established him among the highest-paid actors in the world. In 2010, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named him one of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]], and he was featured in the [[Forbes Celebrity 100]] list.\n\nAfter starring in the romantic dramas ''[[Remember Me (2010 film)|Remember Me]]'' (2010) and ''[[Water for Elephants (film)|Water for Elephants]]'' (2011), Pattinson eschewed roles in big-budget films in favour of independent productions helmed by auteurs, which have earned him critical acclaim. He played a manipulative billionaire in [[David Cronenberg]]'s thriller ''[[Cosmopolis (film)|Cosmopolis]]'' (2012), an aspiring actor in Cronenberg's satire ''[[Maps to the Stars]]'' (2014), an explorer in [[James Gray (film director)|James Gray]]'s adventure drama ''[[The Lost City of Z (film)|The Lost City of Z]]'' (2017), a bank robber in the [[Safdie Brothers]]' crime drama ''[[Good Time (film)|Good Time]]'' (2017), a criminal in a spaceship in [[Claire Denis]]' science fiction drama ''[[High Life (2018 film)|High Life]]'' (2018), and a troubled lighthouse keeper in [[Robert Eggers]]' horror film ''[[The Lighthouse (2019 film)|The Lighthouse]]'' (2019).\n\nPattinson composes and plays his own music. He sang songs for the ''Twilight'' film series and the 2008 independent comedy-drama film ''[[How to Be]]''. Since 2015, Pattinson is the ambassador of the [[GO Campaign]], a nonprofit organization that raises awareness and funds to help orphans and vulnerable children around the world. He is also a supporter of the [[End Child Prostitution and Trafficking]] (ECPAT) campaign, [[Parents and Abducted Children Together]] (PACT), is a member of [[International Medical Corps]], and has shared details about cancer through [[Public service announcement|PSAs]] to raise awareness about the disease.\n\n==Early life==\nRobert Douglas Thomas Pattinson<ref>{{cite web|title=Getting to know the \"Twilight\" actors|url=http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/getting-to-know-the-twilight-actors-1.3314180|website=Newsday.com|year=2008|accessdate=3 May 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120011322/http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/movies/getting-to-know-the-twilight-actors-1.3314180|archive-date=20 November 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/robert-pattison.html|title=Robert Pattinson Biography|website=The Biography Channel UK|publisher=[[The Biography Channel]].
