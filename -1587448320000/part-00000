The traditional economy was based on animal husbandry, wool, and silk production, augmented more recently by tourism.

Samazeuilh says that Lain\u00e9 was speaking metaphorically when he labeled Goust a \"republic,\" and that other writers took this literally (\"on a pris au s\u00e9rieux cette fantaisie du spirituel \u00e9crivain\").
