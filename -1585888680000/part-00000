Like his older brother Mircea II, Vlad III was an able military commander and now found himself opposing the Ottomans.\n\nRadu, at the age of 22, became a leading figure at the Ottoman court.

During his departure, he practised a [[scorched earth]] policy, leaving nothing of importance to be used by the pursuing Ottoman army. When the Ottoman forces approached T\u00e2rgovi\u0219te, they encountered over 20,000 of their kind [[impalement|impaled]] by the forces of Vlad III, creating a \"forest\" of dead or dying bodies on stakes.

Soon after, the Janissary under his command began attacks and raids on Vlad III's mountain stronghold on the [[Arge\u0219 River]], [[Poenari Castle]]. During his reign the Ottoman [[Sipahi]]'s gained a strong foothold in the south of the country.\n\nIn 7 March 1471, Radu fought the Battle of Soci against Stephen III, his future son-in-law, for possession of Chilia (now [[Kiliya]] in Ukraine).<ref>George Marcu (coord.), Enciclopedia b\u0103t\u0103liilor din istoria rom\u00e2nilor, Editura Meronia, Bucure\u015fti, 2011</ref> [[Old Church Slavonic in Romania|Slavo-Romanian chronicles]] relate that Stephen III had a \"war with Radu voivode for Soci\".

But instead of receiving help he found himself arrested and thrown into the dungeon over false charges of treason.\n\nAfter the victorious campaign north of the Danube, the Ottomans placed the young Radu (then 26 years of age) as the [[Bey]] of Wallachia. Soon after, the Janissary under his command began attacks and raids on Vlad III's mountain stronghold on the [[Arge\u0219 River]], [[Poenari Castle]]. During his reign the Ottoman [[Sipahi]]'s gained a strong foothold in the south of the country.\n\nIn 7 March 1471, Radu fought the Battle of Soci against Stephen III, his future son-in-law, for possession of Chilia (now [[Kiliya]] in Ukraine).<ref>George Marcu (coord.), Enciclopedia b\u0103t\u0103liilor din istoria rom\u00e2nilor, Editura Meronia, Bucure\u015fti, 2011</ref> [[Old Church Slavonic in Romania|Slavo-Romanian chronicles]] relate that Stephen III had a \"war with Radu voivode for Soci\". Stephen III's relationships with Radu were hostile. He invaded Wallachia on several occasions during Radu's reign, dethroning him four times in response to Radu's vassalage.<ref>Stephen the Great and Balkan Nationalism: Moldova and Eastern European History. Jonathan Eagles. I.B.Tauris, 25 October 2013</ref>\n\nIn 1473, following an agreement with the Ottomans, [[Basarab Laiot\u0103 cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n]] (Basarab Laiot\u0103 the Old) took over the throne. Between 1473 and 1475 Radu briefly returned twice to the throne.\n\n==Death==\nThe approximate date of his death is between 1475 and 1477. Different sources relate various dates. Most likely he was executed by Stephen III.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Romania}}\n* [[Mihnea Turcitul]]\n* [[Ilie II Rare\u0219]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-hou|[[House of D\u0103ne\u015fti]]||1437/1439||1456}}\n{{S-reg}}\n|-\n{{succession box|title= [[List of Wallachian rulers|Voivode of Wallachia]]\n| years    = 1462\u20131473\n| before   = [[Vlad III Dracula]]\n| after    = [[Basarab Laiot\u0103 cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n]]\n}}\n{{succession box|title= [[List of Wallachian rulers|Voivode of Wallachia]]\n| years    = 1473\u20131474\n| before   = [[Basarab Laiot\u0103 cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n]]\n| after    = [[Basarab Laiot\u0103 cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n]]\n}}\n{{succession box|title= [[List of Wallachian rulers|Voivode of Wallachia]]\n| years    = 1474\n| before   = [[Basarab Laiot\u0103 cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n]]\n| after    = [[Basarab Laiot\u0103 cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n]]\n}}\n{{succession box|title= [[List of Wallachian rulers|Voivode of Wallachia]]\n| years    = 1474\u20131475\n| before   = [[Basarab Laiot\u0103 cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n]]\n| after    = [[Basarab Laiot\u0103 cel B\u0103tr\u00e2n]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2018}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Radu III cel Frumos}}\n* {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216054837/http://www.xs4all.nl/~kvenjb/madmonarchs/vladdracula/vladdracula_bio.htm |date=16 December 2005 |title=Vlad the Impaler }}\n* [http://www.eliznik.org.uk/RomaniaHistory/wallachian-rulers.htm Wallachian Rulers]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080213095931/http://www.ici.ro/romania/en/istorie/hi92.html Wallachian Ruler Timeline]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Radu 03 The Fair}}\n[[Category:1437 births]]\n[[Category:1475 deaths]]\n[[Category:House of Dr\u0103cule\u0219ti]]\n[[Category:Rulers of Wallachia]]\n[[Category:Military personnel of the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:15th-century Romanian people]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "fixeddashesusing ascript, date formats perMOS:DATEFORMATbyscript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radu_cel_Frumos"}
