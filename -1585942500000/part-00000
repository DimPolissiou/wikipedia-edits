Since its formation in 1997<ref>{{cite web |title=Overview \u2013 The Ocean Project |url=https://theoceanproject.org/about-us/}}</ref>, The Ocean Project has grown from a handful of founding North American aquariums into the world's most extensive network for advancing ocean education and action. Its growing network includes more than 2,000 partner aquariums, zoos, science, technology, and natural history museums (ZAMS), youth groups, and other education and conservation organizations, in 140 countries that together serve hundreds of millions of visitors each year. The Ocean Project does not market itself, instead \"supporting and highlighting\" partners by broadcasting their \"innovative conservation-related activities.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Overview \u2013 The Ocean Project |url=https://theoceanproject.org/about-us/}}</ref>\n\nTo help its network of partners achieve their missions, The Ocean Project has conducted public opinion and market research since 1998. The Ocean Project works with its partners to apply the research, provide strategic communications insights, and implement innovative public engagement programs and campaigns to collaboratively create a better future.\n\nPrimary Strategies<ref>{{cite web |title=Overview \u2013 The Ocean Project |url=https://theoceanproject.org/about-us/}}</ref>:\n1) Enhance capacity at partner institutions\n- Support and empower the communications, education, outreach and activation capacities of ZAMs and other partners to effectively engage their members and visitors, as well as leaders in the public and private sectors\n2) Scale solutions within and beyond The Ocean Project network  \n- Develop and expand partner network, sharing successes and catalyzing more effective approaches, ensuring these efforts add maximum value to local, regional, national, and global conservation movements\n\n==Activities==\nThe Ocean Project seeks to complement and build upon the work of existing institutions and organizations and has three primary initiatives:\n\nPriority Initiatives:\n\n1) Collaborative Conservation Campaigns\nBased on 20 years of comprehensive public opinion and market research, The Ocean Project works in partnership with leading ZAMs and others to develop, implement, and evaluate innovative conservation campaigns.

Routledge (See Preface to the First Edition p. ix)</ref> Partridge returned to university between 1919 and 1921, when he received his BA.<ref name=Partridge1963p21/>\n\n==Career==\nAfter receiving his degree, Partridge became Queensland Travelling Fellow at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]],<ref name=Partridge1963p21/>  where he worked on both an MA on eighteenth-century English romantic poetry, and a B.Litt in comparative literature.<ref name=Partridge1963p26/> He subsequently taught in a grammar school in Lancashire for a brief interval, then in the two years beginning September 1925, took lecturing positions at the Universities of [[University of Manchester|Manchester]] and [[University of London|London]].<ref name=Crystal2002/><ref name=Partridge1969/> From 1923, he \"found a second home\", occupying the same desk (K1) in the [[British Library|British Museum Library]] (as it was then known) for the next fifty years. In 1925 he married Agnes Dora Vye-Parminter, who in 1933 bore a daughter, Rosemary Ethel Honeywood Mann.<ref name=Crystal2002/><ref name=CurrentBiography1964p316/> In 1927 he founded the [[Scholartis Press]], which he managed until it closed in 1931.<ref name=Partridge1963p27/> \n\nDuring the twenties he wrote fiction under the pseudonym 'Corrie Denison'; ''Glimpses'', a book of stories and sketches, was published by the Scholartis Press in 1928. The Scholartis Press published over 60 books in these four years,<ref name=Crystal2002/> including ''Songs and Slang of the British Soldier 1914-1918'', which Partridge co-authored with [[John Brophy (writer)|John Brophy]]. From 1932 he commenced writing in earnest.  His next major work on slang, ''Slang Today and Yesterday'', appeared in 1933, and his well-known ''[[Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English]]'' followed in 1937.<ref name=Crystal2002/>\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Partridge served in the [[Royal Army Educational Corps|Army Education Corps]], later transferring to the RAF's correspondence department, before returning to his British Museum desk in 1945.<ref name=Crystal2002/>\n\nPartridge wrote over forty books on the English language, including well-known works on [[etymology]] and [[slang]]. He also wrote novels under the pseudonym Corrie Denison, and books on [[tennis]], which he played well.
