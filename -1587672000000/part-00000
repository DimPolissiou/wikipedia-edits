Life has never been better: with gourmet food; plush beds; clean clothes; games; and the love from their \"Mom\", the caretaker, Isabella. The bright and cheerful Emma always aces the regular exams with her two best friends, Ray and Norman. The orphans are allowed complete freedom, except to venture beyond the grounds or the gate, which connects the house to the outside world.\n\nOne night, an orphan named Conny is sent away to be adopted, but Emma and Norman followed her after noticing that she left her stuffed toy, Little Bunny, back at the house. At the gate, they find Conny dead, and they realize the truth of their existence in this idyllic orphanage\u2014to be \"humanely\" raised, eventually butchered, and sold as meat to a \"higher\" species which were identified as \"demons\" throughout the series. Determined to break out of Grace Field House, Norman and Emma join with Ray to find a way to escape along with their other siblings.\n\n==Media==\n===Manga===\n{{See also|List of The Promised Neverland chapters}}\n[[Kaiu Shirai]] and Posuka Demizu launched ''The Promised Neverland'' in the 34th issue of [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Sh\u014dnen manga|sh\u014dnen]]'' [[manga]] magazine ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' on August 1, 2016.

{"title_page": "Nazism and the Wehrmacht", "text_new": "{{Nazism sidebar}}\nThe relationship between the [[Wehrmacht]], the regular combined armed forces of [[Nazi Germany]], and the regime it served have been the subject of a voluminous historiographical debate. Broadly speaking, there have been two camps. The [[myth of the clean Wehrmacht]] claims that the Wehrmacht had minimal participation in war crimes and genocide. More recently, scholarship has emerged demonstrating that [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht|the Wehrmacht was complicit]] in [[the Holocaust]].\n\n== Politics of the Wehrmacht ==\nThe German military had traditionally functioned as a \"[[state within a state]]\" with a very large margin of institutional autonomy.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=6\u20137}} Thus Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] had been forbidden to attend meetings of the Supreme Council of War because as it was insultingly phrased \"Lest this civilian might betray the secrets of the State\".{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=8}} In the First World War, the military began to complain more and more that both the Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] and the Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] were grossly incompetent, and needed to step aside in order to allow the military to win the war.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=13}}\n\nIn March\u2013April 1915, Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] stated that the only thing that was keeping Germany from winning the war was the poor leadership of the Chancellor and the Emperor. His solution was a plan in which Bethmann-Hollweg would be sacked and the office of Chancellor abolished; the Kaiser would \"temporarily\" abdicate; and Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] be given the new office of \"Dictator of the ''Reich''\", concentrating all political and military power into his hands in order to win the war.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=13}} Though the Tirpitz plan was not implemented, the very fact it was mooted showed the extent of military dissatisfaction with the existing leadership, and the strength of the \"state within the state\" in that Tirpitz was not punished despite having essentially called for deposing the Emperor.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=13}} In August 1916, Germany became a ''de facto'' military dictatorship under the duumvirate of Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] and General [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]], who ruled Germany until 1918.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=13\u201314}} During the rule of the \"silent dictatorship\" of Hindenburg and Ludendorff, the German government advocated a set of imperialist war aims calling for the annexation of most of Europe and Africa that in many ways were a prototype for the war aims of the Second World War.<ref>Hillgruber, Andreas ''Germany and the Two World Wars'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1981 pages 41\u201345.</ref>\n\n===Aftermath of World War I===\n\nIn October 1918, in order to avoid responsibility for losing the First World War, the military returned power to the civilians and transformed Germany into a democracy, largely because the Allies made it clear that they would never sign an armistice with the Hindenburg-Ludendorff duumvirate.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=16}} After the November Revolution of 1918, there were demands for the dissolution of the military that had led to such a defeat, but on December 23, 1918, the Provisional government under [[Friedrich Ebert]] came under attack from the radical left-wing \"People's Marine Division\".{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=32\u201333}} Ebert called General [[Wilhelm Groener|Wilhelm Gr\u00f6ner]] for help, and what resulted was the so-called [[Ebert\u2013Groener pact]], where in return for saving the government, the military would be allowed to retain its traditional and informal \"state within the state\" status.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=33\u201334}}{{sfn|Shirer|p=54}} To fulfil his side of the deal, Gr\u00f6ner created a new force of volunteers, the ''[[Freikorps]]'' to protect the government.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=36}} In return for crushing the Communist [[Spartacus League]] in early January 1919 with its new ''Freikorps'' units, the government ended all efforts to democratize the military later that month.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=42}} Under the constitution of the [[Weimar Republic]], no soldier of the ''Reichswehr'' was allowed to be a member of a political party nor to vote in an election.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Weimar Republic===\nIn the 1920s, the military did not accept the democratic Weimar Republic as legitimate, and so the ''Reichswehr'' under the leadership of [[Hans von Seeckt]] became, even more so than under the monarchy, a \"state within the state\" that operated largely outside the control of politicians.{{sfn|Kolb|p=172}} During the [[Kapp Putsch]] of March 1920, Seeckt disobeyed orders from the Defence Minister [[Gustav Noske]], the Chancellor [[Gustav Bauer]] and the ''Reich'' President [[Friedrich Ebert]] to suppress the ''putsch'', claiming \"There can be no question of sending the ''Reichswehr'' to fight these people\".{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=76}} Seeckt's actions were entirely illegal as under the Weimar constitution the President was the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, and moreover Seeckt had violated the ''[[Reichswehreid]]'', which committed the military to defend the republic.<ref>Nicholls, A.J. ''Weimar and the Rise of Hitler'', London: Macmillan, 2000, pages 69\u201370.</ref> Seeckt ordered the military to disregard Ebert's orders to defend the republic, and instead assumed a stance of apparent neutrality, which in effect meant siding with the Kapp ''putsch'' by depriving the government of the means of defending itself. The position of the military as \"state within the state\" led to only those few officers and soldiers who had attempted to defend the republic being dismissed, and the officers led by Seeckt who had done nothing to defend the republic were allowed to continue with their jobs.<ref>Nicholls, A.J. ''Weimar and the Rise of Hitler'', London: Macmillan, 2000, page 71.</ref> The same officers who violated the ''Reichswehreid'' during the Kapp ''putsch'' by disobeying Ebert's orders to suppress the putsch were later to claim that the [[Hitler oath]] made it impossible for them to resist the Nazi regime.\n\nRight from the onset, Seeckt made it clear that he expected to see another world war based on the French political atmosphere concerning German failure to meet the Treaty of Versailles restitution payments. His famous \"Memo on the Russian Question\" of September 11, 1922, arguing the benefits of an alliance with England or Russia, noted that, \"We should be quite clear as to France's attitude. She is following a policy of annihilation pure and simple, which she must follow in pursuance of the unshakable principles of her policy. The hope that economic decisions may divert French policy into another course can be discounted altogether, quite apart from the fact that it is doubtful whether in any case, the economic strengthening of Germany would be in the interests of the ruling industrial circles of France. The contrary appears to be the case, and the French economic interests have the same object as the purely political, that is, the annihilation of Germany. This aim is not affected by the consideration that the debtor, already insolvent, will become even less able to pay up. France no longer expects payment, and in fact, does not want it as it would upset her political plans.... The whole policy of reconciliation and appeasement towards France ... is hopeless in as far as it aims at political success. The question of orientation towards the West, as far as France is concerned, is ruled out. French policy is not quite indifferent as to whether we ally ourselves with Russia or not, for in either case the complete destruction of Germany, not yet fully brought about, remains her objective, and this aim would be more difficult to achieve if Germany were supported by Russia.\"\n\nSeeckt's memo goes on to cite the unacceptability of the creation of Poland by the Treaty of Versailles as another reason for the coming war: \"With Poland [sic] we come now to the core of the Eastern problem. The existence of Poland is intolerable and incompatible with Germany's vital interests. She must disappear and will do so through her own inner weakness and through Russia - with our help. Poland is more intolerable for Russia than for ourselves; Russia can never tolerate Poland. With [sic] Poland collapses one of the strongest pillars of the Peace of Versailles, France's advance post of power. The attainment of this objective must be one of the firmest guiding principles of German policy, as it is capable of achievement - but only through Russia or with her help. Poland can never offer Germany any advantage, either economically, because she is incapable of development, or politically, because she is a vassal state of France. The restoration of the frontier between Russia and Germany is a necessary condition before both sides can become strong. The 1914 frontier between Russia and Germany should be the basis of any understanding between the two countries.\"\n\nThe memo then goes on to cite the necessity of war: \"The man who still lives in the days of Versailles, and maintains that Germany has permanently abjured all 'imperialist and military aims', that is, stripped of its demogogic [sic] jargon, all policy of action, is not fit to represent German interests in Russia, nor perhaps anywhere else.... Germany today is certainly not in a position to resist France. Our policy should be to prepare the means of doing so in the future.... The German nation, with its Socialist majority, would be averse from a policy of action, which has to reckon with the possibility of war. It must be admitted that the spirit surrounding the Peace Delegation at Versailles has not yet disappeared, and that the stupid cry of 'No more war! ' is widely echoed. It is echoed by many bourgeois-pacifist elements, but among the workers and also among the members of the official Social Democrat Party there are many who are not prepared to eat out of the hands of France and Poland. It is true that there is a widespread and understandable need for peace among the German people. The clearest heads, when considering the pros and cons of war, will be those of the military, but to pursue a policy means to take the lead. In spite of everything, the German people will follow the leader in the struggle for their existence. Our task is to prepare for this struggle, for we shall not be spared it. If it comes to war - and that seems to be already within measurable distance - it will not be the duty of our leading statesmen to keep Germany out of war - that would be either impossible or suicidal - but to come in on the right side with all possible strength.\"{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=133\u2013138}} After meeting [[Adolf Hitler]] on March 11, 1923, Seeckt wrote: \"We were one in our aim; only our paths were different\".{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=118|loc=n. 1}}\n\nIn 1927, the Phoebus film studio went bankrupt.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=188}} Subsequently, bankruptcy proceedings established that the studio was a front company created by the ''Reichsmarine'' to obtain nitrate and that the navy had poured millions of Reichmarks to subsidize the financially struggling studio over the last few years.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=188}} These disclosures of his knowledge of this matter forced the Defence Minister [[Otto Gessler]] to resign in disgrace in January 1928.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=188}} The military took advantage of the opening created by Gessler's resignation to convince President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] to impose General [[Wilhelm Groener|Wilhelm Gr\u00f6ner]] as the new Defence minister.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=188}} Gessler was the last civilian Defence minister of the Weimar Republic, and until the abolition of the War ministry by Hitler in 1938, every Defence/War minister was a serving general. The practice of having active duty generals run the Bendlerstrasse (the street in Berlin where the Defence/War ministry was located) in turn further weakened the already weak civilian control of the military, and also led to further politicization of the military since through their representative in the Cabinet the military become involved in issues that had nothing to do with military matters (though that the fact that Cabinet virtually stopped meeting after 1934 did weaken this venue of exercising power).\n\nReflecting this position as a \"state within the state\", the ''Reichswehr'' created the ''Ministeramt'' or Office of the Ministerial Affairs in 1928 under General [[Kurt von Schleicher]] to [[lobbying|lobby]] politicians ostensibly for improved military budgets, but in fact the ''Ministeramt'' was the vehicle for military interference with politics.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=198}} German historian [[Eberhard Kolb]] wrote that:<blockquote>\"...from the mid-1920s onwards the Army leaders had developed and propagated new social conceptions of a militarist kind, tending towards a fusion of the military and civilian sectors and ultimately a totalitarian military state (''Wehrstaat'')\".{{sfn|Kolb|p=173}}</blockquote> In 1926, Seeckt was ousted by the so-called \"modern\" fraction within the ''Reichswehr'' as a group of more technocratic officers were known, which saw Seeckt as too conservative as he was less willing to see the sort of radical reorganization of German society that the \"modern\" fraction wanted.{{sfn|Kolb|p=173}} What the German military wanted to see above all was the ''Wiederwehrhaftmachung'' of Germany, namely the total militarization of German society in order to fight a [[total war]] and thus ensure that Germany did not lose the next war.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|p=267}} As such, what both the Nazis and the German Army wanted to see was Germany remade into a totally militarized ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' that would be ruthlessly purged of those considered to be internal enemies, such as the [[Jews]] who were believed to have \"stabbed\" Germany in \"the back\" in 1918.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|p=268}}\n\nMany officers in the early 1930s started to express admiration for National Socialism, which they saw as the best way of creating the much desired ''Wehrstaat'' (military state).<ref name=\"Nicholls, A.J. pages 163-164\" /> An important sign of the sympathy for National Socialism within the military came in September\u2013October 1930, with the trial in [[Leipzig]] of three junior officers, Lieutenant {{Interlanguage link multi|Richard Scheringer|de}}, Hans Friedrich Wendt and [[Hanns Ludin|Hans Ludin]]. The three men were charged with membership in the [[Nazi Party]]; at that time membership in political parties was forbidden for members of the ''Reichswehr''. The three officers openly admitted to Nazi Party membership and used it as their defence to claim that the Nazi Party membership should not be forbidden to ''Reichswehr'' personnel. When the three officers were caught [[In flagrante delicto|red-handed]] distributing Nazi literature at their base, their commanding officer, General [[Ludwig Beck]] (of the 5th [[Artillery]] Regiment based in [[Ulm]]), was furious at their arrest, and argued that since the Nazi Party was a force for good, ''Reichswehr'' personnel should be allowed to join the Party.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=217}} At the Leipzig trial of Ludin and Scheringer, Beck and other officers testified about the good character of the accused, described the Nazi Party as a positive force in German life, and proclaimed his belief that the ''Reichswehr'' ban on Nazi Party membership should be rescinded. The trial in Leipzig caused a media sensation and Hitler himself testified at the trial about how much Nazi and ''Reichswehr'' values were one and the same.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=216\u2013219}} After the trial, many ''Reichswehr'' officers started to favour the NSDAP.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=220\u2013223}}\n\nBy 1931, Germany's reserves of experienced reservists were coming to an end, because Part V of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] forbade [[conscription]] and  existing reservists were ageing.<ref name=\"Nicholls, A.J. page 163\">Nicholls, A.J.

Schleicher and other ''Reichswehr'' generals made secret contacts with the SA leadership starting in 1931.<ref name=\"Nicholls, A.J. page 163\" /> Like the rest of the ''Reichswehr'' leadership, Schleicher viewed democracy as a great impediment to military power, and firmly believed that only a dictatorship could make Germany a great military power again.<ref name=\"Nicholls, A.J. pages 163-164\">Nicholls, A.J. ''Weimar and the Rise of Hitler'', New York: St. Martin's Press, 2000, pages 163\u2013164.</ref> Thus Schleicher worked to replace the democracy with a dictatorship headed by himself. In this way, Schleicher played a key role in the downfall of the Weimar Republic and unintentionally helped to bring about Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Kolb|p=126}}\n\n===Nazis rise to power===\n\nThe military played a major role in January 1933 in persuading President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] to dismiss Schleicher and appoint Hitler as Chancellor.{{sfn|Geyer|pp=122\u2013123}} The reasons for this was by January 1933 that it was clear that the Schleicher government could only stay in power by proclaiming martial law, and by sending the ''Reichswehr'' to crush popular opposition. In doing so, the military would have to kill hundreds, if not thousands of German civilians; any regime established in this way could never expect to build the national consensus necessary to create the ''Wehrstaat''.{{sfn|Geyer|pp=122\u2013123}} The military had decided that Hitler alone was capable of peacefully creating the national consensus that would allow the creation of the ''Wehrstaat'', and thus the military successfully brought pressure on Hindenburg to appoint Hitler Chancellor.{{sfn|Geyer|pp=122\u2013123}}\n\nDespite their sympathy and approval of the Nazi regime, the military leadership was in the early years of the ''Third Reich'' determined to defend their position as a \"state within the state\" against all rivals. In January 1934, when the Army commander [[Kurt von Hammerstein]] resigned, Hitler's choice for Hammerstein's successor General [[Walter von Reichenau]] was vetoed by the Army officer corps with the support of President von Hindenburg under the grounds that Reichenau was too much a military radical, and so [[Werner von Fritsch]] was chosen as a compromise.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=301\u2013303}}\n\nA more serious trial of strength concerned the military and the SA. By 1934, the generals were fearful of [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]]'s desire to have the SA, a force of over 3 million men, absorb the much smaller German Army into its ranks under his leadership. Further, reports of a huge cache of weapons in the hands of SA members gave the army commanders great concern.<ref>Kershaw, ''Hitler'', p 306.</ref> Matters came to a head in June 1934 when President von Hindenburg, who had the complete loyalty of the ''Reichswehr'', informed Hitler that if he did not move to curb the SA then Hindenburg would dissolve the Government and declare [[martial law]].{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=319\u2013320}} The ''Reichswehr'' leadership also pressured Hitler to act against the SA by threatening to block his plans for merging the offices of the Chancellorship and the Presidency after the soon to be expected death of the gravely ill Hindenburg.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=309\u2013314}} The result was the [[Night of the Long Knives]] which began on June 30, 1934, and led to the execution of the majority of the SA leadership, much to the barely veiled glee of the military.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=320\u2013323}}\n\nBritish historian A.J. Nicholls wrote that the popular stereotype of the German military in the 1920s\u20131930s as old-fashioned reactionary ''[[Junker (Prussia)|Junkers]]'' is incorrect, and a disproportionate number of officers had a technocratic bent, and instead of looking back to the Second Reich looked with confidence towards a new dynamic, [[high-tech]] and revolutionary future dominated by men like themselves.<ref name=\"Nicholls, A.J. pages 163-164\" /> The more technocratic the officer, the more likely he was to be a National Socialist.<ref name=\"Nicholls, A.J. pages 163-164\" /> Israeli historian [[Omer Bartov]] wrote that most officers were National Socialists \"because they believed had it not been for [Hitler] they would never have been able to realize their dreams of a highly modern, total war of expansion\".{{sfn|Bartov|1999|p=145}}\n\n===Growing alignment with Nazism===\nAs part of an effort to preserve the \"state within a state\", starting in the mid-1930s, the military began to more and more Nazify itself in an effort to persuade Hitler that it was not necessary to end the traditional \"state within a state\", to prevent ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' (\"synchronization\") being imposed by engaging in what [[Omer Bartov]] called a process of \"self-Gleichschaltung\".{{sfn|Bartov|1999|p=143}} As part and parcel of the process of \"self-Gleichschaltung\", the Defence Minister [[Werner von Blomberg]] in February 1934, acting on his own initiative, had all of the Jews serving in the ''Reichswehr'' given an automatic and immediate [[dishonorable discharge]].{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|p=268}} In this way, 74 Jewish soldiers lost their jobs for no other reason than that they were Jewish.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|p=268}} Again, on his own initiative Blomberg had the ''Reichswehr'' in May 1934 adopt Nazi symbols into their uniforms.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=312}} In August 1934, again on Blomberg's initiative and that of the ''Ministeramt'' chief General [[Walther von Reichenau]], the entire military took an [[Hitler oath|oath of personal loyalty]] to Hitler, who was most surprised at the offer; the popular view that Hitler imposed the oath on the military is false.<ref name=\"Kershaw, Ian page 525\">Kershaw, Ian ''Hitler Hubris'', New York: W.W. Norton, 1998 page 525.</ref> The intention of Blomberg and Reichenau in having the military swear an oath to Hitler was to create a personal special bond between Hitler and the military, which was intended to tie Hitler more tightly towards the military and away from the NSDAP.<ref name=\"Kershaw, Ian page 525\" /> The American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] wrote about the oath to Hitler: <blockquote>The assertion that most felt bound by their oath of loyalty to Hitler should be seen in the context of prior oaths and subsequent oaths taken and broken by the same individuals, especially in the highest ranks. They had sworn to uphold the Weimar constitution, and many had sworn to uphold its laws-which included the Versailles Treaty. It was considered desirable, even honourable, to break this oath as often as possible, and anyone who wanted to keep it was despised. After World War II, a substantial number of the military leaders were called on to testify under oath. Anyone who has studied their sworn testimony carefully will have noticed that many took this oath very lightly indeed. If of all the oaths generals and field marshals took, only the one to Hitler is so often cited, that may reveal more about their attitude toward Hitler than towards oaths.{{sfn|Weinberg|pp=481\u2013482}}</blockquote>\n\nThe unintentional effect of these measures to defend the \"state within a state\" by \"self-Gleichschaltung\" was to ultimately weaken such a status.{{sfn|Bartov|1999|p=143}} At the same time, a new generation of technocratic officers was coming to the fore which was less concerned about maintaining the \"state within a state\", and more comfortable about being integrated into the National Socialist ''Wehrstaat''. Bartov wrote about the new sort of technocratic officers and their views about the Nazi regime:<blockquote>The combined gratification of personal ambitions, technological obsessions and nationalist aspirations greatly enhanced their identification with Hitler's regime as individuals, professionals, representatives of a caste and leaders of a vast conscript army. Men such as Beck and Guderian, Manstein and Rommel, Doenitz and Kesselring, Milch and Udet cannot be described as mere soldiers strictly devoted to their profession, rearmament and the autonomy of the military establishment while remaining indifferent to and detached from Nazi rule and ideology. The many points of contact between Hitler and his young generals were thus important elements in the integration of the Wehrmacht into the Third Reich, in stark contradiction of its image as a \"haven\" from Nazism.{{sfn|Bartov|1999|p=145}}</blockquote>\n\nBecause of these conceptions of Germany being remade into a totalitarian ''Wehrstaat'', the leadership of the military welcomed and embraced the National Socialist regime.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|pp=267\u2013268}} The German historian [[J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster]] wrote that it was wrong as many historians have to dismiss the Wehrmacht's self-proclaimed role as one of the \"twin pillars\" of Nazi Germany (the other pillar being the NSDAP).{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|pp=267\u2013268}} General [[Ludwig Beck]] welcomed the coming of the Nazi regime in 1933, writing \"I have wished for years for the political revolution, and now my wishes have come true. It is the first ray of hope since 1918.\".{{sfn|May|p=33}} (Beck was later executed for opposing National Socialism.) In addition, many soldiers had previously been in the [[Hitler Youth]] and ''[[Reichsarbeitsdienst]]'' and had thus been subjected to intensive Nazi indoctrination; as a result, many newly commissioned officers were committed Nazis. In general, the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (airforce) was heavily Nazi-influenced, as were the navy and army to a lesser degree, though that was only relative.{{cn|date=December 2019}} Caitlin Talmadge explains that Prussian martial tradition gave Hitler an advantage when it came to his officer corps. While most dictatorships had to make a trade-off between competence and loyalty when selecting their officers (due to the risk of facing a coup), Hitler found he had an ample supply of men who possessed both attributes, significantly reducing the coup risk Hitler faced from building an effective army. However, as the successor to a conventionally oriented imperial army of the German Empire, the Wehrmacht tended to fight more effectively than the Waffen-SS, as, within the SS, adherence to Nazism mattered more for advancement. Despite this, Hitler regretted not having purged his officer corps the way [[The Great Purge|Stalin did]].<ref>Talmadge, Caitlin.

Cornell University Press, 2015, p.256</ref>\n\nThe [[Blomberg\u2013Fritsch Affair]] of January\u2013February 1938 that ended with the dismissals of [[Werner von Fritsch]] as Army commander and [[Werner von Blomberg]] as War Minister was the first Nazi attempt to undermine the position of the military as a \"state within the state\".<ref name=\"Kallis, Aristotle page 89\">Kallis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge 2000 page 89.</ref> At the same time, Hitler abolished the War Ministry and replaced it with the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]].<ref name=\"Kallis, Aristotle page 89\" /> The Blomberg-Fritsch Affair marked the moment when the leadership of the military began to change from the leaders of a more or less autonomous \"state within the state\" to that of a merely functional, technocratic elite that existed only to execute the F\u00fchrer's plans.<ref name=\"Kallis, Aristotle page 89\" /> In one of the last demonstrations of the power of the \"state within the state\", the Army again vetoed Hitler's plans to appoint [[Walter von Reichenau]] as Army commander, and following tense negotiations between Hitler and [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], who was acting as the Army's spokesman in this matter and who wanted [[Ludwig Beck]] as Fritsch's successor, agreed to [[Walter von Brauchitsch]] as a compromise.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=370\u2013371}}\n\nOn December 8, 1938, the OKW had instructed all officers in all three services to be thoroughly versed in National Socialism and to apply its values in all situations. Starting in February 1939, pamphlets were issued that were made required reading in the military.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|p=270}} The content can be gauged by the titles: \"Hitler's World Historical Mission\", \"The Battle for German Living Space\", \"Hands off Danzig!\", and \"The Final Solution of the Jewish Question in the Third Reich\".

On March 3, 1941, Hitler summoned the entire military leadership to hear a secret speech about the upcoming [[Operation Barbarossa]] in which Hitler stressed that Barbarossa was to be a \"war of extermination\", that the German military was to disregard all the laws of war, and that he both expected and wanted to see the deaths of millions of people.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=190}} With the exception of Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]], who protested that this was both morally and legally wrong, none of the officers who heard Hitler's speech voiced any objections.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=190}}\n\nSince some of the officers, such as General [[Franz Halder]], who had previously argued with Hitler about military matters remained silent after hearing this speech, [[John Wheeler-Bennett]]  presumes that they had no objections to the sort of war that Hitler intended to wage.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=513}} In 1989, British historian [[Richard J.

It is the old battle of the Germanic against the Slavic people, of the defense of European culture against Muscovite-Asiatic inundation and of the repluse [sic] of Jewish Bolshevism. The objective of this battle must be the demolition of present-day Russia and must, therefore, be conducted with unprecedented severity. Every military action must be guided in planning and execution by an iron resolution to exterminate the enemy remorselessy [sic] and totally. In particular no adherents of the contemporary Russian Bolshevik system are to be spared.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1989|pp=500\u2013501}}</blockquote> Very typical of the German Army propaganda as part of the preparations for Barbarossa was the following passage from a pamphlet issued in June 1941:\n\n{{quote|Anyone who has ever looked into the face of a Red commissar knows what the Bolsheviks are. There is no need here for theoretical reflections. It would be an insult to animals if one were to call the features of these, largely Jewish, tormentors of people beasts.

Across the breadth of European Russia, the invading Germans took matters into their own hands, as Hitler intended. Einsatzgruppen were responsible for the great bulk of the killing, but they received full cooperation from the Army. At [[Babi Yar Massacre|Babi Yar]] outside of Kiev, SS-Sonderkommando 4a murdered 33,771 Jews and other Soviet citizens in a two-day orgy of violence in revenge for Soviet destruction of Kiev. The local army commander, Major General Kurt Eberhard, cooperated enthusiastically, even providing the SS with an army propaganda company to persuade Kiev's Jews that they were moving for resettlement. On numerous occasions, troop commanders ordered their men to participate in \"special actions\" against Jews and Communists. The repetitive nature of such orders suggests the level of cooperation between SS and Army that occurred throughout the German advance. Everywhere the Germans advanced, the tide of murder, violence, and destruction followed, on Jews above all, but on the Soviet population in general.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=141}}</blockquote>\n\n===National Socialists within the armed forces===\nThe British historian [[Richard J. Evans]] wrote that junior officers in the Army were inclined to be especially zealous National Socialists with a third of them having joined the Nazi Party by 1941.{{sfn|Evans|p=59}} Reinforcing the work of the junior leaders were the National Socialist Leadership Guidance Officers, which were created with the purpose of indoctrinating the troops for the \"war of extermination\" against Soviet Russia.{{sfn|Evans|p=59}} Among higher-ranking officers, 29.2% were NSDAP members by 1941.{{sfn|Bartov|1986|p=49}} The ''Wehrmacht'' obeyed Hitler's criminal orders for Barbarossa not because of obedience to orders, but because they, like Hitler, believed that the Soviet Union was run by Jews and that Germany must completely destroy \"[[Judeo-Bolshevism]]\".{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|p=273}} German historian J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster wrote that most ''Wehrmacht'' officers genuinely believed that most [[Red Army commissars]] were Jews who in turn were what kept the [[Red Army]] going and that the best way to bring about victory against the Soviet Union was to exterminate the commissars via enforcing the [[Commissar Order]] so as to deprive the Russian soldiers of their Jewish leaders.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|p=274}} \n\n[[S\u00f6nke Neitzel|Sonke Neitzel]] and [[Harald Welzer]] opine that the Wehrmacht \"were participants in, if not executioners of, unparalleled mass murder.\" Using transcriptions of secret records of conversations among POWs, they conclude that most soldiers were not interested in ideology and politics. In reality, being a Nazi, supporting anti-Semitism, and possessing the willingness to kill and commit unnecessary violence usually had nothing to do with each other: many hated the Jews but were shocked at mass extermination by firing squads, while some \"anti-Nazis\" supported anti-Jewish policies. {{sfn|Neitzel|Welzer|2012|pp=13-14}} \n\nFrom 1943 onwards, the influx of officers and conscripts who had been mainly educated under the Nazis began to further increase the National Socialism in the army.<ref>[[Antony Beevor|Beevor, Antony]] (1998).

When Hitler appointed unqualified personnel such as [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] to lead his Air Force, failure ensued. A sign of the close ties between Hitler and his armed forces was his choice of the ardent Nazi Grand Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] to be the next F\u00fchrer, a man whose \"...dedication to National Socialist ideas and his close identification with Hitler's strategy in the last stages of the war made him a logical, not surprising, choice by Hitler as his successor\".{{sfn|Weinberg|p=826}}\n===Impact of ideology on war-making ability===\nThe Israeli historian [[Omer Bartov]] wrote that on the Eastern Front, it was the belief in National Socialism that allowed the Wehrmacht to continue to fight, despite enormous losses.{{sfn|Bartov|1999|pp=137\u2013139}} Bartov argued that the claim that it was \"primary group loyalty\", by which men are motivated to fight by loyalty towards their comrades in their unit with little thought to the cause that one is fighting for, cannot possibly have been what motivated the Wehrmacht to fight on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Bartov|1999|pp=137\u2013138}} Bartov wrote that on the Eastern Front, the Wehrmacht was taking such heavy losses that there were no \"primary groups\" for men to give their loyalty to and that only a belief in National Socialism could explain why the Wehrmacht continued to be so aggressive and determined on the offensive, and so dogged and tenacious on the defence, despite often very high numbers of dead and wounded.{{sfn|Bartov|1999|pp=137\u2013138}} The Bartov thesis was endorsed by American historians Alan Millet and Williamson Murray, who wrote that, by early 1944, \"group cohesion alone\" could not explain why the German soldiers carried on fighting:\n\n<blockquote>The explanation seems to be that at every level German officers inculcated their troops with the values and assumptions of Nazi ideology and the mortal menace of the racial-Communist threat. By early 1944, ideological indoctrination was playing a major role in combat preparation on the Eastern and Western fronts. After the war, German generals claimed that neither they nor their troops had taken ideological instruction seriously, but the evidence suggests otherwise. Not only letters and diaries of combat soldiers indicate that ideology was a considerable factor in German combat effectiveness, but unit commanders from the division level on down consistently picked highly decorated combat officers to serve as \"leadership\" officers in charge of troop indoctrination. Such assignments underline the seriousness with which the army as a whole was taking ideological motivation.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|pp=396\u2013397}}</blockquote>\n\nStephen Fritz argues that the Nazis' vision of the ''volksgemeinschaft'', a classless society which would balance individual achievement with group solidarity, cooperation with competition, as the individual fulfilled their potential within the framework of the broader community, was an immensely powerful vision to many German soldiers, to the extent they were willing to overlook its racist and anti-Semitic essence. This vision allowed Hitler to maintain popular support amongst German soldiers right up until the end of the war and inspired fierce devotion and loyalty.<ref>Fritz, Stephen.

Since the military envisioned any future war as a total one that would require the complete mobilisation of German society, military leaders pursued the volksgemeinschaft as a means of realising national unity. According to Fritz, it was not simply rhetoric - the officer corp began to become the least snobbish in German history, opening up positions based on talent and had a general sympathy to the volksgemeinschaft; Hitler spoke proudly of this process. Hitler and his generals shared a vision in which the spirit of the Frontgemeinschaft of the First World War would become a permanent state of affairs.<ref>Fritz, Stephen. Frontsoldaten: The German Soldier in World War II. University Press of Kentucky, 1997, p.209</ref> \n\nMacGregor Knox explains that traditionally, the German officer corp had been dominated by the German nobility and upper-classes. During his rule, Hitler broke down this institutional preference and created a \"people's officer corps\" - Knox observes that in 1937, 14% of lieutenants had been noble, yet this fell to 4% by 1943. While in 1941 90% of officer candidates possessed the ''Abitur'', an elite secondary-school leaving certificate, by the second half of the war this fell to 44% and 12% of officers had only primary education, while candidates from lower-class backgrounds had risen from 5% in 1937 to 20% in 1942. By removing the institutional social restrictions on who could become an officer, Hitler instead made rank dependent upon combat ability and \u00e9lan, thus encouraging soldiers to fight even harder to earn the prospect of a swift rise through the ranks. The Wehrmacht thus became a \"soldier's community\" fused by shared ambition, fanaticism, and crime. The Nazi \"pursuit of happiness\" thus immunised both the military and German society at large from a repeat of 1918 and while incapable of delaying the defeat of the regime, ensured many soldiers held out far longer than they may otherwise have.<ref>Knox, MacGregor. \"1 October 1942: Adolf Hitler, Wehrmacht officer policy, and social revolution.\" The Historical Journal 43, no. 3 (2000): 801-825.</ref>\n\nIn 1944, the [[20 July plot]] involving a minority of officers received overwhelming disapproval from the Wehrmacht, who rallied for the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Bartov|1999|p=136}} The American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] wrote about the July 20 ''putsch'' and the military: \"As both sides sent their orders over the teleprinters in Germany's last 'election' as a united country until 1990, most generals chose to support the Hitler regime and to reinforce rather than arrest the police.\"{{sfn|Weinberg|p=754}} The July 20 ''putsch'' attempt was crushed by Army troops commanded by Major [[Otto Ernst Remer]] with no involvement from the SS.{{cn|date=January 2020}} Stephen Fritz explains that the putsch was seen by soldiers at the front as the treacherous actions of an unrepresentative aristocratic clique and that by that point in the war, the Wehrmacht had become essentially \"Nazified.\"<ref>Fritz, Stephen.

University Press of Kentucky, 1997.</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Mechanisms of control ==\n\n=== Terror===\nBecause the military believed that Germany had not been defeated in World War I, the lesson that the Wehrmacht took from this was for the need for a draconian military justice system that would ruthlessly stamp out anything that might lead to any new \"[[Stab-in-the-back myth|stab in the back]]\".{{sfn|Bartov|1999|p=141}} It had been neither forgotten nor forgiven by the military that the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|November Revolution]] had started with the [[Kiel mutiny|High Seas mutiny]]. In August 1917, there had been a mutiny in the High Seas Fleet, which after it was crushed, saw the execution of its leaders' [[Max Reichpietsch]] and [[Albin K\u00f6bis]] with the rest of the mutineers given long prison sentences. The \"lesson\" drawn by the Navy and the rest of the Wehrmacht had been that if only the High Seas Fleet mutiny of 1917 been followed up with more executions instead of just Reichpietsch and K\u00f6bis, then the much more serious mutiny of November 1918 would have been avoided. For this reason, all violations of the military code that hindered the war effort were treated by military courts as equivalent to high treason, though in the vast majority of the cases, politics were not a factor.{{sfn|Bartov|1999|p=141}}\n\nDuring World War II, the German military had thousands of its members executed, often for the most trivial violations of discipline.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=397}} In World War I, the German Army had executed only 48 of its soldiers; in World War II between 13,000 and 15,000 German soldiers were executed for violations of military code.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|pp=396\u2013337}} The German historians' [[Manfred Messerschmidt]] and Fritz W\u00fcllner in a 1987 study of Wehrmacht justice have argued that the figure of 15,000 executed is too low, as it only records verdicts handed down by military courts and that in the last months of the war, the Wehrmacht abandoned even the pretence of holding trials, and simply executed extrajudicially so-called \"defeatists\".{{sfn|Kitterman|p=459}} Messerschmidt and W\u00fcllner contended that, if one takes into account extrajudicial executions, the real figure is about 30,000 executions of Wehrmacht personnel between 1939 and 1945.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=459}} The only country that executed more of its own servicemen than Germany in World War II was the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=397}} By way of contrast, during all of World War II, Britain executed 40 of its servicemen, France executed 102 and the United States executed 146 while the Wehrmacht executed 519 of its personnel during the first 13 months of the war alone.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=459}} In addition, German courts-martial sentenced ten of thousands of German soldiers to service in ''[[Strafbattalion]]'' (penal battalions). Their conditions were so brutal that service in a Wehrmacht penal battalion was equivalent to a death sentence.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=397}} Those sentenced to serve in the penal battalions called them \"death battalions\" given the fact that the chances for survival were almost nil.<ref name=\"Hadden 2009\">{{cite web | last = Hadden | first = Gerry | authorlink = | title = Nazi Deserters Pardoned | publisher = The World |date=October 12, 2009| url = http://www.pri.org/stories/2009-10-12/nazi-deserters-pardoned | doi = | accessdate = 2012-04-13 }}</ref>\n\nThe exception towards the otherwise ferocious application of military justice was the widespread tolerance of war crimes against civilians and POWs, especially in Eastern Europe, provided that such actions took place in a \"disciplined\" and \"orderly\" way.{{sfn|Bartov|1999|pp=140\u2013142}} So-called \"wild shootings\" and \"wild requisitions\" against civilians were always disapproved of, whereas massive violence against civilians provided that it took place in a context that was \"disciplined\" and pseudo-legal were considered to be acceptable.{{sfn|Bartov|1999|pp=141\u2013142}} This was especially the case with Jews in the occupied areas of the Soviet Union, where it was official policy to generally not prosecute those soldiers who killed Soviet Jews, and even in those cases, where prosecutions did occur, claiming that one hated Jews and killed out of a desire for \"revenge\" for the November Revolution of 1918 was allowed as a defence (though in fact, the Soviet Jewish population had nothing to do with the November Revolution).{{sfn|Kitterman|p=460}} German military courts always gave very light sentences to those soldiers who killed Soviet Jews, even in an \"undisciplined\" way, and even then, Hitler usually intervened to pardon the accused.{{sfn|Kitterman|pp=461\u2013462}}\n\nOn 17 August 1938 the German military code was re-written to make desertion equivalent to high treason, and created a new crime of ''[[Wehrkraftzersetzung]]'' (literally: \"subversion of the war effort\"), a vaguely defined crime that carried the death penalty for anyone serving in the Wehrmacht who either attempted to influence others to not carry out orders fully and unconditionally and/or weakened the resolve of the German nation to continue the fight until total victory.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=457}} About 20% of the death sentences imposed by Wehrmacht courts were for ''Wehrkraftzersetzung''.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=455}} ''Wehrkraftzersetzung'' was so vaguely defined as to constitute anything from grumbling about the quality of food to making unflattering remarks about an officer. German military courts-martial consisted of three judges, one lawyer serving as a prosecutor, and two Wehrmacht men, usually a staff officer and another man, who was expected to be of the same rank as the defendant.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=458}} In theory, the defendant had the automatic right to a defence lawyer for all charges that involved the death penalty and could be granted defence counsel in a non-capital case only if the court decided to permit that privilege, but in practice, the right to defence counsel was rarely granted, even in cases that carried capital punishment where the law required it.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=458}}\n\nThe abrogation of the rights of the accused was part of the \"simplified operating procedure\", which as its name implied stripped away rights from the defendant, and turned the courts-martial into a drumhead tribunal that was not concerned with questions of innocence and guilt, but rather how harsh the punishment would be.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=458}} After the sentence was passed, there was no right of judicial appeal, and the case went up to the commander of the fleet, army or air fleet that the defendant was serving in, who could either confirm the sentence or order a new trial if he believed the sentence to be either too harsh or too lenient.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=458}} All commanders received advice from a panel of judges which was not binding, but usually acted upon.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=459}} The system served to deflect responsibility; commanders who upheld death sentences claimed that they were only following the advice of the judges while the judges claimed that their opinions were purely advisory, and the actual responsibility to uphold the death sentences rested with the commander.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=459}}\n\nA major latter-day debate about German military justice has been the demand by families of Wehrmacht men executed for desertion that they should be recognized as part of the resistance to Hitler under the grounds that by refusing to fight for the Nazi regime, they were also opposing it. Messerschmidt and W\u00fcllner wrote that many of Wehrmacht desertions were politically motivated out of disgust with the genocidal politics of the Nazi regime, and that \"Whom were these military judges serving who sent soldiers to their deaths? In numerous judgments, this question is clearly answered: they were serving the ''F\u00fchrer'', final victory, Nazi Germany\".{{sfn|Kitterman|p=456}} German veterans have for the most part been opposed to this. Only in September 2009 did Germany pardon the men convicted of desertion under the grounds that to desert from a criminal war was not a crime.<ref name=\"Hadden 2009\" /> At the time, there were three Wehrmacht deserters still alive, the vast majority having been either executed or killed in penal battalions during the war, and the few who survived the war were shunned as traitors and cowards by the German public after the war.<ref name=\"Hadden 2009\" /> One of the surviving deserters, a sailor who attempted to desert in 1942 named Ludwig Baumann, summarized the arguments against people such as himself as: <blockquote>\"It went like this: an act of treason might have endangered the lives of other German soldiers, therefore we can't absolve you. But what I say is, if only more soldiers had committed treason so many millions of lives could have been saved, in the concentration camps and so on. You can't place the lives of some soldiers above all those millions who died. And until Germany recognizes this, it will not have broken with its Nazi past.\"<ref name=\"Hadden 2009\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Corruption===\n{{Main|Corruption within the Wehrmacht}}\nIn order to ensure the absolute loyalty of the Wehrmacht officers, Hitler had created what the American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] called a \"...a vast secret program of bribery involving practically all at the highest levels of command\".{{sfn|Weinberg|p=455}} Hitler routinely presented his leading commanders with \"gifts\" of free estates, cars, cheques made out for large sums of cash and lifetime exemptions from paying taxes.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=529}}\n\nTypical of the F\u00fchrer's \"gifts\" was the cheque made out for a half-million Reichmarks presented to Field-Marshal [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]] in October 1942 together with the promise that Kluge could bill the German treasury for improvements to his estate.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=529}} Such was the success of Hitler's bribery system that by 1942 many officers had come to expect \"gifts\" from Hitler and were not willing to bite the hand that so generously fed them.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=529}} When Hitler sacked Field Marshal [[Fedor von Bock]] in December 1941, Bock's first reaction was to contact Hitler's aide [[Rudolf Schmundt]] to ask him if his sacking meant that he was no longer to receive the money.{{sfn|Goda|p=124}}\n\nThe first officer to be bribed into loyalty was the old World War I hero Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]], who criticized the Nazi regime for the murder of General [[Kurt von Schleicher]] in a speech before General Staff Association in February 1935. To silence him, Hitler gave Mackensen a free estate of 1,250 [[hectare]]s later that same year in exchange for a promise never to criticize the Nazi regime again in either public or private.{{sfn|Goda|p=110}} The agreement mostly worked; Mackensen never criticized the Nazi regime in public again, through Hitler was offended in February 1940 when Mackensen mentioned to [[Walter von Brauchitsch]] that the army had disgraced itself by committing massacres during the recent campaign in Poland. Hitler felt that to be a violation of their agreement of 1935, though Mackensen kept his estate.{{sfn|Goda|p=110}}\n\n====''Konto'' 5 fund====\nThe basis of the corruption system were regular monthly tax-free payments of 4,000 Reichmarks for field marshals and grand admirals and 2,000 Reichmarks for all other senior officers, which came from a special fund called ''Konto'' 5 run by the chief of the Reich Chancellery [[Hans Lammers]].{{sfn|Goda|p=102}} In addition, officers received as birthday presents cheques usually made out for the sum of 250,000 Reichmarks, which were exempt from income taxes.{{sfn|Goda|p=111}} This money was on top of the official salary of 26,000 Reichmarks a year for [[Field Marshal (Germany)|field marshals]] and [[grand admiral]]s and 24,000 Reichmarks a year for [[Colonel General|colonel generals]] and [[general admiral]]s.{{sfn|Goda|p=108}} Senior officers were given a life-time exemption from paying income tax (up to 65 per cent by 1939); they also received spending allowances for food, medical care, clothing, and housing.{{sfn|Goda|p=108}} By way of contrast, infantrymen were given the task of clearing landmines, were given one Reichsmark a day danger pay supplement.{{sfn|Goda|p=108}} The money from ''Konto'' 5 was deposited for the officer's life-time, and did not stop if the officer retired.{{sfn|Goda|p=113}}\n\nThe ''Konto'' 5 slush fund started with a budget of about 150,000 R.M in 1933 and by 1945 had grown to about 40 million R.M.{{sfn|Goda|p=102}} Payments from ''Konto'' 5, known officially as ''Aufwandsentsch\u00e4digungen'' (compensation for expenses) were made to Cabinet ministers and senior civil servants from April 1936 onwards.{{sfn|Goda|p=103}} As part of the reorganization of the military command structure following the [[Blomberg\u2013Fritsch Affair]] in early 1938, it was declared that the service chiefs, namely OKW chief [[Wilhelm Keitel]], Army commander [[Walter von Brauchitsch]], Luftwaffe commander [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] and Kriegsmarine commander [[Erich Raeder]] were to have the same status as Cabinet ministers and as such, they all started to receive publicly the same pay as a Cabinet member and privately payments from ''Konto'' 5.{{sfn|Goda|p=130}}\n\n====Nature of payments====\nEvery officer who started to receive the money always had a meeting first with Lammers, who informed them that the future payments would depend on how much loyalty they were willing to show Hitler, and what the F\u00fchrer gave with one hand, could just as easily be taken away with the other.{{sfn|Goda|p=105}} Payments from ''Konto'' 5 to the bank account of General [[Friedrich Paulus]] stopped in August 1943 not because Paulus had lost the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], but because Paulus had gone on Soviet radio to blame Hitler for the defeat.{{sfn|Goda|p=106}}\n\nIn the same way, after the failure of the [[20 July plot|July 20 ''putsch'']] of 1944, the families of [[Erwin Rommel]], [[Franz Halder]], [[Friedrich Fromm]] and [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]] were punished by being cut off from the monthly payments from ''Konto'' 5.{{sfn|Goda|p=106}} In the case of Field Marshal [[Erwin von Witzleben]], it was demanded that his family pay back all of the bribe money he had taken from ''Konto'' 5 since the money was given as a reward for loyalty to the F\u00fchrer, which Witzleben was evidently not.{{sfn|Goda|p=106}} The illicit nature of these payments was underlined by Lammers who would warn an officer that was to receive money from ''Konto'' 5 not to speak about these payments to anyone and to keep as few written records as possible.{{sfn|Goda|p=105}}\n\n====Consequences====\nThe American historian [[Norman J.W. Goda|Norman Goda]] wrote that after General [[Heinz Guderian]] received a free estate of 937 hectares in Poland in the spring of 1943, that the doubts that he had been expressing since late 1941 about the Hitler's military leadership suddenly ceased, and he became one of Hitler's most ardent military supporters, or as [[Joseph Goebbels]] described him in his diary, \"a glowing and unqualified follower of the F\u00fchrer\".{{sfn|Goda|p=126}} Before receiving the estate, Guderian as Inspector General for the Panzers had been opposed to the plans for Operation Zitadelle, which subsequently led to Wehrmacht's failure in the [[Battle of Kursk]]; after receiving the estate, he apparently changed his mind.{{sfn|Goda|p=126}} Instead of criticizing Zitadelle openly, Guderian approached Goebbels to ask him if he could somehow talk Hitler out of Zitadelle, behaviour that Goda described as very atypical for Guderian.{{sfn|Goda|p=126}} During the 20 July ''putsch'' of 1944, Guderian ordered Panzer units to Berlin to crush it, and then sat on the Court of Honor that had the responsibility of expelling officers involved so that they could be tried before the [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]], a duty that Guderian performed with considerable zeal.{{sfn|Goda|pp=126\u2013127}} It was only after January 1945, when Guderian's estate fell behind Soviet lines that Guderian began to once more to disagree with Hitler, leading to Guderian being fired as Chief of the General Staff in March 1945.{{sfn|Goda|p=127}}\n\nGoda used Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb]] as an all-too-typical example of a Wehrmacht officer whose greed overwhelmed any moral revulsion that they might have felt about the \"[[Final Solution]]\".{{sfn|Goda|p=112\u2013113}} In late June-early July 1941, Leeb, as the commander of [[Army Group North]], had witnessed the massacres of Jews by the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', Lithuanian auxiliaries and the men of the [[16th Army (Wehrmacht)|16th Army]] outside of Kaunas.{{sfn|Goda|p=112}} Leeb was described as being \"moderately disturbed\", and sent in mildly critical reports about the massacres.{{sfn|Goda|p=112}} Leeb approved of the killing of Jewish men, claiming that this was justified by their supposed crimes during the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, but that the killing of women and children might have been taking things too far.<ref>[[Helmut Krausnick|Krausnick, Helmut]] & Wilhelm, Hans-Heinrich ''Die Truppe des Weltanschauungskrieges: Die Einsatzgruppen der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD 1938\u20131942'', Stuttgart: 1981 pages 207\u2013209.</ref> In response, Hitler's aide General [[Rudolf Schmundt]] told Leeb that he was out of line and should in the future co-operate fully with the SS in \"special tasks\".{{sfn|Goda|p=112}} Schmundt asked if Leeb appreciated his monthly payments from ''Konto'' 5, and reminded him that his birthday was coming up, for which the F\u00fchrer was planning to give him a 250,000 R.M cheque for his loyalty. Leeb never again protested about the massacres, and duly received 250,000 R.M in September 1941.{{sfn|Goda|p=112\u2013113}} In the same month, [[Franz Walter Stahlecker]], the commander of ''Einsatzgruppe'' A, in a report to Berlin praised Leeb's Army Group for its exemplary co-operation.<ref>Hilberg, Raul ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'', New York: Holmes & Meier, 1985, p. 301</ref>\n\nThe subject of corruption proved to be embarrassing for its recipients. Under oath at Nuremberg, [[Walther von Brauchitsch]] committed perjury when he denied taking any bribes.{{sfn|Goda|p=123}} Brauchitsch's bank records showed that he had been receiving 4,000 R.M/month payments from ''Konto'' 5 from 1938 until the end of the war.{{sfn|Goda|p=123}} At his trial in 1948, General [[Franz Halder]] perjured himself when he denied that he had taken bribes, and then had to maintain a stern silence when the American prosecutor [[James M. McHaney]] produced bank records showing otherwise.{{sfn|Goda|p=123}} Weinberg commented that \"the bribery system understandably does not figure prominently in the endless memoir literature of the recipients and has attracted little scholarly attention\".{{sfn|Weinberg|p=1045}}\n\n=== Chaplaincy ===\n{{see also|Military chaplain#World War II}}\nIn the Wehrmacht, chaplains were required to serve at the front under fire.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=123}} This regulation was introduced by the Nazi regime, which strong and barely veiled anti-Christian tendencies out of the hope that it might be led to the most of the chaplaincy getting killed in battle.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=123}} Protestant chaplains carried firearms, were required to undergo military training, were expected to fight if necessary and those Protestant clergymen who were World War I veterans were given preference in recruiting chaplains.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=137}} Catholic chaplains, by contrast, were unarmed, did not receive military training and were not expected to fight.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=137}} All chaplains, Catholic and Protestant had to know first-aid because of their role in ministering at the front.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=137}}\n\nA great many of the Protestant [[Military chaplain|chaplains]] in the Wehrmacht were members of the [[German Christians|\"German Christian\"]] movement that sought to \"de-Judize\" Christianity, and even those chaplains who were not members of the \"German Christian\" movement were influenced by it in various ways.{{sfn|Bergen|1997|pp=523\u2013524}} Because of their emphasis upon an aggressively \"manly\", militaristic and ultra-nationalistic interpretation of Christianity, a disproportionate number of German Christian pastors joined the Wehrmacht to serve as chaplains.{{sfn|Bergen|1997|p=524}} The requirement that Lutheran chaplains serve at the front with firearms served to attract German Christian pastors, most of whom were World War I veterans who saw a chance to practice what they preached by becoming figuratively \"combat priests\". Likewise, the Wehrmacht favoured the recruitment of German Christian pastors, and banned those pastors belonging to the [[Confessing Church]] from becoming chaplains.{{sfn|Bergen|1997|p=526}} Both Heinrich Lonicier, the Lutheran bishop of Breslau (modern [[Wroc\u0142aw]], Poland) who was also a senior Army chaplain, a leading German Christian and NSDAP member and the equally ardent German Christian and NSDAP member Friedrich Ronneberger, the Navy's chief Protestant chaplain had ambitions to become the ''Reich'' bishop of the Lutheran church, and saw the military as a basis for achieving their ambitions.{{sfn|Bergen|1997|pp=524\u2013525}} Lonicier, in particular, enjoyed the open backing of his close friends [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Walter von Brauchitsch]] in his attempts to depose the Lutheran ''Reich'' bishop [[Ludwig M\u00fcller (theologian)|Ludwig M\u00fcller]].{{sfn|Bergen|1997|p=524}} However, Bishop Lonicier's efforts created powerful opposition from the SS and other NSDAP elements who argued that the incompetent M\u00fcller made for a far more pliable ''Reich'' bishop than what the able and vigorous Lonicier would ever be, and that anyhow Lonicier's plans for a military-backed Nazified Lutheran church under his leadership playing a major role in German public life conflicted directly with their plans to ultimately do away with Christianity altogether in favour of a revived paganism.{{sfn|Bergen|1997|p=524}}\n\nAs part of their efforts to promote \"Aryan Christianity\" in the Wehrmacht, the Old Testament was in effect banned, and only the New Testament was available to Wehrmacht members.{{sfn|Bergen|1997|p=529}} In the same way, German Christian chaplains preached a \"manly Christianity\" to Wehrmacht members that unabashedly glorified war as the only fit and proper activity for \"real men\".{{sfn|Bergen|1997|p=533}} Besides for being outspoken supporters of the war, German Christian Wehrmacht chaplains preached in their sermons support for the Nazi regime, antisemitism, and the superiority of the \"Aryan race\" over all others.{{sfn|Bergen|1997|p=534}} Owing to the fear of death and disfigurement faced by men in the chaos of battlefields everywhere together with the loss of friends and comrades, many Wehrmacht men sought solace in religion, and so the chaplains had considerable spiritual influence with the Wehrmacht rank and file.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=134}} Moreover, the vast majority of Germans of that generation regularly attended church, and so the chaplains had a greater role in the social life of the Wehrmacht than what chaplains do today in a more secular age. Despite their support for the Nazi regime, the anti-Christian tendencies of the regime meant that it did its utmost to restrict both the numbers and powers of chaplains including the German Christians throughout the war.{{sfn|Bergen|1997|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nThere was no equivalent to the German Christian Movement in the Catholic Church, but most Catholic chaplains supported the regime as much as their Protestant counterparts did, albeit in a much less vocal form.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|pp=126 & 128}} [[Franz-Justus Rarkowski]], the Catholic bishop who was the chief Catholic chaplain of the Wehrmacht was a strong supporter of the regime. In his Christmas message in 1940 for Catholics serving in the Wehrmacht, Bishop Rarkowski used the occasion to blame the Jews not only for the war but for every problem in German history.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=134}} Perhaps more typical was the case of a Catholic chaplain named Ernst Tewes serving on the Eastern Front, known not to be a supporter of the regime who had led the protests against the massacre at Belaya Tserkov in August 1941, but by November 1941 had come to accept genocide as normal.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=127}} In his diary, Tewes wrote that the war was terrible for everyone concerned, that watching the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' massacre Jews was another of the war's horrors that the German Catholic soldier had to learn to accept just he had learned to accept it, and that because he believed that most partisans were Russian Jews, that it was the Jews' own fault that they were being massacred.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=127}} Presumably, what Tewes was writing in his diary reflected what he was preaching in his sermons. It is likely that Father Tewes in face of pervasive violence against civilians and the futility of protest had been numbered into a passive acceptance of what he knew to be wrong, hence his repeated attempts in his diary to justify to himself the actions of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' as something forced on the Germans by alleged Jewish partisans.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=127}} Another Catholic chaplain serving on the Eastern Front was deeply shocked when another Catholic chaplain told him \"There is a curse upon this people [Jews] ever since the crucifixion of Jesus when they cried: \"Let his blood be on our heads and the heads of our children\", and as such, the Jews were only getting what they deserved.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\nA large part of the reason why most chaplains, both Protestant and Catholic supported the regime was due to the intense background checks performed on any priest who wanted to join the Wehrmacht as a chaplain by their own churches (who did not want any \"trouble-makers\" becoming chaplains lest they strain an already fraught relationship with the regime), the Gestapo and the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=133}} Mindful of the important role chaplains played in the social life of the Wehrmacht, any priest who had done or said anything \"pro-Jewish\" in the past was instantly disqualified from becoming a chaplain.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=133}} The American historian Doris Bergen wrote that a great number of Lutheran and Catholic priests must have been either anti-Semitics or at least not done anything \"pro-Jewish\" as the Wehrmacht never suffered from a shortage of chaplains despite the \"high\" standards they had imposed in 1935 for the new expanded Wehrmacht created by the return of conscription, which was maintained right to the end of 1945.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=133}} Only a \"handful\" of potential chaplains were excluded by the Gestapo for \"pro-Jewish\" actions in the past.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=133}} Moreover, the energetic activities of the German Christian pastors together with the general anti-Christian tone of the regime led to those chaplains who were not German Christians to incorporate aspects of their theology as a way of counteracting their influence.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=133}}\n\nDespite the screening process, there were occasions when chaplains did protest. In August 1941, when the commander of the 6th Army, General [[Walter von Reichenau]] ordered his men to assist the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and its Ukrainian auxiliaries with shooting the Jewish children at an orphanage in [[Bila Tserkva|Belaya Tserkov]] who had been rendered orphans after their parents had been shot in the preceding days, the Protestant and Catholic chaplains, namely Pastor Wilczek and Father Ernst Tewes attached to 295th Infantry Division made strenuous efforts first to save the children, and when that failed, to protest the massacre.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|pp=124\u2013126}} In 1968 Father Tewes was a leading witness for the prosecution at the trial of the SS leaders who had ordered the massacre at Belaya Tserkov, where he noted that \"All those we wanted to save, were shot. Because of our initiative it just happened a few days later than planned\".{{sfn|Bergen|2001|pp=125\u2013126}} Even more dramatic was the case at a military base outside of Stettin (modern [[Szczecin]], Poland), where two local Catholic chaplains, disgusted by atrocities that one had seen while serving in Poland in 1939, formed an oppositional group, the \"Wednesday Circle\" for Catholic soldiers, where they provided detailed information about the \"Final Solution\" and predicted God would punish Germany with the most terrible defeat for the Holocaust.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|pp=130\u2013131}} Betrayed when one of the soldiers they had recruited to the \"Wednesday Circle\" denounced them, Fathers {{ill|Herbert Simoleit|de}} and [[Friedrich Lorenz]] were convicted by a court-martial for high treason and executed in November 1944.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=131}}\n\nBergen wrote that such case was the exception, not the rule, and most chaplains loyally supported the regime.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|pp=131\u2013133}} Only ten out of a thousand chaplains were known to protest genocide.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=129}} Bergen wrote that by rationalizing the ''[[Shoah]]'' as something the Jews had brought down on themselves, and by doing their utmost to maintain morale, the majority of military chaplains played an important role in maintaining the fighting spirit of the Wehrmacht, and thereby in their own way helped to prolong the war, and with it the \"Final Solution\".{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=134}}\n\n==See also==\n;Overviews\n* [[History of Germany]]\n* [[Military history of Germany]]\n*[[German Army (1935\u20131945)]]\n* [[Luftwaffe]]\n;Specific issues\n* [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht]]\n* [[German war crimes]]\n* [[War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II]]\n* [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation]]\n*[[Consequences of Nazism]]\n* [[Guidelines for the Conduct of the Troops in Russia]]\n;General reference entries\n* [[Glossary of Nazi Germany]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bartov\n  | first = Omer\n  | authorlink = Omer Bartov\n  | year = 1999\n  | chapter = Soldiers, Nazis and War in the Third Reich\n  | pages = 129\u2013150\n  | title = The Third Reich: The Essential Readings\n  | editor-last = Leitz\n  | editor-first = Christian\n  | publisher = Blackwell\n  | location = London\n  | isbn = 978-0-631-20700-9\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bartov\n  | first = Omer\n  | year = 1986\n  | title = The Eastern Front, 1941\u201345: German Troops and the Barbarisation of Warfare\n  | publisher = St. Martin's Press\n  | location = New York\n  | isbn = 978-0-312-22486-8\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Bergen\n  | first = Doris\n  |date=September 1997\n  | title = 'Germany Is Our Mission: Christ Is Our Strength!'

Broadly speaking, there have been two camps. The [[myth of the clean Wehrmacht]] claims that the Wehrmacht had minimal participation in war crimes and genocide. More recently, scholarship has emerged demonstrating that [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht|the Wehrmacht was complicit]] in [[the Holocaust]].\n\n== Politics of the Wehrmacht ==\nThe German military had traditionally functioned as a \"[[state within a state]]\" with a very large margin of institutional autonomy.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=6\u20137}} Thus Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] had been forbidden to attend meetings of the Supreme Council of War because as it was insultingly phrased \"Lest this civilian might betray the secrets of the State\".{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=8}} In the First World War, the military began to complain more and more that both the Chancellor [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] and the Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] were grossly incompetent, and needed to step aside in order to allow the military to win the war.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=13}}\n\nIn March\u2013April 1915, Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]] stated that the only thing that was keeping Germany from winning the war was the poor leadership of the Chancellor and the Emperor. His solution was a plan in which Bethmann-Hollweg would be sacked and the office of Chancellor abolished; the Kaiser would \"temporarily\" abdicate; and Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] be given the new office of \"Dictator of the ''Reich''\", concentrating all political and military power into his hands in order to win the war.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=13}} Though the Tirpitz plan was not implemented, the very fact it was mooted showed the extent of military dissatisfaction with the existing leadership, and the strength of the \"state within the state\" in that Tirpitz was not punished despite having essentially called for deposing the Emperor.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=13}} In August 1916, Germany became a ''de facto'' military dictatorship under the duumvirate of Field Marshal [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] and General [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]], who ruled Germany until 1918.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=13\u201314}} During the rule of the \"silent dictatorship\" of Hindenburg and Ludendorff, the German government advocated a set of imperialist war aims calling for the annexation of most of Europe and Africa that in many ways were a prototype for the war aims of the Second World War.<ref>Hillgruber, Andreas ''Germany and the Two World Wars'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1981 pages 41\u201345.</ref>\n\n===Aftermath of World War I===\n\nIn October 1918, in order to avoid responsibility for losing the First World War, the military returned power to the civilians and transformed Germany into a democracy, largely because the Allies made it clear that they would never sign an armistice with the Hindenburg-Ludendorff duumvirate.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=16}} After the November Revolution of 1918, there were demands for the dissolution of the military that had led to such a defeat, but on December 23, 1918, the Provisional government under [[Friedrich Ebert]] came under attack from the radical left-wing \"People's Marine Division\".{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=32\u201333}} Ebert called General [[Wilhelm Groener|Wilhelm Gr\u00f6ner]] for help, and what resulted was the so-called [[Ebert\u2013Groener pact]], where in return for saving the government, the military would be allowed to retain its traditional and informal \"state within the state\" status.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=33\u201334}}{{sfn|Shirer|p=54}} To fulfil his side of the deal, Gr\u00f6ner created a new force of volunteers, the ''[[Freikorps]]'' to protect the government.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=36}} In return for crushing the Communist [[Spartacus League]] in early January 1919 with its new ''Freikorps'' units, the government ended all efforts to democratize the military later that month.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=42}} Under the constitution of the [[Weimar Republic]], no soldier of the ''Reichswehr'' was allowed to be a member of a political party nor to vote in an election.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Weimar Republic===\nIn the 1920s, the military did not accept the democratic Weimar Republic as legitimate, and so the ''Reichswehr'' under the leadership of [[Hans von Seeckt]] became, even more so than under the monarchy, a \"state within the state\" that operated largely outside the control of politicians.{{sfn|Kolb|p=172}} During the [[Kapp Putsch]] of March 1920, Seeckt disobeyed orders from the Defence Minister [[Gustav Noske]], the Chancellor [[Gustav Bauer]] and the ''Reich'' President [[Friedrich Ebert]] to suppress the ''putsch'', claiming \"There can be no question of sending the ''Reichswehr'' to fight these people\".{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=76}} Seeckt's actions were entirely illegal as under the Weimar constitution the President was the Supreme Commander-in-Chief, and moreover Seeckt had violated the ''[[Reichswehreid]]'', which committed the military to defend the republic.<ref>Nicholls, A.J. ''Weimar and the Rise of Hitler'', London: Macmillan, 2000, pages 69\u201370.</ref> Seeckt ordered the military to disregard Ebert's orders to defend the republic, and instead assumed a stance of apparent neutrality, which in effect meant siding with the Kapp ''putsch'' by depriving the government of the means of defending itself. The position of the military as \"state within the state\" led to only those few officers and soldiers who had attempted to defend the republic being dismissed, and the officers led by Seeckt who had done nothing to defend the republic were allowed to continue with their jobs.<ref>Nicholls, A.J. ''Weimar and the Rise of Hitler'', London: Macmillan, 2000, page 71.</ref> The same officers who violated the ''Reichswehreid'' during the Kapp ''putsch'' by disobeying Ebert's orders to suppress the putsch were later to claim that the [[Hitler oath]] made it impossible for them to resist the Nazi regime.\n\nRight from the onset, Seeckt made it clear that he expected to see another world war based on the French political atmosphere concerning German failure to meet the Treaty of Versailles restitution payments. His famous \"Memo on the Russian Question\" of September 11, 1922, arguing the benefits of an alliance with England or Russia, noted that, \"We should be quite clear as to France's attitude. She is following a policy of annihilation pure and simple, which she must follow in pursuance of the unshakable principles of her policy. The hope that economic decisions may divert French policy into another course can be discounted altogether, quite apart from the fact that it is doubtful whether in any case, the economic strengthening of Germany would be in the interests of the ruling industrial circles of France. The contrary appears to be the case, and the French economic interests have the same object as the purely political, that is, the annihilation of Germany. This aim is not affected by the consideration that the debtor, already insolvent, will become even less able to pay up. France no longer expects payment, and in fact, does not want it as it would upset her political plans.... The whole policy of reconciliation and appeasement towards France ... is hopeless in as far as it aims at political success. The question of orientation towards the West, as far as France is concerned, is ruled out. French policy is not quite indifferent as to whether we ally ourselves with Russia or not, for in either case the complete destruction of Germany, not yet fully brought about, remains her objective, and this aim would be more difficult to achieve if Germany were supported by Russia.\"\n\nSeeckt's memo goes on to cite the unacceptability of the creation of Poland by the Treaty of Versailles as another reason for the coming war: \"With Poland [sic] we come now to the core of the Eastern problem. The existence of Poland is intolerable and incompatible with Germany's vital interests. She must disappear and will do so through her own inner weakness and through Russia - with our help. Poland is more intolerable for Russia than for ourselves; Russia can never tolerate Poland. With [sic] Poland collapses one of the strongest pillars of the Peace of Versailles, France's advance post of power. The attainment of this objective must be one of the firmest guiding principles of German policy, as it is capable of achievement - but only through Russia or with her help. Poland can never offer Germany any advantage, either economically, because she is incapable of development, or politically, because she is a vassal state of France. The restoration of the frontier between Russia and Germany is a necessary condition before both sides can become strong. The 1914 frontier between Russia and Germany should be the basis of any understanding between the two countries.\"\n\nThe memo then goes on to cite the necessity of war: \"The man who still lives in the days of Versailles, and maintains that Germany has permanently abjured all 'imperialist and military aims', that is, stripped of its demogogic [sic] jargon, all policy of action, is not fit to represent German interests in Russia, nor perhaps anywhere else.... Germany today is certainly not in a position to resist France. Our policy should be to prepare the means of doing so in the future.... The German nation, with its Socialist majority, would be averse from a policy of action, which has to reckon with the possibility of war. It must be admitted that the spirit surrounding the Peace Delegation at Versailles has not yet disappeared, and that the stupid cry of 'No more war! ' is widely echoed. It is echoed by many bourgeois-pacifist elements, but among the workers and also among the members of the official Social Democrat Party there are many who are not prepared to eat out of the hands of France and Poland. It is true that there is a widespread and understandable need for peace among the German people. The clearest heads, when considering the pros and cons of war, will be those of the military, but to pursue a policy means to take the lead. In spite of everything, the German people will follow the leader in the struggle for their existence. Our task is to prepare for this struggle, for we shall not be spared it. If it comes to war - and that seems to be already within measurable distance - it will not be the duty of our leading statesmen to keep Germany out of war - that would be either impossible or suicidal - but to come in on the right side with all possible strength.\"{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=133\u2013138}} After meeting [[Adolf Hitler]] on March 11, 1923, Seeckt wrote: \"We were one in our aim; only our paths were different\".{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=118|loc=n. 1}}\n\nIn 1927, the Phoebus film studio went bankrupt.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=188}} Subsequently, bankruptcy proceedings established that the studio was a front company created by the ''Reichsmarine'' to obtain nitrate and that the navy had poured millions of Reichmarks to subsidize the financially struggling studio over the last few years.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=188}} These disclosures of his knowledge of this matter forced the Defence Minister [[Otto Gessler]] to resign in disgrace in January 1928.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=188}} The military took advantage of the opening created by Gessler's resignation to convince President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] to impose General [[Wilhelm Groener|Wilhelm Gr\u00f6ner]] as the new Defence minister.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=188}} Gessler was the last civilian Defence minister of the Weimar Republic, and until the abolition of the War ministry by Hitler in 1938, every Defence/War minister was a serving general. The practice of having active duty generals run the Bendlerstrasse (the street in Berlin where the Defence/War ministry was located) in turn further weakened the already weak civilian control of the military, and also led to further politicization of the military since through their representative in the Cabinet the military become involved in issues that had nothing to do with military matters (though that the fact that Cabinet virtually stopped meeting after 1934 did weaken this venue of exercising power).\n\nReflecting this position as a \"state within the state\", the ''Reichswehr'' created the ''Ministeramt'' or Office of the Ministerial Affairs in 1928 under General [[Kurt von Schleicher]] to [[lobbying|lobby]] politicians ostensibly for improved military budgets, but in fact the ''Ministeramt'' was the vehicle for military interference with politics.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=198}} German historian [[Eberhard Kolb]] wrote that:<blockquote>\"...from the mid-1920s onwards the Army leaders had developed and propagated new social conceptions of a militarist kind, tending towards a fusion of the military and civilian sectors and ultimately a totalitarian military state (''Wehrstaat'')\".{{sfn|Kolb|p=173}}</blockquote> In 1926, Seeckt was ousted by the so-called \"modern\" fraction within the ''Reichswehr'' as a group of more technocratic officers were known, which saw Seeckt as too conservative as he was less willing to see the sort of radical reorganization of German society that the \"modern\" fraction wanted.{{sfn|Kolb|p=173}} What the German military wanted to see above all was the ''Wiederwehrhaftmachung'' of Germany, namely the total militarization of German society in order to fight a [[total war]] and thus ensure that Germany did not lose the next war.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|p=267}} As such, what both the Nazis and the German Army wanted to see was Germany remade into a totally militarized ''[[Volksgemeinschaft]]'' that would be ruthlessly purged of those considered to be internal enemies, such as the [[Jews]] who were believed to have \"stabbed\" Germany in \"the back\" in 1918.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|p=268}}\n\nMany officers in the early 1930s started to express admiration for National Socialism, which they saw as the best way of creating the much desired ''Wehrstaat'' (military state).<ref name=\"Nicholls, A.J. pages 163-164\" /> An important sign of the sympathy for National Socialism within the military came in September\u2013October 1930, with the trial in [[Leipzig]] of three junior officers, Lieutenant {{Interlanguage link multi|Richard Scheringer|de}}, Hans Friedrich Wendt and [[Hanns Ludin|Hans Ludin]]. The three men were charged with membership in the [[Nazi Party]]; at that time membership in political parties was forbidden for members of the ''Reichswehr''. The three officers openly admitted to Nazi Party membership and used it as their defence to claim that the Nazi Party membership should not be forbidden to ''Reichswehr'' personnel. When the three officers were caught [[In flagrante delicto|red-handed]] distributing Nazi literature at their base, their commanding officer, General [[Ludwig Beck]] (of the 5th [[Artillery]] Regiment based in [[Ulm]]), was furious at their arrest, and argued that since the Nazi Party was a force for good, ''Reichswehr'' personnel should be allowed to join the Party.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=217}} At the Leipzig trial of Ludin and Scheringer, Beck and other officers testified about the good character of the accused, described the Nazi Party as a positive force in German life, and proclaimed his belief that the ''Reichswehr'' ban on Nazi Party membership should be rescinded. The trial in Leipzig caused a media sensation and Hitler himself testified at the trial about how much Nazi and ''Reichswehr'' values were one and the same.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=216\u2013219}} After the trial, many ''Reichswehr'' officers started to favour the NSDAP.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=220\u2013223}}\n\nBy 1931, Germany's reserves of experienced reservists were coming to an end, because Part V of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] forbade [[conscription]] and  existing reservists were ageing.<ref name=\"Nicholls, A.J. page 163\">Nicholls, A.J.

Schleicher and other ''Reichswehr'' generals made secret contacts with the SA leadership starting in 1931.<ref name=\"Nicholls, A.J. page 163\" /> Like the rest of the ''Reichswehr'' leadership, Schleicher viewed democracy as a great impediment to military power, and firmly believed that only a dictatorship could make Germany a great military power again.<ref name=\"Nicholls, A.J. pages 163-164\">Nicholls, A.J. ''Weimar and the Rise of Hitler'', New York: St. Martin's Press, 2000, pages 163\u2013164.</ref> Thus Schleicher worked to replace the democracy with a dictatorship headed by himself. In this way, Schleicher played a key role in the downfall of the Weimar Republic and unintentionally helped to bring about Nazi Germany.{{sfn|Kolb|p=126}}\n\n===Nazis rise to power===\n\nThe military played a major role in January 1933 in persuading President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] to dismiss Schleicher and appoint Hitler as Chancellor.{{sfn|Geyer|pp=122\u2013123}} The reasons for this was by January 1933 that it was clear that the Schleicher government could only stay in power by proclaiming martial law, and by sending the ''Reichswehr'' to crush popular opposition. In doing so, the military would have to kill hundreds, if not thousands of German civilians; any regime established in this way could never expect to build the national consensus necessary to create the ''Wehrstaat''.{{sfn|Geyer|pp=122\u2013123}} The military had decided that Hitler alone was capable of peacefully creating the national consensus that would allow the creation of the ''Wehrstaat'', and thus the military successfully brought pressure on Hindenburg to appoint Hitler Chancellor.{{sfn|Geyer|pp=122\u2013123}}\n\nDespite their sympathy and approval of the Nazi regime, the military leadership was in the early years of the ''Third Reich'' determined to defend their position as a \"state within the state\" against all rivals. In January 1934, when the Army commander [[Kurt von Hammerstein]] resigned, Hitler's choice for Hammerstein's successor General [[Walter von Reichenau]] was vetoed by the Army officer corps with the support of President von Hindenburg under the grounds that Reichenau was too much a military radical, and so [[Werner von Fritsch]] was chosen as a compromise.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=301\u2013303}}\n\nA more serious trial of strength concerned the military and the SA. By 1934, the generals were fearful of [[Ernst R\u00f6hm]]'s desire to have the SA, a force of over 3 million men, absorb the much smaller German Army into its ranks under his leadership. Further, reports of a huge cache of weapons in the hands of SA members gave the army commanders great concern.<ref>Kershaw, ''Hitler'', p 306.</ref> Matters came to a head in June 1934 when President von Hindenburg, who had the complete loyalty of the ''Reichswehr'', informed Hitler that if he did not move to curb the SA then Hindenburg would dissolve the Government and declare [[martial law]].{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=319\u2013320}} The ''Reichswehr'' leadership also pressured Hitler to act against the SA by threatening to block his plans for merging the offices of the Chancellorship and the Presidency after the soon to be expected death of the gravely ill Hindenburg.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=309\u2013314}} The result was the [[Night of the Long Knives]] which began on June 30, 1934, and led to the execution of the majority of the SA leadership, much to the barely veiled glee of the military.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=320\u2013323}}\n\nBritish historian A.J. Nicholls wrote that the popular stereotype of the German military in the 1920s\u20131930s as old-fashioned reactionary ''[[Junker (Prussia)|Junkers]]'' is incorrect, and a disproportionate number of officers had a technocratic bent, and instead of looking back to the Second Reich looked with confidence towards a new dynamic, [[high-tech]] and revolutionary future dominated by men like themselves.<ref name=\"Nicholls, A.J. pages 163-164\" /> The more technocratic the officer, the more likely he was to be a National Socialist.<ref name=\"Nicholls, A.J. pages 163-164\" /> Israeli historian [[Omer Bartov]] wrote that most officers were National Socialists \"because they believed had it not been for [Hitler] they would never have been able to realize their dreams of a highly modern, total war of expansion\".{{sfn|Bartov|1999|p=145}}\n\n===Growing alignment with Nazism===\nAs part of an effort to preserve the \"state within a state\", starting in the mid-1930s, the military began to more and more Nazify itself in an effort to persuade Hitler that it was not necessary to end the traditional \"state within a state\", to prevent ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' (\"synchronization\") being imposed by engaging in what [[Omer Bartov]] called a process of \"self-Gleichschaltung\".{{sfn|Bartov|1999|p=143}} As part and parcel of the process of \"self-Gleichschaltung\", the Defence Minister [[Werner von Blomberg]] in February 1934, acting on his own initiative, had all of the Jews serving in the ''Reichswehr'' given an automatic and immediate [[dishonorable discharge]].{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|p=268}} In this way, 74 Jewish soldiers lost their jobs for no other reason than that they were Jewish.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|p=268}} Again, on his own initiative Blomberg had the ''Reichswehr'' in May 1934 adopt Nazi symbols into their uniforms.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=312}} In August 1934, again on Blomberg's initiative and that of the ''Ministeramt'' chief General [[Walther von Reichenau]], the entire military took an [[Hitler oath|oath of personal loyalty]] to Hitler, who was most surprised at the offer; the popular view that Hitler imposed the oath on the military is false.<ref name=\"Kershaw, Ian page 525\">Kershaw, Ian ''Hitler Hubris'', New York: W.W. Norton, 1998 page 525.</ref> The intention of Blomberg and Reichenau in having the military swear an oath to Hitler was to create a personal special bond between Hitler and the military, which was intended to tie Hitler more tightly towards the military and away from the NSDAP.<ref name=\"Kershaw, Ian page 525\" /> The American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] wrote about the oath to Hitler: <blockquote>The assertion that most felt bound by their oath of loyalty to Hitler should be seen in the context of prior oaths and subsequent oaths taken and broken by the same individuals, especially in the highest ranks. They had sworn to uphold the Weimar constitution, and many had sworn to uphold its laws-which included the Versailles Treaty. It was considered desirable, even honourable, to break this oath as often as possible, and anyone who wanted to keep it was despised. After World War II, a substantial number of the military leaders were called on to testify under oath. Anyone who has studied their sworn testimony carefully will have noticed that many took this oath very lightly indeed. If of all the oaths generals and field marshals took, only the one to Hitler is so often cited, that may reveal more about their attitude toward Hitler than towards oaths.{{sfn|Weinberg|pp=481\u2013482}}</blockquote>\n\nThe unintentional effect of these measures to defend the \"state within a state\" by \"self-Gleichschaltung\" was to ultimately weaken such a status.{{sfn|Bartov|1999|p=143}} At the same time, a new generation of technocratic officers was coming to the fore which was less concerned about maintaining the \"state within a state\", and more comfortable about being integrated into the National Socialist ''Wehrstaat''. Bartov wrote about the new sort of technocratic officers and their views about the Nazi regime:<blockquote>The combined gratification of personal ambitions, technological obsessions and nationalist aspirations greatly enhanced their identification with Hitler's regime as individuals, professionals, representatives of a caste and leaders of a vast conscript army. Men such as Beck and Guderian, Manstein and Rommel, Doenitz and Kesselring, Milch and Udet cannot be described as mere soldiers strictly devoted to their profession, rearmament and the autonomy of the military establishment while remaining indifferent to and detached from Nazi rule and ideology. The many points of contact between Hitler and his young generals were thus important elements in the integration of the Wehrmacht into the Third Reich, in stark contradiction of its image as a \"haven\" from Nazism.{{sfn|Bartov|1999|p=145}}</blockquote>\n\nBecause of these conceptions of Germany being remade into a totalitarian ''Wehrstaat'', the leadership of the military welcomed and embraced the National Socialist regime.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|pp=267\u2013268}} The German historian [[J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster]] wrote that it was wrong as many historians have to dismiss the Wehrmacht's self-proclaimed role as one of the \"twin pillars\" of Nazi Germany (the other pillar being the NSDAP).{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|pp=267\u2013268}} General [[Ludwig Beck]] welcomed the coming of the Nazi regime in 1933, writing \"I have wished for years for the political revolution, and now my wishes have come true. It is the first ray of hope since 1918.\".{{sfn|May|p=33}} (Beck was later executed for opposing National Socialism.) In addition, many soldiers had previously been in the [[Hitler Youth]] and ''[[Reichsarbeitsdienst]]'' and had thus been subjected to intensive Nazi indoctrination; as a result, many newly commissioned officers were committed Nazis. In general, the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' (airforce) was heavily Nazi-influenced, as were the navy and army to a lesser degree, though that was only relative.{{cn|date=December 2019}} Caitlin Talmadge explains that Prussian martial tradition gave Hitler an advantage when it came to his officer corps. While most dictatorships had to make a trade-off between competence and loyalty when selecting their officers (due to the risk of facing a coup), Hitler found he had an ample supply of men who possessed both attributes, significantly reducing the coup risk Hitler faced from building an effective army. However, as the successor to a conventionally oriented imperial army of the German Empire, the Wehrmacht tended to fight more effectively than the Waffen-SS, as, within the SS, adherence to Nazism mattered more for advancement. Despite this, Hitler regretted not having purged his officer corps the way [[The Great Purge|Stalin did]].<ref>Talmadge, Caitlin.

Cornell University Press, 2015, p.256</ref>\n\nThe [[Blomberg\u2013Fritsch Affair]] of January\u2013February 1938 that ended with the dismissals of [[Werner von Fritsch]] as Army commander and [[Werner von Blomberg]] as War Minister was the first Nazi attempt to undermine the position of the military as a \"state within the state\".<ref name=\"Kallis, Aristotle page 89\">Kallis, Aristotle ''Fascist Ideology'', London: Routledge 2000 page 89.</ref> At the same time, Hitler abolished the War Ministry and replaced it with the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht|OKW]].<ref name=\"Kallis, Aristotle page 89\" /> The Blomberg-Fritsch Affair marked the moment when the leadership of the military began to change from the leaders of a more or less autonomous \"state within the state\" to that of a merely functional, technocratic elite that existed only to execute the F\u00fchrer's plans.<ref name=\"Kallis, Aristotle page 89\" /> In one of the last demonstrations of the power of the \"state within the state\", the Army again vetoed Hitler's plans to appoint [[Walter von Reichenau]] as Army commander, and following tense negotiations between Hitler and [[Gerd von Rundstedt]], who was acting as the Army's spokesman in this matter and who wanted [[Ludwig Beck]] as Fritsch's successor, agreed to [[Walter von Brauchitsch]] as a compromise.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|pp=370\u2013371}}\n\nOn December 8, 1938, the OKW had instructed all officers in all three services to be thoroughly versed in National Socialism and to apply its values in all situations. Starting in February 1939, pamphlets were issued that were made required reading in the military.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|p=270}} The content can be gauged by the titles: \"Hitler's World Historical Mission\", \"The Battle for German Living Space\", \"Hands off Danzig!\", and \"The Final Solution of the Jewish Question in the Third Reich\".

On March 3, 1941, Hitler summoned the entire military leadership to hear a secret speech about the upcoming [[Operation Barbarossa]] in which Hitler stressed that Barbarossa was to be a \"war of extermination\", that the German military was to disregard all the laws of war, and that he both expected and wanted to see the deaths of millions of people.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=190}} With the exception of Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]], who protested that this was both morally and legally wrong, none of the officers who heard Hitler's speech voiced any objections.{{sfn|Weinberg|p=190}}\n\nSince some of the officers, such as General [[Franz Halder]], who had previously argued with Hitler about military matters remained silent after hearing this speech, [[John Wheeler-Bennett]]  presumes that they had no objections to the sort of war that Hitler intended to wage.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=513}} In 1989, British historian [[Richard J.

It is the old battle of the Germanic against the Slavic people, of the defense of European culture against Muscovite-Asiatic inundation and of the repluse [sic] of Jewish Bolshevism. The objective of this battle must be the demolition of present-day Russia and must, therefore, be conducted with unprecedented severity. Every military action must be guided in planning and execution by an iron resolution to exterminate the enemy remorselessy [sic] and totally. In particular no adherents of the contemporary Russian Bolshevik system are to be spared.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1989|pp=500\u2013501}}</blockquote> Very typical of the German Army propaganda as part of the preparations for Barbarossa was the following passage from a pamphlet issued in June 1941:\n\n{{quote|Anyone who has ever looked into the face of a Red commissar knows what the Bolsheviks are.

Across the breadth of European Russia, the invading Germans took matters into their own hands, as Hitler intended. Einsatzgruppen were responsible for the great bulk of the killing, but they received full cooperation from the Army. At [[Babi Yar Massacre|Babi Yar]] outside of Kiev, SS-Sonderkommando 4a murdered 33,771 Jews and other Soviet citizens in a two-day orgy of violence in revenge for Soviet destruction of Kiev. The local army commander, Major General Kurt Eberhard, cooperated enthusiastically, even providing the SS with an army propaganda company to persuade Kiev's Jews that they were moving for resettlement. On numerous occasions, troop commanders ordered their men to participate in \"special actions\" against Jews and Communists. The repetitive nature of such orders suggests the level of cooperation between SS and Army that occurred throughout the German advance. Everywhere the Germans advanced, the tide of murder, violence, and destruction followed, on Jews above all, but on the Soviet population in general.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=141}}</blockquote>\n\n===National Socialists within the armed forces===\nThe British historian [[Richard J. Evans]] wrote that junior officers in the Army were inclined to be especially zealous National Socialists with a third of them having joined the Nazi Party by 1941.{{sfn|Evans|p=59}} Reinforcing the work of the junior leaders were the National Socialist Leadership Guidance Officers, which were created with the purpose of indoctrinating the troops for the \"war of extermination\" against Soviet Russia.{{sfn|Evans|p=59}} Among higher-ranking officers, 29.2% were NSDAP members by 1941.{{sfn|Bartov|1986|p=49}} The ''Wehrmacht'' obeyed Hitler's criminal orders for Barbarossa not because of obedience to orders, but because they, like Hitler, believed that the Soviet Union was run by Jews and that Germany must completely destroy \"[[Judeo-Bolshevism]]\".{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|p=273}} German historian J\u00fcrgen F\u00f6rster wrote that most ''Wehrmacht'' officers genuinely believed that most [[Red Army commissars]] were Jews who in turn were what kept the [[Red Army]] going and that the best way to bring about victory against the Soviet Union was to exterminate the commissars via enforcing the [[Commissar Order]] so as to deprive the Russian soldiers of their Jewish leaders.{{sfn|F\u00f6rster|1998|p=274}} \n\n[[S\u00f6nke Neitzel|Sonke Neitzel]] and [[Harald Welzer]] opine that the Wehrmacht \"were participants in, if not executioners of, unparalleled mass murder.\" Using transcriptions of secret records of conversations among POWs, they conclude that most soldiers were not interested in ideology and politics. In reality, being a Nazi, supporting anti-Semitism, and possessing the willingness to kill and commit unnecessary violence usually had nothing to do with each other: many hated the Jews but were shocked at mass extermination by firing squads, while some \"anti-Nazis\" supported anti-Jewish policies. {{sfn|Neitzel|Welzer|2012|pp=13-14}} \n\nFrom 1943 onwards, the influx of officers and conscripts who had been mainly educated under the Nazis began to further increase the National Socialism in the army.<ref>[[Antony Beevor|Beevor, Antony]] (1998).

A sign of the close ties between Hitler and his armed forces was his choice of the ardent Nazi Grand Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] to be the next F\u00fchrer, a man whose \"...dedication to National Socialist ideas and his close identification with Hitler's strategy in the last stages of the war made him a logical, not surprising, choice by Hitler as his successor\".{{sfn|Weinberg|p=826}}\n===Impact of ideology on war-making ability===\nThe Israeli historian [[Omer Bartov]] wrote that on the Eastern Front, it was the belief in National Socialism that allowed the Wehrmacht to continue to fight, despite enormous losses.{{sfn|Bartov|1999|pp=137\u2013139}} Bartov argued that the claim that it was \"primary group loyalty\", by which men are motivated to fight by loyalty towards their comrades in their unit with little thought to the cause that one is fighting for, cannot possibly have been what motivated the Wehrmacht to fight on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Bartov|1999|pp=137\u2013138}} Bartov wrote that on the Eastern Front, the Wehrmacht was taking such heavy losses that there were no \"primary groups\" for men to give their loyalty to and that only a belief in National Socialism could explain why the Wehrmacht continued to be so aggressive and determined on the offensive, and so dogged and tenacious on the defence, despite often very high numbers of dead and wounded.{{sfn|Bartov|1999|pp=137\u2013138}} The Bartov thesis was endorsed by American historians Alan Millet and Williamson Murray, who wrote that, by early 1944, \"group cohesion alone\" could not explain why the German soldiers carried on fighting:\n\n<blockquote>The explanation seems to be that at every level German officers inculcated their troops with the values and assumptions of Nazi ideology and the mortal menace of the racial-Communist threat. By early 1944, ideological indoctrination was playing a major role in combat preparation on the Eastern and Western fronts. After the war, German generals claimed that neither they nor their troops had taken ideological instruction seriously, but the evidence suggests otherwise. Not only letters and diaries of combat soldiers indicate that ideology was a considerable factor in German combat effectiveness, but unit commanders from the division level on down consistently picked highly decorated combat officers to serve as \"leadership\" officers in charge of troop indoctrination. Such assignments underline the seriousness with which the army as a whole was taking ideological motivation.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|pp=396\u2013397}}</blockquote>\n\nStephen Fritz argues that the Nazis' vision of the ''volksgemeinschaft'', a classless society which would balance individual achievement with group solidarity, cooperation with competition, as the individual fulfilled their potential within the framework of the broader community, was an immensely powerful vision to many German soldiers, to the extent they were willing to overlook its racist and anti-Semitic essence. This vision allowed Hitler to maintain popular support amongst German soldiers right up until the end of the war and inspired fierce devotion and loyalty.<ref>Fritz, Stephen.

Since the military envisioned any future war as a total one that would require the complete mobilisation of German society, military leaders pursued the volksgemeinschaft as a means of realising national unity. According to Fritz, it was not simply rhetoric - the officer corp began to become the least snobbish in German history, opening up positions based on talent and had a general sympathy to the volksgemeinschaft; Hitler spoke proudly of this process. Hitler and his generals shared a vision in which the spirit of the Frontgemeinschaft of the First World War would become a permanent state of affairs.<ref>Fritz, Stephen. Frontsoldaten: The German Soldier in World War II. University Press of Kentucky, 1997, p.209</ref> \n\nMacGregor Knox explains that traditionally, the German officer corp had been dominated by the German nobility and upper-classes. During his rule, Hitler broke down this institutional preference and created a \"people's officer corps\" - Knox observes that in 1937, 14% of lieutenants had been noble, yet this fell to 4% by 1943. While in 1941 90% of officer candidates possessed the ''Abitur'', an elite secondary-school leaving certificate, by the second half of the war this fell to 44% and 12% of officers had only primary education, while candidates from lower-class backgrounds had risen from 5% in 1937 to 20% in 1942. By removing the institutional social restrictions on who could become an officer, Hitler instead made rank dependent upon combat ability and \u00e9lan, thus encouraging soldiers to fight even harder to earn the prospect of a swift rise through the ranks. The Wehrmacht thus became a \"soldier's community\" fused by shared ambition, fanaticism, and crime. The Nazi \"pursuit of happiness\" thus immunised both the military and German society at large from a repeat of 1918 and while incapable of delaying the defeat of the regime, ensured many soldiers held out far longer than they may otherwise have.<ref>Knox, MacGregor. \"1 October 1942: Adolf Hitler, Wehrmacht officer policy, and social revolution.\" The Historical Journal 43, no. 3 (2000): 801-825.</ref>\n\nIn 1944, the [[20 July plot]] involving a minority of officers received overwhelming disapproval from the Wehrmacht, who rallied for the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Bartov|1999|p=136}} The American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] wrote about the July 20 ''putsch'' and the military: \"As both sides sent their orders over the teleprinters in Germany's last 'election' as a united country until 1990, most generals chose to support the Hitler regime and to reinforce rather than arrest the police.\"{{sfn|Weinberg|p=754}} The July 20 ''putsch'' attempt was crushed by Army troops commanded by Major [[Otto Ernst Remer]] with no involvement from the SS.{{cn|date=January 2020}} Stephen Fritz explains that the putsch was seen by soldiers at the front as the treacherous actions of an unrepresentative aristocratic clique and that by that point in the war, the Wehrmacht had become essentially \"Nazified.\"<ref>Fritz, Stephen.

University Press of Kentucky, 1997.</ref>{{page needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n== Mechanisms of control ==\n\n=== Terror===\nBecause the military believed that Germany had not been defeated in World War I, the lesson that the Wehrmacht took from this was for the need for a draconian military justice system that would ruthlessly stamp out anything that might lead to any new \"[[Stab-in-the-back myth|stab in the back]]\".{{sfn|Bartov|1999|p=141}} It had been neither forgotten nor forgiven by the military that the [[German Revolution of 1918\u20131919|November Revolution]] had started with the [[Kiel mutiny|High Seas mutiny]]. In August 1917, there had been a mutiny in the High Seas Fleet, which after it was crushed, saw the execution of its leaders' [[Max Reichpietsch]] and [[Albin K\u00f6bis]] with the rest of the mutineers given long prison sentences. The \"lesson\" drawn by the Navy and the rest of the Wehrmacht had been that if only the High Seas Fleet mutiny of 1917 been followed up with more executions instead of just Reichpietsch and K\u00f6bis, then the much more serious mutiny of November 1918 would have been avoided. For this reason, all violations of the military code that hindered the war effort were treated by military courts as equivalent to high treason, though in the vast majority of the cases, politics were not a factor.{{sfn|Bartov|1999|p=141}}\n\nDuring World War II, the German military had thousands of its members executed, often for the most trivial violations of discipline.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=397}} In World War I, the German Army had executed only 48 of its soldiers; in World War II between 13,000 and 15,000 German soldiers were executed for violations of military code.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|pp=396\u2013337}} The German historians' [[Manfred Messerschmidt]] and Fritz W\u00fcllner in a 1987 study of Wehrmacht justice have argued that the figure of 15,000 executed is too low, as it only records verdicts handed down by military courts and that in the last months of the war, the Wehrmacht abandoned even the pretence of holding trials, and simply executed extrajudicially so-called \"defeatists\".{{sfn|Kitterman|p=459}} Messerschmidt and W\u00fcllner contended that, if one takes into account extrajudicial executions, the real figure is about 30,000 executions of Wehrmacht personnel between 1939 and 1945.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=459}} The only country that executed more of its own servicemen than Germany in World War II was the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=397}} By way of contrast, during all of World War II, Britain executed 40 of its servicemen, France executed 102 and the United States executed 146 while the Wehrmacht executed 519 of its personnel during the first 13 months of the war alone.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=459}} In addition, German courts-martial sentenced ten of thousands of German soldiers to service in ''[[Strafbattalion]]'' (penal battalions). Their conditions were so brutal that service in a Wehrmacht penal battalion was equivalent to a death sentence.{{sfn|Murray & Millet|p=397}} Those sentenced to serve in the penal battalions called them \"death battalions\" given the fact that the chances for survival were almost nil.<ref name=\"Hadden 2009\">{{cite web | last = Hadden | first = Gerry | authorlink = | title = Nazi Deserters Pardoned | publisher = The World |date=October 12, 2009| url = http://www.pri.org/stories/2009-10-12/nazi-deserters-pardoned | doi = | accessdate = 2012-04-13 }}</ref>\n\nThe exception towards the otherwise ferocious application of military justice was the widespread tolerance of war crimes against civilians and POWs, especially in Eastern Europe, provided that such actions took place in a \"disciplined\" and \"orderly\" way.{{sfn|Bartov|1999|pp=140\u2013142}} So-called \"wild shootings\" and \"wild requisitions\" against civilians were always disapproved of, whereas massive violence against civilians provided that it took place in a context that was \"disciplined\" and pseudo-legal were considered to be acceptable.{{sfn|Bartov|1999|pp=141\u2013142}} This was especially the case with Jews in the occupied areas of the Soviet Union, where it was official policy to generally not prosecute those soldiers who killed Soviet Jews, and even in those cases, where prosecutions did occur, claiming that one hated Jews and killed out of a desire for \"revenge\" for the November Revolution of 1918 was allowed as a defence (though in fact, the Soviet Jewish population had nothing to do with the November Revolution).{{sfn|Kitterman|p=460}} German military courts always gave very light sentences to those soldiers who killed Soviet Jews, even in an \"undisciplined\" way, and even then, Hitler usually intervened to pardon the accused.{{sfn|Kitterman|pp=461\u2013462}}\n\nOn 17 August 1938 the German military code was re-written to make desertion equivalent to high treason, and created a new crime of ''[[Wehrkraftzersetzung]]'' (literally: \"subversion of the war effort\"), a vaguely defined crime that carried the death penalty for anyone serving in the Wehrmacht who either attempted to influence others to not carry out orders fully and unconditionally and/or weakened the resolve of the German nation to continue the fight until total victory.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=457}} About 20% of the death sentences imposed by Wehrmacht courts were for ''Wehrkraftzersetzung''.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=455}} ''Wehrkraftzersetzung'' was so vaguely defined as to constitute anything from grumbling about the quality of food to making unflattering remarks about an officer. German military courts-martial consisted of three judges, one lawyer serving as a prosecutor, and two Wehrmacht men, usually a staff officer and another man, who was expected to be of the same rank as the defendant.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=458}} In theory, the defendant had the automatic right to a defence lawyer for all charges that involved the death penalty and could be granted defence counsel in a non-capital case only if the court decided to permit that privilege, but in practice, the right to defence counsel was rarely granted, even in cases that carried capital punishment where the law required it.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=458}}\n\nThe abrogation of the rights of the accused was part of the \"simplified operating procedure\", which as its name implied stripped away rights from the defendant, and turned the courts-martial into a drumhead tribunal that was not concerned with questions of innocence and guilt, but rather how harsh the punishment would be.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=458}} After the sentence was passed, there was no right of judicial appeal, and the case went up to the commander of the fleet, army or air fleet that the defendant was serving in, who could either confirm the sentence or order a new trial if he believed the sentence to be either too harsh or too lenient.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=458}} All commanders received advice from a panel of judges which was not binding, but usually acted upon.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=459}} The system served to deflect responsibility; commanders who upheld death sentences claimed that they were only following the advice of the judges while the judges claimed that their opinions were purely advisory, and the actual responsibility to uphold the death sentences rested with the commander.{{sfn|Kitterman|p=459}}\n\nA major latter-day debate about German military justice has been the demand by families of Wehrmacht men executed for desertion that they should be recognized as part of the resistance to Hitler under the grounds that by refusing to fight for the Nazi regime, they were also opposing it. Messerschmidt and W\u00fcllner wrote that many of Wehrmacht desertions were politically motivated out of disgust with the genocidal politics of the Nazi regime, and that \"Whom were these military judges serving who sent soldiers to their deaths? In numerous judgments, this question is clearly answered: they were serving the ''F\u00fchrer'', final victory, Nazi Germany\".{{sfn|Kitterman|p=456}} German veterans have for the most part been opposed to this. Only in September 2009 did Germany pardon the men convicted of desertion under the grounds that to desert from a criminal war was not a crime.<ref name=\"Hadden 2009\" /> At the time, there were three Wehrmacht deserters still alive, the vast majority having been either executed or killed in penal battalions during the war, and the few who survived the war were shunned as traitors and cowards by the German public after the war.<ref name=\"Hadden 2009\" /> One of the surviving deserters, a sailor who attempted to desert in 1942 named Ludwig Baumann, summarized the arguments against people such as himself as: <blockquote>\"It went like this: an act of treason might have endangered the lives of other German soldiers, therefore we can't absolve you. But what I say is, if only more soldiers had committed treason so many millions of lives could have been saved, in the concentration camps and so on. You can't place the lives of some soldiers above all those millions who died. And until Germany recognizes this, it will not have broken with its Nazi past.\"<ref name=\"Hadden 2009\" /></blockquote>\n\n===Corruption===\n{{Main|Corruption within the Wehrmacht}}\nIn order to ensure the absolute loyalty of the Wehrmacht officers, Hitler had created what the American historian [[Gerhard Weinberg]] called a \"...a vast secret program of bribery involving practically all at the highest levels of command\".{{sfn|Weinberg|p=455}} Hitler routinely presented his leading commanders with \"gifts\" of free estates, cars, cheques made out for large sums of cash and lifetime exemptions from paying taxes.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=529}}\n\nTypical of the F\u00fchrer's \"gifts\" was the cheque made out for a half-million Reichmarks presented to Field-Marshal [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]] in October 1942 together with the promise that Kluge could bill the German treasury for improvements to his estate.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=529}} Such was the success of Hitler's bribery system that by 1942 many officers had come to expect \"gifts\" from Hitler and were not willing to bite the hand that so generously fed them.{{sfn|Wheeler-Bennett|p=529}} When Hitler sacked Field Marshal [[Fedor von Bock]] in December 1941, Bock's first reaction was to contact Hitler's aide [[Rudolf Schmundt]] to ask him if his sacking meant that he was no longer to receive the money.{{sfn|Goda|p=124}}\n\nThe first officer to be bribed into loyalty was the old World War I hero Field Marshal [[August von Mackensen]], who criticized the Nazi regime for the murder of General [[Kurt von Schleicher]] in a speech before General Staff Association in February 1935. To silence him, Hitler gave Mackensen a free estate of 1,250 [[hectare]]s later that same year in exchange for a promise never to criticize the Nazi regime again in either public or private.{{sfn|Goda|p=110}} The agreement mostly worked; Mackensen never criticized the Nazi regime in public again, through Hitler was offended in February 1940 when Mackensen mentioned to [[Walter von Brauchitsch]] that the army had disgraced itself by committing massacres during the recent campaign in Poland. Hitler felt that to be a violation of their agreement of 1935, though Mackensen kept his estate.{{sfn|Goda|p=110}}\n\n====''Konto'' 5 fund====\nThe basis of the corruption system were regular monthly tax-free payments of 4,000 Reichmarks for field marshals and grand admirals and 2,000 Reichmarks for all other senior officers, which came from a special fund called ''Konto'' 5 run by the chief of the Reich Chancellery [[Hans Lammers]].{{sfn|Goda|p=102}} In addition, officers received as birthday presents cheques usually made out for the sum of 250,000 Reichmarks, which were exempt from income taxes.{{sfn|Goda|p=111}} This money was on top of the official salary of 26,000 Reichmarks a year for [[Field Marshal (Germany)|field marshals]] and [[grand admiral]]s and 24,000 Reichmarks a year for [[Colonel General|colonel generals]] and [[general admiral]]s.{{sfn|Goda|p=108}} Senior officers were given a life-time exemption from paying income tax (up to 65 per cent by 1939); they also received spending allowances for food, medical care, clothing, and housing.{{sfn|Goda|p=108}} By way of contrast, infantrymen were given the task of clearing landmines, were given one Reichsmark a day danger pay supplement.{{sfn|Goda|p=108}} The money from ''Konto'' 5 was deposited for the officer's life-time, and did not stop if the officer retired.{{sfn|Goda|p=113}}\n\nThe ''Konto'' 5 slush fund started with a budget of about 150,000 R.M in 1933 and by 1945 had grown to about 40 million R.M.{{sfn|Goda|p=102}} Payments from ''Konto'' 5, known officially as ''Aufwandsentsch\u00e4digungen'' (compensation for expenses) were made to Cabinet ministers and senior civil servants from April 1936 onwards.{{sfn|Goda|p=103}} As part of the reorganization of the military command structure following the [[Blomberg\u2013Fritsch Affair]] in early 1938, it was declared that the service chiefs, namely OKW chief [[Wilhelm Keitel]], Army commander [[Walter von Brauchitsch]], Luftwaffe commander [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] and Kriegsmarine commander [[Erich Raeder]] were to have the same status as Cabinet ministers and as such, they all started to receive publicly the same pay as a Cabinet member and privately payments from ''Konto'' 5.{{sfn|Goda|p=130}}\n\n====Nature of payments====\nEvery officer who started to receive the money always had a meeting first with Lammers, who informed them that the future payments would depend on how much loyalty they were willing to show Hitler, and what the F\u00fchrer gave with one hand, could just as easily be taken away with the other.{{sfn|Goda|p=105}} Payments from ''Konto'' 5 to the bank account of General [[Friedrich Paulus]] stopped in August 1943 not because Paulus had lost the [[Battle of Stalingrad]], but because Paulus had gone on Soviet radio to blame Hitler for the defeat.{{sfn|Goda|p=106}}\n\nIn the same way, after the failure of the [[20 July plot|July 20 ''putsch'']] of 1944, the families of [[Erwin Rommel]], [[Franz Halder]], [[Friedrich Fromm]] and [[G\u00fcnther von Kluge]] were punished by being cut off from the monthly payments from ''Konto'' 5.{{sfn|Goda|p=106}} In the case of Field Marshal [[Erwin von Witzleben]], it was demanded that his family pay back all of the bribe money he had taken from ''Konto'' 5 since the money was given as a reward for loyalty to the F\u00fchrer, which Witzleben was evidently not.{{sfn|Goda|p=106}} The illicit nature of these payments was underlined by Lammers who would warn an officer that was to receive money from ''Konto'' 5 not to speak about these payments to anyone and to keep as few written records as possible.{{sfn|Goda|p=105}}\n\n====Consequences====\nThe American historian [[Norman J.W. Goda|Norman Goda]] wrote that after General [[Heinz Guderian]] received a free estate of 937 hectares in Poland in the spring of 1943, that the doubts that he had been expressing since late 1941 about the Hitler's military leadership suddenly ceased, and he became one of Hitler's most ardent military supporters, or as [[Joseph Goebbels]] described him in his diary, \"a glowing and unqualified follower of the F\u00fchrer\".{{sfn|Goda|p=126}} Before receiving the estate, Guderian as Inspector General for the Panzers had been opposed to the plans for Operation Zitadelle, which subsequently led to Wehrmacht's failure in the [[Battle of Kursk]]; after receiving the estate, he apparently changed his mind.{{sfn|Goda|p=126}} Instead of criticizing Zitadelle openly, Guderian approached Goebbels to ask him if he could somehow talk Hitler out of Zitadelle, behaviour that Goda described as very atypical for Guderian.{{sfn|Goda|p=126}} During the 20 July ''putsch'' of 1944, Guderian ordered Panzer units to Berlin to crush it, and then sat on the Court of Honor that had the responsibility of expelling officers involved so that they could be tried before the [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]], a duty that Guderian performed with considerable zeal.{{sfn|Goda|pp=126\u2013127}} It was only after January 1945, when Guderian's estate fell behind Soviet lines that Guderian began to once more to disagree with Hitler, leading to Guderian being fired as Chief of the General Staff in March 1945.{{sfn|Goda|p=127}}\n\nGoda used Field Marshal [[Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb]] as an all-too-typical example of a Wehrmacht officer whose greed overwhelmed any moral revulsion that they might have felt about the \"[[Final Solution]]\".{{sfn|Goda|p=112\u2013113}} In late June-early July 1941, Leeb, as the commander of [[Army Group North]], had witnessed the massacres of Jews by the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'', Lithuanian auxiliaries and the men of the [[16th Army (Wehrmacht)|16th Army]] outside of Kaunas.{{sfn|Goda|p=112}} Leeb was described as being \"moderately disturbed\", and sent in mildly critical reports about the massacres.{{sfn|Goda|p=112}} Leeb approved of the killing of Jewish men, claiming that this was justified by their supposed crimes during the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, but that the killing of women and children might have been taking things too far.<ref>[[Helmut Krausnick|Krausnick, Helmut]] & Wilhelm, Hans-Heinrich ''Die Truppe des Weltanschauungskrieges: Die Einsatzgruppen der Sicherheitspolizei und des SD 1938\u20131942'', Stuttgart: 1981 pages 207\u2013209.</ref> In response, Hitler's aide General [[Rudolf Schmundt]] told Leeb that he was out of line and should in the future co-operate fully with the SS in \"special tasks\".{{sfn|Goda|p=112}} Schmundt asked if Leeb appreciated his monthly payments from ''Konto'' 5, and reminded him that his birthday was coming up, for which the F\u00fchrer was planning to give him a 250,000 R.M cheque for his loyalty. Leeb never again protested about the massacres, and duly received 250,000 R.M in September 1941.{{sfn|Goda|p=112\u2013113}} In the same month, [[Franz Walter Stahlecker]], the commander of ''Einsatzgruppe'' A, in a report to Berlin praised Leeb's Army Group for its exemplary co-operation.<ref>Hilberg, Raul ''[[The Destruction of the European Jews]]'', New York: Holmes & Meier, 1985, p. 301</ref>\n\nThe subject of corruption proved to be embarrassing for its recipients. Under oath at Nuremberg, [[Walther von Brauchitsch]] committed perjury when he denied taking any bribes.{{sfn|Goda|p=123}} Brauchitsch's bank records showed that he had been receiving 4,000 R.M/month payments from ''Konto'' 5 from 1938 until the end of the war.{{sfn|Goda|p=123}} At his trial in 1948, General [[Franz Halder]] perjured himself when he denied that he had taken bribes, and then had to maintain a stern silence when the American prosecutor [[James M. McHaney]] produced bank records showing otherwise.{{sfn|Goda|p=123}} Weinberg commented that \"the bribery system understandably does not figure prominently in the endless memoir literature of the recipients and has attracted little scholarly attention\".{{sfn|Weinberg|p=1045}}\n\n=== Chaplaincy ===\n{{see also|Military chaplain#World War II}}\nIn the Wehrmacht, chaplains were required to serve at the front under fire.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=123}} This regulation was introduced by the Nazi regime, which strong and barely veiled anti-Christian tendencies out of the hope that it might be led to the most of the chaplaincy getting killed in battle.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=123}} Protestant chaplains carried firearms, were required to undergo military training, were expected to fight if necessary and those Protestant clergymen who were World War I veterans were given preference in recruiting chaplains.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=137}} Catholic chaplains, by contrast, were unarmed, did not receive military training and were not expected to fight.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=137}} All chaplains, Catholic and Protestant had to know first-aid because of their role in ministering at the front.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=137}}\n\nA great many of the Protestant [[Military chaplain|chaplains]] in the Wehrmacht were members of the [[German Christians|\"German Christian\"]] movement that sought to \"de-Judize\" Christianity, and even those chaplains who were not members of the \"German Christian\" movement were influenced by it in various ways.{{sfn|Bergen|1997|pp=523\u2013524}} Because of their emphasis upon an aggressively \"manly\", militaristic and ultra-nationalistic interpretation of Christianity, a disproportionate number of German Christian pastors joined the Wehrmacht to serve as chaplains.{{sfn|Bergen|1997|p=524}} The requirement that Lutheran chaplains serve at the front with firearms served to attract German Christian pastors, most of whom were World War I veterans who saw a chance to practice what they preached by becoming figuratively \"combat priests\". Likewise, the Wehrmacht favoured the recruitment of German Christian pastors, and banned those pastors belonging to the [[Confessing Church]] from becoming chaplains.{{sfn|Bergen|1997|p=526}} Both Heinrich Lonicier, the Lutheran bishop of Breslau (modern [[Wroc\u0142aw]], Poland) who was also a senior Army chaplain, a leading German Christian and NSDAP member and the equally ardent German Christian and NSDAP member Friedrich Ronneberger, the Navy's chief Protestant chaplain had ambitions to become the ''Reich'' bishop of the Lutheran church, and saw the military as a basis for achieving their ambitions.{{sfn|Bergen|1997|pp=524\u2013525}} Lonicier, in particular, enjoyed the open backing of his close friends [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Walter von Brauchitsch]] in his attempts to depose the Lutheran ''Reich'' bishop [[Ludwig M\u00fcller (theologian)|Ludwig M\u00fcller]].{{sfn|Bergen|1997|p=524}} However, Bishop Lonicier's efforts created powerful opposition from the SS and other NSDAP elements who argued that the incompetent M\u00fcller made for a far more pliable ''Reich'' bishop than what the able and vigorous Lonicier would ever be, and that anyhow Lonicier's plans for a military-backed Nazified Lutheran church under his leadership playing a major role in German public life conflicted directly with their plans to ultimately do away with Christianity altogether in favour of a revived paganism.{{sfn|Bergen|1997|p=524}}\n\nAs part of their efforts to promote \"Aryan Christianity\" in the Wehrmacht, the Old Testament was in effect banned, and only the New Testament was available to Wehrmacht members.{{sfn|Bergen|1997|p=529}} In the same way, German Christian chaplains preached a \"manly Christianity\" to Wehrmacht members that unabashedly glorified war as the only fit and proper activity for \"real men\".{{sfn|Bergen|1997|p=533}} Besides for being outspoken supporters of the war, German Christian Wehrmacht chaplains preached in their sermons support for the Nazi regime, antisemitism, and the superiority of the \"Aryan race\" over all others.{{sfn|Bergen|1997|p=534}} Owing to the fear of death and disfigurement faced by men in the chaos of battlefields everywhere together with the loss of friends and comrades, many Wehrmacht men sought solace in religion, and so the chaplains had considerable spiritual influence with the Wehrmacht rank and file.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=134}} Moreover, the vast majority of Germans of that generation regularly attended church, and so the chaplains had a greater role in the social life of the Wehrmacht than what chaplains do today in a more secular age. Despite their support for the Nazi regime, the anti-Christian tendencies of the regime meant that it did its utmost to restrict both the numbers and powers of chaplains including the German Christians throughout the war.{{sfn|Bergen|1997|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nThere was no equivalent to the German Christian Movement in the Catholic Church, but most Catholic chaplains supported the regime as much as their Protestant counterparts did, albeit in a much less vocal form.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|pp=126 & 128}} [[Franz-Justus Rarkowski]], the Catholic bishop who was the chief Catholic chaplain of the Wehrmacht was a strong supporter of the regime. In his Christmas message in 1940 for Catholics serving in the Wehrmacht, Bishop Rarkowski used the occasion to blame the Jews not only for the war but for every problem in German history.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=134}} Perhaps more typical was the case of a Catholic chaplain named Ernst Tewes serving on the Eastern Front, known not to be a supporter of the regime who had led the protests against the massacre at Belaya Tserkov in August 1941, but by November 1941 had come to accept genocide as normal.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=127}} In his diary, Tewes wrote that the war was terrible for everyone concerned, that watching the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' massacre Jews was another of the war's horrors that the German Catholic soldier had to learn to accept just he had learned to accept it, and that because he believed that most partisans were Russian Jews, that it was the Jews' own fault that they were being massacred.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=127}} Presumably, what Tewes was writing in his diary reflected what he was preaching in his sermons. It is likely that Father Tewes in face of pervasive violence against civilians and the futility of protest had been numbered into a passive acceptance of what he knew to be wrong, hence his repeated attempts in his diary to justify to himself the actions of the ''Einsatzgruppen'' as something forced on the Germans by alleged Jewish partisans.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=127}} Another Catholic chaplain serving on the Eastern Front was deeply shocked when another Catholic chaplain told him \"There is a curse upon this people [Jews] ever since the crucifixion of Jesus when they cried: \"Let his blood be on our heads and the heads of our children\", and as such, the Jews were only getting what they deserved.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|pp=128\u2013129}}\n\nA large part of the reason why most chaplains, both Protestant and Catholic supported the regime was due to the intense background checks performed on any priest who wanted to join the Wehrmacht as a chaplain by their own churches (who did not want any \"trouble-makers\" becoming chaplains lest they strain an already fraught relationship with the regime), the Gestapo and the Wehrmacht.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=133}} Mindful of the important role chaplains played in the social life of the Wehrmacht, any priest who had done or said anything \"pro-Jewish\" in the past was instantly disqualified from becoming a chaplain.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=133}} The American historian Doris Bergen wrote that a great number of Lutheran and Catholic priests must have been either anti-Semitics or at least not done anything \"pro-Jewish\" as the Wehrmacht never suffered from a shortage of chaplains despite the \"high\" standards they had imposed in 1935 for the new expanded Wehrmacht created by the return of conscription, which was maintained right to the end of 1945.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=133}} Only a \"handful\" of potential chaplains were excluded by the Gestapo for \"pro-Jewish\" actions in the past.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=133}} Moreover, the energetic activities of the German Christian pastors together with the general anti-Christian tone of the regime led to those chaplains who were not German Christians to incorporate aspects of their theology as a way of counteracting their influence.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=133}}\n\nDespite the screening process, there were occasions when chaplains did protest. In August 1941, when the commander of the 6th Army, General [[Walter von Reichenau]] ordered his men to assist the ''Einsatzgruppen'' and its Ukrainian auxiliaries with shooting the Jewish children at an orphanage in [[Bila Tserkva|Belaya Tserkov]] who had been rendered orphans after their parents had been shot in the preceding days, the Protestant and Catholic chaplains, namely Pastor Wilczek and Father Ernst Tewes attached to 295th Infantry Division made strenuous efforts first to save the children, and when that failed, to protest the massacre.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|pp=124\u2013126}} In 1968 Father Tewes was a leading witness for the prosecution at the trial of the SS leaders who had ordered the massacre at Belaya Tserkov, where he noted that \"All those we wanted to save, were shot. Because of our initiative it just happened a few days later than planned\".{{sfn|Bergen|2001|pp=125\u2013126}} Even more dramatic was the case at a military base outside of Stettin (modern [[Szczecin]], Poland), where two local Catholic chaplains, disgusted by atrocities that one had seen while serving in Poland in 1939, formed an oppositional group, the \"Wednesday Circle\" for Catholic soldiers, where they provided detailed information about the \"Final Solution\" and predicted God would punish Germany with the most terrible defeat for the Holocaust.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|pp=130\u2013131}} Betrayed when one of the soldiers they had recruited to the \"Wednesday Circle\" denounced them, Fathers {{ill|Herbert Simoleit|de}} and [[Friedrich Lorenz]] were convicted by a court-martial for high treason and executed in November 1944.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=131}}\n\nBergen wrote that such case was the exception, not the rule, and most chaplains loyally supported the regime.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|pp=131\u2013133}} Only ten out of a thousand chaplains were known to protest genocide.{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=129}} Bergen wrote that by rationalizing the ''[[Shoah]]'' as something the Jews had brought down on themselves, and by doing their utmost to maintain morale, the majority of military chaplains played an important role in maintaining the fighting spirit of the Wehrmacht, and thereby in their own way helped to prolong the war, and with it the \"Final Solution\".{{sfn|Bergen|2001|p=134}}\n\n==See also==\n;Overviews\n* [[History of Germany]]\n* [[Military history of Germany]]\n*[[German Army (1935\u20131945)]]\n* [[Luftwaffe]]\n;Specific issues\n* [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht]]\n* [[German war crimes]]\n* [[War crimes in occupied Poland during World War II]]\n* [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation]]\n*[[Consequences of Nazism]]\n* [[Guidelines for the Conduct of the Troops in Russia]]\n;General reference entries\n* [[Glossary of Nazi Germany]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bartov\n  | first = Omer\n  | authorlink = Omer Bartov\n  | year = 1999\n  | chapter = Soldiers, Nazis and War in the Third Reich\n  | pages = 129\u2013150\n  | title = The Third Reich: The Essential Readings\n  | editor-last = Leitz\n  | editor-first = Christian\n  | publisher = Blackwell\n  | location = London\n  | isbn = 978-0-631-20700-9\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite book\n  | last = Bartov\n  | first = Omer\n  | year = 1986\n  | title = The Eastern Front, 1941\u201345: German Troops and the Barbarisation of Warfare\n  | publisher = St. Martin's Press\n  | location = New York\n  | isbn = 978-0-312-22486-8\n  | ref = harv\n  }}\n* {{cite journal\n  | last = Bergen\n  | first = Doris\n  |date=September 1997\n  | title = 'Germany Is Our Mission: Christ Is Our Strength!'

With a total estimated population of 69,122, Walnut Creek serves as a hub for its neighboring cities because of its location at the junction of the highways from [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] ([[Interstate 680 (California)|I-680]]) and San Francisco/Oakland ([[California State Route 24|SR-24]]) and its accessibility by [[BART]]. Its active downtown neighborhood features hundred-year-old buildings and extensive high-end retail establishments, restaurants and entertainment venues.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Downtown Walnut Creek 02 BW.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Walnut Creek]]\nThere are three bands of [[Bay Miwok]] Indians associated with early Walnut Creek:<ref name=\"Forester\">Forester, 2006.</ref><ref name=\"Milliken\">Milliken, 1995</ref> the Saclan, whose territory extended through the hills east of present-day [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Rossmoor, Walnut Creek, California|Rossmoor]], [[Lafayette, California|Lafayette]], [[Moraga, California|Moraga]] and Walnut Creek; the Volvon (also spelled Bolbon, Wolwon and Zuicun) near [[Mt. Diablo]]; and the Tactan located on the San Ramon Creek in [[Danville, California|Danville]] and Walnut Creek.\n\nToday's Walnut Creek is located within the earlier site of four Mexican land grants. One of these land grants{{snds}}measuring {{convert|18000|acre|km2}}{{snds}}belonged to Juana Sanchez de Pacheco, who eventually passed the land down to her two grandsons. Ygnacio Sibrian, one of the grandsons, created the first roofed home in the valley in about 1850. The grant was called [[Rancho Arroyo de Las Nueces y Bolbones]], named after the principal waterway, ''Arroyo de las Nueces'' (Walnut Creek), as well as for the local group of indigenous Americans (''Bolbones''). The ''Arroyo de las Nueces'' was named for the evidence of the native species of walnut tree, the [[California Walnut]].\n\nWith the coming of American settlers following the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], a small settlement called \"The Corners\" emerged, named because it was the place where roads from [[Pacheco, California|Pacheco]] and Lafayette met. The site of this first American settlement is found today at the intersection of Mt. Diablo Boulevard and North Main Street. The first town settler was William Slusher, who built a dwelling on the bank of Walnut Creek, which was called \"Nuts Creek\" by the Americans in 1849. In the year 1855, Milo Hough of Lafayette built the hotel named \"Walnut Creek House\" in the corners. A [[blacksmith]] shop and a store soon joined the hotel, and a year later, Hiram Penniman (who built [[Shadelands Ranch]]) laid out the town site and realigned the Main Street of today. Two decades later, the community changed its name from The Corners to Walnut Creek.\n\nIn December 1862 a United States [[Post Office]] was established, and the community was named \"Walnut Creek\".<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|719}}</ref>  The downtown street patterns laid out in 1871\u20131872 by pioneer Homer Shuey on a portion of one of his family's large cattle ranches are still present today.\n\nWalnut Creek began to grow with the arrival of [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] Railroad service in 1891. On October 21, 1914, the town and the surrounding area of {{convert|500|acres|km2|abbr=off}}), were [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] as the 8th city in Contra Costa County. A branch line of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] railroad ran through Walnut Creek until the late 1970s. The [[East Bay Regional Park District]]'s [[Iron Horse Regional Trail|Iron Horse Trail]], used by walkers, runners and bikers, runs over what were portions of that branch line.<ref>{{cite web |title=About the Iron Horse Corridor |url=http://www.co.contra-costa.ca.us/2567/About-the-Iron-Horse-Corridor |publisher=Contra Costa County |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref> The mainline of the [[Sacramento Northern]] Railway passed through Walnut Creek. Both railroads had stations here. Today, the [[Antioch\u2013SFO/Millbrae line]] of the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] (BART) serves Walnut Creek with a [[Walnut Creek (BART station)|station]] adjacent to Highway 680.\n\nWith the 1951 opening of the downtown Broadway Shopping Center (now Broadway Plaza), Contra Costa County's first major retail center, the city took off in a new direction, and its population more than quadrupled{{snds}}from 2,460 in 1950 to 9,903 in 1960.\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nWalnut Creek is located at {{Coord|37|54|23|N|122|03|54|W|type:city}}.<ref>{{Cite GNIS|1660120|Walnut Creek}}</ref> Portions lie in both the [[San Ramon Valley]] and the Ygnacio Valley below the western slopes of [[Mount Diablo]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|51.2|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}},  0.06 percent of which is water. Walnut Creek{{snds}}the actual waterway that runs through town{{snds}}has been routed underneath downtown through a series of tunnels starting at the southwest end of Macy's and ending just southwest of Maria Maria Restaurant.\n\n=== Open space ===\n[[File:Shell Ridge Open Space - Walnut Creek, California.jpg|thumb|right|Shell Ridge Open Space]]\nWalnut Creek owns more open space per capita than any other community in the state of [[California]]. In 1974, Walnut Creek voters approved a $6.7{{nbsp}}million [[bond measure]] that allowed the city to purchase {{convert|1800|acre|ha}} of undeveloped hillsides, ridge lines, and park sites. Walnut Creek owns parts of Lime Ridge Open Space, Shell Ridge Open Space, Acalanes Ridge Open Space, and Sugarloaf Open Space.\n\nThe East Bay Regional Park District operates [[Diablo Foothills Regional Park]] and Castle Rock Regional Recreation Area, both in Walnut Creek.\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nWalnut Creek's warm summer [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csb'') is typical of California's interior valleys. In summer, high pressure is in control of the region, leading to almost unbroken sunshine and virtually no precipitation. Days start out cool but quickly warm up, with high temperatures normally in the 80s Fahrenheit (27 to 32{{nbsp}}\u00b0C). Temperatures of {{convert|100|F}} or hotter occur numerous times during heatwaves, however. In the winter, the jet stream moves far enough south so that Pacific storms can reach Walnut Creek, bringing much-needed rain{{snds}}average annual rainfall approximates {{convert|20|in|mm}}, with slight variations occurring in microclimates based on elevation and topography. During particularly cold storms, snow falls on the peak of nearby [[Mount Diablo]], but snow in the valley floor is very rare. There are also plenty of clear, mild days in winter, often with morning frost. The climate allows for the successful cultivation of many plants and crops, being warm enough for citrus yet cold enough for apples. The [[Ruth Bancroft Garden]] is a renowned [[botanical garden]] that showcases the diversity of plants that can be successfully grown.\n\n{{Weather box |width = 70%\n|location = Walnut Creek (1893\u20131974)\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  80\n|Feb record high F =  83\n|Mar record high F =  97\n|Apr record high F =  94\n|May record high F = 103\n|Jun record high F = 109\n|Jul record high F = 115\n|Aug record high F = 112\n|Sep record high F = 114\n|Oct record high F = 101\n|Nov record high F =  89\n|Dec record high F =  76\n|year record high F =115\n|Jan high F = 55\n|Feb high F = 61\n|Mar high F = 65\n|Apr high F = 71\n|May high F = 76\n|Jun high F = 83\n|Jul high F = 88\n|Aug high F = 87\n|Sep high F = 84\n|Oct high F = 77\n|Nov high F = 66\n|Dec high F = 56\n|year high F =\n|Jan low F = 36\n|Feb low F = 38\n|Mar low F = 40\n|Apr low F = 43\n|May low F = 47\n|Jun low F = 52\n|Jul low F = 54\n|Aug low F = 54\n|Sep low F = 52\n|Oct low F = 46\n|Nov low F = 41\n|Dec low F = 37\n|year low F = 45.0\n|Jan record low F = 17\n|Feb record low F = 21\n|Mar record low F = 24\n|Apr record low F = 28\n|May record low F = 32\n|Jun record low F = 34\n|Jul record low F = 38\n|Aug record low F = 41\n|Sep record low F = 36\n|Oct record low F = 27\n|Nov record low F = 23\n|Dec record low F = 18\n|year record low F =17\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 4.52\n|Feb precipitation inch = 3.62\n|Mar precipitation inch = 2.47\n|Apr precipitation inch = 1.38\n|May precipitation inch = 0.56\n|Jun precipitation inch = 0.14\n|Jul precipitation inch = 0.01\n|Aug precipitation inch = 0.04\n|Sep precipitation inch = 0.24\n|Oct precipitation inch = 1.05\n|Nov precipitation inch = 2.26\n|Dec precipitation inch = 3.83\n|Jan precipitation days = 10\n|Feb precipitation days = 9\n|Mar precipitation days = 8\n|Apr precipitation days = 5\n|May precipitation days = 3\n|Jun precipitation days = 1\n|Jul precipitation days = 0\n|Aug precipitation days = 0\n|Sep precipitation days = 1\n|Oct precipitation days = 3\n|Nov precipitation days = 6\n|Dec precipitation days = 9\n|year precipitation days = 53\n|unit precipitation days = 0.01 in\n|source 1 = <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliGCStT.pl?ca9423 |title=WALNUT CREEK 2 ESE, CALIFORNIA Period of Record General Climate Summary \u2013 Temperature |publisher=Wrcc.dri.edu |date=October 31, 2012 |accessdate=August 19, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliGCStP.pl?ca9423 |title=WALNUT CREEK 2 ESE, CALIFORNIA Period of Record General Climate Summary \u2013 Precipitation |publisher=Wrcc.dri.edu |date=October 31, 2012 |accessdate=August 19, 2013}}</ref>\n|date=April 2011\n}}\n\n== Public transit and bike trails ==\n\n[[File:Ygnacio Canal Trail - Walnut Creek, California.jpg|thumb|Ygnacio Valley Canal Trail to Lime Ridge Open Space]]\n\nThe city hosts two [[BART]] stations, [[Walnut Creek BART station|Walnut Creek station]] and [[Pleasant hill bart|Pleasant Hill station]] (in the unincorporated area known as Contra Costa Centre Transit Village).

With a total estimated population of 69,122, Walnut Creek serves as a hub for its neighboring cities because of its location at the junction of the highways from [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] ([[Interstate 680 (California)|I-680]]) and San Francisco/Oakland ([[California State Route 24|SR-24]]) and its accessibility by [[BART]]. Its active downtown neighborhood features hundred-year-old buildings and extensive high-end retail establishments, restaurants and entertainment venues.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Downtown Walnut Creek 02 BW.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Walnut Creek]]\nThere are three bands of [[Bay Miwok]] Indians associated with early Walnut Creek:<ref name=\"Forester\">Forester, 2006.</ref><ref name=\"Milliken\">Milliken, 1995</ref> the Saclan, whose territory extended through the hills east of present-day [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Rossmoor, Walnut Creek, California|Rossmoor]], [[Lafayette, California|Lafayette]], [[Moraga, California|Moraga]] and Walnut Creek; the Volvon (also spelled Bolbon, Wolwon and Zuicun) near [[Mt. Diablo]]; and the Tactan located on the San Ramon Creek in [[Danville, California|Danville]] and Walnut Creek.\n\nToday's Walnut Creek is located within the earlier site of four Mexican land grants. One of these land grants{{snds}}measuring {{convert|18000|acre|km2}}{{snds}}belonged to Juana Sanchez de Pacheco, who eventually passed the land down to her two grandsons. Ygnacio Sibrian, one of the grandsons, created the first roofed home in the valley in about 1850. The grant was called [[Rancho Arroyo de Las Nueces y Bolbones]], named after the principal waterway, ''Arroyo de las Nueces'' (Walnut Creek), as well as for the local group of indigenous Americans (''Bolbones''). The ''Arroyo de las Nueces'' was named for the evidence of the native species of walnut tree, the [[California Walnut]].\n\nWith the coming of American settlers following the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], a small settlement called \"The Corners\" emerged, named because it was the place where roads from [[Pacheco, California|Pacheco]] and Lafayette met. The site of this first American settlement is found today at the intersection of Mt. Diablo Boulevard and North Main Street. The first town settler was William Slusher, who built a dwelling on the bank of Walnut Creek, which was called \"Nuts Creek\" by the Americans in 1849. In the year 1855, Milo Hough of Lafayette built the hotel named \"Walnut Creek House\" in the corners. A [[blacksmith]] shop and a store soon joined the hotel, and a year later, Hiram Penniman (who built [[Shadelands Ranch]]) laid out the town site and realigned the Main Street of today. Two decades later, the community changed its name from The Corners to Walnut Creek.\n\nIn December 1862 a United States [[Post Office]] was established, and the community was named \"Walnut Creek\".<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|719}}</ref>  The downtown street patterns laid out in 1871\u20131872 by pioneer Homer Shuey on a portion of one of his family's large cattle ranches are still present today.\n\nWalnut Creek began to grow with the arrival of [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] Railroad service in 1891. On October 21, 1914, the town and the surrounding area of {{convert|500|acres|km2|abbr=off}}), were [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] as the 8th city in Contra Costa County. A branch line of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] railroad ran through Walnut Creek until the late 1970s. The [[East Bay Regional Park District]]'s [[Iron Horse Regional Trail|Iron Horse Trail]], used by walkers, runners and bikers, runs over what were portions of that branch line.<ref>{{cite web |title=About the Iron Horse Corridor |url=http://www.co.contra-costa.ca.us/2567/About-the-Iron-Horse-Corridor |publisher=Contra Costa County |accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref> The mainline of the [[Sacramento Northern]] Railway passed through Walnut Creek. Both railroads had stations here. Today, the [[Antioch\u2013SFO/Millbrae line]] of the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] (BART) serves Walnut Creek with a [[Walnut Creek (BART station)|station]] adjacent to Highway 680.\n\nWith the 1951 opening of the downtown Broadway Shopping Center (now Broadway Plaza), Contra Costa County's first major retail center, the city took off in a new direction, and its population more than quadrupled{{snds}}from 2,460 in 1950 to 9,903 in 1960.\n\n== Geography and climate ==\n\nWalnut Creek is located at {{Coord|37|54|23|N|122|03|54|W|type:city}}.<ref>{{Cite GNIS|1660120|Walnut Creek}}</ref> Portions lie in both the [[San Ramon Valley]] and the Ygnacio Valley below the western slopes of [[Mount Diablo]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|51.2|km2|abbr=on|order=flip}},  0.06 percent of which is water. Walnut Creek{{snds}}the actual waterway that runs through town{{snds}}has been routed underneath downtown through a series of tunnels starting at the southwest end of Macy's and ending just southwest of Maria Maria Restaurant.\n\n=== Open space ===\n[[File:Shell Ridge Open Space - Walnut Creek, California.jpg|thumb|right|Shell Ridge Open Space]]\nWalnut Creek owns more open space per capita than any other community in the state of [[California]]. In 1974, Walnut Creek voters approved a $6.7{{nbsp}}million [[bond measure]] that allowed the city to purchase {{convert|1800|acre|ha}} of undeveloped hillsides, ridge lines, and park sites. Walnut Creek owns parts of Lime Ridge Open Space, Shell Ridge Open Space, Acalanes Ridge Open Space, and Sugarloaf Open Space.\n\nThe East Bay Regional Park District operates [[Diablo Foothills Regional Park]] and Castle Rock Regional Recreation Area, both in Walnut Creek.\n\n=== Climate ===\n\nWalnut Creek's warm summer [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Csb'') is typical of California's interior valleys. In summer, high pressure is in control of the region, leading to almost unbroken sunshine and virtually no precipitation. Days start out cool but quickly warm up, with high temperatures normally in the 80s Fahrenheit (27 to 32{{nbsp}}\u00b0C). Temperatures of {{convert|100|F}} or hotter occur numerous times during heatwaves, however. In the winter, the jet stream moves far enough south so that Pacific storms can reach Walnut Creek, bringing much-needed rain{{snds}}average annual rainfall approximates {{convert|20|in|mm}}, with slight variations occurring in microclimates based on elevation and topography. During particularly cold storms, snow falls on the peak of nearby [[Mount Diablo]], but snow in the valley floor is very rare. There are also plenty of clear, mild days in winter, often with morning frost. The climate allows for the successful cultivation of many plants and crops, being warm enough for citrus yet cold enough for apples.

For safety and mechanical reasons, conservators securely fix long case clocks and wall clocks to a wall to avoid accidents and to ensure the clocks area to run properly. The use of a solid, sturdy surface when storing or displaying a clock can prevent it from falling on a hard surface. A wall clock for example requires a secure attachment \"[...] to a wall if accidents are to be avoided and clocks are to run properly.\u201d <ref name=ICON>{{cite web|title=Care and Conservation of Clocks|url=https://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_clocks.pdf|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=Conservation Register|publisher=The Institute of Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> \nClock cases, which come in many different materials, require special consideration and treatment in their own right. Conservators further advise not exposing a clock to a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire, as this can cause damage to the clock cases and movements.<ref name=ICON/> [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:00, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nMotion sensitive lighting and use of non-direct light sources can limit the amount of light and heat withstood by a clock, both of which are sources of clock damage. A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An [[HVAC]] system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.\n\n==== Correct Humidity and temperature levels ====\nThe [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock's condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.\n:a. '''Wood clocks'''\n:The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% [[relative humidity]] is suitable.<ref name=Fahey /> During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime.<ref name=Fahey />\n:b. '''Metal clocks'''\n:Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Running Clocks vs. Static Display ====\n\nClocks can be simple display objects if they are not required to run. This reduces the physical force on the clock. Whereas \u201crunning any functional object will result in wear and handling, which contributes to the degradation of the parts\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/> Running clocks also require winding, which adds to the wear-and-tear of the gears and leads to more handling of the object. <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\n=== Regular Clock Maintenance ===\n[[File:Prim clockwork.jpg|thumb|The mechanics inside a timepiece]] [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 22:46, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\nRegular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation. Conservation experts advise clocks need to be serviced regularly. A clock is a complex mechanical contraption made of a variety of materials and with many small moving parts <ref>Historical Clocks, 2012. Retrieved from: http://publish.illinois.edu/cuhistoricalclocks/preservation/</ref>. Even in perfect conditions lubricants deteriorate, particularly after three years. Clocks should be examined and re-lubricated every three years.  After five years, and certainly no longer than eight years, the whole movement is advised to be dismantled and \u2018cleaned\u2019 if excessive wear and expensive attention is to be avoided <ref name=ICON/> [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:06, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nVisual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. \n:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''\n:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock\u2019s history, as \u201c[...] various \u201cdirt\u201d or \u201csalt\u201d deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= https://cool.culturalheritage.org/byauth/moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as \u201cthe abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of \u201csandpaper [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined \u201c[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> \n:b. '''Winding and setting'''\n:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.\n\n== Agents of Deterioration ==\n\nDamage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused. Agents of Deterioration  (AOD) are the ten primary categories of threats to heritage objects. These agents of deterioration can occur while an object is in storage, on display, undergoing conservation, or during transportation of the object. <ref name=Canadian>{{cite web |last1=Canadian Conservation Institute |title=Agents of Deterioration |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration.html |website=Government of Canada}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical Force ===\n\nPhysical force is any impact, shock, vibration, pressure or abrasion that causes damage to an object. One of the most common causes of physical force damage occurs when handling the object. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\nClocks are complex functional objects; many have moveable working parts. Most commonly, these delicate inner-workings are metal, but clocks can be made of any number of materials, from wood to precious metals like silver and gold. They can have enamel inlays or delicate carvings and be a variety of sizes from small watches to large grandfather clocks or clock towers. Each clock is susceptible to physical damage. \n\nAny excessive physical force will break, damage, splinter the clock frame or easily shatter the glass of the object. Any excessive physical force will also injure the mechanics inside the clock which are critical to its operation. When a clock is in the custody of a professional institution such as a museum, proper barriers and monitored security are of the wood clocks greatly reduce this risk.Some common sources of physical force damage to clocks are:\n\n:a. '''Mishandling'''\n:The failure of a handler to remove loose items from their person can result in these items striking a clock\u2019s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving \u201cunsightly and potentially damaging marks.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a clock \u201c[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.\n:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''\n:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as \u201c[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily\u201d,<ref name=ICON /> as well as by turning the key one too many times. \n:In terms of improper hand setting, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand in an attempt to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.<ref name=ICON /> Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, \u201cRather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.\u201d <ref name=ICON />\n:c. '''Unstable storage or display''' \n:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock\u2019s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.\n\n=== Theft and Vandalism ===\n\nSome clocks are constructed out of precious materials that are a source of temptation for theft. They can be small enough to easily steal. If they are on display in a historic home that does not have conventional display cases for example, large clocks could be vandalize by visitors. \nWhile a minimal concern for most wood clocks, as they are rarely stolen in a burglary, a valuable historic clock may be more susceptible to theft.  With regard to vandalism, any public place runs a risk for any object being vandalized. In the case of wood clocks, slashing the wood, smashing the glass, or graffiti would be the most common problems for a public institution.   Obviously, high security, cameras, inspections after crowds leave, especially for highly coveted antique wood clocks would be required in any professional institution.\n\n=== Disassociation  ===\n\nThe disassociation agent of deterioration refers to the separation or loss of individual parts of an object. This is possible in clocks, especially during cleaning or maintenance when the clock has to be disassembled. \u201cClocks can consist of up to five hundred individual components\u201d <ref>{{cite web |last1=The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material (AICCM) |title=Machinery, clocks and scientific equipment. |url=https://aiccm.org.au/things-we-conserve/machinery-clocks-scientific}}</ref>, so preventive conservation can be complex for these objects. Any one of those components can be lost or misplaced, resulting in damage to the object as a whole. If the part is critical, the clock may no longer run.\n\n=== Incorrect Relative Humidity ===\n\nThe variety of materials used in clocks, can be sensitive to fluctuations in humidity. \u201cA stable and appropriate relative humidity and temperature should be maintained to prevent parts from rusting, corrosion, darkening of silvers, and lubricants from drying out\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\">{{cite web |title=Preventative Conservation Workshop 2017 Part III: Clocks of Staatsburgh |url=http://staatsburghstatehistoricsite.blogspot.com/2017/10/preventative-conservation-workshop-2017.html |website=Staatsburgh State Historic Site}}</ref>. Humidity that is too damp can deform organic materials or corrode metals found in clocks (National Park Service, 2012). Dehydration from humidity levels that are too low are also a problem with clock materials. Fluctuating humidity leads to swelling and shrinking that can \u201cloosen the joints of organic components\u201d.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{cite web |title=The Museum Handbook Part I: Museum Collections |url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/MHI.pdf |website=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\nThe moisture in the air will impact the physical structure of the wood being a vascular material.  High humidity can cause warping, rotting, mold and fungus to the wood clock and can corrode the metal pieces of the clock. Wood clock must be kept in climate-controlled rooms for optimal preservation. A humidity ranges between 35%-60% is optimal for wood clock. \n\nIncorrect relative humidity can cause the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed, resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally.<ref name=Canadian/>\n\n=== Incorrect Temperature ===\n\nThe amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. \u201c[...] extremes in temperature and humidity\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near \"a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements.\" <ref name=ICON />\n\nClocks, regardless of the materials they are made of, are susceptible to damage from incorrect temperatures. Like light, temperature that is too high can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials <ref name=\"NPS\"/>. In some instances, the heat from the fire contribute to faster deterioration in mantel clocks <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>.\n\nWith wood clocks, temperature is critical to conservation and preservation. Extreme heat and freezing temperature will significantly damage the wood\u2019s surface.  Incorrect temperatures or uncontrolled climates wood clocks may be stored in, can rapidly deteriorate the condition of the wood. Moderate temperatures in the range of 68 to 75 (f) degrees is recommended. \n\nIncorrect temperature causes the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\n=== Pests ===\n\nDepending on the materials the clock is made of, pests may be attracted to it. This is especially true for wooden clocks, since many pests feed on organic materials like wood. Even for clocks that are made entirely of metal, spiders can cause problems because \u201ctheir webs attract dust and can clog a clock\u2019s movement\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nMany pests, rodents and insects burrow or feast on wood; wood clocks are very susceptible to infestations. Inspecting the wood clocks for droppings or signs of animal activity is highly advised.  Consistent pest control is critical to mitigate this issue.  \n\nShould a clock feature a wooden case, pests could be an issue. Woodboring insects may infest a clock if it is left in a vulnerable environment which supports the insects and allows them access <ref name=Canadian/>. Given that a wooden case can be the external structure of a clock, this is something monitor for aesthetic and functional reasons.\n\nPests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:\n:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''<!--intentional link to DAB page-->- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such \u201c[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n=== Light: Infrared and Ultraviolet ===\n\nOver-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.<ref name=Fahey /> Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration \u201c[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or \u201calligatored\u201d appearance.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\nMany of the materials used in clocks are prone to light damage, both ultraviolet and infrared. Visible light damage can cause discoloration and deterioration. Exposure to infrared can increase the temperature of the wood, this can cause increased oxidation, which causing damage to the wood\u2019s surface and develop irregular markings. \n\nUltraviolet light can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials like wood.<ref name=\"NPS\"/> Exposure to direct sunlight (UV) over long periods of time will damage the wood by warping, fading, dry-rotting, and cause damage to the wood structure.Exposure to both can ruin, alter, damage or color any stains or finishing on the wood clock as well.\n\n=== Pollutants ===\n[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]\nContaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:  \n:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock\u2019s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. \n:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.\n\nDust and other airborne abrasives can build up inside clocks and impeded and wear down their mechanisms. In the case of mantel clocks that have been displayed above fireplaces, these abrasives include soot. Other pollutants can cause oxidization and tarnishing in metal clocks. The cleaning agents used to remove pollutants can result in a chemical reaction with previously used lubricants or cleaning agents or with the materials of the clock. Excessive cleaning can \u201ccause more issues like over-drying of bearings and stress corrosion cracking of brass that is exposed to ammonia solution\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nAny elements which can corrode, degrade, or alter the condition of an object would adversely affect wood clocks. Chemicals, smoke, heat, gases, extreme sunlight are big concerns. The wood used in many wood clocks are very porous, and easily absorb the elements around their environment and affect the integrity of the wood. Well-sealed/insulated rooms mitigate pollutant damages.\n\nThe mechanisms within clocks are highly sensitive to external matter like oils from fingertips or dust, so much so, that it can cause the machine to malfunction if it gets into the wrong area <ref name=\"Moss\"/>. For static displays, the functionality of a clock is not always necessary, but limiting the introduction of organic matter through mishandling will prevent unnecessary decay over the life of the clock.\n\n=== Fire  ===\n\nClocks are highly vulnerable to fire, being a wood object, they will turn into cinders quickly if exposed to fire and possible errant embers if near a fireplace.  It is not advised to place a wood clock too close to any fireplace or wood burning stove, heater, or pilot light.\nMany clocks are small enough that evacuating them during an emergency could be possible. Large clocks that belong to buildings, like clock towers, may survive fire and could possibly be restored. \n\n=== Water  ===\n\nThe metal and wood components of many clocks are extremely susceptible to water damage. Because of the complexity of these objects, they are very challenging to dry if such damage occurs. Water damage is one of the greatest agents of deterioration for a wood clock; water warps, swells and rots the wood. It is extremely difficult if at all possible, depending upon the severity of the water damage to repair or restore the wood on the clock to its correct condition. Often times with salvaging warped or rotted wood, it has to be replaced entirely, if the original wood materials are available. Water damage also causes corrosion to the internal mechanisms of the clock.  Address any sign of water damage anything, or anywhere near a wood clock to mitigate this issue.\n\n== Specific Types of Clock Damage ==\nDamage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.\n\n==== Wood damage ====\nDue to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.<ref name=Fahey /> Such changes in character from the wood's original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include \u201c[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\" <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Metal damage ====\nSimilar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This \u201c[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Finish or paint damage ====\nFinish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock's surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products \u201ccan actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.\n\n==== Interior or clockwork damage ====\nClockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.\n\n==== Improper cleaning and polishing ====\nMany cleaners and polishers contain properties that \u201c[...] have been proven to age poorly.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Resultantly, the use of such cleaners and polishers can prove detrimental. The use of ammonia based cleaning products for example on brass clock components can lead to an irreversible form of damage called [[Stress Corrosion Cracking]].<ref name=Moss /> Depending on the type of metal on which it is used, a metallic brush employed to apply cleaning products not only can create the proper conditions for corrosion, but can \u201c[...] remove any protective oxide layers even with careful use.\u201d <ref name=Moss />\n\n==== Improper lubrication ====\nAttempts by non-professionals to lubricate or repair clockwork can lead to serious damage and loss of clock functionality. A lubricant applied without first cleaning and polishing clockwork to remove the previous lubricant and contaminants can result in wear rather than prevent it.<ref name=Moss /> The combination of the newly applied lubricant with the previous lubricant often results in \u201c[...] an unwanted chemical reaction between the two lubricants [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> A careless lubricant choice can result in the use of inappropriate or \"Poor-quality oil\" on clockwork, which \"can become sticky leading to mechanical problems.\" <ref name=Fahey /> The inexperience of a non-professional can also lead to \u201cthe use of too much oil, or oil in the wrong place\u201d <ref name=ICON /> during attempts to lubricate clockwork. The application of too much of a lubricant can be damaging because it \u201c[...] usually causes the lubrication to run out of the bearing and by capillary action will cause the bearing to go dry.\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Totally ignoring the lubrication needs of clockwork can be jeopardizing not only because of lubricant degradation, but because of the acidic nature of the organic lubricants often used in antique clocks.<ref name=Moss />\n\n== Conservation and restoration ==\nInterventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.\n\n=== Conservators ===\n\nA [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to \u201c[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as \u201cSometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].\u201d <ref name=NAWCC>{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.\n\n=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===\n[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]]. In starting the project, examination of the clock revealed that \"The automata and clock elements seem to be running, but struggling, and the music sounds as though it needs a few extra hands to help play its tune.\" <ref>{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=Anglesey Abbey\u2019s Pagoda Clock|url=https://westdeanconservation.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/anglesey-abbeys-pagoda-clock/|date=5 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> The clock was then disassembled, and care was taken to document information about each of the over 600 components both textually and photographically, including measurements and where each component fits within the clock. \"After examination, each component was cleaned and dried, wrapped in acid-free tissue, and stored with the catalogue number.\" <ref>{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=The Pagoda Part 2|url=https://westdeanconservation.wordpress.com/2012/06/28/the-pagoda-part-2/|date=28 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cultural Conservation-Restoration |state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Clocks]]\n[[Category:Conservation and restoration]]\n[[Hr:Konzervacija satova]]\n", "text_old": "The '''conservation and restoration of clocks''' refers to the care given to a clock to either prevent or resolve issues faced during its life cycle. The variety of materials from which a clock may be constructed and the complexity of [[clockwork]] warrant such care to be taken by a clock owner so that a clock can continue to function.\n\n== Preventive conservation ==\nProper handling, suitable storage and display environments, and regular maintenance can together prevent issues from arising and impacting a clock's sustainability. Such controls can extend the life of a clock.\n\n=== Horological Conservation History ===\n[[File:L Ancient-egyptian-sundial.jpg|thumb|World's oldest Sundial, from Egypt's Valley of the Kings (c. 1500 BC). University of Basel - Valley of the Kings, Egypt]][[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 22:35, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\nThe history of clock conservation dates back to ancient times.  Horology, the study of the measurement of time, dates to 1450 BC, \"when the Ancient Egyptians first observed the earth's natural circadian rhythms (Meadows, C., (n.d.)<ref>Meadows, C., (n.d.). Horology: A Brief History. Retrieved from: https://www.artsandcollections.com/article/horology-a-brief-history</ref>.\u201d Some examples of instruments used to measure time include: clocks, watches, sundials, hourglasses, time recorders, and atomic clocks.  Horological Conservation is the science and art of preserving timepieces to connect humanity with the history and heritage of timepieces. [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 14:51, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\n=== Correct Handling ===\nCertain precautionary measures taken by a clock handler can deny opportunities for damage to occur:\n[[File:Pendulum_removed_from_clockwork.jpg|thumb|right|150x300px|Pendulum removed from clockwork.]]\n* Loose items worn by a handler have the potential to come into contact with and cause damage to a clock. Removal of these items prior to clock handling can lower the risk of damage. \n* Wearing \u201c[...] cotton or rubber gloves when handling the metal portions of the clock\u201d <ref name=Fahey>{{cite web|last1=Fahey|first1=Mary M.|title=The Care and Preservation of Clocks|url=http://www.thehenryford.org/research/caring/clocks.aspx|website=Benson Ford Research Center|publisher=The Henry Ford|accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref> can limit opportunities for transfer of contaminants from hands to clock surfaces. \n* [[Pendulum]] damage during clock movement can be prevented by either removing the pendulum or fixing it within the interior of the clock via a latch or padding prior to clock movement.<ref name=Fahey /> This can also prevent damage to other interior components.\n* A clock \"[...] should always be grasped at its most sturdy area\" <ref name=Fahey /> and moved from one location to the next on its back. \n* The correlation of the size of a clock with the number of people moving it can ensure the safety of the clock. A small, mantle clock for example may only require one mover, while a tall clock can necessitate a number of movers to safely carry it to another location.\n\n=== Proper Storage and display ===\n[[File:Tall Clock MET 192934.jpg|thumb|19th c. Tiffany Longcase Clock photo donated by the Met 192934]] [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 22:43, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nProper storage and display mechanisms can work to ensure a clock's safety. For safety and mechanical reasons, conservators securely fix long case clocks and wall clocks to a wall to avoid accidents and to ensure the clocks area to run properly. The use of a solid, sturdy surface when storing or displaying a clock can prevent it from falling on a hard surface. A wall clock for example requires a secure attachment \"[...] to a wall if accidents are to be avoided and clocks are to run properly.\u201d <ref name=ICON>{{cite web|title=Care and Conservation of Clocks|url=https://icon.org.uk/system/files/documents/care_and_conservation_of_clocks.pdf|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=Conservation Register|publisher=The Institute of Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> \nClock cases, which come in many different materials, require special consideration and treatment in their own right. Conservators further advise not exposing a clock to a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire, as this can cause damage to the clock cases and movements.<ref name=ICON/> [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:00, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nMotion sensitive lighting and use of non-direct light sources can limit the amount of light and heat withstood by a clock, both of which are sources of clock damage. A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An [[HVAC]] system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.\n\n==== Correct Humidity and temperature levels ====\nThe [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock's condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.\n:a. '''Wood clocks'''\n:The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% [[relative humidity]] is suitable.<ref name=Fahey /> During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime.<ref name=Fahey />\n:b. '''Metal clocks'''\n:Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Running Clocks vs. Static Display ====\n\nClocks can be simple display objects if they are not required to run. This reduces the physical force on the clock. Whereas \u201crunning any functional object will result in wear and handling, which contributes to the degradation of the parts\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/> Running clocks also require winding, which adds to the wear-and-tear of the gears and leads to more handling of the object. <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\n=== Regular Clock Maintenance ===\n[[File:Prim clockwork.jpg|thumb|The mechanics inside a timepiece]] [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 22:46, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\nRegular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation. Conservation experts advise clocks need to be serviced regularly. A clock is a complex mechanical contraption made of a variety of materials and with many small moving parts <ref>Historical Clocks, 2012. Retrieved from: http://publish.illinois.edu/cuhistoricalclocks/preservation/</ref>. Even in perfect conditions lubricants deteriorate, particularly after three years. Clocks should be examined and re-lubricated every three years.  After five years, and certainly no longer than eight years, the whole movement is advised to be dismantled and \u2018cleaned\u2019 if excessive wear and expensive attention is to be avoided <ref name=ICON/> [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:06, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\nVisual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. \n:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''\n:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock\u2019s history, as \u201c[...] various \u201cdirt\u201d or \u201csalt\u201d deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= https://cool.culturalheritage.org/byauth/moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as \u201cthe abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of \u201csandpaper [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined \u201c[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> \n:b. '''Winding and setting'''\n:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.\n\n== Agents of Deterioration ==\n\nDamage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused. Agents of Deterioration  (AOD) are ten primary categories of threats to heritage objects. These agents of deterioration can occur while an object is in storage, on display, undergoing conservation, or during transportation of the object. <ref name=Canadian>{{cite web |last1=Canadian Conservation Institute |title=Agents of Deterioration |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/conservation-institute/services/agents-deterioration.html |website=Government of Canada}}</ref>\n\n=== Physical Force ===\n\nPhysical force is any impact, shock, vibration, pressure or abrasion that causes damage to an object. One of the most common causes of physical force damage occurs when handling the object. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\nClocks are complex functional objects; many have moveable working parts. Most commonly, these delicate inner-workings are metal, but clocks can be made of any number of materials, from wood to precious metals like silver and gold. They can have enamel inlays or delicate carvings and be a variety of sizes from small watches to large grandfather clocks or clock towers. Each clock is susceptible to physical damage. \n\nAny excessive physical force will break, damage, splinter the clock frame or easily shatter the glass of the object. Any excessive physical force will also injure the mechanics inside the clock which are critical to its operation. When a clock is in the custody of a professional institution such as a museum, proper barriers and monitored security are of the wood clocks greatly reduce this risk.Some common sources of physical force damage to clocks are:\n\n:a. '''Mishandling'''\n:The failure of a handler to remove loose items from their person can result in these items striking a clock\u2019s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving \u201cunsightly and potentially damaging marks.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a clock \u201c[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.\n:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''\n:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as \u201c[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily\u201d,<ref name=ICON /> as well as by turning the key one too many times. \n:In terms of improper hand setting, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand in an attempt to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.<ref name=ICON /> Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, \u201cRather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.\u201d <ref name=ICON />\n:c. '''Unstable storage or display''' \n:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock\u2019s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.\n\n=== Theft and Vandalism ===\n\nSome clocks are constructed out of precious materials that are a source of temptation for theft. They can be small enough to easily steal. If they are on display in a historic home that does not have conventional display cases for example, large clocks could be vandalize by visitors. \nWhile a minimal concern for most wood clocks, as they are rarely stolen in a burglary, a valuable historic clock may be more susceptible to theft.  With regard to vandalism, any public place runs a risk for any object being vandalized. In the case of wood clocks, slashing the wood, smashing the glass, or graffiti would be the most common problems for a public institution.   Obviously, high security, cameras, inspections after crowds leave, especially for highly coveted antique wood clocks would be required in any professional institution.\n\n=== Disassociation  ===\n\nThe disassociation agent of deterioration refers to the separation or loss of individual parts of an object. This is possible in clocks, especially during cleaning or maintenance when the clock has to be disassembled. \u201cClocks can consist of up to five hundred individual components\u201d <ref>{{cite web |last1=The Australian Institute for the Conservation of Cultural Material (AICCM) |title=Machinery, clocks and scientific equipment. |url=https://aiccm.org.au/things-we-conserve/machinery-clocks-scientific}}</ref>, so preventive conservation can be complex for these objects. Any one of those components can be lost or misplaced, resulting in damage to the object as a whole. If the part is critical, the clock may no longer run.\n\n=== Incorrect Relative Humidity ===\n\nThe variety of materials used in clocks, can be sensitive to fluctuations in humidity. \u201cA stable and appropriate relative humidity and temperature should be maintained to prevent parts from rusting, corrosion, darkening of silvers, and lubricants from drying out\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\">{{cite web |title=Preventative Conservation Workshop 2017 Part III: Clocks of Staatsburgh |url=http://staatsburghstatehistoricsite.blogspot.com/2017/10/preventative-conservation-workshop-2017.html |website=Staatsburgh State Historic Site}}</ref>. Humidity that is too damp can deform organic materials or corrode metals found in clocks (National Park Service, 2012). Dehydration from humidity levels that are too low are also a problem with clock materials. Fluctuating humidity leads to swelling and shrinking that can \u201cloosen the joints of organic components\u201d.<ref name=\"NPS\">{{cite web |title=The Museum Handbook Part I: Museum Collections |url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/MHI/MHI.pdf |website=National Park Service}}</ref>\n\nThe moisture in the air will impact the physical structure of the wood being a vascular material.  High humidity can cause warping, rotting, mold and fungus to the wood clock and can corrode the metal pieces of the clock. Wood clock must be kept in climate-controlled rooms for optimal preservation. A humidity ranges between 35%-60% is optimal for wood clock. \n\nIncorrect relative humidity can cause the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed, resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally.<ref name=Canadian/>\n\n=== Incorrect Temperature ===\n\nThe amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. \u201c[...] extremes in temperature and humidity\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near \"a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements.\" <ref name=ICON />\n\nClocks, regardless of the materials they are made of, are susceptible to damage from incorrect temperatures. Like light, temperature that is too high can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials <ref name=\"NPS\"/>. In some instances, the heat from the fire contribute to faster deterioration in mantel clocks <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>.\n\nWith wood clocks, temperature is critical to conservation and preservation. Extreme heat and freezing temperature will significantly damage the wood\u2019s surface.  Incorrect temperatures or uncontrolled climates wood clocks may be stored in, can rapidly deteriorate the condition of the wood. Moderate temperatures in the range of 68 to 75 (f) degrees is recommended. \n\nIncorrect temperature causes the wood to expand or contract. At the same time, the inorganic components remain fixed resulting in strain within the object <ref name=\"NPS\"/>, particularly if the wood becomes warped and remains in a manner that creates a pressure point. Glass facings can also trap moisture within the machine creating a prime environment for mold or rust, another agent of deterioration known as pollutants, to grow and build up internally. <ref name=Canadian/>\n\n=== Pests ===\n\nDepending on the materials the clock is made of, pests may be attracted to it. This is especially true for wooden clocks, since many pests feed on organic materials like wood. Even for clocks that are made entirely of metal, spiders can cause problems because \u201ctheir webs attract dust and can clog a clock\u2019s movement\u201d.<ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nMany pests, rodents and insects burrow or feast on wood; wood clocks are very susceptible to infestations. Inspecting the wood clocks for droppings or signs of animal activity is highly advised.  Consistent pest control is critical to mitigate this issue.  \n\nShould a clock feature a wooden case, pests could be an issue. Woodboring insects may infest a clock if it is left in a vulnerable environment which supports the insects and allows them access <ref name=Canadian/>. Given that a wooden case can be the external structure of a clock, this is something monitor for aesthetic and functional reasons.\n\nPests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:\n:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''<!--intentional link to DAB page-->- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such \u201c[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n=== Light: Infrared and Ultraviolet ===\n\nOver-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.<ref name=Fahey /> Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration \u201c[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or \u201calligatored\u201d appearance.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\nMany of the materials used in clocks are prone to light damage, both ultraviolet and infrared. Visible light damage can cause discoloration and deterioration. Exposure to infrared can increase the temperature of the wood, this can cause increased oxidation, which causing damage to the wood\u2019s surface and develop irregular markings. \n\nUltraviolet light can cause weakening, discoloration, and or disintegration of organic materials like wood.<ref name=\"NPS\"/> Exposure to direct sunlight (UV) over long periods of time will damage the wood by warping, fading, dry-rotting, and cause damage to the wood structure.Exposure to both can ruin, alter, damage or color any stains or finishing on the wood clock as well.\n\n=== Pollutants ===\n[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]\nContaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:  \n:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock\u2019s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. \n:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.\n\nDust and other airborne abrasives can build up inside clocks and impeded and wear down their mechanisms. In the case of mantel clocks that have been displayed above fireplaces, these abrasives include soot. Other pollutants can cause oxidization and tarnishing in metal clocks. The cleaning agents used to remove pollutants can result in a chemical reaction with previously used lubricants or cleaning agents or with the materials of the clock. Excessive cleaning can \u201ccause more issues like over-drying of bearings and stress corrosion cracking of brass that is exposed to ammonia solution\u201d <ref name=\"Staatsburgh\"/>\n\nAny elements which can corrode, degrade, or alter the condition of an object would adversely affect wood clocks. Chemicals, smoke, heat, gases, extreme sunlight are big concerns. The wood used in many wood clocks are very porous, and easily absorb the elements around their environment and affect the integrity of the wood. Well-sealed/insulated rooms mitigate pollutant damages.\n\nThe mechanisms within clocks are highly sensitive to external matter like oils from fingertips or dust, so much so, that it can cause the machine to malfunction if it gets into the wrong area <ref name=\"Moss\"/>. For static displays, the functionality of a clock is not always necessary, but limiting the introduction of organic matter through mishandling will prevent unnecessary decay over the life of the clock.\n\n=== Fire  ===\n\nClocks are highly vulnerable to fire, being a wood object, they will turn into cinders quickly if exposed to fire and possible errant embers if near a fireplace.  It is not advised to place a wood clock too close to any fireplace or wood burning stove, heater, or pilot light.\nMany clocks are small enough that evacuating them during an emergency could be possible. Large clocks that belong to buildings, like clock towers, may survive fire and could possibly be restored. \n\n=== Water  ===\n\nThe metal and wood components of many clocks are extremely susceptible to water damage. Because of the complexity of these objects, they are very challenging to dry if such damage occurs. Water damage is one of the greatest agents of deterioration for a wood clock; water warps, swells and rots the wood. It is extremely difficult if at all possible, depending upon the severity of the water damage to repair or restore the wood on the clock to its correct condition. Often times with salvaging warped or rotted wood, it has to be replaced entirely, if the original wood materials are available. Water damage also causes corrosion to the internal mechanisms of the clock.  Address any sign of water damage anything, or anywhere near a wood clock to mitigate this issue.\n\n== Specific Types of Clock Damage ==\nDamage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.\n\n==== Wood damage ====\nDue to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.<ref name=Fahey /> Such changes in character from the wood's original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include \u201c[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\" <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Metal damage ====\nSimilar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This \u201c[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Finish or paint damage ====\nFinish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock's surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products \u201ccan actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.\n\n==== Interior or clockwork damage ====\nClockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.\n\n==== Improper cleaning and polishing ====\nMany cleaners and polishers contain properties that \u201c[...] have been proven to age poorly.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Resultantly, the use of such cleaners and polishers can prove detrimental. The use of ammonia based cleaning products for example on brass clock components can lead to an irreversible form of damage called [[Stress Corrosion Cracking]].<ref name=Moss /> Depending on the type of metal on which it is used, a metallic brush employed to apply cleaning products not only can create the proper conditions for corrosion, but can \u201c[...] remove any protective oxide layers even with careful use.\u201d <ref name=Moss />\n\n==== Improper lubrication ====\nAttempts by non-professionals to lubricate or repair clockwork can lead to serious damage and loss of clock functionality. A lubricant applied without first cleaning and polishing clockwork to remove the previous lubricant and contaminants can result in wear rather than prevent it.<ref name=Moss /> The combination of the newly applied lubricant with the previous lubricant often results in \u201c[...] an unwanted chemical reaction between the two lubricants [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> A careless lubricant choice can result in the use of inappropriate or \"Poor-quality oil\" on clockwork, which \"can become sticky leading to mechanical problems.\" <ref name=Fahey /> The inexperience of a non-professional can also lead to \u201cthe use of too much oil, or oil in the wrong place\u201d <ref name=ICON /> during attempts to lubricate clockwork. The application of too much of a lubricant can be damaging because it \u201c[...] usually causes the lubrication to run out of the bearing and by capillary action will cause the bearing to go dry.\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Totally ignoring the lubrication needs of clockwork can be jeopardizing not only because of lubricant degradation, but because of the acidic nature of the organic lubricants often used in antique clocks.<ref name=Moss />\n\n== Conservation and restoration ==\nInterventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.\n\n=== Conservators ===\n\nA [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to \u201c[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as \u201cSometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].\u201d <ref name=NAWCC>{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.\n\n=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===\n[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]]. In starting the project, examination of the clock revealed that \"The automata and clock elements seem to be running, but struggling, and the music sounds as though it needs a few extra hands to help play its tune.\" <ref>{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=Anglesey Abbey\u2019s Pagoda Clock|url=https://westdeanconservation.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/anglesey-abbeys-pagoda-clock/|date=5 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> The clock was then disassembled, and care was taken to document information about each of the over 600 components both textually and photographically, including measurements and where each component fits within the clock. \"After examination, each component was cleaned and dried, wrapped in acid-free tissue, and stored with the catalogue number.\" <ref>{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=The Pagoda Part 2|url=https://westdeanconservation.wordpress.com/2012/06/28/the-pagoda-part-2/|date=28 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cultural Conservation-Restoration |state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Clocks]]\n[[Category:Conservation and restoration]]\n[[Hr:Konzervacija satova]]\n", "name_user": "LEHarrison", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAgents of Deterioration:grammatical error correction", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_and_restoration_of_clocks"}
