Look at the 40 bishops' raspberry of an Easter message to Cameron, with their strong rebuke against the \"national crisis\" of hunger so much worsened by his welfare policies. They know because their churches house the food banks used by almost a million people. (...) Like all humanity, the religious are both good and bad. The C of E is good on food banks, bad on sex and death. Faith makes people no more virtuous, but nor do rationalists claim any moral superiority. Pogroms, inquisitions, jihadist terror and religious massacres can be matched death for death with the secular horrors of Pol Pot, Hitler or Stalin.

She argues that the government has plenty of money to finance tax cuts for better off people. She wrote in March 2017 that \"They plan to cut the size of the state permanently to 36% of GDP, from 45% in 2010.

This goes far beyond the precise shockers \u2013 the Tory MPs who mockingly rejected housing regulation; the cuts to funding to councils responsible for retro-fitting fire suppressants; the disregard of coroner's instructions after the 2009 [[Lakanal House fire|Lakanal House tragedy]]; and even the plan to opt out of EU safety regulations.

In January 2017 she wrote that \"When the [[Royal College of Surgeons]] protests at cancer operations cancelled, is that a tipping point? When nearly half of all hospitals declare major alerts for lack of beds, that's an emergency. Theres no winter flu, no Arctic weather, just pressure from underfunding, like an aneurysm about to burst. But the prime minister is not for turning, not yet.\"  Toynbee also wrote, \"But May can't defy the NHS laws of gravity that force every prime minister to U-turn on underfunding. [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[John Major]] and Tony Blair all buckled. This crisis looks set to outdo all those, says [[Chris Ham]], [[History of the National Health Service (England)|NHS historian]] and head of the [[King's Fund]].

In April 2014 she wrote:\n{{cquote|The C of E is a confusing creature. Even while it tussles internally between conservative and liberal wings on gay marriage or female bishops, polls of its members show it's no longer the Conservative party at prayer: more vote Lib Dem and Labour. Look at the 40 bishops' raspberry of an Easter message to Cameron, with their strong rebuke against the \"national crisis\" of hunger so much worsened by his welfare policies. They know because their churches house the food banks used by almost a million people. (...) Like all humanity, the religious are both good and bad. The C of E is good on food banks, bad on sex and death. Faith makes people no more virtuous, but nor do rationalists claim any moral superiority.

Grosse Ile Township is one of only seven municipalities in the state of Michigan to consist entirely of islands, including [[St. James Township, Michigan|St. James Township]], [[Drummond Township, Michigan|Drummond Township]], [[Bois Blanc Township, Michigan|Bois Blanc Township]], [[Mackinac Island, Michigan|Mackinac Island]], [[Peaine Township, Michigan|Peaine Township]], and [[Sugar Island Township, Michigan|Sugar Island Township]].\n\nThe tip of the main island's northern section is named Hennepin Point in honor of the 17th-century French explorer Father [[Louis Hennepin]]. It is uninhabited and separated from the remainder of the northern section by an unnamed canal that cannot be navigated in a power boat.\n\nThe southern section of the main island is separated from the northern section by the Thorofare Canal, which runs on a diagonal course from east to west connecting the main channel of the [[Detroit River]] with the Trenton Channel of the river. The southern section of the main island is connected by bridges to Elba Island, Meso Island (also known as Upper Hickory Island), Hickory Island, and Swan Island, which are all inhabited.\n[[File:Grosse Ile Toll Bridge in 2006.jpg|thumb|Grosse Ile Toll Bridge]]\n\nNot far from the shoreline of the main island in the river lie Calf Island, Celeron Island (charted as Tawas Island), Dynamite (also known as Powder House Island), Fox Island, Stony Island, and [[Sugar Island (Detroit River)|Sugar Island]], which are all uninhabited. Stony and Celeron are owned by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Calf Island is owned by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] as a part of the [http://www.fws.gov/midwest/detroitriver/ Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge]. The other islands are privately owned.  The low-lying [[Mamajuda Island]] is off the northeastern tip of Grosse Ile and is visible only during times of low water level.\n\nTwo bridges connect the main island to the mainland of Michigan.  The bridge on the north end of the island is called the [[Grosse Ile Toll Bridge]] (off-white color).  The bridge on the south end of the island is officially named the [[Wayne County Bridge]] (light green in color), but is commonly called the \"Free Bridge\" by locals.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}\n\n===Founding and early times===\nThe [[Potawatomi]] occupied areas of the island, which they called ''Kitcheminishen'', and areas in this region for a long period prior to European encounter. They were one of the tribes in the Council of Three Fires.\n\nThe flags of three nations\u2014France, England, and the United States\u2014have flown over Detroit and Grosse Ile since the first French explorers visited the island during the late 17th century. The early French explorers named the island as ''la grosse \u00eele''\u2014the \"big island\" in French. Father [[Louis Hennepin]], a Catholic priest and missionary, accompanied fellow French explorer [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] in 1679 on the ship ''[[Le Griffon]]'' in exploring the [[Great Lakes]].  The Sacred Heart [[Roman Catholic Church]] on Grosse Ile says that Father Hennepin came ashore and said mass at a location on the east shore of the island near the present site of St. Anne's Chapel. No record exists of this event, but Father Hennepin wrote in his journals about the fruit orchards and wild animals on Grosse Ile, showing he was here. The north end of Grosse Ile is named Hennepin Point in his honor.\n\nFrench explorer [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] and his convoy of 25 canoes sailed down the Detroit River and camped on the shore of Grosse Ile during the evening of July 23, 1701.  On the morning of July 24, Cadillac returned upriver and landed ashore, where he claimed French possession of the territory under the authority of [[King Louis XIV]]. This site is in present-day Detroit, near the present intersection of West Jefferson and Shelby streets.\n\nGrosse Ile maintained its own name and identity as a community through the 18th century. The British established control of the island and present-day Michigan in 1763 after their victory in the [[French and Indian War]]. They anglicized the spelling to \"Grosse Isle\".\n\nAlthough the Potawatomi, like most [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], did not have the same sense of property ownership as did Europeans and Americans, they considered the island to be part of their ancestral lands. On July 6, 1776, they deeded the island to brothers [[Alexander Macomb (merchant)|Alexander]] and [[William Macomb (merchant)|William Macomb]], brothers from Albany who had become leading fur traders and merchants in [[Detroit]], partly from selling supplies to the British at Fort Detroit and the local Indian Department. They were so successful that they added a partner for their Detroit trade.<ref name=dill/>\n\n(Alexander Macomb later returned to New York, settling in New York City. He became wealthy from land speculation in southern states. He lost his fortune after buying nearly 4 million acres of land in upstate New York in the postwar period and not being able to resell it rapidly enough.)<ref name=dill>[http://www.mlloyd.org/gen/macomb/text/amsr/wt.htm  David B. Dill Jr. \"Portrait of an Opportunist: The Life of Alexander Macomb\"], ''[[Watertown Daily Times]],'' (September 9, 1990). First of a 3-part series</ref>\n\nThe Macomb brothers likely believed that by purchasing this deed through the transfer of items of value, they had obtained full ownership rights. They are considered to be the founders of the European-American community on the island and the first legal owners of Grosse Ile.\n\n===Settlement to present===\nSettlement started in the 19th century. At least three homes still standing on the island were built during this period by a descendant or relative of the Macomb brothers. The Rucker Homestead, the oldest structure in use on Grosse Ile, has portions that date to 1816. The front structure was added by John Anthony Rucker in 1835.<ref>\"Grosse Ile: A Historical Timeline\"</ref> The [[Rucker-Stanton House]] on West River Road was built in 1848 by the great-grandson of William Macomb. The Wendell House on East River Road was built in the late 1860s by John Wendell, who married a granddaughter of William Macomb.\n\nWestcroft Gardens, a Michigan Centennial Farm located on West River Road, is operated by descendants of the Macombs.  Westcroft, which is open to the public, features a nursery well known for growing and selling hybrid [[azalea]]s and [[rhododendron]]s. Westcroft is one of the oldest farms in Michigan still owned by the same family. Most of the original buildings at Westcroft Gardens are still standing and well preserved.\n\nMacomb Street of the central business district of Grosse Ile was named in honor of the New York brothers. A monument commemorating the day that the tribal chiefs and elders signed the deed to the Macomb brothers is located at the foot of Gray's Drive and near the shoreline of the [[Detroit River]]. The original deed, which was written on [[parchment]], is stored in the [[Burton Historical Collection]] at the [[Detroit Public Library]].\n\n===Trenton Channel and boating===\n[[File:Grosse Ile waterfront.jpg|thumb|A section of Grosse Ile waterfront]]\nBoating has been both a means of transportation and recreation since the first residents lived on the island.  Native Americans used [[canoe]]s to travel between Grosse Ile's islands and the mainland in Michigan and Canada.  Early European settlers primarily used [[sailboat|sail-powered vessels]] to travel to and from the islands.\n\nBy the late 19th century, Grosse Ile was known as a popular destination for recreational boaters. It was also served by steamboats operating from Detroit and small towns along the river and lakes. During this time period Sugar Island, which is one of the twelve islands commonly considered to comprise Grosse Ile, featured an amusement park, dance pavilion, and bathing beach. [[Paddle steamer]]s regularly carried people from Detroit and other points along the Michigan side of the Detroit River to Sugar Island.\n\nDuring this era and into the early 20th century, a number of wealthy residents from Detroit and other nearby towns built summer homes along the shoreline (mainly on the southern end) of Grosse Ile in order to enjoy views of the Detroit River or [[Lake Erie]].  The interior section of the island was sparsely populated, as most of the land was undeveloped woodlands or part of farms.  The residential population of Grosse Ile totaled 802 at the 1920 [[U.S. Census]]. The majority of houses were located around the perimeter of the island and main roads crossed the community chiefly in either a north\u2013south or east\u2013west direction.\n\nIn 1894, the federal government funded and constructed a series of channel [[range light]]s to assist ships to avoid shallow areas in the Detroit River and its shoreline.  The northernmost of the channel range lights was the Grosse Ile Light, which is now the only lighthouse remaining on the island.  The original 1894 Grosse Ile lighthouse resembled a [[water tower]] on stilts, as it was constructed on wooden pilings along with a {{convert|170|ft|adj=on}} walkway to shore.\n\nIt was rebuilt in 1906 and designed as the classic white structure that has become one of the iconic landmarks on the island. The lighthouse is considered a symbol of Grosse Ile; its image is used on the masthead of the ''Ile Camera'' community newspaper and many other places.  The lighthouse's beacon was turned off in the 1940s, and the structure is no longer an important navigation aid for [[lake freighter]]s. Small boaters still refer to the lighthouse in their navigation of the area.\n\nIn 1965, the Grosse Ile Township purchased the lighthouse from the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]] for $350, with funds provided by the Grosse Ile Historical Society (GIHS). The GIHS was given the responsibility to preserve and maintain the lighthouse.  The GIHS annually holds a tour of the lighthouse during a weekend each fall, which is the only time of the year that it is open to the public.\n\nIsland resident Cameron Waterman invented the [[outboard motor]] and successfully tested his invention during February 1905 in the ice-filled Detroit River off the shore of Grosse Ile. He established the Waterman Marine Motor Company in Detroit.  The company eventually manufactured and sold up to 1,000 outboard motors per year until Waterman sold the business in 1917.  During the fall of 2005, the GIHS celebrated the 100th anniversary of Waterman's invention by hosting a public exhibition featuring fully restored Waterman outboard motors. These are highly collectible and very rare.\n\nDuring the [[Prohibition era]], Grosse Ile became a crossing point for [[rum-running|bootleg]]gers illegally smuggling alcoholic beverages from [[Canada]]. They typically arrived at the island via small speed boats.  During the winter months, some daring [[smuggling|smugglers]] drove cars across the frozen river.\n\n===Aviation and military===\n[[File:NAS Grosse Ile NAN2-47.jpg|thumb|Naval Air Station]]\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, a small airport on the southern end of Grosse Ile was the location of historic early aviation activities.  The [[Curtiss-Wright]] Flying Service operated a flying school at the airport.  The Aircraft Development Corporation built the world's first all-metal [[airship]], the [[ZMC-2]], for the Navy in a large hangar. [[Amelia Earhart]] is rumored to have stopped at the airfield on occasion.\n\nGrosse Ile was the home of a [[U.S. Navy]] base for forty years. The [http://nasgi.org U.S. Naval Air Station Grosse Ile] opened in 1929 after three years of construction of [[seaplane]] and [[dirigible]] facilities.  During [[World War II]], the naval base developed into an important center for military [[flight training]]. The base was expanded considerably to accommodate large numbers of American and British fliers who trained on the island. As a young man during WWII, [[George H. W. Bush]] was stationed at the base for training during 1945 for about two months. He later became a politician and President of the United States.\n\nDuring the height of the [[Cold War]], in 1954 the [[U.S. Army]] installed an [[Project Nike|Ajax-Nike missile]] base at the airfield; it was functional until being decommissioned in 1963. The Navy closed the base during November 1969. The federal government transferred it in 1971 to the township government for civilian use as a municipal airport.\n\nToday, the [[Grosse Ile Municipal Airport]] is used primarily for general aviation. It has also been the site of public airshows. Occasionally it serves as a temporary docking area for [[blimp]]s that visit southeastern Michigan to fly over major sporting events. The United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (USEPA) operates the Large Lakes Research Station in one of the buildings on the airport grounds. The airport campus is also the site of [http://www.grosseile.com Grosse Ile Township Hall], which was moved to this location in 2000 from Macomb Street, and a number of private businesses.\n\n===Railroads and bridges===\n\nIn 1873 the Canada Southern Bridge Company, a subsidiary of the [[Canada Southern Railroad Company]], established a railroad from the Michigan mainland to the island that carried both passengers and freight.  The company laid tracks across Grosse Ile and built bridges over the Detroit River to enable trains to be transferred to a ferryboat on Stony Island (one of the islands near the east shoreline of Grosse Ile's \"main island\").  Once on the ferryboat, the train cars were taken to [[Ontario, Canada]] across the river, where they were put back on a rail track to travel to [[Buffalo, New York]] and other points east.  Canada Southern operated trains on this route for about ten years before ceasing service due to financial difficulties.\n\nAfter Canada Southern ended its operations, the [[Michigan Central Railroad]] (MCR) operated a train that provided service between the island and [[Trenton, Michigan]]. From Trenton, travelers could connect with trains or streetcars to Detroit and other cities in the region. In 1904, the Michigan Central Railroad built a small brick and stone depot along the tracks near East River Road on the east side of the island.\n\nTrain service peaked during the early 20th century, but rapidly declined after [[Edward W. Voigt]]'s [[Grosse Ile Bridge Company]] opened the [[Grosse Ile Toll Bridge]] for automobile traffic on November 27, 1913 (Thanksgiving Day).  The bridge, which is privately owned, is on the west side of the island and connects to the city of [[Riverview, Michigan|Riverview]]. After automobile traffic crossing the bridge became the most popular means of traveling to and from the island, the Michigan Central Railroad ceased daily passenger service in early 1924; in 1929 it ended its occasional freight service.\n\nDuring 1931, the county government converted the Michigan Central Railroad's defunct rail bridge crossing the Trenton Channel into the [[Wayne County Bridge]] for use by vehicular, bike and pedestrian traffic.  The rail tracks across the island were replaced by a roadway that is now known as Grosse Ile Parkway.  The Wayne County Bridge is commonly referred to as the \"Free Bridge\" by residents because of it does not charge a toll.\n\nToday, about three-quarters of the vehicle traffic going to and from Grosse Ile travels over the Wayne County Bridge, while one-quarter crosses the Toll Bridge.  The Toll Bridge has been hit twice by [[lake freighter]]s, causing it to close temporarily (in 1965 and in 1992).  The Wayne County Bridge was closed to vehicle traffic for major renovations between May 2, 2007, and December 21, 2007.  During the 2007 county bridge closure period, the Toll Bridge provided the only route for vehicles to travel to and from the island.\n\n===Grosse Ile Historic District===\nToday, the MCR train depot is owned and operated as a community museum by the Gross Ile Historic Society (GIHS). Nearby is the old [[U.S. Customs House (Grosse Ile, Michigan)|U.S. Customs House]], which was relocated to the current site in 1980 from Macomb Street. The GIHS also owns the Custom House, and these are the only structures in the [[National Historic Landmark District|National Historic District]] along East River Road that are regularly open to the public. The district features Saint James [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], the oldest church building on the island, constructed during 1867 in part with funds provided by a freed slave named [[Lisette Denison Forth|Elizabeth Denison]].  The district includes six homes, built from the 1840s to 1860s, that are outstanding examples of period architecture, particularly [[Gothic Revival]] and [[Jacobethan]] Revival.\n\n===Modern times, growth and preservation===\n\nGrosse Ile has good views of commercial shipping and [[pleasure boat]] traffic on the Detroit River.  Lake freighters and oceangoing ships traveling to destinations around the Great Lakes regularly pass near the east side of the island, where the main channel of the Detroit River separates Grosse Ile from Ontario, Canada.\n\nWhile the shoreline areas of Grosse Ile feature the majority of historically significant places and structures, approximately a dozen 1920s-era homes in the Jewell Colony subdivision, located in the middle of the island, are listed on the Michigan Register of Historic Places. Jewell Colony was the first planned subdivision on the island.\n\nDuring the later 20th century, Grosse Ile had a significant increase in the rate of residential development, given its advantageous location and other amenities. By the 1980 census, the population of Grosse Ile had increased to approximately 9,300\u2014 about 106% over its population in the 1960 census.\n\nFearing the destruction of the natural character and small-town charm of the community, during the early 1990s the Grosse Ile Township established an \"Open Space Program\", to be funded by a voter-approved dedicated local property tax to buy undeveloped land. The township acquired large tracts of environmentally sensitive land to slow the pace of development, preserve the environment, and protect housing values.\n\nIn 1993, a group of residents established a 501(c)(3) [[non-profit organization]] named the Grosse Ile Land & Nature Conservancy, to aid in the protection and stewardship of the diverse natural resources on the island. A number of private owners donated environmentally important woodland and wetland areas to the Conservancy to protect them (and to get a tax write-off.)  \t\n\nThe U.S. EPA granted stewardship responsibilities to the Conservancy for a {{convert|40.5|acre|adj=on}} marsh and upland area on the federally owned section of the Grosse Ile Municipal Airport. This tract of land, which at one time was the location of the Navy's seaplane base and later the Army's Nike missile base, has been restored to its natural state; it features rich biodiversity and rare coastal wetlands. Named the Nature Area by the Conservancy, this land is periodically used by local teachers and [[Scouting in Michigan|Boy Scout groups]] to teach children about nature and the importance of conservation.\t\t\n\nGrosse Ile is a community of about 10,371 residents.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> ''Money'' magazine ranked Grosse Ile as one of the \"Top 100 Best Places to Live\" in 2009.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2009/snapshots/PL2635440.html|title=Best Places to Live 2009 - Top 100: Grosse Ile, MI|date=07-13-09|magazine=Money Magazine|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Grosse Ile, MI township hall.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Grosse Ile Township Hall]]\nThe annual \"Islandfest\" (formerly \"[[Azalea]] Festival\") takes place around Grosse Ile Municipal Airport. On the same site as Islandfest, the Grosse Ile Youth Recreational Association (GIYRA), a 501c3 charity, runs a [[haunted house]] every [[Halloween]]. GIYRA coordinates the youth sporting events for the island children. The sports offered by GIYRA are Football and Cheer, Flag Football, Basketball, Baseball and Softball.\n\nThe island has an indoor tennis facility: six courts inside an old hangar at the city's municipal airport. New ownership has taken over the Tennis Center; they have refinished the courts and are conducting other renovations.<!-- year? -->{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe Grosse Ile Soccer Association coordinates the township's soccer league. The rapidly expanding soccer association, which started by hosting a recreational league, has expanded into a larger association. The Grosse Ile Soccer Association has more than 15 select travel / premier level teams on top of the in-house recreational program.\n\nGrosse Ile's community theatre, The Islanders, is Downriver's oldest theatre club and one of the oldest civic theatre groups in the state of Michigan. The club has been active on Grosse Ile since 1925, when friends and neighbors developed a means of entertainment during the long Michigan winters. The first major play was produced on May 21, 1926, by a group of 40 founding members.\n\nThe Grosse Ile High School Robotics Team, 'The Wired Devils', is the island's first robotics team. It is part of the larger community of FIRST teams in Michigan as a whole. The team has grown to more than fifty members since its founding in 2014.\n\nGrosse Ile social clubs include the Grosse Ile Yacht Club, the Ford Yacht Club, the Elba-Mar Boat Club, the Grosse Ile Golf and Country Club, West Shore Golf Course, Water's Edge Golf Course, the Kiwanis Club of Grosse Ile, and the Grosse Ile Rotary Club (founded in 1947).\n\n==Education==\n[[Grosse Ile Township Schools]] serves the township.\n\nOn the island, there are two elementary schools: Parke Lane Elementary which serves grades K-2nd, and Meridian Elementary which serves grades 3rd-5th. The Grosse Ile Middle School enrolls students in 6\u20138, and [[Grosse Ile High School]] provides college preparatory education for grades 9\u201312.  Their mascot is the Red Devil. In 1999 the former middle school was demolished in favor of a new and more up-to-date building. In the process, the historic adjacent school, built in 1911, was demolished amid much controversy. The controversy centered around the desire of many township residents to preserve a historic structure in which many lifelong residents had received their education, and had been the original school building for the island as well.\n\nIn 2001, Grosse Ile was ranked the highest out of 88 school districts in Michigan by ''[[The Detroit News]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.detnews.com/specialreports/2001/reportcard/index.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120728004704/http://www.detnews.com/specialreports/2001/reportcard/index.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 28, 2012|title=Scoring Metro Districts|date=March 4, 2001|newspaper=The Detroit News|accessdate=2009-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nThe [[U.S. Census Bureau]] also defined Grosse Ile Township as a [[census-designated place]] (CDP) in the 2000 Census so that the community would appear on the list of places (like cities and villages) as well on the list of county subdivisions (like other townships).  The final statistics for the township and the CDP were identical.\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 10,894 people, 4,122 households, and 3,293 families residing in the township.  The [[population density]] was 1,133.9 persons per square mile (437.7/km\u00b2).  There were 4,335 housing units at an average density of 451.2 per square mile (174.2/km\u00b2).  The racial makeup of the township was 95.23% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.36% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 0.34% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 2.74% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.04% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.29% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 1.00% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 1.61% of the population.\n\nThere were 4,122 households out of which 34.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 72.8% were married couples living together, 5.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 20.1% were non-families. 17.8% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 2.64 and the average family size was 2.99.\n\nIn the township the population was spread out with 24.9% under the age of 18, 5.1% from 18 to 24, 23.4% from 25 to 44, 34.8% from 45 to 64, and 11.9% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 43 years. For every 100 females, there were 99.6 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 97.0 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the township was $87,062, and the median income for a family was $96,226. Males had a median income of $71,777 versus $42,430 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the township was $42,150.  About 1.9% of families and 2.6% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 3.4% of those under age 18 and 2.6% of those age 65 or over.\n\nThe township is considered to be among the safest communities in Michigan.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1997/oct/10-06-97/news/news9.html |title=Grosse Ile ranked safest |date=June 10, 1997 |publisher=The Michigan Daily Online |accessdate=2009-01-22 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070824105841/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1997/oct/10-06-97/news/news9.html |archivedate=August 24, 2007 }}</ref> It is highly affluent and is isolated in the river, with two bridges connecting it to the mainland.\n\n==Notable residents==\n<!-- This is more detail than usual - why is this justified for these notable residents alone?

The population was 10,371 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]].<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov |title=Race, Hispanic or Latino, Age, and Housing Occupancy: 2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File (QT-PL), Grosse Ile township, Wayne County, Michigan |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=September 8, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe township encompasses several islands in the [[Detroit River]], of which the largest is named as [[Grosse Ile (Michigan)|Grosse Ile]].  Named by French explorers in 1679,  ''Grosse \u00cele'' means \"Big Island\". Later taken under British rule after 1763, the island was not settled by European Americans until after the United States achieved independence in the [[American Revolutionary War]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the township has a total area of {{convert|18.67|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|9.20|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|9.47|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (50.72%) is water.\n\nGrosse Ile is the largest [[List of islands in the Detroit River|island on the Detroit River]]. The township of Grosse Ile is composed of twelve islands, although the community is most often identified with the main island (which residents simply refer to as \"The Island\"). Grosse Ile's main island is technically composed of two islands.  Grosse Ile Township is one of only seven municipalities in the state of Michigan to consist entirely of islands, including [[St. James Township, Michigan|St. James Township]], [[Drummond Township, Michigan|Drummond Township]], [[Bois Blanc Township, Michigan|Bois Blanc Township]], [[Mackinac Island, Michigan|Mackinac Island]], [[Peaine Township, Michigan|Peaine Township]], and [[Sugar Island Township, Michigan|Sugar Island Township]].\n\nThe tip of the main island's northern section is named Hennepin Point in honor of the 17th-century French explorer Father [[Louis Hennepin]]. It is uninhabited and separated from the remainder of the northern section by an unnamed canal that cannot be navigated in a power boat.\n\nThe southern section of the main island is separated from the northern section by the Thorofare Canal, which runs on a diagonal course from east to west connecting the main channel of the [[Detroit River]] with the Trenton Channel of the river. The southern section of the main island is connected by bridges to Elba Island, Meso Island (also known as Upper Hickory Island), Hickory Island, and Swan Island, which are all inhabited.\n[[File:Grosse Ile Toll Bridge in 2006.jpg|thumb|Grosse Ile Toll Bridge]]\n\nNot far from the shoreline of the main island in the river lie Calf Island, Celeron Island (charted as Tawas Island), Dynamite (also known as Powder House Island), Fox Island, Stony Island, and [[Sugar Island (Detroit River)|Sugar Island]], which are all uninhabited. Stony and Celeron are owned by the Michigan Department of Natural Resources. Calf Island is owned by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] as a part of the [http://www.fws.gov/midwest/detroitriver/ Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge]. The other islands are privately owned.  The low-lying [[Mamajuda Island]] is off the northeastern tip of Grosse Ile and is visible only during times of low water level.\n\nTwo bridges connect the main island to the mainland of Michigan.  The bridge on the north end of the island is called the [[Grosse Ile Toll Bridge]] (off-white color).  The bridge on the south end of the island is officially named the [[Wayne County Bridge]] (light green in color), but is commonly called the \"Free Bridge\" by locals.\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2010}}\n\n===Founding and early times===\nThe [[Potawatomi]] occupied areas of the island, which they called ''Kitcheminishen'', and areas in this region for a long period prior to European encounter. They were one of the tribes in the Council of Three Fires.\n\nThe flags of three nations\u2014France, England, and the United States\u2014have flown over Detroit and Grosse Ile since the first French explorers visited the island during the late 17th century. The early French explorers named the island as ''la grosse \u00eele''\u2014the \"big island\" in French. Father [[Louis Hennepin]], a Catholic priest and missionary, accompanied fellow French explorer [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] in 1679 on the ship ''[[Le Griffon]]'' in exploring the [[Great Lakes]].  The Sacred Heart [[Roman Catholic Church]] on Grosse Ile says that Father Hennepin came ashore and said mass at a location on the east shore of the island near the present site of St. Anne's Chapel. No record exists of this event, but Father Hennepin wrote in his journals about the fruit orchards and wild animals on Grosse Ile, showing he was here. The north end of Grosse Ile is named Hennepin Point in his honor.\n\nFrench explorer [[Antoine de la Mothe Cadillac]] and his convoy of 25 canoes sailed down the Detroit River and camped on the shore of Grosse Ile during the evening of July 23, 1701.  On the morning of July 24, Cadillac returned upriver and landed ashore, where he claimed French possession of the territory under the authority of [[King Louis XIV]]. This site is in present-day Detroit, near the present intersection of West Jefferson and Shelby streets.\n\nGrosse Ile maintained its own name and identity as a community through the 18th century. The British established control of the island and present-day Michigan in 1763 after their victory in the [[French and Indian War]]. They anglicized the spelling to \"Grosse Isle\".\n\nAlthough the Potawatomi, like most [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], did not have the same sense of property ownership as did Europeans and Americans, they considered the island to be part of their ancestral lands. On July 6, 1776, they deeded the island to brothers [[Alexander Macomb (merchant)|Alexander]] and [[William Macomb (merchant)|William Macomb]], brothers from Albany who had become leading fur traders and merchants in [[Detroit]], partly from selling supplies to the British at Fort Detroit and the local Indian Department. They were so successful that they added a partner for their Detroit trade.<ref name=dill/>\n\n(Alexander Macomb later returned to New York, settling in New York City. He became wealthy from land speculation in southern states. He lost his fortune after buying nearly 4 million acres of land in upstate New York in the postwar period and not being able to resell it rapidly enough.)<ref name=dill>[http://www.mlloyd.org/gen/macomb/text/amsr/wt.htm  David B. Dill Jr. \"Portrait of an Opportunist: The Life of Alexander Macomb\"], ''[[Watertown Daily Times]],'' (September 9, 1990). First of a 3-part series</ref>\n\nThe Macomb brothers likely believed that by purchasing this deed through the transfer of items of value, they had obtained full ownership rights. They are considered to be the founders of the European-American community on the island and the first legal owners of Grosse Ile.\n\n===Settlement to present===\nSettlement started in the 19th century. At least three homes still standing on the island were built during this period by a descendant or relative of the Macomb brothers. The Rucker Homestead, the oldest structure in use on Grosse Ile, has portions that date to 1816. The front structure was added by John Anthony Rucker in 1835.<ref>\"Grosse Ile: A Historical Timeline\"</ref> The [[Rucker-Stanton House]] on West River Road was built in 1848 by the great-grandson of William Macomb. The Wendell House on East River Road was built in the late 1860s by John Wendell, who married a granddaughter of William Macomb.\n\nWestcroft Gardens, a Michigan Centennial Farm located on West River Road, is operated by descendants of the Macombs.  Westcroft, which is open to the public, features a nursery well known for growing and selling hybrid [[azalea]]s and [[rhododendron]]s. Westcroft is one of the oldest farms in Michigan still owned by the same family. Most of the original buildings at Westcroft Gardens are still standing and well preserved.\n\nMacomb Street of the central business district of Grosse Ile was named in honor of the New York brothers. A monument commemorating the day that the tribal chiefs and elders signed the deed to the Macomb brothers is located at the foot of Gray's Drive and near the shoreline of the [[Detroit River]]. The original deed, which was written on [[parchment]], is stored in the [[Burton Historical Collection]] at the [[Detroit Public Library]].\n\n===Trenton Channel and boating===\n[[File:Grosse Ile waterfront.jpg|thumb|A section of Grosse Ile waterfront]]\nBoating has been both a means of transportation and recreation since the first residents lived on the island.  Native Americans used [[canoe]]s to travel between Grosse Ile's islands and the mainland in Michigan and Canada.  Early European settlers primarily used [[sailboat|sail-powered vessels]] to travel to and from the islands.\n\nBy the late 19th century, Grosse Ile was known as a popular destination for recreational boaters. It was also served by steamboats operating from Detroit and small towns along the river and lakes. During this time period Sugar Island, which is one of the twelve islands commonly considered to comprise Grosse Ile, featured an amusement park, dance pavilion, and bathing beach. [[Paddle steamer]]s regularly carried people from Detroit and other points along the Michigan side of the Detroit River to Sugar Island.\n\nDuring this era and into the early 20th century, a number of wealthy residents from Detroit and other nearby towns built summer homes along the shoreline (mainly on the southern end) of Grosse Ile in order to enjoy views of the Detroit River or [[Lake Erie]].  The interior section of the island was sparsely populated, as most of the land was undeveloped woodlands or part of farms.  The residential population of Grosse Ile totaled 802 at the 1920 [[U.S. Census]]. The majority of houses were located around the perimeter of the island and main roads crossed the community chiefly in either a north\u2013south or east\u2013west direction.\n\nIn 1894, the federal government funded and constructed a series of channel [[range light]]s to assist ships to avoid shallow areas in the Detroit River and its shoreline.  The northernmost of the channel range lights was the Grosse Ile Light, which is now the only lighthouse remaining on the island.  The original 1894 Grosse Ile lighthouse resembled a [[water tower]] on stilts, as it was constructed on wooden pilings along with a {{convert|170|ft|adj=on}} walkway to shore.\n\nIt was rebuilt in 1906 and designed as the classic white structure that has become one of the iconic landmarks on the island. The lighthouse is considered a symbol of Grosse Ile; its image is used on the masthead of the ''Ile Camera'' community newspaper and many other places.  The lighthouse's beacon was turned off in the 1940s, and the structure is no longer an important navigation aid for [[lake freighter]]s. Small boaters still refer to the lighthouse in their navigation of the area.\n\nIn 1965, the Grosse Ile Township purchased the lighthouse from the [[U.S. Department of the Interior]] for $350, with funds provided by the Grosse Ile Historical Society (GIHS). The GIHS was given the responsibility to preserve and maintain the lighthouse.  The GIHS annually holds a tour of the lighthouse during a weekend each fall, which is the only time of the year that it is open to the public.\n\nIsland resident Cameron Waterman invented the [[outboard motor]] and successfully tested his invention during February 1905 in the ice-filled Detroit River off the shore of Grosse Ile. He established the Waterman Marine Motor Company in Detroit.  The company eventually manufactured and sold up to 1,000 outboard motors per year until Waterman sold the business in 1917.  During the fall of 2005, the GIHS celebrated the 100th anniversary of Waterman's invention by hosting a public exhibition featuring fully restored Waterman outboard motors. These are highly collectible and very rare.\n\nDuring the [[Prohibition era]], Grosse Ile became a crossing point for [[rum-running|bootleg]]gers illegally smuggling alcoholic beverages from [[Canada]]. They typically arrived at the island via small speed boats.  During the winter months, some daring [[smuggling|smugglers]] drove cars across the frozen river.\n\n===Aviation and military===\n[[File:NAS Grosse Ile NAN2-47.jpg|thumb|Naval Air Station]]\nDuring the 1920s and 1930s, a small airport on the southern end of Grosse Ile was the location of historic early aviation activities.  The [[Curtiss-Wright]] Flying Service operated a flying school at the airport.  The Aircraft Development Corporation built the world's first all-metal [[airship]], the [[ZMC-2]], for the Navy in a large hangar. [[Amelia Earhart]] is rumored to have stopped at the airfield on occasion.\n\nGrosse Ile was the home of a [[U.S. Navy]] base for forty years. The [http://nasgi.org U.S. Naval Air Station Grosse Ile] opened in 1929 after three years of construction of [[seaplane]] and [[dirigible]] facilities.  During [[World War II]], the naval base developed into an important center for military [[flight training]]. The base was expanded considerably to accommodate large numbers of American and British fliers who trained on the island. As a young man during WWII, [[George H. W. Bush]] was stationed at the base for training during 1945 for about two months. He later became a politician and President of the United States.\n\nDuring the height of the [[Cold War]], in 1954 the [[U.S. Army]] installed an [[Project Nike|Ajax-Nike missile]] base at the airfield; it was functional until being decommissioned in 1963. The Navy closed the base during November 1969. The federal government transferred it in 1971 to the township government for civilian use as a municipal airport.\n\nToday, the [[Grosse Ile Municipal Airport]] is used primarily for general aviation. It has also been the site of public airshows. Occasionally it serves as a temporary docking area for [[blimp]]s that visit southeastern Michigan to fly over major sporting events. The United States [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (USEPA) operates the Large Lakes Research Station in one of the buildings on the airport grounds. The airport campus is also the site of [http://www.grosseile.com Grosse Ile Township Hall], which was moved to this location in 2000 from Macomb Street, and a number of private businesses.\n\n===Railroads and bridges===\n\nIn 1873 the Canada Southern Bridge Company, a subsidiary of the [[Canada Southern Railroad Company]], established a railroad from the Michigan mainland to the island that carried both passengers and freight.  The company laid tracks across Grosse Ile and built bridges over the Detroit River to enable trains to be transferred to a ferryboat on Stony Island (one of the islands near the east shoreline of Grosse Ile's \"main island\").  Once on the ferryboat, the train cars were taken to [[Ontario, Canada]] across the river, where they were put back on a rail track to travel to [[Buffalo, New York]] and other points east.  Canada Southern operated trains on this route for about ten years before ceasing service due to financial difficulties.\n\nAfter Canada Southern ended its operations, the [[Michigan Central Railroad]] (MCR) operated a train that provided service between the island and [[Trenton, Michigan]]. From Trenton, travelers could connect with trains or streetcars to Detroit and other cities in the region. In 1904, the Michigan Central Railroad built a small brick and stone depot along the tracks near East River Road on the east side of the island.\n\nTrain service peaked during the early 20th century, but rapidly declined after [[Edward W. Voigt]]'s [[Grosse Ile Bridge Company]] opened the [[Grosse Ile Toll Bridge]] for automobile traffic on November 27, 1913 (Thanksgiving Day).  The bridge, which is privately owned, is on the west side of the island and connects to the city of [[Riverview, Michigan|Riverview]]. After automobile traffic crossing the bridge became the most popular means of traveling to and from the island, the Michigan Central Railroad ceased daily passenger service in early 1924; in 1929 it ended its occasional freight service.\n\nDuring 1931, the county government converted the Michigan Central Railroad's defunct rail bridge crossing the Trenton Channel into the [[Wayne County Bridge]] for use by vehicular, bike and pedestrian traffic.  The rail tracks across the island were replaced by a roadway that is now known as Grosse Ile Parkway.  The Wayne County Bridge is commonly referred to as the \"Free Bridge\" by residents because of it does not charge a toll.\n\nToday, about three-quarters of the vehicle traffic going to and from Grosse Ile travels over the Wayne County Bridge, while one-quarter crosses the Toll Bridge.  The Toll Bridge has been hit twice by [[lake freighter]]s, causing it to close temporarily (in 1965 and in 1992).  The Wayne County Bridge was closed to vehicle traffic for major renovations between May 2, 2007, and December 21, 2007.  During the 2007 county bridge closure period, the Toll Bridge provided the only route for vehicles to travel to and from the island.\n\n===Grosse Ile Historic District===\nToday, the MCR train depot is owned and operated as a community museum by the Gross Ile Historic Society (GIHS). Nearby is the old [[U.S. Customs House (Grosse Ile, Michigan)|U.S. Customs House]], which was relocated to the current site in 1980 from Macomb Street. The GIHS also owns the Custom House, and these are the only structures in the [[National Historic Landmark District|National Historic District]] along East River Road that are regularly open to the public. The district features Saint James [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]], the oldest church building on the island, constructed during 1867 in part with funds provided by a freed slave named [[Lisette Denison Forth|Elizabeth Denison]].  The district includes six homes, built from the 1840s to 1860s, that are outstanding examples of period architecture, particularly [[Gothic Revival]] and [[Jacobethan]] Revival.\n\n===Modern times, growth and preservation===\n\nGrosse Ile has good views of commercial shipping and [[pleasure boat]] traffic on the Detroit River.  Lake freighters and oceangoing ships traveling to destinations around the Great Lakes regularly pass near the east side of the island, where the main channel of the Detroit River separates Grosse Ile from Ontario, Canada.\n\nWhile the shoreline areas of Grosse Ile feature the majority of historically significant places and structures, approximately a dozen 1920s-era homes in the Jewell Colony subdivision, located in the middle of the island, are listed on the Michigan Register of Historic Places. Jewell Colony was the first planned subdivision on the island.\n\nDuring the later 20th century, Grosse Ile had a significant increase in the rate of residential development, given its advantageous location and other amenities. By the 1980 census, the population of Grosse Ile had increased to approximately 9,300\u2014 about 106% over its population in the 1960 census.\n\nFearing the destruction of the natural character and small-town charm of the community, during the early 1990s the Grosse Ile Township established an \"Open Space Program\", to be funded by a voter-approved dedicated local property tax to buy undeveloped land. The township acquired large tracts of environmentally sensitive land to slow the pace of development, preserve the environment, and protect housing values.\n\nIn 1993, a group of residents established a 501(c)(3) [[non-profit organization]] named the Grosse Ile Land & Nature Conservancy, to aid in the protection and stewardship of the diverse natural resources on the island. A number of private owners donated environmentally important woodland and wetland areas to the Conservancy to protect them (and to get a tax write-off.)  \t\n\nThe U.S. EPA granted stewardship responsibilities to the Conservancy for a {{convert|40.5|acre|adj=on}} marsh and upland area on the federally owned section of the Grosse Ile Municipal Airport. This tract of land, which at one time was the location of the Navy's seaplane base and later the Army's Nike missile base, has been restored to its natural state; it features rich biodiversity and rare coastal wetlands. Named the Nature Area by the Conservancy, this land is periodically used by local teachers and [[Scouting in Michigan|Boy Scout groups]] to teach children about nature and the importance of conservation.\t\t\n\nGrosse Ile is a community of about 10,371 residents.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> ''Money'' magazine ranked Grosse Ile as one of the \"Top 100 Best Places to Live\" in 2009.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/moneymag/bplive/2009/snapshots/PL2635440.html|title=Best Places to Live 2009 - Top 100: Grosse Ile, MI|date=07-13-09|magazine=Money Magazine|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:Grosse Ile, MI township hall.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Grosse Ile Township Hall]]\nThe annual \"Islandfest\" (formerly \"[[Azalea]] Festival\") takes place around Grosse Ile Municipal Airport. On the same site as Islandfest, the Grosse Ile Youth Recreational Association (GIYRA), a 501c3 charity, runs a [[haunted house]] every [[Halloween]]. GIYRA coordinates the youth sporting events for the island children. The sports offered by GIYRA are Football and Cheer, Flag Football, Basketball, Baseball and Softball.\n\nThe island has an indoor tennis facility: six courts inside an old hangar at the city's municipal airport. New ownership has taken over the Tennis Center; they have refinished the courts and are conducting other renovations.<!-- year? -->{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe Grosse Ile Soccer Association coordinates the township's soccer league. The rapidly expanding soccer association, which started by hosting a recreational league, has expanded into a larger association. The Grosse Ile Soccer Association has more than 15 select travel / premier level teams on top of the in-house recreational program.\n\nGrosse Ile's community theatre, The Islanders, is Downriver's oldest theatre club and one of the oldest civic theatre groups in the state of Michigan. The club has been active on Grosse Ile since 1925, when friends and neighbors developed a means of entertainment during the long Michigan winters. The first major play was produced on May 21, 1926, by a group of 40 founding members.\n\nThe Grosse Ile High School Robotics Team, 'The Wired Devils', is the island's first robotics team. It is part of the larger community of FIRST teams in Michigan as a whole. The team has grown to more than fifty members since its founding in 2014.\n\nGrosse Ile social clubs include the Grosse Ile Yacht Club, the Ford Yacht Club, the Elba-Mar Boat Club, the Grosse Ile Golf and Country Club, West Shore Golf Course, Water's Edge Golf Course, the Kiwanis Club of Grosse Ile, and the Grosse Ile Rotary Club (founded in 1947).\n\n==Education==\n[[Grosse Ile Township Schools]] serves the township.\n\nOn the island, there are two elementary schools: Parke Lane Elementary which serves grades K-2nd, and Meridian Elementary which serves grades 3rd-5th. The Grosse Ile Middle School enrolls students in 6\u20138, and [[Grosse Ile High School]] provides college preparatory education for grades 9\u201312.  Their mascot is the Red Devil. In 1999 the former middle school was demolished in favor of a new and more up-to-date building. In the process, the historic adjacent school, built in 1911, was demolished amid much controversy. The controversy centered around the desire of many township residents to preserve a historic structure in which many lifelong residents had received their education, and had been the original school building for the island as well.\n\nIn 2001, Grosse Ile was ranked the highest out of 88 school districts in Michigan by ''[[The Detroit News]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.detnews.com/specialreports/2001/reportcard/index.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120728004704/http://www.detnews.com/specialreports/2001/reportcard/index.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 28, 2012|title=Scoring Metro Districts|date=March 4, 2001|newspaper=The Detroit News|accessdate=2009-01-22}}</ref>\n\n==Demographics==\nThe [[U.S. Census Bureau]] also defined Grosse Ile Township as a [[census-designated place]] (CDP) in the 2000 Census so that the community would appear on the list of places (like cities and villages) as well on the list of county subdivisions (like other townships).  The final statistics for the township and the CDP were identical.\n\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2000, there were 10,894 people, 4,122 households, and 3,293 families residing in the township.

There are now more than twice as many obelisks that were seized and shipped out by Rome as remain in Egypt. The majority were dismantled during the Roman period over 1,700 years ago and the obelisks were sent to different locations.\n\nThe largest standing and tallest Egyptian obelisk is the [[Lateran Obelisk]] in the square at the west side of the [[Lateran Basilica]] in Rome at {{convert|105.6|ft|m}} tall and a weight of {{convert|455|MT|ST}}.<ref name=\"pbs.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/rome.html|title=NOVA Online &#124; Mysteries of the Nile &#124; A World of Obelisks: Rome |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref> More well known is the [[Cultural icon|iconic]] {{convert|25|m|ft}}, {{convert|331|MT|ST|adj=on}} obelisk at [[Saint Peter's Square]].<ref name=\"pbs.org\"/> Brought to Rome by the Emperor [[Caligula]] in AD 37, it has stood at its current site and on the wall of the [[Circus of Nero]], flanking St Peter's Basilica.\n\n{{quote|The elder [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] in his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' refers to the obelisk's transportation from Egypt to Rome by order of the Emperor Gaius (Caligula) as an outstanding event. The barge that carried it had a huge mast of fir wood which four men's arms could not encircle. One hundred and twenty bushels of lentils were needed for ballast. Having fulfilled its purpose, the gigantic vessel was no longer wanted. Therefore, filled with stones and cement, it was sunk to form the foundations of the foremost quay of the new harbour at [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]].<ref>[[James Lees-Milne]], ''Saint Peter's'' (1967).</ref>}}\n\nPope [[Sixtus V]] was determined to erect the obelisk in front of St Peter's, of which the nave was yet to be built. He had a full-sized wooden mock-up erected within months of his election. [[Domenico Fontana]], the assistant of [[Giacomo Della Porta]] in the Basilica's construction, presented the Pope with a little model crane of wood and a heavy little obelisk of lead, which Sixtus himself was able to raise by turning a little winch with his finger. Fontana was given the project. Half-buried in the debris of the ages, it was first excavated as it stood; then it took from 30 April to 17 May 1586 to move it on rollers to the Piazza: it required nearly 1000 men, 140 carthorses, and 47 cranes. The re-erection, scheduled for 14 September, the Feast of the [[Exaltation of the Cross]], was watched by a large crowd. It was a famous feat of engineering, which made the reputation of Fontana, who detailed it in a book illustrated with copperplate etchings, ''Della Trasportatione dell'Obelisco Vaticano et delle Fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto V'' (1590),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/6256/1/index.html|title=Della trasportatione dell\u00aaobelisco Vaticano et delle fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto ...|website=purl.pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchresult.cfm?parent_id=350916&word=|title=Della trasportatione dell'obelisco vaticano et delle fabriche di nostro signore papa Sisto V fatte dal cavallier Domenico Fontana, architetto di Sva Santita, libro primo. \u2013 NYPL Digital Collections|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref> which itself set a new standard in communicating technical information and influenced subsequent architectural publications by its meticulous precision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/5/28/25/606|title=Martayan Lan Rare Books|accessdate=21 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521220913/http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/5/28/25/606|archive-date=21 May 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Before being re-erected the obelisk was exorcised. It is said that Fontana had teams of relay horses to make his getaway if the enterprise failed. When [[Carlo Maderno]] came to build the Basilica's nave, he had to put the slightest kink in its axis, to line it precisely with the obelisk.\n\nThree more obelisks were erected in Rome under Sixtus V: at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], in 1587; at the Lateran Basilica, in 1588; and at the [[Piazza del Popolo]], in 1589.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Della trasportatione dell'obel \u2013 Titelansicht \u2013 ETH-Bibliothek Z\u00fcrich (NEBIS) \u2013 e-rara|publisher=|doi = 10.3931/e-rara-117|year = 1590|last1 = Fontana|first1 = Domenico}}</ref> An obelisk stands in front of the church of [[Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti]], at the head of the [[Spanish Steps]].

The obelisk was erected by either [[Ashurnasirpal I]] (1050\u20131031 BC) or [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883\u2013859 BC). The obelisk bears an inscription that refers to the king's seizure of goods, people and herds, which he carried back to the city of Ashur. The reliefs of the Obelisk depict military campaigns, hunting, victory banquets and scenes of tribute bearing.\n\nThe Rassam Obelisk, named after its discoverer [[Hormuzd Rassam]], was found on the citadel of [[Nimrud]] (ancient Kalhu). It was erected by Ashurnasirpal II, though only survives in fragments. The surviving parts of the reliefs depict scenes of tribute bearing to the king from Syria and the west.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=366799&partId=1&searchText=Rassam+Obelisk&page=1|title=Collection object details|website=British Museum}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Black Obelisk]] was discovered by [[Sir Austen Henry Layard]] in 1846 on the citadel of Kalhu. The obelisk was erected by [[Shalmaneser III]] and the reliefs depict scenes of tribute bearing as well as the depiction of two subdued rulers, [[Jehu]] the Israelite and Sua the Gilzanean, giving gestures of submission to the king. The reliefs on the obelisk have accompanying epigraphs, but besides these the obelisk also possesses a longer inscription that records one of the latest versions of Shalmaneser III's annals, covering the period from his accessional year to his 33rd regnal year.\n\nThe Broken Obelisk, that was also discovered by Rassam at Nineveh.

Together with ({{convert|21|m|ft|disp=or|adj=mid|-high}}) [[King Ezana's Stele]], the last erected one and the only unbroken, the most famous example of axumite obelisk is the so-called ({{convert|24|m|ft|disp=or|adj=mid|-high}}h) [[Obelisk of Axum]]. It was carved around the 4th century AD and, in the course of time, it collapsed and broke into three parts. In these conditions it was found by Italian soldiers in 1935, after the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]], looted and taken to Rome in 1937, where it stood in the Piazza di [[Porta Capena]]. Italy agreed in a 1947 UN agreement to return the obelisk but did not affirm its agreement until 1997, after years of pressure and various controversial settlements. In 2003 the Italian government made the first steps toward its return, and in 2008 it was finally re-erected.\n\nThe largest known obelisk, the [[Great Stele]] at [[Axum]], now fallen, at {{convert|33|m}} high and {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} at the base ({{convert|520|MT|ST|disp=or}})<ref>\"The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World\" edited by Chris scarre 1999</ref> is one of the largest single pieces of stone ever worked in human history (the largest is either at [[Baalbek]] or the [[Ramesseum]]) and probably fell during erection or soon after, destroying a large part of the massive burial chamber underneath it. The obelisks, properly termed [[stela]]e or the native ''[[hawilt]]'' or ''hawilti'' as they do not end in a pyramid, were used to mark graves and underground burial chambers. The largest of the grave markers were for royal burial chambers and were decorated with multi-storey false windows and false doors, while nobility would have smaller less decorated ones. While there are only a few large ones standing, there are hundreds of smaller ones in \"stelae fields\".\n\n===Ancient Roman===\nThe Romans commissioned obelisks in an ancient Egyptian style.

Burger, Abstract of \"The Life and Writings of Julio C. Tello\"], University of Iowa Press, accessed 27 September 2010</ref>\n\n==Erection experiments==\nIn late summer 1999, Roger Hopkins and [[Mark Lehner]] teamed up with a ''[[Nova (American TV program)|NOVA]]'' crew to erect a 25-ton obelisk. This was the third attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk; the first two, in 1994 and 1999, ended in failure. There were also two successful attempts to raise a two-ton obelisk and a nine-ton obelisk. Finally in August\u2013September 1999, after learning from their experiences, they were able to erect one successfully.\n\nFirst Hopkins and Rais Abdel Aleem organized an experiment to tow a block of stone weighing about 25 tons. They prepared a path by embedding wooden rails into the ground and placing a sledge on them bearing a megalith weighing about 25 tons. Initially they used more than 100 people to try to tow it but were unable to budge it. Finally, with well over 130 people pulling at once and an additional dozen using levers to prod the sledge forward, they moved it. Over the course of a day, the workers towed it 10 to 20 feet. Despite problems with broken ropes, they proved the monument could be moved this way.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990314.html \"Dispatches\"], NOVA</ref> Additional experiments were done in Egypt and other locations to tow megalithic stone with ancient technologies, some of which are [[List of megalithic sites#List of efforts to move and install stones|listed here]].\n\nOne experiment was to transport a small obelisk on a barge in the Nile River. The barge was built based on ancient Egyptian designs. It had to be very wide to handle the obelisk, with a 2 to 1 ratio length to width, and it was at least twice as long as the obelisk. The obelisk was about {{convert|10|ft|m|order=flip}} long and no more than {{convert|5|MT|ST}}. A barge big enough to transport the largest Egyptian obelisks with this ratio would have had to be close to {{convert|200|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|100|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}}. The workers used ropes that were wrapped around a guide that enabled them to pull away from the river while they were towing it onto the barge. The barge was successfully launched into the Nile.\n\nThe final and successful erection event was organized by Rick Brown, Hopkins, Lehner and Gregg Mullen in a Massachusetts quarry. The preparation work was done with modern technology, but experiments have proven that with enough time and people, it could have been done with ancient technology. To begin, the obelisk was lying on a gravel and stone ramp. A pit in the middle was filled with dry sand. Previous experiments showed that wet sand would not flow as well. The ramp was secured by stone walls. Men raised the obelisk by slowly removing the sand while three crews of men pulled on ropes to control its descent into the pit. The back wall was designed to guide the obelisk into its proper place. The obelisk had to catch a turning groove which would prevent it from sliding. They used brake ropes to prevent it from going too far. Such turning grooves had been found on the ancient pedestals. Gravity did most of the work until the final 15\u00b0 had to be completed by pulling the obelisk forward. They used brake ropes again to make sure it did not fall forward. On 12 September they completed the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html |title=Mysteries of the Nile &#124; August 27, 1999: The Third Attempt |publisher=Pbs.org |date=27 August 1999 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis experiment has been used to explain how the obelisks may have been erected in Luxor and other locations. It seems to have been supported by a 3,000-year-old [[papyrus]] [[scroll]] in which one scribe taunts another to erect a monument for \"thy lord\".

The majority were dismantled during the Roman period over 1,700 years ago and the obelisks were sent to different locations.\n\nThe largest standing and tallest Egyptian obelisk is the [[Lateran Obelisk]] in the square at the west side of the [[Lateran Basilica]] in Rome at {{convert|105.6|ft|m}} tall and a weight of {{convert|455|MT|ST}}.<ref name=\"pbs.org\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/raising/rome.html|title=NOVA Online &#124; Mysteries of the Nile &#124; A World of Obelisks: Rome |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref> More well known is the [[Cultural icon|iconic]] {{convert|25|m|ft}}, {{convert|331|MT|ST|adj=on}} obelisk at [[Saint Peter's Square]].<ref name=\"pbs.org\"/> Brought to Rome by the Emperor [[Caligula]] in AD 37, it has stood at its current site and on the wall of the [[Circus of Nero]], flanking St Peter's Basilica.\n\n{{quote|The elder [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] in his ''[[Pliny's Natural History|Natural History]]'' refers to the obelisk's transportation from Egypt to Rome by order of the Emperor Gaius (Caligula) as an outstanding event. The barge that carried it had a huge mast of fir wood which four men's arms could not encircle. One hundred and twenty bushels of lentils were needed for ballast. Having fulfilled its purpose, the gigantic vessel was no longer wanted. Therefore, filled with stones and cement, it was sunk to form the foundations of the foremost quay of the new harbour at [[Ostia Antica|Ostia]].<ref>[[James Lees-Milne]], ''Saint Peter's'' (1967).</ref>}}\n\nPope [[Sixtus V]] was determined to erect the obelisk in front of St Peter's, of which the nave was yet to be built. He had a full-sized wooden mock-up erected within months of his election. [[Domenico Fontana]], the assistant of [[Giacomo Della Porta]] in the Basilica's construction, presented the Pope with a little model crane of wood and a heavy little obelisk of lead, which Sixtus himself was able to raise by turning a little winch with his finger. Fontana was given the project. Half-buried in the debris of the ages, it was first excavated as it stood; then it took from 30 April to 17 May 1586 to move it on rollers to the Piazza: it required nearly 1000 men, 140 carthorses, and 47 cranes. The re-erection, scheduled for 14 September, the Feast of the [[Exaltation of the Cross]], was watched by a large crowd. It was a famous feat of engineering, which made the reputation of Fontana, who detailed it in a book illustrated with copperplate etchings, ''Della Trasportatione dell'Obelisco Vaticano et delle Fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto V'' (1590),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/6256/1/index.html|title=Della trasportatione dell\u00aaobelisco Vaticano et delle fabriche di Nostro Signore Papa Sisto ...|website=purl.pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalgallery.nypl.org/nypldigital/dgkeysearchresult.cfm?parent_id=350916&word=|title=Della trasportatione dell'obelisco vaticano et delle fabriche di nostro signore papa Sisto V fatte dal cavallier Domenico Fontana, architetto di Sva Santita, libro primo. \u2013 NYPL Digital Collections|publisher=|accessdate=21 August 2015}}</ref> which itself set a new standard in communicating technical information and influenced subsequent architectural publications by its meticulous precision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/5/28/25/606|title=Martayan Lan Rare Books|accessdate=21 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521220913/http://www.martayanlan.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi/Books/5/28/25/606|archive-date=21 May 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Before being re-erected the obelisk was exorcised. It is said that Fontana had teams of relay horses to make his getaway if the enterprise failed. When [[Carlo Maderno]] came to build the Basilica's nave, he had to put the slightest kink in its axis, to line it precisely with the obelisk.\n\nThree more obelisks were erected in Rome under Sixtus V: at [[Santa Maria Maggiore]], in 1587; at the Lateran Basilica, in 1588; and at the [[Piazza del Popolo]], in 1589.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Della trasportatione dell'obel \u2013 Titelansicht \u2013 ETH-Bibliothek Z\u00fcrich (NEBIS) \u2013 e-rara|publisher=|doi = 10.3931/e-rara-117|year = 1590|last1 = Fontana|first1 = Domenico}}</ref> An obelisk stands in front of the church of [[Trinit\u00e0 dei Monti]], at the head of the [[Spanish Steps]].

The Medici claimed it for the [[Villa Medici]], but in 1790 they moved it to the [[Boboli Gardens]] attached to the [[Palazzo Pitti]] in [[Florence]], and left a replica in its stead.\n\nNot all the Egyptian obelisks in the Roman Empire were set up at Rome.

The obelisk was erected by either [[Ashurnasirpal I]] (1050\u20131031 BC) or [[Ashurnasirpal II]] (883\u2013859 BC). The obelisk bears an inscription that refers to the king's seizure of goods, people and herds, which he carried back to the city of Ashur. The reliefs of the Obelisk depict military campaigns, hunting, victory banquets and scenes of tribute bearing.\n\nThe Rassam Obelisk, named after its discoverer [[Hormuzd Rassam]], was found on the citadel of [[Nimrud]] (ancient Kalhu). It was erected by Ashurnasirpal II, though only survives in fragments. The surviving parts of the reliefs depict scenes of tribute bearing to the king from Syria and the west.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=366799&partId=1&searchText=Rassam+Obelisk&page=1|title=Collection object details|website=British Museum}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Black Obelisk]] was discovered by [[Sir Austen Henry Layard]] in 1846 on the citadel of Kalhu. The obelisk was erected by [[Shalmaneser III]] and the reliefs depict scenes of tribute bearing as well as the depiction of two subdued rulers, [[Jehu]] the Israelite and Sua the Gilzanean, giving gestures of submission to the king. The reliefs on the obelisk have accompanying epigraphs, but besides these the obelisk also possesses a longer inscription that records one of the latest versions of Shalmaneser III's annals, covering the period from his accessional year to his 33rd regnal year.\n\nThe Broken Obelisk, that was also discovered by Rassam at Nineveh. Only the top of this [[monolith]] has been reconstructed in the British Museum.

Together with ({{convert|21|m|ft|disp=or|adj=mid|-high}}) [[King Ezana's Stele]], the last erected one and the only unbroken, the most famous example of axumite obelisk is the so-called ({{convert|24|m|ft|disp=or|adj=mid|-high}}h) [[Obelisk of Axum]]. It was carved around the 4th century AD and, in the course of time, it collapsed and broke into three parts. In these conditions it was found by Italian soldiers in 1935, after the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War]], looted and taken to Rome in 1937, where it stood in the Piazza di [[Porta Capena]]. Italy agreed in a 1947 UN agreement to return the obelisk but did not affirm its agreement until 1997, after years of pressure and various controversial settlements. In 2003 the Italian government made the first steps toward its return, and in 2008 it was finally re-erected.\n\nThe largest known obelisk, the [[Great Stele]] at [[Axum]], now fallen, at {{convert|33|m}} high and {{convert|3|m|abbr=on}} by {{convert|2|m|abbr=on}} at the base ({{convert|520|MT|ST|disp=or}})<ref>\"The Seventy Wonders of the Ancient World\" edited by Chris scarre 1999</ref> is one of the largest single pieces of stone ever worked in human history (the largest is either at [[Baalbek]] or the [[Ramesseum]]) and probably fell during erection or soon after, destroying a large part of the massive burial chamber underneath it. The obelisks, properly termed [[stela]]e or the native ''[[hawilt]]'' or ''hawilti'' as they do not end in a pyramid, were used to mark graves and underground burial chambers. The largest of the grave markers were for royal burial chambers and were decorated with multi-storey false windows and false doors, while nobility would have smaller less decorated ones. While there are only a few large ones standing, there are hundreds of smaller ones in \"stelae fields\".\n\n===Ancient Roman===\nThe Romans commissioned obelisks in an ancient Egyptian style.

Burger, Abstract of \"The Life and Writings of Julio C.

This was the third attempt to erect a 25-ton obelisk; the first two, in 1994 and 1999, ended in failure. There were also two successful attempts to raise a two-ton obelisk and a nine-ton obelisk. Finally in August\u2013September 1999, after learning from their experiences, they were able to erect one successfully.\n\nFirst Hopkins and Rais Abdel Aleem organized an experiment to tow a block of stone weighing about 25 tons. They prepared a path by embedding wooden rails into the ground and placing a sledge on them bearing a megalith weighing about 25 tons. Initially they used more than 100 people to try to tow it but were unable to budge it. Finally, with well over 130 people pulling at once and an additional dozen using levers to prod the sledge forward, they moved it. Over the course of a day, the workers towed it 10 to 20 feet. Despite problems with broken ropes, they proved the monument could be moved this way.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990314.html \"Dispatches\"], NOVA</ref> Additional experiments were done in Egypt and other locations to tow megalithic stone with ancient technologies, some of which are [[List of megalithic sites#List of efforts to move and install stones|listed here]].\n\nOne experiment was to transport a small obelisk on a barge in the Nile River. The barge was built based on ancient Egyptian designs. It had to be very wide to handle the obelisk, with a 2 to 1 ratio length to width, and it was at least twice as long as the obelisk. The obelisk was about {{convert|10|ft|m|order=flip}} long and no more than {{convert|5|MT|ST}}. A barge big enough to transport the largest Egyptian obelisks with this ratio would have had to be close to {{convert|200|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-long}} and {{convert|100|ft|m|order=flip|adj=mid|-wide}}. The workers used ropes that were wrapped around a guide that enabled them to pull away from the river while they were towing it onto the barge. The barge was successfully launched into the Nile.\n\nThe final and successful erection event was organized by Rick Brown, Hopkins, Lehner and Gregg Mullen in a Massachusetts quarry. The preparation work was done with modern technology, but experiments have proven that with enough time and people, it could have been done with ancient technology. To begin, the obelisk was lying on a gravel and stone ramp. A pit in the middle was filled with dry sand. Previous experiments showed that wet sand would not flow as well. The ramp was secured by stone walls. Men raised the obelisk by slowly removing the sand while three crews of men pulled on ropes to control its descent into the pit. The back wall was designed to guide the obelisk into its proper place. The obelisk had to catch a turning groove which would prevent it from sliding. They used brake ropes to prevent it from going too far. Such turning grooves had been found on the ancient pedestals. Gravity did most of the work until the final 15\u00b0 had to be completed by pulling the obelisk forward. They used brake ropes again to make sure it did not fall forward. On 12 September they completed the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/egypt/dispatches/990827.html |title=Mysteries of the Nile &#124; August 27, 1999: The Third Attempt |publisher=Pbs.org |date=27 August 1999 |accessdate=14 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nThis experiment has been used to explain how the obelisks may have been erected in Luxor and other locations.

[[world tag team championship]] contested in [[WWE]] on the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown]] brand. Unveiled on the August 23, 2016 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown Live]]'', it was created to be the counterpart title to the then-WWE Tag Team Championship, which became exclusive to [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] as a result of the [[2016 WWE draft]] and was renamed to [[WWE Raw Tag Team Championship|Raw Tag Team Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Adam|title=Daniel Bryan to reveal two new championships exclusive to Smackdown tonight from Connecticut|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-news/66258-daniel-bryan-reveal-two-new-championships-exclusive-smackdown-live-tonight-connecticut/|website=wrestleview.com|accessdate=August 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe championship is generally contested in [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]], in which participants execute [[Screenplay|scripted]] finishes rather than contend in [[Competition#Sports|direct competition]]. The inaugural champions were [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]], who won the title in a tournament final at [[Backlash (2016)|Backlash]] on September 11, 2016. The current champions are [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]], who are in their sixth reign as a team; individually, it is the sixth reign for [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] and the fifth for [[Kofi Kingston]]. Big E represented the team in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] involving [[Jey Uso]] (of [[The Usos]]) and then-co-champion [[The Miz]] (of [[John Morrison and The Miz]]) on the April 17, 2020 episode of ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]''.\n\nAs of {{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}, overall there have been 19 reigns between 12 teams composed of 23 individual champions, and one vacancy. The team of [[Heath Slater]] and [[Rhyno]] were the inaugural champions. [[The New Day (professional wrestling)|The New Day]] as a stable have the most reigns at five, while individually, stable member [[Big E (wrestler)|Big E]] has the most reigns, also at five.
