He was also a well-known author on law and nationalist issues, and became a QC ([[Queen's Counsel]]) (later KC) in 1893.\n\n==Life==\nMacNeill was from a [[Church of Ireland]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] background. He was the only son of the Rev. John Gordon Swift MacNeill, chaplain of the Richmond Bridewell, Dublin, and of Susan, daughter of the Rev. H. Tweedy, formerly Lieutenant, 7th Dragoon Guards. The 'Swift' in his name came from his descent from Godwin Swift, uncle and guardian to [[Jonathan Swift]] (1667\u20131745). MacNeill was educated at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] and Christ Church, [[Oxford]], and called to the Irish bar in 1875.<ref>Some sources have 1876.</ref> He never married.\n\nAs a Professor of Law at the King's Inns, MacNeill taught a number of Irish political leaders when they were studying for the bar, including [[Timothy Michael Healy|Tim Healy]], [[John Redmond]] and [[William Hoey Kearney Redmond|Willie Redmond]].\n\nOn his own account, MacNeill had been from his earliest years 'enthusiastic in support of the restoration of the old Irish Parliament'. He joined the Home Government Association and its successor the [[Home Rule League]] when he began studying for the bar, and was a member of the Council of these organisations. He was first elected to Parliament in a [[1887 South Donegal by-election|by-election at South Donegal]] in 1887 and sat for the same seat uninterruptedly until 1918. When the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] split over Parnell's leadership in 1890, MacNeill sided with the [[Irish National Federation|Anti-Parnellites]]. At the general elections of 1892 and 1895 he was opposed only by a [[Irish Unionist Party|Unionist candidate]], and not by the Parnellites. At the subsequent four general elections he was returned unopposed, but in 1918 he was deselected as Irish Party candidate in favour of John T. Donovan, who in turn lost the seat to [[Sinn F\u00e9in]].\n\nMacNeill had a formidable mastery of Parliamentary procedure and was a member of the Committee of Privileges from 1908. He devised procedural tactics which enabled the Irish Party to defeat an attempt by the [[Marquess of Salisbury|Salisbury]] government to reduce Irish representation in the [[British House of Commons]].<ref>Maume 1999, p.73</ref> It was his ambition to be the first Speaker of the [[Irish House of Commons]] which would have been established under the [[Third Home Rule Act|Home Rule Act 1914]] had it been implemented. In parallel with his pursuit of [[Irish Home Rule Bill|Home Rule]] for Ireland, many of his efforts were devoted to improving the governance of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. It was his motion to disallow the votes of directors of the Mombasa railway which resulted in the defeat of the Unionist government in 1892. He claimed the credit for establishing the principle that the position of Minister of the Crown is incompatible with directorship of a public company. In 1906, after much effort, he also obtained the abolition of flogging in the [[Royal Navy]].\n\nLike the rest of the Irish Party, MacNeill supported the cause of Britain and her [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] in the [[First World War]]. His support had particularly deep roots. In 1890 he took an unpopular stance in opposing the cession to Germany of [[Heligoland]], which became an important German naval base in the First World War.  MacNeill later described this as 'one of the most important blunders in the history of the world', and claimed that 'But for it humanity could not have been scourged by the Great War'.<ref>MacNeill 1925, p.236</ref> He also campaigned successfully for the removal of titles from German members of the royal family, through the [[Titles Deprivation (Enemies) Act 1917]].\n\nMacNeill had some eccentricities. ''[[The Times]]'' commented 'his learning was allied to a disposition of quite an explosive kind, which, when he was on his feet, made him shout and gesticulate and twist about into many odd shapes and forms'.  His memoirs, ''What I Have Seen and Heard'' (1925) in the main eschew substantive political discussion in favour of anecdotes and character sketches. They do however contain an important account of MacNeill's discussions with [[Cecil John Rhodes|Cecil Rhodes]] in 1887\u201388 which led to the latter's donation of \u00a310,000 to the Irish Party and to the election of [[James Rochfort Maguire]] to Parliament.\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Selected publications==\n* ''The Irish Parliament: What it was and what it did'', London and New York, Cassell, 1885\n* ''English Interference with Irish Industries'', London and New York, Cassell, 1886\n* ''How the Union was Carried'', London, Kegan Paul, Trench, 1887\n* ''Titled Corruption;  the sordid origin of some Irish peerages'', London, T.

These agreements were, however, unpopular in Portugal, where they were seen as being to the disadvantage of the country. In addition, Portugal was declared bankrupt twice\u2014first on 14 June 1892 and again on 10 May 1902\u2014causing industrial disturbances, socialist and republican antagonism, and press criticism of the monarchy. Carlos responded by appointing [[Jo\u00e3o Franco]] as Prime Minister and subsequently accepting Parliament's dissolution. In 1908, Carlos I was [[Lisbon Regicide|assassinated in Lisbon]]. The [[Portuguese monarchy]] lasted until 1910 when, through the [[5 October 1910 revolution|5 October revolution]], it was overthrown and Portugal was proclaimed a [[republic]]. The overthrow of the Portuguese monarchy in 1910 led to a 16-year struggle to sustain parliamentary democracy under republicanism&nbsp;\u2013 the Portuguese First Republic (1910\u20131926).\n\nThe 28 May 1926 ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' or, during the period of ''Estado Novo'', the National Revolution ({{lang-pt|Revolu\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional}}), was a military action that put an end to the chaotic Portuguese First Republic and initiated the ''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'' (National Dictatorship) (years later, renamed ''Estado Novo'').\n\nWith [[Fascism|fascist]] organizations being popular and widely supported across many countries (like [[Italian Fascism]] and [[National Socialism]]) as an [[Anti-communism|antagonist]] of [[Communism|communist]] ideologies, [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] developed the ''Estado Novo'' which can be described as a right leaning [[Corporate statism|corporatist]]. The basis of his regime was a platform of stability, in direct contrast to the unstable environment of the [[Portuguese First Republic|First Republic]].\n\nAccording to some Portuguese scholars like [[Jaime Nogueira Pinto]]<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDBtgA-81D4 O Maior Portugu\u00eas de Sempre&nbsp;\u2013 Oliveira Salazar (1\u00aa Parte)], [[Jaime Nogueira Pinto]] presents Salazar in [[O maior portugu\u00eas de sempre]] ([[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal|RTP]])</ref> and Rui Ramos,<ref name=\"ionline.pt\">[http://www.ionline.pt/conteudo/31720-historia-portugal-luta-faccoes-os-salazaristas Hist\u00f3ria de Portugal.

After the First Republic, when not even public order was achieved, this looked like an impressive breakthrough to most of the population; Salazar achieved his height in popularity at this point. This transfiguration of Portugal was then known as ''A Li\u00e7\u00e3o de Salazar''&nbsp;\u2013 \"Salazar's Lesson\". Salazar's program was opposed to [[communism]], [[socialism]], and [[liberalism]]. It was pro-[[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[conservative]], and [[Nationalism|nationalistic]]. Its policy envisaged the perpetuation of Portugal as a [[pluricontinental]] empire, financially autonomous and politically independent from the dominating [[superpower]]s, and a [[Civilizing mission|source of civilization and stability to the overseas societies in the African and Asian possessions]].\n\n==Regime==\n\nThe Estado Novo based his political philosophy around a close interpretation of the [[Catholic social doctrine]], much like the contemporary regime of [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] in Austria.{{sfn|Meneses|2009|p=162}} The economic system, known as [[corporatism]], was based on similar interpretations of the papal encyclicals ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' ([[Pope Leo XIII|Leo XIII]], 1891){{sfn|Kay|1970|p=63}} and ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' ([[Pope Pius XI|Pius XI]], 1931),{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=63}} which were meant to prevent class struggle and transform economic concerns secondary to social values. ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' argued that labor associations were part of the natural order, like the family. The right of men to organise into trade unions and to engage in labor activities was thus inherent and could not be denied by employers or the state. ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' provided the blue print for the erection of the corporatist system.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=97}}\n\nA new constitution was drafted by a group of lawyers, businessmen, clerics and university professors, with Salazar as the leading spirit and [[Marcelo Caetano]] also playing a major role.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=98}} The constitution created the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|''Estado Novo'']] (\"New State\"), in theory a corporatist state representing interest groups rather than individuals. The leaders wanted a system in which the people would be represented through corporations, rather than through divisive parties, and where national interest was given priority over sectional claims. Salazar thought that the party system had failed irrevocably in Portugal.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=53}}\n\nUnlike Mussolini or [[Hitler]], Salazar never had the intention to create a party-state. Salazar was against the whole-party concept and in 1930 he created the [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]] a single-party, but he created it as a non-party. The National Union was set up to control and restrain public opinion rather than to mobilize it, the goal was to strengthen and preserve traditional values rather than to induce a new social order. Ministers, diplomats and civil servants were never compelled to join the National Union.{{sfn|Gallagher|1990|p=167}}\n\nThe legislature, called the National Assembly, was restricted to members of the [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]]. It could initiate legislation, but only concerning matters that did not require government expenditures.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=55}} The parallel [[Corporative Chamber]] included representatives of municipalities, religious, cultural and professional groups and of the official workers' syndicates that replaced free trade unions.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=55}}\n\nAccording to Howard Wiarda, \"the men who came to power in the Estado Novo were genuinely concerned with the poverty and backwardness of their nation, divorcing themselves from Anglo-American political influences while developing a new indigenous political model and alleviating the miserable living conditions of both rural and urban poor.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=88}}\n\nThe new constitution introduced by Salazar established an anti-parliamentarian and authoritarian government that would last until 1974. The president was to be elected by popular vote for a period of seven years. On paper, the new document vested sweeping, almost dictatorial powers in the hands of the president, including the power to appoint and dismiss the prime minister.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=100}} The president was elevated to a position of preeminence as the \"balance wheel\", the defender and ultimate arbiter of national politics.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=100}} {{efn|According to a dispatch from the British Embassy in Lisbon of that time: \"Generally speaking, this novel constitution is receiving the marked approval which it deserves. It has a certain Fascist quality in its theory of 'corporations', which is a reversion to medieval from the 18th-century doctrines. But this quality, unsuited to our Anglo-Saxon tradition, is not out of place in a country which has hitherto founded its democracy on a French philosophy and found it unsuited to the national temperament\". The British Embassy also pointed out that Portugal's illiteracy made elections difficult and illusory.<ref>*{{cite web|title=British Embassy in Lisbon despatch on draft constitution|url=http://www.cphrc.org/index.php/documents/docnesta/203-1932-07-09-british-embassy-in-lisbon-despatch-on-draft-constitution|website=Contemporary Portuguese History Online|publisher=The Contemporary Portuguese History Research Centre|accessdate=26 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518054411/http://www.cphrc.org/index.php/documents/docnesta/203-1932-07-09-british-embassy-in-lisbon-despatch-on-draft-constitution|archive-date=18 May 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>}} President Carmona, however, had allowed Salazar more or less a free hand since appointing him prime minister and continued to do so; Carmona and his successors would largely be figureheads as he wielded the true power. Wiarda argues that Salazar achieved his position of power not just because of constitutional stipulations, but also because of his character: domineering, absolutist, ambitious, hardworking and intellectually brilliant.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=101}}\n\nThe corporatist constitution was approved in the national [[1933 Portuguese constitutional referendum|Portuguese constitutional referendum]] of 19 March 1933.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=100}}{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=49}} A draft had been published one year before, and the public was invited to state any objections in the press.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=49}} These tended to stay in the realm of generalities and only a handful of people, less than 6,000, voted against the new constitution. {{sfn|Kay|1970|p=49}} The new constitution was approved with 99.5% of the vote, but with 488,840 abstentions{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=49}} (in a registered electorate of 1,330,258) counting as \"yes\".<ref name=NS>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] & St\u00f6ver, P.

Under Salazar's supervision, [[Pedro Teot\u00f3nio Pereira|Teot\u00f3nio Pereira]], the Sub-Secretary of State of Corporations and Social Welfare, reporting directly to Salazar, enacted extensive legislation that shaped the corporatist structure and initiated a comprehensive social welfare system.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=109}} This system was equally anti-capitalist and anti-socialist. The corporatisation of the working class was accompanied by strict legislation regulating business. Workers' organisations were subordinated to state control, but granted a legitimacy that they had never before enjoyed and were made beneficiaries of a variety of new social programs.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=132}} Nevertheless, it is important to note that even in the enthusiastic early years, corporatist agencies were not at the centre of power and therefore corporatism was not the true base of the whole system.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=155}}\n\nIn 1934, Portugal crushed the Portugues Fascist Moveement<ref>Robert O. Paxton, \"The five stages of fascism.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 70.1 (1998): 1\u201323, quotes  at pp 3, 17.</ref> and exiled [[Francisco Rol\u00e3o Preto]] as a part of a purge of the leadership of the [[National Syndicalists (Portugal)|Portuguese National Syndicalists]], also known as the ''camisas azuis'' (\"Blue Shirts\"). Salazar denounced the National Syndicalists as \"inspired by certain foreign models\" (meaning German [[Nazism]]) and condemned their \"exaltation of youth, the cult of force through direct action, the principle of the superiority of state political power in social life, [and] the propensity for organising masses behind a single leader\" as fundamental differences between fascism and the Catholic corporatism of the ''Estado Novo''. Salazar's own party, the [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]], was formed as a subservient umbrella organisation to support the regime itself, and therefore did not have its own philosophy. At the time, many European countries feared the destructive potential of communism. Salazar not only forbade [[Marxism|Marxist]] parties, but also revolutionary fascist-syndicalist parties. One overriding criticism of his regime is that stability was bought and maintained at the expense of suppression of human rights and liberties.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=55}}\n\nThe corporatist state had some similarities to [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italian fascism, but considerable differences in its moral approach to governing.{{sfn|Kay|1970|pp=50\u201351}} Although Salazar admired Mussolini and was influenced by his [[Labour Charter of 1927]],{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=98}} Salazar distanced himself from fascist dictatorship, which he considered a pagan [[Caesarism|Caesarist]] political system that recognised neither legal nor moral limits. Salazar also viewed German Nazism as espousing pagan elements that he considered repugnant. Just before World War II, Salazar made this declaration: \"We are opposed to all forms of Internationalism, Communism, Socialism, Syndicalism and everything that may divide or minimise, or break up the family. We are against class warfare, irreligion and disloyalty to one's country; against serfdom, a materialistic conception of life, and might over right.\"{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=68}} however the Estado Novo adopted many fascist characteristics with the [[Legi\u00e3o Portuguesa (Estado Novo)|Legi\u00e3o Portuguesa]] and [[Mocidade Portuguesa]] being the most prominent examples, however these institutions were a little more than window dressing and had no political influence; after the end of the Spanish Civil War Salazar distanced his regime from fascism due to is pro-British orientation<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vm5by1Najj4C&pg=PA143&lpg=PA143&dq=salazar+mussolini+influence#v=onepage&q=salazar+mussolini+influence&f=false|title=Latin Fascist Elites: The Mussolini, Franco, and Salazar Regimes: The Mussolini, Franco, and Salazar Regimes|first=Paul H.|last=Lewis|date=December 30, 2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books|isbn=9780313013348}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Blamires |first1=Cyprian |last2=Lloyd-Jones |first2=Stewart |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1576079409 |page=528|year=2006 }}</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nPortugal was officially neutral in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u201339), but quietly furnished help to the nationalists of [[Francisco Franco]].

The regime at first showed some pro-[[Axis powers|Axis]] sympathies; Salazar for example expressed approval for the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]]. This support, however, can be mainly attributed to Salazar's staunch anti-communist position rather than actual support for Hitler, or the Nazi regime. From 1943 onward, Portugal favoured the Allies, leasing air bases in the [[Azores]].

He was well aware that the president's power to dismiss the prime minister was, on paper, the only check on Salazar's power. Delgado's rallies subsequently attracted vast crowds.  Evidence later surfaced that the PIDE had stuffed the ballot boxes with votes for Tom\u00e1s. After the elections, Delgado was expelled from the Portuguese Military, and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy before going into exile, spending much of it in Brazil and later in Algeria.

The regime, fearing the growing popularity of both purely democratic and communist ideas among the students, carried out the boycott and closure of several student associations and organizations, including the important National Secretariat of Portuguese Students. Most members of this organization were opposition militants, among them many communists. The political activists who were anti-regime used to be investigated and persecuted by [[PIDE-DGS]], the secret police, and according to the gravity of the offence, were usually sent to jail or transferred from one university to another in order to destabilize oppositionist networks and its hierarchical organization. The students, with strong support from the clandestine [[Portuguese Communist Party]], responded with demonstrations which culminated on 24 March with a huge student demonstration in Lisbon, that was vigorously suppressed by the riot police. [[Marcelo Caetano]], distinguished member of the regime and the incumbent [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[University of Lisbon]], resigned.\n\nThe reluctance of many young men to embrace the hardships of the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] resulted in hundreds of thousands of Portuguese citizens each year leaving to seek economic opportunities abroad in order to escape conscription. In over 15 years, nearly one million emigrated to [[France]], another million to the [[United States]], many hundreds of thousands to [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Venezuela]], or [[Brazil]]. Political parties, such as the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]], persecuted at home, were established in exile. The only party which managed to continue (illegally) operating in Portugal during all the dictatorship was the Portuguese Communist Party.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn 1964, Delgado founded the [[Portuguese National Liberation Front]] in [[Rome]], stating in public that the only way to end the ''Estado Novo'' would be by a [[military coup]], while many others advocated a ''national uprising'' approach.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen L.

Other historians like, the also [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] politician, [[Fernando Rosas]],<ref>Rosas, Fernando, Fernando Martins, Luciano do Amaral, Maria Fernanda Rollo, and Jos\u00e9 Mattoso. O Estado Novo (1926-1974). Estampa, 1998.</ref> point out that Salazar's policies from the 1930s to the 1950s, led to economic and social stagnation and rampant emigration, turning Portugal into one of the poorest countries in Europe, that was also thwarted by scoring lower on literacy than its peers of the [[Northern Hemisphere]].\n\nSalazar suffered a stroke in 1968. As it was thought that he did not have long to live, Tom\u00e1s replaced him with [[Marcelo Caetano]], a reputed scholar of the University of Lisbon Law School, statesman and a distinguished member of the regime. Salazar was never informed of this decision, and reportedly died in 1970 still believing he was prime minister. Most of the people hoped Caetano would soften the edges of Salazar's authoritarian regime and modernize the already growing economy. Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and made important social improvements, such as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay [[social security]]. Some large scale investments were made at national level, such as the building of a major oil processing centre in [[Sines, Portugal|Sines]]. The economy reacted very well at first, but into the 1970s some serious problems began to show, due in part to two-digit inflation (from 1970 and on) and to the effects of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. However, the [[oil crisis of 1973]] had a potentially beneficial effect to Portugal because the largely unexploited oil reserves that Portugal had in its overseas territories of [[Angola]], and [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]] were being developed at a fast pace.\n\nAlthough Caetano was fundamentally an authoritarian, he did make some efforts to open up the regime. Soon after taking power, he rebranded the regime as the \"Social State\", and slightly increased freedom of speech and the press. These measures did not go nearly far enough for a significant element of the population who had no memory of the instability which preceded Salazar. The people were also disappointed that Caetano was unwilling to open up the electoral system. The conduct of the [[1969 Portuguese legislative election|1969]] and [[1973 Portuguese legislative election|1973 elections]] was little different from past elections over the previous four decades. The National Union\u2014renamed People's National Action\u2014swept every seat, as before. Also as before, the opposition was still barely tolerated; opposition candidates were subjected to harsh repression. However, Caetano had to expend all of his political capital to wring even these meager reforms had out of the hardliners in the regime\u2014most notably Tom\u00e1s, who was not nearly as content to give Caetano the free rein that he gave Salazar. Caetano was thus in no position to resist when Tom\u00e1s and the other hardliners forced the end of the reform experiment in 1973.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economic history of Portugal}}\n[[File:Foto 3 Visita Salazar obras Ponte Coimbra015.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] observing [[Edgar Cardoso]]'s Santa Clara Bridge maquette in [[Coimbra]]]]\n\nPortugal's overriding problem in 1926 was its enormous public debt. Several times between 1926 and 1928, Salazar turned down appointment to the finance ministry. He pleaded ill-health, devotion to his aged parents and a preference for the academic cloisters. In 1927, under the ministry of [[Jo\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Sinel de Cordes|Sinel de Cordes]], the public deficit kept on growing. The government tried to obtain loans from [[Barings Bank|Baring Brothers]] under the auspices of the [[League of Nations]], but the conditions were considered unacceptable. With Portugal under the threat of an imminent financial collapse, Salazar finally agreed to become its 81st Finance Minister on 26 April 1928 after the republican and Freemason [[\u00d3scar Carmona]] was elected president. However, before accepting the position, he personally secured from Carmona a categorical assurance that as finance minister he would have a free hand to veto expenditure in all government departments, not just his own. Salazar was the financial czar virtually from the day he took office.\n\nWithin one year, armed with special powers, Salazar balanced the budget and stabilized Portugal's currency. Restoring order to the national accounts, enforcing austerity and red-penciling waste, Salazar produced the first of many budgetary surpluses, an unparalleled novelty in Portugal.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=94}}\n\nIn July 1940, the American [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine featured an article on Portugal, and, referring to its recent chaotic history, asserted that \"anyone who saw Portugal 15 years ago might well have said it deserved to die. It was atrociously governed, bankrupt, squalid, ridden with disease and poverty. It was such a mess that the League of Nations coined a word to describe the absolute low in national welfare: \"Portuguese\". Then the Army overthrew the Republic which had brought the country to this sorry pass\". ''Life'' added that ruling Portugal was difficult and explained how Salazar \"found a country in chaos and poverty\" and then reformed it.<ref>{{cite news |last=|first=|date=29 July 1940|title=Portugal: The War Has Made It Europe's Front Door|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xz8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=2#v=onepage&q&f=false|newspaper=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |location=|publisher=|accessdate=30 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EFTA AELE countries-1995.svg|thumb|left|{{legend|#276d3a|[[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] member states since 1995}}\n{{legend|#b3d9b4|Former member states, now [[European Union|EU]] member states.

The rise of new technocrats in the early 1960s with a background in economics and technical-industrial expertise led to a new period of economic fostering, with Portugal as an attractive country for international investment. Industrial development and economic growth would continue throughout the 1960s. During Salazar's tenure, Portugal participated in the founding of the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) in 1960 and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in 1961. In the early 1960s, Portugal also added its membership in the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), and the [[World Bank]]. This marked the initiation of Salazar's more outward-looking economic policy. Portuguese foreign trade increased by 52 per cent in exports and 40 per cent in imports. The economic growth and levels of capital formation from 1960 to 1973 were characterized by an unparalleled robust annual growth rates of GDP (6.9 per cent), industrial production (9 per cent), private consumption (6.5 per cent) and gross fixed capital formation (7.8 per cent).<ref name=\"Estampa\">{{cite book |last1=Mattoso |first1= Jos\u00e9|last2= Rosas |first2= Fernando |year=1994 |title= Hist\u00f3ria de Portugal: o Estado Novo|trans-title= |url= |language= Portuguese|volume=VII |location=Lisbon |publisher=Estampa|page= 474 |isbn=978-9723310863}}</ref>\n\nIn 1960, at the initiation of Salazar's more outward-looking economic policy, Portugal's per capita GDP was only 38 percent of the European Community (EC-12) average; by the end of the Salazar period, in 1968, it had risen to 48 percent; and in 1973, under the leadership of Marcelo Caetano, Portugal's per capita GDP had reached 56.4 percent of the EC-12 average.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/problemsofdemocr00linz|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/problemsofdemocr00linz/page/128 128]|quote=Financial crisis 1974 Portugal.|title=Problems of Democratic Transition and Consolidation: Southern Europe, South America, and Post-Communist Europe|first1=Juan J.|last1=Linz|first2=Professor Juan J.|last2=Linz|first3=Alfred|last3=Stepan|first4=Wallace Sayre Professor Alfred|last4=Stepan|date=16 August 1996|publisher=JHU Press|via=Internet Archive|isbn=9780801851582}}</ref> On a long term analysis, after a long period of economic divergence before 1914, and a period of chaos during the First Republic, the Portuguese economy recovered slightly until 1950, entering thereafter on a path of strong economic convergence with the wealthiest economies of Western Europe, until the Carnation Revolution in April 1974.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.sedes.pt/conteudo.aspx?args=1,2 Funda\u00e7\u00e3o da SEDES&nbsp;\u2013 As primeiras motiva\u00e7\u00f5es] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6D1yHTY11?url=http://www.sedes.pt/conteudo.aspx?args=1,2 |date=19 December 2012 }}, \"Nos anos 60 e at\u00e9 1973 teve lugar, provavelmente, o mais r\u00e1pido per\u00edodo de crescimento econ\u00f3mico da nossa Hist\u00f3ria, traduzido na industrializa\u00e7\u00e3o, na expans\u00e3o do turismo, no com\u00e9rcio com a EFTA, no desenvolvimento dos sectores financeiros, investimento estrangeiro e grandes projectos de infra-estruturas.

This was accomplished through population and capital transfers, trade liberalization, and the creation of a common currency, the so-called Escudo Area. The integration program established in 1961 provided for the removal of Portugal's duties on imports from its overseas territories by January 1964. The latter, on the other hand, were permitted to continue to levy duties on goods imported from Portugal but at a preferential rate, in most cases 50 percent of the normal duties levied by the territories on goods originating outside the Escudo Area. The effect of this two-tier tariff system was to give Portugal's exports preferential access to its colonial markets. The economies of the overseas provinces, especially those of both the [[Overseas Province of Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]], boomed. [[File:Portuguese colonial war blank map.svg|thumb|left|Portuguese overseas territories in Africa during the ''Estado Novo'' regime: [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]] were by far the two largest of those territories.]]\n\nThe liberalization of the Portuguese economy gained a new impetus under Salazar's successor, Prime Minister [[Marcello Jos\u00e9 das Neves Caetano]] (1968\u20131974), whose administration abolished industrial licensing requirements for firms in most sectors and in 1972 signed a free trade agreement with the newly enlarged [[European Community]]. Under the agreement, which took effect at the beginning of 1973, Portugal was given until 1980 to abolish its restrictions on most community goods and until 1985 on certain sensitive products amounting to some 10 percent of the EC's total exports to Portugal. Starting in 1960, [[EFTA]] membership and a growing foreign investor presence contributed to Portugal's industrial modernization and export diversification between 1960 and 1973. Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and some social improvements, such as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay social security. Some large scale investments were made at national level, such as the building of a major oil processing center in [[Sines, Portugal|Sines]].\n\nNotwithstanding the concentration of the means of production in the hands of a small number of family-based financial-industrial groups, Portuguese business culture permitted a surprising upward mobility of university-educated individuals with middle-class backgrounds into professional management careers.\n\nBefore the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]], the largest, most technologically advanced (and most recently organized) firms offered the greatest opportunity for management careers based on merit rather than by accident of birth.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:marcellocaetano.jpg|frame|right|[[Marcelo Caetano]] appearing on ''Conversas em Fam\u00edlia'' (Family Conversations) on November 19, 1971, a television program broadcast by [[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal|RTP]].]] -->\nBy the early 1970s Portugal's fast economic growth with increasing [[mass consumption|consumption]] and purchase of new automobiles set the priority for improvements in [[Transportation in Portugal|transportation]]. [[Brisa&nbsp;\u2013 Autoestradas de Portugal]] was founded in 1972 and the State granted the company a 30-year concession to design, build, manage, and maintain a modern network of express motorways.\n\nThe economy of Portugal and its overseas territories on the eve of the Carnation Revolution (a military coup on 25 April 1974) was growing well above the European average. Average family purchasing power was rising together with new consumption patterns and trends and this was promoting both investment in new [[capital equipment]] and consumption expenditure for durable and nondurable [[consumer goods]].\n\nThe Estado Novo regime economic policy encouraged and created conditions for the formation of large and successful business conglomerates. Economically, the Estado Novo regime maintained a policy of [[corporatism]] that resulted in the placement of a big part of the Portuguese economy in the hands of a number of strong [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]], including those founded by the families of [[Ant\u00f3nio Champalimaud]] ([[Banco Pinto & Sotto Mayor]], [[Cimpor]]), [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel de Mello]] (CUF&nbsp;\u2013 [[Companhia Uni\u00e3o Fabril]], [[Banco Totta & A\u00e7ores]]), [[Am\u00e9rico Amorim]] ([[Corticeira Amorim]]) and the dos Santos family ([[Jer\u00f3nimo Martins]]). Those Portuguese conglomerates had a business model with similarities to [[Japan]]ese [[keiretsu]]s and [[zaibatsu]]s. The Companhia Uni\u00e3o Fabril (CUF) was one of the largest and most diversified Portuguese conglomerates with its [[core business]]es ([[cement]], [[chemicals]], [[petrochemicals]], [[agrochemicals]], [[textiles]], [[beer]], [[beverages]], [[metallurgy]], [[naval engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[insurance]], [[banking]], [[paper]], [[tourism]], [[mining]], etc.) and corporate headquarters located in [[mainland Portugal]], but also with branches, plants and several developing business projects all around the [[Portuguese Empire]], especially in the Portuguese territories of [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]. Other medium-sized family companies specialized in textiles (for instance those located in the city of [[Covilh\u00e3]] and the northwest), ceramics, porcelain, glass and crystal (like those of [[Alcoba\u00e7a Municipality|Alcoba\u00e7a]], [[Caldas da Rainha]] and [[Marinha Grande]]), engineered wood (like [[SONAE]] near [[Porto]]), canned fish (like those of [[Algarve]] and the northwest), fishing, food and beverages (alcoholic beverages, from liqueurs like [[Licor Beir\u00e3o]] and [[Ginjinha]], to beer like [[Sagres (beer)|Sagres]], were produced across the entire country, but [[Port Wine]] was one of its most reputed and exported alcoholic beverages), tourism (well established in [[Estoril]]/[[Cascais]]/[[Sintra]] and growing as an international attraction in the [[Algarve]] since the 1960s) and in agriculture (like the ones scattered around the [[Alentejo]]&nbsp;\u2013 known as the [[breadbasket]] of Portugal) completed the panorama of the national economy by the early 1970s. In addition, the rural population was committed to [[agrarianism]]\u2014greatly important for a majority of the total population, with many families living exclusively from agriculture or complementing their salaries with farming, husbandry and forestry yields.\n\nBesides that, the overseas territories were also displaying impressive economic growth and development rates from the 1920s onwards. Even during the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961\u20131974), a [[counterinsurgency]] war against independentist [[guerrilla]] and [[terrorism]], the overseas territories of [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]] (Portuguese Overseas Provinces at the time) had continuous economic growth rates and several sectors of its local economies were booming. They were internationally notable centres of production of oil, coffee, cotton, cashew, coconut, timber, minerals (like diamonds), metals (like iron and aluminum), banana, citrus, tea, sisal, beer (Cuca and Laurentina were successful beer brands produced locally), cement, fish and other sea products, beef and textiles. Tourism was also a fast developing activity in Portuguese Africa both by the growing development of and demand for beach resorts and wildlife reserves. While the counterinsurgency war was won in Angola, it was less than satisfactorily contained in Mozambique and dangerously stalemated in Portuguese Guinea from the Portuguese point of view, so the Portuguese Government decided to create [[sustainability]] policies in order to allow continuous sources of financing for the war effort in the long run. On 13 November 1972, a [[sovereign wealth fund]] (''Fundo do Ultramar'' - The Overseas Fund) was enacted through the Decree Law ''Decreto-Lei n.\u00ba 448/ /72'' and the Ministry of Defense ordinance ''Portaria 696/72'', in order to finance the counterinsurgency effort in the Portuguese overseas territories.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [https://www.dn.pt/inicio/opiniao/interior.aspx?content_id=1722768&seccao=Convidados&page=1 A verdade sobre o Fundo do Ultramar] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511164133/http://www.dn.pt/inicio/opiniao/interior.aspx?content_id=1722768&seccao=Convidados&page=1 |date=11 May 2013 }}, [[Di\u00e1rio de Not\u00edcias]] (29 November 2012)</ref> In addition, new Decree Laws (Decree Law: ''Decretos-Leis n.os 353, de 13 de Julho de 1973, e 409, de 20 de Agosto'') were enforced in order to cut down military expenses and increase the number of officers by incorporating irregular militia as if they were regular military academy officers.<ref name=\"infopedia\">{{in lang|pt}} Movimento das For\u00e7as Armadas (MFA).

However, in a context of an expanding economy, bringing better living conditions for the Portuguese population in the 1960s, the outbreak of the colonial wars in Africa set off significant social changes, among them the rapid incorporation of more and more women into the labour market. Marcelo Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and some social improvements, such as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay social security. The objectives of Caetano's pension reform were threefold: enhancing equity, reducing fiscal and actuarial imbalance, and achieving more efficiency for the economy as a whole, for example, by establishing contributions less distortive to labour markets or by allowing the savings generated by pension funds to increase the investments in the economy. In 1969, with the replacement of Salazar by Marcelo Caetano, the Estado Novo-controlled nation got indeed a very slight taste of democracy and Caetano allowed the formation of the first democratic labour union movement since the 1920s.\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Education in Portugal}}\n[[File:UC-GeneralLibrary.jpg|thumb|right|The [[University of Coimbra General Library]] main building&nbsp;\u2013 ''Edif\u00edcio Novo'' (New Building, 1962) in the ''Alta Universit\u00e1ria'', Coimbra]]\n\nAlthough the militants of the First Republic had chosen education as one of their banner causes, the evidence shows that the First Republic was less successful than the authoritarian ''Estado Novo'' in expanding elementary education.

New buildings and campuses were constructed, like the ''Cidade Universit\u00e1ria'' (Lisbon) and the ''Alta Universit\u00e1ria'' (Coimbra).\n[[File:Rectorat de l'universit\u00e9.png|thumb|right|The University of Lisbon campus]]\n\nThe last two decades of the Estado Novo, from the 1960s to the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]], were marked by strong investment in [[Education in Portugal|secondary and university education]], which experienced in this period one of the fastest growth rates of Portuguese education history to date. Though this corresponded to significant growth of post-primary enrolment in larger urban areas, yet there was a gap to be filled in the following years, given the little time to overcome their disadvantaged starting position. The massification of [[secondary education]] was only achieved in the late 1970s and 1980s, so by the time of the Carnation Revolution in 1974 illiteracy was receding, but low-literacy and illiteracy was still high, compared with the highest standards already achieved by the most developed countries in the world.\n\n[[Egas Moniz]], a Portuguese physician who developed the [[cerebral angiography]] and [[leucotomy]], received in 1949 the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]&nbsp;\u2013 even now, the only Portuguese recipient of a Nobel in the sciences.\n\n==End of the regime==\n{{See also|Portuguese Colonial War|Carnation Revolution|Movimento das For\u00e7as Armadas}}\n[[File:Coat of arms of Portuguese India (1951-1974).svg|right|120px|thumb|Coat of arms of [[Portuguese India]]]]\n[[File:Lesser coat of arms of Portuguese West Africa.svg|right|120px|thumb|Coat of arms of the Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola]]]]\n[[File:Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Vag\u00f4 - memorial no Cemit\u00e9rio dos Prazeres.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Memorial at the churchyard Cemit\u00e9rio dos Prazeres in Lisbon for one of the many actions against the regime of Salazar; [[:pt:Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Vag\u00f4|Operation Vag\u00f4]] where leaflets were spread over several Portuguese cities from a [[TAP Portugal|TAP]] plane in 1961.

Lele, 1987,</ref> In 1961, the [[Fort of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]]'s annexation by the [[Republic of Dahomey]] was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries-old [[Portuguese Empire]]. According to the census of 1921 S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1 had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty. Another forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]]. As a result, the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of [[Portuguese India]] against the [[Indian Armed Forces]]. The [[Operation Vijay (1961)|operations]] resulted in the defeat of the limited Portuguese defensive garrison, which was forced to surrender to a much larger military force. The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The Portuguese regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Portugal's National Assembly]]. The so-called \"[[Wind of Change (speech)|Winds of Change]]\" concerning historical colonization in Europe-ruled overseas territories, started to have influence over the centuries-old empire. The end of the Estado Novo effectively began with the uprisings in the overseas territories in Africa during the 1960s. The independence movements active in [[Portuguese Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea]] were supported by both the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], which both wanted to end all colonial empires and expand their own spheres of influence.\n\nFor the Portuguese ruling regime, the centuries-old overseas empire was a matter of [[national interest]]. The criticism against some kinds of racial discrimination in the Portuguese African territories were refuted on the grounds that all Portuguese Africans would be [[Westernized]] and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] in due time, through a process called [[civilizing mission]]. The wars had the same effects in Portugal as the [[Vietnam War]] in the United States, or the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Afghanistan War]] in the Soviet Union; they were unpopular and expensive lengthy wars which were isolating Portugal's diplomacy, leading many to question the continuation of the war and, by extension, the government. Although Portugal was able to maintain some superiority in the colonies by its use of elite paratroopers and special operations troops, the foreign support to the guerrillas, including arms embargoes and other sanctions against the Portuguese, made them more manoeuvrable, allowing them to inflict losses on the Portuguese army. The international community isolated Portugal due to the long-lasting [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial War]]. The situation was aggravated by the illness of Salazar, the strong man of the regime, in 1968. His replacement was one of his closest advisors, [[Marcelo Caetano]], who tried to slowly democratize the country, but could not hide the obvious dictatorship that oppressed Portugal. Salazar died in 1970.\n\nAfter spending the early years of his priesthood in Africa, the British priest [[Adrian Hastings]] created a storm in 1973 with an article in ''[[The Times]]'' about the \"[[Wiriyamu Massacre]]\"<ref>Gomes, Carlos de Matos, Afonso, Aniceto. OS anos da Guerra Colonial - Wiriyamu, De Mo\u00e7ambique para o mundo. Lisboa, 2010</ref> in Mozambique, revealing that the Portuguese Army had massacred some 400 villagers at the village of Wiriyamu, near [[Tete, Mozambique|Tete]], in December 1972. His report was printed a week before the Portuguese prime minister, Marcelo Caetano, was due to visit Britain to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance]]. Portugal's growing isolation following Hastings's claims has often been cited as a factor that helped to bring about the \"carnation revolution\" coup which deposed the Caetano regime in 1974.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1310333/Adrian-Hastings.html Adrian Hastings], [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] (26 June 2001)</ref>\n\nThe various conflicts forced the Salazar and subsequent Caetano governments to spend more of the country's budget on colonial administration and military expenditures, and Portugal soon found itself increasingly isolated from the rest of the world. After Caetano succeeded to the prime ministership, the colonial war became a major cause of dissent and a focus for anti-government forces in Portuguese society. Many young dissidents, such as left-wing students and anti-war activists, were forced to leave the country so they could escape imprisonment or conscription. However, between 1945 and 1974, there were also three generations of militants of the radical right at the Portuguese universities and schools, guided by a revolutionary nationalism partly influenced by the political sub-culture of European neofascism. The core of the struggle of these radical students lay in an uncompromizing defence of the [[Portuguese Empire]] in the days of the authoritarian regime.<ref>[http://www.scielo.oces.mctes.pt/pdf/aso/n188/n188a04.pdf A direita radical na Universidade de Coimbra (1945\u20131974)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303234238/http://www.scielo.oces.mctes.pt/pdf/aso/n188/n188a04.pdf |date=3 March 2009 }}, MARCHI, Riccardo.

ISSN 0003-2573.</ref>\n\nBy the early 1970s, the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] continued to rage on, requiring a steadily increasing budget. The Portuguese military was overstretched and there was no political solution or end in sight. While the human losses were relatively small, the war as a whole had already entered its second decade. The Portuguese ruling regime of Estado Novo faced criticism from the international community and was becoming increasingly isolated. It had a profound impact on Portugal \u2013 thousands of young men avoided [[conscription]] by emigrating illegally, mainly to France and the US.\n\nThe war in the colonies was increasingly unpopular in Portugal itself as the people became weary of war and balked at its ever-rising expense. Many ethnic Portuguese of the African overseas territories were also increasingly willing to accept independence if their economic status could be preserved. However, despite the guerrillas' unpredictable and sporadic attacks against targets all over the countryside of the Portuguese African territories, the economies of both Portuguese Angola and Mozambique were booming, cities and towns were expanding and prospering steadily over time, new transportation networks were being opened to link the well-developed and highly urbanized coastal strip with the more remote inland regions, and the number of ethnic European Portuguese migrants from mainland Portugal (the ''[[metr\u00f3pole]]'') increased rapidly since the 1950s (although always as a small minority of each territory's total population).<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.observatorioemigracao.secomunidades.pt/np4/1878.html Testemunhos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124075350/http://www.observatorioemigracao.secomunidades.pt/np4/1878.html |date=24 January 2011 }}, Observat\u00f3rio da Emigra\u00e7\u00e3o</ref>\n\nSuddenly, after some failed attempts of military rebellion, in April 1974 the [[Carnation Revolution]] in [[Lisbon]], organized by left-wing Portuguese military officers \u2013 the [[Armed Forces Movement]] (MFA), overthrew the Estado Novo regime. The military-led coup can be described as the necessary means of bringing back democracy to Portugal, ending the unpopular [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial War]] where thousands of Portuguese soldiers had been commissioned, and replacing the [[authoritarian]] ''Estado Novo'' (New State) regime and its secret police which repressed elemental [[civil liberties]] and [[political freedom]]s.

Caetano's [[Portuguese Government]] had begun the program (which included several other reforms) in order to increase the number of officials employed against the African insurgencies, and at the same time cut down military costs to alleviate an already overburdened [[government budget]]. After the coup, the [[Movimento das For\u00e7as Armadas|MFA]]-led [[National Salvation Junta]], a military junta, took power. Caetano resigned, and was flown under custody to the [[Madeira Islands]] where he stayed for a few days. He then flew to exile in [[Brazil]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,949058,00.html|title=Time Magazine}}</ref> By 1975 the [[Portuguese Empire]] had all but collapsed.\n\n==Aftermath==\nAfter the ''Estado Novo'' the country would then experience a turbulent period of provisional governments and a nearly disintegrated state reminiscent of the First Republic, a condition that the ''Estado Novo'' had so assiduously attempted to avoid. These provisional governments also briefly censored newspapers and detained oppositionists. Historian [[Kenneth Maxwell]] considers that, for many reasons, Portugal, in its transition from authoritarian rule to a more democratic government, resembled Nicaragua more than any other among the South American nations.<ref>Maxwell, Kenneth (1986) 'Regime Overthrow and the Prospects for Democratic Transition in Portugal' in Transitions from Authoritarian Rule: Prospects for Democracy, ed.

However, pro-communist and socialist elements retained control of the country for several months before elections. [[\u00c1lvaro Cunhal]]'s [[Portuguese Communist Party]] (PCP) remained Stalinist in outlook and unsympathetic to the sort of reforms that were emerging as \"Euro-Communism\" in other countries in Western Europe.<ref>{{cite book|author=Scott B.

By 1975, all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held its first [[1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election|democratic elections]] in 50 years. However, the country continued to be governed by a [[Junta de Salva\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional|military-civilian provisional administration]] until the [[1976 Portuguese legislative election|Portuguese legislative election of 1976]].\n\nFor the Portuguese and their former colonies, this was a very difficult period, but many felt that the short-term effects of the Carnation Revolution were well worth the trouble when civil rights and political freedoms were achieved. The Portuguese celebrate Freedom Day on 25 April every year, and the day is a national holiday in Portugal.\n\nBy refusing to grant independence to its overseas territories in Africa, the Portuguese ruling regime of Estado Novo was criticized by most of the international community, and its leaders [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] and [[Marcelo Caetano|Caetano]] were accused of being blind to the \"Winds of change\". After the [[Carnation revolution]] in 1974 and the fall of the incumbent Portuguese authoritarian regime, almost all the Portugal-ruled territories outside Europe became independent. For the regime, the retention of those overseas possessions had been a matter of [[national interest]].\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Portugal|Conservatism}}\n{{commonscat|Estado Novo}}\n* [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]]\n* [[Carnation Revolution|The Portuguese Carnation Revolution]]\n* [[State capitalism]]\n* [[Dirigisme]]\n* [[Corporatism]]\n* [[Economics of fascism]]\n* [[Estado Novo (Brazil)]]\n* [[Falange]]\n* [[Francisco Franco]]\n* [[Jacques Ploncard]], a French [[Philippe P\u00e9tain|Petainist]], counsellor of Salazar\n* [[Portuguese Legion (Estado Novo)]]\n* [[Timeline of Portuguese history]]\n* [[Yves Gu\u00e9rin-S\u00e9rac]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite journal |last1=de Carvalho |first1=Rita Almeida |title=Ideology and Architecture in the Portuguese 'Estado Novo': Cultural Innovation within a Para-Fascist State (1932\u20131945) |journal=Fascism |date=17 October 2018 |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=141\u2013174 |doi=10.1163/22116257-00702002 }}\n* {{cite book|last=Derrick|first=Michael; R.J.

the [[Corporate statism|corporatist]] period of rule beginning in [[Portugal]] in 1933.

Together, the ''Ditadura Nacional'' and the ''Estado Novo'' are recognised as the Second Portuguese Republic. The ''Estado Novo'', greatly inspired by [[Conservatism|conservative]] and [[Autocracy|autocratic ideologies]], was developed by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]], [[President of the Council of Ministers]] of Portugal from 1932 to 1968, when illness forced him out of office. After 1945, his corporatist economic model was less and less useful and it retarded economic modernization.\n\nOpposed to [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[anarchism]], [[liberalism]] and [[anti-colonialism]],{{efn|Before WWII, Salazar declared: \"We are opposed to all forms of Internationalism, Communism, Socialism, Syndicalism and everything that may divide or minimize, or break up the family.

These agreements were, however, unpopular in Portugal, where they were seen as being to the disadvantage of the country. In addition, Portugal was declared bankrupt twice\u2014first on 14 June 1892 and again on 10 May 1902\u2014causing industrial disturbances, socialist and republican antagonism, and press criticism of the monarchy. Carlos responded by appointing [[Jo\u00e3o Franco]] as Prime Minister and subsequently accepting Parliament's dissolution. In 1908, Carlos I was [[Lisbon Regicide|assassinated in Lisbon]]. The [[Portuguese monarchy]] lasted until 1910 when, through the [[5 October 1910 revolution|5 October revolution]], it was overthrown and Portugal was proclaimed a [[republic]]. The overthrow of the Portuguese monarchy in 1910 led to a 16-year struggle to sustain parliamentary democracy under republicanism&nbsp;\u2013 the Portuguese First Republic (1910\u20131926).\n\nThe 28 May 1926 ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' or, during the period of ''Estado Novo'', the National Revolution ({{lang-pt|Revolu\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional}}), was a military action that put an end to the chaotic Portuguese First Republic and initiated the ''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'' (National Dictatorship) (years later, renamed ''Estado Novo'').\n\nWith [[Fascism|fascist]] organizations being popular and widely supported across many countries (like [[Italian Fascism]] and [[National Socialism]]) as an [[Anti-communism|antagonist]] of [[Communism|communist]] ideologies, [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] developed the ''Estado Novo'' which can be described as a right leaning [[Corporate statism|corporatist]]. The basis of his regime was a platform of stability, in direct contrast to the unstable environment of the [[Portuguese First Republic|First Republic]].\n\nAccording to some Portuguese scholars like [[Jaime Nogueira Pinto]]<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDBtgA-81D4 O Maior Portugu\u00eas de Sempre&nbsp;\u2013 Oliveira Salazar (1\u00aa Parte)], [[Jaime Nogueira Pinto]] presents Salazar in [[O maior portugu\u00eas de sempre]] ([[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal|RTP]])</ref> and Rui Ramos,<ref name=\"ionline.pt\">[http://www.ionline.pt/conteudo/31720-historia-portugal-luta-faccoes-os-salazaristas Hist\u00f3ria de Portugal.

After the First Republic, when not even public order was achieved, this looked like an impressive breakthrough to most of the population; Salazar achieved his height in popularity at this point. This transfiguration of Portugal was then known as ''A Li\u00e7\u00e3o de Salazar''&nbsp;\u2013 \"Salazar's Lesson\". Salazar's program was opposed to [[communism]], [[socialism]], and [[liberalism]]. It was pro-[[Catholic Church|Catholic]], [[conservative]], and [[Nationalism|nationalistic]]. Its policy envisaged the perpetuation of Portugal as a [[pluricontinental]] empire, financially autonomous and politically independent from the dominating [[superpower]]s, and a [[Civilizing mission|source of civilization and stability to the overseas societies in the African and Asian possessions]].\n\n==Regime==\n\nThe Estado Novo based his political philosophy around a close interpretation of the [[Catholic social doctrine]], much like the contemporary regime of [[Engelbert Dollfuss]] in Austria.{{sfn|Meneses|2009|p=162}} The economic system, known as [[corporatism]], was based on similar interpretations of the papal encyclicals ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' ([[Pope Leo XIII|Leo XIII]], 1891){{sfn|Kay|1970|p=63}} and ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' ([[Pope Pius XI|Pius XI]], 1931),{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=63}} which were meant to prevent class struggle and transform economic concerns secondary to social values. ''[[Rerum novarum]]'' argued that labor associations were part of the natural order, like the family. The right of men to organise into trade unions and to engage in labor activities was thus inherent and could not be denied by employers or the state. ''[[Quadragesimo anno]]'' provided the blue print for the erection of the corporatist system.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=97}}\n\nA new constitution was drafted by a group of lawyers, businessmen, clerics and university professors, with Salazar as the leading spirit and [[Marcelo Caetano]] also playing a major role.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=98}} The constitution created the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|''Estado Novo'']] (\"New State\"), in theory a corporatist state representing interest groups rather than individuals. The leaders wanted a system in which the people would be represented through corporations, rather than through divisive parties, and where national interest was given priority over sectional claims. Salazar thought that the party system had failed irrevocably in Portugal.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=53}}\n\nUnlike Mussolini or [[Hitler]], Salazar never had the intention to create a party-state. Salazar was against the whole-party concept and in 1930 he created the [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]] a single-party, but he created it as a non-party. The National Union was set up to control and restrain public opinion rather than to mobilize it, the goal was to strengthen and preserve traditional values rather than to induce a new social order. Ministers, diplomats and civil servants were never compelled to join the National Union.{{sfn|Gallagher|1990|p=167}}\n\nThe legislature, called the National Assembly, was restricted to members of the [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]]. It could initiate legislation, but only concerning matters that did not require government expenditures.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=55}} The parallel [[Corporative Chamber]] included representatives of municipalities, religious, cultural and professional groups and of the official workers' syndicates that replaced free trade unions.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=55}}\n\nAccording to Howard Wiarda, \"the men who came to power in the Estado Novo were genuinely concerned with the poverty and backwardness of their nation, divorcing themselves from Anglo-American political influences while developing a new indigenous political model and alleviating the miserable living conditions of both rural and urban poor.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=88}}\n\nThe new constitution introduced by Salazar established an anti-parliamentarian and authoritarian government that would last until 1974. The president was to be elected by popular vote for a period of seven years. On paper, the new document vested sweeping, almost dictatorial powers in the hands of the president, including the power to appoint and dismiss the prime minister.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=100}} The president was elevated to a position of preeminence as the \"balance wheel\", the defender and ultimate arbiter of national politics.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=100}} {{efn|According to a dispatch from the British Embassy in Lisbon of that time: \"Generally speaking, this novel constitution is receiving the marked approval which it deserves. It has a certain Fascist quality in its theory of 'corporations', which is a reversion to medieval from the 18th-century doctrines. But this quality, unsuited to our Anglo-Saxon tradition, is not out of place in a country which has hitherto founded its democracy on a French philosophy and found it unsuited to the national temperament\". The British Embassy also pointed out that Portugal's illiteracy made elections difficult and illusory.<ref>*{{cite web|title=British Embassy in Lisbon despatch on draft constitution|url=http://www.cphrc.org/index.php/documents/docnesta/203-1932-07-09-british-embassy-in-lisbon-despatch-on-draft-constitution|website=Contemporary Portuguese History Online|publisher=The Contemporary Portuguese History Research Centre|accessdate=26 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518054411/http://www.cphrc.org/index.php/documents/docnesta/203-1932-07-09-british-embassy-in-lisbon-despatch-on-draft-constitution|archive-date=18 May 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>}} President Carmona, however, had allowed Salazar more or less a free hand since appointing him prime minister and continued to do so; Carmona and his successors would largely be figureheads as he wielded the true power. Wiarda argues that Salazar achieved his position of power not just because of constitutional stipulations, but also because of his character: domineering, absolutist, ambitious, hardworking and intellectually brilliant.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=101}}\n\nThe corporatist constitution was approved in the national [[1933 Portuguese constitutional referendum|Portuguese constitutional referendum]] of 19 March 1933.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=100}}{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=49}} A draft had been published one year before, and the public was invited to state any objections in the press.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=49}} These tended to stay in the realm of generalities and only a handful of people, less than 6,000, voted against the new constitution. {{sfn|Kay|1970|p=49}} The new constitution was approved with 99.5% of the vote, but with 488,840 abstentions{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=49}} (in a registered electorate of 1,330,258) counting as \"yes\".<ref name=NS>[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] & St\u00f6ver, P.

Their right to vote had not been obtained during the First Republic, despite feminist efforts, and even in the referendum vote, secondary education was a requirement for female voters, whereas males only needed to be able to read and write.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ad\u00e3o|first1=\u00c1urea|last2=Rem\u00e9dios|first2=Maria Jos\u00e9|title=The educational narrativity in the first period of Oliveira Salazar's government.

Under Salazar's supervision, [[Pedro Teot\u00f3nio Pereira|Teot\u00f3nio Pereira]], the Sub-Secretary of State of Corporations and Social Welfare, reporting directly to Salazar, enacted extensive legislation that shaped the corporatist structure and initiated a comprehensive social welfare system.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=109}} This system was equally anti-capitalist and anti-socialist. The corporatisation of the working class was accompanied by strict legislation regulating business. Workers' organisations were subordinated to state control, but granted a legitimacy that they had never before enjoyed and were made beneficiaries of a variety of new social programs.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=132}} Nevertheless, it is important to note that even in the enthusiastic early years, corporatist agencies were not at the centre of power and therefore corporatism was not the true base of the whole system.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=155}}\n\nIn 1934, Portugal crushed the Portugues Fascist Moveement<ref>Robert O. Paxton, \"The five stages of fascism.\" ''Journal of Modern History'' 70.1 (1998): 1\u201323, quotes  at pp 3, 17.</ref> and exiled [[Francisco Rol\u00e3o Preto]] as a part of a purge of the leadership of the [[National Syndicalists (Portugal)|Portuguese National Syndicalists]], also known as the ''camisas azuis'' (\"Blue Shirts\"). Salazar denounced the National Syndicalists as \"inspired by certain foreign models\" (meaning German [[Nazism]]) and condemned their \"exaltation of youth, the cult of force through direct action, the principle of the superiority of state political power in social life, [and] the propensity for organising masses behind a single leader\" as fundamental differences between fascism and the Catholic corporatism of the ''Estado Novo''. Salazar's own party, the [[National Union (Portugal)|National Union]], was formed as a subservient umbrella organisation to support the regime itself, and therefore did not have its own philosophy. At the time, many European countries feared the destructive potential of communism. Salazar not only forbade [[Marxism|Marxist]] parties, but also revolutionary fascist-syndicalist parties. One overriding criticism of his regime is that stability was bought and maintained at the expense of suppression of human rights and liberties.{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=55}}\n\nThe corporatist state had some similarities to [[Benito Mussolini]]'s Italian fascism, but considerable differences in its moral approach to governing.{{sfn|Kay|1970|pp=50\u201351}} Although Salazar admired Mussolini and was influenced by his [[Labour Charter of 1927]],{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=98}} Salazar distanced himself from fascist dictatorship, which he considered a pagan [[Caesarism|Caesarist]] political system that recognised neither legal nor moral limits. Salazar also viewed German Nazism as espousing pagan elements that he considered repugnant. Just before World War II, Salazar made this declaration: \"We are opposed to all forms of Internationalism, Communism, Socialism, Syndicalism and everything that may divide or minimise, or break up the family. We are against class warfare, irreligion and disloyalty to one's country; against serfdom, a materialistic conception of life, and might over right.\"{{sfn|Kay|1970|p=68}} however the Estado Novo adopted many fascist characteristics with the [[Legi\u00e3o Portuguesa (Estado Novo)|Legi\u00e3o Portuguesa]] and [[Mocidade Portuguesa]] being the most prominent examples, however these institutions were a little more than window dressing and had no political influence; after the end of the Spanish Civil War Salazar distanced his regime from fascism due to is pro-British orientation<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vm5by1Najj4C&pg=PA143&lpg=PA143&dq=salazar+mussolini+influence#v=onepage&q=salazar+mussolini+influence&f=false|title=Latin Fascist Elites: The Mussolini, Franco, and Salazar Regimes: The Mussolini, Franco, and Salazar Regimes|first=Paul H.|last=Lewis|date=December 30, 2002|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books|isbn=9780313013348}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Blamires |first1=Cyprian |last2=Lloyd-Jones |first2=Stewart |title=World Fascism: A Historical Encyclopedia |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1576079409 |page=528|year=2006 }}</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nPortugal was officially neutral in the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936\u201339), but quietly furnished help to the nationalists of [[Francisco Franco]]. During World War II, 1939\u20131945, [[Portugal during World War II|Portugal remained officially neutral]], giving its highest priority to avoiding a Nazi invasion of the sort that was so devastating in most other European countries. The regime at first showed some pro-[[Axis powers|Axis]] sympathies; Salazar for example expressed approval for the [[German invasion of the Soviet Union]]. This support, however, can be mainly attributed to Salazar's staunch anti-communist position rather than actual support for Hitler, or the Nazi regime. From 1943 onward, Portugal favoured the Allies, leasing air bases in the [[Azores]]. Portugal reluctantly leased the Azores as a direct result of being threatened with invasion should Portugal not cater to the requests of the Allies. As an official neutral, Portugal traded with both sides. It cut off vital shipments of [[tungsten]] and rubber to Germany in 1944, after heavy pressure from the Allies.<ref>Douglas L.

Naval Minister [[Am\u00e9rico Tom\u00e1s]], a staunch conservative, ran in the [[1958 Portuguese presidential election|1958 elections]] as the official candidate.

He was well aware that the president's power to dismiss the prime minister was, on paper, the only check on Salazar's power. Delgado's rallies subsequently attracted vast crowds.  Evidence later surfaced that the PIDE had stuffed the ballot boxes with votes for Tom\u00e1s. After the elections, Delgado was expelled from the Portuguese Military, and took refuge in the Brazilian embassy before going into exile, spending much of it in Brazil and later in Algeria.

The regime, fearing the growing popularity of both purely democratic and communist ideas among the students, carried out the boycott and closure of several student associations and organizations, including the important National Secretariat of Portuguese Students. Most members of this organization were opposition militants, among them many communists. The political activists who were anti-regime used to be investigated and persecuted by [[PIDE-DGS]], the secret police, and according to the gravity of the offence, were usually sent to jail or transferred from one university to another in order to destabilize oppositionist networks and its hierarchical organization. The students, with strong support from the clandestine [[Portuguese Communist Party]], responded with demonstrations which culminated on 24 March with a huge student demonstration in Lisbon, that was vigorously suppressed by the riot police. [[Marcelo Caetano]], distinguished member of the regime and the incumbent [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[University of Lisbon]], resigned.\n\nThe reluctance of many young men to embrace the hardships of the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] resulted in hundreds of thousands of Portuguese citizens each year leaving to seek economic opportunities abroad in order to escape conscription. In over 15 years, nearly one million emigrated to [[France]], another million to the [[United States]], many hundreds of thousands to [[Germany]], [[Switzerland]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Venezuela]], or [[Brazil]]. Political parties, such as the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Socialist Party]], persecuted at home, were established in exile. The only party which managed to continue (illegally) operating in Portugal during all the dictatorship was the Portuguese Communist Party.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nIn 1964, Delgado founded the [[Portuguese National Liberation Front]] in [[Rome]], stating in public that the only way to end the ''Estado Novo'' would be by a [[military coup]], while many others advocated a ''national uprising'' approach.<ref>{{cite book|author=Stephen L.

Other historians like, the also [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] politician, [[Fernando Rosas]],<ref>Rosas, Fernando, Fernando Martins, Luciano do Amaral, Maria Fernanda Rollo, and Jos\u00e9 Mattoso. O Estado Novo (1926-1974). Estampa, 1998.</ref> point out that Salazar's policies from the 1930s to the 1950s, led to economic and social stagnation and rampant emigration, turning Portugal into one of the poorest countries in Europe, that was also thwarted by scoring lower on literacy than its peers of the [[Northern Hemisphere]].\n\nSalazar suffered a stroke in 1968. As it was thought that he did not have long to live, Tom\u00e1s replaced him with [[Marcelo Caetano]], a reputed scholar of the University of Lisbon Law School, statesman and a distinguished member of the regime. Salazar was never informed of this decision, and reportedly died in 1970 still believing he was prime minister. Most of the people hoped Caetano would soften the edges of Salazar's authoritarian regime and modernize the already growing economy. Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and made important social improvements, such as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay [[social security]]. Some large scale investments were made at national level, such as the building of a major oil processing centre in [[Sines, Portugal|Sines]]. The economy reacted very well at first, but into the 1970s some serious problems began to show, due in part to two-digit inflation (from 1970 and on) and to the effects of the [[1973 oil crisis]]. However, the [[oil crisis of 1973]] had a potentially beneficial effect to Portugal because the largely unexploited oil reserves that Portugal had in its overseas territories of [[Angola]], and [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]] were being developed at a fast pace.\n\nAlthough Caetano was fundamentally an authoritarian, he did make some efforts to open up the regime. Soon after taking power, he rebranded the regime as the \"Social State\", and slightly increased freedom of speech and the press. These measures did not go nearly far enough for a significant element of the population who had no memory of the instability which preceded Salazar. The people were also disappointed that Caetano was unwilling to open up the electoral system. The conduct of the [[1969 Portuguese legislative election|1969]] and [[1973 Portuguese legislative election|1973 elections]] was little different from past elections over the previous four decades. The National Union\u2014renamed People's National Action\u2014swept every seat, as before. Also as before, the opposition was still barely tolerated; opposition candidates were subjected to harsh repression. However, Caetano had to expend all of his political capital to wring even these meager reforms had out of the hardliners in the regime\u2014most notably Tom\u00e1s, who was not nearly as content to give Caetano the free rein that he gave Salazar. Caetano was thus in no position to resist when Tom\u00e1s and the other hardliners forced the end of the reform experiment in 1973.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economic history of Portugal}}\n[[File:Foto 3 Visita Salazar obras Ponte Coimbra015.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar|Salazar]] observing [[Edgar Cardoso]]'s Santa Clara Bridge maquette in [[Coimbra]]]]\n\nPortugal's overriding problem in 1926 was its enormous public debt. Several times between 1926 and 1928, Salazar turned down appointment to the finance ministry. He pleaded ill-health, devotion to his aged parents and a preference for the academic cloisters. In 1927, under the ministry of [[Jo\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 Sinel de Cordes|Sinel de Cordes]], the public deficit kept on growing. The government tried to obtain loans from [[Barings Bank|Baring Brothers]] under the auspices of the [[League of Nations]], but the conditions were considered unacceptable. With Portugal under the threat of an imminent financial collapse, Salazar finally agreed to become its 81st Finance Minister on 26 April 1928 after the republican and Freemason [[\u00d3scar Carmona]] was elected president. However, before accepting the position, he personally secured from Carmona a categorical assurance that as finance minister he would have a free hand to veto expenditure in all government departments, not just his own. Salazar was the financial czar virtually from the day he took office.\n\nWithin one year, armed with special powers, Salazar balanced the budget and stabilized Portugal's currency. Restoring order to the national accounts, enforcing austerity and red-penciling waste, Salazar produced the first of many budgetary surpluses, an unparalleled novelty in Portugal.{{sfn|Wiarda|1977|p=94}}\n\nIn July 1940, the American [[Life (magazine)|''Life'']] magazine featured an article on Portugal, and, referring to its recent chaotic history, asserted that \"anyone who saw Portugal 15 years ago might well have said it deserved to die. It was atrociously governed, bankrupt, squalid, ridden with disease and poverty. It was such a mess that the League of Nations coined a word to describe the absolute low in national welfare: \"Portuguese\". Then the Army overthrew the Republic which had brought the country to this sorry pass\". ''Life'' added that ruling Portugal was difficult and explained how Salazar \"found a country in chaos and poverty\" and then reformed it.<ref>{{cite news |last=|first=|date=29 July 1940|title=Portugal: The War Has Made It Europe's Front Door|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xz8EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA65&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=2#v=onepage&q&f=false|newspaper=[[Life (magazine)|Life]] |location=|publisher=|accessdate=30 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[File:EFTA AELE countries-1995.svg|thumb|left|{{legend|#276d3a|[[European Free Trade Association|EFTA]] member states since 1995}}\n{{legend|#b3d9b4|Former member states, now [[European Union|EU]] member states.

The rise of new technocrats in the early 1960s with a background in economics and technical-industrial expertise led to a new period of economic fostering, with Portugal as an attractive country for international investment. Industrial development and economic growth would continue throughout the 1960s. During Salazar's tenure, Portugal participated in the founding of the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA) in 1960 and the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) in 1961. In the early 1960s, Portugal also added its membership in the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), and the [[World Bank]]. This marked the initiation of Salazar's more outward-looking economic policy. Portuguese foreign trade increased by 52 per cent in exports and 40 per cent in imports. The economic growth and levels of capital formation from 1960 to 1973 were characterized by an unparalleled robust annual growth rates of GDP (6.9 per cent), industrial production (9 per cent), private consumption (6.5 per cent) and gross fixed capital formation (7.8 per cent).<ref name=\"Estampa\">{{cite book |last1=Mattoso |first1= Jos\u00e9|last2= Rosas |first2= Fernando |year=1994 |title= Hist\u00f3ria de Portugal: o Estado Novo|trans-title= |url= |language= Portuguese|volume=VII |location=Lisbon |publisher=Estampa|page= 474 |isbn=978-9723310863}}</ref>\n\nIn 1960, at the initiation of Salazar's more outward-looking economic policy, Portugal's per capita GDP was only 38 percent of the European Community (EC-12) average; by the end of the Salazar period, in 1968, it had risen to 48 percent; and in 1973, under the leadership of Marcelo Caetano, Portugal's per capita GDP had reached 56.4 percent of the EC-12 average.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/problemsofdemocr00linz|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/problemsofdemocr00linz/page/128 128]|quote=Financial crisis 1974 Portugal.|title=Problems of Democratic Transition and Consolidation: Southern Europe, South America, and Post-Communist Europe|first1=Juan J.|last1=Linz|first2=Professor Juan J.|last2=Linz|first3=Alfred|last3=Stepan|first4=Wallace Sayre Professor Alfred|last4=Stepan|date=16 August 1996|publisher=JHU Press|via=Internet Archive|isbn=9780801851582}}</ref> On a long term analysis, after a long period of economic divergence before 1914, and a period of chaos during the First Republic, the Portuguese economy recovered slightly until 1950, entering thereafter on a path of strong economic convergence with the wealthiest economies of Western Europe, until the Carnation Revolution in April 1974.<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.sedes.pt/conteudo.aspx?args=1,2 Funda\u00e7\u00e3o da SEDES&nbsp;\u2013 As primeiras motiva\u00e7\u00f5es] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6D1yHTY11?url=http://www.sedes.pt/conteudo.aspx?args=1,2 |date=19 December 2012 }}, \"Nos anos 60 e at\u00e9 1973 teve lugar, provavelmente, o mais r\u00e1pido per\u00edodo de crescimento econ\u00f3mico da nossa Hist\u00f3ria, traduzido na industrializa\u00e7\u00e3o, na expans\u00e3o do turismo, no com\u00e9rcio com a EFTA, no desenvolvimento dos sectores financeiros, investimento estrangeiro e grandes projectos de infra-estruturas.

This was accomplished through population and capital transfers, trade liberalization, and the creation of a common currency, the so-called Escudo Area. The integration program established in 1961 provided for the removal of Portugal's duties on imports from its overseas territories by January 1964. The latter, on the other hand, were permitted to continue to levy duties on goods imported from Portugal but at a preferential rate, in most cases 50 percent of the normal duties levied by the territories on goods originating outside the Escudo Area. The effect of this two-tier tariff system was to give Portugal's exports preferential access to its colonial markets. The economies of the overseas provinces, especially those of both the [[Overseas Province of Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]], boomed. [[File:Portuguese colonial war blank map.svg|thumb|left|Portuguese overseas territories in Africa during the ''Estado Novo'' regime: [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]] were by far the two largest of those territories.]]\n\nThe liberalization of the Portuguese economy gained a new impetus under Salazar's successor, Prime Minister [[Marcello Jos\u00e9 das Neves Caetano]] (1968\u20131974), whose administration abolished industrial licensing requirements for firms in most sectors and in 1972 signed a free trade agreement with the newly enlarged [[European Community]]. Under the agreement, which took effect at the beginning of 1973, Portugal was given until 1980 to abolish its restrictions on most community goods and until 1985 on certain sensitive products amounting to some 10 percent of the EC's total exports to Portugal. Starting in 1960, [[EFTA]] membership and a growing foreign investor presence contributed to Portugal's industrial modernization and export diversification between 1960 and 1973. Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and some social improvements, such as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay social security. Some large scale investments were made at national level, such as the building of a major oil processing center in [[Sines, Portugal|Sines]].\n\nNotwithstanding the concentration of the means of production in the hands of a small number of family-based financial-industrial groups, Portuguese business culture permitted a surprising upward mobility of university-educated individuals with middle-class backgrounds into professional management careers.\n\nBefore the 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]], the largest, most technologically advanced (and most recently organized) firms offered the greatest opportunity for management careers based on merit rather than by accident of birth.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:marcellocaetano.jpg|frame|right|[[Marcelo Caetano]] appearing on ''Conversas em Fam\u00edlia'' (Family Conversations) on November 19, 1971, a television program broadcast by [[R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal|RTP]].]] -->\nBy the early 1970s Portugal's fast economic growth with increasing [[mass consumption|consumption]] and purchase of new automobiles set the priority for improvements in [[Transportation in Portugal|transportation]]. [[Brisa&nbsp;\u2013 Autoestradas de Portugal]] was founded in 1972 and the State granted the company a 30-year concession to design, build, manage, and maintain a modern network of express motorways.\n\nThe economy of Portugal and its overseas territories on the eve of the Carnation Revolution (a military coup on 25 April 1974) was growing well above the European average. Average family purchasing power was rising together with new consumption patterns and trends and this was promoting both investment in new [[capital equipment]] and consumption expenditure for durable and nondurable [[consumer goods]].\n\nThe Estado Novo regime economic policy encouraged and created conditions for the formation of large and successful business conglomerates. Economically, the Estado Novo regime maintained a policy of [[corporatism]] that resulted in the placement of a big part of the Portuguese economy in the hands of a number of strong [[conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]], including those founded by the families of [[Ant\u00f3nio Champalimaud]] ([[Banco Pinto & Sotto Mayor]], [[Cimpor]]), [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel de Mello]] (CUF&nbsp;\u2013 [[Companhia Uni\u00e3o Fabril]], [[Banco Totta & A\u00e7ores]]), [[Am\u00e9rico Amorim]] ([[Corticeira Amorim]]) and the dos Santos family ([[Jer\u00f3nimo Martins]]). Those Portuguese conglomerates had a business model with similarities to [[Japan]]ese [[keiretsu]]s and [[zaibatsu]]s. The Companhia Uni\u00e3o Fabril (CUF) was one of the largest and most diversified Portuguese conglomerates with its [[core business]]es ([[cement]], [[chemicals]], [[petrochemicals]], [[agrochemicals]], [[textiles]], [[beer]], [[beverages]], [[metallurgy]], [[naval engineering]], [[electrical engineering]], [[insurance]], [[banking]], [[paper]], [[tourism]], [[mining]], etc.) and corporate headquarters located in [[mainland Portugal]], but also with branches, plants and several developing business projects all around the [[Portuguese Empire]], especially in the Portuguese territories of [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]. Other medium-sized family companies specialized in textiles (for instance those located in the city of [[Covilh\u00e3]] and the northwest), ceramics, porcelain, glass and crystal (like those of [[Alcoba\u00e7a Municipality|Alcoba\u00e7a]], [[Caldas da Rainha]] and [[Marinha Grande]]), engineered wood (like [[SONAE]] near [[Porto]]), canned fish (like those of [[Algarve]] and the northwest), fishing, food and beverages (alcoholic beverages, from liqueurs like [[Licor Beir\u00e3o]] and [[Ginjinha]], to beer like [[Sagres (beer)|Sagres]], were produced across the entire country, but [[Port Wine]] was one of its most reputed and exported alcoholic beverages), tourism (well established in [[Estoril]]/[[Cascais]]/[[Sintra]] and growing as an international attraction in the [[Algarve]] since the 1960s) and in agriculture (like the ones scattered around the [[Alentejo]]&nbsp;\u2013 known as the [[breadbasket]] of Portugal) completed the panorama of the national economy by the early 1970s. In addition, the rural population was committed to [[agrarianism]]\u2014greatly important for a majority of the total population, with many families living exclusively from agriculture or complementing their salaries with farming, husbandry and forestry yields.\n\nBesides that, the overseas territories were also displaying impressive economic growth and development rates from the 1920s onwards. Even during the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961\u20131974), a [[counterinsurgency]] war against independentist [[guerrilla]] and [[terrorism]], the overseas territories of [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]] (Portuguese Overseas Provinces at the time) had continuous economic growth rates and several sectors of its local economies were booming. They were internationally notable centres of production of oil, coffee, cotton, cashew, coconut, timber, minerals (like diamonds), metals (like iron and aluminum), banana, citrus, tea, sisal, beer (Cuca and Laurentina were successful beer brands produced locally), cement, fish and other sea products, beef and textiles. Tourism was also a fast developing activity in Portuguese Africa both by the growing development of and demand for beach resorts and wildlife reserves. While the counterinsurgency war was won in Angola, it was less than satisfactorily contained in Mozambique and dangerously stalemated in Portuguese Guinea from the Portuguese point of view, so the Portuguese Government decided to create [[sustainability]] policies in order to allow continuous sources of financing for the war effort in the long run.

However, in a context of an expanding economy, bringing better living conditions for the Portuguese population in the 1960s, the outbreak of the colonial wars in Africa set off significant social changes, among them the rapid incorporation of more and more women into the labour market. Marcelo Caetano moved on to foster economic growth and some social improvements, such as the awarding of a monthly pension to rural workers who had never had the chance to pay social security. The objectives of Caetano's pension reform were threefold: enhancing equity, reducing fiscal and actuarial imbalance, and achieving more efficiency for the economy as a whole, for example, by establishing contributions less distortive to labour markets or by allowing the savings generated by pension funds to increase the investments in the economy. In 1969, with the replacement of Salazar by Marcelo Caetano, the Estado Novo-controlled nation got indeed a very slight taste of democracy and Caetano allowed the formation of the first democratic labour union movement since the 1920s.\n\n==Education==\n{{Main|Education in Portugal}}\n[[File:UC-GeneralLibrary.jpg|thumb|right|The [[University of Coimbra General Library]] main building&nbsp;\u2013 ''Edif\u00edcio Novo'' (New Building, 1962) in the ''Alta Universit\u00e1ria'', Coimbra]]\n\nAlthough the militants of the First Republic had chosen education as one of their banner causes, the evidence shows that the First Republic was less successful than the authoritarian ''Estado Novo'' in expanding elementary education.

Though this corresponded to significant growth of post-primary enrolment in larger urban areas, yet there was a gap to be filled in the following years, given the little time to overcome their disadvantaged starting position. The massification of [[secondary education]] was only achieved in the late 1970s and 1980s, so by the time of the Carnation Revolution in 1974 illiteracy was receding, but low-literacy and illiteracy was still high, compared with the highest standards already achieved by the most developed countries in the world.\n\n[[Egas Moniz]], a Portuguese physician who developed the [[cerebral angiography]] and [[leucotomy]], received in 1949 the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]&nbsp;\u2013 even now, the only Portuguese recipient of a Nobel in the sciences.\n\n==End of the regime==\n{{See also|Portuguese Colonial War|Carnation Revolution|Movimento das For\u00e7as Armadas}}\n[[File:Coat of arms of Portuguese India (1951-1974).svg|right|120px|thumb|Coat of arms of [[Portuguese India]]]]\n[[File:Lesser coat of arms of Portuguese West Africa.svg|right|120px|thumb|Coat of arms of the Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola]]]]\n[[File:Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Vag\u00f4 - memorial no Cemit\u00e9rio dos Prazeres.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Memorial at the churchyard Cemit\u00e9rio dos Prazeres in Lisbon for one of the many actions against the regime of Salazar; [[:pt:Opera\u00e7\u00e3o Vag\u00f4|Operation Vag\u00f4]] where leaflets were spread over several Portuguese cities from a [[TAP Portugal|TAP]] plane in 1961.

Lele, 1987,</ref> In 1961, the [[Fort of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]]'s annexation by the [[Republic of Dahomey]] was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries-old [[Portuguese Empire]]. According to the census of 1921 S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1 had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty. Another forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]]. As a result, the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of [[Portuguese India]] against the [[Indian Armed Forces]]. The [[Operation Vijay (1961)|operations]] resulted in the defeat of the limited Portuguese defensive garrison, which was forced to surrender to a much larger military force. The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The Portuguese regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in [[Assembly of the Republic (Portugal)|Portugal's National Assembly]]. The so-called \"[[Wind of Change (speech)|Winds of Change]]\" concerning historical colonization in Europe-ruled overseas territories, started to have influence over the centuries-old empire. The end of the Estado Novo effectively began with the uprisings in the overseas territories in Africa during the 1960s. The independence movements active in [[Portuguese Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea]] were supported by both the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], which both wanted to end all colonial empires and expand their own spheres of influence.\n\nFor the Portuguese ruling regime, the centuries-old overseas empire was a matter of [[national interest]]. The criticism against some kinds of racial discrimination in the Portuguese African territories were refuted on the grounds that all Portuguese Africans would be [[Westernized]] and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] in due time, through a process called [[civilizing mission]]. The wars had the same effects in Portugal as the [[Vietnam War]] in the United States, or the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Afghanistan War]] in the Soviet Union; they were unpopular and expensive lengthy wars which were isolating Portugal's diplomacy, leading many to question the continuation of the war and, by extension, the government. Although Portugal was able to maintain some superiority in the colonies by its use of elite paratroopers and special operations troops, the foreign support to the guerrillas, including arms embargoes and other sanctions against the Portuguese, made them more manoeuvrable, allowing them to inflict losses on the Portuguese army. The international community isolated Portugal due to the long-lasting [[Portuguese Colonial War|Colonial War]]. The situation was aggravated by the illness of Salazar, the strong man of the regime, in 1968. His replacement was one of his closest advisors, [[Marcelo Caetano]], who tried to slowly democratize the country, but could not hide the obvious dictatorship that oppressed Portugal. Salazar died in 1970.\n\nAfter spending the early years of his priesthood in Africa, the British priest [[Adrian Hastings]] created a storm in 1973 with an article in ''[[The Times]]'' about the \"[[Wiriyamu Massacre]]\"<ref>Gomes, Carlos de Matos, Afonso, Aniceto. OS anos da Guerra Colonial - Wiriyamu, De Mo\u00e7ambique para o mundo. Lisboa, 2010</ref> in Mozambique, revealing that the Portuguese Army had massacred some 400 villagers at the village of Wiriyamu, near [[Tete, Mozambique|Tete]], in December 1972. His report was printed a week before the Portuguese prime minister, Marcelo Caetano, was due to visit Britain to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the [[Anglo-Portuguese Alliance]]. Portugal's growing isolation following Hastings's claims has often been cited as a factor that helped to bring about the \"carnation revolution\" coup which deposed the Caetano regime in 1974.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1310333/Adrian-Hastings.html Adrian Hastings], [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] (26 June 2001)</ref>\n\nThe various conflicts forced the Salazar and subsequent Caetano governments to spend more of the country's budget on colonial administration and military expenditures, and Portugal soon found itself increasingly isolated from the rest of the world. After Caetano succeeded to the prime ministership, the colonial war became a major cause of dissent and a focus for anti-government forces in Portuguese society. Many young dissidents, such as left-wing students and anti-war activists, were forced to leave the country so they could escape imprisonment or conscription. However, between 1945 and 1974, there were also three generations of militants of the radical right at the Portuguese universities and schools, guided by a revolutionary nationalism partly influenced by the political sub-culture of European neofascism. The core of the struggle of these radical students lay in an uncompromizing defence of the [[Portuguese Empire]] in the days of the authoritarian regime.<ref>[http://www.scielo.oces.mctes.pt/pdf/aso/n188/n188a04.pdf A direita radical na Universidade de Coimbra (1945\u20131974)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303234238/http://www.scielo.oces.mctes.pt/pdf/aso/n188/n188a04.pdf |date=3 March 2009 }}, MARCHI, Riccardo.

The Portuguese military was overstretched and there was no political solution or end in sight. While the human losses were relatively small, the war as a whole had already entered its second decade. The Portuguese ruling regime of Estado Novo faced criticism from the international community and was becoming increasingly isolated. It had a profound impact on Portugal \u2013 thousands of young men avoided [[conscription]] by emigrating illegally, mainly to France and the US.\n\nThe war in the colonies was increasingly unpopular in Portugal itself as the people became weary of war and balked at its ever-rising expense. Many ethnic Portuguese of the African overseas territories were also increasingly willing to accept independence if their economic status could be preserved. However, despite the guerrillas' unpredictable and sporadic attacks against targets all over the countryside of the Portuguese African territories, the economies of both Portuguese Angola and Mozambique were booming, cities and towns were expanding and prospering steadily over time, new transportation networks were being opened to link the well-developed and highly urbanized coastal strip with the more remote inland regions, and the number of ethnic European Portuguese migrants from mainland Portugal (the ''[[metr\u00f3pole]]'') increased rapidly since the 1950s (although always as a small minority of each territory's total population).<ref>{{in lang|pt}} [http://www.observatorioemigracao.secomunidades.pt/np4/1878.html Testemunhos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124075350/http://www.observatorioemigracao.secomunidades.pt/np4/1878.html |date=24 January 2011 }}, Observat\u00f3rio da Emigra\u00e7\u00e3o</ref>\n\nSuddenly, after some failed attempts of military rebellion, in April 1974 the [[Carnation Revolution]] in [[Lisbon]], organized by left-wing Portuguese military officers \u2013 the [[Armed Forces Movement]] (MFA), overthrew the Estado Novo regime.

After the coup, the [[Movimento das For\u00e7as Armadas|MFA]]-led [[National Salvation Junta]], a military junta, took power.

{"title_page": "Henry Harrison (Irish politician)", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\nCaptain '''Henry Harrison''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE|MC*|MP}} (17 December 1867 \u2013 20 February 1954) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] politician. He served as [[Member of Parliament|MP]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] and as member of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] represented [[Mid Tipperary (UK Parliament constituency)|Mid Tipperary]] from 1890 to 1892. He later served as a [[Royal Irish Regiment (1684\u20131922)|Royal Irish Regiment]] officer with the [[Kitchener's Army|New British Army]] in [[World War I]], was an extensive writer, and proponent of improved relations between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].\n\n==Biography==\nA [[Protestant Nationalist|Protestant nationalist]], Harrison was the son of Henry Harrison of [[Holywood]] and [[Ardkeen (civil parish)|Ardkeen]], [[Co. Down]] and of Letitia Tennent. She was the daughter of [[Robert James Tennent]], who had been [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] MP for [[Belfast (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast]] from 1847 to 1852.  Later, when widowed, she married the author Hartley Withers.\n\nHarrison went to [[Westminster School]] and then to [[Balliol College]], [[Oxford University|Oxford]]. While there he developed an admiration for [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] and became secretary of the Oxford University [[Home Rule League|Home Rule Group]]. At this time, the [[Land War]] was in progress and in 1889 Harrison went to Ireland to visit the scene of the evictions in [[Gweedore]], [[Co. Donegal]]. He became involved in physical confrontations with the [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] and as a result became a Nationalist celebrity overnight. The following May, Parnell offered the vacant parliamentary seat of Mid-Tipperary to Harrison, who left Oxford, still aged only 22, to take it up, unopposed.\n\nOnly six months later, following the divorce case involving [[Katharine O'Shea]], the Irish Parliamentary Party split over Parnell's leadership. Harrison strongly supported Parnell, acted as his bodyguard and aide-de-camp, and after Parnell's death devoted himself to the service of his widow Katharine. From her he heard a completely different version of the events surrounding the divorce case from that which had appeared in the press, and this was to form the seed of his later books.\n\nAt the [[1892 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1892]], Harrison did not defend Mid-Tipperary. He stood at [[West Limerick (UK Parliament constituency)|West Limerick]] as a [[Parnellite]] instead, but came nowhere near winning the seat. In [[1895 United Kingdom general election|1895 general election]], he stood at [[North Sligo (UK Parliament constituency)|North Sligo]], polling better but again far short of winning.<ref>''The Times'', Obituary, 22 February 1954, states that Harrison did not seek to stand for Parliament again after the end of his initial term in 1892.  This is a mistake as ''The Times'' itself reported his candidacies in 1892 and 1895.</ref> In 1895 Harrison married Maie Byrne, an American, with whom he had a son. He came to prominence briefly again in 1903 when, in spite of his lack of legal training, he successfully conducted his own case in a court action all the way to the [[British House of Lords|House of Lords]].\n\nOtherwise, however, he disappeared from public view until his war service with the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1684-1922)|Royal Irish Regiment]] when he served on the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]] with distinction in the [[Kitchener's Army|New British Army]] formed for the [[First World War]], reaching the rank of Captain and being awarded the [[Military Cross|MC]]. He organised patrols in \"[[No man's land|No Man's Land]]\" so successfully that he was appointed special patrol officer to the [[16th (Irish) Division]]. He was invalided out and became a recruiting officer in Ireland. He was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in the [[1919 New Year Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=31114 |supp=y |page=455|date= 8 January 1919}}</ref>\n\nHe then made a return to Irish politics, working with [[Horace Plunkett|Sir Horace Plunkett]] as Secretary of the [[Irish Dominion League]], an organisation campaigning for [[dominion status]] for Ireland within the [[British Empire]]. Harrison was a lifelong opponent of [[Partition of Ireland|Irish partition]]. He was Irish correspondent of ''The Economist'' from 1922 to 1927 and owner-editor of ''Irish Truth'' from 1924 to 1927.\n\nHarrison's two books defending Parnell were published in 1931 and 1938. They have had a major impact on Irish historiography, leading to a more favourable view of Parnell's role in the O\u2019Shea affair. [[F. S. L. Lyons]]<ref>(1977, p.324)</ref> commented that he \"did more than anyone else to uncover what seems to have been the true facts\" about the Parnell-O'Shea liaison. The second book, ''Parnell, Joseph Chamberlain and Mr Garvin'', was written in response to [[James Louis Garvin|J. L. Garvin]]'s biography of [[Joseph Chamberlain]], which had ignored Harrison's first book, ''Parnell Vindicated:  The Lifting of the Veil''.  Later, Harrison successfully repulsed an attempt in the official history of ''The Times'' to rehabilitate that newspaper's role in using forged letters to attack Parnell in the later 1880s. In 1952 he forced ''The Times'' to publish a four-page correction written by him as an appendix to the fourth volume of the history.\n\nDuring the difficult years of the [[Anglo-Irish Trade War]] over the land purchase annuities, [[John A. Costello#Declaration of the republic|declaration of the Republic]], [[Irish neutrality during World War II]], and departure from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], Harrison worked to promote good relations between Britain and Ireland. He published various books and pamphlets on the issues in dispute and wrote numerous letters to ''The Times''. He also founded, with General Sir [[Hubert Gough]], the [[Commonwealth Irish Association]] in 1942. By the time of his death, he was the last survivor of the Irish Parliamentary Party led by Parnell, and as a member of the pre-1918 Irish Parliamentary Party, he seems to have been outlived only by [[John Patrick Hayden]], who died a few months after him in 1954 and by [[Patrick Whitty]] and [[John Lymbrick Esmonde]] who were only MPs for a very short time during the First World War.\nHe is buried in [[Holywood]], [[Co Down]].\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Selected publications==\n* ''Parnell Vindicated:  the lifting of the veil'', London, Constable, 1931\n* ''The Strange Case of the Irish Land Purchase Annuities'', Dublin, M.

In [[1895 United Kingdom general election|1895 general election]], he stood at [[North Sligo (UK Parliament constituency)|North Sligo]], polling better but again far short of winning.<ref>''The Times'', Obituary, 22 February 1954, states that Harrison did not seek to stand for Parliament again after the end of his initial term in 1892.  This is a mistake as ''The Times'' itself reported his candidacies in 1892 and 1895.</ref> In 1895 Harrison married Maie Byrne, an American, with whom he had a son. He came to prominence briefly again in 1903 when, in spite of his lack of legal training, he successfully conducted his own case in a court action all the way to the [[British House of Lords|House of Lords]].\n\nOtherwise, however, he disappeared from public view until his war service with the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1684-1922)|Royal Irish Regiment]] when he served on the [[Western Front (WWI)|Western Front]] with distinction in the [[Kitchener's Army|New British Army]] formed for the [[First World War]], reaching the rank of Captain and being awarded the [[Military Cross|MC]]. He organised patrols in \"[[No man's land|No Man's Land]]\" so successfully that he was appointed special patrol officer to the [[16th (Irish) Division]]. He was invalided out and became a recruiting officer in Ireland. He was appointed an Officer of the [[Order of the British Empire]] in the [[1919 New Year Honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=31114 |supp=y |page=455|date= 8 January 1919}}</ref>\n\nHe then made a return to Irish politics, working with [[Horace Plunkett|Sir Horace Plunkett]] as Secretary of the [[Irish Dominion League]], an organisation campaigning for [[dominion status]] for Ireland within the [[British Empire]]. Harrison was a lifelong opponent of [[Partition of Ireland|Irish partition]]. He was Irish correspondent of ''The Economist'' from 1922 to 1927 and owner-editor of ''Irish Truth'' from 1924 to 1927.\n\nHarrison\u2019s two books defending Parnell were published in 1931 and 1938. They have had a major impact on Irish historiography, leading to a more favourable view of Parnell\u2019s role in the O\u2019Shea affair. [[F. S. L. Lyons]]<ref>(1977, p.324)</ref> commented that he \"did more than anyone else to uncover what seems to have been the true facts\" about the Parnell-O'Shea liaison. The second book, ''Parnell, Joseph Chamberlain and Mr Garvin'', was written in response to [[James Louis Garvin|J. L. Garvin]]'s biography of [[Joseph Chamberlain]], which had ignored Harrison\u2019s first book, ''Parnell Vindicated:  The Lifting of the Veil''.  Later, Harrison successfully repulsed an attempt in the official history of ''The Times'' to rehabilitate that newspaper\u2019s role in using forged letters to attack Parnell in the later 1880s. In 1952 he forced ''The Times'' to publish a four-page correction written by him as an appendix to the fourth volume of the history.\n\nDuring the difficult years of the [[Anglo-Irish Trade War]] over the land purchase annuities, [[John A. Costello#Declaration of the republic|declaration of the Republic]], [[Irish neutrality during World War II]], and departure from the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], Harrison worked to promote good relations between Britain and Ireland. He published various books and pamphlets on the issues in dispute and wrote numerous letters to ''The Times''. He also founded, with General Sir [[Hubert Gough]], the [[Commonwealth Irish Association]] in 1942. By the time of his death, he was the last survivor of the Irish Parliamentary Party led by Parnell, and as a member of the pre-1918 Irish Parliamentary Party, he seems to have been outlived only by [[John Patrick Hayden]], who died a few months after him in 1954 and by [[Patrick Whitty]] and [[John Lymbrick Esmonde]] who were only MPs for a very short time during the First World War.\nHe is buried in [[Holywood]], [[Co Down]].\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Selected publications==\n* ''Parnell Vindicated:  the lifting of the veil'', London, Constable, 1931\n* ''The Strange Case of the Irish Land Purchase Annuities'', Dublin, M.

George Curzon's mother was Blanche (1837\u20131875), the daughter of Joseph Pocklington Senhouse of Netherhall in Cumberland. He was born at [[Kedleston Hall]], built on the site where his family, who were of [[Normans|Norman]] ancestry, had lived since the 12th century. His mother, exhausted by childbirth, died when George was 16; her husband survived her by 41 years. Neither parent exerted a major influence on Curzon's life. Scarsdale was an austere and unindulgent father who believed in the long-held family tradition that landowners should stay on their land and not go \"roaming about all over the world\". He thus had little sympathy for those journeys across Asia between 1887 and 1895 which made his son one of the most traveled men who ever sat in a British cabinet. A more decisive presence in Curzon's childhood was that of his brutal, sadistic governess, [[Ellen Mary Paraman]], whose tyranny in the nursery stimulated his combative qualities and encouraged the obsessional side of his nature. Paraman used to beat him and periodically forced him to parade through the village wearing a conical hat bearing the words ''liar'', ''sneak'', and ''coward''.  Curzon later noted, \"No children well born and well-placed ever cried so much and so justly.\"<ref>Empire, Niall Ferguson</ref>\n[[File:George Curzon.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Curzon at Eton, 1870s]]\nHe was educated at [[Wixenford School]],<ref>Philip Holden, ''Autobiography and Decolonization: Modernity, Masculinity, and the Nation-state'' (2008), p. 46</ref> [[Eton College]],<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4309213.stm Eton, the Raj and modern India]; By Alastair Lawson; 9 March 2005; BBC News.</ref> and [[Balliol College, Oxford]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Curzon of Kedleston, George Nathaniel, 1st Baron |volume=7 |page=665}}</ref> At Eton, he was a favourite of [[Oscar Browning]], an over-intimate relationship that led to his tutor's dismissal.<ref>\"...

Subsequent performances in the Commons, often dealing with Ireland or reform of the House of Lords (which he supported), received similar verdicts. He was [[Under-Secretary of State for India]] in 1891\u201392 and [[Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]] in 1895\u201398.<ref name=\"Mosley\">{{cite book|last=Mosley|first=Leonard|title=''Curzon: The End of an Epoch''|url=https://archive.org/details/curzonendofepoch0000mosl|url-access=registration|year=1961|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Asian travels and writings==\nIn the meantime he had travelled around the world: [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Central Asia]] (1888\u201389), a long tour of [[Iran|Persia]] (September 1889 \u2013 January 1890), [[Rattanakosin Kingdom|Siam]], [[French Indochina]] and [[Korea]] (1892), and a daring foray into [[Afghanistan]] and the [[Pamirs]] (1894).  He published several books describing central and eastern Asia and related policy issues.<ref name=EB1911/> A bold and compulsive traveler, [[Orientalism|fascinated by oriental life]] and geography, he was awarded the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Patron's Gold Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] for his exploration of the source of the [[Amu Darya]] (Oxus). His journeys allowed him to study the problems of Asia and their implications for [[British India]], whilst reinforcing his pride in his nation and her imperial mission.\n\nCurzon believed Russia to be the most likely threat to [[India]], Britain's most valuable colony, from the 19th century through the early 20th century.<ref>Curzon, ''Russia in Central Asia'' (1967), p. 314.</ref> In 1879 Russia had begun construction of the [[Transcaspian Railroad]] along the [[Silk Road]], officially solely to enforce local control. The line starts from the city of Kzyzl Su (Krasnovodsk) (nowadays [[T\u00fcrkmenba\u015fy, Turkmenistan|Turkmenbashi]]) (on the [[Caspian Sea]]), travels southeast along the [[Karakum Desert]], through [[Ashgabat]], continues along the [[Kopet Dagh]] Mountains until it reaches [[Tejen]]. Curzon dedicated an entire chapter in his book ''Russia in Central Asia'' to discussing the perceived threat to British control of India.<ref>Curzon, ''Russia in Central Asia'' (1967), p. 272.</ref> This railroad connected Russia with the most wealthy and influential cities in Central Asia at the time, including the Persian province of [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]],<ref>[[Denis Wright]], \"Curzon and Persia,\" ''The Geographical Journal'' 153#3 (November 1987): 343.</ref> and would allow the rapid deployment of Russian supplies and troops into the area. Curzon also believed that the resulting greater economic interdependence between Russia and Central Asia would be damaging to British interests.<ref>Curzon, ''Russia in Central Asia'' p. 277.</ref>\n\n''Persia and the Persian Question'', written in 1892, has been considered Curzon's ''magnum opus'' and can be seen as a sequel to ''Russia in Central Asia.''<ref>Denis Wright, \"Curzon and Persia,\" ''The Geographical Journal'' 153#3 (November 1987):346.</ref> Curzon was commissioned by ''The Times'' to write several articles on the Persian political environment, but while there he decided to write a book on the country as whole. This two-volume work covers Persia's history and governmental structure, as well as graphics, maps and pictures (some taken by Curzon himself). Curzon was aided by General [[Albert Houtum-Schindler]] and the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (RGS), both of which helped him gain access to material to which as a foreigner he would not have been entitled to have access. General Schindler provided Curzon with information regarding Persia's geography and resources, as well as serving as an unofficial editor. <ref>Wright, \"Curzon and Persia,\" pp 346\u20137</ref>\n\nCurzon was appalled by his government's apathy towards Persia as a valuable defensive buffer to India from Russian encroachment.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brockway | first1 = Thomas P | year = 1941 | title = Britain and the Persian Bubble, 1888\u20131892 | doi = 10.1086/243919 | journal = The Journal of Modern History | volume = 13 | issue = 1| page = 46 }}</ref> Years later Curzon would lament that \"Persia has alternatively advanced and receded in the estimation of British statesmen, occupying now a position of extravagant prominence, anon one of unmerited obscurity.\"<ref>George N.

Initially, he had just married her for her money so he could save his estate but ended up nursing feelings for her. Mary had a long and nearly fatal illness near the end of summer 1904, from which she never really recovered. Falling ill again in July 1906, she died on the 18th of that month in her husband's arms, at the age of 36.<ref>[http://www.peterwestern.f9.co.uk/maximilia/pafg1237.htm Maximilian Genealogy Master Database, Mary Victoria LEITER, 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306052857/http://www.peterwestern.f9.co.uk/maximilia/pafg1237.htm |date=6 March 2008 }}</ref> It was the greatest personal loss of his life.\n\nShe was buried in the church at Kedleston, where Curzon designed his memorial for her, a Gothic chapel added to the north side of the nave. Although he was neither a devout nor a conventional churchman, Curzon retained a simple religious faith; in later years he sometimes said that he was not afraid of death because it would enable him to join Mary in heaven.\n\nThey had three daughters during a firm and happy marriage: [[Mary Curzon, 2nd Baroness Ravensdale|Mary Irene]], who inherited her father's [[Baron Ravensdale|Barony of Ravensdale]] and was created a [[life peer]] in her own right; [[Lady Cynthia Mosley|Cynthia]], who became the first wife of the fascist politician [[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley]]; and [[Alexandra Naldera Curzon|Alexandra Naldera]] (\"Baba\"), who married [[Fruity Metcalfe|Edward \"Fruity\" Metcalfe]], the best friend, best man and [[equerry]] of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]].  Mosley exercised a strange fascination for the Curzon women: Irene had a brief romance with him before either were married; Baba became his mistress; and Curzon's second wife, [[Grace Curzon, Marchioness Curzon of Kedleston|Grace]], had a long affair with him.\n\n== Viceroy of India (1899\u20131905) ==\n[[File:Curzon-Sanchi.jpg|252x252px|thumb|right|Curzon\u2014procession to [[Sanchi]] [[Stupa|Tope]], 28 November 1899.]]\n[[File:Lord Curzon Hunting 1901.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Curzon and [[Madho Rao Scindia]], [[Maharaja]] of [[Gwalior]], pose with [[Tiger hunting|hunted tigers]], 1901.]]\n[[File:Lord and Lady Curzon and staff on tour of Persian Gulf 1903.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Curzon and his wife and staff on tour of the Persian Gulf in 1903]]\nIn January 1899 he was appointed [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy of India]].<ref name=EB1911/> He was created a [[Peerage of Ireland|Peer of Ireland]] as '''Baron Curzon of Kedleston''', in the County of Derby,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27016 |date=21 October 1898 |page=6140 }}</ref> on his appointment. This peerage was created in the Peerage of Ireland (the last so created) so that he would be free, until his father's death, to re-enter the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on his return to Britain.\n\nReaching India shortly after the suppression of the frontier risings of 1897\u201398, he paid special attention to the independent tribes of the north-west frontier, inaugurated a new province called the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u201355)|North West Frontier Province]], and pursued a policy of forceful control mingled with conciliation. The only major armed outbreak on this frontier during the period of his administration was the [[Mahsud]]\u2013[[Wazir (tribe)|Waziri]] campaign of 1901.\n\nIn the context of the [[Great Game]] between the British and [[Russian Empire]]s for control of Central Asia, he held deep mistrust of Russian intentions. This led him to encourage British trade in [[Persia]], and he paid a visit to the [[Persian Gulf]] in 1903. Curzon argued for an exclusive British presence in the Gulf, a policy originally proposed by [[John Malcolm]]. The British government was already making agreements with local sheiks/tribal leaders along the Persian Gulf coast to this end. Curzon had convinced his government to establish Britain as the unofficial protector of Kuwait with the Anglo-Kuwaiti Agreement of 1899. The Lansdowne Declaration in 1903 stated that the British would counter any other European power's attempt to establish a military presence in the Gulf.<ref>[[M. E. Yapp]], \"British Perceptions of the Russian Threat to India,\" ''Modern Asian Studies'' 21#4 (1987):  655.</ref> Only four years later this position was abandoned and the Persian Gulf declared a neutral zone in the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907, prompted in part by the high economic cost of defending India from Russian advances.<ref>Yapp, pp 655, 664.</ref>\n\nAt the end of 1903, Curzon sent a [[British expedition to Tibet]] under [[Francis Younghusband]], ostensibly to forestall a Russian advance. After bloody conflicts with [[Tibet]]'s poorly armed defenders, the mission penetrated to [[Lhasa]], where a treaty was signed in September 1904. No Russian presence was found in Lhasa.\n\nDuring his tenure, Curzon undertook the restoration of the [[Taj Mahal]] and expressed satisfaction that he had done so.\n\nWithin India, Curzon appointed a number of commissions to inquire into education, irrigation, police and other branches of administration, on whose reports legislation was based during his second term of office as viceroy. Reappointed Governor-General in August 1904, he presided over the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|1905 partition of Bengal]], which roused such bitter opposition among the people of the province that it was later revoked (1911).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indhistory.com/first-partition-bengal.html|title=First Partition of Bengal|website=www.indhistory.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Indian Army ===\nCurzon also took an active interest in military matters. In 1901, he founded the Imperial Cadet Corps, or ICC. The ICC was a corps d'elite, designed to give Indian princes and aristocrats military training, after which a few would be given officer commissions in the Indian Army. But these commissions were \"special commissions\" which did not empower their holders to command any troops. Predictably, this was a major stumbling block to the ICC's success, as it caused much resentment among former cadets. Though the ICC closed in 1914, it was a crucial stage in the drive to Indianise the Indian Army's officer Corps, which was haltingly begun in 1917.\n\nMilitary organisation proved to be the final issue faced by Curzon in India. It often involved petty issues that had much to do with clashes of personality: Curzon once wrote on a document \"I rise from the perusal of these papers filled with the sense of the ineptitude of my military advisers\", and once wrote to the Commander-in-Chief in India, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]], advising him that signing himself \"Kitchener of Khartoum\" took up too much time and space, which Kitchener thought petty (Curzon simply signed himself \"Curzon\" as if he were a hereditary peer, although he later took to signing himself \"Curzon of Kedleston\").<ref>Reid 2006, p116</ref> A difference of opinion with Kitchener, regarding the status of the military member of the council in India (who controlled army supply and logistics, which Kitchener wanted under his own control), led to a controversy in which Curzon failed to obtain the support of the home government. He resigned in August 1905 and returned to England.\n\n=== Indian famine ===\n{{main article|Indian famine of 1899\u20131900}}\nA major [[Famine in India|famine]] coincided with Curzon's time as viceroy in which 1 to 4.5 million people died.<ref>Fagan, Brian (2009), Floods, Famines, and Emperors: El Nino and the Fate of Civilizations, Basic Books. p. 13</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Fieldhouse|1996|p=132}} Quote: \"In the later nineteenth century there was a series of disastrous crop failures in India leading not only to starvation but to epidemics.  Most were regional, but the death toll could be huge.  Thus, to take only some of the worst famines for which the death rate is known, some 800,000 died in the North West Provinces, Punjab, and Rajasthan in 1837\u201338; perhaps 2 million in the same region in 1860\u201361; nearly a million in different areas in 1866\u201367; 4.3 million in widely spread areas in 1876\u201378, an additional 1.2 million in the North West Provinces and Kashmir in 1877\u201378; and, worst of all, over 5 million in a famine that affected a large population of India in 1896\u201397.  In 1899\u20131900 more than a million were thought to have died, conditions being worse because of the shortage of food following the famines only two years earlier.  Thereafter the only major loss of life through famine was in 1943 under exceptional wartime conditions.(p. 132)\"</ref><ref>Davis, Mike. Late Victorian Holocausts. 1.

In ''Curzon'' he writes that 3.5 million were on famine relief, in ''Ruling Caste'' he writes it was over five million.</ref> But he also stated that \"any government which imperiled the financial position of India in the interests of prodigal philanthropy would be open to serious criticism; but any government which by indiscriminate alms-giving weakened the fibre and demoralized the self-reliance of the population, would be guilty of a public crime.\"<ref>Davis, Mike.

In deference to the wishes of the King and the advice of his doctors, Curzon did not stand in the general election of 1906 and thus found himself excluded from public life for the first time in twenty years. It was at this time, the nadir of his career, that he suffered the greatest personal loss of his life.\nMary died in 1906 and Curzon devoted himself to private matters, including establishing a new home. After the death of [[George Goschen, 1st Viscount Goschen|Lord Goschen]] in 1907, the post of Chancellor of Oxford University fell vacant. Curzon successfully became elected as [[University of Oxford#Chancellor of the University of Oxford|Chancellor of Oxford]] after he won by 1001 votes to 440 against Lord Rosebery.<ref>{{cite book|last1=The Rt. Hon. The Earl of Ronaldshay|title=The Life of Curszon Vol.3}}</ref> He proved to be quite an active Chancellor \u2013 \"[he] threw himself so energetically into the cause of university reform that critics complained he was ruling Oxford like an Indian province.\"<ref>Oxford DNB</ref>\n\n==House of Lords==\nIn 1908, Curzon was elected a [[representative peer]] for Ireland, and thus relinquished any idea of returning to the House of Commons.<ref name=EB1911/> In 1909\u20131910 he took an active part in opposing the Liberal government's<ref name=EB1911/> proposal to abolish the legislative veto of the House of Lords, and in 1911 was created '''Baron Ravensdale''', of Ravensdale in the County of Derby, with remainder (in default of heirs male) to his daughters, '''Viscount Scarsdale''', of Scarsdale in the County of Derby, with remainder (in default of heirs male) to the heirs male of his father, and '''Earl Curzon of Kedleston''', in the County of Derby, with the normal remainder, all in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=28547 |date=3 November 1911 |page=7951 }}</ref>\n\nHe became involved with saving [[Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire]], from destruction. This experience strengthened his resolve for heritage protection. He was one of the sponsors of the [[Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21587468 | title=The man who demolished Shakespeare's house| work=BBC News| date=2013-03-07| last1=Winterman| first1=Denise}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 May 1914, he spoke out against a bill in the House of Lords that would have permitted women who already had the right to vote in local elections the right to vote for members of Parliament.\n\n== First World War ==\n\nCurzon joined the Cabinet, as [[Lord Privy Seal]], when Asquith formed [[Asquith coalition ministry|his coalition]] in May 1915.\n\nLike other politicians (e.g. [[Austen Chamberlain|Chamberlain]], [[Arthur Balfour]]) Curzon favoured British Empire efforts in [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]], believing that the increase in British prestige would discourage a German-inspired Muslim revolt in India.<ref>Woodward, 1998, pp113, 118\u20139</ref>\n\nCurzon was a member of the Dardanelles Committee and told that body (October 1915) that the recent [[Macedonian front|Salonika]] expedition was \"quixotic chivalry\".<ref>Woodward, 1998, p.16</ref>\n\nEarly in 1916 Curzon visited Douglas Haig (newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of British forces in France) at his headquarters in France. Haig was impressed by Curzon's brains and decisiveness, considering that he had mellowed since his days as Viceroy (the then Major-General Haig had been Inspector-General of Cavalry, India, at the time) and had lost \"his old pompous ways\".<ref>Groot 1988, p.226\u20137</ref>\n\nCurzon served in [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]]'s small War Cabinet as [[Leader of the House of Lords]] from December 1916, and he also served on the War Policy Committee. With Allied victory over Germany far from certain, Curzon wrote a paper (12 May 1917) for the War Cabinet urging that Britain seize Palestine and possibly Syria.<ref>Woodward, 1998, pp.155\u20137</ref> However, like other members of the War Cabinet, Curzon supported further Western Front offensives lest, with Russian commitment to the war wavering, France and Italy be tempted to make a separate peace. At the War Policy Committee (3 October 1917) Curzon objected in vain to plans to redeploy two divisions to Palestine, with a view to advancing into Syria and knocking Turkey out of the war altogether. Curzon's commitment wavered somewhat as the losses of [[Battle of Passchendaele|Third Ypres]] mounted.<ref>Woodward, 1998, pp134, 159\u201361,</ref> In the summer of 1917 the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|CIGS]] [[William Robertson (British Army officer)|General Robertson]] sent Haig a biting description of the members of the War Cabinet, who he said were all frightened of Lloyd George; he described Curzon as \"a gasbag\".\n\nDuring the crisis of February 1918, Curzon was one of the few members of the government to support Robertson, threatening in vain to resign if he were removed.<ref>Woodward, 1998, p.200</ref>\n\nDespite his continued opposition to [[women's suffrage|votes for women]] (he had been co-president of the [[National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage]]), the House of Lords voted conclusively in its favour.\n\n== Second marriage (1917) ==\n[[File:Grace Elvina, Marchioness Curzon of Kedleston.jpg|thumb|Grace Elvina, second wife]]\nAfter a long affair with the romantic novelist [[Elinor Glyn]], Curzon married the former [[Grace Curzon, Marchioness Curzon of Kedleston|Grace Elvina Hinds]] in January 1917. She was the wealthy [[Alabama]]-born widow of Alfredo Huberto Duggan (died 1915), a first-generation [[Irish Argentinian]] appointed to the Argentine Legation in London in 1905. Elinor Glyn was staying with Curzon at the time of the engagement and read about it in the morning newspapers.\n\nGrace had three children from her first marriage, two sons, [[Alfred Duggan|Alfred]] and [[Hubert Duggan|Hubert]], and a daughter, Grace Lucille. Alfred and Hubert, as Curzon's step-sons, grew up within his influential circle. Curzon had three daughters from his first marriage, but he and Grace (despite fertility-related operations and several miscarriages) did not have any children together, which put a strain on their marriage. Letters written between them in the early 1920s imply that they still lived together, and remained devoted to each other. In 1923, Curzon was passed over for the office of Prime Minister partly on the advice of [[Arthur Balfour]], who joked that Curzon \"has lost the hope of glory but he still possesses the means of Grace\".\n\nIn 1917, Curzon bought [[Bodiam Castle]] in East Sussex, a 14th-century building that had been gutted during the [[English Civil War]]. He restored it extensively, then bequeathed it to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].<ref name=\"bodiam-c42\">[[Channel 4]] history microsites: [http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/C/castle/bod_main.html Bodiam Castle]</ref>\n\n== Foreign Secretary (1919\u201324) ==\n[[File:Curzon fronting Victoria Memorial.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Curzon in front of the Calcutta Victoria Memorial]]\n\n===Relations with Lloyd George===\nCurzon did not have [[David Lloyd George]]'s support. Curzon and Lloyd George had disliked one another since the [[Parliament Act 1911|1911 Parliament Crisis]]. The Prime Minister thought him overly pompous and self-important, and it was said that he used him as if he were using a Rolls-Royce to deliver a parcel to the station; Lloyd George said much later that Churchill treated his Ministers in a way that Lloyd George would never have treated his: \"They were all men of substance \u2014 well, except Curzon.\"<ref>Michael Foot: ''Aneurin Bevan''</ref> Multiple drafts of resignation letters written at this time were found upon Curzon's death. Despite their antagonism, the two were often in agreement on government policy.<ref>Johnson, Gaynor \"Preparing for Office: Lord Curzon as Acting Foreign Secretary, January- October 1919.\" Contemporary British History 18.3 (2004): 56.</ref> Lloyd George needed the wealth of knowledge Curzon possessed so was both his biggest critic and, simultaneously, his largest supporter. Likewise, Curzon was grateful for the leeway he was allowed by Lloyd George when it came to handling affairs in the Middle East.<ref>G.H. Bennett, \"Lloyd George, Curzon and the Control of British Foreign Policy 1919\u201322,\" ''Australian Journal of Politics & History'' 45#4 (1999): 479.</ref>\n\nOther cabinet ministers also respected his vast knowledge of Central Asia but disliked his arrogance and often blunt criticism. Believing that the Foreign Secretary should be non-partisan, he would objectively present all the information on a subject to the Cabinet, as if placing faith in his colleagues to reach the appropriate decision. Conversely, Curzon would take personally and respond aggressively to any criticism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = G.H. | year = 1999 | title = Lloyd George, Curzon and the Control of British Foreign Policy 1919\u201322 | url = | journal = Australian Journal of Politics & History | volume = 45 | issue = 4| page = 472 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8497.00076 }}</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested that Curzon's defensiveness reflected institutional insecurity by the Foreign Office as a whole.

Although during the subsequent [[Russo-Polish War]], Poland conquered ground in the east, after [[World War II]], Poland was shifted westwards, leaving the border between Poland and its eastern neighbours today approximately at the Curzon Line.<ref name=\"Sarah Meiklejohn Terry 1983 121\">{{cite book|author=Sarah Meiklejohn Terry|title=Poland's Place in Europe: General Sikorski and the Origin of the Oder-Neisse Line, 1939\u20131943|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zOL_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA121|year=1983|publisher=Princeton University Press|page=121|isbn=9781400857173}}</ref>\n\nCurzon was largely responsible for the Peace Day ceremonies on 19 July 1919. These included the plaster [[The Cenotaph|Cenotaph]], designed by the noted British architect [[Edwin Lutyens|Sir Edwin Lutyens]], for the Allied Victory parade in London.  It was so successful that it was reproduced in stone, and still stands.\n\nIn 1918, during World War I, as [[Mesopotamian campaign|Britain occupied Mesopotamia (modern Iraq)]], Curzon tried to convince the Indian government to reconsider his scheme for Persia (modern Iran) to be a buffer against Russian advances.<ref>Yapp, p. 654.</ref> British and Indian troops were in Persia protecting the oilfields at [[Abadan]] and watching the Afghan frontier \u2013 Curzon believed that British economic and military aid, sent via India, could prop up the Persian government and make her a British client state. However, the agreement of August 1919 was never ratified and the British government rejected the plan as Russia had the geographical advantage and the defensive benefits would not justify the high economic cost.<ref>Yapp, p. 653.</ref>\n\nSmall British forces had twice occupied [[Baku]] on the Caspian in 1918, while an entire British division had occupied [[Batumi|Batum]] on the Black Sea, supervising German and Turkish withdrawal. Against Curzon's wishes, but on the advice of Sir [[George Milne]], the commander on the spot, the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|CIGS]] [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Henry Wilson]], who wanted to concentrate troops in Britain, Ireland, India, and Egypt,<ref>Jeffery 2006, pp. 251\u2013252.</ref> and of Churchill (Secretary of State for War), the British withdrew from Baku (the small British naval presence was also withdrawn from the Caspian Sea), at the end of August 1919 leaving only 3 battalions at Batum.\n\nIn January 1920 Curzon insisted that British troops remain in Batum, against the wishes of Wilson and the Prime Minister. In February, while Curzon was on holiday, Wilson persuaded the Cabinet to allow withdrawal, but Curzon had the decision reversed on his return, although to Curzon's fury (he thought it \"abuse of authority\") Wilson gave Milne permission to withdraw if he deemed it necessary. At Cabinet on 5 May 1920 Curzon \"by a long-winded jaw\" (in Wilson's description) argued for a stay in Batum. After a British garrison at [[Bandar-e Anzali|Enzeli]] (on the Persian Caspian coast) was taken prisoner by Bolshevik forces on 19 May 1920, Lloyd George finally insisted on a withdrawal from Batum early in June 1920. For the rest of 1920 Curzon, supported by [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Milner]] (Colonial Secretary), argued that Britain should retain control of Persia. When Wilson asked (15 July 1920) to pull troops out of Persia to put down the rebellion in Mesopotamia and Ireland, Lloyd George blocked the move, saying that Curzon \"would not stand it\". In the end, financial retrenchment forced a British withdrawal from Persia in the spring of 1921.<ref>Jeffery 2006, pp. 233\u2013234, 247\u2013251.</ref>\n\nCurzon helped in several Middle Eastern problems: he helped to negotiate Egyptian independence ([[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|granted in 1922]]) and the division of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], despite the strong disagreement he held with the policy of his predecessor Arthur Balfour,<ref name=UnregardedProphet>{{cite journal|authorlink=Sir David Gilmour, 4th Baronet|first=David|last=Gilmour|title=The Unregarded Prophet: Lord Curzon and the Palestine Question|journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|volume=25|issue=3|pages=60\u201368|date=1996|jstor=2538259|doi=10.2307/2538259}}</ref> and helped create the [[Emirate of Transjordan]] for Faisal's brother, which may also have delayed the problems there. According to [[Sir David Gilmour, 4th Baronet|Sir David Gilmour]], Curzon \"was the only senior figure in the British government at the time who foresaw that its policy would lead to decades of Arab\u2013Jewish hostility\".<ref name=UnregardedProphet/>\n\nDuring the [[Irish War of Independence]], but before the introduction of martial law in December 1920, Curzon suggested the \"Indian\" solution of blockading villages and imposing collective fines for attacks on the police and army.<ref>Jeffery 2006, pp. 266\u2013267.</ref>\n\nIn 1921 Curzon was created '''Earl of Kedleston''', in the County of Derby, and '''Marquess Curzon of Kedleston'''.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=32376 |date=1 July 1921 |page=5243 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1922, he was the chief negotiator for the Allies of the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], which officially ended the war with the [[Ottoman Empire]] and defined the borders of [[Turkey]].\n\n===Under Bonar Law===\nUnlike many leading Conservative members of Lloyd George's Coalition Cabinet, Curzon ceased to support Lloyd George over the [[Chanak Crisis]] and had just resigned when Conservative backbenchers voted at [[Carlton Club meeting, 19 October 1922|the Carlton Club meeting]] to end the Coalition in October 1922. Curzon was thus able to remain Foreign Secretary when [[Bonar Law]] formed a purely Conservative ministry.\n\nIn 1922\u201323 Curzon had to negotiate with France after French troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied the Ruhr]] to enforce the payment of German reparations; he described the French Prime Minister (and former President) [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]] as a \"horrid little man\". Curzon had expansive ambitions and was not much happier with Bonar Law, whose foreign policy was based on \"retrenchment and withdrawal\", than he had been with Lloyd George. However he provided invaluable insight into the Middle East and was instrumental in shaping British foreign policy in that region.<ref>Bennett, \"Lloyd George, Curzon and the Control of British Foreign Policy 1919\u201322,\" p. 477.</ref>\n\n==Passed over for Prime Minister, 1923==\n[[File:George Nathaniel Curzon, Marquess Curzon of Kedleston by John Cooke.jpg|thumb|200px|Lord Curzon of Kedleston by [[John Singer Sargent]], 1914. [[Royal Geographical Society]]]]\nOn [[Bonar Law]]'s retirement as Prime Minister in May 1923, Curzon was passed over for the job in favour of [[Stanley Baldwin]], despite having written Bonar Law a lengthy letter earlier in the year complaining of rumours that he was to retire in Baldwin's favour, and listing the reasons he should have the top job.\n\nThis decision was taken on the private advice of leading members of the party including former Prime Minister Arthur Balfour. Balfour advised the monarch that in a democratic age it was inappropriate for the Prime Minister to be a member of the [[House of Lords]], especially when the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], which had few peers, had become the main opposition party in the Commons. In private Balfour admitted that he was prejudiced against Curzon, whose character was objectionable to some. [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] shared this prejudice. A letter purporting to detail the opinions of Bonar Law but actually written by Baldwin sympathisers was delivered to the King's Private Secretary [[Arthur John Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham|Lord Stamfordham]], though it is unclear how much impact this had in the final outcome.\n\nCurzon, summoned by Stamfordham, traveled to London by train assuming he was to be appointed Prime Minister, and is said to have burst into tears when told the truth. He later described Baldwin as \"a man of the utmost insignificance\", although he served under Baldwin and proposed him for the leadership of the Conservative Party.\n\nCurzon remained Foreign Secretary under Baldwin until the government fell in January 1924. When Baldwin formed a new government in November 1924 he appointed Curzon [[Lord President of the Council]].\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Curzon-last-pic.jpg|thumb|277x277px|The last photograph taken of Curzon on his way to attend a cabinet meeting (1925)]]\nIn March 1925 Curzon suffered a severe haemorrhage of the bladder. Surgery was unsuccessful and he died in London on 20 March 1925 at the age of 66. His coffin, made from the same tree at Kedleston that had encased his first wife, Mary, was taken to [[Westminster Abbey]] and from there to his ancestral home in [[Derbyshire]], where he was interred beside Mary in the family vault at [[All Saints Church, Kedleston|All Saints Church]] on 26 March. In his will, proven on 22 July, Curzon bequeathed his estate to his wife and his brother Francis; his estate was valued for probate at \u00a3343,279 10s. 4d. (roughly equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|343279|1925|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}.<ref name=\"probate\">{{cite web |url=https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk/Calendar?surname=Curzon&yearOfDeath=1925&page=3#calendar |title=Curzon of Kedleston |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=1925 |website=probatesearchservice.gov |publisher=UK Government |access-date=7 August 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUpon his death the Barony, Earldom and Marquessate of Curzon of Kedleston and the Earldom of Kedleston became extinct, whilst the Viscountcy and Barony of Scarsdale were inherited by a nephew. The Barony of Ravensdale was inherited by his eldest daughter [[Irene Curzon, 2nd Baroness Ravensdale|Mary]] and is today held by his second daughter [[Lady Cynthia Mosley|Cynthia's]] great-grandson, Daniel Nicholas Mosley, 4th Baron Ravensdale.\n\nThere is now a [[blue plaque]] on the house in London where Curzon lived and died, No. 1 [[Carlton House Terrace]], [[City of Westminster|Westminster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/6258|title=George Nathaniel Curzon blue plaque|publisher=openplaques.org|accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Titles ==\nOn his appointment as [[Viceroy of India]] in 1898, he was created [[Baron Curzon of Kedleston]], in the County of Derby. This title was created in the [[Peerage of Ireland]] to enable him to potentially return to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], as Irish peers did not have an automatic right to sit in the [[House of Lords]]. His was the last title to be created in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1908, he was elected a representative of the Irish peerage in the British House of Lords, from which it followed that he would be a member of the House of Lords until death; indeed, his representative peerage would continue even if (as proved to be the case) he later received a United Kingdom peerage entitling him to a seat in the House of Lords in his own right.\n\nIn 1911 he was created [[Earl Curzon of Kedleston]], [[Viscount Scarsdale]], and [[Baron Ravensdale]]. All of these titles were in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]].\n\nUpon his father's death in 1916, he also became 5th [[Baron Scarsdale]], in the [[Peerage of Great Britain]]. The title had been created in 1761.\n\nIn the [[1921 Birthday Honours]], he was created [[Marquess Curzon of Kedleston]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=32346 |date=4 June 1921 |page=4529 |supp=y}}</ref> The title became extinct upon his death in 1925, as he was survived by three daughters and no sons.<ref name=\"timesobit\">{{cite news |title=Lord Curzon: A Great Career |work=[[The Times]] |publisher=The Times Digital Archive |page=7 |date=21 March 1925 }}</ref>\n\n== Assessment ==\nFew statesmen have experienced such changes in fortune in both their public and their personal lives. \n[[Sir David Gilmour, 4th Baronet]], concludes: \n<blockquote>Curzon's career was an almost unparallelled blend of triumph and disappointment. Although he was the last and in many ways the greatest of Victorian viceroys, his term of office ended in resignation, empty of recognition and devoid of reward.... he was unable to assert himself fully as foreign secretary until the last weeks of Lloyd George's premiership. Finally, after he had restored his reputation at Lausanne, his ultimate ambition was thwarted by George V.<ref>David Gilmour, \"Curzon, George Nathaniel, Marquess Curzon of Kedleston (1859\u20131925)\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32680, accessed 30 Sept 2014] {{DOI|10.1093/ref:odnb/32680}}</ref></blockquote>\n\t\nCritics generally agreed that Curzon never reached the heights that his youthful talents had seemed destined to reach. This sense of opportunities missed was summed up by [[Winston Churchill]] in his book ''Great Contemporaries'' (1937):<blockquote>The morning had been golden; the noontide was bronze; and the evening lead. But all were polished till it shone after its fashion.</blockquote>\n\nChurchill also wrote there was certainly something lacking in Curzon:<blockquote>it was certainly not information nor application, nor power of speech nor attractiveness of manner and appearance. Everything was in his equipment. You could unpack his knapsack and take an inventory item by item. Nothing on the list was missing, yet somehow or other the total was incomplete.<ref>Churchill, ''Great Contemporaries'', Chapter on Curzon</ref></blockquote>\n\nHis Cabinet colleague [[David Lindsay, 27th Earl of Crawford|The Earl of Crawford]] provided a withering personal judgment in his diary; \"I never knew a man less loved by his colleagues and more hated by his subordinates, never a man so bereft of conscience, of charity or of gratitude. On the other hand the combination of power, of industry, and of ambition with a mean personality is almost without parallel. I never attended a funeral ceremony at which the congregation was so dry-eyed!\"{{sfn|Lindsay|p=507}}\n\nThe first leader of independent India, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], paid Curzon a surprising tribute, referring to the fact that Curzon as Viceroy exhibited real love of Indian culture and ordered a restoration project for several historic monuments, including the [[Taj Mahal]]:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/1481257/Reviled-Curzon-name-wins-new-respect-in-India.html|title=Reviled-Curzon-name-wins-new-respect-in-India|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=29 August 2017|date=2005-01-15|last1=Roy|first1=Amit}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>After every other Viceroy has been forgotten, Curzon will be remembered because he restored all that was beautiful in India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/When-Curzon-rescued-Ahmedabads-icon/articleshow/13015110.cms|title=When Curzon rescued Ahmedabad's icon|publisher=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|accessdate=5 July 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Legacy==\nBy [[Remainder (law)|special remainders]], although he had no son, two of Curzon's peerages survive to the present day. His barony of Ravensdale  went first to his eldest daughter, [[Irene Curzon, 2nd Baroness Ravensdale]], and then to his grandson [[Nicholas Mosley]], both of whom sat in the [[House of Lords]], while his [[Viscount Scarsdale]] title went to a nephew. His great-great-grandson [[Daniel Mosley, 4th Baron Ravensdale]], is a current member of the House of Lords, having been elected as a representative hereditary peer.\n\n[[Curzon Hall]], the home of the faculty of science at the [[University of Dhaka]], is named after him. Lord Curzon himself inaugurated the building in 1904.\n\n[[Curzon Gate, Bardhaman|Curzon Gate]], a ceremonial gate, was erected by Maharaja Bijay Chand Mahatab in the heart of Burdwan town and was renamed to commemorate Lord Curzon's visit to the town in 1904, which was renamed as Bijay Toran after the independence of India in 1947.\n\n[[Curzon Road]], the road connecting India Gate, the memorial dedicated to the Indian fallen during the Great War of 1914\u201318, and Connaught Place, in New Delhi was named after him. It has since been renamed [[Kasturba Gandhi]] Marg. The apartment buildings on the same road are still named after him.\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{wikisource author}}\n\n=== George Nathaniel Curzon's writings ===\n* Curzon, ''Russia in Central Asia in 1889 and the Anglo-Russian Question'' (1889) Frank Cass & Co.

This was partly because Curzon was a member of the [[House of Lords]], and partly because [[J. C. C.

George Curzon's mother was Blanche (1837\u20131875), the daughter of Joseph Pocklington Senhouse of Netherhall in Cumberland. He was born at [[Kedleston Hall]], built on the site where his family, who were of [[Normans|Norman]] ancestry, had lived since the 12th century. His mother, exhausted by childbirth, died when George was 16; her husband survived her by 41 years. Neither parent exerted a major influence on Curzon's life. Scarsdale was an austere and unindulgent father who believed in the long-held family tradition that landowners should stay on their land and not go \"roaming about all over the world\". He thus had little sympathy for those journeys across Asia between 1887 and 1895 which made his son one of the most traveled men who ever sat in a British cabinet. A more decisive presence in Curzon's childhood was that of his brutal, sadistic governess, [[Ellen Mary Paraman]], whose tyranny in the nursery stimulated his combative qualities and encouraged the obsessional side of his nature. Paraman used to beat him and periodically forced him to parade through the village wearing a conical hat bearing the words ''liar'', ''sneak'', and ''coward''.  Curzon later noted, \"No children well born and well-placed ever cried so much and so justly.\"<ref>Empire, Niall Ferguson</ref>\n[[File:George Curzon.jpg|thumb|175px|left|Curzon at Eton, 1870s]]\nHe was educated at [[Wixenford School]],<ref>Philip Holden, ''Autobiography and Decolonization: Modernity, Masculinity, and the Nation-state'' (2008), p. 46</ref> [[Eton College]],<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4309213.stm Eton, the Raj and modern India]; By Alastair Lawson; 9 March 2005; BBC News.</ref> and [[Balliol College, Oxford]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Curzon of Kedleston, George Nathaniel, 1st Baron |volume=7 |page=665}}</ref> At Eton, he was a favourite of [[Oscar Browning]], an over-intimate relationship that led to his tutor's dismissal.<ref>\"...

In 1883, Curzon received the most prestigious fellowship at the university, a Prize Fellowship at [[All Souls College]].

He published several books describing central and eastern Asia and related policy issues.<ref name=EB1911/> A bold and compulsive traveler, [[Orientalism|fascinated by oriental life]] and geography, he was awarded the [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Patron's Gold Medal]] of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] for his exploration of the source of the [[Amu Darya]] (Oxus). His journeys allowed him to study the problems of Asia and their implications for [[British India]], whilst reinforcing his pride in his nation and her imperial mission.\n\nCurzon believed Russia to be the most likely threat to [[India]], Britain's most valuable colony, from the 19th century through the early 20th century.<ref>Curzon, ''Russia in Central Asia'' (1967), p. 314.</ref> In 1879 Russia had begun construction of the [[Transcaspian Railroad]] along the [[Silk Road]], officially solely to enforce local control. The line starts from the city of Kzyzl Su (Krasnovodsk) (nowadays [[T\u00fcrkmenba\u015fy, Turkmenistan|Turkmenbashi]]) (on the [[Caspian Sea]]), travels southeast along the [[Karakum Desert]], through [[Ashgabat]], continues along the [[Kopet Dagh]] Mountains until it reaches [[Tejen]]. Curzon dedicated an entire chapter in his book ''Russia in Central Asia'' to discussing the perceived threat to British control of India.<ref>Curzon, ''Russia in Central Asia'' (1967), p. 272.</ref> This railroad connected Russia with the most wealthy and influential cities in Central Asia at the time, including the Persian province of [[Khorasan Province|Khorasan]],<ref>[[Denis Wright]], \"Curzon and Persia,\" ''The Geographical Journal'' 153#3 (November 1987): 343.</ref> and would allow the rapid deployment of Russian supplies and troops into the area. Curzon also believed that the resulting greater economic interdependence between Russia and Central Asia would be damaging to British interests.<ref>Curzon, ''Russia in Central Asia'' p. 277.</ref>\n\n''Persia and the Persian Question'', written in 1892, has been considered Curzon's ''magnum opus'' and can be seen as a sequel to ''Russia in Central Asia.''<ref>Denis Wright, \"Curzon and Persia,\" ''The Geographical Journal'' 153#3 (November 1987):346.</ref> Curzon was commissioned by ''The Times'' to write several articles on the Persian political environment, but while there he decided to write a book on the country as whole. This two-volume work covers Persia's history and governmental structure, as well as graphics, maps and pictures (some taken by Curzon himself). Curzon was aided by General [[Albert Houtum-Schindler]] and the [[Royal Geographical Society]] (RGS), both of which helped him gain access to material to which as a foreigner he would not have been entitled to have access. General Schindler provided Curzon with information regarding Persia's geography and resources, as well as serving as an unofficial editor. <ref>Wright, \"Curzon and Persia,\" pp 346\u20137</ref>\n\nCurzon was appalled by his government's apathy towards Persia as a valuable defensive buffer to India from Russian encroachment.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Brockway | first1 = Thomas P | year = 1941 | title = Britain and the Persian Bubble, 1888\u20131892 | doi = 10.1086/243919 | journal = The Journal of Modern History | volume = 13 | issue = 1| page = 46 }}</ref> Years later Curzon would lament that \"Persia has alternatively advanced and receded in the estimation of British statesmen, occupying now a position of extravagant prominence, anon one of unmerited obscurity.\"<ref>George N.

Initially, he had just married her for her money so he could save his estate but ended up nursing feelings for her. Mary had a long and nearly fatal illness near the end of summer 1904, from which she never really recovered. Falling ill again in July 1906, she died on the 18th of that month in her husband's arms, at the age of 36.<ref>[http://www.peterwestern.f9.co.uk/maximilia/pafg1237.htm Maximilian Genealogy Master Database, Mary Victoria LEITER, 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306052857/http://www.peterwestern.f9.co.uk/maximilia/pafg1237.htm |date=6 March 2008 }}</ref> It was the greatest personal loss of his life.\n\nShe was buried in the church at Kedleston, where Curzon designed his memorial for her, a Gothic chapel added to the north side of the nave. Although he was neither a devout nor a conventional churchman, Curzon retained a simple religious faith; in later years he sometimes said that he was not afraid of death because it would enable him to join Mary in heaven.\n\nThey had three daughters during a firm and happy marriage: [[Mary Curzon, 2nd Baroness Ravensdale|Mary Irene]], who inherited her father's [[Baron Ravensdale|Barony of Ravensdale]] and was created a [[life peer]] in her own right; [[Lady Cynthia Mosley|Cynthia]], who became the first wife of the fascist politician [[Oswald Mosley|Sir Oswald Mosley]]; and [[Alexandra Naldera Curzon|Alexandra Naldera]] (\"Baba\"), who married [[Fruity Metcalfe|Edward \"Fruity\" Metcalfe]], the best friend, best man and [[equerry]] of [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]].  Mosley exercised a strange fascination for the Curzon women: Irene had a brief romance with him before either were married; Baba became his mistress; and Curzon's second wife, [[Grace Curzon, Marchioness Curzon of Kedleston|Grace]], had a long affair with him.\n\n== Viceroy of India (1899\u20131905) ==\n[[File:Curzon-Sanchi.jpg|252x252px|thumb|right|Curzon\u2014procession to [[Sanchi]] [[Stupa|Tope]], 28 November 1899.]]\n[[File:Lord Curzon Hunting 1901.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Curzon and [[Madho Rao Scindia]], [[Maharaja]] of [[Gwalior]], pose with [[Tiger hunting|hunted tigers]], 1901.]]\n[[File:Lord and Lady Curzon and staff on tour of Persian Gulf 1903.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Curzon and his wife and staff on tour of the Persian Gulf in 1903]]\nIn January 1899 he was appointed [[Governor-General of India|Viceroy of India]].<ref name=EB1911/> He was created a [[Peerage of Ireland|Peer of Ireland]] as '''Baron Curzon of Kedleston''', in the County of Derby,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27016 |date=21 October 1898 |page=6140 }}</ref> on his appointment. This peerage was created in the Peerage of Ireland (the last so created) so that he would be free, until his father's death, to re-enter the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on his return to Britain.\n\nReaching India shortly after the suppression of the frontier risings of 1897\u201398, he paid special attention to the independent tribes of the north-west frontier, inaugurated a new province called the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u201355)|North West Frontier Province]], and pursued a policy of forceful control mingled with conciliation. The only major armed outbreak on this frontier during the period of his administration was the [[Mahsud]]\u2013[[Wazir (tribe)|Waziri]] campaign of 1901.\n\nIn the context of the [[Great Game]] between the British and [[Russian Empire]]s for control of Central Asia, he held deep mistrust of Russian intentions. This led him to encourage British trade in [[Persia]], and he paid a visit to the [[Persian Gulf]] in 1903. Curzon argued for an exclusive British presence in the Gulf, a policy originally proposed by [[John Malcolm]]. The British government was already making agreements with local sheiks/tribal leaders along the Persian Gulf coast to this end. Curzon had convinced his government to establish Britain as the unofficial protector of Kuwait with the Anglo-Kuwaiti Agreement of 1899. The Lansdowne Declaration in 1903 stated that the British would counter any other European power's attempt to establish a military presence in the Gulf.<ref>[[M. E. Yapp]], \"British Perceptions of the Russian Threat to India,\" ''Modern Asian Studies'' 21#4 (1987):  655.</ref> Only four years later this position was abandoned and the Persian Gulf declared a neutral zone in the Anglo-Russian Agreement of 1907, prompted in part by the high economic cost of defending India from Russian advances.<ref>Yapp, pp 655, 664.</ref>\n\nAt the end of 1903, Curzon sent a [[British expedition to Tibet]] under [[Francis Younghusband]], ostensibly to forestall a Russian advance. After bloody conflicts with [[Tibet]]'s poorly armed defenders, the mission penetrated to [[Lhasa]], where a treaty was signed in September 1904. No Russian presence was found in Lhasa.\n\nDuring his tenure, Curzon undertook the restoration of the [[Taj Mahal]] and expressed satisfaction that he had done so.\n\nWithin India, Curzon appointed a number of commissions to inquire into education, irrigation, police and other branches of administration, on whose reports legislation was based during his second term of office as viceroy. Reappointed Governor-General in August 1904, he presided over the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|1905 partition of Bengal]], which roused such bitter opposition among the people of the province that it was later revoked (1911).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.indhistory.com/first-partition-bengal.html|title=First Partition of Bengal|website=www.indhistory.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Indian Army ===\nCurzon also took an active interest in military matters. In 1901, he founded the Imperial Cadet Corps, or ICC. The ICC was a corps d'elite, designed to give Indian princes and aristocrats military training, after which a few would be given officer commissions in the Indian Army. But these commissions were \"special commissions\" which did not empower their holders to command any troops. Predictably, this was a major stumbling block to the ICC's success, as it caused much resentment among former cadets. Though the ICC closed in 1914, it was a crucial stage in the drive to Indianise the Indian Army's officer Corps, which was haltingly begun in 1917.\n\nMilitary organisation proved to be the final issue faced by Curzon in India. It often involved petty issues that had much to do with clashes of personality: Curzon once wrote on a document \"I rise from the perusal of these papers filled with the sense of the ineptitude of my military advisers\", and once wrote to the Commander-in-Chief in India, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Kitchener]], advising him that signing himself \"Kitchener of Khartoum\" took up too much time and space, which Kitchener thought petty (Curzon simply signed himself \"Curzon\" as if he were a hereditary peer, although he later took to signing himself \"Curzon of Kedleston\").<ref>Reid 2006, p116</ref> A difference of opinion with Kitchener, regarding the status of the military member of the council in India (who controlled army supply and logistics, which Kitchener wanted under his own control), led to a controversy in which Curzon failed to obtain the support of the home government. He resigned in August 1905 and returned to England.\n\n=== Indian famine ===\n{{main article|Indian famine of 1899\u20131900}}\nA major [[Famine in India|famine]] coincided with Curzon's time as viceroy in which 1 to 4.5 million people died.<ref>Fagan, Brian (2009), Floods, Famines, and Emperors: El Nino and the Fate of Civilizations, Basic Books. p. 13</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Fieldhouse|1996|p=132}} Quote: \"In the later nineteenth century there was a series of disastrous crop failures in India leading not only to starvation but to epidemics.  Most were regional, but the death toll could be huge.  Thus, to take only some of the worst famines for which the death rate is known, some 800,000 died in the North West Provinces, Punjab, and Rajasthan in 1837\u201338; perhaps 2 million in the same region in 1860\u201361; nearly a million in different areas in 1866\u201367; 4.3 million in widely spread areas in 1876\u201378, an additional 1.2 million in the North West Provinces and Kashmir in 1877\u201378; and, worst of all, over 5 million in a famine that affected a large population of India in 1896\u201397.  In 1899\u20131900 more than a million were thought to have died, conditions being worse because of the shortage of food following the famines only two years earlier.  Thereafter the only major loss of life through famine was in 1943 under exceptional wartime conditions.(p. 132)\"</ref><ref>Davis, Mike. Late Victorian Holocausts. 1.

In ''Curzon'' he writes that 3.5 million were on famine relief, in ''Ruling Caste'' he writes it was over five million.</ref> But he also stated that \"any government which imperiled the financial position of India in the interests of prodigal philanthropy would be open to serious criticism; but any government which by indiscriminate alms-giving weakened the fibre and demoralized the self-reliance of the population, would be guilty of a public crime.\"<ref>Davis, Mike.

In deference to the wishes of the King and the advice of his doctors, Curzon did not stand in the general election of 1906 and thus found himself excluded from public life for the first time in twenty years. It was at this time, the nadir of his career, that he suffered the greatest personal loss of his life.\nMary died in 1906 and Curzon devoted himself to private matters, including establishing a new home. After the death of [[George Goschen, 1st Viscount Goschen|Lord Goschen]] in 1907, the post of Chancellor of Oxford University fell vacant. Curzon successfully became elected as [[University of Oxford#Chancellor of the University of Oxford|Chancellor of Oxford]] after he won by 1001 votes to 440 against Lord Rosebery.<ref>{{cite book|last1=The Rt. Hon. The Earl of Ronaldshay|title=The Life of Curszon Vol.3}}</ref> He proved to be quite an active Chancellor \u2013 \"[he] threw himself so energetically into the cause of university reform that critics complained he was ruling Oxford like an Indian province.\"<ref>Oxford DNB</ref>\n\n==House of Lords==\nIn 1908, Curzon was elected a [[representative peer]] for Ireland, and thus relinquished any idea of returning to the House of Commons.<ref name=EB1911/> In 1909\u20131910 he took an active part in opposing the Liberal government's<ref name=EB1911/> proposal to abolish the legislative veto of the House of Lords, and in 1911 was created '''Baron Ravensdale''', of Ravensdale in the County of Derby, with remainder (in default of heirs male) to his daughters, '''Viscount Scarsdale''', of Scarsdale in the County of Derby, with remainder (in default of heirs male) to the heirs male of his father, and '''Earl Curzon of Kedleston''', in the County of Derby, with the normal remainder, all in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=28547 |date=3 November 1911 |page=7951 }}</ref>\n\nHe became involved with saving [[Tattershall Castle, Lincolnshire]], from destruction. This experience strengthened his resolve for heritage protection. He was one of the sponsors of the [[Ancient Monuments Consolidation and Amendment Act 1913]].<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21587468 | title=The man who demolished Shakespeare's house| work=BBC News| date=2013-03-07| last1=Winterman| first1=Denise}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 May 1914, he spoke out against a bill in the House of Lords that would have permitted women who already had the right to vote in local elections the right to vote for members of Parliament.\n\n== First World War ==\n\nCurzon joined the Cabinet, as [[Lord Privy Seal]], when Asquith formed [[Asquith coalition ministry|his coalition]] in May 1915.\n\nLike other politicians (e.g. [[Austen Chamberlain|Chamberlain]], [[Arthur Balfour]]) Curzon favoured British Empire efforts in [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]], believing that the increase in British prestige would discourage a German-inspired Muslim revolt in India.<ref>Woodward, 1998, pp113, 118\u20139</ref>\n\nCurzon was a member of the Dardanelles Committee and told that body (October 1915) that the recent [[Macedonian front|Salonika]] expedition was \"quixotic chivalry\".<ref>Woodward, 1998, p.16</ref>\n\nEarly in 1916 Curzon visited Douglas Haig (newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of British forces in France) at his headquarters in France. Haig was impressed by Curzon's brains and decisiveness, considering that he had mellowed since his days as Viceroy (the then Major-General Haig had been Inspector-General of Cavalry, India, at the time) and had lost \"his old pompous ways\".<ref>Groot 1988, p.226\u20137</ref>\n\nCurzon served in [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]]'s small War Cabinet as [[Leader of the House of Lords]] from December 1916, and he also served on the War Policy Committee. With Allied victory over Germany far from certain, Curzon wrote a paper (12 May 1917) for the War Cabinet urging that Britain seize Palestine and possibly Syria.<ref>Woodward, 1998, pp.155\u20137</ref> However, like other members of the War Cabinet, Curzon supported further Western Front offensives lest, with Russian commitment to the war wavering, France and Italy be tempted to make a separate peace. At the War Policy Committee (3 October 1917) Curzon objected in vain to plans to redeploy two divisions to Palestine, with a view to advancing into Syria and knocking Turkey out of the war altogether. Curzon's commitment wavered somewhat as the losses of [[Battle of Passchendaele|Third Ypres]] mounted.<ref>Woodward, 1998, pp134, 159\u201361,</ref> In the summer of 1917 the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|CIGS]] [[William Robertson (British Army officer)|General Robertson]] sent Haig a biting description of the members of the War Cabinet, who he said were all frightened of Lloyd George; he described Curzon as \"a gasbag\".\n\nDuring the crisis of February 1918, Curzon was one of the few members of the government to support Robertson, threatening in vain to resign if he were removed.<ref>Woodward, 1998, p.200</ref>\n\nDespite his continued opposition to [[women's suffrage|votes for women]] (he had been co-president of the [[National League for Opposing Woman Suffrage]]), the House of Lords voted conclusively in its favour.\n\n== Second marriage (1917) ==\n[[File:Grace Elvina, Marchioness Curzon of Kedleston.jpg|thumb|Grace Elvina, second wife]]\nAfter a long affair with the romantic novelist [[Elinor Glyn]], Curzon married the former [[Grace Curzon, Marchioness Curzon of Kedleston|Grace Elvina Hinds]] in January 1917. She was the wealthy [[Alabama]]-born widow of Alfredo Huberto Duggan (died 1915), a first-generation [[Irish Argentinian]] appointed to the Argentine Legation in London in 1905. Elinor Glyn was staying with Curzon at the time of the engagement and read about it in the morning newspapers.\n\nGrace had three children from her first marriage, two sons, [[Alfred Duggan|Alfred]] and [[Hubert Duggan|Hubert]], and a daughter, Grace Lucille. Alfred and Hubert, as Curzon's step-sons, grew up within his influential circle. Curzon had three daughters from his first marriage, but he and Grace (despite fertility-related operations and several miscarriages) did not have any children together, which put a strain on their marriage. Letters written between them in the early 1920s imply that they still lived together, and remained devoted to each other. In 1923, Curzon was passed over for the office of Prime Minister partly on the advice of [[Arthur Balfour]], who joked that Curzon \"has lost the hope of glory but he still possesses the means of Grace\".\n\nIn 1917, Curzon bought [[Bodiam Castle]] in East Sussex, a 14th-century building that had been gutted during the [[English Civil War]]. He restored it extensively, then bequeathed it to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].<ref name=\"bodiam-c42\">[[Channel 4]] history microsites: [http://www.channel4.com/history/microsites/C/castle/bod_main.html Bodiam Castle]</ref>\n\n== Foreign Secretary (1919\u201324) ==\n[[File:Curzon fronting Victoria Memorial.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Statue of Curzon in front of the Calcutta Victoria Memorial]]\n\n===Relations with Lloyd George===\nCurzon did not have [[David Lloyd George]]'s support. Curzon and Lloyd George had disliked one another since the [[Parliament Act 1911|1911 Parliament Crisis]]. The Prime Minister thought him overly pompous and self-important, and it was said that he used him as if he were using a Rolls-Royce to deliver a parcel to the station; Lloyd George said much later that Churchill treated his Ministers in a way that Lloyd George would never have treated his: \"They were all men of substance \u2014 well, except Curzon.\"<ref>Michael Foot: ''Aneurin Bevan''</ref> Multiple drafts of resignation letters written at this time were found upon Curzon's death. Despite their antagonism, the two were often in agreement on government policy.<ref>Johnson, Gaynor \"Preparing for Office: Lord Curzon as Acting Foreign Secretary, January- October 1919.\" Contemporary British History 18.3 (2004): 56.</ref> Lloyd George needed the wealth of knowledge Curzon possessed so was both his biggest critic and, simultaneously, his largest supporter. Likewise, Curzon was grateful for the leeway he was allowed by Lloyd George when it came to handling affairs in the Middle East.<ref>G.H. Bennett, \"Lloyd George, Curzon and the Control of British Foreign Policy 1919\u201322,\" ''Australian Journal of Politics & History'' 45#4 (1999): 479.</ref>\n\nOther cabinet ministers also respected his vast knowledge of Central Asia but disliked his arrogance and often blunt criticism. Believing that the Foreign Secretary should be non-partisan, he would objectively present all the information on a subject to the Cabinet, as if placing faith in his colleagues to reach the appropriate decision. Conversely, Curzon would take personally and respond aggressively to any criticism.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bennett | first1 = G.H. | year = 1999 | title = Lloyd George, Curzon and the Control of British Foreign Policy 1919\u201322 | url = | journal = Australian Journal of Politics & History | volume = 45 | issue = 4| page = 472 | doi = 10.1111/1467-8497.00076 }}</ref>\n\nIt has been suggested that Curzon's defensiveness reflected institutional insecurity by the Foreign Office as a whole.

These included the plaster [[The Cenotaph|Cenotaph]], designed by the noted British architect [[Edwin Lutyens|Sir Edwin Lutyens]], for the Allied Victory parade in London.  It was so successful that it was reproduced in stone, and still stands.\n\nIn 1918, during World War I, as [[Mesopotamian campaign|Britain occupied Mesopotamia (modern Iraq)]], Curzon tried to convince the Indian government to reconsider his scheme for Persia (modern Iran) to be a buffer against Russian advances.<ref>Yapp, p. 654.</ref> British and Indian troops were in Persia protecting the oilfields at [[Abadan]] and watching the Afghan frontier \u2013 Curzon believed that British economic and military aid, sent via India, could prop up the Persian government and make her a British client state. However, the agreement of August 1919 was never ratified and the British government rejected the plan as Russia had the geographical advantage and the defensive benefits would not justify the high economic cost.<ref>Yapp, p. 653.</ref>\n\nSmall British forces had twice occupied [[Baku]] on the Caspian in 1918, while an entire British division had occupied [[Batumi|Batum]] on the Black Sea, supervising German and Turkish withdrawal. Against Curzon's wishes, but on the advice of Sir [[George Milne]], the commander on the spot, the [[Chief of the Imperial General Staff|CIGS]] [[Henry Hughes Wilson|Henry Wilson]], who wanted to concentrate troops in Britain, Ireland, India, and Egypt,<ref>Jeffery 2006, pp. 251\u2013252.</ref> and of Churchill (Secretary of State for War), the British withdrew from Baku (the small British naval presence was also withdrawn from the Caspian Sea), at the end of August 1919 leaving only 3 battalions at Batum.\n\nIn January 1920 Curzon insisted that British troops remain in Batum, against the wishes of Wilson and the Prime Minister. In February, while Curzon was on holiday, Wilson persuaded the Cabinet to allow withdrawal, but Curzon had the decision reversed on his return, although to Curzon's fury (he thought it \"abuse of authority\") Wilson gave Milne permission to withdraw if he deemed it necessary. At Cabinet on 5 May 1920 Curzon \"by a long-winded jaw\" (in Wilson's description) argued for a stay in Batum. After a British garrison at [[Bandar-e Anzali|Enzeli]] (on the Persian Caspian coast) was taken prisoner by Bolshevik forces on 19 May 1920, Lloyd George finally insisted on a withdrawal from Batum early in June 1920. For the rest of 1920 Curzon, supported by [[Alfred Milner, 1st Viscount Milner|Milner]] (Colonial Secretary), argued that Britain should retain control of Persia. When Wilson asked (15 July 1920) to pull troops out of Persia to put down the rebellion in Mesopotamia and Ireland, Lloyd George blocked the move, saying that Curzon \"would not stand it\". In the end, financial retrenchment forced a British withdrawal from Persia in the spring of 1921.<ref>Jeffery 2006, pp. 233\u2013234, 247\u2013251.</ref>\n\nCurzon helped in several Middle Eastern problems: he helped to negotiate Egyptian independence ([[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|granted in 1922]]) and the division of the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], despite the strong disagreement he held with the policy of his predecessor Arthur Balfour,<ref name=UnregardedProphet>{{cite journal|authorlink=Sir David Gilmour, 4th Baronet|first=David|last=Gilmour|title=The Unregarded Prophet: Lord Curzon and the Palestine Question|journal=Journal of Palestine Studies|volume=25|issue=3|pages=60\u201368|date=1996|jstor=2538259|doi=10.2307/2538259}}</ref> and helped create the [[Emirate of Transjordan]] for Faisal's brother, which may also have delayed the problems there.

Curzon was thus able to remain Foreign Secretary when [[Bonar Law]] formed a purely Conservative ministry.\n\nIn 1922\u201323 Curzon had to negotiate with France after French troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied the Ruhr]] to enforce the payment of German reparations; he described the French Prime Minister (and former President) [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]] as a \"horrid little man\". Curzon had expansive ambitions and was not much happier with Bonar Law, whose foreign policy was based on \"retrenchment and withdrawal\", than he had been with Lloyd George. However he provided invaluable insight into the Middle East and was instrumental in shaping British foreign policy in that region.<ref>Bennett, \"Lloyd George, Curzon and the Control of British Foreign Policy 1919\u201322,\" p. 477.</ref>\n\n==Passed over for Prime Minister, 1923==\n[[File:George Nathaniel Curzon, Marquess Curzon of Kedleston by John Cooke.jpg|thumb|200px|Lord Curzon of Kedleston by [[John Singer Sargent]], 1914. [[Royal Geographical Society]]]]\nOn [[Bonar Law]]'s retirement as Prime Minister in May 1923, Curzon was passed over for the job in favour of [[Stanley Baldwin]], despite having written Bonar Law a lengthy letter earlier in the year complaining of rumours that he was to retire in Baldwin's favour, and listing the reasons he should have the top job.\n\nThis decision was taken on the private advice of leading members of the party including former Prime Minister Arthur Balfour. Balfour advised the monarch that in a democratic age it was inappropriate for the Prime Minister to be a member of the [[House of Lords]], especially when the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], which had few peers, had become the main opposition party in the Commons. In private Balfour admitted that he was prejudiced against Curzon, whose character was objectionable to some. [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] shared this prejudice. A letter purporting to detail the opinions of Bonar Law but actually written by Baldwin sympathisers was delivered to the King's Private Secretary [[Arthur John Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham|Lord Stamfordham]], though it is unclear how much impact this had in the final outcome.\n\nCurzon, summoned by Stamfordham, traveled to London by train assuming he was to be appointed Prime Minister, and is said to have burst into tears when told the truth. He later described Baldwin as \"a man of the utmost insignificance\", although he served under Baldwin and proposed him for the leadership of the Conservative Party.\n\nCurzon remained Foreign Secretary under Baldwin until the government fell in January 1924. When Baldwin formed a new government in November 1924 he appointed Curzon [[Lord President of the Council]].\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Curzon-last-pic.jpg|thumb|277x277px|The last photograph taken of Curzon on his way to attend a cabinet meeting (1925)]]\nIn March 1925 Curzon suffered a severe haemorrhage of the bladder. Surgery was unsuccessful and he died in London on 20 March 1925 at the age of 66. His coffin, made from the same tree at Kedleston that had encased his first wife, Mary, was taken to [[Westminster Abbey]] and from there to his ancestral home in [[Derbyshire]], where he was interred beside Mary in the family vault at [[All Saints Church, Kedleston|All Saints Church]] on 26 March. In his will, proven on 22 July, Curzon bequeathed his estate to his wife and his brother Francis; his estate was valued for probate at \u00a3343,279 10s. 4d. (roughly equivalent to \u00a3{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|343279|1925|r=0}}}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}){{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}.<ref name=\"probate\">{{cite web |url=https://probatesearch.service.gov.uk/Calendar?surname=Curzon&yearOfDeath=1925&page=3#calendar |title=Curzon of Kedleston |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=1925 |website=probatesearchservice.gov |publisher=UK Government |access-date=7 August 2019 }}</ref>\n\nUpon his death the Barony, Earldom and Marquessate of Curzon of Kedleston and the Earldom of Kedleston became extinct, whilst the Viscountcy and Barony of Scarsdale were inherited by a nephew. The Barony of Ravensdale was inherited by his eldest daughter [[Irene Curzon, 2nd Baroness Ravensdale|Mary]] and is today held by his second daughter [[Lady Cynthia Mosley|Cynthia's]] great-grandson, Daniel Nicholas Mosley, 4th Baron Ravensdale.\n\nThere is now a [[blue plaque]] on the house in London where Curzon lived and died, No. 1 [[Carlton House Terrace]], [[City of Westminster|Westminster]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://openplaques.org/plaques/6258|title=George Nathaniel Curzon blue plaque|publisher=openplaques.org|accessdate=13 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n== Titles ==\nOn his appointment as [[Viceroy of India]] in 1898, he was created [[Baron Curzon of Kedleston]], in the County of Derby. This title was created in the [[Peerage of Ireland]] to enable him to potentially return to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], as Irish peers did not have an automatic right to sit in the [[House of Lords]]. His was the last title to be created in the Peerage of Ireland. In 1908, he was elected a representative of the Irish peerage in the British House of Lords, from which it followed that he would be a member of the House of Lords until death; indeed, his representative peerage would continue even if (as proved to be the case) he later received a United Kingdom peerage entitling him to a seat in the House of Lords in his own right.\n\nIn 1911 he was created [[Earl Curzon of Kedleston]], [[Viscount Scarsdale]], and [[Baron Ravensdale]]. All of these titles were in the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom]].\n\nUpon his father's death in 1916, he also became 5th [[Baron Scarsdale]], in the [[Peerage of Great Britain]]. The title had been created in 1761.\n\nIn the [[1921 Birthday Honours]], he was created [[Marquess Curzon of Kedleston]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=32346 |date=4 June 1921 |page=4529 |supp=y}}</ref> The title became extinct upon his death in 1925, as he was survived by three daughters and no sons.<ref name=\"timesobit\">{{cite news |title=Lord Curzon: A Great Career |work=[[The Times]] |publisher=The Times Digital Archive |page=7 |date=21 March 1925 }}</ref>\n\n== Assessment ==\nFew statesmen have experienced such changes in fortune in both their public and their personal lives. \n[[Sir David Gilmour, 4th Baronet]], concludes: \n<blockquote>Curzon's career was an almost unparallelled blend of triumph and disappointment. Although he was the last and in many ways the greatest of Victorian viceroys, his term of office ended in resignation, empty of recognition and devoid of reward.... he was unable to assert himself fully as foreign secretary until the last weeks of Lloyd George's premiership. Finally, after he had restored his reputation at Lausanne, his ultimate ambition was thwarted by George V.<ref>David Gilmour, \"Curzon, George Nathaniel, Marquess Curzon of Kedleston (1859\u20131925)\" ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, Jan 2011 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/32680, accessed 30 Sept 2014] {{DOI|10.1093/ref:odnb/32680}}</ref></blockquote>\n\t\nCritics generally agreed that Curzon never reached the heights that his youthful talents had seemed destined to reach. This sense of opportunities missed was summed up by [[Winston Churchill]] in his book ''Great Contemporaries'' (1937):<blockquote>The morning had been golden; the noontide was bronze; and the evening lead. But all were polished till it shone after its fashion.</blockquote>\n\nChurchill also wrote there was certainly something lacking in Curzon:<blockquote>it was certainly not information nor application, nor power of speech nor attractiveness of manner and appearance. Everything was in his equipment. You could unpack his knapsack and take an inventory item by item. Nothing on the list was missing, yet somehow or other the total was incomplete.<ref>Churchill, ''Great Contemporaries'', Chapter on Curzon</ref></blockquote>\n\nHis Cabinet colleague [[David Lindsay, 27th Earl of Crawford|The Earl of Crawford]] provided a withering personal judgment in his diary; \"I never knew a man less loved by his colleagues and more hated by his subordinates, never a man so bereft of conscience, of charity or of gratitude. On the other hand the combination of power, of industry, and of ambition with a mean personality is almost without parallel. I never attended a funeral ceremony at which the congregation was so dry-eyed!\"{{sfn|Lindsay|p=507}}\n\nThe first leader of independent India, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], paid Curzon a surprising tribute, referring to the fact that Curzon as Viceroy exhibited real love of Indian culture and ordered a restoration project for several historic monuments, including the [[Taj Mahal]]:<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/1481257/Reviled-Curzon-name-wins-new-respect-in-India.html|title=Reviled-Curzon-name-wins-new-respect-in-India|publisher=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=29 August 2017|date=2005-01-15|last1=Roy|first1=Amit}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>After every other Viceroy has been forgotten, Curzon will be remembered because he restored all that was beautiful in India.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ahmedabad/When-Curzon-rescued-Ahmedabads-icon/articleshow/13015110.cms|title=When Curzon rescued Ahmedabad's icon|publisher=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|accessdate=5 July 2017}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Legacy==\nBy [[Remainder (law)|special remainders]], although he had no son, two of Curzon\u2019s peerages survive to the present day. His barony of Ravensdale  went first to his eldest daughter, [[Irene Curzon, 2nd Baroness Ravensdale]], and then to his grandson [[Nicholas Mosley]], both of whom sat in the [[House of Lords]], while his [[Viscount Scarsdale]] title went to a nephew. His great-great-grandson [[Daniel Mosley, 4th Baron Ravensdale]], is a current member of the House of Lords, having been elected as a representative hereditary peer.\n\n[[Curzon Hall]], the home of the faculty of science at the [[University of Dhaka]], is named after him. Lord Curzon himself inaugurated the building in 1904.\n\n[[Curzon Gate, Bardhaman|Curzon Gate]], a ceremonial gate, was erected by Maharaja Bijay Chand Mahatab in the heart of Burdwan town and was renamed to commemorate Lord Curzon's visit to the town in 1904, which was renamed as Bijay Toran after the independence of India in 1947.\n\n[[Curzon Road]], the road connecting India Gate, the memorial dedicated to the Indian fallen during the Great War of 1914\u201318, and Connaught Place, in New Delhi was named after him. It has since been renamed [[Kasturba Gandhi]] Marg. The apartment buildings on the same road are still named after him.\n\n== Notes ==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{wikisource author}}\n\n=== George Nathaniel Curzon's writings ===\n* Curzon, ''Russia in Central Asia in 1889 and the Anglo-Russian Question'' (1889) Frank Cass & Co.

He was uncle to [[Kathleen Clarke]], wife of [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]], executed for his part in the [[Easter Rising|1916 Rising]] who was a leading member of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood|IRB]], and her brother [[Ned Daly]] who was also executed in 1916.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Daly was born in [[Limerick]] city on 18 October 1845. His father worked in James Harvey & Son's Timber Yard. At 16 John joined his father working as a [[lath]] splitter. At 18 he was sworn in as a member of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]], also known as the Fenians, and became fully involved in Republican activities. When he was refused absolution in confession because he admitted to being a Fenian, he decided that from then on his loyalty would no longer be to \"faith and Fatherland\" but to \"God and Fatherland.\"<ref name=\"Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Gr\u00edofa pg. 2\">Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Gr\u00edofa pg. 2</ref>\n\nOn 22 November 1866 Daly and his brother Edward were arrested at their family home having been betrayed by an informer, for running a munitions factory in the Pennywell district close to their home. He was released on bail in February 1867 toughened and more dedicated by the experience.<ref name=\"Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Gr\u00edofa pg. 2\"/>\n\n==1867 Rising==\nOn 5 March 1867 the ill-prepared [[Fenian Rising]] took place. John Daly took charge of the Limerick detachment of the IRB. Limerick was one of the few areas were the Fenians were able to make some show of force, however weak. Through lack of numbers they failed to make a significant impact on the vastly superior forces arrayed against them. Moving out of the city, Daly moved his men into the country and joined up with other Fenians in an attack on the [[Irish Constabulary]] barracks at [[Kilmallock]]. The attack was repelled and Daly dispersed his men.<ref name=\"Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Gr\u00edofa pg. 3\">Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Gr\u00edofa pg. 3</ref>\n\nAfter this Daly had to flee the country by stowing away first on a boat the ''Hollywood'', to England, and from London then on board the ''Cornelius Grenfel'' to the United States of America.<ref name=\"Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Gr\u00edofa pg. 3\"/><ref>D. J. Hickey & J. E. Doherty pg. 104</ref>\n\n==America==\nLife in America for working class immigrants was particularly tough and his first job on leaving the ship was digging a cellar. He then obtained work in a white lead factory and worked for a while as a mason's help before getting a reasonably good job as a brakeman on a tram system. Daly was to recall these experiences in his ''Recollections of Fenians and Fenianism''.<ref name=\"Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Gr\u00edofa pg. 3\"/>\n\n==Amnesty Association==\nIn 1869 Daly returned to Ireland and took up his old job in the timber yard, and also his Republican activities. He began to help reorganise the IRB and took part in a number of agitations to keep the IRB agenda in the public view. He became a leading voice in the [[Amnesty Association]] to help in the release of those Fenians still in jail.<ref>Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Gr\u00edofa pg. 3\u20134</ref><ref>Owen McGee, pg. 41\u201342</ref>\n\nIn November 1869 a major tenants' right meeting took place in the city. The IRB objected to the meeting because the issue of the prisoners was not on the agenda.  In what came to be known as \"The Battle of the Markets\" the IRB charged the platform and succeeded in dismantling it. Though the organisers of the meeting attempted to hold some form of gathering, Daly and the IRB refused to relent. It was Daly's opinion that \"it was one of the greatest moral victories ever achieved\". The issue of the political prisoners was to keep Daly occupied for much of the 1870s. In 1876 Daly was again arrested for disturbing another home rule gathering, though on being brought before the court he was acquitted.<ref>Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Gr\u00edofa pg. 4</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Land War]] Daly was a member of the Supreme Council of the IRB and became organiser for Connacht and Ulster.\n\n==Arrest==\nIn the summer of 1883, Daly moved to [[Birmingham]], England, and settled in the home of [[James Egan (Fenian)|James Egan]], an old friend from Limerick and a generally inactive IRB man. E.G. Jenkinson, head of Special Branch, was informed that John Daly was on his way to Britain from America; Daly had been asked by the Supreme Council to deliver the graveside oration at the funeral of [[Charles Kickham|Charles J. Kickham]] while in the United States. When Daly arrived, a plain-clothes detective was assigned to follow him at all times. As a result of this, Special Branch were alerted to the importance of [[John Torley]] in Glasgow, Robert Johnston<ref>Robert Johnston was the father of [[Ethna Carbery]] Irish writer and poet (''cite'', M. Ryan, pg.64)</ref> in Belfast and [[Mark F. Ryan|Mark Ryan]] in London of the IRB.<ref>Owen McGee, pg. 119</ref>\n\nJenkinson used [[Agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]] in his attempts to convict Republicans. One such recruit was a publican and local IRB man named Dan O'Neill. Both Jenkinson and a Major [[Nicholas Gosselin]] persuaded O'Neill to betray Daly. O'Neill then ask Daly to deliver sealed cases to some associates in London, and on 11 April Daly was arrested as he was about to board the train for London, and explosives were found in the case he was carrying. The police then raided the home of James Egan where explosives were \"allegedly found buried\" in Egan's garden in addition to some documents.<ref>Owen McGee, pg. 121</ref>\n\nIn Chatham prison he became friends with [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]], who would later marry his niece [[Kathleen Clarke|Kathleen]] and who was a leader of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. While in prison he claimed that he was being poisoned with [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]] which caused an investigation by a commission of inquiry, 1890; it was admitted by prison officials as an error by a warder.<ref>Commons Papers index.

See also ''That Irishman'', Jane Stanford, 2011, pps 180,181.</ref> A series of articles in the ''Daily Chronicle'' in 1894 analysed prison methods. Daly gave an interview to the ''Chronicle'' which appeared 12 September 1896.\n\nThe head of the Birmingham police later made a deathbed confession that Daly had been \"convicted on perjured evidence\".\n\n==Released==\nDaly was unopposed elected as a member of parliament (MP) for [[Limerick City (UK Parliament constituency)|Limerick City]] at the [[1895 United Kingdom general election|general election in July 1895]], as a member of the [[Charles Stewart Parnell|Parnellite]] [[Irish National League]].

He was uncle to [[Kathleen Clarke]], wife of [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]], executed for his part in the [[Easter Rising|1916 Rising]] who was a leading member of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood|IRB]], and her brother [[Ned Daly]] who was also executed in 1916.\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Daly was born in [[Limerick]] city on 18 October 1845. His father worked in James Harvey & Son's Timber Yard. At 16 John joined his father working as a [[lath]] splitter. At 18 he was sworn in as a member of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]], also known as the Fenians, and became fully involved in Republican activities. When he was refused absolution in confession because he admitted to being a Fenian, he decided that from then on his loyalty would no longer be to \"faith and Fatherland\" but to \"God and Fatherland.\"<ref name=\"Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Gr\u00edofa pg. 2\">Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Gr\u00edofa pg. 2</ref>\n\nOn 22 November 1866 Daly and his brother Edward were arrested at their family home having been betrayed by an informer, for running a munitions factory in the Pennywell district close to their home. He was released on bail in February 1867 toughened and more dedicated by the experience.<ref name=\"Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Gr\u00edofa pg. 2\"/>\n\n==1867 Rising==\nOn 5 March 1867 the ill-prepared [[Fenian Rising]] took place. John Daly took charge of the Limerick detachment of the IRB. Limerick was one of the few areas were the Fenians were able to make some show of force, however weak. Through lack of numbers they failed to make a significant impact on the vastly superior forces arrayed against them. Moving out of the city, Daly moved his men into the country and joined up with other Fenians in an attack on the [[Irish Constabulary]] barracks at [[Kilmallock]]. The attack was repelled and Daly dispersed his men.<ref name=\"Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Gr\u00edofa pg. 3\">Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Gr\u00edofa pg. 3</ref>\n\nAfter this Daly had to flee the country by stowing away first on a boat the ''Hollywood'', to England, and from London then on board the ''Cornelius Grenfel'' to the United States of America.<ref name=\"Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Gr\u00edofa pg. 3\"/><ref>D. J. Hickey & J. E. Doherty pg. 104</ref>\n\n==America==\nLife in America for working class immigrants was particularly tough and his first job on leaving the ship was digging a cellar. He then obtained work in a white lead factory and worked for a while as a mason's help before getting a reasonably good job as a brakeman on a tram system. Daly was to recall these experiences in his ''Recollections of Fenians and Fenianism''.<ref name=\"Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Gr\u00edofa pg. 3\"/>\n\n==Amnesty Association==\nIn 1869 Daly returned to Ireland and took up his old job in the timber yard, and also his Republican activities. He began to help reorganise the IRB and took part in a number of agitations to keep the IRB agenda in the public view. He became a leading voice in the [[Amnesty Association]] to help in the release of those Fenians still in jail.<ref>Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Gr\u00edofa pg. 3\u20134</ref><ref>Owen McGee, pg. 41\u201342</ref>\n\nIn November 1869 a major tenants' right meeting took place in the city. The IRB objected to the meeting because the issue of the prisoners was not on the agenda.  In what came to be known as \"The Battle of the Markets\" the IRB charged the platform and succeeded in dismantling it. Though the organisers of the meeting attempted to hold some form of gathering, Daly and the IRB refused to relent. It was Daly's opinion that \"it was one of the greatest moral victories ever achieved\". The issue of the political prisoners was to keep Daly occupied for much of the 1870s. In 1876 Daly was again arrested for disturbing another home rule gathering, though on being brought before the court he was acquitted.<ref>Ciar\u00e1n \u00d3 Gr\u00edofa pg. 4</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Land War]] Daly was a member of the Supreme Council of the IRB and became organiser for Connacht and Ulster.\n\n==Arrest==\nIn the summer of 1883, Daly moved to [[Birmingham]], England, and settled in the home of [[James Egan (Fenian)|James Egan]], an old friend from Limerick and a generally inactive IRB man. E.G. Jenkinson, head of Special Branch, was informed that John Daly was on his way to Britain from America; Daly had been asked by the Supreme Council to deliver the graveside oration at the funeral of [[Charles Kickham|Charles J. Kickham]] while in the United States. When Daly arrived, a plain-clothes detective was assigned to follow him at all times. As a result of this, Special Branch were alerted to the importance of [[John Torley]] in Glasgow, Robert Johnston<ref>Robert Johnston was the father of [[Ethna Carbery]] Irish writer and poet (''cite'', M. Ryan, pg.64)</ref> in Belfast and [[Mark F. Ryan|Mark Ryan]] in London of the IRB.<ref>Owen McGee, pg. 119</ref>\n\nJenkinson used [[Agent provocateur|agents provocateurs]] in his attempts to convict Republicans. One such recruit was a publican and local IRB man named Dan O'Neill. Both Jenkinson and a Major [[Nicholas Gosselin]] persuaded O'Neill to betray Daly. O'Neill then ask Daly to deliver sealed cases to some associates in London, and on 11 April Daly was arrested as he was about to board the train for London, and explosives were found in the case he was carrying. The police then raided the home of James Egan where explosives were \"allegedly found buried\" in Egan's garden in addition to some documents.<ref>Owen McGee, pg. 121</ref>\n\nIn Chatham prison he became friends with [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]], who would later marry his niece [[Kathleen Clarke|Kathleen]] and who was a leader of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]. While in prison he claimed that he was being poisoned with [[Atropa belladonna|belladonna]] which caused an investigation by a commission of inquiry, 1890; it was admitted by prison officials as an error by a warder.<ref>Commons Papers index. Chatham Prison (Treatment of Felony Prisoners), Report of the Visitors, ...1890, p.xxx, vii, 629. See also ''That Irishman'', Jane Stanford, 2011, pps 180,181.</ref> A series of articles in the ''Daily Chronicle'' in 1894 analysed prison methods. Daly gave an interview to the ''Chronicle'' which appeared 12 September 1896.\n\nThe head of the Birmingham police later made a deathbed confession that Daly had been \"convicted on perjured evidence\".\n\n==Released==\nDaly was unopposed elected as a member of parliament (MP) for [[Limerick City (UK Parliament constituency)|Limerick City]] at the [[1895 United Kingdom general election|general election in July 1895]], as a member of the [[Charles Stewart Parnell|Parnellite]] [[Irish National League]].
