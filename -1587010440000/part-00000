The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote. It was also the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes ([[Andrew Jackson]]) did not become President, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a [[corrupt bargain]].\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Kitt's response to the dossier was to say \"I don't understand what this is about.

In both those shows performing the show-stopping theatrical anthem \"[[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|I'm Still Here]]\". Kitt returned to New York City in a triumphant turn in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] spectacle ''[[Timbuktu!]]'' (a version of the perennial ''[[Kismet (musical)|Kismet]]'', set in Africa) in 1978. In the musical, one song gives a \"recipe\" for ''mahoun'', a preparation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], in which her sultry purring rendition of the refrain \"constantly stirring with a long wooden spoon\" was distinctive. She was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical]] for her performance. In the late 1990s, she appeared as the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] in the North American national touring company of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1987 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. In 2000, Kitt again returned to Broadway in the short-lived run of [[Michael John LaChiusa]]'s ''[[The Wild Party (LaChiusa musical)|The Wild Party]]''.

One of her more unusual roles was as [[Kaa]] in a 1994 [[BBC Radio]] adaptation of ''[[The Jungle Book]]''. Kitt also lent her distinctive voice to [[Yzma]] in ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'' (for which she won her first [[Annie Award]]) and reprised her role in ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'' and ''[[The Emperor's New School]]'', for which she won two [[Emmy Award]]s and, in 2007&ndash;08, two more [[Annie Awards]] for Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production.

Kitt found new audiences in nightclubs across the UK and the United States, including a whole new generation of gay male fans, and she responded by frequently giving benefit performances in support of [[HIV/AIDS]] organizations. Her 1989 follow-up hit \"Cha-Cha Heels\" (featuring [[Bronski Beat]]), which was originally intended to be recorded by [[Divine (performer)|Divine]], received a positive response from UK dance clubs, reaching No.&nbsp;32 in the charts in that country. In 1988, Kitt replaced [[Dolores Gray]] in the West End production of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Follies]]'' as Carlotta, receiving standing ovations every night for her rendition of \"[[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|I'm Still Here]]\" at the beginning of act 2. She went on to perform her own one-woman show at The [[Shaftesbury Theatre]] to sold-out houses for three weeks in early 1989 after ''Follies''.\n\n====1990s====\nKitt appeared with Jimmy James and [[George Burns]] at a fundraiser in 1990 produced by Scott Sherman, agent from the Atlantic Entertainment Group.

In November 1996, she appeared in an episode of ''[[Celebrity Jeopardy|Celebrity Jeopardy!]]''.  She also did a series of commercials for [[Old Navy]].\n\n====2000s====\nKitt was the spokesperson for [[MAC Cosmetics]]' Smoke Signals collection in August 2007.

Kitt supported the groups' efforts to clean up streets and establish recreation areas in an effort to keep them out of trouble by testifying with them before the House General Subcommittee on Education of the [[Committee on Education and Labor]]. In her testimony, in May 1967, Kitt stated that the Rebels' \"achievements and accomplishments should certainly make the adult 'do-gooders' realize that these young men and women have performed in 1 short year \u2013 with limited finances \u2013 that which was not achieved by the same people who might object to turning over some of the duties of planning, rehabilitation, and prevention of juvenile delinquents and juvenile delinquency to those who understand it and are living it\".

The doctor told us she will leave very quickly and her body will just start to shut down. But when she left, she left the world with a bang, she left it how she lived it. She screamed her way out of here, literally. I truly believe her survival instincts were so part of her DNA that she was not going to go quietly or willingly.

I was the love of her life, so the last part of her life we didn't have to have these heart to heart talks. She started to see people that weren't there.

Ten years later, she made a successful return to Broadway in the 1978 original production of the musical ''[[Timbuktu!]]'', for which she received the first of her two [[Tony Award]] nominations. Her second was for the 2000 original production of the musical ''[[The Wild Party (LaChiusa musical)|The Wild Party]]''.

It is said that Kitt's career in the United States was ended following her comments about the Vietnam War, after which she was branded \"a sadistic [[nymphomaniac]]\" by the [[CIA]].<ref name=Luck /> Her government-led [[blacklisting]] was enshrined in a false and defamatory CIA dossier about Kitt discovered by [[Seymour Hersh]] in 1975. Hersh published an article about the dossier in ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref name=Hersh>[https://www.nytimes.com/1975/01/03/archives/cia-in-68-gave-secret-service-a-report-containing-gossip-about.html \"CIA gave Secret Service a Report containing Gossip about Eartha Kitt after a White House Incident\"] by [[Seymour Hersh]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 3, 1975</ref> The dossier contained comments about Kitt's sex life and family history, along with negative opinions of her that were held by former colleagues. Kitt's response to the dossier was to say \"I don't understand what this is about. I think it's disgusting.\"<ref name=Hersh />\n\n===Broadway===\nIn the 1970s, Kitt appeared on television several times on [[BBC]]'s long-running variety show ''[[The Good Old Days (UK TV series)|The Good Old Days]]'', and in 1987 took over from fellow American [[Dolores Gray]] in the London [[West End theatre|West End]] production of Stephen Sondheim's ''[[Follies]]'' and returned at the end of that run to star in a one-woman-show at the same [[Shaftesbury Theatre]], both to tremendous acclaim. In both those shows performing the show-stopping theatrical anthem \"[[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|I'm Still Here]]\". Kitt returned to New York City in a triumphant turn in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] spectacle ''[[Timbuktu!]]'' (a version of the perennial ''[[Kismet (musical)|Kismet]]'', set in Africa) in 1978. In the musical, one song gives a \"recipe\" for ''mahoun'', a preparation of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], in which her sultry purring rendition of the refrain \"constantly stirring with a long wooden spoon\" was distinctive. She was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical]] for her performance. In the late 1990s, she appeared as the [[Wicked Witch of the West]] in the North American national touring company of ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1987 musical)|The Wizard of Oz]]''. In 2000, Kitt again returned to Broadway in the short-lived run of [[Michael John LaChiusa]]'s ''[[The Wild Party (LaChiusa musical)|The Wild Party]]''. Beginning in late 2000, Kitt starred as the [[Fairy Godmother]] in the U.S. national tour of ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]''. In 2003, she replaced [[Chita Rivera]] in ''[[Nine (musical)|Nine]]''. Kitt reprised her role as the Fairy Godmother at a special engagement of ''Cinderella'', which took place at [[Lincoln Center]] during the holiday season of 2004. From October to early December 2006, Kitt co-starred in the [[off-Broadway]] musical ''[[Mimi le Duck]]''.\n\n===Voice-over===\nIn 1978, Kitt did the voice-over in a television commercial for the album ''[[Aja (album)|Aja]]'' by the rock group [[Steely Dan]]. One of her more unusual roles was as [[Kaa]] in a 1994 [[BBC Radio]] adaptation of ''[[The Jungle Book]]''. Kitt also lent her distinctive voice to [[Yzma]] in ''[[The Emperor's New Groove]]'' (for which she won her first [[Annie Award]]) and reprised her role in ''[[Kronk's New Groove]]'' and ''[[The Emperor's New School]]'', for which she won two [[Emmy Award]]s and, in 2007&ndash;08, two more [[Annie Awards]] for Voice Acting in an Animated Television Production. Kitt had voiced [[Queen Vexus|Vexus]] in ''[[My Life as a Teenage Robot]]''.\n\n===Later years===\n====1980s====\nIn 1984, she returned to the music charts with a disco song titled \"[[Where Is My Man]]\", the first certified gold record of her career. \"Where Is My Man\" reached the [[Top 40]] on the [[UK Singles Chart]], where it peaked at No.&nbsp;36;<ref>{{cite web | title=Where Is My Man | url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/Breakin%27%20Down%20%28Sugar%20Samba%29 | url-status=dead | publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] | df= | access-date=2019-09-12 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711041844/http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/breakin'%20down%20(sugar%20samba)/ | archive-date=2017-07-11 }}</ref> the song became a standard in discos and dance clubs of the time and made the Top 10 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Dance Club Play|dance chart]], where it reached No.&nbsp;7.<ref>[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (2004). ''Hot Dance/Disco 1974\u20132003''. Record Research Inc.</ref> The single was followed by the album ''I Love Men'' on the Record Shack label. Kitt found new audiences in nightclubs across the UK and the United States, including a whole new generation of gay male fans, and she responded by frequently giving benefit performances in support of [[HIV/AIDS]] organizations. Her 1989 follow-up hit \"Cha-Cha Heels\" (featuring [[Bronski Beat]]), which was originally intended to be recorded by [[Divine (performer)|Divine]], received a positive response from UK dance clubs, reaching No.&nbsp;32 in the charts in that country. In 1988, Kitt replaced [[Dolores Gray]] in the West End production of [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Follies]]'' as Carlotta, receiving standing ovations every night for her rendition of \"[[I'm Still Here (Follies song)|I'm Still Here]]\" at the beginning of act 2. She went on to perform her own one-woman show at The [[Shaftesbury Theatre]] to sold-out houses for three weeks in early 1989 after ''Follies''.\n\n====1990s====\nKitt appeared with Jimmy James and [[George Burns]] at a fundraiser in 1990 produced by Scott Sherman, agent from the Atlantic Entertainment Group. It was arranged that James would impersonate Kitt and then Kitt would walk out to take the microphone. This was met with a standing ovation.<ref name=Baltimore>Scott Duncan, [http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1990-09-17/features/1990260107_1_eartha-kitt-lifesongs-george-burns \"George Burns, Eartha Kitt are delightful at 'Lifesongs 1990'\"], ''The Baltimore Sun'', September 17, 1990.</ref> In 1991, Kitt returned to the screen in ''[[Ernest Scared Stupid]]'' as Old Lady Hackmore. In 1992, she had a supporting role as Lady Eloise in ''[[Boomerang (1992 film)|Boomerang]]''. In 1995, Kitt appeared as herself in an episode of ''[[The Nanny]]'', where she performed a song in French and flirted with Maxwell Sheffield ([[Charles Shaughnessy]]). In November 1996, she appeared in an episode of ''[[Celebrity Jeopardy|Celebrity Jeopardy!]]''.  She also did a series of commercials for [[Old Navy]].\n\n====2000s====\nKitt was the spokesperson for [[MAC Cosmetics]]' Smoke Signals collection in August 2007. She re-recorded \"[[Smoke Gets in Your Eyes]]\" for the occasion, was showcased on the MAC website, and the song was played at all MAC locations carrying the collection for the month. She also appeared in the 2007 independent film ''[[And Then Came Love]]'' opposite [[Vanessa Williams]]. In her later years, Kitt made annual appearances in the New York Manhattan [[cabaret]] scene at venues such as the Ballroom and the [[Cafe Carlyle|Caf\u00e9 Carlyle]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/26/arts/26kitt.html?_r=0 |newspaper=The New York Times |title=Eartha Kitt Obituary |accessdate=October 30, 2014|date=2008-12-25 |last1=Hoerburger |first1=Rob }}</ref> In April 2008, just months before her death, Kitt appeared at the [[Cheltenham Jazz Festival]]; the performance was recorded.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} She was also a guest star in \"[[Once Upon a Time in Springfield]]\" of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', where she was depicted as one of Krusty's past marriages.\n\n==Personal life==\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2014}}\n[[File:Eartha Kitt Allan Warren copy.jpg|thumb|upright|Kitt at the [[Jumeirah Carlton Tower|Carlton Tower]] hotel in London, 1973]]\nAfter romances with the cosmetics magnate [[Charles Revson]] and banking heir John Barry Ryan III, she married John William McDonald, an associate of a real estate investment company, on June 6, 1960.<ref>{{cite news | title=Eartha Kitt to Be Married | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1960/05/12/archives/eartha-kitt-to-be-married.html | work=The New York Times | date=May 12, 1960 |page=40}} {{subscription required}}</ref> They had one child, a daughter named Kitt McDonald, born on November 26, 1961.

She later moved to [[Pound Ridge, New York]], but returned in 2002 to the southern [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]], Connecticut, town of [[Weston, Connecticut|Weston]], in order to be near her daughter Kitt and family.

In 1966, she established the Kittsville Youth Foundation, a chartered and non-profit organization for underprivileged youths in the [[Watts, Los Angeles|Watts]] area of Los Angeles.<ref>Johnson, Robert E. (June 14, 1973). \"Eartha Kitt Observes Seventh Year With Black Ghetto School\". ''Jet'' '''44''': 56.</ref> She was also involved with a group of youths in the area of [[Anacostia]] in Washington, D.C., who called themselves \"Rebels with a Cause\". Kitt supported the groups' efforts to clean up streets and establish recreation areas in an effort to keep them out of trouble by testifying with them before the House General Subcommittee on Education of the [[Committee on Education and Labor]]. In her testimony, in May 1967, Kitt stated that the Rebels' \"achievements and accomplishments should certainly make the adult 'do-gooders' realize that these young men and women have performed in 1 short year \u2013 with limited finances \u2013 that which was not achieved by the same people who might object to turning over some of the duties of planning, rehabilitation, and prevention of juvenile delinquents and juvenile delinquency to those who understand it and are living it\". She added that \"the Rebels could act as a model for all urban areas throughout the United States with similar problems\".<ref>Hearings, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 558 (1967). pp. 559\u201360.</ref> \"Rebels with a Cause\" subsequently received the needed funding.<ref>Kitt, Eartha (1976).

It is the fifth installment in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series, succeeding [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS'' and ''Wii U'']]. The game follows the series' traditional style of gameplay: controlling one of the [[Characters in the Super Smash Bros. series|various characters]], players must use differing attacks to weaken their opponents and knock them out of an arena. It features a wide variety of [[game modes]], including a [[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]] for [[single-player]] and [[multiplayer]] versus modes. ''Ultimate'' features over 80 playable fighters, including everyone from all previous ''Super Smash Bros.'' games, alongside several newcomers. The roster ranges from Nintendo mascots to characters from [[Third party developer|third-party]] franchises, with the game being supported with post-release [[downloadable content]] that adds more.\n\nPlanning for the game had begun by December 2015, with full development starting after the completion of ''3DS''/''Wii U''{{'s}} [[downloadable content]] (DLC). Series creator and director [[Masahiro Sakurai]] returned along with Bandai Namco Studios and Sora, the studios that developed ''3DS''/''Wii U,'' with the return of the studios speeding up the preparation process. Sakurai's goal with ''Ultimate'' was to include every character from previous games despite the various development and licensing problems this would cause. Several well-known video game musicians contributed to the soundtrack, with [[Hideki Sakamoto]] writing the main theme \"Lifelight\".\n\nNintendo teased ''Ultimate'' in a [[Nintendo Direct]] in March 2018 and fully revealed it at [[E3 2018]] the following June. It later received two additional dedicated Nintendo Directs before releasing on December 7, 2018. The game received universal acclaim, with some critics calling it the best of the series. They praised its amount of content and fine-tuning of existing ''Smash'' gameplay elements, although its online mode received some criticism. By December 2019, the game had sold over 17.68 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling fighting game of all time.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{Main|Super Smash Bros.#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Super Smash Bros.}}\n[[File:Super Smash Bros.

It is the fifth installment in the ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' series, succeeding [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS'' and ''Wii U'']]. The game follows the series' traditional style of gameplay: controlling one of the [[Characters in the Super Smash Bros. series|various characters]], players must use differing attacks to weaken their opponents and knock them out of an arena. It features a wide variety of [[game modes]], including a [[Campaign (role-playing games)|campaign]] for [[single-player]] and [[multiplayer]] versus modes. ''Ultimate'' features over 80 playable fighters, including everyone from all previous ''Super Smash Bros.'' games, alongside several newcomers. The roster ranges from Nintendo mascots to characters from [[Third party developer|third-party]] franchises, with the game being supported with post-release [[downloadable content]] that adds more.\n\nPlanning for the game had begun by December 2015, with full development starting after the completion of ''3DS''/''Wii U''{{'s}} [[downloadable content]] (DLC). Series creator and director [[Masahiro Sakurai]] returned along with Bandai Namco Studios and Sora, the studios that developed ''3DS''/''Wii U,'' with the return of the studios speeding up the preparation process. Sakurai's goal with ''Ultimate'' was to include every character from previous games despite the various development and licensing problems this would cause. Several well-known video game musicians contributed to the soundtrack, with [[Hideki Sakamoto]] writing the main theme \"Lifelight\".\n\nNintendo teased ''Ultimate'' in a [[Nintendo Direct]] in March 2018 and fully revealed it at [[E3 2018]] the following June. It later received two additional dedicated Nintendo Directs before releasing on December 7, 2018. The game received universal acclaim, with some critics calling it the best of the series. They praised its amount of content and fine-tuning of existing ''Smash'' gameplay elements, although its online mode received some criticism. By December 2019, the game had sold over 17.68 million copies worldwide, making it the best-selling fighting game of all time.\n\n==Gameplay==\n{{Main|Super Smash Bros.#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Super Smash Bros.}}\n[[File:Super Smash Bros.

The popular vote was primarily directed to filling the office of Vice President.\n\nMissouri's participation in the election was a point of political dispute. On March 9, 1820, Congress had passed a law directing Missouri to hold a convention to form a constitution and a state government. This law stated that \"the said state, when formed, shall be admitted into the Union, upon an equal footing with the original states, in all respects whatsoever.\"<ref>{{cite book |author=United States Congress |others=Act of March 6, ch. 23, vol. 3 |title=United States Statutes at Large |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj06845)) |accessdate=August 9, 2006 |year=1820 |pages=545\u2013548}}</ref> However, when Congress reconvened in November 1820, the admission of Missouri became an issue of contention. Proponents claimed that Missouri had fulfilled the conditions of the law and therefore was a state; detractors contended that certain provisions of the Missouri Constitution violated the United States Constitution.\n\nBy the time Congress was due to meet to count the electoral votes from the election, this dispute had lasted over two months. The counting raised a ticklish problem: if Congress counted Missouri's votes, that would count as recognition that Missouri was a state; on the other hand, if Congress failed to count Missouri's vote, it would count as recognition that Missouri was not a state. Knowing ahead of time that Monroe had won in a landslide and that Missouri's vote would therefore make no difference in the final result, the Senate passed a resolution on February 13, 1821 stating that if a protest were made, there would be no consideration of the matter unless the vote of Missouri would change who would become president. Instead, the President of the Senate would announce the final tally twice, once with Missouri included and once with it excluded.<ref>{{cite book |author=United States Congress |others=16th Congress, 2nd Session, February 13 |title=Senate Journal |url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj01070)) |accessdate=July 29, 2006 |year=1821 |pages=187\u2013188}}</ref>\n\nThe next day this resolution was introduced in the full House. After a lively debate, it was passed. Nonetheless, during the counting of the electoral votes on February 14, 1821, an objection was raised to the votes from Missouri by Representative [[Arthur Livermore]] of New Hampshire.

Proponents claimed that Missouri had fulfilled the conditions of the law and therefore was a state; detractors contended that certain provisions of the Missouri Constitution violated the United States Constitution.\n\nBy the time Congress was due to meet to count the electoral votes from the election, this dispute had lasted over two months. The counting raised a ticklish problem: if Congress counted Missouri's votes, that would count as recognition that Missouri was a state; on the other hand, if Congress failed to count Missouri's vote, it would count as recognition that Missouri was not a state. Knowing ahead of time that Monroe had won in a landslide and that Missouri's vote would therefore make no difference in the final result, the Senate passed a resolution on February 13, 1821 stating that if a protest were made, there would be no consideration of the matter unless the vote of Missouri would change who would become president. Instead, the President of the Senate would announce the final tally twice, once with Missouri included and once with it excluded.<ref>{{cite book |author=United States Congress |others=16th Congress, 2nd Session, February 13 |title=Senate Journal |url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj01070)) |accessdate=July 29, 2006 |year=1821 |pages=187\u2013188}}</ref>\n\nThe next day this resolution was introduced in the full House. After a lively debate, it was passed. Nonetheless, during the counting of the electoral votes on February 14, 1821, an objection was raised to the votes from Missouri by Representative [[Arthur Livermore]] of New Hampshire. He argued that since Missouri had not yet officially become a state, it had no right to cast any electoral votes. Immediately, Representative [[John Floyd (Virginia politician)|John Floyd]] of Virginia argued that Missouri's votes must be counted. Chaos ensued, and order was restored only with the counting of the vote as per the resolution and then adjournment for the day.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Gales and Seaton |others=16th Congress, 2nd Session, February 14, 1821 |title=Annals of Congress |url=http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj01070)) |accessdate=July 29, 2006 |year=1856 |pages=1147\u20131165}}</ref>\n\n==Popular candidates==\nExcluding two-campaign two-term presidents, including candidates who eventually lost\n* Franklin Roosevelt - 4 times (4 terms)\n* Grover Cleveland - 3 times (2 terms)\n* Martin Van Buren - 2 times (1 term)\n* William Jennings Bryan - 2 times (0 terms)\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNeOTptSgKI County-by-county results since 1860]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n{{MissouriFederalElections}}\n\n{{United States presidential elections}}\n\n[[Category:United States presidential elections in Missouri| ]]\n", "name_user": "BD2412", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eElections from 1864 to present:Add note onUnited States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote, replaced: |2016]] || '''Donald Trump''' || \u2192 |2016]] || '''Donald Trump'''<ref name=\"PV\">[[United States pr", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_elections_in_Missouri"}
