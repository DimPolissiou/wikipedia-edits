Although [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Edward Jenner]] developed the first [[vaccine]]s to protect against viral infections, they did not know that viruses existed. The first evidence of the existence of viruses came from experiments with filters that had pores small enough to retain bacteria.  In 1892, [[Dmitri Ivanovsky]]  used one of these filters to show that sap from a diseased [[tobacco plant]] remained infectious to healthy tobacco plants despite having been filtered. [[Martinus Beijerinck]] called the filtered, infectious substance a \"virus\" and this discovery is considered to be the beginning of [[virology]]. \n\nThe subsequent discovery and partial characterization of [[bacteriophage]]s by [[Frederick Twort]] and [[F\u00e9lix d'Herelle]] further catalyzed the field, and by the early 20th century many viruses had been discovered. In 1926, [[Thomas Milton Rivers]] defined viruses as obligate parasites. Viruses were demonstrated to be particles, rather than a fluid, by [[Wendell Meredith Stanley]], and the invention of the [[electron microscopy|electron microscope]] in 1931 allowed their complex structures to be visualised.\n\n==Pioneers==\n[[File:Adolf Mayer 1875.jpg|thumb|upright|180px|[[Adolf Mayer]] in 1875]]\n[[File:Ivanovsky.jpg|thumb|upright|180px|[[Dmitri Ivanovsky]], ca. 1915]]\n[[File:Martinus Willem Beijerinck in his laboratory.jpg|thumb|upright|180px|alt=An old, bespectacled man wearing a suit and sitting at a bench by a large window.

Although [[Louis Pasteur]] and [[Edward Jenner]] developed the first [[vaccine]]s to protect against viral infections, they did not know that viruses existed. The first evidence of the existence of viruses came from experiments with filters that had pores small enough to retain bacteria.  In 1892, [[Dmitri Ivanovsky]]  used one of these filters to show that sap from a diseased [[tobacco plant]] remained infectious to healthy tobacco plants despite having been filtered. [[Martinus Beijerinck]] called the filtered, infectious substance a \"virus\" and this discovery is considered to be the beginning of [[virology]]. \n\nThe subsequent discovery and partial characterization of [[bacteriophage]]s by [[Frederick Twort]] and [[F\u00e9lix d'Herelle]] further catalyzed the field, and by the early 20th century many viruses had been discovered. In 1926, [[Thomas Milton Rivers]] defined viruses as obligate parasites. Viruses were demonstrated to be particles, rather than a fluid, by [[Wendell Meredith Stanley]], and the invention of the [[electron microscopy|electron microscope]] in 1931 allowed their complex structures to be visualised.\n\n==Pioneers==\n[[File:Adolf Mayer 1875.jpg|thumb|upright|180px|[[Adolf Mayer]] in 1875]]\n[[File:Ivanovsky.jpg|thumb|upright|180px|[[Dmitri Ivanovsky]], ca. 1915]]\n[[File:Martinus Willem Beijerinck in his laboratory.jpg|thumb|upright|180px|alt=An old, bespectacled man wearing a suit and sitting at a bench by a large window.

Thus, he could pass a solution containing bacteria through the filter and completely remove them from the solution.<ref name =\"Shors 76\u201377\">{{harvnb|Shors|2008|pp=76\u201377}}</ref>\n\nIn 1876, [[Adolf Mayer]], who directed the Agricultural Experimental Station in [[Wageningen]], was the first to show that what he called \"Tobacco Mosaic Disease\" was infectious. He thought that it was caused by either a toxin or a very small bacterium. Later, in 1892, the Russian biologist [[Dmitry Ivanovsky]] (1864\u20131920) used a Chamberland filter to study what is now known as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]]. His experiments showed that crushed leaf extracts from infected tobacco plants remain infectious after filtration.

The sizes of viruses determined using this new microscope fitted in well with those estimated by filtration experiments. Viruses were expected to be small, but the range of sizes came as a surprise.

These agents were invisible and could only be grown in living animals. The discovery of viruses was the key that unlocked the door that withheld the secrets of the cause of these mysterious infections.
