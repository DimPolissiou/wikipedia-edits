They ruled the [[Roman Empire]] from its formation under Augustus in 27 BC until AD 68 (95 years), when the last of the line, Nero, committed [[suicide]].<ref>There is some variation in usage; in strictly chronological contexts, it can be useful to distinguish between the long reign of Augustus and his Julio-Claudian (or ''Claudian'') successors, the four of whom together reigned about as long as Augustus himself.</ref> The name \"Julio-Claudian dynasty\" is a historiographical term derived from the two main branches of the imperial family: the [[Julia (gens)|''gens Julia'']] ([[Julii Caesares]]) and [[Claudia (gens)|''gens Claudia'']] ([[Claudia (gens)#Claudii Nerones|Claudii Nerones]]).\n\n[[Primogeniture]] is notably absent in the history of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Neither Augustus, Caligula, nor Nero fathered a natural and legitimate son. Tiberius' own son, [[Drusus Julius Caesar|Drusus]] predeceased him. Only Claudius was outlived by his son, [[Britannicus]], although he opted to promote his adopted son Nero as his successor to the throne. [[Adoption in ancient Rome|Adoption]] ultimately became a tool that most Julio-Claudian emperors utilized in order to promote their chosen heir to the front of the succession. Augustus&mdash;himself an adopted son of his great-uncle, the [[Roman dictator]] [[Julius Caesar]]&mdash;adopted his stepson Tiberius as his son and heir. Tiberius was, in turn, required to adopt his nephew [[Germanicus]], the father of Caligula and brother of Claudius. Caligula adopted his cousin [[Tiberius Gemellus]] (grandson of the emperor Tiberius) shortly before executing him. Claudius adopted his great-nephew and stepson Nero, who, lacking a natural or adopted son of his own, ended the reign of the Julio-Claudian dynasty with his fall from power and subsequent suicide.\n\nThe ancient historians who dealt with the Julio-Claudian period&mdash;chiefly [[Suetonius]] (c. 69 \u2013 after 122 AD) and [[Tacitus]] (c. 56 \u2013 after AD 117)&mdash;write in generally negative terms about their reign. In Tacitus's historiography of the Julio-Claudian emperors, he states:\n\n{{quote|But the successes and reverses of the old Roman people have been recorded by famous historians; and fine intellects were not wanting to describe the times of Augustus, till growing [[sycophancy]] scared them away. The histories of Tiberius, Gaius, Claudius, and Nero, while they were in power, were falsified through terror, and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' I.1</ref>}}\n\n==Nomenclature==\n''[[Julia (gens)|Julius]]'' and ''[[Claudia (gens)|Claudius]]'' were two [[Roman naming conventions|Roman family names]]; in classical Latin, they came second. Roman family names were inherited from father to son, but a Roman aristocrat could \u2013 either during his life or in his will \u2013 adopt an heir if he lacked a natural son. In accordance with Roman naming conventions, the adopted son would replace his original family name with the name of his adopted family. A famous example of this custom is [[Julius Caesar]]'s adoption of his great-nephew, [[Augustus|Gaius Octavius]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n'''[[Augustus]]''' (''Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus''), as Caesar's adopted son and heir, discarded the [[Octavia (gens)|family name]] of [[Gaius Octavius (praetor 61 BC)|his natural father]] and initially renamed himself \"Gaius Julius Caesar\" after his adoptive father. It was also customary for the adopted son to acknowledge his original family by adding an extra name at the end of his new name. As such, Augustus' adopted name would have been \"Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus\". However, there is no evidence that he ever used the name Octavianus.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nFollowing Augustus' ascension as the first [[Roman emperor|emperor]] of the [[Roman Empire]] in 27 BC, his family became a ''de facto'' [[Dynasty|royal house]], known in historiography as the \"Julio-Claudian dynasty\". For various reasons, the Julio-Claudians followed in the example of Julius Caesar and Augustus by utilizing adoption as a tool for dynastic succession. The next four emperors were closely related through a combination of blood relation, marriage and adoption.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n'''[[Tiberius]]''' (''Tiberius Caesar Divi Augusti Filius Augustus''), a Claudian by birth, became Augustus' stepson after the latter's marriage to [[Livia]], who divorced Tiberius' [[Tiberius Claudius Nero (praetor 42 BC)|natural father]] in the process. Tiberius' connection to the Julian side of the Imperial family grew closer when he married Augustus' only daughter, [[Julia the Elder]]. He ultimately succeeded Augustus as emperor in [[AD 14]] after becoming his stepfather's adopted son and heir.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/augustus |title=Augustus |website=British Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=14 February 2017}} {{Dead link |date=February 2017}} {{Dead link |date=February 2017}}</ref>\n\n'''[[Caligula]]''' (''Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus'') was born into the Julian and Claudian branches of the Imperial family, thereby making him the first actual \"Julio-Claudian\" emperor. His father, [[Germanicus]], was the son of [[Nero Claudius Drusus]] and [[Antonia Minor]], the son of Livia and the daughter of [[Octavia Minor]] respectively. Germanicus was also a great-nephew of Augustus on his mother's side and nephew of Tiberius on his father's side. His wife, [[Agrippina the Elder]], was a granddaughter of Augustus. Through Agrippina, Germanicus' children \u2013 including Caligula \u2013 were Augustus' great-grandchildren. When Augustus adopted Tiberius, the latter was required to adopt his brother's eldest son as well, thus allowing Germanicus' side of the Imperial family to inherit the Julius [[List of Roman nomina|nomen]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n'''[[Claudius]]''' (''Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus''), the younger brother of Germanicus, was a Claudian on the side of his father, Nero Claudius Drusus, younger brother of Tiberius. However, he was also related to the Julian branch of the Imperial family through his mother, Antonia Minor. As a son of Antonia, Claudius was a great-nephew of Augustus. Moreover, he was also Augustus' step-grandson due to the fact that his father was a stepson of Augustus. Unlike Tiberius and Germanicus, both of whom were born as Claudians and became adopted Julians, Claudius was not adopted into the Julian family. Upon becoming emperor, however, he added the Julian-affiliated [[cognomen]] ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' to his full name.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n'''[[Nero]]''' (''Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus'') was a great-great-grandson of Augustus and Livia through his mother, [[Agrippina the Younger]]. The younger Agrippina was a daughter of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder, as well as Caligula's sister. Through his mother, Nero was related by blood to the Julian and Claudian branches of the Imperial family. However, he was born into the [[Domitia (gens)|Domitii Ahenobarbi]] on his father's side. Nero became a Claudian in name as a result of Agrippina's marriage to her uncle, Claudius, who ultimately adopted her son as his own. He succeeded Claudius in [[AD 54]], becoming the last direct descendant of Augustus to rule the Roman Empire. Within a year of Nero's suicide in [[AD 68]], the Julio-Claudian dynasty was succeeded by the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian emperors]] following a brief [[Year of the Four Emperors|civil war]] over the vacant Imperial throne.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Rise and fall of the Julio-Claudians==\n[[Image:Youth on horseback.jpg|right|thumb|This marble statue of a youth on horseback is believed to represent a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.]]\n\n===Augustus===\n{{Main|Augustus}}\nLacking any male child and heir, Augustus married his only child -- a daughter -- [[Julia the Elder|Julia]] to his nephew [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcus Claudius Marcellus]]. Marcellus, however, died of food poisoning in 23 BC.  Augustus then married his widowed daughter to his loyal friend, [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], previously married to Augustus' niece, the sister of Marcellus. This marriage produced five children, three sons and two daughters: [[Gaius Caesar]], [[Lucius Caesar]], [[Julia the Younger]], [[Agrippina the Elder]], and [[Agrippa Postumus]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nGaius and Lucius, the first two children of Julia and Agrippa, were adopted by Augustus and became heirs to the throne; however, Augustus also showed great favor toward his wife Livia's two children from her first marriage: [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] and [[Tiberius]].  They were successful military leaders who had fought against the barbarian Germanic tribes.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nAgrippa died in 12 BC, and Tiberius was ordered by Augustus to divorce his wife [[Vipsania Agrippina]], daughter of Agrippa by his first marriage, and marry his stepsister, the twice-widowed Julia. Drusus, the brother of Tiberius, died in 9 BC after falling from a horse. Tiberius shared in Augustus' tribune powers, but shortly thereafter, in 6 BC, he went into voluntary exile in [[Rhodes]].  After the early deaths of both Lucius (AD 2) and Gaius (AD 4) and the exile of both Julia the Elder and Younger for adultery, a turn of events  which saw the elder Julia's half brother [[Publius Cornelius Scipio (consul 16 BC)|Publius Cornelius Scipio]] exiled for treason, Mark Antony's son [[Iullus Antonius]] committing suicide and Julia the Younger's husband [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 1)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]] being executed for conspiracy, Augustus was forced to recognize Tiberius as the next Roman emperor.  Augustus banished his grandson Postumus Agrippa, who was adopted after the death of his brothers, to the small island of [[Pianosa|Planasia]] (around AD 6 or 7) where he was later executed, and Tiberius was recalled to Rome and officially adopted by Augustus. By Augustus' request, Tiberius adopted his nephew Germanicus, son of his late brother Drusus and biological great-nephew of Augustus through his mother. Germanicus subsequently married Augustus' granddaughter Agrippina.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Tiberius===\n{{Main|Tiberius}}\nOn 19 August AD 14, Augustus died. Tiberius had already been established as Princeps in all but name, and his position as heir was confirmed in Augustus' will.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nDespite his difficult relationship with the Senate, Tiberius' first years were generally good. He stayed true to Augustus\u2019s plans for the succession and favored his adopted son and nephew [[Germanicus]] over his natural son, [[Drusus Julius Caesar|Drusus]], as did the Roman populace. On Tiberius' request, Germanicus was granted proconsular power and assumed command in the prime military zone of Germania, where he suppressed the mutiny there and led the formerly restless legions on campaigns against Germanic tribes from AD 14 to 16. Germanicus died in Syria in AD 19 and, on his deathbed, accused the governor of Syria, [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]], of murdering him at Tiberius\u2019s orders. With Germanicus dead, Tiberius began elevating his own son Drusus to replace him as the Imperial successor. By this time Tiberius had left more of the day-to-day running of the Empire to [[Sejanus|Lucius Aelius Sejanus]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nSejanus created an atmosphere of fear in Rome, controlling a network of informers and spies whose incentive to accuse others of treason was a share in the accused's property after their conviction and death. Treason trials became commonplace; few members of the Roman aristocracy were safe. The trials played up to Tiberius' growing paranoia, which made him more reliant on Sejanus, as well as allowing Sejanus to eliminate potential rivals. Victims of this reign of terror related to the imperial family included [[Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus]], second husband of Tiberius' first wife Vipsania, who had since died, and [[Decimus Haterius Agrippa]], grandson of Agrippa and husband of Augustus' great-niece, [[Quinctilius Varus]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nTiberius, perhaps sensitive to this ambition, rejected Sejanus's initial proposal to marry Germanicus' sister [[Livilla]], the widow of Tiberius' son Drusus, who had since died, in AD 25, but later had withdrawn his objections so that, in AD 30, Sejanus was betrothed to Livilla's daughter [[Julia Livia|Julia]] (who was also Tiberius' granddaughter). Sejanus' family connection to the Imperial house was now imminent, and in AD 31 Sejanus held the Consulship with the emperor as his colleague, an honor Tiberius reserved only for heirs to the throne. When he was summoned to a meeting of the Senate later that year on 18 October AD 31, he probably expected to receive a share of the tribunician power. Instead, however, Tiberius' letter to the Senate, completely unexpectedly, requested the destruction of Sejanus and his faction. A purge followed, in which Sejanus and his most prominent supporters were killed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} With Drusus dead and having had Germanicus' elder two sons [[Nero Julius Caesar|Nero]] and [[Drusus Caesar|Drusus]] convicted of treason and killed, along with their mother Agrippina, Tiberius appointed Caligula, Germanicus' youngest son, and [[Tiberius Gemellus]], the son of Drusus the Younger and grandson of Tiberius, co-heirs. Drusus III's wife [[Aemilia Lepida]] was later forced to commit suicide after being accused of adultery.\n\nRome's second Emperor died at the port town of Misenum on 16 March AD 37, at the age of 78 years, having reigned for 23 years. Suetonius writes that the Prefect of the [[Praetorian Guard]] [[Naevius Sutorius Macro]] smothered Tiberius with a pillow to hasten Caligula's accession. According to Suetonius, he was known for his cruelty and debauchery through his perversion on the island of Capri where he forced young boys and girls into orgies. On one account when one of the boys complained, Tiberius had his legs broken. Suetonius' claims, however, have to be taken with a degree of skepticism, due to bitterness from the reign of previous emperors that usually accompanies the coming of a new leader.{{Clarify|date=March 2012}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n===Caligula===\n{{Main|Caligula}}\nAlthough Augustus' succession plans were all but ruined due to the deaths of more than several family members, including many of his own descendants, in the end, Tiberius remained faithful to his predecessor's wishes that the next emperor would hail from the Julian side of the Imperial family. Thus, Tiberius was succeeded by Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, the sole-remaining son of his adopted son Germanicus. The new emperor not only belonged to both the Julian and Claudian sides of the Imperial family but was also a direct descendant of Augustus Caesar through his mother [[Agrippina the Elder]]. More commonly remembered in history by his childhood nickname [[Caligula]], he was the third Roman Emperor ruling from AD 37 to 41.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nWhen Tiberius died on 16 March AD 37, Caligula was well-positioned to assume power, despite the obstacle of Tiberius\u2019s will, which named him and his cousin [[Tiberius Gemellus]] as joint heirs. Caligula ordered Gemellus killed within his first year in power. Backed by Naevius Sutorius Macro, Caligula asserted himself as sole princeps, though he later had Macro disposed of as well.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. Following Gemellus' death, Caligula marked his brother-in-law, [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], husband of his sister [[Julia Drusilla]], as his heir. However, after Drusilla's death, Lepidus was accused of having affairs with Caligula's other sisters [[Agrippina the Younger]] and [[Julia Livilla]] and he was executed. He had previously had Drusilla's first husband [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul AD 30)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]] killed and upon the death of Agrippina's husband [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32)|Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus]], he seized his inheritance.\n\nSeveral unsuccessful assassination attempts were made on Caligula's life.  The successful conspiracy that ended Caligula's life was hatched by the disgruntled [[Praetorian Guard]] with backing by the Senate. The historian [[Josephus]] claims that the conspirators wished to restore the Republic while the historian [[Suetonius]] claims their motivations were mostly personal. On 24 January AD 41, the Praetorian tribune [[Cassius Chaerea]] and his men stopped Caligula alone in an underground passage leading to a theater. They stabbed him to death. Together with another tribune, Cornelius Sabinus, he killed Caligula's wife [[Milonia Caesonia|Caesonia]] and their infant daughter [[Julia Drusilla (daughter of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]] on the same day.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Claudius===\n{{Main|Claudius}}\nAfter Caligula\u2019s death, the Senate attempted and failed to restore the Republic.  [[Claudius]], Caligula's uncle, became emperor by the instigation of the Praetorian Guards.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nDespite his lack of political experience, and the disapproval of the people of Rome, Claudius proved to be an able administrator and a great builder of public works. His reign saw an expansion of the empire, including the [[Roman invasion of Britain|invasion of Britain]] in AD 43. He took a personal interest in the law, presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day; however, he was seen as vulnerable throughout his rule, particularly by the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position\u2014resulting in the deaths of many senators. Claudius also suffered tragic setbacks in his personal life. He married four times (to, in order, [[Plautia Urgulanilla]], [[Aelia Paetina]], [[Valeria Messalina]] and, finally, [[Agrippina the Younger]]) and is referenced by Suetonius as being easily manipulated. This is particularly evident during his marriage to Agrippina the Younger, his niece. Messalina saw several members of the dynasty eliminated, notably arranging for the executions of Claudius' nieces [[Julia Livilla]], daughter of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder, and [[Julia Livia]], daughter of Livilla and Drusus the Younger, as well as Julia Livilla's husband [[Marcus Vinicius (consul 30)|Marcus Vinicius]], her mother's husband [[Appius Junius Silanus]], [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 23)|Gaius Asinius Pollio]], son of Tiberius' first wife Vipsania by her second husband, Claudius' son-in-law [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (husband of Claudia Antonia)|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]], and his parents [[Marcus Licinius Crassus Frugi]] and [[Scribonia (daughter of Lucius Scribonius Libo consul 16)|Scribonia]]. Messalina herself was finally executed after being charged with adultery.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nClaudius' reign also included several attempts on his life. In order to gain political support, he married Agrippina and adopted his great-nephew Nero.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nWith his adoption on 25 February AD 50, Nero became heir to the throne, over Claudius' own son [[Britannicus]]. Claudius died on 13 October AD 54, and Nero became emperor. A number of ancient historians accuse Agrippina of poisoning Claudius, but details on these private events vary widely.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These events are recounted in book 12 of the Annals of Tacitus, book 61 of Cassius Dio\u2019s Roman History, and in the biographies of Nero and Cladius by Seutonius.\n\n===Nero===\n{{Main|Nero}}\nNero became emperor in AD 54 at sixteen, the youngest emperor yet. Like his uncle Caligula before him, Nero was also a direct descendant of Augustus Caesar, a fact which made his ascension to the throne much easier and smoother than it had been for Tiberius or Claudius. Ancient historians describe Nero's early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother Agrippina, his tutor [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], and the Praetorian Prefect [[Sextus Afranius Burrus|Burrus]], especially in the first year. He was made Emperor over his step-brother, Claudius' son [[Britannicus]], who he had killed. Agrippina was believed to have poisoned Claudius, having allegedly poisoned her second husband [[Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus]]. She had also arranged the deaths of Caligula's third wife, [[Lollia Paulina]] and Messalina's mother [[Domitia Lepida the Younger]]. She saw that the dynasty's numbers dwindle with  the execution of [[Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus (consul 46)|Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus]], a grandson of Julia the Younger, to strengthen Nero's claim, having previously arranged the death of his brother [[Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus]]. In AD 55, Nero began taking on a more active role as an administrator. He was consul four times between AD 55 and 60. Nero consolidated power over time through the execution and banishment of his rivals and slowly usurped authority from the Senate. He reportedly arranged the death of his own mother Agrippina and after divorcing his wife [[Claudia Octavia]], daughter of Claudius' and Messalina, he had her killed. Other relatives whom Nero was believed to have had killed were Claudius' daughter by Aelia Paetina, [[Claudia Antonia]], her husband and half-brother of Messalina, [[Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix]], [[Decimus Junius Silanus Torquatus]], brother of Marcus and Lucius Junius Silanus Torquantus, as well as Marcus' son, also named Lucius, his aunt [[Domitia Lepida the Elder]], and [[Rubellius Plautus]], son of Julia Livia along with his wife, children and father-in-law.\n\nIn AD 64 [[Great Fire of Rome|Rome burned]]. Nero enacted a public relief effort as well as large reconstruction projects. To fund this, the provinces were heavily taxed following the fire.\n\nBy AD 65, senators complained that they had no power left and this led to the Pisonian conspiracy, led by [[Gaius Calpurnius Piso]], an adoptive descendant of Triumvir [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], grandson of [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]], a governor of Syria who committed suicide after being accused of killing Germanicus, and first husband of [[Livia Orestilla]], Caligula's second wife. The conspiracy failed and its members were executed.  Vacancies after the conspiracy allowed [[Nymphidius Sabinus]], a grandson of former imperial freedman [[Gaius Julius Callistus]], who claimed to be an illegitimate son of Caligula, to rise in the Praetorian Guard.\n\nIn late AD 67 or early 68, [[Vindex]], the governor of [[Gallia Lugdunensis]] in [[Gaul]], rebelled against Nero's tax policies. [[Lucius Virginius Rufus]], the governor of superior Germany, was sent to put down the rebellion. To gain support, Vindex called on [[Galba]], the governor of [[Hispania Citerior]] (in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]), to become emperor. Virginius Rufus defeated Vindex's forces and Vindex committed suicide. Galba was declared a public enemy and his legion was confined in the city of Clunia.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nNero had regained the control of the empire militarily, but this opportunity was used by his enemies in Rome. Nymphidius Sabinus, who desired to become emperor himself, bribed the Praetorian Guard to betray Nero. Sabinus was later murdered in favor of Galba.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nNero reportedly committed suicide with the help of his scribe [[Epaphroditos]]. The Senate had been trying to preserve the dynastic bloodline by saving Nero's life, and were additionally reluctant to let someone who was not of the family become emperor; however, once he had committed suicide, and with Galba marching on the city, it had no choice but to declare him a public enemy posthumously. With his death, the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to an end. Chaos ensued in the [[Year of the Four Emperors]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Survival after the fall of Nero===\nAugustus' bloodline outlived his dynasty through the descendants of his first granddaughter, [[Julia the Younger]], who married [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 1)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]] and gave birth to [[Aemilia Lepida (fiancee of Claudius)|Aemilia Lepida]].<ref>Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', \"II.

He and his brother [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] were Livia's sons through her previous marriage to [[Tiberius Claudius Nero (praetor 42 BC)|Tiberius Claudius Nero]].\n# Nero, biological son of [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32)|Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus]], became the stepson of his great-uncle Claudius when the emperor married his niece [[Agrippina the Younger]].\n\nThe uncle/nephew relationship is also prominent:\n \n#Tiberius was Claudius's paternal uncle, being the older brother of Drusus, Claudius' father.\n#Claudius was Caligula's paternal uncle, being the younger brother of Germanicus, Caligula's father. \n#Caligula was Nero's maternal uncle, being the older brother of Agrippina the Younger, Nero's mother.\n\nThere were several instances of Emperors being father-in-law and son-in-law to each other:\n#Tiberius, in addition to being Augustus' stepson and adopted son, was married to [[Julia the Elder]], daughter of Augustus.\n#Nero, in addition to being Claudius' great-nephew, stepson and adopted son, was married to [[Claudia Octavia]], daughter of Claudius.\n\nThe following bullet points illustrate the lineage of Julio-Claudian emperors (adoptions included; emperors in '''bold'''):\n\n*'''Augustus''', adopted son of Julius Caesar\n**'''Tiberius''', adopted son of Augustus\n***Germanicus, adopted son of Tiberius\n****'''Caligula''', son of Germanicus\n**Drusus, stepson of Augustus\n***'''Claudius''', son of Drusus\n****'''Nero''', adopted son of Claudius\n\nNo Julio-Claudian emperor was a blood descendant of his immediate predecessor.

They ruled the [[Roman Empire]] from its formation under Augustus in 27 BC until AD 68 (95 years), when the last of the line, Nero, committed [[suicide]].<ref>There is some variation in usage; in strictly chronological contexts, it can be useful to distinguish between the long reign of Augustus and his Julio-Claudian (or ''Claudian'') successors, the four of whom together reigned about as long as Augustus himself.</ref> The name \"Julio-Claudian dynasty\" is a historiographical term derived from the two main branches of the imperial family: the [[Julia (gens)|''gens Julia'']] ([[Julii Caesares]]) and [[Claudia (gens)|''gens Claudia'']] ([[Claudia (gens)#Claudii Nerones|Claudii Nerones]]).\n\n[[Primogeniture]] is notably absent in the history of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. Neither Augustus, Caligula, nor Nero fathered a natural and legitimate son. Tiberius' own son, [[Drusus Julius Caesar|Drusus]] predeceased him. Only Claudius was outlived by his son, [[Britannicus]], although he opted to promote his adopted son Nero as his successor to the throne. [[Adoption in ancient Rome|Adoption]] ultimately became a tool that most Julio-Claudian emperors utilized in order to promote their chosen heir to the front of the succession. Augustus&mdash;himself an adopted son of his great-uncle, the [[Roman dictator]] [[Julius Caesar]]&mdash;adopted his stepson Tiberius as his son and heir. Tiberius was, in turn, required to adopt his nephew [[Germanicus]], the father of Caligula and brother of Claudius. Caligula adopted his cousin [[Tiberius Gemellus]] (grandson of the emperor Tiberius) shortly before executing him. Claudius adopted his great-nephew and stepson Nero, who, lacking a natural or adopted son of his own, ended the reign of the Julio-Claudian dynasty with his fall from power and subsequent suicide.\n\nThe ancient historians who dealt with the Julio-Claudian period&mdash;chiefly [[Suetonius]] (c. 69 \u2013 after 122 AD) and [[Tacitus]] (c. 56 \u2013 after AD 117)&mdash;write in generally negative terms about their reign. In Tacitus's historiography of the Julio-Claudian emperors, he states:\n\n{{quote|But the successes and reverses of the old Roman people have been recorded by famous historians; and fine intellects were not wanting to describe the times of Augustus, till growing [[sycophancy]] scared them away. The histories of Tiberius, Gaius, Claudius, and Nero, while they were in power, were falsified through terror, and after their death were written under the irritation of a recent hatred.<ref>Tacitus, ''Annals'' I.1</ref>}}\n\n==Nomenclature==\n''[[Julia (gens)|Julius]]'' and ''[[Claudia (gens)|Claudius]]'' were two [[Roman naming conventions|Roman family names]]; in classical Latin, they came second. Roman family names were inherited from father to son, but a Roman aristocrat could \u2013 either during his life or in his will \u2013 adopt an heir if he lacked a natural son. In accordance with Roman naming conventions, the adopted son would replace his original family name with the name of his adopted family. A famous example of this custom is [[Julius Caesar]]'s adoption of his great-nephew, [[Augustus|Gaius Octavius]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n'''[[Augustus]]''' (''Imperator Caesar Divi Filius Augustus''), as Caesar's adopted son and heir, discarded the [[Octavia (gens)|family name]] of [[Gaius Octavius (praetor 61 BC)|his natural father]] and initially renamed himself \"Gaius Julius Caesar\" after his adoptive father. It was also customary for the adopted son to acknowledge his original family by adding an extra name at the end of his new name. As such, Augustus' adopted name would have been \"Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus\". However, there is no evidence that he ever used the name Octavianus.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nFollowing Augustus' ascension as the first [[Roman emperor|emperor]] of the [[Roman Empire]] in 27 BC, his family became a ''de facto'' [[Dynasty|royal house]], known in historiography as the \"Julio-Claudian dynasty\". For various reasons, the Julio-Claudians followed in the example of Julius Caesar and Augustus by utilizing adoption as a tool for dynastic succession. The next four emperors were closely related through a combination of blood relation, marriage and adoption.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n'''[[Tiberius]]''' (''Tiberius Caesar Divi Augusti Filius Augustus''), a Claudian by birth, became Augustus' stepson after the latter's marriage to [[Livia]], who divorced Tiberius' [[Tiberius Claudius Nero (praetor 42 BC)|natural father]] in the process. Tiberius' connection to the Julian side of the Imperial family grew closer when he married Augustus' only daughter, [[Julia the Elder]]. He ultimately succeeded Augustus as emperor in [[AD 14]] after becoming his stepfather's adopted son and heir.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/augustus |title=Augustus |website=British Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=14 February 2017}} {{Dead link |date=February 2017}} {{Dead link |date=February 2017}}</ref>\n\n'''[[Caligula]]''' (''Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus'') was born into the Julian and Claudian branches of the Imperial family, thereby making him the first actual \"Julio-Claudian\" emperor. His father, [[Germanicus]], was the son of [[Nero Claudius Drusus]] and [[Antonia Minor]], the son of Livia and the daughter of [[Octavia Minor]] respectively. Germanicus was also a great-nephew of Augustus on his mother's side and nephew of Tiberius on his father's side. His wife, [[Agrippina the Elder]], was a granddaughter of Augustus. Through Agrippina, Germanicus' children \u2013 including Caligula \u2013 were Augustus' great-grandchildren. When Augustus adopted Tiberius, the latter was required to adopt his brother's eldest son as well, thus allowing Germanicus' side of the Imperial family to inherit the Julius [[List of Roman nomina|nomen]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n'''[[Claudius]]''' (''Tiberius Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus''), the younger brother of Germanicus, was a Claudian on the side of his father, Nero Claudius Drusus, younger brother of Tiberius. However, he was also related to the Julian branch of the Imperial family through his mother, Antonia Minor. As a son of Antonia, Claudius was a great-nephew of Augustus. Moreover, he was also Augustus' step-grandson due to the fact that his father was a stepson of Augustus. Unlike Tiberius and Germanicus, both of whom were born as Claudians and became adopted Julians, Claudius was not adopted into the Julian family. Upon becoming emperor, however, he added the Julian-affiliated [[cognomen]] ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' to his full name.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n'''[[Nero]]''' (''Nero Claudius Caesar Augustus Germanicus'') was a great-great-grandson of Augustus and Livia through his mother, [[Agrippina the Younger]]. The younger Agrippina was a daughter of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder, as well as Caligula's sister. Through his mother, Nero was related by blood to the Julian and Claudian branches of the Imperial family. However, he was born into the [[Domitia (gens)|Domitii Ahenobarbi]] on his father's side. Nero became a Claudian in name as a result of Agrippina's marriage to her uncle, Claudius, who ultimately adopted her son as his own. He succeeded Claudius in [[AD 54]], becoming the last direct descendant of Augustus to rule the Roman Empire. Within a year of Nero's suicide in [[AD 68]], the Julio-Claudian dynasty was succeeded by the [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian emperors]] following a brief [[Year of the Four Emperors|civil war]] over the vacant Imperial throne.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n==Rise and fall of the Julio-Claudians==\n[[Image:Youth on horseback.jpg|right|thumb|This marble statue of a youth on horseback is believed to represent a member of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.]]\n\n===Augustus===\n{{Main|Augustus}}\nLacking any male child and heir, Augustus married his only child -- a daughter -- [[Julia the Elder|Julia]] to his nephew [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcus Claudius Marcellus]]. Marcellus, however, died of food poisoning in 23 BC.  Augustus then married his widowed daughter to his loyal friend, [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], previously married to Augustus' niece, the sister of Marcellus. This marriage produced five children, three sons and two daughters: [[Gaius Caesar]], [[Lucius Caesar]], [[Julia the Younger]], [[Agrippina the Elder]], and [[Agrippa Postumus]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nGaius and Lucius, the first two children of Julia and Agrippa, were adopted by Augustus and became heirs to the throne; however, Augustus also showed great favor toward his wife Livia's two children from her first marriage: [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] and [[Tiberius]].  They were successful military leaders who had fought against the barbarian Germanic tribes.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nAgrippa died in 12 BC, and Tiberius was ordered by Augustus to divorce his wife [[Vipsania Agrippina]], daughter of Agrippa by his first marriage, and marry his stepsister, the twice-widowed Julia. Drusus, the brother of Tiberius, died in 9 BC after falling from a horse. Tiberius shared in Augustus' tribune powers, but shortly thereafter, in 6 BC, he went into voluntary exile in [[Rhodes]].  After the early deaths of both Lucius (AD 2) and Gaius (AD 4) and the exile of both Julia the Elder and Younger for adultery, a turn of events  which saw the elder Julia's half brother [[Publius Cornelius Scipio (consul 16 BC)|Publius Cornelius Scipio]] exiled for treason, Mark Antony's son [[Iullus Antonius]] committing suicide and Julia the Younger's husband [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 1)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]] being executed for conspiracy, Augustus was forced to recognize Tiberius as the next Roman emperor.  Augustus banished his grandson Postumus Agrippa, who was adopted after the death of his brothers, to the small island of [[Pianosa|Planasia]] (around AD 6 or 7) where he was later executed, and Tiberius was recalled to Rome and officially adopted by Augustus. By Augustus' request, Tiberius adopted his nephew Germanicus, son of his late brother Drusus and biological great-nephew of Augustus through his mother. Germanicus subsequently married Augustus' granddaughter Agrippina.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Tiberius===\n{{Main|Tiberius}}\nOn 19 August AD 14, Augustus died. Tiberius had already been established as Princeps in all but name, and his position as heir was confirmed in Augustus' will.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nDespite his difficult relationship with the Senate, Tiberius' first years were generally good. He stayed true to Augustus\u2019s plans for the succession and favored his adopted son and nephew [[Germanicus]] over his natural son, [[Drusus Julius Caesar|Drusus]], as did the Roman populace. On Tiberius' request, Germanicus was granted proconsular power and assumed command in the prime military zone of Germania, where he suppressed the mutiny there and led the formerly restless legions on campaigns against Germanic tribes from AD 14 to 16. Germanicus died in Syria in AD 19 and, on his deathbed, accused the governor of Syria, [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]], of murdering him at Tiberius\u2019s orders. With Germanicus dead, Tiberius began elevating his own son Drusus to replace him as the Imperial successor. By this time Tiberius had left more of the day-to-day running of the Empire to [[Sejanus|Lucius Aelius Sejanus]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nSejanus created an atmosphere of fear in Rome, controlling a network of informers and spies whose incentive to accuse others of treason was a share in the accused's property after their conviction and death. Treason trials became commonplace; few members of the Roman aristocracy were safe. The trials played up to Tiberius' growing paranoia, which made him more reliant on Sejanus, as well as allowing Sejanus to eliminate potential rivals. Victims of this reign of terror related to the imperial family included [[Gaius Asinius Gallus Saloninus]], second husband of Tiberius' first wife Vipsania, who had since died, and [[Decimus Haterius Agrippa]], grandson of Agrippa and husband of Augustus' great-niece, [[Quinctilius Varus]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nTiberius, perhaps sensitive to this ambition, rejected Sejanus's initial proposal to marry Germanicus' sister [[Livilla]], the widow of Tiberius' son Drusus, who had since died, in AD 25, but later had withdrawn his objections so that, in AD 30, Sejanus was betrothed to Livilla's daughter [[Julia Livia|Julia]] (who was also Tiberius' granddaughter). Sejanus' family connection to the Imperial house was now imminent, and in AD 31 Sejanus held the Consulship with the emperor as his colleague, an honor Tiberius reserved only for heirs to the throne. When he was summoned to a meeting of the Senate later that year on 18 October AD 31, he probably expected to receive a share of the tribunician power. Instead, however, Tiberius' letter to the Senate, completely unexpectedly, requested the destruction of Sejanus and his faction. A purge followed, in which Sejanus and his most prominent supporters were killed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} With Drusus dead and having had Germanicus' elder two sons [[Nero Julius Caesar|Nero]] and [[Drusus Caesar|Drusus]] convicted of treason and killed, along with their mother Agrippina, Tiberius appointed Caligula, Germanicus' youngest son, and [[Tiberius Gemellus]], the son of Drusus the Younger and grandson of Tiberius, co-heirs. Drusus III's wife [[Aemilia Lepida]] was later forced to commit suicide after being accused of adultery.\n\nRome's second Emperor died at the port town of Misenum on 16 March AD 37, at the age of 78 years, having reigned for 23 years. Suetonius writes that the Prefect of the [[Praetorian Guard]] [[Naevius Sutorius Macro]] smothered Tiberius with a pillow to hasten Caligula's accession. According to Suetonius, he was known for his cruelty and debauchery through his perversion on the island of Capri where he forced young boys and girls into orgies. On one account when one of the boys complained, Tiberius had his legs broken. Suetonius' claims, however, have to be taken with a degree of skepticism, due to bitterness from the reign of previous emperors that usually accompanies the coming of a new leader.{{Clarify|date=March 2012}}{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n===Caligula===\n{{Main|Caligula}}\nAlthough Augustus' succession plans were all but ruined due to the deaths of more than several family members, including many of his own descendants, in the end, Tiberius remained faithful to his predecessor's wishes that the next emperor would hail from the Julian side of the Imperial family. Thus, Tiberius was succeeded by Gaius Julius Caesar Augustus Germanicus, the sole-remaining son of his adopted son Germanicus. The new emperor not only belonged to both the Julian and Claudian sides of the Imperial family but was also a direct descendant of Augustus Caesar through his mother [[Agrippina the Elder]]. More commonly remembered in history by his childhood nickname [[Caligula]], he was the third Roman Emperor ruling from AD 37 to 41.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nWhen Tiberius died on 16 March AD 37, Caligula was well-positioned to assume power, despite the obstacle of Tiberius\u2019s will, which named him and his cousin [[Tiberius Gemellus]] as joint heirs. Caligula ordered Gemellus killed within his first year in power. Backed by Naevius Sutorius Macro, Caligula asserted himself as sole princeps, though he later had Macro disposed of as well.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}. Following Gemellus' death, Caligula marked his brother-in-law, [[Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (executed 39)|Marcus Aemilius Lepidus]], husband of his sister [[Julia Drusilla]], as his heir. However, after Drusilla's death, Lepidus was accused of having affairs with Caligula's other sisters [[Agrippina the Younger]] and [[Julia Livilla]] and he was executed. He had previously had Drusilla's first husband [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul AD 30)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]] killed and upon the death of Agrippina's husband [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32)|Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus]], he seized his inheritance.\n\nSeveral unsuccessful assassination attempts were made on Caligula's life.  The successful conspiracy that ended Caligula's life was hatched by the disgruntled [[Praetorian Guard]] with backing by the Senate. The historian [[Josephus]] claims that the conspirators wished to restore the Republic while the historian [[Suetonius]] claims their motivations were mostly personal. On 24 January AD 41, the Praetorian tribune [[Cassius Chaerea]] and his men stopped Caligula alone in an underground passage leading to a theater. They stabbed him to death. Together with another tribune, Cornelius Sabinus, he killed Caligula's wife [[Milonia Caesonia|Caesonia]] and their infant daughter [[Julia Drusilla (daughter of Caligula)|Julia Drusilla]] on the same day.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Claudius===\n{{Main|Claudius}}\nAfter Caligula\u2019s death, the Senate attempted and failed to restore the Republic.  [[Claudius]], Caligula's uncle, became emperor by the instigation of the Praetorian Guards.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nDespite his lack of political experience, and the disapproval of the people of Rome, Claudius proved to be an able administrator and a great builder of public works. His reign saw an expansion of the empire, including the [[Roman invasion of Britain|invasion of Britain]] in AD 43. He took a personal interest in the law, presided at public trials, and issued up to twenty edicts a day; however, he was seen as vulnerable throughout his rule, particularly by the nobility. Claudius was constantly forced to shore up his position\u2014resulting in the deaths of many senators. Claudius also suffered tragic setbacks in his personal life. He married four times (to, in order, [[Plautia Urgulanilla]], [[Aelia Paetina]], [[Valeria Messalina]] and, finally, [[Agrippina the Younger]]) and is referenced by Suetonius as being easily manipulated. This is particularly evident during his marriage to Agrippina the Younger, his niece. Messalina saw several members of the dynasty eliminated, notably arranging for the executions of Claudius' nieces [[Julia Livilla]], daughter of Germanicus and Agrippina the Elder, and [[Julia Livia]], daughter of Livilla and Drusus the Younger, as well as Julia Livilla's husband [[Marcus Vinicius (consul 30)|Marcus Vinicius]], her mother's husband [[Appius Junius Silanus]], [[Gaius Asinius Pollio (consul 23)|Gaius Asinius Pollio]], son of Tiberius' first wife Vipsania by her second husband, Claudius' son-in-law [[Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (husband of Claudia Antonia)|Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus]], and his parents [[Marcus Licinius Crassus Frugi]] and [[Scribonia (daughter of Lucius Scribonius Libo consul 16)|Scribonia]]. Messalina herself was finally executed after being charged with adultery.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nClaudius' reign also included several attempts on his life. In order to gain political support, he married Agrippina and adopted his great-nephew Nero.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nWith his adoption on 25 February AD 50, Nero became heir to the throne, over Claudius' own son [[Britannicus]]. Claudius died on 13 October AD 54, and Nero became emperor. A number of ancient historians accuse Agrippina of poisoning Claudius, but details on these private events vary widely.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} These events are recounted in book 12 of the Annals of Tacitus, book 61 of Cassius Dio\u2019s Roman History, and in the biographies of Nero and Cladius by Seutonius.\n\n===Nero===\n{{Main|Nero}}\nNero became emperor in AD 54 at sixteen, the youngest emperor yet. Like his uncle Caligula before him, Nero was also a direct descendant of Augustus Caesar, a fact which made his ascension to the throne much easier and smoother than it had been for Tiberius or Claudius. Ancient historians describe Nero's early reign as being strongly influenced by his mother Agrippina, his tutor [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], and the Praetorian Prefect [[Sextus Afranius Burrus|Burrus]], especially in the first year. He was made Emperor over his step-brother, Claudius' son [[Britannicus]], who he had killed. Agrippina was believed to have poisoned Claudius, having allegedly poisoned her second husband [[Gaius Sallustius Crispus Passienus]]. She had also arranged the deaths of Caligula's third wife, [[Lollia Paulina]] and Messalina's mother [[Domitia Lepida the Younger]]. She saw that the dynasty's numbers dwindle with  the execution of [[Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus (consul 46)|Marcus Junius Silanus Torquatus]], a grandson of Julia the Younger, to strengthen Nero's claim, having previously arranged the death of his brother [[Lucius Junius Silanus Torquatus]]. In AD 55, Nero began taking on a more active role as an administrator. He was consul four times between AD 55 and 60. Nero consolidated power over time through the execution and banishment of his rivals and slowly usurped authority from the Senate. He reportedly arranged the death of his own mother Agrippina and after divorcing his wife [[Claudia Octavia]], daughter of Claudius' and Messalina, he had her killed. Other relatives whom Nero was believed to have had killed were Claudius' daughter by Aelia Paetina, [[Claudia Antonia]], her husband and half-brother of Messalina, [[Faustus Cornelius Sulla Felix]], [[Decimus Junius Silanus Torquatus]], brother of Marcus and Lucius Junius Silanus Torquantus, as well as Marcus' son, also named Lucius, his aunt [[Domitia Lepida the Elder]], and [[Rubellius Plautus]], son of Julia Livia along with his wife, children and father-in-law.\n\nIn AD 64 [[Great Fire of Rome|Rome burned]]. Nero enacted a public relief effort as well as large reconstruction projects. To fund this, the provinces were heavily taxed following the fire.\n\nBy AD 65, senators complained that they had no power left and this led to the Pisonian conspiracy, led by [[Gaius Calpurnius Piso]], an adoptive descendant of Triumvir [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], grandson of [[Gnaeus Calpurnius Piso]], a governor of Syria who committed suicide after being accused of killing Germanicus, and first husband of [[Livia Orestilla]], Caligula's second wife. The conspiracy failed and its members were executed.  Vacancies after the conspiracy allowed [[Nymphidius Sabinus]], a grandson of former imperial freedman [[Gaius Julius Callistus]], who claimed to be an illegitimate son of Caligula, to rise in the Praetorian Guard.\n\nIn late AD 67 or early 68, [[Vindex]], the governor of [[Gallia Lugdunensis]] in [[Gaul]], rebelled against Nero's tax policies. [[Lucius Virginius Rufus]], the governor of superior Germany, was sent to put down the rebellion. To gain support, Vindex called on [[Galba]], the governor of [[Hispania Citerior]] (in the [[Iberian Peninsula]]), to become emperor. Virginius Rufus defeated Vindex's forces and Vindex committed suicide. Galba was declared a public enemy and his legion was confined in the city of Clunia.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nNero had regained the control of the empire militarily, but this opportunity was used by his enemies in Rome. Nymphidius Sabinus, who desired to become emperor himself, bribed the Praetorian Guard to betray Nero. Sabinus was later murdered in favor of Galba.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nNero reportedly committed suicide with the help of his scribe [[Epaphroditos]]. The Senate had been trying to preserve the dynastic bloodline by saving Nero's life, and were additionally reluctant to let someone who was not of the family become emperor; however, once he had committed suicide, and with Galba marching on the city, it had no choice but to declare him a public enemy posthumously. With his death, the Julio-Claudian dynasty came to an end. Chaos ensued in the [[Year of the Four Emperors]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Survival after the fall of Nero===\nAugustus' bloodline outlived his dynasty through the descendants of his first granddaughter, [[Julia the Younger]], who married [[Lucius Aemilius Paullus (consul 1)|Lucius Aemilius Paullus]] and gave birth to [[Aemilia Lepida (fiancee of Claudius)|Aemilia Lepida]].<ref>Suetonius, ''The Twelve Caesars'', \"II.

In addition to Cassia Longina, Junia Lepida gave birth to a son called [[Cassius Lepidus]]. Around AD 80 Lepidus had a daughter named [[Cassia Lepida]], who married [[Gaius Julius Alexander Berenicianus]]. [[Julia Cassia Alexandria]], Lepida's daughter by Berenicianus, married [[Gaius Avidius Heliodorus]] and ultimately gave birth to [[Avidius Cassius|Gaius Avidius Cassius]].{{sfn|Smith|1870|p=626}}{{sfn|Astarita|1983|p=27}} Avidius Cassius had three children with his wife (named either [[Volusia Vettia]] or [[Volusia Maeciana]]);{{sfn|Astarita|1983|p=27}} they were [[Avidius Heliodorus]], [[Avidius Maecianus]] and [[Avidia Alexandra]].{{sfn|Birley|2001|p=191}} In AD 175 Cassius was proclaimed emperor after he received erroneous news of the death of [[Marcus Aurelius]],{{sfn|Birley|2001|p=184}} whose survival made Cassius a [[Roman usurper|usurper]] of the empire.{{sfn|Birley|2001|p=185}} Cassius' rebellion ended three months into his bid for the throne when one of his [[centurion]]s assassinated him in favor of Marcus Aurelius.{{sfn|Smith|1870|p=441}}\n\nOn Livia Drusilla's side of the dynasty, [[Rubellia Bassa]] was one of the few remaining Claudians who survived the downfall of the first imperial family. A great-granddaughter of Tiberius, Rubellia was the daughter of [[Julia Livia]], whose father and mother were [[Drusus Julius Caesar]] (son of Tiberius) and [[Livilla]] (daughter of [[Nero Claudius Drusus]]), respectively. Rubellia was also related to Augustus by blood through her maternal great-great-grandmother [[Octavia Minor]] (sister of Augustus). She  married [[Octavius Laenas]], maternal uncle of the emperor [[Nerva]]. Her last known descendant was [[Sergius Octavius Laenas Pontianus]], consul in AD 131, who lived during the reign of [[Hadrian]]. Afterward, towards [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]], the line falls into the realm of parahistory, where various [[Medieval]] royal families have claimed some sort of descent, such as the [[Colonna family]].\n\n==Relationships among the rulers==\n[[File:Kujula Kadphises.

He and his brother [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] were Livia's sons through her previous marriage to [[Tiberius Claudius Nero (praetor 42 BC)|Tiberius Claudius Nero]].\n# Nero, biological son of [[Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus (consul 32)|Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus]], became the stepson of his great-uncle Claudius when the emperor married his niece [[Agrippina the Younger]].\n\nThe uncle/nephew relationship is also prominent:\n \n#Tiberius was Claudius's paternal uncle, being the older brother of Drusus, Claudius' father.\n#Claudius was Caligula's paternal uncle, being the younger brother of Germanicus, Caligula's father. \n#Caligula was Nero's maternal uncle, being the older brother of Agrippina the Younger, Nero's mother.\n\nThere were several instances of Emperors being father-in-law and son-in-law to each other:\n#Tiberius, in addition to being Augustus' stepson and adopted son, was married to [[Julia the Elder]], daughter of Augustus.\n#Nero, in addition to being Claudius' great-nephew, stepson and adopted son, was married to [[Claudia Octavia]], daughter of Claudius.\n\nThe following bullet points illustrate the lineage of Julio-Claudian emperors (adoptions included; emperors in '''bold'''):\n\n*'''Augustus''', adopted son of Julius Caesar\n**'''Tiberius''', adopted son of Augustus\n***Germanicus, adopted son of Tiberius\n****'''Caligula''', son of Germanicus\n**Drusus, stepson of Augustus\n***'''Claudius''', son of Drusus\n****'''Nero''', adopted son of Claudius\n\nNo Julio-Claudian emperor was a blood descendant of his immediate predecessor.

Run by the  [[City of Melbourne]], it is Australia's largest free community festival{{sfn|Powley|2017}}. The Melbournian tradition is celebrated over four days, incorporating the [[Labour Day]] long weekend, from Friday to the second Monday in March.  Moomba is culturally important to Melbourne, having been celebrated since 1955, and regularly attracts up to a million people, with a record attendance of 3.8 million (2.3 million tourists) set in 2018. \n\nIn 2003, the event was renamed ''Melbourne Moomba Waterfest'' and is centred on the [[Yarra River]].\n\nTraditional events include the Moomba parade, crowning of Moomba monarchs, fireworks displays, carnivals in the gardens along the river, river activities including watersports, water floats and the birdman rally, as well as live music and bands.\n\n==Origins==\nIn 1951, Australia celebrated fifty years of [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] with a parade and the staging of the theatre production \"An Aboriginal Moomba: Out of the Dark\". In 1954, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] visited the city for the first time as reigning monarch, and the City Development Association and the Melbourne City Council proposed an autumn carnival to be known as \"Moomba\".<ref>{{cite news|title='Moomba' gala next year|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/23425206|accessdate=2016-10-16|work=The Argus|date=1954-05-13}}</ref>  A committee was formed in July, 1954 to organise and fund the event, successfully allocating \u00a310,000 to its inaugural running. Before the event's first year, controversy was created when Labor Councillor Frank Williams resigned from the committee, branding the planned carnival as a \"Bourke street joke for the benefit of shopkeepers\".<ref>pg4. The Argus Wednesday 1 December 1954</ref>  A promotional theme song \"Come to Melbourne for the Moomba\" was written by [[Jack O'Hagan]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe festival was originally named ''Moomba'' by organisers in the belief it was a [[Australian Aboriginal languages|native word]] meaning 'let's get together and have fun.'  Credit is usually given to [[Bill Onus]], a unionist and member of the  [[Australian Aborigines' League]] for proposing the term, which he used in a play, ''Aboriginal Moomba'' in 1951.{{sfn|Dubecki|2008}} In 1969 [[Luise Hercus]] glossed the word  ''mum'' (rhyming with 'vroom'){{sfn|Kelly|2011}} as meaning 'bottom, rump', and suggested ''mum-ba'' meant something like 'bottom and..', and had been introduced from [[Healesville, Victoria|Healesville]] usage as a joke.{{sfn|Hercus|1969|p=371}}  In 1981 [[Barry Blake]] analysed the word as combining as ''mum'' (anus) and  ''\u2013ba'', a [[locative]] [[suffix]] meaning \u2018at, in, on'. This would give the sense of 'up your bum/arse'.{{sfn|Moore|2001|p=131}}{{sfn|Blake|1981|p=84}} \n\nOnus himself, according  to his daughter-in-law, who said she had heard the story from Onus's wife Mary,  had picked up the word from a word list of indigenous terms.{{sfn|Dubecki|2008}} Some say he did it to get back at the city council for having deliberately upstaged the traditional Labour Day march with a popular carnival. Lin Onus, his son, stated that indeed his father had intended to play a prank in passing on the word with this sense.{{sfn|Kelly|2011}}\n\n==Event history==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Moomba parade.jpg|right|thumb|The first Moomba procession, March 1955]] -->\n\n[[File:Queen of Moomba Crown.jpg|thumb|A crown worn by Queens of Moomba, circa 1980s.]]\n[[File:King of Moomba Crown.jpg|thumb|A crown worn by Kings of Moomba, circa 1980s.]]\n\nThe first Moomba was a 15-day festival officially opened on 12 March 1955 by the [[Governor of Victoria|State Governor]], Sir [[Dallas Brooks]].<ref>{{cite news|title=It's a gay day today|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/71638470|accessdate=2016-10-16|work=The Argus|date=1955-03-12}}</ref>  The inaugural programme included a fireworks display, parade, vintage car display, Henley rowing regatta, river floats including a \"Lord Mayor's houseboat\", cycling race, tennis at Kooyong, concerts including performances by the Victorian Symphony Orchestra and Royal Philharmonic choir, crowning of the Queen of Moomba and riverside carnival.  25,000 turned out to watch the inaugural Moomba parade down Swanston Street.

They also promote some aspect of the [[art]]s, like singing, dancing, or design.  Swanston Street is the traditional home of the floats and spine of the city and horse- or tractor-drawn floats use the [[tram]] tracks.

Run by the  [[City of Melbourne]], it is Australia's largest free community festival{{sfn|Powley|2017}}. The Melbournian tradition is celebrated over four days, incorporating the [[Labour Day]] long weekend, from Friday to the second Monday in March.  Moomba is culturally important to Melbourne, having been celebrated since 1955, and regularly attracts up to a million people, with a record attendance of 3.8 million (2.3 million tourists) set in 2018. \n\nIn 2003, the event was renamed ''Melbourne Moomba Waterfest'' and is centred on the [[Yarra River]].\n\nTraditional events include the Moomba parade, crowning of Moomba monarchs, fireworks displays, carnivals in the gardens along the river, river activities including watersports, water floats and the birdman rally, as well as live music and bands.\n\n==Origins==\nIn 1951, Australia celebrated fifty years of [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] with a parade and the staging of the theatre production \"An Aboriginal Moomba: Out of the Dark\". In 1954, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] visited the city for the first time as reigning monarch, and the City Development Association and the Melbourne City Council proposed an autumn carnival to be known as \"Moomba\".<ref>{{cite news|title='Moomba' gala next year|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/23425206|accessdate=2016-10-16|work=The Argus|date=1954-05-13}}</ref>  A committee was formed in July, 1954 to organise and fund the event, successfully allocating \u00a310,000 to its inaugural running. Before the event's first year, controversy was created when Labor Councillor Frank Williams resigned from the committee, branding the planned carnival as a \"Bourke street joke for the benefit of shopkeepers\".<ref>pg4. The Argus Wednesday 1 December 1954</ref>  A promotional theme song \"Come to Melbourne for the Moomba\" was written by [[Jack O'Hagan]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe festival was originally named ''Moomba'' by organisers in the belief it was a [[Australian Aboriginal languages|native word]] meaning 'let's get together and have fun.'  Credit is usually given to [[Bill Onus]], a unionist and member of the  [[Australian Aborigines' League]] for proposing the term, which he used in a play, ''Aboriginal Moomba'' in 1951.{{sfn|Dubecki|2008}} In 1969 [[Luise Hercus]] glossed the word  ''mum'' (rhyming with 'vroom'){{sfn|Kelly|2011}} as meaning 'bottom, rump', and suggested ''mum-ba'' meant something like 'bottom and..', and had been introduced from [[Healesville, Victoria|Healesville]] usage as a joke.{{sfn|Hercus|1969|p=371}}  In 1981 [[Barry Blake]] analysed the word as combining as ''mum'' (anus) and  ''\u2013ba'', a [[locative]] [[suffix]] meaning \u2018at, in, on'. This would give the sense of 'up your bum/arse'.{{sfn|Moore|2001|p=131}}{{sfn|Blake|1981|p=84}} \n\nOnus himself, according  to his daughter-in-law, who said she had heard the story from Onus's wife Mary,  had picked up the word from a word list of indigenous terms.{{sfn|Dubecki|2008}} Some say he did it to get back at the city council for having deliberately upstaged the traditional Labour Day march with a popular carnival. Lin Onus, his son, stated that indeed his father had intended to play a prank in passing on the word with this sense.{{sfn|Kelly|2011}}\n\n==Event history==\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Moomba parade.jpg|right|thumb|The first Moomba procession, March 1955]] -->\n\n[[File:Queen of Moomba Crown.jpg|thumb|A crown worn by Queens of Moomba, circa 1980s.]]\n[[File:King of Moomba Crown.jpg|thumb|A crown worn by Kings of Moomba, circa 1980s.]]\n\nThe first Moomba was a 15-day festival officially opened on 12 March 1955 by the [[Governor of Victoria|State Governor]], Sir [[Dallas Brooks]].<ref>{{cite news|title=It's a gay day today|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/71638470|accessdate=2016-10-16|work=The Argus|date=1955-03-12}}</ref>  The inaugural programme included a fireworks display, parade, vintage car display, Henley rowing regatta, river floats including a \"Lord Mayor's houseboat\", cycling race, tennis at Kooyong, concerts including performances by the Victorian Symphony Orchestra and Royal Philharmonic choir, crowning of the Queen of Moomba and riverside carnival.  25,000 turned out to watch the inaugural Moomba parade down Swanston Street.  The first Moomba was heavily criticised by Melbourne's conservative establishment, including the Anglican Church, which at the time claimed it was hedonistic and embodying social decay.<ref>{{cite news|title=With the Churchmen: 'Moomba spirit leading us to decay|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/71638713|accessdate=2016-10-16|work=The Argus|date=1955-03-14}}</ref>  Council responded to the criticism citing that Moomba was intended to be a festival for families and as such is reinforcing family values in society.<ref>{{cite news|title=Councillor defends Moomba|url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/71638990|accessdate=2016-10-16|work=The Argus|date=1955-03-15}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 2016 Moomba festival fireworks there was [[Apex (gang)#Moomba brawl|a large-scale brawl]] in and around [[Federation Square]] in Melbourne's [[Melbourne City Centre|Central Business District]], largely between members of two gangs, [[Apex (gang)|Apex]] and Islander 23.<ref name=\"blamed\">[https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/14/melbourne-street-brawl-blamed-on-apex-gang-after-moomba-festival Melbourne street brawl blamed on Apex gang after Moomba festival Sunday] March 13, 2016.

Each year it attracts over 100,000 people to Melbourne's city centre as well as being shown on free-to-air television in Melbourne.\n\nThe first Moomba procession was held in 1955.  It was first [[television|televised]] in 1957, the year after the Melbourne [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Olympics]].\n\n[[File:Snuff Puppets Moomba Parade 2001.jpg|thumb|right|Snuff Puppets float Moomba Parade 2001]]\n\nThe floats have an annual theme, usually an elaboration on \"Let's get together and have fun\", the avowed mission and vision statement of Moomba and are usually from [[Sister city|sister cities]] (of which Melbourne has six), [[school]]s and community groups. They also promote some aspect of the [[art]]s, like singing, dancing, or design.  Swanston Street is the traditional home of the floats and spine of the city and horse- or tractor-drawn floats use the [[tram]] tracks.  Decorated trams are sometimes also featured.\n\nIn 2001, the parade came under media controversy when a French Troupe and Melbourne's [[Snuff Puppets]] had floats with naked people covered in body paint.\n\n===Moomba monarchs===\n[[File:2014 Moomba Parade (60th Anniversary) Melbourne (13054867724).jpg|thumb|2014 Moomba monarchs -- [[Lucy Durack]] and [[Bert Newton]]]]\nThe Moomba monarchy has been one of the most celebrated and controversial components of the festival over the years.<ref name=\"Hist\">Craig Bellamy, Gordon Chisholm, Hilary Eriksen (17 Feb 2006) ''Moomba: A festival for the people.'': http://www.craigbellamy.net/images/moomba.pdf PDF pp 17-22</ref>\n\n<div class=\"c-table c-table-two \">\nIn 1999 the tradition ended when clowns [[Zig and Zag (Australian performers)|Zig and Zag]] were appointed.
