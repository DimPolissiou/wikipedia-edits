{"title_page": "History of liberalism", "text_new": "{{Liberalism sidebar|Development}} \n[[Liberalism]], the belief in [[freedom]], [[Political equality|equality]], [[democracy]] and [[human rights]], is historically associated with thinkers such as [[John Locke]] and [[Montesquieu]]. It is a political movement which spans the better part of the last four centuries, though the use of the word \"liberalism\" to refer to a specific political doctrine did not occur until the 19th century. The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 in [[England]] laid the foundations for the development of the modern liberal state by [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutionally limiting]] the power of the [[monarch]], affirming parliamentary supremacy, passing the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] and establishing the principle of \"[[consent of the governed]]\". The 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] of the [[United States]] founded the nascent republic on liberal principles without the encumbrance of hereditary aristocracy\u2014the declaration stated that \"all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, among these life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\",<ref>[https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf \"The Constitution of the United States\"] (PDF).</ref> echoing John Locke's phrase \"life, liberty, and property\". A few years later, the [[French Revolution]] overthrew the hereditary aristocracy, with the slogan \"liberty, equality, fraternity\" and was the first state in history to grant [[universal male suffrage]]. The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], first codified in 1789 in France, is a foundational document of both liberalism and human rights. The intellectual progress of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which questioned old traditions about societies and governments, eventually coalesced into powerful revolutionary movements that toppled what the French called the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], the belief in absolute monarchy and established religion, especially in [[Liberalism in Europe|Europe]], [[Liberalism and conservatism in Latin America|Latin America]] and [[Liberalism in the United States|North America]].\n\n[[William III of England|William Henry of Orange]] in the [[Glorious Revolution]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] in the [[American Revolution]] and [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] in the [[French Revolution]] used liberal philosophy to justify the armed overthrow of what they saw as [[Tyrant|tyrannical]] rule. Liberalism started to spread rapidly especially after the French Revolution. The 19th century saw liberal governments established in nations across Europe, South America and North America.<ref>{{cite book|first=Matthew|last=Kalkman|title=New Liberalism|isbn=978-1-926991-04-7|year=2011}}</ref> In this period, the dominant ideological opponent of [[classical liberalism]] was [[conservatism]], but liberalism later survived major ideological challenges from new opponents, such as [[fascism]] and [[communism]]. Liberal government often adopted the economic beliefs espoused by [[Adam Smith]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and others, which broadly emphasized the importance of [[free market]]s and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' governance, with a minimum of interference in trade.\n\nDuring 19th and early 20th century in the Ottoman Empire and Middle East, liberalism influenced periods of reform such as the [[Tanzimat]] and [[Nahda]] and the rise of secularism, constitutionalism and nationalism. These changes, along with other factors, helped to create a sense of crisis within Islam which continues to this day\u2014this led to [[Islamic revivalism]]. During the 20th century, liberal ideas spread even further as [[Liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] found themselves on the winning side in both world wars. In Europe and North America, the establishment of [[social liberalism]] (often called simply \"[[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]]\" in the United States) became a key component in the expansion of the [[welfare state]].<ref>[[Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.]] [http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/50s/schleslib.html \"Liberalism in America: A Note for Europeans\"] (1956).

Later waves of modern liberal thought and struggle were strongly influenced by the need to expand [[civil rights]].<ref name=\"Worell470\">Worell, p. 470.</ref> Liberals have advocated for [[gender equality]], [[marriage equality]] and [[racial equality]] and a global social movement for civil rights in the 20th century achieved several objectives towards those goals.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ross A.

Disputes between the [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] and King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] over political supremacy sparked a massive civil war in the 1640s, which culminated in Charles' execution and the establishment of a [[Republic of England|Republic]]. In particular, the [[Levellers]], a radical political movement of the period, published their manifesto ''[[Agreement of the People]]'' which advocated [[popular sovereignty]], an extended voting [[suffrage]], [[religious tolerance]] and [[equality before the law]]. The impact of these ideas steadily increased during the 17th century in England, culminating in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, which enshrined [[parliamentary sovereignty]] and the [[right of revolution]], and led to the establishment of what many consider the first modern, liberal state.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oc-uXxPXfmwC|title=1688: The First Modern Revolution|author=Steven Pincus|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-15605-8 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref> Significant legislative milestones in this period included the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Act of 1679]], which strengthened the convention that forbade detention lacking sufficient cause or evidence.

This was a period of profound intellectual vitality that questioned old traditions and influenced several European monarchies throughout the 18th century. In contrast to England, the French experience in the 18th century was characterised by the perpetuation of feudal payments and rights and [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]]. Ideas that challenged the status quo were often harshly repressed. Most of the [[philosophes]] of the [[French Enlightenment]] were progressive in the liberal sense and advocated the reform of the French system of government along more constitutional and liberal lines. The [[American Enlightenment]] is a period of intellectual ferment in the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen American colonies]] in the period 1714\u20131818, which led to the [[American Revolution]] and the creation of the American Republic. Influenced by the 18th-century European Enlightenment and its own native [[American Philosophy]], the American Enlightenment applied scientific reasoning to politics, science and religion, promoted religious tolerance, and restored literature, the arts, and music as important disciplines and professions worthy of study in colleges.\n\n[[File:Georg Decker Joseph II.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Austria]] was an archetypal enlightened despot and although he maintained a belief in [[absolutist monarchy]], he also championed a series of liberal reforms]]\nA prominent example of a monarch who took the Enlightenment project seriously was [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Austria]], who ruled from 1780 to 1790 and implemented a wide array of radical reforms, such as the complete abolition of [[serfdom]], the imposition of equal taxation policies between the [[aristocracy]] and the [[peasant]]ry, the institution of [[religious toleration]], including equal [[civil rights]] for Jews and the suppression of Catholic religious authority throughout his empire, creating a more [[Secularism|secular]] nation.<ref>Colton and Palmer, p. 333.</ref> Besides the Enlightenment, a rising tide of [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]] in Western Europe during the 18th century also contributed to the growth of liberal society by spurring commercial and entrepreneurial activity.\n\nIn the early 18th century, the [[Commonwealth men]] and the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]] in England, promoted [[republicanism]] and condemned the perceived widespread [[Political corruption|corruption]] and lack of morality during the [[Robert Walpole|Walpole era]], theorizing that only [[civic virtue]] could protect a country from despotism and ruin. A series of essays, known as [[Cato's Letters]], published in the ''[[London Journal]]'' during the 1720s and written by [[John Trenchard (writer)|John Trenchard]] and [[Thomas Gordon (writer)|Thomas Gordon]], condemned [[tyranny]] and advanced principles of [[freedom of conscience]] and [[freedom of speech]]. They were an important influence on the development of [[Republicanism in the United States]].<ref>Caroline Robbins, ''The Eighteenth-Century Commonwealthman: Studies in the Transmission, Development, and Circumstance of English Liberal Thought from the Restoration of Charles II until the War with the Thirteen Colonies'' (1959)</ref>\n\nIn the 1760s, the \"[[Middlesex]] radicals\", led by the politician [[John Wilkes]] who was expelled from the House of Commons for [[seditious libel]], founded the Society for the Defence of the Bill of Rights and developed the belief that every man had the right to vote and \"natural reason\" enabled him to properly judge political issues. Liberty consisted in frequent elections. This was to begin a long tradition of British [[radicalism (historical)|radicalism]].\n\n=== French Enlightenment ===\n[[File:Montesquieu 1.png|thumb|upright|[[Montesquieu]] was a prominent figure of the [[French Enlightenment]] who argued for the [[Separation of powers|separation of the powers of government]] in his  ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748)]]\nIn contrast to England, the French experience in the 18th century was characterized by the perpetuation of [[feudalism]] and [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]]. Ideas that challenged the status quo were often harshly repressed. Most of the [[philosophe]]s of the [[French Enlightenment]] were progressive in the liberal sense and advocated the reform of the French system of government along more constitutional and liberal lines.\n\n[[Montesquieu]] wrote a series of highly influential works in the early 18th century, including ''[[Lettres persanes|Persian letters]]'' (1717) and ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748). The latter exerted tremendous influence, both inside and outside France. Montesquieu pleaded in favor of [[Constitution|a constitutional system of government]], the preservation of civil liberties and the law and the idea that political institutions ought to reflect the social and geographical aspects of each community. In particular, he argued that political liberty required [[separation of powers|the separation of the powers of government]]. Building on [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|Second Treatise of Government]]'', he advocated that the executive, legislative and judicial functions of government should be assigned to different bodies, so that attempts by one branch of government to infringe on political liberty might be restrained by the other branches. In a lengthy discussion of the English political system, which he greatly admired, he tried to show how this might be achieved and liberty secured, even in a monarchy. He also notes that liberty cannot be secure where there is no separation of powers, even in a republic. He also emphasized the importance of a robust due process in law, including the [[right to a fair trial]], the [[presumption of innocence]] and [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality in the severity of punishment]].\n\nAnother important figure of the French Enlightenment was [[Voltaire]]. Initially believing in the constructive role an enlightened monarch could play in improving the welfare of the people, he eventually came to a new conclusion: \"It is up to us to cultivate our garden\". His most polemical and ferocious attacks on intolerance and religious persecutions indeed began to appear a few years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/homes/VSA/Candide/Candide.letter.html |title=Letter on the subject of Candide, to the Journal encyclop\u00e9dique July&nbsp;15, 1759|accessdate=7 January 2008|publisher=[[University of Chicago]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061013194545/http://humanities.uchicago.edu/homes/VSA/Candide/Candide.letter.html |archivedate = 13 October 2006}}</ref> Despite much persecution, Voltaire remained a courageous polemicist who indefatigably fought for [[civil rights]]\u2014the [[right to a fair trial]] and [[freedom of religion]]\u2014and who denounced the hypocrisies and injustices of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]''.\n\n== Era of revolution ==\n=== American revolution ===\n{{main|American Revolution}}\n[[File:Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States.jpg|thumb|The [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787 adopted the [[United States Constitution]] (still in effect), which established a [[Federalism|federalist]] [[republic]] with three equal branches of government]]\nPolitical tension between England and its [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] grew after 1765 and the [[Seven Years' War]] over the issue of [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]], culminating in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] of a new republic, and the resulting [[American Revolutionary War]] to defend it.\n\nThe intellectual underpinnings for independence were provided by the English pamphleteer [[Thomas Paine]].

Ideas spread most rapidly when they have found adequate concrete expression. Thus republicanism entered our Romanic/Germanic world.... Up to this point, the conviction had prevailed in Europe that monarchy best served the interests of the nation. Now the idea spread that the nation should govern itself. But only after a state had actually been formed on the basis of the theory of representation did the full significance of this idea become clear. All later revolutionary movements have this same goal.... This was the complete reversal of a principle. Until then, a king who ruled by the grace of God had been the center around which everything turned. Now the idea emerged that power should come from below.... These two principles are like two opposite poles, and it is the conflict between them that determines the course of the modern world. In Europe the conflict between them had not yet taken on concrete form; with the French Revolution it did.<ref>{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Willi Paul|title=The First American Constitutions: Republican Ideology and the Making of the State Constitutions in the Revolutionary Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTSMmWQSR7UC&pg=PA128|year=2001|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|pages=128\u201329|isbn=9780742520691}}</ref>\n\n=== French Revolution ===\n{{main|Influence of the French Revolution}}\n[[File:A Versailles, \u00e0 Versailles 5 octobre 1789 - Restoration.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[The Women's March on Versailles|march of the women]] on [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] in October 1789, one of the most famous examples of popular political participation during the French Revolution, forced the royal court back to Paris\u2014it would remain there until the proclamation of the [[First French Republic|First Republic]] in 1792]]\nHistorians widely regard the French Revolution as one of the most important events in history.<ref name=\"Frey, Foreword\">Frey, Foreword.</ref> The Revolution is often seen as marking the \"dawn of the modern era\",<ref name=\"Frey, Preface\">Frey, Preface.</ref> and its convulsions are widely associated with \"the triumph of liberalism\".<ref name=\"Ros, p. 11\">Ros, p. 11.</ref>\n\nFour years into the French Revolution, German writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Johann von Goethe]] reportedly told the defeated Prussian soldiers after the [[Battle of Valmy]] that \"from this place and from this time forth commences a new era in world history, and you can all say that you were present at its birth\".<ref>Coker, p. 3.</ref> Describing the participatory politics of the French Revolution, one historian commented that \"thousands of men and even many women gained firsthand experience in the political arena: they talked, read, and listened in new ways; they voted; they joined new organizations; and they marched for their political goals.

The first year of the Revolution witnessed members of the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]] proclaiming the [[Tennis Court Oath]] in June, the [[Storming of the Bastille]] in July. The two key events that marked the triumph of liberalism were the [[Abolition of feudalism in France]] on the night of 4 August 1789, which marked the collapse of feudal and old traditional rights and privileges and restrictions, and the passage of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in August. Jefferson, the American ambassador to France, was consulted in its drafting and there are striking similarities with the American ''Declaration of Independence.''<ref>{{cite book|author=Jon Meacham|title=Thomas Jefferson: President and Philosopher|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tvBMBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT131|year=2014|publisher=Random House|page=131|isbn=9780385387514}}</ref>\n\nThe next few years were dominated by tensions between various [[The Legislative Assembly and the fall of the French monarchy|liberal assemblies]] and a [[conservatism|conservative]] monarchy intent on thwarting major reforms. A [[First French Republic|republic]] was proclaimed in September 1792 and [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] was executed the following year. However, conflict between rival political factions, the [[Girondist|Girondins]] and the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]], culminated in the [[Reign of Terror]], that was marked by mass executions of \"enemies of the revolution\", with the death toll reaching into the tens of thousands.<ref>David Andress, ''The terror: Civil war in the French revolution'' (2005).</ref> Finally [[Napoleon]] came to power in 1799, ended any form of democracy with his dictatorship, ended internal civil wars, made peace with the Catholic Church, and conquered much of Europe until he went too far and was finally defeated in 1815. The rise of [[Napoleon]] as dictator in 1799, heralded a reverse of many of the republican and democratic gains. However Napoleon did not restore the ancien regime. He kept much of the liberalism and imposed a liberal code of law, the [[Code Napoleon]].\n\n[[File:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|left|First page of [[Napoleon]]'s [[Napoleonic code|Civil Code]] which removed inherited privilege and allowed freedom of religion]]\nDuring the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the French brought to Western Europe the liquidation of the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], the liberalization of [[property law]]s, the end of [[Manorialism|seigneurial dues]], the abolition of [[guild]]s, the legalization of [[divorce]], the disintegration of [[Ghetto|Jewish ghettos]], the collapse of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], the final end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the elimination of church courts and religious authority, the establishment of the [[metric system]], and [[Equality before the law|equality under the law]] for all men.<ref>Colton and Palmer, pp. 428\u201329.</ref> Napoleon wrote that \"the peoples of Germany, as of France, Italy and Spain, want equality and liberal ideas,\"<ref name=\"Colton and Palmer, p. 428\">Colton and Palmer, p. 428.</ref> with some historians suggesting that he may have been the first person ever to use the word \"liberal\" in a political sense.<ref name=\"Colton and Palmer, p. 428\"/> He also governed through a method that one historian described as \"civilian dictatorship\", which \"drew its legitimacy from direct consultation with the people, in the form of a plebiscite\".<ref>Lyons, p. 111.</ref> Napoleon, however, did not always live up to the liberal ideals he espoused.\n\nOutside France the Revolution had a major impact and its ideas became widespread. Furthermore, the French armies in the 1790s and 1800s directly overthrew feudal remains in much of western Europe. They liberalised [[property law]]s, ended [[Manorialism|seigneurial dues]], abolished the [[guild]] of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship, legalised [[divorce]], and closed the [[Ghetto|Jewish ghettos]]. The [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] ended as did the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

For France, however, the defeat of [[Napoleon]] brought about the [[Bourbon restoration|restoration of the monarchy]] and an ultra-conservative order was reimposed on the country.\n\n== Classical liberalism ==\n{{main|Classical liberalism}}\nThe development into maturity of [[classical liberalism]] took place before and after the [[French Revolution]] in Britain and was based on the following core concepts, namely [[classical economics]], [[free trade]], ''[[laissez-faire]]'' government with minimal intervention and taxation and a [[balanced budget]]. Classical liberals were committed to individualism, liberty and equal rights. Writers such as [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]] opposed both aristocratic privilege and property, seeing them as an impediment to the development of a class of [[yeoman]] farmers.<ref>Vincent, pp. 29\u201330</ref>\n\n=== Radicalism ===\n{{main|Radicalism (historical)|l1=Radicalism}}\n[[File:PaineRightsOfMan.png|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[Rights of Man]]'' was a manifesto for [[political radicalism]]]]\nThe [[Radicalism (historical)|radical liberal movement]] began in the 1790s in England and concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasizing [[natural rights]] and popular sovereignty. Radicals like [[Richard Price]] and [[Joseph Priestley]] saw parliamentary reform as a first step toward dealing with their many grievances, including the treatment of [[English Dissenters|Protestant Dissenters]], the slave trade, high prices and high taxes.<ref>Turner, p. 86</ref>\n\n[[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1791) provoked a response from [[Edmund Burke]], with his [[conservative]] essay ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]''. The ensuing [[Revolution Controversy]] featured, among others, [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], who followed with an early [[Feminism|feminist]] tract ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''. Radicals encouraged mass support for democratic reform along with rejection of the [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]] and all forms of privilege. Different strands of the movement developed, with middle-class reformers aiming to widen the franchise to represent commercial and industrial interests and towns without parliamentary representation while Popular Radicals drawn from the middle class and from [[artisan]]s agitated to assert wider rights including relieving distress. The theoretical basis for electoral reform was provided by [[Philosophical Radicals]] who followed the [[utilitarian]] philosophy of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and strongly supported parliamentary reform, but were generally hostile to the arguments and tactics of the Popular Radicals.\n\nImproved economic conditions after 1821, improvements in economic and criminal law and the abandoning of policies of repression led to decreasing polarisation and a more consensual form of reform politics that was to dominate in Britain for the next two centuries. In 1823, [[Jeremy Bentham]] co-founded the ''[[Westminster Review]]'' with [[James Mill]] as a journal for Philosophical Radicals, setting out the [[utilitarian]] philosophy.\n\nThe [[Reform Act 1832]] was put through with the support of public outcry, mass meetings of political unions and riots in some cities. This now enfranchised the middle classes, but it failed to meet radical demands. Following the Reform Act, the mainly aristocratic [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] in the [[House of Commons]] were joined by a small number of [[Radicals (UK)|parliamentary Radicals]] as well as an increased number of middle-class Whigs. By 1839, they were informally being called the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. The Liberals produced one of the greatest British Prime Ministers\u2014[[William Ewart Gladstone]], also known as the Grand Old Man, who was the towering political figure of liberalism in the 19th century.<ref>Cook, p. 31.</ref> Under Gladstone, the Liberals reformed education, [[Irish Church Disestablishment Act 1869|disestablished]] the [[Church of Ireland]] and introduced the secret ballot for local and parliamentary elections.\n\n==== ''Laissez-faire'' ====\n[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jeremy Bentham]]'s philosophy counseled government to adopt policies that could bestow the greatest possible social benefit]]\nCommitment to ''[[laissez-faire]]'' was not uniform. Some economists advocated state support of public works and education. Classical liberals were also divided on [[free trade]]. [[David Ricardo]] expressed doubt that the removal of grain tariffs would have any general benefits. Most classical liberals also supported legislation to regulate the number of hours that children were allowed to work and usually did not oppose factory reform legislation.<ref name=\"Richardson, p. 33\">Richardson, p. 33.</ref> Despite the pragmatism of classical economists, their views were expressed in dogmatic terms by such popular writers as [[Jane Marcet]] and [[Harriet Martineau]].<ref name=\"Richardson, p. 33\"/> The strongest defender of ''laissez-faire'' was ''[[The Economist]]'' founded by [[James Wilson (UK politician)|James Wilson]] in 1843. ''The Economist'' criticised Ricardo for his lack of support for free trade and expressed hostility to welfare, believing that the lower orders were responsible for their economic circumstances. ''The Economist'' took the position that regulation of factory hours was harmful to workers and also strongly opposed state support for education, health, the provision of water and granting of patents and copyrights.\n\n=== Liberal economic theory ===\n{{main|Economic liberalism}}\n[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Adam Smith]] argued for free trade and low levels of government regulation]]\nThe primary intellectual influences on 19th century liberal trends were those of [[Adam Smith]] and the classical economists as well as [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Smith's ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics, at least until the publication of Mill's ''Principles'' in 1848.<ref>Mills, pp. 63, 68.</ref> Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of prices and the distribution of wealth as well as the policies the state should follow in order to maximise wealth.<ref name=\"Mills, p. 64\">Mills, p. 64.</ref> Smith's economics was carried into practice in the 19th century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the [[Poor Relief Act 1662|Poor Relief Act]] that had restricted the mobility of labour in 1834 and the end of the rule of the [[East India Company]] over India in 1858.<ref name=\"Mills, p. 69\">Mills, p. 69.</ref>\n\nIn addition to Adam Smith's legacy, [[Say's law]], Malthus theories of population and Ricardo's [[iron law of wages]] became central doctrines of classical economics.<ref name=\"Mills, p. 76\">Mills, p. 76.</ref> [[Jean Baptiste Say]] challenged Smith's [[labour theory of value]], believing that prices were determined by utility and also emphasised the critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy. However, neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. [[Thomas Malthus]] wrote ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' in 1798,<ref>Mills, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> becoming a major influence on classical liberalism.<ref>Mills, p. 72.</ref>\n\n[[Utilitarianism]] provided the political justification for the implementation of [[economic liberalism]] by British governments which was to dominate economic policy from the 1830s. Although utilitarianism prompted legislative and administrative reform and Mill's later writings on the subject foreshadowed the [[welfare state]], it was mainly used as a justification for ''laissez-faire''.<ref>Richardson, p. 32</ref> The central concept of utilitarianism which was developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]] was that public policy should seek to provide \"the greatest happiness of the greatest number\". While this could be interpreted as a justification for state action to reduce poverty, it was used by classical liberals to justify inaction with the argument that the net benefit to all individuals would be higher.<ref name=\"Mills, p. 76\"/> His philosophy proved to be extremely influential on government policy and led to increased Benthamite attempts at government social control, including [[Robert Peel]]'s [[Metropolitan Police]], [[prison reform]]s, the [[workhouse]]s and [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylums]] for the mentally ill.\n\n[[File:PSM V03 D380 John Stuart Mill.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[On Liberty]]'' greatly influenced the course of 19th century liberalism]]\nBy the end of the 19th century, the principles of classical liberalism were being increasingly challenged by downturns in economic growth, a growing perception of the evils of poverty, unemployment and relative deprivation present within modern industrial cities and the agitation of [[organized labour]]. The ideal of the self-made individual, who through hard work and talent could make his or her place in the world, seemed increasingly implausible. A major political reaction against the changes introduced by [[industrialisation]]  and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] came from [[conservatives]] concerned about social balance, although [[socialism]] later became a more important force for change and reform. Some Victorian writers\u2014including [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[Matthew Arnold]]\u2014became early influential critics of social injustice.<ref>Richardson, pp. 36\u201337</ref> The New Liberalism or [[social liberalism]] movement emerged about 1900 in Britain.<ref>[[Michael Freeden]], ''The New Liberalism: An Ideology of Social Reform'' (Oxford UP, 1978).</ref>\n\n=== John Stuart Mill and liberal political theory ===\n[[John Stuart Mill]] contributed enormously to liberal thought by combining elements of classical liberalism with what eventually became known as the New Liberalism. Mill's 1859 ''[[On Liberty]]'' addressed the nature and limits of the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] that can be legitimately exercised by society over the [[individual]].<ref>Mill, John Stuart \"On Liberty\" Penguin Classics, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-14-144147-4}} pp. 90\u201391.</ref> He gives an impassioned defence of free speech, arguing that free [[discourse]] is a [[necessary condition]] for intellectual and social progress. Mill defined [[social liberty]] as protection from \"the tyranny of political rulers\". He introduced a number of different concepts of the form tyranny can take, referred to as social tyranny and [[tyranny of the majority]], respectively. Social liberty meant limits on the ruler's power through obtaining recognition of political liberties or rights and by the establishment of a system of [[constitutional]] checks.<ref>Mill, John Stuart \"On Liberty\" Penguin Classics, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-14-144147-4}} pp. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\n[[File:Thomashillgreen.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Liberal philosopher [[Thomas Hill Green]] began to espouse a more interventionist government approach]]\nGreen's definition of [[liberty]], influenced by [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Josiah Warren]], was that the [[individual]] ought to be free to do as he wishes unless he harms others.<ref>John Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873), \"The Contest in America.\"  Harper's New Monthly Magazine, Volume 24, Issue 143, pp. 683\u201384.

On one hand, there were progressive elites who sought to fuse the methods of science with liberal political economy. For example, the anthropologist and MP [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|Sir John Lubbock]] followed the strategy of using cognitive science to challenge and shape public policy. Lubbock famously applied this approach to parliamentary debates relating to universal education, the preservation of monuments and the introduction of Bank Holidays.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Politics of Cognition: Liberalism and the Evolutionary Origins of Victorian Education|journal=British Journal for the History of Science|date=2017|volume=50|issue=4|pages=677\u2013699|doi=10.1017/S0007087417000863 |pmid=29019300|url=https://www.academia.edu/31947844}}</ref> One the other hand, the Liberal Party also had a strong base in [[evangelical]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] religious elements. At Balliol College, Oxford, [[Thomas Hill Green]] argued that the state should foster and protect the social, political and economic environments in which individuals will have the best chance of acting according to their consciences. The state should intervene only where there is a clear, proven and strong tendency of a liberty to enslave the individual. Green regarded the national state as legitimate only to the extent that it upholds a system of rights and obligations that is most likely to foster individual self-realisation.<ref>Nicholson, P. P., \u201cT. H. Green and State Action: Liquor Legislation\u2019, ''History of Political Thought,'' 6 (1985), 517\u201350.</ref> The Gladstonian liberals in 1891 adopted \"[[the Newcastle Programme]] that included home rule for Ireland, disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales and Scotland, tighter controls on the sale of liquor, major extension of factory regulation and various democratic political reforms.

[[Benjamin Constant]] (1767-1830), in Switzerland, refined the concept of liberty, defining it as a condition of existence that allowed the individual to turn away interference from the state or society. <ref>Edmund Fawcett, ''Liberalism: The Life of an Idea'' (2nd ed. 2018) pp. 33-48 </ref> \n\n[[Abolitionism|Abolitionist anti-slavery]] and [[suffrage]] movements spread, along with representative and democratic ideals. France established an [[French Third Republic|enduring republic]] in the 1870s. Meanwhile, nationalism also spread rapidly after 1815. A mixture of liberal and nationalist sentiment in Italy and Germany brought about the unification of the two countries in the late 19th century. A liberal regime came to power in Italy, and ended the secular power of the popes. The Vatican, however, launched a counter crusade against liberalism. [[Pope Pius IX]] issued the [[Syllabus of Errors]] in 1864, condemning liberalism in all its forms. In many countries, liberal forces responded by expelling the Jesuit order.\n\nLiberalism gained momentum in the beginning of the 20th century. The bastion of autocracy, the [[Nicholas II|Russian Tsar]], was overthrown in the [[February Revolution|first phase]] of the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, but liberalism lasted only a matter of months before Bolshevism triumphed. The Allied victory in World War I and the collapse of four empires seemed to mark the triumph of liberalism across the European continent, including Germany and the newly created states of [[Eastern Europe]]. Militarism, as typified by Germany, was defeated and discredited. As Martin Blinkhorn argues, the liberal themes were ascendant in terms of \"cultural pluralism, religious and ethnic toleration, national self-determination, free-market economics, representative and responsible government, free trade, unionism, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes through a new body, the [[League of Nations]]\".<ref>Martin Blinkhorn , \"The Fascist Challenge\" in ''A Companion to Europe, 1900 - 1945'' (2006) edited by Gordon Martel, pp: 309-325..</ref>\n\nThe worldwide [[Great Depression]], starting in 1929, hastened the discrediting of liberal economics and strengthened calls for state control over economic affairs. Economic woes prompted widespread unrest in the European political world, leading to the strengthening of [[fascism]] and communism. Their rise in 1939 culminated in [[World War II]]. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], which included most of the important liberal nations as well as communist Russia, won World War II, defeating Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and militarist Japan. After the war, there was a falling out between Russia and the West, and the [[Cold War]] opened in 1947 between the Communist [[Eastern Bloc]] and the liberal [[Western Bloc|Western Alliance]].\n\n[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|200px|[[John Maynard Keynes]] was one of the most influential economists of modern times whose ideas, which are still [[2008\u201309 Keynesian resurgence|widely felt]], formalized modern [[liberal economic]] policy]]\nMeanwhile, the definitive liberal response to the Great Depression was given by the British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], who had begun a theoretical work examining the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pressman|first=Steven|title=Fifty Great Economists|year=1999|isbn=978-0-415-13481-1|pages=96\u2013100|publisher=London: routledge|location=London}}</ref> Keynes was deeply critical of the British government's austerity measures during the Great Depression.

It expanded rapidly during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], reaching  practically every country in Europe, as well as the British and Spanish overseas colonies.  It was especially attractive to royalty, powerful aristocrats and politicians as well as intellectuals, artists and political activists.  Its great enemy was the Roman Catholic Church, so that in countries with a large Catholic element, such as France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Spain, and Mexico, much of the ferocity of the political battles involve the confrontation between the conservatives centered around the Church and liberals who were often Freemasons.<ref>Richard Weisberger et al., eds., ''Freemasonry on both sides of the Atlantic: essays concerning the craft in the British Isles, Europe, the United States, and Mexico'' (East European Monographs, 2002)</ref><ref>Margaret C.

The Liberals formed a [[multiracial]] party that originally drew considerable support from [[Urban area|urban]] Blacks and college-educated Whites.<ref name=\"Van den Berghe, p. 56\">Van den Berghe, p. 56.</ref> It also gained supporters from the \"westernised sectors of the [[peasant]]ry\", and its public meetings were heavily attended by Blacks.<ref>Van den Berghe, p. 57.</ref> The party had 7,000 members at its height, although its appeal to the White population as a whole was too small to make any meaningful political changes.<ref name=\"Van den Berghe, p. 56\"/> The Liberals were disbanded in 1968 after the government passed a law that prohibited parties from having multiracial membership.\n\nIn India, the INC was founded in the late 19th century by [[Liberal nationalism|liberal nationalists]] demanding the creation of a more liberal and autonomous India.<ref>Hodge, p. 346.</ref> Liberalism continued to be the main ideological current of the group through the early years of the 20th century, but [[socialism]] gradually overshadowed the thinking of the party in the next few decades.\n\nA famous struggle led by the INC eventually earned [[Indian independence movement|India's independence from Britain]]. In recent times, the party has adopted more of a liberal streak, championing open markets while simultaneously seeking social justice.

Today, liberalism in South Africa is represented by the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]], the official opposition party to the ruling [[African National Congress]]. The Democratic Alliance is the second largest party in the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] and currently leads the [[Government of the Western Cape|provincial government of Western Cape]].\n\nRecently, liberal parties and institutions have made a major push for political power. On a continental level, liberals are organised in the [[Africa Liberal Network]], which contains influential parties such as the [[Popular Movement (Morocco)|Popular Movement]] in Morocco, the [[Senegalese Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] in Senegal, and the [[Rally of the Republicans]] in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. In Asia, several Asian nations have explicitly rejected important liberal principles. Continentally, liberals are organized through the [[Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats]], which includes powerful parties such the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] in the Philippines, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] in Taiwan, and the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]] in Thailand. A notable example of liberal influence can be found in India.

The new regimes were generally liberal in their political outlook, and employed the philosophy of [[positivism]], which emphasized the truth of modern science, to buttress their positions.<ref>Arturo Ardao, \"Assimilation and transformation of positivism in Latin America.\" ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1963): 515\u2013522.

Like its former master, the region was a hotbed of wars, conflicts, and revolutionary activity throughout the 19th century. In Mexico, the ''liberales'' instituted the program of ''La Reforma'' in the 1850s, reducing the power of the military and the Catholic Church.<ref name=\"Stacy, p. 698\">Stacy, p. 698.</ref> The ''conservadores'' were outraged at these steps and launched a revolt, which sparked a deadly conflict. From 1857 to 1861, Mexico was gripped in the bloody [[Reform War|War of Reform]], a massive internal and ideological confrontation between the liberals and the conservatives.<ref name=\"Stacy, p. 698\"/> The liberals eventually triumphed and [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], a dedicated liberal and now a Mexican national hero, became the president of the republic. After Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico suffered from prolonged periods of dictatorial repression, which lasted until the [[Mexican Revolution]] in the early 20th century.\n\nAnother regional example of liberal influence can be found in Ecuador. As with other nations throughout the region at the time, Ecuador was steeped in conflict and uncertainty after gaining independence from Spain. By the middle of the 19th century, the country had descended into chaos and madness, with the people divided between rival liberal and conservative camps. From these conflicts, [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda Moreno|Garc\u00eda Moreno]] established a conservative government that ruled the country for several years. The liberals, however, were incensed at the conservative regime and overthrew it completely in the [[Liberal Revolution of 1895]]. The [[Ecuadorian Radical Liberal Party|Radical Liberals]] who toppled the conservatives were led by [[Eloy Alfaro]], a firebrand who implemented a variety of sociopolitical reforms, including the separation of church and state, the legalization of divorce, and the establishment of public schools.<ref>Handelsman, p. 10.</ref>\n\nLiberal revolutions in countries such as [[Mexican Revolution|Mexico]] and [[Liberal Revolution of 1895|Ecuador]] ushered in the modern world for much of Latin America. Latin American liberals generally emphasised [[free trade]], [[private property]], and [[anti-clericalism]].<ref>Dore and Molyneux, p. 9.</ref>\n\nIn the United States, a [[American Civil War|vicious war]] ensured the integrity of the nation and the abolition of slavery in the [[American South|south]]. Historian Don Doyle has argued that the Union victory in the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365) gave a major boost to the course of liberalism.<ref>Don H. Doyle, ''The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War'' (2014)</ref>  The Union victory energized popular democratic forces. A Confederate victory, on the other hand, would have meant a new birth of slavery, not freedom. Historian Fergus Bordewich, following Doyle, argues that:\n:The North's victory decisively proved the durability of democratic government. Confederate independence, on the other hand, would have established An American model for reactionary politics and race-based repression that would likely have cast an international shadow into the twentieth century and perhaps beyond.\"<ref>Fergus M.

Revolutions spread throughout the [[Austrian Empire]], the [[German states]], and the [[List of historic states of Italy|Italian states]]. Governments fell rapidly.

Without French help, the Italians were [[First Italian War of Independence|easily defeated]] by the Austrians. With some luck and skill, Austria also managed to contain the bubbling nationalist sentiments in Germany and Hungary, helped along by the failure of the [[Frankfurt Assembly]] to unify the German states into a single nation. Two decades later, however, the Italians and the Germans realised their dreams for unification and independence. The [[Sardinia]]n Prime Minister, [[Camillo di Cavour]], was a shrewd liberal who understood that the only effective way for the Italians to gain independence was if the French were on their side.<ref>Palmer and Colton, pp. 546\u201347.</ref> [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] agreed to Cavour's request for assistance and France defeated Austria in the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Austrian War]] of 1859, setting the stage for Italian independence. German unification transpired under the leadership of [[Otto von Bismarck]], who decimated the enemies of Prussia in war after war, finally [[Franco-Prussian War|triumphing against France]] in 1871 and proclaiming the German Empire in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles, ending another saga in the drive for nationalisation.

The [[Anti-Corn Law League]] brought together a coalition of liberal and radical groups in support of free trade under the leadership of [[Richard Cobden]] and [[John Bright]], who opposed militarism and public expenditure.

[[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[James Mill]], although advocates of laissez-faire, non-intervention in foreign affairs, and individual liberty, believed that social institutions could be rationally redesigned through the principles of [[Utilitarianism]].

Russia was already reeling from [[Russo-Japanese War|earlier losses]] to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] and political struggles with the [[Constitutional Democratic Party|Kadets]], a powerful liberal bloc in the [[Duma]]. Facing huge shortages in basic necessities along with [[February Revolution|widespread riots in early 1917]], [[Nicholas II of Russia|Czar Nicholas II]] abdicated in March, bringing to an end three centuries of [[House of Romanov|Romanov rule]] and paving the way for liberals to declare a republic. Russia's liberals, repeatedly used the slogans, symbols and ideas of the [[French Revolution]]\u2014plastering ''[[libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]'' over major public spaces\u2014to establish an emotional attachment to the past, an attachment that liberals hoped would galvanize the public to fight for modern values.<ref>Shlapentokh, pp. 220\u201328.</ref>\n\nBut democracy was no simple task, and the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] that took over the country's administration needed the cooperation of the [[Petrograd Soviet]], an organization that united leftist industrial laborers, to function and survive. Under the uncertain leadership of [[Alexander Kerensky]], however, the Provisional Government mismanaged Russia's continuing involvement in the war, prompting angry reactions from the Petrograd workers, who drifted further and further to the left. The [[Bolshevik]]s, a communist group led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], seized the political opportunity from this confusion and launched a [[October Revolution|second revolution]] in Russia during the same year. The communists violently overthrew the fragile liberal-socialist order in October, after which Russia witnessed [[Russian Civil War|several years of civil war]] between communists and conservatives wishing to restore the monarchy.\n\nThe worldwide [[Great Depression]], starting in 1929, hastened the discrediting of liberal economics and strengthened calls for state control over economic affairs. Economic woes prompted widespread unrest in the European political world, leading to the rise of [[fascism]] as an ideology and a movement arrayed against both liberalism and communism, especially in [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].<ref>Heywood, pp. 218\u201326.</ref> The rise of fascism in the 1930s eventually culminated in the [[Second World War]], the deadliest conflict in human history. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] prevailed in the war by 1945, and their victory set the stage for the [[Cold War]] between the communist [[Eastern Bloc]] and the liberal [[Western Bloc|Western Alliance]].\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Liberal Party lost its influence in the early 20th century due to the growth of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. In Russia, liberalism was defeated when the Communists came to power under [[Vladimir Lenin]] in October 1917, in Italy when Mussolini set up his dictatorship in 1922, in Poland in 1926 under [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], and in Spain in 1939 after the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Before World War I, liberal parties dominated the European political scene, but they were gradually displaced by socialists and social democrats in the early 20th century. The fortunes of liberal parties since World War II have been mixed, with some gaining strength while others suffered from continuous declines.<ref>Kirchner, p. 10.</ref> The [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)|fall of the Soviet Union]] and the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] at the end of the 20th century, however, allowed the formation of many liberal parties throughout Eastern Europe. These parties developed varying ideological characters. Some, such as the Slovenian [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia|Liberal Democrats]] or the Lithuanian [[New Union (Social Liberals)|Social Liberals]], have been characterised as [[centre-left]].<ref>Karatnycky et al., p. 247.</ref><ref>Hafner and Ramet, p. 104.</ref> Others, such as the Romanian [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]], have been classified as [[centre-right]].<ref>Various authors, p. 1615.<!-- title? --></ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the comprehensive [[welfare state]] was built after the [[Second World War]].

''The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality: With two lectures by and an interview with Michel Foucault'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press (p. 92).</ref>  He especially focuses on [[Adam Smith]], [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Ferguson]].  According to Foucault, it was through a double movement, of state centralisation on the one hand and of dispersion and religious dissidence on the other, that this problem of government presented itself clearly for the first time.<ref>(Foucault 1991: 88).</ref>\n\nThe central question, or problem of government, in relation to the birth of liberalism, was how to apply the form of governance of the family, the \u2018economy\u2019, to the state as a whole. How to introduce the meticulous attention of the father within the family home and the family unit, to the management of the state?<ref>(Foucault 1991: 92)</ref>  The birth of liberalism can be located in the response to this question or problem of government. The response witnessed the shift from the dominance of sovereign power to the apparatus of the state, and can be characterised in three important developments:<ref>(Nadesan 2008: 16).</ref>\n\nLiberalism, as a \u2018rationality\u2019 of governing was, in Foucault's mind, unique from other previous technologies of governing, as it had as its foundation the assumption that human behaviour should be governed, in the pursuit of fostering the idea that society be understood as a realm separate from the state, not just something that was drawn off of and violated in order to strengthen the state.<ref>Rose, N., O'Malley, P. and Valverde, M. (2006). Governmentality. Annual Review of Law and Social Science, 2 (1), 83\u2013104 (p. 84)</ref> In a Foucauldian sense, liberalism did not emerge as a doctrine of how to simply govern people, but rather as a technology of governing that arose from the timeless critique of excessive government\u2014\"a search for a technology of government that could address the recurrent complaint that authorities were governing too much\".<ref>(Rose et al. 2006: 84).</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References and further reading ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n*  Alnes, Jan Harald, and Manuel Toscano.

It is a political movement which spans the better part of the last four centuries, though the use of the word \"liberalism\" to refer to a specific political doctrine did not occur until the 19th century. The [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688 in [[England]] laid the foundations for the development of the modern liberal state by [[Constitutional monarchy|constitutionally limiting]] the power of the [[monarch]], affirming parliamentary supremacy, passing the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] and establishing the principle of \"[[consent of the governed]]\". The 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] of the [[United States]] founded the nascent republic on liberal principles without the encumbrance of hereditary aristocracy\u2014the declaration stated that \"all men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights, among these life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\",<ref>[https://constitutioncenter.org/media/files/constitution.pdf \"The Constitution of the United States\"] (PDF).</ref> echoing John Locke's phrase \"life, liberty, and property\". A few years later, the [[French Revolution]] overthrew the hereditary aristocracy, with the slogan \"liberty, equality, fraternity\" and was the first state in history to grant [[universal male suffrage]]. The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]], first codified in 1789 in France, is a foundational document of both liberalism and human rights. The intellectual progress of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which questioned old traditions about societies and governments, eventually coalesced into powerful revolutionary movements that toppled what the French called the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]], the belief in absolute monarchy and established religion, especially in [[Liberalism in Europe|Europe]], [[Liberalism and conservatism in Latin America|Latin America]] and [[Liberalism in the United States|North America]].\n\n[[William III of England|William Henry of Orange]] in the [[Glorious Revolution]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] in the [[American Revolution]] and [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] in the [[French Revolution]] used liberal philosophy to justify the armed overthrow of what they saw as [[Tyrant|tyrannical]] rule. Liberalism started to spread rapidly especially after the French Revolution. The 19th century saw liberal governments established in nations across Europe, South America and North America.<ref>{{cite book|first=Matthew|last=Kalkman|title=New Liberalism|isbn=978-1-926991-04-7|year=2011}}</ref> In this period, the dominant ideological opponent of [[classical liberalism]] was [[conservatism]], but liberalism later survived major ideological challenges from new opponents, such as [[fascism]] and [[communism]]. Liberal government often adopted the economic beliefs espoused by [[Adam Smith]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and others, which broadly emphasized the importance of [[free market]]s and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' governance, with a minimum of interference in trade.\n\nDuring 19th and early 20th century in the Ottoman Empire and Middle East, liberalism influenced periods of reform such as the [[Tanzimat]] and [[Nahda]] and the rise of secularism, constitutionalism and nationalism. These changes, along with other factors, helped to create a sense of crisis within Islam which continues to this day\u2014this led to [[Islamic revivalism]]. During the 20th century, liberal ideas spread even further as [[Liberal democracy|liberal democracies]] found themselves on the winning side in both world wars. In Europe and North America, the establishment of [[social liberalism]] (often called simply \"[[Liberalism in the United States|liberalism]]\" in the United States) became a key component in the expansion of the [[welfare state]].<ref>[[Arthur M.

In particular, the [[Levellers]], a radical political movement of the period, published their manifesto ''[[Agreement of the People]]'' which advocated [[popular sovereignty]], an extended voting [[suffrage]], [[religious tolerance]] and [[equality before the law]]. The impact of these ideas steadily increased during the 17th century in England, culminating in the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, which enshrined [[parliamentary sovereignty]] and the [[right of revolution]], and led to the establishment of what many consider the first modern, liberal state.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oc-uXxPXfmwC|title=1688: The First Modern Revolution|author=Steven Pincus|year=2009|publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-15605-8 |accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref> Significant legislative milestones in this period included the [[Habeas Corpus Act 1679|Habeas Corpus Act of 1679]], which strengthened the convention that forbade detention lacking sufficient cause or evidence.

This was a period of profound intellectual vitality that questioned old traditions and influenced several European monarchies throughout the 18th century. In contrast to England, the French experience in the 18th century was characterised by the perpetuation of feudal payments and rights and [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]]. Ideas that challenged the status quo were often harshly repressed. Most of the [[philosophes]] of the [[French Enlightenment]] were progressive in the liberal sense and advocated the reform of the French system of government along more constitutional and liberal lines. The [[American Enlightenment]] is a period of intellectual ferment in the [[Thirteen Colonies|thirteen American colonies]] in the period 1714\u20131818, which led to the [[American Revolution]] and the creation of the American Republic. Influenced by the 18th-century European Enlightenment and its own native [[American Philosophy]], the American Enlightenment applied scientific reasoning to politics, science and religion, promoted religious tolerance, and restored literature, the arts, and music as important disciplines and professions worthy of study in colleges.\n\n[[File:Georg Decker Joseph II.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Austria]] was an archetypal enlightened despot and although he maintained a belief in [[absolutist monarchy]], he also championed a series of liberal reforms]]\nA prominent example of a monarch who took the Enlightenment project seriously was [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II of Austria]], who ruled from 1780 to 1790 and implemented a wide array of radical reforms, such as the complete abolition of [[serfdom]], the imposition of equal taxation policies between the [[aristocracy]] and the [[peasant]]ry, the institution of [[religious toleration]], including equal [[civil rights]] for Jews and the suppression of Catholic religious authority throughout his empire, creating a more [[Secularism|secular]] nation.<ref>Colton and Palmer, p. 333.</ref> Besides the Enlightenment, a rising tide of [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]] in Western Europe during the 18th century also contributed to the growth of liberal society by spurring commercial and entrepreneurial activity.\n\nIn the early 18th century, the [[Commonwealth men]] and the [[Country Party (Britain)|Country Party]] in England, promoted [[republicanism]] and condemned the perceived widespread [[Political corruption|corruption]] and lack of morality during the [[Robert Walpole|Walpole era]], theorizing that only [[civic virtue]] could protect a country from despotism and ruin. A series of essays, known as [[Cato's Letters]], published in the ''[[London Journal]]'' during the 1720s and written by [[John Trenchard (writer)|John Trenchard]] and [[Thomas Gordon (writer)|Thomas Gordon]], condemned [[tyranny]] and advanced principles of [[freedom of conscience]] and [[freedom of speech]]. They were an important influence on the development of [[Republicanism in the United States]].<ref>Caroline Robbins, ''The Eighteenth-Century Commonwealthman: Studies in the Transmission, Development, and Circumstance of English Liberal Thought from the Restoration of Charles II until the War with the Thirteen Colonies'' (1959)</ref>\n\nIn the 1760s, the \"[[Middlesex]] radicals\", led by the politician [[John Wilkes]] who was expelled from the House of Commons for [[seditious libel]], founded the Society for the Defence of the Bill of Rights and developed the belief that every man had the right to vote and \"natural reason\" enabled him to properly judge political issues. Liberty consisted in frequent elections. This was to begin a long tradition of British [[radicalism (historical)|radicalism]].\n\n=== French Enlightenment ===\n[[File:Montesquieu 1.png|thumb|upright|[[Montesquieu]] was a prominent figure of the [[French Enlightenment]] who argued for the [[Separation of powers|separation of the powers of government]] in his  ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748)]]\nIn contrast to England, the French experience in the 18th century was characterized by the perpetuation of [[feudalism]] and [[Absolute monarchy|absolutism]]. Ideas that challenged the status quo were often harshly repressed. Most of the [[philosophe]]s of the [[French Enlightenment]] were progressive in the liberal sense and advocated the reform of the French system of government along more constitutional and liberal lines.\n\n[[Montesquieu]] wrote a series of highly influential works in the early 18th century, including ''[[Lettres persanes|Persian letters]]'' (1717) and ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'' (1748). The latter exerted tremendous influence, both inside and outside France. Montesquieu pleaded in favor of [[Constitution|a constitutional system of government]], the preservation of civil liberties and the law and the idea that political institutions ought to reflect the social and geographical aspects of each community. In particular, he argued that political liberty required [[separation of powers|the separation of the powers of government]]. Building on [[John Locke]]'s ''[[Two Treatises of Government#Second Treatise|Second Treatise of Government]]'', he advocated that the executive, legislative and judicial functions of government should be assigned to different bodies, so that attempts by one branch of government to infringe on political liberty might be restrained by the other branches. In a lengthy discussion of the English political system, which he greatly admired, he tried to show how this might be achieved and liberty secured, even in a monarchy. He also notes that liberty cannot be secure where there is no separation of powers, even in a republic. He also emphasized the importance of a robust due process in law, including the [[right to a fair trial]], the [[presumption of innocence]] and [[Proportionality (law)|proportionality in the severity of punishment]].\n\nAnother important figure of the French Enlightenment was [[Voltaire]]. Initially believing in the constructive role an enlightened monarch could play in improving the welfare of the people, he eventually came to a new conclusion: \"It is up to us to cultivate our garden\". His most polemical and ferocious attacks on intolerance and religious persecutions indeed began to appear a few years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://humanities.uchicago.edu/homes/VSA/Candide/Candide.letter.html |title=Letter on the subject of Candide, to the Journal encyclop\u00e9dique July&nbsp;15, 1759|accessdate=7 January 2008|publisher=[[University of Chicago]] |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061013194545/http://humanities.uchicago.edu/homes/VSA/Candide/Candide.letter.html |archivedate = 13 October 2006}}</ref> Despite much persecution, Voltaire remained a courageous polemicist who indefatigably fought for [[civil rights]]\u2014the [[right to a fair trial]] and [[freedom of religion]]\u2014and who denounced the hypocrisies and injustices of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]''.\n\n== Era of revolution ==\n=== American revolution ===\n{{main|American Revolution}}\n[[File:Scene at the Signing of the Constitution of the United States.jpg|thumb|The [[Philadelphia Convention]] in 1787 adopted the [[United States Constitution]] (still in effect), which established a [[Federalism|federalist]] [[republic]] with three equal branches of government]]\nPolitical tension between England and its [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] grew after 1765 and the [[Seven Years' War]] over the issue of [[No taxation without representation|taxation without representation]], culminating in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] of a new republic, and the resulting [[American Revolutionary War]] to defend it.\n\nThe intellectual underpinnings for independence were provided by the English pamphleteer [[Thomas Paine]].

Ideas spread most rapidly when they have found adequate concrete expression. Thus republicanism entered our Romanic/Germanic world.... Up to this point, the conviction had prevailed in Europe that monarchy best served the interests of the nation. Now the idea spread that the nation should govern itself. But only after a state had actually been formed on the basis of the theory of representation did the full significance of this idea become clear. All later revolutionary movements have this same goal.... This was the complete reversal of a principle. Until then, a king who ruled by the grace of God had been the center around which everything turned. Now the idea emerged that power should come from below.... These two principles are like two opposite poles, and it is the conflict between them that determines the course of the modern world. In Europe the conflict between them had not yet taken on concrete form; with the French Revolution it did.<ref>{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Willi Paul|title=The First American Constitutions: Republican Ideology and the Making of the State Constitutions in the Revolutionary Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTSMmWQSR7UC&pg=PA128|year=2001|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|pages=128\u201329|isbn=9780742520691}}</ref>\n\n=== French Revolution ===\n{{main|Influence of the French Revolution}}\n[[File:A Versailles, \u00e0 Versailles 5 octobre 1789 - Restoration.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[The Women's March on Versailles|march of the women]] on [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] in October 1789, one of the most famous examples of popular political participation during the French Revolution, forced the royal court back to Paris\u2014it would remain there until the proclamation of the [[First French Republic|First Republic]] in 1792]]\nHistorians widely regard the French Revolution as one of the most important events in history.<ref name=\"Frey, Foreword\">Frey, Foreword.</ref> The Revolution is often seen as marking the \"dawn of the modern era\",<ref name=\"Frey, Preface\">Frey, Preface.</ref> and its convulsions are widely associated with \"the triumph of liberalism\".<ref name=\"Ros, p. 11\">Ros, p. 11.</ref>\n\nFour years into the French Revolution, German writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Johann von Goethe]] reportedly told the defeated Prussian soldiers after the [[Battle of Valmy]] that \"from this place and from this time forth commences a new era in world history, and you can all say that you were present at its birth\".<ref>Coker, p. 3.</ref> Describing the participatory politics of the French Revolution, one historian commented that \"thousands of men and even many women gained firsthand experience in the political arena: they talked, read, and listened in new ways; they voted; they joined new organizations; and they marched for their political goals.

The first year of the Revolution witnessed members of the [[Estates General (France)|Third Estate]] proclaiming the [[Tennis Court Oath]] in June, the [[Storming of the Bastille]] in July. The two key events that marked the triumph of liberalism were the [[Abolition of feudalism in France]] on the night of 4 August 1789, which marked the collapse of feudal and old traditional rights and privileges and restrictions, and the passage of the [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen]] in August.

A [[First French Republic|republic]] was proclaimed in September 1792 and [[Louis XVI of France|King Louis XVI]] was executed the following year. However, conflict between rival political factions, the [[Girondist|Girondins]] and the [[Jacobin Club|Jacobins]], culminated in the [[Reign of Terror]], that was marked by mass executions of \"enemies of the revolution\", with the death toll reaching into the tens of thousands.<ref>David Andress, ''The terror: Civil war in the French revolution'' (2005).</ref> Finally [[Napoleon]] came to power in 1799, ended any form of democracy with his dictatorship, ended internal civil wars, made peace with the Catholic Church, and conquered much of Europe until he went too far and was finally defeated in 1815. The rise of [[Napoleon]] as dictator in 1799, heralded a reverse of many of the republican and democratic gains. However Napoleon did not restore the ancien regime. He kept much of the liberalism and imposed a liberal code of law, the [[Code Napoleon]].\n\n[[File:Code Civil 1804.png|thumb|left|First page of [[Napoleon]]'s [[Napoleonic code|Civil Code]] which removed inherited privilege and allowed freedom of religion]]\nDuring the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the French brought to Western Europe the liquidation of the [[Feudalism|feudal system]], the liberalization of [[property law]]s, the end of [[Manorialism|seigneurial dues]], the abolition of [[guild]]s, the legalization of [[divorce]], the disintegration of [[Ghetto|Jewish ghettos]], the collapse of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]], the final end of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the elimination of church courts and religious authority, the establishment of the [[metric system]], and [[Equality before the law|equality under the law]] for all men.<ref>Colton and Palmer, pp. 428\u201329.</ref> Napoleon wrote that \"the peoples of Germany, as of France, Italy and Spain, want equality and liberal ideas,\"<ref name=\"Colton and Palmer, p. 428\">Colton and Palmer, p. 428.</ref> with some historians suggesting that he may have been the first person ever to use the word \"liberal\" in a political sense.<ref name=\"Colton and Palmer, p. 428\"/> He also governed through a method that one historian described as \"civilian dictatorship\", which \"drew its legitimacy from direct consultation with the people, in the form of a plebiscite\".<ref>Lyons, p. 111.</ref> Napoleon, however, did not always live up to the liberal ideals he espoused.\n\nOutside France the Revolution had a major impact and its ideas became widespread. Furthermore, the French armies in the 1790s and 1800s directly overthrew feudal remains in much of western Europe. They liberalised [[property law]]s, ended [[Manorialism|seigneurial dues]], abolished the [[guild]] of merchants and craftsmen to facilitate entrepreneurship, legalised [[divorce]], and closed the [[Ghetto|Jewish ghettos]]. The [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] ended as did the [[Holy Roman Empire]].

For France, however, the defeat of [[Napoleon]] brought about the [[Bourbon restoration|restoration of the monarchy]] and an ultra-conservative order was reimposed on the country.\n\n== Classical liberalism ==\n{{main|Classical liberalism}}\nThe development into maturity of [[classical liberalism]] took place before and after the [[French Revolution]] in Britain and was based on the following core concepts, namely [[classical economics]], [[free trade]], ''[[laissez-faire]]'' government with minimal intervention and taxation and a [[balanced budget]]. Classical liberals were committed to individualism, liberty and equal rights. Writers such as [[John Bright]] and [[Richard Cobden]] opposed both aristocratic privilege and property, seeing them as an impediment to the development of a class of [[yeoman]] farmers.<ref>Vincent, pp. 29\u201330</ref>\n\n=== Radicalism ===\n{{main|Radicalism (historical)|l1=Radicalism}}\n[[File:PaineRightsOfMan.png|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[Rights of Man]]'' was a manifesto for [[political radicalism]]]]\nThe [[Radicalism (historical)|radical liberal movement]] began in the 1790s in England and concentrated on parliamentary and electoral reform, emphasizing [[natural rights]] and popular sovereignty. Radicals like [[Richard Price]] and [[Joseph Priestley]] saw parliamentary reform as a first step toward dealing with their many grievances, including the treatment of [[English Dissenters|Protestant Dissenters]], the slave trade, high prices and high taxes.<ref>Turner, p. 86</ref>\n\n[[Thomas Paine]]'s ''[[Rights of Man]]'' (1791) provoked a response from [[Edmund Burke]], with his [[conservative]] essay ''[[Reflections on the Revolution in France]]''. The ensuing [[Revolution Controversy]] featured, among others, [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], who followed with an early [[Feminism|feminist]] tract ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]''. Radicals encouraged mass support for democratic reform along with rejection of the [[monarchy]], [[aristocracy]] and all forms of privilege. Different strands of the movement developed, with middle-class reformers aiming to widen the franchise to represent commercial and industrial interests and towns without parliamentary representation while Popular Radicals drawn from the middle class and from [[artisan]]s agitated to assert wider rights including relieving distress. The theoretical basis for electoral reform was provided by [[Philosophical Radicals]] who followed the [[utilitarian]] philosophy of [[Jeremy Bentham]] and strongly supported parliamentary reform, but were generally hostile to the arguments and tactics of the Popular Radicals.\n\nImproved economic conditions after 1821, improvements in economic and criminal law and the abandoning of policies of repression led to decreasing polarisation and a more consensual form of reform politics that was to dominate in Britain for the next two centuries. In 1823, [[Jeremy Bentham]] co-founded the ''[[Westminster Review]]'' with [[James Mill]] as a journal for Philosophical Radicals, setting out the [[utilitarian]] philosophy.\n\nThe [[Reform Act 1832]] was put through with the support of public outcry, mass meetings of political unions and riots in some cities. This now enfranchised the middle classes, but it failed to meet radical demands. Following the Reform Act, the mainly aristocratic [[Whigs (British political party)|Whigs]] in the [[House of Commons]] were joined by a small number of [[Radicals (UK)|parliamentary Radicals]] as well as an increased number of middle-class Whigs. By 1839, they were informally being called the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. The Liberals produced one of the greatest British Prime Ministers\u2014[[William Ewart Gladstone]], also known as the Grand Old Man, who was the towering political figure of liberalism in the 19th century.<ref>Cook, p. 31.</ref> Under Gladstone, the Liberals reformed education, [[Irish Church Disestablishment Act 1869|disestablished]] the [[Church of Ireland]] and introduced the secret ballot for local and parliamentary elections.\n\n==== ''Laissez-faire'' ====\n[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jeremy Bentham]]'s philosophy counseled government to adopt policies that could bestow the greatest possible social benefit]]\nCommitment to ''[[laissez-faire]]'' was not uniform. Some economists advocated state support of public works and education. Classical liberals were also divided on [[free trade]]. [[David Ricardo]] expressed doubt that the removal of grain tariffs would have any general benefits. Most classical liberals also supported legislation to regulate the number of hours that children were allowed to work and usually did not oppose factory reform legislation.<ref name=\"Richardson, p. 33\">Richardson, p. 33.</ref> Despite the pragmatism of classical economists, their views were expressed in dogmatic terms by such popular writers as [[Jane Marcet]] and [[Harriet Martineau]].<ref name=\"Richardson, p. 33\"/> The strongest defender of ''laissez-faire'' was ''[[The Economist]]'' founded by [[James Wilson (UK politician)|James Wilson]] in 1843. ''The Economist'' criticised Ricardo for his lack of support for free trade and expressed hostility to welfare, believing that the lower orders were responsible for their economic circumstances. ''The Economist'' took the position that regulation of factory hours was harmful to workers and also strongly opposed state support for education, health, the provision of water and granting of patents and copyrights.\n\n=== Liberal economic theory ===\n{{main|Economic liberalism}}\n[[File:AdamSmith.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Adam Smith]] argued for free trade and low levels of government regulation]]\nThe primary intellectual influences on 19th century liberal trends were those of [[Adam Smith]] and the classical economists as well as [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Smith's ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', published in 1776, was to provide most of the ideas of economics, at least until the publication of Mill's ''Principles'' in 1848.<ref>Mills, pp. 63, 68.</ref> Smith addressed the motivation for economic activity, the causes of prices and the distribution of wealth as well as the policies the state should follow in order to maximise wealth.<ref name=\"Mills, p. 64\">Mills, p. 64.</ref> Smith's economics was carried into practice in the 19th century with the lowering of tariffs in the 1820s, the repeal of the [[Poor Relief Act 1662|Poor Relief Act]] that had restricted the mobility of labour in 1834 and the end of the rule of the [[East India Company]] over India in 1858.<ref name=\"Mills, p. 69\">Mills, p. 69.</ref>\n\nIn addition to Adam Smith's legacy, [[Say's law]], Malthus theories of population and Ricardo's [[iron law of wages]] became central doctrines of classical economics.<ref name=\"Mills, p. 76\">Mills, p. 76.</ref> [[Jean Baptiste Say]] challenged Smith's [[labour theory of value]], believing that prices were determined by utility and also emphasised the critical role of the entrepreneur in the economy. However, neither of those observations became accepted by British economists at the time. [[Thomas Malthus]] wrote ''[[An Essay on the Principle of Population]]'' in 1798,<ref>Mills, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> becoming a major influence on classical liberalism.<ref>Mills, p. 72.</ref>\n\n[[Utilitarianism]] provided the political justification for the implementation of [[economic liberalism]] by British governments which was to dominate economic policy from the 1830s. Although utilitarianism prompted legislative and administrative reform and Mill's later writings on the subject foreshadowed the [[welfare state]], it was mainly used as a justification for ''laissez-faire''.<ref>Richardson, p. 32</ref> The central concept of utilitarianism which was developed by [[Jeremy Bentham]] was that public policy should seek to provide \"the greatest happiness of the greatest number\". While this could be interpreted as a justification for state action to reduce poverty, it was used by classical liberals to justify inaction with the argument that the net benefit to all individuals would be higher.<ref name=\"Mills, p. 76\"/> His philosophy proved to be extremely influential on government policy and led to increased Benthamite attempts at government social control, including [[Robert Peel]]'s [[Metropolitan Police]], [[prison reform]]s, the [[workhouse]]s and [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylums]] for the mentally ill.\n\n[[File:PSM V03 D380 John Stuart Mill.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''[[On Liberty]]'' greatly influenced the course of 19th century liberalism]]\nBy the end of the 19th century, the principles of classical liberalism were being increasingly challenged by downturns in economic growth, a growing perception of the evils of poverty, unemployment and relative deprivation present within modern industrial cities and the agitation of [[organized labour]]. The ideal of the self-made individual, who through hard work and talent could make his or her place in the world, seemed increasingly implausible. A major political reaction against the changes introduced by [[industrialisation]]  and ''[[laissez-faire]]'' [[capitalism]] came from [[conservatives]] concerned about social balance, although [[socialism]] later became a more important force for change and reform. Some Victorian writers\u2014including [[Charles Dickens]], [[Thomas Carlyle]] and [[Matthew Arnold]]\u2014became early influential critics of social injustice.<ref>Richardson, pp. 36\u201337</ref> The New Liberalism or [[social liberalism]] movement emerged about 1900 in Britain.<ref>[[Michael Freeden]], ''The New Liberalism: An Ideology of Social Reform'' (Oxford UP, 1978).</ref>\n\n=== John Stuart Mill and liberal political theory ===\n[[John Stuart Mill]] contributed enormously to liberal thought by combining elements of classical liberalism with what eventually became known as the New Liberalism. Mill's 1859 ''[[On Liberty]]'' addressed the nature and limits of the [[Power (philosophy)|power]] that can be legitimately exercised by society over the [[individual]].<ref>Mill, John Stuart \"On Liberty\" Penguin Classics, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-14-144147-4}} pp. 90\u201391.</ref> He gives an impassioned defence of free speech, arguing that free [[discourse]] is a [[necessary condition]] for intellectual and social progress. Mill defined [[social liberty]] as protection from \"the tyranny of political rulers\". He introduced a number of different concepts of the form tyranny can take, referred to as social tyranny and [[tyranny of the majority]], respectively. Social liberty meant limits on the ruler's power through obtaining recognition of political liberties or rights and by the establishment of a system of [[constitutional]] checks.<ref>Mill, John Stuart \"On Liberty\" Penguin Classics, 2006 {{ISBN|978-0-14-144147-4}} pp. 10\u201311.</ref>\n\n[[File:Thomashillgreen.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Liberal philosopher [[Thomas Hill Green]] began to espouse a more interventionist government approach]]\nGreen's definition of [[liberty]], influenced by [[Joseph Priestley]] and [[Josiah Warren]], was that the [[individual]] ought to be free to do as he wishes unless he harms others.<ref>John Stuart Mill (1806\u20131873), \"The Contest in America.\"  Harper's New Monthly Magazine, Volume 24, Issue 143, pp. 683\u201384.

On one hand, there were progressive elites who sought to fuse the methods of science with liberal political economy. For example, the anthropologist and MP [[John Lubbock, 1st Baron Avebury|Sir John Lubbock]] followed the strategy of using cognitive science to challenge and shape public policy. Lubbock famously applied this approach to parliamentary debates relating to universal education, the preservation of monuments and the introduction of Bank Holidays.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Eddy|first1=Matthew Daniel|title=The Politics of Cognition: Liberalism and the Evolutionary Origins of Victorian Education|journal=British Journal for the History of Science|date=2017|volume=50|issue=4|pages=677\u2013699|doi=10.1017/S0007087417000863 |pmid=29019300|url=https://www.academia.edu/31947844}}</ref> One the other hand, the Liberal Party also had a strong base in [[evangelical]] and [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|nonconformist]] religious elements. At Balliol College, Oxford, [[Thomas Hill Green]] argued that the state should foster and protect the social, political and economic environments in which individuals will have the best chance of acting according to their consciences. The state should intervene only where there is a clear, proven and strong tendency of a liberty to enslave the individual. Green regarded the national state as legitimate only to the extent that it upholds a system of rights and obligations that is most likely to foster individual self-realisation.<ref>Nicholson, P. P., \u201cT. H. Green and State Action: Liquor Legislation\u2019, ''History of Political Thought,'' 6 (1985), 517\u201350.</ref> The Gladstonian liberals in 1891 adopted \"[[the Newcastle Programme]] that included home rule for Ireland, disestablishment of the Church of England in Wales and Scotland, tighter controls on the sale of liquor, major extension of factory regulation and various democratic political reforms. The Programme had a strong appeal to the nonconformist middle-class Liberal element which felt liberated by the departure of the aristocratic leaders of the Liberal Party.<ref>{{cite book|author=Chris Cook|title=A Short History of the Liberal Party: The Road Back to Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1p9DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA25|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|pages=24\u201326|isbn=9781137056078}}</ref>\n\n== Worldwide spread ==\n{{main|Liberalism by country}}\n\nThe German savant [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] (1767-1835) made a major contribution to the development of liberalism by envisioning education as a means of realizing individual possibility rather than  a way of drilling traditional ideas into youth to suit them for an already established occupation or social role. [[Benjamin Constant]] (1767-1830), in Switzerland, refined the concept of liberty, defining it as a condition of existence that allowed the individual to turn away interference from the state or society. <ref>Edmund Fawcett, ''Liberalism: The Life of an Idea'' (2nd ed. 2018) pp. 33-48 </ref> \n\n[[Abolitionism|Abolitionist anti-slavery]] and [[suffrage]] movements spread, along with representative and democratic ideals. France established an [[French Third Republic|enduring republic]] in the 1870s. Meanwhile, nationalism also spread rapidly after 1815. A mixture of liberal and nationalist sentiment in Italy and Germany brought about the unification of the two countries in the late 19th century. A liberal regime came to power in Italy, and ended the secular power of the popes. The Vatican, however, launched a counter crusade against liberalism. [[Pope Pius IX]] issued the [[Syllabus of Errors]] in 1864, condemning liberalism in all its forms. In many countries, liberal forces responded by expelling the Jesuit order.\n\nLiberalism gained momentum in the beginning of the 20th century. The bastion of autocracy, the [[Nicholas II|Russian Tsar]], was overthrown in the [[February Revolution|first phase]] of the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917, but liberalism lasted only a matter of months before Bolshevism triumphed. The Allied victory in World War I and the collapse of four empires seemed to mark the triumph of liberalism across the European continent, including Germany and the newly created states of [[Eastern Europe]]. Militarism, as typified by Germany, was defeated and discredited. As Martin Blinkhorn argues, the liberal themes were ascendant in terms of \"cultural pluralism, religious and ethnic toleration, national self-determination, free-market economics, representative and responsible government, free trade, unionism, and the peaceful settlement of international disputes through a new body, the [[League of Nations]]\".<ref>Martin Blinkhorn , \"The Fascist Challenge\" in ''A Companion to Europe, 1900 - 1945'' (2006) edited by Gordon Martel, pp: 309-325..</ref>\n\nThe worldwide [[Great Depression]], starting in 1929, hastened the discrediting of liberal economics and strengthened calls for state control over economic affairs. Economic woes prompted widespread unrest in the European political world, leading to the strengthening of [[fascism]] and communism. Their rise in 1939 culminated in [[World War II]]. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], which included most of the important liberal nations as well as communist Russia, won World War II, defeating Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, and militarist Japan. After the war, there was a falling out between Russia and the West, and the [[Cold War]] opened in 1947 between the Communist [[Eastern Bloc]] and the liberal [[Western Bloc|Western Alliance]].\n\n[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|200px|[[John Maynard Keynes]] was one of the most influential economists of modern times whose ideas, which are still [[2008\u201309 Keynesian resurgence|widely felt]], formalized modern [[liberal economic]] policy]]\nMeanwhile, the definitive liberal response to the Great Depression was given by the British economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], who had begun a theoretical work examining the relationship between unemployment, money and prices back in the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Pressman|first=Steven|title=Fifty Great Economists|year=1999|isbn=978-0-415-13481-1|pages=96\u2013100|publisher=London: routledge|location=London}}</ref> Keynes was deeply critical of the British government's austerity measures during the Great Depression.

It expanded rapidly during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], reaching  practically every country in Europe, as well as the British and Spanish overseas colonies.  It was especially attractive to royalty, powerful aristocrats and politicians as well as intellectuals, artists and political activists.  Its great enemy was the Roman Catholic Church, so that in countries with a large Catholic element, such as France, Italy, Austria, Portugal, Spain, and Mexico, much of the ferocity of the political battles involve the confrontation between the conservatives centered around the Church and liberals who were often Freemasons.<ref>Richard Weisberger et al., eds., ''Freemasonry on both sides of the Atlantic: essays concerning the craft in the British Isles, Europe, the United States, and Mexico'' (East European Monographs, 2002)</ref><ref>Margaret C.

In recent times, the party has adopted more of a liberal streak, championing open markets while simultaneously seeking social justice.

Today, liberalism in South Africa is represented by the [[Democratic Alliance (South Africa)|Democratic Alliance]], the official opposition party to the ruling [[African National Congress]]. The Democratic Alliance is the second largest party in the [[National Assembly of South Africa|National Assembly]] and currently leads the [[Government of the Western Cape|provincial government of Western Cape]].\n\nRecently, liberal parties and institutions have made a major push for political power. On a continental level, liberals are organised in the [[Africa Liberal Network]], which contains influential parties such as the [[Popular Movement (Morocco)|Popular Movement]] in Morocco, the [[Senegalese Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] in Senegal, and the [[Rally of the Republicans]] in C\u00f4te d'Ivoire. In Asia, several Asian nations have explicitly rejected important liberal principles. Continentally, liberals are organized through the [[Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats]], which includes powerful parties such the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] in the Philippines, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] in Taiwan, and the [[Democrat Party (Thailand)|Democrat Party]] in Thailand. A notable example of liberal influence can be found in India.

The new regimes were generally liberal in their political outlook, and employed the philosophy of [[positivism]], which emphasized the truth of modern science, to buttress their positions.<ref>Arturo Ardao, \"Assimilation and transformation of positivism in Latin America.\" ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' (1963): 515\u2013522.

Like its former master, the region was a hotbed of wars, conflicts, and revolutionary activity throughout the 19th century. In Mexico, the ''liberales'' instituted the program of ''La Reforma'' in the 1850s, reducing the power of the military and the Catholic Church.<ref name=\"Stacy, p. 698\">Stacy, p. 698.</ref> The ''conservadores'' were outraged at these steps and launched a revolt, which sparked a deadly conflict. From 1857 to 1861, Mexico was gripped in the bloody [[Reform War|War of Reform]], a massive internal and ideological confrontation between the liberals and the conservatives.<ref name=\"Stacy, p. 698\"/> The liberals eventually triumphed and [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], a dedicated liberal and now a Mexican national hero, became the president of the republic. After Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico suffered from prolonged periods of dictatorial repression, which lasted until the [[Mexican Revolution]] in the early 20th century.\n\nAnother regional example of liberal influence can be found in Ecuador. As with other nations throughout the region at the time, Ecuador was steeped in conflict and uncertainty after gaining independence from Spain. By the middle of the 19th century, the country had descended into chaos and madness, with the people divided between rival liberal and conservative camps. From these conflicts, [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda Moreno|Garc\u00eda Moreno]] established a conservative government that ruled the country for several years. The liberals, however, were incensed at the conservative regime and overthrew it completely in the [[Liberal Revolution of 1895]]. The [[Ecuadorian Radical Liberal Party|Radical Liberals]] who toppled the conservatives were led by [[Eloy Alfaro]], a firebrand who implemented a variety of sociopolitical reforms, including the separation of church and state, the legalization of divorce, and the establishment of public schools.<ref>Handelsman, p. 10.</ref>\n\nLiberal revolutions in countries such as [[Mexican Revolution|Mexico]] and [[Liberal Revolution of 1895|Ecuador]] ushered in the modern world for much of Latin America. Latin American liberals generally emphasised [[free trade]], [[private property]], and [[anti-clericalism]].<ref>Dore and Molyneux, p. 9.</ref>\n\nIn the United States, a [[American Civil War|vicious war]] ensured the integrity of the nation and the abolition of slavery in the [[American South|south]]. Historian Don Doyle has argued that the Union victory in the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u201365) gave a major boost to the course of liberalism.<ref>Don H. Doyle, ''The Cause of All Nations: An International History of the American Civil War'' (2014)</ref>  The Union victory energized popular democratic forces. A Confederate victory, on the other hand, would have meant a new birth of slavery, not freedom. Historian Fergus Bordewich, following Doyle, argues that:\n:The North's victory decisively proved the durability of democratic government. Confederate independence, on the other hand, would have established An American model for reactionary politics and race-based repression that would likely have cast an international shadow into the twentieth century and perhaps beyond.\"<ref>Fergus M.

Without French help, the Italians were [[First Italian War of Independence|easily defeated]] by the Austrians. With some luck and skill, Austria also managed to contain the bubbling nationalist sentiments in Germany and Hungary, helped along by the failure of the [[Frankfurt Assembly]] to unify the German states into a single nation. Two decades later, however, the Italians and the Germans realised their dreams for unification and independence. The [[Sardinia]]n Prime Minister, [[Camillo di Cavour]], was a shrewd liberal who understood that the only effective way for the Italians to gain independence was if the French were on their side.<ref>Palmer and Colton, pp. 546\u201347.</ref> [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] agreed to Cavour's request for assistance and France defeated Austria in the [[Second Italian War of Independence|Franco-Austrian War]] of 1859, setting the stage for Italian independence.

Facing huge shortages in basic necessities along with [[February Revolution|widespread riots in early 1917]], [[Nicholas II of Russia|Czar Nicholas II]] abdicated in March, bringing to an end three centuries of [[House of Romanov|Romanov rule]] and paving the way for liberals to declare a republic. Russia's liberals, repeatedly used the slogans, symbols and ideas of the [[French Revolution]]\u2014plastering ''[[libert\u00e9, \u00e9galit\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9]]'' over major public spaces\u2014to establish an emotional attachment to the past, an attachment that liberals hoped would galvanize the public to fight for modern values.<ref>Shlapentokh, pp. 220\u201328.</ref>\n\nBut democracy was no simple task, and the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] that took over the country's administration needed the cooperation of the [[Petrograd Soviet]], an organization that united leftist industrial laborers, to function and survive. Under the uncertain leadership of [[Alexander Kerensky]], however, the Provisional Government mismanaged Russia's continuing involvement in the war, prompting angry reactions from the Petrograd workers, who drifted further and further to the left. The [[Bolshevik]]s, a communist group led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], seized the political opportunity from this confusion and launched a [[October Revolution|second revolution]] in Russia during the same year. The communists violently overthrew the fragile liberal-socialist order in October, after which Russia witnessed [[Russian Civil War|several years of civil war]] between communists and conservatives wishing to restore the monarchy.\n\nThe worldwide [[Great Depression]], starting in 1929, hastened the discrediting of liberal economics and strengthened calls for state control over economic affairs. Economic woes prompted widespread unrest in the European political world, leading to the rise of [[fascism]] as an ideology and a movement arrayed against both liberalism and communism, especially in [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].<ref>Heywood, pp. 218\u201326.</ref> The rise of fascism in the 1930s eventually culminated in the [[Second World War]], the deadliest conflict in human history. The [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] prevailed in the war by 1945, and their victory set the stage for the [[Cold War]] between the communist [[Eastern Bloc]] and the liberal [[Western Bloc|Western Alliance]].\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the Liberal Party lost its influence in the early 20th century due to the growth of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. In Russia, liberalism was defeated when the Communists came to power under [[Vladimir Lenin]] in October 1917, in Italy when Mussolini set up his dictatorship in 1922, in Poland in 1926 under [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski]], and in Spain in 1939 after the [[Spanish Civil War]]. Before World War I, liberal parties dominated the European political scene, but they were gradually displaced by socialists and social democrats in the early 20th century. The fortunes of liberal parties since World War II have been mixed, with some gaining strength while others suffered from continuous declines.<ref>Kirchner, p. 10.</ref> The [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)|fall of the Soviet Union]] and the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] at the end of the 20th century, however, allowed the formation of many liberal parties throughout Eastern Europe. These parties developed varying ideological characters. Some, such as the Slovenian [[Liberal Democracy of Slovenia|Liberal Democrats]] or the Lithuanian [[New Union (Social Liberals)|Social Liberals]], have been characterised as [[centre-left]].<ref>Karatnycky et al., p. 247.</ref><ref>Hafner and Ramet, p. 104.</ref> Others, such as the Romanian [[National Liberal Party (Romania)|National Liberal Party]], have been classified as [[centre-right]].<ref>Various authors, p. 1615.<!-- title? --></ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, the comprehensive [[welfare state]] was built after the [[Second World War]]. Although it was largely accomplished by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], it was also significantly designed by [[John Maynard Keynes]], who laid the economic foundations, and by [[William Beveridge]], who designed the welfare system.<ref name=\"adams\">{{Cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|title=Political Ideology Today (Politics Today)|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=978-0719060205|year=2001|location=Manchester|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/politicalideolog0000adam}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, the British Liberal Party joined with the Labour splinter [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]] to form the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]]. Following the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|general election of 2010]], the Liberal Democrats formed a [[coalition government]] with the Conservatives, resulting in party leader [[Nick Clegg]] becoming the [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime minister]] and many other members becoming ministers. However, the Liberal Democrats lost 49 of their 56 seats in the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], with their review of the result concluding that a number of policy reversals were responsible for their poor electoral performance.<ref>{{cite web|author=Campaigns & Communications Committee|title=2015 Election Review|url=https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/libdems/pages/10848/attachments/original/1455813997/2015_Election_Review_%28Final_Report%29.pdf?1455813997|website=2015 Election Review|publisher=Liberal Democrats|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn Western Europe, liberal parties have often cooperated with socialist and social democratic parties, as evidenced by the [[Purple (government)|Purple Coalition]] in the Netherlands during the late 1990s and into the 21st century.

(1991). ''The Foucault Effect: Studies in Governmentality: With two lectures by and an interview with Michel Foucault'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press (p. 92).</ref>  He especially focuses on [[Adam Smith]], [[David Hume]] and [[Adam Ferguson]].  According to Foucault, it was through a double movement, of state centralisation on the one hand and of dispersion and religious dissidence on the other, that this problem of government presented itself clearly for the first time.<ref>(Foucault 1991: 88).</ref>\n\nThe central question, or problem of government, in relation to the birth of liberalism, was how to apply the form of governance of the family, the \u2018economy\u2019, to the state as a whole. How to introduce the meticulous attention of the father within the family home and the family unit, to the management of the state?<ref>(Foucault 1991: 92)</ref>  The birth of liberalism can be located in the response to this question or problem of government. The response witnessed the shift from the dominance of sovereign power to the apparatus of the state, and can be characterised in three important developments:<ref>(Nadesan 2008: 16).</ref>\n\nLiberalism, as a \u2018rationality\u2019 of governing was, in Foucault's mind, unique from other previous technologies of governing, as it had as its foundation the assumption that human behaviour should be governed, in the pursuit of fostering the idea that society be understood as a realm separate from the state, not just something that was drawn off of and violated in order to strengthen the state.<ref>Rose, N., O'Malley, P. and Valverde, M. (2006). Governmentality. Annual Review of Law and Social Science, 2 (1), 83\u2013104 (p. 84)</ref> In a Foucauldian sense, liberalism did not emerge as a doctrine of how to simply govern people, but rather as a technology of governing that arose from the timeless critique of excessive government\u2014\"a search for a technology of government that could address the recurrent complaint that authorities were governing too much\".<ref>(Rose et al. 2006: 84).</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== References and further reading ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n{{reflist|group=lower-alpha}}\n*  Alnes, Jan Harald, and Manuel Toscano.

Valentin reacts with humor to the accident and shows off with Peppy for the cameras. The next day, Peppy finds herself on the front page of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' with the headline \"Who's That Girl?\" Later, Peppy auditions as a dancer and is spotted by Valentin, who insists that she have a part in Kinograph Studios' next production, despite objections from the studio boss, Al Zimmer. While performing a scene in which they dance together, Valentin and Peppy show great chemistry, despite her being merely an extra. With a little guidance from Valentin (he draws a [[beauty spot]] on her, which will eventually be her trademark, after finding her in his dressing room), Peppy slowly rises through the industry, earning more prominent starring roles.\n\nTwo years later, Zimmer announces the end of production of silent films at Kinograph Studios, but Valentin is dismissive, insisting that sound is just a fad. In a dream, Valentin begins hearing sounds from his environment (as does the audience), but cannot speak himself, then wakes up in a sweat. He decides to produce and direct his own silent film, financing it himself. The film opens on the same day as Peppy's new sound film, as well as the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 Stock Market Crash]]. Valentin's only chance of avoiding bankruptcy is for his film to be a hit. Unfortunately audiences flock to Peppy's film instead, and Valentin is ruined. His wife, Doris, kicks him out, and he moves into an apartment with his valet/chauffeur, Clifton, and his dog. Peppy goes on to become a major Hollywood star.\n\nLater, the bankrupt Valentin is forced to auction off all of his personal effects, and after realizing he has not paid loyal Clifton in over a year, gives him the car and fires him, telling him to get another job. Depressed and drunk, Valentin angrily sets a match to his private collection of his earlier films. As the [[Nitrocellulose#Film|nitrate film]] quickly blazes out of control he is overwhelmed by the smoke and passes out inside the burning house, still clutching a single film canister. However, Valentin's dog attracts the help of a nearby policeman, and after being rescued Valentin is hospitalized for injuries suffered in the fire. Peppy visits the hospital and discovers that the film he rescued is the one with them dancing together. She asks for him to be moved to her house to recuperate. Valentin awakens in a bed at her house, to find that Clifton is now working for Peppy. Valentin seems to remain dismissive of Peppy having taken him in, prompting Clifton to sternly remind Valentin of his changing luck.\n\nPeppy insists to Zimmer that Valentin co-star in her next film, threatening to quit Kinograph if Zimmer does not agree to her terms. After Valentin learns to his dismay that it had been Peppy who had purchased all his auctioned effects, he returns in despair to his burnt-out apartment. Peppy arrives, panicked, and finds that Valentin is about to attempt suicide with a handgun. Peppy tells him she only wanted to help him. They embrace and Valentin tells her it's no use; no one wants to hear him speak. Remembering Valentin's superb dancing ability, Peppy persuades Zimmer to let them make a [[Musical film#The classical sound era|musical]] together.\n\nNow the audience hears sound for the second time, as the film starts rolling for a dance scene with Peppy and Valentin and their tap-dancing can be heard. Once the choreography is complete, the two dancers are heard panting. The director of the musical calls out audibly, \"Cut!\" to which Zimmer adds: \"Perfect. Beautiful. Could you give me just one more?\" Valentin, in his only audible line, replies \"With pleasure,\" revealing a [[French accent]].<ref name=\"themarysue\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/cinema-scope-a-short-history-of-the-end-of-silent-film/|title=Cinema Scope: A Short History of the End of Silent Film|accessdate=13 March 2013|publisher=[[Dan Abrams#The Mary Sue|The Mary Sue]]}}</ref> The camera then pulls back to the sounds of the film crew as they prepare to shoot another take.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Jean Dujardin]] as George Valentin\n*[[B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo]] as Peppy Miller\n*[[Uggie]] as the dog, Jack\n*[[John Goodman]] as Al Zimmer\n*[[James Cromwell]] as Clifton\n*[[Missi Pyle]] as Constance\n*[[Penelope Ann Miller]] as Doris Valentin\n*[[Malcolm McDowell]] as The Butler\n*[[Bitsie Tulloch]] as Norma\n*[[Beth Grant]] as Peppy's maid\n*[[Ed Lauter]] as Peppy's first chauffeur\n*[[Jen Lilley]] as Onlooker\n*[[Nina Siemaszko]] as Admiring woman\n*[[Jewel Shepard]] as Flapper starlet\n*[[Basil Hoffman]] as Auctioneer\n*[[Ben Kurland]] as Casting assistant\n*[[Ken Davitian]] as Pawnbroker\n*[[Bill Fagerbakke]] as Policeman\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:\u00c9quipe The Artist Cannes 2011.jpg|thumb|400px|Some of the cast and crew at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]]: (left to right), score composer [[Ludovic Bource]], director [[Michel Hazanavicius]], stars [[Missi Pyle]], [[B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo]], and [[Jean Dujardin]], director of photography [[Guillaume Schiffman]] and producer [[Thomas Langmann]].]]\nDirector [[Michel Hazanavicius]] had been fantasizing about making a [[silent film]] for many years, both because many filmmakers he admires emerged in the silent era, and because of the image-driven nature of the form. According to Hazanavicius, his wish to make a silent film was at first not taken seriously, but after the financial success of his spy-film pastiches ''[[OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies]]'' and ''[[OSS 117: Lost in Rio]]'', producers started to express interest. The forming of the film's narrative started with Hazanavicius' desire to work again with actors [[Jean Dujardin]] and [[B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo]], who had both starred in ''OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies''. Hazanavicius chose the form of a [[melodrama]], mostly because he thought many of the films from the silent era that have aged best are of that genre. He did extensive research about 1920s Hollywood, and studied silent films to find the right techniques to make the story comprehensible without having to use too many [[intertitle]]s. The screenplay took four months to write and was principally inspired by the 1928 silent comedy, ''[[Show People]]''.<ref name=presskitmh>{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/Image/Direct/041179.PDF |title=Interview with Michel Hazanavicius |work=English press kit The Artist |publisher=[[Wild Bunch (film company)|Wild Bunch]] |accessdate=10 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914011421/http://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/Image/Direct/041179.PDF |archivedate=14 September 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nyu.edu/alumni.magazine/issue19/pdf/NYU19.pdf|title=The Clothes Make the Man|last=Alfuso|first=Renee|date=Fall 2012|work=NYU Alumni Magazine|access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nChief among the influences shaping the screenplay's protagonist was [[Douglas Fairbanks]].

Valentin reacts with humor to the accident and shows off with Peppy for the cameras. The next day, Peppy finds herself on the front page of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' with the headline \"Who's That Girl?\" Later, Peppy auditions as a dancer and is spotted by Valentin, who insists that she have a part in Kinograph Studios' next production, despite objections from the studio boss, Al Zimmer. While performing a scene in which they dance together, Valentin and Peppy show great chemistry, despite her being merely an extra. With a little guidance from Valentin (he draws a [[beauty spot]] on her, which will eventually be her trademark, after finding her in his dressing room), Peppy slowly rises through the industry, earning more prominent starring roles.\n\nTwo years later, Zimmer announces the end of production of silent films at Kinograph Studios, but Valentin is dismissive, insisting that sound is just a fad. In a dream, Valentin begins hearing sounds from his environment (as does the audience), but cannot speak himself, then wakes up in a sweat. He decides to produce and direct his own silent film, financing it himself. The film opens on the same day as Peppy's new sound film, as well as the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|1929 Stock Market Crash]]. Valentin's only chance of avoiding bankruptcy is for his film to be a hit. Unfortunately audiences flock to Peppy's film instead, and Valentin is ruined. His wife, Doris, kicks him out, and he moves into an apartment with his valet/chauffeur, Clifton, and his dog. Peppy goes on to become a major Hollywood star.\n\nLater, the bankrupt Valentin is forced to auction off all of his personal effects, and after realizing he has not paid loyal Clifton in over a year, gives him the car and fires him, telling him to get another job. Depressed and drunk, Valentin angrily sets a match to his private collection of his earlier films. As the [[Nitrocellulose#Film|nitrate film]] quickly blazes out of control he is overwhelmed by the smoke and passes out inside the burning house, still clutching a single film canister. However, Valentin's dog attracts the help of a nearby policeman, and after being rescued Valentin is hospitalized for injuries suffered in the fire. Peppy visits the hospital and discovers that the film he rescued is the one with them dancing together. She asks for him to be moved to her house to recuperate. Valentin awakens in a bed at her house, to find that Clifton is now working for Peppy. Valentin seems to remain dismissive of Peppy having taken him in, prompting Clifton to sternly remind Valentin of his changing luck.\n\nPeppy insists to Zimmer that Valentin co-star in her next film, threatening to quit Kinograph if Zimmer does not agree to her terms. After Valentin learns to his dismay that it had been Peppy who had purchased all his auctioned effects, he returns in despair to his burnt-out apartment. Peppy arrives, panicked, and finds that Valentin is about to attempt suicide with a handgun. Peppy tells him she only wanted to help him. They embrace and Valentin tells her it's no use; no one wants to hear him speak. Remembering Valentin's superb dancing ability, Peppy persuades Zimmer to let them make a [[Musical film#The classical sound era|musical]] together.\n\nNow the audience hears sound for the second time, as the film starts rolling for a dance scene with Peppy and Valentin and their tap-dancing can be heard. Once the choreography is complete, the two dancers are heard panting. The director of the musical calls out audibly, \"Cut!\" to which Zimmer adds: \"Perfect. Beautiful. Could you give me just one more?\" Valentin, in his only audible line, replies \"With pleasure,\" revealing a [[French accent]].<ref name=\"themarysue\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/cinema-scope-a-short-history-of-the-end-of-silent-film/|title=Cinema Scope: A Short History of the End of Silent Film|accessdate=13 March 2013|publisher=[[Dan Abrams#The Mary Sue|The Mary Sue]]}}</ref> The camera then pulls back to the sounds of the film crew as they prepare to shoot another take.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Jean Dujardin]] as George Valentin\n*[[B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo]] as Peppy Miller\n*[[Uggie]] as the dog, Jack\n*[[John Goodman]] as Al Zimmer\n*[[James Cromwell]] as Clifton\n*[[Missi Pyle]] as Constance\n*[[Penelope Ann Miller]] as Doris Valentin\n*[[Malcolm McDowell]] as The Butler\n*[[Bitsie Tulloch]] as Norma\n*[[Beth Grant]] as Peppy's maid\n*[[Ed Lauter]] as Peppy's first chauffeur\n*[[Jen Lilley]] as Onlooker\n*[[Nina Siemaszko]] as Admiring woman\n*[[Jewel Shepard]] as Flapper starlet\n*[[Basil Hoffman]] as Auctioneer\n*[[Ben Kurland]] as Casting assistant\n*[[Ken Davitian]] as Pawnbroker\n*[[Bill Fagerbakke]] as Policeman\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:\u00c9quipe The Artist Cannes 2011.jpg|thumb|400px|Some of the cast and crew at the [[2011 Cannes Film Festival]]: (left to right), score composer [[Ludovic Bource]], director [[Michel Hazanavicius]], stars [[Missi Pyle]], [[B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo]], and [[Jean Dujardin]], director of photography [[Guillaume Schiffman]] and producer [[Thomas Langmann]].]]\nDirector [[Michel Hazanavicius]] had been fantasizing about making a [[silent film]] for many years, both because many filmmakers he admires emerged in the silent era, and because of the image-driven nature of the form. According to Hazanavicius, his wish to make a silent film was at first not taken seriously, but after the financial success of his spy-film pastiches ''[[OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies]]'' and ''[[OSS 117: Lost in Rio]]'', producers started to express interest. The forming of the film's narrative started with Hazanavicius' desire to work again with actors [[Jean Dujardin]] and [[B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo]], who had both starred in ''OSS 117: Cairo, Nest of Spies''. Hazanavicius chose the form of a [[melodrama]], mostly because he thought many of the films from the silent era that have aged best are of that genre. He did extensive research about 1920s Hollywood, and studied silent films to find the right techniques to make the story comprehensible without having to use too many [[intertitle]]s. The screenplay took four months to write and was principally inspired by the 1928 silent comedy, ''[[Show People]]''.<ref name=presskitmh>{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/Image/Direct/041179.PDF |title=Interview with Michel Hazanavicius |work=English press kit The Artist |publisher=[[Wild Bunch (film company)|Wild Bunch]] |accessdate=10 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914011421/http://www.festival-cannes.com/assets/Image/Direct/041179.PDF |archivedate=14 September 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nyu.edu/alumni.magazine/issue19/pdf/NYU19.pdf|title=The Clothes Make the Man|last=Alfuso|first=Renee|date=Fall 2012|work=NYU Alumni Magazine|access-date=24 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nChief among the influences shaping the screenplay's protagonist was [[Douglas Fairbanks]].

These include 8 [[monophthong]]s /i e \u025b a \u0259 \u0254 o \u0289/, and five [[diphthong]]s /i\u0361e i\u0361\u025b i\u0361a o\u0361\u0259 o\u0361\u0254/.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Fran\u00e7ois|2005|p=460}}; {{Harvcoltxt|Fran\u00e7ois|2011|p=194}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Lo-Toga vowels\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"3\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Monophthong|Monophthongs]]\n! rowspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| \n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Diphthong|Diphthongs]]\n|-\n! |<small>[[Front vowel|Front]]</small>\n! |<small>[[Central vowel|Central]]</small>\n! |<small>[[Back vowel|Back]]</small>\n! |<small>[[Front vowel|Front]]</small>\n! |<small>[[Back vowel|Back]]</small>\n|-\n!
