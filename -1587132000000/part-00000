Following the [[Great Fire of Turku]] in 1827, the [[Royal Academy of Turku]], which at the time was the country's only university, was also relocated to Helsinki and eventually became the modern [[University of Helsinki]]. The move consolidated the city's new role and helped set it on a path of continuous growth. This transformation is highly apparent in the downtown core, which was rebuilt in the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style to resemble Saint Petersburg, mostly to a plan by the German-born architect [[Carl Ludvig Engel|C. L. Engel]]. As elsewhere, technological advancements such as railroads and [[industrialization]] were key factors behind the city's growth.\n\n===Twentieth century===\nDespite the tumultuous nature of Finnish history during the first half of the 20th century (including the [[Finnish Civil War]] and the [[Winter War]] which both left marks on the city), Helsinki continued its steady development. A landmark event was the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympic Games]], held in Helsinki. Finland's rapid urbanization in the 1970s, occurring late relative to the rest of Europe, tripled the population in the metropolitan area, and the [[Helsinki Metro]] subway system was built. The relatively sparse population density of Helsinki and its peculiar structure have often been attributed to the lateness of its growth.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Helsinki SPOT 1021.jpg|thumb|left|Parts of Helsinki and [[Espoo]] seen from the [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT satellite]]]]\n{{Main|Geography of Helsinki}}\n\nCalled the \"Daughter of the Baltic\", Helsinki is on the tip of a peninsula and on 315 islands.

Other notable theatres in the city include the [[Alexander Theatre]], ''Q-teatteri'', Savoy Theatre, KOM-theatre, and ''Teatteri Jurkka''.\n\n===Music===\nHelsinki is home to two full-size symphony orchestras, the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the [[Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra]], both of which perform at the [[Helsinki Music Centre]] concert hall. Acclaimed contemporary composers [[Kaija Saariaho]], [[Magnus Lindberg (Finnish composer)|Magnus Lindberg]], [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]], and [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]], among others, were born and raised in Helsinki, and studied at the [[Sibelius Academy]]. The [[Finnish National Opera]], the only full-time, professional opera company in Finland, is located in Helsinki. The opera singer [[Martti Wall\u00e9n]], one of the company's long-time soloists, was born and raised in Helsinki, as was mezzo-soprano [[Monica Groop]].\n\nMany widely renowned and acclaimed bands have originated in Helsinki, including [[Hanoi Rocks]], [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]], [[Stratovarius]], [[The 69 Eyes]], [[Finntroll]], [[Ensiferum]], [[Wintersun]], [[The Rasmus]], [[Poets of the Fall]], and [[Apocalyptica]].\n\nThe city's main musical venues are the [[Finnish National Opera]], the [[Finlandia Hall|Finlandia concert hall]], and the [[Helsinki Music Centre]]. The Music Centre also houses a part of the [[Sibelius Academy]]. Bigger concerts and events are usually held at one of the city's two big ice hockey arenas: the [[Hartwall Arena]] or the [[Helsinki Ice Hall]]. Helsinki has Finland's largest fairgrounds, the [[Messukeskus Helsinki]].\n\n[[Helsinki Arena]] hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]], the first [[Eurovision Song Contest]] arranged in Finland, following [[Lordi]]'s win in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=435 |title=Eurovision Song Contest 2007 Final |website=eurovision.tv |access-date=8 November 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n===Art===\n[[File:Strange Fruit Helsinki Night of the Arts.jpg|thumb|Strange Fruit performing at the [[Night of the Arts]] in Helsinki]]\nThe [[Helsinki Festival]] is an annual arts and culture festival, which takes place every August (including the [[Night of the Arts]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.festivals.fi/en/festivaalit/helsinki-festival-2/#.WCI8lzJh2Rs |title= Helsinki Festival |access-date=8 November 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n[[Vappu]] is an annual carnival for students and workers.\n\nAt the [[Helsinki Senate Square|Senate Square]] in fall 2010, Finland's largest open-air art exhibition to date took place: About 1.4 million people saw the international exhibition of ''[[United Buddy Bears]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buddy-baer.com/united-buddy-bears/world-tour/helsinki-2010.html | title= United Buddy Bears in Helsinki |access-date= 1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nHelsinki was the 2012 [[World Design Capital]], in recognition of the use of design as an effective tool for social, cultural, and economic development in the city. In choosing Helsinki, the World Design Capital selection jury highlighted Helsinki's use of 'Embedded Design', which has tied design in the city to innovation, \"creating global brands, such as [[Nokia]], [[Kone]], and [[Marimekko]], popular events, like the annual Helsinki Design Week, outstanding education and research institutions, such as the [[Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture]], and exemplary architects and designers such as [[Eliel Saarinen]] and [[Alvar Aalto]]\".<ref name=\"Worlddesigncapital.com\"/>\n\nHelsinki hosts many film festivals. Most of them are small venues, while some have generated interest internationally. The most prolific of these is the [[Helsinki International Film Festival|Love & Anarchy]] film festival, also known as Helsinki International Film Festival, which features films on a wide spectrum. [[Night Visions (film festival)|Night Visions]], on the other hand, focuses on genre cinema, screening [[horror film|horror]], [[fantasy]], and [[science fiction]] films in very popular movie marathons that last the entire night.

Another Helsinki-based media house, [[Alma Media]], publishes over thirty magazines, including the newspaper ''[[Aamulehti]]'', the tabloid ''[[Iltalehti]]'', and the commerce-oriented ''[[Kauppalehti]]''.\n\nFinland's national public-broadcasting institution [[Yle]] operates five television channels and thirteen radio channels in both national languages. Yle is headquartered in the neighbourhood of Pasila. All TV channels are broadcast [[Digital television|digitally]], both terrestrially and on cable.\n\nThe commercial television channel [[MTV3]] and commercial radio channel [[Radio Nova (Finland)|Radio Nova]] are owned by Nordic Broadcasting ([[Bonnier Group|Bonnier]] and Proventus Industrier).\n\n==Sports==\n{{Main|Sport in Helsinki}}\n[[File:2005 World Championships in Athletics 2.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Helsinki Olympic Stadium]] was the centre of activities during the [[1952 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nHelsinki has a long tradition of sports: the city gained much of its initial international recognition during the [[1952 Summer Olympics]], and the city has arranged sporting events such as the first [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships in Athletics]] 1983 and 2005, and the European Championships in Athletics 1971, 1994, and 2012. Helsinki hosts successful local teams in both of the most popular team sports in Finland: [[association football|football]] and [[ice hockey]]. Helsinki houses [[HJK Helsinki]], Finland's largest and most successful football club, and [[HIFK Fotboll|IFK Helsingfors]], their local rivals with 7 championship titles. The fixtures between the two are commonly known as [[Stadin derby]]. Helsinki's track and field club Helsingin Kisa-Veikot is also dominant within Finland. Ice hockey is popular among many Helsinki residents, who usually support either of the local clubs [[HIFK (ice hockey)|IFK Helsingfors]] (HIFK) or [[Jokerit]]. HIFK, with 14 Finnish championships titles, also plays in the highest [[bandy]] division,<ref>Video from the Finnish final 2009 against OLS from [[Oulu]]: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn-j0t5yxIE Youtube.com]</ref> along with [[Botnia-69]].

Instead Helsinki was the host of the 1952 Summer Olympics. The Olympics were a landmark event symbolically and economically for Helsinki and Finland as a whole that was recovering from the winter war and the continuation war fought with the Soviet Union. Helsinki was also in 1983 the first ever city to host the World Championships in Athletics. Helsinki also hosted the event in 2005, thus also becoming the first city to ever host the Championships for a second time. The Helsinki City Marathon has been held in the city every year since 1980, usually in August. A Formula 3000 race through the city streets was held on 25 May 1997. In 2009 Helsinki was host of the [[European Figure Skating Championships]], and in 2017 it hosted [[World Figure Skating Championships]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki2017.com|title=World Figure Skating Championships 2017|publisher=}}</ref> The city will host the 2021 [[FIBA Under-19 Basketball World Cup]].\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Roads===\n[[File:Helsinki region roads.jpg|thumb|right|Helsinki region roads]]\nThe backbone of Helsinki's motorway network consists of three [[semicircle|semicircular]] [[ring road|beltways]], [[Ring I]], [[Ring II]], and [[Ring III]], which connect expressways heading to other parts of Finland, and the western and eastern arteries of ''[[L\u00e4nsiv\u00e4yl\u00e4]]'' and ''[[It\u00e4v\u00e4yl\u00e4]]'' respectively.

Two rail corridors lead out of Helsinki, the Main Line to the north (to [[Tampere]], [[Oulu]], [[Rovaniemi]]), and the Coastal Line to the west (to [[Turku]]). The railway connection to the east branches from the Main Line outside of Helsinki at Kerava, and leads via [[Lahti]] to eastern parts of Finland and to Russia.\n\nA majority of intercity passenger services in Finland originate or terminate at the Helsinki Central Railway Station. All major cities in Finland are connected to Helsinki by rail service, with departures several times a day. The most frequent service is to Tampere, with more than 25 intercity departures per day as of 2017. There are international services from Helsinki to [[Saint Petersburg]] and to [[Moscow]] in Russia. The Saint Petersburg to Helsinki route is operated with the [[Allegro (train)|Allegro high-speed trains]].\n\nA [[Helsinki to Tallinn Tunnel]] has been proposed<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/helsinki-tallinn-tunnel-proposals-rail-link-finland-estonia | title = Helsinki-Tallinn tunnel proposals look to bring cities closer than ever | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 6 January 2016}}</ref> and agreed upon by representatives of the cities.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.citylab.com/commute/2016/01/helsinki-tallinn-rail-tunnel-baltic/423030/ | date = 7 January 2016 | title = Helsinki and Tallinn Agree to Build the World's Longest Underwater Rail Tunnel| newspaper = CityLab | author = Feargus O'Sullivan}}</ref> The rail tunnel would connect Helsinki to the [[Estonia]]n capital [[Tallinn]], further linking Helsinki to the rest of continental Europe by [[Rail Baltica]].\n\n===Aviation===\nAir traffic is handled primarily from [[Helsinki Airport]], located approximately {{convert|17|km|mi|0}} north of Helsinki's downtown area, in the neighbouring city of [[Vantaa]]. Helsinki's own airport, [[Helsinki-Malmi Airport]], is mainly used for general and private aviation.

The freezing of the sea imposed limitations on sea traffic up to the end of the 19th century. But for the last hundred years, the routes leading to Helsinki have been kept open even in winter with the aid of [[icebreaker]]s, many of them built in the Helsinki Hietalahti shipyard. The arrival and departure of ships has also been a part of everyday life in Helsinki. Regular route traffic from Helsinki to Stockholm, Tallinn, and Saint Petersburg began as far back as 1837. Over 300 cruise ships and 360,000 cruise passengers visit Helsinki annually. There are international cruise ship docks in South Harbour, Katajanokka, West Harbour, and Hernesaari. Helsinki is the second busiest passenger port in Europe with approximately 11 million passengers in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Helsinki port|url=http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1288689888898.html|access-date=31 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518110322/http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1288689888898.html|archive-date=18 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ferry connections to [[Tallinn]], [[Mariehamn]], and [[Stockholm]] are serviced by various companies.

As of 2017, the city is expanding the tram network, with several major [[Planned extension of the Helsinki tram network|tram line construction projects]] under way. These include the [[Jokeri light rail]] (replacing the 550 bus line), roughly along Ring I around the city center, and a new tramway to the island of Laajasalo.\n \nThe [[Helsinki Metro]], opened in 1982, is the only metro system in Finland, albeit the [[Helsinki commuter rail]] trains operate at metro-like frequencies.

Following the [[Great Fire of Turku]] in 1827, the [[Royal Academy of Turku]], which at the time was the country's only university, was also relocated to Helsinki and eventually became the modern [[University of Helsinki]]. The move consolidated the city's new role and helped set it on a path of continuous growth. This transformation is highly apparent in the downtown core, which was rebuilt in the [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style to resemble Saint Petersburg, mostly to a plan by the German-born architect [[Carl Ludvig Engel|C. L. Engel]]. As elsewhere, technological advancements such as railroads and [[industrialization]] were key factors behind the city's growth.\n\n===Twentieth century===\nDespite the tumultuous nature of Finnish history during the first half of the 20th century (including the [[Finnish Civil War]] and the [[Winter War]] which both left marks on the city), Helsinki continued its steady development. A landmark event was the [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympic Games]], held in Helsinki. Finland's rapid urbanization in the 1970s, occurring late relative to the rest of Europe, tripled the population in the metropolitan area, and the [[Helsinki Metro]] subway system was built. The relatively sparse population density of Helsinki and its peculiar structure have often been attributed to the lateness of its growth.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Helsinki SPOT 1021.jpg|thumb|left|Parts of Helsinki and [[Espoo]] seen from the [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT satellite]]]]\n{{Main|Geography of Helsinki}}\n\nCalled the \"Daughter of the Baltic\", Helsinki is on the tip of a peninsula and on 315 islands.

Population density in certain parts of Helsinki's inner city area is comparatively higher, reaching {{convert|16494|PD/km2}} in the district of [[Kallio]], but as a whole Helsinki's population density of {{convert|3050|/km2}} ranks the city as rather sparsely populated in comparison to other European capital cities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Geography of Helsinki, Overview of Finland|url=http://www.easyexpat.com/en/guides/finland/helsinki/overview/geography.htm|work=easyexpat.com|accessdate=5 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Helsinki&nbsp;\u2014 School of Computer Science&nbsp;\u2014 SOCS|url=http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/h/Helsinki.htm|work=[[McGill University]]|accessdate=5 February 2014}}</ref> Outside of the inner city, much of Helsinki consists of postwar suburbs separated by patches of forest.

The [[University of Helsinki]] also has many significant museums, including the [[Helsinki University Museum]] \"Arppeanum\" and the [[Finnish Museum of Natural History]].\n\nThe [[Finnish National Gallery]] consists of three museums: [[Ateneum|Ateneum Art Museum]] for classical Finnish art, [[Sinebrychoff Art Museum]] for classical European art, and [[Kiasma|Kiasma Art Museum]] for modern art, in a building by architect [[Steven Holl]]. The old Ateneum, a neo-Renaissance palace from the 19th century, is one of the city's major historical buildings. All three museum buildings are [[state-owned]] through [[Senate Properties]].\n\nThe city of Helsinki hosts its own art collection in the [[Helsinki Art Museum]] (HAM), primarily located in its [[Tennispalatsi]] gallery. Pieces outside of Tennispalatsi include about 200 public art pieces and all art held in property owned by the city.\n\n[[Helsinki Art Museum]] will in 2020 launch the Helsinki Biennial, which will bring art to maritime Helsinki \u2013 in its first year to the island of [[Vallisaari]].<ref>https://helsinkibiennaali.fi/en/</ref>\n\nThe [[Design Museum, Helsinki|Design Museum]] is devoted to the exhibition of both Finnish and foreign design, including industrial design, fashion, and graphic design. Other museums in Helsinki include the [[Military Museum of Finland]], [[Didrichsen Art Museum]], [[Amos Anderson Art Museum|Amos Rex Art Museum]], and the Tram Museum.\n<gallery widths=\"180\" heights=\"120\" caption=\"Museums in Helsinki\">\nFile:Helsinki July 2013-26a.jpg|Classical art museum [[Ateneum]] (1887)\nFile:Helsinki Kiasma.jpg|[[Kiasma]] museum of contemporary art (1998)\nFile:Sinebrychoff Art Museum building 2014.jpg|[[Sinebrychoff Art Museum]] (1842)\nFile:Helsinki Art Museum entrance 01.JPG|[[Helsinki Art Museum]] (1968)\nFile:Designmuseo I Helsinki.jpg|The [[Design Museum, Helsinki|Design Museum]] (1894)\nFile:National Museum of Finland.jpg|The [[National Museum of Finland]] (1910)\nFile:Tram museum in Helsinki-7152.jpg|Tram museum (''Ratikkamuseo'') (1900)\nFile:Sotakorkeakoulu.jpg|The [[Military Museum of Finland]] (1881)\nFile:Taidehalli Helsinki.jpg|[[Kunsthalle Helsinki]] art venue (1928)\nFile:Helsingin Luonnontieteellinen museo.JPG|The [[Finnish Museum of Natural History]] (1913)\nFile:Didrichsenin taidemuseo.jpg|[[Didrichsen Art Museum]] (1964)\nFile:Arppeanum - DSC05409.JPG|[[Helsinki University Museum]] \"Arppeanum\" (1869)\nFile:Lasipalatsi - Amos Rex 20180821 152604.jpg|[[Amos Rex]] art museum\n</gallery>\n\n===Theatres===\n[[File:Finnish National Theatre.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Finnish National Theatre]] (1902), designed by architect Onni Tarjanne]]\nHelsinki has three major theatres: The [[Finnish National Theatre]], the [[Helsinki City Theatre]], and the [[Swedish Theatre]] (''Svenska Teatern''). Other notable theatres in the city include the [[Alexander Theatre]], ''Q-teatteri'', Savoy Theatre, KOM-theatre, and ''Teatteri Jurkka''.\n\n===Music===\nHelsinki is home to two full-size symphony orchestras, the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]] and the [[Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra]], both of which perform at the [[Helsinki Music Centre]] concert hall. Acclaimed contemporary composers [[Kaija Saariaho]], [[Magnus Lindberg (Finnish composer)|Magnus Lindberg]], [[Esa-Pekka Salonen]], and [[Einojuhani Rautavaara]], among others, were born and raised in Helsinki, and studied at the [[Sibelius Academy]]. The [[Finnish National Opera]], the only full-time, professional opera company in Finland, is located in Helsinki. The opera singer [[Martti Wall\u00e9n]], one of the company's long-time soloists, was born and raised in Helsinki, as was mezzo-soprano [[Monica Groop]].\n\nMany widely renowned and acclaimed bands have originated in Helsinki, including [[Hanoi Rocks]], [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]], [[Stratovarius]], [[The 69 Eyes]], [[Finntroll]], [[Ensiferum]], [[Wintersun]], [[The Rasmus]], [[Poets of the Fall]], and [[Apocalyptica]].\n\nThe city's main musical venues are the [[Finnish National Opera]], the [[Finlandia Hall|Finlandia concert hall]], and the [[Helsinki Music Centre]]. The Music Centre also houses a part of the [[Sibelius Academy]]. Bigger concerts and events are usually held at one of the city's two big ice hockey arenas: the [[Hartwall Arena]] or the [[Helsinki Ice Hall]]. Helsinki has Finland's largest fairgrounds, the [[Messukeskus Helsinki]].\n\n[[Helsinki Arena]] hosted the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]], the first [[Eurovision Song Contest]] arranged in Finland, following [[Lordi]]'s win in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/history/by-year/contest?event=435 |title=Eurovision Song Contest 2007 Final |website=eurovision.tv |access-date=8 November 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n===Art===\n[[File:Strange Fruit Helsinki Night of the Arts.jpg|thumb|Strange Fruit performing at the [[Night of the Arts]] in Helsinki]]\nThe [[Helsinki Festival]] is an annual arts and culture festival, which takes place every August (including the [[Night of the Arts]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.festivals.fi/en/festivaalit/helsinki-festival-2/#.WCI8lzJh2Rs |title= Helsinki Festival |access-date=8 November 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n[[Vappu]] is an annual carnival for students and workers.\n\nAt the [[Helsinki Senate Square|Senate Square]] in fall 2010, Finland's largest open-air art exhibition to date took place: About 1.4 million people saw the international exhibition of ''[[United Buddy Bears]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.buddy-baer.com/united-buddy-bears/world-tour/helsinki-2010.html | title= United Buddy Bears in Helsinki |access-date= 1 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nHelsinki was the 2012 [[World Design Capital]], in recognition of the use of design as an effective tool for social, cultural, and economic development in the city. In choosing Helsinki, the World Design Capital selection jury highlighted Helsinki's use of 'Embedded Design', which has tied design in the city to innovation, \"creating global brands, such as [[Nokia]], [[Kone]], and [[Marimekko]], popular events, like the annual Helsinki Design Week, outstanding education and research institutions, such as the [[Aalto University School of Arts, Design and Architecture]], and exemplary architects and designers such as [[Eliel Saarinen]] and [[Alvar Aalto]]\".<ref name=\"Worlddesigncapital.com\"/>\n\nHelsinki hosts many film festivals. Most of them are small venues, while some have generated interest internationally. The most prolific of these is the [[Helsinki International Film Festival|Love & Anarchy]] film festival, also known as Helsinki International Film Festival, which features films on a wide spectrum. [[Night Visions (film festival)|Night Visions]], on the other hand, focuses on genre cinema, screening [[horror film|horror]], [[fantasy]], and [[science fiction]] films in very popular movie marathons that last the entire night. Another popular film festival is DocPoint, a festival that focuses solely on [[documentary film|documentary]] cinema.<ref>{{cite web|title=Helsinki International Film Festival|url=http://hiff.fi/|website=hiff.fi|accessdate=21 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=DocPoint|url=http://docpoint.info|website=docpoint.info|accessdate=21 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Night Visions Film Festival|url=http://www.nightvisions.info|website=Nightvisions.info|accessdate=21 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Media===\nToday,{{When|date=March 2018}} there are around 200 newspapers, 320 popular magazines, 2,100 professional magazines, 67 commercial radio stations, three [[digital radio]] channels, and one nationwide and five national [[Public broadcasting|public service radio channels]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n[[Sanoma]] publishes Finland's [[Newspaper of record|journal of record]], ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'', the [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] ''[[Ilta-Sanomat]]'', the commerce-oriented ''[[Taloussanomat]]'', and the television channel [[Nelonen]]. Another Helsinki-based media house, [[Alma Media]], publishes over thirty magazines, including the newspaper ''[[Aamulehti]]'', the tabloid ''[[Iltalehti]]'', and the commerce-oriented ''[[Kauppalehti]]''.\n\nFinland's national public-broadcasting institution [[Yle]] operates five television channels and thirteen radio channels in both national languages. Yle is headquartered in the neighbourhood of Pasila. All TV channels are broadcast [[Digital television|digitally]], both terrestrially and on cable.\n\nThe commercial television channel [[MTV3]] and commercial radio channel [[Radio Nova (Finland)|Radio Nova]] are owned by Nordic Broadcasting ([[Bonnier Group|Bonnier]] and Proventus Industrier).\n\n==Sports==\n{{Main|Sport in Helsinki}}\n[[File:2005 World Championships in Athletics 2.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Helsinki Olympic Stadium]] was the centre of activities during the [[1952 Summer Olympics]].]]\n\nHelsinki has a long tradition of sports: the city gained much of its initial international recognition during the [[1952 Summer Olympics]], and the city has arranged sporting events such as the first [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships in Athletics]] 1983 and 2005, and the European Championships in Athletics 1971, 1994, and 2012. Helsinki hosts successful local teams in both of the most popular team sports in Finland: [[association football|football]] and [[ice hockey]]. Helsinki houses [[HJK Helsinki]], Finland's largest and most successful football club, and [[HIFK Fotboll|IFK Helsingfors]], their local rivals with 7 championship titles. The fixtures between the two are commonly known as [[Stadin derby]]. Helsinki's track and field club Helsingin Kisa-Veikot is also dominant within Finland. Ice hockey is popular among many Helsinki residents, who usually support either of the local clubs [[HIFK (ice hockey)|IFK Helsingfors]] (HIFK) or [[Jokerit]]. HIFK, with 14 Finnish championships titles, also plays in the highest [[bandy]] division,<ref>Video from the Finnish final 2009 against OLS from [[Oulu]]: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hn-j0t5yxIE Youtube.com]</ref> along with [[Botnia-69]].

Instead Helsinki was the host of the 1952 Summer Olympics. The Olympics were a landmark event symbolically and economically for Helsinki and Finland as a whole that was recovering from the winter war and the continuation war fought with the Soviet Union. Helsinki was also in 1983 the first ever city to host the World Championships in Athletics. Helsinki also hosted the event in 2005, thus also becoming the first city to ever host the Championships for a second time. The Helsinki City Marathon has been held in the city every year since 1980, usually in August. A Formula 3000 race through the city streets was held on 25 May 1997. In 2009 Helsinki was host of the [[European Figure Skating Championships]], and in 2017 it hosted [[World Figure Skating Championships]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.helsinki2017.com|title=World Figure Skating Championships 2017|publisher=}}</ref> The city will host the 2021 [[FIBA Under-19 Basketball World Cup]].\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Roads===\n[[File:Helsinki region roads.jpg|thumb|right|Helsinki region roads]]\nThe backbone of Helsinki's motorway network consists of three [[semicircle|semicircular]] [[ring road|beltways]], [[Ring I]], [[Ring II]], and [[Ring III]], which connect expressways heading to other parts of Finland, and the western and eastern arteries of ''[[L\u00e4nsiv\u00e4yl\u00e4]]'' and ''[[It\u00e4v\u00e4yl\u00e4]]'' respectively.

Two rail corridors lead out of Helsinki, the Main Line to the north (to [[Tampere]], [[Oulu]], [[Rovaniemi]]), and the Coastal Line to the west (to [[Turku]]). The railway connection to the east branches from the Main Line outside of Helsinki at Kerava, and leads via [[Lahti]] to eastern parts of Finland and to Russia.\n\nA majority of intercity passenger services in Finland originate or terminate at the Helsinki Central Railway Station. All major cities in Finland are connected to Helsinki by rail service, with departures several times a day. The most frequent service is to Tampere, with more than 25 intercity departures per day as of 2017. There are international services from Helsinki to [[Saint Petersburg]] and to [[Moscow]] in Russia. The Saint Petersburg to Helsinki route is operated with the [[Allegro (train)|Allegro high-speed trains]].\n\nA [[Helsinki to Tallinn Tunnel]] has been proposed<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/06/helsinki-tallinn-tunnel-proposals-rail-link-finland-estonia | title = Helsinki-Tallinn tunnel proposals look to bring cities closer than ever | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 6 January 2016}}</ref> and agreed upon by representatives of the cities.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.citylab.com/commute/2016/01/helsinki-tallinn-rail-tunnel-baltic/423030/ | date = 7 January 2016 | title = Helsinki and Tallinn Agree to Build the World's Longest Underwater Rail Tunnel| newspaper = CityLab | author = Feargus O'Sullivan}}</ref> The rail tunnel would connect Helsinki to the [[Estonia]]n capital [[Tallinn]], further linking Helsinki to the rest of continental Europe by [[Rail Baltica]].\n\n===Aviation===\nAir traffic is handled primarily from [[Helsinki Airport]], located approximately {{convert|17|km|mi|0}} north of Helsinki's downtown area, in the neighbouring city of [[Vantaa]]. Helsinki's own airport, [[Helsinki-Malmi Airport]], is mainly used for general and private aviation.

The freezing of the sea imposed limitations on sea traffic up to the end of the 19th century. But for the last hundred years, the routes leading to Helsinki have been kept open even in winter with the aid of [[icebreaker]]s, many of them built in the Helsinki Hietalahti shipyard. The arrival and departure of ships has also been a part of everyday life in Helsinki. Regular route traffic from Helsinki to Stockholm, Tallinn, and Saint Petersburg began as far back as 1837. Over 300 cruise ships and 360,000 cruise passengers visit Helsinki annually. There are international cruise ship docks in South Harbour, Katajanokka, West Harbour, and Hernesaari. Helsinki is the second busiest passenger port in Europe with approximately 11 million passengers in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Helsinki port|url=http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1288689888898.html|access-date=31 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518110322/http://www.iltasanomat.fi/kotimaa/art-1288689888898.html|archive-date=18 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Ferry connections to [[Tallinn]], [[Mariehamn]], and [[Stockholm]] are serviced by various companies.

As of 2017, the city is expanding the tram network, with several major [[Planned extension of the Helsinki tram network|tram line construction projects]] under way. These include the [[Jokeri light rail]] (replacing the 550 bus line), roughly along Ring I around the city center, and a new tramway to the island of Laajasalo.\n \nThe [[Helsinki Metro]], opened in 1982, is the only metro system in Finland, albeit the [[Helsinki commuter rail]] trains operate at metro-like frequencies.

{"title_page": "Squares in London", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n[[File:Sutton Nicholls's view of St. James's Square, c. 1722.jpg|thumb|250px|St. James's Square, c. 1722]]\n[[File:Fitzroy Square from the BT Tower.jpg|thumb|Fitzroy Square]]\n'''Squares''' have long been a feature of '''[[London]]''' and come in numerous identifiable forms. The landscaping spectrum of squares stretches from those containing more [[hardscape]] constituting [[town square]]s (also known as city squares) to those containing planted [[communal gardens]], for which London is a major international exponent, known as [[garden square]]s.  \n\nA few in the capital of the [[United Kingdom]] such as [[Trafalgar Square]] were from the outset ''public'' open spaces in exactly the same way as other city squares worldwide, typically a ''plaza'', ''piazza'' and a ''platz'' in Spain, Italy and Germany. Most, however, were garden squares that were originally built as private communal gardens for use by the inhabitants of the surrounding houses. All types of the space are more prevalent in parts of London with high (urban) density. Some of these gardens are now open to the public, while others, for example around [[Notting Hill]], are railed (a form of fencing) and private.\n\nThe terminology has been loosely applied for over a century.  Some have irregular shape &mdash; five triangles, a pentagon, hexagon, octagon and oval being among those officially named ''Square''. Approbative and technical studies of garden squares commonly cover equivalent landscaped communal gardens not named as a ''Square'' many of which spaces have become small public parks &mdash; a diversity of descriptive names features at [[List of garden squares in London|the list of London's \"garden squares\"]].\n\n==Name and shape==\n\"Square\" is a generic term for neat, planned or set aside urban open spaces larger than a verge or pavement overlooked by buildings. In London elements of fields were set aside, a fact reflected in the name of the square [[London Fields]] and two later examples: [[Coram's Fields]] and [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]].  Some are not actually square, or even rectangular. One reason for this is the use of a local nickname for the street, park or garden in question. Another is that some older squares were irregularly shaped to begin with, or lost their original layout due to the city's many transformations, not least following the [[Great Fire of London]] and [[The Blitz]].\n\nThe street naming (or streetnaming) authority of each [[London Borough]] and the [[City of London Corporation]] by authority of an Act of 1939 imposes rules to authorise appropriate street names for new developments and for owners wishing to rename features.<ref>London Buildings Acts (Amendment) Act 1939, Part 2: Naming and Numbering of Streets and Buildings.</ref>  Commercial building and retained historic names apart, new residential squares must in many boroughs be \"for a square only\" &mdash; considered not well elongated but rectangular and to some extent open.<ref>[https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/sites/default/files/atoms/files/New%20Application%20Pack.pdf Street Naming application pack] Example policy list from Kensington and Chelsea, replacing similar earlier rule. Retrieved 2018-03-12</ref>  Billiter Square, EC3 and Millennium Square, SE1 in districts dominated by retail, commerce and offices are among many modern buildings (not beside a visible rectangular open space) which have alternative, higher built density, square features to their design, such as a courtyard or a square footprint.\n\nSome squares are paved ([[Granary Square]]); some grass and trees ([[Russell Square]]); many others diverse communal gardens. Most of those which are square have the word in their name and these are listed below; others more flexibly identified do not; such notable lists are commonly identified as [[List of garden squares in London|list of garden squares]] or \"estate gardens\", \"communal gardens\", \"formal gardens\" about which many books have been written. Increasingly, spaces are being constructed that are [[Privately owned public space|legally private, although in practice open to the public]] ([[Paternoster Square]]). \n\nThe [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]] contains over a hundred garden squares whose use is restricted to residents. The upkeep of these spaces (almost all named after their adjoining streets for example Square/Crescent/Gardens/Place) is partly paid for through a levy on top of residents' [[council tax]].<ref>[http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/gardensquares/general/default.asp \"Your garden square and you\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711162431/http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/gardensquares/general/default.asp |date=2006-07-11 }}, [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]], London, UK. URL accessed 20 June 2006.</ref> One instance is a [[lens (geometry)|lens]] (pointed oval), [[The Boltons]].\n\nToward the public end of the public/private continuum, London's growth has taken in [[village green]]s. A minority of these partly or wholly survive such as [[Newington Green]] to form council-run open spaces breaking up housing, road networks and/or retail streets. The categories of greens and garden squares become more well-visited scaled up, above an informal cut-off, being the today mainly government-run, characteristic [[parks and open spaces in London]] &mdash; less urban such land includes London's 26 [[list of common land in London|commons]] most of which were significantly reduced in size in the period of [[Inclosure]] and 16 country parks.\n\n==History==\n===Development of Squares===\nThe making of residential squares fell into decline in the early 20th century, one of the last notable such squares having been designed by [[Edwin Lutyens]] for [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]]. Numerous squares were in danger of filling in for further building. This was banned by the [[London Squares Act of 1931]].{{clarify|there is no matching statute listed in the Acts of Parl. of United Kingdom - which Part of which Act does this refer to?|date=March 2018}}<ref name=Phelps>Camilla Phelps, \"London opens its gates\". ''The English Garden'', June 2013, 97.</ref> In the last quarter of the 20th century a fashion for making office squares developed, a trend led by the [[Broadgate]] development. Developers such as London Square, [[Berkeley Homes]] and [[Taylor Wimpey]] (in the first two instances through their London subsidiaries) have built and set aside land in more than one of their 21st century London developments to create those of the residential type.<ref>[http://londonsquare.co.uk/developments/detail/fulham \"Square\"] Details of 21st century square, at Farm Lane, Fulham, London Square Group, 2018</ref><ref>[http://londonsquare.co.uk/developments/detail/teddington \"Square\"\"] Details of 21st century square at Waldegrave Road, Teddington, London Square Group, 2018</ref><ref>[http://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/new-homes/london/orpington/brunswick-square \"Brunswick Square, Orpington\"] Berkeley Homes Group, 2018</ref><ref>[https://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/new-homes/london/kensington/royal-warwick-square \"Royal Warwick Square, Kensington\"], Berkeley Homes Group, 2018</ref><ref>[http://www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/find-your-home/england/london/harrow/st-georges-square \"St George's Square, Sudbury Hill, Harrow\"] Taylor Wimpey, 2018</ref><ref>[http://www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/find-your-home/england/london/surbiton/tolworth-square \"Tolworth Square, Surbiton\"] Taylor Wimpey, 2018</ref> More broadly, [[mixed-use]] squares to give a focal area have become a resurgent planning design, reflected for instance in Times Square, [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] and [[Canada Square]], [[Canary Wharf]].\n\n===Viewings and events in private communal gardens===\n{{See also|List of garden squares in London}}\nSince 1998 many private squares (which term in that context takes in many other shapes of gardens between houses) temporarily open to the paying public: London's \"Open Garden Squares Weekend\", founded by Caroline Aldiss, takes place on the second weekend in June.<ref>Phelps, \"London opens its gates\". ''The English Garden'', June 2013, 95\u201398.</ref> The event is organised by the [[London Parks and Garden Trust]]. In 2013 over 200 gardens took part, including the garden of the [[Prime Minister]] at [[10 Downing Street]] and the Gardens of [[HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs]]. Other events in keynote squares coincide such as a World Archaeology Festival, [[Gordon Square]], Bloomsbury run by [[UCL Institute of Archaeology]].<ref>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/calendar/articles/20130608 \"World Archaeology Festival 2013\"], UCL.</ref>\n\nThe parks can be categorised as public garden squares, private [[garden square]]s or other squares.\n\n===Social importance===\n[[File:Was that a dream by Cedric Le Borgne.jpg|thumb|An illuminated wire sculpture of a nightingale, displayed in London's [[Berkeley Square]] as part of [[:w:Lumiere festival|Lumiere London 2018]], an art festival.

Initially cultural use was mainly confined to novels and, to a lesser degree, fine art. \n\n\"[[It's a Long Way to Tipperary]]\" is a 1910s song featuring the line \"Farewell [[Leicester Square]]\". \"[[A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square]]\" is a romantic [[popular song|hit]] of 1940 with lyrics by [[Eric Maschwitz]] and music by [[Manning Sherwin]], sang that year separately by [[Ray Noble (musician)|Ray Noble]] and [[Vera Lynn]] and a theme of a film the next year, by [[Fritz Lang]]., ''[[Man Hunt (1941 film)|Man Hunt]]''.  In the 1956 song \"Why Can't The English?\" from the musical ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', Professor Henry Higgins laments, \"Hear them down in Soho Square/Dropping H's everywhere.\"\n\nDrama most notably includes the high-audience [[soap opera]] broadcast by the [[BBC]] running since 1985, ''[[EastEnders]]'' based on a semi-permanent set north of London's border, [[Albert Square]]. It had pre-release titles ''Square Dance, Round the Square, Round the Houses, London Pride'' and ''East 8''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Rupert|title=EastEnders: 20 Years in Albert Square|publisher=BBC Books|year=2005|isbn=978-0-563-52165-5|format=Hardback|page=15}}</ref>\n\n[[Soho Square]] garden contains a bench that commemorates the singer [[Kirsty MacColl]], who wrote the song \"Soho Square\" for her album ''[[Titanic Days]]''.

The landscaping spectrum of squares stretches from those containing more [[hardscape]] constituting [[town square]]s (also known as city squares) to those containing planted [[communal gardens]], for which London is a major international exponent, known as [[garden square]]s.  \n\nA few in the capital of the [[United Kingdom]] such as [[Trafalgar Square]] were from the outset ''public'' open spaces in exactly the same way as other city squares worldwide, typically a ''plaza'', ''piazza'' and a ''platz'' in Spain, Italy and Germany. Most, however, were garden squares that were originally built as private communal gardens for use by the inhabitants of the surrounding houses. All types of the space are more prevalent in parts of London with high (urban) density. Some of these gardens are now open to the public, while others, for example around [[Notting Hill]], are railed (a form of fencing) and private.\n\nThe terminology has been loosely applied for over a century.  Some have irregular shape &mdash; five triangles, a pentagon, hexagon, octagon and oval being among those officially named ''Square''. Approbative and technical studies of garden squares commonly cover equivalent landscaped communal gardens not named as a ''Square'' many of which spaces have become small public parks &mdash; a diversity of descriptive names features at [[List of garden squares in London|the list of London's \"garden squares\"]].\n\n==Name and shape==\n\"Square\" is a generic term for neat, planned or set aside urban open spaces larger than a verge or pavement overlooked by buildings. In London elements of fields were set aside, a fact reflected in the name of the square [[London Fields]] and two later examples: [[Coram's Fields]] and [[Lincoln's Inn Fields]].  Some are not actually square, or even rectangular. One reason for this is the use of a local nickname for the street, park or garden in question. Another is that some older squares were irregularly shaped to begin with, or lost their original layout due to the city's many transformations, not least following the [[Great Fire of London]] and [[The Blitz]].\n\nThe street naming (or streetnaming) authority of each [[London Borough]] and the [[City of London Corporation]] by authority of an Act of 1939 imposes rules to authorise appropriate street names for new developments and for owners wishing to rename features.<ref>London Buildings Acts (Amendment) Act 1939, Part 2: Naming and Numbering of Streets and Buildings.</ref>  Commercial building and retained historic names apart, new residential squares must in many boroughs be \"for a square only\" &mdash; considered not well elongated but rectangular and to some extent open.<ref>[https://www.rbkc.gov.uk/sites/default/files/atoms/files/New%20Application%20Pack.pdf Street Naming application pack] Example policy list from Kensington and Chelsea, replacing similar earlier rule. Retrieved 2018-03-12</ref>  Billiter Square, EC3 and Millennium Square, SE1 in districts dominated by retail, commerce and offices are among many modern buildings (not beside a visible rectangular open space) which have alternative, higher built density, square features to their design, such as a courtyard or a square footprint.\n\nSome squares are paved ([[Granary Square]]); some grass and trees ([[Russell Square]]); many others diverse communal gardens. Most of those which are square have the word in their name and these are listed below; others more flexibly identified do not; such notable lists are commonly identified as [[List of garden squares in London|list of garden squares]] or \"estate gardens\", \"communal gardens\", \"formal gardens\" about which many books have been written. Increasingly, spaces are being constructed that are [[Privately owned public space|legally private, although in practice open to the public]] ([[Paternoster Square]]). \n\nThe [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]] contains over a hundred garden squares whose use is restricted to residents. The upkeep of these spaces (almost all named after their adjoining streets for example Square/Crescent/Gardens/Place) is partly paid for through a levy on top of residents' [[council tax]].<ref>[http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/gardensquares/general/default.asp \"Your garden square and you\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711162431/http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/gardensquares/general/default.asp |date=2006-07-11 }}, [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]], London, UK. URL accessed 20 June 2006.</ref> One instance is a [[lens (geometry)|lens]] (pointed oval), [[The Boltons]].\n\nToward the public end of the public/private continuum, London's growth has taken in [[village green]]s. A minority of these partly or wholly survive such as [[Newington Green]] to form council-run open spaces breaking up housing, road networks and/or retail streets. The categories of greens and garden squares become more well-visited scaled up, above an informal cut-off, being the today mainly government-run, characteristic [[parks and open spaces in London]] &mdash; less urban such land includes London's 26 [[list of common land in London|commons]] most of which were significantly reduced in size in the period of [[Inclosure]] and 16 country parks.\n\n==History==\n===Development of Squares===\nThe making of residential squares fell into decline in the early 20th century, one of the last notable such squares having been designed by [[Edwin Lutyens]] for [[Hampstead Garden Suburb]]. Numerous squares were in danger of filling in for further building. This was banned by the [[London Squares Act of 1931]].{{clarify|there is no matching statute listed in the Acts of Parl. of United Kingdom - which Part of which Act does this refer to?|date=March 2018}}<ref name=Phelps>Camilla Phelps, \"London opens its gates\". ''The English Garden'', June 2013, 97.</ref> In the last quarter of the 20th century a fashion for making office squares developed, a trend led by the [[Broadgate]] development. Developers such as London Square, [[Berkeley Homes]] and [[Taylor Wimpey]] (in the first two instances through their London subsidiaries) have built and set aside land in more than one of their 21st century London developments to create those of the residential type.<ref>[http://londonsquare.co.uk/developments/detail/fulham \"Square\"] Details of 21st century square, at Farm Lane, Fulham, London Square Group, 2018</ref><ref>[http://londonsquare.co.uk/developments/detail/teddington \"Square\"\"] Details of 21st century square at Waldegrave Road, Teddington, London Square Group, 2018</ref><ref>[http://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/new-homes/london/orpington/brunswick-square \"Brunswick Square, Orpington\"] Berkeley Homes Group, 2018</ref><ref>[https://www.berkeleygroup.co.uk/new-homes/london/kensington/royal-warwick-square \"Royal Warwick Square, Kensington\"], Berkeley Homes Group, 2018</ref><ref>[http://www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/find-your-home/england/london/harrow/st-georges-square \"St George's Square, Sudbury Hill, Harrow\"] Taylor Wimpey, 2018</ref><ref>[http://www.taylorwimpey.co.uk/find-your-home/england/london/surbiton/tolworth-square \"Tolworth Square, Surbiton\"] Taylor Wimpey, 2018</ref> More broadly, [[mixed-use]] squares to give a focal area have become a resurgent planning design, reflected for instance in Times Square, [[Sutton, London|Sutton]] and [[Canada Square]], [[Canary Wharf]].\n\n===Viewings and events in private communal gardens===\n{{See also|List of garden squares in London}}\nSince 1998 many private squares (which term in that context takes in many other shapes of gardens between houses) temporarily open to the paying public: London's \"Open Garden Squares Weekend\", founded by Caroline Aldiss, takes place on the second weekend in June.<ref>Phelps, \"London opens its gates\". ''The English Garden'', June 2013, 95\u201398.</ref> The event is organised by the [[London Parks and Garden Trust]]. In 2013 over 200 gardens took part, including the garden of the [[Prime Minister]] at [[10 Downing Street]] and the Gardens of [[HM Prison Wormwood Scrubs]]. Other events in keynote squares coincide such as a World Archaeology Festival, [[Gordon Square]], Bloomsbury run by [[UCL Institute of Archaeology]].<ref>[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/archaeology/calendar/articles/20130608 \"World Archaeology Festival 2013\"], UCL.</ref>\n\nThe parks can be categorised as public garden squares, private [[garden square]]s or other squares.\n\n===Social importance===\n[[File:Was that a dream by Cedric Le Borgne.jpg|thumb|An illuminated wire sculpture of a nightingale, displayed in London's [[Berkeley Square]] as part of [[:w:Lumiere festival|Lumiere London 2018]], an art festival.

Initially cultural use was mainly confined to novels and, to a lesser degree, fine art. \n\n\"[[It's a Long Way to Tipperary]]\" is a 1910s song featuring the line \"Farewell [[Leicester Square]]\". \"[[A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square]]\" is a romantic [[popular song|hit]] of 1940 with lyrics by [[Eric Maschwitz]] and music by [[Manning Sherwin]], sang that year separately by [[Ray Noble (musician)|Ray Noble]] and [[Vera Lynn]] and a theme of a film the next year, by [[Fritz Lang]]., ''[[Man Hunt (1941 film)|Man Hunt]]''.  In the 1956 song \"Why Can't The English?\" from the musical ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', Professor Henry Higgins laments, \"Hear them down in Soho Square/Dropping H's everywhere.\"\n\nDrama most notably includes the high-audience [[soap opera]] broadcast by the [[BBC]] running since 1985, ''[[EastEnders]]'' based on a semi-permanent set north of London's border, [[Albert Square]]. It had pre-release titles ''Square Dance, Round the Square, Round the Houses, London Pride'' and ''East 8''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Smith|first=Rupert|title=EastEnders: 20 Years in Albert Square|publisher=BBC Books|year=2005|isbn=978-0-563-52165-5|format=Hardback|page=15}}</ref>\n\n[[Soho Square]] garden contains a bench that commemorates the singer [[Kirsty MacColl]], who wrote the song \"Soho Square\" for her album ''[[Titanic Days]]''.

Although this was not part of the college, it was used extensively by members of the college, acting as a reference library for items departmental collections did not cover.<ref name=hg>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2BpqDQAAQBAJ|title=The History of Imperial College London, 1907\u20132007|pages=18,21\u201322,69, 99,102,188,207,306,418|first=Hannah|last=Gay|date=2007|publisher=Imperial College Press|isbn=9781860947087}}</ref>{{rp|18, 21\u201322, 69, 306}}\n\n[[File:Lyon Playfair Bookplate, Imperial College.jpg|thumb|upright=0.63|left|Bookplate from the Lyon Playfair Library]]\n\nFor most of the early 20th century the college's collection was spread out over the various constituent colleges and departments.

This article uses this latter pair of definitions.\n\nbye\n\n==Cause==\nThe major [[force]]s that accelerate a vehicle occur at the [[tire]]s' [[contact patch]]es.  Since these forces are not directed through the vehicle's CoM, one or more [[Moment (physics)|moments]] are generated whose forces are the tires' traction forces at pavement level, the other one (equal but opposed) is the mass inertia located at the CoM and the moment arm is the distance from pavement surface to CoM. It is these moments that cause variation in the load distributed between the tires.  Often this is interpreted by the casual [[observation|observer]] as a pitching or rolling motion of the vehicles body.  A perfectly rigid vehicle without suspension that would not exhibit pitching or rolling of the body still undergoes load transfer. However, the pitching and rolling of the body of a non-rigid vehicle adds some (small) [[#Weight transfer|weight transfer]] due to the (small) CoM horizontal displacement with respect to the wheel's axis suspension vertical travel and also due to deformation of the tires i.e. contact patch displacement relative to wheel.\n\nLowering the CoM towards the ground is one method of reducing load transfer.  As a result load transfer is reduced in both the longitudinal and lateral directions.  Another method of reducing load transfer is by increasing the wheel spacings. Increasing the vehicle's [[wheelbase]] (length) reduces longitudinal load transfer while increasing the vehicle's [[Axle track|track]] (width) reduces lateral load transfer. Most high performance automobiles are designed to sit as low as possible and usually have an extended wheelbase and track.\n\nOne way to calculate the effect of load transfer, keeping in mind that this article uses \"load transfer\" to mean the phenomenon commonly referred to as \"weight transfer\" in the automotive world, is with the so-called \"weight transfer equation\":\n\n:<math>\\Delta Weight_{front} = a\\frac{h}{b}m</math> or <math>\\Delta Weight_{front} = \\frac{a}{g} \\frac{h}{b}w</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\Delta Weight_{front}</math> is the change in load borne by the front wheels, <math>a</math> is the longitudinal acceleration, <math>g</math> is the [[Standard gravity|acceleration of gravity]], <math>h</math> is the center of mass height, <math>b</math> is the wheelbase, <math>m</math> is the total vehicle mass, and <math>w</math> is the total vehicle weight.<ref>{{cite magazine\n| url = http://www.caranddriver.com/features/the-physics-of-wheelstands\n| title = The Physics of Wheelstands\n| magazine = [[Car and Driver]]\n| author = John Pearley Huffman\n| date = June 2010\n| accessdate = 2013-07-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n| url = http://www.fkm.utm.my/~arahim/daimlerchrysler-gritt.pdf\n| title = Introduction to Brake Systems\n| publisher = [[Daimler AG#Merger with Chrysler|DaimlerChrysler]]\n| author = P.

Acceleration causes the [[sprung mass]] to rotate about a geometric axis resulting in relocation of the CoM. Front-back weight transfer is proportional to the change in the longitudinal location of the CoM to the vehicle's wheelbase, and side-to-side weight transfer (summed over front and rear) is proportional to the ratio of the change in the CoM's lateral location to the vehicle's track.\n\nLiquids, such as fuel, readily flow within their containers, causing changes in the vehicle's CoM. As fuel is consumed, not only does the position of the CoM change, but the total weight of the vehicle is also reduced.\n\nBy way of example, when a vehicle accelerates, a weight transfer toward the rear wheels can occur. An outside [[observation|observer]] might witness this as the vehicle visibly leans to the back, or [[Suspension (vehicle)#Anti-dive and anti-squat|squats]]. Conversely, under braking, weight transfer toward the front of the car can occur. Under hard braking it might be clearly visible even from inside the vehicle as the nose [[Suspension (motorcycle)#Brake dive|dives]] toward the ground (most of this will be due to load transfer). Similarly, during changes in direction (lateral acceleration), weight transfer to the outside of the direction of the turn can occur.\n\n'''Weight transfer''' is generally of far less practical importance than [[load transfer]], for cars and SUVs at least. For instance in a 0.9g turn, a car with a track of 1650&nbsp;mm and a CoM height of 550&nbsp;mm will see a load transfer of 30% of the vehicle weight, that is the outer wheels will see 60% more load than before, and the inners 60% less. Total available grip will drop by around 6% as a result of this load transfer. At the same time, the CoM of the vehicle will typically move laterally and vertically, relative to the [[contact patch]] by no more than 30&nbsp;mm, leading to a weight transfer of less than 2%, and a corresponding reduction in grip of 0.01%.\n\n==Traction==\nLoad transfer causes the available [[traction (engineering)|traction]] at all four wheels to vary as the car brakes, accelerates, or turns. This bias to one pair of tires doing more \"work\" than the other pair results in a net loss of total available traction.  The net loss can be attributed to the phenomenon known as [[tire load sensitivity]].\n\nAn exception is during positive acceleration when the engine power is driving two or fewer wheels.  In this situation where all the tires are not being utilized load transfer can be advantageous.  As such, the most powerful cars are almost never [[front wheel drive]], as the acceleration itself causes the front wheels' traction to decrease. This is why sports cars usually have either [[rear wheel drive]] or [[all wheel drive]] (and in the all wheel drive case, the power tends to be biased toward the rear wheels under normal conditions).\n\n==Rollover==\nIf (lateral) load transfer reaches the tire loading on one end of a vehicle, the inside wheel on that end will lift, causing a change in handling characteristic.  If it reaches half the weight of the vehicle it will start to roll over.  Some large trucks will roll over before skidding, while passenger vehicles and small trucks usually roll over only when they leave the road.  Fitting racing tires to a tall or narrow vehicle and then driving it hard may lead to rollover.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anti-roll bar]]\n* [[Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics]]\n* [[Car handling]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.safercar.gov/Rollover/pages/RatSysVCompare.htm DOT rollover ratings by vehicle type]\n\n{{Automotive handling}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weight Transfer}}\n[[Category:Driving techniques]]\n[[Category:Automotive engineering]]\n[[Category:Motorcycle dynamics]]\n\n[[de:Lastwechselreaktion]]\n[[fr:Transfert de masse]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses}}\n\n[[Image:Pro Street Camaro at launch.JPG|thumb|right|Camaro performing a [[wheelie]] during [[drag racing]].]]\n[[File:Rl-stoppie.JPG|thumb|right|A motorcyclist performing a [[stoppie]].]]\n[[File:TargaTasmaniaRacer1.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Toyota MR2]] leaning to the outside of a turn.]]\n'''Weight transfer''' and '''load transfer''' are two expressions used somewhat confusingly to describe two distinct effects:<ref name=Foale>{{cite book\n| title = Motorcycle Handling and Chassis Design\n| edition = Second\n| last = Foale\n| first = Tony  \n| year = 2006\n| publisher = Tony Foale Designs\n| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=84hF-qoR5I8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Motorcycle+Handling+and+Chassis+Design\n| isbn = 978-84-933286-3-4\n| pages = 9-1}}</ref> the change in load borne by different wheels of even perfectly rigid vehicles during acceleration, and the change in [[center of mass]] (CoM) location relative to the wheels because of [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] compliance or [[cargo]] shifting or sloshing.

As such, the most powerful cars are almost never [[front wheel drive]], as the acceleration itself causes the front wheels' traction to decrease. This is why sports cars usually have either [[rear wheel drive]] or [[all wheel drive]] (and in the all wheel drive case, the power tends to be biased toward the rear wheels under normal conditions).\n\n==Rollover==\nIf (lateral) load transfer reaches the tire loading on one end of a vehicle, the inside wheel on that end will lift, causing a change in handling characteristic.  If it reaches half the weight of the vehicle it will start to roll over.  Some large trucks will roll over before skidding, while passenger vehicles and small trucks usually roll over only when they leave the road.  Fitting racing tires to a tall or narrow vehicle and then driving it hard may lead to rollover.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Anti-roll bar]]\n* [[Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics]]\n* [[Car handling]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.safercar.gov/Rollover/pages/RatSysVCompare.htm DOT rollover ratings by vehicle type]\n\n{{Automotive handling}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Weight Transfer}}\n[[Category:Driving techniques]]\n[[Category:Automotive engineering]]\n[[Category:Motorcycle dynamics]]\n\n[[de:Lastwechselreaktion]]\n[[fr:Transfert de masse]]\n", "name_user": "2601:246:4400:4560:2c82:26ae:3c3:f5f2", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eLoad transfer)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weight_transfer"}
