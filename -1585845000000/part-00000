The church was originally a chapel of ease to St Mary's Church in Harrow, and was first mentioned in 1234. It was rebuilt in the early fourteenth-century, and rededicated in 1321. The parish became independent of St Mary's in 1766, when the first perpetual curate was appointed; not until the Wilberforce Act of 1868 did it appoint its first vicar, one William Hind.</ref> at the junction of the present day Grange Gardens, The High Street and Church Lane.

Lee]] (professor of religion and Asian studies at Calvin University) of Gertoux's work is present: \n{{quote|In contrast to the long-held Jewish tradition, the author claims that the name of God in the HB should be pronounced. His claim is based on Exod 9:16, \"... to make my name resound through all the earth\" and Maimonides' work stressing the impossibility of a deep, personal relationship with a nameless God. With a survey of the historical record from \"Adam\" to the American Standard Version, Gertoux argues that the letters Y, W, H are read as the vowels I (or E), U (or O), and A. For the H, a mute e could be added in order to be better heard. The tetragrammaton, YHWH, is therefore read I-eH-U-A (Iehoua), the equivalent of YeHoWaH in Masoretic punctuation. This means that the name is to be pronounced as it is written, or according to its letters. The result is that the tetragrammaton is the only Hebrew name constituted, not of four consonants, but of four vowels, as noted by Josephus. This detailed treatment of the Name is useful for those who are interested in the history of its translation over the centuries.{{sfn|Lee|2003|pp=285}}}} \n\nDidier M. Fontaine reports that G. Gertoux \"shows how frequent the use of the Name has been, from the earliest times to around c.150, when the Jews began, both orally and in writing, to show serious reservations about the use of the divine name, especially with non-Jews.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://areopage.net/blog/2015/04/07/le-nom-divin-imprononcable-gertoux-2015/|author=Didier Micka\u00ebl Fontaine|title=Le nom divin: impronon\u00e7able?

Gertoux's book a chronological account of the tetragrammaton is offered, but \"he is primarily interested in supporting his assertion that the Tetragrammaton has always been read \"according to his letters,\" i.e. ''yhwh'' treated as ''[[matres lectionis]]'' and vocalized \"Jehovah\".\" R. J. Wilkinson adds G. Gertoux believes that \"the eclipse of the name was part of a satanic strategy and he believes that the Tetragrammaton appeared in the first New Testament texts.\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=38}}\n\nAnne Pasquier (Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies at Laval University) based on the book by G. Gertoux states that \"the perfume is associated with the divine name\", \"theme of good smell is linked to the name in the Bible\", and concludes that in [[Song of Songs]] 1,3: \"there is indeed a play on words in Hebrew between the expression \"your name\" (shem\u00e9ka) and \"your scented oils\" (sheman\u00e9ka), the name of God being comparable to an incense.\"{{sfn|Pasquier|2011|pp=126}}\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois B\u0153spflug]] (professor emeritus of history of religions at the Faculty of Catholic Theology in Strasbourg ) wrote that G.

Ross, (professor at the Biblical Institute of the Baptist Church in Mukwonago (Wisconsin)), agrees with G. Gertoux, who states that the Masoretic points must indicate the correct pronunciation, because it is inconceivable that God allows lose the correct pronunciation of his name, and that, despite the grammatical processes of mutation of the vowels when they are far from the accent (as ''d\u0101b\u0101r'' to the plural is made ''d\u0259b\u0101r\u012bm''). T. D. Ross considers significant, like Gertoux, that the theophoric names do not contain the vowels of Yahweh but those of [[Jehovah]].<ref>{{cite document|author=Thomas D. Ross|title=Trinitarianism Syllabus|citeseerx=10.1.1.694.8315}}</ref> T. D. Ross also considers the work of G.

Gertoux on the idea that he \"postulated that the perpetual qere was not for Adonai, but for Shema\", and considers that some have recently pointed out \"a number of problems with [[Wilhelm Gesenius|Gesenius]]'s theory.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Origins of Adonai in the Hebrew Scriptures|author=Ren Manetti|url=https://www.academia.edu/4428591}}</ref>\n\nDaniel Faivre calls Yahweh the most frequent vocalization, \"but considers that it is not formally consolidated\" and therefore prefers to \"use the tetragrammaton in its consonant integrity\" and then quotes the work of G. Gertoux in its French version as \"a more complete study.\"{{sfn|Faivre|2007|pp=13}}\n\nIn observations of [[4Q120]] and some Hebrew words among some scrolls, [[George Wesley Buchanan]] (Professor Emeritus at Wesley Theological Seminary) claim that \"for many years scholars have mistakenly assumed that the Tetragrammaton was to be correctly pronounced ''Y\u00e1h-weh'', treating the central vowel as if it were a consonant. This error has recently been corrected.\"{{sfn|Buchanan|2005|pp=11}} G. W. Buchanan thinks that there are arguments for the pronounciation Yahowah, but agrees with G. Gertoux in that \"based on this data, the divine name will be spelled arbitrarily ''Yehowah''.{{sfn|Buchanan|2005|pp=12}}\n\nSarah Lind reports the study of Gertoux and say that \"G. maintains a website with excerpts at divinename.net.\": G\u00e9rard Gertoux. 2002.

Vasileiadis (Post-Doc Researcher at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki) reports that \"according to G. Gertoux, the Greek term ''\u0399\u03b1\u03c9'' comes from the Hebrew ''[[Yahu]]'', and the Samaritan term ''\u0399\u03b1\u03b2\u03b5'' comes from the Aramaic ''Yaw''.\"{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2013|pp=13}} G.

D. Vasileiadis agrees.{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2014|pp=63}} P. D. Vasileiadis also considers the work of G. Gertoux as a source that presents \"an overview of long-standing efforts to translate the Tetragrammaton into Greek\".<ref>Vasileiadis, Pavlos. [https://www.academia.edu/38647628 \"Jesus, the New Testament, and the sacred Tetragrammaton.\"] Presented at the International Biblical Conference \"Biblical Studies, West and East: Trends, Challenges, and Prospects,\" organised by the [[Ukrainian Catholic University]] (19\u201320 September 2013, Lviv, Ukraine).</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Religious Studies Review]]'', the opinion of [[Won W. Lee]] (professor of religion and Asian studies at Calvin University) of Gertoux's work is present: \n{{quote|In contrast to the long-held Jewish tradition, the author claims that the name of God in the HB should be pronounced. His claim is based on Exod 9:16, \"... to make my name resound through all the earth\" and Maimonides' work stressing the impossibility of a deep, personal relationship with a nameless God. With a survey of the historical record from \"Adam\" to the American Standard Version, Gertoux argues that the letters Y, W, H are read as the vowels I (or E), U (or O), and A. For the H, a mute e could be added in order to be better heard. The tetragrammaton, YHWH, is therefore read I-eH-U-A (Iehoua), the equivalent of YeHoWaH in Masoretic punctuation. This means that the name is to be pronounced as it is written, or according to its letters. The result is that the tetragrammaton is the only Hebrew name constituted, not of four consonants, but of four vowels, as noted by Josephus. This detailed treatment of the Name is useful for those who are interested in the history of its translation over the centuries.{{sfn|Lee|2003|pp=285}}}} \n\nDidier M. Fontaine reports that G. Gertoux \"shows how frequent the use of the Name has been, from the earliest times to around c.150, when the Jews began, both orally and in writing, to show serious reservations about the use of the divine name, especially with non-Jews.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://areopage.net/blog/2015/04/07/le-nom-divin-imprononcable-gertoux-2015/|author=Didier Micka\u00ebl Fontaine|title=Le nom divin: impronon\u00e7able?

J. Wilkinson states: \"the book is intended to be a work of history, and I have thus eschewed theological comment as inappropriate. I am unaware of any previous work with the scope of this book, unless it be found among those who wish to promote (or prohibit) a devotional or liturgical use of the Tetragrammaton or hold strong views about its pronunciation and meaning\", and at the footnote of the page he points out that he considers that in the French version of G. Gertoux's book a chronological account of the tetragrammaton is offered, but \"he is primarily interested in supporting his assertion that the Tetragrammaton has always been read \"according to his letters,\" i.e. ''yhwh'' treated as ''[[matres lectionis]]'' and vocalized \"Jehovah\".\" R. J. Wilkinson adds G. Gertoux believes that \"the eclipse of the name was part of a satanic strategy and he believes that the Tetragrammaton appeared in the first New Testament texts.\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=38}}\n\nAnne Pasquier (Faculty of Theology and Religious Studies at Laval University) based on the book by G. Gertoux states that \"the perfume is associated with the divine name\", \"theme of good smell is linked to the name in the Bible\", and concludes that in [[Song of Songs]] 1,3: \"there is indeed a play on words in Hebrew between the expression \"your name\" (shem\u00e9ka) and \"your scented oils\" (sheman\u00e9ka), the name of God being comparable to an incense.\"{{sfn|Pasquier|2011|pp=126}}\n\n[[Fran\u00e7ois B\u0153spflug]] (professor emeritus of history of religions at the Faculty of Catholic Theology in Strasbourg ) wrote that G. Gertoux has provided \"valuable indications\" to the subject of the name of God, and suggest that \"contrary to what is said, still frequently, especially in Catholic circles, and in spite of what can be read in some scientific work of contemporary Hebraism, the prohibition of the images of God did not lead to a formal prohibition of the pronunciation of the name of God.{{sfn|Boespflug|2007|pp=74}} In a footnote F.

Ross, (professor at the Biblical Institute of the Baptist Church in Mukwonago (Wisconsin)), agrees with G. Gertoux, who states that the Masoretic points must indicate the correct pronunciation, because it is inconceivable that God allows lose the correct pronunciation of his name, and that, despite the grammatical processes of mutation of the vowels when they are far from the accent (as ''d\u0101b\u0101r'' to the plural is made ''d\u0259b\u0101r\u012bm''). T. D. Ross considers significant, like Gertoux, that the theophoric names do not contain the vowels of Yahweh but those of [[Jehovah]].<ref>{{cite document|author=Thomas D.
