This happens if the groom or the bride didn't get the permission to get married with each other. As Indonesia is a religiously strict country, a couple couldn't get married without parent's (or next closest living relative) consent, hence, it is rarely practiced.

{"title_page": "William Montgomerie", "text_new": "{{good article}}\n[[File:W. Montgomerie.png|thumb|upright|William Montgomerie]]\n\n'''William Montgomerie''' (1797\u20131856) was a Scottish military doctor with the [[East India Company]], and later head of the medical department at [[Singapore]].  He is best known for promoting the use of [[gutta-percha]] in Europe.  This material was an important [[natural rubber]] that made [[submarine telegraph cable]]s possible. Montgomerie was involved in spice cultivation as head of the Singapore botanical experimental gardens and at his personal estate in Singapore.  The latter never became economically viable, but he received a [[Society of Arts]] gold medal for [[nutmeg]] cultivation. He was also responsible for building the first [[lunatic asylum]] in Singapore. Montgomerie died at [[Barrackpore]] in India a few years after taking part in the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] as Superintendent Surgeon.\n\n== Early life and family ==\nMontgomerie was born in Scotland in 1797.<ref>Savage & Yeoh, p. 106</ref>  In 1827, he married Elizabeth Graham in [[Calcutta]].<ref>Teo, p. 25</ref> A son is mentioned<!-- It is unclear whether there really was a son or the journalist is speaking elliptically --> in a newspaper article.<ref>Buckley, p. 402</ref>  His brother was Major-General Sir P. Montgomerie of the Madras Artillery who fought in the [[First Opium War]].<ref>Buckley, p. 402</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1818, Montgomerie became a medical officer with the [[East India Company]] and was posted to India.  In May 1819, he was posted to Singapore with the 2nd Battalion of the 20th Regiment of [[Bengal Native Infantry]]<ref>Buckley, p. 60</ref> with the rank of Assistant Surgeon.<ref group=note>The term \"surgeon\" was used by the military [[Indian Medical Service]] to designate a medical officer's rank.  It did not indicate whether or not the officer practiced surgery.  Surgeon ranks, in order of descending seniority were; Surgeon-Major, Surgeon, Assistant Surgeon, Sub-assistant Surgeon (Teo, p. 25).</ref>  Upon his arrival, he took over as senior surgeon of Singapore from a more junior officer, and was given the rank of acting Surgeon.  In 1827, Montgomerie was posted back to [[Bengal]].<ref>{{multiref|RSA ''Transactions'', p. 40|Montgomerie, p. 377}}</ref>  In 1835, the medical department headquarters was moved from [[Penang]] to Singapore, whereupon Montgomerie was made the head.  He retired to England in January 1844.  He was recalled to Bengal some years later as Garrison Surgeon at [[Fort William, Calcutta]], and was Superintendent Surgeon in the field during the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] (1852\u20131853).  He died of [[cholera]] at [[Barrackpore]],<ref>\"William Montgomerie\", HistorySG</ref> India, on 21 March 1856 and was buried in Fort William.<ref>{{multiref|Teo, p. 25|Buckley, p. 402}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was stationed at Singapore, Montgomerie was usually the doctor attending Singapore's leaders.  These included [[Stamford Raffles]], the founder of Singapore, and [[William Farquhar]], who was stabbed by a would-be assassin in 1823.<ref>{{multiref|\"William Montgomerie\", HistorySG|Buckley, pp. 97\u201399}}</ref>  Farquhar had expressed concern over Montgomerie's youth when he arrived in Singapore in 1819.  Montgomerie was very young at this point, even younger than the Sub-assistant Surgeon from whom he took over and was now in charge.<ref>Teo, p. 25</ref>  If anything happened to Farquhar, Montgomerie would have been left in charge of Singapore as the next most senior official.  Farquhar wrote to Calcutta asking them to put alternative arrangements in place.<ref>Buckley, p. 56</ref>\n\nIn Singapore, Montgomerie was appointed a [[magistrate]] in 1819, head of the [[Botanical experimental gardens, Singapore|botanical experimental gardens]] in 1823 (where he concentrated on cultivating spices<ref>Buckley, p. 196</ref>), and sheriff in 1837.<ref>{{multiref|\"William Montgomerie\", HistorySG|Buckley, p. 93}}</ref>\n\n== Agriculture ==\nMontgomerie keenly pursued agriculture in Singapore.  He owned the {{convert|32|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Duxton Hill]] estate for most of his time there, but never succeeded in making it profitable.  It was sold after his death and briefly renamed \"Woodsville\".  The area is now built-up and the name has reverted to Duxton Hill, a name also preserved in Duxton Road.  The primary crop grown was sugar, but later he planted [[nutmeg]] trees.  The estate was bounded by a river where Montgomerie had a large [[watermill]].  A short distance from the mill, the [[Serangoon Road]] crosses the river on a crossing known as Montgomerie's Bridge.<ref>{{multiref|Buckley, p. 402|Savage & Yeoh, pp. 106, 258, 329}}</ref>\n\n=== Spice cultivation ===\nOn his return to Singapore in 1835, Montgomerie found that the government spice plantations had been neglected.  The [[clove]] crop had been destroyed by [[blight]], but since the nutmeg trees still looked healthy, Montgomerie decided to start his own plantation with seeds procured from Penang.<ref>RSA ''Transactions'', p. 40</ref>  He believed that enough nutmeg could be grown in Singapore to supply the entire British Empire by 1850, and that the price could be driven down to something affordable by ordinary people.  However, he complained that the government land leasing arrangements were not favourable in Singapore, and discouraged farming.  He compared this to [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] (now known as [[Sri Lanka]], but at the time a British possession) where land could be bought outright.<ref>RSA ''Transactions'', pp. 45\u201347</ref>  In 1842, Montgomerie sent a box of nutmeg and [[mace (spice)|mace]] to the Society of Arts (later to become the [[Royal Society]]) for which he was awarded a gold medal.<ref>RSA ''Transactions'', pp. 38, 48</ref>\n\n== Gutta-percha ==\n[[Gutta-percha]] is a [[natural rubber]] obtained from the sap of certain trees growing in the Far East.  It hardens on exposure to air, but has the useful property of being [[thermoplastic]].  It can be moulded to a new shape after boiling in water and will reharden when cool.  It is credited with being the first [[plastic]] available to manufacturing industry.<ref>{{multiref|\"Gutta Percha\", PHS|Baker, p. 89}}</ref>\n\nMontgomerie is sometimes credited with discovering the substance.  He is responsible for it coming into widespread use, but it had in fact been known for some time by a few natives who used it to make handles for [[Parang (knife)|parangs]] (Malayan [[machete]]s) and other items.  However, it was not widely known, even amongst native [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]].  Montgomerie said that most people he showed it to could not recognise it.  It had even made its way to Europe,<ref group=note>As early as 1656, [[John Tradescant the Younger|John Tradescant]] had brought a material to England which he called ''mazer wood'' and which is thought to be gutta-percha because of the similarity in its properties (''Straits Times'', 1884; Baker, p. 89).<br/> [[Jos\u00e9 d'Almeida]], a Portuguese doctor and trader in Singapore, also brought samples to the Society of Arts around the same time as Montgomerie after seeing native whips made from the material (Oxley, p. 22).</ref> but again, was not widely known.<ref>''Straits Times'', 1884</ref>  Montgomerie's discovery began in 1822 when he was shown a different natural rubber, ''gutta girek'', and was told of the existence of a harder material, ''gutta percha''.  However, he could not obtain a sample at the time and did not get another opportunity until 1842 after he returned to Singapore.  In that year a Malay showed him a parang with a gutta-percha handle.  Montgomerie purchased the item and requested that more of the substance be provided.  After experimentation, he concluded that its [[Thermoplastic|thermoplastic properties]] would be ideal for making many surgical instruments.  The natural rubbers used for this purpose at the time were easily damaged by [[Solvent|solvents]] and could not withstand the tropical climate.<ref>{{multiref|Montgomerie, pp. 377\u2013378|Buckley, p. 404}}</ref>\n\nMontgomerie sent samples to the Calcutta Medical Board with a recommendation for its medical use.  The board agreed with him and requested that he obtain as much as possible.<ref>Montgomerie, p. 378</ref>  Montgomerie also sent samples to the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] in London in 1843.<ref>{{multiref|Teo, p. 25|Trocki, p. 86}}</ref>  He began an investigation into how widespread the tree was.  He discovered that it was not only found in Singapore, but all over the Malaysian peninsular and the islands of Indonesia and appeared to be plentiful.  However, as early as 1846 Montgomerie was expressing fears that supplies would dry up due to the destructive method of harvesting and large quantities being produced.<ref group=note>Oxley also noted the fast depopulation of gutta-percha trees in Singapore (Oxley, p. 24)</ref>  Trees were cut down and the bark stripped to get to the sap.  Montgomerie believed that it was possible to harvest the sap by [[Rubber tapping|tapping]] but did not think it would be possible to persuade the native collectors to use this slower, but more sustainable method.<ref>Montgomerie, pp. 378\u2013379</ref>\n\nBesides its use for making medical instruments, Montgomerie proposed several other uses, including as a dental filling (for which it is still used<ref>{{multiref|Picker, p. 35|Baker, p. 89|Prakash ''et al.'', p.32}}</ref>).<ref>Montgomerie, p. 379</ref>  Numerous other applications were quickly found for the new material, including a much improved golf ball.<ref>\"Gutta Percha\", PHS</ref>  However, the most important application was as an electrical insulator.  This was essential for the worldwide [[electric telegraph|telegraph]] network as it made possible the [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] and other links across oceans.  No better material was available until the invention of [[polyethylene]] in the 1930s.<ref>{{multiref|\"William Montgomerie\", PHS|Arrighi, p. 7|Picker, p. 35|Baker, pp. 90\u201391}}</ref>\n\n== Mental health medicine ==\n{{main|Mental health in Singapore during the colonial period}}\nIt was the custom in Singapore to house '[[lunatic]]s' in the jail.  Natives and Chinese were confined in this way, while Europeans enjoyed better treatment.  It was part of Montgomerie's duties to visit the jail daily to attend to their needs.  There had been public disquiet about the lack of proper facilities, but nothing was done until 1840 when one mentally ill inmate murdered another.  Montgomerie was tasked with investigating and making recommendations.  He recommended a purpose built [[lunatic asylum]] and submitted plans and costings.  He rejected an alternative idea of sending patients to India.  Montgomerie's plan was accepted and the asylum was built.<ref>Lee, pp. 386\u2013387</ref>\n\n== Singapore Stone ==\nMontgomerie played a minor role in recovering pieces of the [[Singapore Stone]] after it was demolished by explosives in 1843.<ref>Miksic, p. 19</ref>  The stone was a large rock in the [[Singapore River]] bearing an ancient and undeciphered inscription.  It was destroyed by the Settlement Engineer to clear the river channel.  Montgomerie had intended to set up a Singapore museum, but was unable to do so.  Instead, he sent the pieces he recovered to the [[Indian Museum, Kolkata|Asiatic Society museum in Calcutta]] around 1848.<ref>Buckley, pp. 91\u201394</ref>  In 1918, some of the fragments recovered by Montgomerie were returned to Singapore on extended loan and are now in the [[National Museum of Singapore]].<ref>Brooke, p. 576</ref>\n\nThe destruction of the stone horrified many of the colony's officials.  One described it as vandalism.  The stone was first discovered by Bengali sailors tasked with clearing the vegetation by the port's first [[Master Attendant]].  On seeing the strange inscription, they refused to carry on.  Montgomerie commented \"it was a pity that those who afterwards authorised the destruction of the ancient relic were not themselves prevented by some such wholesome superstition.\"<ref>Buckley, pp. 93\u201394</ref>\n\n== Honours ==\n* [[Society of Arts]] Gold Medal 1844.<ref>Montgomerie, p. 378</ref><ref group=note>Oxley, and several other sources, say that Montgomerie got the medal for the discovery of gutta-percha (Oxley, p. 22).  This may be an error since the RSA citation flatly contradicts this.  \nThe alternative explanation that there were two different medals awarded is not found in any source of this article.<br/>If it is an error, Montgomerie himself was under the same misapprehension, since he also says he got the medal for gutta-percha (Montgomerie, p. 378).  It is entirely possible that Montgomerie misunderstood the award.  He was in Singapore at the time, and the award was collected on his behalf by his brother-in-law, H. Gouger, in London (RSA ''Transactions'', p. 60).  In the age before the establishment of the worldwide telegraph, communications were slow and unreliable.</ref>  Awarded for \"the cultivation of nutmegs in that  island [Singapore], samples of which have been placed in the Society's repository.\"<ref>RSA ''Transactions'', p. 38</ref>\n\n== Recreation ==\nMontgomerie was the head of the [[Singapore Yacht Club]] when it formed in 1826.

Montgomerie.png|thumb|upright|William Montgomerie]]\n\n'''William Montgomerie''' (1797\u20131856) was a Scottish military doctor with the [[East India Company]], and later head of the medical department at [[Singapore]].  He is best known for promoting the use of [[gutta-percha]] in Europe.  This material was an important [[natural rubber]] that made [[submarine telegraph cable]]s possible. Montgomerie was involved in spice cultivation as head of the Singapore botanical experimental gardens and at his personal estate in Singapore.  The latter never became economically viable, but he received a [[Society of Arts]] gold medal for [[nutmeg]] cultivation. He was also responsible for building the first [[lunatic asylum]] in Singapore. Montgomerie died at [[Barrackpore]] in India a few years after taking part in the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] as Superintendent Surgeon.\n\n== Early life and family ==\nMontgomerie was born in Scotland in 1797.<ref>Savage & Yeoh, p. 106</ref>  In 1827, he married Elizabeth Graham in [[Calcutta]].<ref>Teo, p. 25</ref> A son is mentioned<!-- It is unclear whether there really was a son or the journalist is speaking elliptically --> in a newspaper article.<ref>Buckley, p. 402</ref>  His brother was Major-General Sir P. Montgomerie of the Madras Artillery who fought in the [[First Opium War]].<ref>Buckley, p. 402</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1818, Montgomerie became a medical officer with the [[East India Company]] and was posted to India.  In May 1819, he was posted to Singapore with the 2nd Battalion of the 20th Regiment of [[Bengal Native Infantry]]<ref>Buckley, p. 60</ref> with the rank of Assistant Surgeon.<ref group=note>The term \"surgeon\" was used by the military [[Indian Medical Service]] to designate a medical officer's rank.  It did not indicate whether or not the officer practiced surgery.  Surgeon ranks, in order of descending seniority were; Surgeon-Major, Surgeon, Assistant Surgeon, Sub-assistant Surgeon (Teo, p. 25).</ref>  Upon his arrival, he took over as senior surgeon of Singapore from a more junior officer, and was given the rank of acting Surgeon.  In 1827, Montgomerie was posted back to [[Bengal]].<ref>{{multiref|RSA ''Transactions'', p. 40|Montgomerie, p. 377}}</ref>  In 1835, the medical department headquarters was moved from [[Penang]] to Singapore, whereupon Montgomerie was made the head.  He retired to England in January 1844.  He was recalled to Bengal some years later as Garrison Surgeon at [[Fort William, Calcutta]], and was Superintendent Surgeon in the field during the [[Second Anglo-Burmese War]] (1852\u20131853).  He died of [[cholera]] at [[Barrackpore]],<ref>\"William Montgomerie\", HistorySG</ref> India, on 21 March 1856 and was buried in Fort William.<ref>{{multiref|Teo, p. 25|Buckley, p. 402}}</ref>\n\nWhile he was stationed at Singapore, Montgomerie was usually the doctor attending Singapore's leaders.  These included [[Stamford Raffles]], the founder of Singapore, and [[William Farquhar]], who was stabbed by a would-be assassin in 1823.<ref>{{multiref|\"William Montgomerie\", HistorySG|Buckley, pp. 97\u201399}}</ref>  Farquhar had expressed concern over Montgomerie's youth when he arrived in Singapore in 1819.  Montgomerie was very young at this point, even younger than the Sub-assistant Surgeon from whom he took over and was now in charge.<ref>Teo, p. 25</ref>  If anything happened to Farquhar, Montgomerie would have been left in charge of Singapore as the next most senior official.  Farquhar wrote to Calcutta asking them to put alternative arrangements in place.<ref>Buckley, p. 56</ref>\n\nIn Singapore, Montgomerie was appointed a [[magistrate]] in 1819, head of the [[Botanical experimental gardens, Singapore|botanical experimental gardens]] in 1823 (where he concentrated on cultivating spices<ref>Buckley, p. 196</ref>), and sheriff in 1837.<ref>{{multiref|\"William Montgomerie\", HistorySG|Buckley, p. 93}}</ref>\n\n== Agriculture ==\nMontgomerie keenly pursued agriculture in Singapore.  He owned the {{convert|32|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Duxton Hill]] estate for most of his time there, but never succeeded in making it profitable.  It was sold after his death and briefly renamed \"Woodsville\".  The area is now built-up and the name has reverted to Duxton Hill, a name also preserved in Duxton Road.  The primary crop grown was sugar, but later he planted [[nutmeg]] trees.  The estate was bounded by a river where Montgomerie had a large [[watermill]].  A short distance from the mill, the [[Serangoon Road]] crosses the river on a crossing known as Montgomerie's Bridge.<ref>{{multiref|Buckley, p. 402|Savage & Yeoh, pp. 106, 258, 329}}</ref>\n\n=== Spice cultivation ===\nOn his return to Singapore in 1835, Montgomerie found that the government spice plantations had been neglected.  The [[clove]] crop had been destroyed by [[blight]], but since the nutmeg trees still looked healthy, Montgomerie decided to start his own plantation with seeds procured from Penang.<ref>RSA ''Transactions'', p. 40</ref>  He believed that enough nutmeg could be grown in Singapore to supply the entire British Empire by 1850, and that the price could be driven down to something affordable by ordinary people.  However, he complained that the government land leasing arrangements were not favourable in Singapore, and discouraged farming.  He compared this to [[British Ceylon|Ceylon]] (now known as [[Sri Lanka]], but at the time a British possession) where land could be bought outright.<ref>RSA ''Transactions'', pp. 45\u201347</ref>  In 1842, Montgomerie sent a box of nutmeg and [[mace (spice)|mace]] to the Society of Arts (later to become the [[Royal Society]]) for which he was awarded a gold medal.<ref>RSA ''Transactions'', pp. 38, 48</ref>\n\n== Gutta-percha ==\n[[Gutta-percha]] is a [[natural rubber]] obtained from the sap of certain trees growing in the Far East.  It hardens on exposure to air, but has the useful property of being [[thermoplastic]].  It can be moulded to a new shape after boiling in water and will reharden when cool.  It is credited with being the first [[plastic]] available to manufacturing industry.<ref>{{multiref|\"Gutta Percha\", PHS|Baker, p. 89}}</ref>\n\nMontgomerie is sometimes credited with discovering the substance.  He is responsible for it coming into widespread use, but it had in fact been known for some time by a few natives who used it to make handles for [[Parang (knife)|parangs]] (Malayan [[machete]]s) and other items.  However, it was not widely known, even amongst native [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]].  Montgomerie said that most people he showed it to could not recognise it.  It had even made its way to Europe,<ref group=note>As early as 1656, [[John Tradescant the Younger|John Tradescant]] had brought a material to England which he called ''mazer wood'' and which is thought to be gutta-percha because of the similarity in its properties (''Straits Times'', 1884; Baker, p. 89).<br/> [[Jos\u00e9 d'Almeida]], a Portuguese doctor and trader in Singapore, also brought samples to the Society of Arts around the same time as Montgomerie after seeing native whips made from the material (Oxley, p. 22).</ref> but again, was not widely known.<ref>''Straits Times'', 1884</ref>  Montgomerie's discovery began in 1822 when he was shown a different natural rubber, ''gutta girek'', and was told of the existence of a harder material, ''gutta percha''.  However, he could not obtain a sample at the time and did not get another opportunity until 1842 after he returned to Singapore.  In that year a Malay showed him a parang with a gutta-percha handle.  Montgomerie purchased the item and requested that more of the substance be provided.  After experimentation, he concluded that its [[Thermoplastic|thermoplastic properties]] would be ideal for making many surgical instruments.  The natural rubbers used for this purpose at the time were easily damaged by [[Solvent|solvents]] and could not withstand the tropical climate.<ref>{{multiref|Montgomerie, pp. 377\u2013378|Buckley, p. 404}}</ref>\n\nMontgomerie sent samples to the Calcutta Medical Board with a recommendation for its medical use.  The board agreed with him and requested that he obtain as much as possible.<ref>Montgomerie, p. 378</ref>  Montgomerie also sent samples to the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] in London in 1843.<ref>{{multiref|Teo, p. 25|Trocki, p. 86}}</ref>  He began an investigation into how widespread the tree was.  He discovered that it was not only found in Singapore, but all over the Malaysian peninsular and the islands of Indonesia and appeared to be plentiful.  However, as early as 1846 Montgomerie was expressing fears that supplies would dry up due to the destructive method of harvesting and large quantities being produced.<ref group=note>Oxley also noted the fast depopulation of gutta-percha trees in Singapore (Oxley, p. 24)</ref>  Trees were cut down and the bark stripped to get to the sap.  Montgomerie believed that it was possible to harvest the sap by [[Rubber tapping|tapping]] but did not think it would be possible to persuade the native collectors to use this slower, but more sustainable method.<ref>Montgomerie, pp. 378\u2013379</ref>\n\nBesides its use for making medical instruments, Montgomerie proposed several other uses, including as a dental filling (for which it is still used<ref>{{multiref|Picker, p. 35|Baker, p. 89|Prakash ''et al.'', p.32}}</ref>).<ref>Montgomerie, p. 379</ref>  Numerous other applications were quickly found for the new material, including a much improved golf ball.<ref>\"Gutta Percha\", PHS</ref>  However, the most important application was as an electrical insulator.  This was essential for the worldwide [[electric telegraph|telegraph]] network as it made possible the [[transatlantic telegraph cable]] and other links across oceans.  No better material was available until the invention of [[polyethylene]] in the 1930s.<ref>{{multiref|\"William Montgomerie\", PHS|Arrighi, p. 7|Picker, p. 35|Baker, pp. 90\u201391}}</ref>\n\n== Mental health medicine ==\n{{main|Mental health in Singapore during the colonial period}}\nIt was the custom in Singapore to house '[[lunatic]]s' in the jail.  Natives and Chinese were mostly kept confined while Europeans enjoyed better treated.  It was part of Montgomerie's duties to visit the jail daily to attend to their needs.  There had been public disquiet about the lack of proper facilities, but nothing was done until 1840 when one mentally ill inmate murdered another.  Montgomerie was tasked with investigating and making recommendations.  He recommended a purpose built [[lunatic asylum]] and submitted plans and costings.  He rejected an alternative idea of sending patients to India.  Montgomerie's plan was accepted and the asylum was built.<ref>Lee, pp. 386\u2013387</ref>\n\n== Singapore Stone ==\nMontgomerie played a minor role in recovering pieces of the [[Singapore Stone]] after it was demolished by explosives in 1843.<ref>Miksic, p. 19</ref>  The stone was a large rock in the [[Singapore River]] bearing an ancient and undeciphered inscription.  It was destroyed by the Settlement Engineer to clear the river channel.  Montgomerie had intended to set up a Singapore museum, but was unable to do so.  Instead, he sent the pieces he recovered to the [[Indian Museum, Kolkata|Asiatic Society museum in Calcutta]] around 1848.<ref>Buckley, pp. 91\u201394</ref>  In 1918, some of the fragments recovered by Montgomerie were returned to Singapore on extended loan and are now in the [[National Museum of Singapore]].<ref>Brooke, p. 576</ref>\n\nThe destruction of the stone horrified many of the colony's officials.  One described it as vandalism.  The stone was first discovered by Bengali sailors tasked with clearing the vegetation by the port's first [[Master Attendant]].  On seeing the strange inscription, they refused to carry on.  Montgomerie commented \"it was a pity that those who afterwards authorised the destruction of the ancient relic were not themselves prevented by some such wholesome superstition.\"<ref>Buckley, pp. 93\u201394</ref>\n\n== Honours ==\n* [[Society of Arts]] Gold Medal 1844.<ref>Montgomerie, p. 378</ref><ref group=note>Oxley, and several other sources, say that Montgomerie got the medal for the discovery of gutta-percha (Oxley, p. 22).  This may be an error since the RSA citation flatly contradicts this.  \nThe alternative explanation that there were two different medals awarded is not found in any source of this article.<br/>If it is an error, Montgomerie himself was under the same misapprehension, since he also says he got the medal for gutta-percha (Montgomerie, p. 378).  It is entirely possible that Montgomerie misunderstood the award.  He was in Singapore at the time, and the award was collected on his behalf by his brother-in-law, H. Gouger, in London (RSA ''Transactions'', p. 60).  In the age before the establishment of the worldwide telegraph, communications were slow and unreliable.</ref>  Awarded for \"the cultivation of nutmegs in that  island [Singapore], samples of which have been placed in the Society's repository.\"<ref>RSA ''Transactions'', p. 38</ref>\n\n== Recreation ==\nMontgomerie was the head of the [[Singapore Yacht Club]] when it formed in 1826.

When the services of Trans-Atlantic liners were suspended in the wake of [[World War I]], Lustig found himself in search of new territory to make an income from, and opted to travel to the United States.

While staying in Paris, he chanced upon a newspaper article discussing the problems faced with maintaining the [[Eiffel Tower]], which gave him inspiration for a new con. At the time, the monument had begun to fall into disrepair, and the city was finding it increasingly expensive to maintain and repaint it. Part of the article made a passing comment that overall public opinion on the monument would move towards calls for its removal, which was the key to convincing Lustig that using it as part of his next con would be lucrative.<ref name= \"Lus Bio\" /> After researching what he needed to help him utilize the information from the article, Lustig set to work preparing the scam, which included hiring a forger to produce fake government stationery for him.<ref name=\"Lus Tow\">{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/12809/smooth-operator-how-victor-lustig-sold-eiffel-tower|title=Smooth Operator: How Victor Lustig Sold The Eiffel Tower|date=17 October 2012|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\nOnce he was ready, Lustig invited a small group of scrap metal dealers to a confidential meeting at an expensive hotel, whereupon he identified himself to them as the Deputy Director General of the Minist\u00e8re de Postes et T\u00e9l\u00e9graphes (Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs).<ref name= \"Lus Bio\" /> In the meeting, he convinced the men that the upkeep of the Eiffel Tower was becoming too much for Paris and that the French government wished to sell it for scrap, but that because such a deal would be controversial and likely spark public outcry, nothing could be disclosed until all the details were thought out. Lustig revealed that he was in charge of selecting the dealer who would receive ownership of the structure, claiming that the group had been selected carefully because of their reputations as \"honest businessmen\". As part of his speech, he took in genuine insight about the monument's place in the city, and how it didn't fit in with the city's other great monuments like the [[gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[cathedral]]s or the [[Arc de Triomphe]].<ref name=\"Lus Tow\" />\n\nDuring his time with the dealers, Lustig kept watch on who would be the most likely to fall for his scam, and found his mark in Andr\u00e9 Poisson\u2014an insecure man who wished to rise up amongst the inner circles of the Parisian business community.<ref name=\"Lus Pois\">{{cite web|url=http://www.todayifoundout.com/index.php/2015/01/man-sold-eiffel-tower-twice/|title=THE MAN WHO SOLD THE EIFFEL TOWER|date=14 January 2015|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref> As he showed the keenest interest in purchasing the monument, Lustig decided to focus on him once the dealers sent their bids to him.<ref name=\"Lus Pois\" /> Arranging a private meeting with Poisson, Lustig convinced him that he was a corrupt official, claiming that his government position did not give him a generous salary for the lifestyle he wished to enjoy.<ref name=\"Smoothest\"/> Believing the sale of the Eiffel Tower would secure him a place amongst the top businessmen, Poisson agreed to pay a large bribe to secure ownership of the Eiffel Tower. However, once Lustig received his bribe and the funds for the monument's \"sale\", he soon fled to [[Austria]].<ref name=\"Lus Tow\" />\n\nLustig suspected that when Poisson found out he had been conned, he would be too ashamed and embarrassed to inform the French police of what he had been caught up in, yet despite this belief, he maintained a check on newspapers while in Austria. His suspicions soon proved to be correct when he could find no reference of his con within their pages, and thus he decided to return to Paris later that year to pull off the scheme once more.<ref name=\"Lus Tow\" /><ref name=\"Smoothest\"/> However, when he attempted to con another group of dealers and had managed to find a mark among them willing to buy the Eiffel Tower, the police were informed about the scam and Lustig was forced to flee{{cn}} to the [[United States]] to evade arrest.<ref name= \"Lus Bio\" /><ref name=\"Lus Pois\" /><ref name=\"Smoothest\"/>\n\n==The \"Rumanian Box\" scam==\nOne of Lustig's most notable scams involved selling unsuspecting marks a box that he claimed was a machine that could duplicate any currency bills that were inserted into it, with the only catch being that the device needed six hours to print an identical copy. Referred to as the \"money box\" or \"Rumanian Box\", the scam involved a specially designed mahogany box, roughly the size of a steamer trunk. The box's design featured two small slots designed to take in bills and the paper to \"print\" the duplicate on, and a compartment containing a false arrangement of levers and mechanisms that had to be \"operated\" to make the duplicates.\n\nIn order to convince the mark it truly worked, Lustig would ask them to give him a specific denomination of bill (e.g. $100), insert it into his device along with the paper, and then wait with them until the duplicate was made. When it had, Lustig would take the mark with him to a bank to authenticate the note. In reality, the mark would be unaware of the fact that Lustig had concealed a genuine note within the device; the choice of denomination was influenced by what he put into the box. Once the mark was convinced, Lustig would refuse to sell them the box until they offered him a high price for it. Before it was sold, Lustig would pack the box with additional genuine notes, to buy him time to make a clean escape, before his mark realised they had been conned.<ref name= \"Lus Bio\" /><ref name=\"Smoothest\"/><ref name=\"Lus Pois\" />\n\nOne of his most infamous uses of the device was upon a Texas sheriff, whom he convinced to buy it for thousands of dollars. Upon realising he had been tricked, the sheriff pursued Lustig to Chicago. Upon meeting him again, the sheriff was conned into believing that he was not operating the device correctly, and was handed a large sum of cash as compensation, unaware that the money was counterfeit. This counterfeiting would eventually lead to his arrest by American law enforcement officers.<ref name=\"Smoothest\"/>\n\n==Later years, capture, & death==\nWhen the [[Great Depression]] hit, Lustig concocted a risky scam aimed towards [[Al Capone]], knowing that he faced certain death if he was found to be betraying or sought to ruin his mark. For Lustig, the scam was not a straight-out con, but one designed around a mind game with his target that would get him to part with a small amount of cash. The scheme involved him asking Capone to let him invest $50,000 towards a crooked scam, whereupon he kept the money given to him within a [[safe deposit box]] for two months before returning it. When he did, he claimed that the deal had fallen through, but that he intended to return the money, which surprised Capone by the fact he was dealing with an honest man for the first time. At this point, Lustig stung him with a claim that the failure of the deal meant he had no money himself to support him, convincing Capone to give him $5,000 to \"tide him over\", as Lustig had planned.<ref name=\"RADIO\"/><ref name=\"Smoothest\"/>\n\nIn 1930, Lustig went into a partnership with two men from Nebraska\u2014pharmacist William Watts, and chemist Tom Shaw\u2014to conduct a large scale counterfeiting operation. Both Watts and Shaw engraved the plates that would be used to manufacture the counterfeit dollar bills, while Lustig organised a ring of couriers to distribute the forgeries, ensuring that they were kept in the dark regarding the production of the counterfeits.<ref name=\"doremus\"/> In short, the operation managed to circulate thousands of dollars of counterfeit money each month for the next five years, nicknamed \"Lustig money\", though the increasing amount entering the US economy eventually drew the attention of federal agents.\n\nWhen Lustig's mistress, Billy May, learnt he was betraying her for Shaw's young mistress, she decided to get revenge and gave an anonymous phone call to the federal authorities.<ref name=\"doremus\">The Passing Parade - [[John Doremus]].

The beneficiaries under the policies were often their parents who did not need the money.  Viatical settlements offered a way to extract value from the policy while the policy owner was still alive.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt the time, the AIDS mortality rate was very high, and life expectancy after diagnosis was typically short.<ref name=\"LISA History\" />  Investors were reasonably sure that they would collect in a relatively short time.  This combination of events caused a surge in viatical settlements as both investors and viators saw an opportunity for mutual benefit.\n\nA [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision from 1911 provides the legal basis for viatical settlements.<ref name=\"LISA History\" />  In Grigsby v. Russell, 222 U.S. 149 (1911), Dr. A. H. Grigsby treated a patient named John C. Burchard.<ref name=\"LISA History\" /> Mr. Burchard, being in need of a particular surgical operation, offered to sell Dr. Grigsby his life insurance policy in return for $100 and for agreeing to pay the remaining premiums.<ref name=\"LISA History\" /> Dr. Grigsby agreed and as a result, the first viatical settlement transaction was created.<ref name=\"LISA History\" /> When Mr. Burchard died, Dr. Grigsby attempted to collect the benefits.<ref name=\"LISA History\" /> An executor of Burchard\u2019s estate challenged Dr. Grigsby in Appeals Court and won.<ref name=\"LISA History\" /> The case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court where Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] delivered the opinion of the court.<ref name=\"LISA History\" /> He stated in relevant part that <blockquote>\u201cSo far as reasonable safety permits, it is desirable to give to life policies the ordinary characteristics of property. To deny the right to sell except to persons having such an interest is to diminish appreciably the value of the contract in the owner\u2019s hands.\u201d<ref name=\"LISA History\" /></blockquote>The Supreme Court's decision set forth the fundamental principle upon which the viatical settlement and later, the life settlement industry were based: a life insurance policy is private property, which can be assigned at the will of the owner.<ref name=\"LISA History\" />  Viatical settlements were rare for almost eight decades until the onset of the AIDS epidemic.<ref name=\"LISA History\" />\n\nEarly improper activities among a few bad actors produced a fear among consumers regarding viatical settlements.<ref name=\"LISA History\" /> {{Weasel inline|date=July 2019}}  Life insurers became concerned about individuals purchasing policies purely for speculative purposes.<ref name=\"LISA History\" />  Today, many states regulate viatical and life settlements and many more are developing legislation and regulations.<ref name=\"LISA History\" />  As of June 2011, the states that do not regulate viatical settlements are [[Wyoming]], [[South Dakota]], [[Missouri]], [[Alabama]], and [[South Carolina]].<ref name=\"map\">Regulation, Life Insurance Settlement Association, retrieved March 4, 2012, at http://www.lisassociation.org/vlsaamembers/legislative_maps/images/Reg-of-viatical-and-life-se.jpg</ref>  All other states regulate viatical settlements.<ref name=\"map\" />\n\nDespite the bad experience of some investors, viatical settlements remain an often valuable tool for the personal financial management of many ill people.

The beneficiaries under the policies were often their parents who did not need the money.  Viatical settlements offered a way to extract value from the policy while the policy owner was still alive.\n\nAt the time, the AIDS mortality rate was very high, and life expectancy after diagnosis was typically short.<ref name=\"LISA History\" />  Investors were reasonably sure that they would collect in a relatively short time.  This combination of events caused a surge in viatical settlements as both investors and viators saw an opportunity for mutual benefit.\n\nA [[U.S. Supreme Court]] decision from 1911 provides the legal basis for viatical settlements.<ref name=\"LISA History\" />  In Grigsby v. Russell, 222 U.S. 149 (1911), Dr. A. H. Grigsby treated a patient named John C. Burchard.<ref name=\"LISA History\" /> Mr. Burchard, being in need of a particular surgical operation, offered to sell Dr. Grigsby his life insurance policy in return for $100 and for agreeing to pay the remaining premiums.<ref name=\"LISA History\" /> Dr. Grigsby agreed and as a result, the first viatical settlement transaction was created.<ref name=\"LISA History\" /> When Mr. Burchard died, Dr. Grigsby attempted to collect the benefits.<ref name=\"LISA History\" /> An executor of Burchard\u2019s estate challenged Dr. Grigsby in Appeals Court and won.<ref name=\"LISA History\" /> The case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court where Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] delivered the opinion of the court.<ref name=\"LISA History\" /> He stated in relevant part that <blockquote>\u201cSo far as reasonable safety permits, it is desirable to give to life policies the ordinary characteristics of property. To deny the right to sell except to persons having such an interest is to diminish appreciably the value of the contract in the owner\u2019s hands.\u201d<ref name=\"LISA History\" /></blockquote>The Supreme Court's decision set forth the fundamental principle upon which the viatical settlement and later, the life settlement industry were based: a life insurance policy is private property, which can be assigned at the will of the owner.<ref name=\"LISA History\" />  Viatical settlements were rare for almost eight decades until the onset of the AIDS epidemic.<ref name=\"LISA History\" />\n\nEarly improper activities among a few bad actors produced a fear among consumers regarding viatical settlements.<ref name=\"LISA History\" /> {{Weasel inline|date=July 2019}}  Life insurers became concerned about individuals purchasing policies purely for speculative purposes.<ref name=\"LISA History\" />  Today, many states regulate viatical and life settlements and many more are developing legislation and regulations.<ref name=\"LISA History\" />  As of June 2011, the states that do not regulate viatical settlements are [[Wyoming]], [[South Dakota]], [[Missouri]], [[Alabama]], and [[South Carolina]].<ref name=\"map\">Regulation, Life Insurance Settlement Association, retrieved March 4, 2012, at http://www.lisassociation.org/vlsaamembers/legislative_maps/images/Reg-of-viatical-and-life-se.jpg</ref>  All other states regulate viatical settlements.<ref name=\"map\" />\n\nDespite the bad experience of some investors, viatical settlements remain an often valuable tool for the personal financial management of many ill people.

Early 20th century writers often engaged in [[yellow journalism]] focused on [[Sensationalism|sensationalistic]] aspects of the region's culture, such as [[moonshining]] and [[Appalachia#Feuds|clan feuding]], and often portrayed the region's inhabitants as uneducated and prone to impulsive acts of violence.

Introduction to ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. xix\u2013xxv.</ref>\n\nWhile endowed with abundant natural resources, Appalachia has long struggled and been associated with [[poverty]]. In the early 20th century, large-scale [[logging]] and [[coal mining]] firms brought wage-paying jobs and modern amenities to Appalachia, but by the 1960s the region had failed to capitalize on any long-term benefits<ref>{{cite web |last=Sokol |first=Anna |title=Economic Redevelopment in Appalachia: The Appalachian Regional Commission |url=http://www.umich.edu/~econdev/arc/ |publisher=University of Michigan |accessdate=August 9, 2013}}</ref> from these two industries. Beginning in the 1930s, the federal government sought to alleviate poverty in the Appalachian region with a series of [[New Deal]] initiatives, such as the construction of [[dam]]s to provide cheap electricity and the implementation of better farming practices. On March 9, 1965, the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.irp.wisc.edu/newsevents/workshops/2011/participants/papers/12-Ziliak.pdf |title=The Appalachian Regional Development Act and Economic Change |last=Ziliak |first=James P. |date=September 16, 2010 |website= |publisher= |access-date=}}</ref> was created to further alleviate poverty in the region, mainly by diversifying the region's economy and helping to provide better health care and educational opportunities to the region's inhabitants. By 1990, Appalachia had largely joined the economic mainstream, but still lagged behind the rest of the nation in most economic indicators.<ref name=abramson1/>\n\n==Defining the Appalachian region==\n{{See also|Social and economic stratification in Appalachia|List of Appalachian Regional Commission counties}}\n[[File:William-goodell-frost-1914.jpg|thumb|200px|left|William G. Frost]]\n\nSince Appalachia lacks definite physiographical or topographical boundaries, there has been some disagreement over what exactly the region encompasses. The most commonly used modern definition of Appalachia is the one initially defined by the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]] in 1965 and expanded over subsequent decades.<ref name=abramson1 /> The region defined by the Commission currently includes 420 counties and eight [[Independent city (Virginia)|independent cities]] in 13 states, including all of [[West Virginia]], 14 counties in [[New York (state)|New York]], 52 in [[Pennsylvania]], 32 in [[Ohio]], 3 in [[Maryland]], 54 in [[Kentucky]], 25 counties and 8 [[Administrative divisions of Virginia#Independent cities|cities]] in [[Virginia]],<ref>In Virginia, all municipalities incorporated as \"cities\" are legally separate from counties.</ref> 29 in [[North Carolina]], 52 in [[Tennessee]], 6 in [[South Carolina]], 37 in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 37 in [[Alabama]], and 24 in [[Mississippi]].<ref name=arc1 /> When the Commission was established, counties were added based on economic need, however, rather than any cultural parameters.<ref name=abramson1 />\n\nThe first major attempt to map Appalachia as a distinctive cultural region came in the 1890s with the efforts of [[Berea College]] president William Goodell Frost, whose \"Appalachian America\" included 194 counties in 8 states.<ref name=williams>John Alexander Williams, ''Appalachia: A History'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2002)</ref>{{rp|11\u201314}} In 1921, John C. Campbell published ''The Southern Highlander and His Homeland'' in which he modified Frost's map to include 254 counties in 9 states. A landmark survey of the region in the following decade by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] defined the region as consisting of 206 counties in 6 states. In 1984, Karl Raitz and Richard Ulack expanded the ARC's definition to include 445 counties in 13 states, although they removed all counties in Mississippi and added two in [[New Jersey]]. Historian John Alexander Williams, in his 2002 book ''Appalachia: A History'', distinguished between a \"core\" Appalachian region consisting of 164 counties in West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia, and a greater region defined by the ARC.<ref name=abramson1 />\n\nIn the ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (2006), [[Appalachian State University]] historian [[Howard Dorgan]] suggested the term \"Old Appalachia\" for the region's cultural boundaries, noting an academic tendency to ignore the southwestern and northeastern extremes of the ARC's pragmatic definition.<ref>Abramson, Rudy, and Jean Haskell, eds., ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1287\u201388.</ref> [[Sean Trende]], senior elections analyst at ''[[RealClearPolitics]]'', defines \"Greater Appalachia\" in his 2012 book ''The Lost Majority'' as including both the [[Appalachian Mountains]] region ([[Western Virginia|western Virginia]] and [[Western North Carolina|North Carolina]], the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region in western South Carolina, West Virginia, [[Appalachian Ohio|southern Ohio]], the [[Cumberland Plateau]] in [[Eastern Kentucky Coalfield|eastern Kentucky]], [[East Tennessee]], [[North Georgia|northern Georgia]], [[North Alabama|Alabama]], and [[North Mississippi|Mississippi]]) and the [[Upland South]] ([[Southern Indiana|southern Indiana]] and [[Southern Illinois|Illinois]], the [[Bluegrass region|Bluegrass]], [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain|Mississippi Plateau]], [[Western Coal Field]], and [[Jackson Purchase]] regions in central and western Kentucky, [[Middle Tennessee|Middle]] and [[West Tennessee]], [[Missouri]], the [[Ozarks]] in Arkansas, [[Little Dixie (Oklahoma)|Little Dixie]] and [[Southwestern Oklahoma]], [[North Texas|North]] and [[East Texas]], and the [[Texas Hill Country]]) following [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Ulster Protestant]] migrations to the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Midwestern United States]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trende|first=Sean|author-link=Sean Trende|title=The Lost Majority: Why the Future of Government Is Up for Grabs\u2013and Who Will Take It|year=2012|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|isbn=978-0230116467|pages=xxii\u2013xxviii|url=https://archive.org/details/lostmajoritywhyf0000tren}}</ref>\n\n===Toponymy and pronunciation===\n[[File:Gutierrez-1562-detail-app1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Detail of Gutierrez' 1562 map showing the first known cartographic appearance of a variant of the name \"Appalachia\"]]\n\nWhile exploring inland along the northern coast of [[Florida]] in 1528, the members of the [[Narv\u00e1ez expedition]], including [[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]], found a [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] village near present-day [[Tallahassee, Florida]], whose name they transcribed as ''Apalchen'' or ''Apalachen'' ({{IPA-all|apa\u02c8lat\u0283en}}). The name was soon altered by the Spanish to [[Apalachee]] and used as a name for the tribe and region spreading well inland to the north. [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]]'s expedition first entered Apalachee territory on June 15, 1528, and applied the name.

The first cartographic appearance of ''Apalchen'' is on [[Diego Guti\u00e9rrez (cartographer)|Diego Guti\u00e9rrez]]'s map of 1562; the first use for the mountain range is the map of [[Jacques le Moyne de Morgues]] in 1565.<ref>Walls, David (1977), \"On the Naming of Appalachia\", in ''An Appalachian Symposium'', pp. 56\u201376.</ref> Le Moyne was also the first European to apply \"Apalachen\" specifically to a mountain range as opposed to a village, native tribe, or a southeastern region of North America.<ref>Blaustein, Richard (2003), ''The Thistle and the Brier: Historical Links and Cultural Parallels Between Scotland and Appalachia'', p. 21.</ref>\n\nThe name was not commonly used for the whole mountain range until the late 19th century. A competing and often more popular name was the \"[[Allegheny Mountains]]\", \"Alleghenies\", and even \"Alleghania\".

The earliest discovered site is the [[Meadowcroft Rockshelter]] in [[Washington County, Pennsylvania]], which some scientists claim is pre-[[Clovis culture]]. Several other [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic period]] (8000\u20131000 BC) archaeological sites have been identified in the region, such as the [[St. Albans, West Virginia|St. Albans]] site in West Virginia and the [[Icehouse Bottom]] site in Tennessee. In the 16th century, the de Soto and [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] expeditions explored the mountains of South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia, and encountered complex agrarian societies consisting of [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking]] inhabitants. De Soto indicated that much of the region west of the mountains was part of the domain of [[Coosa chiefdom|Coosa]], a [[paramount chief]]dom centered around a village complex in northern Georgia.<ref>Hudson, Charles. ''The Juan Pardo Expeditions: Explorations of the Carolinas and Tennessee, 1566\u20131568'' (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2005), p. 17.</ref> By the time English explorers arrived in Appalachia in the late 17th century, the central part of the region was controlled by [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes (namely the [[Shawnee]]) and the southern part of the region was controlled by the [[Cherokee]]. The [[New France|French]] based in modern-day [[Quebec]] also made inroads into the northern areas of the region in modern-day New York state and Pennsylvania. By the mid 18th century the French had outposts such as [[Fort Duquesne]] and [[Fort Le Boeuf]] controlling the access points of the [[Allegheny River]] valley and upper [[Ohio valley]] after exploration by [[Celeron de Bienville]].\n\n[[File:George Caleb Bingham - Daniel Boone escorting settlers through the Cumberland Gap.jpg|thumb|''Daniel Boone Escorting Settlers through the [[Cumberland Gap]]'' ([[George Caleb Bingham]], oil on canvas, 1851\u201352)]]\n\nEuropean migration into Appalachia began in the 18th century. As lands in eastern Pennsylvania, the [[Tidewater region of Virginia]] and [[the Carolinas]] filled up, immigrants began pushing further and further westward into the Appalachian Mountains. A relatively large proportion of the early [[backcountry]] immigrants were [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]]\u2014later known as \"[[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]]\"\u2014 who were seeking cheaper land and freedom from [[Quakers|Quaker]] leaders, many of whom considered the Scotch-Irish \"savages\". Others included [[Germans]] from the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] region and English settlers from the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] country. Between 1730 and 1763, immigrants trickled into [[western Pennsylvania]], the [[Shenandoah Valley]] area of Virginia, and [[western Maryland]]. [[Thomas Walker (explorer)|Thomas Walker's]] discovery of [[Cumberland Gap]] in 1750 and the end of the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763 lured settlers deeper into the mountains, namely to upper [[east Tennessee]], northwestern North Carolina, [[upstate South Carolina]], and central Kentucky. Between 1790 and 1840, a series of treaties with the Cherokee and other Native American tribes opened up lands in [[north Georgia (U.S. state)|north Georgia]], [[north Alabama]], the [[Tennessee Valley]], the [[Cumberland Plateau]] regions, and the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] along what is now the Tennessee-North Carolina border.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|30\u201344}} The last of these treaties culminated in the removal of the bulk of the Cherokee population (as well as [[Choctaw]], [[Chickasaw]] and others) from the region via the [[Trail of Tears]] from 1831 until 1838.\n\n===The Appalachian frontier===\n[[File:Earnest-fort-house-tn1.jpg|thumb|225px|right|The Earnest Fort-house in [[Greene County, Tennessee]]. Built around 1782 during the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars]], it is located just south of [[Chuckey, Tennessee|Chuckey]] on the banks of the [[Nolichucky River]].]]\n\nAppalachian frontiersmen have long been romanticized for their ruggedness and self-sufficiency. A typical depiction of an Appalachian pioneer involves a hunter wearing a [[coonskin cap]] and [[buckskins|buckskin clothing]], and sporting a long rifle and shoulder-strapped [[powder horn]]. Perhaps no single figure symbolizes the Appalachian pioneer more than [[Daniel Boone]] (1734\u20131820), a [[long hunter]] and [[surveying|surveyor]] instrumental in the early settlement of Kentucky and Tennessee. Like Boone, Appalachian pioneers moved into areas largely separated from \"civilization\" by high mountain ridges, and had to fend for themselves against the elements. As many of these early settlers were living on Native American lands, attacks from Native American tribes were a continuous threat until the 19th century.<ref name=Caudill>Caudill, Harry. ''Night Comes to the Cumberlands''</ref>{{rp|7\u201313, 19}}\n\nAs early as the 18th century, Appalachia (then known simply as the \"backcountry\") began to distinguish itself from its wealthier lowland and coastal neighbors to the east. Frontiersmen often bickered with lowland and [[tidewater region|tidewater]] \"elites\" over taxes, sometimes to the point of armed revolts such as the [[War of the Regulation|Regulator Movement]] (1767\u20131771) in North Carolina.<ref name=drake>Drake, Richard. ''A History of Appalachia'' (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2001)</ref>{{rp|59\u201369}} In 1778, at the height of the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]], backwoodsmen from Pennsylvania, Virginia, and what is now Kentucky took part in [[George Rogers Clark]]'s [[Illinois campaign]]. Two years later, a group of Appalachian frontiersmen known as the [[Overmountain Men]] routed British forces at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] after rejecting a call by the British to disarm.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|64\u201368}} After the war, residents throughout the Appalachian backcountry\u2014especially the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] region in western Pennsylvania, and [[antebellum South|antebellum]] northwestern Virginia (now the north-central part of West Virginia) \u2014 refused to pay a tax placed on whiskey by the new American government, leading to what became known as the [[Whiskey Rebellion]].<ref name=williams/>{{rp|118\u201319}} The resulting tighter Federal controls in the Monongahela valley resulted in many whiskey/bourbon makers migrating via the Ohio River to Kentucky and Tennessee where the industry could flourish.\n\n===Early 19th century===\nIn the early 19th century, the rift between the [[yeoman]] farmers of Appalachia and their wealthier lowland counterparts continued to grow, especially as the latter dominated most state legislatures. People in Appalachia began to feel slighted over what they considered unfair taxation methods and lack of state funding for improvements (especially for roads). In the northern half of the region, the lowland \"elites\" consisted largely of industrial and business interests, whereas in the parts of the region south of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]], the lowland elites consisted of large-scale land-owning [[plantations in the American South|planters]].<ref name=drake/>{{rp|59\u201369}} The [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], formed in the 1830s, drew widespread support from disaffected Appalachians.\n\nTensions between the mountain counties and state governments sometimes reached the point of mountain counties threatening to break off and form separate states. In 1832, bickering between western Virginia and eastern Virginia over the state's constitution led to calls on both sides for the state's separation into two states.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|141}} In 1841, Tennessee state senator (and later U.S. president) [[Andrew Johnson]] introduced legislation in the [[Tennessee Senate]] calling for the creation of a separate state in East Tennessee. The proposed state would have been known as \"Frankland\" and would have invited like-minded mountain counties in Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama to join it.<ref>Lacy, Eric.

Sentiments in northern Appalachia had shifted to the pro-[[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. In southern Appalachia, abolitionists still constituted a radical minority, although several smaller opposition parties (most of which were both pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and pro-slavery) were formed to oppose the planter-dominated [[Southern Democrats]]. As states in the southern United States moved toward [[secession]], a majority of Southern Appalachians still supported the Union.<ref name=mckinney1>Gordon McKinney, \"The Civil War\". ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1579\u201381.</ref> In 1861, a [[Minnesota]] newspaper identified 161 counties in Southern Appalachia\u2014which the paper called \"Alleghenia\"\u2014where Union support remained strong, and which might provide crucial support for the defeat of the Confederacy.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|11\u201314}} However, many of these Unionists\u2014especially in the mountain areas of North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama\u2014were \"conditional\" Unionists in that they opposed secession, but also opposed violence to prevent secession, and thus when their respective state legislatures voted to secede, their support shifted to the Confederacy.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|160\u201365}} Kentucky sought to remain neutral at the outset of the conflict, opting not to supply troops to either side. After Virginia voted to secede, several mountain counties in northwestern Virginia rejected the ordinance and with the help of the [[Union Army]] established a separate state, admitted to the Union as West Virginia in 1863. However, half the counties included in the new state, comprising two-thirds of its territory, were secessionist and pro-Confederate.<ref>Curry, Richard O. ''A House Divided, Statehood Politics & the Copperhead Movement in West Virginia'', Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1964, pgs. 141\u2013147.

While there were two major theaters of operation in the region\u2014namely the [[Shenandoah Valley]] of Virginia (and present-day West Virginia) and the [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] area along the Tennessee-Georgia border\u2014much of the violence was caused by [[bushwhacker]]s and [[guerrilla war]]. The northernmost battles of the entire war were fought in Appalachia with the [[Battle of Buffington Island]] and the [[Battle of Salineville]] resulting from [[Morgan's Raid]]. Large numbers of livestock were killed (grazing was an important part of Appalachia's economy), and numerous farms were destroyed, pillaged, or neglected.<ref name=mckinney1 /> The actions of both Union and Confederate armies left many inhabitants in the region resentful of government authority and suspicious of outsiders for decades after the war.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|109\u201323}} <ref name=Caudill/>{{rp|39\u201345}}\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th centuries===\n\n====Economic boom====\n[[File:West-virginia-mine-entrance1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Entrance to mine shaft in West Virginia, photographed by [[Lewis Hine]] in 1908]]\n\nAfter the war, northern parts of Appalachia experienced an economic boom, while economies in the southern parts of the region stagnated, especially as Southern Democrats regained control of their respective state legislatures at the end of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].<ref name=mckinney1 /> [[Pittsburgh]] as well as [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] grew into major industrial centers, especially regarding iron and steel production. By 1900, the Chattanooga area and north Georgia and northern Alabama had experienced similar changes due to manufacturing booms in [[Atlanta]] and [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] at the edge of the Appalachian region. Railroad construction between the 1880s and early 20th century gave the greater nation access to the vast coalfields in central Appalachia, making the [[Appalachian Land Ownership Survey|economy]] in that part of the region practically synonymous with coal mining. As the nationwide demand for lumber skyrocketed, lumber firms turned to the virgin forests of southern Appalachia, using sawmill and logging railroad innovations to reach remote timber stands. The [[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]] area of Tennessee and Virginia and the [[Kanawha Valley]] of West Virginia became major [[petrochemical]] production centers.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|131\u2013141}}\n\n====Stereotypes====\n{{main|Appalachian stereotypes}}\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries also saw the development of various regional stereotypes. Attempts by President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] to enforce the whiskey tax in the late 1870s led to an explosion in violence between Appalachian \"[[moonshine]]rs\" and federal \"revenuers\" that lasted through the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] period in the 1920s.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|187\u2013193}} The breakdown of authority and law enforcement during the Civil War may have contributed to an increase in clan feuding, which by the 1880s was reported to be a problem across most of Kentucky's Cumberland region as well as [[Carter County, Tennessee|Carter County]] in Tennessee, [[Carroll County, Virginia|Carroll County]] in Virginia, and [[Mingo County, West Virginia|Mingo]] and [[Logan County, West Virginia|Logan]] counties in West Virginia.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|109\u201323}} <ref name=williams/>{{rp|187\u201393}} Regional writers from this period such as [[Mary Noailles Murfree]] and [[Horace Kephart]] liked to focus on such sensational aspects of mountain culture, leading readers outside the region to believe they were more widespread than in reality. In an 1899 article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', [[Berea College]] president William G. Frost attempted to redefine the inhabitants of Appalachia as \"noble mountaineers\"\u2014relics of the nation's pioneer period whose isolation had left them unaffected by modern times.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|109\u201323}}\n\nToday, residents of Appalachia are viewed by many Americans as uneducated and unrefined, resulting in culture-based stereotyping and [[discrimination]] in many areas, including employment and housing. Such discrimination has prompted some to seek redress under prevailing federal and state [[civil rights]] laws.<ref>E.g. see Walker, Matthew H. \"Discrimination Based on National Origin and Ancestry: How the Goals of Equality Have Failed to Address the Pervasive Stereotyping of the Appalachian Tradition\", 38 ''U. Dayton L. Rev.'' 335 (2013).</ref>\n\n====Feuds====\nAppalachia, and especially Kentucky, became nationally known for its violent [[feud]]s, especially in the remote mountain districts. They pitted the men in extended clans against each other for decades, often using assassination and arson as weapons, along with [[ambush]]es, [[gunfight]]s, and pre-arranged [[shootout]]s. The infamous [[Hatfield\u2013McCoy feud|Hatfield-McCoy Feud]] of the 19th century was the best known of these family feuds. Some of the feuds were continuations of violent local Civil War episodes.<ref>Otterbein, Keith F. \"Five Feuds: An Analysis of Homicides in Eastern Kentucky in the Late Nineteenth Century\", ''American Anthropologist'', June 2000, Vol. 102 Issue 2, pp 231\u201343, provides a theoretical analysis.</ref> Journalists often wrote about the violence, using stereotypes that \"city folks\" had developed about Appalachia; they interpreted the feuds as the natural products of profound ignorance, poverty, and isolation, and perhaps even [[inbreeding]]. In reality, the leading participants were typically well-to-do local elites with networks of clients who were fighting for local political power.<ref>Billings, Dwight B., and [[Kathleen M. Blee]], \"'Where the Sun Set Crimson and the Moon Rose Red': Writing Appalachia and the Kentucky Mountain Feuds\", ''Southern Cultures'', Summer 1996, Vol. 2 Issue 3/4, pp 329\u2013352</ref>\n\n===Modern Appalachia===\nLogging firms' rapid devastation of the forests of the Appalachians sparked a movement among [[conservation movement|conservationists]] to preserve what remained and allow the land to \"heal\". In 1911, Congress passed the [[Weeks Act]], giving the federal government authority to create [[United States National Forest|national forests]] east of the Mississippi River and control timber harvesting. Regional writers and business interests led a movement to create national parks in the eastern United States similar to [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]] and [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] in the west, culminating in the creation of the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] in Tennessee and North Carolina, [[Shenandoah National Park]] in Virginia, [[Cumberland Gap National Historical Park]] in Kentucky,  Virginia and Tennessee, and the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] (connecting the two) in the 1930s.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|200\u2013210}} During the same period, New England forester [[Benton MacKaye]] led the movement to build the {{convert|2175|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Appalachian Trail]], stretching from Georgia to [[Maine]].\n\nBy the 1950s, poor farming techniques and the loss of jobs to [[mechanization]] in the mining industry had left much of central and southern Appalachia poverty-stricken. The lack of jobs also led to widespread difficulties with [[emigration|outmigration]]. Beginning in the 1930s, federal agencies such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] began investing in the Appalachian region.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|310\u201312}} [[Sociologist]]s such as James Brown and Cratis Williams and authors such as [[Harry Caudill]] and [[Michael Harrington]] brought attention to the region's plight in the 1960s, prompting Congress to create the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]] in 1965.

Early education in the region evolved from teaching Christian morality and learning to read the [[Bible]] into small, [[one-room school]]houses that convened in months when children were not needed to help with farm work. After the Civil War, mandatory education laws and state assistance helped larger communities begin to establish graded schools and high schools. During the same period, many of the region's institutions of higher education were established or greatly expanded.<ref name=deyoung>DeYoung, Alan, Introduction to Education section, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1517\u201321.</ref> In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, service organizations such as [[Pi Beta Phi]] and various religious organizations established [[settlement school]]s and mission schools in the region's more rural areas.<ref>Alvic, Philis, \"Settlement, Mission, and Sponsored Schools\", ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), p. 1551.</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, national trends began to have more of an effect on education in Appalachia, sometimes clashing with the region's traditional values. The [[Scopes Trial]]\u2014the nation's most publicized debate over the teaching of the theory of [[evolution]]\u2014took place in [[Dayton, Tennessee]], in southern Appalachia in 1925. In spite of consolidation and centralization, schools in Appalachia struggled to keep up with federal and state demands into the 21st century. Since 2001, a number of the region's public schools were threatened with loss of funding due to difficulties fulfilling the demands of [[No Child Left Behind]].<ref name=deyoung />\n\n===Music===\n{{Main article|Appalachian music}}\nAppalachian music is one of the best-known manifestations of Appalachian culture. Traditional Appalachian music is derived primarily from the English and Scottish [[ballad]] tradition and Irish and Scottish [[fiddle]] music. African-American [[blues]] musicians played a significant role in developing the instrumental aspects of Appalachian music, most notably with the introduction of the five-stringed [[banjo]]\u2014one of the region's iconic symbols\u2014in the late 18th century. Another instrument known in Appalachian culture was the [[Appalachian dulcimer]] which, in a practical way, is a guitar-shaped instrument laid on its side with a flat bottom and the strings plucked in a manner to make alternating notes.\n\nIn the years following World War I, British folklorist [[Cecil Sharp]] brought attention to Southern Appalachia when he noted that its inhabitants still sang hundreds of English and Scottish ballads that had been passed down to them from their ancestors. Commercial recordings of Appalachian musicians in the 1920s would have a significant impact on the development of [[country music]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and [[old-time music]]. Appalachian music saw a resurgence in popularity during the [[American folk music revival]] of the 1960s, when musicologists such as [[Mike Seeger]], [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]], and [[Ralph Rinzler]] traveled to remote parts of the region in search of musicians unaffected by modern music. Today, dozens of annual music festivals held throughout the region preserve the Appalachian music tradition.<ref>Olson, Ted, \"Music \u2013 Introduction\". ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1109\u201320.</ref>\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:Hazel-creek-proctor-nc1.jpg|210px|thumb|Former site of [[Proctor, North Carolina]], setting of [[Horace Kephart|Kephart's]] book, ''[[Our Southern Highlanders]]]]\nEarly Appalachian literature typically centered on the observations of people from outside the region, such as [[Henry Timberlake]]'s ''Memoirs'' (1765) and [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s ''[[Notes on the State of Virginia]]'' (1784), although there are notable exceptions, including [[Davy Crockett]]'s ''A Narrative of the Life of Davy Crockett'' (1834). Travellers' accounts published in 19th-century magazines gave rise to Appalachian [[American literary regionalism|local color]], which reached its height with [[George Washington Harris]]'s Sut Lovingood character of the 1860s and native novelists such as [[Mary Noailles Murfree]]. Works such as [[Rebecca Harding Davis]]'s ''Life in the Iron Mills'' (1861), [[Emma Bell Miles]]' ''The Spirit of the Mountains'' (1905), Catherine Marshall's ''[[Christy (novel)|Christy]]'' (1912), [[Horace Kephart]]'s ''[[Our Southern Highlanders]]'' (1913) marked a shift in the region's literature from local color to realism. The transition from an agrarian society to an industrial society and its effects on Appalachia are captured in works such as [[Olive Tilford Dargan]]'s ''Call Home to the Heart'' (1932), [[Agnes Sligh Turnbull]]'s ''[[The Rolling Years]]'' (1936), [[James Still]]'s ''The River of Earth'' (1940), [[Harriette Simpson Arnow]]'s ''The Dollmaker'' (1954), and [[Harry Caudill]]'s ''[[Night Comes to the Cumberlands]]'' (1962). In the 1970s and 1980s, the rise of authors like [[Breece D'J Pancake]], [[Dorothy Allison]], and [[Lisa Alther]] brought greater literary diversity to the region.<ref name=toney>Edwards, Grace Toney, \"Literature \u2013 Introduction\", ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1035\u201339.</ref>\n\nAlong with the above-mentioned, some of Appalachia's best known writers include [[James Agee]] (''[[A Death in the Family]]''), [[Anne W. Armstrong]] (''This Day and Time''), [[Wendell Berry]] (''Hannah Coulter'', ''The Unforeseen Wilderness: An Essay on Kentucky's Red River Gorge'', ''Selected Poems of Wendell Berry''), [[Jesse Stuart]] (''Taps for Private Tussie'', ''The Thread That Runs So True''), [[Denise Giardina]] (''The Unquiet Earth'', ''Storming Heaven''), [[Lee Smith (fiction author)|Lee Smith]] (''Fair and Tender Ladies'', ''On Agate Hill''), [[Silas House]] (''Clay's Quilt'', ''A Parchment of Leaves''), [[Wilma Dykeman]] (''The Far Family'', ''The Tall Woman''), [[Keith Maillard]] (''Alex Driving South'', ''Light in the Company of Women'', ''Hazard Zones'', ''Gloria'', ''Running'', ''Morgantown'', ''Lyndon Johnson and the Majorettes'', ''Looking Good'')  [[Maurice Manning (poet)|Maurice Manning]] (''Bucolics'', ''A Companion for Owls''), Anne Shelby (''Appalachian Studies'', ''We Keep a Store''), [[George Ella Lyon]] (''Borrowed Children'', ''Don't You Remember?''), [[Pamela Duncan (novelist)|Pamela Duncan]] (''Moon Women'', ''The Big Beautiful''), [[David Joy (author)|David Joy]] (\"Where All Light Tends to Go\", \"The Weight of This World\"), [[Chris Offutt]] (''No Heroes'', ''The Good Brother''), [[Charles Frazier]] (''[[Cold Mountain (novel)|Cold Mountain]]'', ''Thirteen Moons''), [[Sharyn McCrumb]] (''The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter''), [[Robert Morgan (poet)|Robert Morgan]] (''Gap Creek''), [[Jim Wayne Miller]] (''The Brier Poems''), [[Gurney Norman]] (''Divine Right's Trip'', ''Kinfolks''), [[Ron Rash]] (''Serena''), [[Elizabeth Madox Roberts]] (\"The Great Meadow, \"The Time of Man\"), [[Thomas Wolfe]] (''Look Homeward Angel'', ''You Can't Go Home Again''), [[Rachel Carson]] (''[[The Sea Around Us]]'', ''[[Silent Spring]]''; [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]), and [[Jeannette Walls]] (''[[The Glass Castle]]'').\n\nAppalachian literature crosses with the larger genre of [[Southern literature]]. Internationally renowned writers such as [[William Faulkner]] and [[Cormac McCarthy]] have made notable contributions to the American canon with tales set within Appalachia. McCarthy's ''[[Suttree]]'' (1979) is an intense vision of the squalidness and brutality of life along the [[Tennessee River]], in the heart of Appalachia. Other McCarthy novels set in Appalachia include ''[[The Orchard Keeper]]'' (1968) and ''[[Child of God]]'' (1973). Appalachia also serves as the origin point for the kid, the protagonist of McCarthy's Western masterpiece ''[[Blood Meridian]]''. Faulkner's hometown of [[Oxford, Mississippi]], is on the borderlands of what is considered Appalachia, but his fictional [[Yoknapatawpha]] should be considered part of the region.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Almost all of the fiction which earned him the Nobel Prize is set there, including ''[[Light in August]]'' and ''[[Absalom, Absalom]]''.\n\n===Folklore===\n[[File:John Henry-27527.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Statue of legendary railroad worker [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] in [[Talcott, West Virginia]]]]\n\nAppalachian folklore has a strong mixture of European, Native American (especially [[Cherokee]]), and Biblical influences. The Cherokee taught the region's early European pioneers how to plant and cultivate crops such as [[maize|corn]] and [[squash (plant)|squash]] and how to find edible plants such as [[Allium tricoccum|ramps]].<ref name=handbook /> The Cherokee also passed along their knowledge of the medicinal properties of hundreds of native herbs and roots, and how to prepare tonics from such plants.<ref name=handbook /> Before the introduction of modern agricultural techniques in the region in the 1930s and 1940s, many Appalachian farmers followed the Biblical tradition of planting by \"the signs\", such as the [[lunar phase|phases of the moon]], or when certain weather conditions occurred.<ref name=handbook />\n\nCherokee folklore continues to influence storytelling in the Appalachians, including depictions and characteristics of regional animals. As told by [[Eastern Band Cherokee]] and [[western North Carolina]] storyteller Jerry Wolfe, these creatures include the [[chipmunk]], also known as \"seven stripes\" from an angry [[bear]] scratching him down the back\u2014four claw marks and the spaces in between making seven\u2014and the [[Agkistrodon contortrix|copperhead]] who sneaks and thieves his way into becoming venomous.<ref>Kelley, Saundra Gerrell (2011). ''Southern Appalachian Storytellers: Interviews with Sixteen Keepers of the Oral Tradition''. Jefferson: McFarland Publishing. p. 205\u201307.</ref>\n\nAppalachian folk tales are rooted in English, Scottish, and Irish fairy tales, as well as regional heroic figures and events. [[Jack tales]], which tend to revolve around the exploits of a simple-but-dedicated figure named \"[[Jack (hero)|Jack]]\", are popular at story-telling festivals. Other stories involve wild animals, such as hunting tales. In the industrial areas of western Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia the composite [[Joe Magarac]] steelworker story has been handed down. Regional folk heroes such as the railroad worker [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] and frontiersmen [[Davy Crockett]], [[Mike Fink]] and [[Johnny Appleseed]] are examples of real-life figures that evolved into popular folk tale subjects. Murder stories, such as [[Omie Wise]] and [[John Hardy (song)|John Hardy]], are popular subjects for Appalachian ballads. Ghost stories, or \"[[:wikt:haint|haint]] tales\" in regional English,<ref>''Dictionary of American Regional English'', Belknap Press, 1985</ref> are a common feature of southern oral and literary tradition.<ref>Flora, Joseph M., Lucinda Hardwick MacKethan, Todd W. Taylor, ''The Companion to Southern Literature'', [[Louisiana State University Press]], 2001, p. 304.</ref> Ghost stories native to the region include the story of the [[Greenbrier Ghost]], which is rooted in a [[Greenbrier County, West Virginia]], murder.<ref name=handbook>Deborah Thompson and Irene Moser, \"Appalachian Folklife\". ''A Handbook to Appalachia: An Introduction to the Region'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 143\u201356.</ref>\n\nSince the 1960s the [[Point Pleasant, West Virginia]], legend of [[Mothman]] has originated and been explored in popular culture including the 2002 film ''[[The Mothman Prophecies]]'' loosely retelling the original tale.\n\n===Urban Appalachians===\n{{Main article|Urban Appalachians}}\nUrban Appalachians are people from Appalachia who are living in metropolitan areas outside the Appalachian region. In the decades following the Great Depression and World War II, many Appalachian residents moved to industrial cities in the north and west in a migration that became known as the \"[[Hillbilly Highway]]\". Mechanization of coal mining during the 1950s and 1960s was the major source of unemployment in central Appalachia. Many migration streams covered relatively short distances, with West Virginians moving to [[Cleveland]] and other cities in eastern and central [[Ohio]], and eastern Kentuckians moving to [[Cincinnati]] and southwest Ohio in search of jobs. More distant cities like [[Detroit]] and [[Chicago]] attracted migrants from many states. Enclaves of Appalachian culture can still be found in some of these communities.<ref>''Appalachian Odyssey'', ed. Phillip J. Obermiller et al. (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2000).</ref>\n\n===Communications===\nIn the 1940s through the 1960s, [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], became a cultural center of the region because it had a [[clear-channel station|clear-channel]] [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] radio station, [[WWVA (AM)|WWVA]], which could be heard throughout the entirety of the eastern United States at night. Although Pittsburgh's [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] was a 50 kilowatt clear channel station that dated back to the early 1920s (as well as spanning all the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] in signal strength), WWVA prided itself on rural and farm programming that appealed to a wider audience in the rural region.  Cincinnati's [[WLW]] also was relied on by many in the central and northern areas of Appalachia.\n\nIn the southern part of the region, [[WSB-AM]] Atlanta and [[WSM-AM]] Nashville, flagship of the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', were major stations for the region's population during the 20th century, and remain strong in the sub-region.\n\n===Appalachian studies===\n{{Main article|Appalachian studies}}\nAppalachia as an academic interest was the product of a critical scholarship that emerged across the disciplines in the 1960s and 1970s. With a renewed interest in issues of power, scholars could not dismiss the social inequity, class conflict, and environmental destruction encountered by [[United States|America's]] so-called \"[[Hillbilly|hillbillies]]\". Appalachia's emergence in academia is a result of the intersection between social conditions and critical academic interests, and has resulted in the development of many [[Appalachian studies]] programs in colleges and universities across the region, as well as in the [[Appalachian Studies Association]].\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy of Appalachia traditionally rested on agriculture, mining, timber, and in the cities, manufacturing. Since the late 20th century, [[tourism]] and second-home developments have assumed an increasingly major role.\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[File:Maggie-tower-view-nc1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A highland pasture near [[Maggie Valley, North Carolina]]]]\n\nWhile the climate of the Appalachian region is suitable for agriculture, the region's hilly terrain greatly limits the size of the average farm, a problem exacerbated by population growth in the latter half of the 19th century. [[Subsistence agriculture|Subsistence farming]] was the backbone of the Appalachian economy throughout much of the 19th century, and while economies in places such as western Pennsylvania, the [[Great Appalachian Valley|Great Valley]] of Virginia, and the upper Tennessee Valley in east Tennessee, transitioned to a large-scale farming or manufacturing base around the time of the Civil War, subsistence farming remained an important part of the region's economy until the 1950s. In the early 20th century, Appalachian farmers were struggling to mechanize, and abusive farming practices had over the years left much of the already-limited farmland badly eroded. Various federal entities intervened in the 1930s to restore damaged areas and introduce less-harmful farming techniques. In recent decades, the concept of [[sustainable agriculture]] has been applied to the region's small farms, with some success. Nevertheless, the number of farms in the Appalachian region continues to dwindle, plunging from 354,748 farms on {{convert|47|e6acre|km2}} in 1969 to 230,050 farms on {{convert|35|e6acre|km2}} in 1997.<ref name=agintro>Best, Michael, and Curtis Wood, Introduction to the Agriculture section in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Appalachia]]'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 395\u2013402.</ref>\n\nEarly Appalachian farmers grew both crops introduced from their native Europe as well as crops native to North America (such as [[maize|corn]] and [[squash (plant)|squash]]). [[Tobacco]] has long been an important [[cash crop]] in Southern Appalachia, especially since the land is ill-suited for cash crops such as [[cotton]]. Apples have been grown in the region since the late 18th century, their cultivation being aided by the presence of thermal belts in the region's mountain valleys.  Hogs, which could [[free range]] in the region's abundant forests, often on [[chestnut]]s, were the most popular livestock among early Appalachian farmers. The [[American chestnut]] was also an important human food source until the [[chestnut blight]] struck in the 20th century. The early settlers also brought cattle and sheep to the region, which they would typically graze in highland meadows known as [[Appalachian balds|balds]] during the growing season when bottomlands were needed for crops. Cattle, mainly the [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]], [[Angus cattle|Angus]], and [[Charolais cattle|Charolais]] breeds, are now the region's chief livestock.<ref name=agintro />\n\n===Logging===\n[[File:Erwin-millpond-sawmill-wv1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sawmill and millpond in Erwin, West Virginia, photographed by [[Marion Post Wolcott]] in 1938]]\n\nThe mountains and valleys of Appalachia once contained what seemed to be an inexhaustible supply of timber. The poor roads, lack of railroads, and general inaccessibility of the region, however, prevented large-scale logging in most of the region throughout much of the 19th century. While logging firms were established in the Carolinas and the [[Kentucky River]] valley before the Civil War, most major firms preferred to harvest the more accessible timber stands in the Midwestern and Northeastern parts of the country. By the 1880s, these stands had been exhausted, and a spike in the demand for lumber forced logging firms to seek out the virgin forests of Appalachia.<ref name=paulson>Paulson, Linda Daily, \"Lumber Industry\". ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 501\u201304.</ref> The first major logging ventures in Appalachia transported logs using mule teams or rivers, the latter method sometimes employing [[splash dam]]s.<ref>Weals, Vic. ''The Last Train to Elkmont'' (Knoxville, Tennessee: Olden Press, 1993), pp. 1\u20138.</ref> In the 1890s, innovations such as the [[Shay locomotive]], the steam-powered loader, and the steam-powered [[skidder]] allowed massive harvesting of the most remote forest sections.<ref name=paulson />\n\nLogging in Appalachia reached its peak in the early 20th century, when firms such as the Ritter Lumber Company cut the virgin forests on an alarming scale, leading to the creation of [[United States National Forest|national forests]] in 1911 and similar state entities to better manage the region's timber resources. Arguably the most successful logging firm in Appalachia was the Georgia Hardwood Lumber Company, established in 1927 and renamed [[Georgia-Pacific]] in 1948 when it expanded nationally. Although logging in Appalachia declined as the industry shifted focus to the [[Pacific Northwest]] in the 1950s, rising overseas demand in the 1980s brought a resurgence in Appalachian logging. In 1987, there were 4,810 lumber firms operating in the region. In the late 1990s, the Appalachian lumber industry was a multibillion-dollar industry, employing 50,000 people in Tennessee, 26,000 in Kentucky, and 12,000 in West Virginia alone.<ref name=paulson /> By 1999, 1.4 million acres were extinguished as a result of [[deforestation]] by natural resource industries.{{Clarify|date=June 2017|Not clear how land can be \"extinguished\"}} Pollution from mining processes and disruption of the land ensued numerous environmental issues.

At present, however, the mining industry employs just 2% of the Appalachian workforce. The region's vast coalfield covers {{convert|63000|sqmi|km2}} between northern Pennsylvania and central Alabama, mostly along the [[Cumberland Plateau]] and [[Allegheny Plateau]] regions. Most mining activity has been concentrated in eastern Kentucky, southwestern Virginia, West Virginia, and western Pennsylvania, with smaller operations in [[western Maryland]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Alabama]]. The [[Pittsburgh coal seam]], which has produced 13 billion tons of coal since the early 19th century, has been called the world's most valuable mineral deposit. There are over 60 major coal seams in West Virginia, and over 80 in eastern Kentucky. Most of the coal mined is [[bituminous coal|bituminous]], although significant [[anthracite]] deposits exist on the fringe of the region in central Pennsylvania.<ref name=abramsoncoal>Abramson, Rudy, \"Bituminous Coal Industry\".

Hundreds of thousands of workers poured into the region from across the United States and from overseas, essentially overhauling the cultural makeup of [[Eastern Kentucky Coalfield|eastern Kentucky]], West Virginia, and western Pennsylvania. Mining corporations gained considerable influence in state and municipal governments, especially as they often owned the entire towns in which the miners lived. The mining industry was vulnerable to economic downturns, however, and booms and busts were frequent, with major booms occurring during World War I and II, and the worst bust occurring during the Great Depression. The Appalachian mining industry also saw some of the nation's bloodiest labor strife between the 1890s and the 1930s. Mining-related injuries and deaths were not uncommon, and ailments such as [[coalworker's pneumoconiosis|black lung disease]] afflicted miners throughout the 20th century. After World War II, innovations in mechanization (such as [[longwall mining]]) and competition from oil and natural gas led to a decline in the region's mining operations.<ref name=abramsoncoal /> Environmental restrictions, such as those placed on high-[[sulfur]] coal in the 1980s, brought further mine closures. While with annual earnings of $55,000, Appalachian miners make more than most other local workers, Appalachian coal mining employed just under 50,000 in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.org/pdf/c_profile.pdf |format=PDF |title=Profile of the U.S. Coal Miner \u2013 2007 |publisher=[[National Mining Association]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.org/pdf/c_employment_state_region_method.pdf |format=PDF |title=U.S. Coal Mine Employment by State, Region and Method of Mining \u2013 2007 |publisher=National Mining Association}}</ref>\n\nCoal mining has made a comeback in some regions in the early 21st century because of the increased prominence of [[Consol Energy]], based in [[Pittsburgh]].

Factory construction increased greatly after the Civil War, and the region experienced a manufacturing boom between 1890 and 1930. This economic shift led to a mass migration from small farms and rural areas to large urban centers, causing the populations of cities such as Birmingham, [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], and [[Asheville, North Carolina]], to swell exponentially. Manufacturing in the region suffered a setback during the Great Depression, but recovered during World War II and peaked in the 1950s and 1960s. However, difficulties paying retiree benefits, environmental struggles, and the signing of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) in 1994 led to a decline in the region's manufacturing operations. Pittsburgh lost 44% of its factory jobs in the 1980s, and between 1970 and 2001, the number of [[apparel]] workers in the Appalachian region decreased from 250,000 to 83,000 and the number of textile workers decreased from 275,000 to 193,000.<ref name=hursteoa>Hurst, Jack, Introduction to Business, Technology, and Industry section, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee, 2006), pp. 441\u201347.</ref>\n\n[[U.S. Steel]], founded in Pittsburgh in 1901, was the world's first corporation with more than a billion dollars in initial capitalization.<ref name=hursteoa /> Another Pittsburgh company, [[Alcoa]], helped establish the nation's [[aluminum]] industry in the early 20th century, and has had a significant impact on the economies of western Pennsylvania and east Tennessee.<ref>Barnett, Janice Willis, \"Aluminum Industry\", ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 449\u201351.</ref> [[Union Carbide]] built the world's first [[petrochemical]] plant in [[Clendenin, West Virginia]], in 1920, and in subsequent years the [[Kanawha River|Kanawha Valley]] became known as the \"Chemical Capital of the World\".<ref>Egan, Martha Avaleen, \"Chemical Industry\", ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee, 2006), pp. 468\u201371.</ref> [[Eastman Chemical]], also established in 1920, is Tennessee's largest single employer.

Along with the [[mineral spring]]s, the cool and clear air of the range's high elevations provided an escape for lowland elites, and elaborate hotels\u2014such as [[The Greenbrier]] in West Virginia and the [[Balsam Mountain Inn]] in North Carolina\u2014were built throughout the region's remote valleys and mountain slopes. The end of World War I (which opened up travel opportunities to Europe) and the arrival of the automobile (which changed the nation's vacation habits) led to the demise of all but a few of the region's spa resorts. The establishment of national parks in the 1930s brought an explosion of tourist traffic to the region, but created problems with [[urban sprawl]] in the various host communities.

Many Appalachian people<!--how many?--> feared that the birth of a new modernized Appalachia would lead to the death of their traditional values and heritage. Because of the isolation of the region, Appalachian people had been unable to catch up to the modernization that lowlanders have achieved. In the 1960s, many people in Appalachia had a [[standard of living]] comparable to [[Third World]] countries'.

New roads, schools, health care facilities, water and sewer systems, and other improvements have brought a better life to many Appalachian residents. In the 1960s, 219 [[county (United States)|counties]] in the 13-state Appalachian Region were considered economically distressed. Now that list has been cut by more than half, to 82 counties, but these are \"hard-core\" pockets of poverty, seemingly impervious to all efforts at improving their lot.<ref name=\"Arc\">Appalachian Regional Commission [http://www.arc.gov/index.do?nodeId=3301 Arc.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407182313/http://www.arc.gov/index.do?nodeId=3301 |date=April 7, 2009 }}</ref> [[Martin County, Kentucky]], the site of Johnson's 1964 speech, is one such county still ranked as \"distressed\" by the ARC. As of 2000, the [[per capita income]] in Martin County was $10,650, and 37% of its residents lived below the poverty line.\n\nLike Johnson, President [[Bill Clinton]] brought attention to the remaining areas of poverty in Appalachia. On July 5, 1999, he made a public statement concerning the situation in [[Tyner, Kentucky]]. Clinton told the enthusiastic crowd:\n\n{{quote|I'm here to make a simple point.

Blue Ridge Public Radio regional journalist Davin Eldridge broke the story at the time, reporting that the decision by Angel Hospital prompted the start of an online petition.  In one day, she about a thousand signatures were collected.<ref>https://www.bpr.org/post/mission-health-nixes-labor-services-franklin-proves-be-unpopular</ref>\n\nPoverty has caused health problems in the region.  The [[diseases of despair]], including the [[opioid epidemic in the United States]], and some [[diseases of poverty]] are prevalent in Appalachia.\n\n===Tax revenue and absentee land ownership===\nIn 1982 a seven-volume study conducted by the Appalachian Land Ownership Task Force was issued by the Appalachian Regional Commission which investigated the issue of absentee land ownership. The study covered 80 counties in six states approximating the area designated \"Southern Appalachia\" as defined by Thomas R. Ford's 1962 work. The states selected were Alabama (15 counties), Kentucky (12 counties), North Carolina (12 counties), Tennessee (14 counties), Virginia (12 counties), and West Virginia (15 counties).\n[[File:Map of counties included in the 1982 report of the Appalachian Land Ownership Task Force.png|thumb|Map showing the 80 counties included in the 1982 report by the Appalachian Land Ownership Task Force]]\n\nIn its summary the report stated that \"over 55,000 parcels of property in 80 counties were studied, representing some 20,000,000 acres of land and mineral rights...\" It found that \"41% of the 20 million acres of land and minerals...are held by only 50 private owners and 10 government agencies. The federal government is the single largest owner in Appalachia, holding over 2,000,000 acres.\" The study found that the extractive industries, i.e., timber, coal, etc., were \"greatly underassessed for property tax purposes. Over 75% of the mineral owners in this survey pay under 25 cents per acre in property taxes.\" In the major coal counties surveyed the average tax per ton of known coal reserves is only $.0002 (1/50th of a cent).\nThe government-held lands are tax exempt, but the government makes a [[payment in lieu of taxes]], which is usually less than the normal tax rates.\n\n\"Taken together, the failure to tax minerals adequately, the underassessment of surface lands, and the revenue loss from concentrated federal holdings has a marked impact on local governments in Appalachia. The effect, essentially, is to produce a situation in which a) the small owners carry a disproportionate share of the tax burden; b) counties depend upon federal and state funds to provide revenues, while the large, corporate and absentee owners of the regions's resources go relatively tax-free; and c) citizens face a poverty of needed services despite the presence in their counties of taxable property wealth, especially in the form of coal and other natural resources.\"<ref>[http://www.crmw.net/files/1981_Land_Ownership_Study.pdf ''Land Ownership Patterns and Their Impacts on Appalachian Communities.

The ARC is a planning, research, advocacy and funding organization; it does not have any governing powers.\n\nThe ARC's geographic range of coverage was defined broadly so as to cover as many economically underdeveloped areas as possible; it extends well beyond the area usually thought of as \"Appalachia\". For instance, parts of Alabama and Mississippi were included in the commission because of problems with unemployment and poverty similar to those in Appalachia proper, and the ARC region extends into the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] states, which are not traditionally considered part of Appalachia culturally (though a \"northern Appalachia\" identity has emerged in recent times in parts of both NY and PA, particularly in rural areas). More recently, the [[Youngstown, Ohio]], region was declared part of Appalachia by the ARC due to the [[economy of Youngstown, Ohio|collapse of the steel industry in the region]] in the early 1980s and the continuing unemployment problems in the region since, though aside from [[Columbiana County, Ohio]], the Youngstown [[Designated market area#Television|DMA]] isn't traditionally or culturally considered part of the region.<ref>[http://metromonthly.wordpress.com/2007/09/01/youngstown-appalachia/ Youngstown, Appalachia? \u2013 Metro Monthly].

With the exception of the October 1, 1940, opening of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]], the region's mountainous terrain continuously thwarted major federal intervention attempts at major road construction until the 1970s. This left large parts of the region virtually isolated and slowing economic growth. Before the Civil War, major cities in the region were connected via wagon roads to lowland areas, and [[flatboat]]s provided an important means for transporting goods out of the region. By 1900, railroads connected most of the region with the rest of the nation, although the poor roads made travel beyond railroad hubs difficult. When the Appalachian Regional Commission was created in 1965, road construction was considered its most important initiative, and in subsequent decades the commission spent more on road construction than all other projects combined.<ref name=transeoa>Burton, Mark, and Richard Hatcher, Introduction to Transportation section, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 685\u201390.</ref>\n\nThe effort to connect Appalachia with the outside world has required numerous civil engineering feats. Millions of tons of rock were removed to build road segments such as [[Interstate 40]] through the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee \u2013 North Carolina)|Pigeon River Gorge]] at the Tennessee-North Carolina state line and [[U.S. Route 23]] in [[Letcher County, Kentucky]]. Large tunnels were built through mountain slopes at [[Cumberland Gap Tunnel|Cumberland Gap]] to speed up travel along [[U.S. Route 25E]].

Beginning in the 1930s, the federal government sought to alleviate poverty in the Appalachian region with a series of [[New Deal]] initiatives, such as the construction of [[dam]]s to provide cheap electricity and the implementation of better farming practices.

The most commonly used modern definition of Appalachia is the one initially defined by the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]] in 1965 and expanded over subsequent decades.<ref name=abramson1 /> The region defined by the Commission currently includes 420 counties and eight [[Independent city (Virginia)|independent cities]] in 13 states, including all of [[West Virginia]], 14 counties in [[New York (state)|New York]], 52 in [[Pennsylvania]], 32 in [[Ohio]], 3 in [[Maryland]], 54 in [[Kentucky]], 25 counties and 8 [[Administrative divisions of Virginia#Independent cities|cities]] in [[Virginia]],<ref>In Virginia, all municipalities incorporated as \"cities\" are legally separate from counties.</ref> 29 in [[North Carolina]], 52 in [[Tennessee]], 6 in [[South Carolina]], 37 in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 37 in [[Alabama]], and 24 in [[Mississippi]].<ref name=arc1 /> When the Commission was established, counties were added based on economic need, however, rather than any cultural parameters.<ref name=abramson1 />\n\nThe first major attempt to map Appalachia as a distinctive cultural region came in the 1890s with the efforts of [[Berea College]] president William Goodell Frost, whose \"Appalachian America\" included 194 counties in 8 states.<ref name=williams>John Alexander Williams, ''Appalachia: A History'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2002)</ref>{{rp|11\u201314}} In 1921, John C. Campbell published ''The Southern Highlander and His Homeland'' in which he modified Frost's map to include 254 counties in 9 states. A landmark survey of the region in the following decade by the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] defined the region as consisting of 206 counties in 6 states. In 1984, Karl Raitz and Richard Ulack expanded the ARC's definition to include 445 counties in 13 states, although they removed all counties in Mississippi and added two in [[New Jersey]]. Historian John Alexander Williams, in his 2002 book ''Appalachia: A History'', distinguished between a \"core\" Appalachian region consisting of 164 counties in West Virginia, Kentucky, Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia, and a greater region defined by the ARC.<ref name=abramson1 />\n\nIn the ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (2006), [[Appalachian State University]] historian [[Howard Dorgan]] suggested the term \"Old Appalachia\" for the region's cultural boundaries, noting an academic tendency to ignore the southwestern and northeastern extremes of the ARC's pragmatic definition.<ref>Abramson, Rudy, and Jean Haskell, eds., ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1287\u201388.</ref> [[Sean Trende]], senior elections analyst at ''[[RealClearPolitics]]'', defines \"Greater Appalachia\" in his 2012 book ''The Lost Majority'' as including both the [[Appalachian Mountains]] region ([[Western Virginia|western Virginia]] and [[Western North Carolina|North Carolina]], the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region in western South Carolina, West Virginia, [[Appalachian Ohio|southern Ohio]], the [[Cumberland Plateau]] in [[Eastern Kentucky Coalfield|eastern Kentucky]], [[East Tennessee]], [[North Georgia|northern Georgia]], [[North Alabama|Alabama]], and [[North Mississippi|Mississippi]]) and the [[Upland South]] ([[Southern Indiana|southern Indiana]] and [[Southern Illinois|Illinois]], the [[Bluegrass region|Bluegrass]], [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain|Mississippi Plateau]], [[Western Coal Field]], and [[Jackson Purchase]] regions in central and western Kentucky, [[Middle Tennessee|Middle]] and [[West Tennessee]], [[Missouri]], the [[Ozarks]] in Arkansas, [[Little Dixie (Oklahoma)|Little Dixie]] and [[Southwestern Oklahoma]], [[North Texas|North]] and [[East Texas]], and the [[Texas Hill Country]]) following [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Ulster Protestant]] migrations to the [[Southern United States|Southern]] and [[Midwestern United States]] in the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trende|first=Sean|author-link=Sean Trende|title=The Lost Majority: Why the Future of Government Is Up for Grabs\u2013and Who Will Take It|year=2012|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|isbn=978-0230116467|pages=xxii\u2013xxviii|url=https://archive.org/details/lostmajoritywhyf0000tren}}</ref>\n\n===Toponymy and pronunciation===\n[[File:Gutierrez-1562-detail-app1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Detail of Gutierrez' 1562 map showing the first known cartographic appearance of a variant of the name \"Appalachia\"]]\n\nWhile exploring inland along the northern coast of [[Florida]] in 1528, the members of the [[Narv\u00e1ez expedition]], including [[\u00c1lvar N\u00fa\u00f1ez Cabeza de Vaca]], found a [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] village near present-day [[Tallahassee, Florida]], whose name they transcribed as ''Apalchen'' or ''Apalachen'' ({{IPA-all|apa\u02c8lat\u0283en}}).

The earliest discovered site is the [[Meadowcroft Rockshelter]] in [[Washington County, Pennsylvania]], which some scientists claim is pre-[[Clovis culture]]. Several other [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic period]] (8000\u20131000 BC) archaeological sites have been identified in the region, such as the [[St. Albans, West Virginia|St. Albans]] site in West Virginia and the [[Icehouse Bottom]] site in Tennessee. In the 16th century, the de Soto and [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] expeditions explored the mountains of South Carolina, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Georgia, and encountered complex agrarian societies consisting of [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean-speaking]] inhabitants. De Soto indicated that much of the region west of the mountains was part of the domain of [[Coosa chiefdom|Coosa]], a [[paramount chief]]dom centered around a village complex in northern Georgia.<ref>Hudson, Charles. ''The Juan Pardo Expeditions: Explorations of the Carolinas and Tennessee, 1566\u20131568'' (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2005), p. 17.</ref> By the time English explorers arrived in Appalachia in the late 17th century, the central part of the region was controlled by [[Algonquian peoples|Algonquian]] tribes (namely the [[Shawnee]]) and the southern part of the region was controlled by the [[Cherokee]]. The [[New France|French]] based in modern-day [[Quebec]] also made inroads into the northern areas of the region in modern-day New York state and Pennsylvania. By the mid 18th century the French had outposts such as [[Fort Duquesne]] and [[Fort Le Boeuf]] controlling the access points of the [[Allegheny River]] valley and upper [[Ohio valley]] after exploration by [[Celeron de Bienville]].\n\n[[File:George Caleb Bingham - Daniel Boone escorting settlers through the Cumberland Gap.jpg|thumb|''Daniel Boone Escorting Settlers through the [[Cumberland Gap]]'' ([[George Caleb Bingham]], oil on canvas, 1851\u201352)]]\n\nEuropean migration into Appalachia began in the 18th century. As lands in eastern Pennsylvania, the [[Tidewater region of Virginia]] and [[the Carolinas]] filled up, immigrants began pushing further and further westward into the Appalachian Mountains. A relatively large proportion of the early [[backcountry]] immigrants were [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]]\u2014later known as \"[[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]]\"\u2014 who were seeking cheaper land and freedom from [[Quakers|Quaker]] leaders, many of whom considered the Scotch-Irish \"savages\". Others included [[Germans]] from the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]] region and English settlers from the [[Anglo-Scottish border]] country. Between 1730 and 1763, immigrants trickled into [[western Pennsylvania]], the [[Shenandoah Valley]] area of Virginia, and [[western Maryland]]. [[Thomas Walker (explorer)|Thomas Walker's]] discovery of [[Cumberland Gap]] in 1750 and the end of the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763 lured settlers deeper into the mountains, namely to upper [[east Tennessee]], northwestern North Carolina, [[upstate South Carolina]], and central Kentucky. Between 1790 and 1840, a series of treaties with the Cherokee and other Native American tribes opened up lands in [[north Georgia (U.S. state)|north Georgia]], [[north Alabama]], the [[Tennessee Valley]], the [[Cumberland Plateau]] regions, and the [[Great Smoky Mountains]] along what is now the Tennessee-North Carolina border.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|30\u201344}} The last of these treaties culminated in the removal of the bulk of the Cherokee population (as well as [[Choctaw]], [[Chickasaw]] and others) from the region via the [[Trail of Tears]] from 1831 until 1838.\n\n===The Appalachian frontier===\n[[File:Earnest-fort-house-tn1.jpg|thumb|225px|right|The Earnest Fort-house in [[Greene County, Tennessee]]. Built around 1782 during the [[Cherokee\u2013American wars]], it is located just south of [[Chuckey, Tennessee|Chuckey]] on the banks of the [[Nolichucky River]].]]\n\nAppalachian frontiersmen have long been romanticized for their ruggedness and self-sufficiency. A typical depiction of an Appalachian pioneer involves a hunter wearing a [[coonskin cap]] and [[buckskins|buckskin clothing]], and sporting a long rifle and shoulder-strapped [[powder horn]]. Perhaps no single figure symbolizes the Appalachian pioneer more than [[Daniel Boone]] (1734\u20131820), a [[long hunter]] and [[surveying|surveyor]] instrumental in the early settlement of Kentucky and Tennessee. Like Boone, Appalachian pioneers moved into areas largely separated from \"civilization\" by high mountain ridges, and had to fend for themselves against the elements. As many of these early settlers were living on Native American lands, attacks from Native American tribes were a continuous threat until the 19th century.<ref name=Caudill>Caudill, Harry. ''Night Comes to the Cumberlands''</ref>{{rp|7\u201313, 19}}\n\nAs early as the 18th century, Appalachia (then known simply as the \"backcountry\") began to distinguish itself from its wealthier lowland and coastal neighbors to the east. Frontiersmen often bickered with lowland and [[tidewater region|tidewater]] \"elites\" over taxes, sometimes to the point of armed revolts such as the [[War of the Regulation|Regulator Movement]] (1767\u20131771) in North Carolina.<ref name=drake>Drake, Richard. ''A History of Appalachia'' (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 2001)</ref>{{rp|59\u201369}} In 1778, at the height of the [[American Revolutionary War|American Revolution]], backwoodsmen from Pennsylvania, Virginia, and what is now Kentucky took part in [[George Rogers Clark]]'s [[Illinois campaign]]. Two years later, a group of Appalachian frontiersmen known as the [[Overmountain Men]] routed British forces at the [[Battle of Kings Mountain]] after rejecting a call by the British to disarm.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|64\u201368}} After the war, residents throughout the Appalachian backcountry\u2014especially the [[Monongahela River|Monongahela]] region in western Pennsylvania, and [[antebellum South|antebellum]] northwestern Virginia (now the north-central part of West Virginia) \u2014 refused to pay a tax placed on whiskey by the new American government, leading to what became known as the [[Whiskey Rebellion]].<ref name=williams/>{{rp|118\u201319}} The resulting tighter Federal controls in the Monongahela valley resulted in many whiskey/bourbon makers migrating via the Ohio River to Kentucky and Tennessee where the industry could flourish.\n\n===Early 19th century===\nIn the early 19th century, the rift between the [[yeoman]] farmers of Appalachia and their wealthier lowland counterparts continued to grow, especially as the latter dominated most state legislatures. People in Appalachia began to feel slighted over what they considered unfair taxation methods and lack of state funding for improvements (especially for roads). In the northern half of the region, the lowland \"elites\" consisted largely of industrial and business interests, whereas in the parts of the region south of the [[Mason\u2013Dixon line]], the lowland elites consisted of large-scale land-owning [[plantations in the American South|planters]].<ref name=drake/>{{rp|59\u201369}} The [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]], formed in the 1830s, drew widespread support from disaffected Appalachians.\n\nTensions between the mountain counties and state governments sometimes reached the point of mountain counties threatening to break off and form separate states. In 1832, bickering between western Virginia and eastern Virginia over the state's constitution led to calls on both sides for the state's separation into two states.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|141}} In 1841, Tennessee state senator (and later U.S. president) [[Andrew Johnson]] introduced legislation in the [[Tennessee Senate]] calling for the creation of a separate state in East Tennessee. The proposed state would have been known as \"Frankland\" and would have invited like-minded mountain counties in Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama to join it.<ref>Lacy, Eric.

Sentiments in northern Appalachia had shifted to the pro-[[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. In southern Appalachia, abolitionists still constituted a radical minority, although several smaller opposition parties (most of which were both pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] and pro-slavery) were formed to oppose the planter-dominated [[Southern Democrats]]. As states in the southern United States moved toward [[secession]], a majority of Southern Appalachians still supported the Union.<ref name=mckinney1>Gordon McKinney, \"The Civil War\". ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1579\u201381.</ref> In 1861, a [[Minnesota]] newspaper identified 161 counties in Southern Appalachia\u2014which the paper called \"Alleghenia\"\u2014where Union support remained strong, and which might provide crucial support for the defeat of the Confederacy.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|11\u201314}} However, many of these Unionists\u2014especially in the mountain areas of North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama\u2014were \"conditional\" Unionists in that they opposed secession, but also opposed violence to prevent secession, and thus when their respective state legislatures voted to secede, their support shifted to the Confederacy.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|160\u201365}} Kentucky sought to remain neutral at the outset of the conflict, opting not to supply troops to either side. After Virginia voted to secede, several mountain counties in northwestern Virginia rejected the ordinance and with the help of the [[Union Army]] established a separate state, admitted to the Union as West Virginia in 1863. However, half the counties included in the new state, comprising two-thirds of its territory, were secessionist and pro-Confederate.<ref>Curry, Richard O. ''A House Divided, Statehood Politics & the Copperhead Movement in West Virginia'', Univ. of Pittsburgh Press, 1964, pgs. 141\u2013147.

While there were two major theaters of operation in the region\u2014namely the [[Shenandoah Valley]] of Virginia (and present-day West Virginia) and the [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]] area along the Tennessee-Georgia border\u2014much of the violence was caused by [[bushwhacker]]s and [[guerrilla war]]. The northernmost battles of the entire war were fought in Appalachia with the [[Battle of Buffington Island]] and the [[Battle of Salineville]] resulting from [[Morgan's Raid]]. Large numbers of livestock were killed (grazing was an important part of Appalachia's economy), and numerous farms were destroyed, pillaged, or neglected.<ref name=mckinney1 /> The actions of both Union and Confederate armies left many inhabitants in the region resentful of government authority and suspicious of outsiders for decades after the war.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|109\u201323}} <ref name=Caudill/>{{rp|39\u201345}}\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th centuries===\n\n====Economic boom====\n[[File:West-virginia-mine-entrance1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Entrance to mine shaft in West Virginia, photographed by [[Lewis Hine]] in 1908]]\n\nAfter the war, northern parts of Appalachia experienced an economic boom, while economies in the southern parts of the region stagnated, especially as Southern Democrats regained control of their respective state legislatures at the end of [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].<ref name=mckinney1 /> [[Pittsburgh]] as well as [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] grew into major industrial centers, especially regarding iron and steel production. By 1900, the Chattanooga area and north Georgia and northern Alabama had experienced similar changes due to manufacturing booms in [[Atlanta]] and [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] at the edge of the Appalachian region. Railroad construction between the 1880s and early 20th century gave the greater nation access to the vast coalfields in central Appalachia, making the [[Appalachian Land Ownership Survey|economy]] in that part of the region practically synonymous with coal mining. As the nationwide demand for lumber skyrocketed, lumber firms turned to the virgin forests of southern Appalachia, using sawmill and logging railroad innovations to reach remote timber stands. The [[Tri-Cities, Tennessee|Tri-Cities]] area of Tennessee and Virginia and the [[Kanawha Valley]] of West Virginia became major [[petrochemical]] production centers.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|131\u2013141}}\n\n====Stereotypes====\n{{main|Appalachian stereotypes}}\nThe late 19th and early 20th centuries also saw the development of various regional stereotypes. Attempts by President [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] to enforce the whiskey tax in the late 1870s led to an explosion in violence between Appalachian \"[[moonshine]]rs\" and federal \"revenuers\" that lasted through the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] period in the 1920s.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|187\u2013193}} The breakdown of authority and law enforcement during the Civil War may have contributed to an increase in clan feuding, which by the 1880s was reported to be a problem across most of Kentucky's Cumberland region as well as [[Carter County, Tennessee|Carter County]] in Tennessee, [[Carroll County, Virginia|Carroll County]] in Virginia, and [[Mingo County, West Virginia|Mingo]] and [[Logan County, West Virginia|Logan]] counties in West Virginia.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|109\u201323}} <ref name=williams/>{{rp|187\u201393}} Regional writers from this period such as [[Mary Noailles Murfree]] and [[Horace Kephart]] liked to focus on such sensational aspects of mountain culture, leading readers outside the region to believe they were more widespread than in reality. In an 1899 article in ''[[The Atlantic]]'', [[Berea College]] president William G. Frost attempted to redefine the inhabitants of Appalachia as \"noble mountaineers\"\u2014relics of the nation's pioneer period whose isolation had left them unaffected by modern times.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|109\u201323}}\n\nToday, residents of Appalachia are viewed by many Americans as uneducated and unrefined, resulting in culture-based stereotyping and [[discrimination]] in many areas, including employment and housing. Such discrimination has prompted some to seek redress under prevailing federal and state [[civil rights]] laws.<ref>E.g. see Walker, Matthew H. \"Discrimination Based on National Origin and Ancestry: How the Goals of Equality Have Failed to Address the Pervasive Stereotyping of the Appalachian Tradition\", 38 ''U. Dayton L. Rev.'' 335 (2013).</ref>\n\n====Feuds====\nAppalachia, and especially Kentucky, became nationally known for its violent [[feud]]s, especially in the remote mountain districts. They pitted the men in extended clans against each other for decades, often using assassination and arson as weapons, along with [[ambush]]es, [[gunfight]]s, and pre-arranged [[shootout]]s. The infamous [[Hatfield\u2013McCoy feud|Hatfield-McCoy Feud]] of the 19th century was the best known of these family feuds. Some of the feuds were continuations of violent local Civil War episodes.<ref>Otterbein, Keith F. \"Five Feuds: An Analysis of Homicides in Eastern Kentucky in the Late Nineteenth Century\", ''American Anthropologist'', June 2000, Vol. 102 Issue 2, pp 231\u201343, provides a theoretical analysis.</ref> Journalists often wrote about the violence, using stereotypes that \"city folks\" had developed about Appalachia; they interpreted the feuds as the natural products of profound ignorance, poverty, and isolation, and perhaps even [[inbreeding]]. In reality, the leading participants were typically well-to-do local elites with networks of clients who were fighting for local political power.<ref>Billings, Dwight B., and [[Kathleen M. Blee]], \"'Where the Sun Set Crimson and the Moon Rose Red': Writing Appalachia and the Kentucky Mountain Feuds\", ''Southern Cultures'', Summer 1996, Vol. 2 Issue 3/4, pp 329\u2013352</ref>\n\n===Modern Appalachia===\nLogging firms' rapid devastation of the forests of the Appalachians sparked a movement among [[conservation movement|conservationists]] to preserve what remained and allow the land to \"heal\". In 1911, Congress passed the [[Weeks Act]], giving the federal government authority to create [[United States National Forest|national forests]] east of the Mississippi River and control timber harvesting. Regional writers and business interests led a movement to create national parks in the eastern United States similar to [[Yosemite National Park|Yosemite]] and [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] in the west, culminating in the creation of the [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]] in Tennessee and North Carolina, [[Shenandoah National Park]] in Virginia, [[Cumberland Gap National Historical Park]] in Kentucky,  Virginia and Tennessee, and the [[Blue Ridge Parkway]] (connecting the two) in the 1930s.<ref name=drake/>{{rp|200\u2013210}} During the same period, New England forester [[Benton MacKaye]] led the movement to build the {{convert|2175|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Appalachian Trail]], stretching from Georgia to [[Maine]].\n\nBy the 1950s, poor farming techniques and the loss of jobs to [[mechanization]] in the mining industry had left much of central and southern Appalachia poverty-stricken. The lack of jobs also led to widespread difficulties with [[emigration|outmigration]]. Beginning in the 1930s, federal agencies such as the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] began investing in the Appalachian region.<ref name=williams/>{{rp|310\u201312}} [[Sociologist]]s such as James Brown and Cratis Williams and authors such as [[Harry Caudill]] and [[Michael Harrington]] brought attention to the region's plight in the 1960s, prompting Congress to create the [[Appalachian Regional Commission]] in 1965.

After the Civil War, mandatory education laws and state assistance helped larger communities begin to establish graded schools and high schools. During the same period, many of the region's institutions of higher education were established or greatly expanded.<ref name=deyoung>DeYoung, Alan, Introduction to Education section, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1517\u201321.</ref> In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, service organizations such as [[Pi Beta Phi]] and various religious organizations established [[settlement school]]s and mission schools in the region's more rural areas.<ref>Alvic, Philis, \"Settlement, Mission, and Sponsored Schools\", ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), p. 1551.</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, national trends began to have more of an effect on education in Appalachia, sometimes clashing with the region's traditional values. The [[Scopes Trial]]\u2014the nation's most publicized debate over the teaching of the theory of [[evolution]]\u2014took place in [[Dayton, Tennessee]], in southern Appalachia in 1925. In spite of consolidation and centralization, schools in Appalachia struggled to keep up with federal and state demands into the 21st century. Since 2001, a number of the region's public schools were threatened with loss of funding due to difficulties fulfilling the demands of [[No Child Left Behind]].<ref name=deyoung />\n\n===Music===\n{{Main article|Appalachian music}}\nAppalachian music is one of the best-known manifestations of Appalachian culture. Traditional Appalachian music is derived primarily from the English and Scottish [[ballad]] tradition and Irish and Scottish [[fiddle]] music. African-American [[blues]] musicians played a significant role in developing the instrumental aspects of Appalachian music, most notably with the introduction of the five-stringed [[banjo]]\u2014one of the region's iconic symbols\u2014in the late 18th century. Another instrument known in Appalachian culture was the [[Appalachian dulcimer]] which, in a practical way, is a guitar-shaped instrument laid on its side with a flat bottom and the strings plucked in a manner to make alternating notes.\n\nIn the years following World War I, British folklorist [[Cecil Sharp]] brought attention to Southern Appalachia when he noted that its inhabitants still sang hundreds of English and Scottish ballads that had been passed down to them from their ancestors. Commercial recordings of Appalachian musicians in the 1920s would have a significant impact on the development of [[country music]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], and [[old-time music]]. Appalachian music saw a resurgence in popularity during the [[American folk music revival]] of the 1960s, when musicologists such as [[Mike Seeger]], [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]], and [[Ralph Rinzler]] traveled to remote parts of the region in search of musicians unaffected by modern music. Today, dozens of annual music festivals held throughout the region preserve the Appalachian music tradition.<ref>Olson, Ted, \"Music \u2013 Introduction\".

Travellers' accounts published in 19th-century magazines gave rise to Appalachian [[American literary regionalism|local color]], which reached its height with [[George Washington Harris]]'s Sut Lovingood character of the 1860s and native novelists such as [[Mary Noailles Murfree]]. Works such as [[Rebecca Harding Davis]]'s ''Life in the Iron Mills'' (1861), [[Emma Bell Miles]]' ''The Spirit of the Mountains'' (1905), Catherine Marshall's ''[[Christy (novel)|Christy]]'' (1912), [[Horace Kephart]]'s ''[[Our Southern Highlanders]]'' (1913) marked a shift in the region's literature from local color to realism. The transition from an agrarian society to an industrial society and its effects on Appalachia are captured in works such as [[Olive Tilford Dargan]]'s ''Call Home to the Heart'' (1932), [[Agnes Sligh Turnbull]]'s ''[[The Rolling Years]]'' (1936), [[James Still]]'s ''The River of Earth'' (1940), [[Harriette Simpson Arnow]]'s ''The Dollmaker'' (1954), and [[Harry Caudill]]'s ''[[Night Comes to the Cumberlands]]'' (1962). In the 1970s and 1980s, the rise of authors like [[Breece D'J Pancake]], [[Dorothy Allison]], and [[Lisa Alther]] brought greater literary diversity to the region.<ref name=toney>Edwards, Grace Toney, \"Literature \u2013 Introduction\", ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 1035\u201339.</ref>\n\nAlong with the above-mentioned, some of Appalachia's best known writers include [[James Agee]] (''[[A Death in the Family]]''), [[Anne W. Armstrong]] (''This Day and Time''), [[Wendell Berry]] (''Hannah Coulter'', ''The Unforeseen Wilderness: An Essay on Kentucky's Red River Gorge'', ''Selected Poems of Wendell Berry''), [[Jesse Stuart]] (''Taps for Private Tussie'', ''The Thread That Runs So True''), [[Denise Giardina]] (''The Unquiet Earth'', ''Storming Heaven''), [[Lee Smith (fiction author)|Lee Smith]] (''Fair and Tender Ladies'', ''On Agate Hill''), [[Silas House]] (''Clay's Quilt'', ''A Parchment of Leaves''), [[Wilma Dykeman]] (''The Far Family'', ''The Tall Woman''), [[Keith Maillard]] (''Alex Driving South'', ''Light in the Company of Women'', ''Hazard Zones'', ''Gloria'', ''Running'', ''Morgantown'', ''Lyndon Johnson and the Majorettes'', ''Looking Good'')  [[Maurice Manning (poet)|Maurice Manning]] (''Bucolics'', ''A Companion for Owls''), Anne Shelby (''Appalachian Studies'', ''We Keep a Store''), [[George Ella Lyon]] (''Borrowed Children'', ''Don't You Remember?''), [[Pamela Duncan (novelist)|Pamela Duncan]] (''Moon Women'', ''The Big Beautiful''), [[David Joy (author)|David Joy]] (\"Where All Light Tends to Go\", \"The Weight of This World\"), [[Chris Offutt]] (''No Heroes'', ''The Good Brother''), [[Charles Frazier]] (''[[Cold Mountain (novel)|Cold Mountain]]'', ''Thirteen Moons''), [[Sharyn McCrumb]] (''The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter''), [[Robert Morgan (poet)|Robert Morgan]] (''Gap Creek''), [[Jim Wayne Miller]] (''The Brier Poems''), [[Gurney Norman]] (''Divine Right's Trip'', ''Kinfolks''), [[Ron Rash]] (''Serena''), [[Elizabeth Madox Roberts]] (\"The Great Meadow, \"The Time of Man\"), [[Thomas Wolfe]] (''Look Homeward Angel'', ''You Can't Go Home Again''), [[Rachel Carson]] (''[[The Sea Around Us]]'', ''[[Silent Spring]]''; [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]]), and [[Jeannette Walls]] (''[[The Glass Castle]]'').\n\nAppalachian literature crosses with the larger genre of [[Southern literature]]. Internationally renowned writers such as [[William Faulkner]] and [[Cormac McCarthy]] have made notable contributions to the American canon with tales set within Appalachia. McCarthy's ''[[Suttree]]'' (1979) is an intense vision of the squalidness and brutality of life along the [[Tennessee River]], in the heart of Appalachia. Other McCarthy novels set in Appalachia include ''[[The Orchard Keeper]]'' (1968) and ''[[Child of God]]'' (1973). Appalachia also serves as the origin point for the kid, the protagonist of McCarthy's Western masterpiece ''[[Blood Meridian]]''. Faulkner's hometown of [[Oxford, Mississippi]], is on the borderlands of what is considered Appalachia, but his fictional [[Yoknapatawpha]] should be considered part of the region.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Almost all of the fiction which earned him the Nobel Prize is set there, including ''[[Light in August]]'' and ''[[Absalom, Absalom]]''.\n\n===Folklore===\n[[File:John Henry-27527.jpg|thumb|225px|right|Statue of legendary railroad worker [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] in [[Talcott, West Virginia]]]]\n\nAppalachian folklore has a strong mixture of European, Native American (especially [[Cherokee]]), and Biblical influences. The Cherokee taught the region's early European pioneers how to plant and cultivate crops such as [[maize|corn]] and [[squash (plant)|squash]] and how to find edible plants such as [[Allium tricoccum|ramps]].<ref name=handbook /> The Cherokee also passed along their knowledge of the medicinal properties of hundreds of native herbs and roots, and how to prepare tonics from such plants.<ref name=handbook /> Before the introduction of modern agricultural techniques in the region in the 1930s and 1940s, many Appalachian farmers followed the Biblical tradition of planting by \"the signs\", such as the [[lunar phase|phases of the moon]], or when certain weather conditions occurred.<ref name=handbook />\n\nCherokee folklore continues to influence storytelling in the Appalachians, including depictions and characteristics of regional animals. As told by [[Eastern Band Cherokee]] and [[western North Carolina]] storyteller Jerry Wolfe, these creatures include the [[chipmunk]], also known as \"seven stripes\" from an angry [[bear]] scratching him down the back\u2014four claw marks and the spaces in between making seven\u2014and the [[Agkistrodon contortrix|copperhead]] who sneaks and thieves his way into becoming venomous.<ref>Kelley, Saundra Gerrell (2011). ''Southern Appalachian Storytellers: Interviews with Sixteen Keepers of the Oral Tradition''. Jefferson: McFarland Publishing. p. 205\u201307.</ref>\n\nAppalachian folk tales are rooted in English, Scottish, and Irish fairy tales, as well as regional heroic figures and events. [[Jack tales]], which tend to revolve around the exploits of a simple-but-dedicated figure named \"[[Jack (hero)|Jack]]\", are popular at story-telling festivals. Other stories involve wild animals, such as hunting tales. In the industrial areas of western Pennsylvania and northern West Virginia the composite [[Joe Magarac]] steelworker story has been handed down. Regional folk heroes such as the railroad worker [[John Henry (folklore)|John Henry]] and frontiersmen [[Davy Crockett]], [[Mike Fink]] and [[Johnny Appleseed]] are examples of real-life figures that evolved into popular folk tale subjects. Murder stories, such as [[Omie Wise]] and [[John Hardy (song)|John Hardy]], are popular subjects for Appalachian ballads. Ghost stories, or \"[[:wikt:haint|haint]] tales\" in regional English,<ref>''Dictionary of American Regional English'', Belknap Press, 1985</ref> are a common feature of southern oral and literary tradition.<ref>Flora, Joseph M., Lucinda Hardwick MacKethan, Todd W. Taylor, ''The Companion to Southern Literature'', [[Louisiana State University Press]], 2001, p. 304.</ref> Ghost stories native to the region include the story of the [[Greenbrier Ghost]], which is rooted in a [[Greenbrier County, West Virginia]], murder.<ref name=handbook>Deborah Thompson and Irene Moser, \"Appalachian Folklife\".

In the decades following the Great Depression and World War II, many Appalachian residents moved to industrial cities in the north and west in a migration that became known as the \"[[Hillbilly Highway]]\". Mechanization of coal mining during the 1950s and 1960s was the major source of unemployment in central Appalachia. Many migration streams covered relatively short distances, with West Virginians moving to [[Cleveland]] and other cities in eastern and central [[Ohio]], and eastern Kentuckians moving to [[Cincinnati]] and southwest Ohio in search of jobs. More distant cities like [[Detroit]] and [[Chicago]] attracted migrants from many states. Enclaves of Appalachian culture can still be found in some of these communities.<ref>''Appalachian Odyssey'', ed. Phillip J. Obermiller et al. (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2000).</ref>\n\n===Communications===\nIn the 1940s through the 1960s, [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], became a cultural center of the region because it had a [[clear-channel station|clear-channel]] [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] radio station, [[WWVA (AM)|WWVA]], which could be heard throughout the entirety of the eastern United States at night. Although Pittsburgh's [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]] was a 50 kilowatt clear channel station that dated back to the early 1920s (as well as spanning all the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] in signal strength), WWVA prided itself on rural and farm programming that appealed to a wider audience in the rural region.  Cincinnati's [[WLW]] also was relied on by many in the central and northern areas of Appalachia.\n\nIn the southern part of the region, [[WSB-AM]] Atlanta and [[WSM-AM]] Nashville, flagship of the ''[[Grand Ole Opry]]'', were major stations for the region's population during the 20th century, and remain strong in the sub-region.\n\n===Appalachian studies===\n{{Main article|Appalachian studies}}\nAppalachia as an academic interest was the product of a critical scholarship that emerged across the disciplines in the 1960s and 1970s. With a renewed interest in issues of power, scholars could not dismiss the social inequity, class conflict, and environmental destruction encountered by [[United States|America's]] so-called \"[[Hillbilly|hillbillies]]\". Appalachia's emergence in academia is a result of the intersection between social conditions and critical academic interests, and has resulted in the development of many [[Appalachian studies]] programs in colleges and universities across the region, as well as in the [[Appalachian Studies Association]].\n\n==Economy==\nThe economy of Appalachia traditionally rested on agriculture, mining, timber, and in the cities, manufacturing. Since the late 20th century, [[tourism]] and second-home developments have assumed an increasingly major role.\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[File:Maggie-tower-view-nc1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A highland pasture near [[Maggie Valley, North Carolina]]]]\n\nWhile the climate of the Appalachian region is suitable for agriculture, the region's hilly terrain greatly limits the size of the average farm, a problem exacerbated by population growth in the latter half of the 19th century. [[Subsistence agriculture|Subsistence farming]] was the backbone of the Appalachian economy throughout much of the 19th century, and while economies in places such as western Pennsylvania, the [[Great Appalachian Valley|Great Valley]] of Virginia, and the upper Tennessee Valley in east Tennessee, transitioned to a large-scale farming or manufacturing base around the time of the Civil War, subsistence farming remained an important part of the region's economy until the 1950s. In the early 20th century, Appalachian farmers were struggling to mechanize, and abusive farming practices had over the years left much of the already-limited farmland badly eroded. Various federal entities intervened in the 1930s to restore damaged areas and introduce less-harmful farming techniques. In recent decades, the concept of [[sustainable agriculture]] has been applied to the region's small farms, with some success. Nevertheless, the number of farms in the Appalachian region continues to dwindle, plunging from 354,748 farms on {{convert|47|e6acre|km2}} in 1969 to 230,050 farms on {{convert|35|e6acre|km2}} in 1997.<ref name=agintro>Best, Michael, and Curtis Wood, Introduction to the Agriculture section in the ''[[Encyclopedia of Appalachia]]'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 395\u2013402.</ref>\n\nEarly Appalachian farmers grew both crops introduced from their native Europe as well as crops native to North America (such as [[maize|corn]] and [[squash (plant)|squash]]). [[Tobacco]] has long been an important [[cash crop]] in Southern Appalachia, especially since the land is ill-suited for cash crops such as [[cotton]]. Apples have been grown in the region since the late 18th century, their cultivation being aided by the presence of thermal belts in the region's mountain valleys.  Hogs, which could [[free range]] in the region's abundant forests, often on [[chestnut]]s, were the most popular livestock among early Appalachian farmers. The [[American chestnut]] was also an important human food source until the [[chestnut blight]] struck in the 20th century. The early settlers also brought cattle and sheep to the region, which they would typically graze in highland meadows known as [[Appalachian balds|balds]] during the growing season when bottomlands were needed for crops. Cattle, mainly the [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]], [[Angus cattle|Angus]], and [[Charolais cattle|Charolais]] breeds, are now the region's chief livestock.<ref name=agintro />\n\n===Logging===\n[[File:Erwin-millpond-sawmill-wv1.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Sawmill and millpond in Erwin, West Virginia, photographed by [[Marion Post Wolcott]] in 1938]]\n\nThe mountains and valleys of Appalachia once contained what seemed to be an inexhaustible supply of timber. The poor roads, lack of railroads, and general inaccessibility of the region, however, prevented large-scale logging in most of the region throughout much of the 19th century. While logging firms were established in the Carolinas and the [[Kentucky River]] valley before the Civil War, most major firms preferred to harvest the more accessible timber stands in the Midwestern and Northeastern parts of the country. By the 1880s, these stands had been exhausted, and a spike in the demand for lumber forced logging firms to seek out the virgin forests of Appalachia.<ref name=paulson>Paulson, Linda Daily, \"Lumber Industry\". ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 501\u201304.</ref> The first major logging ventures in Appalachia transported logs using mule teams or rivers, the latter method sometimes employing [[splash dam]]s.<ref>Weals, Vic. ''The Last Train to Elkmont'' (Knoxville, Tennessee: Olden Press, 1993), pp. 1\u20138.</ref> In the 1890s, innovations such as the [[Shay locomotive]], the steam-powered loader, and the steam-powered [[skidder]] allowed massive harvesting of the most remote forest sections.<ref name=paulson />\n\nLogging in Appalachia reached its peak in the early 20th century, when firms such as the Ritter Lumber Company cut the virgin forests on an alarming scale, leading to the creation of [[United States National Forest|national forests]] in 1911 and similar state entities to better manage the region's timber resources. Arguably the most successful logging firm in Appalachia was the Georgia Hardwood Lumber Company, established in 1927 and renamed [[Georgia-Pacific]] in 1948 when it expanded nationally. Although logging in Appalachia declined as the industry shifted focus to the [[Pacific Northwest]] in the 1950s, rising overseas demand in the 1980s brought a resurgence in Appalachian logging. In 1987, there were 4,810 lumber firms operating in the region. In the late 1990s, the Appalachian lumber industry was a multibillion-dollar industry, employing 50,000 people in Tennessee, 26,000 in Kentucky, and 12,000 in West Virginia alone.<ref name=paulson /> By 1999, 1.4 million acres were extinguished as a result of [[deforestation]] by natural resource industries.{{Clarify|date=June 2017|Not clear how land can be \"extinguished\"}} Pollution from mining processes and disruption of the land ensued numerous environmental issues.

At present, however, the mining industry employs just 2% of the Appalachian workforce. The region's vast coalfield covers {{convert|63000|sqmi|km2}} between northern Pennsylvania and central Alabama, mostly along the [[Cumberland Plateau]] and [[Allegheny Plateau]] regions. Most mining activity has been concentrated in eastern Kentucky, southwestern Virginia, West Virginia, and western Pennsylvania, with smaller operations in [[western Maryland]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Alabama]]. The [[Pittsburgh coal seam]], which has produced 13 billion tons of coal since the early 19th century, has been called the world's most valuable mineral deposit. There are over 60 major coal seams in West Virginia, and over 80 in eastern Kentucky. Most of the coal mined is [[bituminous coal|bituminous]], although significant [[anthracite]] deposits exist on the fringe of the region in central Pennsylvania.<ref name=abramsoncoal>Abramson, Rudy, \"Bituminous Coal Industry\".

Hundreds of thousands of workers poured into the region from across the United States and from overseas, essentially overhauling the cultural makeup of [[Eastern Kentucky Coalfield|eastern Kentucky]], West Virginia, and western Pennsylvania. Mining corporations gained considerable influence in state and municipal governments, especially as they often owned the entire towns in which the miners lived. The mining industry was vulnerable to economic downturns, however, and booms and busts were frequent, with major booms occurring during World War I and II, and the worst bust occurring during the Great Depression. The Appalachian mining industry also saw some of the nation's bloodiest labor strife between the 1890s and the 1930s. Mining-related injuries and deaths were not uncommon, and ailments such as [[coalworker's pneumoconiosis|black lung disease]] afflicted miners throughout the 20th century. After World War II, innovations in mechanization (such as [[longwall mining]]) and competition from oil and natural gas led to a decline in the region's mining operations.<ref name=abramsoncoal /> Environmental restrictions, such as those placed on high-[[sulfur]] coal in the 1980s, brought further mine closures. While with annual earnings of $55,000, Appalachian miners make more than most other local workers, Appalachian coal mining employed just under 50,000 in 2004.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.org/pdf/c_profile.pdf |format=PDF |title=Profile of the U.S. Coal Miner \u2013 2007 |publisher=[[National Mining Association]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nma.org/pdf/c_employment_state_region_method.pdf |format=PDF |title=U.S. Coal Mine Employment by State, Region and Method of Mining \u2013 2007 |publisher=National Mining Association}}</ref>\n\nCoal mining has made a comeback in some regions in the early 21st century because of the increased prominence of [[Consol Energy]], based in [[Pittsburgh]].

Factory construction increased greatly after the Civil War, and the region experienced a manufacturing boom between 1890 and 1930. This economic shift led to a mass migration from small farms and rural areas to large urban centers, causing the populations of cities such as Birmingham, [[Knoxville, Tennessee]], and [[Asheville, North Carolina]], to swell exponentially. Manufacturing in the region suffered a setback during the Great Depression, but recovered during World War II and peaked in the 1950s and 1960s. However, difficulties paying retiree benefits, environmental struggles, and the signing of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) in 1994 led to a decline in the region's manufacturing operations. Pittsburgh lost 44% of its factory jobs in the 1980s, and between 1970 and 2001, the number of [[apparel]] workers in the Appalachian region decreased from 250,000 to 83,000 and the number of textile workers decreased from 275,000 to 193,000.<ref name=hursteoa>Hurst, Jack, Introduction to Business, Technology, and Industry section, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee, 2006), pp. 441\u201347.</ref>\n\n[[U.S. Steel]], founded in Pittsburgh in 1901, was the world's first corporation with more than a billion dollars in initial capitalization.<ref name=hursteoa /> Another Pittsburgh company, [[Alcoa]], helped establish the nation's [[aluminum]] industry in the early 20th century, and has had a significant impact on the economies of western Pennsylvania and east Tennessee.<ref>Barnett, Janice Willis, \"Aluminum Industry\", ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 449\u201351.</ref> [[Union Carbide]] built the world's first [[petrochemical]] plant in [[Clendenin, West Virginia]], in 1920, and in subsequent years the [[Kanawha River|Kanawha Valley]] became known as the \"Chemical Capital of the World\".<ref>Egan, Martha Avaleen, \"Chemical Industry\", ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee, 2006), pp. 468\u201371.</ref> [[Eastman Chemical]], also established in 1920, is Tennessee's largest single employer.

The end of World War I (which opened up travel opportunities to Europe) and the arrival of the automobile (which changed the nation's vacation habits) led to the demise of all but a few of the region's spa resorts. The establishment of national parks in the 1930s brought an explosion of tourist traffic to the region, but created problems with [[urban sprawl]] in the various host communities.

Many Appalachian people<!--how many?--> feared that the birth of a new modernized Appalachia would lead to the death of their traditional values and heritage. Because of the isolation of the region, Appalachian people had been unable to catch up to the modernization that lowlanders have achieved. In the 1960s, many people in Appalachia had a [[standard of living]] comparable to [[Third World]] countries'.

New roads, schools, health care facilities, water and sewer systems, and other improvements have brought a better life to many Appalachian residents. In the 1960s, 219 [[county (United States)|counties]] in the 13-state Appalachian Region were considered economically distressed. Now that list has been cut by more than half, to 82 counties, but these are \"hard-core\" pockets of poverty, seemingly impervious to all efforts at improving their lot.<ref name=\"Arc\">Appalachian Regional Commission [http://www.arc.gov/index.do?nodeId=3301 Arc.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407182313/http://www.arc.gov/index.do?nodeId=3301 |date=April 7, 2009 }}</ref> [[Martin County, Kentucky]], the site of Johnson's 1964 speech, is one such county still ranked as \"distressed\" by the ARC. As of 2000, the [[per capita income]] in Martin County was $10,650, and 37% of its residents lived below the poverty line.\n\nLike Johnson, President [[Bill Clinton]] brought attention to the remaining areas of poverty in Appalachia. On July 5, 1999, he made a public statement concerning the situation in [[Tyner, Kentucky]]. Clinton told the enthusiastic crowd:\n\n{{quote|I'm here to make a simple point.

Any work that can be done by anybody in America can be done in Appalachia.<ref name=\"Arc\"/>}}\n\nThe region's poverty has been documented often since the early 1960s. [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]] documents rural lifestyle and culture in ''The High Lonesome Sound'', while [[Photojournalism|photojournalist]] [[Earl Dotter]] has been visiting and documenting poverty, healthcare and mining in Appalachia for nearly forty years.<ref name=\"Dotter\">Dotter, Earl. \"[http://southernspaces.org/2008/coalfield-generations-health-mining-and-environment Coalfield Generations: Health, Mining and the Environment]\" ''Southern Spaces'', July 16, 2008.</ref> Another photojournalist, [[Shelby Lee Adams]], has been photographing Appalachian families and lifestyle for decades.\n\nPoverty has caused health problems in the region.  The [[diseases of despair]], including the [[opioid epidemic in the United States]], and some [[diseases of poverty]] are prevalent in Appalachia.  \n\n===Tax revenue and absentee land ownership===\nIn 1982 a seven-volume study conducted by the Appalachian Land Ownership Task Force was issued by the Appalachian Regional Commission which investigated the issue of absentee land ownership. The study covered 80 counties in six states approximating the area designated \"Southern Appalachia\" as defined by Thomas R. Ford's 1962 work. The states selected were Alabama (15 counties), Kentucky (12 counties), North Carolina (12 counties), Tennessee (14 counties), Virginia (12 counties), and West Virginia (15 counties).\n[[File:Map of counties included in the 1982 report of the Appalachian Land Ownership Task Force.png|thumb|Map showing the 80 counties included in the 1982 report by the Appalachian Land Ownership Task Force]]\n\nIn its summary the report stated that \"over 55,000 parcels of property in 80 counties were studied, representing some 20,000,000 acres of land and mineral rights...\" It found that \"41% of the 20 million acres of land and minerals...are held by only 50 private owners and 10 government agencies. The federal government is the single largest owner in Appalachia, holding over 2,000,000 acres.\" The study found that the extractive industries, i.e., timber, coal, etc., were \"greatly underassessed for property tax purposes. Over 75% of the mineral owners in this survey pay under 25 cents per acre in property taxes.\" In the major coal counties surveyed the average tax per ton of known coal reserves is only $.0002 (1/50th of a cent).\nThe government-held lands are tax exempt, but the government makes a [[payment in lieu of taxes]], which is usually less than the normal tax rates.\n\n\"Taken together, the failure to tax minerals adequately, the underassessment of surface lands, and the revenue loss from concentrated federal holdings has a marked impact on local governments in Appalachia. The effect, essentially, is to produce a situation in which a) the small owners carry a disproportionate share of the tax burden; b) counties depend upon federal and state funds to provide revenues, while the large, corporate and absentee owners of the regions's resources go relatively tax-free; and c) citizens face a poverty of needed services despite the presence in their counties of taxable property wealth, especially in the form of coal and other natural resources.\"<ref>[http://www.crmw.net/files/1981_Land_Ownership_Study.pdf ''Land Ownership Patterns and Their Impacts on Appalachian Communities.

The ARC is a planning, research, advocacy and funding organization; it does not have any governing powers.\n\nThe ARC's geographic range of coverage was defined broadly so as to cover as many economically underdeveloped areas as possible; it extends well beyond the area usually thought of as \"Appalachia\". For instance, parts of Alabama and Mississippi were included in the commission because of problems with unemployment and poverty similar to those in Appalachia proper, and the ARC region extends into the [[Northeastern United States|Northeastern]] states, which are not traditionally considered part of Appalachia culturally (though a \"northern Appalachia\" identity has emerged in recent times in parts of both NY and PA, particularly in rural areas). More recently, the [[Youngstown, Ohio]], region was declared part of Appalachia by the ARC due to the [[economy of Youngstown, Ohio|collapse of the steel industry in the region]] in the early 1980s and the continuing unemployment problems in the region since, though aside from [[Columbiana County, Ohio]], the Youngstown [[Designated market area#Television|DMA]] isn't traditionally or culturally considered part of the region.<ref>[http://metromonthly.wordpress.com/2007/09/01/youngstown-appalachia/ Youngstown, Appalachia? \u2013 Metro Monthly].

With the exception of the October 1, 1940, opening of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]], the region's mountainous terrain continuously thwarted major federal intervention attempts at major road construction until the 1970s. This left large parts of the region virtually isolated and slowing economic growth. Before the Civil War, major cities in the region were connected via wagon roads to lowland areas, and [[flatboat]]s provided an important means for transporting goods out of the region. By 1900, railroads connected most of the region with the rest of the nation, although the poor roads made travel beyond railroad hubs difficult. When the Appalachian Regional Commission was created in 1965, road construction was considered its most important initiative, and in subsequent decades the commission spent more on road construction than all other projects combined.<ref name=transeoa>Burton, Mark, and Richard Hatcher, Introduction to Transportation section, ''Encyclopedia of Appalachia'' (Knoxville: University of Tennessee Press, 2006), pp. 685\u201390.</ref>\n\nThe effort to connect Appalachia with the outside world has required numerous civil engineering feats.
