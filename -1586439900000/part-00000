The game takes place on a post-apocalyptic version of Earth called \"Urth\". Players control one of seven large beasts that battle each other to determine the planet's fate. Matches feature many of the conventions of fighting games from the era including special moves and gory finishing maneuvers.\n\nVarious [[Porting|ports]] were released for [[home console]]s and [[personal computer]]s. Efforts to perfectly [[video game console emulator|emulate]] the arcade original have been unsuccessful due to the use of an unusual copy protection method.\n\nToys, comics, a novel and other merchandise tie-ins were produced. Though the game was a hit, it has been said that Atari Games derived more profit from its merchandising than from the game itself.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=NG Alphas: Atari Comes Alive |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=35 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=November 1997|page=78}}</ref>\n\n==Settings==\n\n'''''Story'''''\n\nA massive [[Extinction event|meteor strike]] has devastated Earth. Human civilization comes to an end in the ensuing cataclysms and humanity regresses into tribes of [[Stone Age]] dwellers. A primordial [[rainforest]] covers the land and the continental landmass has shifted into the shape of a fire-breathing dinosaur skull. The planet is now primitively referred to as \"Urth\" by the survivors of the cataclysms.\n\nSeven fearsome creatures emerge from their slumber deep within the Urth's crust, and become worshiped as gods by the humans, who form segregated clans beneath the ones they follow. The beasts themselves are divided between those who wish to keep peace on Urth, and those who attempt to plunge the world into further chaos for their own benefit. \n\n\n'''''Beasts'''''\n\n*''Blizzard'' \nThe cryokinetic, [[ape]]-like, Virtuous Beast who is the god of goodness.\n\n*''Armadon''  \nThe spiky [[ceratopsian]]/[[thyreophoran]]-like, Virtuous Beast who is the god of life.\n\n*''Talon''\nThe striped, [[Dromaeosauridae|raptor]]-like, Virtuous Beast who is the god of survival.\n\n*''Sauron''\nThe large, [[tyrannosaur]]-like, Virtuous Beast who is the god of hunger.\n\n*''Chaos'' \nThe vulgar, ape-like, Destructive Beast who is the god of decay.\n\n*''Vertigo''\nThe female, [[cobra]]/[[prosauropod]]-like, Destructive Beast who is the goddess of insanity.\n\n*''Diablo''\nThe hellish, tyrannosaur-like, Destructive Beast who is the god of evil. \n\nThese creatures have otherworldly or [[supernatural]] abilities. The Virtuous Beasts represented the side of the [[sacred]] while the Destructive Beasts were aligned with the [[occult]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Primal Rage'' is a traditional [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] [[fighting game]] in which two [[Player character|players]] select characters to battle each other in one-on-one combat, or a single player is faced with a campaign of fights against the [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) over increasing [[Difficulty level|difficulty]]. The final battle of the [[single-player]] game consists of fighting all the other AI monsters with an increased power bar, made available in a [[minigame]] prior to the fight. A total of seven characters are playable. Each character has their own specialized set of three attack moves and abilities. The object is to deplete the opposing character's [[Health (game terminology)|health]] meter before the player's own runs out. There are also seven different background [[Level (video games)|stages]] where fighting takes place, each one representing one of the character's innate domains: the Cliff (Blizzard), the Hollows (Armadon), the Strip (Talon), the Cove (Sauron), the Ruins (Chaos), the Tomb (Vertigo) and the Inferno (Diablo).\n\nDuring fights, human tribesmen wander nearby and worship their gods. This allows for the creatures to toss them around or devour some to regain health (eating opponents' worshipers adds a bonus to one's score, while eating one's own will penalize the player). Prior to the final battle, a minigame commences in which the player is given the chance to eat as many worshipers as possible to increase health for the endurance round. Two human-controlled characters can trigger [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] minigames of human volleyball and bowling.\n\nUnlike most fighting games, where the special moves are performed by moving the [[joystick]] followed by pressing one or more buttons, ''Primal Rage'' features a system where the player holds down certain buttons, then performs the joystick movements. Later revisions of the arcade game added the ability to perform special moves in the more traditional way, with motion followed by button presses, but kept the original method as well. After the opponent is defeated, a brief moment is allowed for the player to perform a [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|finishing move]] to end the match in a more dramatic fashion; these are performed in a similar manner to the special moves. Although all characters feature three finishing moves, some of them were more of easter eggs than fatalities, such as Vertigo's \"La Vache Qui Rit\" (French for \"the laughing cow\"), a fatality in which Vertigo transforms her opponent into a cow, which moos and runs away.\n\n==Development==\nAnimator Jason Leong recounted: {{quote|Every year [Time Warner Interactive] throws a brain-storming session where everybody brings up new game ideas. A few years ago I brought up the concept of a head-to-head dinosaur fighting game, which coincidentally someone else also brought up, but their idea was just two T. Rexes fighting. My original write-up included ideas that finally appeared in the game, such as different species of quickly moving dinosaurs and the concept of the dinosaurs being gods.<ref name=GPro84>{{cite magazine |title=The GameMakers: The Artists|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=84|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=September 1995|pages=22\u201324}}</ref>}}\n\nThe game's development began with a series of production sketches of the fighters drawn by Leong.<ref name=GPro84/><ref name=GPro74>{{cite magazine |title=The Making of Primal Rage |magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=74|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=November 1994|pages=42\u201343}}</ref> Using these drawings as a basis, model maker Dan Platt crafted [[model figure]]s of the fighters, from which flexible metal [[armature (sculpture)|armatures]] were then cast.<ref name=GPro74/> The models were [[airbrush]]ed according to Leong's drawings. The animations seen in the game were then filmed using these models, through the process of [[stop motion]] animation, with about 400 frames shot for each fighter.<ref name=GPro74/>\n\nThe Saturn version of ''Primal Rage'' was the last version to be released. Senior producer Ken Humphries explained, \"To be honest, the Saturn version got lost in the shuffle.

They added that \"There haven't been Game Gear graphics like these since [[Mortal Kombat II|MK II]]'s debut\" and expressed astonishment at the absence of slowdown in the Game Boy version.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Primal Rage|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=83|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=August 1995|pages=88\u201389}}</ref>\n\n''GamePro'' gave more mixed reviews to the Genesis and Super NES versions, criticizing that the sprites are too small and the graphics in general are unimpressive, especially in the Genesis version. The Genesis version's reviewer complained that the controls are a straight translation of the arcade version's four-button control, making special moves needlessly awkward to execute, while the Super NES version's reviewer felt the game was outshone by the Super NES version of ''[[Killer Instinct (1994 video game)|Killer Instinct]]'', which came out at the same time.

Though it was a bloody game, Primal Rage was rated \"T\" for Teen by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB). To appease the critics, the game was withdrawn, re-programmed, and re-released several times.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Later arcade incarnations of \"Primal Rage\" included a \"Gore/No Gore\" toggle switch which allowed the machine operator to disable the use of Fatalities, the eating of humans, and all of the game's blood.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn 1996 Ellie Rovella of [[Gilbert, Arizona]] launched a [[grassroots]] campaign against the game after her 11-year-old son bought and played the Genesis version of ''Primal Rage'' and executed Chaos' [[golden shower]]/urination [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|fatality]].

It was released for both [[CD-ROM]] and [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]]-based consoles. The [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] port has long loading times, a 3D intro, and fewer frames of animation for each character than the arcade version. Combo names are displayed like the arcade version. The Sega Saturn port is much like the PlayStation, except the sprites are larger and have more colours.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= |first= |title=Primal Rage Interview |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=83|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=June 1996 |page=66 |quote=The PlayStation does polygons much better, but this is a sprite-based game, and the Saturn obviously has better sprite handling. ...

This port features 3D intros of one character with narration whenever facing them in Arcade Mode. Combo names are absent. There was an early alpha version of this port released onto the Internet. The 3DO version is much like the Saturn one, except it has much smaller sprites. The [[Jaguar CD]] release is based on the 3DO version, although it has shorter loading times.\n\n[[Image:TN Primal Rage pal-front.jpg|thumb|right|PAL PlayStation cover]]\n\nThe [[SNES]] port censors Chaos' golden shower fatality.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Cart Queries|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=88 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1996|page=17}}</ref> This version also doesn't shrink the evil palette-swapped characters (i.e. Chaos and Diablo), and lacks the ending pictures shown when beating the game. This port features a few additions, such as Vertigo's fatalities each have different colored rings. The [[Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]] version was based on version 1.7, thus the new special moves and additional fatalities introduced in revision 2.3 were not present. It has more animation than the SNES version, but less vibrant colors. There is also an exclusive Easter Egg on the Cheat menu that replaces Diablo's followers with Probe Entertainment's former CEO and founder, Fergus McGovern. Based on the Mega Drive/Genesis port, the [[32X]] version's sprites are larger and have more colours. It has re-recorded music and new voice clips. The \"Okay, right?\" cheat is not present in the cheat menu.\n\n''Primal Rage'' was also released for various computers. The [[DOS]] ports feature different sound effects, larger sprites and all the frames of animation from the arcade version. The game CD included three different editions of the game, one for systems with 4 MB RAM, another for 8 MB and one for 16 MB, each with increasing fidelity to the arcade game. The Amiga version features 8-bit characters, and smaller sprites, giving players big spaces to move around. There are also new sound effects and screen-shaking effects. Although it was marketed as an [[Amiga 1200]] version, this version was in fact suitable for any Amiga with at least 2&nbsp;MB chip RAM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hol.abime.net/1147|title=Primal Rage : Hall Of Light \u2013 The database of Amiga games|website=hol.abime.net|access-date=2013-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815093907/http://hol.abime.net/1147|archive-date=2014-08-15|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] port was also planned (and even advertised in [[MacWorld]]'s January 1996 issue), but the port was cancelled in April 1996.<ref>{{cite newsgroup|newsgroup=comp.sys.mac.games.action|title=Update on Primal Rage: cancelled|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.sys.mac.games.action/_cGoliyfIMM/jXEQkX64UDAJ|date=April 24, 1996|access-date=October 26, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> <!-- poster name is Edward Derson Hou. -->\n\nVersions were released for various handheld systems.

Necrosan imprisons them in a state of semi-suspended animation, forms minions of his own and starts to wreak havoc on Urth. The gods then choose human Avatars for themselves. The Avatars fight the minions of Necrosan, release the gods from their prison and battle Necrosan himself. The warriors would be Malyssa, avatar of Vertigo; Arik, avatar of Sauron; Keena, avatar of Talon; Shank, avatar of Chaos; Sinjin, avatar of Diablo; Kaze, avatar of Blizzard; Tor, avatar of Armadon; and Xiao Ming, avatar of Slash Fang, a newly-introduced Primal God in the form of a [[Smilodon]].\n\nAlthough the game never came to be, its story was later adapted into ''Primal Rage: The Avatars''. Also, the characters of Slash Fang and Necrosan were released with the other god characters in the short-lived ''Primal Rage'' action figure series.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nA test arcade cabinet briefly appeared playable at the Golfland arcades in [[Milpitas, California]] and [[Sunnyvale, California]],{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} and a supposedly finished machine of this was shown at the California Extreme 2001 show.

From issue #4 of the ''Primal Rage'' comic published by Sirius Entertainment.]]\nWhen ''Primal Rage II'' was cancelled, Atari allegedly felt it was necessary to somehow present the story for the sequel in one form or another. Thus, in 1997, a novel called ''Primal Rage: The Avatars'', written by [[John Vornholt]], was published by Boulevard Books. The book tells what happened to the dinosaur gods 65 million years ago, and then moves into the main story of the gods' reign on Urth renewed, then the beast Necrosan appears. The book also focuses on fleshing out the world of ''Primal Rage'', and does so by bringing \"the Avatars\" to the forefront of the story, they being the humans chosen by their respective gods to be their shamans or other titles of nobility.\n\nA number of details to the backstory of ''Primal Rage'' are made clear in ''The Avatars'': The events in ''Primal Rage'' take place in the year 1000 AC (After Cataclysm) or about the year 3000 AD by the Gregorian calendar. The battles of the dinosaurs are referred to as \"The Primal Rage\". The spell used to imprison the dinosaur gods is called the Bonds of Forbidding. Necrosan the skeletal dragon (who is referred to as Necronus on the introductory page) reactivates the Bonds of Forbidding to entrap the gods.\n\n==Comic book series==\n''Sirius Entertainment'' published a 4-issue [[comic book]] mini-series based on the game from 1996 to 1998.

The game takes place on a post-apocalyptic version of Earth called \"Urth\". Players control one of seven large beasts that battle each other to determine the planet's fate. Matches feature many of the conventions of fighting games from the era including special moves and gory finishing maneuvers.\n\nVarious [[Porting|ports]] were released for [[home console]]s and [[personal computer]]s. Efforts to perfectly [[video game console emulator|emulate]] the arcade original have been unsuccessful due to the use of an unusual copy protection method.\n\nToys, comics, a novel and other merchandise tie-ins were produced. Though the game was a hit, it has been said that Atari Games derived more profit from its merchandising than from the game itself.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=NG Alphas: Atari Comes Alive |magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=35 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]] |date=November 1997|page=78}}</ref>\n\n==Settings==\n\n'''''Story'''''\n\nA massive [[Extinction event|meteor strike]] has devastated Earth. Human civilization comes to an end in the ensuing cataclysms and humanity regresses into tribes of [[Stone Age]] dwellers. A primordial [[rainforest]] covers the land and the continental landmass has shifted into the shape of a fire-breathing dinosaur skull. The planet is now primitively referred to as \"Urth\" by the survivors of the cataclysms.\n\nSeven fearsome creatures emerge from their slumber deep within the Urth's crust, and become worshiped as gods by the humans, who form segregated clans beneath the ones they follow. The beasts themselves are divided between those who wish to keep peace on Urth, and those who attempt to plunge the world into further chaos for their own benefit. \n\n\n'''''Beasts'''''\n\n*''Blizzard'' \nThe cryokinetic, [[ape]]-like, Virtuous Beast who is the god of goodness.\n\n*''Armadon''  \nThe spiky [[ceratopsian]]/[[thyreophoran]]-like, Virtuous Beast who is the god of life.\n\n*''Talon''\nThe striped, [[Dromaeosauridae|raptor]]-like, Virtuous Beast who is the god of of survival.\n\n*''Sauron''\nThe large, [[tyrannosaur]]-like, Virtuous Beast who is the god of hunger.\n\n*''Chaos'' \nThe vulgar, ape-like, Destructive Beast who is the god of decay.\n\n*''Vertigo''\nThe female, [[cobra]]/[[prosauropod]]-like, Destructive Beast who is the goddess of insanity.\n\n*''Diablo''\nThe hellish, tyrannosaur-like, Destructive Beast who is the god of evil. \n\nThese creatures have otherworldly or [[supernatural]] abilities. The Virtuous Beasts represented the side of the [[sacred]] while the Destructive Beasts were aligned with the [[occult]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Primal Rage'' is a traditional [[2D computer graphics|two-dimensional]] [[fighting game]] in which two [[Player character|players]] select characters to battle each other in one-on-one combat, or a single player is faced with a campaign of fights against the [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) over increasing [[Difficulty level|difficulty]]. The final battle of the [[single-player]] game consists of fighting all the other AI monsters with an increased power bar, made available in a [[minigame]] prior to the fight. A total of seven characters are playable. Each character has their own specialized set of three attack moves and abilities. The object is to deplete the opposing character's [[Health (game terminology)|health]] meter before the player's own runs out. There are also seven different background [[Level (video games)|stages]] where fighting takes place, each one representing one of the character's innate domains: the Cliff (Blizzard), the Hollows (Armadon), the Strip (Talon), the Cove (Sauron), the Ruins (Chaos), the Tomb (Vertigo) and the Inferno (Diablo).\n\nDuring fights, human tribesmen wander nearby and worship their gods. This allows for the creatures to toss them around or devour some to regain health (eating opponents' worshipers adds a bonus to one's score, while eating one's own will penalize the player). Prior to the final battle, a minigame commences in which the player is given the chance to eat as many worshipers as possible to increase health for the endurance round. Two human-controlled characters can trigger [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] minigames of human volleyball and bowling.\n\nUnlike most fighting games, where the special moves are performed by moving the [[joystick]] followed by pressing one or more buttons, ''Primal Rage'' features a system where the player holds down certain buttons, then performs the joystick movements. Later revisions of the arcade game added the ability to perform special moves in the more traditional way, with motion followed by button presses, but kept the original method as well. After the opponent is defeated, a brief moment is allowed for the player to perform a [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|finishing move]] to end the match in a more dramatic fashion; these are performed in a similar manner to the special moves. Although all characters feature three finishing moves, some of them were more of easter eggs than fatalities, such as Vertigo's \"La Vache Qui Rit\" (French for \"the laughing cow\"), a fatality in which Vertigo transforms her opponent into a cow, which moos and runs away.\n\n==Development==\nAnimator Jason Leong recounted: {{quote|Every year [Time Warner Interactive] throws a brain-storming session where everybody brings up new game ideas. A few years ago I brought up the concept of a head-to-head dinosaur fighting game, which coincidentally someone else also brought up, but their idea was just two T. Rexes fighting.

The animations seen in the game were then filmed using these models, through the process of [[stop motion]] animation, with about 400 frames shot for each fighter.<ref name=GPro74/>\n\nThe Saturn version of ''Primal Rage'' was the last version to be released.

Though it was a bloody game, Primal Rage was rated \"T\" for Teen by the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board]] (ESRB). To appease the critics, the game was withdrawn, re-programmed, and re-released several times.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Later arcade incarnations of \"Primal Rage\" included a \"Gore/No Gore\" toggle switch which allowed the machine operator to disable the use of Fatalities, the eating of humans, and all of the game's blood.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn 1996 Ellie Rovella of [[Gilbert, Arizona]] launched a [[grassroots]] campaign against the game after her 11-year-old son bought and played the Genesis version of ''Primal Rage'' and executed Chaos' [[golden shower]]/urination [[Fatality (Mortal Kombat)|fatality]].

It was released for both [[CD-ROM]] and [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]]-based consoles. The [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] port has long loading times, a 3D intro, and fewer frames of animation for each character than the arcade version.

This port features a few additions, such as Vertigo's fatalities each have different colored rings. The [[Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]] version was based on version 1.7, thus the new special moves and additional fatalities introduced in revision 2.3 were not present. It has more animation than the SNES version, but less vibrant colors. There is also an exclusive Easter Egg on the Cheat menu that replaces Diablo's followers with Probe Entertainment's former CEO and founder, Fergus McGovern.

The \"Okay, right?\" cheat is not present in the cheat menu.\n\n''Primal Rage'' was also released for various computers. The [[DOS]] ports feature different sound effects, larger sprites and all the frames of animation from the arcade version. The game CD included three different editions of the game, one for systems with 4 MB RAM, another for 8 MB and one for 16 MB, each with increasing fidelity to the arcade game. The Amiga version features 8-bit characters, and smaller sprites, giving players big spaces to move around. There are also new sound effects and screen-shaking effects. Although it was marketed as an [[Amiga 1200]] version, this version was in fact suitable for any Amiga with at least 2&nbsp;MB chip RAM.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hol.abime.net/1147|title=Primal Rage : Hall Of Light \u2013 The database of Amiga games|website=hol.abime.net|access-date=2013-12-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815093907/http://hol.abime.net/1147|archive-date=2014-08-15|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[Classic Mac OS|Mac OS]] port was also planned (and even advertised in [[MacWorld]]'s January 1996 issue), but the port was cancelled in April 1996.<ref>{{cite newsgroup|newsgroup=comp.sys.mac.games.action|title=Update on Primal Rage: cancelled|url=https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.sys.mac.games.action/_cGoliyfIMM/jXEQkX64UDAJ|date=April 24, 1996|access-date=October 26, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> <!-- poster name is Edward Derson Hou. -->\n\nVersions were released for various handheld systems.

Ken Humphries, senior producer of the home versions of the original ''Primal Rage'', said in an early 1996 interview that \"''Primal Rage 2'' should come out in the arcades in September 1996. As soon as they finish that, we'll start working on the consumer versions.\"<ref name=\"EGM83\"/> However, the game did not get very far into production before being cancelled, as Atari felt that it wouldn't generate enough sales.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seganerds.com/2017/03/16/the-cancelled-primal-rage-ii-has-been-released-online/|title=The cancelled Primal Rage II has been released online {{!}} SEGA Nerds|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-26}}</ref>\n\nThe controls were expanded from a four-button to a six-button configuration.<ref name=\"GPro96\">{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=Primal Rage 2: A New Breed of Gods: The Avatars|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=96 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=September 1996 |page=60}}</ref> The game was to feature all seven gods from the original plus ten newcomers: a new dinosaur, a boss, and eight humans called the Avatars,<ref name=\"GPro96\"/> that were the gods' surrogates on Urth, with the first game's characters meant to make a comeback as said gods. Necrosan, a boss in the form of a living [[dragon]] skeleton, once rumored by video game magazine ''[[GamePro]]'' to be added in an updated release of the original ''Primal Rage'', was to become the main antagonist.\n\nThe plot focused on the years after the first game's timeline. It turns out the meteor that crashed on [[The Urth of the New Sun|Urth]] was actually an egg which hatched a being known as Necrosan. The gods fight it but their efforts end up being useless. Necrosan imprisons them in a state of semi-suspended animation, forms minions of his own and starts to wreak havoc on Urth. The gods then choose human Avatars for themselves. The Avatars fight the minions of Necrosan, release the gods from their prison and battle Necrosan himself. The warriors would be Malyssa, avatar of Vertigo; Arik, avatar of Sauron; Keena, avatar of Talon; Shank, avatar of Chaos; Sinjin, avatar of Diablo; Kaze, avatar of Blizzard; Tor, avatar of Armadon; and Xiao Ming, avatar of Slash Fang, a newly-introduced Primal God in the form of a [[Smilodon]].\n\nAlthough the game never came to be, its story was later adapted into ''Primal Rage: The Avatars''. Also, the characters of Slash Fang and Necrosan were released with the other god characters in the short-lived ''Primal Rage'' action figure series.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nA test arcade cabinet briefly appeared playable at the Golfland arcades in [[Milpitas, California]] and [[Sunnyvale, California]],{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} and a supposedly finished machine of this was shown at the California Extreme 2001 show.

From issue #4 of the ''Primal Rage'' comic published by Sirius Entertainment.]]\nWhen ''Primal Rage II'' was cancelled, Atari allegedly felt it was necessary to somehow present the story for the sequel in one form or another. Thus, in 1997, a novel called ''Primal Rage: The Avatars'', written by [[John Vornholt]], was published by Boulevard Books. The book tells what happened to the dinosaur gods 65 million years ago, and then moves into the main story of the gods' reign on Urth renewed, then the beast Necrosan appears. The book also focuses on fleshing out the world of ''Primal Rage'', and does so by bringing \"the Avatars\" to the forefront of the story, they being the humans chosen by their respective gods to be their shamans or other titles of nobility.\n\nA number of details to the backstory of ''Primal Rage'' are made clear in ''The Avatars'': The events in ''Primal Rage'' take place in the year 1000 AC (After Cataclysm) or about the year 3000 AD by the Gregorian calendar. The battles of the dinosaurs are referred to as \"The Primal Rage\". The spell used to imprison the dinosaur gods is called the Bonds of Forbidding. Necrosan the skeletal dragon (who is referred to as Necronus on the introductory page) reactivates the Bonds of Forbidding to entrap the gods.\n\n==Comic book series==\n''Sirius Entertainment'' published a 4-issue [[comic book]] mini-series based on the game from 1996 to 1998.
