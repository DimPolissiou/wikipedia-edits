{"title_page": "Eidolon", "text_new": "{{Other uses}}\n{{In popular culture|date=January 2020}}\n\n{{Refimprove|date=January 2020}}\n\nIn ancient Greek literature, an '''eidolon''' (plural: '''eidola''' or  '''eidolons'''; [[Greek language|Greek]] \u03b5\u1f34\u03b4\u03c9\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd: \"image, idol, double, apparition, phantom, [[ghost]]\") is a spirit-image of a living or dead person; a shade or phantom look-alike of the human form. The concept of [[Helen of Troy]]'s eidolon was explored both by [[Homer]] and [[Euripides]]. However, where Homer uses the concept as a free-standing idea that gives Helen life after death, Euripides entangles it with the idea of ''[[kleos]],'' one being the product of the other.<ref name=\"Philology\"/><ref>{{cite journal | last = Meltzer | first = Gary S. | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = 'Where Is the Glory of Troy?'
