Since the 1960s, as part of the [[Native American civil rights|indigenous civil rights movements]], there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters. The protests target the prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the [[Cleveland Indians]] (in particular their \"[[Chief Wahoo]]\" logo, now officially retired); and the [[Washington Redskins]] (the term \"[[redskin]]s\" being defined in most American English dictionaries as \"derogatory slang\"). Changes, such as the retirement of Native American names and mascots in a wide array of schools, has been a steady trend since the 1970s.\n\nThe issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate the utilization of such terms.<ref name=\"King.2010\">{{cite book| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

After moving to [[Fenway Park]], home of the [[Boston Red Sox]], the team name was changed to the Boston Redskins in 1933, using a \"red\" identifier while retaining the Braves \"Indian Head\" logo. While defenders of the Redskins often cite coach [[William Henry Dietz]], who claimed Native American heritage, to justify the name; the use of Native American names and imagery by this [[National Football League|NFL]] team began in 1932 before hiring Dietz in 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsecyclopedia.com/nfl/wasbos/bosskins.html|title=The Boston Redskins|accessdate=2013-04-24| website=Sports Ecyclopedia}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Cleveland Indians]]' name originated from a request by club owner [[Charles Somers]] to baseball writers to choose a new name to replace the \"Naps\" following the departure of their star player [[Nap Lajoie]] after the 1914 season.<ref>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Baseball writers select \"Indians\" as the best name to apply to the former Naps |url= |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |location=Cleveland, Ohio |date=January 17, 1915 |access-date= |quote=With the going of Nap Lajoie to the Athletics, a new name had to be selected for the Cleveland American league club.

Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by [[African American]]s and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process.

Since the 1960s, as part of the [[Native American civil rights|indigenous civil rights movements]], there have been a number of protests and other actions by Native Americans and their supporters. The protests target the prominent use of such names and images by professional franchises such as the [[Cleveland Indians]] (in particular their \"[[Chief Wahoo]]\" logo, now officially retired); and the [[Washington Redskins]] (the term \"[[redskin]]s\" being defined in most American English dictionaries as \"derogatory slang\"). Changes, such as the retirement of Native American names and mascots in a wide array of schools, has been a steady trend since the 1970s.\n\nThe issue is often discussed in the media only in terms of the offensiveness of certain terms, images, and performances to individuals of Native American heritage, which tends to reduce the problem to one of feelings and personal opinions. This prevents a more comprehensive understanding of the history and context of the use of Native American names and images, and the reasons why sports teams should eliminate the utilization of such terms.<ref name=\"King.2010\">{{cite book| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Native_American_Mascot_Controversy.html?id=GApQrXWeGLwC| editor=C.

When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible.

Civil rights law in the United States reflect the difference between the experience of racism by [[African American]]s and Native Americans. The effects of slavery continued after emancipation in the form of discrimination that insured a continued source of cheap labor. What European Americans wanted from Native Americans was not labor but land, and many were willing to have native people themselves assimilate. Continued discrimination came to those who refused to do so, but asserted their separate identity and rights of sovereignty. The [[Cultural appropriation|appropriation]] of native cultures is therefore seen as discriminatory practice by some but is not understood as such by those that think of assimilation as a positive process. The difference is reflected in the continued popularity of Native Americans as mascots when similar usage of the names and images of any other ethnic group, in particular [[African American]]s, would be unthinkable, and the continued claim that the stereotype of the \"noble savage\" honors Native Americans.<ref>{{cite journal|volume=56 |journal=UCLA Law Review |page=591 |title=Red: Racism and the American Indian |last=Berger |first=Bethany R. |year=2009 |url=http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423112932/http://www.uclalawreview.org/pdf/56-3-2.pdf |archivedate=2015-04-23 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn February 2013, the [[Michigan Department of Civil Rights]] (MDCR) filed a complaint with the [[United States Department of Education|US Department of Education]]'s [[Office for Civil Rights]] (OCR).

Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported. It led President Trump to issue an executive order to make flu vaccines more readily available and of higher quality, and he provided additional funds for the pandemic threats program in the Department of Health and Human Services ([[United States Department of Health and Human Services|HHS]]).<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sanger|first=David E.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak.html|title=Before Virus Outbreak, a Cascade of Warnings Went Unheeded|date=March 19, 2020|work=The New York Times|access-date=March 20, 2020|last2=Lipton|first2=Eric|issn=0362-4331|last3=Sullivan|first3=Eileen|last4=Crowley|first4=Michael}}</ref> White House economists published a study in September 2019 that warned a pandemic could kill half a million Americans and devastate the economy.<ref>''[https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/business/coronavirus-economy-trump.html White House Economists Warned in 2019 a Pandemic Could Devastate America]'' March 31, 2020 New York Times</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the WHO also ran a simulation exercise of a global pandemic response involving more than 40 countries, although the results appear to be unavailable.<ref>[https://www.who.int/ihr/eoc-exercise/en/ \"Simulation exercise puts global pandemic readiness to the test\"], World Health Organization, Dec. 3, 2018</ref>\n\n===Centralized biodefense strategy===\n\nCiting lessons learned from the swine flu pandemic, Ebola outbreak, and the [[2001 anthrax attacks]], President Trump released a [[National Biodefense Strategy]] on September 18, 2018 in response to a Congressional directive.<ref name=\"statement\">{{cite web |last1=Trump |first1=Donald |title=Statement from the President on the National Biodefense Strategy and National Security Presidential Memorandum |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-president-national-biodefense-strategy-national-security-presidential-memorandum/ |publisher=The White House |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"UPI\">{{cite news |last1=Brokaw |first1=Sommer |title=Trump signs presidential memo on national biodefense |url=https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2018/09/18/Trump-signs-presidential-memo-on-national-biodefense/2071537290820/ |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |agency=United Press International |date=September 18, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|url=https://apnews.com/4c21af485a7d4ccebb22f7316b55d014/White-House-sets-'new-direction'-in-biodefense-strategy|title=White House Sets 'New Direction' in Biodefense Strategy|date=September 18, 2018|agency=Associated Press|access-date=September 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name=BartholomewOmberg>Rachel Bartholomew & Kristin Omberg, [https://thebulletin.org/2019/01/making-sense-of-the-2018-national-biodefense-strategy/ Making sense of the 2018 National Biodefense Strategy], ''Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists'' (January 18, 2019).</ref> According to Trump, the new strategy was designed to strengthen the nation's defenses against disease outbreaks and bioterrorism and to make responses to them more efficient and better coordinated.<ref name=\"statement\" /><ref name=\"UPI\" /> Concurrently, he released a National Security Presidential Memorandum that appointed Secretary of HHS [[Alex Azar]] to oversee implementation of the government's new biodefense strategy and directed [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[John Bolton]] to assist in reviewing and improving the nation's biodefenses.<ref name=\"Owermohle\">{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/09/18/trump-hhs-biodefense-827973|title=Trump puts HHS in charge of defense against biological threats|last=Owermohle|first=Sarah|website=Politico|access-date=December 31, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Memo\">{{cite web |last1=Trump |first1=Donald |title=Presidential Memorandum on the Support for National Biodefense |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/presidential-memorandum-support-national-biodefense/ |publisher=The White House |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"statement\" /> At a time when multiple agencies and departments shared responsibility for biodefense,<ref name=BartholomewOmberg /> Bolton and Azar claimed this centralization of primary authority for biodefense in the HHS would provide greater accountability.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Watson |first1=Kathryn |title=Trump administration outlines new biodefense approach |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-rolling-out-new-biodefense-strategy/ |accessdate=March 22, 2020 |publisher=CBS |date=September 18, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Reorganization and departures===\n\nIn May 2018, Bolton reorganized the executive branch's [[United States National Security Council]] (NSC), largely merging the group responsible for global [[health security]] and [[biodefense]] into a bigger group responsible for [[counter-proliferation]] and biodefense.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness.

A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

Trump praised his administration's response to the \"foreign\" virus while stating that \"a large number of new clusters in the United States were seeded by travelers from Europe.\" He closed the speech by calling for less partisanship during the pandemic and praising Americans' response to adversity.<ref>{{cite news |title='Tough Measures': Text of Trump's Address on Coronavirus |url=https://www.usnews.com/news/politics/articles/2020-03-11/tough-measures-text-of-trumps-address-on-coronavirus |accessdate=16 April 2020 |agency=AP |publisher=U.S. News & World Report |date=March 11, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hohmann |first1=James |title=Clarifications after Trump's Oval Office address are emblematic of his uneven coronavirus response |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2020/03/12/daily-202-clarifications-after-trump-s-oval-office-address-are-emblematic-of-his-uneven-coronavirus-response/5e69c2b988e0fa101a7475b1/ |accessdate=March 20, 2020 |work=The Washington Post |date=March 12, 2020}}</ref> After the WHO announced a 3.4% mortality rate for the cases on March 13,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/coronavirus-facts-is-there-a-cure-and-what-is-the-mortality-rate-of-the-virus|title=Coronavirus facts: is there a cure and what is the mortality rate of the virus?|last1=Devlin|first1=Hannah|last2=Boseley|first2=Sarah|date=13 March 2020|website=The Guardian|accessdate=13 March 2020}}</ref> Trump remarked on [[Fox News]]'s ''[[Hannity]]'' that this was a \"false number\" and the true figure was under 1%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/05/trump-coronavirus-who-global-death-rate-false-number|title=Trump calls WHO's global death rate from coronavirus 'a false number'|last1=Walters|first1=Joanna|last2=Aratani|first2=Lauren|date=5 March 2020|work=The Guardian|last3=Beaumont|first3=Peter}}</ref>\n\nOn March 16, Trump changed his tone on the outbreak to a somber one.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten.

Among the conclusions of the test was the lack of certain medical supplies to meet demand due to their needing to be imported.

The design, intended to solve the problem of stockpile waste and decay, was completed in 2018. Halyard requested funding to build a prototype, but this was not granted.\n\nA second BARDA contract was signed with Applied Research Associates of Albuquerque, to design an N95-rated mask that could be reused in emergencies without reduced effectiveness. Though federal reports had called for such a project since 2006, the ARA contract wasn't signed until 2017, and missed its 15-month completion deadline, resulting in the 2020 pandemic reaching the United States before the design was ready.<ref name=\"wp-masks\" />\n\nPrevious respiratory epidemics and government planning indicated a need for a stockpile of ventilators that were easier for less-trained medical personnel to use. BARDA Project Aura issued a [[request for proposals]] in 2008, with a goal of FDA approval in 2010 or 2011. A contract for the production of up to 40,000 ventilators was awarded to Newport Medical Instruments, a small ventilator manufacturer, with a target price of $3,000, much lower than more complicated machines costing more than $10,000, and it produced prototypes with target FDA approval in 2013. [[Covidien]] purchased NMI and after for more money to complete the project (bringing the total cost to around $8 million) asked the government to cancel the contract, saying it wasn't profitable. The government awarded a new $13.8 million contract to [[Philips]], in 2014. The design for the Trilogy Evo Universal gained FDA approval in July 2019. The government ordered 10,000 ventilators in September 2019, with a mid-2020 deadline for the first deliveries and a deadline of 2022 to complete all 10,000. Despite the start of the epidemic in December, the capacity of the company to have produced enough to fill the full order, and the ability of the government to force faster production, the government did not reach an agreement with Philips for accelerated delivery until March 10, 2020.<ref name=\"nyt-vent\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/business/coronavirus-us-ventilator-shortage.html|title=The U.S. Tried to Build a New Fleet of Ventilators.

Retrieved March 23, 2020</ref>\n\n===Containment and mitigation===\n\n{{See also|Workplace hazard controls for COVID-19}}\n\nThe early phases of public health efforts for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/ \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations such as the CDC focus on both containment, to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic attempts to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''The Plain Dealer'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19, at the other extreme, is a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |publisher=NPR |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

Runstein  ''Modern Recording Techniques'', Focal Press 2009 {{ISBN|0-240-81069-4}}, page 117</ref>\nIt is best known as a convenient power source for [[condenser microphone]]s, though many active [[DI unit|direct box]]es also use it. The technique is also used in other applications where power supply and signal communication take place over the same wires.\n\n[[File:Oktava319.jpg|thumb|upright| A [[condenser microphone]] requires power to produce a DC polarizing voltage and to power an internal amplifier required to drive long cables]]\nPhantom power supplies are often built into [[mixing console]]s, [[microphone preamplifiers]] and similar equipment. In addition to powering the circuitry of a microphone, traditional condenser microphones also use phantom power for polarizing the microphone's transducer element.\n\n==History==\nPhantom powering was used in [[telephone]] systems since the introduction of the rotary-dial telephone in 1919 before it was applied to condenser microphones. One such application in the telephone system was to provide a [[Direct current|DC]] signaling path around transformer connected amplifiers in analogue line transmission systems. The first known commercially available phantom-powered microphone was the [[Schoeps]] model CMT 20, which came out in 1964, built to the specifications of French radio with 9\u201312 volt DC phantom power; the positive pole of this powering was grounded. Microphone preamplifiers of the [[Nagra]] IV-series tape recorders offered this type of powering as an option for many years and Schoeps continued to support \"negative phantom\" until the CMT series was discontinued in the mid-1970s, but it is obsolete now.\n\nIn 1966, [[Neumann GmbH]] presented a new type of transistorized microphone to the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]], NRK. Norwegian Radio had requested phantom-powered operation. Since NRK already had 48 V available in their studios for their emergency lighting systems, this voltage was used for powering the new microphones (model KM 84), and is the origin of 48-V phantom power. This arrangement was later standardized in DIN 45596.\n\n==Standards==\nThe International Electrotechnical Commission Standards Committee's \"Multimedia systems - Guide to the recommended characteristics of analogue interfaces to achieve interoperability\" (IEC 61938:2018) specifies parameters for microphone phantom power delivery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/30762|title=IEC 61938:2018 {{!}} IEC Webstore|website=webstore.iec.ch|access-date=2016-04-19}}</ref> Three variants are defined by the document: P12, P24 and P48.

A microphone or other device can obtain DC power from either signal line to ground terminal, and two capacitors block this DC from appearing at the output. R1 and R2 should be 6.81k ohms for \"P48\" 48 volt phantom. R3-6 and [[Zener diode]]s 1-4 protect the output to a maximum of 10v.]]\n\n[[File:Audio-Technica AT8801 Phantom Power Supply.jpg|thumb|right| An external phantom power supply.]]\n\nPhantom powering consists of a [[phantom circuit]] where direct current is applied equally through the two [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signal]] lines of a [[balanced audio connector]] (in modern equipment, both pins 2 and 3 of an [[XLR connector]]). The supply voltage is referenced to the ground pin of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally is connected to the cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. When phantom powering was introduced, one of its advantages was that the same type of balanced, shielded microphone cable that studios were already using for [[dynamic microphone]]s could be used for condenser microphones. This is in contrast to microphones with [[Vacuum tube|vacuum-tube]] circuitry, most of which require special, multi-conductor cables.<ref group=\"note\">There are phantom-powered vacuum tube microphones, such as the [http://www.microtechgefell.com/index.php/en/microphones/studio-a-recording/large-membrane-tube-mics/340-um900-roehrenmikrofon Microtech Gefell UM900] and [http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/187139bf88c8539d/index.html/ Audio-Technica AT3060]</ref>\n\nWith phantom power, the supply voltage is effectively invisible to balanced microphones that do not use it, which includes most dynamic microphones. A balanced signal consists only of the differences in voltage between two signal lines; phantom powering places the same DC voltage on both signal lines of a balanced connection. This is in marked contrast to another, slightly earlier method of powering known as \"parallel powering\" or \"T-powering\" (from the German term ''Tonaderspeisung''), in which DC was overlaid directly onto the signal in differential mode. Connecting a conventional microphone to an input that had parallel powering enabled could very well damage the microphone.\n\nThe IEC 61938 Standard defines 48-volt, 24-volt, and 12-volt phantom powering. The signal conductors are positive, both fed through resistors of equal value (6.81 [[kilohm|k\u03a9]] for 48 V, 1.2 k\u03a9 for 24 V, and 680 \u03a9 for 12 V), and the shield is [[ground (electricity)|ground]]. The 6.81&nbsp;k\u03a9 value is not critical, but the resistors must be matched to within 0.1%<ref>http://sound.whsites.net/project96.htm</ref> or better to maintain good [[Common-mode rejection ratio|common-mode rejection]] in the circuit. The 24-volt version of phantom powering, proposed quite a few years after the 12 and 48 V versions, was also included in the DIN standard and is in the IEC standard, but it was never widely adopted by equipment manufacturers.\n\nNearly all modern [[mixing console|mixing consoles]] have a switch for turning phantom power on or off; in most high-end equipment this can be done individually by channel, while on smaller mixers a single master switch may control power delivery to all channels. Phantom power can be blocked in any  channel with a 1:1 isolation transformer or blocking capacitors. Phantom powering can cause equipment malfunction or even damage if used with cables or adapters that connect one side of the input to ground, or if certain equipment other than microphones is connected to it.\n\n[[Instrument amplifier]]s rarely provide phantom power. To use equipment requiring it with these amplifiers, a separate power supply must be inserted into the line. These are readily available commercially, or alternatively are one of the easier projects for the amateur electronics constructor.\n\n==Caveats==\n[[File:AKG C1000S microphone, open.jpg|right|thumb|[[AKG C1000|AKG C1000S]] showing battery]]\n\nSome microphones offer a choice of internal battery powering or (external) phantom powering. In some such microphones it is advisable to remove the internal batteries when phantom power is being used since batteries may corrode and leak chemicals. Other microphones are specifically designed to switch over to the internal batteries if an external supply fails, which may be useful.\n\nPhantom powering is not always implemented correctly or adequately, even in professional-quality preamps, mixers, and recorders. In part this is because first-generation (late-1960s through mid-1970s) 48-volt phantom-powered condenser microphones had simple circuitry and required only small amounts of operating current (typically less than 1&nbsp;[[Milliampere|mA]] per microphone), so the phantom supply circuits typically built into recorders, mixers, and preamps of that time were designed on the assumption that this current would be adequate. The original DIN 45596 phantom-power specification called for a maximum of 2&nbsp;mA. This practice has carried forward to the present; many 48-volt phantom power supply circuits, especially in low-cost and portable equipment, simply cannot supply more than 1 or 2&nbsp;mA total without breaking down. Some circuits also have significant additional resistance in series with the standard pair of supply resistors for each microphone input; this may not affect low-current microphones much, but it can disable microphones that need more current.\n\nMid-1970s and later condenser microphones designed for 48-volt phantom powering often require much more current (e.g., 2\u20134&nbsp;mA for Neumann transformerless microphones, 4\u20135&nbsp;mA for the Schoeps CMC (\"Colette\") series and Josephson microphones, 5\u20136&nbsp;mA for most [[Shure]] KSM-series microphones, 8&nbsp;mA for CAD Equiteks and 10&nbsp;mA for Earthworks). The IEC standard gives 10&nbsp;mA as the maximum allowed current per microphone. If its required current is not available, a microphone may still put out a signal, but it cannot deliver its intended level of performance. The specific symptoms vary somewhat, but the most common result will be reduction of the maximum sound-pressure level that the microphone can handle without overload (distortion). Some microphones will also show lower sensitivity (output level for a given sound-pressure level).\n\nMost [[ground lift]] switches have the unwanted effect of disconnecting phantom power. There must always be a DC current path between pin 1 of the microphone and the negative side of the 48 volt supply, if power is to reach the microphone's electronics. Lifting the ground, which is normally pin 1, breaks this path and disables the phantom power supply.\n\nThere is a common belief that connecting a dynamic or ribbon microphone to a phantom-powered input will damage it. There are three possibilities for this damage to occur. If there is a fault in the cable, phantom power may damage some mics by applying a voltage across the output of the microphone.<ref>{{cite web |quote=Sending Phantom Power to an old (prior to 1970 design) ribbon microphone without an isolating transformer, while using a bad cable, which has the ground (pin 1) shorted to pin 2 or pin 3 of the XLR.

Runstein  ''Modern Recording Techniques'', Focal Press 2009 {{ISBN|0-240-81069-4}}, page 117</ref>\nIt is best known as a convenient power source for [[condenser microphone]]s, though many active [[DI unit|direct box]]es also use it. The technique is also used in other applications where power supply and signal communication take place over the same wires.\n\n[[File:Oktava319.jpg|thumb|upright| A [[condenser microphone]] requires power to produce a DC polarizing voltage and to power an internal amplifier required to drive long cables]]\nPhantom power supplies are often built into [[mixing console]]s, [[microphone preamplifiers]] and similar equipment. In addition to powering the circuitry of a microphone, traditional condenser microphones also use phantom power for polarizing the microphone's transducer element.\n\n==History==\nPhantom powering was used in [[telephone]] systems since the introduction of the rotary-dial telephone in 1919 before it was applied to condenser microphones. One such application in the telephone system was to provide a [[Direct current|DC]] signaling path around transformer connected amplifiers in analogue line transmission systems. The first known commercially available phantom-powered microphone was the [[Schoeps]] model CMT 20, which came out in 1964, built to the specifications of French radio with 9\u201312 volt DC phantom power; the positive pole of this powering was grounded. Microphone preamplifiers of the [[Nagra]] IV-series tape recorders offered this type of powering as an option for many years and Schoeps continued to support \"negative phantom\" until the CMT series was discontinued in the mid-1970s, but it is obsolete now.\n\nIn 1966, [[Neumann GmbH]] presented a new type of transistorized microphone to the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]], NRK. Norwegian Radio had requested phantom-powered operation. Since NRK already had 48 V available in their studios for their emergency lighting systems, this voltage was used for powering the new microphones (model KM 84), and is the origin of 48-V phantom power. This arrangement was later standardized in DIN 45596.\n\n==Standards==\nThe International Electrotechnical Commission Standards Committee's \"Multimedia systems - Guide to the recommended characteristics of analogue interfaces to achieve interoperability\" (IEC 61938:2018) specifies parameters for microphone phantom power delivery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/30762|title=IEC 61938:2018 {{!}} IEC Webstore|website=webstore.iec.ch|access-date=2016-04-19}}</ref> Three variants are defined by the document: P12, P24 and P48.

A microphone or other device can obtain DC power from either signal line to ground terminal, and two capacitors block this DC from appearing at the output. R1 and R2 should be 6.81k ohms for \"P48\" 48 volt phantom. R3-6 and [[Zener diode]]s 1-4 protect the output to a maximum of 10v.]]\n\nPhantom powering consists of a [[phantom circuit]] where direct current is applied equally through the two [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signal]] lines of a [[balanced audio connector]] (in modern equipment, both pins 2 and 3 of an [[XLR connector]]). The supply voltage is referenced to the ground pin of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally is connected to the cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. When phantom powering was introduced, one of its advantages was that the same type of balanced, shielded microphone cable that studios were already using for [[dynamic microphone]]s could be used for condenser microphones. This is in contrast to microphones with [[Vacuum tube|vacuum-tube]] circuitry, most of which require special, multi-conductor cables.<ref group=\"note\">There are phantom-powered vacuum tube microphones, such as the [http://www.microtechgefell.com/index.php/en/microphones/studio-a-recording/large-membrane-tube-mics/340-um900-roehrenmikrofon Microtech Gefell UM900] and [http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/187139bf88c8539d/index.html/ Audio-Technica AT3060]</ref>\n\nWith phantom power, the supply voltage is effectively invisible to balanced microphones that do not use it, which includes most dynamic microphones. A balanced signal consists only of the differences in voltage between two signal lines; phantom powering places the same DC voltage on both signal lines of a balanced connection. This is in marked contrast to another, slightly earlier method of powering known as \"parallel powering\" or \"T-powering\" (from the German term ''Tonaderspeisung''), in which DC was overlaid directly onto the signal in differential mode. Connecting a conventional microphone to an input that had parallel powering enabled could very well damage the microphone.\n\nThe IEC 61938 Standard defines 48-volt, 24-volt, and 12-volt phantom powering. The signal conductors are positive, both fed through resistors of equal value (6.81 [[kilohm|k\u03a9]] for 48 V, 1.2 k\u03a9 for 24 V, and 680 \u03a9 for 12 V), and the shield is [[ground (electricity)|ground]]. The 6.81&nbsp;k\u03a9 value is not critical, but the resistors must be matched to within 0.1%<ref>http://sound.whsites.net/project96.htm</ref> or better to maintain good [[Common-mode rejection ratio|common-mode rejection]] in the circuit. The 24-volt version of phantom powering, proposed quite a few years after the 12 and 48 V versions, was also included in the DIN standard and is in the IEC standard, but it was never widely adopted by equipment manufacturers.\n[[File:Audio-Technica AT8801 Phantom Power Supply.jpg|thumb|right| An external phantom power supply.]]\n\nNearly all modern [[mixing console|mixing consoles]] have a switch for turning phantom power on or off; in most high-end equipment this can be done individually by channel, while on smaller mixers a single master switch may control power delivery to all channels. Phantom power can be blocked in any  channel with a 1:1 isolation transformer or blocking capacitors. Phantom powering can cause equipment malfunction or even damage if used with cables or adapters that connect one side of the input to ground, or if certain equipment other than microphones is connected to it.\n\n[[Instrument amplifier]]s rarely provide phantom power. To use equipment requiring it with these amplifiers, a separate power supply must be inserted into the line. These are readily available commercially, or alternatively are one of the easier projects for the amateur electronics constructor.\n\n==Caveats==\n[[File:AKG C1000S microphone, open.jpg|right|thumb|[[AKG C1000|AKG C1000S]] showing battery]]\n\nSome microphones offer a choice of internal battery powering or (external) phantom powering. In some such microphones it is advisable to remove the internal batteries when phantom power is being used since batteries may corrode and leak chemicals. Other microphones are specifically designed to switch over to the internal batteries if an external supply fails, which may be useful.\n\nPhantom powering is not always implemented correctly or adequately, even in professional-quality preamps, mixers, and recorders. In part this is because first-generation (late-1960s through mid-1970s) 48-volt phantom-powered condenser microphones had simple circuitry and required only small amounts of operating current (typically less than 1&nbsp;[[Milliampere|mA]] per microphone), so the phantom supply circuits typically built into recorders, mixers, and preamps of that time were designed on the assumption that this current would be adequate.

He next sculpted a clay master model in an unfinished church in [[Passaic, New Jersey]], and this was then divided into sections and transported by [[railroad]] to the Birmingham Steel and Iron Company for the preparation of casting molds for the iron.<ref name=times/>\n\nThe sculptor, [[Giuseppe Moretti]] received an artist's fee of $6,000, which would be about $90,000 in today's currency. The Commercial Club of Birmingham held art shows, concerts, baseball games, and many more activities to raise the estimated $15,000 ($225,000 in today's currency) it would cost to build and transport the statue. It is also noted that pot metal statuettes of ''Vulcan'' were sold at both the St. Louis World's Fair and in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] for two dollars apiece to help in the accumulated costs it took to create the statue.<ref>Billmeier, Katherine Estes, Philip A.

The statue has a chest circumference of {{convert|22|ft|6|in|m|0}} and a waist circumference of {{convert|18|ft|3|in|m|0}}.\n\n===1904 World's Fair===\nThe statue was shipped to St. Louis as Birmingham's entry into the 1904 World's Fair.  Vulcan dramatically demonstrated the mineral riches and manufacturing capabilities of the Birmingham area while on display in the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition]]'s \"Palace of Mines and Metallurgy\".  It was awarded a \"Grand Prize\".\n\nWhen the 1904 World's Fair ended, the ''Vulcan'' statue was dismantled and returned to its home city of Birmingham, only to be left in pieces alongside the railroad tracks due to unpaid freight bills.\n\n===Alabama State Fairgrounds===\nThe ''Vulcan'' statue was eventually re-erected at the [[Alabama State Fairgrounds]], but the statue's arms were installed incorrectly, and the god was without his [[spear]], which had been lost on the way from St. Louis.\n\nWith nothing to hold in its hands, ''Vulcan'' soon became an advertising figure.  Over the years, ''Vulcan'' held an ice cream cone, a [[Coca-Cola]] bottle, and even [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]] pickles.  In the late 1920s, the statue was disassembled for inspection. During this time, children would often play around the disassembled statue.  It was painted a flesh color and was reassembled in the early 1930s.\n\n===On Red Mountain===\nIt was not until 1936 that the statue found a suitable home, thanks to the [[Works Progress Administration]], which partially funded a new park in the city at the top of [[Red Mountain (Alabama)|Red Mountain]].

Evelyn Tully was crowned  the Vulcan Queen.   Guests of honor included the foundrymen who originally cast ''Vulcan''.  A crowd of 5,000 was present for the opening night of the festival.\n\nIn 1938 a challenge was sent out to hundreds of engineers and architects throughout the Southeast to design the base and park area.  There were hundreds of submissions but a little known draftsman by the name of Carl Franklin Edins from Birmingham, Alabama was unanimously declared the winner.\n\nTo take full advantage of ''Vulcan''{{'}}s position overlooking Birmingham, the city's [[Junior Chamber of Commerce]] in 1946 made the statue into a symbol for [[road safety]].  His spear was replaced by a [[neon lamp|neon]] torch that glowed green, except during the 24&nbsp;hours following a fatal traffic accident, when it glowed red. The spear was restored after the 1999\u20132004 restoration.\n\nIn 1949, ''Vulcan'' got new neighbors, when two television stations, [[WVTM|WAFM-TV (now WVTM)]] and [[WBRC]] located their studios and towers on Red Mountain.\n\n===Centennial facelift===\n[[File:Vulcan Statue January 1990.jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of ''Vulcan''  dated to January 1990. The photograph shows how the statue looked prior to the 1999\u20132004 restoration.]]\nTo celebrate Birmingham's centennial, the area around the statue was given a $1&nbsp;million facelift in 1971.  The original tower was clad in Alabama [[marble]] with an elevator and observation deck added. A covered walkway also connected a gift shop and snack bar.  ''Vulcan'' was repainted a rust red  a few years later.  ''Vulcan'' was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] on July 6, 1976.\n\nUnfortunately, the statue itself had, when originally placed atop the pedestal, been filled up to the chest with [[concrete]] and had begun to deteriorate seriously due to different expansion and contraction rates of concrete versus cast iron. By 1990, an engineering study found that the statue was in danger of collapse.\n\n===1999\u20132004 restoration===\n[[File:Vulcan statue.jpg|thumb|''Vulcan'' on its restored pedestal with new elevator tower]]\n\n''Vulcan'' was removed during October and November 1999 in preparations for a $14&nbsp;million renovation process that saw the park and pedestal restored to its original 1938 appearance. The statue sat in Vulcan Park's parking lot until the fall of 2001, when it was shipped to Robinson Iron to be repaired. The statue itself was thoroughly inspected and repaired, with some parts, including the lost spear point, re-cast. The new and restored pieces were thoroughly coated with a durable paint system, including a light-gray finish coat dubbed \"Vulcan Gray\" by the specifier.\n\nMeanwhile, in 2002, the 1971 park additions were demolished, and scaffolding went up around ''Vulcan''{{'}}s tower. Workmen cleaned and repaired the original tower. ''Vulcan''{{'}}s head and right arm went on display at the [[Birmingham Museum of Art]] while the tower was prepared.\n\n''Vulcan'' was re-erected on a steel armature atop his tower during June 2003, restored to its original appearance as intended by Moretti, reoriented to the east. Television stations WVTM and WBRC both provided live [[webcam]]s of the reinstallation.\n\nShortly after the statue was reinstalled, the scaffolding came down, and a new observation deck, providing panoramic views of the area, was installed. The museum at the base was rebuilt and a new elevator was installed, but oriented so it would not be easily seen from downtown Birmingham. The original waterfalls were not rebuilt, though the stone walkways leading from the parking lot directly to ''Vulcan''{{'}}s tower were restored. The statue and park were officially reopened in 2004, celebrating Vulcan's 100th birthday.  In 2004, Vulcan Park welcomed more than 100,000 visitors who took in the statue's views of downtown Birmingham.\n\nThe restoration project received a National Preservation Honor Award from the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite press release | title =National Trust Presents National Preservation Honor Award to Vulcan Park in Birmingham, Alabama | publisher =National Trust for Historic Preservation | date =2006-11-02 | url =http://www.preservationnation.org/resources/case-studies/preservation-award-winners/vulcan-park.html | accessdate =2009-02-04}}</ref>\n\n==Vulcan Park and Museum==\n[[File:Vulcan Center at the top of Red Mountain in Birmingham Alabama.JPG|thumb|Vulcan Center at the top of Red Mountain]]\n\nVulcan Park and Museum (VPM) features views of Birmingham, an interactive history museum that examines ''Vulcan'' and Birmingham's story, and a 10-acre (4 ha) urban green space.

Primarily composed of [[quartz monzonite]], the dome of Stone Mountain was formed during the formation of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] around 300\u2013350 million years ago (during the [[Carboniferous]] period), part of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?path=/LandResources/Geography/Mountains/SitesandFeatures-1&id=h-2131 |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: Granite Outcrops |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> It formed as a result of the upwelling of [[magma]] from within the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]].  This magma solidified to form granite within the crust five to ten miles below the surface.\n\nThe Stone Mountain pluton continues underground {{convert|9|mi|km}} at its longest point into [[Gwinnett County]].

The tourmaline is mostly black in color, and the majority of it exists as optically continuous skeletal<ref>''Skeletal Tourmaline, Undercooling, and Crystallization History of the Stone Mountain Granite, Georgia, U.S.A.,'' Kristen M.

Over time, [[erosion]] eventually exposed the present mountain of more resistant igneous rock.  This intrusion of granite also gave rise to [[Panola Mountain]] and Arabia Mountain, both in [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]], smaller outcroppings farther south of Stone Mountain.\n\n==Natural history==\n[[File:Summit of Stone Mountain, Kennesaw Mountain in Background.jpg|thumb|right|Summit of Stone Mountain, [[Kennesaw Mountain]] in background]]\nThe top of the mountain is a landscape of bare rock and rock [[stream pool|pool]]s, and it provides views of the surrounding area including the skyline of [[downtown Atlanta]], often [[Kennesaw Mountain]], and on very clear days even the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. On some days, the top of the mountain is shrouded in a heavy fog, and visibility may be limited to only a few feet.\n\nThe clear freshwater pools on the summit form by rainwater gathering in eroded depressions, and are home to unusual [[clam shrimp]] and [[fairy shrimp]]. The tiny shrimp appear only during the rainy season. Through the process of [[cryptobiosis]], the tiny shrimp eggs (or [[Microbial cyst|cysts]]) can remain dormant for years in the dried out depressions, awaiting favorable conditions. These [[vernal pool]]s are also home to several federally listed rare and endangered plant species, such as black-spored quillwort (''[[Isoetes melanospora]]'') and pool sprite (also called snorkelwort, ''[[Gratiola amphiantha]]'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?spcode=Q1ST|title=Species Profile for Little amphianthus (Amphianthus pusillus)|website=ecos.fws.gov|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ecos.fws.gov/ecp0/profile/speciesProfile?spcode=S015|title=Species Profile for Black Spored quillwort (Isoetes melanospora)|website=ecos.fws.gov|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Quercus-georgiana.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Leaves of the [[Georgia oak]]]]\nThe mountain's lower slopes are wooded.

When the mountain was first encountered by [[Europe]]an explorers, its summit was encircled by a rock wall, similar to that still to be found on Georgia's [[Fort Mountain State Park|Fort Mountain]]. The wall is believed to have been built by early [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] inhabitants of the area, although its purpose remains unclear. By the beginning of the 20th century, the wall had disappeared, the rocks having been taken away by early visitors as souvenirs, rolled down the rockface, or removed by the commercial quarrying operation.  The mountain was the eastern end of the Campbellton Trail, a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] path that ran through what is now the [[Atlanta]] area.\n\t \nEuropeans first learned of the mountain in 1567, when [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] explorers were told of a mountain farther inland which was \"very high, shining when the sun set like a fire.\"{{explain|date=May 2018}} By this time, the Stone Mountain area was inhabited by the [[Creek (people)|Creek]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Cherokee]] peoples.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the area was known as Rock Mountain.  After the founding of DeKalb County and the [[county seat]] of [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur]] in 1822, Stone Mountain was a natural recreation area; it was common for young couples on dates to ride to the mountain on horseback. The mountain is easy to climb and there has been a path since the nineteenth century.\n\t \nEntrepreneur Aaron Cloud built a {{convert|165|ft|m}} wooden observation tower at the summit of the mountain in 1838, but it was destroyed by a storm and replaced by a much smaller tower in 1851. Visitors to the mountain would travel to the area by rail and road, and then walk up the {{convert|1.1|mi|km|adj=on}} mountaintop trail to the top, where Cloud also had a restaurant and club.\n\t \nGranite quarrying started at Stone Mountain in the 1830s, but became a major industry following the completion of a railroad spur to the quarry site in 1847. This line was rebuilt by the [[Georgia Railroad]] in 1869. Over the years, Stone Mountain granite was used in many buildings and structures, including the locks of the [[Panama Canal]], the steps to the East Wing of the [[United States Capitol]] and the [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] in Tokyo. In recent years, granite suppliers in Georgia sent stone samples cut from Stone Mountain to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Foundation to be considered for use in a planned [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial|monument in King's honor]]; the foundation later chose to use granite imported from China.<ref>{{cite news|author=Democracy in America American politics |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/08/martin-luther-king |title=Martin Luther King: A blockheaded memorial |newspaper=The Economist |date= August 30, 2011|accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> Quarrying during earlier periods also destroyed several spectacular geological features on Stone Mountain, such as the Devil's Crossroads, which was located on top of the mountain.\n\t \nIn 1887 Stone Mountain was purchased for $45,000 by the Venable Brothers of Atlanta, who quarried the mountain for 24 more years, and descendants of the Venable family would retain ownership of the mountain until it was purchased by the State of Georgia in the 1950s.\n\n[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] mentioned the monument in his 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech in Washington, D.C., when he said \"let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!\"<ref>{{cite web|last=King|first=Martin Luther, Jr|title=I have a Dream|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/mlk01.asp|publisher=Lillian Goldman Law Library|accessdate=8 October 2011|date=28 August 1963|quote=let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], Stone Mountain Park provided venues for Olympic events in tennis, [[Archery at the 1996 Summer Olympics|archery]] and [[Cycling at the 1996 Summer Olympics|track cycling]].<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1996/1996v1.pdf 1996 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 1. p. 543.</ref><ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1996/1996v3.pdf 1996 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 3. pp. 448, 453.</ref> The venues for archery and cycling were temporary and are now part of the songbird and habitat trail.<ref>''Driving Map: Stone Mountain Park'' (2009).

Primarily composed of [[quartz monzonite]], the dome of Stone Mountain was formed during the formation of the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] around 300\u2013350 million years ago (during the [[Carboniferous]] period), part of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?path=/LandResources/Geography/Mountains/SitesandFeatures-1&id=h-2131 |title=New Georgia Encyclopedia: Granite Outcrops |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date=2005-01-07 |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> It formed as a result of the upwelling of [[magma]] from within the Earth's [[Crust (geology)|crust]].  This magma solidified to form granite within the crust five to ten miles below the surface.\n\nThe Stone Mountain pluton continues underground {{convert|9|mi|km}} at its longest point into [[Gwinnett County]].

The tourmaline is mostly black in color, and the majority of it exists as optically continuous skeletal<ref>''Skeletal Tourmaline, Undercooling, and Crystallization History of the Stone Mountain Granite, Georgia, U.S.A.,'' Kristen M.

Over time, [[erosion]] eventually exposed the present mountain of more resistant igneous rock.  This intrusion of granite also gave rise to [[Panola Mountain]] and Arabia Mountain, both in [[DeKalb County, Georgia|DeKalb County]], smaller outcroppings farther south of Stone Mountain.\n\n==Natural history==\n[[File:Summit of Stone Mountain, Kennesaw Mountain in Background.jpg|thumb|right|Summit of Stone Mountain, [[Kennesaw Mountain]] in background]]\nThe top of the mountain is a landscape of bare rock and rock [[stream pool|pool]]s, and it provides views of the surrounding area including the skyline of [[downtown Atlanta]], often [[Kennesaw Mountain]], and on very clear days even the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. On some days, the top of the mountain is shrouded in a heavy fog, and visibility may be limited to only a few feet.  \n\nThe clear freshwater pools on the summit form by rainwater gathering in eroded depressions, and are home to unusual [[clam shrimp]] and [[fairy shrimp]]. The tiny shrimp appear only during the rainy season. Through the process of [[cryptobiosis]], the tiny shrimp eggs (or [[Microbial cyst|cysts]]) can remain dormant for years in the dried out depressions, awaiting favorable conditions.

When the mountain was first encountered by [[Europe]]an explorers, its summit was encircled by a rock wall, similar to that still to be found on Georgia's [[Fort Mountain State Park|Fort Mountain]]. The wall is believed to have been built by early [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] inhabitants of the area, although its purpose remains unclear. By the beginning of the 20th century, the wall had disappeared, the rocks having been taken away by early visitors as souvenirs, rolled down the rockface, or removed by the commercial quarrying operation.  The mountain was the eastern end of the Campbellton Trail, a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] path that ran through what is now the [[Atlanta]] area.\n\t \nEuropeans first learned of the mountain in 1567, when [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] explorers were told of a mountain farther inland which was \"very high, shining when the sun set like a fire.\"{{explain|date=May 2018}} By this time, the Stone Mountain area was inhabited by the [[Creek (people)|Creek]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Cherokee]] peoples.\n\nIn the early 19th century, the area was known as Rock Mountain.  After the founding of DeKalb County and the [[county seat]] of [[Decatur, Georgia|Decatur]] in 1822, Stone Mountain was a natural recreation area; it was common for young couples on dates to ride to the mountain on horseback. The mountain is easy to climb and there has been a path since the nineteenth century.\n\t \nEntrepreneur Aaron Cloud built a {{convert|165|ft|m}} wooden observation tower at the summit of the mountain in 1838, but it was destroyed by a storm and replaced by a much smaller tower in 1851. Visitors to the mountain would travel to the area by rail and road, and then walk up the {{convert|1.1|mi|km|adj=on}} mountaintop trail to the top, where Cloud also had a restaurant and club.\n\t \nGranite quarrying started at Stone Mountain in the 1830s, but became a major industry following the completion of a railroad spur to the quarry site in 1847. This line was rebuilt by the [[Georgia Railroad]] in 1869. Over the years, Stone Mountain granite was used in many buildings and structures, including the locks of the [[Panama Canal]], the steps to the East Wing of the [[United States Capitol]] and the [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] in Tokyo. In recent years, granite suppliers in Georgia sent stone samples cut from Stone Mountain to the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Foundation to be considered for use in a planned [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial|monument in King's honor]]; the foundation later chose to use granite imported from China.<ref>{{cite news|author=Democracy in America American politics |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/08/martin-luther-king |title=Martin Luther King: A blockheaded memorial |newspaper=The Economist |date= August 30, 2011|accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> Quarrying during earlier periods also destroyed several spectacular geological features on Stone Mountain, such as the Devil's Crossroads, which was located on top of the mountain.\n\t \nIn 1887 Stone Mountain was purchased for $45,000 by the Venable Brothers of Atlanta, who quarried the mountain for 24 more years, and descendants of the Venable family would retain ownership of the mountain until it was purchased by the State of Georgia in the 1950s.\n\n[[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] mentioned the monument in his 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech in Washington, D.C., when he said \"let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!\"<ref>{{cite web|last=King|first=Martin Luther, Jr|title=I have a Dream|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/mlk01.asp|publisher=Lillian Goldman Law Library|accessdate=8 October 2011|date=28 August 1963|quote=let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[1996 Summer Olympics]], Stone Mountain Park provided venues for Olympic events in tennis, [[Archery at the 1996 Summer Olympics|archery]] and [[Cycling at the 1996 Summer Olympics|track cycling]].<ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1996/1996v1.pdf 1996 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 1. p. 543.</ref><ref>[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1996/1996v3.pdf 1996 Summer Olympics official report.] Volume 3. pp. 448, 453.</ref> The venues for archery and cycling were temporary and are now part of the songbird and habitat trail.<ref>''Driving Map: Stone Mountain Park'' (2009).
