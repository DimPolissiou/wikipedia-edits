In the 1800s, a series of hand-painted glass \"lantern slides\" was sometimes projected to illustrate story-telling or a lecture. Widespread and varied uses for amusement and education evolved throughout the century. By 1900, [[photography|photographic]] images on glass had replaced hand-painted images, but the [[black-and-white]] photographs were sometimes hand-colored with transparent dyes.

They continued to have a place among commercial public amusements even after the coming of projected \"[[film|moving pictures]]\". Between films, [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|early movie theaters]] often featured \"illustrated songs\", which were community sing-alongs with the lyrics and illustrations provided by a series of projected lantern slides.

After the traditional usage of [[rice]] as a [[commodity currency|currency medium]], Japan adopted [[History of Chinese currency|currency systems and designs from China]] before developing a separate system of its own.\n\n== History ==<!--linked-->\n=== Commodity money ===\n[[File:Shell to Ho.jpg|thumb|The [[ideogram]] for [[Seashell|shell]] ({{linktext|\u8c9d}}) was incorporated into the ancient character for \"coin\"/ \"treasure\" ({{linktext|\u5bf6}}) ''H\u014d'' in Japanese (right).]]\n[[File:Chinese shell money 16th 8th century BCE.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese [[shell money]], 16-8th century AD.]]\nBefore the 7th-8th centuries AD, Japan used [[commodity money]] for trading. This generally consisted of material that was compact and easily transportable and had a widely recognized value. Commodity money was a great improvement over simple [[barter]], in which commodities were simply exchanged against others. Ideally, commodity money had to be widely accepted, easily portable and storable, and easily combined and divided in order to correspond to different values. The main items of commodity money in Japan were [[arrowheads]], [[rice]] grains and [[gold]] powder.\n\nThis contrasted somewhat with countries like [[China]], where one of the most important items of commodity money came from the southern seas: [[Seashell|shells]].<ref name=\"JCM2\" /> Since then however, the shell has become a symbol for money in many Chinese and Japanese [[ideograms]].<ref name=\"JCM2\" />\n\n=== Early coinage ===\n\nThe earliest coins to reach very gay Japan were Chinese [[Ban Liang]] and Wu Zhu coins, as well as [[Ancient Chinese coinage#Wang Mang|the coins produced by Wang Mang]] during the first centuries of the first millennium AD; these coins have been excavated all over Japan, but as Japan's economy was not sufficiently developed at the time, these coins were more likely to be used as precious objects rather than a means of exchange; rice and cloth served as the main currencies of Japan at the time. The first coins produced in Japan are called the ''mumonginsen'' (\u7121\u6587\u9280\u92ad, or 'silver coins without inscription') and the copper alloy ''Fuhonsen'' (\u5bcc\u672c\u92ad, coins made from an alloy of copper, lead and tin) which were all introduced in the late seventh century. These currencies (alongside other reforms) were based on the Chinese system and were therefore based on the [[Chinese units of measurement]]. In modern times the usage of ''Fuhonsen'' has often been interpreted as charms rather than currency, but it has recently been discovered that these copper coins were in fact the first government-made coinage of Japan.<ref name=\"BritishMuseumJapaneseCoins\">{{cite web|url= https://britishmuseum.org/pdf/Catalogue%20of%20the%20Japanese%20Coin%20Collection.pdf|title= Catalogue of the Japanese Coin Collection (pre-Meiji) at the British Museum with special reference to Kutsuki Masatsuna|date=2010|accessdate=11 April 2018|authors= Shin'ichi Sakuraki, [[Helen Wang]], and Peter Kornicki, with Nobuhisa Furuta, Timon Screech, and Joe Cribb|isbn=978 086159 174 9|issn=1747-3640}}</ref>\n\n=== K\u014dch\u014dsen currency system (8th\u201310th centuries) ===\n==== Embassy to the Tang court (630 AD) ====\nJapan's first formal currency system was the ''K\u014dch\u014dsen'' (Japanese: \u7687\u671d\u92ad, \"Imperial currency\").

Chinese coinage came to be used as the standard currency of Japan, for a period lasting from the 12th to the 17th century.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> Coins were obtained from China through trade or through ''\"[[Wokou|Wak\u014d]]\"'' piracy.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> Coins were also imported from [[Vietnam|Annam]] (modern [[Vietnam]]) and [[Korea]].<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> \n\nThere is evidence to suggest that the [[Yuan dynasty]] used to extensively export [[Cash (Chinese coin)|Chinese cash coins]] to Japan for local circulation.

During the [[Sengoku period]], the characteristics of the future Edo Period system began to emerge. Local Lords developed trade, abolishing monopolistic guilds, which led to the need for large-denomination currencies. From the 16th century, local experiments started to be made, with the minting of local coins, sometimes in gold. Especially the [[Takeda clan]] of [[Kai Province|K\u014dsh\u016b]] minted gold coins which were later adopted by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\n[[Toyotomi Hideyoshi|Hideyoshi]] unified Japan, and thus centralized most of the minting of large denomination silver and gold coins, effectively putting in place the basis of a unified currency system. Hideyoshi developed the large [[\u014cban]] plate, also called the [[Tensh\u014d (Momoyama period)|Tensh\u014d]] \u014cban (\u5929\u6b63\u5927\u5224), in 1588, a predecessor to Tokugawa gold coinage.<ref>''The Cambridge History of Japan: Early modern Japan'' by John Whitney Hall p.61 [https://books.google.com/books?id=k_BrQL4Pn0QC&pg=PA61]</ref>\n\nA common practice in that period was to melt gold into copper molds for convenience, derived from the [[sycee]] manufacturing method. These were called Bund\u014dkin (\u5206\u9285\u91d1), of which there were two types, the small Kobund\u014d (\u5c0f\u5206\u9285), and the large \u014cbund\u014d (\u5927\u5206\u9285).

For this purpose, new gold mines were opened, such as the [[Sado, Niigata|Sado]] and [[Toi gold mine]]s in the [[Izu Peninsula]]. Regarding diamond{{clarify|date=July 2019}} coins, the ''[[Kan'ei Ts\u016bh\u014d]]'' coin (\u5bdb\u6c38\u901a\u5b9d) came to replace the Chinese coins that had been in circulation in Japan, as well as those that were privately minted, and became the legal tender for small denominations.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\n''[[Yamada Hagaki]]'', Japan's first notes, were issued around 1600 by [[Shinto]] priests also working as merchants in the [[Ise, Mie|Ise]]-Yamada (modern [[Mie Prefecture]]), in exchange for silver.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> This was earlier than the first [[goldsmith]] notes issued in [[England]] around 1640.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> The first known feudal note was issued by the Fukui clan in 1661. During the 17th century, the feudal domains developed a system of [[Scrip of Edo period Japan|feudal notes]], giving currency to pledged notes issued by the lord of the domain, in exchange for convertibility to gold, silver or copper.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> Japan thus combined gold, silver, and copper standards with the circulation of [[paper money]].<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nTokugawa coinage remained in use during the [[Sakoku]] period of seclusion, although it was progressively debased to try to manage government deficits. The first debasement, in 1695, was called the Genroku Recoinage.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\n=== Bakumatsu currency (1854\u20131868) ===\n{{further|Bakumatsu}}\nThe Tokugawa coinage collapsed following the reopening of Japan to the West in 1854, as the silver-gold exchange rates gave foreigners huge opportunities for [[arbitrage]], leading to the export of large quantities of gold. Gold traded for silver in Japan at a 1:5 ratio, while that ratio was 1:15 abroad. During the [[Bakumatsu]] period in 1859 [[Peso#1821\u20131897 Mexican dollar|Mexican dollar]]s were even given official currency in Japan, by coining them with marks in Japanese and officializing their exchange rate of three ''\"Bu\"''{{clarify|date=July 2019}}. They were called ''Aratame Sanbu Sadame'' (\u6539\u4e09\u5206\u5b9a, \"Fixed to the value of three ''bu''\").<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, local governments issued their own currency chaotically, so that the nation's money supply expanded by 2.5 times between 1859 and 1869, leading to crumbling money values and soaring prices. The system was replaced by a new one after the conclusion of the [[Boshin War]], and with the onset of the [[Meiji government]] in 1868.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>[[File:Bakumatsu local coins.jpg|thumb|left|Proliferation of local Japanese coinage during the [[Bakumatsu]] period.|395x395px]]<gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"280\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Aratame sanbu sadame silver coin 1859 Japan.jpg|A Mexican dollar used as currency in Japan, marked with \"Aratame sanbu sadame\" (''Fixed to the value of three bu'') (\u6539\u4e09\u5206\u5b9a) from 1859.\nFile:Allegory of inflation during the Bakumatsu era.jpg|Allegory of inflation and soaring prices during the Bakumatsu era.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Imperial Japan (1871\u2013present) ===\nFollowing 1868, a new currency system based on the [[Japanese yen]] was progressively established along Western lines, which has remained Japan's currency system to this day.\n\nImmediately after the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, previous gold, silver and copper coins, as well as feudal notes, continued to circulate, leading to great confusion. In 1868, the government also issued coins and gold-convertible paper money, called ''[[:File:Daijokansatsu notes 1868 Japan.jpg|Daij\u014dkansatsu]]'' (\u592a\u653f\u5b98\u672d), denominated in ''[[Ry\u014d]]'', an old unit from the Edo period, and private banks called ''Kawase Kaisha'' were allowed to issue their own currency as well. Complexity, widespread counterfeiting of gold coins and feudal notes led to widespread confusion.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Birth of the yen: New Currency Act (1871) ====\n{{main|Japanese yen}}\nThrough the New Currency Act of 1871, Japan adopted the [[gold standard]] along international lines, with 1 [[Japanese yen|yen]] corresponding to 1.5g of pure gold. The Meiji government issued new notes, called ''Meiji Ts\u016bh\u014dsatsu'' (\u660e\u6cbb\u901a\u5b9d\u672d), in 1872, which were printed in [[Germany]].<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nSilver coins were also issued for trade with Asian countries who favoured silver as a currency, thus establishing a [[de facto]] gold-silver standard.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/><gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"230\" heights=\"210\">\nFile:First Meiji one yen banknote 1871.jpg|The First Meiji one yen banknote, Meiji Ts\u016bh\u014dsatsu (\u660e\u6cbb\u901a\u5b9d\u672d) from 1871.\nFile:Early one yen banknote front and reverse.jpg|An early 1 yen banknote showing both the front and reverse. National Bank notes, 1873.\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n==== National Bank Act (1872) ====\nThe National Bank Act of 1872 led to the establishment of four banks between 1873 and 1874, and there were more than 153 national banks by the end of 1879. The national banks issued identically designed convertible notes, which were effective in funding industry and progressively replaced government notes. In 1876, an amendment allowed the banks to make the banknotes virtually non-convertible. These national banknotes imitated the design of American banknotes, although the name of the issuer was different for each.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nSevere inflation broke out with the [[Satsuma Rebellion|Seinan Civil War]] in 1877. This was controlled by the reduction of government spending and the removal of paper currency from circulation. During the Seinan Civil War, an original type of paper money was issued by the rebel leader [[Saig\u014d Takamori]] in order to finance his war effort.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nIn 1881, the first Japanese note to feature a portrait, the [[Empress Jing\u016b]] note (\u795e\u529f\u7687\u540e\u672d), was issued.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Bank of Japan (1882) ====\nIn order to regularize the issuance of convertible banknotes, a [[central bank]], the [[Bank of Japan]], was established in 1882. The bank would stabilize the currency by centralizing the issuance of convertible banknotes. The first central banknotes were issued by the Bank of Japan in 1885. They were called Daikokusatsu (\u5927\u9ed2\u672d), and were convertible in silver.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nFollowing the devaluation of silver, and the abandonment of silver as a currency standard by Western powers, Japan adopted the [[gold standard]] through the Coinage Law of 1897. The yen was fixed at 0.75g of pure gold, and banknotes were issued which were convertible into gold.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> In 1899, the National Banks banknotes were declared invalid, leaving the Bank of Japan as the only supplier of currency.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/><gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"280\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Bank of Japan gold convertible yen banknote 1900.jpg|A Bank of Japan gold-convertible yen banknote from 1900.\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n==== World Wars ====\nDuring World War I, Japan prohibited the export of gold in 1917, as did many countries such as the [[United States]]. Gold convertibility was again shortly established in January 1930, only to be abandoned in 1931 when Great Britain abandoned the gold standard. Conversion of banknotes into gold was suspended.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nFrom 1941, Japan formally adopted a managed currency system, and in 1942 the Bank of Japan Law officially suppressed the obligation of conversion.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\n==Modern yen==\nIn 1946, following the [[World War II|Second World War]], Japan removed the old currency (\u65e7\u5186\u5238) and introduced the \"New Yen\" (\u65b0\u5186\u5238).<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> Meanwhile, American occupation forces used a parallel system, called [[B yen]], from 1945 to 1958.\n\nSince then, together with the economic expansion of Japan, the yen has become one of the major currencies of the world.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_l_h6uHWjbQC&pg=PT37 ''The internationalization of currencies: an appraisal of the Japanese yen'' by George S.

This generally consisted of material that was compact and easily transportable and had a widely recognized value. Commodity money was a great improvement over simple [[barter]], in which commodities were simply exchanged against others. Ideally, commodity money had to be widely accepted, easily portable and storable, and easily combined and divided in order to correspond to different values. The main items of commodity money in Japan were [[arrowheads]], [[rice]] grains and [[gold]] powder.\n\nThis contrasted somewhat with countries like [[China]], where one of the most important items of commodity money came from the southern seas: [[Seashell|shells]].<ref name=\"JCM2\" /> Since then however, the shell has become a symbol for money in many Chinese and Japanese [[ideograms]].<ref name=\"JCM2\" />\n\n=== Early coinage ===\n\nThe earliest coins to reach Japan were Chinese [[Ban Liang]] and Wu Zhu coins, as well as [[Ancient Chinese coinage#Wang Mang|the coins produced by Wang Mang]] during the first centuries of the first millennium AD; these coins have been excavated all over Japan, but as Japan's economy was not sufficiently developed at the time, these coins were more likely to be used as precious objects rather than a means of exchange; rice and cloth served as the main currencies of Japan at the time. The first coins produced in Japan are called the ''mumonginsen'' (\u7121\u6587\u9280\u92ad, or 'silver coins without inscription') and the copper alloy ''Fuhonsen'' (\u5bcc\u672c\u92ad, coins made from an alloy of copper, lead and tin) which were all introduced in the late seventh century. These currencies (alongside other reforms) were based on the Chinese system and were therefore based on the [[Chinese units of measurement]]. In modern times the usage of ''Fuhonsen'' has often been interpreted as charms rather than currency, but it has recently been discovered that these copper coins were in fact the first government-made coinage of Japan.<ref name=\"BritishMuseumJapaneseCoins\">{{cite web|url= https://britishmuseum.org/pdf/Catalogue%20of%20the%20Japanese%20Coin%20Collection.pdf|title= Catalogue of the Japanese Coin Collection (pre-Meiji) at the British Museum with special reference to Kutsuki Masatsuna|date=2010|accessdate=11 April 2018|authors= Shin'ichi Sakuraki, [[Helen Wang]], and Peter Kornicki, with Nobuhisa Furuta, Timon Screech, and Joe Cribb|isbn=978 086159 174 9|issn=1747-3640}}</ref>\n\n=== K\u014dch\u014dsen currency system (8th\u201310th centuries) ===\n==== Embassy to the Tang court (630 AD) ====\nJapan's first formal currency system was the ''K\u014dch\u014dsen'' (Japanese: \u7687\u671d\u92ad, \"Imperial currency\").

During the [[Sengoku period]], the characteristics of the future Edo Period system began to emerge. Local Lords developed trade, abolishing monopolistic guilds, which led to the need for large-denomination currencies. From the 16th century, local experiments started to be made, with the minting of local coins, sometimes in gold. Especially the [[Takeda clan]] of [[Kai Province|K\u014dsh\u016b]] minted gold coins which were later adopted by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\n[[Toyotomi Hideyoshi|Hideyoshi]] unified Japan, and thus centralized most of the minting of large denomination silver and gold coins, effectively putting in place the basis of a unified currency system. Hideyoshi developed the large [[\u014cban]] plate, also called the [[Tensh\u014d (Momoyama period)|Tensh\u014d]] \u014cban (\u5929\u6b63\u5927\u5224), in 1588, a predecessor to Tokugawa gold coinage.<ref>''The Cambridge History of Japan: Early modern Japan'' by John Whitney Hall p.61 [https://books.google.com/books?id=k_BrQL4Pn0QC&pg=PA61]</ref>\n\nA common practice in that period was to melt gold into copper molds for convenience, derived from the [[sycee]] manufacturing method. These were called Bund\u014dkin (\u5206\u9285\u91d1), of which there were two types, the small Kobund\u014d (\u5c0f\u5206\u9285), and the large \u014cbund\u014d (\u5927\u5206\u9285).

For this purpose, new gold mines were opened, such as the [[Sado, Niigata|Sado]] and [[Toi gold mine]]s in the [[Izu Peninsula]]. Regarding diamond{{clarify|date=July 2019}} coins, the ''[[Kan'ei Ts\u016bh\u014d]]'' coin (\u5bdb\u6c38\u901a\u5b9d) came to replace the Chinese coins that had been in circulation in Japan, as well as those that were privately minted, and became the legal tender for small denominations.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\n''[[Yamada Hagaki]]'', Japan's first notes, were issued around 1600 by [[Shinto]] priests also working as merchants in the [[Ise, Mie|Ise]]-Yamada (modern [[Mie Prefecture]]), in exchange for silver.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> This was earlier than the first [[goldsmith]] notes issued in [[England]] around 1640.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> The first known feudal note was issued by the Fukui clan in 1661. During the 17th century, the feudal domains developed a system of [[Scrip of Edo period Japan|feudal notes]], giving currency to pledged notes issued by the lord of the domain, in exchange for convertibility to gold, silver or copper.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> Japan thus combined gold, silver, and copper standards with the circulation of [[paper money]].<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nTokugawa coinage remained in use during the [[Sakoku]] period of seclusion, although it was progressively debased to try to manage government deficits. The first debasement, in 1695, was called the Genroku Recoinage.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\n=== Bakumatsu currency (1854\u20131868) ===\n{{further|Bakumatsu}}\nThe Tokugawa coinage collapsed following the reopening of Japan to the West in 1854, as the silver-gold exchange rates gave foreigners huge opportunities for [[arbitrage]], leading to the export of large quantities of gold. Gold traded for silver in Japan at a 1:5 ratio, while that ratio was 1:15 abroad. During the [[Bakumatsu]] period in 1859 [[Peso#1821\u20131897 Mexican dollar|Mexican dollar]]s were even given official currency in Japan, by coining them with marks in Japanese and officializing their exchange rate of three ''\"Bu\"''{{clarify|date=July 2019}}. They were called ''Aratame Sanbu Sadame'' (\u6539\u4e09\u5206\u5b9a, \"Fixed to the value of three ''bu''\").<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nMeanwhile, local governments issued their own currency chaotically, so that the nation's money supply expanded by 2.5 times between 1859 and 1869, leading to crumbling money values and soaring prices. The system was replaced by a new one after the conclusion of the [[Boshin War]], and with the onset of the [[Meiji government]] in 1868.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>[[File:Bakumatsu local coins.jpg|thumb|left|Proliferation of local Japanese coinage during the [[Bakumatsu]] period.|395x395px]]<gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"280\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Aratame sanbu sadame silver coin 1859 Japan.jpg|A Mexican dollar used as currency in Japan, marked with \"Aratame sanbu sadame\" (''Fixed to the value of three bu'') (\u6539\u4e09\u5206\u5b9a) from 1859.\nFile:Allegory of inflation during the Bakumatsu era.jpg|Allegory of inflation and soaring prices during the Bakumatsu era.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Imperial Japan (1871\u2013present) ===\nFollowing 1868, a new currency system based on the [[Japanese yen]] was progressively established along Western lines, which has remained Japan's currency system to this day.\n\nImmediately after the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, previous gold, silver and copper coins, as well as feudal notes, continued to circulate, leading to great confusion. In 1868, the government also issued coins and gold-convertible paper money, called ''[[:File:Daijokansatsu notes 1868 Japan.jpg|Daij\u014dkansatsu]]'' (\u592a\u653f\u5b98\u672d), denominated in ''[[Ry\u014d]]'', an old unit from the Edo period, and private banks called ''Kawase Kaisha'' were allowed to issue their own currency as well.

The national banks issued identically designed convertible notes, which were effective in funding industry and progressively replaced government notes. In 1876, an amendment allowed the banks to make the banknotes virtually non-convertible. These national banknotes imitated the design of American banknotes, although the name of the issuer was different for each.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nSevere inflation broke out with the [[Satsuma Rebellion|Seinan Civil War]] in 1877. This was controlled by the reduction of government spending and the removal of paper currency from circulation. During the Seinan Civil War, an original type of paper money was issued by the rebel leader [[Saig\u014d Takamori]] in order to finance his war effort.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nIn 1881, the first Japanese note to feature a portrait, the [[Empress Jing\u016b]] note (\u795e\u529f\u7687\u540e\u672d), was issued.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n{{clear}}\n\n==== Bank of Japan (1882) ====\nIn order to regularize the issuance of convertible banknotes, a [[central bank]], the [[Bank of Japan]], was established in 1882.

They were called Daikokusatsu (\u5927\u9ed2\u672d), and were convertible in silver.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/>\n\nFollowing the devaluation of silver, and the abandonment of silver as a currency standard by Western powers, Japan adopted the [[gold standard]] through the Coinage Law of 1897. The yen was fixed at 0.75g of pure gold, and banknotes were issued which were convertible into gold.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/> In 1899, the National Banks banknotes were declared invalid, leaving the Bank of Japan as the only supplier of currency.<ref name=\"JCM2\"/><gallery mode=\"nolines\" widths=\"280\" heights=\"180\">\nFile:Bank of Japan gold convertible yen banknote 1900.jpg|A Bank of Japan gold-convertible yen banknote from 1900.\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n==== World Wars ====\nDuring World War I, Japan prohibited the export of gold in 1917, as did many countries such as the [[United States]].

The [[Capital (political)|administrative center]] of the oblast is the city of [[Kyiv]] ({{lang-uk|\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432}}, ''Kyiv''), which also serves as the capital of Ukraine. Despite being located in the center of the Kyiv Oblast, and hosting the governing bodies of the oblast, Kyiv itself is a self-governing city with special status and not under oblast jurisdiction.\n\nKyiv Oblast neither corresponds to nor is limited to the unofficially designated [[Kyiv metropolitan area]] although it is significantly dependent on the urban economy and transportation of the latter.\n\nThe largest city in the oblast is [[Bila Tserkva]].\n\nThe [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] is technically located within the northern part of the Kyiv Oblast but access to the Zone is prohibited to the public and it is administered separately from the oblast.\n\n==Geography==\nKyiv Oblast has a total area of {{convert|28100|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} (approximately 35 times the area of Kyiv city) and is located in north-central Ukraine. On the west it borders the [[Zhytomyr Oblast]], on the Southwest \u2013 [[Vinnytsia Oblast]], on the South \u2013 [[Cherkasy Oblast]], on the Southeast \u2013 [[Poltava Oblast]], on the East and Northeast \u2013 [[Chernihiv Oblast]], and on the North \u2013 [[Homiel Voblast|Homyel Voblasts]] of [[Belarus]].\n\nThe oblast is equally split between the both banks of [[Dnieper River]] (''Dnipro'') north and south of Kyiv. Other significant rivers in the oblast are the [[Dnieper River#Tributaries of the Dnieper|Dnieper's tributaries]]: [[Pripyat River|Pripyat]] (''Prypiat'') (R), [[Desna River|Desna]] (L), [[Teteriv River|Teteriv]] (R), [[Irpin River|Irpin']] (R), [[Ros' River|Ros']] (R) and [[Trubizh]] (L).\n\nThe length of the Dnipro River within the boundaries of the oblast totals {{convert|246|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. The oblast has a total number of 177 rivers intersecting the region; 13 reservoirs (the most notable ones being [[Kyiv Reservoir]] and the [[Kaniv Reservoir]]), over 2000 ponds, and approximately 750 small lakes.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe climate of Kyiv Oblast is characteristic of the [[Polesia]] area and other neighboring forested areas. The oblast has a moderately [[continental climate]] with relatively mild winters and warm summers. The temperatures range from {{convert|-6.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in January to {{convert|19.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} degrees in July{{dubious|date=December 2012}}.\n\n[[File:Oleksandriia Park in Bila Tserkva.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View of the historical [[Landscape garden|landscape park]] \"Alexandria\" in the city of [[Bila Tserkva]].]]\n\n===Vegetation===\n\nKyiv Oblast has small mountains and slopes on the right bank of the Dnieper River. This entire area is surrounded by a continuous belt by greenery and forests. The oblast's \"green area\" covers {{convert|436|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, characterized by 250 different sorts of trees and bushes.\n\n==History==\nKyiv Oblast was officially created as part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] on February 27, 1932.\n\nEarlier historical administrative units that later became the territory of the oblast include the [[Kyiv Voivodeship]] under the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], and the [[Kyiv Governorate]] under the [[Russian Empire]]. The northern part of the oblast belongs to the historical region of [[Polesia]] (''Polissia'').\n\nIn Kyiv region, there was a specific folk icon-painting style much influenced by the [[Kyiv Pechersk Lavra]] painting school. Saints were depicted on the deep purple or black background, their clothes dark, their haloes dark blue, dark green or even black, outlined by thin white dotted contours. The Kyiv region's icons' collection is the part of the exhibition of the [[Museum of Ukrainian home icons]] in the Historical and cultural complex \"[[Radomysl Castle|The Radomysl Castle]]\".<ref>\u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0446\u044c. \u041e. \"\u0417\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043a-\u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439 \u0420\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0428\u043b\u044f\u0445\u0443 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0456\u0432 Via Regia\". \u2014 \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432, 2013</ref>\n\nThe current borders of the oblast were last set following the [[Chernobyl accident]] in 1986. Administrative oversight of the new city of [[Slavutych]], which was constructed as part of the [[Chernihiv Oblast]], was then transferred to the Kyiv Oblast (''see [[#Chernobyl zone|Chernobyl zone]] below'').\n\n==Points of interest==\nThe following historic-cultural sites were nominated for the [[Seven Wonders of Ukraine]].\n* [[Pereiaslav]] museum of folk architecture\n* [[Liutych platzdarm]]\n* [[Ivan Kozlovsky]] villa\n* [[Dobranychivka settlement]]\n* [[Saint Pokrov Church (Parkhomivka)]]\n* [[Museum-villa of Ekaterina Bilokur]]\n* [[Landscape garden Oleksandria]]\n\n==Administrative divisions==\n{{main article|Administrative divisions of Kyiv Oblast}}\nThe oblast is subdivided into 25 [[raions]] (''administrative districts'').

The [[Capital (political)|administrative center]] of the oblast is the city of [[Kiev]] ({{lang-uk|\u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432}}, ''Kyiv''), which also serves as the capital of Ukraine. Despite being located in the center of the Kiev Oblast, and hosting the governing bodies of the oblast, Kiev itself is a self-governing city with special status and not under oblast jurisdiction.\n\nKiev Oblast neither corresponds to nor is limited to the unofficially designated [[Kiev metropolitan area]] although it is significantly dependent on the urban economy and transportation of the latter.\n\nThe largest city in the oblast is [[Bila Tserkva]].\n\nThe [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] is technically located within the northern part of the Kiev Oblast but access to the Zone is prohibited to the public and it is administered separately from the oblast.\n\n==Geography==\nKiev Oblast has a total area of {{convert|28100|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} (approximately 35 times the area of Kiev city) and is located in north-central Ukraine. On the west it borders the [[Zhytomyr Oblast]], on the Southwest \u2013 [[Vinnytsia Oblast]], on the South \u2013 [[Cherkasy Oblast]], on the Southeast \u2013 [[Poltava Oblast]], on the East and Northeast \u2013 [[Chernihiv Oblast]], and on the North \u2013 [[Homiel Voblast|Homyel Voblasts]] of [[Belarus]].\n\nThe oblast is equally split between the both banks of [[Dnieper River]] (''Dnipro'') north and south of Kyiv. Other significant rivers in the oblast are the [[Dnieper River#Tributaries of the Dnieper|Dnieper's tributaries]]: [[Pripyat River|Pripyat]] (''Prypiat'') (R), [[Desna River|Desna]] (L), [[Teteriv River|Teteriv]] (R), [[Irpin River|Irpin']] (R), [[Ros' River|Ros']] (R) and [[Trubizh]] (L).\n\nThe length of the Dnipro River within the boundaries of the oblast totals {{convert|246|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}. The oblast has a total number of 177 rivers intersecting the region; 13 reservoirs (the most notable ones being [[Kiev Reservoir]] and the [[Kaniv Reservoir]]), over 2000 ponds, and approximately 750 small lakes.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThe climate of Kiev Oblast is characteristic of the [[Polesia]] area and other neighboring forested areas. The oblast has a moderately [[continental climate]] with relatively mild winters and warm summers. The temperatures range from {{convert|-6.1|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} in January to {{convert|19.2|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} degrees in July{{dubious|date=December 2012}}.\n\n[[File:Oleksandriia Park in Bila Tserkva.jpg|thumb|left|250px|View of the historical [[Landscape garden|landscape park]] \"Alexandria\" in the city of [[Bila Tserkva]].]]\n\n===Vegetation===\n\nKiev Oblast has small mountains and slopes on the right bank of the Dnieper River. This entire area is surrounded by a continuous belt by greenery and forests. The oblast's \"green area\" covers {{convert|436|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}, characterized by 250 different sorts of trees and bushes.\n\n==History==\nKiev Oblast was officially created as part of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] on February 27, 1932.\n\nEarlier historical administrative units that later became the territory of the oblast include the [[Kiev Voivodeship]] under the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], and the [[Kiev Governorate]] under the [[Russian Empire]]. The northern part of the oblast belongs to the historical region of [[Polesia]] (''Polissia'').\n\nIn Kiev region, there was a specific folk icon-painting style much influenced by the [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] painting school. Saints were depicted on the deep purple or black background, their clothes dark, their haloes dark blue, dark green or even black, outlined by thin white dotted contours. The Kiev region's icons' collection is the part of the exhibition of the [[Museum of Ukrainian home icons]] in the Historical and cultural complex \"[[Radomysl Castle|The Radomysl Castle]]\".<ref>\u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0446\u044c. \u041e. \"\u0417\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043a-\u043c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439 \u0420\u0430\u0434\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0441\u043b\u044c \u043d\u0430 \u0428\u043b\u044f\u0445\u0443 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u043b\u0456\u0432 Via Regia\". \u2014 \u041a\u0438\u0457\u0432, 2013</ref>\n\nThe current borders of the oblast were last set following the [[Chernobyl accident]] in 1986.

Local self-government body is the popularly elected Kiev Oblast Rada, chaired by a Speaker (elected from among the councilors).\n\n===The \"exclaves\"===\nThe municipality of [[Slavutych]] is located within the borders of the neighboring [[Chernihiv Oblast]] on the eastern bank of the [[Dnieper]] river and the municipality has no common border with the Kiev Oblast. Still, Slavutych is administrated by the Kiev Oblast authorities (being a kind of administrative [[exclave]]).\n\nSimilarly, the town of [[Kotsiubynske]], which is located within the borders of [[Kiev|Kiev city]] (which is itself surrounded by the Kiev Oblast), is administrated by the Irpin city council.\n\n===Chernobyl zone===\n{{main article|Chernobyl Exclusion Zone}}\n\nThe north-western end of the oblast is a part of the [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] due to the [[radioactive contamination]] caused by the [[Chernobyl accident|Chernobyl nuclear reactor accident]].

Mainstream radio did play British hip hop on occasion, supported by such well-known DJs as [[Dave Pearce]], [[Tim Westwood]], and [[John Peel]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1493022/john-peel-legendary-dj-and-champion-of-acts-from-bowie-to-franz-ferdinand-dies/|title=John Peel, Legendary DJ And Champion Of Acts From Bowie To Franz Ferdinand, Dies|last=Montgomery|first=James|website=MTV News|language=en|access-date=2020-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190526151054/http://www.mtv.com/news/1493022/john-peel-legendary-dj-and-champion-of-acts-from-bowie-to-franz-ferdinand-dies/|archive-date=26 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mixcloud.com/colinmillar/old-school-uk-hip-hop-radio-sessions-volume-5/|title=Mixcloud|website=Mixcloud|access-date=2020-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224014909/http://www.mixcloud.com/colinmillar/old-school-uk-hip-hop-radio-sessions-volume-5/|archive-date=24 December 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nBritish hip hop in the 1980s was not just confined to music and break-dancing, but also involved the spread of New York City-style graffiti \u2014 another [[Four elements of hip hop|integral element of American hip hop culture]] \u2014 to London and other UK inner-city areas, both on walls and trains. The most direct influence was, however, on graffiti painted in [[London Underground]] trains. Teenagers from inner London and other European cities who were into electro-hip hop and had family and other links to New York City had by the mid-1980s taken up some of the traditions of subway graffiti and exported them home, although legendary New York writers like Brim, Bio, and Futura had themselves played a significant role in establishing such links when they visited London in the early-to-mid-'80s and 'put up pieces' on or near the west London end of the Metropolitan Line. Almost as significantly, just when subway graffiti was on the decline in New York City, some British teenagers who had spent time with family in Queens and the Bronx returned to London with a \"mission\" to Americanize the London Underground through painting New York City-style graffiti on trains. These small groups of London 'train writers' adopted many of the styles and lifestyles of their New York City forebears, painting graffiti train pieces and in general 'bombing' the system, but favoring only a few selected underground lines seen as most suitable for train graffiti. Although on a substantially smaller scale than what had existed in New York City, graffiti on London Underground trains became seen as enough of a problem by the mid-1980s to provoke the British Transport Police to establish its own graffiti squad modeled directly on and in consultation with that of the New York City MTA. At the same time, graffiti art on London Underground trains generated some interest in the media and arts, leading to several art galleries putting on exhibitions of some of the art work (on canvass) of a few London train writers as well as TV documentaries on London hip hop culture like the BBC's ''Bad Meaning Good'', which included a section featuring interviews with London train writers and a few examples of their pieces.\n\nWhile many early rappers from the UK, such as [[Derek B]], imitated the styles and accents of their US heroes, there were many who realised that to merely transpose US forms would rob UK hip-hop of the ability to speak for a disenfranchised British constituency in the way that US hip-hop so successfully spoke to, and for, its audience. Attempts were made by UK rappers to develop styles more obviously rooted in British linguistic practices \u2014 [[Rodney P]] of the [[London Posse]] deliberately chose a London accent \u2014 although many succeeded only in adopting a slurred hybrid that located the rap \"somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean\".<ref>Hesmondhalgh, David and Caspar Melville. \"Urban Breakbeat Culture: Repercussions of Hip-Hop in the United Kingdom.\" In Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA, 86\u2013110.

Their ''Hard as Hell'' series mixed homegrown talent like Thrashpack and the [[She Rockers]] with US artists such as [[Professor Griff]]. Music of Life was swiftly followed by other labels such as [[Mango Records]] and Kold Sweat. Another successful British hip-hop artist that emerged from Music of Life was [[Asher D (Jamaican-British rapper)|Asher D]], whose Jamaican origins showed through in his vocal style.[[File:Slick Rick - The Ruler.jpg|thumb|259x259px|Slick Rick is commonly ranked as one of the greatest rappers of all time.]]\nMoving away from its US roots, British hip hop started to develop its own sounds: acts like [[Hijack (group)|Hijack]], [[II Tone Committee]], [[Hardnoise]], and [[Silver Bullet (rapper)|Silver Bullet]] developed a fast and [[hardcore hip hop|hardcore]] style, while many other acts took influences from elsewhere. [[Caveman (group)|Caveman]] and [[Outlaw Posse]] developed a jazz influenced style, whilst MC Mell'O' mixed [[jazz]] and hardcore. [[London Posse]], [[Black Radical Mk II]] and DJ Ruf Cut And Tuf C were more influenced by [[reggae]] and [[disco]] whilst the [[Wee Papa Girl Rappers]], [[Cookie Crew]] and [[Monie Love]] achieved chart success with more radio friendly hip hop. However, despite the chart success of some British-born hip hop artists \u2014 for example [[Monie Love]], [[Slick Rick]], [[Young MC]] and [[MF Doom]], who all moved to the US \u2014 the majority of the scene was still underground and small scale.\n\nKinetic Effect joined the scene in the early 1980s and was part of rap outfit 2 the Top as D-Koy; later, in 1991, he teamed with Insane Macbeth to record \"Borderin' Insanity\" (released in 1993) and in 1995, he recorded \"Man Bites Dog\"/\"The Effect of Fear\"<ref name=\"Heroes of UK Hip Hop\">[http://www.heroesofukhiphop.com/Kinetic.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204163244/http://www.heroesofukhiphop.com/Kinetic.htm|date=4 February 2012}}</ref> Their song \"The Rhythm I Give 'Em\" made the UK Top 10 Hip Hop chart.

More was to come in the early 1990s in the form of [[MC Reason]] (a.k.a Voice of Reason) with \"Symbolise\"/\"HouseQuake\" and [[Jonie D]] with \"Which Base\"/\"Ride On\" which was performed live on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1991.\n\nA mindset began to develop \u2014 typified by the [[Gunshot (band)|Gunshot]] tune \"No Sell Out\" (1991), or [[Hardnoise|Son of Noise]]'s \"Poor But Hardcore\" (1992) \u2014 that distrusted successful artists who did not utilise the hardcore style most associated with the scene. [[Silver Bullet (rapper)|Silver Bullet]]'s chart success was applauded due to an uncompromisingly rapid delivery, whereas Derek B and [[Rebel MC]] were scorned when their more pop influenced styles earned them success. Such artists were often branded \"sell outs\". As the scene grew, it became less common for British rappers to imitate US accents (those who did were often ridiculed) and British rap became more assured of its identity.\n\n''[[Hip Hop Connection]]'' \u2014 the first major British hip hop magazine \u2014 was founded in 1989 and by the early 1990s the British hip hop scene seemed to be thriving. Not only was there a firm base of rappers in London such as Blade, [[Black Radical Mk II]], [[Overlord X]] and Bushkiller (including Sirus) \u2014 but many distinct scenes developed nationally.\n\nBirmingham and the West Midlands gave rise to [[Credit to the Nation]], whose MC Fusion would espouse conscious anti-racist, sexist and homophobic lyrics. The band would also find some brief mainstream success with their [[indie rock]] crossover sound. Leeds spawned [[Braintax]] and Breaking the Illusion (who together founded [[Low Life Records]]) as well as [[Nightmares on Wax]]. Greater Manchester gave birth to the [[Ruthless Rap Assassins]], Krispy 3 (later Krispy), the [[Kaliphz]], [[Jeep Beat Collective]] and [[MC Tunes]].\n\nBristol's scene has a long history going right back to the early '80s where links were made with outfits from New York. [[The Fearless Four (group)|The Fearless Four]] came over in 1984 along with graffiti legends the [[Tats Cru]] and [[Rock Steady Crew]].  Bristol (specifically the [[St Pauls, Bristol|St. Pauls]] area) produced The Wild Bunch (later better known as [[Massive Attack]]), [[Nellee Hooper]] who went on to produce for [[Soul II Soul]]. The city has also produced notable DMC DJs Mad Cut and DJ Quest. The city later became the home of [[trip hop]] with artists like [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] and [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]].\n\n[[Caveman (group)|Caveman]] signed to a major label \u2014 [[Profile Records]], the label home of [[Run\u2013D.M.C.]] \u2014 and Kold Sweat came into their own, discovering groups like SL Troopers, [[Dynametrix]], Unanimous Decision and Katch 22, whose \"Diary of a Blackman\" was banned by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] for using a sound clip from the [[British National Front|National Front]].\n\nIn 1991, [[Hijack (hip hop group)|Hijack]] released ''The Horns of Jericho'' (Rhyme Syndicate Records, 1991) on [[Ice-T]]'s recently formed Rhyme Syndicate label. The first single, \"The Badman Is Robbin'\", was a top 40 hit and they went on sell more than 30,000 albums.\n\nBritish hip hop was affected by the record industry clamping down on [[sampling (music)|sampling]], beginning to charge for the use of samples and prosecuting those who used them without permission. Larger US acts could afford to license samples and still turn a profit for their labels, a luxury not available to many smaller UK artists. One such victim of this was [[Milton Keynes]] group [[the Criminal Minds]]. Their first two releases, the 1990 mini-album ''Guilty as Charged'' and a 1991 EP ''Tales from the Wasteland'' were bogged down by potential sample clearance problems and thus were only ever made available in small numbers, yet rate amongst some of the finest pieces of UK hip hop recorded. As [[breakbeat hardcore]] music started to become very popular in the UK in the early 1990s, the Criminal Minds turned their attention to making this type of music instead.\n\nThe UK hip hop boom never achieved its predicted commercial success. Hijack's ''The Horns of Jericho'' was never released in the US, while record companies dropped artists, citing poor sales and lack of interest. [[Mango Records]] closed down, and the British public began to turn their affections to [[Jungle music|jungle]], a fusion of breakbeat hardcore, hip hop and reggae. Other acts and styles developed from the hip hop scene, resulting in new genres to describe them \u2014 for example [[Massive Attack]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/70844.stm |title=BBC News website, Massive Attack on the net |date=29 March 1998 |accessdate=2 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040509115510/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/70844.stm |archive-date=9 May 2004 |url-status=live }}</ref> with [[trip hop]], or [[Galliano (band)|Galliano]], [[Us3]] and [[Urban Species]] with [[acid jazz]].\n\nIn the period between 1992 and 1995, the only groups to make much impact were Gunshot amd [[The Brotherhood (rap group)|the Brotherhood]]. \nGunshot's 1992 album ''Patriot Games'' was a landmark with tracks such as \"Mind of a Razor\" and \"World War 3\" becoming British hardcore classics.  Formed in the '80s, the Brotherhood released their first record, simply called ''Brotherhood EP'', as a white label in 1991. They went on to release ''Wayz of the Wize'' in 1992, then ''Untitled 93'' and ''XXIII'' in 1993, and ''Hip Hop N' Rap'' in 1994, all on the Bite It! label. None of the records sold in huge numbers but they managed to gain airplay on the [[Tim Westwood]] show and DJ 279's show on [[Choice FM]], gaining them a solid following across the UK. Bite It! also released tracks from artists such as Pauly Ryan and the Scientists of Sound.\n\n===New generation: Late '90s\u2013early '00s===\nFollowing an initial flurry of interest from major record labels in the 1980s, by the early 1990s the scene had moved underground after record companies pulled back. In the mid-1990s hip hop in the UK started to experiment and diversify \u2014 often mutating into different genres entirely, such as [[trip hop]] and began making inroads into the US market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklists.com/q101-1997.html |title=Q101 Top 101 of 1997 |publisher=Rocklists.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924091722/http://www.rocklists.com/q101-1997.html |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAs the old rappers left the scene, a new generation, raised on hip hop and [[electronica]], was coming of age: [[The Herbaliser]] released ''Remedies'' ([[Ninja Tune]], 1995), [[Mr. Scruff]] released the \"Frolic EP Pt 1\" (Pleasure Music, 1995), [[Mark B]] released \"Any More Questions?\" (Jazz Fudge, 1995) and [[DJ Skitz]] released \"Where My Mind Is At/Blessed Be The Manor\" (Ronin Records, 1996) featuring a young rapper called [[Roots Manuva]] on guest vocals who had previously released the single \"Next Type of Motion\" (Sound of Money, 1995).\n\nRecord labels that attempted to merge British hip hop style and sensibilities with modern dance music began to emerge, like [[Rae & Christian|Mark Rae]]'s [[Grand Central Records|Grand Central]] (home to Aim, Rae & Christian, and Fingathing, among others) or [[DJ Vadim]]'s Jazz Fudge. Increasingly, these artists managed to avoid the issues surrounding sampling by making music themselves (bands such as the [[Stereo MCs]] began playing instruments and sampling their own tunes) or searching out more obscure records where a most cost effective licensing deal could be arranged.\n\nBritish hip hop began to go through a renaissance,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/reviews/1482738.stm |title=BBC News website: British hip hop renaissance |first=Barney |last=Rowntree |date=10 August 2001 |accessdate=2 November 2006}}</ref> its style shifting from the hardcore template of its youth and moving into more melodic territory.\n\nThe Brotherhood managed to broker a major deal with Virgin Records in 1995.  Continuing their relationship with Trevor Jackson as their producer, they released 3 singles \u2018Alphabetical Response\u2019, \u2018One Shot\u2019, \u2018Punk Funk\u2019 and their album ''[[Elementalz]]'', all in 1996.  Their work was met with critical acclaim and they toured solidly with American artists including Cypress Hill, The Roots and WuTang, but big record sales seemed to be very elusive and they parted ways with Virgin in 1998.\n[[File:MF Doom The Arches 2.jpg|thumb|255x255px|MF Doom has been ranked as one of the greatest rappers of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/rappers-music-greatest-celebrities-tupac|title=11 Rappers Who Should Be Added To Everyones Playlists|date=2018-11-05|website=The Odyssey Online|language=en-us|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>]]\nIn late 1996 [[Will Ashon]] started up his new [[Ninja Tune]] backed label [[Big Dada]] and planned a roster of performers. Bandit of Birmingham's MSI/Asylum crew informed Will of [[Juice Aleem]] that he was contemplating who could truly represent the ethos of the new label. Ashon was impressed with the demo and agreed to have Aleem on board. The results of this were the first release of the now famous record label: in 1997 Juice featured on Big Dada record label's first ever release[2], \"Misanthropic\", under the pseudonym \"Alpha Prhyme\", a collaboration between himself and [[Luke Vibert]].\n\nIn 1998 [[Mark B]] and Blade released \"Hitmen for Hire EP\", which featured guest appearances from [[Lewis Parker (musician)|Lewis Parker]] and [[Mr Thing]] (of the [[Scratch Perverts]]). The EP was a success, and led to the successful 2001 album ''The Unknown'', which despite never charting in the UK top 75, was still a top 100 success and an even bigger success within its genre. Also, the album spawned the 2001 top 40 single \"Ya Don't See the Signs\", which was a remix by [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] frontman [[Grant Nicholas]], after the title track was a top 75 hit and Blade with Mark B supported Feeder. The same year, Bristol's Hombr\u00e9 label released the \"2012 EP\" from [[Aspects (band)|Aspects]], a benchmark release within the movement. [[Roots Manuva]], [[Blak Twang]], [[Mud Family]], [[Ti2bs]], [[Task Force (band)|Task Force]], [[Phi Life Cypher]], MSI & Asylum, [[Jeep Beat Collective]] and [[Ty (rapper)|Ty]] all came to the public's attention, while veteran acts [[Rodney P]], [[Demon Boyz|Mike J]], and MC Mell'O' returned to the scene. In 1999, MF Doom released his debut studio album ''[[Operation: Doomsday]]'' which has since been ranked as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time.\n\n===Underground to mainstream: '00s to 2010s===\nA new generation of artists emerged following the turn of the century, including [[Jehst]], [[Skinnyman]], [[Nicky Spesh]], [[Foreign Beggars]] and Usmaan. At the same time, a new style of [[electronic music]] emerged in the early 2000s, derivative of [[UK Garage]] and [[jungle]], with influences from [[Dancehall]], [[Drum and bass]] and [[hip hop]]. The new genre was dubbed [[Grime (music)|grime]] (sometimes called eskibeat or sublow) and effectively superseded UK hip hop in both popularity and the mainstream conscious.

As the songs entered the charts, more people began to find out and talk about UK drill again, thus attracting new fans to the genre, and attracting both positive and negative media attention for various reasons, keeping the genre in the limelight, and bursting the bubble the genre was confined within. This also opened up drill to UK artists of other genres more, to begin rapping over drill style instrumentals and experimenting with sounds inside of the genre, as opposed to their usual styles.\n\nIn 2020, [[DigDat]] released ''Ei8ht Mile''. The mixtape scored the biggest opening week of all time for a UK drill album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/officialcharts/status/1220769242028609540|title=Big news for @DigDat8 \u2013 his new mixtape Ei8ht Mile scores the biggest opening week for a UK drill album:|last=Charts|first=Official|date=2020-01-24|website=@officialcharts|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-25}}</ref>\n\n'''Notable UK drill singles & albums charting in the Top 100 (between 2015\u20132019)''':<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/|work=Official Charts Company (OCC)|title=Official Charts \u2013 Home of the Official UK Top 40 Charts|access-date=6 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806163721/https://www.officialcharts.com/|archive-date=6 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

Many of these artists gained influences from the American trap scene and deciding to add the UK sound and flavour to the genre.

Instead, acts such as [[Tinchy Stryder]], [[Tinie Tempah]], [[N-Dubz]] and [[Chip (rapper)|Chip]] were signed to major labels and their traditional sound tweaked to fit a pop sensibility. However the lineage of these, and many UK rappers, is unquestionably grime rather than UK hip-hop.\n\nThere is a common belief within the underground hip hop community that true hip hop is music relevant primarily to the disenfranchised listeners, rather than the mass market. Because of the belief that mainstream acts are paid large sums of money by the major labels to make music tailored to the current mass market, these artists often face a backlash and accusations of 'selling out' from the underground community.<ref>{{cite news|title=British hip-hop heads out of the underground|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/british-hip-hop-heads-out-of-the-underground-1958279.html|accessdate=10 October 2016|work=The Independent|date=30 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010215230/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/british-hip-hop-heads-out-of-the-underground-1958279.html|archive-date=10 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\nThe growth of British hip hop was given a boost when in 2002, the BBC launched a digital radio station [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]] devoted to \"new black music\" including hip hop, [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[UK garage]], [[dancehall]], [[Grime music|grime]] and drum and bass,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/ |title=BBC Website: 1xtra |accessdate=1 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104060217/http://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/ |archive-date=4 November 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref> however 1Xtra does not play exclusively British hip hop.

''[[Raw Like Sushi]]'' (1989) was solely produced by English producers and was a massive hit in both the UK and US. Cherry continues to produce and release music today.\n\nWomen in hip hop often confront a large amount of sexist stereotyping; however some female British hip hop artists such as Lady Sovereign and M.I.A. have achieved success both in the UK and US.

Unlike in the US, the British hip hop scene was cross-racial from the beginning, as various ethnic groups in Britain tend not to live in segregated areas, even in areas with a high percentage of non-white individuals. Such places allow youth to share culture with one another, including musical genres such as hip hop.<ref>{{cite news |title=\"Urban Breakbeat Culture: Repercussions of Hip-Hop in the United Kingdom\", pp. 86\u2013101 in Global Noise: Rap and Hip Hop Outside of the USA, edited by Tony Mitchell.

The most direct influence was, however, on graffiti painted in [[London Underground]] trains. Teenagers from inner London and other European cities who were into electro-hip hop and had family and other links to New York City had by the mid-1980s taken up some of the traditions of subway graffiti and exported them home, although legendary New York writers like Brim, Bio, and Futura had themselves played a significant role in establishing such links when they visited London in the early-to-mid-'80s and 'put up pieces' on or near the west London end of the Metropolitan Line. Almost as significantly, just when subway graffiti was on the decline in New York City, some British teenagers who had spent time with family in Queens and the Bronx returned to London with a \"mission\" to Americanize the London Underground through painting New York City-style graffiti on trains. These small groups of London 'train writers' adopted many of the styles and lifestyles of their New York City forebears, painting graffiti train pieces and in general 'bombing' the system, but favoring only a few selected underground lines seen as most suitable for train graffiti. Although on a substantially smaller scale than what had existed in New York City, graffiti on London Underground trains became seen as enough of a problem by the mid-1980s to provoke the British Transport Police to establish its own graffiti squad modeled directly on and in consultation with that of the New York City MTA. At the same time, graffiti art on London Underground trains generated some interest in the media and arts, leading to several art galleries putting on exhibitions of some of the art work (on canvass) of a few London train writers as well as TV documentaries on London hip hop culture like the BBC's ''Bad Meaning Good'', which included a section featuring interviews with London train writers and a few examples of their pieces.\n\nWhile many early rappers from the UK, such as [[Derek B]], imitated the styles and accents of their US heroes, there were many who realised that to merely transpose US forms would rob UK hip-hop of the ability to speak for a disenfranchised British constituency in the way that US hip-hop so successfully spoke to, and for, its audience. Attempts were made by UK rappers to develop styles more obviously rooted in British linguistic practices \u2014 [[Rodney P]] of the [[London Posse]] deliberately chose a London accent \u2014 although many succeeded only in adopting a slurred hybrid that located the rap \"somewhere in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean\".<ref>Hesmondhalgh, David and Caspar Melville. \"Urban Breakbeat Culture: Repercussions of Hip-Hop in the United Kingdom.\" In Global Noise: Rap and Hip-Hop Outside the USA, 86\u2013110.

Their ''Hard as Hell'' series mixed homegrown talent like Thrashpack and the [[She Rockers]] with US artists such as [[Professor Griff]]. Music of Life was swiftly followed by other labels such as [[Mango Records]] and Kold Sweat. Another successful British hip-hop artist that emerged from Music of Life was [[Asher D (Jamaican-British rapper)|Asher D]], whose Jamaican origins showed through in his vocal style.[[File:Slick Rick - The Ruler.jpg|thumb|259x259px|Slick Rick is commonly ranked as one of the greatest rappers of all time.]]\nMoving away from its US roots, British hip hop started to develop its own sounds: acts like [[Hijack (group)|Hijack]], [[II Tone Committee]], [[Hardnoise]], and [[Silver Bullet (rapper)|Silver Bullet]] developed a fast and [[hardcore hip hop|hardcore]] style, while many other acts took influences from elsewhere. [[Caveman (group)|Caveman]] and [[Outlaw Posse]] developed a jazz influenced style, whilst MC Mell'O' mixed [[jazz]] and hardcore. [[London Posse]], [[Black Radical Mk II]] and DJ Ruf Cut And Tuf C were more influenced by [[reggae]] and [[disco]] whilst the [[Wee Papa Girl Rappers]], [[Cookie Crew]] and [[Monie Love]] achieved chart success with more radio friendly hip hop. However, despite the chart success of some British-born hip hop artists \u2014 for example [[Monie Love]], [[Slick Rick]], [[Young MC]] and [[MF Doom]], who all moved to the US \u2014 the majority of the scene was still underground and small scale.\n\nKinetic Effect joined the scene in the early 1980s and was part of rap outfit 2 the Top as D-Koy; later, in 1991, he teamed with Insane Macbeth to record \"Borderin' Insanity\" (released in 1993) and in 1995, he recorded \"Man Bites Dog\"/\"The Effect of Fear\"<ref name=\"Heroes of UK Hip Hop\">[http://www.heroesofukhiphop.com/Kinetic.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204163244/http://www.heroesofukhiphop.com/Kinetic.htm|date=4 February 2012}}</ref> Their song \"The Rhythm I Give 'Em\" made the UK Top 10 Hip Hop chart.

More was to come in the early 1990s in the form of [[MC Reason]] (a.k.a Voice of Reason) with \"Symbolise\"/\"HouseQuake\" and [[Jonie D]] with \"Which Base\"/\"Ride On\" which was performed live on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 1991.\n\nA mindset began to develop \u2014 typified by the [[Gunshot (band)|Gunshot]] tune \"No Sell Out\" (1991), or [[Hardnoise|Son of Noise]]'s \"Poor But Hardcore\" (1992) \u2014 that distrusted successful artists who did not utilise the hardcore style most associated with the scene. [[Silver Bullet (rapper)|Silver Bullet]]'s chart success was applauded due to an uncompromisingly rapid delivery, whereas Derek B and [[Rebel MC]] were scorned when their more pop influenced styles earned them success. Such artists were often branded \"sell outs\". As the scene grew, it became less common for British rappers to imitate US accents (those who did were often ridiculed) and British rap became more assured of its identity.\n\n''[[Hip Hop Connection]]'' \u2014 the first major British hip hop magazine \u2014 was founded in 1989 and by the early 1990s the British hip hop scene seemed to be thriving. Not only was there a firm base of rappers in London such as Blade, [[Black Radical Mk II]], [[Overlord X]] and Bushkiller (including Sirus) \u2014 but many distinct scenes developed nationally.\n\nBirmingham and the West Midlands gave rise to [[Credit to the Nation]], whose MC Fusion would espouse conscious anti-racist, sexist and homophobic lyrics. The band would also find some brief mainstream success with their [[indie rock]] crossover sound. Leeds spawned [[Braintax]] and Breaking the Illusion (who together founded [[Low Life Records]]) as well as [[Nightmares on Wax]]. Greater Manchester gave birth to the [[Ruthless Rap Assassins]], Krispy 3 (later Krispy), the [[Kaliphz]], [[Jeep Beat Collective]] and [[MC Tunes]].\n\nBristol's scene has a long history going right back to the early '80s where links were made with outfits from New York. [[The Fearless Four (group)|The Fearless Four]] came over in 1984 along with graffiti legends the [[Tats Cru]] and [[Rock Steady Crew]].  Bristol (specifically the [[St Pauls, Bristol|St. Pauls]] area) produced The Wild Bunch (later better known as [[Massive Attack]]), [[Nellee Hooper]] who went on to produce for [[Soul II Soul]]. The city has also produced notable DMC DJs Mad Cut and DJ Quest. The city later became the home of [[trip hop]] with artists like [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]] and [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]].\n\n[[Caveman (group)|Caveman]] signed to a major label \u2014 [[Profile Records]], the label home of [[Run\u2013D.M.C.]] \u2014 and Kold Sweat came into their own, discovering groups like SL Troopers, [[Dynametrix]], Unanimous Decision and Katch 22, whose \"Diary of a Blackman\" was banned by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] for using a sound clip from the [[British National Front|National Front]].\n\nIn 1991, [[Hijack (hip hop group)|Hijack]] released ''The Horns of Jericho'' (Rhyme Syndicate Records, 1991) on [[Ice-T]]'s recently formed Rhyme Syndicate label. The first single, \"The Badman Is Robbin'\", was a top 40 hit and they went on sell more than 30,000 albums.\n\nBritish hip hop was affected by the record industry clamping down on [[sampling (music)|sampling]], beginning to charge for the use of samples and prosecuting those who used them without permission. Larger US acts could afford to license samples and still turn a profit for their labels, a luxury not available to many smaller UK artists. One such victim of this was [[Milton Keynes]] group [[the Criminal Minds]]. Their first two releases, the 1990 mini-album ''Guilty as Charged'' and a 1991 EP ''Tales from the Wasteland'' were bogged down by potential sample clearance problems and thus were only ever made available in small numbers, yet rate amongst some of the finest pieces of UK hip hop recorded. As [[breakbeat hardcore]] music started to become very popular in the UK in the early 1990s, the Criminal Minds turned their attention to making this type of music instead.\n\nThe UK hip hop boom never achieved its predicted commercial success. Hijack's ''The Horns of Jericho'' was never released in the US, while record companies dropped artists, citing poor sales and lack of interest. [[Mango Records]] closed down, and the British public began to turn their affections to [[Jungle music|jungle]], a fusion of breakbeat hardcore, hip hop and reggae. Other acts and styles developed from the hip hop scene, resulting in new genres to describe them \u2014 for example [[Massive Attack]]<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/70844.stm |title=BBC News website, Massive Attack on the net |date=29 March 1998 |accessdate=2 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040509115510/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/70844.stm |archive-date=9 May 2004 |url-status=live }}</ref> with [[trip hop]], or [[Galliano (band)|Galliano]], [[Us3]] and [[Urban Species]] with [[acid jazz]].\n\nIn the period between 1992 and 1995, the only groups to make much impact were Gunshot amd [[The Brotherhood (rap group)|the Brotherhood]]. \nGunshot's 1992 album ''Patriot Games'' was a landmark with tracks such as \"Mind of a Razor\" and \"World War 3\" becoming British hardcore classics.  Formed in the '80s, the Brotherhood released their first record, simply called ''Brotherhood EP'', as a white label in 1991. They went on to release ''Wayz of the Wize'' in 1992, then ''Untitled 93'' and ''XXIII'' in 1993, and ''Hip Hop N' Rap'' in 1994, all on the Bite It! label. None of the records sold in huge numbers but they managed to gain airplay on the [[Tim Westwood]] show and DJ 279's show on [[Choice FM]], gaining them a solid following across the UK. Bite It! also released tracks from artists such as Pauly Ryan and the Scientists of Sound.\n\n===New generation: Late '90s\u2013early '00s===\nFollowing an initial flurry of interest from major record labels in the 1980s, by the early 1990s the scene had moved underground after record companies pulled back. In the mid-1990s hip hop in the UK started to experiment and diversify \u2014 often mutating into different genres entirely, such as [[trip hop]] and began making inroads into the US market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklists.com/q101-1997.html |title=Q101 Top 101 of 1997 |publisher=Rocklists.com |date= |accessdate=2015-06-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924091722/http://www.rocklists.com/q101-1997.html |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nAs the old rappers left the scene, a new generation, raised on hip hop and [[electronica]], was coming of age: [[The Herbaliser]] released ''Remedies'' ([[Ninja Tune]], 1995), [[Mr. Scruff]] released the \"Frolic EP Pt 1\" (Pleasure Music, 1995), [[Mark B]] released \"Any More Questions?\" (Jazz Fudge, 1995) and [[DJ Skitz]] released \"Where My Mind Is At/Blessed Be The Manor\" (Ronin Records, 1996) featuring a young rapper called [[Roots Manuva]] on guest vocals who had previously released the single \"Next Type of Motion\" (Sound of Money, 1995).\n\nRecord labels that attempted to merge British hip hop style and sensibilities with modern dance music began to emerge, like [[Rae & Christian|Mark Rae]]'s [[Grand Central Records|Grand Central]] (home to Aim, Rae & Christian, and Fingathing, among others) or [[DJ Vadim]]'s Jazz Fudge. Increasingly, these artists managed to avoid the issues surrounding sampling by making music themselves (bands such as the [[Stereo MCs]] began playing instruments and sampling their own tunes) or searching out more obscure records where a most cost effective licensing deal could be arranged.\n\nBritish hip hop began to go through a renaissance,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/reviews/1482738.stm |title=BBC News website: British hip hop renaissance |first=Barney |last=Rowntree |date=10 August 2001 |accessdate=2 November 2006}}</ref> its style shifting from the hardcore template of its youth and moving into more melodic territory.\n\nThe Brotherhood managed to broker a major deal with Virgin Records in 1995.  Continuing their relationship with Trevor Jackson as their producer, they released 3 singles \u2018Alphabetical Response\u2019, \u2018One Shot\u2019, \u2018Punk Funk\u2019 and their album ''[[Elementalz]]'', all in 1996.  Their work was met with critical acclaim and they toured solidly with American artists including Cypress Hill, The Roots and WuTang, but big record sales seemed to be very elusive and they parted ways with Virgin in 1998.\n[[File:MF Doom The Arches 2.jpg|thumb|255x255px|MF Doom has been ranked as one of the greatest rappers of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theodysseyonline.com/rappers-music-greatest-celebrities-tupac|title=11 Rappers Who Should Be Added To Everyones Playlists|date=2018-11-05|website=The Odyssey Online|language=en-us|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>]]\nIn late 1996 [[Will Ashon]] started up his new [[Ninja Tune]] backed label [[Big Dada]] and planned a roster of performers. Bandit of Birmingham's MSI/Asylum crew informed Will of [[Juice Aleem]] that he was contemplating who could truly represent the ethos of the new label. Ashon was impressed with the demo and agreed to have Aleem on board. The results of this were the first release of the now famous record label: in 1997 Juice featured on Big Dada record label's first ever release[2], \"Misanthropic\", under the pseudonym \"Alpha Prhyme\", a collaboration between himself and [[Luke Vibert]].\n\nIn 1998 [[Mark B]] and Blade released \"Hitmen for Hire EP\", which featured guest appearances from [[Lewis Parker (musician)|Lewis Parker]] and [[Mr Thing]] (of the [[Scratch Perverts]]). The EP was a success, and led to the successful 2001 album ''The Unknown'', which despite never charting in the UK top 75, was still a top 100 success and an even bigger success within its genre. Also, the album spawned the 2001 top 40 single \"Ya Don't See the Signs\", which was a remix by [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]] frontman [[Grant Nicholas]], after the title track was a top 75 hit and Blade with Mark B supported Feeder. The same year, Bristol's Hombr\u00e9 label released the \"2012 EP\" from [[Aspects (band)|Aspects]], a benchmark release within the movement. [[Roots Manuva]], [[Blak Twang]], [[Mud Family]], [[Ti2bs]], [[Task Force (band)|Task Force]], [[Phi Life Cypher]], MSI & Asylum, [[Jeep Beat Collective]] and [[Ty (rapper)|Ty]] all came to the public's attention, while veteran acts [[Rodney P]], [[Demon Boyz|Mike J]], and MC Mell'O' returned to the scene. In 1999, MF Doom released his debut studio album ''[[Operation: Doomsday]]'' which has since been ranked as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time.\n\n===Underground to mainstream: '00s to 2010s===\nA new generation of artists emerged following the turn of the century, including [[Jehst]], [[Skinnyman]], [[Nicky Spesh]], [[Foreign Beggars]] and Usmaan. At the same time, a new style of [[electronic music]] emerged in the early 2000s, derivative of [[UK Garage]] and [[jungle]], with influences from [[Dancehall]], [[Drum and bass]] and [[hip hop]]. The new genre was dubbed [[Grime (music)|grime]] (sometimes called eskibeat or sublow) and effectively superseded UK hip hop in both popularity and the mainstream conscious. Notable grime acts include [[Dizzee Rascal]], [[Wiley (rapper)|Wiley]], [[Kano (rapper)|Kano]], [[Lethal Bizzle]], [[Tinchy Stryder]], [[Skepta]], [[Jme (musician)|Jme]], [[Jammer (rapper)|Jammer]], [[Shystie]], [[Ghetts]] and [[Devlin (rapper)|Devlin]]. Grime music saw some early success in America with Wiley, Kano and Dizzee Rascal, all releasing music across the atlantic. Grime is generally considered to be distinct from hip-hop due to its roots primarily being genres such as UK garage and jungle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2015/11/grime-hip-hop|title=Deeper Than Rap: Grime is Not a Subgenre of Hip-Hop|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-09-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914112019/https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2015/11/grime-hip-hop|archive-date=14 September 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/skepta-grime-and-urban-british-youth-language-a-guide-65611|title=Skepta, grime and urban British youth language: a guide|last=|first=|date=|website=The Conversation|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191008174156/http://theconversation.com/skepta-grime-and-urban-british-youth-language-a-guide-65611|archive-date=8 October 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/53gam8/grime-is-approaching-the-breakthrough-moment-hip-hop-reached-in-the-90s|title=Grime is Approaching the Breakthrough Moment Hip-Hop Reached in the 90s|last=|first=|date=2016-12-21|website=Vice|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191105013003/https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/53gam8/grime-is-approaching-the-breakthrough-moment-hip-hop-reached-in-the-90s|archive-date=5 November 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\":05\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/music/grime-time-what-it-is-and-where-to-find-it-a3247511.html|title=Grime time: What it is and where to find it|last=|first=|date=2016-05-13|website=Standard|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025044957/https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/music/grime-time-what-it-is-and-where-to-find-it-a3247511.html|archive-date=25 October 2019|access-date=}}</ref><ref name=\"complex2\">{{Cite web|url=http://uk.complex.com/music/2016/06/hip-hop-dancehall-breaking-down-the-origins-of-grime/dizzee-talks-hip-hop-rosenberg|title=Hip-Hop Or Dancehall?

These rappers strived to bring attention to both positivity and lyricism as well as the injustices of war, gentrification and racism, following in the tradition of conscious rappers such as [[Nas]], [[Mos Def]] and [[Talib Kweli]]. Amongst this new generation included artists such as [[Klashnekoff]], [[Akala (rapper)|Akala]], [[Lowkey]] and the Poisonous Poets. \n\nThe mid-2000s saw the emergence of Road rap, a genre that took influences from American gangsta rap and focused on crime, gang, or violent themes.

Loud, [[M Huncho]], Nafe Smallz, K-Trap, and [[SL (rapper)|SL]] (formerly Slimz) plus many more. Many of these artists gained influences from the American trap scene and deciding to add the UK sound and flavour to the genre. Many of them talk about braggadocious lifestyles they live and how it affects their music. In several interviews before, [[M Huncho]] has described his more tone-down, melodic style and moderately humbler approach when it comes to lyrics as his own derivative take on UK [[trap music]], in a genre he has personally dubbed as \"trapwave\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://nationofbillions.com/welcome-to-the-trapwave-m-huncho|work=A Nation Of Billions|title=Welcome To The TrapWave: M Huncho|date=29 May 2018|access-date=4 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190604120145/https://nationofbillions.com/welcome-to-the-trapwave-m-huncho|archive-date=4 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Wolverhampton artist [[Scarlxrd]] implements an energetic aesthetic and tone with explosively brazen screaming vocals, and dark yet reflectively intense and meaningful lyricism in an essentially self-pioneered style known as \"[[Rap metal#Trap metal|trap-metal]]\" or \"ragecore\"; a fusion of trap music and screaming vocals.

Instead, acts such as [[Tinchy Stryder]], [[Tinie Tempah]], [[N-Dubz]] and [[Chip (rapper)|Chip]] were signed to major labels and their traditional sound tweaked to fit a pop sensibility. However the lineage of these, and many UK rappers, is unquestionably grime rather than UK hip-hop.\n\nThere is a common belief within the underground hip hop community that true hip hop is music relevant primarily to the disenfranchised listeners, rather than the mass market. Because of the belief that mainstream acts are paid large sums of money by the major labels to make music tailored to the current mass market, these artists often face a backlash and accusations of 'selling out' from the underground community.<ref>{{cite news|title=British hip-hop heads out of the underground|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/british-hip-hop-heads-out-of-the-underground-1958279.html|accessdate=10 October 2016|work=The Independent|date=30 April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161010215230/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/british-hip-hop-heads-out-of-the-underground-1958279.html|archive-date=10 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Media==\nThe growth of British hip hop was given a boost when in 2002, the BBC launched a digital radio station [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]] devoted to \"new black music\" including hip hop, [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[UK garage]], [[dancehall]], [[Grime music|grime]] and drum and bass,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/ |title=BBC Website: 1xtra |accessdate=1 November 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104060217/http://www.bbc.co.uk/1xtra/ |archive-date=4 November 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref> however 1Xtra does not play exclusively British hip hop. The cable and satellite channel, Channel AKA (formerly Channel U, now known as [[Now 70s]]) also had the profile of British hip hop and grime.\nYouTube was also a very important outlet for upcoming and significant artists. Channels include [[Link Up TV]], [[GRM Daily]], [[SB.TV]], Pressplay Media and [[Mixtape Madness]].\n\n==Women==\nWomen have contributed to hip hop's evolution in Britain from the beginning.<ref>Chang, Jeff. \"Future Shock\", \"Future Shock\", January 2004.

''[[Raw Like Sushi]]'' (1989) was solely produced by English producers and was a massive hit in both the UK and US. Cherry continues to produce and release music today.\n\nWomen in hip hop often confront a large amount of sexist stereotyping; however some female British hip hop artists such as Lady Sovereign and M.I.A. have achieved success both in the UK and US.

this, stating that, \u201cUnlike mobile phones, some e-cigarette lithium-ion batteries within e-cigarettes offer no protection to stop the coil overheating\u201d .<ref name=\":02\" /> In 2015 the [[United States Fire Administration|U.S. Fire Administration]] noted in their report that electronic cigarettes are not created by [[Big Tobacco]] or other tobacco companies, but by independent factories that have little quality control.<ref name=\":02\" /> Because of this low quality control when made, electronic cigarettes have led to numerous incidents in which people are hurt, or in which the surrounding area is damaged.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":12\" /> \n\nMost incidents in which electronic cigarettes have been known to explode, occurred when the device itself is charging, usually within 10 minutes.<ref name=\":02\" /> When an e-cigarette combusts, it creates a fire hazard, especially if the electronic cigarette is left on its own with no supervision. Multiple case studies have shown that electronic cigarettes are at risk of this while they are charging. The [[United States Fire Administration|U.S. Fire Administration]] states that, \u201cE-cigarettes left charging for long period, especially when unattended, have led to fires in homes and cars,\u201d .<ref name=\":02\" /> This can cause two issues. The first issue would be the device causing a fire while charging and while in use, in which a person may be harmed but they can relatively quickly put out the fire with minimal damage to them and their surroundings. Some of the incidents that the [[United States Fire Administration|U.S. Fire Administration]]<nowiki/>looked at portrayed that this scenario only occurred about 8% of the time, leaving 9 people injured and 2 people with serious burns.<ref name=\":02\" /> The second issue would be if the device is left alone charging and the person goes off into another room or leaves the house completely, and the device implodes. In the cases in which fires were started, 52% of the fires were small scale or minor.<ref name=\":02\" /> In those cases people were around to stop the fire, but what about the other cases in which a person doesn't notice the fire or if they aren\u2019t even in the house when the fire starts? 32% of cases showcase a moderate fire and 4% of cases showcase that the fire destroyed the room the device was in and its contents.<ref name=\":02\" /> Another report from the U.S. Fire Administration states the following, \u201cIn 27 incidents, the fire spread was moderate, where the burned area was larger than 6 inches in diameter, but the fire was extinguished by occupants before the fire department arrived. In 10 incidents, the fire spread was major and involved significant portions of a building and required suppression by the fire department,\".<ref name=\":12\" /> The U.S. Fire Administration also notes that in most cases, when the device has combusted, the fire produced spreads to nearby clothing, carpets, drapes, etc.<ref name=\":12\" /> About 66% of explosions led to a fire, because of the contents in the radius of the explosion.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== Marketing ===\n{{Main|Electronic cigarette and e-cigarette liquid marketing}}\n[[File:Ecig marketing youth

this, stating that, \u201cUnlike mobile phones, some e-cigarette lithium-ion batteries within e-cigarettes offer no protection to stop the coil overheating\u201d .<ref name=\":02\" /> In 2015 the [[United States Fire Administration|U.S. Fire Administration]] noted in their report that electronic cigarettes are not created by [[Big Tobacco]] or other tobacco companies, but by independent factories that have little quality control.<ref name=\":02\" /> Because of this low quality control when made, electronic cigarettes have led to numerous incidents in which people are hurt, or in which the surrounding area is damaged.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref name=\":12\" /> \n\nMost incidents in which electronic cigarettes have been known to explode, occurred when the device itself is charging, usually within 10 minutes.<ref name=\":02\" /> When an e-cigarette combusts, it creates a fire hazard, especially if the electronic cigarette is left on its own with no supervision. Multiple case studies have shown that electronic cigarettes are at risk of this while they are charging. The [[United States Fire Administration|U.S. Fire Administration]] states that, \u201cE-cigarettes left charging for long period, especially when unattended, have led to fires in homes and cars,\u201d .<ref name=\":02\" /> This can cause two issues. The first issue would be the device causing a fire while charging and while in use, in which a person may be harmed but they can relatively quickly put out the fire with minimal damage to them and their surroundings. Some of the incidents that the [[United States Fire Administration|U.S. Fire Administration]]<nowiki/>looked at portrayed that this scenario only occurred about 8% of the time, leaving 9 people injured and 2 people with serious burns.<ref name=\":02\" /> The second issue would be if the device is left alone charging and the person goes off into another room or leaves the house completely, and the device implodes. In the cases in which fires were started, 52% of the fires were small scale or minor.<ref name=\":02\" /> In those cases people were around to stop the fire, but what about the other cases in which a person doesn't notice the fire or if they aren\u2019t even in the house when the fire starts? 32% of cases showcase a moderate fire and 4% of cases showcase that the fire destroyed the room the device was in and its contents.<ref name=\":02\" /> Another report from the U.S. Fire Administration states the following, \u201cIn 27 incidents, the fire spread was moderate, where the burned area was larger than 6 inches in diameter, but the fire was extinguished by occupants before the fire department arrived. In 10 incidents, the fire spread was major and involved significant portions of a building and required suppression by the fire department,\".<ref name=\":12\" /> The U.S. Fire Administration also notes that in most cases, when the device has combusted, the fire produced spreads to nearby clothing, carpets, drapes, etc.<ref name=\":12\" /> About 66% of explosions led to a fire, because of the contents in the radius of the explosion.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n=== Marketing ===\n{{Main|Electronic cigarette and e-cigarette liquid marketing}}\n[[File:Ecig marketing youth

The \"alternative\" comedy scene also began to evolve. Some of the earliest successes came from [[folk club]]s, where performers such as [[Billy Connolly]], [[Mike Harding]] and [[Jasper Carrott]] started as relatively straight musical acts whose between-song banter developed into complete comedy routines. The 1960s had also seen the satire boom, including the creation of the club, [[The Establishment (club)|the Establishment]], which, amongst other things, gave British audiences their first taste of extreme American stand-up comedy from [[Lenny Bruce]].<ref>\"So Farewell Then: The Untold Life of Peter Cook\" Cook, Wendy E. {{ISBN|0-00-722893-7}}, p. 139-144</ref> [[Victoria Wood]] launched her stand-up career in the early 1980s, which included observational conversation mixed with comedy songs.

The present British stand-up comedy circuit arose from the 'alternative' comedy revolution of the 1980s, with political and observational humor being the prominent styles to flourish. In 1983, young drama teacher Maria Kempinska created [[Jongleurs]] Comedy Clubs, now the largest stand-up comedy chain in Europe. Stand up comedy is believed to have been performed originally as a one-man show.

The first generalized relationship with this comic genre occurred in 1999 with the creation of the [[Comedy Central Spain|Paramount Comedy]] channel, which included the ''New Comics'' program as one of its flagship programs, where monologuists such as [[\u00c1ngel Mart\u00edn]], Jos\u00e9 Juan Vaquero, [[David Broncano]], and [[Joaqu\u00edn Reyes (actor)|Joaqu\u00edn Reyes]] stood out.\nAlso, in 1999 began the journey of the program [[The club of comedy]], an open adaptation of the popular comic format. In its first stage (1999-2005), it underwent several chain changes and released comedians like [[Luis Piedrahita]], [[Alexis Valdes]] or [[:es:Goyo Jim\u00e9nez|Goyo Jim\u00e9nez]]. In its new stage, starting in 2011 in [[La Sexta]] and presented by [[Eva Hache]], it tries to start in the genre of comic monologue media characters from different artistic fields such as: [[Imanol Arias]], [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Gil]], [[Isabel Ordaz]] and [[Santiago Segura]].\nSpecial mention deserves the [[:es:Buenafuente|Buenafuente]] program, started in 2005. The presenter, [[Andreu Buenafuente]], made an initial monologue of about 9 to 11 minutes where he links current issues with everyday humorous situations. This became the most famous part of the program and made him one of the most recognized comedians in Spain, for his connection with the public and his ability to improvise.\nOn the other hand, the comedian [[Ignatius Farray]] became one of the most representative icons of this genre today.\n\n== History of stand-up in the Americas ==\n\n===United States===\n[[File:George Carlin 1969.JPG|thumb|right|160px|<center>[[George Carlin]] in 1969</center>]]\nStand-up comedy in the United States got its start from '''[[monologist]]s''' performing [[Stump speech (minstrelsy)|stump-speech monologues]] from within the [[minstrel show]]s of the early 19th century.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://news.psu.edu/story/141330/2008/09/12/research/probing-question-what-are-roots-stand-comedy\n |title=Probing Question: What are the roots of stand-up comedy?\n |last=Parker\n |first=Bethany\n |date=12 September 2008\n |department=Research\n |website=PennState News\n |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University \n |location=University Park, Pennsylvania\n |access-date=24 February 2019\n |quote=American stand-up comedy has its beginnings in the minstrel shows of the early 1800s}}</ref> It also has roots in various traditions of popular entertainment of the late 19th century, including [[vaudeville]], English [[music hall]], [[burlesque]] or [[Variety show|early variety shows]], [[humorist]] monologues by personalities such as [[Mark Twain]], and [[circus clown]] antics.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/stand-up-comedy\n |title=Stand-up comedy\n |last= Zoglin\n |first=Richard\n |website=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica\n |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.\n |access-date=8 March 2019}}</ref> With the turn of the century and spread of urban and industrial living, the structure, pacing and timing, and material of American humor began to change. Comedians of this era often depended on fast-paced joke delivery, slapstick, outrageous or lewd innuendo, and donned an ethnic persona\u2014African, Scottish, German, Jewish\u2014and built a routine based on popular stereotypes. Jokes were generally broad and material was widely shared, or in some cases, stolen. Industrialized American audiences sought entertainment as a way to escape and confront city living.\n\nThe founders of modern American stand-up comedy include [[Moms Mabley]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Bob Hope]], [[George Burns]], [[Fred Allen]], [[Milton Berle]] and [[Frank Fay (American actor)|Frank Fay]], all of whom came from vaudeville or the [[Chitlin' Circuit]].<ref>\"'Whoopi Goldberg Presents Moms Mabley'\" ZAP 2 IT: http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/11/whoopi-goldberg-presents-moms-mabley-eddie-murphy-bill-cosby-and-arsenio-hall-all-owe-a-debt.html</ref> They spoke directly to the audience as themselves, in front of the curtain, known as performing \"in one\". Frank Fay gained acclaim as a \"[[master of ceremonies]]\" at New York's [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theater]]. Vaudevillian [[Charlie Case|Charlie Case (also spelled Charley Case)]] is often credited with the first form of stand-up comedy, performing humorous monologues without props or costumes. This had not been done before during a vaudeville show.\n\nNightclubs and resorts became the new breeding ground for stand-ups. Acts such as [[Alan King (comedian)|Alan King]], [[Danny Thomas]], [[Martin and Lewis]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Joan Rivers]] and [[Jack E. Leonard]] flourished in these venues.\n\nIn the 1950s and into the 1960s, stand-ups such as [[Mort Sahl]] began developing their acts in small folk clubs like San Francisco's [[hungry i]] (owned by impresario [[Enrico Banducci]] and origin of the ubiquitous \"brick wall\" behind comedians)<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/16/local/me-banducci16|title=Enrico Banducci, 85; owned hungry i nightclub|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|date=2007-10-16|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref> or New York's [[The Bitter End|Bitter End]].

Some [[African American|Black American]] comedians such as [[Redd Foxx]], [[George Kirby]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Dick Gregory]] began to cross over to white audiences during this time.\n\nIn the 1970s, several entertainers became major stars based on stand-up comedy performances. [[Richard Pryor]] and George Carlin followed Lenny Bruce's acerbic style to become icons. Stand-up expanded from clubs, resorts, and coffee houses into major concerts in sports arenas and amphitheaters. [[Steve Martin]] and Bill Cosby had levels of success with gentler comic routines. The older style of stand-up comedy (no social satire) was kept alive by [[Rodney Dangerfield]] and [[Buddy Hackett]], who enjoyed revived careers late in life. [[Don Rickles]], whose legendary style of relentless merciless attacks on both fellow performers and audience members alike kept him a fixture on TV and in Vegas from the 1960s all the way to the 2000s, when he appeared in the wildly popular [[Pixar]] ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' films as [[Mr Potato Head]], who just happened to share Don's grouchy onstage mannerisms. Television programs such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' helped publicize the careers of other stand-up comedians, including [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[Bill Maher]] and [[Jay Leno]].\n\nFrom the 1970s to the '90s, different styles of comedy began to emerge, from the madcap stylings of [[Robin Williams]], to the odd observations of [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Ellen DeGeneres]], the ironic musings of [[Steven Wright]], to the mimicry of [[Whoopi Goldberg]], and [[Eddie Murphy]]. These comedians would serve to influence the next generation of comedians.\n\n===Mexico===\n\nIn terms of [[:es:Comedia en vivo#M\u00e9xico|live comedy in Mexico]], the predecessors of this comic style are:\n* [[:es:Los Tepichines|The Tepichines]] are a comic duo who were predecessors of a style consisting of parodies and double senses with creativity\n* [[Miguel Galv\u00e1n]] (1957-2008) Originally from Juan Aldama, Zacatecas.

Later they created the first collective of comedy in Monterrey called For Laughter Standup Comedy. Luiki Wiki has participated in programs such as Es de Noche and I already arrived with Ren\u00e9 Franco and as with [[Adal Ramones]] in the 3rd season of the STANDparados program aired by Comedy District.\n* [[:es:Franco Escamilla|Franco Escamilla]] (1981-) Comedian, musician, radio announcer and founder of \"La Diablo Squad\".

Taking a step closer to the North American format, Chico Anysio and J\u00f4 Soares maintained the format - specially in their live nation-wide talks shows, and generally, in the opening monologues - bringing to Brazil a genre more similar to what we currently know as Stand-up.\n\nStand-up began to be interesting news in 2005 in ''S\u00e3o Paulo'', when the first club was created, called ''Clube de Com\u00e9dia Stand-Up:'' composed of Marcelo Mansfield, Rafinha Bastos, Oscar Filho, Marcela Leal and M\u00e1rcio Ribeiro. In S\u00e3o Paulo the comedy club would present in Beverly Hills, the traditional comedy venue in Moema. Shortly afterwards it migrated to Mr. Blues and Bleeker Street, in ''Vila Madalena''. In ''Rio de Janeiro'', ''Com\u00e9dia em P\u00e9, (''Comedy Standing Up): composed of Cl\u00e1udio Torres Gonzaga, F\u00e1bio Porch\u00e1t, Fernando Caruso and Paulo Carvalho, had its debue at the venue ''Rio Design Leblon''. These were the first stand-up performances in the country.\n\nIn 2006, the comic J\u00f4 Soares watched ''Clube de Com\u00e9dia'' in S\u00e3o Paulo and invited the comic Diogo Portugal for an interview in his talk show. That was a definitive moment to call attention towards the genre. He mentioned many different shows that he was a part of and attracted the public attention and media coverage to the bars that held these presentations. In Curitiba, with this momentum, many other stand-up nights began opening up. In S\u00e3o Paulo, Danilo Gentili, that had just become a part of ''Clube da Com\u00e9dia,'' invited M\u00e1rio Ribeiro and gathered other young comics that were frequent spectators at the club, to create ''Com\u00e9dia Ao Vivo'' (Live Comedy): composed of Dani Calabresa, Luiz Fran\u00e7a, F\u00e1bio Rabin.\n\nWith the show CQC - ''Custe o Que Custar'', on the channel Band, a nation-wide tv outlet, in 2008, the genre took gained its permanent spot on the national stage. With bug names like Danilo Gentili, Rafinha Bastos and Oscar Filho, the curiosity grew exponentially. \n\nFollowing CQC's example many channels and tv shows on Brazil's national television invested in Stand-up comedy. After this many other groups gained recognition in the clubs and live performances around the two biggest cities of Brazil.\n\n== History of stand-up in Asia ==\n===India===\n[[File:Kapil sharma.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Kapil Sharma (comedian)|Kapil Sharma]] an Indian stand up comedian, known for comedy nights with Kapil]]\nModern stand-up comedy in India is a young art form, however [[Chakyar koothu]] was prominent in [[Trivandrum]] and southern [[Kerala]] during the 16th and 17th centuries.

Both of them were exposed to UK and US comedy routines and they performed mostly in English. At the same time, a few more youngsters got inspired and started taking plunge into stand-up comedy.\n\nSince 2011, the stand-up comedy has been getting substantial appreciation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} The Comedy Store from London opened an outlet in Mumbai's Palladium Mall where people would regularly enjoy comedians from UK. The Comedy Story also supported local comedians and helped them grow. This outlet eventually become Canvas Laugh Club in Mumbai.\n\nAround 2011, people started organizing different comedy open mic events in Mumbai, Delhi (and Gurgaon), Bangalore. All of this happened in association with growth of a counterculture in Indian cities which catered to the appetite of younger generations for live events for comedy, poetry, storytelling, and music. Various stand up events were covered by popular news channels such NDTV / Aajtak etc. and were appreciated by millions of viewers.\n\nAs a result of these developments, plus the increasing penetration of [[YouTube]] (along with [[Internet]]/[[World Wide Web]]), Indian stand up comedy started reaching further masses.

George Carlin was a perennial favorite, who appeared in 14 HBO comedy specials.\n\nContinuing that tradition, most modern stand-up comedians use television or motion pictures to reach a level of success and recognition unattainable in the comedy-club circuit alone.\n\nLate-night talk shows and award show ceremonies are commonly hosted by comedians, delivering monologues similar to stand-up.\n\nSince the mid-2000s, online video-sharing sites such as [[YouTube]] have also provided a venue for stand-up comedians, and many comedians' performances can be viewed online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybits.com/watch-stand-up-comedians-on-youtube/|title=Watch Stand Up Comedians on YouTube|accessdate=2008-09-27 |work= Daniel Scocco |publisher=Dailybits.com |date=2008-09-23}}</ref>\n\nAn Amazon TV show, ''[[The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel]]'', depicts the fictional life of a woman comedian, set in the late 1950s.

Industrialized American audiences sought entertainment as a way to escape and confront city living.\n\nThe founders of modern American stand-up comedy include [[Moms Mabley]], [[Jack Benny]], [[Bob Hope]], [[George Burns]], [[Fred Allen]], [[Milton Berle]] and [[Frank Fay (American actor)|Frank Fay]], all of whom came from vaudeville or the [[Chitlin' Circuit]].<ref>\"'Whoopi Goldberg Presents Moms Mabley'\" ZAP 2 IT: http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2013/11/whoopi-goldberg-presents-moms-mabley-eddie-murphy-bill-cosby-and-arsenio-hall-all-owe-a-debt.html</ref> They spoke directly to the audience as themselves, in front of the curtain, known as performing \"in one\". Frank Fay gained acclaim as a \"[[master of ceremonies]]\" at New York's [[Palace Theatre (Broadway)|Palace Theater]]. Vaudevillian [[Charlie Case|Charlie Case (also spelled Charley Case)]] is often credited with the first form of stand-up comedy, performing humorous monologues without props or costumes. This had not been done before during a vaudeville show.\n\nNightclubs and resorts became the new breeding ground for stand-ups. Acts such as [[Alan King (comedian)|Alan King]], [[Danny Thomas]], [[Martin and Lewis]], [[Don Rickles]], [[Joan Rivers]] and [[Jack E. Leonard]] flourished in these venues.\n\nIn the 1950s and into the 1960s, stand-ups such as [[Mort Sahl]] began developing their acts in small folk clubs like San Francisco's [[hungry i]] (owned by impresario [[Enrico Banducci]] and origin of the ubiquitous \"brick wall\" behind comedians)<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2007/oct/16/local/me-banducci16|title=Enrico Banducci, 85; owned hungry i nightclub|last=McLellan|first=Dennis|date=2007-10-16|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref> or New York's [[The Bitter End|Bitter End]]. These comedians added an element of social satire and expanded both the language and boundaries of stand-up, venturing into politics, [[race relations]], and [[off-color humor|sexual humor]]. [[Lenny Bruce]] became known as 'the' obscene comic when he used language that usually led to his arrest.<ref>''Make Em Laugh: The Funny Business of America'' Maslon, Laurence E. {{ISBN|978-0-446-50531-4}}, p.340 \u2013 p.341</ref> After Lenny Bruce, arrests for obscene language on stage nearly disappeared until [[George Carlin]] was arrested on 21 July 1972 at [[Milwaukee]]'s [[Summerfest]] after performing the routine \"[[Seven dirty words|Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television]]\"<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=626471\n|title=Carlin's naughty words still ring in officer's ears\n|author=Jim Stingl\n|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]\n|date=June 30, 2007\n|accessdate=2008-03-23\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124942/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=626471 |archivedate = September 29, 2007}}</ref> (the case against Carlin was eventually dismissed).\n\nOther notable comics from this era include [[Woody Allen]], [[Shelley Berman]], [[Phyllis Diller]], and [[Bob Newhart]]. Some [[African American|Black American]] comedians such as [[Redd Foxx]], [[George Kirby]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Dick Gregory]] began to cross over to white audiences during this time.\n\nIn the 1970s, several entertainers became major stars based on stand-up comedy performances. [[Richard Pryor]] and George Carlin followed Lenny Bruce's acerbic style to become icons. Stand-up expanded from clubs, resorts, and coffee houses into major concerts in sports arenas and amphitheaters. [[Steve Martin]] and Bill Cosby had levels of success with gentler comic routines. The older style of stand-up comedy (no social satire) was kept alive by [[Rodney Dangerfield]] and [[Buddy Hackett]], who enjoyed revived careers late in life. [[Don Rickles]], whose legendary style of relentless merciless attacks on both fellow performers and audience members alike kept him a fixture on TV and in Vegas from the 1960s all the way to the 2000s, when he appeared in the wildly popular [[Pixar]] ''[[Toy Story (franchise)|Toy Story]]'' films as [[Mr Potato Head]], who just happened to share Don's grouchy onstage mannerisms. Television programs such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' helped publicize the careers of other stand-up comedians, including [[Janeane Garofalo]], [[Bill Maher]] and [[Jay Leno]].\n\nFrom the 1970s to the '90s, different styles of comedy began to emerge, from the madcap stylings of [[Robin Williams]], to the odd observations of [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and [[Ellen DeGeneres]], the ironic musings of [[Steven Wright]], to the mimicry of [[Whoopi Goldberg]], and [[Eddie Murphy]]. These comedians would serve to influence the next generation of comedians.\n\n===Mexico===\n\nIn terms of [[:es:Comedia en vivo#M\u00e9xico|live comedy in Mexico]], the predecessors of this comic style are:\n* [[:es:Los Tepichines|The Tepichines]] are a comic duo who were predecessors of a style consisting of parodies and double senses with creativity\n* [[Miguel Galv\u00e1n]] (1957-2008) Originally from Juan Aldama, Zacatecas. He dropped out of architecture at the Universidad del Valle de M\u00e9xico to take theater classes at the \"Dimitrio Sarr\u00e1s Actors Studio\" for three years.\n* Mara Escalante, is an actress, comedian and Mexican singer. She is known for the television series Mar\u00eda de Todos los \u00c1ngeles, in which she has two characters, including the protagonist. She began her career in the mid-1990s.\n* [[Polo Polo]] (1944-), whose routines are characterized by a high content of sexual references, with a touch of misogyny, relayed as a personal anecdote.\n* [[Adal Ramones]] (1961-) was one of the first to transport the genre to Mexico from his nocturnal program, using the comic monologue.\n* [[Evelio Arias Ramos|Evelio with V Chica]] (Evelio Arias Ramos, 1966-2008).\n* [[Eugenio Derbez]]\n\nThe new generation of comedians decided to use their own lives as the theme of their comedy, imitating the American style:\n\n* [[H\u00e9ctor Su\u00e1rez Gom\u00eds]], son of Mexican comedian [[H\u00e9ctor Su\u00e1rez]], is currently the host of the Latin American version of the comedy program Stand Up Comedy Central Presents, broadcast by Comedy Central from 2011 until 2014.\n* [[Adal Ramones]] since 2013 leads the program called [[:es:STANDparados|STANDparados]] broadcast by [[:es:Distrito Comedia|Comedy District]] before [[Classic TV]].\n* Kikis, (1980) comedian since late 2011, openly lesbian, has participated in [[Comedy Central Latin America]] as well as with [[Adal Ramones]] in STANDparados Comedy District.\n* Luiki Wiki (1985-) began making comedy in January 2013 in Mexico City and later moved to Monterrey NL to start the first Open Mic in Monterrey (an event in which comedians can participate to try out new material with a real audience) together with other comedians of the genre. Later they created the first collective of comedy in Monterrey called For Laughter Standup Comedy. Luiki Wiki has participated in programs such as Es de Noche and I already arrived with Ren\u00e9 Franco and as with [[Adal Ramones]] in the 3rd season of the STANDparados program aired by Comedy District.\n* [[:es:Franco Escamilla|Franco Escamilla]] (1981-) Comedian, musician, radio announcer and founder of \"La Diablo Squad\". He is mainly known for his comedy shows, has performed throughout the Mexican Republic and Latin America, even starting his own \"World Tour\", arriving to have confirmed performances in Europe and the United States, including trips to Japan and Australia. Currently known as the largest representative of Stand up Comedy in this country.\n* Hugo \"El Cojo Fel\u00edz\" (1988-), is a comedian, radio announcer, part of the devil Squad, has the radio program \"La Hora Fel\u00edz\" with the \"Uncle Rober\" and is considered the best pen in Mexico.\n* Roberto Andrade Cer\u00f3n the \"Uncle Rober\" (1979-) is a comedian, writer, radio announcer and has \"La Cojo Feliz\" the radio program \"La Hora Fel\u00edz\".\n*Daniel Sosa \n*Alex Fernandez\n\n=== Brazil ===\nThe one-man-show genre, which is similar, but allows other approaches (enacting characters, songs and scenes) was introduced in Brazil by Jos\u00e9 Vasconcellos in the 60's. Taking a step closer to the North American format, Chico Anysio and J\u00f4 Soares maintained the format - specially in their live nation-wide talks shows, and generally, in the opening monologues - bringing to Brazil a genre more similar to what we currently know as Stand-up.\n\nStand-up began to be interesting news in 2005 in ''S\u00e3o Paulo'', when the first club was created, called ''Clube de Com\u00e9dia Stand-Up:'' composed of Marcelo Mansfield, Rafinha Bastos, Oscar Filho, Marcela Leal and M\u00e1rcio Ribeiro. In S\u00e3o Paulo the comedy club would present in Beverly Hills, the traditional comedy venue in Moema. Shortly afterwards it migrated to Mr. Blues and Bleeker Street, in ''Vila Madalena''. In ''Rio de Janeiro'', ''Com\u00e9dia em P\u00e9, (''Comedy Standing Up): composed of Cl\u00e1udio Torres Gonzaga, F\u00e1bio Porch\u00e1t, Fernando Caruso and Paulo Carvalho, had its debue at the venue ''Rio Design Leblon''. These were the first stand-up performances in the country.\n\nIn 2006, the comic J\u00f4 Soares watched ''Clube de Com\u00e9dia'' in S\u00e3o Paulo and invited the comic Diogo Portugal for an interview in his talk show. That was a definitive moment to call attention towards the genre. He mentioned many different shows that he was a part of and attracted the public attention and media coverage to the bars that held these presentations. In Curitiba, with this momentum, many other stand-up nights began opening up. In S\u00e3o Paulo, Danilo Gentili, that had just become a part of ''Clube da Com\u00e9dia,'' invited M\u00e1rio Ribeiro and gathered other young comics that were frequent spectators at the club, to create ''Com\u00e9dia Ao Vivo'' (Live Comedy): composed of Dani Calabresa, Luiz Fran\u00e7a, F\u00e1bio Rabin.\n\nWith the show CQC - ''Custe o Que Custar'', on the channel Band, a nation-wide tv outlet, in 2008, the genre took gained its permanent spot on the national stage. With bug names like Danilo Gentili, Rafinha Bastos and Oscar Filho, the curiosity grew exponentially. \n\nFollowing CQC's example many channels and tv shows on Brazil's national television invested in Stand-up comedy. After this many other groups gained recognition in the clubs and live performances around the two biggest cities of Brazil.\n\n== History of stand-up in Asia ==\n===India===\n[[File:Kapil sharma.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Kapil Sharma (comedian)|Kapil Sharma]] an Indian stand up comedian, known for comedy nights with Kapil]]\nModern stand-up comedy in India is a young art form, however [[Chakyar koothu]] was prominent in [[Trivandrum]] and southern [[Kerala]] during the 16th and 17th centuries.

Thus, a lot more comedians became popular and started performing various live and TV shows. The demand for comedy content continues to increase. Some popular comedians around 2005-2008 include Raju Srivastav, Kapil Sharma, Sunil Pal etc. Most of them performed their acts in Hindi.\n\n[[File:Raju-Srivastav.jpg|right|thumb|160px|right|thumb|150px|New generation stand up comedian [[Raju Srivastav]]]]\n[[Raju Srivastav]] first appeared on the comedy talent show ''[[The Great Indian Laughter Challenge]]''.

Both of them were exposed to UK and US comedy routines and they performed mostly in English. At the same time, a few more youngsters got inspired and started taking plunge into stand-up comedy.\n\nSince 2011, the stand-up comedy has been getting substantial appreciation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}} The Comedy Store from London opened an outlet in Mumbai's Palladium Mall where people would regularly enjoy comedians from UK. The Comedy Story also supported local comedians and helped them grow. This outlet eventually become Canvas Laugh Club in Mumbai.\n\nAround 2011, people started organizing different comedy open mic events in Mumbai, Delhi (and Gurgaon), Bangalore. All of this happened in association with growth of a counterculture in Indian cities which catered to the appetite of younger generations for live events for comedy, poetry, storytelling, and music. Various stand up events were covered by popular news channels such NDTV / Aajtak etc. and were appreciated by millions of viewers.\n\nAs a result of these developments, plus the increasing penetration of [[YouTube]] (along with [[Internet]]/[[World Wide Web]]), Indian stand up comedy started reaching further masses. While the established comedians such as Vir Das, Papa CJ were independently growing through various corporate / international performances, other comedians such as [[Vipul Goyal]], [[Biswa Kalyan Rath]], [[Kenny Sebastian]], [[Kanan Gill]] grew popular through YouTube videos.\n\nThe industry, still in its early stages, now sees a lot more influx of aspiring comedians as it transforms the ecosystem around it.\n\n==Training and improvisation==\n\n[[Mark Twain]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld]],  both American masters of stand-up comedy, believe in practice and rehearsal.

They often opened their programs with topical monologues, characterized by [[ad-lib]]s and discussions about anything from the latest films to a missed birthday. Each program tended to be divided into the opening monologue, musical number, followed by a [[sketch comedy|skit]] or story routine. A \"feud\" between [[Fred Allen]] and [[Jack Benny]] was used as comic material for nearly a decade.\n\n[[Home Box Office|HBO]] presented comedians uncensored for the first time, beginning with [[Robert Klein]] in 1975, and was instrumental in reaching larger audiences. George Carlin was a perennial favorite, who appeared in 14 HBO comedy specials.\n\nContinuing that tradition, most modern stand-up comedians use television or motion pictures to reach a level of success and recognition unattainable in the comedy-club circuit alone.\n\nLate-night talk shows and award show ceremonies are commonly hosted by comedians, delivering monologues similar to stand-up.\n\nSince the mid-2000s, online video-sharing sites such as [[YouTube]] have also provided a venue for stand-up comedians, and many comedians' performances can be viewed online.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybits.com/watch-stand-up-comedians-on-youtube/|title=Watch Stand Up Comedians on YouTube|accessdate=2008-09-27 |work= Daniel Scocco |publisher=Dailybits.com |date=2008-09-23}}</ref>\n\nAn Amazon TV show, ''[[The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel]]'', depicts the fictional life of a woman comedian, set in the late 1950s.

The film received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised Jones' performance.<ref>{{cite web|title=On the Basis of Sex review roundup: What the critics are saying about the Felicity Jones-starring Ruth Bader Ginsburg biopic|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/on-the-basis-of-sex-review-roundup-felicity-jones-ruth-bader-ginsburg-biopic-a8693906.html|author=Jack Shepard|website=[[The Independent]]|date=December 21, 2018|accessdate=December 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n\n[[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] is a first-year student at [[Harvard Law School]]. When her husband [[Martin D. Ginsburg|Martin]], a second-year student, is diagnosed with [[testicular cancer]], she attends both her classes and his, taking notes and transcribing lectures while caring for Martin and their infant daughter [[Jane C. Ginsburg|Jane]]. Two years later, Martin, his cancer in remission, is hired by a firm in New York. Ruth petitions [[Erwin Griswold|Harvard Law School Dean Griswold]] to allow her to complete her Harvard law degree with classes at [[Columbia Law School]] in New York, but he insists on following [[Harvard University]] policies at the time and denies her request, so she transfers to Columbia. In spite of graduating at the top of her class, she is unable to find a position with a law firm because none of the firms she applies to want to hire a woman. She takes a job as a professor at [[Rutgers Law School]], teaching \"Sex Discrimination and the Law\".\n\nIn 1970, Martin brings ''[[Moritz v. Commissioner]]'', a tax law case, to Ruth's attention. Charles Moritz is a man from Denver who had to hire a nurse to help him care for his aging mother so he could continue to work. Moritz was denied a tax deduction for the nursing care because at the time Section 214 of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] specifically limited the deduction to \"a woman, a widower or divorc\u00e9e, or a husband whose wife is incapacitated or institutionalized\". The court ruled that Moritz, a man who had never married, did not qualify for the deduction. Ruth sees in this case an opportunity to begin to challenge the many laws enacted over the years that assume that men will work to provide for the family, and women will stay home and take care of the husband and children. She believes that if she could set a precedent ruling that a man was unfairly discriminated against on the basis of sex, that precedent could be cited in cases challenging laws that discriminate against women{{mdash}}and she believes that an appellate court composed entirely of male judges would find it easier to identify with a male appellant.\n\n[[File:Griswolderwin.jpg|thumb|left|In the film, Ruth Ginsburg left Harvard when Erwin Griswold as dean of Harvard Law School denied her request to complete her final courses at Columbia Law School.]]\nRuth meets with Mel Wulf of the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] to try to enlist their help, but he turns her down. Ruth flies to Denver to meet with Moritz, who agrees to let the Ginsburgs and ACLU represent him ''pro bono'' after Ruth convinces him that millions of people could potentially benefit.  After reading the draft of the brief, [[Dorothy Kenyon]], who was cold to the idea at first, meets with Wulf in his office and convinces him to sign on. The Ginsburgs and Wulf file an appeal of Moritz's denial with the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals]]. Department of Justice Attorney James H. Bozarth asks to be the lead counsel for the defense. He does a computer search to find all of the sections of the US Code that deal with gender. His defense will contend that, if section 214 is ruled unconstitutional, that will open the door to challenge all of America's gender-based laws. Ruth, having no courtroom experience, does poorly in a moot court, and Wulf convinces her to let Martin lead off arguing the tax law, with Ruth following up with [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|equal protection]] arguments.\n\nThe government offers Moritz a settlement of one dollar. Ruth makes a counter-proposal: the government will pay Moritz the sum he claimed as a deduction and make a declaration that he did nothing wrong, and also enter into the record that the gender-based portion of section 214 is unconstitutional. The government declines this proposal because of the constitutionality element. At the oral argument in the Court of Appeals, Martin takes more of their side's allotted time than he had intended. Ruth is nervous but makes several key points and reserves four minutes of her time for rebuttal. Bozarth frames his side's argument as defending the American way of life, implying that the Ginsburgs and ACLU want \"radical social change\" and maybe Moritz \"just doesn't want to pay his taxes\". In her rebuttal, Ruth is much more confident.  She states that societal roles that existed one hundred years ago, or even twenty years ago, no longer apply. She does not ask the court to change society, but to keep the law up with social change that has already taken place.  To a judge's objection that the Constitution does not contain the word \"woman\", she responds vigorously that neither does it contain the word \"freedom\".<ref>  \"Freedom of speech, or of the press\" appears in the First Amendment to the Constitution, which is not in the body of the text itself but in an amendment.  [[First Amendment#Text|First Amendment]].</ref>\n\nOutside the courthouse, judgment being reserved, Wulf, Moritz and the Ginsburgs celebrate that, win or lose, Ruth has finally found her voice as a lawyer. Titles over the closing scene indicate that the Court of Appeals found unanimously in Moritz's favor. Ruth went on to co-found the Women's Rights Project at the ACLU, which struck down many of the gender-based laws Bozarth identified, and in 1993 the Senate voted 96 to 3 for her to become an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. The final scene shows the real-life Ginsburg walking up the steps of the Supreme Court building.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Felicity Jones]] as [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as [[Martin D.

Directed by [[Mimi Leder]] and written by Daniel Stiepleman, it stars [[Felicity Jones]] as Ginsburg, with [[Armie Hammer]], [[Justin Theroux]], [[Jack Reynor]], [[Cailee Spaeny]], [[Sam Waterston]], and [[Kathy Bates]] in supporting roles. \n\nThe film had its world premiere at the [[AFI Fest]] on November 8, 2018, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 25, 2018, by [[Focus Features]]. The film received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised Jones' performance.<ref>{{cite web|title=On the Basis of Sex review roundup: What the critics are saying about the Felicity Jones-starring Ruth Bader Ginsburg biopic|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/on-the-basis-of-sex-review-roundup-felicity-jones-ruth-bader-ginsburg-biopic-a8693906.html|author=Jack Shepard|website=[[The Independent]]|date=December 21, 2018|accessdate=December 25, 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Plot ==\n\n[[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] is a first-year student at [[Harvard Law School]]. When her husband [[Martin D. Ginsburg|Martin]], a second-year student, is diagnosed with [[testicular cancer]], she attends both her classes and his, taking notes and transcribing lectures while caring for Martin and their infant daughter [[Jane C. Ginsburg|Jane]]. Two years later, Martin, his cancer in remission, is hired by a firm in New York. Ruth petitions [[Erwin Griswold|Harvard Law School Dean Griswold]] to allow her to complete her Harvard law degree with classes at [[Columbia Law School]] in New York, but he insists on following [[Harvard University]] policies at the time and denies her request, so she transfers to Columbia. In spite of graduating at the top of her class, she is unable to find a position with a law firm because none of the firms she applies to want to hire a woman. She takes a job as a professor at [[Rutgers Law School]], teaching \"Sex Discrimination and the Law\".\n\nIn 1970, Martin brings ''[[Moritz v. Commissioner]]'', a tax law case, to Ruth's attention. Charles Moritz is a man from Denver who had to hire a nurse to help him care for his aging mother so he could continue to work. Moritz was denied a tax deduction for the nursing care because at the time Section 214 of the [[Internal Revenue Code]] specifically limited the deduction to \"a woman, a widower or divorc\u00e9e, or a husband whose wife is incapacitated or institutionalized\". The court ruled that Moritz, a man who had never married, did not qualify for the deduction. Ruth sees in this case an opportunity to begin to challenge the many laws enacted over the years that assume that men will work to provide for the family, and women will stay home and take care of the husband and children. She believes that if she could set a precedent ruling that a man was unfairly discriminated against on the basis of sex, that precedent could be cited in cases challenging laws that discriminate against women{{mdash}}and she believes that an appellate court composed entirely of male judges would find it easier to identify with a male appellant.\n\n[[File:Griswolderwin.jpg|thumb|left|In the film, Ruth Ginsburg left Harvard when Erwin Griswold as dean of Harvard Law School denied her request to complete her final courses at Columbia Law School.]]\nRuth meets with Mel Wulf of the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]] to try to enlist their help, but he turns her down. Ruth flies to Denver to meet with Moritz, who agrees to let the Ginsburgs and ACLU represent him ''pro bono'' after Ruth convinces him that millions of people could potentially benefit.  After reading the draft of the brief, [[Dorothy Kenyon]], who was cold to the idea at first, meets with Wulf in his office and convinces him to sign on. The Ginsburgs and Wulf file an appeal of Moritz's denial with the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit|Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals]]. Department of Justice Attorney James H. Bozarth asks to be the lead counsel for the defense. He does a computer search to find all of the sections of the US Code that deal with gender. His defense will contend that, if section 214 is ruled unconstitutional, that will open the door to challenge all of America's gender-based laws. Ruth, having no courtroom experience, does poorly in a moot court, and Wulf convinces her to let Martin lead off arguing the tax law, with Ruth following up with [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|equal protection]] arguments.\n\nThe government offers Moritz a settlement of one dollar. Ruth makes a counter-proposal: the government will pay Moritz the sum he claimed as a deduction and make a declaration that he did nothing wrong, and also enter into the record that the gender-based portion of section 214 is unconstitutional. The government declines this proposal because of the constitutionality element. At the oral argument in the Court of Appeals, Martin takes more of their side's allotted time than he had intended. Ruth is nervous but makes several key points and reserves four minutes of her time for rebuttal. Bozarth frames his side's argument as defending the American way of life, implying that the Ginsburgs and ACLU want \"radical social change\" and maybe Moritz \"just doesn't want to pay his taxes\". In her rebuttal, Ruth is much more confident.  She states that societal roles that existed one hundred years ago, or even twenty years ago, no longer apply. She does not ask the court to change society, but to keep the law up with social change that has already taken place.  To a judge's objection that the Constitution does not contain the word \"woman\", she responds vigorously that neither does it contain the word \"freedom\".<ref>  \"Freedom of speech, or of the press\" appears in the First Amendment to the Constitution, which is not in the body of the text itself but in an amendment.  [[First Amendment#Text|First Amendment]].</ref>\n\nOutside the courthouse, judgment being reserved, Wulf, Moritz and the Ginsburgs celebrate that, win or lose, Ruth has finally found her voice as a lawyer. Titles over the closing scene indicate that the Court of Appeals found unanimously in Moritz's favor. Ruth went on to co-found the Women's Rights Project at the ACLU, which struck down many of the gender-based laws Bozarth identified, and in 1993 the Senate voted 96 to 3 for her to become an associate justice of the United States Supreme Court. The final scene shows the real-life Ginsburg walking up the steps of the Supreme Court building.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Felicity Jones]] as [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]]\n* [[Armie Hammer]] as [[Martin D.
