In 1913 the station building and the track work were rebuilt and extended.\n\nAfter the formation of the city of Wanne-Eickel in 1926, the station was renamed ''Wanne-Eickel Hauptbahnhof''. It became the largest marshalling yard in the central Ruhr area and the only station in the Ruhr that included all four forms of rail operations: in addition to its role as a marshalling yard, it was the home depot for over 300 locomotives along with associated rolling stock, a freight yard and a passenger station.\n\n==Current operations==\nWanne-Eickel Hauptbahnhof is a station of major traffic importance as a crossroads on the east-west Dortmund\u2013Duisburg line and the north-south M\u00fcnster\u2013Essen line, which among other things, is the beginning of the [[Wanne-Eickel\u2013Hamburg railway|Rollbahn]] (rolling railway) to [[Hamburg]]. In addition, the station is located on the [[Duisburg-Ruhrort\u2013Dortmund railway|Emscher Valley Railway]] (Dortmund\u2013Wanne-Eickel\u2013Dorsten) and the Bochum\u2013Gelsenkirchen Railway (also known as the ''Gl\u00fcckauf-Bahn''\u2014 a reference to [[Gl\u00fcck auf]], the traditional German miners greeting). Part of the old marshalling yard still operates with shunting from west to east over a hump, but other freight operations are closed.\n\nFollowing the merger of the cities of Herne and Wanne-Eickel in 1975 the name of the station remained as Wanne\u2013Eickel Hauptbahnhof, although it is the largest station in the city of Herne on its current boundaries. In 2003, [[Deutsche Bahn]] planned to rename it ''Herne-Wanne'' or ''Herne Hauptbahnhof''.

To the scenic attractions belong the River [[Danube]] including the Donaudurchbruch at Weltenburg and the [[Bavarian Forest]] with Mount [[Gro\u00dfer Arber]].\n\n== History ==\nThe Duchy of Lower Bavaria was created for the first time with the ''First Bavarian [[Partition (politics)|partition]]'' in 1255 under duke [[Henry XIII, Duke of Bavaria|Henry]] but there was no exact identity with the current territory. After the reunification in 1340, Bavaria was divided again in 1349, then in 1353 [[Bavaria-Straubing]] and [[Bavaria-Landshut]] were created in Lower Bavaria. In 1505 Bavaria was permanently reunited. For administrative purposes, Bavaria was split into ''Rent\u00e4mter'' (plural of ''{{ill|Rentamt|bar||de||es|Mayordom\u00eda}}''). Lower Bavaria consisted of the Rentamt Landshut and Rentamt Straubing.\n\nAfter the founding of the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] following the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1805, the state was totally reorganized and, in 1808, divided into 15 administrative districts(German: Regierungsbezirke (singular Regierungsbezirk)), in Bavaria called Kreise (singular: Kreis). They were created in the fashion of the French departements, quite even in size and population, and named after their main rivers. In the following years, due to territorial changes (e. g. loss of [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]] [to [[Italy]] and [[Austria]]], addition of the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]]), the number of districts was reduced to 8. One of these was the [[Unterdonaukreis]] (Lower Danube District). In 1837, King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] renamed the Kreise after historical territorial names and tribes. This also involved border changes or territorial swaps. Thus the Unterdonaukreis changed to Lower Bavaria. The district capital was moved from [[Passau]] to [[Landshut]] which was added from [[Isarkreis]].\n\nLower Bavaria and [[Upper Palatinate]] were consolidated in 1932 in one administrative district. In 1954 the two districts were restored again. In 1972 Lower Bavaria was reshaped when the rural districts covered were reshaped too.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.regierung.niederbayern.bayern.de Official website of government] {{in lang|de}}\n*[http://www.bezirk-niederbayern.de Official website of region] {{in lang|de|fr}}\n\n{{Regierungsbezirk (Bavaria)}}\n\n{{coord|48|31|N|12|09|E|type:adm2nd_source:itwiki|display=title}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Lower Bavaria| ]]\n[[Category:NUTS 2 statistical regions of the European Union]]\n[[Category:Government regions of Germany]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n<!-- See Template:Infobox settlement for additional fields and descriptions -->\n| name                    = Lower Bavaria\n| native_name             = Niederbayern\n| native_name_lang        = de\n| settlement_type         = [[Regierungsbezirk]]\n| image_map               = Locator map RB Niederbayern in Bavaria.svg\n| map_caption             = Map of [[Bavaria]] highlighting Lower Bavaria\n| coordinates             = \n| coor_pinpoint           = \n| coordinates_footnotes   = \n| subdivision_type        = Country\n| subdivision_name        = [[Germany]]\n| subdivision_type1       = [[States of Germany|State]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Bavaria]]\n| established_title       = \n| established_date        = \n| extinct_title           = Disestablished\n| extinct_date            = \n| seat_type               = Region seat\n| seat                    = [[Landshut]]\n| area_total_km2          = 10329.87\n| population_footnotes    = {{#tag:ref| {{Population Germany|key=092|datref=QUELLE}} }}\n| population_total        = {{Population Germany|key=092 }}\n| population_as_of        = {{#time:j F Y|{{Population Germany|key=092|datref=STAND}} }} \n| population_density_km2  = auto\n| website                 = [http://www.regierung.niederbayern.bayern.de regierung.niederbayern.bayern.de]\n}} \n[[File:Wappen Bezirk Niederbayern.svg|thumb|Coat of arms of Lower Bavaria]]\n'''Lower Bavaria''' ({{lang-de|Niederbayern}}) is one of the seven [[Regierungsbezirk|administrative region]]s of [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]], located in the east of the state.\n\n== Geography ==\nLower Bavaria is subdivided into two regions ({{lang|de|Planungsverband}}) \u2013 Landshut and Donau-Wald.

To the scenic attractions belong the River [[Danube]] including the Donaudurchbruch at Weltenburg and the [[Bavarian Forest]] with Mount [[Gro\u00dfer Arber]].\n\n== History ==\nThe Duchy of Lower Bavaria was created for the first time with the ''First Bavarian [[Partition (politics)|partition]]'' in 1255 under duke [[Henry XIII, Duke of Bavaria|Henry]] but there was no exact identity with the current territory. After the reunification in 1340, Bavaria was divided again in 1349, then in 1353 [[Bavaria-Straubing]] and [[Bavaria-Landshut]] were created in Lower Bavaria. In 1505 Bavaria was permanently reunited. For administrative purposes, Bavaria was split into ''Rent\u00e4mter'' (plural of ''{{ill|Rentamt|bar||de||es|Mayordom\u00eda}}''). Lower Bavaria consisted of the Rentamt Landshut and Rentamt Straubing.\n\nAfter the founding of the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] following the dissolution of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] in 1805, the state was totally reorganized and, in 1808, divided into 15 administrative districts(German: Regierungsbezirke (singular Regierungsbezirk)), in Bavaria called Kreise (singular: Kreis). They were created in the fashion of the French departements, quite even in size and population, and named after their main rivers. In the following years, due to territorial changes (e. g. loss of [[German Tyrol|Tyrol]] [to [[Italy]] and [[Austria]]], addition of the [[Palatinate (region)|Palatinate]]), the number of districts was reduced to 8. One of these was the [[Unterdonaukreis]] (Lower Danube District). In 1837, King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]] renamed the Kreise after historical territorial names and tribes. This also involved border changes or territorial swaps. Thus the Unterdonaukreis changed to Lower Bavaria. The district capital was moved from [[Passau]] to [[Landshut]] which was added from [[Isarkreis]].\n\nLower Bavaria and [[Upper Palatinate]] were consolidated 1932 in one administrative district. In 1954 the two districts were restored again. In 1972 Lower Bavaria was reshaped when the rural districts covered were reshaped, too.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.regierung.niederbayern.bayern.de Official website of government] {{in lang|de}}\n*[http://www.bezirk-niederbayern.de Official website of region] {{in lang|de|fr}}\n\n{{Regierungsbezirk (Bavaria)}}\n\n{{coord|48|31|N|12|09|E|type:adm2nd_source:itwiki|display=title}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Lower Bavaria| ]]\n[[Category:NUTS 2 statistical regions of the European Union]]\n[[Category:Government regions of Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Chrism", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lower_Bavaria"}

ALIT denied receiving the payment claiming that the entire amount was paid to the China National Electronics Import & Export Corporation (CEIEC) as had ALIT left the project.

Answers provided by Iran regarding the past P-1 and P-2 centrifuge programs were found to be consistent with the IAEA's own findings. However, Iran has ignored the demands of the UN Security council, and has continued to enrich uranium in the past year. The IAEA is not able to conclusively confirm that Iran isn't currently enriching uranium for military purposes, as its inspections have been restricted to workshops previously declared as part of the civilian uranium enrichment program, and requests for access to certain military workshops have been denied; the report noted that \"As a result, the agency's knowledge about Iran's current nuclear program is diminishing\". The report also confirmed that Iran now possesses 3000 centrifuges, a 10-fold increase over the past year, though the feed rate is below the maximum for a facility of this design. Data regarding the P-2 centrifuge, which Ahmadinejad has claimed will quadruple production of enriched uranium, was provided only several days before the report was published; the IAEA plan to discuss this issue further in December.

Iran claims that nuclear power is necessary for a booming population and rapidly industrialising nation. It points to the fact that Iran's population has more than doubled in 20 years, the country regularly imports gasoline and electricity, and that burning fossil fuel in large amounts harms Iran's environment drastically. Additionally, Iran questions why it shouldn't be allowed to diversify its sources of energy, especially when there are fears of its oil fields eventually being depleted. It continues to argue that its valuable oil should be used for high value products and export, not simple electricity generation. Furthermore, Iran argues that nuclear power makes fairly good economic sense. Building reactors is expensive, but subsequent operating costs are low and stable, and increasingly competitive as fossil-fuel prices rise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_SJSTTNV&CFID=95062603&CFTOKEN=c91bea-f43e23b8-577e-4e51-80d2-e8f667401fe4 |title=Egypt & Nuclear Power |work=The Economist  |accessdate=23 November 2011 |date=28 September 2006}}</ref> Iran also raises funding questions, claiming that developing the excess capacity in its oil industry would cost it $40 billion, not to speak of paying for the power plants.

However, Iran has ignored the demands of the UN Security council, and has continued to enrich uranium in the past year. The IAEA is not able to conclusively confirm that Iran isn't currently enriching uranium for military purposes, as its inspections have been restricted to workshops previously declared as part of the civilian uranium enrichment program, and requests for access to certain military workshops have been denied; the report noted that \"As a result, the agency's knowledge about Iran's current nuclear program is diminishing\". The report also confirmed that Iran now possesses 3000 centrifuges, a 10-fold increase over the past year, though the feed rate is below the maximum for a facility of this design.

It points to the fact that Iran's population has more than doubled in 20 years, the country regularly imports gasoline and electricity, and that burning fossil fuel in large amounts harms Iran's environment drastically. Additionally, Iran questions why it shouldn't be allowed to diversify its sources of energy, especially when there are fears of its oil fields eventually being depleted. It continues to argue that its valuable oil should be used for high value products and export, not simple electricity generation. Furthermore, Iran argues that nuclear power makes fairly good economic sense. Building reactors is expensive, but subsequent operating costs are low and stable, and increasingly competitive as fossil-fuel prices rise.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/africa/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_SJSTTNV&CFID=95062603&CFTOKEN=c91bea-f43e23b8-577e-4e51-80d2-e8f667401fe4 |title=Egypt & Nuclear Power |work=The Economist  |accessdate=23 November 2011 |date=28 September 2006}}</ref> Iran also raises funding questions, claiming that developing the excess capacity in its oil industry would cost it $40 billion, not to speak of paying for the power plants.

The show ran for six episodes from March 28 until its cancellation on May 2, 2006. Loosely based upon a [[Teachers (UK TV series)|2001 UK series of the same name]], it was developed by Matt Tarses, co-executive producer of the medical comedy ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''.\n\n==Characters==\nSet in [[New Jersey]], ''Teachers'' stars [[Justin Bartha]] as Jeff Cahill, a skilled, irreverent young [[English studies|English]] teacher at the fictitious Filmore [[High school|High School]], whose apparent apathy toward his job masks his actual wisdom concerning teaching at an underfunded school. [[Sarah Alexander]] co-stars as idealistic [[United Kingdom|British]] [[history]] teacher Alice Fletcher, his only kindred spirit on the faculty, for whom Jeff also has romantic feelings. Alice does not reciprocate these feelings, but she is becoming fonder of him. Radio personality [[Phil Hendrie]] plays Dick Green, an apathetic phys-ed and physics teacher, who spends his afternoons  behind the gym. [[Deon Richmond]] plays Calvin Babbitt, the drama teacher whose attitude about teaching falls somewhere between Jeff's and Alice's.  He often gets caught up in Jeff's schemes. [[Kali Rocha]] stars as the uncaring, rule-abiding [[Principal (school)|Principal]] Emma Wiggins. [[Matt Winston]] stars as Mitch Lenk, a math teacher and [[lap dog]] to Principal Wiggins. It is implied that he is romantically interested in her. [[Sarah Shahi]] stars as Tina Torres, an attractive teacher from [[Mexico]]. She is Alice's possible rival for Jeff's affections, though it seems Jeff prefers Alice.

The show ran for six episodes from March 28 until its cancellation on May 2, 2006. Loosely based upon a [[Teachers (UK TV series)|2001 UK series of the same name]], it was developed by Matt Tarses, co-executive producer of the medical comedy ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''.\n\n==Characters==\nSet in [[New Jersey]], ''Teachers'' stars [[Justin Bartha]] as Jeff Cahill, a skilled, irreverent young [[English studies|English]] teacher at the fictitious Filmore [[High school|High School]], whose apparent apathy toward his job masks his actual wisdom concerning teaching at an underfunded school. [[Sarah Alexander]] co-stars as idealistic [[United Kingdom|British]] [[history]] teacher Alice Fletcher, his only kindred spirit on the faculty, for whom Jeff also has romantic feelings. Alice does not reciprocate these feelings, but she is becoming fonder of him. Radio personality [[Phil Hendrie]] plays Dick Green, an apathetic phys-ed and physics teacher, who spends his afternoons  behind the gym. [[Deon Richmond]] plays Calvin Babbitt, the drama teacher whose attitude about teaching falls somewhere between Jeff's and Alice's.  He often gets caught up in Jeff's schemes. [[Kali Rocha]] stars as the uncaring, rule-abiding [[Principal (school)|Principal]] Emma Wiggins. [[Matt Winston]] stars as Mitch Lenk, a math teacher and [[lap dog]] to Principal Wiggins. It is implied that he is romantically interested in her. [[Sarah Shahi]] stars as Tina Torres, an attractive teacher from [[Mexico]]. She is Alice's possible rival for Jeff's affections, though it seems Jeff prefers Alice. It is revealed in Episode 05 (\"Testing 1-2-3\") that she does not have her teaching [[license]], having gone to school, but taking jobs before she took her [[Final examination|finals]]. However, she stated later in the episode that she will be taking them.\n\n==Production==\nLike many American sitcoms, ''Teachers'' was shot before a studio audience.\n\nThe series began development under the title ''Filmore Middle'', which reflected its original [[middle school]] setting.\n\nThough adapted for American television by Matt Tarses, a writer and producer of the critically lauded series ''[[Sports Night]]'' and ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', ''Teachers'' was panned by many critics (including the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'''s Tim Goodman) as unoriginal and clich\u00e9d.

It is owned by [[Radio One (Company)|Radio One]] and airs an [[urban adult contemporary]] [[radio format]]. In afternoon [[drive time]], WRNB carries the [[radio syndication|syndicated]] [[D. L. Hughley]] Show.\n\nWRNB's studios and offices are located in [[Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania|Bala Cynwyd]], with the transmitter located in the Roxborough neighborhood of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] at ({{coord|40|02|36.0|N|75|14|32.0|W}}).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://transition.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=WRNB |title=FM Query Results for WRNB |website=fcc.gov |publisher=[[Federal Communications Commission]] |accessdate=2018-05-10}}</ref> The station is short-spaced with two other co-channel FM stations (see [[WRNB#Signal note|See &sect; Signal note]] below).\n\n==History==\n===Early Years===\nIn the 1940s, 100.3 FM first went on the air in Philadelphia as '''KYW-FM''', the [[sister station]] to [[KYW (AM)|KYW]]. KYW-FM later moved to 92.5 MHz. In 1962, '''WXUR-FM''' [[sign-on|signed on]], licensed to the suburban community of Media.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1968/B%202%20Broadcasting%20Yearbook%201968.pdf Broadcasting Yearbook 1968 page B-140]</ref> It was powered at only 4,200 watts, [[simulcast]]ing the [[Christian radio|Christian programming]] of its sister station WXUR (now [[WPHE]] in [[Phoenixville, Pennsylvania]]). WXUR-AM-FM were owned by [[Carl McIntire]], a [[Bible Presbyterian Church|Bible Presbyterian]] minister. In 1973, the [[Federal Communications Commission]] revoked the licenses for both stations, with the FCC ruling that WXUR-AM-FM violated the [[Fairness Doctrine]], refusing to air competing viewpoints. The 100.3 frequency then went [[Dark (broadcasting)|dark]] for eight years. \n\n===WKSZ Kiss 100===\nIn 1981, after a seven-year comparative hearing, the FCC awarded the license to the Greater Media Radio Company, owned by Daniel Lerner. The name referred to the station's city of license, Media, and was not associated with the larger [[Greater Media]], Inc., which locally owned [[WMGK]], [[WKDN (AM)|WPEN]] and other stations around the U.S. On November 8, 1982, 100.3 FM returned to the air, this time as '''WKSZ''', \"Kiss 100,\" with a [[soft adult contemporary]] format.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1983/B-Radio-Neb-Terr-1983-YB.pdf Broadcasting Yearbook 1983 page B-208]</ref> By 1987, Kiss 100 was the #1 Arbitron-ranked station among women ages 25 to 54. \n\nIn the early 1990s, however, the battle for AC listeners heated up, with WEAZ (now [[WBEB]]) becoming the dominant station for soft music in Philadelphia. Kiss 100 lost ground in the ratings, falling to 17th place in 1992. WKSZ tried to combine AC and [[oldies]] with what the station called the \"50/50 Mix.\" This failed to turn ratings around, and in 1993, Kiss 100 returned to a [[playlist]] of AC love songs.\n\n===WPLY as Y100===\nOn March 15, 1993, at 6 a.m., with the station still struggling, WKSZ became \"Z100,\" flipping to a [[contemporary hit radio|Top 40]] format. The flip came three days after [[WISX|Eagle 106]] gave up Top 40 and switched to [[smooth jazz]], creating an opening which WKSZ hoped to fill. New York's [[WHTZ]], located on the same frequency of 100.3 MHz, and calling itself \"Z100\" since 1983, demanded that WKSZ drop the name to avoid listener confusion. After a brief legal battle, the call letters and name were changed to '''WPLY''', \"Y100.\" The station initially had a slight [[alternative rock]] lean, but still played other Top 40 hits, including pop and dance. By early 1995, WPLY evolved into a full time [[modern rock]] format, which lasted nearly ten years.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1996/B-NE-Ter-BC-YB-1996.pdf Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1996 page B-359]</ref> Through the late 1990s, Y100 leaned towards [[Modern AC]], and would shift towards an [[active rock]] lean in 2000. \n\nIn 2000, the station was bought by [[Radio One (Company)|Radio One]] for $80 million.<ref>[http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/2001/D-Radio-NE-TER-BC-YB-2001.pdf Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook page D-385]</ref> Radio One focuses mostly on urban music and didn't plan to program an alternative rock station. The company tried to make a deal to swap formats with [[Greater Media]]'s WEJM (now [[WBEN-FM]]), which, at the time, ran a [[rhythmic oldies]] format called \"Jammin Gold,\" which would have better fit into Radio One's portfolio. The deal fell through, and Radio One continued to run Y100 as a modern rock station for nearly five years. While ratings had gone down, the station still was moderately successful.\n\n===Switch with 103.9===\nOn February 24, [[2005 in radio|2005]], at 11:50 p.m., Y100 ended its alternative rock format. '''WPHI''', an [[urban contemporary]] station at 103.9 MHz, also owned by Radio One and known as \"103.9 The Beat,\" moved to 100.3 FM. The station at 103.9, in turn, flipped to [[urban gospel]] as [[WPHI|WPPZ-FM]], \"Praise 103.9.\" The last song on \"Y100\" was \"[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]\" by [[Pearl Jam]] (which was also the first and last song on [[WPPZ|WDRE]]).<ref>https://mycitypaper.com/articles/2005-03-31/cover.shtml</ref><ref>[http://formatchange.com/y100-announces-format-change/ Y100 Announces Format Change]</ref><ref>[http://formatchange.com/y100-1003-wply-signs-off/ Y100 Signs Off]</ref> By [[2006 in radio|2006]], [[Nielsen BDS]]/[[Radio & Records]] moved WPHI to the [[urban contemporary]] panel. [[Mediabase]] followed suit in [[2011 in radio|2011]]. WPHI-FM's chief rival was [[WUSL]], which had been Philadelphia's long-time Urban Contemporary leader.\n\nIn fall 2005, former rival personality Colby Colb was hired as the Program Director and afternoon host. For the next few years, 100.3 The Beat enjoyed high ratings, helped by Miss Jones in the morning and Colby Colb in the afternoon. Monie Love and Pooch took over mornings in 2005, with other [[disc jockey]]s on the station including Micheal Shawn, DJ Touchtone, DJ Jay Ski, Megatron, DJ Bent Rock, Moshay, Toshamakia, DJ JDS, Laiya and Hansoul. In late 2010, WPHI-FM became the Philadelphia home of the Star and Buc Wild Morning Show, [[radio syndication|syndicated]] from [[New York City]]. The show had actually been heard in Philadelphia in early 2006 on WUSL but had drawn some controversy and was dropped. \n\n===Switch with 107.9===\n[[File:100.3 WRNB.png|thumb|175px|Logo as \"100.3 WRNB\" from 2011-2013]]\nOn August 27, [[2011 in radio|2011]], WPHI dropped the \"Beat\" moniker for \"100.3 Philly.\" Radio One was preparing to make another frequency switch, this time moving 107.9 '''WRNB''' to 100.3 MHz on September 1st.<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/netgnomes/53262/107-9-wrnb-philadelphia-to-move-to-100-3-on-september-1/ 107.9 WRNB to Move to 100.3 on September 1]</ref><ref>[http://formatchange.com/100-3-the-beat-becomes-wrnb/ 100.3 The Beat Becomes WRNB]</ref> WRNB was simulcast on both 100.3 and 107.9 until September 2nd, when the WPHI call letters moved to 107.9, adopted the former \"Beat\" format and rebranded as \"Hot 107.9.\" (WRNB would continue to air an Urban AC format after the move.)\n\n===Urban Oldies===\n[[File:Oldschool1003.png|thumb|Logo as \"Old School 100.3\" from 2013-2016]]\nOn March 29, 2013, WRNB went jockless and began promoting a \"big announcement\" at 5 p.m. on April 1st. At that time, after playing \"[[Keep Your Head to the Sky]]\" by [[Earth, Wind, & Fire]], WRNB flipped to [[urban oldies]] as \"Old School 100.3.\" The first song on \"Old School\" was \"[[Atomic Dog]]\" by [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]].<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/netgnomes/81395/wrnb-philadelphia-going-old-school/ WRNB Going Old School]</ref><ref>[http://formatchange.com/wrnb-goes-old-school/ WRNB Flips to Old School]</ref> \n\nThe format played [[Motown]], [[disco]], [[funk]], [[new jack swing]], [[freestyle music|freestyle]], and early [[hip hop]] from the 1960s to the early 2000s. The new format was designed to better compete with the dominant Urban AC station in Philadelphia, [[WDAS-FM]].\n\nIn November 2014, sister station [[WPHI-FM|WPHI]] moved to a [[classic hip-hop]] format. In response, WRNB re-added some current music, although the station continued to focus on older urban hits.\n\n===Return to Urban AC===\nOn October 6, 2016, WRNB moved back to [[urban adult contemporary]] music, once more calling itself \"100.3 WRNB,\" and dropping the \"Old School\" reference.<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/108592/wrnb-drops-old-school-100-3-branding/ WRNB Drops Old School 100.3 Branding] Radioinsight - October 6, 2016</ref>\n[[File:WRNB.png|thumb|Logo as \"100.3 WRNB\" from 2016-2020]]\n\n===History of WRNB Call Letters===\nBeginning in the 1950s, the call sign WRNB was licensed to [[North Carolina]]'s first full-time [[rock 'n roll]] radio station, a 1000-watt outlet in [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] located at [[AM 1490]] (now [[sports radio]] [[WWNB]]).

The station at 103.9, in turn, flipped to [[urban gospel]] as [[WPHI|WPPZ-FM]], \"Praise 103.9.\" The last song on \"Y100\" was \"[[Alive (Pearl Jam song)|Alive]]\" by [[Pearl Jam]] (which was also the first and last song on [[WPPZ|WDRE]]).<ref>https://mycitypaper.com/articles/2005-03-31/cover.shtml</ref><ref>[http://formatchange.com/y100-announces-format-change/ Y100 Announces Format Change]</ref><ref>[http://formatchange.com/y100-1003-wply-signs-off/ Y100 Signs Off]</ref> By [[2006 in radio|2006]], [[Nielsen BDS]]/[[Radio & Records]] moved WPHI to the [[urban contemporary]] panel. [[Mediabase]] followed suit in [[2011 in radio|2011]]. WPHI-FM's chief rival was [[WUSL]], which had been Philadelphia's long-time Urban Contemporary leader.\n\nIn fall 2005, former rival personality Colby Colb was hired as the Program Director and afternoon host. For the next few years, 100.3 The Beat enjoyed high ratings, helped by Miss Jones in the morning and Colby Colb in the afternoon. Monie Love and Pooch took over mornings in 2005, with other [[disc jockey]]s on the station including Micheal Shawn, DJ Touchtone, DJ Jay Ski, Megatron, DJ Bent Rock, Moshay, Toshamakia, DJ JDS, Laiya and Hansoul. In late 2010, WPHI-FM became the Philadelphia home of the Star and Buc Wild Morning Show, [[radio syndication|syndicated]] from [[New York City]]. The show had actually been heard in Philadelphia in early 2006 on WUSL but had drawn some controversy and was dropped. \n\n===Switch with 107.9===\n[[File:100.3 WRNB.png|thumb|175px|Logo as \"100.3 WRNB\" from 2011-2013]]\nOn August 27, [[2011 in radio|2011]], WPHI dropped the \"Beat\" moniker for \"100.3 Philly.\" Radio One was preparing to make another frequency switch, this time moving 107.9 '''WRNB''' to 100.3 MHz on September 1st.<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/netgnomes/53262/107-9-wrnb-philadelphia-to-move-to-100-3-on-september-1/ 107.9 WRNB to Move to 100.3 on September 1]</ref><ref>[http://formatchange.com/100-3-the-beat-becomes-wrnb/ 100.3 The Beat Becomes WRNB]</ref> WRNB was simulcast on both 100.3 and 107.9 until September 2nd, when the WPHI call letters moved to 107.9, adopted the former \"Beat\" format and rebranded as \"Hot 107.9.\" (WRNB would continue to air an Urban AC format after the move.)\n\n===Urban Oldies===\n[[File:Oldschool1003.png|thumb|Logo as \"Old School 100.3\" from 2013-2016]]\nOn March 29, 2013, WRNB went jockless and began promoting a \"big announcement\" at 5 p.m. on April 1st. At that time, after playing \"[[Keep Your Head to the Sky]]\" by [[Earth, Wind, & Fire]], WRNB flipped to [[urban oldies]] as \"Old School 100.3.\" The first song on \"Old School\" was \"[[Atomic Dog]]\" by [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]].<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/netgnomes/81395/wrnb-philadelphia-going-old-school/ WRNB Going Old School]</ref><ref>[http://formatchange.com/wrnb-goes-old-school/ WRNB Flips to Old School]</ref> \n\nThe format played [[Motown]], [[disco]], [[funk]], [[new jack swing]], [[freestyle music|freestyle]], and early [[hip hop]] from the 1960s to the early 2000s. The new format was designed to better compete with the dominant Urban AC station in Philadelphia, [[WDAS-FM]].\n\nIn November 2014, sister station [[WPHI-FM|WPHI]] moved to a [[classic hip-hop]] format. In response, WRNB re-added some current music, although the station continued to focus on older urban hits.\n\n===Return to Urban AC===\nOn October 6, 2016, WRNB moved back to [[urban adult contemporary]] music, once more calling itself \"100.3 WRNB,\" and dropping the \"Old School\" reference.<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/108592/wrnb-drops-old-school-100-3-branding/ WRNB Drops Old School 100.3 Branding] Radioinsight - October 6, 2016</ref>\n[[File:WRNB.png|thumb|Logo as \"100.3 WRNB\" from 2016-2020]]\n\n===History of WRNB Call Letters===\nBeginning in the 1950s, the call sign WRNB was licensed to [[North Carolina]]'s first full-time [[rock 'n roll]] radio station, a 1000-watt outlet in [[New Bern, North Carolina|New Bern]] located at [[AM 1490]] (now [[sports radio]] [[WWNB]]).
