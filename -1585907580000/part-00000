Salcido's disparaging remarks about U.S. servicemen attracted widespread local, statewide and nationwide media attention. The video, which was laced with profanity, caused a nationwide furor, with people across the country calling for Salcido's termination by the [[El Rancho Unified School District]] and removal from the Pico Rivera City Council.

One counselor told investigators that they had to move over 25 students from Salcido's classes over the years for the students' well-being, due to berating behavior from Salcido.

One counselor told investigators that they had to move over 25 students from Salcido's classes over the years for the students' well-being, due to berating behavior from Salcido.

This [[unicameral]] body was composed of the upper House of Nobles and the lower House of Representatives. This would be the first session during the reign of Queen [[Liliuokalani|Lili\u02bbuokalani]] and the last meeting of the legislative assembly during the Hawaiian monarchy. Three days after the prorogation of the assembly, many of the political tension developed during the legislative debates and the queen's attempt to promulgate a new constitution while her legislators were not in session led to the [[overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom]] on January 17, 1893.\n\nMembers of this legislative session included citizens and subjects of the kingdom of either full or mixed [[Native Hawaiian]], Euro-American and Asian descent, who were divided across different party lines. They included the insurgents who would play an eventual role in the deposition of the queen, and also the political resistance leaders who would lead the [[Opposition to the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom|opposition to the overthrow]] and attempts to annex the Hawaiian Islands to the United States.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Bayonet Constitution political cartoon 1887.jpg|thumb|Political cartoon depicting the ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' which resulted in the signing of the Bayonet Constitution, 1887]]\nIn 1887, King [[Kal\u0101kaua]] was forced to sign the [[Bayonet Constitution]] under duress by the [[Hawaiian League]], a group of foreign businessman and Hawaiian subjects of American missionary descent including [[Lorrin A. Thurston]]. This constitution limited the absolute power of the monarch and strengthened the power of the executive cabinet. It also raised property requirements for suffrage, disenfranchised many poor Native Hawaiians and naturalized Asian citizens, and gave the vote to unnaturalized foreign residents of European or American descent. It also changed membership in the House of Nobles, the upper house of the legislature, from life appointments by the king to elected offices for the first time. A new cabinet headed by Thurston was imposed on the king and the king's previous administration headed by [[Walter Murray Gibson]] was ousted.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=344\u2013372}}\n\nThe instigators of this ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' formed the [[Reform Party (Hawaii)|Reform Party]], drawing its memberships from Hawaiian conservatives and citizens of foreign descent, and won the majority of the seats in the legislature in the election of 1887, which was mandated by the new constitution.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=406\u2013410}}{{sfn|Osorio|2002|pages=238, 245\u2013248}} In the election of 1890, the [[Hui K\u0101lai\u02bb\u0101ina]] (Hawaiian Political Association) and the Mechanics' and Workingmen's Political Protective Union joined together to form the [[National Reform Party (Hawaii)|National Reform Party]] in opposition to the Reform Party in this session. The Reform Party lost their majority control in the legislature and the Thurston cabinet was removed by a legislative vote of want of confidence.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=448\u2013455, 460\u2013460}}\n\nFollowing the [[wikt:prorogation#Noun|prorogation]] of the legislature of 1890, King Kalakaua died while in [[San Francisco]] and was succeeded by his sister Queen [[Liliuokalani|Lili\u02bbuokalani]] on January 29, 1891.<ref>{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=474\u2013475}}</ref>\n\n==Election of 1892==\n\nThe general election of 1892 proved the most contentious. The four major parties were the Reform, National Reform, National Liberal, and the Native Sons of Hawaii which ran the same candidates as the National Reformers. The National Reform Party became the administration or governmental party and gained the personal support of the new queen. They joined with the Reformers and Native Sons in opposing the more radical elements of the National Liberal. The National Liberal Party, which became the party of the opposition, advocated for increased Native Hawaiian participation in the government and a constitutional convention to draft a new constitution to replace the unpopular Bayonet Constitution. However, the Liberals soon became divided between radicals and more conciliatory groups. [[Joseph N\u0101wah\u012b]] and [[William P\u016bnohu White]] became the leaders of the factions of the Liberals loyal to the queen against the more radical members led by [[John E. Bush (politician)|John E. Bush]] and [[Robert William Wilcox]], who were advocating for drastic changes such as increased power for the people and a republican form of government.<ref>{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=514\u2013522, 547, 554\u2013555}}</ref>\n\nThe election resulted in a divided legislature, although the conservatives painted it as a victory for their coalition. It was hard to tell where the exact loyalty of many of the elected nobles and representatives lay because of internal disagreement. According to historian [[Ralph S. Kuykendall]], \"the party composition of the 1892 legislature (the forty-eight elected members) appeared to be: Reform Party, twenty-three; Liberal Party, thirteen; National Reform Party, nine; Independent, three\".{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|page=521}}\n\n==Legislative Session==\nFrom May 28, 1892, to January 14, 1893, the legislature of the Kingdom convened for an unprecedented 171 days, which later historians such as [[Albertine Loomis]] and [[Helena G. Allen]] dubbed the \"Longest Legislature\".<ref name=\"Longest\" /> This would be the first session during the reign of Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani and the last meeting of the legislative assembly during the Hawaiian monarchy.<ref name=\"Longest\">{{harvnb|Loomis|1963|pages=7\u201327}}; {{harvnb|Allen|1982|pages=269\u2013270}}</ref>\n\nAt the opening of the legislature, forty-eight elected politicians, consisting of twenty-four nobles (including thirteen holdovers continued their terms from the 1890 legislature) and twenty-four representatives from the four main Hawaiian Islands met at the legislative halls of [[Aliiolani Hale|Ali\u02bbi\u014dlani Hale]] in Honolulu. The legislature met as a [[unicameral]] body composed of the upper House of Nobles and the lower House of Representatives with Noble [[John Smith Walker]] presiding as President of the Legislative Assembly and Noble [[John Kauhane]] as Vice-President. The body included politicians of Native Hawaiian descent, Euro-American descent, mixed Hawaiian and Euro-American descent, and even three members of Chinese-Hawaiian descent. The appointed cabinet ministers also had the right to participate as ex-officio members of the legislature with the right to vote on all matters except on votes for their removal. In the course of the session, five members would resign and three new members chosen in special elections to replace with two of the five members reclaiming their vacated seats.<ref>{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|page=521}}; {{harvnb|Hawaii|Lydecker|1918|page=182}}</ref>\n\nThis session was dominated by political infighting within and between and the different parties. Debates heard on the floor of the houses concerned the popular demand for a new constitution, the passage of a lottery bill and an opium licensing bill, aimed at alleviating the economic crisis caused by the [[McKinley Tariff]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=523\u2013581}}; {{harvnb|Loomis|1963|pages=7\u201327}}</ref> By the end of the session, the queen had also signed into law the lottery bill and opium licensing bill, which were extremely controversial in the foreign community and especially with the leaders of the Reform Party.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=543\u2013545, 574\u2013581}}\n\nPetitions asking for a new constitution were submitted by seven legislators: Noble [[David William Pua]] and Representatives [[Joseph N\u0101wah\u012b]], [[William P\u016bnohu White]], [[Jose Kekahuna Iosepa]], [[Anakalea Kauhi]], [[T. S. Nahinu]], [[Luther W. P.

Both National Liberals and National Reformers campaigned on the promise of a new constitution, however many National Reformers supported a middle path and advocated for changes via amendments. The conservative Reformers would not tolerate any changes to the existing constitution. There was also disagreement on the legality of how to execute the change. No clear comparable precedents existed, since previous constitutions had been promulgated by the sovereign.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=461\u2013465, 547\u2013548, 575\u2013576}}\n\nThe main issue of contention between the new monarch and the legislators was the retention of her cabinet ministers; political division prevented Lili\u02bbuokalani from appointing a balanced council. The 1887 constitution retained the monarch's right to appoint her own cabinet minister but gave the legislature the power to vote for the dismissal of her cabinet.<ref>{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=549\u2013559}}</ref> \nSeven resolutions of want of confidence were introduced during this session, and four of her self-appointed cabinets (the [[Hermann A. Widemann|Widemann]], [[Edward C. Macfarlane|Macfarlane]], [[William H. Cornwell|Cornwell]], and  [[George Norton Wilcox|Wilcox]] cabinets) were ousted by votes of the legislature.<ref>{{harvnb|Moblo|1998|pages=229\u2013232}}</ref>\n\nOn January 13, 1893, after the legislature dismissed the Wilcox cabinet (which had political sympathies to the Reform Party), Lili\u02bbuokalani appointed the new Parker cabinet, which had ties to the National Reform Party and consisted of [[Samuel Parker (Hawaii)|Samuel Parker]], as minister of foreign affairs; [[John F. Colburn]], as minister of the interior; [[William H. Cornwell]], as minister of finance; and [[Arthur P.

In reaction to the legislative stand still on the constitution convention bill, the queen met in secret with the two leaders of the Liberal Party: Representatives N\u0101wah\u012b and White and [[Samuel Nowlein]], the captain of her Royal Guards, to draft a new constitution.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=582\u2013586}}\n\nIn the afternoon of January 14, she met with her cabinet ministers while members of Hui K\u0101lai\u02bb\u0101ina and a delegation of native legislators marched to \u02bbIolani Palace with a sealed package containing the constitution for her to promulgate. According to historian [[William DeWitt Alexander]], this was pre-planned by the queen.<ref name=\"Kuykendall 1967 pages=582\u2013586\">{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=582\u2013586}}; {{harvnb|Allen|1982|pages=281\u2013282}}; {{harvnb|Twigg-Smith|1998|pages=64\u201367}}; {{harvnb|Alexander|1896|pages=29\u201336}}</ref> However, she discovered the ministers were either opposed to or reluctant to sign the new constitution and the queen had to postpone her plans and dismiss the delegations of political leaders and the assembled crowds from the palace.<ref name=\"Kuykendall 1967 pages=582\u2013586\"/> She later wrote, \"I told them I would not have taken such a step if they had not encouraged me. They had led me out to the edge of a precipice, and now were leaving me to take the step alone.\"{{sfn|Liliuokalani|1898|page=385}}\n\nThe political fallout of the queen's actions led to citywide political rallies and meetings in Honolulu. Anti-monarchists, annexationists, and leading Reformist politicians, including legislators Lorrin A. Thurston, [[William Owen Smith]], and William Chauncey Wilder, formed the [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]] in protest of the \"revolutionary\" action of the queen and conspired to depose her. In response, royalists and loyalists formed the Committee of Law and Order and met at the palace square on January{{nbsp}}16. White, N\u0101wah\u012b, Bush, Wilcox, and [[Antone Rosa]] and other pro-monarchist leaders gave speeches in support for the queen and the government.<ref>{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=586\u2013594}}; {{harvnb|Alexander|1896|pages=37\u201351}}; {{harvnb|Twigg-Smith|1998|pages=135\u2013166}}</ref> These actions and the radicalized political climate eventually led to the [[Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom|overthrow of the monarchy]], on January{{nbsp}}17, 1893, by the Committee of Safety, with the covert support of United States Minister [[John L.

This [[unicameral]] body was composed of the upper House of Nobles and the lower House of Representatives. This would be the first session during the reign of Queen [[Liliuokalani|Lili\u02bbuokalani]] and the last meeting of the legislative assembly during the Hawaiian monarchy. Three days after the prorogation of the assembly, many of the political tension developed during the legislative debates and the queen's attempt to promulgate a new constitution while her legislators were not in session led to the [[overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom]] on January 17, 1893.\n\nMembers of this legislative session included citizens and subjects of the kingdom of either full or mixed [[Native Hawaiian]], Euro-American and Asian descent, who were divided across different party lines. They included the insurgents who would play an eventual role in the deposition of the queen, and also the political resistance leaders who would lead the [[Opposition to the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom|opposition to the overthrow]] and attempts to annex the Hawaiian Islands to the United States.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Bayonet Constitution political cartoon 1887.jpg|thumb|Political cartoon depicting the ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' which resulted in the signing of the Bayonet Constitution, 1887]]\nIn 1887, King [[Kal\u0101kaua]] was forced to sign the [[Bayonet Constitution]] under duress by the [[Hawaiian League]], a group of foreign businessman and Hawaiian subjects of American missionary descent including [[Lorrin A. Thurston]]. This constitution limited the absolute power of the monarch and strengthened the power of the executive cabinet. It also raised property requirements for suffrage, disenfranchised many poor Native Hawaiians and naturalized Asian citizens, and gave the vote to unnaturalized foreign residents of European or American descent. It also changed membership in the House of Nobles, the upper house of the legislature, from life appointments by the king to elected offices for the first time. A new cabinet headed by Thurston was imposed on the king and the king's previous administration headed by [[Walter Murray Gibson]] was ousted.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=344\u2013372}}\n\nThe instigators of this ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' formed the [[Reform Party (Hawaii)|Reform Party]], drawing its memberships from Hawaiian conservatives and citizens of foreign descent, and won the majority of the seats in the legislature in the election of 1887, which was mandated by the new constitution.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=406\u2013410}}{{sfn|Osorio|2002|pages=238, 245\u2013248}} In the election of 1890, the [[Hui K\u0101lai\u02bb\u0101ina]] (Hawaiian Political Association) and the Mechanics' and Workingmen's Political Protective Union joined together to form the [[National Reform Party (Hawaii)|National Reform Party]] in opposition to the Reform Party in this session. The Reform Party lost their majority control in the legislature and the Thurston cabinet was removed by a legislative vote of want of confidence.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=448\u2013455, 460\u2013460}}\n\nFollowing the [[wikt:prorogation#Noun|prorogation]] of the legislature of 1890, King Kalakaua died while in [[San Francisco]] and was succeeded by his sister Queen [[Liliuokalani|Lili\u02bbuokalani]] on January 29, 1891.<ref>{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=474\u2013475}}</ref>\n\n==Election of 1892==\n\nThe general election of 1892 proved the most contentious. The four major parties were the Reform, National Reform, National Liberal, and the Native Sons of Hawaii which ran the same candidates as the National Reformers. The National Reform Party became the administration or governmental party and gained the personal support of the new queen. They joined with the Reformers and Native Sons in opposing the more radical elements of the National Liberal. The National Liberal Party, which became the party of the opposition, advocated for increased Native Hawaiian participation in the government and a constitutional convention to draft a new constitution to replace the unpopular Bayonet Constitution. However, the Liberals soon became divided between radicals and more conciliatory groups. [[Joseph N\u0101wah\u012b]] and [[William P\u016bnohu White]] became the leaders of the factions of the Liberals loyal to the queen against the more radical members led by [[John E. Bush (politician)|John E. Bush]] and [[Robert William Wilcox]], who were advocating for drastic changes such as increased power for the people and a republican form of government.<ref>{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=514\u2013522, 547, 554\u2013555}}</ref>\n\nThe election resulted in a divided legislature, although the conservatives painted it as a victory for their coalition. It was hard to tell where the exact loyalty of many of the elected nobles and representatives lay because of internal disagreement. According to historian [[Ralph S. Kuykendall]], \"the party composition of the 1892 legislature (the forty-eight elected members) appeared to be: Reform Party, twenty-three; Liberal Party, thirteen; National Reform Party, nine; Independent, three\".{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|page=521}}\n\n==Legislative Session==\nFrom May 28, 1892, to January 14, 1893, the legislature of the Kingdom convened for an unprecedented 171 days, which later historians such as [[Albertine Loomis]] and [[Helena G. Allen]] dubbed the \"Longest Legislature\".<ref name=\"Longest\" /> This would be the first session during the reign of Queen Lili\u02bbuokalani and the last meeting of the legislative assembly during the Hawaiian monarchy.<ref name=\"Longest\">{{harvnb|Loomis|1963|pages=7\u201327}}; {{harvnb|Allen|1982|pages=269\u2013270}}</ref>\n\nAt the opening of the legislature, forty-eight elected politicians, consisting of twenty-four nobles (including thirteen holdovers continued their terms from the 1890 legislature) and twenty-four representatives from the four main Hawaiian Islands met at the legislative halls of [[Aliiolani Hale|Ali\u02bbi\u014dlani Hale]] in Honolulu. The legislature met as a [[unicameral]] body composed of the upper House of Nobles and the lower House of Representatives with Noble [[John Smith Walker]] presiding as President of the Legislative Assembly and Noble [[John Kauhane]] as Vice-President. The body included politicians of Native Hawaiian descent, Euro-American descent, mixed Hawaiian and Euro-American descent, and even three members of Chinese-Hawaiian descent. The appointed cabinet ministers also had the right to participate as ex-officio members of the legislature with the right to vote on all matters except on votes for their removal. In the course of the session, five members would resign and three new members chosen in special elections to replace with two of the five members reclaiming their vacated seats.<ref>{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|page=521}}; {{harvnb|Hawaii|Lydecker|1918|page=182}}</ref>\n\nThis session was dominated by political infighting within and between and the different parties. Debates heard on the floor of the houses concerned the popular demand for a new constitution, the passage of a lottery bill and an opium licensing bill, aimed at alleviating the economic crisis caused by the [[McKinley Tariff]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=523\u2013581}}; {{harvnb|Loomis|1963|pages=7\u201327}}</ref> By the end of the session, the queen had also signed into law the lottery bill and opium licensing bill, which were extremely controversial in the foreign community and especially with the leaders of the Reform Party.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=543\u2013545, 574\u2013581}}\n\nPetitions asking for a new constitution were submitted by seven legislators: Noble [[David William Pua]] and Representatives [[Joseph N\u0101wah\u012b]], [[William P\u016bnohu White]], [[Jose Kekahuna Iosepa]], [[Anakalea Kauhi]], [[T.

Both National Liberals and National Reformers campaigned on the promise of a new constitution, however many National Reformers supported a middle path and advocated for changes via amendments. The conservative Reformers would not tolerate any changes to the existing constitution. There was also disagreement on the legality of how to execute the change. No clear comparable precedents existed, since previous constitutions had been promulgated by the sovereign.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=461\u2013465, 547\u2013548, 575\u2013576}}\n\nThe main issue of contention between the new monarch and the legislators was the retention of her cabinet ministers; political division prevented Lili\u02bbuokalani from appointing a balanced council. The 1887 constitution retained the monarch's right to appoint her own cabinet minister but gave the legislature the power to vote for the dismissal of her cabinet.<ref>{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=549\u2013559}}</ref> \nSeven resolutions of want of confidence were introduced during this session, and four of her self-appointed cabinets (the [[Hermann A.

Colburn]], as minister of the interior; [[William H. Cornwell]], as minister of finance; and [[Arthur P.

In reaction to the legislative stand still on the constitution convention bill, the queen met in secret with the two leaders of the Liberal Party: Representatives N\u0101wah\u012b and White and [[Samuel Nowlein]], the captain of her Royal Guards, to draft a new constitution.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=582\u2013586}}\n\nIn the afternoon of January 14, she met with her cabinet ministers while members of Hui K\u0101lai\u02bb\u0101ina and a delegation of native legislators marched to \u02bbIolani Palace with a sealed package containing the constitution for her to promulgate. According to historian [[William DeWitt Alexander]], this was pre-planned by the queen.<ref name=\"Kuykendall 1967 pages=582\u2013586\">{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=582\u2013586}}; {{harvnb|Allen|1982|pages=281\u2013282}}; {{harvnb|Twigg-Smith|1998|pages=64\u201367}}; {{harvnb|Alexander|1896|pages=29\u201336}}</ref> However, she discovered the ministers were either opposed to or reluctant to sign the new constitution and the queen had to postpone her plans and dismiss the delegations of political leaders and the assembled crowds from the palace.<ref name=\"Kuykendall 1967 pages=582\u2013586\"/> She later wrote, \"I told them I would not have taken such a step if they had not encouraged me. They had led me out to the edge of a precipice, and now were leaving me to take the step alone.\"{{sfn|Liliuokalani|1898|page=385}}\n\nThe political fallout of the queen's actions led to citywide political rallies and meetings in Honolulu. Anti-monarchists, annexationists, and leading Reformist politicians, including legislators Lorrin A. Thurston, [[William Owen Smith]], and William Chauncey Wilder, formed the [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]] in protest of the \"revolutionary\" action of the queen and conspired to depose her. In response, royalists and loyalists formed the Committee of Law and Order and met at the palace square on January{{nbsp}}16. White, N\u0101wah\u012b, Bush, Wilcox, and [[Antone Rosa]] and other pro-monarchist leaders gave speeches in support for the queen and the government.<ref>{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=586\u2013594}}; {{harvnb|Alexander|1896|pages=37\u201351}}; {{harvnb|Twigg-Smith|1998|pages=135\u2013166}}</ref> These actions and the radicalized political climate eventually led to the [[Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom|overthrow of the monarchy]], on January{{nbsp}}17, 1893, by the Committee of Safety, with the covert support of United States Minister [[John L.

The city is separated from [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] by the [[Sacramento River]] which also separates [[Sacramento County, California|Sacramento]] and Yolo counties. It is a fast-growing community; the population was 48,744 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], up from 31,615 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. The traditional industrial center of the region since the Gold Rush era, West Sacramento is home to a diverse economy and is one of the area's top four employment centers.\n\nThe [[United States Conference of Mayors]] named West Sacramento as the Most Livable City in America in 2014 in the category of cities with fewer than 100,000 residents.<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://usmayors.org/82ndAnnualMeeting/media/0621-release-citylivability.pdf | title = New Orleans & West Sacramento Named \"Most Livable\" Cities in America | location = Dallas, TX | date = June 21, 2014 | publisher = The [[United States Conference of Mayors]]}}</ref>\n\nWest Sacramento is part of the [[Sacramento metropolitan area|Sacramento\u2013Arden Arcade\u2013Roseville Metropolitan Statistical Area]] which has a population (2000) of approximately 1,796,857 (July 1, 2016 estimate placed the population at 2,296,418).<ref>{{citation | url = https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t29/tables/tab01a.pdf | title = Table 1a.

He built a shack on the west bank of the Sacramento River six miles (10&nbsp;km) south of its connection with the American River. John, with the help of his brother George, founded a salmon fishery along the river. In addition to the fishery, they also found the soil to be fertile and began farming and raising livestock. The announcement of the discovery of gold at [[Sutter's Mill]] in 1848 brought a multitude of miners to the region. This also coincided with the end of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\nIn 1846, a man named James McDowell bought {{convert|600|acre|ha}} from John Schwartz. With his wife, Margaret, and their three daughters, McDowell settled in the area we know today as [[Broderick, California|Broderick]]. The McDowell family experienced first-hand the violence that the gold rush era brought with it. In May 1849, James McDowell was shot and killed in a barroom argument that he had supposedly started. With the loss of the sole supporter of the McDowell family, Margaret needed to find a way to provide for her family.\n\nIn October 1849, Margaret hired a land surveyor to map out {{convert|160|acre|ha}}, which was then divided into forty one blocks. She sold individual lots within this platted area which she named the \"Town of Washington\". The first lot was sold to August W. Kaye for $500. During its first ten years, the rural Town of Washington went through a significant increase in business development and shipping activity. One of the first businesses to be established in the town was the [[California Steam Navigation Company]], which was attracted to the area in 1859 by how close the Sacramento River is to it. Other businesses in early Washington included hotels, saloons, and restaurants catering to the needs of people passing through. Many of the travelers making the treacherous journey through the marshlands on their way to Sacramento were appreciative of the rest stop at the Town of Washington.\n\nWhile Sacramento began to urbanize on the other side of the river, early West Sacramento found its hand at agricultural development. Salmon, sturgeon, catfish, eel, crayfish, and clams proved to be lucrative in this region as fisherman soon found. The river settlement was flourishing, stocking fish markets not only in Sacramento, but in San Francisco as well. In addition, the rich soil of the valley produced abundant crops of com, melons, cucumbers, and sweet potatoes. The dairy industry also established roots in West Sacramento around this time.\n\nOne of the area's most well known dairy farmers was Mike Bryte. Bryte came to California in 1849 to try his hand at gold mining. He didn't make a fortune in gold, but was able to purchase a dairy farm with his findings. When the California Steam Navigation Company came to Washington, Bryte used the steamships to carry his dairy products to various markets within the region. Profits from this allowed Bryte to expand his holdings. Bryte was able to own several thousand acres of land in the area to farm on, as well as raise his many livestock on. Mike Bryte's influence in the community was marked by his election to the [[Yolo County]] Board of Supervisors and later as sheriff. During the 20th century, Mike Bryte's property was divided and became known as the community of [[Bryte, California|Bryte]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://westsachistoricalsociety.org/|title=Home|website=West Sacramento Historical Society|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mission Motel, 1 1-2 M.

The Town of Washington was renamed Broderick in honor of U. S. Senator [[David C. Broderick]]. After 1900, the three communities known as [[Bryte, California|Bryte]], [[Broderick, California|Broderick]], and West Sacramento were cumulatively known as \"East Yolo\".<ref name=\"CGN\" />\n\nFrom 1900 to 1920, the population of this area doubled from 1,398 to 2,638.

It is a fast-growing community; the population was 48,744 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], up from 31,615 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. The traditional industrial center of the region since the Gold Rush era, West Sacramento is home to a diverse economy and is one of the area's top four employment centers.\n\nThe [[United States Conference of Mayors]] named West Sacramento as the Most Livable City in America in 2014 in the category of cities with fewer than 100,000 residents.<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://usmayors.org/82ndAnnualMeeting/media/0621-release-citylivability.pdf | title = New Orleans & West Sacramento Named \"Most Livable\" Cities in America | location = Dallas, TX | date = June 21, 2014 | publisher = The [[United States Conference of Mayors]]}}</ref>\n\nWest Sacramento is part of the [[Sacramento metropolitan area|Sacramento\u2013Arden Arcade\u2013Roseville Metropolitan Statistical Area]] which has a population (2000) of approximately 1,796,857 (July 1, 2016 estimate placed the population at 2,296,418).<ref>{{citation | url = https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t29/tables/tab01a.pdf | title = Table 1a.

He built a shack on the west bank of the Sacramento River six miles (10&nbsp;km) south of its connection with the American River. John, with the help of his brother George, founded a salmon fishery along the river. In addition to the fishery, they also found the soil to be fertile and began farming and raising livestock. The announcement of the discovery of gold at [[Sutter's Mill]] in 1848 brought a multitude of miners to the region. This also coincided with the end of the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n\nIn 1846, a man named James McDowell bought {{convert|600|acre|ha}} from John Schwartz. With his wife, Margaret, and their three daughters, McDowell settled in the area we know today as [[Broderick, California|Broderick]]. The McDowell family experienced first-hand the violence that the gold rush era brought with it. In May 1849, James McDowell was shot and killed in a barroom argument that he had supposedly started. With the loss of the sole supporter of the McDowell family, Margaret needed to find a way to provide for her family.\n\nIn October 1849, Margaret hired a land surveyor to map out {{convert|160|acre|ha}}, which was then divided into forty one blocks. She sold individual lots within this platted area which she named the \"Town of Washington\". The first lot was sold to August W. Kaye for $500. During its first ten years, the rural Town of Washington went through a significant increase in business development and shipping activity. One of the first businesses to be established in the town was the [[California Steam Navigation Company]], which was attracted to the area in 1859 by how close the Sacramento River is to it. Other businesses in early Washington included hotels, saloons, and restaurants catering to the needs of people passing through. Many of the travelers making the treacherous journey through the marshlands on their way to Sacramento were appreciative of the rest stop at the Town of Washington.\n\nWhile Sacramento began to urbanize on the other side of the river, early West Sacramento found its hand at agricultural development. Salmon, sturgeon, catfish, eel, crayfish, and clams proved to be lucrative in this region as fisherman soon found. The river settlement was flourishing, stocking fish markets not only in Sacramento, but in San Francisco as well. In addition, the rich soil of the valley produced abundant crops of com, melons, cucumbers, and sweet potatoes. The dairy industry also established roots in West Sacramento around this time.\n\nOne of the area's most well known dairy farmers was Mike Bryte. Bryte came to California in 1849 to try his hand at gold mining. He didn't make a fortune in gold, but was able to purchase a dairy farm with his findings. When the California Steam Navigation Company came to Washington, Bryte used the steamships to carry his dairy products to various markets within the region. Profits from this allowed Bryte to expand his holdings. Bryte was able to own several thousand acres of land in the area to farm on, as well as raise his many livestock on. Mike Bryte's influence in the community was marked by his election to the [[Yolo County]] Board of Supervisors and later as sheriff. During the 20th century, Mike Bryte's property was divided and became known as the community of [[Bryte, California|Bryte]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://westsachistoricalsociety.org/|title=Home|website=West Sacramento Historical Society|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-29}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mission Motel, 1 1-2 M.

The Town of Washington was renamed Broderick in honor of U. S. Senator [[David C. Broderick]]. After 1900, the three communities known as [[Bryte, California|Bryte]], [[Broderick, California|Broderick]], and West Sacramento were cumulatively known as \"East Yolo\".<ref name=\"CGN\" />\n\nFrom 1900 to 1920, the population of this area doubled from 1,398 to 2,638.

Commonly, euphemisms are used to avoid directly addressing subjects that might be deemed negative or embarrassing, e.g. business rivalries, like [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]] fans calling [[DC Comics]] the \"Distinguished Competition.\" They may be created for innocent, well-intentioned purposes or nefariously and cynically, intentionally to deceive and confuse.\n\n===Mitigation===\nEuphemisms are also used to mitigate, soften or downplay the gravity of large-scale injustices, war crimes, or other events that warrant a pattern of avoidance in official statements or documents. For instance, one reason for the comparative scarcity of written evidence documenting the exterminations at [[Auschwitz]], relative to their sheer number, is \"directives for the extermination process obscured in bureaucratic euphemisms\".<ref name=\"MyUser_Newyorker.com_December_1_2015c\">{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1993/11/15/evidence-of-evil |title=Evidence of Evil  |newspaper=Newyorker.com \u2013 The New Yorker |date= November 15, 1993 |author=Timothy Ryback |accessdate= December 1, 2015}}</ref>\n\nEuphemisms are sometimes used to lessen the opposition to a political move. For example, according to linguist [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] used the neutral Hebrew lexical item \u05e4\u05e2\u05d9\u05de\u05d5\u05ea ''peim\u00f3t'' (\"beatings (of the heart)\"), rather than \u05e0\u05e1\u05d9\u05d2\u05d4 ''nesig\u00e1'' (\"withdrawal\"), to refer to the stages in the Israeli withdrawal from the [[West Bank]] (see [[Wye River Memorandum]]), in order to lessen the opposition of right-wing Israelis to such a move.<ref name=\"language\">[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2003), [[Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew]].

However, ''[[visual impairment]]'' can be a broader term, including, for example, people who have partial sight in one eye, those with uncorrectable mild to moderate poor vision, or even those who wear glasses, groups that would be excluded by the word ''blind'' or even ''partially blind''.\n\nThe coining and useage of euphemisms reveals what the coiner or speaker/writer considers, perhaps only sub-consciously, to be shameful, and may thus be an indication of prejudices or opinions held. For example it clearly is not shameful to have black skin, but those who refer to such a characteristic euphemistically in an attempt to be polite are in fact revealing unresolved personal prejudices on the matter. It is not rude to speak directly of something one considers admirable.\n\n==Formation methods==\n===Phonetic modification===\nPhonetic euphemism is used to replace profanities, diminishing their intensity. Modifications include:\n* Shortening or \"clipping\" the term, such as ''Jeez'' (Jesus) and ''what the\u2014'' (\"what the hell\" or \"what the fuck\")\n* Mispronunciations, such as ''[[Frak (expletive)|frak]]'', ''[[Frig (interjection)|frig]]'' (both the preceding for \"fuck\"), ''what the fudge'', ''what the truck'' (both \"what the fuck\"), ''oh my gosh'' (\"oh my God\"), ''frickin'' (\"fucking\"), ''darn'' (\"damn\"), ''oh shoot'' (\"oh shit\"), ''be-yotch'' (\"bitch\"), etc. This is also referred to as a [[minced oath]].\n* Using [[acronym]]s as replacements, such as ''SOB'' (\"son of a bitch\"), ''what the eff'' (\"what the fuck\"), ''S my D'' (\"suck my dick\"), ''POS'' (\"piece of shit\"), ''BS'' (\"bullshit\"). Sometimes, the word \"word\" is added after it, such as ''F-word'' (\"fuck\"), ''S-word'' (\"shit\"), ''B-word'' (\"bitch\"), ''N-word'' (\"nigger\"), etc. Also, the letter can be phonetically respelled. For example, the word ''piss'' was shortened to ''pee'' (pronounced as the letter ''P'') in this way.\n\n===Pronunciation===\nTo alter the pronunciation or spelling of a taboo word (such as a [[swear word]]) to form a euphemism is known as ''taboo deformation'', or a [[minced oath]]. In [[American English]], words that are unacceptable on television, such as ''[[fuck]]'', may be represented by deformations such as ''freak'', even in children's cartoons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |title=Obscene, Indecent and Profane Broadcasts |publisher=U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] |work=FCC.gov |accessdate=2014-01-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209153728/http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |archivedate=2013-12-09 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Feck]] is a minced oath originating in Hiberno-English and popularised outside of Ireland by the British [[sitcom]] ''[[Father Ted]]''. Some examples of Cockney [[rhyming slang]] may serve the same purpose: to call a person a ''berk'' sounds less offensive than to call a person a ''[[cunt]]'', though ''berk'' is short for [[Berkeley Hunt]],<ref>although properly pronounced in upper-class British-English \"barkley\"</ref> which rhymes with ''cunt''.<ref>http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/berk Collins Dictionary, definition of \"berk\"/\"burk\", retrieved 22 July 2014.</ref>\n\n===Understatement===\nEuphemisms formed from [[understatement]]s include: ''asleep'' for dead and ''drinking'' for consuming alcohol. \"Tired and emotional\" is a notorious euphemism for \"drunk\", used by British parliamentarians of one another.\n\n===Substitution===\nPleasant, positive, worthy, neutral or non-descript terms are substituted for explicit or unpleasant ones, with many substituted terms deliberately coined by socio-political [[Progressivism|progressive]] movements, cynically by planned [[marketing]], [[public relations]] or [[advertising]] initiatives, including:\n*\"meat packing company\" for \"slaughter-house\" (avoids entirely the subject of killing); \"natural issue\" for \"bastard\"; \"let go\" for \"fired\" or \"dismissed\" (implies a generosity on the part of the employer in allowing employee to depart); \"intimate\" for \"sexual,\" \"adult material\" for \"pornography\"; \"issue\" for \"problem\"; \"high-net worth\" for \"rich\"; \"plus-sized\" for \"overweight,\" \"escort/sex-worker\" for \"prostitute\" (down-plays/morally elevates the activity); \"memorial marker\" for \"gravestone\"; \"staff-member\" for \"servant\"; \"colleague\" for \"employee\" (apparent promotion from servant to partner); \"operative\" for \"worker\" (elevates status); \"turf-accountant\" for \"book-maker\" (professionalises an unworthy activity); \"marital aid\" for \"sex toy\" (converts to an object fulfilling a worthy objective); or \"final expenses\" for \"funeral costs\". Basic ancient and (overly) direct Anglo-Saxon words such as deaf, dumb, blind, lame, all have modern euphemisms.\n\nOver time it becomes socially unacceptable to use the former word, as one is effectively down-grading the matter concerned to its former lower status, and the euphemism becomes dominant, due to a wish not to offend.\n\n===Metaphor===\n* [[Metaphor]]s (''beat the meat'' or ''choke the chicken'' or ''jerkin' the gherkin'' for [[masturbation]], ''take a dump'' and ''take a leak'' for defecation and urination respectively)\n* Comparisons (''buns'' for buttocks, ''weed'' for cannabis)\n* [[Metonymy]] (''men's room'' for \"men's toilet\")\n\n===Slang===\n{{see also|Slang}}\nThe use of a term with a softer connotation, though it shares the same meaning. For instance, ''screwed up'' is a euphemism for ''fucked up''; ''hook-up'' and ''laid'' are euphemisms for [[sexual intercourse]].\n\n===Foreign words===\nExpressions or words from a foreign language may be imported for use as a replacement for an offensive word. For example, the French word ''enceinte'' was sometimes used instead of the English word ''pregnant'';<ref name=\"MW\">{{cite web|title=Definition of ENCEINTE|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enceinte|website=www.merriam-webster.com|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|accessdate=2017-05-20|language=en}}</ref> ''abattoir'' for \"slaughter-house\", although in French the word retains its explicit violent meaning \"a place for beating down\", conveniently lost on non-French speakers. \"Entrepreneur\" for \"business-man\", adds glamour; \"douche\" (French: shower) for vaginal irrigation device; \"bidet\" (French: little pony) for \"vessel for intimate ablutions\". Ironically, whilst in English physical \"handicap\" is almost always substituted for a modern euphemism, in French the English word \"handicap\" is used as a euphemism for their problematic words \"infirmit\u00e9\" or \"invalidit\u00e9\".\n\n===Periphrasis/circumlocution===\n[[Periphrasis]], or [[circumlocution]], is one of the most common: to \"speak around\" a given word, [[Implicature|implying]] it without saying it. Over time, circumlocutions become recognized as established euphemisms for particular words or ideas.\n\n===Re-naming===\nPlaces which have become associated with unpleasant events may be re-named, for example the English nuclear energy plant [[Windscale]], after a damaging radiation leak was re-named [[Sellafield]].\n\n==Doublespeak==\n[[Bureaucracy|Bureaucracies]] frequently spawn euphemisms intentionally, as [[doublespeak]] expressions. For example, in the past, the US military used the term \"[[sunshine units]]\" for contamination by [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=McCool |first=W.C. |date=1957-02-06 |title=Return of Rongelapese to their Home Island&nbsp;\u2013 Note by the Secretary |publisher=[[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] |url=http://worf.eh.doe.gov/ihp/chron/A43.PDF |accessdate=2007-11-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925185914/http://worf.eh.doe.gov/ihp/chron/A43.PDF |archivedate=2007-09-25 }}</ref> An effective death sentence in the Soviet Union during the [[Great Purge]] often used the clause \"imprisonment [[Without the right of correspondence|without right to correspondence]]\": the person sentenced would be shot soon after conviction.<ref>Solzhenitsyn, Alexander (1974).

In the 20th century, where the old euphemisms ''lavatory'' (a place where one washes) or ''[[toilet]]'' (a place where one dresses<ref>Frence ''toile'', fabric, a form of curtain behind which washing, dressing and hair-dressing were performed (Larousse, Dictionnaire de la langue francise, \"Lexis\", Paris, 1979, p.1891)</ref>) had grown from long usage (e.g. in the United States) too synonymous with the crude act they sought to deflect, they were sometimes replaced with ''bathroom'' (a place where one bathes) ''washroom'' (a place where one washes) or ''restroom'' (a place where one rests) or even by the extreme form ''powder-room'' (a place where one applies facial cosmetics). The form ''water closet'', which in turn became euphemised to ''W.C.'', is a less deflective form. \n\nAnother example in American English is the replacement of [[colored]] with [[Negro]] (euphemism by foreign language),<ref>[https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/11/07/362273449/why-we-have-so-many-terms-for-people-of-color Why We Have So Many Terms For 'People Of Color']</ref> then the \"honest\" non-euphemistic form \"[[Black people|Black]]\" making a brief appearance (due to 1960s political forces attempting to normalise black skin) before being suppressed again by the present euphemistic \"[[African American]]\". [[Venereal Disease]], which associated shameful bacterial infection with a seemingly worthy ailment emanating from [[Venus]] the goddess of love, soon lost its deflective force in the post-classical education era, as crude \"VD\", which has now been replaced by the banal [[three-letter acronym]] \"STI\".\n\nThe word ''[[shit]]'' appears to have originally been a euphemism for defecation in Pre-Germanic, as the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European root]] *''s\u1e31eyd-'', from which it was derived, meant \"to cut off\".<ref name=\"ringe\">{{cite book| last=Ringe |first=Don | authorlink=Donald Ringe| title=From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-955229-0}}</ref>\n\n==Literal interpretation==\nEuphemisms are at risk of being misunderstood and used literally by young children who are acquiring language, and by older people who are learning a foreign language. An example is the \"pregnant [[Firefighter|fireman]]\" type of children's [[solecism]], where a child might hear someone define pregnancy euphemistically as \"carrying a child,\" then mistakenly extend that meaning and refer to a fireman literally carrying a child as pregnant. <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://ladiesforlife.wordpress.com/2010/01/02/the-pregnant-fireman-vocabulary-lesson/ |title = The pregnant fireman vocabulary lesson|date = 2010-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{In popular culture|section|date=March 2019}}\n{{Duplication|article|dupe=Minced oaths in media|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Doublespeak]] is a term sometimes used for deliberate euphemistic misuse of words to distort or reverse their meaning, as in a \"Ministry of Peace\" which wages war, and a \"Ministry of Love\" which imprisons and tortures. It is a [[portmanteau]] of the terms ''[[Newspeak]]'' and ''[[doublethink]]'', which originate from [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.\n\nThe word ''euphemism'' itself can be used as a euphemism. In the animated TV special ''[[Halloween Is Grinch Night]]'' (see [[Dr. Seuss]]), a child asks to go to the ''euphemism'', where ''euphemism'' is being used as a euphemism for ''[[outhouse]]''. This euphemistic use of ''euphemism'' also occurred in the play ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' where a character requests, \"Martha, will you show her where we keep the, uh, euphemism?\"\n\nIn Wes Anderson's film ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'', the replacement of swear words by the word ''cuss'' became a humorous motif throughout the film.\n\nIn [[Tom Hanks]]'s web series ''[[Electric City (web series)|Electric City]]'', the use of profanity has been censored by the word ''expletive''. \"[[Expletive deleted|&#91;Expletive deleted&#93;]]\" entered public discourse after its notorious use in censoring transcripts of the [[Watergate tapes]].\n\nIn [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]], the curses of the scientist [[Ebling Mis]] have all been replaced with the word ''unprintable''. In fact, there is only one case of his curses being referred to as such, leading some readers to mistakenly assume that the euphemism is Ebling's, rather than Asimov's. The same word has also been used in his short story \"[[Flies (Asimov short story)|Flies]]\".\n\n[[George Carlin]] has stated in audio books and his stand-up shows that euphemisms soften everyday language and take the life out of it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9n8Xp8DWf8|title=George Carlin's stand up act: Euphemism|website=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|''Battlestar Galactica'']] (2004), use of the words \"frak\" and \"frakking\" was directly substituted for the English slang words \"fuck\" and \"fucking\", confounding the censors. Other science fiction series have similarly used word substitution to avoid censorship, such as \"frell\" instead of \"fuck\" in ''[[Farscape]]'', \"gorram\" and \"rutting\" instead of \"goddamn\" and \"fucking\" in ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', and \"frag\" instead of \"fuck\" in ''[[Babylon 5]]''.<ref name=\"Syfy\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/shazbot_check_out_14_frak |title=Shazbot!

Commonly, euphemisms are used to avoid directly addressing subjects that might be deemed negative or embarrassing, e.g. business rivalries, like [[Marvel Entertainment|Marvel]] fans calling [[DC Comics]] the \"Distinguished Competition.\" They may be created for innocent, well-intentioned purposes or nefariously and cynically, intentionally to deceive and confuse.\n\n===Mitigation===\nEuphemisms are also used to mitigate, soften or downplay the gravity of large-scale injustices, war crimes, or other events that warrant a pattern of avoidance in official statements or documents.

For example, sometimes the phrase ''visually impaired'' is labeled as a [[political correctness|politically correct]] euphemism for ''blind''. However, ''[[visual impairment]]'' can be a broader term, including, for example, people who have partial sight in one eye, those with uncorrectable mild to moderate poor vision, or even those who wear glasses, groups that would be excluded by the word ''blind'' or even ''partially blind''.\n\nThe coining and useage of euphemisms reveals what the coiner or speaker/writer considers, perhaps only sub-consciously, to be shameful, and may thus be an indication of prejudices or opinions held. For example it clearly is not shameful to have black skin, but those who refer to such a characteristic euphemistically in an attempt to be polite are in fact revealing unresolved personal prejudices on the matter. It is not rude to speak directly of something one considers admirable.\n\n==Formation methods==\n===Phonetic modification===\nPhonetic euphemism is used to replace profanities, diminishing their intensity. Modifications include:\n* Shortening or \"clipping\" the term, such as ''Jeez'' (Jesus) and ''what the\u2014'' (\"what the hell\" or \"what the fuck\")\n* Mispronunciations, such as ''[[Frak (expletive)|frak]]'', ''[[Frig (interjection)|frig]]'' (both the preceding for \"fuck\"), ''what the fudge'', ''what the truck'' (both \"what the fuck\"), ''oh my gosh'' (\"oh my God\"), ''frickin'' (\"fucking\"), ''darn'' (\"damn\"), ''oh shoot'' (\"oh shit\"), ''be-yotch'' (\"bitch\"), etc. This is also referred to as a [[minced oath]].\n* Using [[acronym]]s as replacements, such as ''SOB'' (\"son of a bitch\"), ''what the eff'' (\"what the fuck\"), ''S my D'' (\"suck my dick\"), ''POS'' (\"piece of shit\"), ''BS'' (\"bullshit\"). Sometimes, the word \"word\" is added after it, such as ''F-word'' (\"fuck\"), ''S-word'' (\"shit\"), ''B-word'' (\"bitch\"), ''N-word'' (\"nigger\"), etc. Also, the letter can be phonetically respelled. For example, the word ''piss'' was shortened to ''pee'' (pronounced as the letter ''P'') in this way.\n\n===Pronunciation===\nTo alter the pronunciation or spelling of a taboo word (such as a [[swear word]]) to form a euphemism is known as ''taboo deformation'', or a [[minced oath]]. In [[American English]], words that are unacceptable on television, such as ''[[fuck]]'', may be represented by deformations such as ''freak'', even in children's cartoons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |title=Obscene, Indecent and Profane Broadcasts |publisher=U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] |work=FCC.gov |accessdate=2014-01-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209153728/http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |archivedate=2013-12-09 |url-status=live}}</ref> [[Feck]] is a minced oath originating in Hiberno-English and popularised outside of Ireland by the British [[sitcom]] ''[[Father Ted]]''. Some examples of Cockney [[rhyming slang]] may serve the same purpose: to call a person a ''berk'' sounds less offensive than to call a person a ''[[cunt]]'', though ''berk'' is short for [[Berkeley Hunt]],<ref>although properly pronounced in upper-class British-English \"barkley\"</ref> which rhymes with ''cunt''.<ref>http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/berk Collins Dictionary, definition of \"berk\"/\"burk\", retrieved 22 July 2014.</ref>\n\n===Understatement===\nEuphemisms formed from [[understatement]]s include: ''asleep'' for dead and ''drinking'' for consuming alcohol. \"Tired and emotional\" is a notorious euphemism for \"drunk\", used by British parliamentarians of one another.\n\n===Substitution===\nPleasant, positive, worthy, neutral or non-descript terms are substituted for explicit or unpleasant ones, with many substituted terms deliberately coined by socio-political [[progressive]] movements, cynically by planned [[marketing]], [[public relations]] or [[advertising]] initiatives, including:\n*\"meat packing company\" for \"slaughter-house\" (avoids entirely the subject of killing); \"natural issue\" for \"bastard\"; \"let go\" for \"fired\" or \"dismissed\" (implies a generosity on the part of the employer in allowing employee to depart); \"intimate\" for \"sexual,\" \"adult material\" for \"pornography\"; \"issue\" for \"problem\"; \"high-net worth\" for \"rich\"; \"plus-sized\" for \"overweight,\" \"escort/sex-worker\" for \"prostitute\" (down-plays/morally elevates the activity); \"memorial marker\" for \"gravestone\"; \"staff-member\" for \"servant\"; \"colleague\" for \"employee\" (apparent promotion from servant to partner); \"operative\" for \"worker\" (elevates status); \"turf-accountant\" for \"book-maker\" (professionalises an unworthy activity); \"marital aid\" for \"sex toy\" (converts to an object fulfilling a worthy objective); or \"final expenses\" for \"funeral costs\". Basic ancient and (overly) direct Anglo-Saxon words such as deaf, dumb, blind, lame, all have modern euphemisms.\n\nOver time it becomes socially unacceptable to use the former word, as one is effectively down-grading the matter concerned to its former lower status, and the euphemism becomes dominant, due to a wish not to offend.\n\n===Metaphor===\n* [[Metaphor]]s (''beat the meat'' or ''choke the chicken'' or ''jerkin' the gherkin'' for [[masturbation]], ''take a dump'' and ''take a leak'' for defecation and urination respectively)\n* Comparisons (''buns'' for buttocks, ''weed'' for cannabis)\n* [[Metonymy]] (''men's room'' for \"men's toilet\")\n\n===Slang===\n{{see also|Slang}}\nThe use of a term with a softer connotation, though it shares the same meaning. For instance, ''screwed up'' is a euphemism for ''fucked up''; ''hook-up'' and ''laid'' are euphemisms for [[sexual intercourse]].\n\n===Foreign words===\nExpressions or words from a foreign language may be imported for use as a replacement for an offensive word. For example, the French word ''enceinte'' was sometimes used instead of the English word ''pregnant'';<ref name=\"MW\">{{cite web|title=Definition of ENCEINTE|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enceinte|website=www.merriam-webster.com|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Incorporated|accessdate=2017-05-20|language=en}}</ref> ''abattoir'' for \"slaughter-house\", although in French the word retains its explicit violent meaning \"a place for beating down\", conveniently lost on non-French speakers. \"Entrepreneur\" for \"business-man\", adds glamour; \"douche\" (French: shower) for vaginal irrigation device; \"bidet\" (French: little pony) for \"vessel for intimate ablutions\". Ironically, whilst in English physical \"handicap\" is almost always substituted for a modern euphemism, in French the English word \"handicap\" is used as a euphemism for their problematic words \"infirmit\u00e9\" or \"invalidit\u00e9\".\n\n===Periphrasis/circumlocution===\n[[Periphrasis]], or [[circumlocution]], is one of the most common: to \"speak around\" a given word, [[Implicature|implying]] it without saying it. Over time, circumlocutions become recognized as established euphemisms for particular words or ideas.\n\n===Re-naming===\nPlaces which have become associated with unpleasant events may be re-named, for example the English nuclear energy plant [[Windscale]], after a damaging radiation leak was re-named [[Sellafield]].\n\n==Doublespeak==\n[[Bureaucracy|Bureaucracies]] frequently spawn euphemisms intentionally, as [[doublespeak]] expressions. For example, in the past, the US military used the term \"[[sunshine units]]\" for contamination by [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=McCool |first=W.C. |date=1957-02-06 |title=Return of Rongelapese to their Home Island&nbsp;\u2013 Note by the Secretary |publisher=[[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] |url=http://worf.eh.doe.gov/ihp/chron/A43.PDF |accessdate=2007-11-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925185914/http://worf.eh.doe.gov/ihp/chron/A43.PDF |archivedate=2007-09-25 }}</ref> An effective death sentence in the Soviet Union during the [[Great Purge]] often used the clause \"imprisonment [[Without the right of correspondence|without right to correspondence]]\": the person sentenced would be shot soon after conviction.<ref>Solzhenitsyn, Alexander (1974).

In the 20th century, where the old euphemisms ''lavatory'' (a place where one washes) or ''[[toilet]]'' (a place where one dresses<ref>Frence ''toile'', fabric, a form of curtain behind which washing, dressing and hair-dressing were performed (Larousse, Dictionnaire de la langue francise, \"Lexis\", Paris, 1979, p.1891)</ref>) had grown from long usage (e.g. in the United States) too synonymous with the crude act they sought to deflect, they were sometimes replaced with ''bathroom'' (a place where one bathes) ''washroom'' (a place where one washes) or ''restroom'' (a place where one rests) or even by the extreme form ''powder-room'' (a place where one applies facial cosmetics). The form ''water closet'', which in turn became euphemised to ''W.C.'', is a less deflective form. \n\nAnother example in American English is the replacement of [[colored]] with [[Negro]] (euphemism by foreign language),<ref>[https://www.npr.org/sections/codeswitch/2014/11/07/362273449/why-we-have-so-many-terms-for-people-of-color Why We Have So Many Terms For 'People Of Color']</ref> then the \"honest\" non-euphemistic form \"[[Black people|Black]]\" making a brief appearance (due to 1960s political forces attempting to normalise black skin) before being suppressed again by the present euphemistic \"[[African American]]\". [[Venereal Disease]], which associated shameful bacterial infection with a seemingly worthy ailment emanating from [[Venus]] the goddess of love, soon lost its deflective force in the post-classical education era, as crude \"VD\", which has now been replaced by the banal [[three-letter acronym]] \"STI\".\n\nThe word ''[[shit]]'' appears to have originally been a euphemism for defecation in Pre-Germanic, as the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European root]] *''s\u1e31eyd-'', from which it was derived, meant \"to cut off\".<ref name=\"ringe\">{{cite book| last=Ringe |first=Don | authorlink=Donald Ringe| title=From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-19-955229-0}}</ref>\n\n==Literal interpretation==\nEuphemisms are at risk of being misunderstood and used literally by young children who are acquiring language, and by older people who are learning a foreign language. An example is the \"pregnant [[Firefighter|fireman]]\" type of children's [[solecism]], where a child might hear someone define pregnancy euphemistically as \"carrying a child,\" then mistakenly extend that meaning and refer to a fireman literally carrying a child as pregnant. <ref>{{Cite web | url=https://ladiesforlife.wordpress.com/2010/01/02/the-pregnant-fireman-vocabulary-lesson/ |title = The pregnant fireman vocabulary lesson|date = 2010-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n{{In popular culture|section|date=March 2019}}\n{{Duplication|article|dupe=Minced oaths in media|date=March 2020}}\n\n[[Doublespeak]] is a term sometimes used for deliberate euphemistic misuse of words to distort or reverse their meaning, as in a \"Ministry of Peace\" which wages war, and a \"Ministry of Love\" which imprisons and tortures. It is a [[portmanteau]] of the terms ''[[Newspeak]]'' and ''[[doublethink]]'', which originate from [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''.\n\nThe word ''euphemism'' itself can be used as a euphemism. In the animated TV special ''[[Halloween Is Grinch Night]]'' (see [[Dr. Seuss]]), a child asks to go to the ''euphemism'', where ''euphemism'' is being used as a euphemism for ''[[outhouse]]''. This euphemistic use of ''euphemism'' also occurred in the play ''[[Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?]]'' where a character requests, \"Martha, will you show her where we keep the, uh, euphemism?\"\n\nIn Wes Anderson's film ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'', the replacement of swear words by the word ''cuss'' became a humorous motif throughout the film.\n\nIn [[Tom Hanks]]'s web series ''[[Electric City (web series)|Electric City]]'', the use of profanity has been censored by the word ''expletive''. \"[[Expletive deleted|&#91;Expletive deleted&#93;]]\" entered public discourse after its notorious use in censoring transcripts of the [[Watergate tapes]].\n\nIn [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[Foundation series|''Foundation'' series]], the curses of the scientist [[Ebling Mis]] have all been replaced with the word ''unprintable''. In fact, there is only one case of his curses being referred to as such, leading some readers to mistakenly assume that the euphemism is Ebling's, rather than Asimov's. The same word has also been used in his short story \"[[Flies (Asimov short story)|Flies]]\".\n\n[[George Carlin]] has stated in audio books and his stand-up shows that euphemisms soften everyday language and take the life out of it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9n8Xp8DWf8|title=George Carlin's stand up act: Euphemism|website=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nIn [[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|''Battlestar Galactica'']] (2004), use of the words \"frak\" and \"frakking\" was directly substituted for the English slang words \"fuck\" and \"fucking\", confounding the censors. Other science fiction series have similarly used word substitution to avoid censorship, such as \"frell\" instead of \"fuck\" in ''[[Farscape]]'', \"gorram\" and \"rutting\" instead of \"goddamn\" and \"fucking\" in ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', and \"frag\" instead of \"fuck\" in ''[[Babylon 5]]''.<ref name=\"Syfy\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/shazbot_check_out_14_frak |title=Shazbot!
