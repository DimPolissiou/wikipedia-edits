The resulting shifts to English usage by Scots-speakers resulted in many phonological compromises and lexical transfers, often mistaken for [[Phonological change|mergers]] by linguists unfamiliar with the history of Scottish English.<ref>Macafee, C. (2004). \"Scots and Scottish English.\" in Hikey R.(ed.),. Legacies of Colonial English: Studies in Transported Dialects.

Since England was the larger and richer of the two Kingdoms, James moved his court to [[London]] in England. The poets of the court therefore moved south and \"began adapting the language and style of their verse to the tastes of the English market\".<ref name=\"m36\">McClure (1994), p. 36</ref> To this event McClure attributes \"the sudden and total eclipse of Scots as a literary language\".<ref name=\"m36\"/> The continuing absence of a Scots translation of the Bible meant that [[Authorized King James Version|the translation of King James]] into English was used in worship in both countries.\n\nThe [[Acts of Union 1707]] amalgamated the Scottish and English Parliaments. However the church, educational and legal structures remained separate. This leads to important professional distinctions in the definitions of some words and terms. There are therefore words with precise definitions in Scottish English which have either no place in English English or have a different definition.\n<!--\nDespite this, the mother tongues of Scottish people remained overwhelmingly Gaelic (in the Highlands) and Scots (in the Lowlands).<ref name=\"m37\">McClure (1994), p. 37</ref>  English was restricted to members of the Scottish aristocracy who spent time in London.<ref name=\"m37\"/>\nPlease add more details: for what period was English restricted to the London-traveling aristocracy? How do we evidence this, especially given the fuzzy line between Scots and English?\nAlso, re McClure (1994) \u2013 the page references are great, but I was unable to find the book. Can you give more details there too?\n-->\n\n==Phonology==\n{{listen|filename=RenfrewshireAccent.ogg|title=Speech example|description=An example of a Scottish male with a middle-class [[Renfrewshire]] accent}}\n\nThe speech of the middle classes in Scotland tends to conform to the grammatical norms of the written standard, particularly in situations that are regarded as formal. [[Highland English]] is slightly different from the variety spoken in the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]] in that it is more phonologically, grammatically, and lexically influenced by a [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] [[substratum]]. Similarly, the English spoken in the North-East of Scotland tends to follow the phonology and grammar of [[Doric dialect (Scotland)|Doric]].\n\nAlthough pronunciation features vary among speakers (depending on region and social status), there are a number of phonological aspects characteristic of Scottish English:\n\n* Scottish English is a [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic accent]], meaning {{IPA|/r/}} is typically pronounced in the [[syllable coda]]. The phoneme {{IPA|/r/}} may be a [[postalveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[\u0279]}}, as in Received Pronunciation or General American, but speakers have also traditionally used for the same phoneme a somewhat more common [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[\u027e]}} or, now very rare, the [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}<ref>Lodge, Ken (2009). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_nVT_qNvbusC&dq= A Critical Introduction to Phonetics]''. A & C Black. p. 180</ref> (hereafter, {{angle bracket|r}} will be used to denote any rhotic consonant).\n**Although other dialects have merged non-intervocalic {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/\u026a/}}, {{IPA|/\u028c/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} ([[Fern-fir-fur merger|fern\u2013fir\u2013fur merger]]), Scottish English makes a distinction between the vowels in ''fern'', ''fir'', and ''fur''.\n**Many varieties contrast {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} so that ''hoarse'' and ''horse'' are pronounced differently.\n**{{IPA|/or/}} and {{IPA|/ur/}} are contrasted so that ''shore'' and ''sure'' are pronounced differently, as are ''pour'' and ''poor''.\n**{{IPA|/r/}} before {{IPA|/l/}} is strong. An [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowel may occur between {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} so that ''girl'' and ''world'' are two-syllable words for some speakers. The same may occur between {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}, between {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}, and between {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}.\n*There is a distinction between {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|[[Voiceless labialized velar approximant|/hw/]]}} in word pairs such as ''witch'' and ''which''.\n*The phoneme {{IPA|[[Voiceless velar fricative|/x/]]}} is common in names and in SSE's many Gaelic and Scots borrowings, so much so that it is often taught to incomers, particularly for \"ch\" in loch. Some Scottish speakers use it in words of Greek origin as well, such as technical, patriarch, etc. (Wells 1982, 408). \n*{{IPA|/l/}} is usually [[Velarization|velarised]] (see [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant|dark l]]) except in borrowings like \"glen\" (from Scottish Gaelic \"gleann\"), which had an unvelarised l in their original form. In areas where [[Scottish Gaelic]] was spoken until relatively recently (such as [[Dumfries]] and [[Galloway]]) and in areas where it is still spoken (such as the [[West Highlands]]), velarisation of {{IPA|/l/}} may be absent in many words in which it is present in other areas, but remains in borrowings that had velarised {{IPA|/l/}} in Gaelic, such as \"loch\" (Gaelic \"loch\") and \"clan\" (Gaelic \"clann\").\n*{{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} are not [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] in more traditional varieties,<ref>{{cite web|title=Wir Ain Leid|url=http://www.scots-online.org/grammar/sse.htm|accessdate=18 March 2012|location=section \"Consonants\"}}</ref> but are weakly aspirated currently.\n*The past ending ''-ed'' may be realised with {{IPA|/t/}} where other accents use {{IPA|/d/}}, chiefly after unstressed vowels: ''ended'' {{IPA|[\u025bnd\u026at]}}, ''carried'' {{IPA|[kar\u026at]}}\n*[[Vowel length]] is generally regarded as non-phonemic, although a distinctive part of Scottish English is the [[Scots vowel length rule]] (Scobbie et al. 1999). Certain vowels (such as {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, and {{IPA|/a\u026a/}}) are generally long but are shortened before [[nasal stop|nasals]] and voiced [[plosive consonant|plosives]]. However, this does not occur across morpheme boundaries so that ''need'' contrasts with ''kneed'', ''crude'' with ''crewed'' and ''side'' with ''sighed''.\n*Scottish English has no {{IPA|/\u028a/}}, instead transferring Scots {{IPA|/u/}}. Phonetically, this vowel may be pronounced {{IPA|[\u0289]}} or even {{IPA|[\u028f]}}. Thus ''pull'' and ''pool'' are homophones.\n*''Cot'' and ''caught'' are not differentiated in most Central Scottish varieties, as they are in some other varieties.<ref name=\"Wells, pp. 399 ff\">Wells, pp. 399 ff.</ref>\n*In most varieties, there is no {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}-{{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} distinction; therefore, ''bath'', ''trap'', and ''palm'' have the same vowel.<ref name=\"Wells, pp. 399 ff\"/>\n*The ''happY'' vowel is most commonly {{IPA|/e/}} (as in ''face''), but may also be {{IPA|/\u026a/}} (as in ''kit'') or {{IPA|/i/}} (as in ''fleece'').<ref>Wells, p. 405.</ref>\n*{{IPA|/\u03b8s/}} is often used in plural nouns where southern English has {{IPA|/\u00f0z/}} (baths, youths, etc.); ''with'' and ''booth'' are pronounced with {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}. (See [[Pronunciation of English th]].)\n*In colloquial speech, the [[glottal stop]] may be an allophone of {{IPA|/t/}} after a vowel, as in {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u028c\u0294\u0259r]}}. These same speakers may \"drop the g\" in the suffix ''-ing'' and [[Th-glottalization|debuccalise]] {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} to {{IPA|[h]}} in certain contexts.\n*{{IPA|/\u026a/}} may be more open {{IPA|[\u00eb\u031e]}} for certain speakers in some regions, so that it sounds more like {{IPA|[\u025b]}} (although {{IPA|/\u026a/}} and {{IPA|/\u025b/}} do not merge). Other speakers may pronounce it as {{IPA|[\u026a]}}, just as in many other accents, or with a schwa-like ({{IPA|[\u0259]}}) quality. Others may pronounce it almost as {{IPA|[\u028c]}} in certain environments, particularly after {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/hw/}}.\n\n[[File:Scottish English monophthongs chart.svg|thumb|250px|[[Monophthong]]s of Scottish English (from {{harvcoltxt|Scobbie|Gordeeva|Matthews|2006|p=7}})]]\n<!--See also previous \"confusing\" phonology table [] for more info-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Scottish English vowels<ref>{{cite web|title=Accents of English from Around the World|editor=Heggarty, Paul |display-editors=etal |publisher=University of Edinburgh|year=2013|url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/research/gsound/}}</ref> {{nobold|(many individual words do not correspond)}}\n! colspan=\"3\"| Pure vowels\n|-\n!

Scottish Accents and Dialects in Trudgil, P. Language in the British Isles. 1984. p.105-108</ref> covert Scotticisms, which generally go unnoticed as being particularly Scottish by those using them, and overt Scotticisms, usually used for stylistic effect, with those using them aware of their Scottish nature.\n\n===Lexical===\n[[File:Outwith.JPG|right|thumb|150px|An example of \"outwith\" on a sign in Scotland]]\nScottish English has inherited a number of lexical items from Scots,<ref>Aitken A.J. ''Scottish Speech'' in Languages of Scotland, Association for Scottish Literary Studies, Occasional Paper 4, Edinburgh:Chambers 1979. p.106-107</ref> which are less common in other forms of standard English.{{citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nGeneral items are ''wee'', the Scots word for small (also common in [[New Zealand English]], probably under Scottish influence); ''wean'' or ''bairn'' for child (the latter from Common Germanic,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/14726?redirectedFrom=bairn#eid|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|work=oed.com}}</ref> cf modern [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''barn'', [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] ''bern'' and also used in [[English language in northern England|Northern English dialects]]); ''[[bonnie]]'' for pretty, attractive, (or good looking, handsome, as in the case of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie)]]; ''braw'' for fine; ''muckle'' for big; ''spail or skelf'' for splinter, ''snib'' for bolt, ''pinkie'' for little finger, ''janitor'' for school caretaker (these last two are also standard in [[American English]]), ''outwith'', meaning 'outside of'; ''cowp'' for tip or spill, ''fankle'' for a tangled mess. ''Kirk'' for church has parallels in other Germanic languages (cf ''kirche'' which was also found in archaic names of some ancient churches in e.g. London). Examples of culturally specific items are ''[[Hogmanay]]''; ''[[caber toss|caber]]'', ''[[haggis]]'', ''[[bothy]]''; ''[[scone]]''; ''[[oatcake]]''; ''[[Tablet (confectionery)|tablet]]''; ''rone'' (roof gutter); ''[[teuchter]]'', ''[[Ned (Scottish)|ned]]'', ''numpty'' (witless person; now more common in the rest of the UK) and ''landward'' (rural); ''It's your shot'' for \"It's your turn\"; and the once notorious but now obsolete ''[[tawse]]''.\n\nThe diminutive ending \"-ie\" is added to nouns to indicate smallness, as in ''laddie'' and ''lassie'' for a young boy and young girl. Other examples are ''peirie'' (child's wooden spinning top) and ''sweetie'' (piece of [[confectionery]]). The ending can be added to many words instinctively, e.g. ''bairn'' (see above) can become ''bairnie'', a small shop can become a ''wee shoppie''. These diminutives are particularly common among the older generations and when talking to children. \n\nThe use of \"How?\" meaning \"Why?\" is distinctive of Scottish, [[Northern England English|Northern English]] and [[Mid Ulster English|Northern Irish English]]. \"Why not?\" is often rendered as \"How no?\".\n\nThere is a range of (often anglicised) legal and administrative vocabulary inherited from Scots<ref>Murison, David (1977, \u00b21978) ''The Guid Scots Tongue'', Edinburgh, William Blackwood, pp. 53-54</ref> e.g. ''depute'' {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u025bpjut/}} for ''deputy'', ''[[Not proven|proven]]'' {{IPA|/\u02c8pro\u02d0v\u0259n/}} for ''proved'' (standard in American English), ''interdict'' for '\"injunction\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/interdict |title=Dictionary of the Scots Language :: SND :: Interdict n., v |publisher=Dsl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-12-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/interdict |title=interdict - definition of interdict in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-25}}</ref> and ''[[sheriff-substitute]]'' for \"acting sheriff'\". In Scottish education a ''short leet'' is a list of selected job applicants, and a ''remit'' is a detailed job description. ''[[Provost (civil)#Scotland|Provost]]'' is used for \"mayor\" and ''[[procurator fiscal]]'' for \"public prosecutor\".\n\nOften, lexical differences between Scottish English and Southern Standard English are simply differences in the distribution of shared lexis, such as ''stay'' for \"live\" (as in: ''where do you stay?'').\n\n===Grammatical===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}\nThe progressive verb forms are used rather more frequently than in other varieties of standard English, for example with some [[stative verb]]s (''I'm wanting a drink''). The future progressive frequently implies an assumption (''You'll be coming from Glasgow?'').\n\nIn some areas perfect aspect of a verb is indicated using \"be\" as auxiliary with the preposition \"after\" and the present participle: for example \"He is after going\" instead of \"He has gone\" (this construction is borrowed from [[Scottish Gaelic]]).\n\nThe definite article tends to be used more frequently in phrases such as ''I've got the cold/the flu'', ''he's at the school'', ''I'm away to the kirk''.\n\nSpeakers often use prepositions differently. The compound preposition ''off of'' is often used (''Take that off of the table''). Scots commonly say ''I was waiting on you'' (meaning \"waiting for you\"), which means something quite different in Standard English.\n\nIn colloquial speech ''shall'' and ''ought'' are scarce, ''must'' is marginal for obligation and ''may'' is rare.

Since England was the larger and richer of the two Kingdoms, James moved his court to [[London]] in England. The poets of the court therefore moved south and \"began adapting the language and style of their verse to the tastes of the English market\".<ref name=\"m36\">McClure (1994), p. 36</ref> To this event McClure attributes \"the sudden and total eclipse of Scots as a literary language\".<ref name=\"m36\"/> The continuing absence of a Scots translation of the Bible meant that [[Authorized King James Version|the translation of King James]] into English was used in worship in both countries.\n\nThe [[Acts of Union 1707]] amalgamated the Scottish and English Parliaments. However the church, educational and legal structures remained separate. This leads to important professional distinctions in the definitions of some words and terms. There are therefore words with precise definitions in Scottish English which have either no place in English English or have a different definition.\n<!--\nDespite this, the mother tongues of Scottish people remained overwhelmingly Gaelic (in the Highlands) and Scots (in the Lowlands).<ref name=\"m37\">McClure (1994), p. 37</ref>  English was restricted to members of the Scottish aristocracy who spent time in London.<ref name=\"m37\"/>\nPlease add more details: for what period was English restricted to the London-traveling aristocracy? How do we evidence this, especially given the fuzzy line between Scots and English?\nAlso, re McClure (1994) \u2013 the page references are great, but I was unable to find the book. Can you give more details there too?\n-->\n\n==Phonology==\n{{listen|filename=RenfrewshireAccent.ogg|title=Speech example|description=An example of a Scottish male with a middle-class [[Renfrewshire]] accent}}\n\nThe speech of the middle classes in Scotland tends to conform to the grammatical norms of the written standard, particularly in situations that are regarded as formal. [[Highland English]] is slightly different from the variety spoken in the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]] in that it is more phonologically, grammatically, and lexically influenced by a [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] [[substratum]]. Similarly, the English spoken in the North-East of Scotland tends to follow the phonology and grammar of [[Doric dialect (Scotland)|Doric]].\n\nAlthough pronunciation features vary among speakers (depending on region and social status), there are a number of phonological aspects characteristic of Scottish English:\n\n* Scottish English is a [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic accent]], meaning {{IPA|/r/}} is typically pronounced in the [[syllable coda]]. The phoneme {{IPA|/r/}} may be a [[postalveolar approximant]] {{IPA|[\u0279]}}, as in Received Pronunciation or General American, but speakers have also traditionally used for the same phoneme a somewhat more common [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[\u027e]}} or, now very rare, the [[alveolar trill]] {{IPA|[r]}}<ref>Lodge, Ken (2009). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_nVT_qNvbusC&dq= A Critical Introduction to Phonetics]''. A & C Black. p. 180</ref> (hereafter, {{angle bracket|r}} will be used to denote any rhotic consonant).\n**Although other dialects have merged non-intervocalic {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, {{IPA|/\u026a/}}, {{IPA|/\u028c/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} ([[Fern-fir-fur merger|fern\u2013fir\u2013fur merger]]), Scottish English makes a distinction between the vowels in ''fern'', ''fir'', and ''fur''.\n**Many varieties contrast {{IPA|/o/}} and {{IPA|/\u0254/}} before {{IPA|/r/}} so that ''hoarse'' and ''horse'' are pronounced differently.\n**{{IPA|/or/}} and {{IPA|/ur/}} are contrasted so that ''shore'' and ''sure'' are pronounced differently, as are ''pour'' and ''poor''.\n**{{IPA|/r/}} before {{IPA|/l/}} is strong. An [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] vowel may occur between {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/l/}} so that ''girl'' and ''world'' are two-syllable words for some speakers. The same may occur between {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}, between {{IPA|/r/}} and {{IPA|/n/}}, and between {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/m/}}.\n*There is a distinction between {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|[[Voiceless labialized velar approximant|/hw/]]}} in word pairs such as ''witch'' and ''which''.\n*The phoneme {{IPA|[[Voiceless velar fricative|/x/]]}} is common in names and in SSE's many Gaelic and Scots borrowings, so much so that it is often taught to incomers, particularly for \"ch\" in loch. Some Scottish speakers use it in words of Greek origin as well, such as technical, patriarch, etc. (Wells 1982, 408). \n*{{IPA|/l/}} is usually [[Velarization|velarised]] (see [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant|dark l]]) except in borrowings like \"glen\" (from Scottish Gaelic \"gleann\"), which had an unvelarised l in their original form. In areas where [[Scottish Gaelic]] was spoken until relatively recently (such as [[Dumfries]] and [[Galloway]]) and in areas where it is still spoken (such as the [[West Highlands]]), velarisation of {{IPA|/l/}} may be absent in many words in which it is present in other areas, but remains in borrowings that had velarised {{IPA|/l/}} in Gaelic, such as \"loch\" (Gaelic \"loch\") and \"clan\" (Gaelic \"clann\").\n*{{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/k/}} are not [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] in more traditional varieties,<ref>{{cite web|title=Wir Ain Leid|url=http://www.scots-online.org/grammar/sse.htm|accessdate=18 March 2012|location=section \"Consonants\"}}</ref> but are weakly aspirated currently.\n*The past ending ''-ed'' may be realised with {{IPA|/t/}} where other accents use {{IPA|/d/}}, chiefly after unstressed vowels: ''ended'' {{IPA|[\u025bnd\u026at]}}, ''carried'' {{IPA|[kar\u026at]}}\n*[[Vowel length]] is generally regarded as non-phonemic, although a distinctive part of Scottish English is the [[Scots vowel length rule]] (Scobbie et al. 1999). Certain vowels (such as {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/u/}}, and {{IPA|/a\u026a/}}) are generally long but are shortened before [[nasal stop|nasals]] and voiced [[plosive consonant|plosives]]. However, this does not occur across morpheme boundaries so that ''need'' contrasts with ''kneed'', ''crude'' with ''crewed'' and ''side'' with ''sighed''.\n*Scottish English has no {{IPA|/\u028a/}}, instead transferring Scots {{IPA|/u/}}. Phonetically, this vowel may be pronounced {{IPA|[\u0289]}} or even {{IPA|[\u028f]}}. Thus ''pull'' and ''pool'' are homophones.\n*''Cot'' and ''caught'' are not differentiated in most Central Scottish varieties, as they are in some other varieties.<ref name=\"Wells, pp. 399 ff\">Wells, pp. 399 ff.</ref>\n*In most varieties, there is no {{IPA|/\u00e6/}}-{{IPA|/\u0251\u02d0/}} distinction; therefore, ''bath'', ''trap'', and ''palm'' have the same vowel.<ref name=\"Wells, pp. 399 ff\"/>\n*The ''happY'' vowel is most commonly {{IPA|/e/}} (as in ''face''), but may also be {{IPA|/\u026a/}} (as in ''kit'') or {{IPA|/i/}} (as in ''fleece'').<ref>Wells, p. 405.</ref>\n*{{IPA|/\u03b8s/}} is often used in plural nouns where southern English has {{IPA|/\u00f0z/}} (baths, youths, etc.); ''with'' and ''booth'' are pronounced with {{IPA|/\u03b8/}}. (See [[Pronunciation of English th]].)\n*In colloquial speech, the [[glottal stop]] may be an allophone of {{IPA|/t/}} after a vowel, as in {{IPA|[\u02c8b\u028c\u0294\u0259r]}}. These same speakers may \"drop the g\" in the suffix ''-ing'' and [[Th-glottalization|debuccalise]] {{IPA|/\u03b8/}} to {{IPA|[h]}} in certain contexts.\n*{{IPA|/\u026a/}} may be more open {{IPA|[\u00eb\u031e]}} for certain speakers in some regions, so that it sounds more like {{IPA|[\u025b]}} (although {{IPA|/\u026a/}} and {{IPA|/\u025b/}} do not merge). Other speakers may pronounce it as {{IPA|[\u026a]}}, just as in many other accents, or with a schwa-like ({{IPA|[\u0259]}}) quality. Others may pronounce it almost as {{IPA|[\u028c]}} in certain environments, particularly after {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/hw/}}.\n\n[[File:Scottish English monophthongs chart.svg|thumb|250px|[[Monophthong]]s of Scottish English (from {{harvcoltxt|Scobbie|Gordeeva|Matthews|2006|p=7}})]]\n<!--See also previous \"confusing\" phonology table [] for more info-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Scottish English vowels<ref>{{cite web|title=Accents of English from Around the World|editor=Heggarty, Paul |display-editors=etal |publisher=University of Edinburgh|year=2013|url=http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/research/gsound/}}</ref> {{nobold|(many individual words do not correspond)}}\n! colspan=\"3\"| Pure vowels\n|-\n!

''Scottish Speech'' in Languages of Scotland, Association for Scottish Literary Studies, Occasional Paper 4, Edinburgh:Chambers 1979. p.106-107</ref> which are less common in other forms of standard English.{{citation needed|date=December 2008}}\n\nGeneral items are ''wee'', the Scots word for small (also common in [[New Zealand English]], probably under Scottish influence); ''wean'' or ''bairn'' for child (the latter from Common Germanic,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/14726?redirectedFrom=bairn#eid|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|work=oed.com}}</ref> cf modern [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Faroese language|Faroese]] ''barn'', [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] ''bern'' and also used in [[English language in northern England|Northern English dialects]]); ''[[bonnie]]'' for pretty, attractive, (or good looking, handsome, as in the case of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie)]]; ''braw'' for fine; ''muckle'' for big; ''spail or skelf'' for splinter, ''snib'' for bolt, ''pinkie'' for little finger, ''janitor'' for school caretaker (these last two are also standard in [[American English]]), ''outwith'', meaning 'outside of'; ''cowp'' for tip or spill, ''fankle'' for a tangled mess. ''Kirk'' for church has parallels in other Germanic languages (cf ''kirche'' which was also found in archaic names of some ancient churches in e.g. London). Examples of culturally specific items are ''[[Hogmanay]]''; ''[[caber toss|caber]]'', ''[[haggis]]'', ''[[bothy]]''; ''[[scone]]''; ''[[oatcake]]''; ''[[Tablet (confectionery)|tablet]]''; ''rone'' (roof gutter); ''[[teuchter]]'', ''[[Ned (Scottish)|ned]]'', ''numpty'' (witless person; now more common in the rest of the UK) and ''landward'' (rural); ''It's your shot'' for \"It's your turn\"; and the once notorious but now obsolete ''[[tawse]]''.\n\nThe diminutive ending \"-ie\" is added to nouns to indicate smallness, as in ''laddie'' and ''lassie'' for a young boy and young girl. Other examples are ''peirie'' (child's wooden spinning top) and ''sweetie'' (piece of [[confectionery]]). The ending can be added to many words instinctively, e.g. ''bairn'' (see above) can become ''bairnie'', a small shop can become a ''wee shoppie''. These diminutives are particularly common among the older generations and when talking to children. \n\nThe use of \"How?\" meaning \"Why?\" is distinctive of Scottish, [[Northern England English|Northern English]] and [[Mid Ulster English|Northern Irish English]]. \"Why not?\" is often rendered as \"How no?\".\n\nThere is a range of (often anglicised) legal and administrative vocabulary inherited from Scots<ref>Murison, David (1977, \u00b21978) ''The Guid Scots Tongue'', Edinburgh, William Blackwood, pp. 53-54</ref> e.g. ''depute'' {{IPA|/\u02c8d\u025bpjut/}} for ''deputy'', ''[[Not proven|proven]]'' {{IPA|/\u02c8pro\u02d0v\u0259n/}} for ''proved'' (standard in American English), ''interdict'' for '\"injunction\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/interdict |title=Dictionary of the Scots Language :: SND :: Interdict n., v |publisher=Dsl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-12-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/interdict |title=interdict - definition of interdict in English from the Oxford dictionary |publisher=Oxforddictionaries.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-25}}</ref> and ''[[sheriff-substitute]]'' for \"acting sheriff'\". In Scottish education a ''short leet'' is a list of selected job applicants, and a ''remit'' is a detailed job description. ''[[Provost (civil)#Scotland|Provost]]'' is used for \"mayor\" and ''[[procurator fiscal]]'' for \"public prosecutor\".\n\nOften, lexical differences between Scottish English and Southern Standard English are simply differences in the distribution of shared lexis, such as ''stay'' for \"live\" (as in: ''where do you stay?'').\n\n===Grammatical===\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2012}}\nThe progressive verb forms are used rather more frequently than in other varieties of standard English, for example with some [[stative verb]]s (''I'm wanting a drink''). The future progressive frequently implies an assumption (''You'll be coming from Glasgow?'').\n\nIn some areas perfect aspect of a verb is indicated using \"be\" as auxiliary with the preposition \"after\" and the present participle: for example \"He is after going\" instead of \"He has gone\" (this construction is borrowed from [[Scottish Gaelic]]).\n\nThe definite article tends to be used more frequently in phrases such as ''I've got the cold/the flu'', ''he's at the school'', ''I'm away to the kirk''.\n\nSpeakers often use prepositions differently. The compound preposition ''off of'' is often used (''Take that off of the table''). Scots commonly say ''I was waiting on you'' (meaning \"waiting for you\"), which means something quite different in Standard English.\n\nIn colloquial speech ''shall'' and ''ought'' are scarce, ''must'' is marginal for obligation and ''may'' is rare. Here are other syntactical structures:\n\n* ''What age are you?'' for \"How old are you?\"\n* ''My hair is needing washed'' or ''My hair needs washed'' for \"My hair needs washing\" or \"My hair needs to be washed\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scots-online.org/grammar/sse.htm|title=Scottish Standard English|work=scots-online.org}}</ref>\n* ''I'm just after telling you'' for \"I've just told you\".\n* ''[[Amn't]] I invited?'' for ''Am I not invited?''\n\nNote that in Scottish English, the first person declarative ''I amn't invited'' and interrogative ''Amn't I invited?'' are both possible.\n\n==See also==\n {{Div col}}\n* [[Bungi creole]] of the Canadian [[Metis people]] of Scottish/British descent\n* [[Dialect]]\n* [[Glasgow patter]]\n* [[Hiberno-English]]\n* [[Highland English]]\n* [[Languages of the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Regional accents of English]]\n* [[Scottish Gaelic language]]\n* [[Scottish Corpus of Texts and Speech]]\n* [[Ulster English]]\n {{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book|author=Abercrombie, D.|year=1979|chapter=The accents of Standard English in Scotland.|editor1=A.
