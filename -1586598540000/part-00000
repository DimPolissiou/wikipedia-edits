Other impacts included: the closure of 368 National Park sites resulted in the loss of some seven million visitors; 200,000 applications for passports were not processed; and 20,000-30,000 applications by foreigners for visas went unprocessed each day; U.S. tourism and airline industries incurred millions of dollars in losses; more than 20% of federal contracts, representing $3.7 billion in spending, were affected adversely.

The hosts, on the other hand, had 169 athletes competing and won 46 medals. The American team did its best, but managed to grab only 20 medals, being dwarfed by an enormous Greek team. However, the United States managed to get the most gold medals, 11, edging Greece that secured 10 golds. That allowed Team USA to finish first in the gold medal tally. [[James Brendan Connolly|James Connolly]] became the first modern Olympic champion by winning the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's triple jump|triple jump]], and [[Thomas Burke (athlete)|Thomas Burke]] grabbed three gold medals in various track events, assuming the title of the most successful athlete of the 1896 Games.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1896/</ref>\n\n[[File:Margaret-abbott-gold-medal-1900-golf.jpg|thumb|left|[[Margaret Abbott]] competing in golf]]\nAt the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Paris Olympics]], the US team featured 75 athletes, a significant increase compared to 1896, but still considerably less than the French hosts that fielded 720 competitors. The most notable of all American participants was [[Margaret Abbott]] who became the first female American Olympic champion by winning the [[Golf at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's individual|women's golf]]. The vast majority of American medals were won in the sport of [[Athletics at the 1900 Summer Olympics|athletics]] where US athletes clinched 16 gold and 39 medals overall. Team USA won only 8 medals outside of track, four of them in golf. Overall, France dominated the medal standings, winning 29 gold and 112 total medals. The United States ranked second with 19 and 48, respectively, showing great efficiency, despite having significantly less athletes.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1900/</ref>\n\n[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Olympic Field]] of [[Washington University in St. Louis]], site of the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics Games]]]]\nThe [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] were the first ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.\n\n===Interwar period (1920\u20131936)===\n\n===Cold War era (1948\u20131992)===\n[[File:Bob Mathias 1952.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Bob Mathias]] became the star of the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London games]] by winning the [[Athletics at the 1948 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|decathlon]] event at the age of 17.

The Soviets themselves declined to compete, sending only observers, after a long hesitation that saw Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] demanding guarantees from his sports officials that the USSR would beat the US in the medal standings. The Soviet officials told him that chances were 50/50, and Stalin ultimately rejected the idea of competing in 1948. With its newest political rival absent, the United States comfortably dominated the games, winning 38 gold and 84 total medals, 22 gold and 40 total medals more than the runner-up [[Sweden at the 1948 Summer Olympics|Sweden]]. The most medals were won in track and field, 27, and swimming, 15.

The Soviets viewed the Olympics as international battlefield, where they can achieve their political goals by winning medals, thus proving their system\u2019s superiority.<ref>http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/</ref><ref>www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf</ref> The Soviet authorities also significantly bent the amateur rules, that were in place at the time, by providing state-funding to their athletes who trained full-time and, unlike American self-financed amateurs, were ''[[de facto]]'' professionals. That would start a significant controversy, that will result in the amateur rules being abolished, though only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], meaning that the Soviets benefited from those rules throughout their Olympic history.<ref>http://www.processhistory.org/redihan-1952-olympics/</ref> The United States still topped the medal count at these games, winning 40 gold and 76 total medals, 22 gold and 5 total medals more than the [[Soviet Union at the 1952 Summer Olympics|Soviets]] who finished second. American athletes won 31 medals in track and field, their most successful sport. [[1952 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its third consecutive gold, twice defeating the Soviets in the process, American boxers won all five finals they entered, and American weightlifters edged their Soviet rivals 4 to 3 in terms of gold medals, with the two nations sweeping all seven events in the sport.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1952/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bobby Morrow with wife 1956.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Bobby Morrow]] won gold in 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay (track and field) at the [[Athletics at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Olympics]] in [[Melbourne]].]]\n[[Melbourne]] hosted the Olympics in [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]]. There were calls for the expulsion of the Soviet Union following their [[Soviet invasion of Hungary|invasion of Hungary]], but the [[International Olympic Committee]] decided not to pursue any action. As a result, some nations boycotted the games in protest of the Soviets' presence, and the Hungarians themselves became engaged in a violent brawl with their Soviet counterparts in a water polo game, an event that was instantly called [[Blood in the Water match|Blood in the Water]]. The US performance at the games was relatively successful, though it was getting harder and harder to compete with the Soviet machine. As a result, the Americans earned 32 gold and 78 total medals (second place in the medal standings), 5 gold and 24 total medals less than the first-placed Soviets. The US contingent was particularly successful in track and field, where American athletes amassed 31 medals. On the other hand, the US won only 2 golds in swimming, being unable to stop the Australian domination of the swimming events at these games. In weightlifting, the Americans and Soviets once again won all seven events, once again with a 4 to 3 ratio in favor of the US team. In boxing, the Soviets won 3 golds, while the Americans only managed to win two events. However, it was gymnastics where the USSR achieved its greatest success, winning 11 out of 17 events and guaranteeing the first place in the medal rankings. The [[1956 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its fourth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final game, 89\u201355.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1956/</ref>\n\n[[File:Giuseppina leone.jpg|260px|left|thumb|[[Wilma Rudolph]] became the first woman in history to sweep 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay at the [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Games]].]]\nThe [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Olympics]] saw the Americans losing their grip on their traditionally successful sports, such as track and field and weightlifting. On the other hand, boxing, swimming (where the Americans won 9 gold medals, while being controversially denied gold in the [[Swimming at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre freestyle|100 meters freestyle]], despite showing the best time), and wrestling produced unexpectedly good results, which somewhat helped to compensate for what was lost in other sports. In track and field, the Soviets won 11 golds, only one less that the Americans. It is worth mentioning that the US team encountered many problems throughout the meet, such as a controversial disqualification of their gold medal winning [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay|men's 4x100 relay team]]. In weightlifting, the Soviets, with the help of their state-of-the-art doping program, won five out of seven events, leaving the US with only one gold. 10 Soviet golds in gymnastics didn't surprise anyone, as the nation had always been a gymnastics powerhouse, but it did mean that the Soviets beat the Americans in the medal standings for the second straight summer games. The [[1960 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]], however, met the pre-tournament expectations and won its fifth consecutive gold medal, a noble feat, given that they had to compete against veteran pros from the USSR. The final result, 43 gold and 103 total medals for the Soviets to 34 gold and 71 total medals for the Americans, showed that America was no longer a leading force in Olympic competition.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1960/</ref>\n\n[[File:Don Schollander 1964.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Don Schollander]] won 4 golds in swimming at the [[Swimming at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964 games]] in [[Tokyo]], the largest individual medal haul in a single Olympics since [[Jesse Owens]] in 1936.]]\nThere was some redemption for the US at the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], as the nation returned to the top of the [[1964 Summer Olympics medal table|gold medal count]] for the first time since 1952. Particularly successful was the US swimming team that won 13 out of available 18 golds and shattered 9 world records. In track and field, the Americans also improved on their 1960 performance, winning 14 gold and 24 total medals, while the Soviets left Japan with 5 gold and 18 total medals, a significant downturn compared to their 1960 results. The Soviets, however, continued to dominate Olympic weightlifting, and, with the American program falling apart, the USSR produced four golds and three silvers. The Soviet Union hoped to replicate that success in gymnastics and wrestling, the sports that, together with weightlifting, were strongly associated with their athletic prowess. However, they encountered a zealous resistance from the Japanese, who used their [[home advantage|home-field advantage]] to stun the Soviets, beating them five to three in wrestling golds, and winning five gymnastics championships to their four. Thus, Japan had a major influence on the US\u2013USSR medals race, and most certainly helped the Americans edge their biggest rivals, while also managing to produce its best ever medal output and finishing in third place. For the Americans, despite their dismal performance in boxing where they achieved only one gold, the 1964 Olympics were a definite success, with the nation winning 36 gold and 90 total medals compared to the Soviet tally of 30 gold and 96 total medals. Therefore, the US topped the gold medal count, finishing second in the total medal count, while the USSR topped the total medal count, finishing second in the gold medal count. The [[1964 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its sixth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final, 73\u201359.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1964/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bob Beamon 1968.jpg|200px|right|thumb|There were many historic achievements at the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City Olympics]] but, perhaps, the most significant among them was [[Bob Beamon]]'s performance in the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's long jump|long jump]], where he improved the world record by 55 cm.]]\nThe [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico Olympics]] became the most successful summer games for the US in the post-war era. American athletes amassed 45 gold and 107 total medals, 16 gold and 16 total medals more than the second-placed Soviets. The US swimming team dominated the competition, winning a staggering 51 medals and sweeping the podium on five occasions. The Americans also managed to medal in every single of 29 swimming events, thus achieving a unique feat. The US track and field team pulled off a stellar performance as well with 15 gold and 28 total medals. Overall, swimming and athletics accounted for more than 70% of all US medals, and ensured the first place in the medal table for the Americans, their second consecutive first-place finish in terms of gold medals, and their first finish at the top of the overall medal table since 1952. In other sports, however, the performance of American athletes was less convincing. The US weightlifting team continued to fade away, winning just one medal (compared to 7 in 1956), American boxers won 7 medals, though only two of them gold, US divers won 6 medals, and the men's volleyball team managed to stun the defending champions from the Soviet Union, beating them in five sets, but still finished out of medals; Soviets ultimately won gold, with their lone loss being to the US. In gymnastics, Japan continued to frustrate the Soviets, once again surpassing them in the medal standings. Last but not least, the [[1968 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its seventh consecutive gold medal, a feat not matched by any other Olympic team in ball sports. Very few would have assumed that this was the last time that the US finished first in the medal table in a fully attended Summer Olympics until 1996 (the Americans would top the medal standings in 1984 with the Soviet Union and its satellites boycotting).<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1968/</ref>\n\nThe [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich Olympics]] saw the Soviet Union begin its streak of topping the medal count at five consecutive summer games in which they participated (1972\u20131992, though in 1992 they would compete as the ''[[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]]'' as the USSR [[Fall of the Soviet Union|dissolved]] half a year prior to the games, and the newly independent countries decided to compete together). The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the [[Munich massacre]] in the second week, in which eleven [[Israel]]i [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|athletes and coaches]] and a West German police officer at Olympic village were killed by [[Black September Organization|Black September]] terrorists. There were multiple calls to cancel the games after the terrorist attack, but the IOC declined. From a sporting standpoint, these games were one of the most controversial in history, with many accusing the organizing committee of anti-Americanism and trying to appease the Soviet Union and East Germany. Indeed, these were one the strangest Olympics ever for American athletes. US world record holders in the [[Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|100 meters]] were given the wrong starting time and were unable to compete in the event, thus paving the way for a Soviet to win. In swimming, the US gold medal winner in the [[Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 400 metre freestyle|400 meters freestyle]] was stripped of his medal for using his prescription asthma medication, also depriving him of a chance at multiple medals. US boxers complained that they were judged unfairly in the bouts against their communist counterparts. In shooting, a US athlete initially won the [[Shooting at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle, prone|50 meters rifle]] only to be relegated to silver after a \"review\". Finally, in the most controversial event of the games, and one of the most controversial events of all time, the [[1972 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] was denied gold after apparently winning the final match against the Soviet Union. The final three seconds of the game were replayed three times until the Soviets came out on top. The Americans did not accept the silver medals, believing that they were robbed. This was the first US loss in Olympic basketball history and it ended the Americans' 63-game winning streak in Olympic basketball. In general, the US team greatly underperformed at these games, winning only 6 gold medals in track and field to the East Germans' 8 and Soviets' 9, though the Americans still won the most total medals, 22. In boxing, the Cubans and Soviets dominated, winning three and two championships, respectively, while the US won only one gold and four medals overall (compared to the Soviets' two and Cubans' five). In diving, the Americans won three medals; in soccer, the USSR and GDR fixed a bronze medal game, playing a tie, so both teams received bronze; in gymnastics, the Soviets edged their old rivals Japan to top the medal count; in weightlifting, the Soviets and Bulgarians won three golds each; in wrestling, the US team surprised with three golds in freestyle, yet the Soviets still dwarfed their medal tally with nine golds in freestyle and greco-roman (14\u20136 in total medals). In water polo, the Americans struck bronze, tying the eventual gold medalists the Soviet Union in the final round. Swimming was the only sport where the American team did not disappoint, winning 17 gold and 43 total medals, a good result, but still less than four years earlier. American women dominated swimming for the last time until 1992, as by 1976 they would be overtaken by East German [[Doping in East Germany|dopers]].<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1972/</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc utterly dominated the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Montreal Olympics]], with seven communist countries placing in the top ten of the medal table. The United States team was relegated to a third place in the medal standings for the first time in its history, courtesy of Soviet and East German doping systems and their use of professional athletes. This was the Olympics of contrasts: the US men's swimming team, despite a generally dismal showing of the delegation, completely obliterated their sport, sweeping 12 gold and 27 total medals in the 13 events that were on the program and shattering 11 world records in the process (this was arguably the most dominant performance of any swimming team in history),<ref>https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/2016/07/31/docs-boys-story-dominant-us-swim-team-1976/87614856/</ref> while the US women's swimming team, on the other hand, fell victim to the unbeatable East German dopers. They still managed to win a gold medal, in a shocking upset against East Germans in the [[Swimming at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4x100 freestyle relay]]. The event was held on the last day of the swimming program, and the American women were risking to get shut out of gold for the first time in the US Olympic history. The victory was somewhat overlooked at the time, but since the early 1990s, when the crimes of the Soviet Bloc started to unravel, their gold medal is often considered to be one of the most improbable and heroic upsets of all time.<ref>https://www.dailynews.com/2016/06/04/40-years-later-story-of-us-east-german-olympic-swimmers-can-be-told-best-in-the-last-gold/</ref> In track and field, both the US men's and women's team were overwhelmed by East Germans who, as their Soviet masters expected, stole away a bulk of medals from the US in its signature sports, thus allowing the Soviets to win the medal table virtually unchallenged. The US boxing team surprised everyone, advancing to six gold medal bouts and winning five of them, drawing parallels to a stellar 1952 team that also took 5 golds. The achievement was even more momentous due to the fact that the American boxers were significantly younger and less experienced than their Cuban and Soviet counterparts.<ref>https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/15293108/1976-us-olympic-boxing-team-celebrate-40-year-reunion-boxing-hall-fame-banquet-champions</ref> In other sports, US divers won 5 medals, including two golds; the US equestrian team took home 4 medals; American shooters won three medals, including a historic silver by a woman in the [[Shooting at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle three positions|mixed 50 meters rifle three positions]]; US freestyle wrestlers advanced to four gold medal bouts, yet won only one of them (all four were against the Soviets), concluding the meet with 6 medals overall. The [[1976 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US men's basketball team]] reclaimed the gold medal, while the [[United States women's national basketball team|women's team]] won a surprising silver, being ranked no higher than sixth prior to the start of the tournament. The Soviets and East Germans were unstoppable in canoeing, gymnastics, rowing, weightlifting and wrestling, going 1\u20132 in the medal standings (49 gold and 125 total medals for the Soviets, and 40 gold and 90 total medals for East Germans). The US won medals in 14 sports, finishing third with 34 gold and 94 total medals. The most successful day for the Americans was July 31st when they won 8 gold and 18 total medals.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1976/</ref>\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics]] marked another first for the United States, as the nation led by far the largest and most significant [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] in the Olympic history. The boycott was motivated by the [[1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], as well as by flagrant human rights violations in the USSR, and the regime's [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] policies.<ref>U.

Indeed, all medal predictions pointed to an inevitable Soviet victory with 55\u201360 gold medals. East Germans were forecast to win 40\u201345 gold medals, while the Americans would wind up in third place with 30\u201335 golds. However, the world will never know what would have happened, as the United States and 65 other countries chose not to attend the Moscow Games, leaving them with the smallest attendance since 1956. Predictably, the great majority of the medals were taken by the [[Soviet Union at the 1980 Summer Olympics|host country]] and [[East Germany at the 1980 Summer Olympics|East Germany]] in what was the most skewed medal tally since [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]].<ref>Moscow 1980 Olympic Games. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online Library Edition: http://www.library.ebonline.com/eb/article-9098213</ref> The Soviets amassed 80 gold (all-time record) and 195 total (second-best result after the US in 1904) medals in their anticlimactic performance.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1980/</ref>\n\nIn [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], [[Los Angeles]] witnessed what was considered a retaliatory boycott by the Soviets and their satellites, although the Soviets cited security concerns and \"chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States.\" However, no threat to Eastern Bloc athletes was ever discovered, and the athletes from the Eastern Bloc country that did attend the 1984 games in Los Angeles&mdash;Romania&mdash;encountered no problems, and in fact were widely cheered above all other visiting nations at the Opening Ceremonies when they marched into the Coliseum (Romania ended up finishing third in overall medal count at the Games). The move by the Soviets left many \"dumbfounded\", as it was expected that they would try to thrash the US on their soil, thus achieving a significant propaganda victory. The forecasts again heavily favored the Soviet Union, with the Soviet athletes being expected to rack up 60\u201365 gold medals compared to 35\u201345 by the second-placed Americans. That didn't happen. Furthermore, despite the Soviet boycott, a record 140 nations (including China that participated for the first time since 1952) attended the games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|website=jimrome.com|title=Bryan Fogel talks 1984 Summer Olympics boycott on The Jim Rome Podcast|access-date=November 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122112500/http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|archive-date=November 22, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThere were fears that the Soviet Union would boycott the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]] as well because [[South Korea]] had no diplomatic relations with the USSR, which recognised and supported only [[North Korea]]. However, the policies of [[Perestroika]] that were initiated by [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] in 1985 led to the Soviet participation in the games. [[Cuba at the Summer Olympics|Cuba]], clearly not understanding such a betrayal, decided to boycott the Olympics on its own, impacting the boxing field as a result. The Soviet Union was steadily moving towards its ultimate [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|collapse]] but its sporting empire was still in its prime. The Soviets and their close allies from East Germany utterly dominated the games, winning 55 and 37 gold medals respectively (132 and 102 total medals). \n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] period The Americans did their best to challenge the Soviets, but the playing field wasn't level. The Soviet athletes were funded by the state and trained full-time, while the US strictly obeyed the amateur rules and its athletes were primarily self-financed students who were significantly younger and less experienced than the Soviet veterans. In addition to that, the Soviets developed a state-sponsored doping system, and supplied performance-enhancing drugs to the vast majority of their athletes.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html</ref> Furthermore, they heavily invested in the development of a similar system in their satellite nation, [[East Germany at the Olympics|East Germany]], with a specific goal of making East Germans highly competitive in swimming and track and field, so that they can reduce the number of medals the Americans win in their signature sports. Unfortunately for the US, the Soviet strategy worked, and the gap between the USSR and US widened every four years until the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1972, the Soviets won 50 gold and 99 total medals to the Americans' 33 and 94; in 1976, the USSR amassed 49 gold and 125 total medals to the Americans' 34 and 94; 1980 Olympics were boycotted by the US and its allies, the Soviets retaliated in 1984 by boycotting the LA Olympics together with their satellites; finally, in 1988, the USSR won 55 gold and 132 total medals to the Americans' 36 and 94 (the US finished third at those games, losing even to the East Germans). In 1992, the Soviets still fielded a team despite the dissolution of their state, yet the margin of their victory over the Americans became narrower: 45 gold and 112 total medals to the Americans' 37 and 108. By 1996, every former Soviet republic formed its own [[National Olympic Committee]], and the countries participated as independent nations, with Russia assuming the Soviet place in the IOC and inheriting Soviet achievements as by far the largest of the former Soviet republics. So, in 1996, the Americans finally managed to return to the top spot in the medal rankings, winning 44 gold and 101 total medals compared to 26 gold and 63 total medals won by the second-placed Russians, thanks to the partial abolition of the amateur rules in the early 1990s (the American athletes still weren't state-sponsored, unlike their foreign counterparts, but they were now eligible for prize money and sponsorships). They were still disadvantaged by these rules in those sports where they weren't abolished (i.e. boxing, baseball, where Cubans continued to field state-sponsored pros against American amateurs), but the situation started improving.\n\n===Modern period (1994\u2013present)===\n{{Expand section|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Amateurism and professionalism==\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic]] [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] in 1983 on compassionate grounds.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography |publisher=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017 |accessdate=9 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries eroded the ideology of the pure [[amateur sports#Olympics|amateur]], as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/|title=The Role of Sports in The Soviet Union - Guided History|website=blogs.bu.edu}}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cia.gov }}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\"/> The situation greatly disadvantaged American athletes, and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from [[Amateur sports|amateurism]], as envisioned by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], to allowing participation of [[professional athlete]]s, but only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and its influence within the [[International Olympic Committee]].\n\n==Russia\u2013United States rivalry==\n[[Russia]] (in all its incarnations) and the [[United States]] have won more Olympic medals than any other nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/262864/all-time-summer-olympics-medals-table/|title=All-time Summer Olympics medals table 1896-2016 &#124; Statistic|website=Statista}}</ref> Russia topped the [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|overall medal count]] at 7 Summer Olympics and 9 Winter Olympics, while the United States placed first at 17 Summer Olympics and 1 Winter Olympics.

The U.S. men's team was considered a favorite in the run-up to the 1972 Games. Since the first Olympic basketball tournament at the [[Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], the Americans haven't lost a single game, winning seven consecutive gold medals in a dominating fashion. Their record reached an unprecedented 63-0 before the final game. Since the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 tournament]] the Soviet team challenged the Americans, winning silver in 1952, [[Basketball at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956]], [[Basketball at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], [[Basketball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and bronze in [[Basketball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]. Outside of the Olympics, the Soviets had already defeated the U.S. team in the [[FIBA World Cup|World Championship]] play. However, the Americans never sent their best collegiate players to that tournament. \n\nIt is important to note that the Olympics strictly prohibited any involvement of professional athletes at the time. The Soviet Union and other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries used that rule to their advantage, listing all its top players as soldiers or workers what allowed them to breach the amateur rules. Western experts classified these athletes as professionals.<ref name=\"a1972\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/Classic_1972_usa_ussr_gold_medal_hoop.html|title=Classic 1972 USA vs. USSR Basketball game|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=August 6, 2004|accessdate=April 13, 2009}}</ref> On the other hand, leading American players were unable to play in the Olympics as they were officially professional and played in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. That disadvantage hadn't prevented the Americans from winning the first seven Olympic basketball tournaments without a single defeat.\n\nThe confrontation of the Soviet Union and United States on the [[basketball court]] was deeply connected to the confrontation on the political front. Many American viewers assumed that 1972 Games were openly [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]].<ref name=espn1>''By Frank Saraceno''.

American players usually participated in the Olympics once before turning pro, and the U.S. team always had new players every four years. The 1972 team didn't have a clear leader. A rising star [[Bill Walton]] declined an invitation to participate. Nevertheless, the team was heavily favored featuring such players as [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] or [[Tommy Burleson]] (the tallest player among all teams).\n\nThe young American team was confronted by a veteran Soviet team, featuring stars [[Sergei Belov]], [[Modestas Paulauskas]], and [[Alexander Belov]]. The players had played together for more than seven years. For [[Gennadi Volnov]] it was the fourth Olympic appearance.\n\nThe Soviets performed strongly at the beginning, winning the first half 26:21. The Soviets kept the Americans 4\u20138 points behind during the first half.\n\nIn the second half Soviets targeted [[Dwight Jones (basketball)|Dwight Jones]], as they considered him the leader of the U.S. team. On the 28th minute he was provoked by [[Mikheil Korkia]] and responded. Both players were sent off. The Soviets were satisfied, as they deemed Korkia less significant for them than Jones for the Americans. The next minute Alexander Belov hit [[Jim Brewer (basketball)|Jim Brewer]] during the free-throw, and Brewer was unable to continue playing. According to the Americans, the referees did not notice the foul.\n\nWith 10 minutes left, the Soviets increased their lead to 10 points. After that Americans finally started to press the Soviets. It helped them to cut the deficit to 1 point. Soviet players started to feel nervous. With less than a minute left, [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] stole a Soviet pass at halfcourt and was fouled hard by [[Zurab Sakandelidze]] as he drove toward the basket, being knocked down into the basket stanchion. With three seconds remaining on the game clock, Collins was awarded two free throws and sank the first to tie the score at 49. Just as Collins lifted the ball to begin his shooting motion in attempting the second free throw, the horn from the scorer's table sounded, marking the beginning of a chain of events that left the game's final three seconds mired in controversy. Although the unexpected sound of the horn caused lead referee [[Renato Righetto]] to turn away from the free throw attempt and look over to the scorer's table, play was not stopped. Collins never broke his shooting motion and continued with his second free throw, scoring to put the U.S. ahead by a score of 50:49. Immediately following Collins' free throws, the Soviets inbounded the ball and failed to score. Soviet coaches claimed that they had requested a timeout before Collins' foul shots. The referees ordered the clock reset to three seconds and the game's final seconds replayed. The horn sounded as a length-of-the-court Soviet pass was being released from the inbounding player, the pass missed its mark, and the American players began celebrating. Nevertheless, final three seconds were replayed for a third time. This time, the Soviets' [[Alexander Belov]] and the USA's [[Kevin Joyce (basketball)|Kevin Joyce]] and [[James Forbes (basketball)|Jim Forbes]] went up for the pass, and Belov caught the long pass from Ivan Edeshko near the American basket. Belov then laid the ball in for the winning points as the buzzer sounded.\n\nThe Americans regained the basketball crown in [[Basketball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], but their ability to stay competitive with college players against seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union was decreasing. In [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]], the Soviets beat the United States once again, eliminating them in the semifinals. That game was a turning point in international basketball, as [[FIBA]] officials started to realize that amateur rules were extremely unfair. In 1989, NBA players were finally allowed in the Olympics.\n\n===Ice hockey===\n{{see also|Miracle on Ice}}\n[[File:TeamUSA1980 stamp.png|thumb|upright|alt=Beige postage stamp featuring a brightly colored hockey player|Paraguayan stamp featuring U.S. vs USSR matchup.]]\nThe 1980 hockey game between the U.S. and USSR was dubbed the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\", when American college players defeated the heavily favored seasoned professionals from the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]] on the way to a gold medal at the [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the \"Miracle\" is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements. The U.S. also won the gold medal in the [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Games]] at [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], [[California]], defeating the Soviet Union, [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] along the way. However, since this victory is not as well known as the 1980 win, it has come to be known as the \"Forgotten Miracle\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Burnside|first=Scott|title=Hockey's miracle before the 'Miracle'|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/icehockey/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&id=4897805|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=February 8, 2010|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Morning Skate: The Forgotten Miracle of 1960|url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/the-morning-skate-the-forgotten-miracle-of-1960/|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 11, 2009|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Olympics in [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]]. As in 1980, the Soviets were represented by their star-studded veterans, while the Americans fielded a team of college players. The Soviets won the encounter 7\u20135 and went on to win the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh.\n\nThe two teams met again at the [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Olympics]] in a semi-final match. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5\u20132. While some stars had left the Soviet Union to play in the NHL, the Unified Team still boasted many veterans from their domestic professional league, while the Americans were represented primarily by college players. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia (the successor to the Unified Team) met twice at the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]]. The Americans won both games 5-2 en route to the tournament championship.\n\nThe U.S., coached by Herb Brooks, and Russia, coached by [[Viacheslav Fetisov|Slava Fetisov]], met twice in the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, which included a 2\u20132 round-robin draw and a 3\u20132 semi-final win for the Americans. The semi-final match was played 22 years to the day after the \"Miracle on Ice\" game.<ref name=\"sportsillustrated.cnn.com\"/> The U.S. eventually won silver, while Russia won bronze.\n\nThe two teams met in the quarterfinals of the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]], with the U.S. earning a decisive 5-3 victory.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia played each other in a round-robin game at the [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympics]] in Sochi. The game was tied 2\u20132 after overtime before the Americans prevailed in an eight-round shootout, with [[T.J. Oshie]] scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the United States. The match has been dubbed by some as the \"Marathon on Ice\" due to its length.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teamusa.org:443/Road-to-Sochi-2014/Features/2014/February/15/Team-USA-Beats-Russia-In-Marathon-On-Ice|title=Team USA Beats Russia In 'Marathon On Ice'|website=Team USA}}</ref> Both teams, however, failed to medal; the Americans finished fourth (losing in the semis to Canada and to Finland in the bronze medal game), while the Russians placed fifth (losing to Finland in the quarterfinals).\n\n==See also==\n*[[United States at the Summer Olympics]]\n*[[United States at the Winter Olympics]]\n*[[List of United States Olympic medalists]]\n*[[United States at the Paralympics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |title=United States of America |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/united-states-of-america }}\n* {{IOC medals|NOC=USA}}\n* {{cite web |title=Olympic Medal Winners |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/athletes?search=1&countryname=united%20states%20of%20america }}\n* {{cite web |title=United States |publisher=Sports-Reference.com |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA }}\n\n{{country at games navbox|United States|Olympics}}\n{{Nations at the Olympics}}\n{{National sports teams of the United States}}\n{{Sport in the United States}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:United States At The Olympics}}\n[[Category:United States at the Olympics| ]]\n[[Category:National sports teams of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{infobox country at games\n| NOC = USA\n| NOCname = [[United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee]]\n| games = Olympics\n| year = \n| flagcaption = [[Flag of the United States]]\n| oldcode = \n| website = \n| location = \n| competitors = \n| sports = \n| flagbearer = \n| rank = 1\n| gold = 1127\n| silver = 907\n| bronze = 793\n| officials = \n| appearances = \n| app_begin_year = \n| app_end_year = \n| summerappearances = {{Team appearances list|team=United States|competition=Summer Olympics|begin_year=|end_year= }}\n| winterappearances = {{Team appearances list|team=United States|competition=Winter Olympics|begin_year=|end_year= }}\n| seealso = [[United States at the 1906 Intercalated Games|1906]] Intercalated Games\n}}\n{{See also|United States at the Summer Olympics|United States at the Winter Olympics}}\nThe '''[[United States|United States of America]]''' (USA) has sent athletes to every celebration of the modern [[Olympic Games]] with the exception of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], during which it led a [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]].

The US is ranked first in the all-time medal table even if [[All-time Olympic Games medal table#Combined total|all the incarnations of Russia and Germany are combined]], leading the second-placed Russians by 402 gold and 917 total medals. These achievements are even more impressive considering the fact that the American Olympic team remains the only in the world to receive no government funding.<ref>https://www.teamusa.org/about-the-usoc</ref>\n\n== Hosted Games ==\nThe United States has hosted the Games on '''eight''' occasions, more than any other nation, and is planning to host the '''ninth''':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The hosts, on the other hand, had 169 athletes competing and won 46 medals. The American team did its best, but managed to grab only 20 medals, being dwarfed by an enormous Greek team. However, the United States managed to get the most gold medals, 11, edging Greece that secured 10 golds. That allowed Team USA to finish first in the gold medal tally. [[James Brendan Connolly|James Connolly]] became the first modern Olympic champion by winning the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's triple jump|triple jump]], and [[Thomas Burke (athlete)|Thomas Burke]] grabbed three gold medals in various track events, assuming the title of the most successful athlete of the 1896 Games.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1896/</ref>\n\n[[File:Margaret-abbott-gold-medal-1900-golf.jpg|thumb|left|[[Margaret Abbott]] competing in golf]]\nAt the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Paris Olympics]], the US team featured 75 athletes, a significant increase compared to 1896, but still considerably less than the French hosts that fielded 720 competitors. The most notable of all American participants was [[Margaret Abbott]] who became the first female American Olympic champion by winning the [[Golf at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's individual|women's golf]]. The vast majority of American medals were won in the sport of [[Athletics at the 1900 Summer Olympics|athletics]] where US athletes clinched 16 gold and 39 medals overall. Team USA won only 8 medals outside of track, four of them in golf. Overall, France dominated the medal standings, winning 29 gold and 112 total medals. The United States ranked second with 19 and 48, respectively, showing great efficiency, despite having significantly less athletes.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1900/</ref>\n\n[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Olympic Field]] of [[Washington University in St. Louis]], site of the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics Games]]]]\nThe [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] were the first ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.\n\n===Interwar period (1920\u20131936)===\n\n===Cold War era (1948\u20131992)===\n[[File:Bob Mathias 1952.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Bob Mathias]] became the star of the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London games]] by winning the [[Athletics at the 1948 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|decathlon]] event at the age of 17. He would go on to repeat this feat at the [[Athletics at the 1952 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|1952 Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]], setting a new world record.]]\nThe [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London Olympics]] marked the first time that the newly communist countries, that were occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] after [[World War Two|WW2]], competed in the games. The Soviets themselves declined to compete, sending only observers, after a long hesitation that saw Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] demanding guarantees from his sports officials that the USSR would beat the US in the medal standings. The Soviet officials told him that chances were 50/50, and Stalin ultimately rejected the idea of competing in 1948. With its newest political rival absent, the United States comfortably dominated the games, winning 38 gold and 84 total medals, 22 gold and 40 total medals more than the runner-up [[Sweden at the 1948 Summer Olympics|Sweden]]. The most medals were won in track and field, 27, and swimming, 15. The [[1948 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its second consecutive gold medal, defeating [[France men's national basketball team|France]] in the final, 65\u201321.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1948/</ref>\n\n[[File:USA-USSR.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Gold medal game in basketball at the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympics]] between the [[United States men's national basketball team|US]] and the [[Soviet Union men's national basketball team|USSR]]. The Americans won, 36-25.]]\nIn [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]], [[Helsinki]] saw the Soviets sending a team for the first time. This was a beginning of a new era, as the Soviet Union would go on to dominate the Olympics for the next four decades. The Soviets viewed the Olympics as international battlefield, where they can achieve their political goals by winning medals, thus proving their system\u2019s superiority.<ref>http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/</ref><ref>www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf</ref> The Soviet authorities also significantly bent the amateur rules, that were in place at the time, by providing state-funding to their athletes who trained full-time and, unlike American self-financed amateurs, were ''[[de facto]]'' professionals. That would start a significant controversy, that will result in the amateur rules being abolished, though only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], meaning that the Soviets benefited from those rules throughout their Olympic history.<ref>http://www.processhistory.org/redihan-1952-olympics/</ref> The United States still topped the medal count at these games, winning 40 gold and 76 total medals, 22 gold and 5 total medals more than the [[Soviet Union at the 1952 Summer Olympics|Soviets]] who finished second. American athletes won 31 medals in track and field, their most successful sport. [[1952 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its third consecutive gold, twice defeating the Soviets in the process, American boxers won all five finals they entered, and American weightlifters edged their Soviet rivals 4 to 3 in terms of gold medals, with the two nations sweeping all seven events in the sport.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1952/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bobby Morrow with wife 1956.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Bobby Morrow]] won gold in 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay (track and field) at the [[Athletics at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Olympics]] in [[Melbourne]].]]\n[[Melbourne]] hosted the Olympics in [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]]. There were calls for the expulsion of the Soviet Union following their [[Soviet invasion of Hungary|invasion of Hungary]], but the [[International Olympic Committee]] decided not to pursue any action. As a result, some nations boycotted the games in protest of the Soviets' presence, and the Hungarians themselves became engaged in a violent brawl with their Soviet counterparts in a water polo game, an event that was instantly called [[Blood in the Water match|Blood in the Water]]. The US performance at the games was relatively successful, though it was getting harder and harder to compete with the Soviet machine. As a result, the Americans earned 32 gold and 78 total medals (second place in the medal standings), 5 gold and 24 total medals less than the first-placed Soviets. The US contingent was particularly successful in track and field, where American athletes amassed 31 medals. On the other hand, the US won only 2 golds in swimming, being unable to stop the Australian domination of the swimming events at these games. In weightlifting, the Americans and Soviets once again won all seven events, once again with a 4 to 3 ratio in favor of the US team. In boxing, the Soviets won 3 golds, while the Americans only managed to win two events. However, it was gymnastics where the USSR achieved its greatest success, winning 11 out of 17 events and guaranteeing the first place in the medal rankings. The [[1956 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its fourth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final game, 89\u201355.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1956/</ref>\n\n[[File:Giuseppina leone.jpg|260px|left|thumb|[[Wilma Rudolph]] became the first woman in history to sweep 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay at the [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Games]].]]\nThe [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Olympics]] saw the Americans losing their grip on their traditionally successful sports, such as track and field and weightlifting. On the other hand, boxing, swimming (where the Americans won 9 gold medals, while being controversially denied gold in the [[Swimming at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre freestyle|100 meters freestyle]], despite showing the best time), and wrestling produced unexpectedly good results, which somewhat helped to compensate for what was lost in other sports. In track and field, the Soviets won 11 golds, only one less that the Americans. It is worth mentioning that the US team encountered many problems throughout the meet, such as a controversial disqualification of their gold medal winning [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay|men's 4x100 relay team]]. In weightlifting, the Soviets, with the help of their state-of-the-art doping program, won five out of seven events, leaving the US with only one gold. 10 Soviet golds in gymnastics didn't surprise anyone, as the nation had always been a gymnastics powerhouse, but it did mean that the Soviets beat the Americans in the medal standings for the second straight summer games. The [[1960 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]], however, met the pre-tournament expectations and won its fifth consecutive gold medal, a noble feat, given that they had to compete against veteran pros from the USSR. The final result, 43 gold and 103 total medals for the Soviets to 34 gold and 71 total medals for the Americans, showed that America was no longer a leading force in Olympic competition.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1960/</ref>\n\n[[File:Don Schollander 1964.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Don Schollander]] won 4 golds in swimming at the [[Swimming at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964 games]] in [[Tokyo]], the largest individual medal haul in a single Olympics since [[Jesse Owens]] in 1936.]]\nThere was some redemption for the US at the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], as the nation returned to the top of the [[1964 Summer Olympics medal table|gold medal count]] for the first time since 1952. Particularly successful was the US swimming team that won 13 out of available 18 golds and shattered 9 world records. In track and field, the Americans also improved on their 1960 performance, winning 14 gold and 24 total medals, while the Soviets left Japan with 5 gold and 18 total medals, a significant downturn compared to their 1960 results. The Soviets, however, continued to dominate Olympic weightlifting, and, with the American program falling apart, the USSR produced four golds and three silvers. The Soviet Union hoped to replicate that success in gymnastics and wrestling, the sports that, together with weightlifting, were strongly associated with their athletic prowess. However, they encountered a zealous resistance from the Japanese, who used their [[home advantage|home-field advantage]] to stun the Soviets, beating them five to three in wrestling golds, and winning five gymnastics championships to their four. Thus, Japan had a major influence on the US\u2013USSR medals race, and most certainly helped the Americans edge their biggest rivals, while also managing to produce its best ever medal output and finishing in third place. For the Americans, despite their dismal performance in boxing where they achieved only one gold, the 1964 Olympics were a definite success, with the nation winning 36 gold and 90 total medals compared to the Soviet tally of 30 gold and 96 total medals. Therefore, the US topped the gold medal count, finishing second in the total medal count, while the USSR topped the total medal count, finishing second in the gold medal count. The [[1964 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its sixth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final, 73\u201359.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1964/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bob Beamon 1968.jpg|200px|right|thumb|There were many historic achievements at the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City Olympics]] but, perhaps, the most significant among them was [[Bob Beamon]]'s performance in the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's long jump|long jump]], where he improved the world record by 55 cm.]]\nThe [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico Olympics]] became the most successful summer games for the US in the post-war era. American athletes amassed 45 gold and 107 total medals, 16 gold and 16 total medals more than the second-placed Soviets. The US swimming team dominated the competition, winning a staggering 51 medals and sweeping the podium on five occasions. The Americans also managed to medal in every single of 29 swimming events, thus achieving a unique feat. The US track and field team pulled off a stellar performance as well with 15 gold and 28 total medals. Overall, swimming and athletics accounted for more than 70% of all US medals, and ensured the first place in the medal table for the Americans, their second consecutive first-place finish in terms of gold medals, and their first finish at the top of the overall medal table since 1952. In other sports, however, the performance of American athletes was less convincing. The US weightlifting team continued to fade away, winning just one medal (compared to 7 in 1956), American boxers won 7 medals, though only two of them gold, US divers won 6 medals, and the men's volleyball team managed to stun the defending champions from the Soviet Union, beating them in five sets, but still finished out of medals; Soviets ultimately won gold, with their lone loss being to the US. In gymnastics, Japan continued to frustrate the Soviets, once again surpassing them in the medal standings. Last but not least, the [[1968 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its seventh consecutive gold medal, a feat not matched by any other Olympic team in ball sports. Very few would have assumed that this was the last time that the US finished first in the medal table in a fully attended Summer Olympics until 1996 (the Americans would top the medal standings in 1984 with the Soviet Union and its satellites boycotting).<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1968/</ref>\n\nThe [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich Olympics]] saw the Soviet Union begin its streak of topping the medal count at five consecutive summer games in which they participated (1972\u20131992, though in 1992 they would compete as the ''[[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]]'' as the USSR [[Fall of the Soviet Union|dissolved]] half a year prior to the games, and the newly independent countries decided to compete together). The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the [[Munich massacre]] in the second week, in which eleven [[Israel]]i [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|athletes and coaches]] and a West German police officer at Olympic village were killed by [[Black September Organization|Black September]] terrorists. There were multiple calls to cancel the games after the terrorist attack, but the IOC declined. From a sporting standpoint, these games were one of the most controversial in history, with many accusing the organizing committee of anti-Americanism and trying to appease the Soviet Union and East Germany. Indeed, these were one the strangest Olympics ever for American athletes. US world record holders in the [[Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|100 meters]] were given the wrong starting time and were unable to compete in the event, thus paving the way for a Soviet to win. In swimming, the US gold medal winner in the [[Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 400 metre freestyle|400 meters freestyle]] was stripped of his medal for using his prescription asthma medication, also depriving him of a chance at multiple medals. US boxers complained that they were judged unfairly in the bouts against their communist counterparts. In shooting, a US athlete initially won the [[Shooting at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle, prone|50 meters rifle]] only to be relegated to silver after a \"review\". Finally, in the most controversial event of the games, and one of the most controversial events of all time, the [[1972 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] was denied gold after apparently winning the final match against the Soviet Union. The final three seconds of the game were replayed three times until the Soviets came out on top. The Americans did not accept the silver medals, believing that they were robbed. This was the first US loss in Olympic basketball history and it ended the Americans' 63-game winning streak in Olympic basketball. In general, the US team greatly underperformed at these games, winning only 6 gold medals in track and field to the East Germans' 8 and Soviets' 9, though the Americans still won the most total medals, 22. In boxing, the Cubans and Soviets dominated, winning three and two championships, respectively, while the US won only one gold and four medals overall (compared to the Soviets' two and Cubans' five). In diving, the Americans won three medals; in soccer, the USSR and GDR fixed a bronze medal game, playing a tie, so both teams received bronze; in gymnastics, the Soviets edged their old rivals Japan to top the medal count; in weightlifting, the Soviets and Bulgarians won three golds each; in wrestling, the US team surprised with three golds in freestyle, yet the Soviets still dwarfed their medal tally with nine golds in freestyle and greco-roman (14\u20136 in total medals). In water polo, the Americans struck bronze, tying the eventual gold medalists the Soviet Union in the final round. Swimming was the only sport where the American team did not disappoint, winning 17 gold and 43 total medals, a good result, but still less than four years earlier. American women dominated swimming for the last time until 1992, as by 1976 they would be overtaken by East German [[Doping in East Germany|dopers]].<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1972/</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc utterly dominated the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Montreal Olympics]], with seven communist countries placing in the top ten of the medal table. The United States team was relegated to a third place in the medal standings for the first time in its history, courtesy of Soviet and East German doping systems and their use of professional athletes. This was the Olympics of contrasts: the US men's swimming team, despite a generally dismal showing of the delegation, completely obliterated their sport, sweeping 12 gold and 27 total medals in the 13 events that were on the program and shattering 11 world records in the process (this was arguably the most dominant performance of any swimming team in history),<ref>https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/2016/07/31/docs-boys-story-dominant-us-swim-team-1976/87614856/</ref> while the US women's swimming team, on the other hand, fell victim to the unbeatable East German dopers. They still managed to win a gold medal, in a shocking upset against East Germans in the [[Swimming at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4x100 freestyle relay]]. The event was held on the last day of the swimming program, and the American women were risking to get shut out of gold for the first time in the US Olympic history. The victory was somewhat overlooked at the time, but since the early 1990s, when the crimes of the Soviet Bloc started to unravel, their gold medal is often considered to be one of the most improbable and heroic upsets of all time.<ref>https://www.dailynews.com/2016/06/04/40-years-later-story-of-us-east-german-olympic-swimmers-can-be-told-best-in-the-last-gold/</ref> In track and field, both the US men's and women's team were overwhelmed by East Germans who, as their Soviet masters expected, stole away a bulk of medals from the US in its signature sports, thus allowing the Soviets to win the medal table virtually unchallenged. The US boxing team surprised everyone, advancing to six gold medal bouts and winning five of them, drawing parallels to a stellar 1952 team that also took 5 golds. The achievement was even more momentous due to the fact that the American boxers were significantly younger and less experienced than their Cuban and Soviet counterparts.<ref>https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/15293108/1976-us-olympic-boxing-team-celebrate-40-year-reunion-boxing-hall-fame-banquet-champions</ref> In other sports, US divers won 5 medals, including two golds; the US equestrian team took home 4 medals; American shooters won three medals, including a historic silver by a woman in the [[Shooting at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle three positions|mixed 50 meters rifle three positions]]; US freestyle wrestlers advanced to four gold medal bouts, yet won only one of them (all four were against the Soviets), concluding the meet with 6 medals overall. The [[1976 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US men's basketball team]] reclaimed the gold medal, while the [[United States women's national basketball team|women's team]] won a surprising silver, being ranked no higher than sixth prior to the start of the tournament. The Soviets and East Germans were unstoppable in canoeing, gymnastics, rowing, weightlifting and wrestling, going 1\u20132 in the medal standings (49 gold and 125 total medals for the Soviets, and 40 gold and 90 total medals for East Germans). The US won medals in 14 sports, finishing third with 34 gold and 94 total medals. The most successful day for the Americans was July 31st when they won 8 gold and 18 total medals.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1976/</ref>\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics]] marked another first for the United States, as the nation led by far the largest and most significant [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] in the Olympic history. The boycott was motivated by the [[1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], as well as by flagrant human rights violations in the USSR, and the regime's [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] policies.<ref>U. Tulli, \"Bringing Human Rights In: The Campaign Against the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games and the Origins of the Nexus Between Human Rights and the Olympic Games\", in The International Journal of the History of Sport, Vol.33, Issue 16 (2016-2017) https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09523367.2017.1315104</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/qfp/104481.htm|title=The Olympic Boycott, 1980|work=U.S. Department of State Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/sports/year_in_sports/01.20.html|title=The President Said Nyet|work=The New York Times|author=Smith, Terence|date=January 20, 1980}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0415/041531.html|title=How the Russians break the Olympic rules|publisher=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html?_r=0|title=The Soviet Doping Plan: Document Reveals Illicit Approach to '84 Olympics|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> The Soviet state-run media ridiculed the Americans as sore losers who couldn't get over the fact that they were no longer a perennial Olympic power, and simply didn't want to be embarrassed by the Soviets who would thrash them in the medal count. Indeed, all medal predictions pointed to an inevitable Soviet victory with 55\u201360 gold medals. East Germans were forecast to win 40\u201345 gold medals, while the Americans would wind up in third place with 30\u201335 golds. However, the world will never know what would have happened, as the United States and 65 other countries chose not to attend the Moscow Games, leaving them with the smallest attendance since 1956. Predictably, the great majority of the medals were taken by the [[Soviet Union at the 1980 Summer Olympics|host country]] and [[East Germany at the 1980 Summer Olympics|East Germany]] in what was the most skewed medal tally since [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]].<ref>Moscow 1980 Olympic Games. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online Library Edition: http://www.library.ebonline.com/eb/article-9098213</ref> The Soviets amassed 80 gold (all-time record) and 195 total (second-best result after the US in 1904) medals in their anticlimactic performance.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1980/</ref>\n\nIn [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], [[Los Angeles]] witnessed what was considered a retaliatory boycott by the Soviets and their satellites, although the Soviets cited security concerns and \"chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States.\" However, no threat to Eastern Bloc athletes was ever discovered, and the athletes from the Eastern Bloc country that did attend the 1984 games in Los Angeles&mdash;Romania&mdash;encountered no problems, and in fact were widely cheered above all other visiting nations at the Opening Ceremonies when they marched into the Coliseum (Romania ended up finishing third in overall medal count at the Games). The move by the Soviets left many \"dumbfounded\", as it was expected that they would try to thrash the US on their soil, thus achieving a significant propaganda victory. The forecasts again heavily favored the Soviet Union, with the Soviet athletes being expected to rack up 60\u201365 gold medals compared to 35\u201345 by the second-placed Americans. That didn't happen. Furthermore, despite the Soviet boycott, a record 140 nations (including China that participated for the first time since 1952) attended the games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|website=jimrome.com|title=Bryan Fogel talks 1984 Summer Olympics boycott on The Jim Rome Podcast|access-date=November 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122112500/http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|archive-date=November 22, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThere were fears that the Soviet Union would boycott the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]] as well because [[South Korea]] had no diplomatic relations with the USSR, which recognised and supported only [[North Korea]]. However, the policies of [[Perestroika]] that were initiated by [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] in 1985 led to the Soviet participation in the games. [[Cuba at the Summer Olympics|Cuba]], clearly not understanding such a betrayal, decided to boycott the Olympics on its own, impacting the boxing field as a result. The Soviet Union was steadily moving towards its ultimate [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|collapse]] but its sporting empire was still in its prime. The Soviets and their close allies from East Germany utterly dominated the games, winning 55 and 37 gold medals respectively (132 and 102 total medals). \n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] period The Americans did their best to challenge the Soviets, but the playing field wasn't level. The Soviet athletes were funded by the state and trained full-time, while the US strictly obeyed the amateur rules and its athletes were primarily self-financed students who were significantly younger and less experienced than the Soviet veterans. In addition to that, the Soviets developed a state-sponsored doping system, and supplied performance-enhancing drugs to the vast majority of their athletes.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html</ref> Furthermore, they heavily invested in the development of a similar system in their satellite nation, [[East Germany at the Olympics|East Germany]], with a specific goal of making East Germans highly competitive in swimming and track and field, so that they can reduce the number of medals the Americans win in their signature sports. Unfortunately for the US, the Soviet strategy worked, and the gap between the USSR and US widened every four years until the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1972, the Soviets won 50 gold and 99 total medals to the Americans' 33 and 94; in 1976, the USSR amassed 49 gold and 125 total medals to the Americans' 34 and 94; 1980 Olympics were boycotted by the US and its allies, the Soviets retaliated in 1984 by boycotting the LA Olympics together with their satellites; finally, in 1988, the USSR won 55 gold and 132 total medals to the Americans' 36 and 94 (the US finished third at those games, losing even to the East Germans). In 1992, the Soviets still fielded a team despite the dissolution of their state, yet the margin of their victory over the Americans became narrower: 45 gold and 112 total medals to the Americans' 37 and 108. By 1996, every former Soviet republic formed its own [[National Olympic Committee]], and the countries participated as independent nations, with Russia assuming the Soviet place in the IOC and inheriting Soviet achievements as by far the largest of the former Soviet republics. So, in 1996, the Americans finally managed to return to the top spot in the medal rankings, winning 44 gold and 101 total medals compared to 26 gold and 63 total medals won by the second-placed Russians, thanks to the partial abolition of the amateur rules in the early 1990s (the American athletes still weren't state-sponsored, unlike their foreign counterparts, but they were now eligible for prize money and sponsorships). They were still disadvantaged by these rules in those sports where they weren't abolished (i.e. boxing, baseball, where Cubans continued to field state-sponsored pros against American amateurs), but the situation started improving.\n\n===Modern period (1994\u2013present)===\n{{Expand section|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Amateurism and professionalism==\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic]] [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] in 1983 on compassionate grounds.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography |publisher=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017 |accessdate=9 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries eroded the ideology of the pure [[amateur sports#Olympics|amateur]], as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/|title=The Role of Sports in The Soviet Union - Guided History|website=blogs.bu.edu}}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cia.gov }}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\"/> The situation greatly disadvantaged American athletes, and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from [[Amateur sports|amateurism]], as envisioned by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], to allowing participation of [[professional athlete]]s, but only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and its influence within the [[International Olympic Committee]].\n\n==Russia\u2013United States rivalry==\n[[Russia]] (in all its incarnations) and the [[United States]] have won more Olympic medals than any other nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/262864/all-time-summer-olympics-medals-table/|title=All-time Summer Olympics medals table 1896-2016 &#124; Statistic|website=Statista}}</ref> Russia topped the [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|overall medal count]] at 7 Summer Olympics and 9 Winter Olympics, while the United States placed first at 17 Summer Olympics and 1 Winter Olympics.

The U.S. men's team was considered a favorite in the run-up to the 1972 Games. Since the first Olympic basketball tournament at the [[Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], the Americans haven't lost a single game, winning seven consecutive gold medals in a dominating fashion. Their record reached an unprecedented 63-0 before the final game. Since the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 tournament]] the Soviet team challenged the Americans, winning silver in 1952, [[Basketball at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956]], [[Basketball at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], [[Basketball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and bronze in [[Basketball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]. Outside of the Olympics, the Soviets had already defeated the U.S. team in the [[FIBA World Cup|World Championship]] play. However, the Americans never sent their best collegiate players to that tournament. \n\nIt is important to note that the Olympics strictly prohibited any involvement of professional athletes at the time. The Soviet Union and other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries used that rule to their advantage, listing all its top players as soldiers or workers what allowed them to breach the amateur rules. Western experts classified these athletes as professionals.<ref name=\"a1972\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/Classic_1972_usa_ussr_gold_medal_hoop.html|title=Classic 1972 USA vs. USSR Basketball game|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=August 6, 2004|accessdate=April 13, 2009}}</ref> On the other hand, leading American players were unable to play in the Olympics as they were officially professional and played in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. That disadvantage hadn't prevented the Americans from winning the first seven Olympic basketball tournaments without a single defeat.\n\nThe confrontation of the Soviet Union and United States on the [[basketball court]] was deeply connected to the confrontation on the political front. Many American viewers assumed that 1972 Games were openly [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]].<ref name=espn1>''By Frank Saraceno''.

[http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2002/JSH2903/jsh2903ag.pdf \u00ab03 Seconds From Gold\u00bb (2002).] \u00abJournal of Sports History\u00bb (vol 29, issue 3, page 518\u2014522) // la84foundation.org</ref>\n\nThe [[1972 United States men's Olympic basketball team|United States team]] was the youngest in history. American players usually participated in the Olympics once before turning pro, and the U.S. team always had new players every four years. The 1972 team didn't have a clear leader. A rising star [[Bill Walton]] declined an invitation to participate. Nevertheless, the team was heavily favored featuring such players as [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] or [[Tommy Burleson]] (the tallest player among all teams).\n\nThe young American team was confronted by a veteran Soviet team, featuring stars [[Sergei Belov]], [[Modestas Paulauskas]], and [[Alexander Belov]]. The players had played together for more than seven years. For [[Gennadi Volnov]] it was the fourth Olympic appearance.\n\nThe Soviets performed strongly at the beginning, winning the first half 26:21. The Soviets kept the Americans 4\u20138 points behind during the first half.\n\nIn the second half Soviets targeted [[Dwight Jones (basketball)|Dwight Jones]], as they considered him the leader of the U.S. team. On the 28th minute he was provoked by [[Mikheil Korkia]] and responded. Both players were sent off. The Soviets were satisfied, as they deemed Korkia less significant for them than Jones for the Americans. The next minute Alexander Belov hit [[Jim Brewer (basketball)|Jim Brewer]] during the free-throw, and Brewer was unable to continue playing. According to the Americans, the referees did not notice the foul.\n\nWith 10 minutes left, the Soviets increased their lead to 10 points. After that Americans finally started to press the Soviets. It helped them to cut the deficit to 1 point. Soviet players started to feel nervous. With less than a minute left, [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] stole a Soviet pass at halfcourt and was fouled hard by [[Zurab Sakandelidze]] as he drove toward the basket, being knocked down into the basket stanchion. With three seconds remaining on the game clock, Collins was awarded two free throws and sank the first to tie the score at 49. Just as Collins lifted the ball to begin his shooting motion in attempting the second free throw, the horn from the scorer's table sounded, marking the beginning of a chain of events that left the game's final three seconds mired in controversy. Although the unexpected sound of the horn caused lead referee [[Renato Righetto]] to turn away from the free throw attempt and look over to the scorer's table, play was not stopped. Collins never broke his shooting motion and continued with his second free throw, scoring to put the U.S. ahead by a score of 50:49. Immediately following Collins' free throws, the Soviets inbounded the ball and failed to score. Soviet coaches claimed that they had requested a timeout before Collins' foul shots. The referees ordered the clock reset to three seconds and the game's final seconds replayed. The horn sounded as a length-of-the-court Soviet pass was being released from the inbounding player, the pass missed its mark, and the American players began celebrating. Nevertheless, final three seconds were replayed for a third time. This time, the Soviets' [[Alexander Belov]] and the USA's [[Kevin Joyce (basketball)|Kevin Joyce]] and [[James Forbes (basketball)|Jim Forbes]] went up for the pass, and Belov caught the long pass from Ivan Edeshko near the American basket. Belov then laid the ball in for the winning points as the buzzer sounded.\n\nThe Americans regained the basketball crown in [[Basketball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], but their ability to stay competitive with college players against seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union was decreasing. In [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]], the Soviets beat the United States once again, eliminating them in the semifinals. That game was a turning point in international basketball, as [[FIBA]] officials started to realize that amateur rules were extremely unfair. In 1989, NBA players were finally allowed in the Olympics.\n\n===Ice hockey===\n{{see also|Miracle on Ice}}\n[[File:TeamUSA1980 stamp.png|thumb|upright|alt=Beige postage stamp featuring a brightly colored hockey player|Paraguayan stamp featuring U.S. vs USSR matchup.]]\nThe 1980 hockey game between the U.S. and USSR was dubbed the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\", when American college players defeated the heavily favored seasoned professionals from the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]] on the way to a gold medal at the [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the \"Miracle\" is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements. The U.S. also won the gold medal in the [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Games]] at [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], [[California]], defeating the Soviet Union, [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] along the way. However, since this victory is not as well known as the 1980 win, it has come to be known as the \"Forgotten Miracle\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Burnside|first=Scott|title=Hockey's miracle before the 'Miracle'|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/icehockey/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&id=4897805|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=February 8, 2010|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Morning Skate: The Forgotten Miracle of 1960|url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/the-morning-skate-the-forgotten-miracle-of-1960/|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 11, 2009|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Olympics in [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]]. As in 1980, the Soviets were represented by their star-studded veterans, while the Americans fielded a team of college players. The Soviets won the encounter 7\u20135 and went on to win the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh.\n\nThe two teams met again at the [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Olympics]] in a semi-final match. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5\u20132. While some stars had left the Soviet Union to play in the NHL, the Unified Team still boasted many veterans from their domestic professional league, while the Americans were represented primarily by college players. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia (the successor to the Unified Team) met twice at the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]]. The Americans won both games 5-2 en route to the tournament championship.\n\nThe U.S., coached by Herb Brooks, and Russia, coached by [[Viacheslav Fetisov|Slava Fetisov]], met twice in the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, which included a 2\u20132 round-robin draw and a 3\u20132 semi-final win for the Americans. The semi-final match was played 22 years to the day after the \"Miracle on Ice\" game.<ref name=\"sportsillustrated.cnn.com\"/> The U.S. eventually won silver, while Russia won bronze.\n\nThe two teams met in the quarterfinals of the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]], with the U.S. earning a decisive 5-3 victory.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia played each other in a round-robin game at the [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympics]] in Sochi. The game was tied 2\u20132 after overtime before the Americans prevailed in an eight-round shootout, with [[T.J. Oshie]] scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the United States. The match has been dubbed by some as the \"Marathon on Ice\" due to its length.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teamusa.org:443/Road-to-Sochi-2014/Features/2014/February/15/Team-USA-Beats-Russia-In-Marathon-On-Ice|title=Team USA Beats Russia In 'Marathon On Ice'|website=Team USA}}</ref> Both teams, however, failed to medal; the Americans finished fourth (losing in the semis to Canada and to Finland in the bronze medal game), while the Russians placed fifth (losing to Finland in the quarterfinals).\n\n==See also==\n*[[United States at the Summer Olympics]]\n*[[United States at the Winter Olympics]]\n*[[List of United States Olympic medalists]]\n*[[United States at the Paralympics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |title=United States of America |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/united-states-of-america }}\n* {{IOC medals|NOC=USA}}\n* {{cite web |title=Olympic Medal Winners |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/athletes?search=1&countryname=united%20states%20of%20america }}\n* {{cite web |title=United States |publisher=Sports-Reference.com |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA }}\n\n{{country at games navbox|United States|Olympics}}\n{{Nations at the Olympics}}\n{{National sports teams of the United States}}\n{{Sport in the United States}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:United States At The Olympics}}\n[[Category:United States at the Olympics| ]]\n[[Category:National sports teams of the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Spdslecturer", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_at_the_Olympics"}

It has only recently been described in any detail.\n\n==Rediscovery==\nFor decades the Kusunda language was thought to be on the verge of extinction, with little hope of ever knowing it well. The little material that could be gleaned from the memories of former speakers suggested that the language was an isolate, but without much evidence either way it was often classified along with its neighbors as [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]. However, in 2004 three [[Kusunda people|Kusunda]]s, Gyani Maya Sen, Prem Bahadur Shahi and Kamala Singh,<ref name=3Kusundas>{{cite web |url=http://listserv.emich.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0410&L=endangered-languages-l&P=439 |title=Kusunda language does not fall in any family: Study |accessdate=2007-09-12 |last=Rana |first=B.K. |date=2004-10-12 |work=email with pasted news article |publisher=Himalayan News Service, Lalitpur, 2004-10-10 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> were brought to [[Kathmandu]] for help with citizenship papers. There, members of [[Tribhuvan University]] discovered that one of them, a native of Sakhi VDC in southern [[Rolpa District]], was a fluent speaker of the language. Several of her relatives were also discovered to be fluent. There are now known to be at least seven or eight fluent speakers of the language, the youngest in her thirties.<ref name=\"Watters2006\"/> However, the language is [[moribund language|moribund]], with no children learning it, as all Kusunda speakers have married outside their ethnicity.<ref name=\"Watters2006\">Watters, David E. 2005.

Watters|Watters]] (2005) published a mid-sized grammatical description of the language, plus vocabulary, which shows that Kusunda is indeed a language isolate, not just genealogically but also lexically, grammatically, and phonologically distinct from its neighbors. It appears that Kusunda is a remnant of the languages spoken in northern India before the influx of Tibeto-Burman- and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]-speaking peoples, however it is not classified as a [[Munda languages|Munda]] or a [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] language. It thus joins [[Burushaski]], [[Nihali]] and (potentially) the substrate of the [[Vedda language]] in the list of South Asian languages which do not fall into the main categories of Indo-European, Dravidian, [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] and [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]].\n\nBefore the recent discovery of active Kusunda speakers, there were several attempts to link the language to an established language family. B. K. Rana (2002) maintained that Kusunda is a [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman language]] as traditionally classified. Others have linked it to [[Munda languages|Munda]] (see [[David E. Watters|Watters]] 2005); [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]] (Gurov 1989); [[Burushaski language|Burushaski]] and [[Caucasian languages|Caucasian]] (Reinhard and Toba 1970; this would be a variant of Gurov's proposal if [[Sino-Caucasian]] is accepted); the [[Nihali language|Nihali]] isolate in central India (Fleming 1996, Whitehouse 1997); and again with Nihali, as part of the [[Indo-Pacific languages|Indo-Pacific]] hypothesis (Whitehouse et al. 2004<ref>{{Cite journal\n| title = Kusunda: An Indo-Pacific language in Nepal\n| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\n| date = 2004-04-13\n| volume = 101\n| pages = 5692\u20135695                                     \n| url = http://www.pnas.org/content/101/15/5692.full\n|author1=Paul Whitehouse |author2=Timothy Usher | author3-link = Merritt Ruhlen\n|author3=Merritt Ruhlen |author4=William S.-Y.

The little material that could be gleaned from the memories of former speakers suggested that the language was an isolate, but without much evidence either way it was often classified along with its neighbors as [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]].

There, members of [[Tribhuvan University]] discovered that one of them, a native of Sakhi VDC in southern [[Rolpa District]], was a fluent speaker of the language. Several of her relatives were also discovered to be fluent. There are now known to be at least seven or eight fluent speakers of the language, the youngest in her thirties.<ref name=\"Watters2006\"/> However, the language is [[moribund language|moribund]], with no children learning it, as all Kusunda speakers have married outside their ethnicity.<ref name=\"Watters2006\">Watters, David E. 2005.

Watters|Watters]] (2005) published a mid-sized grammatical description of the language, plus vocabulary, which shows that Kusunda is indeed a language isolate, not just genealogically but also lexically, grammatically, and phonologically distinct from its neighbors. It appears that Kusunda is a remnant of the languages spoken in northern India before the influx of Tibeto-Burman- and [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]]-speaking peoples, however it is not classified as a [[Munda languages|Munda]] or a [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] language. It thus joins [[Burushaski]], [[Nihali]] and (potentially) the substrate of the [[Vedda language]] in the list of South Asian languages which do not fall into the main categories of Indo-European, Dravidian, [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] and [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]].\n\nBefore the recent discovery of active Kusunda speakers, there were several attempts to link the language to an established language family. B. K. Rana (2002) maintained that Kusunda is a [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman language]] as traditionally classified. Others have linked it to [[Munda languages|Munda]] (see [[David E. Watters|Watters]] 2005); [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]] (Gurov 1989); [[Burushaski language|Burushaski]] and [[Caucasian languages|Caucasian]] (Reinhard and Toba 1970; this would be a variant of Gurov's proposal if [[Sino-Caucasian]] is accepted); the [[Nihali language|Nihali]] isolate in central India (Fleming 1996, Whitehouse 1997); and again with Nihali, as part of the [[Indo-Pacific languages|Indo-Pacific]] hypothesis (Whitehouse et al. 2004<ref>{{Cite journal\n| title = Kusunda: An Indo-Pacific language in Nepal\n| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America\n| date = 2004-04-13\n| volume = 101\n| pages = 5692\u20135695                                     \n| url = http://www.pnas.org/content/101/15/5692.full\n|author1=Paul Whitehouse |author2=Timothy Usher | author3-link = Merritt Ruhlen\n|author3=Merritt Ruhlen |author4=William S.-Y.

He is best known today for being the official who presided over the [[Pilate's court|trial]] of [[Jesus]] and ordered his [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]. Pilate's importance in modern Christianity is underscored by his prominent place in both the [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles]] and [[Nicene Creed]]s. Due to the Gospels' portrayal of Pilate as reluctant to execute Jesus, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Churches]] believe that Pilate became a Christian and venerate him as a [[martyr]] and [[saint]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2003|1p=11|2a1=Gr\u00fcll|2y=2010|2p=167}}\n\nAlthough Pilate is the best-attested governor of Judaea, few sources on his rule have survived. He appears to have belonged to the well-attested [[Pontia gens|Pontii]] family, but nothing is known for certain about his life before he became governor of Judaea, nor of the circumstances that led to his appointment to the governorship.{{sfnm|1a1=Schwartz|1y=1992|1p=398|2a1=L\u00e9monon|2y=2007|2p=121}} A single inscription from Pilate's governorship has survived, the so-called [[Pilate stone]], as have coins that he minted. The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] and philosopher [[Philo of Alexandria]] both mention incidents of tension and violence between the Jewish population and Pilate's administration. Many of these involve Pilate acting in ways that offended the religious sensibilities of the Jews. The Christian [[Gospels]] record that Pilate ordered the crucifixion of Jesus at some point during his time in office; Josephus and the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] also appear to have recorded this information. According to Josephus, Pilate's removal from office occurred because he violently suppressed an armed [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] movement at [[Mount Gerizim]]. He was sent back to Rome by the legate of [[Roman Syria|Syria]] to answer for this before Tiberius, who, however, had died before he arrived. Nothing is known for certain about what happened to him after this. On the basis of a mention in the second-century pagan philosopher [[Celsus]] and Christian apologist [[Origen]], most modern historians believe that Pilate simply retired after his dismissal.{{sfnm|1a1=Maier|1y=1971|1p=371|2a1=Demandt|2y=2012|2pp=92\u201393}} Modern historians have differing assessments of Pilate as an effective ruler; while some believe he was a particularly brutal and ineffective governor, others argue that his long time in office means he must have been reasonably competent. According to one prominent [[post-war]] theory, Pilate was motivated by [[antisemitism]] in his treatment of the Jews, but this theory has been mostly abandoned.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1p=22|2a1=Carter|2y=2003|3p=4}}\n\nIn [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]], Pilate became the focus of a large group of [[New Testament apocrypha]] expanding on his role in the Gospels. In many of these, particularly the earlier texts from the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], Pilate was portrayed as a positive figure. In some, he became a Christian [[martyr]]. In later, particularly Western Christian texts, he was instead portrayed as a negative figure and villain, with traditions surrounding his death by suicide featuring prominently. Pilate was also the focus of numerous medieval [[legend]]s, which invented a complete biography for him and portrayed him as villainous and cowardly. Many of these legends connected Pilate's place of birth or death to particular locations around [[Western Europe]].\n\nPilate has frequently been a subject of artistic representation. [[Medieval art]] frequently portrayed scenes of Pilate and Jesus, often in the scene where he washes his hands of guilt for Jesus's death. In the art of the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], Pilate is often depicted as a Jew. The nineteenth century saw a renewed interest in depicting Pilate, with numerous images made. He plays an important role in medieval [[passion plays]], where he is often a more prominent character than Jesus. His characterization in these plays varies greatly, from weak-willed and coerced into crucifying Jesus to being an evil person who demands Jesus's crucifixion. Modern authors who feature Pilate prominently in their works include [[Anatole France]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], and [[Chingiz Aitmatov]], with a majority of modern treatments of Pilate dating to after the [[Second World War]]. Pilate has also frequently been portrayed in film.\n\n==Life==\n===Sources===\nSources on Pontius Pilate are limited, although modern scholars know more about him than about other [[Roman administration of Judaea (AD 6\u2013135)|Roman governors of Judaea]].{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}} The most important sources are the ''Embassy to Gaius'' (after 41 CE) by contemporary Jewish writer [[Philo of Alexandria]],{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=34|ps=. \"Nach dem Tod des Caligula, unter Claudius, schrieb Philo seine 'Legatio'.\"}} the ''Jewish Wars'' (c. 74 CE) and ''Antiquities of the Jews'' (c. 94 CE) by the Jewish historian [[Josephus]], as well as the four canonical Christian [[Gospel]]s, [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] (composed between 66 and 70 CE), [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] (composed between 85 and 90 CE), [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] (composed between 85 and 90 CE), and [[Gospel of John|John]] (composed between 90 and 110 CE).{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}} [[Ignatius of Antioch]] mentions him in his epistles to the [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallians|Trallians]], [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians|Magnesians]], and [[Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyrnaeans|Smyrnaeans]]{{sfn|Bayes|2010|p=79}} (composed between 105 and 110 CE).{{sfn|Trebilco|2007|p=631}} He is also briefly mentioned in ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]]'' of the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] (early 2nd c. CE), who simply says that he put Jesus to death.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}} Two additional chapters of Tacitus's ''Annals'' that might have mentioned Pilate have been lost.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=xii}} Besides these texts, coins minted by Pilate have survived, as well as a fragmentary short inscription that names Pilate, known as the [[Pilate Stone]], the only inscription about a Roman governor of Judaea predating the [[Roman-Jewish Wars]] to survive.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=12\u201313}}{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=75}} The written sources provide only limited information and each has its own biases, with the gospels in particular providing a theological rather than historical perspective on Pilate.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=12\u201319}}\n\n===Early life===\nThe sources give no indication of Pilate's life prior to his becoming governor of Judaea.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=121}} His [[praenomen]] (first name) is unknown;{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=16}} his [[cognomen]] ''Pilatus'' might mean \"skilled with the javelin ({{Lang|la|[[pilum]]|italics=yes}}),\" but it could also refer to the {{Lang|la|[[Pileus (hat)|pileus]]|italics=yes}} or [[Phrygian cap]], possibly indicating that one of Pilate's ancestors was a [[freedman]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=47\u201348}} If it means \"skilled with the javelin,\" it is possible that Pilate won the cognomen for himself while serving in the [[Military of ancient Rome|Roman military]];{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=121}} it is also possible that his father acquired the cognomen through military skill.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=16}} In the Gospels of Mark and John, Pilate is only called by his cognomen, which Marie-Joseph Ollivier takes to mean that this was the name by which he was generally known in common speech.{{sfn|Ollivier|1896|p=252}} The name ''Pontius'' indicates that he belonged to the [[Pontia gens|Pontii family]],{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=16}} a well-known family of [[Samnites|Samnite]] origin which produced a number of important individuals in the late [[Roman Republic|Republic]] and [[Principate|early Empire]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=46\u201347}} Like all but one other governor of Judaea, Pilate was of the [[equites|equestrian order]], a middle rank of the Roman nobility.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=9}} As one of the attested Pontii, [[Pontius Aquila]], an assassin of [[Julius Caesar]], was a [[Tribune of the Plebs]], the family must have originally been of [[Plebs|Plebeian]] origin. They became ennobled as equestrians.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=46\u201347}}\n\nPilate was likely educated, somewhat wealthy, and well-connected politically and socially.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=15}} He was probably married, but the only extant reference to [[Pontius Pilate's wife|his wife]], in which she tells him after a disturbing dream not to interact with Jesus ({{bibleverse|Matthew|27:19|KJV}}), is generally dismissed as legendary.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1p=197|2a1=Demandt|2y=2012|2pp=76-77|3a1=L\u00e9monon|3y=2007|3p=167}} According to the ''[[Tres militiae|cursus honorum]]'' established by [[Augustus]] for office holders of equestrian rank, Pilate would have had a military command before becoming prefect of Judaea; [[Alexander Demandt]] speculates that this could have been with a legion stationed at the [[Rhine]] or [[Danube]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=48}} Although it is therefore likely Pilate served in the military, it is nevertheless not certain.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\n===Role as governor of Judaea===\n[[File:First century Iudaea province.gif|thumb|Map of the province of Judaea during Pilate's governorship in the first century CE.]]\nPilate was the fifth governor of the Roman province of Judaea, during the reign of the emperor [[Tiberius]]. The post of governor of Judaea was of relatively low prestige and nothing is known of how Pilate obtained the office.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=398}} Josephus states that Pilate governed for 10 years (''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' 18.4.2), and these are traditionally dated from 26 to 36/37 CE, making him one of the two longest-serving governors of the province.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=8}} As Tiberius had retired to the island of [[Capri]] in 26 CE, scholars such as E. Stauffer have argued that Pilate may have actually been appointed by the powerful [[Praetorian Prefect]] [[Sejanus]], who was executed for treason in 31 CE.{{sfn|Maier|1968|pp=8\u20139}} Other scholars have cast doubt on any link between Pilate and Sejanus.{{sfnm|1a1=McGing|1y=1991|1p=427|2a1=Carter|2y=2003|2p=4|3a1=Schwartz|3y=1992|3p=398}} [[Daniel R. Schwartz]] and Kenneth L\u00f6nnqvist both argue that the traditional dating of the beginning of Pilate's governorship is based on an error in Josephus; Schwartz argues that he was appointed instead in 19 CE, while L\u00f6nnqvist argues for 17/18 CE.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|pp=396\u2013397}}{{sfn|L\u00f6nnqvist|2000|p=67}} This redating has not been widely accepted by other scholars.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=122}}\n\nPilate's title of prefect{{efn|Pilate's title as governor, as attested on the Pilate stone, is \"[[Prefect#Ancient Rome|prefect]] of Judaea\" ({{Lang|la|praefectus Iudaeae|italics=yes}}). His title is given as {{Lang|la|[[Procurator (Ancient Rome)|procurator]]|italics=yes}} in Tacitus, and with the Greek equivalent {{Transl|grc|epitropos|italics=yes}} ({{Lang|grc|\u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2|italics=no}}) in Josephus and Philo.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=397}} The title prefect was later changed to \"procurator\" under the emperor [[Claudius]], explaining why later sources give Pilate this title.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=11\u201312}} The [[New Testament]] uses the generic Greek term {{Transl|grc|[[Hegemony|hegemon]]|italics=yes}} ({{Lang|grc|\u1f21\u03b3\u03b5\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd|italics=no}}), a term also applied to Pilate in Josephus.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=397}}}} implies that his duties were primarily military;{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=11}} however, Pilate's troops were meant more as a police than a military force, and Pilate's duties extended beyond military matters.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=197}} As Roman governor, he was head of the judicial system. He had the power to inflict [[capital punishment]], and was responsible for collecting tributes and taxes, and for disbursing funds, including the minting of coins.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=197}} Because the Romans allowed a certain degree of local control, Pilate shared a limited amount of civil and religious power with the Jewish [[Sanhedrin]].{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=70}}\n\nPilate was subordinate to the legate of [[Roman Syria|Syria]]; however, for the first six years in which he held office, Syria lacked a legate, something which [[Helen Bond]] believes may have presented difficulties to Pilate.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=5, 14\u201315}} He seems to have been free to govern the province as he wished, with intervention by the legate of Syria only coming at the end of his tenure.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=398}} Like other Roman governors of Judaea, Pilate made his primary residence in [[Caesarea]], going to [[Jerusalem]] mainly for major feasts in order to maintain order.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=7\u20138}} He also would have toured around the province in order to hear cases and administer justice.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=46}}\n\nAs governor, Pilate had the right to appoint the Jewish [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] and also officially controlled the vestiments of the High Priest in the [[Antonia Fortress]].{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|pp=86\u201388}} Unlike his predecessor, [[Valerius Gratus]], Pilate retained the same high priest, [[Caiaphas]], for his entire tenure. Caiaphas would be removed following Pilate's own removal from the governorship.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=19}} This indicates that Caiaphas and the priests of the [[Sadducees|Sadducee sect]] were reliable allies to Pilate.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=48}} Moreover, Maier argues that Pilate could not have used the [[temple treasury]] to construct an aqueduct, as recorded by Josephus, without the cooperation of the priests.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=364}} Similarly, Helen Bond argues that Pilate is depicted working closely with the Jewish authorities in the execution of Jesus.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=89}} Jean-Pierre L\u00e9monon argues that official cooperation with Pilate was limited to the Sadducees, noting that the [[Pharisees]] are absent from the gospel accounts of Jesus's arrest and trial.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=172}}\n\nDaniel Schwartz takes the note in the [[Gospel of Luke]] ([[Luke 23]]:12) that Pilate had a difficult relationship with the Galilean Jewish king [[Herod Antipas]] as potentially historical. He also finds historical the information that their relationship mended following the execution of Jesus.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=400}} Based on [[John 19]]:12, it is possible that Pilate held the title \"friend of Caesar\" ({{Lang-la|amicus Caesaris|italics=yes}}, {{Lang-grc|\u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 K\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2|italics=no}}), a title also held by the Jewish kings [[Herod Agrippa I]] and [[Herod Agrippa II]] and by close advisors to the emperor.

In some cases, it is unclear if they may be referring to the same event,{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=399}} and it is difficult to establish a chronology of events for Pilate's rule.{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=78}} Joan Taylor argues that Pilate had a policy of promoting the [[imperial cult of ancient Rome|imperial cult]], which may have caused some of the friction with his Jewish subjects.{{sfn|Taylor|2006}} Schwartz suggests that Pilate's entire tenure was characterized by \"continued underlying tension between governor and governed, now and again breaking out in brief incidents.\"{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=399}}\n\nAccording to Josephus in his ''[[The Jewish War]]'' (2.9.2) and ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (18.3.1), Pilate offended the Jews by moving imperial standards with the image of Caesar into Jerusalem. This resulted in a crowd of Jews surrounding Pilate's house in Caesarea for five days. Pilate then summoned them to an [[arena]], where the Roman soldiers drew their swords. But the Jews showed so little fear of death, that Pilate relented and removed the standards.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=52\u201353}} Bond argues that the fact that Josephus says that Pilate brought in the standards by night, shows that he knew that the images of the emperor would be offensive.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=57}} She dates this incident to early in Pilate's tenure as governor.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=79}} Daniel Schwartz and Alexander Demandt both suggest that this incident is in fact identical with \"the incident with the shields\" reported in Philo's ''Embassy to Gaius'', an identification first made by the early church historian [[Eusebius]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=53\u201355}}{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=399}} L\u00e9monon, however, argues against this identification.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=206}}\n\nAccording to Philo's ''Embassy to Gaius'' (''Embassy to Gaius'' 38), Pilate offended against [[Halakha|Jewish law]] by bringing golden shields into Jerusalem, and placing them on [[Herod's Palace (Jerusalem)|Herod's Palace]]. The sons of [[Herod the Great]] petitioned him to remove the shields, but Pilate refused. Herod's sons then threatened to petition the emperor, an action which Pilate feared that would expose the crimes he had committed in office. He did not prevent their petition. Tiberius received the petition and angrily reprimanded Pilate, ordering him to remove the shields.{{sfn|Yonge|1855|pp=165\u2013166}} Helen Bond, Daniel Schwartz, and [[Warren Carter]] argue that Philo's portrayal is largely stereotyped and rhetorical, portraying Pilate with the same words as other opponents of Jewish law, while portraying Tiberius as just and supportive of Jewish law.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1pp=36\u201337|2a1=Carter|2y=2003|2pp=15\u201316|3a1=Schwartz|3y=1992|3p=399}} It is unclear why the shields offended against Jewish law: it is likely that they contained an inscription referring to Tiberius as {{lang|la|divi Augusti filius|italics=yes}} (son of divine Augustus).{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=39}}{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=51\u201352}} Bond dates the incident to 31 CE, sometime after Sejanus's death in October 17.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=46}}\n\nIn another incident recorded in both the ''Jewish Wars'' (2.9.4) and the ''Antiquities of the Jews'' (18.3.2), Josephus relates that Pilate offended the Jews by using up the [[temple treasury]] ({{lang|grc|korbanos|italics=yes}}) to pay for a new aqueduct to Jerusalem. When a mob formed while Pilate was visiting Jerusalem, Pilate ordered his troops to beat them with clubs; many perished from the blows or from being trampled by horses, and the mob was dispersed.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=53}} The dating of the incident is unknown, but Bond argues that it must have occurred between 26 and 30 or 33 CE, based on Josephus's chronology.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=89}}\n\nThe Gospel of Luke mentions in passing Galileans \"whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices\" ([[Luke 13]]:1). This reference has been variously interpreted as referring to one of the incidents recorded by Josephus, or to an entirely unknown incident.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=194\u2013195}} Bond argues that the number of Galileans killed does not seem to have been particularly high. In Bond's view, the reference to \"sacrifices\" likely means that this incident occurred at [[Passover]] at some unknown date.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=195\u2013196}} She argues that \"[i]t is not only possible but quite likely that Pilate's governorship contained many such brief outbreaks of trouble about which we know nothing. The insurrection in which [[Barabbas]] was caught up, if historical, may well be another example.\"{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=196}}\n\n===Trial and execution of Jesus===\n{{see also|Pilate's Court|Crucifixion of Jesus}}\n{{Gospel Jesus}}\nAt the [[Passover]] of most likely 30 or 33 CE, Pontius Pilate condemned [[Jesus]] of Nazareth to death by [[crucifixion]] in Jerusalem.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=201}} The main sources on the crucifixion are the four canonical Christian [[Gospel]]s, the accounts of which vary.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=22\u201323}} Helen Bond argues that\n<blockquote>the evangelists' portrayals of Pilate have been shaped to a great extent by their own particular theological and apologetic concerns. [...] Legendary or theological additions have also been made to the narrative [...] Despite extensive differences, however, there is a certain agreement amongst the evangelists regarding the basic facts, an agreement which may well go beyond literary dependency and reflect actual historical events.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=196\u2013167}}</blockquote>\nPilate's role in condemning Jesus to death is also attested by the Roman historian [[Tacitus on Christ|Tacitus]], who, when explaining [[Nero]]'s persecution of the Christians, explains: \"Christus, the founder of the name, had undergone the death penalty in the reign of Tiberius, by sentence of the procurator Pontius Pilate, and the pernicious [[superstition]] was checked for a moment...\" (Tacitus, ''Annals'' 15.44).{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}}{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=xi}} The authenticity of this passage has been disputed, and it is possible that Tacitus received this information from Christian informants.{{sfn|Ash|2018|p=194}} Josephus appears also [[Josephus on Jesus|to have mentioned Jesus]]'s execution by Pilate at the request of prominent Jews (''Antiquities of the Jews'' 18.3.3). However, the original text has been greatly altered by later [[Christian interpolation]], so that it is impossible to know what Josephus may have originally said.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=67, 71}} Discussing the paucity of extra-biblical mentions of the crucifixion, Alexander Demandt argues that the execution of Jesus was probably not seen as a particularly important event by the Romans, as many other people were crucified at the time and forgotten.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nBond argues that Jesus's arrest was made with Pilate's prior knowledge and involvement, based on the presence of a 500-strong Roman cohort among the party that arrests Jesus in John 18.3.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=197}} Demandt dismisses the notion that Pilate was involved.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=70-71}} It is generally assumed, based on the unanimous testimony of the gospels, that the crime for which Jesus was brought to Pilate and executed was sedition, founded on his claim to be [[Kings of Israel and Judah|king of the Jews]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1pp=197\u2013198|2a1=L\u00e9monon|2y=2007|2p=172|3a1=Demandt|3y=2012|3p=74}} Pilate may have judged Jesus according to the ''[[Roman litigation#Cognitio|cognitio]]'' {{lang|la|extra ordinem|italics=yes}}, a form of trial for [[capital punishment]] used in the Roman provinces and applied to [[Roman citizenship|non-Roman citizens]] that provided the prefect with greater flexibility in handling the case.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=198}}{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|pp=172\u2013173}} All four gospels also mention that Pilate had the custom of releasing one captive in honor of the [[Passover]] festival; this custom is not attested in any other source. Historians disagree on whether or not such a custom is a fictional element of the gospels, reflects historical reality, or perhaps represents a single [[amnesty]] in the year of Jesus's crucifixion.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1pp=199|2a1=L\u00e9monon|2y=2007|2pp=173\u2013176|3a1=Demandt|3y=2012|3pp=75\u201376}}\n\n[[File:Munkacsy - Christ in front of Pilate.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ before Pilate'', [[Mih\u00e1ly Munk\u00e1csy]], 1881]]\nThe Gospels' portrayal of Pilate is \"widely assumed\" to diverge greatly from that found in Josephus and Philo,{{sfn|McGing|1991|p=417}} as Pilate is portrayed as reluctant to execute Jesus and pressured to do so by the crowd and Jewish authorities. John P. Meier notes that in Josephus, by contrast, \"Pilate alone [...] is said to condemn Jesus to the cross.\"{{sfn|Meier|1990|p=95}} Some scholars believe that the Gospel accounts are completely untrustworthy: S. G. F. Brandon argued that in reality, rather than vacilating on condemning Jesus, Pilate unhesitatingly executed him as a rebel.{{sfn|McGing|1991|pp=417\u2013418}} Paul Winter explained the discrepancy between Pilate in other sources and Pilate in the gospels by arguing that Christians became more and more eager to portray Pontius Pilate as a witness to Jesus' innocence, as persecution of Christians by the Roman authorities increased.{{sfn|Winter|1974|pp=85\u201386}} [[Bart Ehrman]] argues that the earliest Gospel, Mark, shows the Jews and Pilate to be in agreement about executing Jesus (Mark 15:15), while the later gospels progressively reduce Pilate's culpability, culminating in Pilate allowing the Jews to crucify Jesus in John (John 18:16). He connects this change to increased \"anti-Judaism.\"{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|pp=20-21}} Others have tried to explain Pilate's behavior in the Gospels as motivated by a change of circumstances from that shown in Josephus and Philo, usually presupposing a connection between Pilate's caution and the death of Sejanus.{{sfn|McGing|1991|p=417}} Yet other scholars, such as Brian McGing and Bond, have argued that there is no real discrepancy between Pilate's behavior in Josephus and Philo and that in the Gospels.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=201}}{{sfn|McGing|1991|pp=435\u2013436}} Warren Carter argues that Pilate is portrayed as skillful, competent, and manipulative of the crowd in Mark, Matthew, and John, only finding Jesus innocent and executing him under pressure in Luke.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\n===Removal and later life===\nAccording to Josephus' ''Antiquities of the Jews'' (18.4.1-2), Pilate's removal as governor occurred after Pilate slaughtered a group of armed [[Samaritans]] at a village called Tirathana near [[Mount Gerizim]], where they hoped to find artifacts that had been buried there by [[Moses]]. Alexander Demandt suggests that the leader of this movement may have been [[Dositheos (Samaritan)|Dositheos]], a [[messiah]]-like figure among the Samaritans who was known to have been active around this time.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=63}} The Samaritans, claiming not to have been armed, complained to [[Lucius Vitellius the Elder]], the [[List of Roman governors of Syria|governor of Syria]] (term 35-39), who had Pilate recalled to Rome to be judged by Tiberius. Tiberius however, had died before his arrival.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=67}} This dates the end of Pilate's governorship to 36/37 CE. Tiberius died in [[Misenum]] on 16 March AD&nbsp;37, in his seventy-eighth year (Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#50|VI.50]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#51|VI.51]]).<ref>Karen Cokayne, Experiencing Old Age In Ancient Rome, p.100</ref>\n\nFollowing Tiberius's death, Pilate's hearing would have been handled by the new emperor [[Gaius Caligula]]: it is unclear whether any hearing took place, as new emperors often dismissed outstanding legal matters from previous reigns.{{sfn|Maier|1971|pp=366\u2013367}} The only sure outcome of Pilate's return to Rome is that he was not reinstated as governor of Judaea, either because the hearing went badly, or because Pilate did not wish to return.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=367}} J. P. L\u00e9monon argues that the fact that Pilate was not reinstated by Caligula does not mean that his trial went badly, but may simply have been because after ten years in the position it was time for him to take a new posting.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=92\u201393}} Joan Taylor, on the other hand, argues that Pilate seems to have ended his career in disgrace, using his unflattering portrayal in Philo, written only a few years after his dismissal, as proof.{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=577}}\n\n[[File:A remorseful Pilate prepares to kill himself. Engraving by G Wellcome V0034470.jpg|thumb|A remorseful Pilate prepares to kill himself. Engraving by G. Mochetti after B. Pinelli, early 19th century.]]\nThe church historian [[Eusebius]] ([[Church History (Eusebius)|''Church History'']] 2.6.7), writing in the early fourth century, claims that \"tradition relates that\" Pilate committed suicide after he was recalled to Rome due to the disgrace he was in.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=369}} Eusebius dates this to 39 CE.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=92}} Paul Maier notes that no other surviving records corroborate Pilate's suicide, which is meant to document God's wrath for Pilate's role in the crucifixion, and that Eusebius explicitly states that \"tradition\" is his source, \"indicating that he had trouble documenting Pilate's presumed suicide\".{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=369}} Daniel Schwartz, however, argues that Eusebius's claims \"should not lightly be dismissed.\"{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=400}} More information on the potential fate of Pontius Pilate can be gleaned from other sources. The second-century pagan philosopher [[Celsus]] polemically asked why, if Jesus was God, God had not punished Pilate, indicating that he did not believe that Pilate shamefully committed suicide. Responding to Celsus, the Christian apologist [[Origen]], writing c. 248 CE, argued that nothing bad happened to Pilate, because the Jews and not Pilate were responsible for Jesus' death; he therefore also assumed that Pilate did not die a shameful death.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=370}}{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=154\u2013155}} Pilate's supposed suicide is also left unmentioned in Josephus, Philo, or Tacitus.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=370}} Maier argues that \"[i]n all probability, then, the fate of Pontius Pilate lay clearly in the direction of a retired government official, a pensioned Roman ex-magistrate, than in anything more disastrous.\"{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=371}} Taylor notes that Philo discusses Pilate as though he were already dead in the ''Embassy to Gaius'', although he is writing only a few years after Pilate's tenure as governor.{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=578}}\n\n==Archaeology and minted coins==\n[[File:Pilate Inscription.JPG|thumb|The so-called [[Pilate Stone]].

Perhaps the earliest apocryphal texts attributed to Pilate are denunciations of Christianity and of Jesus that claim to be Pilate's report on the crucifixion. According to [[Eusebius]] ([[Church History (Eusebius)|''Church History'']] 9.2.5), these texts were distributed during the persecution of Christians conducted by the emperor [[Maximinus II]] (reigned 308\u2013313 CE).

\"Herod\" asks Pilate to pray for him.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nIn the so-called ''Book of the Cock'', a late-antique apocryphal passion Gospel only preserved in [[Ge'ez]] (Ethiopic) but translated from Arabic,{{sfn|Piovanelli|2003|pp=427-428}} Pilate attempts to avoid Jesus's execution by sending him to Herod and writing further letters arguing with Herod not to execute Jesus.

However, the body is surrounded by demons and storms, so that it is removed from the Tiber and instead cast into the Rhone, where the same thing happens.

The king reads in the stars that he will bear a son who will rule over many lands, so he has a miller's daughter named Pila brought to him whom he impregnates; Pilate's name thus results from the combination of the names ''Pila'' with ''Atus''. A few years later, Pilate is brought to his father's court where he kills his half-brother. As a result, he is sent as a hostage to Rome, where he kills another hostage. As punishment he is sent to the island of Pontius, whose inhabitants he subjugates, thus acquiring the name Pontius Pilate. King Herod hears of this accomplishment and asks him to come to Palestine to aid his rule there; Pilate comes but soon usurps Herod's power.{{sfn|Martin|1973|pp=101\u2013102}} The trial and judgment of Jesus then happens as in the gospels. The emperor in Rome is suffering from a terrible disease at this time, and hearing of Christ's healing powers, sends for him only to learn from [[Saint Veronica]] that Christ has been crucified, but she possesses a cloth with the image of his face. Pilate is taken as a prisoner with her to Rome to be judged, but every time the emperor sees Pilate to condemn him, his anger dissipates. This is revealed to be because Pilate is wearing Jesus's coat; when the coat is removed, the Emperor condemns him to death, but Pilate commits suicide first. The body is first thrown in the Tiber, but because it causes storms it is then moved to Vienne, and then thrown in a lake in the high Alps.{{sfn|Martin|1973|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nOne important version of the Pilate legend is found in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' by [[Jacobus de Voragine]] (1263\u20131273), one of the most popular books of the later Middle Ages.{{sfn|Martin|1973|p=109}} In the ''Golden Legend'', Pilate is portrayed as closely associated with [[Judas]], first coveting the fruit in the orchard of Judas's father Ruben, then granting Judas Ruben's property after Judas has killed his own father.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=234}}\n\nSeveral places in Western Europe have traditions associated with Pilate. The cities of [[Lyon]] and [[Vienne]] in modern France claim to be Pilate's birthplace: Vienne has a ''Maison de Pilate'', a ''Pr\u00e9toire de Pilate'' and a ''Tour de Pilate''.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=104}} One tradition states the Pilate was banished to Vienne where a Roman ruin is associated with his tomb; according to another, Pilate took refuge in a mountain (now called [[Mount Pilatus]]) in modern Switzerland, before eventually committing suicide in a lake on its summit.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=164}} This connection to Mount Pilatus is attested from 1273 onwards, while [[Lake Lucerne]] has been called \"Pilatus-See\" (Pilate Lake) beginning in the fourteenth century.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=104\u2013105}} A number of traditions also connected Pilate to Germany.

One famous nineteenth-century painting of Pilate is ''Christ before Pilate'' (1881) by Hungarian painter [[Mih\u00e1ly Munk\u00e1csy]]: the work brought Munk\u00e1csy great fame and celebrity in his lifetime, making his reputation and being popular in the United States in particular, where the painting was purchased.{{sfn|Morowitz|2009|pp=184\u2013186}} In 1896, Munk\u00e1csy painted a second painting featuring Christ and Pilate, ''Ecce homo'', which however was never exhibited in the United States; both paintings portray Jesus's fate as in the hands of the crowd rather than Pilate.{{sfn|Morowitz|2009|p=191}} The \"most famous of nineteenth-century pictures\"{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=182}} of Pilate is ''What is truth?'' ({{Lang|ru|\"\u0427\u0442\u043e \u0435\u0441\u0442\u044c \u0438\u0441\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0430?\"|italics=yes}}) by the Russian painter [[Nikolai Ge]], which was completed in 1890; the painting was banned from exhibition in Russia in part because the figure of Pilate was identified as representing the [[tsarist]] authorities.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=182\u2013185}} In 1893, Ge painted another another painting, ''Golgotha'', in which Pilate is represented only by his commanding hand, sentencing Jesus to death.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=185}} The [[Scala sancta]], supposedly the staircase from Pilate's praetorium, now located in Rome, is flanked by a life-sized sculpture of Christ and Pilate in the ''Ecce homo'' scene made in the nineteenth century by the Italian sculptor [[Ignazio Jacometti]].{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=392}}\n\nThe image of Pilate condemning Jesus to death is commonly encountered today as the first scene of the [[Stations of the Cross]], first found in [[Franciscan]] [[Catholic church]]es in the seventeenth century and found in almost all Catholic churches since the nineteenth century.{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=90}}{{sfn|MacAdam|2017|pp=138-139}}<ref>''The Catholic Encyclopedia'' (1907). s.v.

He is frequently depicted as a more important character to the narrative than even Jesus,{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=363}} and became one of the most important figures of medieval drama in the fifteenth century.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=296}} The three most popular scenes in the plays to include Pilate are his washing of hands, the warning of his wife Procula not to harm Jesus, and the writing of the ''titulus'' on Jesus' cross.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=297}} Pilate's characterization varies greatly from play to play, but later plays frequently portray Pilate somewhat ambiguously, though he is usually a negative character, and sometimes an evil villain.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=363\u2013364}} While in some plays Pilate is opposed to the Jews and condemns them, in others he describes himself as a Jew or supports their wish to kill Christ.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=364}}\n\nIn the passion plays from the continental Western Europe, Pilate's characterization varies from good to evil, but he is mostly a benign figure.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=365}} The earliest surviving passion play, the thirteenth-century {{lang|la|Ludus de Passione|italics=yes}} from [[Klosterneuburg]], portrays Pilate as a weak administrator who succumbs to the whims of the Jews in having Christ crucified.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=237}} Pilate goes on to play an important role in the increasingly long and elaborate passion plays performed in the German-speaking countries and in France.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=365\u2013366}} In [[Arnoul Gr\u00e9ban]]'s fifteenth-century ''Passion'', Pilate instructs the flagellators on how best to whip Jesus.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=283\u2013284}} The 1517 {{lang|de|Alsfelder Passionsspiel|italics=yes}} portrays Pilate as condemning Christ to death out of fear of losing Herod's friendship and to earn the Jews' good will, despite his long dialogues with the Jews in which he professes Christ's innocence. He eventually becomes a Christian himself.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=366\u2013367}} In the 1493 {{lang|de|Frankfurter Passionsspiel|italics=yes}}, on the other hand, Pilate himself accuses Christ.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=367\u2013368}} The fifteenth-century German Benediktbeuern passion play depicts Pilate as a good friend of Herod's, kissing him in a reminiscence of the kiss of Judas.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=252}} Colum Hourihane argues that all of these plays supported antisemitic tropes and were written at times when persecution of Jews on the continent were high.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=368\u2013369}}\n\nThe fifteenth-century Roman {{lang|it|Passione|italics=yes}} depicts Pilate as trying to save Jesus against the wishes of the Jews.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=364}} In the Italian passion plays, Pilate never identifies himself as a Jew, condemning them in the fifteenth-century {{lang|it|Resurrezione|italics=yes}} and stressing the Jews' fear of the \"new law\" of Christ.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=364\u2013365}}\n\nHourihane argues that in England, where the Jews had been expelled in 1290, Pilate's characterization may have been used primarily to satyrize corrupt officials and judges rather than to stoke antisemitism.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=265}} In several English plays, Pilate is portrayed speaking French or Latin, the languages of the ruling classes and the law.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=177\u2013178}} In the Wakefield plays, Pilate is portrayed as wickedly evil, describing himself as Satan's agent ({{lang|la|mali actoris|italics=yes}}) while plotting Christ's torture so as to extract the most pain. He nonetheless washes his hands of guilt after the tortures have been administered.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=286}} Yet many scholars believe the motif of the conniving devil and the Jews to be inextricably linked. By the thirteenth century, medieval arts and literature had a well-established tradition of the Jew as the Devil in disguise. <ref name=\":0\" /> Thus, some scholars believe that Anti-Judaism still lies near the heart of the matter.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the fifteenth-century English Townley Cycle, Pilate is portrayed as a pompous lord and prince of the Jews, but also as forcing Christ's torturer to give him Christ's clothes at the foot of the cross.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=243}} It is he alone who wishes to kill Christ rather than the high priests, conspiring together with Judas.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=297, 328}} In the fifteenth-century English York passion play, Pilate judges Jesus together with [[Annas]] and [[Caiaphas]], becoming a central character of the passion narrative who converses with and instructs other characters.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=243\u2013245}} In this play, when Judas comes back to Pilate and the priests to tell them he no longer wishes to betray Jesus, Pilate browbeats Judas into going through with the plan.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=213\u2013214}} Not only does Pilate force Judas to betray Christ, he double-crosses him and refuses to take him on as a servant once Judas has done so. Moreover, Pilate also swindles his way into possession of the [[Potter's field]], thus owning the land on which Judas commits suicide.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=328}} In the York passion cycle, Pilate describes himself as a courtier, but in most English passion plays he proclaims his royal ancestry.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=297}} The actor who portrayed Pilate in the English plays would typically speak loudly and authoritatively, a fact which was parodied in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=352}}\n\nThe fifteenth century also sees Pilate as a character in plays based on legendary material: one, {{Lang|fr|La Vengeance de Nostre-Seigneur|italics=yes}}, exists in two dramatic treatments focusing on the horrible fates that befell Christ's tormenters: it portrays Pilate being tied to a pillar, covered with oil and honey, and then slowly dismembered over 21 days; he is carefully tended to so that he does not die until the end.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=317}} Another play focusing on Pilate's death is Cornish and based on the {{lang|la|Mors Pilati|italics=yes}}.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=318}} The {{lang|fr|Myst\u00e8re de la Passion d'Angers|italics=yes}} by [[Jean Michel (poet)|Jean Michel]] includes legendary scenes of Pilate's life before the passion.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=365}}\n\n===Modern literature===\nPontius Pilate appears as a character in a large number of literary works, typically as a character in the judgment of Christ.{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=90}} One of the earliest literary works in which he plays a large role is French writer [[Anatole France]]'s 1892 short story {{lang|fr|\"Le Procurateur de Jud\u00e9e\"|italics=no}} (\"The Procurator of Judaea\"), which portrays an elderly Pilate who has been banished to [[Sicily]]. There he lives happily as a farmer and is looked after by his daughter, but suffers from gout and obesity and broods over his time as governor of Judaea.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=358}} Spending his time at the baths of [[Baiae]], Pilate is unable to remember Jesus at all.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=107}}\n\nPilate makes a brief appearance in the preface to [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s 1933 play ''[[On the Rocks: A Political Comedy|On the Rocks]]'' where he argues against Jesus about the dangers of revolution and of new ideas.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=195}} Shortly afterwards, French writer [[Roger Caillois]] wrote a novel ''Pontius Pilate'' (1936), in which Pilate acquits Jesus.{{sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=133}}\n\nPilate features prominently in Russian author [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s novel ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'', which was written in the 1930s but only published in 1966, twenty six years after the author's death.{{sfn|Langenhorst|1995|p=90}} Henry I. MacAdam describes it as \"the 'cult classic' of Pilate-related fiction.\"{{sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=133}} The work features a novel within the novel about Pontius Pilate and his encounter with Jesus by an author only called the Master. Because of this subject matter, the Master has been attacked for \"Pilatism\" by the Soviet literary establishment. Five chapters of the novel are featured as chapters of ''The Master and Margarita''. In them, Pilate is portrayed as wishing to save Jesus, being affected by his charisma, but as too cowardly to do so. Russian critics in the 1960s interpreted this Pilate as \"a model of the spineless provincial bureaucrats of Stalinist Russia.\"{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=273}} Pilate becomes obsessed with his guilt for having killed Jesus.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|1992|p=165}} Because he betrayed his desire to follow his morality and free Jesus, Pilate must suffer for eternity.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=xiii}} Pilate's burden of guilt is finally lifted by the Master when he encounters him at the end of Bulgakov's novel.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=371}}\n\nThe majority of literary texts about Pilate come from the time after the Second World War, a fact which Alexander Demandt suggests shows a cultural dissatisfaction with Pilate having washed his hands of guilt.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=107}} One of Swiss writer [[Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt]]'s earliest stories (\"Pilatus,\" 1949) portrays Pilate as aware that he is torturing God in the trial of Jesus.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=108}} Swiss playwright [[Max Frisch]]'s comedy {{lang|de|Die chinesische Mauer|italics=yes}} portrays Pilate as a skeptical intellectual who refuses to take responsibility for the suffering he has caused.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=107\u2013109}} The German Catholic novelist [[Gertrud von Le Fort]]'s {{lang|de|Die Frau des Pilatus|italics=yes}} portrays Pilate's wife as converting to Christianity after attempting to save Jesus and assuming Pilate's guilt for herself; Pilate executes her as well.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=108}}\n\nIn 1986, Soviet-Kyrgiz writer [[Chingiz Aitmatov]] published a novel in Russian featuring Pilate titled {{lang|ru|Placha|italics=yes}} (''The Place of the Skull''). The novel centers on an extended dialogue between Pilate and Jesus witnessed in a vision by the narrator Avdii Kallistratov, a former seminarian. Pilate is presented as an materialist pessimist who believes mankind will soon destroy itself, whereas Jesus offers a message of hope.{{sfn|Langenhorst|1995|p=90}} Among other topics, the two anachronistically discuss the meaning of the last judgment and the second coming; Pilate fails to comprehend Jesus's teachings and is complacent as he sends him to his death.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|1992|pp=167\u2013168}}\n\n===Film===\nPilate has been depicted in a number of films, being included in portrayals of Christ's passion already in some of the earliest films produced.{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=278-2280}} In the 1927 silent film ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'', Pilate is played by Hungarian-American actor [[Victor Varconi]], who is introduced seated under an enormous 37 feet high [[Aquila (Roman)|Roman eagle]], which Christopher McDonough argues symbolizes \"not power that he possesses but power that possesses him\".{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=283}} During the ''Ecce homo'' scene, the eagle stands in the background between Jesus and Pilate, with a wing above each figure; after hesitantly condemning Jesus, Pilate passes back to the eagle, which is now framed beside him, showing his isolation in his decision and, McDonough suggests, causing the audience to question how well he has served the emperor.{{sfn|McDonough|2009|pp=284-285}}\n\nThe film ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1935 film)|The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1935) portrays Pilate as \"a representative of the gross materialism of the Roman empire\", with the actor [[Basil Rathbone]] giving him long fingers and a long nose.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=38\u201339}} Following the Second World War, Pilate and the Romans often take on a villainous role in American film.{{sfn|Winkler|1998|p=167}} The 1953 film ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'' portrays Pilate as completely covered with gold and rings as a sign of Roman decadence.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} The 1959 film ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' shows Pilate presiding over a chariot race, in a scene that Ann Wroe says \"seemed closely modeled on the Hitler footage of the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]],\" with Pilate bored and sneering.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=186}} Martin Winkler, however, argues that ''Ben-Hur'' provides a more nuanced and less condemnatory portrayal of Pilate and the Roman Empire than most American films of the period.{{sfn|Winkler|1998|p=192}}\n\n[[File:Ponzio Pilato 1962 Marais.png|thumb|Jean Marais as Pontius Pilate in {{lang|it|Ponzio Pilato|italics=yes}} (1962)]]\nOnly one film has been made entirely in Pilate's perspective, the 1962 French-Italian ''[[Ponzio Pilato]]'', where Pilate was played by [[Jean Marais]].{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} In the 1973 film [[Jesus Christ Superstar (film)|''Jesus Christ Superstar'']], the trial of Jesus takes place in the ruins of a Roman theater, suggesting the collapse of Roman authority and \"the collapse of all authority, political or otherwise\".{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=287}} The Pilate in the film, played by [[Barry Dennen]], expands on [[John 18:38]] to question Jesus on the truth and appears, in McDonough's view, as \"an anxious representative of [...] moral relativism\".{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=287}} Speaking of Dennen's portrayal in the trial scene, McDonough describes him as a \"cornered animal.\"{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=290}} Wroe argues that later Pilates took on a sort of effeminancy,{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} illustrated by the Pilate in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'', where Pilate lisps and mispronounces his r's as w's. In [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1988), Pilate is played by [[David Bowie]], who appears as \"gaunt and eerily hermaphrodite.\"{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} Bowie's Pilate speaks with a British accent, contrasting with the American accent of Jesus ([[Willem Dafoe]]).{{sfn|McDonough|2009|pp=290-291}} The trial takes place in Pilate's private stables, implying that Pilate does not think the judgment of Jesus very important, and no attempt is made to take any responsibility from Pilate for Jesus's death, which he orders without any qualms.{{sfn|McDonough|2009|pp=291-293}}\n\n[[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' portrays Pilate, played by [[Hristo Shopov]], as a sympathetic, noble-minded character,{{sfn|Grace|2004|p=16}} fearful that the Jewish priest Caiaphas will start an uprising if he does not give in to his demands. He expresses disgust at the Jewish authorities' treatment of Jesus when Jesus is brought before him and offers Jesus a drink of water.{{sfn|Grace|2004|p=16}} McDonough argues that \"Shopov gives US a very subtle Pilate, one who manages to appear alarmed though not panicked before the crowd, but who betrays far greater misgivings in private conversation with his wife.\"{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=295}}\n\n==Legacy==\nPontius Pilate is mentioned as having been involved in the crucifixion in both the [[Nicene Creed]] and the [[Apostles Creed]]. The Apostles Creed states that Jesus \"suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Apostles' Creed|url=https://www.cardinalnewman.com.au/images/stories/downloads/The%20Apostles%20Creed.pdf|publisher=Cardinal Newman Catechist Consultants|access-date=15 July 2019|date=2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302101028/http://cardinalnewman.com.au/images/stories/downloads/The%20Apostles%20Creed.pdf|archive-date=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The Nicene Creed states \"For our sake [Jesus] was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried.\"<ref>[[s:Nicene Creed (ECUSA Book of Common Prayer)|Nicene Creed in English]]</ref> These creeds are recited weekly by many Christians.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=1}} Pilate is the only person besides Jesus and [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]] mentioned by name in the creeds.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=391}} The mention of Pilate in the creeds serves to mark the passion as a historical event.{{sfn|Bayes|2010|p=78}}\n\nHe is venerated as a saint by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Church]] with a feast day on June 19,{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=167}}{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=11}} and by the [[Coptic Church]], with a feast day of June 25.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=4}}\n\nPilate's washing his hands of responsibility for Jesus's death in Matthew 27:24 is a commonly encountered image in the popular imagination,{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=xi}} and is the origin of the English phrase [[Wiktionary:wash one's hands of|\"to wash one's hands of (the matter)\"]], meaning to refuse further involvement with or responsibility for something.{{sfn|Martin|2019}} Parts of the dialogue attributed to Pilate in the [[Gospel of John]] have become particularly famous sayings, especially quoted in the Latin version of the [[Vulgate]].{{Sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=139}} These include {{bibleverse|John|18:35|KJV}} ({{Lang|la|numquid ego Iudaeus sum?|italics=yes}} \"Am I a Jew?\"), [[John 18:38]] ({{Lang|la|Quid est veritas?|italics=yes}}; \"what is truth?\"), [[John 19#Verse 5|John 19:5]] ({{Lang|la|[[Ecce homo]]|italics=yes}}, \"Behold the man!\"), {{bibleverse|John|19:14|KJV}} ({{lang|la|Ecce rex vester|italics=yes}}, \"Behold your king!\"), and {{bibleverse|John|19:22|KJV}} ({{lang|la|[[Quod scripsi, scripsi]]|italics=yes}}, \"What I have written, I have written\").{{Sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=139}}\n\nThe Gospels' deflection of responsibility for Jesus's crucifixion from Pilate to the Jews has been blamed for fomenting [[antisemitism]] from the Middle Ages through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=331\u2013332}}\n\n===Scholarly assessments===\nThe main ancient sources on Pilate offer very different views on his governorship and personality. Philo is hostile, Josephus mostly neutral, and the Gospels \"comparatively friendly.\"{{sfn|McGing|1991|pp=415\u2013416}} This, combined with the general lack of information on Pilate's long time in office, has resulted in a wide range of assessments by modern scholars.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=12\u201319}}\n\nOn the basis of the many offenses that Pilate caused to the Judaean populace, some scholars find Pilate to have been a particularly bad governor. M. P. Charlesworth argues that Pilate was \"a man whose character and capacity fell below those of the ordinary provincial official [...] in ten years he had piled blunder on blunder in his scorn for and misunderstanding of the people he was sent to rule.\"{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=363}} However, Paul Maier argues that Pilate's long term as governor of Judaea indicates he must have been a reasonably competent administrator,{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=365}} while Henry MacAdam argues that \"[a]mong the Judaean governors prior to the Jewish War, Pilate must be ranked as more capable than most.\"{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=77}} Other scholars have argued that Pilate was simply culturally insensitive in his interactions with the Jews and in this way a typical Roman official.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nBeginning with E. Stauffer in 1948, scholars have argued, on the basis of his possible appointment by [[Sejanus]], that Pilate's offenses against the Jews were directed by Sejanus out of hatred of the Jews and a desire to destroy their nation, a theory supported by the pagan imagery on Pilate's coins.{{sfn|Maier|1968|pp=9\u201310}} According to this theory, following Sejanus's execution in 31 CE and Tiberius's purges of his supporters, Pilate, fearful of being removed himself, became far more cautious, explaining his apparently weak and vaciliating attitude at the trial of Jesus.{{sfn|Maier|1968|pp=10\u201311}} Helen Bond argues that \"[g]iven the history of pagan designs throughout Judaean coinage, particularly from Herod and Gratus, Pilate's coins do not seem to be deliberately offensive,\"{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=21}} and that the coins offer little evidence of any connection between Pilate and Sejanus.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=22}} Carter notes this theory arose in the context of the aftermath of the [[Holocaust]], that the evidence that Sejanus was anti-Semitic depends entirely on Philo, and that \"[m]ost scholars have not been convinced that it is an accurate or a fair picture of Pilate.\"{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=4}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of biblical figures identified in extra-biblical sources]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal| last1=Amora-Stark |first1=Shua |display-authors=etal |title= An Inscribed Copper-Alloy Finger Ring from Herodium Depicting a Krater |journal=Israel Exploration Journal |volume= 68 |issue=2 |year=2018 |pages=208\u2013220|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329307909 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Ash |editor-first=Rhiannon |title=Tacitus Annals.

He is best known today for being the official who presided over the [[Pilate's court|trial]] of [[Jesus]] and ordered his [[crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]]. Pilate's importance in modern Christianity is underscored by his prominent place in both the [[Apostles' Creed|Apostles]] and [[Nicene Creed]]s. Due to the Gospels' portrayal of Pilate as reluctant to execute Jesus, the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic]] and [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Churches]] believe that Pilate became a Christian and venerate him as a [[martyr]] and [[saint]].{{sfnm|1a1=Carter|1y=2003|1p=11|2a1=Gr\u00fcll|2y=2010|2p=167}}\n\nAlthough Pilate is the best-attested governor of Judaea, few sources on his rule have survived. He appears to have belonged to the well-attested [[Pontia gens|Pontii]] family, but nothing is known for certain about his life before he became governor of Judaea, nor of the circumstances that led to his appointment to the governorship.{{sfnm|1a1=Schwartz|1y=1992|1p=398|2a1=L\u00e9monon|2y=2007|2p=121}} A single inscription from Pilate's governorship has survived, the so-called [[Pilate stone]], as have coins that he minted. The Jewish historian [[Josephus]] and philosopher [[Philo of Alexandria]] both mention incidents of tension and violence between the Jewish population and Pilate's administration. Many of these involve Pilate acting in ways that offended the religious sensibilities of the Jews. The Christian [[Gospels]] record that Pilate ordered the crucifixion of Jesus at some point during his time in office; Josephus and the Roman historian [[Tacitus]] also appear to have recorded this information. According to Josephus, Pilate's removal from office occurred because he violently suppressed an armed [[Samaritans|Samaritan]] movement at [[Mount Gerizim]]. He was sent back to Rome by the legate of [[Roman Syria|Syria]] to answer for this before Tiberius, who, however, had died before he arrived. Nothing is known for certain about what happened to him after this. On the basis of a mention in the second-century pagan philosopher [[Celsus]] and Christian apologist [[Origen]], most modern historians believe that Pilate simply retired after his dismissal.{{sfnm|1a1=Maier|1y=1971|1p=371|2a1=Demandt|2y=2012|2pp=92\u201393}} Modern historians have differing assessments of Pilate as an effective ruler; while some believe he was a particularly brutal and ineffective governor, others argue that his long time in office means he must have been reasonably competent. According to one prominent [[post-war]] theory, Pilate was motivated by [[antisemitism]] in his treatment of the Jews, but this theory has been mostly abandoned.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1p=22|2a1=Carter|2y=2003|3p=4}}\n\nIn [[Late Antiquity]] and the [[Early Middle Ages]], Pilate became the focus of a large group of [[New Testament apocrypha]] expanding on his role in the Gospels. In many of these, particularly the earlier texts from the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], Pilate was portrayed as a positive figure. In some, he became a Christian [[martyr]]. In later, particularly Western Christian texts, he was instead portrayed as a negative figure and villain, with traditions surrounding his death by suicide featuring prominently. Pilate was also the focus of numerous medieval [[legend]]s, which invented a complete biography for him and portrayed him as villainous and cowardly. Many of these legends connected Pilate's place of birth or death to particular locations around [[Western Europe]].\n\nPilate has frequently been a subject of artistic representation. [[Medieval art]] frequently portrayed scenes of Pilate and Jesus, often in the scene where he washes his hands of guilt for Jesus's death. In the art of the [[Late Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], Pilate is often depicted as a Jew. The nineteenth century saw a renewed interest in depicting Pilate, with numerous images made. He plays an important role in medieval [[passion plays]], where he is often a more prominent character than Jesus. His characterization in these plays varies greatly, from weak-willed and coerced into crucifying Jesus to being an evil person who demands Jesus's crucifixion. Modern authors who feature Pilate prominently in their works include [[Anatole France]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], and [[Chingiz Aitmatov]], with a majority of modern treatments of Pilate dating to after the [[Second World War]].

They became ennobled as equestrians.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=46\u201347}}\n\nPilate was likely educated, somewhat wealthy, and well-connected politically and socially.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=15}} He was probably married, but the only extant reference to [[Pontius Pilate's wife|his wife]], in which she tells him after a disturbing dream not to interact with Jesus ({{bibleverse|Matthew|27:19|KJV}}), is generally dismissed as legendary.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1p=197|2a1=Demandt|2y=2012|2pp=76-77|3a1=L\u00e9monon|3y=2007|3p=167}} According to the ''[[Tres militiae|cursus honorum]]'' established by [[Augustus]] for office holders of equestrian rank, Pilate would have had a military command before becoming prefect of Judaea; [[Alexander Demandt]] speculates that this could have been with a legion stationed at the [[Rhine]] or [[Danube]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=48}} Although it is therefore likely Pilate served in the military, it is nevertheless not certain.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\n===Role as governor of Judaea===\n[[File:First century Iudaea province.gif|thumb|Map of the province of Judaea during Pilate's governorship in the first century CE.]]\nPilate was the fifth governor of the Roman province of Judaea, during the reign of the emperor [[Tiberius]]. The post of governor of Judaea was of relatively low prestige and nothing is known of how Pilate obtained the office.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=398}} Josephus states that Pilate governed for 10 years (''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' 18.4.2), and these are traditionally dated from 26 to 36/37 CE, making him one of the two longest-serving governors of the province.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=8}} As Tiberius had retired to the island of [[Capri]] in 26 CE, scholars such as E. Stauffer have argued that Pilate may have actually been appointed by the powerful [[Praetorian Prefect]] [[Sejanus]], who was executed for treason in 31 CE.{{sfn|Maier|1968|pp=8\u20139}} Other scholars have cast doubt on any link between Pilate and Sejanus.{{sfnm|1a1=McGing|1y=1991|1p=427|2a1=Carter|2y=2003|2p=4|3a1=Schwartz|3y=1992|3p=398}} [[Daniel R. Schwartz]] and Kenneth L\u00f6nnqvist both argue that the traditional dating of the beginning of Pilate's governorship is based on an error in Josephus; Schwartz argues that he was appointed instead in 19 CE, while L\u00f6nnqvist argues for 17/18 CE.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|pp=396\u2013397}}{{sfn|L\u00f6nnqvist|2000|p=67}} This redating has not been widely accepted by other scholars.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=122}}\n\nPilate's title of prefect{{efn|Pilate's title as governor, as attested on the Pilate stone, is \"[[Prefect#Ancient Rome|prefect]] of Judaea\" ({{Lang|la|praefectus Iudaeae|italics=yes}}). His title is given as {{Lang|la|[[Procurator (Ancient Rome)|procurator]]|italics=yes}} in Tacitus, and with the Greek equivalent {{Transl|grc|epitropos|italics=yes}} ({{Lang|grc|\u1f10\u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2|italics=no}}) in Josephus and Philo.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=397}} The title prefect was later changed to \"procurator\" under the emperor [[Claudius]], explaining why later sources give Pilate this title.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=11\u201312}} The [[New Testament]] uses the generic Greek term {{Transl|grc|[[Hegemony|hegemon]]|italics=yes}} ({{Lang|grc|\u1f21\u03b3\u03b5\u03bc\u03ce\u03bd|italics=no}}), a term also applied to Pilate in Josephus.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=397}}}} implies that his duties were primarily military;{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=11}} however, Pilate's troops were meant more as a police than a military force, and Pilate's duties extended beyond military matters.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=197}} As Roman governor, he was head of the judicial system. He had the power to inflict [[capital punishment]], and was responsible for collecting tributes and taxes, and for disbursing funds, including the minting of coins.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=197}} Because the Romans allowed a certain degree of local control, Pilate shared a limited amount of civil and religious power with the Jewish [[Sanhedrin]].{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=70}}\n\nPilate was subordinate to the legate of [[Roman Syria|Syria]]; however, for the first six years in which he held office, Syria lacked a legate, something which [[Helen Bond]] believes may have presented difficulties to Pilate.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=5, 14\u201315}} He seems to have been free to govern the province as he wished, with intervention by the legate of Syria only coming at the end of his tenure.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=398}} Like other Roman governors of Judaea, Pilate made his primary residence in [[Caesarea]], going to [[Jerusalem]] mainly for major feasts in order to maintain order.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=7\u20138}} He also would have toured around the province in order to hear cases and administer justice.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=46}}\n\nAs governor, Pilate had the right to appoint the Jewish [[High Priest of Israel|High Priest]] and also officially controlled the vestiments of the High Priest in the [[Antonia Fortress]].{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|pp=86\u201388}} Unlike his predecessor, [[Valerius Gratus]], Pilate retained the same high priest, [[Caiaphas]], for his entire tenure. Caiaphas would be removed following Pilate's own removal from the governorship.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=19}} This indicates that Caiaphas and the priests of the [[Sadducees|Sadducee sect]] were reliable allies to Pilate.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=48}} Moreover, Maier argues that Pilate could not have used the [[temple treasury]] to construct an aqueduct, as recorded by Josephus, without the cooperation of the priests.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=364}} Similarly, Helen Bond argues that Pilate is depicted working closely with the Jewish authorities in the execution of Jesus.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=89}} Jean-Pierre L\u00e9monon argues that official cooperation with Pilate was limited to the Sadducees, noting that the [[Pharisees]] are absent from the gospel accounts of Jesus's arrest and trial.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=172}}\n\nDaniel Schwartz takes the note in the [[Gospel of Luke]] ([[Luke 23]]:12) that Pilate had a difficult relationship with the Galilean Jewish king [[Herod Antipas]] as potentially historical. He also finds historical the information that their relationship mended following the execution of Jesus.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=400}} Based on [[John 19]]:12, it is possible that Pilate held the title \"friend of Caesar\" ({{Lang-la|amicus Caesaris|italics=yes}}, {{Lang-grc|\u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 K\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2|italics=no}}), a title also held by the Jewish kings [[Herod Agrippa I]] and [[Herod Agrippa II]] and by close advisors to the emperor. Both Daniel Schwartz and Alexander Demandt do not think this information especially likely.{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=398}}{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=60\u201361}}\n\n===Incidents with the Jews===\n\nVarious disturbances during Pilate's governship are recorded in the sources. In some cases, it is unclear if they may be referring to the same event,{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=399}} and it is difficult to establish a chronology of events for Pilate's rule.{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=78}} Joan Taylor argues that Pilate had a policy of promoting the [[imperial cult of ancient Rome|imperial cult]], which may have caused some of the friction with his Jewish subjects.{{sfn|Taylor|2006}} Schwartz suggests that Pilate's entire tenure was characterized by \"continued underlying tension between governor and governed, now and again breaking out in brief incidents.\"{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=399}}\n\nAccording to Josephus in his ''[[The Jewish War]]'' (2.9.2) and ''[[Antiquities of the Jews]]'' (18.3.1), Pilate offended the Jews by moving imperial standards with the image of Caesar into Jerusalem. This resulted in a crowd of Jews surrounding Pilate's house in Caesarea for five days. Pilate then summoned them to an [[arena]], where the Roman soldiers drew their swords. But the Jews showed so little fear of death, that Pilate relented and removed the standards.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=52\u201353}} Bond argues that the fact that Josephus says that Pilate brought in the standards by night, shows that he knew that the images of the emperor would be offensive.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=57}} She dates this incident to early in Pilate's tenure as governor.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=79}} Daniel Schwartz and Alexander Demandt both suggest that this incident is in fact identical with \"the incident with the shields\" reported in Philo's ''Embassy to Gaius'', an identification first made by the early church historian [[Eusebius]].{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=53\u201355}}{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=399}} L\u00e9monon, however, argues against this identification.{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|p=206}}\n\nAccording to Philo's ''Embassy to Gaius'' (''Embassy to Gaius'' 38), Pilate offended against [[Halakha|Jewish law]] by bringing golden shields into Jerusalem, and placing them on [[Herod's Palace (Jerusalem)|Herod's Palace]]. The sons of [[Herod the Great]] petitioned him to remove the shields, but Pilate refused. Herod's sons then threatened to petition the emperor, an action which Pilate feared that would expose the crimes he had committed in office. He did not prevent their petition. Tiberius received the petition and angrily reprimanded Pilate, ordering him to remove the shields.{{sfn|Yonge|1855|pp=165\u2013166}} Helen Bond, Daniel Schwartz, and [[Warren Carter]] argue that Philo's portrayal is largely stereotyped and rhetorical, portraying Pilate with the same words as other opponents of Jewish law, while portraying Tiberius as just and supportive of Jewish law.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1pp=36\u201337|2a1=Carter|2y=2003|2pp=15\u201316|3a1=Schwartz|3y=1992|3p=399}} It is unclear why the shields offended against Jewish law: it is likely that they contained an inscription referring to Tiberius as {{lang|la|divi Augusti filius|italics=yes}} (son of divine Augustus).{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=39}}{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=51\u201352}} Bond dates the incident to 31 CE, sometime after Sejanus's death in October 17.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=46}}\n\nIn another incident recorded in both the ''Jewish Wars'' (2.9.4) and the ''Antiquities of the Jews'' (18.3.2), Josephus relates that Pilate offended the Jews by using up the [[temple treasury]] ({{lang|grc|korbanos|italics=yes}}) to pay for a new aqueduct to Jerusalem. When a mob formed while Pilate was visiting Jerusalem, Pilate ordered his troops to beat them with clubs; many perished from the blows or from being trampled by horses, and the mob was dispersed.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=53}} The dating of the incident is unknown, but Bond argues that it must have occurred between 26 and 30 or 33 CE, based on Josephus's chronology.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=89}}\n\nThe Gospel of Luke mentions in passing Galileans \"whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices\" ([[Luke 13]]:1). This reference has been variously interpreted as referring to one of the incidents recorded by Josephus, or to an entirely unknown incident.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=194\u2013195}} Bond argues that the number of Galileans killed does not seem to have been particularly high. In Bond's view, the reference to \"sacrifices\" likely means that this incident occurred at [[Passover]] at some unknown date.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=195\u2013196}} She argues that \"[i]t is not only possible but quite likely that Pilate's governorship contained many such brief outbreaks of trouble about which we know nothing. The insurrection in which [[Barabbas]] was caught up, if historical, may well be another example.\"{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=196}}\n\n===Trial and execution of Jesus===\n{{see also|Pilate's Court|Crucifixion of Jesus}}\n{{Gospel Jesus}}\nAt the [[Passover]] of most likely 30 or 33 CE, Pontius Pilate condemned [[Jesus]] of Nazareth to death by [[crucifixion]] in Jerusalem.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=201}} The main sources on the crucifixion are the four canonical Christian [[Gospel]]s, the accounts of which vary.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=22\u201323}} Helen Bond argues that\n<blockquote>the evangelists' portrayals of Pilate have been shaped to a great extent by their own particular theological and apologetic concerns. [...] Legendary or theological additions have also been made to the narrative [...] Despite extensive differences, however, there is a certain agreement amongst the evangelists regarding the basic facts, an agreement which may well go beyond literary dependency and reflect actual historical events.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=196\u2013167}}</blockquote>\nPilate's role in condemning Jesus to death is also attested by the Roman historian [[Tacitus on Christ|Tacitus]], who, when explaining [[Nero]]'s persecution of the Christians, explains: \"Christus, the founder of the name, had undergone the death penalty in the reign of Tiberius, by sentence of the procurator Pontius Pilate, and the pernicious [[superstition]] was checked for a moment...\" (Tacitus, ''Annals'' 15.44).{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=12}}{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=xi}} The authenticity of this passage has been disputed, and it is possible that Tacitus received this information from Christian informants.{{sfn|Ash|2018|p=194}} Josephus appears also [[Josephus on Jesus|to have mentioned Jesus]]'s execution by Pilate at the request of prominent Jews (''Antiquities of the Jews'' 18.3.3). However, the original text has been greatly altered by later [[Christian interpolation]], so that it is impossible to know what Josephus may have originally said.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=67, 71}} Discussing the paucity of extra-biblical mentions of the crucifixion, Alexander Demandt argues that the execution of Jesus was probably not seen as a particularly important event by the Romans, as many other people were crucified at the time and forgotten.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=44\u201345}}\n\nBond argues that Jesus's arrest was made with Pilate's prior knowledge and involvement, based on the presence of a 500-strong Roman cohort among the party that arrests Jesus in John 18.3.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=197}} Demandt dismisses the notion that Pilate was involved.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=70-71}} It is generally assumed, based on the unanimous testimony of the gospels, that the crime for which Jesus was brought to Pilate and executed was sedition, founded on his claim to be [[Kings of Israel and Judah|king of the Jews]].{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1pp=197\u2013198|2a1=L\u00e9monon|2y=2007|2p=172|3a1=Demandt|3y=2012|3p=74}} Pilate may have judged Jesus according to the ''[[Roman litigation#Cognitio|cognitio]]'' {{lang|la|extra ordinem|italics=yes}}, a form of trial for [[capital punishment]] used in the Roman provinces and applied to [[Roman citizenship|non-Roman citizens]] that provided the prefect with greater flexibility in handling the case.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=198}}{{sfn|L\u00e9monon|2007|pp=172\u2013173}} All four gospels also mention that Pilate had the custom of releasing one captive in honor of the [[Passover]] festival; this custom is not attested in any other source. Historians disagree on whether or not such a custom is a fictional element of the gospels, reflects historical reality, or perhaps represents a single [[amnesty]] in the year of Jesus's crucifixion.{{sfnm|1a1=Bond|1y=1998|1pp=199|2a1=L\u00e9monon|2y=2007|2pp=173\u2013176|3a1=Demandt|3y=2012|3pp=75\u201376}}\n\n[[File:Munkacsy - Christ in front of Pilate.jpg|thumb|left|''Christ before Pilate'', [[Mih\u00e1ly Munk\u00e1csy]], 1881]]\nThe Gospels' portrayal of Pilate is \"widely assumed\" to diverge greatly from that found in Josephus and Philo,{{sfn|McGing|1991|p=417}} as Pilate is portrayed as reluctant to execute Jesus and pressured to do so by the crowd and Jewish authorities. John P. Meier notes that in Josephus, by contrast, \"Pilate alone [...] is said to condemn Jesus to the cross.\"{{sfn|Meier|1990|p=95}} Some scholars believe that the Gospel accounts are completely untrustworthy: S. G. F. Brandon argued that in reality, rather than vacilating on condemning Jesus, Pilate unhesitatingly executed him as a rebel.{{sfn|McGing|1991|pp=417\u2013418}} Paul Winter explained the discrepancy between Pilate in other sources and Pilate in the gospels by arguing that Christians became more and more eager to portray Pontius Pilate as a witness to Jesus' innocence, as persecution of Christians by the Roman authorities increased.{{sfn|Winter|1974|pp=85\u201386}} [[Bart Ehrman]] argues that the earliest Gospel, Mark, shows the Jews and Pilate to be in agreement about executing Jesus (Mark 15:15), while the later gospels progressively reduce Pilate's culpability, culminating in Pilate allowing the Jews to crucify Jesus in John (John 18:16). He connects this change to increased \"anti-Judaism.\"{{sfn|Ehrman|2003|pp=20-21}} Others have tried to explain Pilate's behavior in the Gospels as motivated by a change of circumstances from that shown in Josephus and Philo, usually presupposing a connection between Pilate's caution and the death of Sejanus.{{sfn|McGing|1991|p=417}} Yet other scholars, such as Brian McGing and Bond, have argued that there is no real discrepancy between Pilate's behavior in Josephus and Philo and that in the Gospels.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=201}}{{sfn|McGing|1991|pp=435\u2013436}} Warren Carter argues that Pilate is portrayed as skillful, competent, and manipulative of the crowd in Mark, Matthew, and John, only finding Jesus innocent and executing him under pressure in Luke.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=153\u2013154}}\n\n===Removal and later life===\nAccording to Josephus' ''Antiquities of the Jews'' (18.4.1-2), Pilate's removal as governor occurred after Pilate slaughtered a group of armed [[Samaritans]] at a village called Tirathana near [[Mount Gerizim]], where they hoped to find artifacts that had been buried there by [[Moses]]. Alexander Demandt suggests that the leader of this movement may have been [[Dositheos (Samaritan)|Dositheos]], a [[messiah]]-like figure among the Samaritans who was known to have been active around this time.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=63}} The Samaritans, claiming not to have been armed, complained to [[Lucius Vitellius the Elder]], the [[List of Roman governors of Syria|governor of Syria]] (term 35-39), who had Pilate recalled to Rome to be judged by Tiberius. Tiberius however, had died before his arrival.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=67}} This dates the end of Pilate's governorship to 36/37 CE. Tiberius died in [[Misenum]] on 16 March AD&nbsp;37, in his seventy-eighth year (Tacitus, ''Annals'' [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#50|VI.50]], [[wikisource:The Annals (Tacitus)/Book 6#51|VI.51]]).<ref>Karen Cokayne, Experiencing Old Age In Ancient Rome, p.100</ref>\n\nFollowing Tiberius's death, Pilate's hearing would have been handled by the new emperor [[Gaius Caligula]]: it is unclear whether any hearing took place, as new emperors often dismissed outstanding legal matters from previous reigns.{{sfn|Maier|1971|pp=366\u2013367}} The only sure outcome of Pilate's return to Rome is that he was not reinstated as governor of Judaea, either because the hearing went badly, or because Pilate did not wish to return.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=367}} J. P. L\u00e9monon argues that the fact that Pilate was not reinstated by Caligula does not mean that his trial went badly, but may simply have been because after ten years in the position it was time for him to take a new posting.{{sfn|Bond|1998|pp=92\u201393}} Joan Taylor, on the other hand, argues that Pilate seems to have ended his career in disgrace, using his unflattering portrayal in Philo, written only a few years after his dismissal, as proof.{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=577}}\n\n[[File:A remorseful Pilate prepares to kill himself. Engraving by G Wellcome V0034470.jpg|thumb|A remorseful Pilate prepares to kill himself. Engraving by G. Mochetti after B. Pinelli, early 19th century.]]\nThe church historian [[Eusebius]] ([[Church History (Eusebius)|''Church History'']] 2.6.7), writing in the early fourth century, claims that \"tradition relates that\" Pilate committed suicide after he was recalled to Rome due to the disgrace he was in.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=369}} Eusebius dates this to 39 CE.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=92}} Paul Maier notes that no other surviving records corroborate Pilate's suicide, which is meant to document God's wrath for Pilate's role in the crucifixion, and that Eusebius explicitly states that \"tradition\" is his source, \"indicating that he had trouble documenting Pilate's presumed suicide\".{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=369}} Daniel Schwartz, however, argues that Eusebius's claims \"should not lightly be dismissed.\"{{sfn|Schwartz|1992|p=400}} More information on the potential fate of Pontius Pilate can be gleaned from other sources. The second-century pagan philosopher [[Celsus]] polemically asked why, if Jesus was God, God had not punished Pilate, indicating that he did not believe that Pilate shamefully committed suicide. Responding to Celsus, the Christian apologist [[Origen]], writing c. 248 CE, argued that nothing bad happened to Pilate, because the Jews and not Pilate were responsible for Jesus' death; he therefore also assumed that Pilate did not die a shameful death.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=370}}{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=154\u2013155}} Pilate's supposed suicide is also left unmentioned in Josephus, Philo, or Tacitus.{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=370}} Maier argues that \"[i]n all probability, then, the fate of Pontius Pilate lay clearly in the direction of a retired government official, a pensioned Roman ex-magistrate, than in anything more disastrous.\"{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=371}} Taylor notes that Philo discusses Pilate as though he were already dead in the ''Embassy to Gaius'', although he is writing only a few years after Pilate's tenure as governor.{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=578}}\n\n==Archaeology and minted coins==\n[[File:Pilate Inscription.JPG|thumb|The so-called [[Pilate Stone]].

Perhaps the earliest apocryphal texts attributed to Pilate are denunciations of Christianity and of Jesus that claim to be Pilate's report on the crucifixion. According to [[Eusebius]] ([[Church History (Eusebius)|''Church History'']] 9.2.5), these texts were distributed during the persecution of Christians conducted by the emperor [[Maximinus II]] (reigned 308\u2013313 CE).

\"Herod\" asks Pilate to pray for him.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nIn the so-called ''Book of the Cock'', a late-antique apocryphal passion Gospel only preserved in [[Ge'ez]] (Ethiopic) but translated from Arabic,{{sfn|Piovanelli|2003|pp=427-428}} Pilate attempts to avoid Jesus's execution by sending him to Herod and writing further letters arguing with Herod not to execute Jesus.

In the ''[[Cura sanitatis Tiberii]]'' (dated variously 5th to 7th c.),{{sfn|Gounelle|2011|p=233}} the emperor Tiberius is healed by an image of Jesus brought by [[Saint Veronica]], [[Saint Peter]] then confirms Pilate's report on Jesus's miracles, and Pilate is exiled by the emperor [[Nero]], after which he commits suicide.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=162}} A similar narrative plays out in the ''[[Vindicta Salvatoris]]'' (8th c.).{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=162}}{{sfn|Gounelle|2011|pp=243-244}} In the ''Mors Pilati'' (perhaps originally 6th c., but recorded c. 1300),{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=36}} Pilate was forced to commit suicide and his body thrown in the Tiber. However, the body is surrounded by demons and storms, so that it is removed from the Tiber and instead cast into the Rhone, where the same thing happens. Finally, the corpse is taken to [[Lausanne]] in modern Switzerland and buried in an isolated pit, where demonic visitations continue to occur.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|pp=162\u2013163}}\n\n===Later legends===\n[[File:Pontius Pilatus angebl Grabmal Vienne (IZ 48-1867 S 266 JResch).jpg|thumb|19th-c. lithograph of the supposed tomb of Pontius Pilate in [[Vienne]], France.

The king reads in the stars that he will bear a son who will rule over many lands, so he has a miller's daughter named Pila brought to him whom he impregnates; Pilate's name thus results from the combination of the names ''Pila'' with ''Atus''. A few years later, Pilate is brought to his father's court where he kills his half-brother. As a result, he is sent as a hostage to Rome, where he kills another hostage. As punishment he is sent to the island of Pontius, whose inhabitants he subjugates, thus acquiring the name Pontius Pilate. King Herod hears of this accomplishment and asks him to come to Palestine to aid his rule there; Pilate comes but soon usurps Herod's power.{{sfn|Martin|1973|pp=101\u2013102}} The trial and judgment of Jesus then happens as in the gospels. The emperor in Rome is suffering from a terrible disease at this time, and hearing of Christ's healing powers, sends for him only to learn from [[Saint Veronica]] that Christ has been crucified, but she possesses a cloth with the image of his face. Pilate is taken as a prisoner with her to Rome to be judged, but every time the emperor sees Pilate to condemn him, his anger dissipates. This is revealed to be because Pilate is wearing Jesus's coat; when the coat is removed, the Emperor condemns him to death, but Pilate commits suicide first. The body is first thrown in the Tiber, but because it causes storms it is then moved to Vienne, and then thrown in a lake in the high Alps.{{sfn|Martin|1973|pp=102\u2013103}}\n\nOne important version of the Pilate legend is found in the ''[[Golden Legend]]'' by [[Jacobus de Voragine]] (1263\u20131273), one of the most popular books of the later Middle Ages.{{sfn|Martin|1973|p=109}} In the ''Golden Legend'', Pilate is portrayed as closely associated with [[Judas]], first coveting the fruit in the orchard of Judas's father Ruben, then granting Judas Ruben's property after Judas has killed his own father.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=234}}\n\nSeveral places in Western Europe have traditions associated with Pilate. The cities of [[Lyon]] and [[Vienne]] in modern France claim to be Pilate's birthplace: Vienne has a ''Maison de Pilate'', a ''Pr\u00e9toire de Pilate'' and a ''Tour de Pilate''.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=104}} One tradition states the Pilate was banished to Vienne where a Roman ruin is associated with his tomb; according to another, Pilate took refuge in a mountain (now called [[Mount Pilatus]]) in modern Switzerland, before eventually committing suicide in a lake on its summit.{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=164}} This connection to Mount Pilatus is attested from 1273 onwards, while [[Lake Lucerne]] has been called \"Pilatus-See\" (Pilate Lake) beginning in the fourteenth century.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=104\u2013105}} A number of traditions also connected Pilate to Germany.

He is frequently depicted as a more important character to the narrative than even Jesus,{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=363}} and became one of the most important figures of medieval drama in the fifteenth century.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=296}} The three most popular scenes in the plays to include Pilate are his washing of hands, the warning of his wife Procula not to harm Jesus, and the writing of the ''titulus'' on Jesus' cross.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=297}} Pilate's characterization varies greatly from play to play, but later plays frequently portray Pilate somewhat ambiguously, though he is usually a negative character, and sometimes an evil villain.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=363\u2013364}} While in some plays Pilate is opposed to the Jews and condemns them, in others he describes himself as a Jew or supports their wish to kill Christ.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=364}}\n\nIn the passion plays from the continental Western Europe, Pilate's characterization varies from good to evil, but he is mostly a benign figure.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=365}} The earliest surviving passion play, the thirteenth-century {{lang|la|Ludus de Passione|italics=yes}} from [[Klosterneuburg]], portrays Pilate as a weak administrator who succumbs to the whims of the Jews in having Christ crucified.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=237}} Pilate goes on to play an important role in the increasingly long and elaborate passion plays performed in the German-speaking countries and in France.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=365\u2013366}} In [[Arnoul Gr\u00e9ban]]'s fifteenth-century ''Passion'', Pilate instructs the flagellators on how best to whip Jesus.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=283\u2013284}} The 1517 {{lang|de|Alsfelder Passionsspiel|italics=yes}} portrays Pilate as condemning Christ to death out of fear of losing Herod's friendship and to earn the Jews' good will, despite his long dialogues with the Jews in which he professes Christ's innocence. He eventually becomes a Christian himself.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=366\u2013367}} In the 1493 {{lang|de|Frankfurter Passionsspiel|italics=yes}}, on the other hand, Pilate himself accuses Christ.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=367\u2013368}} The fifteenth-century German Benediktbeuern passion play depicts Pilate as a good friend of Herod's, kissing him in a reminiscence of the kiss of Judas.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=252}} Colum Hourihane argues that all of these plays supported antisemitic tropes and were written at times when persecution of Jews on the continent were high.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=368\u2013369}}\n\nThe fifteenth-century Roman {{lang|it|Passione|italics=yes}} depicts Pilate as trying to save Jesus against the wishes of the Jews.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=364}} In the Italian passion plays, Pilate never identifies himself as a Jew, condemning them in the fifteenth-century {{lang|it|Resurrezione|italics=yes}} and stressing the Jews' fear of the \"new law\" of Christ.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=364\u2013365}}\n\nHourihane argues that in England, where the Jews had been expelled in 1290, Pilate's characterization may have been used primarily to satyrize corrupt officials and judges rather than to stoke antisemitism.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=265}} In several English plays, Pilate is portrayed speaking French or Latin, the languages of the ruling classes and the law.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=177\u2013178}} In the Wakefield plays, Pilate is portrayed as wickedly evil, describing himself as Satan's agent ({{lang|la|mali actoris|italics=yes}}) while plotting Christ's torture so as to extract the most pain. He nonetheless washes his hands of guilt after the tortures have been administered.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=286}} Yet many scholars believe the motif of the conniving devil and the Jews to be inextricably linked. By the thirteenth century, medieval arts and literature had a well-established tradition of the Jew as the Devil in disguise. <ref name=\":0\" /> Thus, some scholars believe that Anti-Judaism still lies near the heart of the matter.<ref name=\":0\" /> In the fifteenth-century English Townley Cycle, Pilate is portrayed as a pompous lord and prince of the Jews, but also as forcing Christ's torturer to give him Christ's clothes at the foot of the cross.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=243}} It is he alone who wishes to kill Christ rather than the high priests, conspiring together with Judas.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=297, 328}} In the fifteenth-century English York passion play, Pilate judges Jesus together with [[Annas]] and [[Caiaphas]], becoming a central character of the passion narrative who converses with and instructs other characters.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|pp=243\u2013245}} In this play, when Judas comes back to Pilate and the priests to tell them he no longer wishes to betray Jesus, Pilate browbeats Judas into going through with the plan.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=213\u2013214}} Not only does Pilate force Judas to betray Christ, he double-crosses him and refuses to take him on as a servant once Judas has done so. Moreover, Pilate also swindles his way into possession of the [[Potter's field]], thus owning the land on which Judas commits suicide.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=328}} In the York passion cycle, Pilate describes himself as a courtier, but in most English passion plays he proclaims his royal ancestry.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=297}} The actor who portrayed Pilate in the English plays would typically speak loudly and authoritatively, a fact which was parodied in [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=352}}\n\nThe fifteenth century also sees Pilate as a character in plays based on legendary material: one, {{Lang|fr|La Vengeance de Nostre-Seigneur|italics=yes}}, exists in two dramatic treatments focusing on the horrible fates that befell Christ's tormenters: it portrays Pilate being tied to a pillar, covered with oil and honey, and then slowly dismembered over 21 days; he is carefully tended to so that he does not die until the end.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=317}} Another play focusing on Pilate's death is Cornish and based on the {{lang|la|Mors Pilati|italics=yes}}.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=318}} The {{lang|fr|Myst\u00e8re de la Passion d'Angers|italics=yes}} by [[Jean Michel (poet)|Jean Michel]] includes legendary scenes of Pilate's life before the passion.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=365}}\n\n===Modern literature===\nPontius Pilate appears as a character in a large number of literary works, typically as a character in the judgment of Christ.{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=90}} One of the earliest literary works in which he plays a large role is French writer [[Anatole France]]'s 1892 short story {{lang|fr|\"Le Procurateur de Jud\u00e9e\"|italics=no}} (\"The Procurator of Judaea\"), which portrays an elderly Pilate who has been banished to [[Sicily]]. There he lives happily as a farmer and is looked after by his daughter, but suffers from gout and obesity and broods over his time as governor of Judaea.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=358}} Spending his time at the baths of [[Baiae]], Pilate is unable to remember Jesus at all.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=107}}\n\nPilate makes a brief appearance in the preface to [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s 1933 play ''[[On the Rocks: A Political Comedy|On the Rocks]]'' where he argues against Jesus about the dangers of revolution and of new ideas.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=195}} Shortly afterwards, French writer [[Roger Caillois]] wrote a novel ''Pontius Pilate'' (1936), in which Pilate acquits Jesus.{{sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=133}}\n\nPilate features prominently in Russian author [[Mikhail Bulgakov]]'s novel ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'', which was written in the 1930s but only published in 1966, twenty six years after the author's death.{{sfn|Langenhorst|1995|p=90}} Henry I. MacAdam describes it as \"the 'cult classic' of Pilate-related fiction.\"{{sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=133}} The work features a novel within the novel about Pontius Pilate and his encounter with Jesus by an author only called the Master. Because of this subject matter, the Master has been attacked for \"Pilatism\" by the Soviet literary establishment. Five chapters of the novel are featured as chapters of ''The Master and Margarita''. In them, Pilate is portrayed as wishing to save Jesus, being affected by his charisma, but as too cowardly to do so. Russian critics in the 1960s interpreted this Pilate as \"a model of the spineless provincial bureaucrats of Stalinist Russia.\"{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=273}} Pilate becomes obsessed with his guilt for having killed Jesus.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|1992|p=165}} Because he betrayed his desire to follow his morality and free Jesus, Pilate must suffer for eternity.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=xiii}} Pilate's burden of guilt is finally lifted by the Master when he encounters him at the end of Bulgakov's novel.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=371}}\n\nThe majority of literary texts about Pilate come from the time after the Second World War, a fact which Alexander Demandt suggests shows a cultural dissatisfaction with Pilate having washed his hands of guilt.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=107}} One of Swiss writer [[Friedrich D\u00fcrrenmatt]]'s earliest stories (\"Pilatus,\" 1949) portrays Pilate as aware that he is torturing God in the trial of Jesus.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=108}} Swiss playwright [[Max Frisch]]'s comedy {{lang|de|Die chinesische Mauer|italics=yes}} portrays Pilate as a skeptical intellectual who refuses to take responsibility for the suffering he has caused.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|pp=107\u2013109}} The German Catholic novelist [[Gertrud von Le Fort]]'s {{lang|de|Die Frau des Pilatus|italics=yes}} portrays Pilate's wife as converting to Christianity after attempting to save Jesus and assuming Pilate's guilt for herself; Pilate executes her as well.{{sfn|Demandt|2012|p=108}}\n\nIn 1986, Soviet-Kyrgiz writer [[Chingiz Aitmatov]] published a novel in Russian featuring Pilate titled {{lang|ru|Placha|italics=yes}} (''The Place of the Skull''). The novel centers on an extended dialogue between Pilate and Jesus witnessed in a vision by the narrator Avdii Kallistratov, a former seminarian. Pilate is presented as an materialist pessimist who believes mankind will soon destroy itself, whereas Jesus offers a message of hope.{{sfn|Langenhorst|1995|p=90}} Among other topics, the two anachronistically discuss the meaning of the last judgment and the second coming; Pilate fails to comprehend Jesus's teachings and is complacent as he sends him to his death.{{sfn|Ziolkowski|1992|pp=167\u2013168}}\n\n===Film===\nPilate has been depicted in a number of films, being included in portrayals of Christ's passion already in some of the earliest films produced.{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=278-2280}} In the 1927 silent film ''[[The King of Kings (1927 film)|The King of Kings]]'', Pilate is played by Hungarian-American actor [[Victor Varconi]], who is introduced seated under an enormous 37 feet high [[Aquila (Roman)|Roman eagle]], which Christopher McDonough argues symbolizes \"not power that he possesses but power that possesses him\".{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=283}} During the ''Ecce homo'' scene, the eagle stands in the background between Jesus and Pilate, with a wing above each figure; after hesitantly condemning Jesus, Pilate passes back to the eagle, which is now framed beside him, showing his isolation in his decision and, McDonough suggests, causing the audience to question how well he has served the emperor.{{sfn|McDonough|2009|pp=284-285}}\n\nThe film ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii (1935 film)|The Last Days of Pompeii]]'' (1935) portrays Pilate as \"a representative of the gross materialism of the Roman empire\", with the actor [[Basil Rathbone]] giving him long fingers and a long nose.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=38\u201339}} Following the Second World War, Pilate and the Romans often take on a villainous role in American film.{{sfn|Winkler|1998|p=167}} The 1953 film ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]'' portrays Pilate as completely covered with gold and rings as a sign of Roman decadence.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} The 1959 film ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' shows Pilate presiding over a chariot race, in a scene that Ann Wroe says \"seemed closely modeled on the Hitler footage of the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]],\" with Pilate bored and sneering.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=186}} Martin Winkler, however, argues that ''Ben-Hur'' provides a more nuanced and less condemnatory portrayal of Pilate and the Roman Empire than most American films of the period.{{sfn|Winkler|1998|p=192}}\n\n[[File:Ponzio Pilato 1962 Marais.png|thumb|Jean Marais as Pontius Pilate in {{lang|it|Ponzio Pilato|italics=yes}} (1962)]]\nOnly one film has been made entirely in Pilate's perspective, the 1962 French-Italian ''[[Ponzio Pilato]]'', where Pilate was played by [[Jean Marais]].{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} In the 1973 film [[Jesus Christ Superstar (film)|''Jesus Christ Superstar'']], the trial of Jesus takes place in the ruins of a Roman theater, suggesting the collapse of Roman authority and \"the collapse of all authority, political or otherwise\".{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=287}} The Pilate in the film, played by [[Barry Dennen]], expands on [[John 18:38]] to question Jesus on the truth and appears, in McDonough's view, as \"an anxious representative of [...] moral relativism\".{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=287}} Speaking of Dennen's portrayal in the trial scene, McDonough describes him as a \"cornered animal.\"{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=290}} Wroe argues that later Pilates took on a sort of effeminancy,{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} illustrated by the Pilate in ''[[Monty Python's Life of Brian]]'', where Pilate lisps and mispronounces his r's as w's. In [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ (film)|The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' (1988), Pilate is played by [[David Bowie]], who appears as \"gaunt and eerily hermaphrodite.\"{{sfn|Wroe|1999|p=39}} Bowie's Pilate speaks with a British accent, contrasting with the American accent of Jesus ([[Willem Dafoe]]).{{sfn|McDonough|2009|pp=290-291}} The trial takes place in Pilate's private stables, implying that Pilate does not think the judgment of Jesus very important, and no attempt is made to take any responsibility from Pilate for Jesus's death, which he orders without any qualms.{{sfn|McDonough|2009|pp=291-293}}\n\n[[Mel Gibson]]'s 2004 film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' portrays Pilate, played by [[Hristo Shopov]], as a sympathetic, noble-minded character,{{sfn|Grace|2004|p=16}} fearful that the Jewish priest Caiaphas will start an uprising if he does not give in to his demands. He expresses disgust at the Jewish authorities' treatment of Jesus when Jesus is brought before him and offers Jesus a drink of water.{{sfn|Grace|2004|p=16}} McDonough argues that \"Shopov gives US a very subtle Pilate, one who manages to appear alarmed though not panicked before the crowd, but who betrays far greater misgivings in private conversation with his wife.\"{{sfn|McDonough|2009|p=295}}\n\n==Legacy==\nPontius Pilate is mentioned as having been involved in the crucifixion in both the [[Nicene Creed]] and the [[Apostles Creed]]. The Apostles Creed states that Jesus \"suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The Apostles' Creed|url=https://www.cardinalnewman.com.au/images/stories/downloads/The%20Apostles%20Creed.pdf|publisher=Cardinal Newman Catechist Consultants|access-date=15 July 2019|date=2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190302101028/http://cardinalnewman.com.au/images/stories/downloads/The%20Apostles%20Creed.pdf|archive-date=2 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The Nicene Creed states \"For our sake [Jesus] was crucified under Pontius Pilate; he suffered death and was buried.\"<ref>[[s:Nicene Creed (ECUSA Book of Common Prayer)|Nicene Creed in English]]</ref> These creeds are recited weekly by many Christians.{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=1}} Pilate is the only person besides Jesus and [[Mary, Mother of Jesus|Mary]] mentioned by name in the creeds.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=391}} The mention of Pilate in the creeds serves to mark the passion as a historical event.{{sfn|Bayes|2010|p=78}}\n\nHe is venerated as a saint by the [[Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church|Ethiopian Church]] with a feast day on June 19,{{sfn|Gr\u00fcll|2010|p=167}}{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=11}} and by the [[Coptic Church]], with a feast day of June 25.{{sfn|Hourihane|2009|p=4}}\n\nPilate's washing his hands of responsibility for Jesus's death in Matthew 27:24 is a commonly encountered image in the popular imagination,{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=xi}} and is the origin of the English phrase [[Wiktionary:wash one's hands of|\"to wash one's hands of (the matter)\"]], meaning to refuse further involvement with or responsibility for something.{{sfn|Martin|2019}} Parts of the dialogue attributed to Pilate in the [[Gospel of John]] have become particularly famous sayings, especially quoted in the Latin version of the [[Vulgate]].{{Sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=139}} These include {{bibleverse|John|18:35|KJV}} ({{Lang|la|numquid ego Iudaeus sum?|italics=yes}} \"Am I a Jew?\"), [[John 18:38]] ({{Lang|la|Quid est veritas?|italics=yes}}; \"what is truth?\"), [[John 19#Verse 5|John 19:5]] ({{Lang|la|[[Ecce homo]]|italics=yes}}, \"Behold the man!\"), {{bibleverse|John|19:14|KJV}} ({{lang|la|Ecce rex vester|italics=yes}}, \"Behold your king!\"), and {{bibleverse|John|19:22|KJV}} ({{lang|la|[[Quod scripsi, scripsi]]|italics=yes}}, \"What I have written, I have written\").{{Sfn|MacAdam|2017|p=139}}\n\nThe Gospels' deflection of responsibility for Jesus's crucifixion from Pilate to the Jews has been blamed for fomenting [[antisemitism]] from the Middle Ages through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.{{sfn|Wroe|1999|pp=331\u2013332}}\n\n===Scholarly assessments===\nThe main ancient sources on Pilate offer very different views on his governorship and personality. Philo is hostile, Josephus mostly neutral, and the Gospels \"comparatively friendly.\"{{sfn|McGing|1991|pp=415\u2013416}} This, combined with the general lack of information on Pilate's long time in office, has resulted in a wide range of assessments by modern scholars.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=12\u201319}}\n\nOn the basis of the many offenses that Pilate caused to the Judaean populace, some scholars find Pilate to have been a particularly bad governor. M. P. Charlesworth argues that Pilate was \"a man whose character and capacity fell below those of the ordinary provincial official [...] in ten years he had piled blunder on blunder in his scorn for and misunderstanding of the people he was sent to rule.\"{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=363}} However, Paul Maier argues that Pilate's long term as governor of Judaea indicates he must have been a reasonably competent administrator,{{sfn|Maier|1971|p=365}} while Henry MacAdam argues that \"[a]mong the Judaean governors prior to the Jewish War, Pilate must be ranked as more capable than most.\"{{sfn|MacAdam|2001|p=77}} Other scholars have argued that Pilate was simply culturally insensitive in his interactions with the Jews and in this way a typical Roman official.{{sfn|Carter|2003|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nBeginning with E. Stauffer in 1948, scholars have argued, on the basis of his possible appointment by [[Sejanus]], that Pilate's offenses against the Jews were directed by Sejanus out of hatred of the Jews and a desire to destroy their nation, a theory supported by the pagan imagery on Pilate's coins.{{sfn|Maier|1968|pp=9\u201310}} According to this theory, following Sejanus's execution in 31 CE and Tiberius's purges of his supporters, Pilate, fearful of being removed himself, became far more cautious, explaining his apparently weak and vaciliating attitude at the trial of Jesus.{{sfn|Maier|1968|pp=10\u201311}} Helen Bond argues that \"[g]iven the history of pagan designs throughout Judaean coinage, particularly from Herod and Gratus, Pilate's coins do not seem to be deliberately offensive,\"{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=21}} and that the coins offer little evidence of any connection between Pilate and Sejanus.{{sfn|Bond|1998|p=22}} Carter notes this theory arose in the context of the aftermath of the [[Holocaust]], that the evidence that Sejanus was anti-Semitic depends entirely on Philo, and that \"[m]ost scholars have not been convinced that it is an accurate or a fair picture of Pilate.\"{{sfn|Carter|2003|p=4}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of biblical figures identified in extra-biblical sources]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite journal| last1=Amora-Stark |first1=Shua |display-authors=etal |title= An Inscribed Copper-Alloy Finger Ring from Herodium Depicting a Krater |journal=Israel Exploration Journal |volume= 68 |issue=2 |year=2018 |pages=208\u2013220|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329307909 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |editor-last=Ash |editor-first=Rhiannon |title=Tacitus Annals.

The Buroks formed a major part of the tribe. The Chutias who were thought to be healthy and strong was termed as Burok and took up the administrative and military roles in the Chutia kingdom. All Chutia royalty belonged to the Burok clan. Even the Motok king [[Sarbananada Singha|Sarbananda Singha]] belonged to the Burok Chutia clan.<ref>[http://atributetosankaradeva.org/mayamara.pdf Nath, D. ''The Mataks and their Revolt'', p.13]</ref> Surnames like Bora, Borha, Borua have their origins in the Chutia kingdom and are related to Bara/Bodo/Buruk only. There is mention of Manik Chandra Barua, Dhela Bora, Borhuloi Barua as commanders of Chutia army. Later the Ahoms adopted the title after the downfall of Chutias.<ref>Dr. Swarnalata Baruah(2004), ''Chutiya Jaatir Buranji'', Page 145, Surnames like Bora, Saikia, Kataki, Tamuli,etc. were found in Chutia kingdom. It is clearly stated in the Deodhai Buranji that when Ahom king Suhungmung attacked the Chutia kingdom on the banks of Dihing river, the Chutia army was led by one Manik Chandra Baruah. The surname \"Neog\" was probably derived from the Chutia \"Nayak\" whose duty was the same. Deori folklores also mention the myths behind the creation of each of these titles. For instance, \"Bora\" was said to be derived from the \"Buruk\" clan and acted either as a military official or a temple guard...</ref><ref>Dr. Swarnalata Baruah(2004), ''Chutiya Jaatir Buranji'', Page 129, The Chutia army was led by Borhuloi Borua and Dhela Bora.</ref>\n\n===Moran-Bodousa===\nThe Morans called their leader/chief as Bodousa (great son) where 'sa' means child or son in Moran language . The origin folklore of the Morans is same as that of Boruk Chutias which indicate that they were a faction which split at an early time.<ref>[http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/69486/9/09_chapter%202.pdf Moran chief Badaucha]</ref> They were also known as Habungiya or earth-folk or autochthones which means son of soil<ref>{{Harvcol|Endle|1911|p=88}}</ref>\n\n===Deori-Burok===\nThe Deoris (who were priests by profession) also have the Burok clan among them.\n\n===Twipuri-Borok===\nThe Tripuris often call themselves Boroks and their language is called Kokborok.<ref>[http://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/bitstream/10603/69486/9/09_chapter%202.pdf Tripuris are called Boroks]</ref>\n\n===Reang-Bru===\nThe Reang people of Assam, Tripura and Mizoram call themselves Bru which means \"great men\".\n\n==Origins==\nThey were first classified by S. Endle as the Kacharis. They are considered to have reached the Brahmaputra valley via Tibet and South China, and settled in the foothills of the eastern Himalayan range which includes the whole of Assam, Tripura, North Bengal and parts of Bangladesh. That the Bodo-Kacharis were early colonizers of the river valleys is taken from the fact that most of the rivers in the Brahmaputra valley today carry Tibeto-Burman names \u2013 Dibang, Dihang, Dikhou, Dihing, etc. \u2013 where Di- means water in [[Bodo language|Bodo]]/Deori-Chutia, Moran, Dimasa, other dialects Bodo languages. (\"Ti\" in Lalung (Tiwa) language, \"Twi\" in Tripuri language, \"Dwi\" in 8th scheduled Boro & \"Chi\" in Garo). There are many places name given by Bodo-Kachari people are Dispur, Dinajpur, Dimapur, Dibrugarh, Hajo, Mongoldoi, Diphu etc.\n\n==Groups==\nBased on an 1881 census, there were 19 groups within the Kachari\nclassification:\n#[[Boro Tribe|Boro]]\n#[[Chutia people|Chutiya]]\n#[[Dhimal]]\n#[[Garo people|Garo]]\n#[[Hajong people|Hajong]]\n#[[Koch people|Koch]]\n#[[Lalung]] (Tiwa)\n# Mech\n#\tMoran\n#       Modahi\n#\tPhulgaria\n#[[Deuri people|Deuri]]\n#\t[[Rabha tribe|Rabha]]\n#\t[[Sonowal Kachari]]\n#\t[[Sarania kachari]]\n#\tSolaimiya\n#       [[Thengal Kachari]]\n#\t[[Tripuri people|Tiprasa]] \u2013 [[Bru Tribe |Bru]]([[Reang]]), Jamatia, Uchai, Noatia(Tripura), Debbarma, Murasing, Roaza, etc.\n\nSome of the groups, such as Moran and Sarania consider themselves as lower-caste Hindus. Other groups, such as the Garo, Rabha, Lalung (Tiwa) and Hajong having been isolated from the parental stock, have established separate identities. With the exception of the Garo, which is still a matrilineal society, the other groups have given up the rules of matrilineal society.\n\nThe Mech in Western Assam, the Boro in central Assam; the Dimasa in Dima Hasao district formerly North Cachar Hills, Nagaon district, Cachar district & Nagaland state and the Sonowal and Thengal in the eastern part of the Brahmaputra now represents the Kachari.\n\n==History==\nThe [[History of Tripura|Tripuri]], [[Chutiya Kingdom|Chutiya]], [[Koch dynasty|Koch-Mech]] and [[Kachari Kingdom|Kachari]] had established powerful kingdoms in the past. The Tripuri kings had even defeated the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s and the [[Burma|Burmese]] kingdoms in the past. Today, the Bodos, the Tripuris, and the Garos have established a strong political and ethnic identity and are developing their language and literature. The Sonowal Kachari is also a branch of greater Kachari. They live in the districts of Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Dhemaji, Sivasagar, Lakhimpur, Golaghat and Jorhat.\n\n===State formations of the Bodo-Kachari people===\nBodo-Kachari unitedly lived in [[Kamarupa|Kamarupa kingdom]] but Power struggle separated into many parts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://coochbehar.nic.in/HTMfiles/royal_history.html|title=Royal history of Cooch

The Buroks formed a major part of the tribe. The Chutias who were thought to be healthy and strong was termed as Burok and took up the administrative and military roles in the Chutia kingdom. All Chutia royalty belonged to the Burok clan. Even the Motok king [[Sarbananada Singha|Sarbananda Singha]] belonged to the Burok Chutia clan.<ref>[http://atributetosankaradeva.org/mayamara.pdf Nath, D. ''The Mataks and their Revolt'', p.13]</ref> Surnames like Bora, Borha, Borua have their origins in the Chutia kingdom and are related to Bara/Bodo/Buruk only. There is mention of Manik Chandra Barua, Dhela Bora, Borhuloi Barua as commanders of Chutia army. Later the Ahoms adopted the title after the downfall of Chutias.<ref>Dr. Swarnalata Baruah(2004), ''Chutiya Jaatir Buranji'', Page 145, Surnames like Bora, Saikia, Kataki, Tamuli,etc. were found in Chutia kingdom. It is clearly stated in the Deodhai Buranji that when Ahom king Suhungmung attacked the Chutia kingdom on the banks of Dihing river, the Chutia army was led by one Manik Chandra Baruah. The surname \"Neog\" was probably derived from the Chutia \"Nayak\" whose duty was the same. Deori folklores also mention the myths behind the creation of each of these titles. For instance, \"Bora\" was said to be derived from the \"Buruk\" clan and acted either as a military official or a temple guard...</ref><ref>Dr. Swarnalata Baruah(2004), ''Chutiya Jaatir Buranji'', Page 129, The Chutia army was led by Borhuloi Borua and Dhela Bora.</ref>\n\n===Moran-Bodousa===\nThe Morans called their leader/chief as Bodousa (great son) where 'sa' means child or son in Moran language .

Endle as the Kacharis. They are considered to have reached the Brahmaputra valley via Tibet and South China, and settled in the foothills of the eastern Himalayan range which includes the whole of Assam, Tripura, North Bengal and parts of Bangladesh. That the Bodo-Kacharis were early colonizers of the river valleys is taken from the fact that most of the rivers in the Brahmaputra valley today carry Tibeto-Burman names \u2014 Dibang, Dihang, Dikhou, Dihing, etc. \u2014 where Di- means water in [[Bodo language|Bodo]]/Deori-Chutia, Moran, Dimasa, other dialects Bodo languages. (\"Ti\" in Lalung (Tiwa) language, \"Twi\" in Tripuri language, \"Dwi\" in 8th scheduled Boro & \"Chi\" in Garo). There are many places name given by Bodo-Kachari people are Dispur, Dinajpur, Dimapur, Dibrugarh, Hajo, Mongoldoi, Diphu etc.\n\n==Groups==\nBased on an 1881 census, there were 19 groups within the Kachari\nclassification:\n#[[Boro Tribe|Boro]]\n#[[Chutia people|Chutiya]]\n#[[Dhimal]]\n#[[Garo people|Garo]]\n#[[Hajong people|Hajong]]\n#[[Koch people|Koch]]\n#[[Lalung]] (Tiwa)\n# Mech\n#\tMoran\n#       Modahi\n#\tPhulgaria\n#[[Deuri people|Deuri]]\n#\t[[Rabha tribe|Rabha]]\n#\t[[Sonowal Kachari]]\n#\t[[Sarania kachari|Sarania Kachari]]\n#\tSolaimiya\n#       [[Thengal Kachari]]\n#\t[[Tripuri people|Tiprasa]] \u2013 [[Bru Tribe |Bru]]([[Reang]]), Jamatia, Uchai, Noatia(Tripura), Debbarma, Murasing, Roaza, etc.\n\nSome of the groups, such as Moran and Sarania consider themselves as lower-caste Hindus. Other groups, such as the Garo, Rabha, Lalung (Tiwa) and Hajong having been isolated from the parental stock, have established separate identities. With the exception of the Garo, which is still a matrilineal society, the other groups have given up the rules of matrilineal society.\n\nThe Mech in Western Assam, the Boro in central Assam; the Dimasa in Dima Hasao district formerly North Cachar Hills, Nagaon district, Cachar district & Nagaland state and the Sonowal and Thengal in the eastern part of the Brahmaputra now represents the Kachari.\n\n==History==\nThe [[History of Tripura|Tripuri]], [[Chutiya Kingdom|Chutiya]], [[Koch dynasty|Koch-Mech]] and [[Kachari Kingdom|Kachari]] had established powerful kingdoms in the past. The Tripuri kings had even defeated the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s and the [[Burma|Burmese]] kingdoms in the past. Today, the Bodos, the Tripuris, and the Garos have established a strong political and ethnic identity and are developing their language and literature. The Sonowal Kachari is also a branch of greater Kachari. They live in the districts of Dibrugarh, Tinsukia, Dhemaji, Sivasagar, Lakhimpur, Golaghat and Jorhat.\n\n===State formations of the Bodo-Kachari people===\nBodo-Kachari unitedly lived in [[Kamarupa|Kamarupa kingdom]] but Power struggle separated into many parts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://coochbehar.nic.in/HTMfiles/royal_history.html|title=Royal history of Cooch Behar|website=coochbehar.nic.in|access-date=2019-03-25}}</ref> {{Further|Koch dynasty|Chutiya Kingdom|Dimasa kingdom|Twipra Kingdom}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin|}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Jacquesson|first=Fran\u00e7ois|date=2008|title=Discovering Boro-Garo|url=http://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/collections/journals/ebhr/pdf/EBHR_32_02.pdf|journal=History of an Analytical and Descriptive Linguistic Category|volume=|pages=|via=}}\n* {{Citation |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=lC6FCZ9VcaAC&pg=PA73|last= Sharma |first=Chandan Kumar |contribution=Oral discourse and Bodo identity construction|editor-last=Muthukumaraswamy |editor-first=M.D. |title= Folklore as Discourse |pages=73\u201394|publisher=National folklore support centre|year=2006|isbn= 9788190148160 }}\n* {{cite thesis|ref=harv|type=Ph.D.|first=Uttam|last=Bathari|title=Memory History and polity a study of dimasa identity in colonial past and post colonial present|publisher=Gauhati University|year=2014|degree=|doi=|hdl=10603/115353}}\n* {{cite thesis|ref=harv|type=Ph.D.|first=Nirjay Kumar|last=Brahma|title=\tSocio political institutions in bodo society|publisher=Gauhati University|year=2008|degree=|doi=|hdl=10603/66535}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Burling|first=Robbins|pages=|chapter=The Tibeto-Burman Languages of Northeastern India|editor-last=LaPolla|editor-first=Randy J.|location=|author-link=Randy LaPolla|title=Sino-Tibetan languages|year=2013|isbn=|publisher=Routledge|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kYJFPZ34ihMC&lpg=PA3&pg=PT146#v=onepage&q&f=false}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Choudhury|first=Sujit|authorlink=|title=The Bodos: Emergence and Assertion of an ethnic minority|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K2YMAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=|year=2007|publisher=Indian Institute of Advanced Study|location=Shimla|isbn=9788179860540|page=|pages=}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Endle|first=Sidney|authorlink=|title=The Kacharis|url=https://archive.org/details/kacharis009491mbp|accessdate=20 February 2013|year=1911|publisher=Macmillan and Co.|location=London|isbn=|page=|pages=}}\n* {{cite journal|ref=harv|last1=Basu|first1=Analabha|year=2003|title=Ethnic India: A Genomic View, With Special Reference to Peopling and Structure|journal=Genome Research|volume=13|issue=10|pages=2277\u20132290|doi=10.1101/gr.1413403|pmid=14525929|pmc=403703}}\n* {{cite journal|ref=harv|last1=George|first1=Sudhir Jacob|year=1994|title=The Bodo Movement in Assam: Unrest to Accord|url=|journal=Asian Survey|publisher=University of California Press|pages=878\u2013892|volume=34|number=10|doi=10.1525/as.1994.34.10.00p0431w}}\n*{{Linguistic Survey of India|3|2}}\n* {{cite conference|ref=harv|via=|last=Mosahary|first=R N|authorlink=|title=The Boros : Their Origin, Migration and Settlement in Assam|book-title=Proceedings of Northeast India History Association|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190701071648/http://dspace.nehu.ac.in/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1/11330/The%20boros%20(RN%20Mosahary).pdf|conference=|accessdate=2019-06-30|year=1983|publisher=Northeast India History Association|location=Barapani|isbn=|volume=|page=|pages=42\u201370}}\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last=Narjinari|first=Hira Charan|authorlink=|title=Reassertiveness of the Great Bodos|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A1RuAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=|year=2000|publisher=|location=|isbn=|page=|pages=}}\n* {{cite book|pages=|ref=eighth|last=GoI|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|title=Eighth Scheduled Indian Languages|url=http://mha.nic.in/hindi/sites/upload_files/mhahindi/files/pdf/Eighth_Schedule.pdf|access-date=13 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305010536/http://mha.nic.in/hindi/sites/upload_files/mhahindi/files/pdf/Eighth_Schedule.pdf#|archive-date=5 March 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}\n*{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=4ba1AAAAIAAJ|title=The place of Assam in the history and civilisation of India |last=Chatterjee |first=S.K.|publisher= Guwahati University |year=1970|isbn=|location=|pages=}}\n{{refend}}\n{{Scheduled tribes of India}}\n{{Hill tribes of Northeast India}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Kachari}}\n[[Category:Social groups of Assam]]\n[[Category:Tribes of Assam]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in Northeast India]]\n[[Category:Scheduled Tribes of Meghalaya]]\n[[Category:Scheduled Tribes of Assam]]\n[[Category:Scheduled Tribes of Nagaland]]\n[[Category:Ethnic groups in South Asia]]\n", "name_user": "Fylindfotberserk", "label": "safe", "comment": "Generalformattingbyscript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodo-Kachari_peoples"}
