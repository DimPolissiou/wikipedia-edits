It derived its name from the [[District of Columbia]], where it was headquartered.<ref name=\"IEEE Easton\">{{cite web|title=Edward Easton|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Edward_Easton |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=January 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bilton|first=Lynn|title=Hail, Columbia: A fresh book at last gives Edward Easton and his Graphophone company their due|url=http://www.intertique.com/Hail%20Columbia.htm|accessdate=January 22, 2014|year=1998}}</ref> At first it had a local monopoly on sales and service of Edison [[phonograph]]s and [[phonograph cylinder]]s in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Delaware. As was the custom of some of the regional phonograph companies, Columbia produced many commercial cylinder recordings of its own, and its catalogue of musical records in 1891 was 10 pages.\n\nColumbia's ties to Edison and the [[North American Phonograph Company]] were severed in 1894 with the [[North American Phonograph Company]]'s breakup. Thereafter it sold only records and phonographs of its own manufacture. In 1902, Columbia introduced the \"XP\" record, a molded brown wax record, to use up old stock. Columbia introduced black wax records in 1903.

For a decade, Columbia competed with both the [[Edison Phonograph Company]] cylinders and the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] disc records as one of the top three names in American recorded sound.\n\nIn order to add prestige to its early catalog of artists, Columbia contracted a number of [[New York Metropolitan Opera]] stars to make recordings (from 1903 onward). These stars included [[Marcella Sembrich]], [[Lillian Nordica]], [[Antonio Scotti]] and [[Edouard de Reszke]], but the technical standard of their recordings was not considered to be as high as the results achieved with classical singers during the pre\u2013World War I period by Victor, Edison, England's [[His Master's Voice]] (The [[Gramophone Company]] Ltd.) or Italy's [[Fonotipia Records]]. After an abortive attempt in 1904 to manufacture discs with the recording grooves stamped into both sides of each disc\u2014not just one\u2014in 1908 Columbia commenced successful mass production of what they called their \"Double-Faced\" discs, the 10-inch variety initially selling for 65 cents apiece. The firm also introduced the internal-horn \"'''[[Graphophone|Grafonola]]'''\" to compete with the extremely popular \"[[Victrola]]\" sold by the rival Victor Talking Machine Company.\n\nDuring this era, Columbia used the \"Magic Notes\" logo\u2014a pair of sixteenth notes (semiquavers) in a circle\u2014both in the United States and overseas (where this particular logo would never substantially change).\n\n[[File:Columbia1116D.jpg|left|thumb|The American label of an electrically recorded Columbia disc by [[Art Gillham]] from the mid-twenties]]\n\nColumbia stopped recording and manufacturing wax cylinder records in 1908, after arranging to issue celluloid cylinder records made by the [[Indestructible Record Company]] of [[Albany, New York]], as \"Columbia Indestructible Records\". In July 1912, Columbia decided to concentrate exclusively on disc records and stopped manufacturing cylinder phonographs, although they continued selling Indestructible's cylinders under the Columbia name for a year or two more.\n\nColumbia was split into two companies, one to make records and one to make players. Columbia Phonograph was moved to Connecticut, and Ed Easton went with it. Eventually it was renamed the [[Dictaphone|Dictaphone Corporation]].<ref name=\"IEEE Easton\"/>\n\n[[File:Col4951A.jpg|right|thumb|The British label of an electrically recorded Columbia disc by [[Paul Whiteman]]]]\n\nIn late 1922, Columbia went into receivership.<ref name=\"New Grove\">{{cite book|last1=Rye|first1=Howard |last2=Kernfeld |first2=Barry|editor1-last=Kernfeld|editor1-first=Barry|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz|date=2002|publisher=Grove's Dictionaries Inc.|location=New York|isbn=1-56159-284-6|page=172|volume=1|edition=2nd}}</ref> The company was bought by its [[Columbia Graphophone Company|English subsidiary, the Columbia Graphophone Company]] in 1925 and the label, record numbering system, and recording process changed. On February 25, 1925, Columbia began recording with the electric recording process licensed from [[Western Electric]]. \"Viva-tonal\" records set a benchmark in tone and clarity unequaled on commercial discs during the 78-rpm era. The first electrical recordings were made by [[Art Gillham]], the \"Whispering Pianist\". In a secret agreement with Victor, electrical technology was kept secret to avoid hurting sales of acoustic records.\n\nIn 1926, Columbia acquired [[Okeh Records]] and its growing stable of jazz and blues artists, including [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]]. Columbia had already built a catalog of blues and jazz artists, including [[Bessie Smith]] in their 14000-D Race series. Columbia also had a successful \"Hillbilly\" series (15000-D). In 1928, [[Paul Whiteman]], the nation's most popular orchestra leader, left Victor to record for Columbia. During the same year, Columbia executive [[Frank Buckley Walker]] pioneered some of the first country music or \"hillbilly\" genre recordings with the [[Johnson City sessions]] in Tennessee, including artists such as [[Clarence Horton Greene]] and [[Charlie Bowman|\"Fiddlin'\" Charlie Bowman]]. He followed that with a return to Tennessee the next year, as well as recording sessions in other cities of the South.\n\nIn 1929 [[Ben Selvin]] became house bandleader and A. & R. director. Other favorites in the Viva-tonal era included [[Ruth Etting]], Paul Whiteman, [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Ipana Troubadours]] (a Sam Lanin group), and [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]]. Columbia used acoustic recording for \"budget label\" pop product well into 1929 on the labels Harmony, Velvet Tone (both general purpose labels), and [[Diva Records|Diva]] (sold exclusively at [[W.T. Grant]] stores). When Edison Records folded, Columbia was the oldest surviving record label.\n\n===Columbia ownership separation (1931\u20131936)===\nIn 1931, the British Columbia Graphophone Company (itself originally a subsidiary of American Columbia Records, then to become independent, actually went on to purchase its former parent, American Columbia, in late 1929) merged with the [[Gramophone Company]] to form Electric & Musical Industries Ltd. ([[EMI]]). EMI was forced to sell its American Columbia operations (because of anti-trust concerns) and the Grigsby-Grunow Company, makers of the Majestic Radio were the purchaser. But Majestic soon fell on hard times. An abortive attempt in 1932 (around the same time that Victor was experimenting with its 33{{fraction|1|3}} \"program transcriptions\") was the \"Longer Playing Record\", a finer-grooved 10\" 78 with 4:30 to 5:00 playing time per side. Columbia issued about eight of these (in the 18000-D series), as well as a short-lived series of double-grooved \"Longer Playing Record\"s on its Clarion Records, Harmony and Velvet Tone labels. All of these experiments (and indeed the Clarion, Harmony and Velvet Tone labels) were discontinued by mid-1932.\n\nA longer-lived marketing ploy was the Columbia \"Royal Blue Record,\" a brilliant blue laminated product with matching label. Royal Blue issues, made from late 1932 through 1935, are particularly popular with collectors for their rarity and musical interest. The Columbia plant in Oakland, California, did Columbia's pressings for sale west of the Rockies and continued using the Royal Blue material for these until about mid-1936.\n\nWith the Great Depression's tightened economic stranglehold on the country, in a day when the phonograph itself had become a luxury, nothing slowed Columbia's decline. It was still producing some of the most remarkable records of the day, especially on sessions produced by [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] and financed by EMI for overseas release. Grigsby-Grunow went under in 1934 and was forced to sell Columbia for a mere $70,000 to the [[American Record Corporation]] (ARC).<ref name=\"Hoffman2004\">{{cite book|author=Frank Hoffman|title=Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xV6tghvO0oMC&pg=PA212|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=August 21, 2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-203-48427-2|page=212}}</ref> This combine already included [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] as its premium label so Columbia was relegated to slower sellers such as the Hawaiian music of [[Andy Iona]], the [[Irving Mills]] stable of artists and songs, and the still unknown [[Benny Goodman]]. By late 1936, pop releases were discontinued, leaving the label essentially defunct.\n\nIn 1935, Herbert M. Greenspon, an 18-year-old shipping clerk, led a committee to organize the first trade union shop at the main manufacturing factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Elected as president of the Congress of Industrial Unions (CIO) local, Greenspon negotiated the first contract between factory workers and Columbia management. In a career with Columbia that lasted 30 years, Greenspon retired after achieving the position of executive vice president of the company. The Columbia Records factory in Bridgeport (which closed in 1964)<ref>{{cite journal|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard (Columbia Prepares to Close Plant)|journal=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA4|accessdate=June 24, 2013|date=September 7, 1963|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=4\u2013|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> was converted into an apartment building called Columbia Towers.<ref>[http://columbiatowers.com/Default.htm Columbia Towers Bridgeport CT].

Retrieved on July 16, 2013.</ref>\n\nAs [[southern gospel]] developed, Columbia had astutely sought to record the artists associated with the emerging genre; for example, Columbia was the only company to record [[Charles Davis Tillman]]. Most fortuitously for Columbia in its Depression Era financial woes, in 1936 the company entered into an exclusive recording contract with the [[Chuck Wagon Gang]], a hugely successful relationship which continued into the 1970s. A signature group of southern gospel, the Chuck Wagon Gang became Columbia's bestsellers with at least 37 million records,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |title=Solid Gospel series brings Chuck Wagon Gang to Renaissance Center. |publisher= |accessdate=November 8, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810135439/http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |archivedate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> many of them through the aegis of the ''Mull Singing Convention of the Air'' sponsored on radio (and later television) by southern gospel broadcaster [[J. Bazzel Mull]] (1914\u20132006).\n\nAnother event in this period that would prove to be of importance to Columbia was the 1937 hiring of talent scout, music writer, producer, and impresario John Hammond. Alongside his significance as a discoverer, promoter, and producer of jazz, blues, and folk artists during the [[swing music]] era, Hammond had already been of great help to Columbia in 1932\u201333. Through his involvement in the UK music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Hammond had arranged for the struggling US Columbia label to provide recordings for the UK Columbia label, mostly using the specially created Columbia W-265000 matrix series. Hammond recorded [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Benny Carter]], [[Joe Venuti]], [[Roger Wolfe Kahn]] and other jazz performers during a time when the economy was bad enough that many of them would not have had the opportunity to enter a studio and play real jazz (a handful of these in this special series were issued in the US). Hammond's work for Columbia was interrupted by his service during World War II, and he had less involvement with the music scene during the [[bebop]] era, but when he returned to work as a talent scout for Columbia in the 1950s, his career proved to be of incalculable historical and cultural importance - the list of superstar artists he would discover and sign to Columbia over the course of his career included [[Charlie Christian]], [[Count Basie]], [[Teddy Wilson]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and in the early 1960s Hammond would also exert an enormous cultural effect on the emerging rock music scene thanks to his championing of reissue LPs of the music of blues artists [[Robert Johnson]] and [[Bessie Smith]].\n\n===CBS takes over (1938\u20131947)===\n[[File:notesandmike.jpg|thumbnail|125px|left|Columbia \"notes and mic\" logo]]\n\nIn 1938 ARC, including the Columbia label in the US, was bought by [[William S.

The Royal Blue labels now disappeared in favor of a deep red, which caused [[RCA Victor]] to claim infringement on its [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] trademark (RCA lost the case). The blue Columbia label was kept for its [[European classical music|classical music]] [[Columbia Masterworks Records]] line until it was later changed to a green label before switching to a gray label in the late 1950s, and then to the bronze that is familiar to owners of its classical and Broadway albums. Columbia Phonograph Company of Canada did not survive the [[Great Depression]], so CBS made a distribution deal with [[Sparton Records]] in 1939 to release Columbia records in Canada under the Columbia name.\n\nDuring the 1940s Columbia had a contract with [[Frank Sinatra]]. Sinatra helped boost Columbia in revenue. Sinatra recorded over 200 songs with Columbia which include his most popular songs from his early years. Other popular artists on Columbia included [[Benny Goodman]] (signed from RCA Victor), [[Count Basie]], [[Jimmie Lunceford]] (both signed from Decca), [[Eddy Duchin]], [[Ray Noble]] (both moved to Columbia from Brunswick), [[Kate Smith]], [[Mildred Bailey]], and [[Will Bradley]].\n\nIn 1947, the company was renamed Columbia Records Inc.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2002655160/ | title=Columbia Records paperwork collection}}</ref> and founded its Mexican record company, Discos Columbia de Mexico.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=March 16, 1963|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=60|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> 1948 saw the first classical LP [[Mendelssohn Violin Concerto (Nathan Milstein album)|Nathan Milstein's recording of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto]].

Some, like opera tenor (''sic''), Ezio Pinza, would go to Columbia...\"</ref>\n\n===The LP record (1948\u20131959)===\n\nColumbia's president Edward Wallerstein was instrumental in steering Paley towards the ARC purchase. He set his talents to his goal of hearing an entire movement of a symphony on one side of an album. Ward Botsford writing for the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Issue of ''High Fidelity Magazine'' relates, \"He was no inventor\u2014he was simply a man who seized an idea whose time was ripe and begged, ordered, and cajoled a thousand men into bringing into being the now accepted medium of the record business.\" Despite Wallerstein's stormy tenure, in June 1948, Columbia introduced the Long Playing \"microgroove\" [[LP record]] format (sometimes written \"Lp\" in early advertisements), which rotated at 33\u2153 [[revolutions per minute]], to be the standard for the gramophone record for half a century. CBS research director Dr. [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] played a managerial role in the collaborative effort, but Wallerstein credits engineer [[William Savory]] with the technical prowess that brought the long-playing disc to the public.<ref name=\"catalog1949\">{{cite book|title=Columbia Record Catalog 1949|publisher=Columbia Records Inc.|pages=1\u201320}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1940s, Columbia had been experimenting with higher fidelity recordings, as well as longer masters, which paved the way for the successful release of the LPs in 1948. One such record that helped set a new standard for music listeners was the 10\" LP reissue of ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', originally released on March 4, 1946 as an album of four 78 rpm records, which was the first pop album issued in the new LP format. [[Sinatra]] was arguably Columbia's hottest commodity and his artistic vision combined with the direction Columbia were taking the medium of music, both popular and classic, were well suited. ''The Voice of Frank Sinatra'' was also considered to be the first genuine ''[[concept album]]''. Since the term \"LP\" has come to refer to the 12-inch {{frac|33|1|3}} rpm vinyl disk, the first LP is the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto in E minor played by Nathan Milstein with Bruno Walter conducting the New York Philharmonic (then called the Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra of New York), Columbia ML 4001, found in the Columbia Record Catalog for 1949, published in July 1948. The other \"LP's\" listed in the catalog were in the 10 inch format starting with ML 2001 for the light classics, CL 6001 for popular songs and JL 8001 for children's records.<ref name=\"catalog1949\"/> The Library of Congress (Washington DC) now holds the Columbia Records Paperwork Archive which shows the Label order for ML 4001 being written on March 1, 1948. One can infer that Columbia was pressing the first LPs for distribution to their dealers for at least 3 months prior to the introduction of the LP in June 1948.<ref>Library of Congress Columbia Records Paperwork Box 121</ref> The catalog numbering system has had minor changes ever since.\n\nColumbia's LPs were particularly well-suited to classical music's longer pieces, so some of the early albums featured such artists as [[Eugene Ormandy]] and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], [[Bruno Walter]] and the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], and [[Sir Thomas Beecham]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The success of these recordings eventually persuaded [[Capitol Records]] to begin releasing LPs in 1949. Even before the LP record was officially demonstrated, Columbia offered to share the new speed with rival  RCA Victor, who initially rejected it and soon introduced their new competitive 45 RPM record. When it became clear that the LP was the preferred format for classical recordings, RCA Victor announced that the company would begin releasing its own LPs in January, 1950. This was quickly followed by the other major American labels. [[Decca Records]] in the U.K. was the first to release LPs in Europe, beginning in 1949. EMI would not fully adopt the LP format until 1955.\n\nAn \"original cast recording\" of [[Rodgers & Hammerstein]]'s ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' with [[Ezio Pinza]] and [[Mary Martin]] was recorded in 1949. Both conventional metal masters and tape were used in the sessions in New York City. For some reason, the taped version was not used until Sony released it as part of a set of CDs devoted to Columbia's Broadway albums.<ref>Sony liner notes</ref>  Over the years, Columbia joined Decca and RCA Victor in specializing in albums devoted to Broadway musicals with members of the original casts. In the 1950s, Columbia also began releasing LPs drawn from the soundtracks of popular films.\n\nMany album covers put together by Columbia and the other major labels were put together using one piece of cardboard (folded in half) and two paper \"slicks,\" one for the front and one for the back. The front slick bent around the top, bottom, and left sides (the right side is open for the record to be inserted into the cover) and glued the two halves of cardboard together at the top and bottom. The back slick is pasted over the edges of the pasted-on front slick to make it appear that the album cover is one continuous piece.\n\nColumbia discovered that printing two front cover slicks, one for mono and one for stereo, was inefficient and therefore needlessly costly. Starting in the summer of 1959 with some of the albums released in August, they went to the \"paste-over\" front slick, which had the stereo information printed on the top and the mono information printed on the bottom. For stereo issues, they moved the front slick down so the stereo information was showing at the top, and the mono information was bent around the bottom to the back and \"pasted over\" by the back slick. Conversely, for a mono album, they moved the slick up so the mono information showed at the bottom, and the stereo information was pasted over.\n\n===The 1950s===\n[[File:ATeenageLoveAffair.JPG|thumbnail|left|Columbia used this label for its 45 r.p.m. records from 1951 until 1958.]]\n\nIn 1951, Columbia US began issuing records in the 45 rpm format RCA Victor had introduced two years earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubby.net/worldofcubby/RCR/record_history.html |title=Record Collector's Resource: A History of Records |publisher=Cubby.net |date=February 26, 1917 |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref> The same year, Ted Wallerstein retired as Columbia Records chairman;<ref name=\"Inc.1970\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=September 26, 1970|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=10|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> and Columbia US also severed its decades-long distribution arrangement with EMI and signed a distribution deal with [[Philips Records]] to market Columbia recordings outside North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/bbe12043 |title=Mitch Miller And His Orchestra And Chorus - Mitch Miller - Philips - UK |publisher=45cat |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref> EMI continued to distribute Okeh and later Epic label recordings until 1968.

Under new head producer [[George Avakian]], Columbia became the most vital label to the general public's appreciation and understanding (with help from Avakian's prolific and perceptive play-by-play liner notes) of America's indigenous art, releasing the most important LP's by the music's founding father, [[Louis Armstrong]], but also signing to long-term contracts  [[Dave Brubeck]] and [[Miles Davis]], the two modern jazz artists who would in 1959 record albums that remain\u2014more than a half century later\u2014among the best-selling jazz albums by any label\u2014viz., ''[[Time Out (album)|Time Out]]'' by the Brubeck Quartet and, to an even greater extent, ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' by the Davis Sextet, which, in 2003, appeared as number 12 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'s'' list of the \"500 Greatest Albums Of All Time\".<ref>{{cite magazine| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/kind-of-blue-miles-davis-19691231| title = Kind of Blue\n| date = February 9, 2003| accessdate = April 11, 2012| magazine = Rollingstone.com}}</ref> With another producer, [[Teo Macero]], a skilled modernist composer himself, Columbia cemented contracts with jazz giants [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Charles Mingus]], while Macero became a key agent in recording and representing\u2014through attention-grabbing, colorful\u2014albums the protean faces of Miles Davis\u2014from leading exponent of [[cool jazz]] and an explorer of the art of [[modal jazz]] through his sextet's 1958 album ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' to innovator and avatar of the marriage of jazz with rock and electronic sounds\u2014commonly known as [[jazz fusion]].\n\n1954 was the eventful year of Columbia's embracing small-group modern jazz\u2014first, in the signing of the Dave Brubeck Quartet, which resulted in the release of the on-location, best-selling jazz album (up to this time), ''[[Jazz Goes to College]]''. Contemporaneously with Columbia's first release of modern jazz by a small group, which was also the Brubeck Quartet's debut on the label, was a [[Time Magazine]] cover story on the phenomenon of Brubeck's success on college campuses. The humble [[Dave Brubeck]] demurred, saying that the second [[Time Magazine]] cover story on a jazz musician (the first featured [[Louis Armstrong]]'s picture) had been earned by [[Duke Ellington]], not himself. Within two years Ellington's picture would appear on the cover of [[Time Magazine]], following his \"wild\" success at the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival. [[Ellington at Newport]], recorded on Columbia, was also the bandleader-composer-pianist's best-selling album. Moreover, this exclusive trinity of jazz giants featured on [[Time Magazine]] were all Columbia artists. (In the early 1960s Columbia jazz artist [[Thelonious Monk]] would be afforded the same honor.)\n\nColumbia changed distributors in Australia and New Zealand in 1956 when the Australian Record Company picked up distribution of U.S. Columbia product to replace the [[Capitol Records]] product which ARC lost when EMI bought Capitol. As EMI owned the Columbia trademark at that time, the U.S. Columbia material was issued in Australia and New Zealand on the [[Coronet Records|CBS Coronet]] label.\n\nIn the same year, former Columbia A&R manager [[Goddard Lieberson]] was promoted to President of the entire CBS recording division, which included Columbia and Epic, as well as the company's various international divisions and licensees. Under his leadership the corporation's music division soon overtook [[RCA Victor]] as the top recording company in the world, boasting a star-studded roster of artists and an unmatched catalogue of popular, jazz, classical and stage and screen soundtrack titles. Lieberson, who had joined Columbia as an A&R manager in 1938, was noted for both his personal elegance and his dedication to quality, overseeing the release of many hugely successful albums and singles, as well as championing prestige releases that sold relatively poorly, and even some titles that had very limited appeal, such as complete editions of the works of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Anton von Webern]]. One of his first major successes was the original cast soundtrack of ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', which sold over 5 million copies worldwide in 1957, becoming the most successful LP ever released up to that time. Lieberson also convinced long-serving CBS President William S. Paley to become the sole backer of the original Broadway production, a $500,000 investment which subsequently earned the company some $32 million in profits.<ref>Dannen, Frederic, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside The Music Business'', Vintage Books, 1991 ({{ISBN|0099813106}}), pp. 60-61</ref>\n\nIn October 1958, Columbia, in time for the Christmas season, put out a series of \"Greatest Hits\" packages by such artists as Johnny Mathis, Doris Day, Guy Mitchell, Johnnie Ray, [[Jo Stafford]], Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Frankie Laine and [[the Four Lads]]; months later, it put out another Mathis compilation as well as that of [[Marty Robbins]]. Only Mathis' compilations charted, since there were only 25 positions on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'''s album charts]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1200.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 14 (CL 1200-1299) 1958-1959|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> However, the compilations were so successful that they led to Columbia doing such packages on a widespread basis, usually when an artist's career was in decline.\n\n====Stereo====\n\nAlthough Columbia began recording in stereo in 1956, stereo LPs did not begin to be manufactured until 1958. One of Columbia's first stereo releases was an abridged and re-structured performance of [[Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (oratorio)|Messiah]]'' by the [[New York Philharmonic]] and the [[Westminster Choir]] conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]] (recorded on December 31, 1956, on {{1/2}}-inch tape, using an Ampex 300-3 machine). Bernstein combined the Nativity and Resurrection sections, and ended the performance with the death of Christ. As with RCA Victor, most of the early stereo recordings were of classical artists, including the New York Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by [[Bruno Walter]], [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]], and [[Leonard Bernstein]], and the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by [[Eugene Ormandy]], who also recorded an abridged ''Messiah'' for Columbia. Some sessions were made with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, an ensemble drawn from leading New York musicians, which had first made recordings with Sir Thomas Beecham in 1949 in Columbia's famous New York City studios. [[George Szell]] and the [[Cleveland Orchestra]] recorded mostly for Epic. When Epic dropped classical music, the roster and catalogue was moved to [[Columbia Masterworks Records]].\n\nColumbia released its first pop stereo albums in the summer of 1958. All of the first dozen or so were stereo versions of albums already available in mono. It wasn't until September 1958, that Columbia started simultaneous mono/stereo releases. Mono records sold to the general public were subsequently discontinued in 1968. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the introduction of the LP, in 1958 Columbia initiated the \"Adventures in Sound\" series that showcased music from around the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Billboard|date=January 6, 1958|title=Columbia's 1958 Tee-Off Cues Big Product Campaign: Program Set to Tie in with LP Disk's 10th Anniversary Year|url=|journal=Billboard|volume=|page=15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Designed for Hi-Fi Living : The Vinyl LP in Midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=283\u2013297|oclc=958205262}}</ref>\n\nAs far as the catalog numbering system went, there was no correlation between mono and stereo versions for the first few years. Columbia started a new CS 8000 series for pop stereo releases, and figuring the stereo releases as some sort of specialty niche records, didn't bother to link the mono and stereo numbers for two years. Masterworks classical LPs had an MS 6000 series, while showtunes albums on Masterworks were OS 2000. Finally, in 1960, the pop stereo series jumped from 8300 to 8310 to match ''Lambert, Hendricks & Ross Sing [[Duke Ellington|Ellington]]'', the [[Lambert, Hendricks & Ross]] album issued as CL-1510. From that point, the stereo numbers on pop albums were exactly 6800 higher than the mono; stereo classical albums were the mono number plus 600; and showtunes releases were the mono number MINUS 3600. Only the last two digits in the respective catalog series' matched.\n\nPop stereo LPs got into the high 9000s by 1970, when CBS Records revamped and unified its catalog numbering system across all its labels. Masterworks classical albums were in the 7000s, while showtunes stayed in the low 2000s.\n\n===The 1960s===\n====Outing of \"deep groove\"====\nBy the latter half of 1961, Columbia started using pressing plants with newer equipment. The \"deep groove\" pressings were made on older pressing machines, where the groove was an artifact of the metal stamper being affixed to a round center \"block\" to assure the resulting record would be centered. Newer machines used parts with a slightly different geometry, that only left a small \"ledge\" where the deep groove used to be. This changeover did not happen all at once, as different plants replaced machines at different times, leaving the possibility that both deep groove and ledge varieties could be original pressings. The changeover took place starting in late 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1600.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 12 (CL 1600-1699/CS 8400-8499) 1961-1962|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====CBS Records====\n{{see also|CBS Records International}}\n[[File:CBSRecords.png|thumbnail|125px|right|CBS Records logo outside of the United States]]\n\nIn 1961, CBS ended its arrangement with Philips Records and formed its own international organization, CBS Records, in 1962, which released Columbia recordings outside the US and Canada on the CBS label (until 1964 marketed by Philips in Britain).<ref name=\"Inc.1963\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media|title=Billboard|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eQsEAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=March 16, 1963|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eQsEAAAAMBAJ/page/n37 40]|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> The recordings could not be released under the Columbia Records name because EMI operated a separate record label by that name, [[Columbia Graphophone Company]], outside North America. This was the result of legal maneuvers which led to the creation of EMI in the early 1930s.\n\nWhile this happened, starting in late 1961, both the mono and the stereo labels of domestic Columbia releases started carrying a small \"CBS\" at the top of the label. This was not something that changed at a certain date, but rather, pressing plants were told to use up the stock of old (pre-CBS) labels first, resulting in a mixture of labels for some given releases. Some are known with the CBS text on mono albums, and not on stereo of the same album, and vice versa; diggings brought up pressings with the CBS text on one side and not on the other. Many, but certainly not all, of the early numbers with the \"ledge\" variation (i.e., no deep groove), had the small \"CBS\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1700.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 13 (CL 1700-1799/CS 8500-8598) 1961-1962|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> This text would be used on the Columbia labels until June, 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1800.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 14 (CL 1800-1899/CS 8600-8699) 1960-1961|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nColumbia's Mexican unit, Discos Columbia, was renamed Discos CBS.<ref name=\"Inc.1963\"/>\n\nWith the formation of [[CBS Records International]], CBS started establishing its own distribution in the early 1960s, beginning in Australia. In 1960 CBS took over its distributor in Australia and New Zealand, the [[Australian Record Company]] (founded in 1936) including [[Coronet Records]], one of the leading Australian independent recording and distribution companies of the day. The CBS Coronet label was replaced by the CBS label with the 'walking eye' logo in 1963. ARC continued trading under that name until the late 1970s when it formally changed its business name to CBS Australia.\n\n====Mitch Miller on television====\nIn 1961, Columbia's music repertoire was given an enormous boost when [[Mitch Miller]], its A&R manager and bandleader, became the host of the variety series ''[[Sing Along with Mitch]]'' on NBC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128957153|title=Remembering Singing Along With Mitch Miller|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en}}</ref> The show was based on Miller's 'folksy' but appealing 'chorus' style performance of popular standards.

His early folk songs were recorded by many acts and became hits for [[Peter, Paul & Mary]] and [[The Turtles]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/celebritynews/6201418/Peter-Paul-and-Mary-Top-songs-of-all-time.html|title=Peter, Paul and Mary: Top songs of all time|last=Willis|first=Amy|date=2009-09-17|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Some of these cover versions became the foundation of the [[folk rock]] genre. The Byrds achieved their pop breakthrough with a version of Dylan's \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\". In 1965, Dylan's controversial decision to [[Electric Dylan controversy|'go electric']] and work with rock musicians divided his audience but catapulted him to greater commercial success with his 1965 hit single \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\". Following his withdrawal from touring in 1966, Dylan recorded a large group of songs with his backing group [[The Band]] which reached other artists as 'demo recordings'. These resulted in hits by [[Manfred Mann]] (\"[[Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)|The Mighty Quinn]]\") and [[Brian Auger]], [[Julie Driscoll]] & Trinity (\"[[This Wheel's On Fire]]\"). Dylan's late 1960s albums ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'' and ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' became cornerstone recordings of the emergent [[country rock]] genre and influenced The Byrds and [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]].\n\n====Converting mono====\nColumbia's engineering department developed a process for emulating stereo from a mono source. They called this process \"Electronically Rechanneled for Stereo\". In the June 16, 1962, issue of ''Billboard'' magazine (page 5), Columbia announced it would issue \"rechanneled\" versions of greatest hits compilations that had been recorded in mono, including albums by Doris Day, Frankie Laine, Percy Faith, Mitch Miller, Marty Robbins, Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, and Johnny Mathis.\n\nColumbia's rechanneling process involved a slight time delay and some bass-treble separation between channels. RCA Victor and Capitol (\"[[Duophonic]]\") used similar processes, but the relatively large delay between channels resulted in a sound that has been described by collectors as \"messy\" (Duophonic) or \"garbage can echo\" (RCA Victor). Columbia's rechanneling resulted in a sound similar to reverb, though some found it annoying.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Rock and roll====\nWhen the [[British Invasion]] arrived in January 1964, Columbia had no rock musicians on its roster except for [[Dion DiMucci|Dion]], who was signed in 1963 as the label's first major rock star, and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] who were also signed in 1963. The label released a [[merseybeat]] album, ''The Exciting New Liverpool Sound'' (Columbia CL-2172, issued in mono only). [[Terry Melcher]], son of Doris Day, produced the hard driving \"Don't Make My Baby Blue\" for Frankie Laine, who had gone six years without a hit record. The song reached No. 51 on the pop chart and No. 17 on the easy listening chart.\n\nMelcher and [[Bruce Johnston]] discovered and brought to Columbia [[The Rip Chords]], a vocal group consisting of Ernie Bringas and Phil Stewart, and turned it into a rock group through production techniques. The group had hits in \"Here I Stand\", a remake of the song by [[Wade Flemons]], and \"[[Hey Little Cobra]]\". Columbia saw the two recordings as a start to getting into rock and roll. Melcher and Johnston recorded several additional singles for Columbia in 1964 as \"Bruce & Terry\" and later as \"The Rogues\". Melcher produced early albums by [[The Byrds]] and Paul Revere & the Raiders for Columbia while Johnston produced [[The Beach Boys]] for [[Capitol Records]].\n\n====Ascension of Clive Davis====\nWhen Mitch Miller retired in 1965,<ref name=\"Inc.1965\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7iIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA3|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=December 11, 1965|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=3|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Columbia was at a turning point. Miller's disdain for rock and roll and pop rock had dominated Columbia's A&R policy. The label's only significant \"pop\" acts at the time were Bob Dylan, The Byrds, Paul Revere & The Raiders and [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. In its catalogue were other genres: classical, jazz and country, along with a select group of R&B artists, among them [[Aretha Franklin]].<ref name=\"bsn17\" /> Most historians noted that Columbia had problems marketing Franklin as a major talent in the R&B genre, which led to her leaving the label for [[Atlantic Records]] in 1967.<ref>{{Gilliland|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1|Show 52 \u2013 The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

Sales of Broadway soundtracks and Mitch Miller's singalong series were waning. Pretax earnings had flattened to about $5 million annually.<ref name=\"hitmen\" /> Following the appointment of Davis, the Columbia label became more of a rock music label, thanks mainly to Davis's fortuitous decision to attend the [[Monterey International Pop Festival]], where he spotted and signed several leading acts including [[Janis Joplin]]. Joplin led the way for several generations of female rock and rollers. However, Columbia/CBS still had a hand in traditional pop and jazz and one of its key acquisitions during this period was [[Barbra Streisand]]. She released her first solo album on Columbia in 1963 and remains with the label to this day. Additionally, the label kept \nMiles Davis on the roster, and his late 1960s recordings, ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' and ''[[Bitches Brew]]'', pioneered a [[Jazz fusion|fusion of jazz and rock music]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/bitches-brew-r106167/review| title = Bitches Brew| author = Jurek, Thom| accessdate = April 11, 2012| publisher = Allmusic.com}}</ref>\n\nA San Francisco group called [[Moby Grape]] had been gaining popularity on the West Coast, and were signed by Davis in 1967. As a way of introducing them to the world with a splash, they released [[Moby Grape (album)|their debut album]], along with five singles from the album, all on the same day, June 6, 1967, 23 years following [[D-Day]]. The album hit made #24 on the [[Billboard 200]], but the singles barely made a dent in the charts, the best performer being \"Omaha,\" which lasted a mere three weeks on the Hot 100 reaching only No. 88. The other charter, \"Hey Grandma,\" only reached the Bubbling Under chart and faded within a week. Also, there were some complaints about the obscene gesture made to the American flag on the front cover that had to be edited out on the second pressing, not to mention that the group started to decline in sales after that. The return on all the promotional budget for the singles realized nothing. Although the group made two more albums, this particular publicity stunt was never again attempted by Columbia or any other major label.\n\n====Simon & Garfunkel====\nArguably the most commercially successful Columbia pop act of this period, other than Bob Dylan, was Simon & Garfunkel. The duo scored a surprise No. 1 hit in 1965 when CBS producer [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]], inspired by the folk-rock experiments of The Byrds and others, added drums and bass to the duo's earlier recording of \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" without their knowledge or approval. Indeed, the duo had already broken up some months earlier, discouraged by the poor sales of their debut LP, and [[Paul Simon]] had relocated to the UK, where he famously only found out about the single being a hit via the music press. The dramatic success of the song prompted Simon to return to the US; the duo reformed, and they soon became one of the flagship acts of the [[folk-rock]] boom of the mid-1960s. Their next album, ''[[Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme]]'', went to No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. The duo subsequently had a Top 20 single, \"[[A Hazy Shade of Winter]]\", but progress slowed during 1966-67 as Simon struggled with writer's block and the demands of constant touring. They shot back to the top in 1968 after Simon agreed to write songs for the [[Mike Nichols]] film ''[[The Graduate]]''. The resulting single, \"[[Mrs. Robinson]]\", became a smash hit. Both ''The Graduate'' soundtrack and Simon & Garfunkel's next studio album, ''[[Bookends (album)|Bookends]]'', were major hits on the album chart, with combined total sales in excess of five million copies. Simon and Garfunkel's fifth and final studio album, ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'' (1970), reached number one in the US album charts in January 1970 and became one of the most successful albums of all time.<ref name=\"bridge\">{{cite web|last1=Eder|first1=Bruce|title=Bridge Over Troubled Water|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bridge-over-troubled-water-mw0000191730|website=AllMusic|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Hoyt Axton and Tom Rush====\nDavis lured artists [[Hoyt Axton]] and [[Tom Rush]] to Columbia in 1969, and both were given what was known as \"the pop treatment\" by the label. Hoyt Axton had been a folk/blues singer-songwriter since the early 1960s, when he made several albums for [[Horizon Records|Horizon]], then [[Vee-Jay Records|Vee-Jay]]. By the time he joined Columbia, he had mixed successful pop songs like \"[[Greenback Dollar]],\" with hard rock songs for [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], such as \"[[The Pusher]]\", which was used in the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' in the same year. When he landed at Columbia, his album ''My Griffin Is Gone'' was described as \"the poster child for 'overproduced,' full of all kinds of instruments and even strings\".<ref name=\"bsn27\">{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Randy|last2=Callahan|first2=Mike|last3=Edwards|first3=David|last4=Eyries|first4=Patrice|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 27 (K)CS 9000-9999 (1969-1970)|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia3100.html|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref> After that album, Axton left and joined Capitol Records, where his next albums contained \"[[Joy to the World (Three Dog Night song)|Joy to the World]]\" and \"[[Never Been to Spain]],\" which became hits for [[Three Dog Night]] on [[Dunhill Records|Dunhill]]. Axton eventually became a country singer, and founded his own record label, Jeremiah.\n\nTom Rush had always been the \"storyteller\" or \"balladeer\" type of folk artist, before and after his stint with Columbia, to which Rush was lured from [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. As with Axton, Rush was given \"the treatment\" on [[Tom Rush (1970 album)|his self-titled Columbia debut]]. The multitude of instruments added to his usual solo guitar were all done \"tastefully\", of course, but was not really on par with Rush's audience expectations. He commented to record label historian Mike Callahan: {{cquote|Well, when you're in the studio, they bring out all these \"sweeteners\" and things they have, and while you're there, you say, yeah, that sounds good. But then you get the album home and you almost can't hear yourself under all that.<ref name=\"bsn27\" />}} Eventually, Rush returned to his usual sound (which he applied to his [[Wrong End of the Rainbow|next]] [[Merrimack County (album)|three]] [[Ladies Love Outlaws (Tom Rush album)|albums]] for Columbia) and has been playing to appreciative audiences ever since.\n\n===The 1970s===\n====Catalog numbers====\nThe Columbia album series began in 1951 with album GL-500 (CL-500) and reached an awkward milestone in 1970, when the stereo numbering sequence reached CS-9999, assigned to the [[Patti Page]] album ''Honey Come Back''. This presented a catalog numbering system challenge as Columbia had used a four-digit catalog number for 13 years, and CS-10000 seemed cumbersome. Columbia decided to start issuing albums at CS-1000 instead, preserving the four-digit catalog number. However, this resulted in the reuse of numbers previously used in 1957-58, although the prefix was now different. In July, 1970, the cataloging department implemented a new system, combining all their labels into a unified catalog numbering system starting with 30000, with the prefix letter indicating the label: C=Columbia, E=[[Epic Records|Epic]], M=[[Columbia Masterworks]], Y=[[Odyssey Records|Columbia Odyssey]], and Z=every other label that CBS distributed.  The prefix letter G was also used for two album sets\u2014or the number of records in the set after the label letter, such as KC2).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaldogproductions.info/c/cbs-lps-us.html|title=CBS LPs - US unified numbering system|website=Globaldogproductions.info|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> The first CBS album released under the new system was [[Elvin Bishop|The Elvin Bishop Group]]'s self-titled album on Fillmore Records, assigned with 30001, while the first actual Columbia release under the system was [[Herschel Bernardi]]'s ''Show Stopper'', assigned with C 30004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaldogproductions.info/c/cbs-us-30000-30499.html|title=LP Discography for CBS Records US combined numbering system 30000-30499|website=Globaldogproductions.info|accessdate=May 5, 2019}}</ref> The highest catalog number released in the old system was CS-1069, assigned to ''[[Sesame Street discography|The Sesame Street Book and Record]]''. Chronologically, Columbia issued at least one album in this series in August, but by that time, the CBS Consolidated 30000 series, which started issuing albums in July with the new label design, was well underway, having issued nearly 100 albums. The system was later expanded with even more prefix letters, which continued until 2005.\n\n====Quadraphonics====\nIn September 1970, under the guidance of [[Clive Davis]], Columbia Records entered the West Coast rock market, opening a state-of-the art recording studio (which was located at 827 Folsom St. in San Francisco and later morphed into the [[Automatt]]) and establishing an A&R head and office in San Francisco at [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]], headed by [[George Daly (Music Industry)|George Daly]], a producer and artist for [[Monument Records]] (who inked a distribution deal with Columbia at the time) and a former bandmate of [[Nils Lofgren]] and [[Roy Buchanan]]. The recording studio operated under CBS until 1978.<ref>{{cite book |title=If These Halls Could Talk: A Historical Tour Through San Francisco Recording Studios |url=https://archive.org/details/ifthesehallscoul00heat |url-access=registration |last=Johnson |first=Heather |publisher=Thomson Course Technology |year=2006 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ifthesehallscoul00heat/page/n104 90]\u201394 |isbn=1-59863-141-1}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1970s, Columbia began recording in a four-channel process called [[quadraphonic]], using the \"SQ\" (Stereo Quadraphonic) standard that used an electronic encoding process that could be decoded by special amplifiers and then played through four speakers, with each speaker placed in the corner of a room. Remarkably, RCA countered with another quadraphonic process that required a special cartridge to play the \"discrete\" recordings for four-channel playback. Both Columbia and RCA's quadraphonic records could be played on conventional stereo equipment. Although the Columbia process required less equipment and was quite effective, many were confused by the competing systems and sales of both Columbia's matrix recordings and RCA's discrete recordings were disappointing. A few other companies also issued some matrix recordings for a few years. Quadraphonic recording was used by both classical artists, including [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Pierre Boulez]], and popular artists such as [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Ray Conniff]], [[Carlos Santana]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[The Clash]] and [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]. Columbia even released a soundtrack album of the movie version of ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]'' in quadraphonic. Many of these recordings were later remastered and released in Dolby surround sound on CD.\n\n====Yetnikoff becomes president====\nIn 1975, Walter Yetnikoff was promoted to become President of Columbia Records, and his vacated position as President of CBS Records International was filled by Dick Asher. At this point, according to music historian Frederic Dannen, the  shy and introverted Yetnikoff began to transform his personality, becoming (in Asher's words) \"wild, menacing, crude, and above all, very loud\". In Dannen's view, Yetnikoff was probably over-compensating for his naturally sensitive and generous personality, and that he had little hope of being recognised as a \"record man\" (someone with a musical ear and an intuitive understanding of current trends and artists' intentions) because he was tone-deaf, so he instead determined to become a \"colourful character\".<ref>Dannen, ''op cit'', p.19</ref> Yetnikoff soon became notorious for his violent temper and regular tantrums: \"He shattered glassware, spewed a mixture of Yiddish and barnyard epithets, and had people physically ejected from the CBS building.\"<ref>Dannen, ''op cit'', p.21</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Columbia Records of Canada was renamed CBS Records Canada Ltd.<ref name=ce /> The Columbia label continued to be used by CBS Canada, but the CBS label was introduced for [[French language|French-language]] recordings. On May 5, 1979, Columbia Masterworks began [[digital recording]] in a recording session of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Petrouchka]]'' by the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], conducted by [[Zubin Mehta]], in New York (using [[3M]]'s 32-channel multitrack digital recorder).\n\n====Dick Asher vs \"The Network\"====\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\nCBS Records had a popular roster of musicians. It distributed [[Philadelphia International Records]], [[Blue Sky Records]], the [[Isley Brothers]]' [[T-Neck Records]] and [[Monument Records]] (from 1971 to 1976). But the music industry was in financial decline. Total sales fell by 11%, the biggest drop since World War II. In 1979 CBS had a pre-tax income of $51 million and sales of over $1 billion. The label laid off hundreds of employees.\n\nTo deal with the crisis, CEO [[John Backe]] promoted [[Dick Asher]] from Vice President of Business Affairs to Deputy President. Charged with cutting costs and restoring profits, Asher was reportedly reluctant to take on the role. He was worried that Yetnikoff would resent his promotion. But Backe had confidence in Asher's experience. In 1972 Asher had turned the British division of CBS from loss to profit. Backe considered him to be honest and trustworthy, and he appealed to Asher's loyalty to the company. Employees at CBS thought Asher was a bore and an interloper. He cut back on expenses and on perks like limousines and restaurants. His relationship with Yetnikoff deteriorated.\n\nAsher became increasingly concerned about the huge and rapidly growing cost of hiring independent agents, who were paid to promote new singles to radio station program directors. \"Indies\" had been used by record labels for many years to promote new releases, but as he methodically delved into CBS Records' expenses, Asher was dismayed to discover that hiring these independent promoters was now costing CBS alone as much as $10 million per year. When Asher took over CBS' UK division in 1972, a freelance promoter might only charge $100 per week, but by 1979 the top American independent promoters had organized themselves into a loose collective known as \"The Network\", and their fees were now running into the tens millions of dollars per year, Music historian [[Frederic Dannen]] estimates that by 1980 the major labels were paying anywhere from to $100,000 to $300,000 ''per song'' to the \"Network\" promoters, and that it was costing the industry as whole as much as $80 million annually.\n\nDuring this period, Columbia scored a Top 40 hit with the [[Pink Floyd]] single \"[[Another Brick In The Wall]]\", and its parent album ''[[The Wall]]'' would spend four months at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' LP chart in early 1980, but few in the industry knew that Dick Asher was in fact using the single as a covert experiment to test the extent of the pernicious influence of The Network - by ''not'' paying them to promote the new Pink Floyd single. The results were immediate and deeply troubling - not one of the major radio stations in Los Angeles would program the record, despite the fact that the group was in town, performing the first seven concerts on their elaborate [[The Wall Tour (1980\u201381)|The Wall Tour]] at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] to rave reviews and sold-out crowds. Asher was already worried about the growing power of The Network, and the fact it operated entirely outside the control of the label, but he was profoundly dismayed to realize that \"The Network\" was in effect a huge [[extortion]] racket, and that the operation could well be linked to organized crime - a concern vehemently dismissed by Yetnikoff, who resolutely defended the \"indies\" and declared them to be \"mensches\". But Dick Asher now knew that The Network's real power lay in their ability to ''prevent'' records from being picked up by radio, and as an experienced media lawyer and a loyal CBS employee, he was also acutely aware that this could become a new [[payola]] scandal which had the potential to engulf the entire CBS corporation, and that the Federal Communications Commission could even revoke CBS' all-important broadcast licenses if the corporation was found to be involved in any illegality.<ref>Dannen, Frederic, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside The Music Business'', Vintage Books, 1991 ({{ISBN|0099813106}}), pp. 4-27</ref>\n\n===The 1980s and sale to Sony===\n\nThe structure of US Columbia remained the same until 1980, when it spun off the classical/Broadway unit, Columbia Masterworks Records, into a separate imprint, CBS Masterworks Records.\n\nIn 1988, the CBS Records Group, including the Columbia Records unit, was acquired by [[Sony]], which re-christened the parent division [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1991.

It was used by several denominations over the next seventy years, then briefly became a radio studio in the late 1940s before being leased by CBS in 1952 and converted into a state-of-the-art recording studio. The 30th Street Studio had unique sonic characteristics, thanks to its soaring one-hundred-foot vaulted ceiling, exposed timber beams, plaster walls and unvarnished wooden floor. When Columbia took over the property, then head of A&R [[Mitch Miller]] (a musician himself) recognised its singular acoustic properties and declared that the hall was to be left \"untouched by human hands\". He posted detailed standing orders to all staff to control the maintenance and cleaning of the space, even down to the changing of light bulbs, ordering that the curtains and other fittings were never to be touched, that no painting was allowed, and especially that the wooden floor could only be swept or vacuumed, and was never under any circumstances to be mopped with water, for fear that this might alter the room's resonant and reflective properties.<ref>Milner, Greg, ''Perfecting Sound Forever: The Story of recorded Music'', Granta Books, London, 2009 ({{ISBN|978-1-84708-140-7}}), p. 149</ref> CBS never took up the option to buy the building outright and it gave up its lease and closed the studio in 1982.

Easton]] (1856\u20131915) and a group of investors. It derived its name from the [[District of Columbia]], where it was headquartered.<ref name=\"IEEE Easton\">{{cite web|title=Edward Easton|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Edward_Easton |publisher=IEEE |accessdate=January 22, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Bilton|first=Lynn|title=Hail, Columbia: A fresh book at last gives Edward Easton and his Graphophone company their due|url=http://www.intertique.com/Hail%20Columbia.htm|accessdate=January 22, 2014|year=1998}}</ref> At first it had a local monopoly on sales and service of Edison [[phonograph]]s and [[phonograph cylinder]]s in Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Delaware. As was the custom of some of the regional phonograph companies, Columbia produced many commercial cylinder recordings of its own, and its catalogue of musical records in 1891 was 10 pages.\n\nColumbia's ties to Edison and the [[North American Phonograph Company]] were severed in 1894 with the [[North American Phonograph Company]]'s breakup. Thereafter it sold only records and phonographs of its own manufacture. In 1902, Columbia introduced the \"XP\" record, a molded brown wax record, to use up old stock. Columbia introduced black wax records in 1903. According to one source, they continued to mold brown waxes until 1904 with the highest number being 32601, \"Heinie\", which is a duet by [[Arthur Collins (singer)|Arthur Collins]] and [[Byron G. Harlan]]. The molded brown waxes may have been sold to [[Sears]] for distribution (possibly under Sears' Oxford trademark for Columbia products).<ref>{{cite web|last=Gracyk |first=Tim |url=http://www.gracyk.com/wax.shtml |title=Tim Gracyk's Phonographs, Singers, and Old Records - How Late Did Columbia Use Brown Wax? |publisher=Gracyk.com |date=October 11, 1904 |accessdate=December 31, 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Graphophone1901.jpg|right|thumb|A Columbia type AT cylinder [[graphophone]] was produced in 1898.<ref name=\"guide\">{{cite book|last=Hazelcorn|first=Howard|title=A Collector's Guide to the Columbia Spring-Wound Cylinder Graphophone|publisher=Antique Phonograph Monthly|year=1976|edition=1|pages=10, 13}}</ref>]]\n\nColumbia began selling [[gramophone record|disc records]] (invented and patented by Victor Talking Machine Company's [[Emile Berliner]]) and phonographs in addition to the cylinder system in 1901, preceded only by their \"Toy Graphophone\" of 1899, which used small, vertically cut records. For a decade, Columbia competed with both the [[Edison Phonograph Company]] cylinders and the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]] disc records as one of the top three names in American recorded sound.\n\nIn order to add prestige to its early catalog of artists, Columbia contracted a number of [[New York Metropolitan Opera]] stars to make recordings (from 1903 onward). These stars included [[Marcella Sembrich]], [[Lillian Nordica]], [[Antonio Scotti]] and [[Edouard de Reszke]], but the technical standard of their recordings was not considered to be as high as the results achieved with classical singers during the pre\u2013World War I period by Victor, Edison, England's [[His Master's Voice]] (The [[Gramophone Company]] Ltd.) or Italy's [[Fonotipia Records]]. After an abortive attempt in 1904 to manufacture discs with the recording grooves stamped into both sides of each disc\u2014not just one\u2014in 1908 Columbia commenced successful mass production of what they called their \"Double-Faced\" discs, the 10-inch variety initially selling for 65 cents apiece. The firm also introduced the internal-horn \"'''[[Graphophone|Grafonola]]'''\" to compete with the extremely popular \"[[Victrola]]\" sold by the rival Victor Talking Machine Company.\n\nDuring this era, Columbia used the \"Magic Notes\" logo\u2014a pair of sixteenth notes (semiquavers) in a circle\u2014both in the United States and overseas (where this particular logo would never substantially change).\n\n[[File:Columbia1116D.jpg|left|thumb|The American label of an electrically recorded Columbia disc by [[Art Gillham]] from the mid-twenties]]\n\nColumbia stopped recording and manufacturing wax cylinder records in 1908, after arranging to issue celluloid cylinder records made by the [[Indestructible Record Company]] of [[Albany, New York]], as \"Columbia Indestructible Records\". In July 1912, Columbia decided to concentrate exclusively on disc records and stopped manufacturing cylinder phonographs, although they continued selling Indestructible's cylinders under the Columbia name for a year or two more.\n\nColumbia was split into two companies, one to make records and one to make players. Columbia Phonograph was moved to Connecticut, and Ed Easton went with it. Eventually it was renamed the [[Dictaphone|Dictaphone Corporation]].<ref name=\"IEEE Easton\"/>\n\n[[File:Col4951A.jpg|right|thumb|The British label of an electrically recorded Columbia disc by [[Paul Whiteman]]]]\n\nIn late 1922, Columbia went into receivership.<ref name=\"New Grove\">{{cite book|last1=Rye|first1=Howard |last2=Kernfeld |first2=Barry|editor1-last=Kernfeld|editor1-first=Barry|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz|date=2002|publisher=Grove's Dictionaries Inc.|location=New York|isbn=1-56159-284-6|page=172|volume=1|edition=2nd}}</ref> The company was bought by its [[Columbia Graphophone Company|English subsidiary, the Columbia Graphophone Company]] in 1925 and the label, record numbering system, and recording process changed. On February 25, 1925, Columbia began recording with the electric recording process licensed from [[Western Electric]]. \"Viva-tonal\" records set a benchmark in tone and clarity unequaled on commercial discs during the 78-rpm era. The first electrical recordings were made by [[Art Gillham]], the \"Whispering Pianist\". In a secret agreement with Victor, electrical technology was kept secret to avoid hurting sales of acoustic records.\n\nIn 1926, Columbia acquired [[Okeh Records]] and its growing stable of jazz and blues artists, including [[Louis Armstrong]] and [[Clarence Williams (musician)|Clarence Williams]]. Columbia had already built a catalog of blues and jazz artists, including [[Bessie Smith]] in their 14000-D Race series. Columbia also had a successful \"Hillbilly\" series (15000-D). In 1928, [[Paul Whiteman]], the nation's most popular orchestra leader, left Victor to record for Columbia. During the same year, Columbia executive [[Frank Buckley Walker]] pioneered some of the first country music or \"hillbilly\" genre recordings with the [[Johnson City sessions]] in Tennessee, including artists such as [[Clarence Horton Greene]] and [[Charlie Bowman|\"Fiddlin'\" Charlie Bowman]]. He followed that with a return to Tennessee the next year, as well as recording sessions in other cities of the South.\n\nIn 1929 [[Ben Selvin]] became house bandleader and A. & R. director. Other favorites in the Viva-tonal era included [[Ruth Etting]], Paul Whiteman, [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Ipana Troubadours]] (a Sam Lanin group), and [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]]. Columbia used acoustic recording for \"budget label\" pop product well into 1929 on the labels Harmony, Velvet Tone (both general purpose labels), and [[Diva Records|Diva]] (sold exclusively at [[W.T. Grant]] stores). When Edison Records folded, Columbia was the oldest surviving record label.\n\n===Columbia ownership separation (1931\u20131936)===\nIn 1931, the British Columbia Graphophone Company (itself originally a subsidiary of American Columbia Records, then to become independent, actually went on to purchase its former parent, American Columbia, in late 1929) merged with the [[Gramophone Company]] to form Electric & Musical Industries Ltd. ([[EMI]]). EMI was forced to sell its American Columbia operations (because of anti-trust concerns) and the Grigsby-Grunow Company, makers of the Majestic Radio were the purchaser. But Majestic soon fell on hard times. An abortive attempt in 1932 (around the same time that Victor was experimenting with its 33{{fraction|1|3}} \"program transcriptions\") was the \"Longer Playing Record\", a finer-grooved 10\" 78 with 4:30 to 5:00 playing time per side. Columbia issued about eight of these (in the 18000-D series), as well as a short-lived series of double-grooved \"Longer Playing Record\"s on its Clarion Records, Harmony and Velvet Tone labels. All of these experiments (and indeed the Clarion, Harmony and Velvet Tone labels) were discontinued by mid-1932.\n\nA longer-lived marketing ploy was the Columbia \"Royal Blue Record,\" a brilliant blue laminated product with matching label. Royal Blue issues, made from late 1932 through 1935, are particularly popular with collectors for their rarity and musical interest. The Columbia plant in Oakland, California, did Columbia's pressings for sale west of the Rockies and continued using the Royal Blue material for these until about mid-1936.\n\nWith the Great Depression's tightened economic stranglehold on the country, in a day when the phonograph itself had become a luxury, nothing slowed Columbia's decline. It was still producing some of the most remarkable records of the day, especially on sessions produced by [[John H. Hammond|John Hammond]] and financed by EMI for overseas release. Grigsby-Grunow went under in 1934 and was forced to sell Columbia for a mere $70,000 to the [[American Record Corporation]] (ARC).<ref name=\"Hoffman2004\">{{cite book|author=Frank Hoffman|title=Encyclopedia of Recorded Sound|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xV6tghvO0oMC&pg=PA212|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=August 21, 2004|publisher=Taylor & Francis|isbn=978-0-203-48427-2|page=212}}</ref> This combine already included [[Brunswick Records|Brunswick]] as its premium label so Columbia was relegated to slower sellers such as the Hawaiian music of [[Andy Iona]], the [[Irving Mills]] stable of artists and songs, and the still unknown [[Benny Goodman]]. By late 1936, pop releases were discontinued, leaving the label essentially defunct.\n\nIn 1935, Herbert M. Greenspon, an 18-year-old shipping clerk, led a committee to organize the first trade union shop at the main manufacturing factory in Bridgeport, Connecticut. Elected as president of the Congress of Industrial Unions (CIO) local, Greenspon negotiated the first contract between factory workers and Columbia management. In a career with Columbia that lasted 30 years, Greenspon retired after achieving the position of executive vice president of the company.

Retrieved on July 16, 2013.</ref>\n\nAs [[southern gospel]] developed, Columbia had astutely sought to record the artists associated with the emerging genre; for example, Columbia was the only company to record [[Charles Davis Tillman]]. Most fortuitously for Columbia in its Depression Era financial woes, in 1936 the company entered into an exclusive recording contract with the [[Chuck Wagon Gang]], a hugely successful relationship which continued into the 1970s. A signature group of southern gospel, the Chuck Wagon Gang became Columbia's bestsellers with at least 37 million records,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |title=Solid Gospel series brings Chuck Wagon Gang to Renaissance Center. |publisher= |accessdate=November 8, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120810135439/http://www.rcenter.org/Home/News/Concerts/ChuckWagonGang.asp |archivedate=August 10, 2012}}</ref> many of them through the aegis of the ''Mull Singing Convention of the Air'' sponsored on radio (and later television) by southern gospel broadcaster [[J. Bazzel Mull]] (1914\u20132006).\n\nAnother event in this period that would prove to be of importance to Columbia was the 1937 hiring of talent scout, music writer, producer, and impresario John Hammond. Alongside his significance as a discoverer, promoter, and producer of jazz, blues, and folk artists during the [[swing music]] era, Hammond had already been of great help to Columbia in 1932\u201333. Through his involvement in the UK music paper ''[[Melody Maker]]'', Hammond had arranged for the struggling US Columbia label to provide recordings for the UK Columbia label, mostly using the specially created Columbia W-265000 matrix series. Hammond recorded [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[Benny Carter]], [[Joe Venuti]], [[Roger Wolfe Kahn]] and other jazz performers during a time when the economy was bad enough that many of them would not have had the opportunity to enter a studio and play real jazz (a handful of these in this special series were issued in the US). Hammond's work for Columbia was interrupted by his service during World War II, and he had less involvement with the music scene during the [[bebop]] era, but when he returned to work as a talent scout for Columbia in the 1950s, his career proved to be of incalculable historical and cultural importance - the list of superstar artists he would discover and sign to Columbia over the course of his career included [[Charlie Christian]], [[Count Basie]], [[Teddy Wilson]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Aretha Franklin]], [[Bruce Springsteen]] and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], and in the early 1960s Hammond would also exert an enormous cultural effect on the emerging rock music scene thanks to his championing of reissue LPs of the music of blues artists [[Robert Johnson]] and [[Bessie Smith]].\n\n===CBS takes over (1938\u20131947)===\n[[File:notesandmike.jpg|thumbnail|125px|left|Columbia \"notes and mic\" logo]]\n\nIn 1938 ARC, including the Columbia label in the US, was bought by [[William S.

The Royal Blue labels now disappeared in favor of a deep red, which caused [[RCA Victor]] to claim infringement on its [[RCA Red Seal Records|Red Seal]] trademark (RCA lost the case). The blue Columbia label was kept for its [[European classical music|classical music]] [[Columbia Masterworks Records]] line until it was later changed to a green label before switching to a gray label in the late 1950s, and then to the bronze that is familiar to owners of its classical and Broadway albums. Columbia Phonograph Company of Canada did not survive the [[Great Depression]], so CBS made a distribution deal with [[Sparton Records]] in 1939 to release Columbia records in Canada under the Columbia name.\n\nDuring the 1940s Columbia had a contract with [[Frank Sinatra]]. Sinatra helped boost Columbia in revenue. Sinatra recorded over 200 songs with Columbia which include his most popular songs from his early years. Other popular artists on Columbia included [[Benny Goodman]] (signed from RCA Victor), [[Count Basie]], [[Jimmie Lunceford]] (both signed from Decca), [[Eddy Duchin]], [[Ray Noble]] (both moved to Columbia from Brunswick), [[Kate Smith]], [[Mildred Bailey]], and [[Will Bradley]].\n\nIn 1947, the company was renamed Columbia Records Inc.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/item/2002655160/ | title=Columbia Records paperwork collection}}</ref> and founded its Mexican record company, Discos Columbia de Mexico.<ref>{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA60|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=March 16, 1963|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=60|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> 1948 saw the first classical LP [[Mendelssohn Violin Concerto (Nathan Milstein album)|Nathan Milstein's recording of the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto]].

Some, like opera tenor (''sic''), Ezio Pinza, would go to Columbia...\"</ref>\n\n===The LP record (1948\u20131959)===\n\nColumbia's president Edward Wallerstein was instrumental in steering Paley towards the ARC purchase. He set his talents to his goal of hearing an entire movement of a symphony on one side of an album. Ward Botsford writing for the Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Issue of ''High Fidelity Magazine'' relates, \"He was no inventor\u2014he was simply a man who seized an idea whose time was ripe and begged, ordered, and cajoled a thousand men into bringing into being the now accepted medium of the record business.\" Despite Wallerstein's stormy tenure, in June 1948, Columbia introduced the Long Playing \"microgroove\" [[LP record]] format (sometimes written \"Lp\" in early advertisements), which rotated at 33\u2153 [[revolutions per minute]], to be the standard for the gramophone record for half a century. CBS research director Dr. [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]] played a managerial role in the collaborative effort, but Wallerstein credits engineer [[William Savory]] with the technical prowess that brought the long-playing disc to the public.<ref name=\"catalog1949\">{{cite book|title=Columbia Record Catalog 1949|publisher=Columbia Records Inc.|pages=1\u201320}}</ref>\n\nBy the early 1940s, Columbia had been experimenting with higher fidelity recordings, as well as longer masters, which paved the way for the successful release of the LPs in 1948. One such record that helped set a new standard for music listeners was the 10\" LP reissue of ''[[The Voice of Frank Sinatra]]'', originally released on March 4, 1946 as an album of four 78 rpm records, which was the first pop album issued in the new LP format. [[Sinatra]] was arguably Columbia's hottest commodity and his artistic vision combined with the direction Columbia were taking the medium of music, both popular and classic, were well suited. ''The Voice of Frank Sinatra'' was also considered to be the first genuine ''[[concept album]]''. Since the term \"LP\" has come to refer to the 12-inch {{frac|33|1|3}} rpm vinyl disk, the first LP is the Mendelssohn Violin Concerto in E minor played by Nathan Milstein with Bruno Walter conducting the New York Philharmonic (then called the Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra of New York), Columbia ML 4001, found in the Columbia Record Catalog for 1949, published in July 1948. The other \"LP's\" listed in the catalog were in the 10 inch format starting with ML 2001 for the light classics, CL 6001 for popular songs and JL 8001 for children's records.<ref name=\"catalog1949\"/> The Library of Congress (Washington DC) now holds the Columbia Records Paperwork Archive which shows the Label order for ML 4001 being written on March 1, 1948. One can infer that Columbia was pressing the first LPs for distribution to their dealers for at least 3 months prior to the introduction of the LP in June 1948.<ref>Library of Congress Columbia Records Paperwork Box 121</ref> The catalog numbering system has had minor changes ever since.\n\nColumbia's LPs were particularly well-suited to classical music's longer pieces, so some of the early albums featured such artists as [[Eugene Ormandy]] and the [[Philadelphia Orchestra]], [[Bruno Walter]] and the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], and [[Sir Thomas Beecham]] and the [[Royal Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The success of these recordings eventually persuaded [[Capitol Records]] to begin releasing LPs in 1949. Even before the LP record was officially demonstrated, Columbia offered to share the new speed with rival  RCA Victor, who initially rejected it and soon introduced their new competitive 45 RPM record. When it became clear that the LP was the preferred format for classical recordings, RCA Victor announced that the company would begin releasing its own LPs in January, 1950. This was quickly followed by the other major American labels. [[Decca Records]] in the U.K. was the first to release LPs in Europe, beginning in 1949. EMI would not fully adopt the LP format until 1955.\n\nAn \"original cast recording\" of [[Rodgers & Hammerstein]]'s ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' with [[Ezio Pinza]] and [[Mary Martin]] was recorded in 1949. Both conventional metal masters and tape were used in the sessions in New York City. For some reason, the taped version was not used until Sony released it as part of a set of CDs devoted to Columbia's Broadway albums.<ref>Sony liner notes</ref>  Over the years, Columbia joined Decca and RCA Victor in specializing in albums devoted to Broadway musicals with members of the original casts. In the 1950s, Columbia also began releasing LPs drawn from the soundtracks of popular films.\n\nMany album covers put together by Columbia and the other major labels were put together using one piece of cardboard (folded in half) and two paper \"slicks,\" one for the front and one for the back. The front slick bent around the top, bottom, and left sides (the right side is open for the record to be inserted into the cover) and glued the two halves of cardboard together at the top and bottom. The back slick is pasted over the edges of the pasted-on front slick to make it appear that the album cover is one continuous piece.\n\nColumbia discovered that printing two front cover slicks, one for mono and one for stereo, was inefficient and therefore needlessly costly. Starting in the summer of 1959 with some of the albums released in August, they went to the \"paste-over\" front slick, which had the stereo information printed on the top and the mono information printed on the bottom. For stereo issues, they moved the front slick down so the stereo information was showing at the top, and the mono information was bent around the bottom to the back and \"pasted over\" by the back slick. Conversely, for a mono album, they moved the slick up so the mono information showed at the bottom, and the stereo information was pasted over.\n\n===The 1950s===\n[[File:ATeenageLoveAffair.JPG|thumbnail|left|Columbia used this label for its 45 r.p.m. records from 1951 until 1958.]]\n\nIn 1951, Columbia US began issuing records in the 45 rpm format RCA Victor had introduced two years earlier.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubby.net/worldofcubby/RCR/record_history.html |title=Record Collector's Resource: A History of Records |publisher=Cubby.net |date=February 26, 1917 |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref> The same year, Ted Wallerstein retired as Columbia Records chairman;<ref name=\"Inc.1970\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nSkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=September 26, 1970|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=10|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> and Columbia US also severed its decades-long distribution arrangement with EMI and signed a distribution deal with [[Philips Records]] to market Columbia recordings outside North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/bbe12043 |title=Mitch Miller And His Orchestra And Chorus - Mitch Miller - Philips - UK |publisher=45cat |date= |accessdate=February 28, 2013}}</ref> EMI continued to distribute Okeh and later Epic label recordings until 1968.

(Miller was a classically trained oboist who had been a friend of Columbia executive Goddard Lieberson since their days at the [[Eastman School of Music]] in the 1930s.)<ref>Dannen, Frederic, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside The Music Business'', Vintage Books, 1991 ({{ISBN|0099813106}}), p. 62</ref> Miller quickly signed up Mercury's biggest artist at the time, [[Frankie Laine]], and discovered several of the decade's biggest recording stars including [[Tony Bennett]], [[Mahalia Jackson]], [[Jimmy Boyd]], [[Guy Mitchell]] (whose stage surname was taken from Miller's first name), [[Johnnie Ray]], [[The Four Lads]], [[Rosemary Clooney]], [[Ray Conniff]], [[Jerry Vale]] and [[Johnny Mathis]].

Columbia continued to use the \"notes and mike\" logo on record labels and even used a promo label showing both logos until the \"notes and mike\" was phased out (along with the 78 in the US) in 1958. In Canada, Columbia 78s were pressed with the \"Walking Eye\" logo in 1958.

Under new head producer [[George Avakian]], Columbia became the most vital label to the general public's appreciation and understanding (with help from Avakian's prolific and perceptive play-by-play liner notes) of America's indigenous art, releasing the most important LP's by the music's founding father, [[Louis Armstrong]], but also signing to long-term contracts  [[Dave Brubeck]] and [[Miles Davis]], the two modern jazz artists who would in 1959 record albums that remain\u2014more than a half century later\u2014among the best-selling jazz albums by any label\u2014viz., ''[[Time Out (album)|Time Out]]'' by the Brubeck Quartet and, to an even greater extent, ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' by the Davis Sextet, which, in 2003, appeared as number 12 in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'s'' list of the \"500 Greatest Albums Of All Time\".<ref>{{cite magazine| url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231/kind-of-blue-miles-davis-19691231| title = Kind of Blue\n| date = February 9, 2003| accessdate = April 11, 2012| magazine = Rollingstone.com}}</ref> With another producer, [[Teo Macero]], a skilled modernist composer himself, Columbia cemented contracts with jazz giants [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Charles Mingus]], while Macero became a key agent in recording and representing\u2014through attention-grabbing, colorful\u2014albums the protean faces of Miles Davis\u2014from leading exponent of [[cool jazz]] and an explorer of the art of [[modal jazz]] through his sextet's 1958 album ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' to innovator and avatar of the marriage of jazz with rock and electronic sounds\u2014commonly known as [[jazz fusion]].\n\n1954 was the eventful year of Columbia's embracing small-group modern jazz\u2014first, in the signing of the Dave Brubeck Quartet, which resulted in the release of the on-location, best-selling jazz album (up to this time), ''[[Jazz Goes to College]]''. Contemporaneously with Columbia's first release of modern jazz by a small group, which was also the Brubeck Quartet's debut on the label, was a [[Time Magazine]] cover story on the phenomenon of Brubeck's success on college campuses. The humble [[Dave Brubeck]] demurred, saying that the second [[Time Magazine]] cover story on a jazz musician (the first featured [[Louis Armstrong]]'s picture) had been earned by [[Duke Ellington]], not himself. Within two years Ellington's picture would appear on the cover of [[Time Magazine]], following his \"wild\" success at the 1956 Newport Jazz Festival. [[Ellington at Newport]], recorded on Columbia, was also the bandleader-composer-pianist's best-selling album. Moreover, this exclusive trinity of jazz giants featured on [[Time Magazine]] were all Columbia artists. (In the early 1960s Columbia jazz artist [[Thelonious Monk]] would be afforded the same honor.)\n\nColumbia changed distributors in Australia and New Zealand in 1956 when the Australian Record Company picked up distribution of U.S. Columbia product to replace the [[Capitol Records]] product which ARC lost when EMI bought Capitol. As EMI owned the Columbia trademark at that time, the U.S. Columbia material was issued in Australia and New Zealand on the [[Coronet Records|CBS Coronet]] label.\n\nIn the same year, former Columbia A&R manager [[Goddard Lieberson]] was promoted to President of the entire CBS recording division, which included Columbia and Epic, as well as the company's various international divisions and licensees. Under his leadership the corporation's music division soon overtook [[RCA Victor]] as the top recording company in the world, boasting a star-studded roster of artists and an unmatched catalogue of popular, jazz, classical and stage and screen soundtrack titles. Lieberson, who had joined Columbia as an A&R manager in 1938, was noted for both his personal elegance and his dedication to quality, overseeing the release of many hugely successful albums and singles, as well as championing prestige releases that sold relatively poorly, and even some titles that had very limited appeal, such as complete editions of the works of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Anton von Webern]]. One of his first major successes was the original cast soundtrack of ''[[My Fair Lady]]'', which sold over 5 million copies worldwide in 1957, becoming the most successful LP ever released up to that time. Lieberson also convinced long-serving CBS President William S. Paley to become the sole backer of the original Broadway production, a $500,000 investment which subsequently earned the company some $32 million in profits.<ref>Dannen, Frederic, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside The Music Business'', Vintage Books, 1991 ({{ISBN|0099813106}}), pp. 60-61</ref>\n\nIn October 1958, Columbia, in time for the Christmas season, put out a series of \"Greatest Hits\" packages by such artists as Johnny Mathis, Doris Day, Guy Mitchell, Johnnie Ray, [[Jo Stafford]], Tony Bennett, Rosemary Clooney, Frankie Laine and [[the Four Lads]]; months later, it put out another Mathis compilation as well as that of [[Marty Robbins]]. Only Mathis' compilations charted, since there were only 25 positions on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'''s album charts]] at the time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1200.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 14 (CL 1200-1299) 1958-1959|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> However, the compilations were so successful that they led to Columbia doing such packages on a widespread basis, usually when an artist's career was in decline.\n\n====Stereo====\n\nAlthough Columbia began recording in stereo in 1956, stereo LPs did not begin to be manufactured until 1958. One of Columbia's first stereo releases was an abridged and re-structured performance of [[Handel]]'s ''[[Messiah (oratorio)|Messiah]]'' by the [[New York Philharmonic]] and the [[Westminster Choir]] conducted by [[Leonard Bernstein]] (recorded on December 31, 1956, on {{1/2}}-inch tape, using an Ampex 300-3 machine). Bernstein combined the Nativity and Resurrection sections, and ended the performance with the death of Christ. As with RCA Victor, most of the early stereo recordings were of classical artists, including the New York Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by [[Bruno Walter]], [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]], and [[Leonard Bernstein]], and the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by [[Eugene Ormandy]], who also recorded an abridged ''Messiah'' for Columbia. Some sessions were made with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra, an ensemble drawn from leading New York musicians, which had first made recordings with Sir Thomas Beecham in 1949 in Columbia's famous New York City studios. [[George Szell]] and the [[Cleveland Orchestra]] recorded mostly for Epic. When Epic dropped classical music, the roster and catalogue was moved to [[Columbia Masterworks Records]].\n\nColumbia released its first pop stereo albums in the summer of 1958. All of the first dozen or so were stereo versions of albums already available in mono. It wasn't until September 1958, that Columbia started simultaneous mono/stereo releases. Mono records sold to the general public were subsequently discontinued in 1968. To celebrate the 10th anniversary of the introduction of the LP, in 1958 Columbia initiated the \"Adventures in Sound\" series that showcased music from around the world.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Billboard|date=January 6, 1958|title=Columbia's 1958 Tee-Off Cues Big Product Campaign: Program Set to Tie in with LP Disk's 10th Anniversary Year|url=|journal=Billboard|volume=|page=15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Designed for Hi-Fi Living : The Vinyl LP in Midcentury America|last=Borgerson|first=Janet|publisher=MIT Press|others=Schroeder, Jonathan E., 1962|year=2017|isbn=9780262036238|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=283\u2013297|oclc=958205262}}</ref>\n\nAs far as the catalog numbering system went, there was no correlation between mono and stereo versions for the first few years. Columbia started a new CS 8000 series for pop stereo releases, and figuring the stereo releases as some sort of specialty niche records, didn't bother to link the mono and stereo numbers for two years. Masterworks classical LPs had an MS 6000 series, while showtunes albums on Masterworks were OS 2000. Finally, in 1960, the pop stereo series jumped from 8300 to 8310 to match ''Lambert, Hendricks & Ross Sing [[Duke Ellington|Ellington]]'', the [[Lambert, Hendricks & Ross]] album issued as CL-1510. From that point, the stereo numbers on pop albums were exactly 6800 higher than the mono; stereo classical albums were the mono number plus 600; and showtunes releases were the mono number MINUS 3600. Only the last two digits in the respective catalog series' matched.\n\nPop stereo LPs got into the high 9000s by 1970, when CBS Records revamped and unified its catalog numbering system across all its labels. Masterworks classical albums were in the 7000s, while showtunes stayed in the low 2000s.\n\n===The 1960s===\n====Outing of \"deep groove\"====\nBy the latter half of 1961, Columbia started using pressing plants with newer equipment. The \"deep groove\" pressings were made on older pressing machines, where the groove was an artifact of the metal stamper being affixed to a round center \"block\" to assure the resulting record would be centered. Newer machines used parts with a slightly different geometry, that only left a small \"ledge\" where the deep groove used to be. This changeover did not happen all at once, as different plants replaced machines at different times, leaving the possibility that both deep groove and ledge varieties could be original pressings. The changeover took place starting in late 1961.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1600.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 12 (CL 1600-1699/CS 8400-8499) 1961-1962|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====CBS Records====\n{{see also|CBS Records International}}\n[[File:CBSRecords.png|thumbnail|125px|right|CBS Records logo outside of the United States]]\n\nIn 1961, CBS ended its arrangement with Philips Records and formed its own international organization, CBS Records, in 1962, which released Columbia recordings outside the US and Canada on the CBS label (until 1964 marketed by Philips in Britain).<ref name=\"Inc.1963\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media|title=Billboard|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eQsEAAAAMBAJ|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=March 16, 1963|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_eQsEAAAAMBAJ/page/n37 40]|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> The recordings could not be released under the Columbia Records name because EMI operated a separate record label by that name, [[Columbia Graphophone Company]], outside North America.

This was not something that changed at a certain date, but rather, pressing plants were told to use up the stock of old (pre-CBS) labels first, resulting in a mixture of labels for some given releases. Some are known with the CBS text on mono albums, and not on stereo of the same album, and vice versa; diggings brought up pressings with the CBS text on one side and not on the other. Many, but certainly not all, of the early numbers with the \"ledge\" variation (i.e., no deep groove), had the small \"CBS\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1700.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 13 (CL 1700-1799/CS 8500-8598) 1961-1962|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> This text would be used on the Columbia labels until June, 1962.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia1800.html|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 14 (CL 1800-1899/CS 8600-8699) 1960-1961|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nColumbia's Mexican unit, Discos Columbia, was renamed Discos CBS.<ref name=\"Inc.1963\"/>\n\nWith the formation of [[CBS Records International]], CBS started establishing its own distribution in the early 1960s, beginning in Australia. In 1960 CBS took over its distributor in Australia and New Zealand, the [[Australian Record Company]] (founded in 1936) including [[Coronet Records]], one of the leading Australian independent recording and distribution companies of the day. The CBS Coronet label was replaced by the CBS label with the 'walking eye' logo in 1963. ARC continued trading under that name until the late 1970s when it formally changed its business name to CBS Australia.\n\n====Mitch Miller on television====\nIn 1961, Columbia's music repertoire was given an enormous boost when [[Mitch Miller]], its A&R manager and bandleader, became the host of the variety series ''[[Sing Along with Mitch]]'' on NBC.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=128957153|title=Remembering Singing Along With Mitch Miller|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en}}</ref> The show was based on Miller's 'folksy' but appealing 'chorus' style performance of popular standards.

His early folk songs were recorded by many acts and became hits for [[Peter, Paul & Mary]] and [[The Turtles]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/picturegalleries/celebritynews/6201418/Peter-Paul-and-Mary-Top-songs-of-all-time.html|title=Peter, Paul and Mary: Top songs of all time|last=Willis|first=Amy|date=2009-09-17|access-date=2017-12-26|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> Some of these cover versions became the foundation of the [[folk rock]] genre. The Byrds achieved their pop breakthrough with a version of Dylan's \"[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]\". In 1965, Dylan's controversial decision to [[Electric Dylan controversy|'go electric']] and work with rock musicians divided his audience but catapulted him to greater commercial success with his 1965 hit single \"[[Like a Rolling Stone]]\". Following his withdrawal from touring in 1966, Dylan recorded a large group of songs with his backing group [[The Band]] which reached other artists as 'demo recordings'. These resulted in hits by [[Manfred Mann]] (\"[[Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)|The Mighty Quinn]]\") and [[Brian Auger]], [[Julie Driscoll]] & Trinity (\"[[This Wheel's On Fire]]\"). Dylan's late 1960s albums ''[[John Wesley Harding (album)|John Wesley Harding]]'' and ''[[Nashville Skyline]]'' became cornerstone recordings of the emergent [[country rock]] genre and influenced The Byrds and [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]].\n\n====Converting mono====\nColumbia's engineering department developed a process for emulating stereo from a mono source. They called this process \"Electronically Rechanneled for Stereo\". In the June 16, 1962, issue of ''Billboard'' magazine (page 5), Columbia announced it would issue \"rechanneled\" versions of greatest hits compilations that had been recorded in mono, including albums by Doris Day, Frankie Laine, Percy Faith, Mitch Miller, Marty Robbins, Dave Brubeck, Miles Davis, and Johnny Mathis.\n\nColumbia's rechanneling process involved a slight time delay and some bass-treble separation between channels. RCA Victor and Capitol (\"[[Duophonic]]\") used similar processes, but the relatively large delay between channels resulted in a sound that has been described by collectors as \"messy\" (Duophonic) or \"garbage can echo\" (RCA Victor). Columbia's rechanneling resulted in a sound similar to reverb, though some found it annoying.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n====Rock and roll====\nWhen the [[British Invasion]] arrived in January 1964, Columbia had no rock musicians on its roster except for [[Dion DiMucci|Dion]], who was signed in 1963 as the label's first major rock star, and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] who were also signed in 1963. The label released a [[merseybeat]] album, ''The Exciting New Liverpool Sound'' (Columbia CL-2172, issued in mono only). [[Terry Melcher]], son of Doris Day, produced the hard driving \"Don't Make My Baby Blue\" for Frankie Laine, who had gone six years without a hit record. The song reached No. 51 on the pop chart and No. 17 on the easy listening chart.\n\nMelcher and [[Bruce Johnston]] discovered and brought to Columbia [[The Rip Chords]], a vocal group consisting of Ernie Bringas and Phil Stewart, and turned it into a rock group through production techniques. The group had hits in \"Here I Stand\", a remake of the song by [[Wade Flemons]], and \"[[Hey Little Cobra]]\". Columbia saw the two recordings as a start to getting into rock and roll. Melcher and Johnston recorded several additional singles for Columbia in 1964 as \"Bruce & Terry\" and later as \"The Rogues\". Melcher produced early albums by [[The Byrds]] and Paul Revere & the Raiders for Columbia while Johnston produced [[The Beach Boys]] for [[Capitol Records]].\n\n====Ascension of Clive Davis====\nWhen Mitch Miller retired in 1965,<ref name=\"Inc.1965\">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7iIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA3|accessdate=July 21, 2013|date=December 11, 1965|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|page=3|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> Columbia was at a turning point. Miller's disdain for rock and roll and pop rock had dominated Columbia's A&R policy. The label's only significant \"pop\" acts at the time were Bob Dylan, The Byrds, Paul Revere & The Raiders and [[Simon & Garfunkel]]. In its catalogue were other genres: classical, jazz and country, along with a select group of R&B artists, among them [[Aretha Franklin]].<ref name=\"bsn17\" /> Most historians noted that Columbia had problems marketing Franklin as a major talent in the R&B genre, which led to her leaving the label for [[Atlantic Records]] in 1967.<ref>{{Gilliland|https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19834/m1|Show 52 \u2013 The Soul Reformation: Phase three, soul music at the summit.

Sales of Broadway soundtracks and Mitch Miller's singalong series were waning. Pretax earnings had flattened to about $5 million annually.<ref name=\"hitmen\" /> Following the appointment of Davis, the Columbia label became more of a rock music label, thanks mainly to Davis's fortuitous decision to attend the [[Monterey International Pop Festival]], where he spotted and signed several leading acts including [[Janis Joplin]]. Joplin led the way for several generations of female rock and rollers. However, Columbia/CBS still had a hand in traditional pop and jazz and one of its key acquisitions during this period was [[Barbra Streisand]]. She released her first solo album on Columbia in 1963 and remains with the label to this day. Additionally, the label kept \nMiles Davis on the roster, and his late 1960s recordings, ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' and ''[[Bitches Brew]]'', pioneered a [[Jazz fusion|fusion of jazz and rock music]].<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/bitches-brew-r106167/review| title = Bitches Brew| author = Jurek, Thom| accessdate = April 11, 2012| publisher = Allmusic.com}}</ref>\n\nA San Francisco group called [[Moby Grape]] had been gaining popularity on the West Coast, and were signed by Davis in 1967. As a way of introducing them to the world with a splash, they released [[Moby Grape (album)|their debut album]], along with five singles from the album, all on the same day, June 6, 1967, 23 years following [[D-Day]]. The album hit made #24 on the [[Billboard 200]], but the singles barely made a dent in the charts, the best performer being \"Omaha,\" which lasted a mere three weeks on the Hot 100 reaching only No. 88. The other charter, \"Hey Grandma,\" only reached the Bubbling Under chart and faded within a week. Also, there were some complaints about the obscene gesture made to the American flag on the front cover that had to be edited out on the second pressing, not to mention that the group started to decline in sales after that. The return on all the promotional budget for the singles realized nothing. Although the group made two more albums, this particular publicity stunt was never again attempted by Columbia or any other major label.\n\n====Simon & Garfunkel====\nArguably the most commercially successful Columbia pop act of this period, other than Bob Dylan, was Simon & Garfunkel. The duo scored a surprise No. 1 hit in 1965 when CBS producer [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]], inspired by the folk-rock experiments of The Byrds and others, added drums and bass to the duo's earlier recording of \"[[The Sound of Silence]]\" without their knowledge or approval. Indeed, the duo had already broken up some months earlier, discouraged by the poor sales of their debut LP, and [[Paul Simon]] had relocated to the UK, where he famously only found out about the single being a hit via the music press. The dramatic success of the song prompted Simon to return to the US; the duo reformed, and they soon became one of the flagship acts of the [[folk-rock]] boom of the mid-1960s. Their next album, ''[[Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme]]'', went to No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. The duo subsequently had a Top 20 single, \"[[A Hazy Shade of Winter]]\", but progress slowed during 1966-67 as Simon struggled with writer's block and the demands of constant touring. They shot back to the top in 1968 after Simon agreed to write songs for the [[Mike Nichols]] film ''[[The Graduate]]''. The resulting single, \"[[Mrs. Robinson]]\", became a smash hit. Both ''The Graduate'' soundtrack and Simon & Garfunkel's next studio album, ''[[Bookends (album)|Bookends]]'', were major hits on the album chart, with combined total sales in excess of five million copies. Simon and Garfunkel's fifth and final studio album, ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]'' (1970), reached number one in the US album charts in January 1970 and became one of the most successful albums of all time.<ref name=\"bridge\">{{cite web|last1=Eder|first1=Bruce|title=Bridge Over Troubled Water|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bridge-over-troubled-water-mw0000191730|website=AllMusic|accessdate=11 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Hoyt Axton and Tom Rush====\nDavis lured artists [[Hoyt Axton]] and [[Tom Rush]] to Columbia in 1969, and both were given what was known as \"the pop treatment\" by the label. Hoyt Axton had been a folk/blues singer-songwriter since the early 1960s, when he made several albums for [[Horizon Records|Horizon]], then [[Vee-Jay Records|Vee-Jay]]. By the time he joined Columbia, he had mixed successful pop songs like \"[[Greenback Dollar]],\" with hard rock songs for [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]], such as \"[[The Pusher]]\", which was used in the film ''[[Easy Rider]]'' in the same year. When he landed at Columbia, his album ''My Griffin Is Gone'' was described as \"the poster child for 'overproduced,' full of all kinds of instruments and even strings\".<ref name=\"bsn27\">{{cite web|last1=Watts|first1=Randy|last2=Callahan|first2=Mike|last3=Edwards|first3=David|last4=Eyries|first4=Patrice|title=Columbia Album Discography, Part 27 (K)CS 9000-9999 (1969-1970)|url=http://bsnpubs.com/columbia/columbia12/columbia3100.html|website=Bsnpubs.com|accessdate=29 June 2017}}</ref> After that album, Axton left and joined Capitol Records, where his next albums contained \"[[Joy to the World (Three Dog Night song)|Joy to the World]]\" and \"[[Never Been to Spain]],\" which became hits for [[Three Dog Night]] on [[Dunhill Records|Dunhill]]. Axton eventually became a country singer, and founded his own record label, Jeremiah.\n\nTom Rush had always been the \"storyteller\" or \"balladeer\" type of folk artist, before and after his stint with Columbia, to which Rush was lured from [[Elektra Records|Elektra]]. As with Axton, Rush was given \"the treatment\" on [[Tom Rush (1970 album)|his self-titled Columbia debut]]. The multitude of instruments added to his usual solo guitar were all done \"tastefully\", of course, but was not really on par with Rush's audience expectations. He commented to record label historian Mike Callahan: {{cquote|Well, when you're in the studio, they bring out all these \"sweeteners\" and things they have, and while you're there, you say, yeah, that sounds good. But then you get the album home and you almost can't hear yourself under all that.<ref name=\"bsn27\" />}} Eventually, Rush returned to his usual sound (which he applied to his [[Wrong End of the Rainbow|next]] [[Merrimack County (album)|three]] [[Ladies Love Outlaws (Tom Rush album)|albums]] for Columbia) and has been playing to appreciative audiences ever since.\n\n===The 1970s===\n====Catalog numbers====\nThe Columbia album series began in 1951 with album GL-500 (CL-500) and reached an awkward milestone in 1970, when the stereo numbering sequence reached CS-9999, assigned to the [[Patti Page]] album ''Honey Come Back''. This presented a catalog numbering system challenge as Columbia had used a four-digit catalog number for 13 years, and CS-10000 seemed cumbersome. Columbia decided to start issuing albums at CS-1000 instead, preserving the four-digit catalog number. However, this resulted in the reuse of numbers previously used in 1957-58, although the prefix was now different. In July, 1970, the cataloging department implemented a new system, combining all their labels into a unified catalog numbering system starting with 30000, with the prefix letter indicating the label: C=Columbia, E=[[Epic Records|Epic]], M=[[Columbia Masterworks]], Y=[[Odyssey Records|Columbia Odyssey]], and Z=every other label that CBS distributed.  The prefix letter G was also used for two album sets\u2014or the number of records in the set after the label letter, such as KC2).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaldogproductions.info/c/cbs-lps-us.html|title=CBS LPs - US unified numbering system|website=Globaldogproductions.info|accessdate=July 2, 2018}}</ref> The first CBS album released under the new system was [[Elvin Bishop|The Elvin Bishop Group]]'s self-titled album on Fillmore Records, assigned with 30001, while the first actual Columbia release under the system was [[Herschel Bernardi]]'s ''Show Stopper'', assigned with C 30004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globaldogproductions.info/c/cbs-us-30000-30499.html|title=LP Discography for CBS Records US combined numbering system 30000-30499|website=Globaldogproductions.info|accessdate=May 5, 2019}}</ref> The highest catalog number released in the old system was CS-1069, assigned to ''[[Sesame Street discography|The Sesame Street Book and Record]]''. Chronologically, Columbia issued at least one album in this series in August, but by that time, the CBS Consolidated 30000 series, which started issuing albums in July with the new label design, was well underway, having issued nearly 100 albums. The system was later expanded with even more prefix letters, which continued until 2005.\n\n====Quadraphonics====\nIn September 1970, under the guidance of [[Clive Davis]], Columbia Records entered the West Coast rock market, opening a state-of-the art recording studio (which was located at 827 Folsom St. in San Francisco and later morphed into the [[Automatt]]) and establishing an A&R head and office in San Francisco at [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]], headed by [[George Daly (Music Industry)|George Daly]], a producer and artist for [[Monument Records]] (who inked a distribution deal with Columbia at the time) and a former bandmate of [[Nils Lofgren]] and [[Roy Buchanan]]. The recording studio operated under CBS until 1978.<ref>{{cite book |title=If These Halls Could Talk: A Historical Tour Through San Francisco Recording Studios |url=https://archive.org/details/ifthesehallscoul00heat |url-access=registration |last=Johnson |first=Heather |publisher=Thomson Course Technology |year=2006 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/ifthesehallscoul00heat/page/n104 90]\u201394 |isbn=1-59863-141-1}}</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1970s, Columbia began recording in a four-channel process called [[quadraphonic]], using the \"SQ\" (Stereo Quadraphonic) standard that used an electronic encoding process that could be decoded by special amplifiers and then played through four speakers, with each speaker placed in the corner of a room. Remarkably, RCA countered with another quadraphonic process that required a special cartridge to play the \"discrete\" recordings for four-channel playback. Both Columbia and RCA's quadraphonic records could be played on conventional stereo equipment. Although the Columbia process required less equipment and was quite effective, many were confused by the competing systems and sales of both Columbia's matrix recordings and RCA's discrete recordings were disappointing. A few other companies also issued some matrix recordings for a few years. Quadraphonic recording was used by both classical artists, including [[Leonard Bernstein]] and [[Pierre Boulez]], and popular artists such as [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Ray Conniff]], [[Carlos Santana]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[The Clash]] and [[Blue \u00d6yster Cult]]. Columbia even released a soundtrack album of the movie version of ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]'' in quadraphonic. Many of these recordings were later remastered and released in Dolby surround sound on CD.\n\n====Yetnikoff becomes president====\nIn 1975, Walter Yetnikoff was promoted to become President of Columbia Records, and his vacated position as President of CBS Records International was filled by Dick Asher. At this point, according to music historian Frederic Dannen, the  shy and introverted Yetnikoff began to transform his personality, becoming (in Asher's words) \"wild, menacing, crude, and above all, very loud\". In Dannen's view, Yetnikoff was probably over-compensating for his naturally sensitive and generous personality, and that he had little hope of being recognised as a \"record man\" (someone with a musical ear and an intuitive understanding of current trends and artists' intentions) because he was tone-deaf, so he instead determined to become a \"colourful character\".<ref>Dannen, ''op cit'', p.19</ref> Yetnikoff soon became notorious for his violent temper and regular tantrums: \"He shattered glassware, spewed a mixture of Yiddish and barnyard epithets, and had people physically ejected from the CBS building.\"<ref>Dannen, ''op cit'', p.21</ref>\n\nIn 1976, Columbia Records of Canada was renamed CBS Records Canada Ltd.<ref name=ce /> The Columbia label continued to be used by CBS Canada, but the CBS label was introduced for [[French language|French-language]] recordings. On May 5, 1979, Columbia Masterworks began [[digital recording]] in a recording session of [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]'s ''[[Petrouchka]]'' by the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]], conducted by [[Zubin Mehta]], in New York (using [[3M]]'s 32-channel multitrack digital recorder).\n\n====Dick Asher vs \"The Network\"====\n{{More citations needed section|date=June 2017}}\nCBS Records had a popular roster of musicians. It distributed [[Philadelphia International Records]], [[Blue Sky Records]], the [[Isley Brothers]]' [[T-Neck Records]] and [[Monument Records]] (from 1971 to 1976). But the music industry was in financial decline. Total sales fell by 11%, the biggest drop since World War II. In 1979 CBS had a pre-tax income of $51 million and sales of over $1 billion. The label laid off hundreds of employees.\n\nTo deal with the crisis, CEO [[John Backe]] promoted [[Dick Asher]] from Vice President of Business Affairs to Deputy President. Charged with cutting costs and restoring profits, Asher was reportedly reluctant to take on the role. He was worried that Yetnikoff would resent his promotion. But Backe had confidence in Asher's experience. In 1972 Asher had turned the British division of CBS from loss to profit. Backe considered him to be honest and trustworthy, and he appealed to Asher's loyalty to the company. Employees at CBS thought Asher was a bore and an interloper. He cut back on expenses and on perks like limousines and restaurants. His relationship with Yetnikoff deteriorated.\n\nAsher became increasingly concerned about the huge and rapidly growing cost of hiring independent agents, who were paid to promote new singles to radio station program directors. \"Indies\" had been used by record labels for many years to promote new releases, but as he methodically delved into CBS Records' expenses, Asher was dismayed to discover that hiring these independent promoters was now costing CBS alone as much as $10 million per year. When Asher took over CBS' UK division in 1972, a freelance promoter might only charge $100 per week, but by 1979 the top American independent promoters had organized themselves into a loose collective known as \"The Network\", and their fees were now running into the tens millions of dollars per year, Music historian [[Frederic Dannen]] estimates that by 1980 the major labels were paying anywhere from to $100,000 to $300,000 ''per song'' to the \"Network\" promoters, and that it was costing the industry as whole as much as $80 million annually.\n\nDuring this period, Columbia scored a Top 40 hit with the [[Pink Floyd]] single \"[[Another Brick In The Wall]]\", and its parent album ''[[The Wall]]'' would spend four months at No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' LP chart in early 1980, but few in the industry knew that Dick Asher was in fact using the single as a covert experiment to test the extent of the pernicious influence of The Network - by ''not'' paying them to promote the new Pink Floyd single. The results were immediate and deeply troubling - not one of the major radio stations in Los Angeles would program the record, despite the fact that the group was in town, performing the first seven concerts on their elaborate [[The Wall Tour (1980\u201381)|The Wall Tour]] at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena]] to rave reviews and sold-out crowds. Asher was already worried about the growing power of The Network, and the fact it operated entirely outside the control of the label, but he was profoundly dismayed to realize that \"The Network\" was in effect a huge [[extortion]] racket, and that the operation could well be linked to organized crime - a concern vehemently dismissed by Yetnikoff, who resolutely defended the \"indies\" and declared them to be \"mensches\". But Dick Asher now knew that The Network's real power lay in their ability to ''prevent'' records from being picked up by radio, and as an experienced media lawyer and a loyal CBS employee, he was also acutely aware that this could become a new [[payola]] scandal which had the potential to engulf the entire CBS corporation, and that the Federal Communications Commission could even revoke CBS' all-important broadcast licenses if the corporation was found to be involved in any illegality.<ref>Dannen, Frederic, ''Hit Men: Power Brokers and Fast Money Inside The Music Business'', Vintage Books, 1991 ({{ISBN|0099813106}}), pp. 4-27</ref>\n\n===The 1980s and sale to Sony===\n\nThe structure of US Columbia remained the same until 1980, when it spun off the classical/Broadway unit, Columbia Masterworks Records, into a separate imprint, CBS Masterworks Records.\n\nIn 1988, the CBS Records Group, including the Columbia Records unit, was acquired by [[Sony]], which re-christened the parent division [[Sony Music Entertainment]] in 1991.

It was used by several denominations over the next seventy years, then briefly became a radio studio in the late 1940s before being leased by CBS in 1952 and converted into a state-of-the-art recording studio. The 30th Street Studio had unique sonic characteristics, thanks to its soaring one-hundred-foot vaulted ceiling, exposed timber beams, plaster walls and unvarnished wooden floor. When Columbia took over the property, then head of A&R [[Mitch Miller]] (a musician himself) recognised its singular acoustic properties and declared that the hall was to be left \"untouched by human hands\". He posted detailed standing orders to all staff to control the maintenance and cleaning of the space, even down to the changing of light bulbs, ordering that the curtains and other fittings were never to be touched, that no painting was allowed, and especially that the wooden floor could only be swept or vacuumed, and was never under any circumstances to be mopped with water, for fear that this might alter the room's resonant and reflective properties.<ref>Milner, Greg, ''Perfecting Sound Forever: The Story of recorded Music'', Granta Books, London, 2009 ({{ISBN|978-1-84708-140-7}}), p. 149</ref> CBS never took up the option to buy the building outright and it gave up its lease and closed the studio in 1982. In spite of the building's inherent heritage status and its cultural significance, it was sold to developers in 1985, demolished, and replaced by a high-rise apartment complex.\n\n; Liederkranz Hall Studio\nColumbia also recorded in the highly respected Liederkranz Hall, at 111 East 58th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, in New York City, it was  built by and formerly belonged to a German cultural and musical society, [[Liederkranz of the City of New York|The Liederkranz Society]], and used as a recording studio ([[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]] also recorded in Liederkranz Hall in the late 1920s).<ref name=\"SIMONS\"/><ref>[http://www.liederkranznycity.org/history.asp \"History of The Liederkranz of the City of New York\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727031333/http://www.liederkranznycity.org/history.asp |date=July 27, 2011 }} - The Liederkranz of the City of New York website.

The different areas of web design include web graphic design; [[interface design]]; authoring, including standardised code and [[proprietary software]]; [[user experience design]]; and [[search engine optimization]]. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process, although some designers will cover them all.<ref name=\"different jobs\" >{{cite web\n  |last=Lester  |first=Georgina\n  |title=Different jobs and responsibilities of various people involved in creating a website\n  |publisher=Arts Wales UK\n  |url=http://www.arts-wales.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=152&Itemid=48\n  |accessdate=2012-03-17\n}}</ref> The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing [[markup language|markup]]. Web design partially overlaps [[web engineering]] in the broader scope of [[web development]]. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of [[Web usability|usability]] and if their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with [[web accessibility]] guidelines.\n\n'''[[Web development]]''' is the work involved in developing a [[web site]] for the [[Internet]] ([[World Wide Web]]) or an [[intranet]] (a private network).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.techopedia.com/definition/23889/web-development|title=What is Web Development? \u2013 Definition from Techopedia|website=Techopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref> Web development can range from developing a simple single [[Static web page|static page]] of [[plain text]] to complex web-based [[internet application]]s (web apps), [[electronic business]]es, and [[social network service]]s. A more comprehensive list of tasks to which web development commonly refers, may include [[web engineering]], [[web design]], [[web content development]], client liaison, [[client-side scripting|client-side]]/[[server-side scripting|server-side]] [[computer programming|scripting]], [[web server]] and [[network security]] configuration, and [[e-commerce]] development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bigorangeplanet.com|title=Denver Web design and develoment Colorado|website=Bigorangeplanet.com|language=en|access-date=2018-12-07}}</ref> \n\nAmong web professionals, \"web development\" usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building web sites: writing [[Markup language|markup]] and [[Computer programming|coding]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Web Design: Introductory|last=Campbell|first=Jennifer|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=27}}</ref> Web development may use [[Content management system|content management systems]] (CMS) to make content changes easier and available with basic technical skills.\n\nFor larger organizations and businesses, web development teams can consist of hundreds of people ([[web developer]]s) and follow standard methods like [[Agile software development|Agile methodologies]] while developing websites. Smaller organizations may only require a single permanent or contracting developer, or secondary assignment to related job positions such as a [[graphic designer]] or [[information systems]] technician. Web development may be a collaborative effort between departments rather than the domain of a designated department. There are three kinds of web developer specialization: [[Front-end web development|front-end developer]], back-end developer, and [[Full-stack developer|full-stack developer]].

It is part of both the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]] and [[Baltimore Metropolitan Area]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 9,288.Many people have been born in Mount Airy including the favorite son of the laroccos.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US2453875| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Census Summary File 1 (G001), Mount Airy town, Maryland| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau| work=American FactFinder| accessdate=May 27, 2016| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200213083607/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/G001/1600000US2453875| archive-date=February 13, 2020| url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nOutside the town limits, the surrounding countryside is colloquially referred to as Mount Airy or the \"Four-County Area\" by locals. The \"Four-County Area\" derives its name from the fact that the \"Mount Airy\" mailing area encompasses portions of Frederick, Carroll, [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]], and [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard]] counties.\n\n==History==\nThe community was first settled in 1830 and continued to develop throughout the decade, beginning with the construction of house settlements along Parr's Ridge. A man named Henry Bussard built the first of these houses. This town was known for its [[train station]] on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) at Parr's Ridge. The railroad ran from [[Baltimore]] to [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], cities to the east and west, respectively, of Mt. Airy. Following 1830, the town received its official name after the suggestion of \"Mount Airy\" from an Irish B&O worker who complained about his freezing ears on a windy work day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountairymd.org/233/Town-History|title=Town History {{!}} Mount Airy, MD|website=www.mountairymd.org|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref> Over the years, [[miller|milling]], [[canning]] and [[sewing]] industries initially helped support Mt. Airy's economy.\n\nThe town's proximity to the [[National Road]] contributed to its growth. The National Road ran west from Baltimore to [[Illinois]]. By the 1890s, the town's growth had increased significantly and three new churches were built (one [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] and two [[Methodism|Methodist]]), along with a very important bridge, still standing and known by residents as the Twin Arch, that helped with railroad transportation. Three great fires (1903, 1914, and 1925) caused setbacks in growth, but the town rebuilt every time.\n\nWhen Carroll County defined its permanent boundaries in 1837, Mount Airy was divided between two counties, Carroll and Frederick; the town has remained in two counties since that time. About one mile south of the town is the junction of Carroll, Frederick, Howard and Montgomery counties at the source of the South Branch of the [[Patapsco River]].\n\nThe town was originally settled in the early 1830s by a core group of six families. Dorsey, Davis and Bussard were the most prominent names in that first settlement, which was followed closely by the construction of the B & O railroad line in 1831. Because Mount Airy sits at an elevation of {{convert|830|ft}}, a series of four [[inclined plane]]s were constructed in order for the trains to climb the steep hills. Locomotives and cars were lifted with the assistance of horses and steam winches. Passengers had to disembark during this process. Plane #4, located west of the town at the intersection of Woodville Road and [[Maryland Route 144|MD Route 144]], is still a recognized location today. In 1839 the planes were abandoned, and the new line was constructed north of where Mount Airy is today. This was a result of more powerful locomotives that had been constructed and heavier loads were being hauled. In 1901, a railroad tunnel was constructed on the south side of town and the existing line into town became a spur line into the center of Mount Airy. The town named the first resident, Henry Bussard, the station agent for the new train station. Mr. Bussard was the first major landowner in Mount Airy.\n\nBy 1846, the town was sparsely settled with several houses, a store, barber shop and shoemaker shop. Pine Grove Chapel, circa 1846, now a historic monument, was constructed to fill the need for a community church. From the time it was constructed, the chapel basement functioned as a private school. The chapel remained open during the early part of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] despite soldier encampments in proximity. The school and church were closed later because of distracting soldier activity around the vicinity of the school. After the war ended, the church reopened in 1867 after undergoing a renovation.\n\nIn 1893, the Carroll County Board of Education funded the construction of a three-room schoolhouse which was completed in September 1894. The building, approximately {{convert|1700|sqft}} in size, was located on the east side of Main Street, 1/4 mile south of the railroad tracks. It is now part of the Calvary United Methodist Church property. The school operated from 9:00 am to 4:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\nWith the incorporation of the town in 1894 came the establishment of the town government structure, including a mayor and council. The first Mount Airy mayor was Byron S. Dorsey, who served ten years in that office between 1894 and 1904. In 1900, the town population had grown to 332 residents. By 1910, the town population was 428, and it was determined that the town had enough student population to justify a state-accredited high school. A high school with classes was organized, but an official high school building to house all eleven grades was not constructed at that time.\n\nThe town of Mount Airy endured three disastrous fires during the first quarter of the 20th century. The first fire occurred in 1902 and destroyed the business section of the southern side of the downtown area. The second fire was in 1914 and consumed the north side of the downtown business section. The third fire took place about ten years later, in 1925, and again, the northern side of the downtown business district was destroyed. As a result of the 1925 fire, the Mount Airy Volunteer Fire Company was organized in 1926.\n\nDuring the late 1920s and early 1930s the town continued to flourish despite the onset of the Great Depression. The 1930 U.S. Census tallied the town population at 845 persons, an increase of 91 people since 1920. The railroad company largely contributed to the growth of not only the population, but the town's economy as well. As a result, expanded town services included necessary public utilities such as electric service when Potomac Edison was established in Mount Airy. The thriving economy supported the initiation of several large businesses in the 1930s, such as a poultry operation, two automobile garages, an ice factory, and the creation of the Mount Airy Canning Company, which provided about 250 jobs. In 1932, the first motion picture theater opened in Mount Airy, establishing a core business district. During that time, the town also saw the purchase of land for a town park, the opening of a grocery store and a lumberyard, and the dedication of Pine Grove Chapel for use as a [[nonsectarian]] chapel.\n\nThe [[Mount Airy Historic District (Mount Airy, Maryland)|Mount Airy Historic District]] that includes the railroad station was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2008a}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, Mt. Airy is no longer economically dependent on the railroad, as citizens work a variety of different jobs. Many of its citizens work in [[Washington, DC]], or [[Baltimore]]; the city is a part of both of those cities' metropolitan areas. Mt. Airy is a neighborhood community for these job centers. Mt. Airy is similar to back in the day with the National Road but now with Interstate 70 bordering the southern end of the city with an interchange with MD-27. In the last few decades Mount Airy has seen significant growth, as laid out in the Mount Airy Master Plan from the 1994 to 2003 update. In 2007 President [[George W.

Mount Airy's Main Street, formerly MD 27 and now [[Maryland Route 808]], runs atop Parrs Ridge in a northeast\u2013southwest direction with elevations ranging between {{convert|800|and|850|ft}}. Numerous valleys that extend outward toward the east and west from this ridge give the town its unusually hilly topography. Mount Airy straddles the division of two major drainage basins. Within the Frederick County portion of the town are the headwaters of Woodville Branch and Ben's Branch which are parts of the [[Linganore Creek]] watershed, as well as the headwaters of Bush Creek in the southwestern part of the town. The Linganore watershed drains into Lake Linganore, a secondary source of public water for Frederick County. The Linganore and Bush Creek watersheds are part of the Lower [[Monocacy River]] watershed, with eventual drainage to the [[Potomac River]]. The east side of Mount Airy drains via tributaries of Middle Run and the South Branch of the [[Patapsco River]] to [[Port of Baltimore|Baltimore Harbor]]. Both the Potomac and the Patapsco are part of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] watershed.\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the town of Mount Airy has a total area of {{convert|10.70|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|10.67|sqkm|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqkm|order=flip|2}}, or 0.29%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n===Transportation===\n[[File:2019-05-20 12 17 52 View west along Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 40 (Baltimore National Pike) at Exit 68 (Maryland State Route 27, Damascus, Mount Airy) in Mount Airy, Carroll County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|The exit for Mount Airy along I-70/US 40]]\nThe primary means of travel to and from Mount Airy are by road. The most prominent highway serving the town is [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|Interstate 70]] and [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|U.S. Route 40]], which forms the southern border of Mount Airy and leads east {{convert|32|mi}} to [[Baltimore]] and west {{convert|14|mi}} to [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]]. [[Maryland Route 27]] (Ridge Road) runs through the east side of the town, leading northeast {{convert|16|mi}} to [[Westminster, Maryland|Westminster]], the Carroll County seat, and southwest {{Convert|14|mi}} to [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]] in [[Germantown, Maryland|Germantown]]. [[Maryland Route 808]] follows the original route of Maryland Route 27 through downtown Mount Airy.\n\n===Climate===\nMount Airy is similar to Westminster in its position astride Parrs Ridge, and has a humid, temperate climate, more specifically a [[humid subtropical climate]] falling short of a [[humid continental climate]], with four rather well defined seasons. The general atmospheric flow is from west to east but alternate surges of cold air from the north and of warm humid air from the south occurs in the area, causing highly variable weather. Nearness to the Atlantic Coast allows coastal storms to make up any deficiency of precipitation resulting from the passage of weather systems over the mountains to the west.\n\nThe average annual temperature is approximately 54 degrees, with January generally the coldest month and July the warmest. Temperatures exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit an average of 27 days a year. The Town of Mount Airy is in the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 7a for an annual extreme minimum temperature of 0-5 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe average annual precipitation totals about 45 inches, with February the driest and August the wettest month. During the growing season, which averages about 177 days from April through to September, the last part of July through to the first part of August is the driest, with an average of 85-90 degrees.\n\nThe average seasonal snowfall is 28 inches.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Mount Airy, Maryland\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F = 77\n|Feb record high F = 79\n|Mar record high F = 85\n|Apr record high F = 93\n|May record high F = 96\n|Jun record high F = 100\n|Jul record high F = 103\n|Aug record high F = 103\n|Sep record high F = 103\n|Oct record high F = 92\n|Nov record high F = 83\n|Dec record high F = 78\n|year record high F = 103\n|Jan high F = 40\n|Feb high F = 44\n|Mar high F = 54\n|Apr high F = 65\n|May high F = 74\n|Jun high F = 83\n|Jul high F = 87\n|Aug high F = 85\n|Sep high F = 78\n|Oct high F = 67\n|Nov high F = 55\n|Dec high F = 44\n|year high F = 64.7\n|Jan low F = 20\n|Feb low F = 22\n|Mar low F = 30\n|Apr low F = 38\n|May low F = 48\n|Jun low F = 57\n|Jul low F = 62\n|Aug low F = 60\n|Sep low F = 53\n|Oct low F = 41\n|Nov low F = 32\n|Dec low F = 25\n|year low F = 40.7\n|Jan record low F = -22\n|Feb record low F = -20\n|Mar record low F = -9\n|Apr record low F = 15\n|May record low F = 25\n|Jun record low F = 33\n|Jul record low F = 39\n|Aug record low F = 35\n|Sep record low F = 26\n|Oct record low F = 14\n|Nov record low F = 5\n|Dec record low F = -12\n|year record low F = -22\n|Jan precipitation inch = 3.37\n|Feb precipitation inch = 2.62\n|Mar precipitation inch = 3.63\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.38\n|May precipitation inch = 4.16\n|Jun precipitation inch = 4.31\n|Jul precipitation inch = 3.53\n|Aug precipitation inch = 3.22\n|Sep precipitation inch = 3.87\n|Oct precipitation inch = 3.49\n|Nov precipitation inch = 3.63\n|Dec precipitation inch = 3.19\n|year precipitation inch = 42.40\n|Jan snow inch =  9.8\n|Feb snow inch = 10.1\n|Mar snow inch =  3.2\n|Apr snow inch =   .2\n|May snow inch =    0\n|Jun snow inch =    0\n|Jul snow inch =    0\n|Aug snow inch =    0\n|Sep snow inch =    0\n|Oct snow inch =   .1\n|Nov snow inch =   .9\n|Dec snow inch =  3.7\n|year snow inch= 28.0\n|source 1 = [[The Weather Channel]]<ref name=TWC>{{cite web | url =\nhttp://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/grph/21771 | title = Average Weather for Mount Airy, MD - Temperature and precipitation | publisher=The Weather Channel | accessdate=November 14, 2014}}</ref>\n|date=November 2014\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 91\n|1900= 332\n|1910= 428\n|1920= 754\n|1930= 860\n|1940= 791\n|1950= 1061\n|1960= 1352\n|1970= 1825\n|1980= 2450\n|1990= 3730\n|2000= 6425\n|2010= 9288\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=9452\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"wwwcensusgov\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census website|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref> of 2010, there were 9,288 people, 3,107 households, and 2,453 families residing in the city.

The \"Four-County Area\" derives its name from the fact that the \"Mount Airy\" mailing area encompasses portions of Frederick, Carroll, [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]], and [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard]] counties.\n\n==History==\nThe community was first settled in 1830 and continued to develop throughout the decade, beginning with the construction of house settlements along Parr's Ridge. A man named Henry Bussard built the first of these houses. This town was known for its [[train station]] on the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) at Parr's Ridge. The railroad ran from [[Baltimore]] to [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], cities to the east and west, respectively, of Mt. Airy. Following 1830, the town received its official name after the suggestion of \"Mount Airy\" from an Irish B&O worker who complained about his freezing ears on a windy work day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mountairymd.org/233/Town-History|title=Town History {{!}} Mount Airy, MD|website=www.mountairymd.org|access-date=2019-02-07}}</ref> Over the years, [[miller|milling]], [[canning]] and [[sewing]] industries initially helped support Mt. Airy's economy.\n\nThe town's proximity to the [[National Road]] contributed to its growth. The National Road ran west from Baltimore to [[Illinois]]. By the 1890s, the town's growth had increased significantly and three new churches were built (one [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] and two [[Methodism|Methodist]]), along with a very important bridge, still standing and known by residents as the Twin Arch, that helped with railroad transportation. Three great fires (1903, 1914, and 1925) caused setbacks in growth, but the town rebuilt every time.\n\nWhen Carroll County defined its permanent boundaries in 1837, Mount Airy was divided between two counties, Carroll and Frederick; the town has remained in two counties since that time. About one mile south of the town is the junction of Carroll, Frederick, Howard and Montgomery counties at the source of the South Branch of the [[Patapsco River]].\n\nThe town was originally settled in the early 1830s by a core group of six families. Dorsey, Davis and Bussard were the most prominent names in that first settlement, which was followed closely by the construction of the B & O railroad line in 1831. Because Mount Airy sits at an elevation of {{convert|830|ft}}, a series of four [[inclined plane]]s were constructed in order for the trains to climb the steep hills. Locomotives and cars were lifted with the assistance of horses and steam winches. Passengers had to disembark during this process. Plane #4, located west of the town at the intersection of Woodville Road and [[Maryland Route 144|MD Route 144]], is still a recognized location today. In 1839 the planes were abandoned, and the new line was constructed north of where Mount Airy is today. This was a result of more powerful locomotives that had been constructed and heavier loads were being hauled. In 1901, a railroad tunnel was constructed on the south side of town and the existing line into town became a spur line into the center of Mount Airy. The town named the first resident, Henry Bussard, the station agent for the new train station. Mr. Bussard was the first major landowner in Mount Airy.\n\nBy 1846, the town was sparsely settled with several houses, a store, barber shop and shoemaker shop. Pine Grove Chapel, circa 1846, now a historic monument, was constructed to fill the need for a community church. From the time it was constructed, the chapel basement functioned as a private school. The chapel remained open during the early part of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] despite soldier encampments in proximity. The school and church were closed later because of distracting soldier activity around the vicinity of the school. After the war ended, the church reopened in 1867 after undergoing a renovation.\n\nIn 1893, the Carroll County Board of Education funded the construction of a three-room schoolhouse which was completed in September 1894. The building, approximately {{convert|1700|sqft}} in size, was located on the east side of Main Street, 1/4 mile south of the railroad tracks. It is now part of the Calvary United Methodist Church property. The school operated from 9:00 am to 4:00&nbsp;p.m.\n\nWith the incorporation of the town in 1894 came the establishment of the town government structure, including a mayor and council. The first Mount Airy mayor was Byron S. Dorsey, who served ten years in that office between 1894 and 1904. In 1900, the town population had grown to 332 residents. By 1910, the town population was 428, and it was determined that the town had enough student population to justify a state-accredited high school. A high school with classes was organized, but an official high school building to house all eleven grades was not constructed at that time.\n\nThe town of Mount Airy endured three disastrous fires during the first quarter of the 20th century. The first fire occurred in 1902 and destroyed the business section of the southern side of the downtown area. The second fire was in 1914 and consumed the north side of the downtown business section. The third fire took place about ten years later, in 1925, and again, the northern side of the downtown business district was destroyed. As a result of the 1925 fire, the Mount Airy Volunteer Fire Company was organized in 1926.\n\nDuring the late 1920s and early 1930s the town continued to flourish despite the onset of the Great Depression. The 1930 U.S. Census tallied the town population at 845 persons, an increase of 91 people since 1920. The railroad company largely contributed to the growth of not only the population, but the town's economy as well. As a result, expanded town services included necessary public utilities such as electric service when Potomac Edison was established in Mount Airy. The thriving economy supported the initiation of several large businesses in the 1930s, such as a poultry operation, two automobile garages, an ice factory, and the creation of the Mount Airy Canning Company, which provided about 250 jobs. In 1932, the first motion picture theater opened in Mount Airy, establishing a core business district. During that time, the town also saw the purchase of land for a town park, the opening of a grocery store and a lumberyard, and the dedication of Pine Grove Chapel for use as a [[nonsectarian]] chapel.\n\nThe [[Mount Airy Historic District (Mount Airy, Maryland)|Mount Airy Historic District]] that includes the railroad station was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1984.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2008a}}</ref>\n\nCurrently, Mt. Airy is no longer economically dependent on the railroad, as citizens work a variety of different jobs. Many of its citizens work in [[Washington, DC]], or [[Baltimore]]; the city is a part of both of those cities' metropolitan areas. Mt. Airy is a neighborhood community for these job centers. Mt. Airy is similar to back in the day with the National Road but now with Interstate 70 bordering the southern end of the city with an interchange with MD-27. In the last few decades Mount Airy has seen significant growth, as laid out in the Mount Airy Master Plan from the 1994 to 2003 update. In 2007 President [[George W. Bush]] made a speech in Mount Airy.\n\nMt. Airy hosts townwide events each year including the Main Street Chili Cookoff, Celebrate Mount Airy in August, Mount Airy Oktoberfest in September, and A Main Street Christmas in December.

Mount Airy's Main Street, formerly MD 27 and now [[Maryland Route 808]], runs atop Parrs Ridge in a northeast\u2013southwest direction with elevations ranging between {{convert|800|and|850|ft}}. Numerous valleys that extend outward toward the east and west from this ridge give the town its unusually hilly topography. Mount Airy straddles the division of two major drainage basins. Within the Frederick County portion of the town are the headwaters of Woodville Branch and Ben's Branch which are parts of the [[Linganore Creek]] watershed, as well as the headwaters of Bush Creek in the southwestern part of the town. The Linganore watershed drains into Lake Linganore, a secondary source of public water for Frederick County. The Linganore and Bush Creek watersheds are part of the Lower [[Monocacy River]] watershed, with eventual drainage to the [[Potomac River]]. The east side of Mount Airy drains via tributaries of Middle Run and the South Branch of the [[Patapsco River]] to [[Port of Baltimore|Baltimore Harbor]]. Both the Potomac and the Patapsco are part of the [[Chesapeake Bay]] watershed.\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the town of Mount Airy has a total area of {{convert|10.70|sqkm|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|10.67|sqkm|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|0.03|sqkm|order=flip|2}}, or 0.29%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n===Transportation===\n[[File:2019-05-20 12 17 52 View west along Interstate 70 and U.S. Route 40 (Baltimore National Pike) at Exit 68 (Maryland State Route 27, Damascus, Mount Airy) in Mount Airy, Carroll County, Maryland.jpg|thumb|right|The exit for Mount Airy along I-70/US 40]]\nThe primary means of travel to and from Mount Airy are by road. The most prominent highway serving the town is [[Interstate 70 in Maryland|Interstate 70]] and [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|U.S. Route 40]], which forms the southern border of Mount Airy and leads east {{convert|32|mi}} to [[Baltimore]] and west {{convert|14|mi}} to [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]]. [[Maryland Route 27]] (Ridge Road) runs through the east side of the town, leading northeast {{convert|16|mi}} to [[Westminster, Maryland|Westminster]], the Carroll County seat, and southwest {{Convert|14|mi}} to [[Interstate 270 (Maryland)|Interstate 270]] in [[Germantown, Maryland|Germantown]]. [[Maryland Route 808]] follows the original route of Maryland Route 27 through downtown Mount Airy.\n\n===Climate===\nMount Airy is similar to Westminster in its position astride Parrs Ridge, and has a humid, temperate climate, more specifically a [[humid subtropical climate]] falling short of a [[humid continental climate]], with four rather well defined seasons. The general atmospheric flow is from west to east but alternate surges of cold air from the north and of warm humid air from the south occurs in the area, causing highly variable weather. Nearness to the Atlantic Coast allows coastal storms to make up any deficiency of precipitation resulting from the passage of weather systems over the mountains to the west.\n\nThe average annual temperature is approximately 54 degrees, with January generally the coldest month and July the warmest. Temperatures exceed 90 degrees Fahrenheit an average of 27 days a year. The Town of Mount Airy is in the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 7a for an annual extreme minimum temperature of 0-5 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nThe average annual precipitation totals about 45 inches, with February the driest and August the wettest month. During the growing season, which averages about 177 days from April through to September, the last part of July through to the first part of August is the driest, with an average of 85-90 degrees.\n\nThe average seasonal snowfall is 28 inches.\n{{Weather box\n|location = Mount Airy, Maryland\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F = 77\n|Feb record high F = 79\n|Mar record high F = 85\n|Apr record high F = 93\n|May record high F = 96\n|Jun record high F = 100\n|Jul record high F = 103\n|Aug record high F = 103\n|Sep record high F = 103\n|Oct record high F = 92\n|Nov record high F = 83\n|Dec record high F = 78\n|year record high F = 103\n|Jan high F = 40\n|Feb high F = 44\n|Mar high F = 54\n|Apr high F = 65\n|May high F = 74\n|Jun high F = 83\n|Jul high F = 87\n|Aug high F = 85\n|Sep high F = 78\n|Oct high F = 67\n|Nov high F = 55\n|Dec high F = 44\n|year high F = 64.7\n|Jan low F = 20\n|Feb low F = 22\n|Mar low F = 30\n|Apr low F = 38\n|May low F = 48\n|Jun low F = 57\n|Jul low F = 62\n|Aug low F = 60\n|Sep low F = 53\n|Oct low F = 41\n|Nov low F = 32\n|Dec low F = 25\n|year low F = 40.7\n|Jan record low F = -22\n|Feb record low F = -20\n|Mar record low F = -9\n|Apr record low F = 15\n|May record low F = 25\n|Jun record low F = 33\n|Jul record low F = 39\n|Aug record low F = 35\n|Sep record low F = 26\n|Oct record low F = 14\n|Nov record low F = 5\n|Dec record low F = -12\n|year record low F = -22\n|Jan precipitation inch = 3.37\n|Feb precipitation inch = 2.62\n|Mar precipitation inch = 3.63\n|Apr precipitation inch = 3.38\n|May precipitation inch = 4.16\n|Jun precipitation inch = 4.31\n|Jul precipitation inch = 3.53\n|Aug precipitation inch = 3.22\n|Sep precipitation inch = 3.87\n|Oct precipitation inch = 3.49\n|Nov precipitation inch = 3.63\n|Dec precipitation inch = 3.19\n|year precipitation inch = 42.40\n|Jan snow inch =  9.8\n|Feb snow inch = 10.1\n|Mar snow inch =  3.2\n|Apr snow inch =   .2\n|May snow inch =    0\n|Jun snow inch =    0\n|Jul snow inch =    0\n|Aug snow inch =    0\n|Sep snow inch =    0\n|Oct snow inch =   .1\n|Nov snow inch =   .9\n|Dec snow inch =  3.7\n|year snow inch= 28.0\n|source 1 = [[The Weather Channel]]<ref name=TWC>{{cite web | url =\nhttp://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/grph/21771 | title = Average Weather for Mount Airy, MD - Temperature and precipitation | publisher=The Weather Channel | accessdate=November 14, 2014}}</ref>\n|date=November 2014\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 91\n|1900= 332\n|1910= 428\n|1920= 754\n|1930= 860\n|1940= 791\n|1950= 1061\n|1960= 1352\n|1970= 1825\n|1980= 2450\n|1990= 3730\n|2000= 6425\n|2010= 9288\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=9452\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=August 16, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n===2010 census===\nAs of the [[census]]<ref name =\"wwwcensusgov\">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census website|url=https://www.census.gov|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2013-01-25}}</ref> of 2010, there were 9,288 people, 3,107 households, and 2,453 families residing in the city.
