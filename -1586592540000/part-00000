with [[microdialysis]] so that researchers can stimulate genetically identified neurons and also detect the peptides that are released that might be mediating neural circuit changes and behavioral outputs.<ref name=\":8\" />\n\n== Career and research ==\nIn 2017, Al-Hasani was recruited to stay at [[Washington University School of Medicine]], along with her husband Jordan McCall, and take on a primary appointment as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Pharmaceutical and Administrative Sciences at the [[St. Louis College of Pharmacy]] as well as an adjunct appointment as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Anesthesiology at the [[Washington University School of Medicine]] (WUSM).<ref name=\":1\" /> Al-Hasani and McCall were the first two researchers to be appointed positions at the new Center for Clinical Pharmacology, formed by a merging of the St. Louis College of Pharmacy and WUSM.<ref name=\":1\" /> Al-Hasani's lab focuses on understanding the neural circuitry involved in addiction, stress, and chronic pain by specifically focusing on the opioid system to elucidate targets for future therapies.<ref name=\":0\" /> By building and using innovative tools for in vivo neural circuit dissection, Al-Hasani and her team study the role of the kappa opioid system in the generation of negative affective states that might accompany chronic pain, withdrawal, and preclude nicotine cessation.<ref name=\":0\" /> In April 2020, Al-Hasani was awarded the Young Investigator Grant from the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation to support her research.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stlcop.edu/news/archive/2020/ream-al-hasani-wins-young-investigator-grant.html|title=Al-Hasani Receives Young Investigator Grant|website=www.stlcop.edu|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> \n\n==== Role of Kappa Opioid System in Affective Component of Pain ====\nIn 2019, Al-Hasani helped dissect physical pain from its emotional affective counterpart in a study published in Neuron.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.stlcop.edu/news/archive/2019/connection-between-pain-and-emotion-in-the-brain.html|title=Faculty Researchers Uncover the Connection Between Pain and Emotion in the Brain|website=www.stlcop.edu|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref> Al-Hasani and her colleagues at Washington University sought out to understand how the [[\u039a-opioid receptor|kappa opioid]] system mediates the emotional response to pain, which can lead to drug overdose and co-morbid psychiatric conditions such as depression.<ref name=\":9\" /> They targeted their investigation to the ventral shell of the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which Al-Hasani had previously shown to be involved in negative affective states.<ref

They found that pain recruits the dynorphin-kappa opioid system in the NAc, and that the dynorphinergic cells are more active during inflammatory pain due to a decrease in inhibitory inputs onto these cells.<ref name=\":10\" /> By blocking dynorphinergic kappa opioid receptor signalling in the shell of the NAc, they are able to alleviate the decrease in motivation that results from the experience of pain.<ref name=\":10\" />\u00a0 These findings show that the kappa opioid system modulates the emotional aspects of the experience of pain and could serve as a less addictive target for pain treatment compared to opiates.<ref name=\":9\" /> \n\n==== Outreach ====\nBeyond her direct contributions to scientific innovation in the WUSM community, Al-Hasani has helped to mentor the younger generation of scientists and create a space for them to enter the pipeline from a young age.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite
