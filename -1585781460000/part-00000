Justice of the Peace Montoyo hears a minor case. - NARA - 522002.tif|thumb|right|Taos County, New Mexico. Justice of the Peace Montoyo hears a minor case. (1941)]]\nA '''justice of the peace''' ('''JP''') is a [[judicial officer]] of a lower or ''[[puisne]]'' court, elected or appointed by means of a commission ([[letters patent]]) to keep the peace. In past centuries the term '''commissioner of the peace''' was often used with the same meaning. Depending on the jurisdiction, such justices dispense [[Summary offence|summary justice]] or merely deal with local administrative applications in [[common law]] jurisdictions. Justices of the peace are appointed or elected from the citizens of the jurisdiction in which they serve, and are (or were) usually not required to have any formal legal education in order to qualify for the office. Some jurisdictions have varying forms of training for JPs.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Magistrates' court (Russia)}}\n\nIn 1195, [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] (\"the Lionheart\") of England and his Minister [[Hubert Walter]] commissioned certain [[knight]]s to preserve the peace in unruly areas. They were responsible to the King in ensuring that the law was upheld and preserving the \"[[Queen's peace|King's peace]]\". Therefore, they were known as \"keepers of the peace\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Charles Austin|last= Beard|authorlink=Charles Austin Beard|title= The Office of Justice of the Peace in England in Its Origin and Development|publisher= Columbia University Press|year= 1904|url=https://archive.org/details/officeofjusticeo02bearuoft}}</ref>\n\nAn act of 1327 had referred to \"good and lawful men\" to be appointed in every county in the land to \"guard the peace\"; such individuals were first referred to as [[conservator of the peace|conservators of the peace]],<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Conservator|volume=6|page=977}}</ref> or wardens of the peace. The title ''justice of the peace'' derives from 1361,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/aep/1361/caep_13610001_enm_1 |title=Justices of the Peace Act 1361 |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |accessdate=17 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416050654/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/aep/1361/caep_13610001_enm_1 |archivedate=16 April 2009 }}</ref> in the reign of [[Edward III of England|Edward III]]. The \"peace\" to be guarded is the sovereign's, the maintenance of which is the duty of the [[The Crown|Crown]] under the [[royal prerogative]]. Justices of the peace still use the power conferred or re-conferred on them since 1361 to [[bind over]] unruly persons \"to be of good behaviour\". The bind over is not a punishment, but a preventive measure, intended to ensure that people thought likely to offend will not do so. The justices' alternative title of \"[[magistrate]]\" dates from the 16th century, although the word had been in use centuries earlier to describe some legal officials of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times.<ref>{{cite book\n  | chapter = Magistrate\n  | title =Oxford English Dictionary \n  | publisher=Oxford University Press\n  | year =1989\n  | title-link =Oxford English Dictionary \n }}</ref>\n\nIn the centuries from the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] period until the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the JPs constituted a major element of the English (later British) governmental system, which in modern times has soemtimes been termed a [[squirearchy]] (i.e., dominance of the land-owning [[gentry]]). For example, historian [[Tim Blanning]] notes<ref>Tim Blanning, ''[[The Pursuit of Glory: Europe 1648\u20131815]]'', Penguin, 2007</ref> that while in Britain the royal prerogative was decisively curbed by the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], in practice the central government in London had a greater ability to get its policies implemented in the rural outlying regions than could contemporary [[absolute monarchies]] such as France \u2013 a paradox due especially to JPs belonging to the same social class as the Members of Parliament and thus having a direct interest in getting laws actually enforced and implemented on the ground.\n\nBeing an unpaid office, undertaken voluntarily and sometimes more for the sake of renown or to confirm the justice's standing within the community, the justice was typically a member of the [[gentry]]. The justices of the peace conducted [[arraignment]]s in all criminal cases, and tried [[misdemeanour]]s and [[infraction]]s of [[local ordinance]]s and [[bylaw]]s. Towns and boroughs with enough burdensome judicial business that could not find volunteers for the unpaid role of justice of the peace had to petition the Crown for authority to hire a paid [[stipendiary magistrate]].\n\nThe [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]] stripped the power to appoint normal JPs from those municipal corporations that had it. This was replaced by the present system, where the [[Lord Chancellor]] nominates candidates with local advice, for appointment by the [[British monarchy|Crown]].\n\nUntil the introduction of elected [[county council]]s in the 19th century, JPs, in [[quarter sessions]], also administered the county at a local level. Their many roles included regulating wages and food supplies, managing roads, bridges, prisons and workhouses and undertook to provide and supervise locally those services mandated by the Crown and Parliament for the welfare of the county. To this end they set the County Rate, where one was set at all.\n\nWomen were not allowed to become JPs in the United Kingdom until 1919, the first woman being [[Ada Summers]], the Mayor of [[Stalybridge]], who was a JP by virtue of her office. In October 1920 Summers was appointed a JP in her own right, alongside other pioneers including Miriam Lightowler OBE in Halifax.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~calderdalecompanion/blw3.jpg|title=Calderdale companion|date=June 1958|publisher=freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com|access-date=18 December 2017}}</ref> [[Emily Murphy]] of Edmonton, Canada, preceded her by some three and a half years.<ref>Byrne Hope Sanders, ''Emily Murphy: Crusader'', Macmillan, Toronto, 1945</ref><ref>Christine Mander, ''Emily Murphy: Rebel'', Simon & Pierre, Toronto, 1985</ref> Now in the UK, 50% of JPs are women.\n\nIn special circumstances, a justice of the peace can be the highest governmental representative, so in fact 'gubernatorial', in a colonial entity.

Bail justices, once appointed, may remain in their role until they turn 70 years of age (although they must be under 65 at the time of their appointment). They are often required to attend call outs and rule on bail applications or protection applications for children in danger on weekends and late at night when the courts are closed, but they can also witness Victorian statutory declarations and affidavits. Candidates must successfully complete a three-day training course run by the Department of Justice. Bail justices, who are also volunteers, also have some limited powers under federal legislation, including the power to conduct interstate extradition hearings and extending question time for federal police.

There is a justice of the peace in each [[Cantons of Belgium|judicial canton of Belgium]], of which there are 187 in total as of 2017. The justices of the peace have [[original jurisdiction]] over cases in which the disputed amount does not exceed 5,000 euro (as of September 2018), except for the [[Subject-matter jurisdiction|matters]] over which another court or tribunal has [[exclusive jurisdiction]].

Accordingly, it is often advised to use a Commissioner for Oaths, and to avoid a Peace Commissioner.\n\n===Jamaica===\nA justice of the peace (JP), according to the Ministry of Justice, is a person of unquestionable integrity who seeks to promote and protect the rights of the individual and helps to provide justice to persons in a particular community. Additionally, the JP serves as a justice in petty court sessions, attends juvenile court sessions, issues summonses, considers applications for bail, explains and signs legal documents, sits on licensing panels, and gives counsel/advice. Any [[Jamaica]]n citizen that can speak and write English is eligible to become a JP. Any club/organisation/citizen can recommend someone to become JP for a community. JPs are chosen under the [[Governor-General of Jamaica|Governor-General]]'s discretion.\n\n===Malaysia===\nIn [[Malaysia]], justices of the peace (''jaksa pendamai'' in [[Malay language|Malay]], also abbreviated ''JP'') have largely been replaced in magistrates' courts by legally qualified (first-class) stipendiary magistrates. However, state governments continue to appoint justices of the peace as honours. In 2004, some associations of justices of the peace pressed the federal government to allow justices of the peace to sit as second-class magistrates in order to reduce the backlog of cases in the courts.\n\n===New Zealand===\nA Justice of the Peace in [[New Zealand]] is someone of good stature in the community who is authorized to witness and sign [[statutory declaration]]s and [[affidavit]]s as well as [[certified copy|certify documents]]. They may also perform citizenship ceremonies and act as a Visiting Justice in prisons the function of which is to record a prisoner's grievance and decide on its validity.\n\nThey have certain powers to issue search warrants, and (in conjunction with another justice of the peace) may try minor criminal trials in the district court and exercise powers to remand defendants in custody, grant bail, and adjourn court hearings. They are nominated for office by local Members of Parliament and appointed by the Governor-General. Appointment is for life and a JP must take the Oath of Allegiance and the Judicial Oath.\n\n===Pakistan===\nSections 22, 22-A and 22-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 provide for the appointment of justices of the peace by the provincial governments, their powers and duties respectively. However, seldom are justices of the peace appointed in Pakistan outside the judiciary. Session and additional session judges act as ex-officio justices of the peace as per Section 25 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. An Ex-officio Justice of the Peace may issue appropriate directions to the police authorities concerned on a complaint regarding-\n(i) non-registration of a criminal case;\n(ii) transfer of investigation from one police officer to another; and\n(iii) neglect, failure or excess committed by a police authority in relation to its functions and duties.\nSuch functions being quasi-judicial in nature could not be termed as executive, administrative or ministerial.(PLD 2016 Supreme Court 581)\n\nIt is pertinent to note however, as many academics have pointed out, that there is great utility in the appointment of such justices especially in rural areas where enmity between rival groups can lead to the inability of registration of cognizable offences and biased judicial proceedings.\n\n===Singapore===\nJustices of the peace in [[Singapore]] derives their vested powers from statute law. They are appointed by the President of the Republic of Singapore, under the provisions of section 11(l) of the State Courts Act (Cap.321). The President may revoke the appointment of any justice of the peace. Newly appointed justices of the peace are required by section 17 of the State Courts Act, to take the oath of office and allegiance as set out in the schedule to the State Courts Act, before exercising the functions of their good office.\n\nIn their main role, JPs serve as visiting justices of [[Changi Prison|Singapore prisons]], mediators or neutral referees in the [[State Courts of Singapore|state courts]]. In addition, they regularly solemnise marriages in the [[Registry of Marriages]] or perform the duties of the magistrate conferred on them by any written law.<ref>{{cite web|title=74 Justices of the Peace appointed|url=http://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/slw/headlinesnews/24707-74-justices-of-the-peace-appointed.html|publisher=Singapore Law Watch|accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nIn Sri Lanka, Justice of the Peace (JP) is an honorary post, with authorization to witness and sign [[statutory declaration]]s and [[affidavit]]s as well as [[certified copy|certify documents]].

If you change this sub-head, please consider the link as well\u2014thanks. -->\nA [[magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] in [[England and Wales]] is composed of a [[bench (law)|bench]] of (usually three) JPs or magistrates, who dispense [[summary offence|summary justice]]: that is, they decide on offences which carry up to six months in prison, to a maximum of one year of imprisonment over not less than two indictable offences, or an unlimited fine. They are advised on points of law and procedure by a legally qualified [[justices' clerk]] and their assistants. No formal qualifications are required but magistrates need intelligence, common sense, integrity and the capacity to act fairly. Membership is widely spread throughout the local area and drawn from all walks of life following a rigorous selection process. All magistrates are carefully trained before sitting and continue to receive training throughout their service. Magistrates are unpaid volunteers but they may receive allowances to cover travelling expenses and subsistence. Lay justices or magistrates must sit for a minimum of 26 sessions (half-days) per year, but some sit as much as a day a week, or possibly more.  Magistrates can sit alone to hear issues such as warrant applications or many traffic offences under the new Single Justice Procedure.\n\nIn addition to the lay justices, there are a small number of [[district judge (magistrates courts)|district judge]]s, formerly known as ''stipendiary magistrates''. These are legally qualified members of the magistracy and will often hear cases alone. It is important to distinguish the district judge (magistrates' court) from the district judges who usually sit in the county court.\n\nMagistrates' courts today can deal with minor offences (fines or imprisonment of up to six months for a single offence or 12 months for consecutive sentences, or both) and handle over 95% of the criminal cases in [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about_judiciary/roles_types_jurisdiction/judicial_profiles/magistrates/index.htm|title=Magistrates|website=www.judiciary.gov.uk}}</ref> With more serious offences, magistrates are responsible for indictment and committal to the [[Crown Court]] (a task in former times dealt with by a [[grand jury]]). Magistrates also have a civil [[jurisdiction]], such as a family jurisdiction, or appeals against decisions of government departments. Although they had a licensing jurisdiction dealing liquor, betting and clubs licensing applications, this was transferred under the [[Licensing Act 2003]] to local authorities. The magistrates now act in licensing matters only as an appeal court from the decisions of the local authority.\n\nCardiff Magistrates' Court is the only court in the country which deals with offences under the Companies Act, such as for late filing of accounts or directors' offences. Westminster Magistrates' Court has special responsibilities for dealing with all terrorism and extradition offences throughout the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/fact_sheets/extradition/|title=CPS: Extradition|publisher=The Crown Prosecution Service|accessdate=25 April 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127175114/http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/fact_sheets/extradition/|archivedate=27 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nUntil the [[Courts Act 2003]] came into force, magistrates were tied to a particular area (see [[magistrates' courts committee]], [[commission area]], [[petty sessions area]]). This has now been changed such that they are assigned to [[local justice area]]s, but less strongly.\n\nThe Courts Act provides the current framework for appointment of the justices, which is done by the [[Lord Chancellor]] in the name of [[British monarchy|sovereign]]. Justices can also be removed by the same mechanism. District judges (magistrates' court) \u2013 previously known as stipendiary magistrates \u2013 must have a seven years' general legal qualification, and are appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the Lord Chancellor.\n\nBefore 1714, magistrates were liable to be approached at any time and in any place by people legally recognised as [[pauper]]s, appealing for aid if [[vestry|parish authorities]] refused to provide any. It was relatively common for these magistrates to write out, on the spot, an order requiring aid to be granted.<ref name=\"historyandpolicy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-108.html|title=England's early 'Big Society': parish welfare under the Old Poor Law|last=Charlesworth|first=Lorie|date=November 2010|work=History & Policy|publisher=History & Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=United Kingdom}}</ref>\n\n====Scotland====\n{{See also|Judiciary of Scotland}}\nWithin the Scottish legal system justices of the peace are lay magistrates who currently sit in the [[justice of the peace court]]s.

However, justices of the peace no longer sat out of petty sessions after 1935 (Summary Jurisdiction and Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1935).<ref>https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/special/2000/justice/11.pdf</ref> Since then, magistrates' courts in Northern Ireland have consisted of legally qualified resident magistrates (now known as district judges (magistrates' courts)) sitting alone, except in cases involving children, where two lay panelists sat with the magistrate. Justices of the peace were confined to the power to conduct committal hearings, bind persons over to the peace, sign warrants, summons, and other official documents. They were appointed by the [[Lord Chancellor]] on the recommendation of a committee in each county court division.\n\nThe Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 introduced a new office of lay magistrate, to sit alongside resident magistrates at magistrates' courts in certain matters. Unlike in England and Wales, \"lay magistrate\" is the official title of the position, to distinguish from existing justices of the peace who do not sit in the magistrates' courts. The first lay magistrates were appointed in 2005. Two lay magistrates sit with the district judge (magistrates' court) in criminal proceedings involving children (replacing the former lay panelists) and Family Proceedings Court matters. The district judge (magistrates' court), who is a barrister or solicitor of at least seven years standing, presides over the bench.<ref>[http://www.law.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofLaw/Education/handbooks/Filetoupload,150353,en.pdf ]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118122017/http://www.law.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofLaw/Education/handbooks/Filetoupload%2C150353%2Cen.pdf |date=18 January 2012 }}</ref> Most criminal justice functions of JPs were transferred to lay magistrates. It is expected that there will be no further appointments of justices of the peace in Northern Ireland, although those already appointed retain the title and any functions not transferred to lay magistrate under the 2002 Act.\n\n===United States===\n[[File:Justice of the Peace Sturgeon Bay.jpg|thumb|Justice of the Peace office in [[Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin]]]]\n\nIn some US states, the justice of the peace is a judge of a [[court]] of limited [[jurisdiction]], a [[magistrate]], or a quasi-judicial official with certain statutory or common law magisterial powers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Smith|first= Chester H. |title=The Justice of the Peace System in the United States |publisher= 15 Cal. L. Rev. 118|year=1926|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3925&context=californialawreview}}</ref> Some states have special qualifications or unique features for the office.\n\nThe justice of the peace typically presides over a court that hears [[misdemeanor]] cases, traffic violations, and other petty criminal infractions. The justice of the peace may also have authority over cases involving small [[debt]]s, [[landlord]] and [[leasehold estate|tenant]] disputes, or other [[small claims court]] proceedings. Proceedings before justices of the peace are often faster and less formal than the proceedings in other courts. In some jurisdictions a party convicted or found liable before a justice of the peace may have the right to a [[trial de novo]] before the judge of a higher court rather than an appeal strictly considered.\n\nA justice of the peace also performs [[civil marriage]]s.\n\n====Arizona====\nA justice of the peace has the same jurisdiction as a municipal magistrate with respect to traffic and [[misdemeanor]] cases and restraining orders, though over cases whose affairs are not contained within the confines of a single municipality. Additionally, the Justice Court hears cases involving county ordinances (ordinances enacted by the board of supervisors that apply only to unincorporated areas), civil lawsuits up to a limit of $10,000, small claims cases up to $2,500, and issues evictions, called writs of restitution (after a forcible detainer or special detainer action (eviction) being successfully completed by a landlord). Justices of the peace, also called JPs, or Judges of the Justice Court, are elected in partisan elections for four-year terms from specific districts called precincts. They have the same authority and responsibility as all other judges in the state with respect to performing marriages, administrating oaths, adhering to the code of judicial conduct, and all aspects of justice administration. However, Arizona law does not require justices of the peace to be lawyers. Many justices of the peace are not legally trained, although all are required by the Arizona Supreme Court to complete a course at the Arizona Judicial College. As with JPs, municipal judges in Arizona are not required to be lawyers.\n\n====Arkansas====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\nIn [[Arkansas]], a justice of the peace is an elected official equivalent to a [[county commissioner]] or county supervisor in some other states. Arkansas JPs sit on a county quorum court, composed of 9, 11, 13 or 15 JPs. The quorum court is a part-time body, elected from single-member districts, that has overall responsibility for county affairs. Among their responsibilities are passing the budget, creating new ordinances (at the misdemeanor level), setting property tax millage levels, and working with other elected officials. The full-time elected county administrator, who presides over the quorum court, is the county judge. Neither JPs nor the county judge have any judicial authority, though they do have the power to preside over civil marriages. Justices of the peace are elected every two years to these partisan offices.\n\n====Connecticut====\nJustices of the peace in Connecticut can preside over [[same-sex marriage]]s. Unlike some states, Connecticut JPs are not penalized for refusing to perform such ceremonies.\n\nJustices of the peace in Connecticut have the same general oath-giving powers as a [[notary public]].\n\n====Louisiana====\n*Are elected to serve six-year terms as the judicial authority of a ward or district.\n*Have jurisdiction in civil matters when the amount in dispute does not exceed $5,000.\n*Do not have jurisdiction when a title to real estate is involved, when the state or any political subdivision is a defendant, or in successions or probate matters.\n*Can perform marriage ceremonies.\n*November 2015 Heather M Furello was Elected the youngest female Justice of the Peace in the United States, elected to serve Tensas Parish Ward 1 District 1 Newellton<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.knoe.com/content/news/Newellton-woman-gets-elected-youngest-justice-of-the-peace-in-Louisiana-406944775.html|title=Newellton woman gets elected youngest justice of the peace in Louisiana|first=Kaitlyn|last=Loyacano|website=www.knoe.com}}</ref>\n\n====Maine====\nIn [[Maine]], the office of the Justice of the Peace was merged with [[Notary Public]], a process that took place from 1981 to 1988.<ref name=\"Maine\">{{cite web|url=https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/notary/jp.html|title=Information on Justices of the Peace|publisher=Maine Bureau of Corporations, Elections & Commissions}}</ref> The duties that were attached to the office of Justice of the Peace were fully transferred to the Notary Public in 1988. The office currently named as \"Justice of the Peace\" in Maine is a court officer, an attorney, involved in the process of issuing warrants and responding to complaints.<ref name=\"Maine\"/>\n\n====Massachusetts====\nJustices of the peace in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are commissioned by the [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] with the advice and consent of the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council|Council]] for seven-year terms. They are often called on to solemnize non-religious marriages, especially [[same-sex marriage]]s, which certain religious officials are not willing to oversee.\n\nJustices of the peace in Massachusetts have the same general oath-giving powers as a [[notary public]], and are also empowered to issue certain writs.\n\n====Minnesota====\nIn Minnesota, the office of the Justice of the Peace was abolished in 1977 (Minn. Stat. 487.35). It has not existed for 40-plus years although some people who offer private wedding officiant services erroneously claim to be Justices of the Peace, this term may not properly be used inasmuch as the office has been abolished. Under Minnesota law, however, judges, retired judges, court administrators, retired court administrators,and other public officials designated in statute may officiate or solemnize marriage ceremonies in addition to licensed or ordained ministers of any religious denomination who have filed their credentials with a county registrar (Minn, Stat. 517.04).\n\n====New York====\n'''Justice courts''' are courts in [[New York State]] that handle traffic tickets, criminal matters, [[small claims court|small claims]] and local code violations such as [[zoning]]. Though justice courts constitutionally are part of the [[New York State Unified Court System]], state law generally makes justice courts independent of New York's Office of Court Administration (OCA) and instead makes Justice Courts the responsibility of their sponsoring localities. Town justice courts are often called Town Court, and village justice courts are often called Village Court. City courts in New York State handle mostly the same types of cases but are not justice courts.\n\nThe official title for [[judge]]s in Justice Courts is Justice, the same as in [[New York Supreme Court]]. However, in common usage, most people, including lawyers, call them Judge. Justices in Justice Court do not have to be lawyers. The vast majority are not. Many of these courts are in small towns and villages where none of the residents are lawyers. In the larger towns, the justices are almost always lawyers.\n\nWhile Justices and their court clerks receive training from OCA, there is tremendous variability in how cases are handled. This includes court procedures and substantive results. Some courts will dismiss a traffic ticket if the officer does not appear for a trial, while others will adjourn the matter to give the officer another chance. In some courts the police prosecute their own tickets, while in others an [[Prosecutor|Assistant District Attorney]] from the county or a town or village attorney will prosecute the tickets. This may even vary by the type of officer, with State Troopers and Deputies prosecuting their tickets and a town attorney prosecuting tickets written by the town police.\n\nLarger towns can have very busy caseloads, including several sessions a week with dozens of cases at each session, and people may have to wait hours before their cases are heard. In some small towns the caseload is extremely light, and a court might meet once a month and have only a few cases.\n\nAll criminal prosecutions that occur in towns and villages are commenced in a justice court. [[Misdemeanor]]s are handled exclusively in the justice court, while [[felony|felonies]] generally move up to County Court before the case moves forward.\n\nSimilar matters in some places outside New York are handled by a justice of the peace.\n\nTown and village Justices also possess limited powers of a [[Notary public (New York)|New York notary public]], [[ex-officio]], only within the county in which the town or village for which they serve is located; they may administer oaths and affirmations and take acknowledgments and proofs of execution.  Some Justices seek and obtain a formal New York notary public commission to permit free travel statewide and enjoy the additional privileges and international legal recognition of a notary public.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Piombino|first1=Alfred E.|title=Notary Public Handbook: A Guide for New York|date=2011|publisher=East Coast Publishing|edition=Fourth}}</ref>\n\n====New Hampshire====\nNew Hampshire justices of the peace are commissioned magisterial officers, appointed by the Governor and Executive Council to terms of five years, with the power to administer oaths, acknowledge instruments, perform marriage ceremonies<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/XLII/455-A/455-A-3.htm |title=Section 455-A:3 Powers |publisher=Gencourt.state.nh.us |date=1 January 2000 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521002229/http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/XLII/455-A/455-A-3.htm |archivedate=21 May 2010 }}</ref> and, effective 1 January 2008, solemnize civil unions for same-sex couples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2007/HB0437.html |title=HB 0437 |publisher=Gencourt.state.nh.us |accessdate=17 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327171800/http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2007/HB0437.html |archivedate=27 March 2013 }}</ref> They may also order compulsory mental examinations for good cause,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/x/135-c/135-c-28.htm |title=Section 135-C:28 Involuntary Emergency Admission Examination |publisher=Gencourt.state.nh.us |accessdate=17 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522190914/http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/x/135-c/135-c-28.htm |archivedate=22 May 2010 }}</ref> act as a magisterial official regarding enforcement complaints on orders for isolation or quarantine issued by the Commissioner of Health and Human Services,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/x/141-c/141-c-mrg.htm |title=CHAPTER 141-C COMMUNICABLE DISEASE |publisher=Gencourt.state.nh.us |accessdate=17 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100521002958/http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/x/141-c/141-c-mrg.htm |archivedate=21 May 2010 }}</ref> administer oaths of office to public officials,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/iii/42/42-2.htm |title=Section 42:2 Before Whom |publisher=Gencourt.state.nh.us |date=31 August 1969 |accessdate=17 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522215129/http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/iii/42/42-2.htm |archivedate=22 May 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/rsa/html/I/21/21-25.htm |title=Section 21:25 Sworn;

After independence, the 1776 [[Constitution of North Carolina]] and an act passed by the [[North Carolina General Assembly of 1777]] re-defined justices of peace in the [[North Carolina|State of North Carolina]].

However, JP's are required to be \"well versed in the law\" and take mandatory classes to retain their office.  New JP's are required to take 80 hours of legal, state-mandated classes the first year, and 20 hours each year thereafter during their tenure in office.\n\nSections 18 and 19 of Article V of the [[Texas Constitution]], as well as Chapters 27 and 28 of the Texas Government Code, outline the duties of these Courts and their officers.\n\nUnder Section 18, the number of JP's (and associated [[constable]]s) is dependent on the size of the county:\n*For counties with populations less than 18,000 (as determined by the census), the entire county shall be one JP precinct, unless the [[Commissioners' Court]] determines that more are needed, in which case the court can divide the county into no more than four JP precincts.\n*For counties with populations at least 18,000 but less than 50,000, the number of JP precincts shall be no less than two nor more than eight.\n*For counties with populations 50,000 or greater, the number of JP precincts shall be no less than four nor more than eight.\n*In any county with population less than 150,000, if any precinct contains a city with 18,000 or more population, that precinct shall have two JP's.\n*In any county with population 150,000 or greater, each JP precinct may have more than one JP.\n*Special provisions apply to [[Chambers County, Texas|Chambers]] and [[Randall County, Texas|Randall]] counties (must have no fewer than two nor more than six precincts) and to [[Mills County, Texas|Mills]], [[Reagan County, Texas|Reagan]], and [[Roberts County, Texas|Roberts]] (the Constable office is abolished, with the Sheriff's office performing all duties).\n\nSection 19 sets forth the minimum jurisdiction of the JP court:\n*Original jurisdiction in \"criminal matters of misdemeanor cases punishable by fine only\" (under the Texas Penal Code such offenses are called \"Class C\" misdemeanors, generally involving traffic offenses or public intoxication; however, in jurisdictions with a municipal court, if the traffic offense is written by a municipal police officer the municipal court will have jurisdiction, whereas if the offense is written by a state or county officer the JP court will hear the case),\n*Exclusive jurisdiction in \"civil matters where the amount in controversy is $200 or less\", and\n*\"Such other jurisdiction as may be provided by law\". Under this provision, the Legislature has raised the top limit on civil matters to $10,000 and assigned the JP courts, among others, the right to hear cases involving [[eviction]] as well as cases involving [[foreclosure]] and liens against personal property where the amount falls within the (revised) JP Court's jurisdiction.\n\nJP cases are appealed to the county court level; the appeal results in a trial de novo. In criminal cases, cases beginning in justice court cannot be appealed beyond the county level court unless the fine is more than $100 or a constitutional matter is asserted.\n\nIn smaller counties without a coroner, the JP has the duty to perform inquests.  The JP is also called out for any unattended deaths in the county.\n\nA JP in a large precinct in a large county will work 5 days a week, 8 or more hours daily. Their duties will include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: Trials of civil matters, both to a 6-person jury and to the bench, with an amount in controversy not exceeding $10,000.00. Trials of criminal matters involving traffic violations and class C misdemeanors punishable by fine only. Pre-trial motion dockets and show cause hearings are held, and all discovery must be approved by the Judge in advance in civil cases. All criminal matters are controlled by the rules of criminal procedure and evidence. A much more restricted and smaller set of rules apply in civil matters unless in the Judges discretion, it is believed to be in the best interests of justice to apply the standard rules of evidence and procedure. The court has the exclusive jurisdiction of evictions. A Texas JP Judge will also magistrate prisoners and set bail. The Judge will hear juvenile violations such as truancy, and underage drinking and smoking. Warrants of Arrest, Alias, Search and Capias Profine are issued. Protective Orders can issue and result in jail time if violated. Several administrative matters are heard including the finding of a Dangerous Dog, Occupational Drivers License and tow hearings. Many writs are issued such as writs of re-entry to apartments, possession of realty and to reinstate utilities a landlord may have turned off. A JP has contempt power of $100 and up to 3 days in jail per occurrence. A JP is also authorized to perform marriage ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/SOTWDocs/FA/htm/FA.2.htm|title=FAMILY CODE CHAPTER 2.

They have the authority to register voters and administer oaths, and have all the powers of a [[notary public]] within their county-wide jurisdiction.

Kan. L. Rev. 389 (1963).</ref> In larger cities, cases may be heard in a [[state court (United States)|municipal court]] which has jurisdiction only within that city. Most efforts to abolish the office of justice of the peace have been led by the [[American Bar Association]], which views non-lawyer judges as no longer necessary, as there are now far more persons with formal legal education than in the past when justices of the peace were first used.\n\nCalifornia formerly had justice of the peace courts staffed by lay judges, but began phasing them out after a landmark 1974 decision in which the [[Supreme Court of California]] unanimously held that it was a violation of federal [[due process]] (under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]) to allow a non-lawyer to preside over a criminal trial which could result in incarceration of the defendant.<ref>''Gordon v. Justice Court'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/12C3d323.htm 12 Cal. 3d 323] (1974).</ref> The court specifically recognized that in the aftermath of ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' (1963), it made no sense to allow a case to be tried before a layperson incapable of understanding the legal arguments of the attorney to whom the defendant was entitled under ''Gideon''. The remaining justice courts (as well as municipal courts) were eliminated by the passage of Proposition 220 in June 1998, which authorized the merger of all lower courts within the state judicial branch into the [[Superior Courts of California|superior courts]] (the courts of general jurisdiction).  However, the judges affected by each merger in each county had to affirmatively consent, a process completed in 2001. Under current California law, all California judges must be licensed attorneys.\n\nNotably, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] sharply disagreed with California's analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment in the landmark case of ''[[North v. Russell]]'', {{ussc|427|328|1976}},<ref>See also Young v.

(1941)]]\nA '''justice of the peace''' ('''JP''') is a [[judicial officer]] of a lower or ''[[puisne]]'' court, elected or appointed by means of a commission ([[letters patent]]) to keep the peace. In past centuries the term '''commissioner of the peace''' was often used with the same meaning. Depending on the jurisdiction, such justices dispense [[Summary offence|summary justice]] or merely deal with local administrative applications in [[common law]] jurisdictions. Justices of the peace are appointed or elected from the citizens of the jurisdiction in which they serve, and are (or were) usually not required to have any formal legal education in order to qualify for the office. Some jurisdictions have varying forms of training for JPs.\n\n==History==\n{{see also|Magistrates' court (Russia)}}\n\nIn 1195, [[Richard I of England|Richard I]] (\"the Lionheart\") of England and his Minister [[Hubert Walter]] commissioned certain [[knight]]s to preserve the peace in unruly areas. They were responsible to the King in ensuring that the law was upheld and preserving the \"[[Queen's peace|King's peace]]\". Therefore, they were known as \"keepers of the peace\".<ref>{{cite book|first=Charles Austin|last= Beard|authorlink=Charles Austin Beard|title= The Office of Justice of the Peace in England in Its Origin and Development|publisher= Columbia University Press|year= 1904|url=https://archive.org/details/officeofjusticeo02bearuoft}}</ref>\n\nAn act of 1327 had referred to \"good and lawful men\" to be appointed in every county in the land to \"guard the peace\"; such individuals were first referred to as [[conservator of the peace|conservators of the peace]],<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Conservator|volume=6|page=977}}</ref> or wardens of the peace.

The \"peace\" to be guarded is the sovereign's, the maintenance of which is the duty of the [[The Crown|Crown]] under the [[royal prerogative]]. Justices of the peace still use the power conferred or re-conferred on them since 1361 to [[bind over]] unruly persons \"to be of good behaviour\". The bind over is not a punishment, but a preventive measure, intended to ensure that people thought likely to offend will not do so. The justices' alternative title of \"[[magistrate]]\" dates from the 16th century, although the word had been in use centuries earlier to describe some legal officials of [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] times.<ref>{{cite book\n  | chapter = Magistrate\n  | title =Oxford English Dictionary \n  | publisher=Oxford University Press\n  | year =1989\n  | title-link =Oxford English Dictionary \n }}</ref>\n\nIn the centuries from the [[Tudor dynasty|Tudor]] period until the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the JPs constituted a major element of the English (later British) governmental system, which had been termed sometimes [[squirearchy]] (i.e., dominance of the land-owning [[gentry]]). For example, historian [[Tim Blanning]] notes<ref>Tim Blanning, ''[[The Pursuit of Glory: Europe 1648\u20131815]]'', Penguin, 2007</ref> that while in Britain the royal prerogative was decisively curbed by the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], in practice the central government in London had a greater ability to get its policies implemented in the rural outlying regions than could contemporary [[absolute monarchies]] such as France \u2013 a paradox due especially to JPs belonging to the same social class as the Members of Parliament and thus having a direct interest in getting laws actually enforced and implemented on the ground.\n\nBeing an unpaid office, undertaken voluntarily and sometimes more for the sake of renown or to confirm the justice's standing within the community, the justice was typically a member of the [[gentry]]. The justices of the peace conducted [[arraignment]]s in all criminal cases, and tried [[misdemeanour]]s and [[infraction]]s of [[local ordinance]]s and [[bylaw]]s. Towns and boroughs with enough burdensome judicial business that could not find volunteers for the unpaid role of justice of the peace had to petition the Crown for authority to hire a paid [[stipendiary magistrate]].\n\nThe [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]] stripped the power to appoint normal JPs from those municipal corporations that had it. This was replaced by the present system, where the [[Lord Chancellor]] nominates candidates with local advice, for appointment by the [[British monarchy|Crown]].\n\nUntil the introduction of elected [[county council]]s in the 19th century, JPs, in [[quarter sessions]], also administered the county at a local level. Their many roles included regulating wages and food supplies, managing roads, bridges, prisons and workhouses and undertook to provide and supervise locally those services mandated by the Crown and Parliament for the welfare of the county. To this end they set the County Rate, where one was set at all.\n\nWomen were not allowed to become JPs in the United Kingdom until 1919, the first woman being [[Ada Summers]], the Mayor of [[Stalybridge]], who was a JP by virtue of her office. In October 1920 Summers was appointed a JP in her own right, alongside other pioneers including Miriam Lightowler OBE in Halifax.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~calderdalecompanion/blw3.jpg|title=Calderdale companion|date=June 1958|publisher=freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com|access-date=18 December 2017}}</ref> [[Emily Murphy]] of Edmonton, Canada, preceded her by some three and a half years.<ref>Byrne Hope Sanders, ''Emily Murphy: Crusader'', Macmillan, Toronto, 1945</ref><ref>Christine Mander, ''Emily Murphy: Rebel'', Simon & Pierre, Toronto, 1985</ref> Now in the UK, 50% of JPs are women.\n\nIn special circumstances, a justice of the peace can be the highest governmental representative, so in fact 'gubernatorial', in a colonial entity.

They are often required to attend call outs and rule on bail applications or protection applications for children in danger on weekends and late at night when the courts are closed, but they can also witness Victorian statutory declarations and affidavits. Candidates must successfully complete a three-day training course run by the Department of Justice. Bail justices, who are also volunteers, also have some limited powers under federal legislation, including the power to conduct interstate extradition hearings and extending question time for federal police.

Additionally, the JP serves as a justice in petty court sessions, attends juvenile court sessions, issues summonses, considers applications for bail, explains and signs legal documents, sits on licensing panels, and gives counsel/advice. Any [[Jamaica]]n citizen that can speak and write English is eligible to become a JP. Any club/organisation/citizen can recommend someone to become JP for a community. JPs are chosen under the [[Governor-General of Jamaica|Governor-General]]'s discretion.\n\n===Malaysia===\nIn [[Malaysia]], justices of the peace (''jaksa pendamai'' in [[Malay language|Malay]], also abbreviated ''JP'') have largely been replaced in magistrates' courts by legally qualified (first-class) stipendiary magistrates. However, state governments continue to appoint justices of the peace as honours. In 2004, some associations of justices of the peace pressed the federal government to allow justices of the peace to sit as second-class magistrates in order to reduce the backlog of cases in the courts.\n\n===New Zealand===\nA Justice of the Peace in [[New Zealand]] is someone of good stature in the community who is authorized to witness and sign [[statutory declaration]]s and [[affidavit]]s as well as [[certified copy|certify documents]]. They may also perform citizenship ceremonies and act as a Visiting Justice in prisons the function of which is to record a prisoner's grievance and decide on its validity.\n\nThey have certain powers to issue search warrants, and (in conjunction with another justice of the peace) may try minor criminal trials in the district court and exercise powers to remand defendants in custody, grant bail, and adjourn court hearings. They are nominated for office by local Members of Parliament and appointed by the Governor-General. Appointment is for life and a JP must take the Oath of Allegiance and the Judicial Oath.\n\n===Pakistan===\nSections 22, 22-A and 22-B of the Code of Criminal Procedure Code, 1898 provide for the appointment of justices of the peace by the provincial governments, their powers and duties respectively. However, seldom are justices of the peace appointed in Pakistan outside the judiciary. Session and additional session judges act as ex-officio justices of the peace as per Section 25 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. An Ex-officio Justice of the Peace may issue appropriate directions to the police authorities concerned on a complaint regarding-\n(i) non-registration of a criminal case;\n(ii) transfer of investigation from one police officer to another; and\n(iii) neglect, failure or excess committed by a police authority in relation to its functions and duties.\nSuch functions being quasi-judicial in nature could not be termed as executive, administrative or ministerial.(PLD 2016 Supreme Court 581)\n\nIt is pertinent to note however, as many academics have pointed out, that there is great utility in the appointment of such justices especially in rural areas where enmity between rival groups can lead to the inability of registration of cognizable offences and biased judicial proceedings.\n\n===Singapore===\nJustices of the peace in [[Singapore]] derives their vested powers from statute law. They are appointed by the President of the Republic of Singapore, under the provisions of section 11(l) of the State Courts Act (Cap.321). The President may revoke the appointment of any justice of the peace. Newly appointed justices of the peace are required by section 17 of the State Courts Act, to take the oath of office and allegiance as set out in the schedule to the State Courts Act, before exercising the functions of their good office.\n\nIn their main role, JPs serve as visiting justices of [[Changi Prison|Singapore prisons]], mediators or neutral referees in the [[State Courts of Singapore|state courts]]. In addition, they regularly solemnise marriages in the [[Registry of Marriages]] or perform the duties of the magistrate conferred on them by any written law.<ref>{{cite web|title=74 Justices of the Peace appointed|url=http://www.singaporelawwatch.sg/slw/headlinesnews/24707-74-justices-of-the-peace-appointed.html|publisher=Singapore Law Watch|accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Sri Lanka===\nIn Sri Lanka, Justice of the Peace (JP) is an honorary post, with authorization to witness and sign [[statutory declaration]]s and [[affidavit]]s as well as [[certified copy|certify documents]].

If you change this sub-head, please consider the link as well\u2014thanks. -->\nA [[magistrates' court (England and Wales)|magistrates' court]] in [[England and Wales]] is composed of a [[bench (law)|bench]] of (usually three) JPs or magistrates, who dispense [[summary offence|summary justice]]: that is, they decide on offences which carry up to six months in prison, to a maximum of one year of imprisonment over not less than two indictable offences, or an unlimited fine. They are advised on points of law and procedure by a legally qualified [[justices' clerk]] and their assistants. No formal qualifications are required but magistrates need intelligence, common sense, integrity and the capacity to act fairly. Membership is widely spread throughout the local area and drawn from all walks of life following a rigorous selection process. All magistrates are carefully trained before sitting and continue to receive training throughout their service. Magistrates are unpaid volunteers but they may receive allowances to cover travelling expenses and subsistence. Lay justices or magistrates must sit for a minimum of 26 sessions (half-days) per year, but some sit as much as a day a week, or possibly more.  Magistrates can sit alone to hear issues such as warrant applications or many traffic offences under the new Single Justice Procedure.\n\nIn addition to the lay justices, there are a small number of [[district judge (magistrates courts)|district judge]]s, formerly known as ''stipendiary magistrates''. These are legally qualified members of the magistracy and will often hear cases alone. It is important to distinguish the district judge (magistrates' court) from the district judges who usually sit in the county court.\n\nMagistrates' courts today can deal with minor offences (fines or imprisonment of up to six months for a single offence or 12 months for consecutive sentences, or both) and handle over 95% of the criminal cases in [[England and Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.judiciary.gov.uk/about_judiciary/roles_types_jurisdiction/judicial_profiles/magistrates/index.htm|title=Magistrates|website=www.judiciary.gov.uk}}</ref> With more serious offences, magistrates are responsible for indictment and committal to the [[Crown Court]] (a task in former times dealt with by a [[grand jury]]). Magistrates also have a civil [[jurisdiction]], such as a family jurisdiction, or appeals against decisions of government departments. Although they had a licensing jurisdiction dealing liquor, betting and clubs licensing applications, this was transferred under the [[Licensing Act 2003]] to local authorities. The magistrates now act in licensing matters only as an appeal court from the decisions of the local authority.\n\nCardiff Magistrates' Court is the only court in the country which deals with offences under the Companies Act, such as for late filing of accounts or directors' offences. Westminster Magistrates' Court has special responsibilities for dealing with all terrorism and extradition offences throughout the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/fact_sheets/extradition/|title=CPS: Extradition|publisher=The Crown Prosecution Service|accessdate=25 April 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131127175114/http://www.cps.gov.uk/news/fact_sheets/extradition/|archivedate=27 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nUntil the [[Courts Act 2003]] came into force, magistrates were tied to a particular area (see [[magistrates' courts committee]], [[commission area]], [[petty sessions area]]). This has now been changed such that they are assigned to [[local justice area]]s, but less strongly.\n\nThe Courts Act provides the current framework for appointment of the justices, which is done by the [[Lord Chancellor]] in the name of [[British monarchy|sovereign]]. Justices can also be removed by the same mechanism. District judges (magistrates' court) \u2013 previously known as stipendiary magistrates \u2013 must have a seven years' general legal qualification, and are appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the Lord Chancellor.\n\nBefore 1714, magistrates were liable to be approached at any time and in any place by people legally recognised as [[pauper]]s, appealing for aid if [[vestry|parish authorities]] refused to provide any. It was relatively common for these magistrates to write out, on the spot, an order requiring aid to be granted.<ref name=\"historyandpolicy\">{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/papers/policy-paper-108.html|title=England's early 'Big Society': parish welfare under the Old Poor Law|last=Charlesworth|first=Lorie|date=November 2010|work=History & Policy|publisher=History & Policy|accessdate=9 December 2010|location=United Kingdom}}</ref>\n\n====Scotland====\n{{See also|Judiciary of Scotland}}\nWithin the Scottish legal system justices of the peace are lay magistrates who currently sit in the [[justice of the peace court]]s.

However, justices of the peace no longer sat out of petty sessions after 1935 (Summary Jurisdiction and Criminal Justice Act (Northern Ireland) 1935).<ref>https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/special/2000/justice/11.pdf</ref> Since then, magistrates' courts in Northern Ireland have consisted of legally qualified resident magistrates (now known as district judges (magistrates' courts)) sitting alone, except in cases involving children, where two lay panelists sat with the magistrate. Justices of the peace were confined to the power to conduct committal hearings, bind persons over to the peace, sign warrants, summons, and other official documents. They were appointed by the [[Lord Chancellor]] on the recommendation of a committee in each county court division.\n\nThe Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 introduced a new office of lay magistrate, to sit alongside resident magistrates at magistrates' courts in certain matters. Unlike in England and Wales, \"lay magistrate\" is the official title of the position, to distinguish from existing justices of the peace who do not sit in the magistrates' courts. The first lay magistrates were appointed in 2005. Two lay magistrates sit with the district judge (magistrates' court) in criminal proceedings involving children (replacing the former lay panelists) and Family Proceedings Court matters. The district judge (magistrates' court), who is a barrister or solicitor of at least seven years standing, presides over the bench.<ref>[http://www.law.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofLaw/Education/handbooks/Filetoupload,150353,en.pdf ]{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118122017/http://www.law.qub.ac.uk/schools/SchoolofLaw/Education/handbooks/Filetoupload%2C150353%2Cen.pdf |date=18 January 2012 }}</ref> Most criminal justice functions of JPs were transferred to lay magistrates.

L. Rev. 118|year=1926|url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3925&context=californialawreview}}</ref> Some states have special qualifications or unique features for the office.\n\nThe justice of the peace typically presides over a court that hears [[misdemeanor]] cases, traffic violations, and other petty criminal infractions. The justice of the peace may also have authority over cases involving small [[debt]]s, [[landlord]] and [[leasehold estate|tenant]] disputes, or other [[small claims court]] proceedings. Proceedings before justices of the peace are often faster and less formal than the proceedings in other courts. In some jurisdictions a party convicted or found liable before a justice of the peace may have the right to a [[trial de novo]] before the judge of a higher court rather than an appeal strictly considered.\n\nA justice of the peace also performs [[civil marriage]]s.\n\n====Arizona====\nA justice of the peace has the same jurisdiction as a municipal magistrate with respect to traffic and [[misdemeanor]] cases and restraining orders, though over cases whose affairs are not contained within the confines of a single municipality. Additionally, the Justice Court hears cases involving county ordinances (ordinances enacted by the board of supervisors that apply only to unincorporated areas), civil lawsuits up to a limit of $10,000, small claims cases up to $2,500, and issues evictions, called writs of restitution (after a forcible detainer or special detainer action (eviction) being successfully completed by a landlord). Justices of the peace, also called JPs, or Judges of the Justice Court, are elected in partisan elections for four-year terms from specific districts called precincts. They have the same authority and responsibility as all other judges in the state with respect to performing marriages, administrating oaths, adhering to the code of judicial conduct, and all aspects of justice administration. However, Arizona law does not require justices of the peace to be lawyers. Many justices of the peace are not legally trained, although all are required by the Arizona Supreme Court to complete a course at the Arizona Judicial College. As with JPs, municipal judges in Arizona are not required to be lawyers.\n\n====Arkansas====\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2013}}\nIn [[Arkansas]], a justice of the peace is an elected official equivalent to a [[county commissioner]] or county supervisor in some other states. Arkansas JPs sit on a county quorum court, composed of 9, 11, 13 or 15 JPs. The quorum court is a part-time body, elected from single-member districts, that has overall responsibility for county affairs. Among their responsibilities are passing the budget, creating new ordinances (at the misdemeanor level), setting property tax millage levels, and working with other elected officials. The full-time elected county administrator, who presides over the quorum court, is the county judge. Neither JPs nor the county judge have any judicial authority, though they do have the power to preside over civil marriages. Justices of the peace are elected every two years to these partisan offices.\n\n====Connecticut====\nJustices of the peace in Connecticut can preside over [[same-sex marriage]]s. Unlike some states, Connecticut JPs are not penalized for refusing to perform such ceremonies.\n\nJustices of the peace in Connecticut have the same general oath-giving powers as a [[notary public]].\n\n====Louisiana====\n*Are elected to serve six-year terms as the judicial authority of a ward or district.\n*Have jurisdiction in civil matters when the amount in dispute does not exceed $5,000.\n*Do not have jurisdiction when a title to real estate is involved, when the state or any political subdivision is a defendant, or in successions or probate matters.\n*Can perform marriage ceremonies.\n*November 2015 Heather M Furello was Elected the youngest female Justice of the Peace in the United States, elected to serve Tensas Parish Ward 1 District 1 Newellton<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.knoe.com/content/news/Newellton-woman-gets-elected-youngest-justice-of-the-peace-in-Louisiana-406944775.html|title=Newellton woman gets elected youngest justice of the peace in Louisiana|first=Kaitlyn|last=Loyacano|website=www.knoe.com}}</ref>\n\n====Maine====\nIn [[Maine]], the office of the Justice of the Peace was merged with [[Notary Public]], a process that took place from 1981 to 1988.<ref name=\"Maine\">{{cite web|url=https://www.maine.gov/sos/cec/notary/jp.html|title=Information on Justices of the Peace|publisher=Maine Bureau of Corporations, Elections & Commissions}}</ref> The duties that were attached to the office of Justice of the Peace were fully transferred to the Notary Public in 1988. The office currently named as \"Justice of the Peace\" in Maine is a court officer, an attorney, involved in the process of issuing warrants and responding to complaints.<ref name=\"Maine\"/>\n\n====Massachusetts====\nJustices of the peace in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts are commissioned by the [[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] with the advice and consent of the [[Massachusetts Governor's Council|Council]] for seven-year terms. They are often called on to solemnize non-religious marriages, especially [[same-sex marriage]]s, which certain religious officials are not willing to oversee.\n\nJustices of the peace in Massachusetts have the same general oath-giving powers as a [[notary public]], and are also empowered to issue certain writs.\n\n====Minnesota====\nIn Minnesota, the office of the Justice of the Peace was abolished in 1977 (Minn. Stat. 487.35). It has not existed for 40-plus years although some people who offer private wedding officiant services erroneously claim to be Justices of the Peace, this term may not properly be used inasmuch as the office has been abolished. Under Minnesota law, however, judges, retired judges, court administrators, retired court administrators,and other public officials designated in statute may officiate or solemnize marriage ceremonies in addition to licensed or ordained ministers of any religious denomination who have filed their credentials with a county registrar (Minn, Stat. 517.04).\n\n====New York====\n'''Justice courts''' are courts in [[New York State]] that handle traffic tickets, criminal matters, [[small claims court|small claims]] and local code violations such as [[zoning]]. Though justice courts constitutionally are part of the [[New York State Unified Court System]], state law generally makes justice courts independent of New York's Office of Court Administration (OCA) and instead makes Justice Courts the responsibility of their sponsoring localities. Town justice courts are often called Town Court, and village justice courts are often called Village Court. City courts in New York State handle mostly the same types of cases but are not justice courts.\n\nThe official title for [[judge]]s in Justice Courts is Justice, the same as in [[New York Supreme Court]]. However, in common usage, most people, including lawyers, call them Judge. Justices in Justice Court do not have to be lawyers. The vast majority are not. Many of these courts are in small towns and villages where none of the residents are lawyers. In the larger towns, the justices are almost always lawyers.\n\nWhile Justices and their court clerks receive training from OCA, there is tremendous variability in how cases are handled. This includes court procedures and substantive results. Some courts will dismiss a traffic ticket if the officer does not appear for a trial, while others will adjourn the matter to give the officer another chance. In some courts the police prosecute their own tickets, while in others an [[Prosecutor|Assistant District Attorney]] from the county or a town or village attorney will prosecute the tickets. This may even vary by the type of officer, with State Troopers and Deputies prosecuting their tickets and a town attorney prosecuting tickets written by the town police.\n\nLarger towns can have very busy caseloads, including several sessions a week with dozens of cases at each session, and people may have to wait hours before their cases are heard. In some small towns the caseload is extremely light, and a court might meet once a month and have only a few cases.\n\nAll criminal prosecutions that occur in towns and villages are commenced in a justice court.

After independence, the 1776 [[Constitution of North Carolina]] and an act passed by the [[North Carolina General Assembly of 1777]] re-defined justices of peace in the [[North Carolina|State of North Carolina]].  Justices of the peace were authorized to marry and had other court duties and assisted in collecting taxes.

However, JP's are required to be \"well versed in the law\" and take mandatory classes to retain their office.  New JP's are required to take 80 hours of legal, state-mandated classes the first year, and 20 hours each year thereafter during their tenure in office.\n\nSections 18 and 19 of Article V of the [[Texas Constitution]], as well as Chapters 27 and 28 of the Texas Government Code, outline the duties of these Courts and their officers.\n\nUnder Section 18, the number of JP's (and associated [[constable]]s) is dependent on the size of the county:\n*For counties with populations less than 18,000 (as determined by the census), the entire county shall be one JP precinct, unless the [[Commissioners' Court]] determines that more are needed, in which case the court can divide the county into no more than four JP precincts.\n*For counties with populations at least 18,000 but less than 50,000, the number of JP precincts shall be no less than two nor more than eight.\n*For counties with populations 50,000 or greater, the number of JP precincts shall be no less than four nor more than eight.\n*In any county with population less than 150,000, if any precinct contains a city with 18,000 or more population, that precinct shall have two JP's.\n*In any county with population 150,000 or greater, each JP precinct may have more than one JP.\n*Special provisions apply to [[Chambers County, Texas|Chambers]] and [[Randall County, Texas|Randall]] counties (must have no fewer than two nor more than six precincts) and to [[Mills County, Texas|Mills]], [[Reagan County, Texas|Reagan]], and [[Roberts County, Texas|Roberts]] (the Constable office is abolished, with the Sheriff's office performing all duties).\n\nSection 19 sets forth the minimum jurisdiction of the JP court:\n*Original jurisdiction in \"criminal matters of misdemeanor cases punishable by fine only\" (under the Texas Penal Code such offenses are called \"Class C\" misdemeanors, generally involving traffic offenses or public intoxication; however, in jurisdictions with a municipal court, if the traffic offense is written by a municipal police officer the municipal court will have jurisdiction, whereas if the offense is written by a state or county officer the JP court will hear the case),\n*Exclusive jurisdiction in \"civil matters where the amount in controversy is $200 or less\", and\n*\"Such other jurisdiction as may be provided by law\". Under this provision, the Legislature has raised the top limit on civil matters to $10,000 and assigned the JP courts, among others, the right to hear cases involving [[eviction]] as well as cases involving [[foreclosure]] and liens against personal property where the amount falls within the (revised) JP Court's jurisdiction.\n\nJP cases are appealed to the county court level; the appeal results in a trial de novo. In criminal cases, cases beginning in justice court cannot be appealed beyond the county level court unless the fine is more than $100 or a constitutional matter is asserted.\n\nIn smaller counties without a coroner, the JP has the duty to perform inquests.  The JP is also called out for any unattended deaths in the county.\n\nA JP in a large precinct in a large county will work 5 days a week, 8 or more hours daily. Their duties will include, but are not necessarily limited to the following: Trials of civil matters, both to a 6-person jury and to the bench, with an amount in controversy not exceeding $10,000.00. Trials of criminal matters involving traffic violations and class C misdemeanors punishable by fine only. Pre-trial motion dockets and show cause hearings are held, and all discovery must be approved by the Judge in advance in civil cases. All criminal matters are controlled by the rules of criminal procedure and evidence. A much more restricted and smaller set of rules apply in civil matters unless in the Judges discretion, it is believed to be in the best interests of justice to apply the standard rules of evidence and procedure. The court has the exclusive jurisdiction of evictions. A Texas JP Judge will also magistrate prisoners and set bail. The Judge will hear juvenile violations such as truancy, and underage drinking and smoking. Warrants of Arrest, Alias, Search and Capias Profine are issued. Protective Orders can issue and result in jail time if violated. Several administrative matters are heard including the finding of a Dangerous Dog, Occupational Drivers License and tow hearings. Many writs are issued such as writs of re-entry to apartments, possession of realty and to reinstate utilities a landlord may have turned off. A JP has contempt power of $100 and up to 3 days in jail per occurrence. A JP is also authorized to perform marriage ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/SOTWDocs/FA/htm/FA.2.htm|title=FAMILY CODE CHAPTER 2.

They are elected from each town or city to serve as officers at the county-level. They also serve as election, poll, and [[town meeting]] officials, and sit on the boards of civil authority and tax abatement within their municipalities. They have the authority to register voters and administer oaths, and have all the powers of a [[notary public]] within their county-wide jurisdiction. However, they may perform civil marriages and unions, and officiate wedding ceremonies statewide on behalf the state. Justices may also serve as a magistrate when commissioned by the [[Vermont Supreme Court|Supreme Court]].<ref name=\"VTElections\">{{cite web | title=Local Office Descriptions - Vermont Secretary of State | website=Elections | url=https://www.sec.state.vt.us/elections/candidates/local-office-descriptions.aspx | access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref>   \n\nThe option to serve as a magistrate has never been invoked and likely never will be; in June of 2019 Associate Justice of the Vermont Supreme Court [[Marilyn Skoglund]] described the idea of commissioning a justice of the peace as an actual magistrate as \"a truly frightening idea\" and stated that she had never heard of such a thing actually happening.<ref>{{cite news |title=Seven Days |url=https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/wtf-can-vermonts-justices-of-the-peace-serve-as-judges/Content?oid=27768864 |date=2019-06-19}}</ref>\n\n====Replacement with other courts====\nIn many states, the office of justice of the peace has been abolished or transferred to another court, such as the [[magistrate]] court.<ref>Vanlandingham, Kenneth E. \"Decline of the Justice of the Peace, The.\" 12 U. Kan. L. Rev. 389 (1963).</ref> In larger cities, cases may be heard in a [[state court (United States)|municipal court]] which has jurisdiction only within that city. Most efforts to abolish the office of justice of the peace have been led by the [[American Bar Association]], which views non-lawyer judges as no longer necessary, as there are now far more persons with formal legal education than in the past when justices of the peace were first used.\n\nCalifornia formerly had justice of the peace courts staffed by lay judges, but began phasing them out after a landmark 1974 decision in which the [[Supreme Court of California]] unanimously held that it was a violation of federal [[due process]] (under the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution]]) to allow a non-lawyer to preside over a criminal trial which could result in incarceration of the defendant.<ref>''Gordon v. Justice Court'', [http://online.ceb.com/calcases/C3/12C3d323.htm 12 Cal. 3d 323] (1974).</ref> The court specifically recognized that in the aftermath of ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'' (1963), it made no sense to allow a case to be tried before a layperson incapable of understanding the legal arguments of the attorney to whom the defendant was entitled under ''Gideon''. The remaining justice courts (as well as municipal courts) were eliminated by the passage of Proposition 220 in June 1998, which authorized the merger of all lower courts within the state judicial branch into the [[Superior Courts of California|superior courts]] (the courts of general jurisdiction).  However, the judges affected by each merger in each county had to affirmatively consent, a process completed in 2001. Under current California law, all California judges must be licensed attorneys.\n\nNotably, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] sharply disagreed with California's analysis of the Fourteenth Amendment in the landmark case of ''[[North v. Russell]]'', {{ussc|427|328|1976}},<ref>See also Young v. Konz, 88 Wash. 2d 276, 558 P.2d 791 (1977), on rehearing, 91 Wash. 2d 532, 588 P.2d 1360 (1979).</ref> in which the court held that Kentucky's use of nonlawyer judges in its police courts was ''not'' a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees of due process and equal protection of the laws.<ref>The possible ambiguity of the ''North v. Russell'' holding is suggested by the [[West Virginia Supreme Court]] case State ex rel. Collins v. Bedell, 460 S.E.2d 636 (W. Va. 1995):  \"[I]n North v. Russell . . . the Supreme Court of the United States determined that Kentucky procedures provided for a trial ''de novo'', which included the right to a trial by jury, before a lawyer-judge; therefore, the Supreme Court found it unnecessary to decide whether the proceeding before a lay officer, which resulted in a sentence of thirty days in jail for driving under the influence, violated the constitutional rights of the defendant.\" Bedell, 460 S.E.2d at 643\u2013644.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Justices of the Peace Act]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{commons category-inline|Justice of the Peace}}\n\n{{Law}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Justices of the peace| ]]\n[[Category:Common law]]\n[[Category:Gubernatorial titles]]\n[[Category:Judiciary of England and Wales]]\n[[Category:Legal professions]]\n", "name_user": "Textorus", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:clarify", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_of_the_peace"}

Some annual academic distinctions do exist. Students graduating in the top ten percent of the class are designated \"Arjay Miller Scholars\", named after the former dean, Arjay Miller (1969\u201379). The top student receives the Henry Ford II award at graduation. At the end of the first year, five students are also designated Siebel Scholars based on a combination of academics and extracurriculars.\n\n===Full-time MSx program===\n\nThe Stanford MSx Program<ref>{{cite web|last=Stanford Graduate School of Business|title=Stanford MSx Program|url=http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/msx/|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=August 9, 2012}}</ref> is a full-time, one-year master's degree program for managers in mid-career. Fellows who successfully complete the academic program are awarded the degree of Master of Science in Management. The program's principal objective is to help participants strengthen their capacity for organizational leadership. The ideal MSx candidate is a senior manager who has had or will soon be appointed to his or her first general management position.\n\nThe Stanford MSx was previously called the Stanford Sloan Master's Program, because students in the program are known as Stanford Sloan Fellows. The Stanford MSx is one of the three [[Sloan Fellows]] programs, sharing a similar format with the others at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] and the [[London Business School]]. These programs were initially supported by Alfred P. Sloan, Chairman of [[General Motors]] from 1937 to 1956, who envisioned the Sloan Fellowship in his alma mater of [[MIT]] in 1931.\n\nThe degree distinguishes itself from the MBA by acknowledging the life experiences of fellows. Like the MBA program, the MSx program requires a set of core courses along with electives (normally mixed with MBAs), however, the MSx program has separate core courses, more tailored for the experience level of fellows.\n\n===Academic partnerships===\nStanford GSB has a number of relationships with other leading business schools.  It offers a number of Executive Education programs jointly with [[Harvard Business School]].  It also offers one of the three Sloan Fellows programs, coordinating with the others at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] and the [[London Business School]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bradshaw |first=Della |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/2d0cc00a-6c3e-11e1-b00f-00144feab49a.html#axzz1qjYo5sXe |title=A degree of choice for the older and wiser student |publisher=FT.com |date=2012-03-19 |accessdate=2016-07-19}}</ref>\n\n==Certificate programs==\n\n===Stanford LEAD Professional Certificate===\n\nThe Stanford LEAD program (\u201cLEAD\u201d stands for learn, engage, accelerate, and disrupt)<ref>{{cite web|last=Stanford Graduate School of Business|title=Stanford LEAD Program|url=https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/exec-ed/programs/stanford-lead|accessdate=March 9, 2020}}</ref> is a one-year online business program in the Graduate School of Business offering access to curricular materials and students specialize personal leadership.

She worked in a Paris sweet shop at age 10 and a dress shop at 13, when she was raped in the street by an older man. She modelled for the painter [[Jean-Baptiste Camille Corot|Corot]], whose studio was in the district where she lived. At a young age she began work as a prostitute in the lorettes: \"respectable mistresses\", between the lower-class streetwalker or grisette and upper-class courtesan. Nevertheless, this was still clandestine prostitution, often in doorways, and came with the risk of police arrest or having one's head shaved as punishment or humiliation.<ref name=\"Match\">[[Claire Castillon]], [http://www.parismatch.com/Royal-Blog/royaute-francaise/Valtesse-de-la-Bigne-coucher-pour-arriver-578894 \u00ab Valtesse de la Bigne, coucher pour arriver \u00bb], ''[[Paris Match]]'', week of 31 July-6 August 2014, pages 97\u2013100.</ref>\n\nQuickly moving onto rich clients, she trained at the [[Bal Mabille]] on Sundays and worked in a women's underwear shop on the Champ-de-Mars, frequented by high-ranking officers, enabling her to dream of social climbing. There she met and fell in love with a 20-year-old man, Richard Fossey, with whom she had two children, though Fossey left her to go to Algeria two years later without marrying her as he had promised. \n\nde La Bigne entrusted her two children to her mother, who later on took them to live in the countryside. Following the death of her younger daughter while in her mother's care, de La Bigne won a public court case against her mother, who was allowing history to repeat itself as her granddaughter became increasingly drawn into the prostitution of France's demimonde. After winning custody of her one remaining daughter \u2014 with whom she became pregnant at age 16 \u2014 de La Bigne had her placed into a Catholic boarding school. Later, bitter at her loss of regular income in lieu of providing childcare, her mother assaulted de La Bigne's housekeeper Camille, a childhood friend, who also took her to court, but her case was thrown out. <ref> Catherine Hewitt, The Mistress of Paris.</ref>\n\n\u00c9milie-Louise Delabigne took the pseudonym \"Valtesse\" due to its similarity to \"Votre Altesse\" (your highness) \u2014 she later advised [[Liane de Pougy|Anne-Marie Chassaigne]] to take a pseudonym as well. She also resolved never to marry but to gain money and social position by other means.

The island of [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] is considered the most southerly point in the United Kingdom, being over {{convert|4|mi}} further south than the most southerly point of the [[British mainland]] at [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]].\n\nThe population of all the islands at the 2011 census was 2,203.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/scilly-islands/e06000053 |title=UK Census Data 2011 |work=UK Census Data |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}</ref> Scilly forms part of the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Cornwall, and some services are combined with those of Cornwall. However, since 1890, the islands have had a separate local authority. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a county council and today is known as the [[Council of the Isles of Scilly]].\n\nThe adjective \"Scillonian\" is sometimes used for people or things related to the archipelago. The [[Duchy of Cornwall]] owns most of the [[freehold (law)|freehold]] land on the islands. Tourism is a major part of the local economy, along with agriculture\u2014particularly the production of [[cut flowers]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe islands may correspond to the [[Cassiterides]] ('Tin Isles') believed by some to have been visited by the [[Phoenicia]]ns and mentioned by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However, the archipelago itself does not contain much [[tin]].\n\nThe isles were off the coast of the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic Celtic]] kingdom of [[Dumnonia]] and later its offshoot, Kernow ([[Cornwall]]), and may have been a part of these polities until their conquest by the English in the 10th century AD.\n\nIt is likely that until relatively recent times the islands were much larger and perhaps joined together into one island named Ennor. Rising sea levels flooded the central plain around 400\u2013500 AD, forming the current 55 islands and islets, if an island is defined as \"land surrounded by water at high tide and supporting land vegetation\".<ref>'The Fortunate Islands' by R.L.

Born {{circa}} 960, Olaf had raided various European cities and fought in several wars. In 986 he met a Christian [[clairvoyance|seer]] on the Isles of Scilly. He was probably a follower of [[Priscillian]] and part of the tiny Christian community that was exiled here from Spain by [[Emperor Maximus]] for [[Priscillianism]]. In [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s Royal Sagas of Norway, it is stated that this seer told him:\n<blockquote>Thou wilt become a renowned king, and do celebrated deeds. Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and others' good; and that thou mayst have no doubt of the truth of this answer, listen to these tokens. When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and immediately thou shalt let thyself be baptised.</blockquote>\n\nThe legend continues that, as the seer foretold, Olaf was attacked by a group of [[Mutiny|mutineers]] upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the [[Haakon Jarl]] was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.\n\nWith the [[Norman Conquest]], the Isles of Scilly came more under centralised control. About 20 years later, the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] was conducted. The islands would have formed part of the \"[[Exeter]] Domesday\" circuit, which included Cornwall, [[Devon]], Dorset, [[Somerset]], and [[Wiltshire]].\n\nIn the mid-12th century, there was reportedly a Viking attack on the Isles of Scilly, called '''{{lang|non|Syllingar}}''' by the Norse,<ref name=\"OrkSaga\">Anderson, Joseph (Ed.) (1893) ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]''. Translated by J\u00f3n A. Hjaltalin & Gilbert Goudie. Edinburgh.

Then they returned to the Orkneys.<ref name=OrkSaga /></blockquote>\n\n\"{{lang|non|Mar\u00eduh\u00f6fn}}\" literally means \"Mary's Harbour/Haven\". The name does not make it clear if it referred to a harbour on a larger island than today's St Mary's, or a whole island.\n\nIt is generally considered that Cornwall, and possibly the Isles of Scilly, came under the dominion of the English Crown late in the reign of [[\u00c6thelstan]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 924\u2013939). In early times one group of islands was in the possession of a confederacy of hermits. [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] (r. 1100\u201335) gave it to the [[Tavistock Abbey|abbey of Tavistock]] who established a priory on [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], which was abolished at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cornish Church Guide |last=Henderson |first=Charles |location=Truro |publisher=Oscar Blackford |year=1925 |page=194 }}</ref>\n\n===Later Middle Ages and early modern period===\n[[File:Kernow Hundreds.png|thumb|Scilly was one of the [[Hundreds of Cornwall]] (formerly known as Cornish Shires) in the early 19th century.]]\n[[File:Scilly-bartholomew02 large.jpg|thumb|Scilly Isles: map by John Bartholomew (1874)]]\n\nAt the turn of the 14th century, the Abbot and convent of Tavistock Abbey petitioned the king,\n\n<blockquote>stat[ing] that they hold certain isles in the sea between Cornwall and Ireland, of which the largest is called Scilly, to which ships come passing between France, Normandy, Spain, [[Bayonne]], [[Gascony]], Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Cornwall: and, because they feel that in the event of a war breaking out between the kings of England and France, or between any of the other places mentioned, they would not have enough power to do justice to these sailors, they ask that they might exchange these islands for lands in Devon, saving the churches on the islands appropriated to them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7710638&queryType=1&resultcount=7 |title=Petitioners: Abbot and convent of Tavistock.

The names provide a wide variety of origins, e.g. Robert and Henry Sage (English), Richard de Tregenestre (Cornish), Ace de Veldre (French), Davy Gogch (possibly Welsh, or Cornish), and Adam le Fuiz Yaldicz (Spanish?).\n\nIt is not known at what point the islanders stopped speaking the [[Cornish language]], but the language seems to have gone into decline in Cornwall beginning in the [[Late Middle Ages]]; it was still dominant between the islands and Bodmin at the time of the Reformation, but it suffered an accelerated decline thereafter. The islands appear to have lost the old Celtic language before parts of [[Penwith]] on the mainland, in contrast to the history of [[Irish language|Irish]] or [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] captured the isles, only to see their garrison mutiny and return the isles to the [[Cavalier|Royalists]]. By 1651 the Royalist governor, [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath|Sir John Grenville]], was using the islands as a base for [[privateering]] raids on Commonwealth and Dutch shipping. The Dutch admiral [[Maarten Tromp]] sailed to the isles and on arriving on 30 May 1651 demanded compensation. In the absence of compensation or a satisfactory reply, he declared war on England in June, but declined to challenge Blake for the isles.<ref>Blakemore, Richard J. and Marphy, Elaine. (2018).

Blake's initial attack on [[Old Grimsby]] failed, but the next attacks succeeded in taking [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] and [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]]. Blake placed a battery on Tresco to fire on [[St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], but one of the guns exploded, killing its crew and injuring Blake. A second battery proved more successful. Subsequently, Grenville and Blake negotiated terms that permitted the Royalists to surrender honourably. The Parliamentary forces then set to fortifying the islands. They built [[Cromwell's Castle]]\u2014a gun platform on the west side of Tresco\u2014using materials scavenged from an earlier gun platform further up the hill. Although this poorly sited earlier platform dated back to the 1550s, it is now referred to as [[King Charles's Castle]]. In March 1646 the [[Charles II of England|Prince of Wales]] escaped from Falmouth to the isles before seeking a safer base in Jersey.<ref>Blakemore & Murphy.

They were styled ''Governors of Scilly'' and the Godolphins and their Osborne relatives held this position until 1834. In 1834 [[Augustus Smith (politician)|Augustus John Smith]] acquired the lease from the Duchy for \u00a320,000.{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} Smith created the title ''Lord Proprietor of the Isles of Scilly'' for himself, and many of his actions were unpopular. The lease remained in his family until it expired for most of the Isles in 1920 when ownership reverted to the Duchy of Cornwall. Today, the Dorrien-Smith estate still holds the lease for the island of [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]].\n\n* 1568\u20131608 [[Francis Godolphin (1540\u20131608)|Sir Francis Godolphin]] (1540\u20131608)\n* 1608\u20131613 [[William Godolphin (1567\u20131613)|Sir William Godolphin]] of [[Godolphin Estate|Godolphin]] (1567\u20131613)\n* 1613\u20131636 [[William Godolphin (1611\u20131636)|William Godolphin]] (1611\u20131636)\n* 1636\u20131643 [[Sidney Godolphin (poet)|Sidney Godolphin]] (1610\u20131643)\n* 1643\u20131646 [[Francis Godolphin (1605\u20131667)|Sir Francis Godolphin]] of [[Godolphin Estate|Godolphin]] (1605\u20131647)\n* 1647\u20131648 [[Anthony Buller (1613\u20131679)|Anthony Buller]] (Parliamentarian)\n* 1649\u20131651 [[John Grenville, 1st Earl of Bath|Sir John Grenville]] (Royalist)\n* 1651\u20131660 [[Joseph Hunkin (Governor of Scilly)|Joseph Hunkin]]<ref>Per slate tablet on external wall of Old Town Church, [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly]], inscribed as follows: ''\"To the memory of Francys, the wife of Joseph Hunkyn of Gatherly in the parish of Lifton in Devon, Governour of the Iland of Silly.

The chief agricultural product is cut flowers, mostly [[daffodil]]s. Exposure to [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] winds also means that spectacular winter gales lash the islands from time to time. This is reflected in the landscape, most clearly seen on Tresco where the lush [[Tresco Abbey Gardens|Abbey Gardens]] on the sheltered southern end of the island contrast with the low [[calluna|heather]] and bare rock sculpted by the wind on the exposed northern end.\n\n[[Natural England]] has designated the Isles of Scilly as [[National Character Area]] 158.<ref>[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/158_Isles_of_scilly_tcm6-32162.pdf ''NCA 158: Isles of Scilly Key Facts & Data''], Naturalengland.org.uk.

The designation covers the entire archipelago, including the uninhabited islands and rocks, and is the smallest such area in the UK. The islands of Annet and Samson have large [[tern]]eries and the islands are well populated by [[pinniped|seals]]. The Isles of Scilly are the only British haunt of the [[lesser white-toothed shrew]] (''Crocidura suaveolens''), where it is known locally as a \"''teak''\" or \"''teke''\".<ref>{{cite news |author=Robinson, H.W. |year=1925 |title=A new British animal discovered in Scilly |newspaper=Scillonian |volume=4 |pages=123\u2013124}}</ref>\n\nThe islands are famous among [[birdwatching|birdwatchers]] for their ability to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is generally in October when it is not unusual for several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far-flung islands first.\n[[File:Isles of Scilly NASA.jpg|thumb|The Isles of Scilly, viewed from the [[International Space Station]].]]\n\n===Tidal influx===\nThe tidal range at the Isles of Scilly is high for an open sea location; the maximum for St.&nbsp;Mary's is {{convert|5.99|m|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the inter-island waters are mostly shallow, which at [[spring tides]] allows for dry land walking between several of the islands. Many of the northern islands can be reached from Tresco, including Bryher, Samson and St.&nbsp;Martin's (requires very low tides). From St.&nbsp;Martin's White Island, Little Ganilly and Great Arthur are reachable. Although the sound between St.&nbsp;Mary's and Tresco, The Road, is fairly shallow, it never becomes totally dry, but according to some sources it should be possible to wade at extreme low tides. Around St.&nbsp;Mary's several minor islands become accessible, including Taylor's Island on the west coast and Tolls Island on the east coast. From St.&nbsp;Agnes, Gugh becomes accessible at each low tide, via a [[tombolo]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe Isles of Scilly features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] : ''Cfb'') bordering on a rare 49\u00b0N [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_528495_en.html |title=Isles of Scilly climate |department=news |website=exeter.ac.uk}}</ref> The average annual temperature is {{convert|11.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}, by far the warmest place in the British Isles.

The maximum snowfall was {{convert|23|cm|0|abbr=on}} on 12 January 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/n/MetLIB_13_013_FactSheet_7_Final.pdf |publisher=Met Office |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524004028/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/n/MetLIB_13_013_FactSheet_7_Final.pdf |archive-date=24 May 2014  |title=Fact Sheet \u2013 South West England |page=17}}</ref> Summers are not as warm as on the mainland.

Suitably qualified students after age eighteen attend universities and colleges on the mainland.\n\n==Economy==\n===Historical context===\nSince the mid-18th century the Scillonian economy has relied on trade with the mainland and beyond as a means of sustaining its population. Over the years the nature of this trade has varied, due to wider economic and political factors that have seen the rise and fall of industries such as [[kelp]] harvesting, [[harbour pilot|pilotage]], smuggling, fishing, [[shipbuilding]] and, latterly, [[floriculture|flower farming]]. In a 1987 study of the Scillonian economy, Neate found that many farms on the islands were struggling to remain profitable due to increasing costs and strong competition from overseas producers, with resulting diversification into tourism. Recent statistics suggest that agriculture on the islands now represents less than 2% of all employment.<ref>Gibson, F, ''My Scillionian Home... its past, its present, its future'', St Ives, 1980</ref><ref name=\"partnership\">''Isles of Scilly Integrated Area Plan 2001\u20132004'', Isles of Scilly Partnership 2001</ref><ref>Neate, S, ''The role of tourism in sustaining farm structures and communities on the Isles of Scilly'' in M Bouquet and M Winter (eds) ''Who From Their Labours Rest?  Conflict and practice in rural tourism'' Aldershot, 1987</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:St Martins Daymark.jpg|thumb|The [[Daymark]] (daylight version of a [[lighthouse]]) on St Martins, the nearest point to the mainland of [[Cornwall]].]]\n\nToday, tourism is estimated to account for 85 percent of the islands' income. The islands have been successful in attracting this investment due to their special environment, favourable summer climate, relaxed culture, efficient co-ordination of tourism providers and good transport links by sea and air to the mainland, uncommon in scale to similar-sized island communities.<ref name=\"council\">''Isles of Scilly Local Plan: A 2020 Vision'', Council of the Isles of Scilly, 2004</ref><ref name=\"touristboard\">''Isles of Scilly 2004, imagine...'', Isles of Scilly Tourist Board, 2004</ref> The majority of visitors stay on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], which has a concentration of holiday accommodation and other amenities. Of the other inhabited islands, [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] is run as a timeshare resort, and is consequently the most obviously tourist-oriented. [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]] and [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]] are more unspoilt, although each has a hotel and other accommodation. [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] has no hotel and is the least-developed of the inhabited islands.\n\nThe islands' economy is highly dependent on tourism, even by the standards of other island communities. \"The concentration [on] a small number of sectors is typical of most similarly sized UK island communities. However, it is the degree of concentration, which is distinctive along with the overall importance of tourism within the economy as a whole and the very limited manufacturing base that stands out\".<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nTourism is also a highly seasonal industry owing to its reliance on outdoor recreation, and the lower number of tourists in winter results in a significant constriction of the islands' commercial activities. However, the tourist season benefits from an extended period of business in October when many [[birding|birdwatchers]] (\"birders\") arrive.\n\n====Ornithology====\nBecause of its position, Scilly is the first landing for many migrant birds, including extreme rarities from North America and [[Siberia]]. Scilly is situated far into the Atlantic Ocean, so many American vagrant birds will make first European landfall in the archipelago.\n\nScilly is responsible for many firsts for Britain, and is particularly good at producing vagrant American [[passerine]]s. If an extremely rare bird turns up, the island will see a significant increase in numbers of birders. This type of birding, chasing after rare birds, is called \"[[Birdwatching#Birding, birdwatching and twitching|twitching]]\".\n\nThe islands are home to [[ornithologist]] [[Will Wagstaff]].\n\n===Employment===\nThe predominance of tourism means that \"tourism is by far the main sector throughout each of the individual islands, in terms of employment... [and] this is much greater than other remote and rural areas in the United Kingdom\". Tourism accounts for approximately 63% of all employment.<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nBusinesses dependent on tourism, with the exception of a few hotels, tend to be small enterprises typically employing fewer than four people; many of these are family run, suggesting an entrepreneurial culture among the local population.<ref name=\"partnership\" /> However, much of the work generated by this, with the exception of management, is low skilled and thus poorly paid, especially for those involved in cleaning, catering and retail.<ref>J.Urry, ''The Tourist Gaze'' (2nd edition), London, 2002</ref>\n\nBecause of the seasonality of tourism, many jobs on the islands are seasonal and part-time, so work cannot be guaranteed throughout the year. Some islanders take up other temporary jobs 'out of season' to compensate for this. Due to a lack of local casual labour at peak holiday times, many of the larger employers accommodate guest workers, who come to the islands for the summer to have a \u2018[[volunteer travel|working holiday]]\u2019.\n\n===Taxation===\nThe islands were not subject to [[Income Tax|income tax]] until 1954, and there was no motor [[vehicle excise duty]] levied until 1971.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/travel-living-in-a-world-of-their-own-on-the-shortest-day-of-the-year-simon-calder-took-the-high-road-to-shetland-and-frank-barrett-took-the-low-road-to-the-scillies-as-britains-extremities-made-ready-for-christmas-1469283.html |title=Travel: Living in a world of their own: On the shortest day of the year, Simon Calder took the high road to Shetland and Frank Barrett took the low road to the Scillies, as Britain's extremities made ready for Christmas |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=24 December 1993 }}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Electric golf buggy on St Marys.jpg|thumb|An electric golf buggy on St Mary's; these are road licensed and available for hire, as are bicycles, for use on public roads on the island.]]\n[[File:RMV Scillonian III docked at St Mary's harbour.jpg|thumb|''[[Scillonian III]]'' in St Mary's Harbour]]\n\nSt Mary's is the only island with a significant road network and the only island with public highways; in 2005 there were 619 registered vehicles on the island.

The full trust board is responsible for policy whilst a management team is responsible for day-to-day administration. Its small income and the small number of staff have led to the trust adopting a policy of recruiting volunteers to help it carry out its extensive work programme. While volunteers of all ages are welcome, most are young people who are studying for qualifications in related fields, such as conservation and land management.\n\nLimited housing availability is a contentious yet critical issue for the Isles of Scilly, especially as it affects the feasibility of residency on the islands. Few properties are privately owned, with many units being let by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], the council and a few by [[housing association]]s. The management of these subsequently affects the possibility of residency on the islands.<ref name=\"martin\">Martin D, 'Heaven and Hell', in ''Inside Housing'', 31 October 2004</ref> The [[Duchy Tenants Association]] was formed in 1996 by a number of tenants of the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nHousing demand outstrips supply, a problem compounded by restrictions on further development designed to protect the islands' unique environment and prevent the infrastructural carrying capacity from being exceeded. This has pushed up the prices of the few private properties that become available and, significantly for the majority of the islands' populations, it has also affected the rental sector where rates have likewise drastically increased.<ref name=\"SWHB\">''Sub Regional Housing Markets in the South West'', South West Housing Board, 2004</ref><ref name=\"fleming\">S. Fleming et al., ''\"In from the cold\" A report on Cornwall\u2019s Affordable Housing Crisis'', Liberal Democrats, Penzance, 2003</ref>\n\nHigh housing costs pose significant problems for the local population, especially as local incomes (in Cornwall) are only 70% of the national average, whilst house prices are almost \u00a35,000 higher than the national average. This in turn affects the retention of 'key workers' and the younger generation, which consequently affects the viability of schools and other essential community services.<ref name=\"council\" /><ref name=\"fleming\" />\n\nThe limited access to housing provokes strong local politics. It is often assumed that tourism is to blame for this, attracting newcomers to the area who can afford to outbid locals for available housing. Many buildings are used for tourist accommodation which reduces the number available for local residents. Second homes are also thought to account for a significant proportion of the housing stock, leaving many buildings empty for much of the year.<ref name=\"The Cornishman\">''The Cornishman'', \"Islanders in dispute with Duchy over housing policy\", 19 August 2004</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n===People===\n{{Main|Cornish people|English people}}\nAccording to the 2001 UK census, 97% of the population of the islands are [[white British]],<ref name=ONS1 /> with nearly 93% of the inhabitants born in the islands, in mainland Cornwall or elsewhere in England.<ref name=ONS2>{{cite web |title=Isles of Scilly \u2013 Country of Birth |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276909&c=TR21+0LW&d=13&e=13&g=431427&i=1x1003x1004&m=0&r=0&s=1354783435942&enc=1&dsFamilyId=11 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=6 December 2012 }}</ref> Since EU enlargement in 2004, a number of [[A8 countries|central Europeans]] have moved to the island, joining the Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans who traditionally made up most of the islands' overseas workers.

The island of [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] is the most southerly point in the United Kingdom, being over {{convert|4|mi}} further south than the most southerly point of the [[British mainland]] at [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]].\n\nThe population of all the islands at the 2011 census was 2,203.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/scilly-islands/e06000053 |title=UK Census Data 2011 |work=UK Census Data |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}</ref> Scilly forms part of the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Cornwall, and some services are combined with those of Cornwall. However, since 1890, the islands have had a separate local authority. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a county council and today is known as the [[Council of the Isles of Scilly]].\n\nThe adjective \"Scillonian\" is sometimes used for people or things related to the archipelago. The [[Duchy of Cornwall]] owns most of the [[freehold (law)|freehold]] land on the islands. Tourism is a major part of the local economy, along with agriculture\u2014particularly the production of [[cut flowers]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe islands may correspond to the [[Cassiterides]] ('Tin Isles') believed by some to have been visited by the [[Phoenicia]]ns and mentioned by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However, the archipelago itself does not contain much [[tin]].\n\nThe isles were off the coast of the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic Celtic]] kingdom of [[Dumnonia]] and later its offshoot, Kernow ([[Cornwall]]), and may have been a part of these polities until their conquest by the English in the 10th century AD.\n\nIt is likely that until relatively recent times the islands were much larger and perhaps joined together into one island named Ennor. Rising sea levels flooded the central plain around 400\u2013500 AD, forming the current 55 islands and islets, if an island is defined as \"land surrounded by water at high tide and supporting land vegetation\".<ref>'The Fortunate Islands' by R.L.

Born {{circa}} 960, Olaf had raided various European cities and fought in several wars. In 986 he met a Christian [[clairvoyance|seer]] on the Isles of Scilly. He was probably a follower of [[Priscillian]] and part of the tiny Christian community that was exiled here from Spain by [[Emperor Maximus]] for [[Priscillianism]]. In [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s Royal Sagas of Norway, it is stated that this seer told him:\n<blockquote>Thou wilt become a renowned king, and do celebrated deeds. Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and others' good; and that thou mayst have no doubt of the truth of this answer, listen to these tokens. When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and immediately thou shalt let thyself be baptised.</blockquote>\n\nThe legend continues that, as the seer foretold, Olaf was attacked by a group of [[Mutiny|mutineers]] upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the [[Haakon Jarl]] was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.\n\nWith the [[Norman Conquest]], the Isles of Scilly came more under centralised control. About 20 years later, the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] was conducted. The islands would have formed part of the \"[[Exeter]] Domesday\" circuit, which included Cornwall, [[Devon]], Dorset, [[Somerset]], and [[Wiltshire]].\n\nIn the mid-12th century, there was reportedly a Viking attack on the Isles of Scilly, called '''{{lang|non|Syllingar}}''' by the Norse,<ref name=\"OrkSaga\">Anderson, Joseph (Ed.)

In early times one group of islands was in the possession of a confederacy of hermits. [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] (r. 1100\u201335) gave it to the [[Tavistock Abbey|abbey of Tavistock]] who established a priory on [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], which was abolished at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cornish Church Guide |last=Henderson |first=Charles |location=Truro |publisher=Oscar Blackford |year=1925 |page=194 }}</ref>\n\n===Later Middle Ages and early modern period===\n[[File:Kernow Hundreds.png|thumb|Scilly was one of the [[Hundreds of Cornwall]] (formerly known as Cornish Shires) in the early 19th century.]]\n[[File:Scilly-bartholomew02 large.jpg|thumb|Scilly Isles: map by John Bartholomew (1874)]]\n\nAt the turn of the 14th century, the Abbot and convent of Tavistock Abbey petitioned the king,\n\n<blockquote>stat[ing] that they hold certain isles in the sea between Cornwall and Ireland, of which the largest is called Scilly, to which ships come passing between France, Normandy, Spain, [[Bayonne]], [[Gascony]], Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Cornwall: and, because they feel that in the event of a war breaking out between the kings of England and France, or between any of the other places mentioned, they would not have enough power to do justice to these sailors, they ask that they might exchange these islands for lands in Devon, saving the churches on the islands appropriated to them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7710638&queryType=1&resultcount=7 |title=Petitioners: Abbot and convent of Tavistock.

The names provide a wide variety of origins, e.g. Robert and Henry Sage (English), Richard de Tregenestre (Cornish), Ace de Veldre (French), Davy Gogch (possibly Welsh, or Cornish), and Adam le Fuiz Yaldicz (Spanish?).\n\nIt is not known at what point the islanders stopped speaking the [[Cornish language]], but the language seems to have gone into decline in Cornwall beginning in the [[Late Middle Ages]]; it was still dominant between the islands and Bodmin at the time of the Reformation, but it suffered an accelerated decline thereafter. The islands appear to have lost the old Celtic language before parts of [[Penwith]] on the mainland, in contrast to the history of [[Irish language|Irish]] or [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] captured the isles, only to see their garrison mutiny and return the isles to the [[Cavalier|Royalists]]. By 1651 the Royalist governor, [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath|Sir John Grenville]], was using the islands as a base for [[privateering]] raids on Commonwealth and Dutch shipping. The Dutch admiral [[Maarten Tromp]] sailed to the isles and on arriving on 30 May 1651 demanded compensation. In the absence of compensation or a satisfactory reply, he declared war on England in June, but declined to challenge Blake for the isles.<ref>Blakemore, Richard J. and Marphy, Elaine. (2018).

Blake's initial attack on [[Old Grimsby]] failed, but the next attacks succeeded in taking [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] and [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]]. Blake placed a battery on Tresco to fire on [[St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], but one of the guns exploded, killing its crew and injuring Blake. A second battery proved more successful. Subsequently, Grenville and Blake negotiated terms that permitted the Royalists to surrender honourably. The Parliamentary forces then set to fortifying the islands. They built [[Cromwell's Castle]]\u2014a gun platform on the west side of Tresco\u2014using materials scavenged from an earlier gun platform further up the hill. Although this poorly sited earlier platform dated back to the 1550s, it is now referred to as [[King Charles's Castle]]. In March 1646 the [[Charles II of England|Prince of Wales]] escaped from Falmouth to the isles before seeking a safer base in Jersey.<ref>Blakemore & Murphy.

The chief agricultural product is cut flowers, mostly [[daffodil]]s. Exposure to [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] winds also means that spectacular winter gales lash the islands from time to time.

The islands of Annet and Samson have large [[tern]]eries and the islands are well populated by [[pinniped|seals]]. The Isles of Scilly are the only British haunt of the [[lesser white-toothed shrew]] (''Crocidura suaveolens''), where it is known locally as a \"''teak''\" or \"''teke''\".<ref>{{cite news |author=Robinson, H.W. |year=1925 |title=A new British animal discovered in Scilly |newspaper=Scillonian |volume=4 |pages=123\u2013124}}</ref>\n\nThe islands are famous among [[birdwatching|birdwatchers]] for their ability to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is generally in October when it is not unusual for several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far-flung islands first.\n[[File:Isles of Scilly NASA.jpg|thumb|The Isles of Scilly, viewed from the [[International Space Station]].]]\n\n===Tidal influx===\nThe tidal range at the Isles of Scilly is high for an open sea location; the maximum for St.&nbsp;Mary's is {{convert|5.99|m|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the inter-island waters are mostly shallow, which at [[spring tides]] allows for dry land walking between several of the islands. Many of the northern islands can be reached from Tresco, including Bryher, Samson and St.&nbsp;Martin's (requires very low tides). From St.&nbsp;Martin's White Island, Little Ganilly and Great Arthur are reachable. Although the sound between St.&nbsp;Mary's and Tresco, The Road, is fairly shallow, it never becomes totally dry, but according to some sources it should be possible to wade at extreme low tides. Around St.&nbsp;Mary's several minor islands become accessible, including Taylor's Island on the west coast and Tolls Island on the east coast. From St.&nbsp;Agnes, Gugh becomes accessible at each low tide, via a [[tombolo]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe Isles of Scilly features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] : ''Cfb'') bordering on a rare 49\u00b0N [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_528495_en.html |title=Isles of Scilly climate |department=news |website=exeter.ac.uk}}</ref> The average annual temperature is {{convert|11.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}, by far the warmest place in the British Isles.

Suitably qualified students after age eighteen attend universities and colleges on the mainland.\n\n==Economy==\n===Historical context===\nSince the mid-18th century the Scillonian economy has relied on trade with the mainland and beyond as a means of sustaining its population. Over the years the nature of this trade has varied, due to wider economic and political factors that have seen the rise and fall of industries such as [[kelp]] harvesting, [[harbour pilot|pilotage]], smuggling, fishing, [[shipbuilding]] and, latterly, [[floriculture|flower farming]]. In a 1987 study of the Scillonian economy, Neate found that many farms on the islands were struggling to remain profitable due to increasing costs and strong competition from overseas producers, with resulting diversification into tourism. Recent statistics suggest that agriculture on the islands now represents less than 2% of all employment.<ref>Gibson, F, ''My Scillionian Home... its past, its present, its future'', St Ives, 1980</ref><ref name=\"partnership\">''Isles of Scilly Integrated Area Plan 2001\u20132004'', Isles of Scilly Partnership 2001</ref><ref>Neate, S, ''The role of tourism in sustaining farm structures and communities on the Isles of Scilly'' in M Bouquet and M Winter (eds) ''Who From Their Labours Rest?  Conflict and practice in rural tourism'' Aldershot, 1987</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:St Martins Daymark.jpg|thumb|The [[Daymark]] (daylight version of a [[lighthouse]]) on St Martins, the nearest point to the mainland of [[Cornwall]].]]\n\nToday, tourism is estimated to account for 85 percent of the islands' income. The islands have been successful in attracting this investment due to their special environment, favourable summer climate, relaxed culture, efficient co-ordination of tourism providers and good transport links by sea and air to the mainland, uncommon in scale to similar-sized island communities.<ref name=\"council\">''Isles of Scilly Local Plan: A 2020 Vision'', Council of the Isles of Scilly, 2004</ref><ref name=\"touristboard\">''Isles of Scilly 2004, imagine...'', Isles of Scilly Tourist Board, 2004</ref> The majority of visitors stay on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], which has a concentration of holiday accommodation and other amenities. Of the other inhabited islands, [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] is run as a timeshare resort, and is consequently the most obviously tourist-oriented. [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]] and [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]] are more unspoilt, although each has a hotel and other accommodation. [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] has no hotel and is the least-developed of the inhabited islands.\n\nThe islands' economy is highly dependent on tourism, even by the standards of other island communities. \"The concentration [on] a small number of sectors is typical of most similarly sized UK island communities. However, it is the degree of concentration, which is distinctive along with the overall importance of tourism within the economy as a whole and the very limited manufacturing base that stands out\".<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nTourism is also a highly seasonal industry owing to its reliance on outdoor recreation, and the lower number of tourists in winter results in a significant constriction of the islands' commercial activities. However, the tourist season benefits from an extended period of business in October when many [[birding|birdwatchers]] (\"birders\") arrive.\n\n====Ornithology====\nBecause of its position, Scilly is the first landing for many migrant birds, including extreme rarities from North America and [[Siberia]]. Scilly is situated far into the Atlantic Ocean, so many American vagrant birds will make first European landfall in the archipelago.\n\nScilly is responsible for many firsts for Britain, and is particularly good at producing vagrant American [[passerine]]s. If an extremely rare bird turns up, the island will see a significant increase in numbers of birders. This type of birding, chasing after rare birds, is called \"[[Birdwatching#Birding, birdwatching and twitching|twitching]]\".\n\nThe islands are home to [[ornithologist]] [[Will Wagstaff]].\n\n===Employment===\nThe predominance of tourism means that \"tourism is by far the main sector throughout each of the individual islands, in terms of employment... [and] this is much greater than other remote and rural areas in the United Kingdom\". Tourism accounts for approximately 63% of all employment.<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nBusinesses dependent on tourism, with the exception of a few hotels, tend to be small enterprises typically employing fewer than four people; many of these are family run, suggesting an entrepreneurial culture among the local population.<ref name=\"partnership\" /> However, much of the work generated by this, with the exception of management, is low skilled and thus poorly paid, especially for those involved in cleaning, catering and retail.<ref>J.Urry, ''The Tourist Gaze'' (2nd edition), London, 2002</ref>\n\nBecause of the seasonality of tourism, many jobs on the islands are seasonal and part-time, so work cannot be guaranteed throughout the year. Some islanders take up other temporary jobs 'out of season' to compensate for this. Due to a lack of local casual labour at peak holiday times, many of the larger employers accommodate guest workers, who come to the islands for the summer to have a \u2018[[volunteer travel|working holiday]]\u2019.\n\n===Taxation===\nThe islands were not subject to [[Income Tax|income tax]] until 1954, and there was no motor [[vehicle excise duty]] levied until 1971.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/travel-living-in-a-world-of-their-own-on-the-shortest-day-of-the-year-simon-calder-took-the-high-road-to-shetland-and-frank-barrett-took-the-low-road-to-the-scillies-as-britains-extremities-made-ready-for-christmas-1469283.html |title=Travel: Living in a world of their own: On the shortest day of the year, Simon Calder took the high road to Shetland and Frank Barrett took the low road to the Scillies, as Britain's extremities made ready for Christmas |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=24 December 1993 }}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Electric golf buggy on St Marys.jpg|thumb|An electric golf buggy on St Mary's; these are road licensed and available for hire, as are bicycles, for use on public roads on the island.]]\n[[File:RMV Scillonian III docked at St Mary's harbour.jpg|thumb|''[[Scillonian III]]'' in St Mary's Harbour]]\n\nSt Mary's is the only island with a significant road network and the only island with public highways; in 2005 there were 619 registered vehicles on the island.

[[Fixed-wing aircraft]] services, operated by [[Isles of Scilly Skybus]], operate from [[Land's End Airport|Land's End]], [[Newquay Cornwall Airport|Newquay]] and [[Exeter International Airport|Exeter]].<ref name=iossb>{{cite web |url=http://www.islesofscilly-travel.co.uk/timetable_skybus.asp |title=Skybus Timetables |publisher=Skybus |accessdate=8 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116023855/http://www.islesofscilly-travel.co.uk/timetable_skybus.asp |archivedate=16 November 2013}}</ref>  There is currently no Sunday air transport.\n\nAt present all air and sea, passenger and freight transport between the Isles of Scilly and the mainland is owned by one company - The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company.  This is often blamed for high year-on-year fare increases.  There have been various local attempts to create competition, but as yet none have succeeded.\n\nThe scheduled [[helicopter]] service, which previously linked [[Penzance Heliport]] with St Mary's Airport and [[Tresco Heliport]], ceased at the end of October 2012. A new heliport is currently under construction in Penzance and helicopter services to Tresco and St Mary's are expected to commence in 2019 or 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://penzanceheliport.co.uk/|title=Isles of Scilly Helicopter from Penzance Heliport|website=Penzance Heliport|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\nThe [[freehold (law)|freehold land]] of the islands is the property of the Duchy of Cornwall (except for [[Hugh Town]] on St Mary's, which was sold to the inhabitants in 1949).

The full trust board is responsible for policy whilst a management team is responsible for day-to-day administration. Its small income and the small number of staff have led to the trust adopting a policy of recruiting volunteers to help it carry out its extensive work programme. While volunteers of all ages are welcome, most are young people who are studying for qualifications in related fields, such as conservation and land management.\n\nLimited housing availability is a contentious yet critical issue for the Isles of Scilly, especially as it affects the feasibility of residency on the islands. Few properties are privately owned, with many units being let by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], the council and a few by [[housing association]]s. The management of these subsequently affects the possibility of residency on the islands.<ref name=\"martin\">Martin D, 'Heaven and Hell', in ''Inside Housing'', 31 October 2004</ref> The [[Duchy Tenants Association]] was formed in 1996 by a number of tenants of the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nHousing demand outstrips supply, a problem compounded by restrictions on further development designed to protect the islands' unique environment and prevent the infrastructural carrying capacity from being exceeded. This has pushed up the prices of the few private properties that become available and, significantly for the majority of the islands' populations, it has also affected the rental sector where rates have likewise drastically increased.<ref name=\"SWHB\">''Sub Regional Housing Markets in the South West'', South West Housing Board, 2004</ref><ref name=\"fleming\">S. Fleming et al., ''\"In from the cold\" A report on Cornwall\u2019s Affordable Housing Crisis'', Liberal Democrats, Penzance, 2003</ref>\n\nHigh housing costs pose significant problems for the local population, especially as local incomes (in Cornwall) are only 70% of the national average, whilst house prices are almost \u00a35,000 higher than the national average. This in turn affects the retention of 'key workers' and the younger generation, which consequently affects the viability of schools and other essential community services.<ref name=\"council\" /><ref name=\"fleming\" />\n\nThe limited access to housing provokes strong local politics. It is often assumed that tourism is to blame for this, attracting newcomers to the area who can afford to outbid locals for available housing. Many buildings are used for tourist accommodation which reduces the number available for local residents. Second homes are also thought to account for a significant proportion of the housing stock, leaving many buildings empty for much of the year.<ref name=\"The Cornishman\">''The Cornishman'', \"Islanders in dispute with Duchy over housing policy\", 19 August 2004</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n===People===\n{{Main|Cornish people|English people}}\nAccording to the 2001 UK census, 97% of the population of the islands are [[white British]],<ref name=ONS1 /> with nearly 93% of the inhabitants born in the islands, in mainland Cornwall or elsewhere in England.<ref name=ONS2>{{cite web |title=Isles of Scilly \u2013 Country of Birth |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276909&c=TR21+0LW&d=13&e=13&g=431427&i=1x1003x1004&m=0&r=0&s=1354783435942&enc=1&dsFamilyId=11 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=6 December 2012 }}</ref> Since EU enlargement in 2004, a number of [[A8 countries|central Europeans]] have moved to the island, joining the Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans who traditionally made up most of the islands' overseas workers.

Gig racing has been said to derive from the race to collect [[marine salvage|salvage]] from shipwrecks on the rocks around Scilly, but the race was actually to deliver a [[harbour pilot|pilot]] onto incoming vessels, to guide them through the hazardous reefs and shallows. (The boats are correctly termed \"pilot gigs\"). The [[World Pilot Gig Championships]] are held annually over the May Day bank holiday weekend. The event originally involved crews from the Islands and a few crews from Cornwall, but in the intervening years the number of gigs attending has increased, with crews coming from all over the South-West and as far afield as the Netherlands and the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldgigs.co.uk/|title=World Pilot Gig Championships&nbsp;\u2013 Isles of Scilly |author1=Rick Persich |author2=Chairman World Pilot Gigs Championships Committee |accessdate=26 September 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe Isles of Scilly feature what is reportedly the smallest [[association football|football]] league in the world, the [[Isles of Scilly Football League]].<ref>Smith, Rory (22 December 2016).

Diamond''. In that case, a federal judge ruled that the band was not liable for sampling [[James Newton]]'s \"Choir\" in their track, \"Pass the Mic\". The sample used is the six-second flute stab. In short, the Beastie Boys cleared the sample but obtained only the rights to use the sound recording and not the composition rights to the song \"Choir\". In the decision, the judge found that:\n\n{{quote|when viewed in relation to Newton's composition as a whole, the portion is neither quantitatively nor qualitatively significant... Because Beastie Boys' use of the sound recording was authorized, the sole basis of Newton's infringement action is his remaining copyright interest in the 'Choir' composition. We hold today that Beastie Boys' use of a brief segment of that composition, consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background C note, is not sufficient to sustain a claim for copyright infringement.<ref name=legal>{{cite web|title=Newton v.

Diamond''. In that case, a federal judge ruled that the band was not liable for sampling [[James Newton]]'s \"Choir\" in their track, \"Pass the Mic\". The sample used is the six-second flute stab. In short, the Beastie Boys cleared the sample but obtained only the rights to use the sound recording and not the composition rights to the song \"Choir\". In the decision, the judge found that:\n\n{{quote|when viewed in relation to Newton's composition as a whole, the portion is neither quantitatively nor qualitatively significant... Because Beastie Boys' use of the sound recording was authorized, the sole basis of Newton's infringement action is his remaining copyright interest in the 'Choir' composition. We hold today that Beastie Boys' use of a brief segment of that composition, consisting of three notes separated by a half-step over a background C note, is not sufficient to sustain a claim for copyright infringement.<ref name=legal>{{cite web|title=Newton v.

He is the extremely religious, good-natured, cheery next-door neighbor to the [[Simpson family]] and is generally envied and loathed by [[Homer Simpson]] - though there are numerous instances where the two are portrayed as good friends. A scrupulous and devout [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]], he is among the friendliest and most compassionate of Springfield's residents and is generally considered a pillar of the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield community]].\n\nHe was one of the first characters outside the immediate Simpson family to appear on the show, and has since been central to several episodes, the first being [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]]'s \"[[Dead Putting Society]]\". His last name comes from Flanders St. in [[Portland, Oregon]], the hometown of ''Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]]. When he was created, he was intended to just be a neighbor who was very nice, but whom Homer abhorred.\n\n==Role in ''The Simpsons''==\n\nNed is very honest and sincere in carrying out the Christian doctrines of charity, kindness, and compassion. He is frequently shown doing volunteer work, and is rigorously honest and upright, even going so far as to spend an entire day tracking down a Leftorium customer in order to give him the extra change that he had forgotten to hand over. In \"[[Homer's Triple Bypass]]\", he donates a kidney and a lung out of the goodness of his heart to whoever needs them first. He also is a good neighbor to the Simpsons, regularly offering his assistance.<ref name=\"Lover\">{{cite episode |title=Bart the Lover|episodelink=Bart the Lover|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Vitti, Jon; Baeza, Carlos|network=Fox |airdate=1992-02-13 |season=03 |number=16}}</ref> Ned's dogged friendship inspires the loyalty of others; when his Leftorium shop appeared on the verge of bankruptcy shortly after it opened, Homer arranged a bailout with the help of many people in Springfield.<ref name=\"Failed\"/> Despite a meek outward appearance, Ned hides an exceptionally well-toned physique.

Even the Simpsons' couch came from \"the curb outside Flanders' house\". \nHomer has since come to have a [[Love\u2013hate relationship|love-hate relationship]] with Ned, sometimes being his best friend, partly due to Ned's selfless tolerance of him, and other times treating Ned with complete disregard.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Homer Loves Flanders|episodelink=Homer Loves Flanders|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Richardson, David; Archer, Wes|network=Fox |airdate=1994-03-17 |season=05 |number=16}}</ref> Homer seems to genuinely care for Ned, despite still expressing and often acting on feelings of loathing.<ref name=\"Alone\"/> Nowadays Homer seems to regard Ned as more of a nuisance.

He is the extremely religious, good-natured, cheery next-door neighbor to the [[Simpson family]] and is generally envied and loathed by [[Homer Simpson]] - though there are numerous instances where the two are portrayed as good friends. A scrupulous and devout [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Christian]], he is among the friendliest and most compassionate of Springfield's residents and is generally considered a pillar of the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield community]].\n\nHe was one of the first characters outside the immediate Simpson family to appear on the show, and has since been central to several episodes, the first being [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]]'s \"[[Dead Putting Society]]\". His last name comes from Flanders St. in [[Portland, Oregon]], the hometown of ''Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]]. When he was created, he was intended to just be a neighbor who was very nice, but whom Homer abhorred.\n\n==Role in ''The Simpsons''==\n\nNed is very honest and sincere in carrying out the Christian doctrines of charity, kindness, and compassion. He is frequently shown doing volunteer work, and is rigorously honest and upright, even going so far as to spend an entire day tracking down a Leftorium customer in order to give him the extra change that he had forgotten to hand over. In \"[[Homer's Triple Bypass]]\", he donates a kidney and a lung out of the goodness of his heart to whoever needs them first. He also is a good neighbor to the Simpsons, regularly offering his assistance.<ref name=\"Lover\">{{cite episode |title=Bart the Lover|episodelink=Bart the Lover|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Vitti, Jon; Baeza, Carlos|network=Fox |airdate=1992-02-13 |season=03 |number=16}}</ref> Ned's dogged friendship inspires the loyalty of others; when his Leftorium shop appeared on the verge of bankruptcy shortly after it opened, Homer arranged a bailout with the help of many people in Springfield.<ref name=\"Failed\"/> Despite a meek outward appearance, Ned hides an exceptionally well-toned physique.

Even the Simpsons' couch came from \"the curb outside Flanders' house\". \nHomer has since come to have a [[Love\u2013hate relationship|love-hate relationship]] with Ned, sometimes being his best friend, partly due to Ned's selfless tolerance of him, and other times treating Ned with complete disregard.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Homer Loves Flanders|episodelink=Homer Loves Flanders|series=The Simpsons |serieslink=The Simpsons |credits=Richardson, David; Archer, Wes|network=Fox |airdate=1994-03-17 |season=05 |number=16}}</ref> Homer seems to genuinely care for Ned, despite still expressing and often acting on feelings of loathing.<ref name=\"Alone\"/> Nowadays Homer seems to regard Ned as more of a nuisance.

Additionally, it was also the second-costliest season recorded in the North Indian Ocean, only behind the [[2008 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2008]] season. The season has featured eight cyclonic storms, with a record-breaking six of them intensifying to very severe cyclonic storms and one to super cyclonic storm, [[Cyclone Kyarr|Kyarr]]. It is an ongoing event in the annual cycle of [[tropical cyclone]] formation. The North Indian Ocean cyclone season has no official bounds, but cyclones tend to form between April and December, with two peaks in activity in May and November. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern [[Indian Ocean]].\n\nThe season's first named storm, [[Tropical Storm Pabuk (2019)|Pabuk]], entered the basin on January 4, becoming the earliest-forming cyclonic storm of the North Indian Ocean on record. The second cyclone of the season, [[Cyclone Fani]], was the strongest tropical cyclone in the [[Bay of Bengal]] by 3-minute maximum sustained wind speed and minimum barometric pressure since the [[1999 Odisha cyclone]], while being equal in terms of maximum 3-minute sustained wind speed to [[2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2007]]'s [[Cyclone Sidr|Sidr]] and [[2013 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2013]]'s [[Cyclone Phailin|Phailin]]. Further activity occurred in October, and in the latter part of that month, the first Super Cyclonic Storm of the 2010s, [[Cyclone Kyarr|Kyarr]], formed.\n\nThe scope of this article is limited to the Indian Ocean in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], east of the [[Horn of Africa]] and west of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. There are two main [[sea]]s in the North Indian Ocean&nbsp;\u2014 the [[Arabian Sea]] to the west of the [[Indian subcontinent]], abbreviated ''ARB'' by the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD); and the Bay of Bengal to the east, abbreviated ''BOB'' by the IMD.\n\nThe official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre]] in this basin is the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD), while the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) and the [[National Meteorological Center of CMA]] (NMC) unofficially release full advisories. On average, three to four cyclonic storms form in this basin every season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual Frequency of Cyclonic Disturbances (Maximum Wind Speed of 17 Knots or More), Cyclones (34 Knots or More) and Severe Cyclones (48 Knots or More) Over the Bay of Bengal (BOB), Arabian Sea (AS) and Land Surface of India|url=http://www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/images/pdf/climatalogy/frequency-cyclone/ANNUALCD.pdf|publisher=India Meteorological Department|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"IMD 2009\">{{cite report|publisher=India Meteorological Department|pages=2\u20133|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/RSMC-2009.pdf|title=Report on Cyclonic Disturbances over North Indian Ocean during 2009|year=2010|accessdate=May 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204195912/http://imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/rsmc.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-04|author=RSMC&nbsp;\u2014 Tropical Cyclones New Delhi|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Season summary==\n<center><timeline>\nImageSize = width:850 height:205\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:50 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/2019 till:31/12/2019\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/01/2019\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.5,0.8,1)      legend:Depression_(31\u201350_km/h)\n  id:DD     value:rgb(0.37,0.73,1)    legend:Deep_Depression_(51\u201362_km/h)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)    legend:Cyclonic_Storm_(63\u201388_km/h)\n  id:ST     value:rgb(0.8,1,1)        legend:Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_(89\u2013117_km/h)\n  id:VS     value:rgb(1,1,0.8)        legend:Very_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_(118\u2013165_km/h)\n  id:ES     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)    legend:Extremely_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_(166\u2013220_km/h)\n  id:SU     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)    legend:Super_Cyclonic_Storm_(\u2265221_km/h)\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\nBarData = \n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\nPlotData=\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:04/01/2019 till:07/01/2019 color:TS text:\"[[Tropical Storm Pabuk (2019)|Pabuk (CS)]]\"\n  from:26/04/2019 till:04/05/2019 color:ES text:\"[[Cyclone Fani|Fani (ES)]]\"\n  from:10/06/2019 till:17/06/2019 color:VS text:\"[[Cyclone Vayu|Vayu (VS)]]\"\n  from:06/08/2019 till:11/08/2019 color:DD text:\"BOB 03 (DD)\"\n  from:22/09/2019 till:25/09/2019 color:VS text:\"[[Cyclone Hikaa|Hikaa (VS)]]\"\n  from:30/09/2019 till:01/10/2019 color:TD text:\"LAND 01 (D)\"\n  barset:break\n  from:24/10/2019 till:01/11/2019 color:SU text:\"[[Cyclone Kyarr|Kyarr (SU)]]\"\n  from:30/10/2019 till:07/11/2019 color:ES text:\"[[Cyclone Maha|Maha (ES)]]\"\n  from:05/11/2019 till:11/11/2019 color:VS text:\"[[Cyclone Bulbul|Bulbul (VS)]]\"\n  from:02/12/2019 till:07/12/2019 color:TS text:\"Pawan (CS)\"\n  from:03/12/2019 till:05/12/2019 color:DD text:\"ARB 06 (DD)\"\n  from:08/12/2019 till:10/12/2019 color:DD text:\"ARB 08 (DD)\"\n  \n bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/01/2019 till:31/01/2019 text:January\n  from:01/02/2019 till:28/02/2019 text:February\n  from:01/03/2019 till:31/03/2019 text:March\n  from:01/04/2019 till:30/04/2019 text:April\n  from:01/05/2019 till:31/05/2019 text:May\n  from:01/06/2019 till:30/06/2019 text:June\n  from:01/07/2019 till:31/07/2019 text:July\n  from:01/08/2019 till:31/08/2019 text:August\n  from:01/09/2019 till:30/09/2019 text:September\n  from:01/10/2019 till:31/10/2019 text:October\n  from:01/11/2019 till:30/11/2019 text:November\n  from:01/12/2019 till:31/12/2019 text:December\n\n</timeline></center>\n\nThe season had eight cyclonic storms, six very severe cyclonic storms and one super cyclonic storm, becoming exceptionally active. Amid a weak [[El Ni\u00f1o]] event, the season's first named storm, [[Tropical Storm Pabuk (2019)|Pabuk]], entered the basin on January 4, becoming the earliest-forming cyclonic storm of the North Indian Ocean on record, tying with the [[2014 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2014 season]]. The second cyclonic storm of the season, [[Cyclone Fani|Fani]], formed on April 26. Fani became an extremely severe cyclonic storm on April 30, reaching the equivalent of Category 4 status on the [[Saffir-Simpson scale]], then made landfall in [[India]] killing 89 people between [[Odisha]] and [[Bangladesh]]; Fani caused $8.1 billion in damage.\n\nIn early June, a strong pulse of the [[Madden-Julian Oscillation]] (MJO) led to the development of the third cyclonic storm, [[Cyclone Vayu|Vayu]], which formed June 10 in the [[Arabian Sea]] near the [[Maldives]]. The storm subsequently intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm on June 12, after moving northwestward towards northwestern [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. No tropical cyclones formed in the month of July. Deep Depression BOB 03 formed on August 7 before impacting [[East India]] and [[Bangladesh]]. In late September, Deep Depression ARB 02 formed near [[Gujarat]] and intensified into the fourth cyclonic storm of the season, Hikaa. Cyclonic Storm Kyarr formed on October 24 and three days later became the first super cyclonic storm since [[Cyclone Gonu]] in [[2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2007]]. The sixth cyclonic storm and a record-breaking fifth very severe cyclonic storm,[[Cyclone Maha]], formed on October 30 after Kyarr dissipated on November 1. Soon after, on 6th November the remnants of [[2019 Pacific typhoon season#Severe Tropical Storm Matmo|Severe Tropical Storm Matmo]] crossed the Southeast Asia overland and again consolidated into a depression. It further rapidly intensified to very severe [[Cyclone Bulbul]]. Three more Deep Depressions formed in Arabian Sea in quick succession early in the month of December, out of which, one strengthened into the eighth cyclone of the season, [[Cyclone Pawan]], which made landfall in [[Somalia]] on December 6.\n\nTropical cyclones have been recorded in the North Indian Ocean since 1891. The 2019 season was the first since 1902 that experienced the development of six severe cyclonic storms out of eight cyclonic storms; in 1902, five cyclonic storms formed and four of them became severe cyclonic storms.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191104061401/http://www.imd.gov.in/pages/press_release_view.php?ff=20191103_pr_655 |title = IMD \u2013 Press Release}}</ref> The season has also produced the most [[accumulated cyclone energy]] in this basin on record.\n\n==Systems==\n===Cyclonic Storm Pabuk===\n{{Infobox hurricane small\n|Basin=NIO\n|Image=Pabuk 2019-01-05 0410Z.jpg\n|Track=Pabuk 2019 track.png\n|Formed=January 4 ([[2019 Pacific typhoon season#Tropical Storm Pabuk|Entered basin]])\n|Dissipated=January 7\n|3-min winds=45\n|1-min winds=50\n|Pressure=994\n}}\n{{Main|Tropical Storm Pabuk (2019)}}\nOriginally a tropical storm that formed over the [[South China Sea]] on January 1, Pabuk entered the [[Gulf of Thailand]].

After being upgraded by the IMD to a severe cyclonic storm on June 11, and concurrently by the JTWC to a Category 1 tropical cyclone on the [[Saffir\u2013Simpson scale|Saffir\u2013Simpson hurricane wind scale]] (SSHWS), the system began a period of rapid intensification. Vayu strengthened into a very severe cyclonic storm soon afterward, and became a Category 2-equivalent very severe cyclonic storm on June 12. On June 13, the influence of a strengthening [[Horse latitudes|subtropical ridge]] over [[Saudi Arabia]] caused Vayu to gradually slow down and turn to the west, as it approached the coastline of the state of [[Gujarat]] in northwestern India.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/images/bulletin/rsmc.pdf|title=Tropical Cyclone Advisory Bulletin #18|last=Gopal|first=Neetha|date=13

The names were selected by members of the ESCAP/WMO Panel on Tropical Cyclones between 2000 and May 2004, before the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in [[India Meteorological Department|New Delhi]] started to assign names in September 2004.

Ocean cyclone season''' was a hyperactive North Indian Ocean cyclone season, featuring 12 depressions, 11 deep depressions, 8 cyclonic storms, a record 6 severe cyclonic storms, a record 6 very severe cyclonic storms, a record 3 extremely severe cyclonic storms, and 1 to Super Cyclonic Storm, Kyarr. Additionally, it was also the second-costliest season recorded in the North Indian Ocean, only behind the [[2008 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2008]] season. The season has featured eight cyclonic storms, with a record-breaking six of them intensifying to very severe cyclonic storms and one to super cyclonic storm, [[Cyclone Kyarr|Kyarr]]. It is an ongoing event in the annual cycle of [[tropical cyclone]] formation. The North Indian Ocean cyclone season has no official bounds, but cyclones tend to form between April and December, with two peaks in activity in May and November. These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northern [[Indian Ocean]].\n\nThe season's first named storm, [[Tropical Storm Pabuk (2019)|Pabuk]], entered the basin on January 4, becoming the earliest-forming cyclonic storm of the North Indian Ocean on record. The second cyclone of the season, [[Cyclone Fani]], was the strongest tropical cyclone in the [[Bay of Bengal]] by 3-minute maximum sustained wind speed and minimum barometric pressure since the [[1999 Odisha cyclone]], while being equal in terms of maximum 3-minute sustained wind speed to [[2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2007]]'s [[Cyclone Sidr|Sidr]] and [[2013 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2013]]'s [[Cyclone Phailin|Phailin]]. Further activity occurred in October, and in the latter part of that month, the first Super Cyclonic Storm of the 2010s, [[Cyclone Kyarr|Kyarr]], formed.\n\nThe scope of this article is limited to the Indian Ocean in the [[Northern Hemisphere]], east of the [[Horn of Africa]] and west of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. There are two main [[sea]]s in the North Indian Ocean&nbsp;\u2014 the [[Arabian Sea]] to the west of the [[Indian subcontinent]], abbreviated ''ARB'' by the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD); and the Bay of Bengal to the east, abbreviated ''BOB'' by the IMD.\n\nThe official [[Regional Specialized Meteorological Centre]] in this basin is the [[India Meteorological Department]] (IMD), while the [[Joint Typhoon Warning Center]] (JTWC) and the [[National Meteorological Center of CMA]] (NMC) unofficially release full advisories. On average, three to four cyclonic storms form in this basin every season.<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual Frequency of Cyclonic Disturbances (Maximum Wind Speed of 17 Knots or More), Cyclones (34 Knots or More) and Severe Cyclones (48 Knots or More) Over the Bay of Bengal (BOB), Arabian Sea (AS) and Land Surface of India|url=http://www.rsmcnewdelhi.imd.gov.in/images/pdf/climatalogy/frequency-cyclone/ANNUALCD.pdf|publisher=India Meteorological Department|accessdate=30 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"IMD 2009\">{{cite report|publisher=India Meteorological Department|pages=2\u20133|url=http://www.imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/RSMC-2009.pdf|title=Report on Cyclonic Disturbances over North Indian Ocean during 2009|year=2010|accessdate=May 24, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204195912/http://imd.gov.in/section/nhac/dynamic/rsmc.pdf|archivedate=2010-12-04|author=RSMC&nbsp;\u2014 Tropical Cyclones New Delhi|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n__TOC__\n{{clear}}\n\n==Season summary==\n<center><timeline>\nImageSize = width:850 height:205\nPlotArea  = top:10 bottom:80 right:50 left:20\nLegend    = columns:3 left:30 top:58 columnwidth:270\nAlignBars = early\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/2019 till:31/12/2019\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMinor = grid:black unit:month increment:1 start:01/01/2019\nColors     =\n  id:canvas value:gray(0.88)\n  id:GP     value:red\n  id:TD     value:rgb(0.5,0.8,1)      legend:Depression_(31\u201350_km/h)\n  id:DD     value:rgb(0.37,0.73,1)    legend:Deep_Depression_(51\u201362_km/h)\n  id:TS     value:rgb(0,0.98,0.96)    legend:Cyclonic_Storm_(63\u201388_km/h)\n  id:ST     value:rgb(0.8,1,1)        legend:Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_(89\u2013117_km/h)\n  id:VS     value:rgb(1,1,0.8)        legend:Very_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_(118\u2013165_km/h)\n  id:ES     value:rgb(1,0.76,0.25)    legend:Extremely_Severe_Cyclonic_Storm_(166\u2013220_km/h)\n  id:SU     value:rgb(1,0.38,0.38)    legend:Super_Cyclonic_Storm_(\u2265221_km/h)\nBackgroundcolors = canvas:canvas\nBarData = \n  barset:Hurricane\n  bar:Month\nPlotData=\n  barset:Hurricane width:10 align:left fontsize:S shift:(4,-4) anchor:till\n  from:04/01/2019 till:07/01/2019 color:TS text:\"[[Tropical Storm Pabuk (2019)|Pabuk (CS)]]\"\n  from:26/04/2019 till:04/05/2019 color:ES text:\"[[Cyclone Fani|Fani (ES)]]\"\n  from:10/06/2019 till:17/06/2019 color:VS text:\"[[Cyclone Vayu|Vayu (VS)]]\"\n  from:06/08/2019 till:11/08/2019 color:DD text:\"BOB 03 (DD)\"\n  from:22/09/2019 till:25/09/2019 color:VS text:\"[[Cyclone Hikaa|Hikaa (VS)]]\"\n  from:30/09/2019 till:01/10/2019 color:TD text:\"LAND 01 (D)\"\n  barset:break\n  from:24/10/2019 till:01/11/2019 color:SU text:\"[[Cyclone Kyarr|Kyarr (SU)]]\"\n  from:30/10/2019 till:07/11/2019 color:ES text:\"[[Cyclone Maha|Maha (ES)]]\"\n  from:05/11/2019 till:11/11/2019 color:VS text:\"[[Cyclone Bulbul|Bulbul (VS)]]\"\n  from:02/12/2019 till:07/12/2019 color:TS text:\"Pawan (CS)\"\n  from:03/12/2019 till:05/12/2019 color:DD text:\"ARB 06 (DD)\"\n  from:08/12/2019 till:10/12/2019 color:DD text:\"ARB 08 (DD)\"\n  \n bar:Month width:5 align:center fontsize:S shift:(0,-20) anchor:middle color:canvas\n  from:01/01/2019 till:31/01/2019 text:January\n  from:01/02/2019 till:28/02/2019 text:February\n  from:01/03/2019 till:31/03/2019 text:March\n  from:01/04/2019 till:30/04/2019 text:April\n  from:01/05/2019 till:31/05/2019 text:May\n  from:01/06/2019 till:30/06/2019 text:June\n  from:01/07/2019 till:31/07/2019 text:July\n  from:01/08/2019 till:31/08/2019 text:August\n  from:01/09/2019 till:30/09/2019 text:September\n  from:01/10/2019 till:31/10/2019 text:October\n  from:01/11/2019 till:30/11/2019 text:November\n  from:01/12/2019 till:31/12/2019 text:December\n\n</timeline></center>\n\nThe season had eight cyclonic storms, six very severe cyclonic storms and one super cyclonic storm, becoming exceptionally active. Amid a weak [[El Ni\u00f1o]] event, the season's first named storm, [[Tropical Storm Pabuk (2019)|Pabuk]], entered the basin on January 4, becoming the earliest-forming cyclonic storm of the North Indian Ocean on record, tying with the [[2014 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2014 season]]. The second cyclonic storm of the season, [[Cyclone Fani|Fani]], formed on April 26. Fani became an extremely severe cyclonic storm on April 30, reaching the equivalent of Category 4 status on the [[Saffir-Simpson scale]], then made landfall in [[India]] killing 89 people between [[Odisha]] and [[Bangladesh]]; Fani caused $8.1 billion in damage.\n\nIn early June, a strong pulse of the [[Madden-Julian Oscillation]] (MJO) led to the development of the third cyclonic storm, [[Cyclone Vayu|Vayu]], which formed June 10 in the [[Arabian Sea]] near the [[Maldives]]. The storm subsequently intensified into a very severe cyclonic storm on June 12, after moving northwestward towards northwestern [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. No tropical cyclones formed in the month of July. Deep Depression BOB 03 formed on August 7 before impacting [[East India]] and [[Bangladesh]]. In late September, Deep Depression ARB 02 formed near [[Gujarat]] and intensified into the fourth cyclonic storm of the season, Hikaa. Cyclonic Storm Kyarr formed on October 24 and three days later became the first super cyclonic storm since [[Cyclone Gonu]] in [[2007 North Indian Ocean cyclone season|2007]]. The sixth cyclonic storm and a record-breaking fifth very severe cyclonic storm,[[Cyclone Maha]], formed on October 30 after Kyarr dissipated on November 1. Soon after, on 6th November the remnants of [[2019 Pacific typhoon season#Severe Tropical Storm Matmo|Severe Tropical Storm Matmo]] crossed the Southeast Asia overland and again consolidated into a depression. It further rapidly intensified to very severe [[Cyclone Bulbul]]. Three more Deep Depressions formed in Arabian Sea in quick succession early in the month of December, out of which, one strengthened into the eighth cyclone of the season, [[Cyclone Pawan]], which made landfall in [[Somalia]] on December 6.\n\nTropical cyclones have been recorded in the North Indian Ocean since 1891. The 2019 season was the first since 1902 that experienced the development of six severe cyclonic storms out of eight cyclonic storms; in 1902, five cyclonic storms formed and four of them became severe cyclonic storms.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191104061401/http://www.imd.gov.in/pages/press_release_view.php?ff=20191103_pr_655 |title = IMD \u2013 Press Release}}</ref> The season has also produced the most [[accumulated cyclone energy]] in this basin on record.\n\n==Systems==\n===Cyclonic Storm Pabuk===\n{{Infobox hurricane small\n|Basin=NIO\n|Image=Pabuk 2019-01-05 0410Z.jpg\n|Track=Pabuk 2019 track.png\n|Formed=January 4 ([[2019 Pacific typhoon season#Tropical Storm Pabuk|Entered basin]])\n|Dissipated=January 7\n|3-min winds=45\n|1-min winds=50\n|Pressure=994\n}}\n{{Main|Tropical Storm Pabuk (2019)}}\nOriginally a tropical storm that formed over the [[South China Sea]] on January 1, Pabuk entered the [[Gulf of Thailand]].
