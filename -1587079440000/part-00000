Permafrost does not have to be the first layer that is on the ground. It can be an inch to over miles deep into the Earth\u2019s surface. Some of the most common permafrost locations are located in the Northern Hemisphere. 85% of Alaska, Greenland Canada and Siberia is sitting on top of a layer of permafrost, that is almost a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere. It can also be located in the Southern Hemisphere, just on mountain tops. Permafrost frequently occurs in ground ice, but it also can be presented in non-porous bedrock. Permafrost is formed from ice holding all different sorts of soil, sand, and rock combination together (NASA ClimateKids).\n\n==Study and classification of permafrost==\n\"In contrast to the relative dearth of reports on frozen ground in north America prior to [[World War II]], a vast literature on the engineering aspects of permafrost was available in Russian. Beginning in 1942, [[Siemon William Muller]] delved into the relevant Russian literature held by the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[United States Geological Survey Library|U.S. Geological Survey Library]] so that he was able to furnish the government an engineering field guide and a technical report about permafrost by 1943\",<ref name=Arctic>{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=H.

Frozen ground is that which is below the freezing point of water, whether or not water is present in the substrate. Ground ice is not always present, as may be the case with nonporous bedrock, but it frequently occurs and may be present in amounts exceeding the potential [[Phreatic zone|hydraulic saturation]] of the thawed substrate.\n\nBy definition, permafrost is ground that remains frozen for two or more years. Since frozen soil, including permafrost, comprises a large percentage of substrate materials other than ice, it thaws rather than melts even as any ice content melts.Thawing is the process of ice, snow, or another frozen substance becoming liquid or soft as a result of warming up whereas melting is when a substance becomes liquefied by heat. One visible sign of permafrost degradation is the [[Drunken trees|random displacement of trees from their vertical orientation]] in permafrost areas.\n\nAs a consequence, precipitation has increased, which in turn results in the weakening and eventual collapse of buildings in areas such as Norilsk in northern Russia, which lies upon the permafrost.<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\" style=\"font-size:100%; line-height:130%\">\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 009.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 010.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 001.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 015.jpg|Permafrost and ice in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2012\nFile:Permafrost thaw ponds in Hudson Bay Canada near Greenland.jpg|Permafrost thaw ponds on peatland in [[Hudson Bay]], Canada in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Permafrost and Peatland Evolution in the Northern Hudson Bay Lowland, Manitoba|url=http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/3332|authors=Larry D.

Permafrost does not have to be the first layer that is on the ground. It can be an inch to over miles deep into the Earth\u2019s surface. Some of the most common permafrost locations are located in the Northern Hemisphere. 85% of Alaska, Greenland Canada and Siberia is sitting on top of a layer of permafrost, that is almost a quarter of the Northern Hemisphere. It can also be located in the Southern Hemisphere, just on mountain tops. Permafrost frequently occurs in ground ice, but it also can be presented in non-porous bedrock. Permafrost is formed from ice holding all different sorts of soil, sand, and rock combination together (NASA ClimateKids).\n\n==History==\n\"In contrast to the relative dearth of reports on frozen ground in north America prior to [[World War II]], a vast literature on the engineering aspects of permafrost was available in Russian. Beginning in 1942, [[Siemon William Muller]] delved into the relevant Russian literature held by the [[Library of Congress]] and the [[United States Geological Survey Library|U.S. Geological Survey Library]] so that he was able to furnish the government an engineering field guide and a technical report about permafrost by 1943\",<ref name=Arctic>{{cite journal |last=Walker |first=H.

Frozen ground is that which is below the freezing point of water, whether or not water is present in the substrate. Ground ice is not always present, as may be the case with nonporous bedrock, but it frequently occurs and may be present in amounts exceeding the potential [[Phreatic zone|hydraulic saturation]] of the thawed substrate.\n\nBy definition, permafrost is ground that remains frozen for two or more years. Since frozen soil, including permafrost, comprises a large percentage of substrate materials other than ice, it thaws rather than melts even as any ice content melts.Thawing is the process of ice, snow, or another frozen substance becoming liquid or soft as a result of warming up whereas melting is when a substance becomes liquefied by heat. One visible sign of permafrost degradation is the [[Drunken trees|random displacement of trees from their vertical orientation]] in permafrost areas.\n\nAs a consequence, precipitation has increased, which in turn results in the weakening and eventual collapse of buildings in areas such as Norilsk in northern Russia, which lies upon the permafrost.<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"180\" style=\"font-size:100%; line-height:130%\">\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 009.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 010.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 001.jpg|Thawing permafrost in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2013\nFile:Permafrost in Herschel Island 015.jpg|Permafrost and ice in [[Herschel Island]], Canada, 2012\nFile:Permafrost thaw ponds in Hudson Bay Canada near Greenland.jpg|Permafrost thaw ponds on peatland in [[Hudson Bay]], Canada in 2008.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Permafrost and Peatland Evolution in the Northern Hudson Bay Lowland, Manitoba|url=http://arctic.journalhosting.ucalgary.ca/arctic/index.php/arctic/article/view/3332|authors=Larry D.

Therefore, subsea permafrost exists in conditions that lead to its diminishment.

It convenes International Permafrost Conferences, undertakes special projects such as preparing databases, maps, bibliographies, and glossaries, and coordinates international field programmes and networks. Among other issues addressed by the IPA are: Problems for construction on permafrost owing to the change of soil properties of the ground on which structures are placed and the biological processes in permafrost, e.g. the preservation of organisms frozen ''in situ''.\n\n===Construction on permafrost===\nBuilding on permafrost is difficult because the heat of the building (or [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]) can thaw the permafrost and destabilize the structure. Three common solutions include: using [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]] on wood [[Deep foundation|piles]]; building on a thick [[gravel]] pad (usually 1\u20132 metres/3.3\u20136.6 feet thick); or using [[anhydrous ammonia]] [[heat pipe]]s.<ref name=\"ASCE\">\n{{cite book\n | last = Clarke\n | first = Edwin S.\n | title = Permafrost Foundations\u2014State of the Practice\n | work = Monograph Series\n | publisher = American Society of Civil Engineers\n | date = 2007\n | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O-voTug5apsC&pg=PA34\n | isbn = 978-0-7844-0947-3}}\n</ref> The [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] uses [[Heat pipe#Permafrost cooling|heat pipes built into vertical supports]] to prevent the pipeline from sinking and the [[Qingzang railway]] in [[Tibet]] employs a variety of methods to keep the ground cool, both in areas with [[Frost heaving#Frost-susceptible soils|frost-susceptible soil]]. Permafrost may necessitate special enclosures for buried utilities, called \"[[Utility tunnel#In Arctic towns|utilidors]]\".\n\nThe [[Melnikov Permafrost Institute]] in [[Yakutsk]], found that the sinking of large buildings into the ground can be prevented by using pile foundations extending down to {{convert|15|m}} or more.

Caliciviruses, influenza A, and enteroviruses (ex. Polioviruses, echoviruses, Coxsackie viruses) have all been preserved in\u00a0ice and/or permafrost. Scientists have determined three characteristics necessary for a virus to successfully preserve in ice: high abundance, ability to transport in ice, and ability to resume disease cycles upon being released from ice. A direct infection from permafrost or ice to humans has not been demonstrated; such viruses are typically spread through other organisms or abiotic mechanisms.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA study of late Pleistocene Siberian permafrost samples from Kolyma Lowland (an east siberian lowland) used DNA isolation and gene cloning (specifically 16S rRNA genes) to determine which phyla these microorganisms belonged to.

His role in Mexican law enforcement and his ties with the Gulf Cartel allowed him to recruit several other policemen into the criminal organization's ranks. As a high-ranking leader, Cano Flores served as the regional boss of the Gulf Cartel in Los Guerra, a town in the municipality of [[Ciudad Miguel Alem\u00e1n, Tamaulipas]]. He was also a leader in [[Camargo, Tamaulipas]], where he coordinated heroin, cocaine, and marijuana shipments to the United States.\n\nIn 2010 he was named in a U.S. federal indictment with 19 other high-ranking drug lords of ''La Compa\u00f1\u00eda'' (The Company), a name used to describe the Gulf Cartel and [[Los Zetas]] as a conglomerate. He was arrested by the [[Federal Police (Mexico)|Mexican federal police]] on June 2009 and extradited to the United States while pending drug trafficking charges on 19 August 2011.

Berkeley: University of California.  </ref> The military nature of San Blas distinguished it from the commercial port of Acapulco to the south. A subtext to the founding of San Blas may have been G\u00e1lvez' desire to curtail tax evasion on trade with Asia out of Acapulco, which was controlled by businessmen of Mexico City.<ref>Trejo Barrajas, Den\u00ed, and Marie Christine Duggan. 2018. \u201c[https://www.academia.edu/38076398/28-47_San_Blas_and_the_Californias_00000002_.pdf San Blas and the Californias:] Hispanic Trade in the Northern Pacific Rim in a Time of Great Change\u201d in Mains\u2019l Haul, San Diego Museum of Maritime History.</ref>  Both Acapulco and San Blas tied New Spain to Asia through Manila. G\u00e1lvez also founded a shipyard in San Blas, with the next shipyard being Cavite in the Philippines.  From 1774, navy ships delivered mail from San Blas to Manila. By tradition, the crew could carry private merchandise, so there was a small commercial subtext to San Blas from its inception <ref>Pardo Hern\u00e1ndez, Claudia Patricia (1994).

Mexico: Fondo de Cultura Econ\u00f3mica.  </ref> It was not until crisis broke out in the Spanish Empire in 1810 that San Blas opened its ports to trade between Lima, Panama, San Blas, Guaymas, Monterey and Manila. Silver mined in Mexico's northwest was shipped out of San Blas to pay for imports of goods, particularly from Panama, which was flooded with British products that entered through Jamaica on the other side of the isthmus.\n\nAt first, only two ships were assigned to the port: the [[packet ship]] ''[[San Carlos (1768 ship)|San Carlos]]'', commanded by [[Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez|Juan P\u00e9rez]], and ''El Principe'', commanded by Vicente Vila. G\u00e1lvez ordered four new vessels to be built, one of which was the [[schooner]] ''Sonora'', later sailed in 1775 by [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra]] to Alaska.<ref name=tovell>{{cite book |last= Tovell |first= Freeman M. |title= At the Far Reaches of Empire: The Life of Juan Francisco De La Bodega Y Quadra |publisher= University of British Columbia Press |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-7748-1367-9 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=E8_LXicsIlEC |pages= 163\u2013166}}</ref>\n\nIn many ways, San Blas was a poor choice for a deep sea harbor and settlement. The harbor was so small that it could never hold more than four ships at a time. Silting caused by the nearby [[R\u00edo Grande de Santiago]] resulted in the need for the harbor to be regularly dredged. The climate's stifling humidity and torrential rains from July to October, coupled with extensive [[mangrove]] swamps that surrounded the settlement, resulted in San Blas being plagued by clouds of voracious mosquitoes. A variety of sicknesses were endemic, including [[dysentery]], [[typhoid fever]], [[malaria]], and other fevers.<ref name=tovell/> Naval officers and workers regularly complained about the climate. When [[Alessandro Malaspina]] visited in 1791, he found San Blas's climate so unhealthy that he refused to stay there, instead transferring his operations and some of San Blas' ships and personnel to Acapulco. San Blas's location was useful and logical, however, because it minimized travel time from [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]] and [[Mexico City]] without increasing the total distance to [[Las Californias|the Californias]]. Also, the area around San Blas had a plentiful supply of hardwoods useful for ship building and repair. Fresh water was also available year round.<ref name=tovell/>\n\nA hillside fort was built in 1770 to defend the town's sea trade with the Philippines. Its front has stone carvings of the kings of Spain. On the hill behind the fort are the ruins of the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary, built in 1769. The ruins once contained the bronze bells that are said to have inspired [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s poem, \"The Bells of San Blas\". The ruins of a 19th-century customs house are on Calle Benito Ju\u00e1rez, three blocks from the main plaza.\n\nDuring the colonial period, hardwood forests provided the raw materials for ships that did a brisk trade with the [[Philippines]] and the [[Manila galleon]] until the shipping moved to the port at [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], and later to [[Acapulco]].\n\n==San Blas and California==\n\nSpain's colony in California was supplied by two supply ships out of San Blas which arrived once a year. on March 12, 1768 [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]], Father President of the [[California Missions]], departed for California on the locally built barque ''Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n''.\n\nOn March 16, 1775, the ''San Carlos'' was set to depart San Blas, Mexico, for [[San Francisco Bay]], stopping in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] to unload supplies for the mission there. The vessel was a product of the shipyard established on the Santiago River. Her length was 58 feet, the officers and men numbered 30.\n\n==San Blas and Nootka==\nSan Blas also became the base for [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest]]. The Chinese were willing to pay up to $120 per otter hide (about $2,700 in 2019 dollars) which stimulated exploration of the Northwestern Pacific.  From 1789 to 1795, San Blas was responsible for establishing and maintaining the Spanish post at [[Nootka Sound]] and [[Fort San Miguel]]. For about twenty years in the late 18th century, San Blas was one of the busiest ports and shipbuilding centers on the Pacific coast of the Americas, rivaling [[Acapulco]], the eastern terminus of the trans-Pacific [[Manila galleon]] convoy.<ref name=tovell/>\n\n[[File:Aspecto del Muelle de San Blas.jpg|thumb|A dock in San Blas]]\n\n\nAt its height, the town had 30,000 inhabitants and became headquarters of Spain's General of the Southern Seas.\n\n===Yaqui deportations===\nDuring the 1900s, San Blas served as the arrival port for thousands of [[Yaqui]] men, women and children forcibly removed from their lands and sold into slavery.<ref name=\"TURN\">Turner, John Kenneth, ''Barbarous Mexico'', Chicago: C.H.

The [[Christmas Bird Count]] regularly finds well over 200 species, with a record 292 species in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://audubon2.org/cbchist/count_table.html|title=Historical data for CBC Count Circle Code MXSB|accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref> \n\nThe town is also a gateway, along with the nearby village of [[Matanchen]], to the La Tovara park, an extensive [[mangrove]] forest and federally protected nature preserve accessible by small boat.\n\nThe formerly elegant Playa Hermosa, built in 1951, is on a lonely and beautiful stretch of beach about a mile from the plaza. In the 1960s, Hollywood had a brief hideaway flirtation with San Blas when actors, including [[Lee Marvin]], discovered San Blas for its fishing.

Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez: Visitor General of New Spain (1765-1771). Berkeley: University of California.  </ref> The military nature of San Blas distinguished it from the commercial port of Acapulco to the south. A subtext to the founding of San Blas may have been G\u00e1lvez' desire to curtail tax evasion on trade with Asia out of Acapulco, which was controlled by businessmen of Mexico City.<ref>Trejo Barrajas, Den\u00ed, and Marie Christine Duggan. 2018. \u201c[https://www.academia.edu/38076398/28-47_San_Blas_and_the_Californias_00000002_.pdf San Blas and the Californias:] Hispanic Trade in the Northern Pacific Rim in a Time of Great Change\u201d in Mains\u2019l Haul, San Diego Museum of Maritime History.</ref>  Both Acapulco and San Blas tied New Spain to Asia through Manila. G\u00e1lvez also founded a shipyard in San Blas, with the next shipyard being Cavite in the Philippines.  From 1774, navy ships delivered mail from San Blas to Manila. By tradition, the crew could carry private merchandise, so there was a small commercial subtext to San Blas from its inception <ref>Pardo Hern\u00e1ndez, Claudia Patricia (1994).

De las Minas al Mar: Historia de la Plata Mexicana en Asia 1565-1934. Mexico: Fondo de Cultura Econ\u00f3mica.  </ref> It was not until crisis broke out in the Spanish Empire in 1810 that San Blas opened its ports to trade between Lima, Panama, San Blas, Guaymas, Monterey and Manila. Silver mined in Mexico's northwest was shipped out of San Blas to pay for imports of goods, particularly from Panama, which was flooded with British products that entered through Jamaica on the other side of the isthmus.\n\nAt first, only two ships were assigned to the port: the [[packet ship]] ''[[San Carlos (1768 ship)|San Carlos]]'', commanded by [[Juan Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez Hern\u00e1ndez|Juan P\u00e9rez]], and ''El Principe'', commanded by Vicente Vila. G\u00e1lvez ordered four new vessels to be built, one of which was the [[schooner]] ''Sonora'', later sailed in 1775 by [[Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra]] to Alaska.<ref name=tovell>{{cite book |last= Tovell |first= Freeman M. |title= At the Far Reaches of Empire: The Life of Juan Francisco De La Bodega Y Quadra |publisher= University of British Columbia Press |year= 2008 |isbn= 978-0-7748-1367-9 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=E8_LXicsIlEC |pages= 163\u2013166}}</ref>\n\nIn many ways, San Blas was a poor choice for a deep sea harbor and settlement. The harbor was so small that it could never hold more than four ships at a time. Silting caused by the nearby [[R\u00edo Grande de Santiago]] resulted in the need for the harbor to be regularly dredged. The climate's stifling humidity and torrential rains from July to October, coupled with extensive [[mangrove]] swamps that surrounded the settlement, resulted in San Blas being plagued by clouds of voracious mosquitoes. A variety of sicknesses were endemic, including [[dysentery]], [[typhoid fever]], [[malaria]], and other fevers.<ref name=tovell/> Naval officers and workers regularly complained about the climate. When [[Alessandro Malaspina]] visited in 1791, he found San Blas's climate so unhealthy that he refused to stay there, instead transferring his operations and some of San Blas' ships and personnel to Acapulco. San Blas's location was useful and logical, however, because it minimized travel time from [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]] and [[Mexico City]] without increasing the total distance to [[Las Californias|the Californias]]. Also, the area around San Blas had a plentiful supply of hardwoods useful for ship building and repair. Fresh water was also available year round.<ref name=tovell/>\n\nA hillside fort was built in 1770 to defend the town's sea trade with the Philippines. Its front has stone carvings of the kings of Spain. On the hill behind the fort are the ruins of the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary, built in 1769. The ruins once contained the bronze bells that are said to have inspired [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s poem, \"The Bells of San Blas\". The ruins of a 19th-century customs house are on Calle Benito Ju\u00e1rez, three blocks from the main plaza.\n\nDuring the colonial period, hardwood forests provided the raw materials for ships that did a brisk trade with the [[Philippines]] and the [[Manila galleon]] until the shipping moved to the port at [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], and later to [[Acapulco]].\n\n==San Blas and California==\n\nSpain's colony in California was supplied by two supply ships out of San Blas which arrived once a year. on March 12, 1768 [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]], Father President of the [[California Missions]], departed for California on the locally built barque''Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n''.\n\nOn March 16, 1775, the ''San Carlos'' was set to depart San Blas, Mexico, for [[San Francisco Bay]], stopping in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]] to unload supplies for the mission there. The vessel was a product of the shipyard established on the Santiago River. Her length was 58 feet, the officers and men numbered 30. \n\n\n==San Blas and Nootka==\nSan Blas also became the base for [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest]]. The Chinese were willing to pay up to $120 per otter hide (about $2,700 in 2019 dollars) which stimulated exploration of the Northwestern Pacific.  From 1789 to 1795, San Blas was responsible for establishing and maintaining the Spanish post at [[Nootka Sound]] and [[Fort San Miguel]]. For about twenty years in the late 18th century, San Blas was one of the busiest ports and shipbuilding centers on the Pacific coast of the Americas, rivaling [[Acapulco]], the eastern terminus of the trans-Pacific [[Manila galleon]] convoy.<ref name=tovell/>\n\n[[File:Aspecto del Muelle de San Blas.jpg|thumb|A dock in San Blas]]\n\n\nAt its height, the town had 30,000 inhabitants and became headquarters of Spain's General of the Southern Seas.\n\n===Yaqui deportations===\nDuring the 1900s, San Blas served as the arrival port for thousands of [[Yaqui]] men, women and children forcibly removed from their lands and sold into slavery.<ref name=\"TURN\">Turner, John Kenneth, ''Barbarous Mexico'', Chicago: C.H.

The [[Christmas Bird Count]] regularly finds well over 200 species, with a record 292 species in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://audubon2.org/cbchist/count_table.html|title=Historical data for CBC Count Circle Code MXSB|accessdate=2010-02-12}}</ref> \n\nThe town is also a gateway, along with the nearby village of [[Matanchen]], to the La Tovara park, an extensive [[mangrove]] forest and federally protected nature preserve accessible by small boat.\n\nThe formerly elegant Playa Hermosa, built in 1951, is on a lonely and beautiful stretch of beach about a mile from the plaza. In the 1960s, Hollywood had a brief hideaway flirtation with San Blas when actors, including [[Lee Marvin]], discovered San Blas for its fishing. The hotel is now abandoned.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Unsourced section|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe economy is based on agriculture, fishing, and the tourist industry.
