{"title_page": "Referendums in New Zealand", "text_new": "{{Politics of New Zealand}}\n{{Use New Zealand English|date=February 2020}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2012}}\n[[Referendum]]s (or referenda) are held only occasionally by the Government of [[New Zealand]]. Referendums may be government-initiated or held in accordance with the [[Electoral Act 1993]] or the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0101/latest/DLM317193.html Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993]. Ten [[referendum]]s have been held so far (excluding referendums on alcohol licensing, which were held triennially between 1894 and 1989). Seven were government-led, and three were indicative citizen initiatives.\n\n==Government referendums==\nThe government of New Zealand may, at any time, call for a referendum on any issue. This requires enabling legislation to determine whether the outcome will be binding on the government or merely indicative. This allows parliamentary scrutiny of the issue and wording of the question. There is no constraint on whether an issue is to be decided by the [[New Zealand Parliament]] or by the public, except for where the reserved provisions of the [[Electoral Act 1993]] are engaged. [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM310495.html Section 268] of the [[Electoral Act 1993]] protects some of the provisions of the Act from amendment except in accordance with s 268(2) which requires a majority vote in a referendum of a 75% majority of Members of Parliament.<ref>Electoral Act 1993, s 268.</ref> The protected provisions include, ''inter alia'', the term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], the voting age and the voting method. The provision itself is not protected from ordinary amendment or repeal.\n\nThis has led to the sporadic use of referendums, partly because there is no constitutional requirement, as there is in other countries like [[Australia]] or [[Switzerland]] that have codified [[constitution]]s.\n\nRecent examples are the [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag referendums]] held across 2015 and 2016, conducted by postal vote.\n\n===Constitutional referendums===\nThere is no requirement for a referendum to enact constitutional change in New Zealand. Referendums were held in 1992 and 1993 to decide the nature of [[electoral reform in New Zealand]]. Many groups advocate approval of constitutional reforms by referendums; the [[Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand|Republican Movement]] supports a referendum on whether [[Republicanism in New Zealand|New Zealand should become a republic]].\n\nThere are frequent calls for the use of referendums to decide other constitutional matters, rather than by regular Acts of Parliament. In 2003 the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]] replaced the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] as New Zealand's highest court of appeal with a new [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]], despite calls from [[New Zealand First]], [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] for a referendum to be held on the issue. In 1950 the abolition of the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] by the [[First National Government of New Zealand|First National Government]] was done by Act of Parliament; with additional members of the Legislative Council (MLC) appointed to ensure approval by the upper house, the ''suicide squad''.\n\n{{See also|Constitution of New Zealand}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''Turnout''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 23 September 1967 || 69.7 || Term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] || 68.1% in favour of staying at three year maximum\n|-\n| 27 October 1990 || 85.2 || Term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] || 69.3% in favour of staying at three year maximum\n|-\n| 19 September 1992 || 55.2 || [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|Voting system]] || 84.7% for change, 70.5% to MMP\n|-\n| 6 November 1993 || 85.2 || [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|Voting system]] || 53.9% for MMP\n|-\n| 26 November 2011 || 73.5 || [[2011 New Zealand voting method referendum|Voting system]] || 57.8% for keeping MMP\n|}\n\n===Liquor licensing referendums===\nIn New Zealand, alcohol licensing has historically been decided by referendum. The first of these were compulsory local licensing referendums, held in 1894 and then with each main parliamentary election between 1896 and 1914. Local licensing referendums were eliminated after 1914, apart from 'local restoration polls' to legalise liquor sales in 'dry' districts. In 1910 a referendum on national prohibition of alcohol was introduced, and held in conjunction with every general election from 1911 to 1987 inclusive (except [[1931 New Zealand general election|1931]] and [[1951 New Zealand general election|1951]]). An extra referendum on prohibition was held on 10 April 1919. From 17 December 1919 the additional option of ''state purchase and control'' of liquor (i.e. nationalisation) was added to the ballot. The Sale of Liquor Act 1989 abolished the national liquor referendum. Local restoration polls were still held in areas that were still 'dry', but the last three, [[Mount Eden]], [[Mount Roskill, New Zealand|Mount Roskill]] and [[Tawa, New Zealand|Tawa]], all became 'wet' in 1999. There have been two referendums on [[pub]] closing times.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''% Voters''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 9 March 1949 || || [[Six o'clock swill|Six o'clock closing]] || Three-to-one majority to retain\n|-\n| 23 September 1967 || || [[Six o'clock swill|Six o'clock closing]] || Two-to-one majority for later opening\n|}\n\n===Other referendums===\nThe government may call referendums on any issues on which it wishes. These will usually be on issues on which the government is split. For the 1997 referendum on retirement savings, the decision to hold it was part of the coalition agreement between [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[New Zealand First]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''% Voters''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 9 March 1949 || 54.3 || Allow off-course [[betting]] || 68.0% in favour\n|-\n| 3 August 1949 || 63.5 || [[Compulsory Military Training in New Zealand|Compulsory military training]] || 77.9% in favour\n|-\n| 5 September 1997 || 80.3 || Compulsory [[Retirement plan|Retirement Savings]] Scheme || 91.8% against\n|-\n| 20 November \u2013 11 December 2015 || 48.2 || [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag]], first stage || 50.58% for [[File:NZ flag design Silver Fern (Black, White & Blue) by Kyle Lockwood.svg|25px|border]] [[Lockwood silver fern flag|Silver Fern (Black, White and Blue)]] after 4 counts\n|-\n| 3\u201324 March 2016 || 67.8 || [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag]], second stage || 56.6% for retaining the existing [[flag of New Zealand]]\n|}\n\n==Citizens Initiated Referenda==\n{{anchor|Citizens initiated referendums|Citizens-initiated referenda||Citizens-initiated referendums}}\nThe [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0101/latest/DLM317193.html Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993] allows for citizens to propose a [[Initiative|referendum]]. These are non-binding referendums on any issue in which proponents have submitted a petition to Parliament signed by ten percent of all registered electors within 12 months. There were [http://www.elections.org.nz/events/2017-general-election/2017-general-election-results/voter-turnout-statistics 3,298,009 voters enrolled] for the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], so at least 329,801 signatures would be required at a rate of approximately 904 signatures per day. In reality, more signatures would be required to account for variances in electoral roll numbers, duplicate signatures and signatures that cannot be matched to a registered elector.\n\nThere are procedural requirements governing this process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/have-your-say/seek-a-referendum/|title=Seek a referendum|last=|first=|date=|website=New Zealand Parliament|access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref> It costs [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]500 to file a petition asking for a referendum with the Clerk of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Clerk formally determines the wording of the question, which may be quite different from the original. Once the Clerk receives the completed petition, the number of signatures is initially counted, followed by sample groups of signatures being taken and the signatories' names and addresses checked against the electoral roll. The sampling of signatures is used to estimate the number of valid signatures for the whole petition with confidence, and if the lower confidence interval is more than ten percent of the electoral roll, the petition is presented to the House of Representatives.\n\nWithin one month of the petition's presentation to the House, a date for the poll must be determined. The poll must be held within 12 months of the petition's presentation, unless 75 percent of MPs vote to delay the poll for one year. There is also a $50,000 spending limit on promoting the petition.\n\nNew Zealand, [[Italy]], and [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)#Federal popular initiative|Switzerland]] are among countries whose laws allow for citizen-initiated referendums (CIRs) nationally. Its defenders view it as a form of \"direct democracy\". However, the Citizens Initiated Referendum 1993 went against the advice of the [[Royal Commission on the Electoral System]] 1986. The Commission stated, speaking about referenda more broadly, \"In general, initiatives and referendums are blunt and crude devices.... [that] would blur the lines of accountability and responsibility of Governments\".<ref>Royal Commission on the Electoral System \"Towards a Better Democracy\" [1986\u20131987] IX AJHR H3 at [7.30].</ref>\n\nA total of 33 petitions have been launched since 1993 on a wide range of topics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Only five (one in 1995, two in 1999, one in 2009, one in 2013) have come to a vote. The other petitions failed to gain enough signatures to force a referendum. Achieving the target number of signatures is a requirement for forcing a vote on an initiative proposed by citizens.\n\n===Firefighters===\nThe first citizens initiated referendum was held on 2 December 1995. The question \"Should the number of professional fire-fighters employed full-time in the [[New Zealand Fire Service]] be reduced below the number employed on 1 January 1995?\" aimed to elicit a \"no\" response{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Turnout was low as the referendum was not held in conjunction with a general election. Just over 12% voted \"Yes\" and almost 88% voted \"No\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://1995.electionresults.govt.nz/1995_citizens_referenda/|format=PDF|title=Return of Citizens Initiated Referendum Poll Votes|publisher=[[Ministry of Justice (New Zealand)|Ministry of Justice]]}}</ref>\n\n===1999 election===\nAt the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]] two referendums were put before voters. One was on whether the number of Members of Parliament should be reduced from 120 to 99. Electors overwhelmingly voted in favour of the proposal, with 81.47% voting for this proposal. However, there were no moves to amend the [[Electoral Act 1993]] in line with this result until 2006 when a bill was introduced by [[New Zealand First]] MP [[Barbara Stewart]] to reduce the size of Parliament to 100. The bill passed its first reading, 61 votes to 60 and was referred to Select Committee. The Select Committee returned recommending the bill to not be passed, citing reasons including public misconception on the MMP voting system, population growth, and international comparability.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/067094C5-47A4-43AA-AE7F-5D7C15B55D3E/36327/DBSCH_SCR_3542_3576.pdf |title= Electoral (Reduction in Number of Members of Parliament) Amendment Bill: Report of the Justice and Electoral Committee |year= 2006 |accessdate= 15 August 2012}}</ref> The bill was subsequently voted down 112 to 9 at its second reading.\n\nThe other referendum held in 1999 asked \"Should there be a reform of our Justice system placing greater emphasis on the needs of victims, providing restitution and compensation for them and imposing minimum sentences and hard labour for all serious violent offences?\". This measure passed by 91.78%. There was some debate over the phrasing of the referendum, as the question actually contains five separate questions; voters could agree with some, but not with others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/~wwpubafs/_2001/publications_2001/Massey_News/February/Feb_26/stories/referendum.html|title=Referendum Confuses Voters|year=2007|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Parental corporal punishment===\n{{main|2009 New Zealand corporal punishment referendum}}\nFollowing the submission of a petition on 22 August 2008, the Clerk of the House verified to Parliament that the threshold for a CIR had been reached.

[[ACT New Zealand]], [[Family First New Zealand]], the [[Sensible Sentencing Trust]] and [[Kiwi Party]] all advocate binding referendums.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} However, [[Kiwi Party]] President [[Larry Baldock]] failed to submit enough signatures for a petition that might have led to a non-binding referendum on whether or not binding citizens referenda should be introduced after being granted permission to circulate a petition calling for that innovation, so the status quo remains. Although the Kiwi Party applied for deregistration, the cause has been taken up by the [[Conservative Party of New Zealand]] and its leader, [[Colin Craig]].\n\nBy contrast, [[GayNZ.com]] has run articles strongly critical of the CIR lobby, as well as expressing concerns that CIRs could be abused to strip vulnerable minorities of their legislative protections, as has occurred frequently with referendums against [[same-sex marriage in the United States]] and similar proposals that target [[illegal immigrants]] in that country. In some New Zealand media outlets, the [[Minaret controversy in Switzerland]] has also been cited as one current example of anti-minoritarian abuse of the 'citizens' referendum process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/31/article_8116.php |title=The case against Citizens Initiated Referenda |publisher=Gaynz.com |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"3News_131865\">{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Swiss-ban-mosque-minarets-in-surprise-vote/tabid/417/articleID/131865/cat/268/Default.aspx |title=Swiss ban mosque minarets in surprise vote |date=30 November 2009 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[3 News]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref><ref>Joanne Black: \"Heidi Ho\": New Zealand Listener: 12.12.09: 94</ref>\n\nEven amongst conservatives, the issue has become contentious.

Referendums may be government-initiated or held in accordance with the [[Electoral Act 1993]] or the [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0101/latest/DLM317193.html Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993]. Ten [[referendum]]s have been held so far (excluding referendums on alcohol licensing, which were held triennially between 1894 and 1989). Seven were government-led, and three were indicative citizen initiatives.\n\n==Government referendums==\nThe government of New Zealand may, at any time, call for a referendum on any issue. This requires enabling legislation to determine whether the outcome will be binding on the government or merely indicative. This allows parliamentary scrutiny of the issue and wording of the question. There is no constraint on whether an issue is to be decided by the [[New Zealand Parliament]] or by the public, except for where the reserved provisions of the [[Electoral Act 1993]] are engaged. [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0087/latest/DLM310495.html Section 268] of the [[Electoral Act 1993]] protects some of the provisions of the Act from amendment except in accordance with s 268(2) which requires a majority vote in a referendum of a 75% majority of Members of Parliament.<ref>Electoral Act 1993, s 268.</ref> The protected provisions include, ''inter alia'', the term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]], the voting age and the voting method. The provision itself is not protected from ordinary amendment or repeal.\n\nThis has led to the sporadic use of referendums, partly because there is no constitutional requirement, as there is in other countries like [[Australia]] or [[Switzerland]] that have codified [[constitution]]s.\n\nRecent examples are the [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag referendums]] held across 2015 and 2016, conducted by postal vote.\n\n===Constitutional referendums===\nThere is no requirement for a referendum to enact constitutional change in New Zealand. Referendums were held in 1992 and 1993 to decide the nature of [[electoral reform in New Zealand]]. Many groups advocate approval of constitutional reforms by referendums; the [[Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand|Republican Movement]] supports a referendum on whether [[Republicanism in New Zealand|New Zealand should become a republic]].\n\nThere are frequent calls for the use of referendums to decide other constitutional matters, rather than by regular Acts of Parliament. In 2003 the [[Fifth Labour Government of New Zealand|Fifth Labour Government]] replaced the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|Privy Council]] as New Zealand's highest court of appeal with a new [[Supreme Court of New Zealand|Supreme Court]], despite calls from [[New Zealand First]], [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] for a referendum to be held on the issue. In 1950 the abolition of the [[New Zealand Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] by the [[First National Government of New Zealand|First National Government]] was done by Act of Parliament; with additional members of the Legislative Council (MLC) appointed to ensure approval by the upper house, the ''suicide squad''.\n\n{{See also|Constitution of New Zealand}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''Turnout''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 23 September 1967 || 69.7 || Term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] || 68.1% in favour of staying at three year maximum\n|-\n| 27 October 1990 || 85.2 || Term of [[New Zealand Parliament|Parliament]] || 69.3% in favour of staying at three year maximum\n|-\n| 19 September 1992 || 55.2 || [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|Voting system]] || 84.7% for change, 70.5% to MMP\n|-\n| 6 November 1993 || 85.2 || [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|Voting system]] || 53.9% for MMP\n|-\n| 26 November 2011 || 73.5 || [[2011 New Zealand voting method referendum|Voting system]] || 57.8% for keeping MMP\n|}\n\n===Liquor licensing referendums===\nIn New Zealand, alcohol licensing has historically been decided by referendum. The first of these were compulsory local licensing referendums, held in 1894 and then with each main parliamentary election between 1896 and 1914. Local licensing referendums were eliminated after 1914, apart from 'local restoration polls' to legalise liquor sales in 'dry' districts. In 1910 a referendum on national prohibition of alcohol was introduced, and held in conjunction with every general election from 1911 to 1987 inclusive (except [[1931 New Zealand general election|1931]] and [[1951 New Zealand general election|1951]]). An extra referendum on prohibition was held on 10 April 1919. From 17 December 1919 the additional option of ''state purchase and control'' of liquor (i.e. nationalisation) was added to the ballot. The Sale of Liquor Act 1989 abolished the national liquor referendum. Local restoration polls were still held in areas that were still 'dry', but the last three, [[Mount Eden]], [[Mount Roskill, New Zealand|Mount Roskill]] and [[Tawa, New Zealand|Tawa]], all became 'wet' in 1999. There have been two referendums on [[pub]] closing times.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''% Voters''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 9 March 1949 || || [[Six o'clock swill|Six o'clock closing]] || Three-to-one majority to retain\n|-\n| 23 September 1967 || || [[Six o'clock swill|Six o'clock closing]] || Two-to-one majority for later opening\n|}\n\n===Other referendums===\nThe government may call referendums on any issues on which it wishes. These will usually be on issues on which the government is split. For the 1997 referendum on retirement savings, the decision to hold it was part of the coalition agreement between [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[New Zealand First]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!'''Date''' || '''% Voters''' || '''Issue''' || '''Result'''\n|-\n| 9 March 1949 || 54.3 || Allow off-course [[betting]] || 68.0% in favour\n|-\n| 3 August 1949 || 63.5 || [[Compulsory Military Training in New Zealand|Compulsory military training]] || 77.9% in favour\n|-\n| 5 September 1997 || 80.3 || Compulsory [[Retirement plan|Retirement Savings]] Scheme || 91.8% against\n|-\n| 20 November \u2013 11 December 2015 || 48.2 || [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag]], first stage || 50.58% for [[File:NZ flag design Silver Fern (Black, White & Blue) by Kyle Lockwood.svg|25px|border]] [[Lockwood silver fern flag|Silver Fern (Black, White and Blue)]] after 4 counts\n|-\n| 3\u201324 March 2016 || 67.8 || [[2015\u20132016 New Zealand flag referendums|New Zealand flag]], second stage || 56.6% for retaining the existing [[flag of New Zealand]]\n|}\n\n==Citizens Initiated Referenda==\n{{anchor|Citizens initiated referendums|Citizens-initiated referenda||Citizens-initiated referendums}}\nThe [http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1993/0101/latest/DLM317193.html Citizens Initiated Referenda Act 1993] allows for citizens to propose a [[Initiative|referendum]]. These are non-binding referendums on any issue in which proponents have submitted a petition to Parliament signed by ten percent of all registered electors within 12 months. There were [http://www.elections.org.nz/events/2017-general-election/2017-general-election-results/voter-turnout-statistics 3,298,009 voters enrolled] for the [[2017 New Zealand general election|2017 general election]], so at least 329,801 signatures would be required at a rate of approximately 904 signatures per day. In reality, more signatures would be required to account for variances in electoral roll numbers, duplicate signatures and signatures that cannot be matched to a registered elector.\n\nThere are procedural requirements governing this process.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.nz/en/get-involved/have-your-say/seek-a-referendum/|title=Seek a referendum|last=|first=|date=|website=New Zealand Parliament|access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref> It costs [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]500 to file a petition asking for a referendum with the Clerk of the [[New Zealand House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Clerk formally determines the wording of the question, which may be quite different from the original. Once the Clerk receives the completed petition, the number of signatures is initially counted, followed by sample groups of signatures being taken and the signatories' names and addresses checked against the electoral roll. The sampling of signatures is used to estimate the number of valid signatures for the whole petition with confidence, and if the lower confidence interval is more than ten percent of the electoral roll, the petition is presented to the House of Representatives.\n\nWithin one month of the petition's presentation to the House, a date for the poll must be determined. The poll must be held within 12 months of the petition's presentation, unless 75 percent of MPs vote to delay the poll for one year. There is also a $50,000 spending limit on promoting the petition.\n\nNew Zealand, [[Italy]], and [[Popular initiative (Switzerland)#Federal popular initiative|Switzerland]] are among countries whose laws allow for citizen-initiated referendums (CIRs) nationally. Its defenders view it as a form of \"direct democracy\". However, the Citizens Initiated Referendum 1993 went against the advice of the [[Royal Commission on the Electoral System]] 1986. The Commission stated, speaking about referenda more broadly, \"In general, initiatives and referendums are blunt and crude devices.... [that] would blur the lines of accountability and responsibility of Governments\".<ref>Royal Commission on the Electoral System \"Towards a Better Democracy\" [1986\u20131987] IX AJHR H3 at [7.30].</ref>\n\nA total of 33 petitions have been launched since 1993 on a wide range of topics.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} Only five (one in 1995, two in 1999, one in 2009, one in 2013) have come to a vote. The other petitions failed to gain enough signatures to force a referendum. Achieving the target number of signatures is a requirement for forcing a vote on an initiative proposed by citizens.\n\n===Firefighters===\nThe first citizens initiated referendum was held on 2 December 1995. The question \"Should the number of professional fire-fighters employed full-time in the [[New Zealand Fire Service]] be reduced below the number employed on 1 January 1995?\" aimed to elicit a \"no\" response{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Turnout was low as the referendum was not held in conjunction with a general election. Just over 12% voted \"Yes\" and almost 88% voted \"No\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://1995.electionresults.govt.nz/1995_citizens_referenda/|format=PDF|title=Return of Citizens Initiated Referendum Poll Votes|publisher=[[Ministry of Justice (New Zealand)|Ministry of Justice]]}}</ref>\n\n===1999 election===\nAt the [[1999 New Zealand general election|1999 election]] two referendums were put before voters. One was on whether the number of Members of Parliament should be reduced from 120 to 99. Electors overwhelmingly voted in favour of the proposal, with 81.47% voting for this proposal. However, there were no moves to amend the [[Electoral Act 1993]] in line with this result until 2006 when a bill was introduced by [[New Zealand First]] MP [[Barbara Stewart]] to reduce the size of Parliament to 100. The bill passed its first reading, 61 votes to 60 and was referred to Select Committee. The Select Committee returned recommending the bill to not be passed, citing reasons including public misconception on the MMP voting system, population growth, and international comparability.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.parliament.nz/NR/rdonlyres/067094C5-47A4-43AA-AE7F-5D7C15B55D3E/36327/DBSCH_SCR_3542_3576.pdf |title= Electoral (Reduction in Number of Members of Parliament) Amendment Bill: Report of the Justice and Electoral Committee |year= 2006 |accessdate= 15 August 2012}}</ref> The bill was subsequently voted down 112 to 9 at its second reading.\n\nThe other referendum held in 1999 asked \"Should there be a reform of our Justice system placing greater emphasis on the needs of victims, providing restitution and compensation for them and imposing minimum sentences and hard labour for all serious violent offences?\". This measure passed by 91.78%. There was some debate over the phrasing of the referendum, as the question actually contains five separate questions; voters could agree with some, but not with others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massey.ac.nz/~wwpubafs/_2001/publications_2001/Massey_News/February/Feb_26/stories/referendum.html|title=Referendum Confuses Voters|year=2007|accessdate=16 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Parental corporal punishment===\n{{main|2009 New Zealand corporal punishment referendum}}\nFollowing the submission of a petition on 22 August 2008, the Clerk of the House verified to Parliament that the threshold for a CIR had been reached. Supporters were hoping for the referendum to be held alongside the 8 November general election, but it was decided by Parliament to hold the referendum by postal ballot between 31 July and 21 August 2009.\n\nThe question asked was \"Should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in New Zealand?\"\n\nVoter turnout was 56.1 percent. While 87.4 percent of votes answered 'no',<ref name=\"results\">{{cite web |url=http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/2009_citizens_referendum/2009_referendum_results.html |title=Final Result by Electorate for the Citizens Initiated Referendum 2009 on the question \"Should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in New Zealand?\" |publisher=Elections New Zealand |date=25 August 2009 |accessdate=3 October 2009}}</ref> the question drew widespread criticism from the public, parliament, and even the Prime Minister John Key for being a [[loaded question]] and for the use of the value-judgement 'good'.<ref name=DrSeuss>{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=280&objectid=10580151 |title=Key sees merit in Greens' referendum bill |author=Trevett, Claire |date=23 June 2009 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=30 October 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Opponents of citizens initiated referendums===\nThe perceived lack of implementation<!----The fire-fighters was implemented and you could argue that the criminal justice one has been implemented.  The only clear cases of non-implementation are the 99MP and smacking CIRs----> of successful referendums has led to calls for such referendums to be made binding on the government of the day, similar to the direct democracy said to exist in [[Swiss#Direct democracy|Switzerland]]. [[ACT New Zealand]], [[Family First New Zealand]], the [[Sensible Sentencing Trust]] and [[Kiwi Party]] all advocate binding referendums.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} However, [[Kiwi Party]] President [[Larry Baldock]] failed to submit enough signatures for a petition that might have led to a non-binding referendum on whether or not binding citizens referenda should be introduced after being granted permission to circulate a petition calling for that innovation, so the status quo remains. Although the Kiwi Party applied for deregistration, the cause has been taken up by the [[Conservative Party of New Zealand]] and its leader, [[Colin Craig]].\n\nBy contrast, [[GayNZ.com]] has run articles strongly critical of the CIR lobby, as well as expressing concerns that CIRs could be abused to strip vulnerable minorities of their legislative protections, as has occurred frequently with referendums against [[same-sex marriage in the United States]] and similar proposals that target [[illegal immigrants]] in that country. In some New Zealand media outlets, the [[Minaret controversy in Switzerland]] has also been cited as one current example of anti-minoritarian abuse of the 'citizens' referendum process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaynz.com/articles/publish/31/article_8116.php |title=The case against Citizens Initiated Referenda |publisher=Gaynz.com |date=5 November 2009 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"3News_131865\">{{cite news |url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Swiss-ban-mosque-minarets-in-surprise-vote/tabid/417/articleID/131865/cat/268/Default.aspx |title=Swiss ban mosque minarets in surprise vote |date=30 November 2009 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=[[3 News]] |accessdate=5 November 2011}}</ref><ref>Joanne Black: \"Heidi Ho\": New Zealand Listener: 12.12.09: 94</ref>\n\nEven amongst conservatives, the issue has become contentious. The [[Maxim Institute]] has announced its opposition to binding citizens referendums, citing the adverse fiscal management consequences that have ensued in the state of [[California]] in a recent paper from Richard Ekins, a [[University of Auckland]] legal academic.<ref>Richard Ekins: \"A Government for the People: The Value of Representative Democracy\": http://www.maxim.org.nz/files/pdf/a_government_for_the_people.pdf</ref> Former New Zealand Prime Minister [[John Key]] also opposes binding referendums on fiscal grounds, noting that California's contradictory tax cap and public spending referendums have made state fiscal management chaotic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Binding-referenda-not-a-good-idea---Key/tabid/419/articleID/130818/Default.aspx |title=New Zealand's latest news, sport, entertainment, politics, business |publisher=3 News |date= |accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref> However, a key problem with that argument is that ballot initiatives only make up 2% of the Californian state budget, once Proposition 98 is removed from the equation (Proposition 98 locks in education spending which probably would have been spent anyways and had always occupied about one-third of the Californian budget).<ref>https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=476443</ref>\n\nDuring 2009, there was additional criticism from prominent New Zealand legal academics, such as Andrew Geddis and Bridget Fenton at [[Otago University]]. They argue that CIRs are no substitute for more deliberative processes within the existing framework of [[representative democracy]], such as joining political parties, protest marches, voting within general elections and parliamentary select committee submissions.<ref>Andrew Geddis and Bridget Fenton: \"Citizens Initiated Referenda\" New Zealand Law Journal (October 2009): 334-6</ref>\n\n===Table

Any company that sells products or services to other businesses or organizations (vs. consumers) typically uses B2B marketing strategies.\n\nExamples of products sold through B2B marketing include:\n\n* Major equipment\n* Accessory equipment\n* Raw materials\n* Component parts\n* Processed materials\n* Supplies\n* Business services<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe four major categories of B2B product purchasers are:\n\n* Producers- use products sold by B2B marketing to make their own goods (e.g.: Mattel buying plastics to make toys)\n* Resellers- buy B2B products to sell through retail or wholesale establishments (e.g.: Walmart buying vacuums to sell in stores)\n* Governments- buy B2B products for use in government projects (e.g.: purchasing contractor services to repair infrastructure)\n* Institutions- use B2B products to continue operation (e.g.: schools buying printers for office use) <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== B2C marketing ===\nBusiness-to-consumer marketing, or B2C marketing, refers to the tactics and strategies in which a company promotes its products and services to individual people: creating, advertising, and selling products for customers to use in their everyday lives. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Becker |first1=Michael |title=What Is B2C Marketing? |url=https://emarsys.com/learn/blog/what-is-b2c-marketing/ |website=Emarsys |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nTraditionally, this could refer to individuals shopping for clothes for themselves at the mall, diners eating in a restaurant or subscribers deciding to get pay-per-view TV at home. More recently, however, the term B2C refers to the online selling of products, or e-tailing, in which manufacturers or retailers sell their products to consumers over the internet.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Business News Daily Editor, Exp |title=What is B2C? |url=https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/5085-what-is-b2c.html |website=Business News Daily |accessdate=16 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n\n=== C2B marketing ===\nConsumer-to-business marketing, or C2B marketing is a business model where the end consumers create products and services which are consumed by businesses and organizations.

The main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, amount of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n*Demand: B2B demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product. Businesses buy products based on customers wants and needs. B2C demand is primary because customers buy products based on their own wants and needs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Purchasing volume: Businesses buy products in large volumes to distribute to consumers. Consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Number of customers: There are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Customer concentration: Businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Distribution: B2B products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while B2C products must additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying nature: B2B purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while B2C purchasing is informal.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying influences: B2B purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while B2C marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Negotiations: In B2B marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in B2C marketing (particularly in Western cultures) prices are fixed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Reciprocity: Businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. For example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business's printer ink. In B2C marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Leasing: Businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Promotional methods: In B2B marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling. B2C marketing mostly uses sales promotion, public relations, advertising, and social media.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Orientations ==\n{{main|History of marketing#Orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practice}}\nA marketing orientation has been defined as a \"philosophy of business management.\"<ref name=\":5\">Mc Namara (1972) cited in Deshpande, R., ''Developing a Market Orientation,'' Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage, 1999, p. 11</ref> or \"a corporate state of mind\"<ref>Kohli, A.K. and Jaworski, B.J., \"Market Orientation: The Construct, Research Propositions, and Managerial Implications,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 54, April 1990, pp. 1\u201318</ref> or as an \"organisation[al] culture\"<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Narver | first1 = J.C. | last2 = Slater | first2 = S.F. | year = | title = The Effect of a Market Orientation on Business Profitability | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 54 | issue = 4| pages = 20\u201334 | doi = 10.2307/1251757 }}</ref> Although scholars continue to debate the precise nature of specific orientations that inform marketing practice, the most commonly cited orientations are as follows:<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hollander | first1 = S.C. | last2 = Jones | first2 = D.G.B. | last3 = Dix | first3 = L. | year = | title = Periodization in Marketing History | url = | journal = Journal of Macromarketing | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 33\u201339 | doi = 10.1177/0276146705274982 }}</ref>\n\n===Product===\nA firm employing a product orientation is mainly concerned with the quality of its product. A product orientation is based on the assumption that all things being equal, consumers will purchase products of superior quality. The approach is most effective when the firm has deep insights into customer needs and desires as derived from research or intuition and understands consumer's quality expectations and price consumers are willing to pay. Although the product orientation has largely been supplanted by the marketing orientation, firms practicing a product orientation can still be found in haute couture and arts marketing.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1362/146934706776861573|title = Art for Art's Sake or Art for Business Sake: An exploration of artistic product orientation| journal=The Marketing Review| volume=6| pages=29\u201340|year = 2006|last1 = Fillis|first1 = Ian}}</ref><ref>Sheth, J., Sisodia, R.S. and Sharma, A., \"The Antecedents and Consequences of Customer-Centric Marketing,\" ''Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science,'' Vol. 28, No. 1, 2000, p. 55</ref>\n\n===Sales===\n{{See|History of marketing#Selling orientation}}\n\nA sales orientation focuses on the selling/promotion of the firm's existing products, rather than developing new products to satisfy unmet needs or wants. This orientation seeks to attain the highest possible sales through promotion and direct sales techniques.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Principles of Marketing|last=Kotler|first=Philip|publisher=Prentice-Hall Inc.|year=1980|isbn=|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|pages=}}</ref> The sales orientation \"is typically practiced with unsought goods.\"<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing'', 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 29</ref> One study found that industrial companies are more likely to hold a sales orientation than consumer goods companies.<ref>Avlonitis, G.J. and Gounaris, S.P., \"Marketing Orientation and Company Performance: Industrial vs. Consumer Goods Companies,\" ''Industrial Marketing Management,'' Vol. 26, 1997, pp. 385\u2013402</ref> The approach may also suit scenarios in which a firm holds dead stock, or otherwise sells a product that is in high demand, with little likelihood of changes in consumer tastes diminishing demand.\n\nA 2011 meta analyses<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s11747-010-0211-8|title = Drivers of sales performance: A contemporary meta-analysis.

A production orientation may be deployed when a high demand for a product or service exists, coupled with certainty that consumer tastes and preferences remain relatively constant (similar to the sales orientation). The so-called production era is thought to have dominated marketing practice from the 1860s to the 1930s, but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries. Specifically Kotler and Armstrong note that the production philosophy is \"one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers... [and] is still useful in some situations.\"<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing'', 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 28</ref> \n\n===Marketing===\n{{See|Market orientation}}\n\nThe marketing orientation is the most common orientation used in contemporary marketing. It is a customer-centric approach that involves a firm basing its marketing program around products that suit new consumer tastes. Firms adopting a marketing orientation typically engage in extensive market research to gauge consumer desires, use R&D (Research & Development) to develop a product attuned to the revealed information, and then utilize promotion techniques to ensure consumers are aware of the product's existence and the benefits it can deliver.<ref>McGee, L.W. and Spiro, R.L., \"The Marketing Concept in Perspective,\" ''Business Horizons, May\u2013June, 1988, pp. 40\u201345</ref> Scales designed to measure a firm's overall market orientation have been developed and found to be robust in a variety of contexts.<ref>Hooley, G., Fahy, J., Beracs, J., Fonfara, K. and Snoj, B., \"Market Orientation in the Transition Economies of Central Europe: Tests of the Narver and Slater Market Orientation Scales,\" ''Journal of Business Research,'' Vol. 50, 2000, pp. 273\u201385. Note that the most widely applied scale is that developed by Narver and Slater in Narver, J.C., and Slater, S.F., ''The Effect of Marketing Orientation on Business Profitability,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vo. 54, 1990, pp. 20\u201335</ref>\n\nThe marketing orientation has three prime facets, which are:\n: ''Customer orientation'': A firm in the [[market economy]] can survive by producing [[goods]] that people are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining [[consumer demand]] is vital for a [[business entity|firm]]'s future viability and even existence as a [[going concern]].\n: ''Organizational orientation'': The marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. Information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company's other departments. \n:As an example, a marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. With this in mind, the marketing department would inform the R&D department to create a prototype of a product/service based on consumers' new desires.\n:The production department would then start to manufacture the product, while the marketing department would focus on the promotion, distribution, pricing, etc. of the product. Additionally, a firm's finance department would be consulted, with respect to securing appropriate funding for the development, production and promotion of the product. Finance may oppose the required capital expenditure, since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization.\n:'' Mutually beneficial exchange'': In a transaction in the market economy, a firm gains revenue, which thus leads to more profits, market shares, or sales. A consumer on the other hand gains the satisfaction of a need/want, utility, reliability and value for money from the purchase of a product or service.\n\n===Societal marketing===\n{{main|Societal marketing}}\n\nA number of scholars and practitioners have argued that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior [[Value (marketing)|value]]. Marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups such as employees, customers, and local communities.Companies that adopt a societal marketing perspective typically practice [[triple bottom line]] reporting whereby they publish social impact and environmental impact reports alongside financial performance reports. Sustainable marketing or [[green marketing]] is an extension of societal marketing.<ref>Blackwell Reference, [https://www.econbiz.de/Record/what-consumerism-means-for-marketers-kotler-philip/10002240532 Kotler, P., \"What consumerism means for marketers\"], ''Harvard Business Review,'' vol. 50, no. 3, 1972, pp. 48\u201357; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought,\" ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp. 224\u201332 {{doi|10.1177/0276146706291067}}; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the \"4 Eras\" of Thought Development,\" ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp. 116\u201346</ref>\n\n==The Marketing Mix==\n{{Main|Marketing mix}}\nThe marketing mix is a foundational tool used to guide decision making in marketing. The marketing mix represents the basic tools which marketers can use to bring their products or services to market. They are the foundation of managerial marketing and the [[marketing plan]] typically devotes a section to the marketing mix.\n\n===The 4Ps ===\n\nThe traditional marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision, namely: ''product'', ''price'', ''promotion'', and ''place''.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Jerome E.|title=Basic Marketing. A Managerial Approach|year=1964|publisher=Irwin|location=Homewood, IL}}</ref><ref>Gr\u00f6nroos, Christian. \"From Marketing Mix to Relationship Marketing: Towards a Paradigm Shift in Marketing,\" ''Management Decision,'' vol. 32, no. 2, 1994, pp. 4\u201320.</ref>\n[[File:Marketing Mix 4P.svg|alt=The 4Ps of the marketing mix stand for product, price, place and promotion|thumb|278x278px|One version of the marketing mix is the 4Ps method.]]\n\n==== Outline ====\n\n;[[Product (business)|Product]]\n:The product aspects of marketing deal with the specifications of the actual goods or services, and how it relates to the [[end-user]]'s needs and wants. The product element consists of product design, new product innovation, branding, packaging, labeling. The scope of a product generally includes supporting elements such as warranties, guarantees, and support. [[Brand]]ing, a key aspect of the product management, refers to the various methods of communicating a brand identity for the product, [[brand]], or company. <ref name=\":1\" />\n;[[Pricing]]:This refers to the process of setting a [[price]] for a product, including discounts. The price need not be monetary; it can simply be what is exchanged for the product or services, e.g. time, energy, or attention or any sacrifices consumers make in order to acquire a product or service. The price is the cost that a consumer pays for a product\u2014monetary or not. Methods of setting prices are in the domain of [[pricing science]]. <ref name=\":2\" />\n; Place (or [[distribution (business)|distribution]]):This refers to how the product gets to the customer; the distribution channels and intermediaries such as wholesalers and [[retailer]]s who enable customers to access products or services in a convenient manner. This third P has also sometimes been called ''Place'' or ''Placement'', referring to the channel by which a product or service is sold (e.g. online vs. retail), which geographic region or industry, to which segment (young adults, families, business people), etc. also referring to how the environment in which the product is sold in can affect sales. <ref name=\":2\" />\n;[[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion]]:This includes all aspects of marketing communications; [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]], including [[promotional education]], [[public relations]], [[sales|personal selling]], [[product placement]], [[branded entertainment]], event marketing, trade shows and [[exhibitions]]. This fourth P is focused on providing a message to get a response from consumers.  The message is designed to persuade or tell a story to create awareness.<ref name=\":2\">Borden, N., \"The Concept of the Marketing Mix,\" ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' June 1964 pp. 2\u20137; van Waterschoot, W. and van den Bulte, C., \"The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 56, No. 4, 1992, pp. 83\u201393</ref>\n\n==== Criticisms ====\nOne of the limitations of the 4Ps approach is its emphasis of an inside out-view. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Riding the Waves of Change|last=Gareth|first=Morgan|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1988|isbn=978-1555420932|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ridingwavesofcha00morg}}</ref> An ''inside-out'' approach is the traditional planning approach where the organisation identifies its desired goals and objectives, which are often based around what has always been done. Marketing's task then becomes one of \"selling\" the organisation's products and messages to the \"outside\" or external stakeholders.<ref name=\":1\">Kerr, F., Patti, C. and Ichul, K., \"An Inside-out Approach to Integrated Marketing Communications: An International Perspective,\" ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 4, 2008, pp. 531\u201340</ref> In contrast, an ''outside-in'' approach first seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer.<ref>Porcu, L., del Barrio-Garcia, S., and Kitchen, P.J., \"How Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) works?

Well-designed models should exhibit clearly defined categories that are mutually exclusive, with no overlap. Yet, the 4 Ps model has extensive overlapping problems. Several authors stress the hybrid nature of the fourth P, mentioning the presence of two important dimensions, \"communication\" (general and informative communications such as public relations and corporate communications) and \"promotion\" (persuasive communications such as advertising and direct selling). Certain marketing activities, such as personal selling, may be classified as either ''promotion'' or as part of the place (i.e., distribution) element.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = van Waterschoot | first1 = W. | last2 = van den Bulte | first2 = C. | year = | title = The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 83\u201393 | doi = 10.2307/1251988 }}</ref> Some pricing tactics, such as promotional pricing, can be classified as price variables or promotional variables and, therefore, also exhibit some overlap.\n\nOther important criticisms include that the marketing mix lacks a strategic framework and is, therefore, unfit to be a planning instrument, particularly when uncontrollable, external elements are an important aspect of the marketing environment.<ref>Constantinides, E., \"The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing,\" ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vo. 22, 2006, pp. 407\u201338</ref>\n\n====Modifications and extensions====\n\nTo overcome the deficiencies of the 4P model, some authors have suggested extensions or modifications to the original model. Extensions of the four P's are often included in cases such as services marketing where unique characteristics (i.e. intangibility, perishability, heterogeneity and the inseparability of production and consumption) warrant additional consideration factors. Other extensions have been found necessary for retail marketing, industrial marketing, and internet marketing\n\ninclude \"people\", \"process\", and \"physical evidence\" and are often applied in the case of [[services marketing]]<ref>Fisk, R.P., Brown, W., and Bitner, M.J., \"Tracking the Evolution of Services Marketing Literature, ''Journal of Retailing'', vol. 41 (April), 1993; Booms, B. and Bitner, M.J. \"Marketing Strategies and Organizational Structures for Service Firms\" in James H.

This aspect of the model focuses on fulfilling the wants or needs of the consumer. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Cost'''\n\nCost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. Cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. Cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Convenience'''\n\nLike \"Place\" in the 4Ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. This, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. The convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Communication'''\n\nLike \"Promotion\" in the 4Ps model, communication refers to how consumers find out about a product. Unlike, promotion, communication not only refers to the one-way communication of advertising, but also the two-way communication available through social media. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://catmediatheagency.com/4-ps-of-marketing-strategy/|title=Marketing Strategy: Forget the 4 P'S!

A firm's marketing environment consists of three main areas, which are:\n* The macro-environment, over which a firm holds little control\n* The micro-environment, over which a firm holds a greater amount (though not necessarily total) control\n* The internal environment, which includes the factors inside of the company itself<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://businessjargons.com/marketing-environment.html|title=What is Marketing Environment? definition and meaning \u2013 Business Jargons|date=2015-08-25|work=Business Jargons|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Macro===\n{{Main|Macromarketing}}\n\nA firm's marketing macro-environment consists of a variety of external factors that manifest on a large (or macro) scale. These include factors that are:\n\n* economic\n* social\n* political \n* technological \n\nA common method of assessing a firm's macro-environment is via a PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Ecological) analysis. Within a [[PESTLE analysis]], a firm would analyze national political issues, culture and climate, key [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] conditions, health and indicators (such as economic growth, [[inflation]], [[unemployment]], etc.), [[Social Trends|social trends]]/attitudes, and the nature of technology's impact on its society and the business processes within the society. <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Micro===\n\nA firm's micro-environment comprises factors pertinent to the firm itself, or stakeholders closely connected with the firm or company.\n\nA firm's micro-environment typically spans:\n* Customers/[[consumer]]s\n* [[Employees]]\n* [[Suppliers]]\n* The [[Media (communication)|Media]]\n\nIn contrast to the macro-environment, an organization holds a greater (though not complete) degree of control over these factors.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Internal ===\nA firms internal environment consists of factors inside of the actual company. These are factors controlled by the firm and they affect the relationship that a firm has with its customers. These include factors such as:\n* Labor\n* Inventory\n* Company Policy\n* Logistics\n* Budget\n* Capital Assets <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Research==\n\n{{main|Marketing research}}\n\nMarketing research is a systematic process of analyzing data that involves conducting research to support marketing activities and the statistical interpretation of data into information. This information is then used by managers to plan marketing activities, gauge the nature of a firm's marketing environment and to attain information from suppliers. A distinction should be made between '''''marketing''''' research and '''''market''''' research. Market research involves gathering information about a particular target market. As an example, a firm may conduct research in a target market, after selecting a suitable market segment. In contrast, marketing research relates to all research conducted within marketing. Market research is a subset of marketing research.\n\nMarketing researchers use statistical methods (such as [[quantitative research]], [[qualitative research]], [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis tests]], [[Chi-squared test|Chi-square tests]], [[linear regression]], [[correlation coefficient]]s, [[frequency distribution]]s, [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] and [[binomial distribution]]s, etc.) to interpret their findings and convert data into information.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/4-principles-of-marketing-as-a-science-156082|title=4 Principles Of Marketing As A Science|date=2013-04-18|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe stages of research include:\n* Define the problem\n*Plan research\n*Research\n*Interpret data\n*Implement findings <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-marketing-spring2016/chapter/reading-the-marketing-research-process/|title=The Marketing Research Process {{!}} Principles of Marketing|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref>\n\n==Segmentation==\n{{main|Market segmentation}}\nMarket segmentation consists of taking the total heterogeneous market for a product and dividing it into several sub-markets or segments, each of which tends to be homogeneous in all significant aspects.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of marketing|last=Stanton|first=William J|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The process is conducted for two main purposes: better allocation of a firm's finite resources and to better serve the more diversified tastes of contemporary consumers. A firm only possesses a certain amount of resources. Thus, it must make choices (and appreciate the related costs) in servicing specific groups of consumers. Moreover, with more diversity in the tastes of modern consumers, firms are noting the benefit of servicing a multiplicity of new markets.\n\nMarket segmentation can be defined in terms of the STP acronym, meaning Segment, Target, and Position.\n\n'''Segmentation''' involves the initial splitting up of consumers into persons of like needs/wants/tastes. Commonly used criteria include:\n* '''Geographic''' (such as a country, region, city, town)\n* '''Psychographic''' (e.g. personality traits or lifestyle traits which influence consumer behaviour)\n* '''Demographic''' (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic class, education)\n*'''Gender'''\n*'''Income''' \n*'''Life-Cycle''' (e.g. Baby Boomer, Generation X, Millennial, Generation Z)\n*'''Lifestyle''' (e.g. tech savvy, active)\n*'''Behavioural''' (e.g. brand loyalty, usage rate) <ref>{{Cite book|title=Marketing: the Basics|last=Moore|first=Karl|last2=Pareek|first2=Niketh|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=978-0-415-77899-2|location=New York, NY|pages=38\u201365}}</ref>\n\nOnce a segment has been identified to target, a firm must ascertain whether the segment is beneficial for them to service. The ''DAMP'' acronym is used as criteria to gauge the viability of a target market. The elements of DAMP are:\n* '''Discernable''' \u2013 how a segment can be differentiated from other segments.\n* '''Accessible''' \u2013 how a segment can be accessed via Marketing Communications produced by a firm\n* '''Measurable''' \u2013 can the segment be quantified and its size determined?\n* '''Profitable''' \u2013 can a sufficient return on investment be attained from a segment's servicing?\n\nThe next step in the targeting process is the level of [[differentiation (economics)|differentiation]] involved in a segment serving. Three modes of differentiation exist, which are commonly applied by firms. These are:\n* '''Undifferentiated''' \u2013 where a company produces a like product for all of a market segment\n* '''Differentiated''' \u2013 in which a firm produced slight modifications of a product within a segment\n* '''[[Niche market|Niche]]''' \u2013 in which an organization forges a product to satisfy a specialized target market\n\n''[[Positioning (marketing)|'''Positioning''']]'' concerns how to position a product in the minds of consumers and inform what attributes differentiate it from the competitor's products. A firm often performs this by producing a perceptual map, which denotes similar products produced in the same industry according to how consumers perceive their price and quality. From a product's placing on the map, a firm would tailor its marketing communications to meld with the product's perception among consumers and its position among competitors' offering. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management in Tourism|last=Moutinho|first=Luiz|publisher=CABI Publishing|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=121\u2013166}}</ref>\n\n==Promotional Mix==\n{{see also|Integrated marketing communications|3=Promotional mix}}\nThe promotional mix outlines how a company will market its product. It consists of five tools: personal selling, sales promotion, public relations, advertising and social media\n\n===Personal selling===\n{{main|Personal selling}}Personal selling involves an oral presentation given by a salesperson who approaches an individual or a group of potential customers. Personal selling allows for two-way communication and relationship building that can aid both the buyer and the seller in their goals. Personal selling is most commonly seen in business-to-business marketing (e.g.: selling machinery to a factory, selling paper to a print shop), but it can also be found in business-to-consumer marketing (e.g.: selling cars at a dealership). <ref name=\":0\" />[[File:ASC Leiden - W.E.A. van Beek Collection - Dogon markets 21 - Women selling their beer warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli, Mali 1989.jpg|thumb|Female beer sellers warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli market, Mali 1989]]\n===Sales promotion===\n{{Main|Sales promotion}}\nSales promotion involves short-term incentives to encourage the buying of products. Examples of these incentives include:\n\n* free samples\n* contests\n* premiums\n* trade shows\n* giveaways\n* coupons\n* sweepstakes\n* games\n\nDepending on the incentive, one or more of the other elements of the promotional mix may be used in conjunction with sales promotion to inform customers of the incentives. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Public relations===\n{{Main|Public relations}}\n[[Public relations]] is the use of media tools to promote a positive view of a company or product in the public's eye. Public relations monitors the public opinion of a company or product and generates publicity to either sustain a positive opinion or lessen or change a negative opinion.\n\nPublic relations can include interviews, speeches/presentations, corporate literature, social media, news releases and special events. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Advertising===\n{{main|advertising}}\n[[Advertising]] occurs when a firm directly pays a media channel to publicize its product. Common examples of advertising include:\n\n* TV commercials\n* Radio commercials\n* Radio ads\n* Magazine ads\n* Online ads\n* Billboards\n* Event sponsorship\n* Direct mail ads\n* Transit ads <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Social Media===\n{{main|Social media marketing}}\nSocial media is used to facilitate two-way communication between companies and their customers. Social media outlets such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[Pinterest]], [[Snapchat]] and [[YouTube]] allow brands to start a conversation with regular and prospective customers. Viral marketing can be greatly facilitated by social media and if successful, allows key marketing messages and content in reaching a large number of target audiences within a short time frame. Additionally, social media platforms can also house advertising and public relations content. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Principles of Marketing|last=Lamb|first=Charles|last2=Hair|first2=Joseph|last3=McDaniel|first3=Carl|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2016|isbn=978-1-285-86014-5|location=Boston, MA}}</ref>. \n\n==The Marketing Plan==\n{{main|Marketing plan}}\nThe area of marketing planning involves forging a plan for a firm's marketing activities. A marketing plan can also pertain to a specific product, as well as to an organization's overall marketing strategy. An organization's marketing planning process is derived from its overall business strategy. Thus, when top management are devising the firm's strategic direction/mission, the intended marketing activities are incorporated into this plan.\n\n===Process===\n\nWithin the overall strategic marketing plan, the stages of the process are listed as thus:\n* [[Mission statement|Mission Statement]]\n*[[SWOT analysis|SWOT]] (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) Analysis\n* Marketing Objectives\n* Targeted [[Marketing strategy|Marketing Strategy]]\n*Marketing Mix\n*Implementation <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Levels of marketing objectives within an organization===\n\nAs stated previously, the senior management of a firm would formulate a general business strategy for a firm. However, this general business strategy would be interpreted and implemented in different contexts throughout the firm.\n\nAt the corporate level, marketing objectives are typically broad-based in nature, and pertain to the general vision of the firm in the short, medium or long-term. As an example, if one pictures a group of companies (or a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]), top management may state that sales for the group should increase by 25% over a ten-year period.\n\nA '''[[strategic business unit]]''' (SBU) is a subsidiary within a firm, which participates within a given market/industry. The SBU would embrace the corporate strategy, and attune it to its own particular industry. For instance, an SBU may partake in the sports goods industry. It thus would ascertain how it would attain additional sales of sports goods, in order to satisfy the overall business strategy.\n\nThe '''functional''' level relates to departments within the SBUs, such as marketing, finance, HR, production, etc. The functional level would adopt the SBU's strategy and determine how to accomplish the SBU's own objectives in its market. To use the example of the sports goods industry again, the marketing department would draw up marketing plans, strategies and communications to help the SBU achieve its marketing aims.\n\n==Product life cycle==\n\n{{See|Product life-cycle management (marketing)}}\n[[File:Product life cycle.png|thumb|[[Product lifecycle]]]]\nThe [[product lifecycle|product life cycle]] (PLC) is a tool used by marketing managers to gauge the progress of a product, especially relating to sales or revenue accrued over time. The PLC is based on a few key assumptions, including:\n* A given product would possess introduction, growth, maturity, and decline stage\n* No product lasts perpetually on the market\n* A firm must employ differing strategies, according to where a product is on the PLC\n\nIn the '''introduction''' stage, a product is launched onto the market. To stimulate the growth of sales/revenue, use of advertising may be high, in order to heighten awareness of the product in question.\n\nDuring the '''growth''' stage, the product's sales/revenue is increasing, which may stimulate more marketing communications to sustain sales. More entrants enter into the market, to reap the apparent high profits that the industry is producing.\n\nWhen the product hits '''maturity''', its starts to level off, and an increasing number of entrants to a market produce price falls for the product. Firms may use sales promotions to raise sales.\n\nDuring '''decline''', demand for a good begins to taper off, and the firm may opt to discontinue the manufacture of the product. This is so, if revenue for the product comes from efficiency savings in production, over actual sales of a good/service. However, if a product services a niche market, or is complementary to another product, it may continue the manufacture of the product, despite a low level of sales/revenue being accrued. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{main|Outline of marketing}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Account-based marketing]]\n* [[Advertising]]\n** [[History of advertising]]\n** [[Sex in Advertising]]\n* [[Advertising management]]\n* [[Affinity marketing]]\n* [[American business history]]\n* [[Brand awareness]]\n* [[Consumer confusion]]\n* [[Consumer behaviour]]\n* [[Database marketing]]\n* [[Demand chain]]\n* [[Digital marketing]]\n* [[Email remarketing]]\n* [[Family in advertising]]\n* [[History of marketing]]\n* [[List of marketing terms]]\n* [[Loyalty marketing]]\n* [[Macromarketing]]\n* [[Marketing management]]\n* [[Marketing mix]]\n* [[Marketing science]]\n* [[Marketing strategy]]\n* [[Micromarketing]]\n* [[Media manipulation]]\n* [[Multicultural marketing]]\n* [[Product management]]\n* [[Product marketing]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[Public Sector Marketing]]\n* [[Real-time marketing]]\n* [[Return on marketing investment]] (ROMI)\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Smarketing]]\n* [[Societal marketing]]\n* [[Sustainable market orientation]]\n* [[Visual marketing]]\n}}\n\n===<!-- This section is ONLY for recognised branches of marketing -->Types of marketing===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Agricultural marketing]]\n* [[Business marketing]] and [[industrial marketing]]\n* [[Destination marketing]]\n* [[Global marketing]]\n* [[Influencer marketing]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Services marketing]]\n* [[Social marketing]]\n}}\n\n===Marketing orientations or philosophies===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[History of marketing#The marketing orientation|Marketing orientation]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[History of marketing#Selling orientation|Selling orientation]]\n* [[Socially responsible marketing]] and [[corporate social responsibility]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]] and [[customer relationship management]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Bartels, Robert, ''The History of Marketing Thought,\" Columbus, Ohio, Grid, (1976) 1988 [http://www.healthedpartners.org/ceu/hm/a02history_of_marketing_thought_by_bartels_hermans.pdf online]\n* {{cite book |last=Christensen |first=Clayton M. |authorlink=Clayton M.

The main differences in these markets are demand, purchasing volume, amount of customers, customer concentration, distribution, buying nature, buying influences, negotiations, reciprocity, leasing and promotional methods.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n*Demand: B2B demand is derived because businesses buy products based on how much demand there is for the final consumer product. Businesses buy products based on customers wants and needs. B2C demand is primary because customers buy products based on their own wants and needs.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Purchasing volume: Businesses buy products in large volumes to distribute to consumers. Consumers buy products in smaller volumes suitable for personal use.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Number of customers: There are relatively fewer businesses to market to than direct consumers.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Customer concentration: Businesses that specialize in a particular market tend to be geographically concentrated while customers that buy products from these businesses are not concentrated.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Distribution: B2B products pass directly from the producer of the product to the business while B2C products must additionally go through a wholesaler or retailer.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying nature: B2B purchasing is a formal process done by professional buyers and sellers, while B2C purchasing is informal.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Buying influences: B2B purchasing is influenced by multiple people in various departments such as quality control, accounting, and logistics while B2C marketing is only influenced by the person making the purchase and possibly a few others.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Negotiations: In B2B marketing, negotiating for lower prices or added benefits is commonly accepted while in B2C marketing (particularly in Western cultures) prices are fixed.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Reciprocity: Businesses tend to buy from businesses they sell to. For example, a business that sells printer ink is more likely to buy office chairs from a supplier that buys the business's printer ink. In B2C marketing, this does not occur because consumers are not also selling products.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Leasing: Businesses tend to lease expensive items while consumers tend to save up to buy expensive items.<ref name=\":0\" />\n*Promotional methods: In B2B marketing, the most common promotional method is personal selling.

A production orientation may be deployed when a high demand for a product or service exists, coupled with certainty that consumer tastes and preferences remain relatively constant (similar to the sales orientation). The so-called production era is thought to have dominated marketing practice from the 1860s to the 1930s, but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries. Specifically Kotler and Armstrong note that the production philosophy is \"one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers... [and] is still useful in some situations.\"<ref>Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., ''Principles of Marketing'', 12th ed., Upper Saddle River: Pearson Education, 2008, p. 28</ref> \n\n===Marketing===\n{{See|Market orientation}}\n\nThe marketing orientation is the most common orientation used in contemporary marketing. It is a customer-centric approach that involves a firm basing its marketing program around products that suit new consumer tastes. Firms adopting a marketing orientation typically engage in extensive market research to gauge consumer desires, use R&D (Research & Development) to develop a product attuned to the revealed information, and then utilize promotion techniques to ensure consumers are aware of the product's existence and the benefits it can deliver.<ref>McGee, L.W. and Spiro, R.L., \"The Marketing Concept in Perspective,\" ''Business Horizons, May\u2013June, 1988, pp. 40\u201345</ref> Scales designed to measure a firm's overall market orientation have been developed and found to be robust in a variety of contexts.<ref>Hooley, G., Fahy, J., Beracs, J., Fonfara, K. and Snoj, B., \"Market Orientation in the Transition Economies of Central Europe: Tests of the Narver and Slater Market Orientation Scales,\" ''Journal of Business Research,'' Vol. 50, 2000, pp. 273\u201385. Note that the most widely applied scale is that developed by Narver and Slater in Narver, J.C., and Slater, S.F., ''The Effect of Marketing Orientation on Business Profitability,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vo. 54, 1990, pp. 20\u201335</ref>\n\nThe marketing orientation has three prime facets, which are:\n: ''Customer orientation'': A firm in the [[market economy]] can survive by producing [[goods]] that people are willing and able to buy. Consequently, ascertaining [[consumer demand]] is vital for a [[business entity|firm]]'s future viability and even existence as a [[going concern]].\n: ''Organizational orientation'': The marketing department is of prime importance within the functional level of an organization. Information from the marketing department is used to guide the actions of a company's other departments. \n:As an example, a marketing department could ascertain (via marketing research) that consumers desired a new type of product, or a new usage for an existing product. With this in mind, the marketing department would inform the R&D department to create a prototype of a product/service based on consumers' new desires.\n:The production department would then start to manufacture the product, while the marketing department would focus on the promotion, distribution, pricing, etc. of the product. Additionally, a firm's finance department would be consulted, with respect to securing appropriate funding for the development, production and promotion of the product. Finance may oppose the required capital expenditure, since it could undermine a healthy cash flow for the organization.\n:'' Mutually beneficial exchange'': In a transaction in the market economy, a firm gains revenue, which thus leads to more profits, market shares, or sales. A consumer on the other hand gains the satisfaction of a need/want, utility, reliability and value for money from the purchase of a product or service.\n\n===Societal marketing===\n{{main|Societal marketing}}\n\nA number of scholars and practitioners have argued that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior [[Value (marketing)|value]]. Marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups such as employees, customers, and local communities.Companies that adopt a societal marketing perspective typically practice [[triple bottom line]] reporting whereby they publish social impact and environmental impact reports alongside financial performance reports. Sustainable marketing or [[green marketing]] is an extension of societal marketing.<ref>Blackwell Reference, [https://www.econbiz.de/Record/what-consumerism-means-for-marketers-kotler-philip/10002240532 Kotler, P., \"What consumerism means for marketers\"], ''Harvard Business Review,'' vol. 50, no. 3, 1972, pp. 48\u201357; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Macromarketing as a Pillar of Marketing Thought,\" ''Journal of Macromarketing,'' Vol. 26 No. 2, December 2006, pp. 224\u201332 {{doi|10.1177/0276146706291067}}; Wilkie, W.L. and Moore, E.S., \"Scholarly Research in Marketing: Exploring the \"4 Eras\" of Thought Development,\" ''Journal of Public Policy and Marketing,'' Vol. 22, No. 2, 2003, pp. 116\u201346</ref>\n\n==The Marketing Mix==\n{{Main|Marketing mix}}\nThe marketing mix is a foundational tool used to guide decision making in marketing. The marketing mix represents the basic tools which marketers can use to bring their products or services to market. They are the foundation of managerial marketing and the [[marketing plan]] typically devotes a section to the marketing mix.\n\n===The 4Ps ===\n\nThe traditional marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision, namely: ''product'', ''price'', ''promotion'', and ''place''.<ref name=\":6\">{{cite book|last=McCarthy|first=Jerome E.|title=Basic Marketing.

The product element consists of product design, new product innovation, branding, packaging, labeling. The scope of a product generally includes supporting elements such as warranties, guarantees, and support. [[Brand]]ing, a key aspect of the product management, refers to the various methods of communicating a brand identity for the product, [[brand]], or company. <ref name=\":1\" />\n;[[Pricing]]:This refers to the process of setting a [[price]] for a product, including discounts. The price need not be monetary; it can simply be what is exchanged for the product or services, e.g. time, energy, or attention or any sacrifices consumers make in order to acquire a product or service. The price is the cost that a consumer pays for a product\u2014monetary or not. Methods of setting prices are in the domain of [[pricing science]]. <ref name=\":2\" />\n; Place (or [[distribution (business)|distribution]]):This refers to how the product gets to the customer; the distribution channels and intermediaries such as wholesalers and [[retailer]]s who enable customers to access products or services in a convenient manner. This third P has also sometimes been called ''Place'' or ''Placement'', referring to the channel by which a product or service is sold (e.g. online vs. retail), which geographic region or industry, to which segment (young adults, families, business people), etc. also referring to how the environment in which the product is sold in can affect sales. <ref name=\":2\" />\n;[[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion]]:This includes all aspects of marketing communications; [[advertising]], [[sales promotion]], including [[promotional education]], [[public relations]], [[sales|personal selling]], [[product placement]], [[branded entertainment]], event marketing, trade shows and [[exhibitions]]. This fourth P is focused on providing a message to get a response from consumers.  The message is designed to persuade or tell a story to create awareness.<ref name=\":2\">Borden, N., \"The Concept of the Marketing Mix,\" ''Journal of Advertising Research,'' June 1964 pp. 2\u20137; van Waterschoot, W. and van den Bulte, C., \"The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited,\" ''Journal of Marketing,'' Vol. 56, No. 4, 1992, pp. 83\u201393</ref>\n\n==== Criticisms ====\nOne of the limitations of the 4Ps approach is its emphasis of an inside out-view. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Riding the Waves of Change|last=Gareth|first=Morgan|publisher=Jossey-Bass|year=1988|isbn=978-1555420932|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ridingwavesofcha00morg}}</ref> An ''inside-out'' approach is the traditional planning approach where the organisation identifies its desired goals and objectives, which are often based around what has always been done. Marketing's task then becomes one of \"selling\" the organisation's products and messages to the \"outside\" or external stakeholders.<ref name=\":1\">Kerr, F., Patti, C. and Ichul, K., \"An Inside-out Approach to Integrated Marketing Communications: An International Perspective,\" ''International Journal of Advertising,'' Vol. 27, No. 4, 2008, pp. 531\u201340</ref> In contrast, an ''outside-in'' approach first seeks to understand the needs and wants of the consumer.<ref>Porcu, L., del Barrio-Garcia, S., and Kitchen, P.J., \"How Integrated Marketing Communications (IMC) works?

Well-designed models should exhibit clearly defined categories that are mutually exclusive, with no overlap. Yet, the 4 Ps model has extensive overlapping problems. Several authors stress the hybrid nature of the fourth P, mentioning the presence of two important dimensions, \"communication\" (general and informative communications such as public relations and corporate communications) and \"promotion\" (persuasive communications such as advertising and direct selling). Certain marketing activities, such as personal selling, may be classified as either ''promotion'' or as part of the place (i.e., distribution) element.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = van Waterschoot | first1 = W. | last2 = van den Bulte | first2 = C. | year = | title = The 4P Classification of the Marketing Mix Revisited | url = | journal = Journal of Marketing | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 83\u201393 | doi = 10.2307/1251988 }}</ref> Some pricing tactics, such as promotional pricing, can be classified as price variables or promotional variables and, therefore, also exhibit some overlap.\n\nOther important criticisms include that the marketing mix lacks a strategic framework and is, therefore, unfit to be a planning instrument, particularly when uncontrollable, external elements are an important aspect of the marketing environment.<ref>Constantinides, E., \"The Marketing Mix Revisited: Towards the 21st Century Marketing,\" ''Journal of Marketing Management,'' Vo. 22, 2006, pp. 407\u201338</ref>\n\n====Modifications and extensions====\n\nTo overcome the deficiencies of the 4P model, some authors have suggested extensions or modifications to the original model. Extensions of the four P's are often included in cases such as services marketing where unique characteristics (i.e. intangibility, perishability, heterogeneity and the inseparability of production and consumption) warrant additional consideration factors. Other extensions have been found necessary for retail marketing, industrial marketing, and internet marketing\n\ninclude \"people\", \"process\", and \"physical evidence\" and are often applied in the case of [[services marketing]]<ref>Fisk, R.P., Brown, W., and Bitner, M.J., \"Tracking the Evolution of Services Marketing Literature, ''Journal of Retailing'', vol. 41 (April), 1993; Booms, B. and Bitner, M.J. \"Marketing Strategies and Organizational Structures for Service Firms\" in James H.

This aspect of the model focuses on fulfilling the wants or needs of the consumer. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Cost'''\n\nCost refers to what is exchanged in return for the product. Cost mainly consists of the monetary value of the product. Cost also refers to anything else the consumer must sacrifice to attain the product, such as time or money spent on transportation to acquire the product. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Convenience'''\n\nLike \"Place\" in the 4Ps model, convenience refers to where the product will be sold. This, however, not only refers to physical stores but also whether the product is available in person or online. The convenience aspect emphasizes making it as easy as possible for the consumer to attain the product, thus making them more likely to do so. <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n'''Communication'''\n\nLike \"Promotion\" in the 4Ps model, communication refers to how consumers find out about a product. Unlike, promotion, communication not only refers to the one-way communication of advertising, but also the two-way communication available through social media. <ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://catmediatheagency.com/4-ps-of-marketing-strategy/|title=Marketing Strategy: Forget the 4 P'S!

A firm's marketing environment consists of three main areas, which are:\n* The macro-environment, over which a firm holds little control\n* The micro-environment, over which a firm holds a greater amount (though not necessarily total) control\n* The internal environment, which includes the factors inside of the company itself<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite news|url=http://businessjargons.com/marketing-environment.html|title=What is Marketing Environment? definition and meaning \u2013 Business Jargons|date=2015-08-25|work=Business Jargons|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n===Macro===\n{{Main|Macromarketing}}\n\nA firm's marketing macro-environment consists of a variety of external factors that manifest on a large (or macro) scale. These include factors that are:\n\n* economic\n* social\n* political \n* technological \n\nA common method of assessing a firm's macro-environment is via a PESTLE (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Legal, Ecological) analysis. Within a [[PESTLE analysis]], a firm would analyze national political issues, culture and climate, key [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] conditions, health and indicators (such as economic growth, [[inflation]], [[unemployment]], etc.), [[Social Trends|social trends]]/attitudes, and the nature of technology's impact on its society and the business processes within the society. <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n===Micro===\n\nA firm's micro-environment comprises factors pertinent to the firm itself, or stakeholders closely connected with the firm or company.\n\nA firm's micro-environment typically spans:\n* Customers/[[consumer]]s\n* [[Employees]]\n* [[Suppliers]]\n* The [[Media (communication)|Media]]\n\nIn contrast to the macro-environment, an organization holds a greater (though not complete) degree of control over these factors.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\n=== Internal ===\nA firms internal environment consists of factors inside of the actual company. These are factors controlled by the firm and they affect the relationship that a firm has with its customers. These include factors such as:\n* Labor\n* Inventory\n* Company Policy\n* Logistics\n* Budget\n* Capital Assets <ref name=\":4\" />\n\n==Research==\n\n{{main|Marketing research}}\n\nMarketing research is a systematic process of analyzing data that involves conducting research to support marketing activities and the statistical interpretation of data into information. This information is then used by managers to plan marketing activities, gauge the nature of a firm's marketing environment and to attain information from suppliers. A distinction should be made between '''''marketing''''' research and '''''market''''' research. Market research involves gathering information about a particular target market. As an example, a firm may conduct research in a target market, after selecting a suitable market segment. In contrast, marketing research relates to all research conducted within marketing. Market research is a subset of marketing research.\n\nMarketing researchers use statistical methods (such as [[quantitative research]], [[qualitative research]], [[Statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis tests]], [[Chi-squared test|Chi-square tests]], [[linear regression]], [[correlation coefficient]]s, [[frequency distribution]]s, [[Poisson distribution|Poisson]] and [[binomial distribution]]s, etc.) to interpret their findings and convert data into information.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://searchengineland.com/4-principles-of-marketing-as-a-science-156082|title=4 Principles Of Marketing As A Science|date=2013-04-18|work=Search Engine Land|access-date=2017-06-16|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nThe stages of research include:\n* Define the problem\n*Plan research\n*Research\n*Interpret data\n*Implement findings <ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-marketing-spring2016/chapter/reading-the-marketing-research-process/|title=The Marketing Research Process {{!}} Principles of Marketing|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-11-15}}</ref>\n\n==Segmentation==\n{{main|Market segmentation}}\nMarket segmentation consists of taking the total heterogeneous market for a product and dividing it into several sub-markets or segments, each of which tends to be homogeneous in all significant aspects.<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of marketing|last=Stanton|first=William J|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1984|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The process is conducted for two main purposes: better allocation of a firm's finite resources and to better serve the more diversified tastes of contemporary consumers. A firm only possesses a certain amount of resources. Thus, it must make choices (and appreciate the related costs) in servicing specific groups of consumers. Moreover, with more diversity in the tastes of modern consumers, firms are noting the benefit of servicing a multiplicity of new markets.\n\nMarket segmentation can be defined in terms of the STP acronym, meaning Segment, Target, and Position.\n\n'''Segmentation''' involves the initial splitting up of consumers into persons of like needs/wants/tastes. Commonly used criteria include:\n* '''Geographic''' (such as a country, region, city, town)\n* '''Psychographic''' (e.g. personality traits or lifestyle traits which influence consumer behaviour)\n* '''Demographic''' (e.g. age, gender, socio-economic class, education)\n*'''Gender'''\n*'''Income''' \n*'''Life-Cycle''' (e.g. Baby Boomer, Generation X, Millennial, Generation Z)\n*'''Lifestyle''' (e.g. tech savvy, active)\n*'''Behavioural''' (e.g. brand loyalty, usage rate) <ref>{{Cite book|title=Marketing: the Basics|last=Moore|first=Karl|last2=Pareek|first2=Niketh|publisher=Routledge|year=2010|isbn=978-0-415-77899-2|location=New York, NY|pages=38\u201365}}</ref>\n\nOnce a segment has been identified to target, a firm must ascertain whether the segment is beneficial for them to service. The ''DAMP'' acronym is used as criteria to gauge the viability of a target market. The elements of DAMP are:\n* '''Discernable''' \u2013 how a segment can be differentiated from other segments.\n* '''Accessible''' \u2013 how a segment can be accessed via Marketing Communications produced by a firm\n* '''Measurable''' \u2013 can the segment be quantified and its size determined?\n* '''Profitable''' \u2013 can a sufficient return on investment be attained from a segment's servicing?\n\nThe next step in the targeting process is the level of [[differentiation (economics)|differentiation]] involved in a segment serving. Three modes of differentiation exist, which are commonly applied by firms. These are:\n* '''Undifferentiated''' \u2013 where a company produces a like product for all of a market segment\n* '''Differentiated''' \u2013 in which a firm produced slight modifications of a product within a segment\n* '''[[Niche market|Niche]]''' \u2013 in which an organization forges a product to satisfy a specialized target market\n\n''[[Positioning (marketing)|'''Positioning''']]'' concerns how to position a product in the minds of consumers and inform what attributes differentiate it from the competitor's products. A firm often performs this by producing a perceptual map, which denotes similar products produced in the same industry according to how consumers perceive their price and quality. From a product's placing on the map, a firm would tailor its marketing communications to meld with the product's perception among consumers and its position among competitors' offering. <ref>{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management in Tourism|last=Moutinho|first=Luiz|publisher=CABI Publishing|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=121\u2013166}}</ref>\n\n==Promotional Mix==\n{{see also|Integrated marketing communications|3=Promotional mix}}\nThe promotional mix outlines how a company will market its product. It consists of five tools: personal selling, sales promotion, public relations, advertising and social media\n\n===Personal selling===\n{{main|Personal selling}}Personal selling involves an oral presentation given by a salesperson who approaches an individual or a group of potential customers. Personal selling allows for two-way communication and relationship building that can aid both the buyer and the seller in their goals. Personal selling is most commonly seen in business-to-business marketing (e.g.: selling machinery to a factory, selling paper to a print shop), but it can also be found in business-to-consumer marketing (e.g.: selling cars at a dealership). <ref name=\":0\" />[[File:ASC Leiden - W.E.A. van Beek Collection - Dogon markets 21 - Women selling their beer warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli, Mali 1989.jpg|thumb|Female beer sellers warn the photographer that he also has to buy some, Tireli market, Mali 1989]]\n===Sales promotion===\n{{Main|Sales promotion}}\nSales promotion involves short-term incentives to encourage the buying of products. Examples of these incentives include:\n\n* free samples\n* contests\n* premiums\n* trade shows\n* giveaways\n* coupons\n* sweepstakes\n* games\n\nDepending on the incentive, one or more of the other elements of the promotional mix may be used in conjunction with sales promotion to inform customers of the incentives. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Public relations===\n{{Main|Public relations}}\n[[Public relations]] is the use of media tools to promote a positive view of a company or product in the public's eye. Public relations monitors the public opinion of a company or product and generates publicity to either sustain a positive opinion or lessen or change a negative opinion.\n\nPublic relations can include interviews, speeches/presentations, corporate literature, social media, news releases and special events. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Advertising===\n{{main|advertising}}\n[[Advertising]] occurs when a firm directly pays a media channel to publicize its product. Common examples of advertising include:\n\n* TV commercials\n* Radio commercials\n* Radio ads\n* Magazine ads\n* Online ads\n* Billboards\n* Event sponsorship\n* Direct mail ads\n* Transit ads <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Social Media===\n{{main|Social media marketing}}\nSocial media is used to facilitate two-way communication between companies and their customers. Social media outlets such as [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], [[Tumblr]], [[Pinterest]], [[Snapchat]] and [[YouTube]] allow brands to start a conversation with regular and prospective customers. Viral marketing can be greatly facilitated by social media and if successful, allows key marketing messages and content in reaching a large number of target audiences within a short time frame. Additionally, social media platforms can also house advertising and public relations content. <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Principles of Marketing|last=Lamb|first=Charles|last2=Hair|first2=Joseph|last3=McDaniel|first3=Carl|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2016|isbn=978-1-285-86014-5|location=Boston, MA}}</ref>. \n\n==The Marketing Plan==\n{{main|Marketing plan}}\nThe area of marketing planning involves forging a plan for a firm's marketing activities. A marketing plan can also pertain to a specific product, as well as to an organization's overall marketing strategy. An organization's marketing planning process is derived from its overall business strategy. Thus, when top management are devising the firm's strategic direction/mission, the intended marketing activities are incorporated into this plan.\n\n===Process===\n\nWithin the overall strategic marketing plan, the stages of the process are listed as thus:\n* [[Mission statement|Mission Statement]]\n*[[SWOT analysis|SWOT]] (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) Analysis\n* Marketing Objectives\n* Targeted [[Marketing strategy|Marketing Strategy]]\n*Marketing Mix\n*Implementation <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Levels of marketing objectives within an organization===\n\nAs stated previously, the senior management of a firm would formulate a general business strategy for a firm. However, this general business strategy would be interpreted and implemented in different contexts throughout the firm.\n\nAt the corporate level, marketing objectives are typically broad-based in nature, and pertain to the general vision of the firm in the short, medium or long-term. As an example, if one pictures a group of companies (or a [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]), top management may state that sales for the group should increase by 25% over a ten-year period.\n\nA '''[[strategic business unit]]''' (SBU) is a subsidiary within a firm, which participates within a given market/industry. The SBU would embrace the corporate strategy, and attune it to its own particular industry. For instance, an SBU may partake in the sports goods industry. It thus would ascertain how it would attain additional sales of sports goods, in order to satisfy the overall business strategy.\n\nThe '''functional''' level relates to departments within the SBUs, such as marketing, finance, HR, production, etc. The functional level would adopt the SBU's strategy and determine how to accomplish the SBU's own objectives in its market. To use the example of the sports goods industry again, the marketing department would draw up marketing plans, strategies and communications to help the SBU achieve its marketing aims.\n\n==Product life cycle==\n\n{{See|Product life-cycle management (marketing)}}\n[[File:Product life cycle.png|thumb|[[Product lifecycle]]]]\nThe [[product lifecycle|product life cycle]] (PLC) is a tool used by marketing managers to gauge the progress of a product, especially relating to sales or revenue accrued over time. The PLC is based on a few key assumptions, including:\n* A given product would possess introduction, growth, maturity, and decline stage\n* No product lasts perpetually on the market\n* A firm must employ differing strategies, according to where a product is on the PLC\n\nIn the '''introduction''' stage, a product is launched onto the market. To stimulate the growth of sales/revenue, use of advertising may be high, in order to heighten awareness of the product in question.\n\nDuring the '''growth''' stage, the product's sales/revenue is increasing, which may stimulate more marketing communications to sustain sales. More entrants enter into the market, to reap the apparent high profits that the industry is producing.\n\nWhen the product hits '''maturity''', its starts to level off, and an increasing number of entrants to a market produce price falls for the product. Firms may use sales promotions to raise sales.\n\nDuring '''decline''', demand for a good begins to taper off, and the firm may opt to discontinue the manufacture of the product. This is so, if revenue for the product comes from efficiency savings in production, over actual sales of a good/service. However, if a product services a niche market, or is complementary to another product, it may continue the manufacture of the product, despite a low level of sales/revenue being accrued. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{main|Outline of marketing}}\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Account-based marketing]]\n* [[Advertising]]\n** [[History of advertising]]\n** [[Sex in Advertising]]\n* [[Advertising management]]\n* [[Affinity marketing]]\n* [[American business history]]\n* [[Brand awareness]]\n* [[Consumer confusion]]\n* [[Consumer behaviour]]\n* [[Database marketing]]\n* [[Demand chain]]\n* [[Digital marketing]]\n* [[Email remarketing]]\n* [[Family in advertising]]\n* [[History of marketing]]\n* [[List of marketing terms]]\n* [[Loyalty marketing]]\n* [[Macromarketing]]\n* [[Marketing management]]\n* [[Marketing mix]]\n* [[Marketing science]]\n* [[Marketing strategy]]\n* [[Micromarketing]]\n* [[Media manipulation]]\n* [[Multicultural marketing]]\n* [[Product management]]\n* [[Product marketing]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[Public Sector Marketing]]\n* [[Real-time marketing]]\n* [[Return on marketing investment]] (ROMI)\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Smarketing]]\n* [[Societal marketing]]\n* [[Sustainable market orientation]]\n* [[Visual marketing]]\n}}\n\n===<!-- This section is ONLY for recognised branches of marketing -->Types of marketing===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[Agricultural marketing]]\n* [[Business marketing]] and [[industrial marketing]]\n* [[Destination marketing]]\n* [[Global marketing]]\n* [[Influencer marketing]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]]\n* [[Services marketing]]\n* [[Social marketing]]\n}}\n\n===Marketing orientations or philosophies===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=15em|\n* [[History of marketing#The marketing orientation|Marketing orientation]]\n* [[Production orientation]]\n* [[History of marketing#Selling orientation|Selling orientation]]\n* [[Socially responsible marketing]] and [[corporate social responsibility]]\n* [[Relationship marketing]] and [[customer relationship management]]\n}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Bartels, Robert, ''The History of Marketing Thought,\" Columbus, Ohio, Grid, (1976) 1988 [http://www.healthedpartners.org/ceu/hm/a02history_of_marketing_thought_by_bartels_hermans.pdf online]\n* {{cite book |last=Christensen |first=Clayton M. |authorlink=Clayton M.

Cave eorum zizania, non appropinquens fidelibus, non serpant adulterina femina. Advertant quid propter suam perfidiam accident sibi, quiescant, aut veram fidem sequantur.''</ref>\n\nIn 435 Emperor [[Valentinian III]] built the church of S. Maria in Arenula. The bishop then was Cornelius, whose [[archdeacon]] Peter was appointed [[Bishop of Ravenna]] by [[Pope Sixtus III]]. Bishop [[Peter Chrysologus|Peter, known as Chrysologus]], gave a magnificent eulogy of Bishop Cornelius at the consecration of his successor, Projectus.<ref>Chrysologus himself was buried at Imola, having died in his native city. His tombstone, discovered in 1698, was a rude block on which was written PETRUS. Of the gifts said to have been given by Chrysologus to the church of Imola there is still preserved a [[paten]], with the figure of a lamb on an altar, surrounded by the metrical legend ''Quem plebs tunc cara crucis agnum fixit in ara. Hostia fit gentis primi pro labe parentis''. These [[leonine verse]]s, however, indicate a much more recent date, and refute the pious tale of the donation.</ref>\n\nIn 888, Pope Stephen V ordered the Archbishop of Ravenna to see to it that a bishop was canonically elected for Imola. There was to be no election while the incumbent was still alive, even though he might be ill. When there was a legitimate vacancy, the Clergy was to carry out the election, and the People were to approve it. There had earlier been strife in the city when the People attempted to elect a bishop without reference to the Clergy. It was only later that the Cathedral Chapter began to exercise the rights which had once belonged to the entire Clergy.<ref>Zaccaria, I, p. 105. Kehr, p. 163.</ref> By the year 1217, the right to elect the bishop belonged to the Canons of the Cathedral of S. Cassiano and the Canons of San Lorenzo, acting as a single electoral college.<ref>Zaccaria, p. 105.</ref>\n\nOn 7 August 1118, [[Pope Gelasius II]] restored to the Archbishop of Ravenna all of the dioceses which had been removed from his metropolitanate by [[Pope Paschal II]], due to the participation of the archbishops in the schism that supported the Emperor Henry IV. One of the dioceses that was restored to Ravenna was the diocese of Imola.<ref>P. Jaff\u00e9 and S. Loewenfeld, ''Regesta pontificum romanorum'' I, second edition (Leipzig 1885), p. 777, no. 6647.

Bonaparte, a claim to having routed Austrian forces. The claim was actually established after he won the [[Siege of Mantua (1796\u201397)|Battle of Mantua]], the [[Battle of Arcole|battle at the Arcola]], and the [[Battle of Rivoli]]. On 27 June an armistice was arranged between Napoleon and the papal armies of [[Pope Pius VI]], in which the Pope lost control of the March of Ferrara and Bologna. On 1 February 1797 the city of Imola was occupied by the French. The Bishop of Imola, Cardinal Chiaramonti, was ordered by the Pope not to fall into the hands of the French, and therefore he fled from Imola to Cesena, intending to head for Rome. At Spoleto, however, he received a plea from the French magistrates and Bonapartists in Imola to return, but after writing to the Pope, who pointed out that Chiaramonti had no way of controlling them, he continued on his journey to Rome. In fear of being supplanted on his episcopal throne by some French-sponsored intruder, he obtained papal permission to return.<ref>Zaccaria, pp. 235-236.</ref>\n\nOn 17 February 1797, Napoleon and papal representatives signed the [[Treaty of Tolentino]], in which the Pope surrendered Avignon, the Comtat Venaissin, and the Romagna. Imola was incorporated into the short lived [[Cispadane Republic]] (16 October 1796 \u2013 9 July 1797). On 18 October 1797 Bonaparte entered into the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] with the Austrians, promising them in secret clauses the Republic of Venice; he was able to withdraw to Paris, and then set off on his eastern expedition. In his Christmas message of 1797, therefore, Cardinal Chiaramonti faced impossible difficulties in attempting to calm the Imolese and to suggest a way through the political situation. He wrote.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexis Francois Artaud de Montor|title=The Lives and Times of the Popes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNquhfZ5kNwC&pg=PA10|edition=second|volume=Volume 9|year=1911|publisher=Catholic Publication Society of America|location=New York|page=10}} {{cite book|author=Gregorio Barnaba Chiaramonti|title=Omelia del cardinale Chiaramonti (Pio 7.) detta al popolo d'Imola nel Natale dell'anno 1797|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0c09dPjjL2EC&pg=PA7|year=1859|publisher=F.

The Conclave to elect his successor took some time to find a secure place to hold its meetings. The pope and cardinals had been expelled from Rome in 1798, and there were few places where the cardinals could assemble without fear of French interference. They chose Venice, which was under the \"protection\" of the Austrians. [[Papal conclave, 1799\u20131800|The Conclave]] opened on 30 November 1799, and on 14 March 1800 Cardinal Chiaramonti, Bishop of Imola, was elected pope. He chose the name Pius VII. He did not, however, relinquish the diocese of Imola, retaining it until his return from his imprisonment in France (1808\u20131814) by the Emperor Napoleon.

The dignities were: the Provost, the Archdeacon, the Archpriest, the Dean, the Primicerius, the Thesaurius, and the Custos. There were eleven Canons, each with a prebend.<ref>Ughelli, ''Italia sacra'' II, p. 622. The number was fixed by Bishop Mainardinus Aldigieri in 1230: ''esse debeat numerus undecim Canonicorum tantum sine preposito.'' Zaccaria, I, pp. 116-117.</ref> In 1751, there were eight dignities and twelve Canons.<ref>Ritzler-Sefrin, ''Hierarchia catholica'' VI, p. 243 note 1.</ref>\n\nThe bishops of Imola enjoyed the right to appoint, confirm, enthrone, and invest the Canons of the Cathedral Chapter, the Provosts, and the other prelates. The Bishop and Canons together elected the Sacristan, but the bishop alone confirms and invests.<ref>Zaccaria, II, pp. 70-71 (document from the last decade of the 12th century).</ref>\n\nThe Provost and Canons are mentioned as parties to a lawsuit in a mandate of Pope Urban III (1185\u20131187).<ref>Kehr, p. 165 no. 2. Zaccaria, I, p. 116, gives the wrong date of 1124, by confusing Pope Celestine III with Pope Celestine II.</ref> In 1511, Pope Julius II secularized the Provostship, and reserved the appointment to the Holy See. His first appointment was Giovanni Battista Vulpi, a Protonotary Apostolic and brother of the soldier Taddeo Vulpi. The dignity of Primicerius was created in 1504 by Bishop Simone Bonadies (1488\u20131511). The dignity of Treasurer was created in 1513, and was under the patronage of the Saxatelli family, and then the Machirelli. The dignity of Custos was instituted in 1526.<ref>Zaccaria, I, pp. 119-120.</ref> It was Bishop Alessandro Musotti (1579\u20131607) who instituted the Canon Penitentiarius and the Canon Theologus out of the eleven Canons, in accordance with the decree of the [[Council of Trent]].<ref>Zaccaria, I, p. 120.</ref>\n\nIn the 12th century, the Canons lived in Castro S. Cassiani, in a building called the ''Canonica'', which was near enough to the Episcopal Palace that the bishop could observe visually the comings and goings of the Canons. Not all of the Canons resided in the ''Canonica'', however; some are recorded from time to time as living in the Guest House (''Xenodochium'') of the Monastery of S. Vitale, which belonged to the Canons. In the second half of the 12th century, under Bishops Rodulphus (1147\u20131168), Arardus, and Henricus (1173\u20131193), when the Castro S. Cassiani was in ruins, they moved to the village of Duccia.<ref>There was a castle (''castrum'') in Duccia, and a church dedicated to S. Maria de Castro. Zaccaria, I, p. 129.</ref> Then Bishop Henricus built them a new house in Imola itself, to which the Canons moved in 1188.<ref>Zaccaria, I, pp. 121-122. Sometimes a Canon was Abbot of the monastery of S. Vitale.</ref>\n\nAfter his return to Rome from a year-long visit to Imola (having been driven out of his native Florence), Cardinal Niccol\u00f2 Ridolfi, the Apostolic Administrator of Imola (1533\u20131546), sent the diocese a set of Constitutions for the Canons of the Cathedral.<ref>Alberghetti, Parte seconda, p. 153.</ref>\n\nThe city of Imola also had a Collegiate church, San Lorenzo, which was of such ancient foundation that the original church collapsed in 967, and had to be rebuilt. The Chapter was presided over by an Archpriest, and included a number of Canons. In 1313 the financial situation of the church had so diminished due to wars and both internal and external strife that the full complement of Canons could not be maintained. Bishop Matteo Orsini, O.P. (1302\u20131317) therefore ordered that the church should be governed by the Archpriest, and by four Canons in priestly orders.<ref>Kehr, p. 167. Zaccaria, I, pp. 175-182.</ref>\n\n===Synods===\n\nA diocesan synod was an irregular but important meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See.<ref name=\"XIV1842\">{{cite book|author=Benedictus XIV|title=Benedicti XIV ...

He was appointed Bishop of Imola by [[Pope Paul V]] in the Consistory of 7 February 1607, and allowed to keep the title of Archbishop. In 1608 he was sent as papal Nuncio to reconcile the Emperor and his brother Matthias. In 1610 he was appointed papal Vicar General for the City of Rome. The Cardinal resigned the diocese of Imola on 17 June 1611, reserving for himself all of the episcopal income except 1,000 scudi, and retaining complete control over several castles in the diocese. He died in Rome on 2 October 1629. Manzoni, pp. 351-354. Zaccaria II, pp. 192-195.

He was appointed Bishop of Imola by [[Pope Clement X]] on 12 September 1672, and was consecrated on 18 September. On entering his diocese, his priority was the recovery of all the rights and privileges which belonged to the Church and Bishop of Imola, which led to a long and acrimonious legal suit with the Consuls of the city of Imola. In 1673, then, he conducted a Visitation of the diocese, strictly correcting all irregularities, in a fashion which repeatedly caused serious offense. When he went to Rome for the Jubilee of 1675, he was denounced to the Pope, and was kept in Rome for some years during the inquiry. On his return he turned his attention to redocorating the Cathedral. Cappelletti, p. 230. Zaccaria, pp. 210-212.

The bishop then was Cornelius, whose [[archdeacon]] Peter was appointed [[Bishop of Ravenna]] by [[Pope Sixtus III]]. Bishop [[Peter Chrysologus|Peter, known as Chrysologus]], gave a magnificent eulogy of Bishop Cornelius at the consecration of his successor, Projectus.<ref>Chrysologus himself was buried at Imola, having died in his native city. His tombstone, discovered in 1698, was a rude block on which was written PETRUS. Of the gifts said to have been given by Chrysologus to the church of Imola there is still preserved a [[paten]], with the figure of a lamb on an altar, surrounded by the metrical legend ''Quem plebs tunc cara crucis agnum fixit in ara. Hostia fit gentis primi pro labe parentis''. These [[leonine verse]]s, however, indicate a much more recent date, and refute the pious tale of the donation.</ref>\n\nIn 888, Pope Stephen V ordered the Archbishop of Ravenna to see to it that a bishop was canonically elected for Imola. There was to be no election while the incumbent was still alive, even though he might be ill. When there was a legitimate vacancy, the Clergy was to carry out the election, and the People were to approve it. There had earlier been strife in the city when the People attempted to elect a bishop without reference to the Clergy. It was only later that the Cathedral Chapter began to exercise the rights which had once belonged to the entire Clergy.<ref>Zaccaria, I, p. 105. Kehr, p. 163.</ref> By the year 1217, the right to elect the bishop belonged to the Canons of the Cathedral of S. Cassiano and the Canons of San Lorenzo, acting as a single electoral college.<ref>Zaccaria, p. 105.</ref>\n\nOn 7 August 1118, [[Pope Gelasius II]] restored to the Archbishop of Ravenna all of the dioceses which had been removed from his metropolitanate by [[Pope Paschal II]], due to the participation of the archbishops in the schism that supported the Emperor Henry IV. One of the dioceses that was restored to Ravenna was the diocese of Imola.<ref>P. Jaff\u00e9 and S. Loewenfeld, ''Regesta pontificum romanorum'' I, second edition (Leipzig 1885), p. 777, no. 6647.

Bonaparte, a claim to having routed Austrian forces. The claim was actually established after he won the [[Siege of Mantua (1796\u201397)|Battle of Mantua]], the [[Battle of Arcole|battle at the Arcola]], and the [[Battle of Rivoli]]. On 27 June an armistice was arranged between Napoleon and the papal armies of [[Pope Pius VI]], in which the Pope lost control of the March of Ferrara and Bologna. On 1 February 1797 the city of Imola was occupied by the French. The Bishop of Imola, Cardinal Chiaramonti, was ordered by the Pope not to fall into the hands of the French, and therefore he fled from Imola to Cesena, intending to head for Rome. At Spoleto, however, he received a plea from the French magistrates and Bonapartists in Imola to return, but after writing to the Pope, who pointed out that Chiaramonti had no way of controlling them, he continued on his journey to Rome. In fear of being supplanted on his episcopal throne by some French-sponsored intruder, he obtained papal permission to return.<ref>Zaccaria, pp. 235-236.</ref>\n\nOn 17 February 1797, Napoleon and papal representatives signed the [[Treaty of Tolentino]], in which the Pope surrendered Avignon, the Comtat Venaissin, and the Romagna. Imola was incorporated into the short lived [[Cispadane Republic]] (16 October 1796 \u2013 9 July 1797). On 18 October 1797 Bonaparte entered into the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] with the Austrians, promising them in secret clauses the Republic of Venice; he was able to withdraw to Paris, and then set off on his eastern expedition. In his Christmas message of 1797, therefore, Cardinal Chiaramonti faced impossible difficulties in attempting to calm the Imolese and to suggest a way through the political situation. He wrote.<ref>{{cite book|author=Alexis Francois Artaud de Montor|title=The Lives and Times of the Popes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNquhfZ5kNwC&pg=PA10|edition=second|volume=Volume 9|year=1911|publisher=Catholic Publication Society of America|location=New York|page=10}} {{cite book|author=Gregorio Barnaba Chiaramonti|title=Omelia del cardinale Chiaramonti (Pio 7.) detta al popolo d'Imola nel Natale dell'anno 1797|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0c09dPjjL2EC&pg=PA7|year=1859|publisher=F.

The Conclave to elect his successor took some time to find a secure place to hold its meetings. The pope and cardinals had been expelled from Rome in 1798, and there were few places where the cardinals could assemble without fear of French interference. They chose Venice, which was under the \"protection\" of the Austrians. [[Papal conclave, 1799\u20131800|The Conclave]] opened on 30 November 1799, and on 14 March 1800 Cardinal Chiaramonti, Bishop of Imola, was elected pope. He chose the name Pius VII. He did not, however, relinquish the diocese of Imola, retaining it until his return from his imprisonment in France (1808\u20131814) by the Emperor Napoleon. In the Consistory of 8 March 1816, Pius resigned the diocese of Imola into the hands of Cardinal Antonio Rusconi.<ref>Gaetano Moroni, ''Dizionario di erudizione storico-ecclesiastica'' Vol. XXXIV (Venezia: Tipografia Emiliana 1845), p. 109 column 1.

The dignities were: the Provost, the Archdeacon, the Archpriest, the Dean, the Primicerius, the Thesaurius, and the Custos. There were eleven Canons, each with a prebend.<ref>Ughelli, ''Italia sacra'' II, p. 622.

The Bishop and Canons together elected the Sacristan, but the bishop alone confirms and invests.<ref>Zaccaria, II, pp. 70-71 (document from the last decade of the 12th century).</ref>\n\nThe Provost and Canons are mentioned as parties to a lawsuit in a mandate of Pope Urban III (1185\u20131187).<ref>Kehr, p. 165 no. 2. Zaccaria, I, p. 116, gives the wrong date of 1124, by confusing Pope Celestine III with Pope Celestine II.</ref> In 1511, Pope Julius II secularized the Provostship, and reserved the appointment to the Holy See. His first appointment was Giovanni Battista Vulpi, a Protonotary Apostolic and brother of the soldier Taddeo Vulpi. The dignity of Primicerius was created in 1504 by Bishop Simone Bonadies (1488\u20131511). The dignity of Treasurer was created in 1513, and was under the patronage of the Saxatelli family, and then the Machirelli. The dignity of Custos was instituted in 1526.<ref>Zaccaria, I, pp. 119-120.</ref> It was Bishop Alessandro Musotti (1579\u20131607) who instituted the Canon Penitentiarius and the Canon Theologus out of the eleven Canons, in accordance with the decree of the [[Council of Trent]].<ref>Zaccaria, I, p. 120.</ref>\n\nIn the 12th century, the Canons lived in Castro S. Cassiani, in a building called the ''Canonica'', which was near enough to the Episcopal Palace that the bishop could observe visually the comings and goings of the Canons. Not all of the Canons resided in the ''Canonica'', however; some are recorded from time to time as living in the Guest House (''Xenodochium'') of the Monastery of S. Vitale, which belonged to the Canons. In the second half of the 12th century, under Bishops Rodulphus (1147\u20131168), Arardus, and Henricus (1173\u20131193), when the Castro S. Cassiani was in ruins, they moved to the village of Duccia.<ref>There was a castle (''castrum'') in Duccia, and a church dedicated to S. Maria de Castro. Zaccaria, I, p. 129.</ref> Then Bishop Henricus built them a new house in Imola itself, to which the Canons moved in 1188.<ref>Zaccaria, I, pp. 121-122. Sometimes a Canon was Abbot of the monastery of S. Vitale.</ref>\n\nAfter his return to Rome from a year-long visit to Imola (having been driven out of his native Florence), Cardinal Niccol\u00f2 Ridolfi, the Apostolic Administrator of Imola (1533\u20131546), sent the diocese a set of Constitutions for the Canons of the Cathedral.<ref>Alberghetti, Parte seconda, p. 153.</ref>\n\nThe city of Imola also had a Collegiate church, San Lorenzo, which was of such ancient foundation that the original church collapsed in 967, and had to be rebuilt. The Chapter was presided over by an Archpriest, and included a number of Canons. In 1313 the financial situation of the church had so diminished due to wars and both internal and external strife that the full complement of Canons could not be maintained. Bishop Matteo Orsini, O.P. (1302\u20131317) therefore ordered that the church should be governed by the Archpriest, and by four Canons in priestly orders.<ref>Kehr, p. 167. Zaccaria, I, pp. 175-182.</ref>\n\n===Synods===\n\nA diocesan synod was an irregular but important meeting of the bishop of a diocese and his clergy. Its purpose was (1) to proclaim generally the various decrees already issued by the bishop; (2) to discuss and ratify measures on which the bishop chose to consult with his clergy; (3) to publish statutes and decrees of the diocesan synod, of the provincial synod, and of the Holy See.<ref name=\"XIV1842\">{{cite book|author=Benedictus XIV|title=Benedicti XIV ...

In the [[Judiciary of Belgium|Belgian criminal justice system]], an assize court is a non-permanent court that holds [[jury trial]]s on the most serious crimes. A few weeks before the actual start of the trial, a [[preliminary hearing]] took place on 20 December 2018, during which the list of [[witness]]es to be heard in the case was decided on. The [[defence attorney]]s of Nemmouche as well as Nemmouche himself opposed having his family members testify during the trial. According to Nemmouche's defence, this was because \"Mr Nemmouche did not want to argue on emotion, but on the facts\". His defence also requested to [[Adjournment|adjourn]] the case for two weeks, in order to give them the opportunity to study the case more in-depth. The adjournment of the case was rejected by the court, however. It was also decided that about 120 witnesses in total would be heard in the case.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|title=Geen uitstel voor proces Nemmouche over aanslag Joods museum, bijna 120 getuigen worden opgeroepen|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|last2=Verhaeghe|first2=Chris|date=20 December 2018|website=www.vrt.be|publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|language=Dutch|trans-title=No delay for trial Nemmouche about attack on Jewish museum, almost 120 witnesses will be summoned|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221215344/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|archive-date=21 December 2018|url-status=|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 January 2019, three days before the start of the actual trial, the jurors on the assize jury were selected.

A significant number of them asked to be exempt from [[jury duty]] for various reasons.

In the reasoning the jury gave for its [[verdict]], required by Belgian law, the main evidence against Nemmouche was summed up. The evidence against Nemmouche included the fact he was carrying the weapons used in the attack with him when he was arrested in Marseille, together with the clothing the perpetrator worn as seen on the security footage from the Museum. Both the weapons and the clothing had his [[DNA]] on them, and [[gunshot residue]] was also found on the clothing in question. A [[footprint]] of the sneakers he had with him was found in front of the entrance of the Museum. When he was arrested, he was also carrying some [[electronic media]] with him, on which videos were discovered wherein Nemmouche claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]]. An [[Jihadist flag|ISIS flag]] used in the videos was found along the weapons Nemmouche had with him upon his arrest. The electronic media also contained data, such as [[web browsing history]], which proved Nemmouche had been planning the attack. A direct witness identified Nemmouche as being the perpetrator. Lastly, on a computer belonging to [[Najim Laachraoui]], one of the suicide bombers of the [[2016 Brussels bombings]], conversations were discovered wherein Nemmouche was described as a \"brother\", and plans were discussed to liberate him from his incarceration.<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted\">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/brussels-jewish-museum-terror-attack-french-citizen-convicted|title=Brussels Jewish museum terror attack: French citizen convicted|date=7 March 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190311022456/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/brussels-jewish-museum-terror-attack-french-citizen-convicted|archive-date=11 March 2019|website=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|last=Petitjean|first=Sophie|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2019/03/07/tuerie-du-musee-juif-nemmouche-reconnu-coupable-de-quatre-assassinats-terroristes_5432924_1653578.html|title=Proc\u00e8s du Mus\u00e9e juif de Bruxelles: Nemmouche reconnu coupable de quatre assassinats terroristes|date=7 March 2019|work=[[Le Monde]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401234616/https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2019/03/07/tuerie-du-musee-juif-nemmouche-reconnu-coupable-de-quatre-assassinats-terroristes_5432924_1653578.html|archive-date=1 April 2020|language=French|trans-title=Trial over Jewish Museum of Brussels: Nemmouche found guilty of four terrorist murders}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/07/nemmouche-schuldvraag/|title=Mehdi Nemmouche schuldig aan viervoudige terroristische moord in het Joods Museum, Bendrer is mededader|date=7 March 2019|work=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031012840/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/07/nemmouche-schuldvraag/|archive-date=31 October 2019|language=Dutch|trans-title=Mehdi Nemmouche guilty of four counts of terrorist murder in Jewish Museum, Bendrer is co-author}}</ref>\n\nThe jury considered that the [[Real evidence|material evidence]] proved Nemmouche was the perpetrator of the attack. Based on the weapons used, the security footage of the Museum, and the [[Expert witness|expert testimony]] of the [[Medical examiner|medical examiners]] who examined the bodies of the victims, the jury found Nemmouche had the [[Intention (criminal law)|intention]] to kill. The jury furthermore affirmed the premeditated nature of the killings based on the preparatory acts Nemmouche carried out, such as the procurement of the weapons he used. The terrorist intentions of Nemmouche were upheld based on his [[Jihadism|jihadist]] stay in [[Syria]] in 2012, the videos he made in which he claimed responsibility for the attacks in the name of ISIS, and the conversations about Nemmouche retained from Najim Laachraoui's computer. The verdict also rejected the claim that Nemmouche was set up by intelligence officials. The jury lamented the lack of any element brought forward by the defence which would support those allegations. The existence of a setup was therefor deemed to lack \"sufficient plausibility and credibility\".<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAside from Nemmouche, the jury also found Nacer Bendrer guilty of being the co-author, and not just the [[accomplice]], of the terrorist attack by supplying the weapons Nemmouche used.<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Sentence ===\nBoth men were sentenced on 12 March 2019: Nemmouche was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], while Bendrer received a 15-year prison sentence.

The court considered Nemmouche's troubled upbringing to be no [[Mitigating factor|mitigating circumstance]] for such a grave act, and it also took into account the violent nature of the murders, Nemmouche's rejection of the [[Rechtsstaat|''rechtsstaat'']], and his complete lack of empathy and respect for his victims, amongst other factors. According to the court, he presented a high risk of [[recidivism]]. Regarding Bendrer on the other hand, the court described him as having played a decisive role in the attack by supplying the weapons used to Nemmouche. The court considered he knew what they would be used for, and was indifferent to the consequences to others. However, the court also upheld some mitigating circumstances, such as Bendrer having steered clear of any [[Islamic extremism]] since his arrest, and him having shown empathy and regret for the victims. Bendrer was deemed to present a low risk of recidivism.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Cassation and damages ===\n\nBendrer later lodged an appeal in cassation against his conviction with the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]]. This meant the civil part of the proceedings before the court of assizes (without the jury) with regards to [[damages]] had to be postponed.

A few weeks before the actual start of the trial, a [[preliminary hearing]] took place on 20 December 2018, during which the list of [[witness]]es to be heard in the case was decided on. The [[defence attorney]]s of Nemmouche as well as Nemmouche himself opposed having his family members testify during the trial. According to Nemmouche's defence, this was because \"Mr Nemmouche did not want to argue on emotion, but on the facts\". His defence also requested to [[Adjournment|adjourn]] the case for two weeks, in order to give them the opportunity to study the case more in-depth. The adjournment of the case was rejected by the court, however. It was also decided that about 120 witnesses in total would be heard in the case.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|title=Geen uitstel voor proces Nemmouche over aanslag Joods museum, bijna 120 getuigen worden opgeroepen|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|last2=Verhaeghe|first2=Chris|date=20 December 2018|website=www.vrt.be|publisher=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|language=Dutch|trans-title=No delay for trial Nemmouche about attack on Jewish museum, almost 120 witnesses will be summoned|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181221215344/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2018/12/20/enorme-veiligheidsmaatregelen-voor-voorbereidende-zitting-proces/|archive-date=21 December 2018|url-status=|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn 7 January 2019, three days before the start of the actual trial, the jurors on the assize jury were selected.

In the reasoning the jury gave for its [[verdict]], required by Belgian law, the main evidence against Nemmouche was summed up. The evidence against Nemmouche included the fact he was carrying the weapons used in the attack with him when he was arrested in Marseille, together with the clothing the perpetrator worn as seen on the security footage from the Museum. Both the weapons and the clothing had his [[DNA]] on them, and [[gunshot residue]] was also found on the clothing in question. A [[footprint]] of the sneakers he had with him was found in front of the entrance of the Museum. When he was arrested, he was also carrying some [[electronic media]] with him, on which videos were discovered wherein Nemmouche claimed responsibility for the attack in the name of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]]. An [[Jihadist flag|ISIS flag]] used in the videos was found along the weapons Nemmouche had with him upon his arrest. The electronic media also contained data, such as [[web browsing history]], which proved Nemmouche had been planning the attack. A direct witness identified Nemmouche as being the perpetrator. Lastly, on a computer belonging to [[Najim Laachraoui]], one of the suicide bombers of the [[2016 Brussels bombings]], conversations were discovered wherein Nemmouche was described as a \"brother\", and plans were discussed to liberate him from his incarceration.<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted\">{{cite news|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/brussels-jewish-museum-terror-attack-french-citizen-convicted|title=Brussels Jewish museum terror attack: French citizen convicted|date=7 March 2019|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=15 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190311022456/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/mar/07/brussels-jewish-museum-terror-attack-french-citizen-convicted|archive-date=11 March 2019|website=}}</ref><ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|last=Petitjean|first=Sophie|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2019/03/07/tuerie-du-musee-juif-nemmouche-reconnu-coupable-de-quatre-assassinats-terroristes_5432924_1653578.html|title=Proc\u00e8s du Mus\u00e9e juif de Bruxelles: Nemmouche reconnu coupable de quatre assassinats terroristes|date=7 March 2019|work=[[Le Monde]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401234616/https://www.lemonde.fr/police-justice/article/2019/03/07/tuerie-du-musee-juif-nemmouche-reconnu-coupable-de-quatre-assassinats-terroristes_5432924_1653578.html|archive-date=1 April 2020|language=French|trans-title=Trial over Jewish Museum of Brussels: Nemmouche found guilty of four terrorist murders}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/07/nemmouche-schuldvraag/|title=Mehdi Nemmouche schuldig aan viervoudige terroristische moord in het Joods Museum, Bendrer is mededader|date=7 March 2019|work=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031012840/https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/07/nemmouche-schuldvraag/|archive-date=31 October 2019|language=Dutch|trans-title=Mehdi Nemmouche guilty of four counts of terrorist murder in Jewish Museum, Bendrer is co-author}}</ref>\n\nThe jury considered that the [[Real evidence|material evidence]] proved Nemmouche was the perpetrator of the attack. Based on the weapons used, the security footage of the Museum, and the [[Expert witness|expert testimony]] of the [[Medical examiner|medical examiners]] who examined the bodies of the victims, the jury found Nemmouche had the [[Intention (criminal law)|intention]] to kill. The jury furthermore affirmed the premeditated nature of the killings based on the preparatory acts Nemmouche carried out, such as the procurement of the weapons he used. The terrorist intentions of Nemmouche were upheld based on his [[Jihadism|jihadist]] stay in [[Syria]] in 2012, the videos he made in which he claimed responsibility for the attacks in the name of ISIS, and the conversations about Nemmouche retained from Najim Laachraoui's computer. The verdict also rejected the claim that Nemmouche was set up by intelligence officials. The jury lamented the lack of any element brought forward by the defence which would support those allegations. The existence of a setup was therefor deemed to lack \"sufficient plausibility and credibility\".<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAside from Nemmouche, the jury also found Nacer Bendrer guilty of being the co-author, and not just the [[accomplice]], of the terrorist attack by supplying the weapons Nemmouche used.<ref name=\"RawlinsonConvicted\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Sentence ===\nBoth men were sentenced on 12 March 2019: Nemmouche was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], while Bendrer received a 15-year prison sentence. In addition, Nemmouche was sentenced to a 15-year period of judicial surveillance. This provision means that if he would ever be released on [[parole]], he would be monitored by a sentence enforcement court, which could potentially order his incarceration for an additional 15 years. Bendrer was also sentenced to a 5-year period of such judicial surveillance.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-47533533|title=Brussels Jewish Museum murders: Mehdi Nemmouche jailed for life|date=12 March 2019|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=15 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|last=Decr\u00e9|first=Hanne|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/nl/2019/03/11/nemmouche-en-bendrer-veroordeeld/|title=Mehdi Nemmouche krijgt levenslang voor aanslag op Joods Museum, mededader Nacer Bendrer 15 jaar|date=12 March 2019|work=[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT NWS]]|access-date=16 April 2020|url-status=live|last2=Verhaeghe|first2=Chris|language=Dutch|trans-title=Mehdi Nemmouche gets life sentence for attack on Jewish Museum, accomplice Nacer Bendrer 15 years}}</ref>\n\nIn its judgment, the court stated that the terrorist attack on the Jewish Museum constituted an attack on the fundamental values of Belgian society, in particular the [[Freedom of religion in Belgium|freedom of religion]] of the Jewish community of Belgium. The court considered Nemmouche's troubled upbringing to be no [[Mitigating factor|mitigating circumstance]] for such a grave act, and it also took into account the violent nature of the murders, Nemmouche's rejection of the [[Rechtsstaat|''rechtsstaat'']], and his complete lack of empathy and respect for his victims, amongst other factors. According to the court, he presented a high risk of [[recidivism]]. Regarding Bendrer on the other hand, the court described him as having played a decisive role in the attack by supplying the weapons used to Nemmouche. The court considered he knew what they would be used for, and was indifferent to the consequences to others. However, the court also upheld some mitigating circumstances, such as Bendrer having steered clear of any [[Islamic extremism]] since his arrest, and him having shown empathy and regret for the victims. Bendrer was deemed to present a low risk of recidivism.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Cassation and damages ===\n\nBendrer later lodged an appeal in cassation against his conviction with the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]]. This meant the civil part of the proceedings before the court of assizes (without the jury) with regards to [[damages]] had to be postponed. On 18 September 2019, the Court of Cassation rejected the appeal, which established the criminal sentence as final.<ref>{{cite
