It lies between Golden Ball Hill, to the east, and Walker Hill, to the west.  At the top of the hill is a [[causewayed enclosure]], a form of [[Neolithic]] earthwork which began to appear in England from about 3700 BC, characterized by the full or partial enclosure of an area with ditches that are interrupted by gaps, or causeways.  It is not known what they were used for; they may have been settlements, or meeting places, or ritual sites of some kind.  Knap Hill is notable for having been the first causewayed enclosure to be excavated and identified, and has been scheduled as an [[ancient monument]].\n\n[[Ben Cunnington (archaeologist)|Benjamin]] and [[Maud Cunnington]] spent two summers investigating the site, in 1908 and 1909, and Maud published two reports of their work, noting that there were several gaps in the ditch and bank surrounding the enclosure.  In the late 1920s, after the excavation of [[Windmill Hill, Avebury|Windmill Hill]] among other sites, it became apparent that causewayed enclosures were a characteristic monument of the Neolithic period.  At first they were thought to have been inhabited, and so were called \"causewayed camps\", but that name has fallen out of use.  About seventy causewayed enclosures have now been found in Britain, and about a thousand in all in Europe.\n\nThe site was excavated again in 1961 by [[Graham Connah]], who kept excellent stratigraphic documentation. In 2011 the Gathering Time project published an analysis of [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] from almost forty British causewayed enclosures, including several new dates from Connah's finds.  The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch had silted up at some time between 3525 and 3220 BC.\n\nTwo barrows lay within the Neolithic enclosure, and at least one more outside it.  The hilltop also contains the remains of a Romano-British settlement on an adjoining smaller area called the plateau enclosure, along with some evidence of occupation in the 17th century. An [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] sword was found in the smaller enclosure, and there is evidence of an intense fire in the same area, which may imply a violent end to the Romano-British occupation of the hilltop.  Knap Hill is near two other Neolithic sites: [[Adam's Grave]], a chambered [[long barrow]] less than a mile (1.6 km) to the west, and [[Rybury]], another causewayed enclosure, {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond Adam's Grave.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Knap Hill area from OS map 1961.png|thumb|upright=3|Area around Knap Hill in Wiltshire]]\nThe main archaeological site at Knap Hill is a [[causewayed enclosure]],<ref>Oswald et al.

(2001), p. 3.</ref>  (Both the causewayed enclosure and the hill itself are referred to as Knap Hill.)  Causewayed enclosures are characterized by a full or partial enclosure of an area with segmented ditches (that is, ditches interrupted by gaps, or causeways, of unexcavated ground), often with earthworks and palisades in some combination.<ref name=\":3\" />  The use to which these enclosures were put has long been a matter of debate, and many suggestions have been made by researchers.

There is also evidence that they played a role in funeral rites: material such as food, pottery, and human remains were deliberately deposited in the ditches.<ref>Whittle, Healy & Bayliss (2015), pp. 10\u201311.</ref>  They were constructed in a short time, which implies significant organization since substantial labour would have been required, for clearing the land, preparing trees for use as posts or palisades, and digging the ditches.<ref>Andersen (2019), p. 807.</ref>\n\nIn 1930, [[Cecil Curwen]] identified sixteen sites that were definitely or probably Neolithic causewayed enclosures.<ref>Curwen (1930).</ref><ref name=\":8\">Oswald et al.

Several other upland enclosures are similarly situated, and this is probably not by chance.  [[White Sheet Hill|Whitesheet Hill]], [[Combe Hill]] and Rybury are other examples of enclosures that are hard to identify when seen from the lower ground below them, but which are much more visible viewed from the neighbouring uplands.<ref>Oswald et al.

The western barrow was about {{convert|2|ft|cm|-1|spell=in}} high, with a small ditch around it.  Near the top of the barrow Thurman found animal bones, which he described as \"of a sheep and perhaps other ruminants\", and commented in his account that this was consistent with other barrows in Wiltshire, which often contained animal bones near the surface of the barrow.  He speculated that they were probably from a sacrifice or feast over the graves.  Under the middle of the barrow was a circular hole dug into the chalk, {{convert|2|ft|cm|-1|spell=in}} deep and {{convert|2|ft|cm|-1|spell=in}} across.  It was almost full of ashes and burnt bones. The barrow outside the enclosure, which lay to the southwest, was about a foot (30 cm) high and Thurnam found nothing there but some animal bones near the surface.<ref name=\":11\">Thurnam (1860), pp. 326\u2013327.</ref><ref name=\":10\">Cunnington (1912), p. 43.</ref>\n\n=== Benjamin and Maud Cunnington, 1908-9 ===\nThe Neolithic enclosure was first excavated by [[Maud Cunnington|Maud]] and [[Ben Cunnington (archaeologist)|Benjamin Cunnington]], in the summers of 1908 and 1909.  The first summer's investigation revealed the segmented nature of the earthworks, and led to the publication of a short note by Maud Cunnington in the journal ''[[Man (journal)|Man]]'' in 1909 in which she asked readers of the journal to suggest explanations:<ref>Cunnington (1909), pp. 49\u201352.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Recent excavations [at] Knap Hill Camp in Wiltshire revealed a feature which, if intentional, appears to be a method of defence hitherto unobserved in prehistoric fortifications in Britain...There are six openings or gaps through the rampart.  It was thought at first that...some of these gaps were due to cattle tracks, or possibly had been made for agricultural purposes....  Excavations clearly showed that none of these gaps in the rampart are the result of wear or of any accidental circumstance, but that they are actually part of the original construction of the camp....  Outside of, and corresponding to, each gap the ditch was never dug; that is to say, a solid gangway or causeway of unexcavated ground has been left in each case....Given the need for an entrenchment at all, it seems at first sight inexplicable why these frequent openings should have been left, when apparently they so weaken the whole construction....  It has been suggested...that the work of fortifications was never finished, [but there is] considerable evidence in favour of these causeways being an intentional feature of the original design of the camp... The possible use which the gangways may have served is put forward with all diffidence, and any suggestion on the subject would be welcomed.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Knap Hill Camp map M.E.

The Cunningtons found pottery sherds in the long bank that she dated to Roman times, and also found in the centre of the bank that two pits lay beneath it, marked P.P. on the plan.  These had been dug from the ground level before the bank was raised, and were both circular, about {{convert|2|ft|cm|-1|spell=in}} deep, and {{convert|3.5|to(-)|4|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter.  These contained flint flakes, coarse pottery and some animal bones, and Cunnington concluded that they were contemporary with the old enclosure and that it was a coincidence the long bank was raised over them.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 51\u201353.</ref>  A 6th-century [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] iron sword was found towards the edge of the long mound (at G on the plan). A round fire hole was found under the circular mound, containing wood ash and pottery, some of which Cunnington identified as Roman.  Another fireplace was found to the southeast of the long mound, in a rectangular area of raised earth (which Cunnington referred to as the dais) ; this fireplace was T-shaped, and contained the lower stone of a [[Quern-stone|quern]], damaged by heat, four iron nails, and several fragments of pottery.  Cunnington suggested that the fireplace must have been unusable once the quern was in it, and that this, along with the presence of the sword and the evidence of intense heat, implied a catastrophic end to the inhabitation of the enclosure.<ref name=\":19\"/>\n\n[[File:Knap Hill 1908-9 excavation section A.png|thumb|upright=2.5|Section through the ditch at cutting A-A in the 1908\u20131909 excavation.<ref name=\":21\" />]]\nBetween the long bank and the dais were the remains of a small building (marked E on the plan), {{convert|23|by|13.5|ft|abbr=on}}, with walls made of blocks of chalk.  Postholes were found at intervals in the walls. A rubbish pile next to the building yielded a sherd of 17th century pottery, and in the area of the building and the dais were numerous clay pipes, some of which retained their makers' stamps and so could be dated with accuracy.  The pipes and the pottery sherds from this area both were dated to the 17th century, mixed with Roman pottery in the dais, which led Cunnington to conclude that the dais had been cultivated by the 17th-century inhabitants of the hilltop, since that would have led to turning the soil on the dais and mixing the sherds at different levels.  The ruins of another rectangular building (F on the plan) was found against the eastern side of the plateau enclosure's bank, with both Roman and 17th-century pottery sherds in the walls and under the foundations.  It was apparent that the building had been erected after the plateau enclosure had been built, but the Cunningtons found no other evidence that would help determine its date.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\nThe Cunningtons also opened the barrow outside the old enclosure, to the southwest (not marked on their plan, but labelled \"Grinsell 10\" on Connah's plan, below), and found a skeleton fairly near the surface, face down.  It was missing all the bones of the legs and feet, and the right hand; Cunnington speculated that the skeleton had been placed so near the surface of the barrow that the missing bones had been disturbed by animals.  The only pottery sherds found were from the Roman period and were all near the surface, implying that the burial preceded the Roman occupation.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 58\u201359.</ref>\n\nTwo low banks were found, running down the hill: one from the two ditches marked S on the plan, and one on the other side of the enclosure, leading down from one of the causeways on the northwestern edge.  The one to the east was known locally as \"The Devil's Trackway\".  The northwestern bank led for {{convert|50|yd|m|spell=in}} towards an old track across the hill.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== C.W. Phillips, 1939 ===\nIn 1939 C.W. Phillips excavated a [[bowl barrow]] outside the enclosure, but never published a report.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />  Two barrows outside the enclosure are listed in a gazetteer of Wiltshire by [[Leslie Grinsell]], published in 1957, identified as Alton 10 and Alton 13.  Phillips excavated Alton 13, but it may be that the two barrows are the same, in which case the barrow Phillips excavated was the same one that Thurman investigated in the 1850s.  Phillips found a crouched burial, at the old ground surface, and Neolithic potsherds; the potsherds may not indicate that the barrow is of Neolithic date since the sherds might have been present on the site at the time the barrow was constructed.  Grinsell cites Phillips to say that the barrow lay to the south of the causewayed enclosure, and if this is correct it is not the same barrow that Thurman opened.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Graham Connah, 1961 ===\n[[File:Knap Hill map RHCM Connah 1961.png|thumb|upright=4|Knap Hill site, showing trenches (i through iii) and the excavated area (iv) from the 1961 excavation<ref name=\":16\" />]]\nIn 1961, the causewayed enclosure was excavated again, by [[Graham Connah]].<ref name=\":4\" />  Three trenches (i to iii in the diagram at right) were cut across three different segments of the ditches and banks, and one causeway (iv in the diagram) was fully excavated, including both ends of the two ditches abutting it.<ref>Connah (1965), pp. 2\u20133.</ref>  Like the Cunningtons, Connah found a knapping cluster at the surface of the chalk in one of his cuttings.<ref name=\":18\" />  Connah found only a few sherds of pottery, and so combined his finds with those from the earlier excavation for analysis purposes, though some documentation on the exact provenance of the earlier finds had been lost since 1912.  Most of the sherds found in 1961 had flint [[Temper (pottery)|inclusions]], but four sherds, from a single pot, had shell inclusions, and so must have come from at least {{convert|20|mi|km}} away.  Similar combinations of finds had been reported at [[Windmill Hill, Avebury|Windmill Hill]], [[Robin Hood's Ball]], and [[White Sheet Hill|Whitesheet Hill]].<ref name=\":5\">Connah (1965), p. 11.</ref>  Connah classified the pottery from the ditches as [[Windmill Hill ware]],<ref name=\":5\" /> a classification current in the 1960s that attempted to identify individual cultures within the Neolithic, but since overturned in favour of separating Neolithic sites into Early and Late Neolithic.<ref>Pouncett (2008), p. 37.</ref>  In addition to the Windmill Hill ware, fragments from seven or eight pots of [[Beaker ware]] were found.  Connah also found some Romano-British pottery in his cuttings, including four [[Samian ware|Samian]] sherds, one of which could be dated to the late 1st century AD.  Some later medieval pottery fragments, found in the upper layers of the cuttings, could not be accurately dated.<ref>Connah (1965), p. 12.</ref><ref>Connah (1965), p. 14.</ref>\n\nIn one of the cuttings a skeleton of a woman was found, near the top of the ditch.  Nails found around the feet were interpreted as the remains of boots that had been reinforced with them.  Connah concluded that the skeleton probably dated to the Roman-British occupation, and that the Neolithic ditch was simply an area of conveniently soft ground for the burial.<ref>Connah (1965), p. 7.</ref>  The woman was probably in her 40s when she died, and was about {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall.  She suffered from [[osteoarthritis]], and had abcesses in her jaw: an evaluation by the Duckworth Laboratory in Cambridge concluded that she \"most probably suffered agonies\".<ref>Connah (1965). pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\nConnah identified ditches on both sides of the bank leading down from the eastern corner of the causewayed enclosure, and his excavation of one of the causeways (marked \"iv\" on his plan) found a shallow ditch cut in the chalk along the line of the bank leading down the hill on that side, which lay beneath a ditch along one side of that bank.  None of these ditches had been noticed by the Cunningtons.  Connah concluded that both were likely to have been constructed to mark boundaries.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" />\n\n=== Gathering Time, 2011 ===\nIn 2011, the Gathering Time project published the results of a programme to reanalyze the radiocarbon dates of nearly 40 causewayed enclosures, using [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian analysis]].  Knap Hill was one of the sites included in the project.  Connah had obtained two radiocarbon dates on samples gathered during the 1961 excavation, which he had published in 1969; these results were included in the Gathering Time analysis, and one was resampled and tested again.  Five other samples drawn from Connah's finds were also radiocarbon dated, as Connah's stratigraphic recording was precise enough to make it possible to identify samples which had good [[Glossary of archaeology|association]] with the building of the enclosure.  The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch had silted up at some time between 3525 and 3220 BC.<ref>Whittle, Bayliss & Healy (2015), pp. 99\u2013102.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=notes/>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Sources ==\n\n*{{Cite book|last=Andersen|first=Niels H.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Neolithic Europe|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-883249-2|editor-last=Fowler|editor-first=Chris|location=Oxford|pages=795-812|chapter=Causewayed Enclosures in Northern and Western Europe|orig-year=2015|editor-last2=Harding|editor-first2=Jan|editor-last3=Hofmann|editor-first3=Daniela}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Connah|first=Graham|date=1969|title=Radiocarbon dating for Knap Hill|journal=Antiquity|volume=43|pages=304\u2013305|via=|issue=172|url=|ref=none}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Connah|first=Graham|last2=Smith|first2=I.F.|date=1965|title=Excavations at Knap Hill, Alton Priors|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/138882#page/7/mode/1up|journal=Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine|volume=60|pages=1\u201323|via=}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Crawford|first=O.G.S.|title=Archaeology in the Field|publisher=Phoenix House|year=1960|location=London|pages=|orig-year=1953}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Cunnington|first=M.E.|year=1909|title=On a remarkable feature in the entrenchments of Knap Hill Camp, Wiltshire|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2839810|journal=Man|volume=9|pages=49\u201352|doi=10.2307/2839810}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Cunnington|first=M.E.|date=1912|title=Knap Hill Camp|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/132441#page/68/mode/1up|journal=Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine|volume=37|pages=42-65|via=}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Curwen|first=E.

It lies between Golden Ball Hill, to the east, and Walker Hill, to the west.  At the top of the hill is a [[causewayed enclosure]], a form of [[Neolithic]] earthwork which began to appear in England from about 3700 BC, characterized by the full or partial enclosure of an area with ditches that are interrupted by gaps, or causeways.  It is not known what they were used for; they may have been settlements, or meeting places, or ritual sites of some kind.  It is notable for having been the first causewayed enclosure to be excavated and identified, and it has been scheduled as an [[ancient monument]].\n\n[[Ben Cunnington (archaeologist)|Benjamin]] and [[Maud Cunnington]] spent two summers investigating the site, in 1908 and 1909, and Maud Cunnington published two reports of their work, noting that there were multiple gaps in the ditch and bank surrounding the enclosure.  In the late 1920s, after the excavation of [[Windmill Hill, Avebury|Windmill Hill]] among other sites, it became apparent that causewayed enclosures were a characteristic monument of the Neolithic period.  Originally they were thought to have been inhabited, and so were called \"causewayed camps\", but that name has fallen out of use.  About seventy causewayed enclosures have now been found in Britain, and about a thousand in all in Europe.\n\nThe site was excavated again in 1961 by [[Graham Connah]], who kept excellent stratigraphic documentation. In 2011 the Gathering Time project published an analysis of [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon dates]] from almost forty British causewayed enclosures, including several new dates from Connah's finds.  The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch had silted up at some time between 3525 and 3220 BC.\n\nTwo barrows lay within the Neolithic enclosure, and at least one more outside it.  The hilltop also contains the remains of a Romano-British settlement on an adjoining smaller area called the plateau enclosure, along with some evidence of occupation in the 17th century. An [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] sword was found in the smaller enclosure, and there is evidence of an intense fire in the same area, which may imply a violent end to the Romano-British occupation of the hilltop.  Knap Hill is near two other Neolithic sites: [[Adam's Grave]], a chambered [[long barrow]] less than a mile (1.6 km) to the west, and [[Rybury]], another causewayed enclosure, {{convert|2|mi|km|spell=in}} beyond Adam's Grave.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Knap Hill area from OS map 1961.png|thumb|upright=3|Area around Knap Hill in Wiltshire]]\nThe main archaeological site at Knap Hill is a [[causewayed enclosure]],<ref>Oswald et al.

(2001), p. 3.</ref>  (Both the causewayed enclosure and the hill itself are referred to as Knap Hill.)  Causewayed enclosures are characterized by a full or partial enclosure of an area with segmented ditches (that is, ditches interrupted by gaps, or causeways, of unexcavated ground), often with earthworks and palisades in some combination.<ref name=\":3\" />  The use to which these enclosures were put has long been a matter of debate, and many suggestions have been made by researchers.  They may have seen use as settlements\u2014early investigators suggested that the inhabitants lived in the ditches, but this idea was later abandoned in favour of any settlement being within the enclosure boundaries.<ref name=\":7\">Whittle, Healy & Bayliss (2015), p. 5.</ref>  In a 1912 report on an excavation at Knap Hill it was assumed that the ramparts were a form of defence.<ref name=\":6\">Cunnington (1912), p.48.</ref> The causeways were difficult to explain in military terms, though it was suggested they could have been sally ports for defenders to emerge from and attack a besieging force;<ref name=\":6\" /><ref>Curwen (1930), p. 50.</ref> evidence of attacks at some sites provided support for the idea that the enclosures were fortified settlements.<ref name=\":7\" /> They may have been seasonal meeting places, used for trading cattle or other goods such as pottery, and if they were a focus for the local people, they may have been evidence of a local hierarchy with a tribal chief.  There is also evidence that they played a role in funeral rites: material such as food, pottery, and human remains were deliberately deposited in the ditches.<ref>Whittle, Healy & Bayliss (2015), pp. 10\u201311.</ref>  They were constructed in a short time, which implies significant organization since substantial labour would have been required, for clearing the land, preparing trees for use as posts or palisades, and digging the ditches.<ref>Andersen (2019), p. 807.</ref>\n\nIn 1930, [[Cecil Curwen]] identified sixteen sites that were definitely or probably Neolithic causewayed enclosures.<ref>Curwen (1930).</ref><ref name=\":8\">Oswald et al.

The first summer's investigation revealed the segmented nature of the earthworks, and led to the publication of a short note by Maud Cunnington in the journal ''[[Man (journal)|Man]]'' in 1909 in which she asked readers of the journal to suggest explanations:<ref>Cunnington (1909), pp. 49\u201352.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Recent excavations [at] Knap Hill Camp in Wiltshire revealed a feature which, if intentional, appears to be a method of defence hitherto unobserved in prehistoric fortifications in Britain...There are six openings or gaps through the rampart.  It was thought at first that...some of these gaps were due to cattle tracks, or possibly had been made for agricultural purposes....  Excavations clearly showed that none of these gaps in the rampart are the result of wear or of any accidental circumstance, but that they are actually part of the original construction of the camp....  Outside of, and corresponding to, each gap the ditch was never dug; that is to say, a solid gangway or causeway of unexcavated ground has been left in each case....Given the need for an entrenchment at all, it seems at first sight inexplicable why these frequent openings should have been left, when apparently they so weaken the whole construction....  It has been suggested...that the work of fortifications was never finished, [but there is] considerable evidence in favour of these causeways being an intentional feature of the original design of the camp... The possible use which the gangways may have served is put forward with all diffidence, and any suggestion on the subject would be welcomed.</blockquote>\n\n[[File:Knap Hill Camp map M.E.

They also made cuttings along the southern edge of the hilltop to determine if a ditch existed there which was no longer visible on the surface, and found two short ditch sections at the eastern corner (marked S\u2013S on the plan).<ref name=\":20\">Cunnington (1912), pp. 59\u201360.</ref>  Most of the relics obtained from the ditches were found in clusters, and were usually within a foot (30 cm) of the bottom; they included some sherds of pottery, flint flakes and burnt flints, fragments of animal bones, and pieces of sarsen stone.

Cunnington considered the plateau enclosure to be no earlier than the early [[Iron Age]].<ref name=\":12\" /><ref name=\":14\" />  The ditch and low rampart that surrounded the enclosure were mostly undetectable on the surface; the Cunningtons cut sections around the perimeter at intervals to confirm their path.<ref name=\":12\" />  A gap was also found in the plateau enclosure ditch at the southwestern edge, where it overlapped with the old enclosure, but Cunnington could not tell what the gap was for\u2014an entrance was implausible as the bank was very steep at that point.<ref name=\":15\" />  The pottery found in the plateau ditch and bank was of much better quality than the coarse Neolithic pottery associated with the old enclosure: it included [[bead-rim pottery]] which Cunnington dated to just before, or during the early years of, the Roman occupation.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 50\u201351.</ref>\n\n[[File:Knap Hill Saxon sword.png|left|thumb|upright=2|Anglo-Saxon sword found in the plateau enclosure by the Cunningtons<ref name=\":22\" />]]\nWithin the plateau enclosure was a long bank, running from southwest to northeast, with a circular mound at the northeastern end.  The Cunningtons found pottery sherds in the long bank that she dated to Roman times, and also found in the centre of the bank that two pits lay beneath it, marked P.P. on the plan.  These had been dug from the ground level before the bank was raised, and were both circular, about {{convert|2|ft|cm|-1|spell=in}} deep, and {{convert|3.5|to(-)|4|ft|abbr=on}} in diameter.  These contained flint flakes, coarse pottery and some animal bones, and Cunnington concluded that they were contemporary with the old enclosure and that it was a coincidence the long bank was raised over them.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 51\u201353.</ref>  A 6th-century [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] iron sword was found towards the edge of the long mound (at G on the plan). A round fire hole was found under the circular mound, containing wood ash and pottery, some of which Cunnington identified as Roman.  Another fireplace was found to the southeast of the long mound, in a rectangular area of raised earth (which Cunnington referred to as the dais) ; this fireplace was T-shaped, and contained the lower stone of a [[Quern-stone|quern]], damaged by heat, four iron nails, and several fragments of pottery.  Cunnington suggested that the fireplace must have been unusable once the quern was in it, and that this, along with the presence of the sword and the evidence of intense heat, implied a catastrophic end to the inhabitation of the enclosure.<ref name=\":19\"/>\n\n[[File:Knap Hill 1908-9 excavation section A.png|thumb|upright=2.5|Section through the ditch at cutting A-A in the 1908\u20131909 excavation.<ref name=\":21\" />]]\nBetween the long bank and the dais were the remains of a small building (marked E on the plan), {{convert|23|by|13.5|ft|abbr=on}}, with walls made of blocks of chalk.  Postholes were found at intervals in the walls. A rubbish pile next to the building yielded a sherd of 17th century pottery, and in the area of the building and the dais were numerous clay pipes, some of which retained their makers' stamps and so could be dated with accuracy.  The pipes and the pottery sherds from this area both were dated to the 17th century, mixed with Roman pottery in the dais, which led Cunnington to conclude that the dais had been cultivated by the 17th-century inhabitants of the hilltop, since that would have led to turning the soil on the dais and mixing the sherds at different levels.  The ruins of another rectangular building (F on the plan) was found against the eastern side of the plateau enclosure's bank, with both Roman and 17th-century pottery sherds in the walls and under the foundations.  It was apparent that the building had been erected after the plateau enclosure had been built, but the Cunningtons found no other evidence that would help determine its date.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 55\u201356.</ref>\n\nThe Cunningtons also opened the barrow outside the old enclosure, to the southwest (not marked on their plan, but labelled \"Grinsell 10\" on Connah's plan, below), and found a skeleton fairly near the surface, face down.  It was missing all the bones of the legs and feet, and the right hand; Cunnington speculated that the skeleton had been placed so near the surface of the barrow that the missing bones had been disturbed by animals.  The only pottery sherds found were from the Roman period and were all near the surface, implying that the burial preceded the Roman occupation.<ref>Cunnington (1912), pp. 58\u201359.</ref>\n\nTwo low banks were found, running down the hill: one from the two ditches marked S on the plan, and one on the other side of the enclosure, leading down from one of the causeways on the northwestern edge.  The one to the east was known locally as \"The Devil's Trackway\".  The northwestern bank led for {{convert|50|yd|m|spell=in}} towards an old track across the hill.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== C.W. Phillips, 1939 ===\nIn 1939 C.W. Phillips excavated a [[bowl barrow]] outside the enclosure, but never published a report.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />  Two barrows outside the enclosure are listed in a gazetteer of Wiltshire by [[Leslie Grinsell]], published in 1957, identified as Alton 10 and Alton 13.  Phillips excavated Alton 13, but it may be that the two barrows are the same, in which case the barrow Phillips excavated was the same one that Thurman investigated in the 1850s.  Phillips found a crouched burial, at the old ground surface, and Neolithic potsherds; the potsherds may not indicate that the barrow is of Neolithic date since the sherds might have been present on the site at the time the barrow was constructed.  Grinsell cites Phillips to say that the barrow lay to the south of the causewayed enclosure, and if this is correct it is not the same barrow that Thurman opened.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Graham Connah, 1961 ===\n[[File:Knap Hill map RHCM Connah 1961.png|thumb|upright=4|Knap Hill site, showing trenches (i through iii) and the excavated area (iv) from the 1961 excavation<ref name=\":16\" />]]\nIn 1961, the causewayed enclosure was excavated again, by [[Graham Connah]].<ref name=\":4\" />  Three trenches (i to iii in the diagram at right) were cut across three different segments of the ditches and banks, and one causeway (iv in the diagram) was fully excavated, including both ends of the two ditches abutting it.<ref>Connah (1965), pp. 2\u20133.</ref>  Like the Cunningtons, Connah found a knapping cluster at the surface of the chalk in one of his cuttings.<ref name=\":18\" />  Connah found only a few sherds of pottery, and so combined his finds with those from the earlier excavation for analysis purposes, though some documentation on the exact provenance of the earlier finds had been lost since 1912.  Most of the sherds found in 1961 had flint [[Temper (pottery)|inclusions]], but four sherds, from a single pot, had shell inclusions, and so must have come from at least {{convert|20|mi|km}} away.  Similar combinations of finds had been reported at [[Windmill Hill, Avebury|Windmill Hill]], [[Robin Hood's Ball]], and [[White Sheet Hill|Whitesheet Hill]].<ref name=\":5\">Connah (1965), p. 11.</ref>  Connah classified the pottery from the ditches as [[Windmill Hill ware]],<ref name=\":5\" /> a classification current in the 1960s that attempted to identify individual cultures within the Neolithic, but since overturned in favour of separating Neolithic sites into Early and Late Neolithic.<ref>Pouncett (2008), p. 37.</ref>  In addition to the Windmill Hill ware, fragments from seven or eight pots of [[Beaker ware]] were found.  Connah also found some Romano-British pottery in his cuttings, including four [[Samian ware|Samian]] sherds, one of which could be dated to the late 1st century AD.  Some later medieval pottery fragments, found in the upper layers of the cuttings, could not be accurately dated.<ref>Connah (1965), p. 12.</ref><ref>Connah (1965), p. 14.</ref>\n\nIn one of the cuttings a skeleton of a woman was found, near the top of the ditch.  Nails found around the feet were interpreted as the remains of boots that had been reinforced with them.  Connah concluded that the skeleton probably dated to the Roman-British occupation, and that the Neolithic ditch was simply an area of conveniently soft ground for the burial.<ref>Connah (1965), p. 7.</ref>  The woman was probably in her 40s when she died, and was about {{convert|5|ft|2|in|m}} tall.  She suffered from [[osteoarthritis]], and had abcesses in her jaw: an evaluation by the Duckworth Laboratory in Cambridge concluded that she \"most probably suffered agonies\".<ref>Connah (1965). pp. 18\u201319.</ref>\n\nConnah identified ditches on both sides of the bank leading down from the eastern corner of the causewayed enclosure, and his excavation of one of the causeways (marked \"iv\" on his plan) found a shallow ditch cut in the chalk along the line of the bank leading down the hill on that side, which lay beneath a ditch along one side of that bank.  None of these ditches had been noticed by the Cunningtons.  Connah concluded that both were likely to have been constructed to mark boundaries.<ref name=\":16\" /><ref name=\":17\" />\n\n=== Gathering Time, 2011 ===\nIn 2011, the Gathering Time project published the results of a programme to reanalyze the radiocarbon dates of nearly 40 causewayed enclosures, using [[Bayesian inference|Bayesian analysis]].  Knap Hill was one of the sites included in the project.  Connah had obtained two radiocarbon dates on samples gathered during the 1961 excavation, which he had published in 1969; these results were included in the Gathering Time analysis, and one was resampled and tested again.  Five other samples drawn from Connah's finds were also radiocarbon dated, as Connah's stratigraphic recording was precise enough to make it possible to identify samples which had good [[Glossary of archaeology|association]] with the building of the enclosure.  The conclusion was that there was a 91% chance that Knap Hill was constructed between 3530 and 3375 BC, and a 92% chance that the ditch had silted up at some time between 3525 and 3220 BC.<ref>Whittle, Bayliss & Healy (2015), pp. 99\u2013102.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=notes/>\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n== Sources ==\n\n*{{Cite book|last=Andersen|first=Niels H.|title=The Oxford Handbook of Neolithic Europe|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|isbn=978-0-19-883249-2|editor-last=Fowler|editor-first=Chris|location=Oxford|pages=795-812|chapter=Causewayed Enclosures in Northern and Western Europe|orig-year=2015|editor-last2=Harding|editor-first2=Jan|editor-last3=Hofmann|editor-first3=Daniela}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Connah|first=Graham|date=1969|title=Radiocarbon dating for Knap Hill|journal=Antiquity|volume=43|pages=304\u2013305|via=|issue=172|url=|ref=none}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Connah|first=Graham|last2=Smith|first2=I.F.|date=1965|title=Excavations at Knap Hill, Alton Priors|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/138882#page/7/mode/1up|journal=Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine|volume=60|pages=1\u201323|via=}}\n*{{Cite book|last=Crawford|first=O.G.S.|title=Archaeology in the Field|publisher=Phoenix House|year=1960|location=London|pages=|orig-year=1953}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Cunnington|first=M.E.|year=1909|title=On a remarkable feature in the entrenchments of Knap Hill Camp, Wiltshire|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2839810|journal=Man|volume=9|pages=49\u201352|doi=10.2307/2839810}}\n* {{Cite journal|last=Cunnington|first=M.E.|date=1912|title=Knap Hill Camp|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/132441#page/68/mode/1up|journal=Wiltshire Archaeological and Natural History Magazine|volume=37|pages=42-65|via=}}\n*{{Cite journal|last=Curwen|first=E.

Salm's poetic works are distinguished by a firm and frank pace, by force of thought, philosophical spirit, and by the habit of using the proper word, which contributes to rendering her style as clear, natural and energetic, without taking away elegance and grace. In June 1833, Salm published, ''Mes Soixante ans, ou Mes Souvenirs politiques et litteraires'' (My Sixty Years, or My Political and Literary Memories) (Paris, Bertrand, Didot).

Salm's poetic works are distinguished by a firm and frank pace, by force of thought, philosophical spirit, and by the habit of using the proper word, which contributes to rendering her style as clear, natural and energetic, without taking away elegance and grace. In June 1833, Salm published, ''Mes Soixante ans, ou Mes Souvenirs politiques et litteraires'' (My Sixty Years, or My Political and Literary Memories) (Paris, Bertrand, Didot). Although praised by several newspapers, this work was considered to be mediocre.{{sfn|Collombet|1833|p=283}}\n\nSalm died in Paris, April 13, 1845.{{sfn|Stern|1978|p=160}}<ref name=\"data.bnf.fr\">{{cite web |title=Constance de Salm (1767-1845) |url=https://data.bnf.fr/12531044/constance_de_salm/ |website=data.bnf.fr |publisher=Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France |accessdate=1 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Authority control===\n* {{source-attribution| {{cite book|ref=harv|author=British Museum.
