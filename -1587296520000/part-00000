(formerly [[Saigon]]), to which Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a is linked by [[National Route 1A (Vietnam)|Vietnam Highway 1]].\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nBi\u00ean H\u00f2a has 30 divisions, including the

It was an agricultural and fishing region.\n\nThe [[capture of Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a]] on December 16, 1861 was an important allied victory in the [[Cochinchina Campaign]] (1858\u201362). This campaign, fought between the French and the Spanish on the one side and the Vietnamese (under the [[Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty]]) on the other, began as a limited [[punitive expedition]] and ended as a French war of conquest. The war concluded with the establishment of the French colony of Cochinchina, a development that inaugurated nearly a century of French colonial dominance in Vietnam.\n\n===Republic of Vietnam===\nBi\u00ean H\u00f2a grew into a major suburb of Saigon as the capital city of the [[South Vietnam|Republic of (South) Vietnam]] grew. Following the [[First Indochina War]], tens of thousands of refugees from the northern and central regions of Vietnam&mdash;a large portion of whom were [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]]&mdash;resettled in Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a as part of [[Operation Passage to Freedom]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], the [[United States Air Force]] operated [[Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a Air Base]] near the city. [[Mortar (weapon)|Mortar]] attacks on U.S. and [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]] targets were frequently staged from residential districts in Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a. Two of the better-known attacks took place during T\u1ebft of 1968 as well as 1969.<ref>Pike, Thomas F., Operations & Intelligence, III Corps Reporting: Tet 1969, 2016, {{ISBN|978-1-534-79903-5}}, pp 91-103.</ref>\n\n===Socialist Republic===\nLike most other areas of Vietnam, post-war Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a suffered a period of severe economic decline between 1975 and the second half of the 1980s. In part, because of its high concentration of former refugees and their descendants who had fled the [[communism|communist]] government of [[North Vietnam]] in the mid-1950s, Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a was the site of small-scale resistance to the communist government in the months immediately following [[fall of Saigon|the fall]] of the [[Republic of Vietnam]].\n\nIn the 1980s, the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam initiated the economic reform policy of [[Doi Moi|\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi]] {{Clarify|date=December 2011}} and Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a experienced an economic resurgence. Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a and the surrounding areas received large amounts of foreign investment capital, and the area rapidly industrialized. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n{{As of|2005}}, Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a is now an industrial center of southern Vietnam, and many factories and warehouses (often funded in collaboration with Japanese, Singaporean, American, Swiss and other foreign investors) operate in the area surrounding the city. [[Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a Sugar]] is located near the city.\n\nWith regard to entertainment, the city includes several [[amusement parks]], [[nightclub]]s and restaurants lining the [[\u0110\u1ed3ng Nai River]]. Construction has increased rapidly (with many Western-style houses and villas under development), and the real estate market has experienced a series of boom cycles since the mid-1990s. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nBi\u00ean H\u00f2a also is the location of the Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a Military Cemetery, a large national cemetery for fallen soldiers and military officials of the former [[Republic of Vietnam]] ([[ARVN]]). The cemetery today is now neglected by the current communist regime, and many sections of the cemetery are either vandalized, or demolished for the construction of various building projects. Most of the time there was no proper reburial for the skeletal remains, and this caused an outcry by [[overseas Vietnamese]], most of whom came from the South.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vietremains.org/blog/?p=152 |title=The Returning Casualty Blog \u00bb Bien Hoa Cemetery: The Last of Its Kind in Vietnam |publisher=Vietremains.org |date=2009-01-07 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}</ref> The Vietnamese America Foundation, and its program called \"The Returning Casualty\", are attempting to restore the cemetery and excavate a nearby mass grave.<ref name=martin>[http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2012/03/01/excavations-of-burial-sites-at-vietnamese-re-education-camps-by-the-returning-casualty/ Excavations of Burial Sites at Vietnamese Re-Education Camps by The Returning Casualty], Julie Martin, MSc in Forensic Archaeology and Anthropology candidate, Cranfield University UK, from south-eastasianarchaeology.com</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nBi\u00ean H\u00f2a is one of the central of industry in southern Vietnam.

It was an agricultural and fishing region.\n\nThe [[capture of Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a]] on December 16, 1861 was an important allied victory in the [[Cochinchina Campaign]] (1858\u201362). This campaign, fought between the French and the Spanish on the one side and the Vietnamese (under the [[Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty]]) on the other, began as a limited [[punitive expedition]] and ended as a French war of conquest. The war concluded with the establishment of the French colony of Cochinchina, a development that inaugurated nearly a century of French colonial dominance in Vietnam.\n\n===Republic of Vietnam===\nBi\u00ean H\u00f2a grew into a major suburb of Saigon as the capital city of the [[South Vietnam|Republic of (South) Vietnam]] grew. Following the [[First Indochina War]], tens of thousands of refugees from the northern and central regions of Vietnam&mdash;a large portion of whom were [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]]&mdash;resettled in Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a as part of [[Operation Passage to Freedom]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], the [[United States Air Force]] operated [[Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a Air Base]] near the city. [[Mortar (weapon)|Mortar]] attacks on U.S. and [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam|ARVN]] targets were frequently staged from residential districts in Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a. Two of the better-known attacks took place during T\u1ebft of 1968 as well as 1969.<ref>Pike, Thomas F., Operations & Intelligence, III Corps Reporting: Tet 1969, 2016, {{ISBN|978-1-534-79903-5}}, pp 91-103.</ref>\n\n===Socialist Republic===\nLike most other areas of Vietnam, post-war Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a suffered a period of severe economic decline between 1975 and the second half of the 1980s. In part, because of its high concentration of former refugees and their descendants who had fled the [[communism|communist]] government of [[North Vietnam]] in the mid-1950s, Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a was the site of small-scale resistance to the communist government in the months immediately following [[fall of Saigon|the fall]] of the [[Republic of Vietnam]].\n\nIn the 1980s, the government of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam initiated the economic reform policy of [[Doi Moi|\u0110\u1ed5i M\u1edbi]] {{Clarify|date=December 2011}} and Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a experienced an economic resurgence. Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a and the surrounding areas received large amounts of foreign investment capital, and the area rapidly industrialized. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n{{As of|2005}}, Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a is now an industrial center of southern Vietnam, and many factories and warehouses (often funded in collaboration with Japanese, Singaporean, American, Swiss and other foreign investors) operate in the area surrounding the city. [[Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a Sugar]] is located near the city.\n\nWith regard to entertainment, the city includes several [[amusement parks]], [[nightclub]]s and restaurants lining the [[\u0110\u1ed3ng Nai River]]. Construction has increased rapidly (with many Western-style houses and villas under development), and the real estate market has experienced a series of boom cycles since the mid-1990s. {{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nBi\u00ean H\u00f2a also is the location of the Bi\u00ean H\u00f2a Military Cemetery, a large national cemetery for fallen soldiers and military officials of the former [[Republic of Vietnam]] ([[ARVN]]). The cemetery today is now neglected by the current communist regime, and many sections of the cemetery are either vandalized, or demolished for the construction of various building projects. Most of the time there was no proper reburial for the skeletal remains, and this caused an outcry by [[overseas Vietnamese]], most of whom came from the South.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vietremains.org/blog/?p=152 |title=The Returning Casualty Blog \u00bb Bien Hoa Cemetery: The Last of Its Kind in Vietnam |publisher=Vietremains.org |date=2009-01-07 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}</ref> The Vietnamese America Foundation, and its program called \"The Returning Casualty\", are attempting to restore the cemetery and excavate a nearby mass grave.<ref name=martin>[http://www.southeastasianarchaeology.com/2012/03/01/excavations-of-burial-sites-at-vietnamese-re-education-camps-by-the-returning-casualty/ Excavations of Burial Sites at Vietnamese Re-Education Camps by The Returning Casualty], Julie Martin, MSc in Forensic Archaeology and Anthropology candidate, Cranfield University UK, from south-eastasianarchaeology.com</ref>\n\n==Economy==\nBi\u00ean H\u00f2a is one of the central of industry in southern Vietnam.

With [[Dunwich]], Walton Castle is one of the two principal sites claimed in the Middle Ages for the location of [[Dommoc]], the original bishop's seat of St Felix ([[Felix of Burgundy]]), first bishop of the East Angles, who arrived c. 630 AD in the reign of King [[Sigeberht of East Anglia]]. The see of Dommoc survived until the late ninth century.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\nAt the time of the [[Norman Conquest]], the manor of Walton was linked with that of Falkenham, a village overlooking the River Deben a little further inland. The fort area was then known as ''Burch'', a form of Burgh. In about 1170\u201380 [[Roger Bigod, 1st Earl of Norfolk]], invited the monks of [[Diocese of Rochester|Rochester]] to found Walton Priory,<ref>http://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/suff/vol2/pp80-81</ref> dedicated to St Felix, in the precinct of the Roman fort.\n\nDuring the twelfth century, the powerful Bigod family established an important manorial hall at Walton, which was successively rebuilt and enlarged over the next two centuries using material from the old castle and [[Caen stone]] from [[Normandy]] for ornamental windows and doors. Hugh Bigod also held a castle at Walton, but was obliged to surrender it to [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] in 1157. Henry then stationed a royal garrison there until 1173, when the rebel Earl of [[Leicester]] landed there to join the Bigods. The Bigod castle, according to the chronicler Diceto, had a high tower set up with very strong walls. Henry ordered its demolition in 1178. [[John of England|King John]] was staying at Walton Hall in 1200 when he ratified the original [[Town Charter]] of [[Ipswich]]. Large ruins of the old hall remained in the eighteenth century, and the last major portion of wall fell during a high storm in the 1880s. It stood near the Felixstowe cricket ground on Dellwood Avenue.\n\nDuring the thirteenth century, the place name Felixstowe first appears, which replaced that of Burch and became the name of the large settlement which has now largely engulfed the older Walton. In around 1317, probably because the Roman precinct was threatened by sea erosion, it became necessary to relocate Walton Priory to Abbey Meadow, behind the Walton parish church of St Mary. The parish church was then used as the conventual or priory church. The ruins of the second priory were still standing in the late 18th century, and the site was excavated by Dr Stanley West in around 1970. The parish church was largely rebuilt in the 19th century on the medieval ground-plan, including the tower unusually sited at the south-west end of the south aisle. It is a grade II* listed building.<ref>{{NHLE| num = 1182887| desc=  Church of St Mary|accessdate = 1 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe various Roman and medieval ruins of Walton were variously sketched and painted during the 18th century by [[Francis Grose]], Isaac Johnson and others.

Raghavendra is widely respected by everyone in the family and was responsible for bringing back their family to a good state after financial troubles a few years back where he also loses his love Padma, who got engaged but got cancelled by Padma's parents reject Raghavendra on the basis of poverty. Now, Raghavendra marries Anjali, who is a lot more responsible and kind to everyone. Vishnu is the second son in the family who assists Raghavendra in managing their provisional store. He is innocent and marries his relative Kalyani who is Padma's younger sister, but she is short-tempered and picks up quarrels often. Chinna is the third son in the family, and he goes to college where he falls for his classmate Kaveri. Kaveri is the only daughter of a rich arrogant man named Govardhan Chowdary. Vamsi is the youngest son and studies in college.\n\nKalyani feels that only Raghavendra is respected by everyone and not Vishnu because Raghavendra manages the provisional store, while Vishnu just assists him. She keeps insisting Vishnu to start a separate provisional store, which he does not accept as that would separate him from his brothers. Meanwhile, Govardhan gets to know about Kaveri's love towards Chinna and warns him to forget her. Chinna gets a job and leaves to Delhi as he does not want to marry Kaveri against her father's wishes.\n\nOne day, Kalyani begins a quarrel at home, saying that Raghavendra has a separate savings account in the bank and takes money from the account without the knowledge of other family members. Raghavendra feels bad upon hearing this. Suddenly, Kalyani and Vishnu's daughter faints and is rushed to the hospital. It is revealed that the child was suffering from a serious disease which only Raghavendra knew before, and he was saving money to meet out the medical expenses without informing others, as they will worry if they get to know about the child's disease. Kalyani realizes her mistake upon knowing this and apologizes to Raghavendra for her harsh behavior towards him and Anjali.\n\nLater, they start a rice mill. Raghavendra gets to know about Chinna's love towards Kaveri and goes to meet Govardhan with a marriage proposal. Govardhan agrees for the wedding but on a condition that Chinna should stay along with Kaveri in his home as he does not want to send his daughter to another home after wedding. Raghavendra agrees to the condition but does not inform this to Chinna as he will not agree. On the day of engagement, Chinna gets to know about the condition, cancels the wedding, and comes back to his home to meet his family members. Following him, Kaveri also comes, asking him to marry her against her father's wishes.\n\nRaghavendra convinces the couple that if they get married without Govardhan's permission, then it will be a big blow to Govardhan's status in society, and they should not be the reason behind that. He also convinces Kaveri to leave to her home immediately before anyone could know about this. When they step out of the home, they see Govardhan with a group of men to attack Raghavendra's family. However, he has overheard Raghavendra's conversation with Kaveri, realizes his good nature, and agrees for their wedding. Finally, Chinna and Kaveri get married happily, and Kaveri lives along with everyone in a joint family in Raghavendra's home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Daggubati Venkatesh|Venkatesh]] as Raghavendra\n* [[Meka Srikanth|Srikanth]] as Vishnu\n* [[Siva Balaji]] as Chinna\n* [[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]] as Anjali\n* [[Aarthi Agarwal]] as Padma\n* [[Sangeetha (actress)|Sangeetha]] as Kalyani\n* [[Rathi (actress)|Rathi]] as Kaveri\n* [[Sharwanand]] as Vamsi\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Govardhan Chowdary\n* [[Chandra Mohan (Telugu actor)|Chandra Mohan]] as Rama Chandraiah\n* [[Sharada (actress)|Sharada]] as Janakamma\n* [[Betha Sudhakar|Sudhakar]] as Anji\n* [[Tanikella Bharani]] as Rayudu\n* [[Amanchi Venkata Subrahmanyam|AVS]] as Supermarket Owner\n* [[Venu Madhav (actor)|Venu Madhav]] as Nalla Balu\n* [[Suman Setty]] as Thief\n* [[Tirupathi Prakash]] as Thief\n* [[Narsing Yadav]] as Police Officer\n* [[Raghunatha Reddy]] as Sheshagiri\n* [[Rallapalli (actor)|Rallapalli]] as Satya Murthy\n* [[Duvvasi Mohan]]\n* Malladi Raghava as Kavitha's father\n* Siva Parvathi as Padma's mother\n* Sri Harsha as Balaji\n* Chandra Mouli as Postman\n* Jahnavi as Kavitha\n* Dil Ramesh\n* Baby Srilekha as Shanthi\n* Master Tanish as Young Chinna\n* Master Manoj as Young Vamsi\n{{colend}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Sankranti\n| type       = film\n| artist     = [[S.

Raghavendra is widely respected by everyone in the family and was responsible for bringing back their family to a good state after financial troubles a few years back where he also loses his love Padma, who got engaged but got cancelled by Padma's parents reject Raghavendra on the basis of poverty. Now, Raghavendra gets married to Anjali, who is a lot more responsible and kind to everyone. Vishnu is the second son in the family who assists Raghavendra in managing their provisional store. He is innocent and gets married to his relative Kalyani who is Padma's younger sister, but she is short-tempered and picks up quarrels often. Chinna is the third son in the family, and he goes to college where he falls for his classmate Kaveri. Kaveri is the only daughter of a rich arrogant man named Govardhan Chowdary. Vamsi is the youngest son and studies in college.\n\nKalyani feels that only Raghavendra is respected by everyone and not Vishnu because Raghavendra manages the provisional store, while Vishnu just assists him. She keeps insisting Vishnu to start a separate provisional store, which he does not accept as that would separate him from his brothers. Meanwhile, Govardhan gets to know about Kaveri's love towards Chinna and warns him to forget her. Chinna gets a job and leaves to Delhi as he does not want to marry Kaveri against her father's wishes.\n\nOne day, Kalyani begins a quarrel at home, saying that Raghavendra has a separate savings account in the bank and takes money from the account without the knowledge of other family members. Raghavendra feels bad upon hearing this. Suddenly, Kalyani and Vishnu's daughter faints and is rushed to the hospital. It is revealed that the child was suffering from a serious disease which only Raghavendra knew before, and he was saving money to meet out the medical expenses without informing others, as they will worry if they get to know about the child's disease. Kalyani realizes her mistake upon knowing this and apologizes to Raghavendra for her harsh behavior towards him and Anjali.\n\nLater, they start a rice mill. Raghavendra gets to know about Chinna's love towards Kaveri and goes to meet Govardhan with a marriage proposal. Govardhan agrees for the wedding but on a condition that Chinna should stay along with Kaveri in his home as he does not want to send his daughter to another home after wedding. Raghavendra agrees to the condition but does not inform this to Chinna as he will not agree. On the day of engagement, Chinna gets to know about the condition, cancels the wedding, and comes back to his home to meet his family members. Following him, Kaveri also comes, asking him to marry her against her father's wishes.\n\nRaghavendra convinces the couple that if they get married without Govardhan's permission, then it will be a big blow to Govardhan's status in society, and they should not be the reason behind that. He also convinces Kaveri to leave to her home immediately before anyone could know about this. When they step out of the home, they see Govardhan with a group of men to attack Raghavendra's family. However, he has overheard Raghavendra's conversation with Kaveri, realizes his good nature, and agrees for their wedding. Finally, Chinna and Kaveri get married happily, and Kaveri lives along with everyone in a joint family in Raghavendra's home.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Daggubati Venkatesh|Venkatesh]] as Raghavendra\n* [[Meka Srikanth|Srikanth]] as Vishnu\n* [[Siva Balaji]] as Chinna\n* [[Sneha (actress)|Sneha]] as Anjali\n* [[Aarthi Agarwal]] as Padma\n* [[Sangeetha (actress)|Sangeetha]] as Kalyani\n* [[Rathi (actress)|Rathi]] as Kaveri\n* [[Sharwanand]] as Vamsi\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Govardhan Chowdary\n* [[Chandra Mohan (Telugu actor)|Chandra Mohan]] as Rama Chandraiah\n* [[Sharada (actress)|Sharada]] as Janakamma\n* [[Betha Sudhakar|Sudhakar]] as Anji\n* [[Tanikella Bharani]] as Rayudu\n* [[Amanchi Venkata Subrahmanyam|AVS]] as Supermarket Owner\n* [[Venu Madhav (actor)|Venu Madhav]] as Nalla Balu\n* [[Suman Setty]] as Thief\n* [[Tirupathi Prakash]] as Thief\n* [[Narsing Yadav]] as Police Officer\n* [[Raghunatha Reddy]] as Sheshagiri\n* [[Rallapalli (actor)|Rallapalli]] as Satya Murthy\n* [[Duvvasi Mohan]]\n* Malladi Raghava as Kavitha's father\n* Siva Parvathi as Padma's mother\n* Sri Harsha as Balaji\n* Chandra Mouli as Postman\n* Jahnavi as Kavitha\n* Dil Ramesh\n* Baby Srilekha as Shanthi\n* Master Tanish as Young Chinna\n* Master Manoj as Young Vamsi\n{{colend}}\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Sankranti\n| type       = film\n| artist     = [[S.
