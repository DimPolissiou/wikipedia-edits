Some have read this to mean that subsidies can be given only in states that have chosen to create their own healthcare exchanges, and do not use the federal exchange, while the Obama administration says that the wording applies to all states.

The species was named after 19-year-old botanist Fanny Searls. She was the first to collect a specimen of this species in 1871.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=McMohan and Hufford|first=|date=2004|title=Phylogeny of Amorpheae (Fabaceae : Papilionoideae)|url=|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=91|pages=1219-1230|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Phylogeny & Evolutionary History ===\nSearls\u2019 prairie clover belongs to the ''Dalea'' genus consisting of American prairie clovers.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> ''Dalea'' species are ''not'' true [[Clover|clovers]] (genus ''Trifolium'') and are only found in the [[Americas]]. While both genera belong to the [[Fabaceae]] family, they are not immediately related<ref name=\":3\" />.\n\n''Dalea'' belong to the tribe [[Amorpheae]]. The [[Biogeography|biogeographical]] history of Amorpheae has resulted in a pan-American distribution. Recent [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular analyses]] have revealed that the ''Dalea'' genus does not constitute a [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] [[clade]]. All ''Dalea'' species descended from a [[Common descent|common ancestor]], but members of the ''[[Marina (plant)|Marina]]'' (false prairie clovers) also fall into this clade. While ''Marina'' is a monophyletic group, it falls within the lineage of ''Dalea'', indicating the false prairie clovers are a diverged lineage within the prairie clovers. Hence, ''Marina'' and ''Dalea'' form a monophyletic lineage with ''[[Psorothamnus]]'' being the [[sister group]]. These three genera are collectively referred to as the Daleoids.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Distribution & Range==\n\n=== Geographical Distribution ===\nSearls\u2019 prairie clover is native to the southwestern United States. While the plant is rarer than many legume species, [[Metapopulation|metapopulations]] can be found in southeastern [[California]], [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], and [[Arizona]]. Little is known about their distribution south of [[Mexico\u2013United States border|US-Mexico border]]<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />. \n\n=== Habitat and Growing Conditions ===\n''D. searlsiae'' is typically found in [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|desert shrublands]] and forested [[Forest|woodlands]]. Among forested regions of the southwestern United States, it is abundant in [[pine]]-[[juniper]] forests and rarer in [[spruce]]-[[fir]] forests. They are capable of surviving in a wide variety of soil conditions ranging from [[clay]]-rich to [[Sand|sandy]] substrates to rocky flats<ref name=\":0\" />, however their biological fitness and yield declines in high clay<ref name=\":2\" />. They are most common in [[Limestone|lime]]-rich soils. ''D. searlsiae'', being an interior species, is found at [[Elevation|elevations]] ranging between 1000-2800m above sea level<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\n==Description==\n\n=== Life History & Morphology ===\nLike most ''Dalea'' species, Searls\u2019 prairie clover is a [[Perennial plant|perennial]] species due to its woody [[taproot]]. In spring, the plant regenerates numerous stems sourced from the taproot. Leaves are odd-pinnately [[Glossary of leaf morphology|compounded]] (consisting of typically 5 or 7 [[Leaflet (botany)|leaflets]], but can range from 3-11 depending on age and health), alternating, and [[deciduous]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Mature plants range from 25-60cm tall. [[Flower|Flowering]] occurs in early spring with seed production occurring by early July. The plant forms tiny [[Plant reproductive morphology|perfect flowers]] clustered in a cylindrical spike. Each flower/pod has five [[stamen]], two [[Ovule|ovules]] per [[Pod (botany)|pod]], and only one seed matures per pod.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Variation & Selection ==\n\n=== Genetic & Phenotypic Variability ===\nThe Searls\u2019 prairie clover is a [[Ploidy|diploid]] organism with 14 [[Chromosome|chromosomes]] (2n = 14)<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. \u00a0Both [[genetic drift]] and [[gene flow]] are determinants of the local [[Population genetics|population structures]] of Searls\u2019 prairie clover. The species shows significant population-dependent variability in [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] characteristics<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\n=== Local Adaptation ===\nPhenotypic traits of the species vary with population and geographic location as a result of genetic and environmental factors.<ref name=\":2\" /> The average number of stems per plant can range from 6-23, the number of inflorescences can range from 8-46, and the average height ranges between 21-43cm.<ref name=\":2\" /> Bhattarai et al. (2011) used [[Principal component analysis|principle component analysis]] to correlate [[genotype]] to [[phenotype]] and found evidence of some [[Locus (genetics)|genetic loci]] being predictive of phenotype. Local Searls\u2019 prairie clover populations have undergone [[Evolutionary pressure|selective pressures]] leading to [[Local adaptation|local adaptations]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe most of the [[ecology]] of Searls' prairie clover has been studied in relation to [[Symbiosis|symbioses]] and [[Herbivore|herbivory]].\n\n=== Rhizobial Symbiosis ===\nAs with most legumes, Searls\u2019 prairie clover forms symbiotic associations with [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[Rhizobia]] bacteria. This symbiosis improves soil [[nitrogen]] content and adds to the nutritional forage quality for herbivorous animals<ref name=\":0\" />. Commercial inoculant is available for ''D. searlsiae''<ref name=\":0\" />, but little research has been done to study the rhizobial-legume symbiosis of the species. \n\n=== Pollination ===\nWhile the species is capable of [[Self-pollination|self-pollinating]] in the absence of pollinators, it prefers to [[Pollination|cross-pollinate]] when possible. Pollination studies have shown self-pollination leads to a significantly reduced seed count with most seeds being inviable. Presence of Searls' prairie clover leads to a diverse pollinator [[community]] in the [[ecosystem]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Cane, Weber, and Miller|first=|date=2012|title=Breeding biologies, pollinators, and seed beetles of two prairie-clovers, Dalea ornata and Dalea searlsiae (Fabaceae: Amorpheae), from the intermountain West, USA|url=|journal=Western North American Naturalist|volume=72|pages=16-20|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Bee]] species are the primary pollinator of ''D. searlsiae''. Twenty-two species of native bees have been identified as main pollinators of Searls' prairie clover. These include species of potter bees (''[[Anthidium]] spp.''), bumblebees (''[[Bumblebee|Bombus]] spp.''), plaster bees (''[[Colletes]] spp.''), and long-horned bees (''[[Eucera]]'' and ''[[Melissodes]]'' ''spp''.). In addition, various species of [[Wasp|wasps]], [[Fly|flies]], and [[Butterfly|butterflies]] are also important non-bee pollinators.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Herbivory ===\nCompared to other legumes, Searls\u2019 prairie clover is a suitable herbivore food source as it lacks toxic compounds. [[Sheep|Domestic sheep]] have shown a preference for the species. Consumption of Searls\u2019 prairie clover has been shown to be an excellent nutrient source, consisting of 17-20% [[Protein (nutrient)|crude protein]], and is hypothesized to prevent [[bloating]]. As a result, [[overgrazing]] has led to a reduction in the range and distribution of Searls\u2019 prairie clover.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Fire Tolerance ===\nGiven its habitat, it is likely Searls\u2019 prairie clover has evolved mechanisms to survive [[Wildfire|fire stress]]. Plants with destroyed or damaged stems often regenerate stems that are capable of flowering later in the growing season. Furthermore, the species has been found to occur following [[Controlled burn|controlled burnings]] indicating tolerance to fire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Similar Species ==\nA newly identified species, ''[[Dalea janosensis]]'' collected from [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua, Mexico]] is morphologically similar to ''D. searlsiae''. Both species have rose-purple coloured flowers which can cause confusion. However, ''D. janosensis'' is significantly smaller than ''D. searlsiae'' with smaller leaves and non-deciduous bracts<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Estrada-C, Villarreal-Q, and Vega-M|first=|date=2014|title=A new species of Dalea series Compactae (Leguminosae: Amorpheae) from northwestern Chihuahua, Mexico|url=|journal=Brittonia|volume=66|pages=151-155|via=}}</ref>. \n\nWhen not flowering, ''D. searlsiae'' can be confused with ''[[Dalea cylindriceps|D. cylindriceps]]'', ''[[Dalea ornata|D. ornata]]'', and ''[[Dalea flavescens|D. flavescens]]''. However, flower colour can easily distinguish these species. Other morphological characteristics are often unreliable if used to distinguish these species due to [[phenotypic plasticity]]<ref name=\":5\" />.\n\n== Rangeland Restoration and Revegetation ==\nLegume species are in high demand for [[Revegetation|land revegetation]] and [[Land restoration|restoration]] efforts due to their symbiosis with [[Rhizobia|nitrogen-fixing Rhizobia]] bacteria. The presence of legumes alongside their rhizobial symbionts is desired in restoration, revegetation, and reclamation efforts to improve soil nutrient characteristics. However, the availability of these crops for these projects are limited due to the lack of cultivation. In 2011, Bhattarai and Bushman proposed the use of Searls' prairie clover in rangeland reclamation in the southwestern USA.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSearls\u2019 prairie clover is recommended for restoration and revegetation in regions attaining 152-356mm in [[Precipitation|annual precipitation]]. The rationale for using ''D. searlsiae'' in restoration projects is attributed to its rehabilitation of soil nutrient conditions and attraction of pollinators.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n=== Cultivation and Establishment of Seeds ===\nThree phenotypic/genetic [[Germplasm|germplasms]] identified by Bhattarai et al. (2011) are used in land revegetation and restoration efforts.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Johnson, Bushman, Connors, Bhattarai, Jones, Jensen, Parr, and Eldredge|first=|date=2015|title=Notice of release of Fanny Germplasm, Carmel Germplasm, and Bonneville Germplasm Searls\u2019 prairie clover: selected class of natural germplasm|url=|journal=Native Plants Journal|volume=16|pages=265-275|via=}}</ref> The \u2018Fanny\u2019 germplasm originates from seeds found at Patterson Pass in east-central [[Nevada]] and is recommended for [[USDA plant hardiness zone]] 5b. The \u2018Carmel\u2019 germplasm originates from the [[Colorado Plateau]] of south-central [[Utah]] and is recommended for USDA plant hardiness zone 7a. The Bonneville germplasm was sourced from NW Utah near the Nevada border in USDA plant hardiness zone 6b. However, the Bonneville germplasm was found to be a genetically distinct population and is recommended for use in northwestern Utah. Local germplasms are recommended to prevent outbreeding depression.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\" /> \n\nThe three germplasms were made available by the [[Agricultural Research Service|USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service]] for revegetation and restoration efforts. In 2015, researchers collected seeds from the regions identified by Bhattarai et al. (2011), created germplasms for future cultivation, and verified the genotype of each germplasm through genetic testing.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nPlanting seeds for these efforts requires pre-treatments. Allowing seeds to overwinter after planting in fall is an effective method. However, many projects use a 5-minute treatment with 98% [[sulfuric acid]] to increase germination success.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe species can grow well without irrigation.

The species forms symbiotic relationships with [[nitrogen-fixing bacteria]] that can improve soil nutrient levels. Its large [[inflorescence]] attracts many species of [[Pollinator|pollinators]], and it lacks [[Toxin|toxins]] found in similar legume species. \u00a0As a result, the species has been considered for use in [[rangeland]] [[Land restoration|restoration]] and [[revegetation]] projects.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bushman, Johnson, Connors, and Jones|first=|date=2015|title=Germination and Seedling Emergence of Three Semiarid Western North American Legumes.|url=|journal=Rangeland Ecology and Management|volume=68|pages=501-506|via=}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Gucker and Shaw|first=|title=Western Forbs: Biology, Ecology, and Use in Restoration.

The species was named after 19-year-old botanist Fanny Searls. She was the first to collect a specimen of this species in 1871.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=McMohan and Hufford|first=|date=2004|title=Phylogeny of Amorpheae (Fabaceae : Papilionoideae)|url=|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=91|pages=1219-1230|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Phylogeny & Evolutionary History ===\nSearls\u2019 prairie clover belongs to the ''Dalea'' genus consisting of American prairie clovers.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> ''Dalea'' species are ''not'' true [[Clover|clovers]] (genus ''Trifolium'') and are only found in the [[Americas]]. While both genera belong to the [[Fabaceae]] family, they are not immediately related<ref name=\":3\" />.\n\n''Dalea'' belong to the tribe [[Amorpheae]]. The [[Biogeography|biogeographical]] history of Amorpheae has resulted in a pan-American distribution. Recent [[Molecular phylogenetics|molecular analyses]] have revealed that the ''Dalea'' genus does not constitute a [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] [[clade]]. All ''Dalea'' species descended from a [[Common descent|common ancestor]], but members of the ''[[Marina (plant)|Marina]]'' (false prairie clovers) also fall into this clade. While ''Marina'' is a monophyletic group, it falls within the lineage of ''Dalea'', indicating the false prairie clovers are a diverged lineage within the prairie clovers. Hence, ''Marina'' and ''Dalea'' form a monophyletic lineage with ''[[Psorothamnus]]'' being the [[sister group]]. These three genera are collectively referred to as the Daleoids.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==Distribution & Range==\n\n=== Geographical Distribution ===\nSearls\u2019 prairie clover is native to the southwestern United States. While the plant is rarer than many legume species, [[Metapopulation|metapopulations]] can be found in southeastern [[California]], [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], and [[Arizona]]. Little is known about their distribution south of [[Mexico\u2013United States border|US-Mexico border]]<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" />. \n\n=== Habitat and Growing Conditions ===\n''D. searlsiae'' is typically found in [[Deserts and xeric shrublands|desert shrublands]] and forested [[Forest|woodlands]]. Among forested regions of the southwestern United States, it is abundant in [[pine]]-[[juniper]] forests and rarer in [[spruce]]-[[fir]] forests. They are capable of surviving in a wide variety of soil conditions ranging from [[clay]]-rich to [[Sand|sandy]] substrates to rocky flats<ref name=\":0\" />, however their biological fitness and yield declines in high clay<ref name=\":2\" />. They are most common in [[Limestone|lime]]-rich soils. ''D. searlsiae'', being an interior species, is found at [[Elevation|elevations]] ranging between 1000-2800m above sea level<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\n==Description==\n\n=== Life History & Morphology ===\nLike most ''Dalea'' species, Searls\u2019 prairie clover is a [[Perennial plant|perennial]] species due to its woody [[taproot]]. In spring, the plant regenerates numerous stems sourced from the taproot. Leaves are odd-pinnately [[Glossary of leaf morphology|compounded]] (consisting of typically 5 or 7 [[Leaflet (botany)|leaflets]], but can range from 3-11 depending on age and health), alternating, and [[deciduous]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> Mature plants range from 25-60cm tall. [[Flower|Flowering]] occurs in early spring with seed production occurring by early July. The plant forms tiny [[Plant reproductive morphology|perfect flowers]] clustered in a cylindrical spike. Each flower/pod has five [[stamen]], two [[Ovule|ovules]] per [[Pod (botany)|pod]], and only one seed matures per pod.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Variation & Selection ==\n\n=== Genetic & Phenotypic Variability ===\nThe Searls\u2019 prairie clover is a [[Ploidy|diploid]] organism with 14 [[Chromosome|chromosomes]] (2n = 14)<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. \u00a0Both [[genetic drift]] and [[gene flow]] are determinants of the local [[Population genetics|population structures]] of Searls\u2019 prairie clover. The species shows significant population-dependent variability in [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] characteristics<ref name=\":0\" />. \n\n=== Local Adaptation ===\nPhenotypic traits of the species vary with population and geographic location as a result of genetic and environmental factors.<ref name=\":2\" /> The average number of stems per plant can range from 6-23, the number of inflorescences can range from 8-46, and the average height ranges between 21-43cm.<ref name=\":2\" /> Bhattarai et al. (2011) used [[Principal component analysis|principle component analysis]] to correlate [[genotype]] to [[phenotype]] and found evidence of some [[Locus (genetics)|genetic loci]] being predictive of phenotype. Local Searls\u2019 prairie clover populations have undergone [[Evolutionary pressure|selective pressures]] leading to [[Local adaptation|local adaptations]].<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Ecology ==\nThe most of the [[ecology]] of Searls' prairie clover has been studied in relation to [[Symbiosis|symbioses]] and [[Herbivore|herbivory]].\n\n=== Rhizobial Symbiosis ===\nAs with most legumes, Searls\u2019 prairie clover forms symbiotic associations with [[Nitrogen fixation|nitrogen-fixing]] [[Rhizobia]] bacteria. This symbiosis improves soil [[nitrogen]] content and adds to the nutritional forage quality for herbivorous animals<ref name=\":0\" />. Commercial inoculant is available for ''D. searlsiae''<ref name=\":0\" />, but little research has been done to study the rhizobial-legume symbiosis of the species. \n\n=== Pollination ===\nWhile the species is capable of [[Self-pollination|self-pollinating]] in the absence of pollinators, it prefers to [[Pollination|cross-pollinate]] when possible. Pollination studies have shown self-pollination leads to a significantly reduced seed count with most seeds being inviable. Presence of Searls' prairie clover leads to a diverse pollinator [[community]] in the [[ecosystem]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Cane, Weber, and Miller|first=|date=2012|title=Breeding biologies, pollinators, and seed beetles of two prairie-clovers, Dalea ornata and Dalea searlsiae (Fabaceae: Amorpheae), from the intermountain West, USA|url=|journal=Western North American Naturalist|volume=72|pages=16-20|via=}}</ref>\n\n[[Bee]] species are the primary pollinator of ''D. searlsiae''. Twenty-two species of native bees have been identified as main pollinators of Searls' prairie clover. These include species of potter bees (''[[Anthidium]] spp.''), bumblebees (''[[Bumblebee|Bombus]] spp.''), plaster bees (''[[Colletes]] spp.''), and long-horned bees (''[[Eucera]]'' and ''[[Melissodes]]'' ''spp''.). In addition, various species of [[Wasp|wasps]], [[Fly|flies]], and [[Butterfly|butterflies]] are also important non-bee pollinators.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Herbivory ===\nCompared to other legumes, Searls\u2019 prairie clover is a suitable herbivore food source as it lacks toxic compounds. [[Sheep|Domestic sheep]] have shown a preference for the species. Consumption of Searls\u2019 prairie clover has been shown to be an excellent nutrient source, consisting of 17-20% [[Protein (nutrient)|crude protein]], and is hypothesized to prevent [[bloating]]. As a result, [[overgrazing]] has led to a reduction in the range and distribution of Searls\u2019 prairie clover.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\n=== Fire Tolerance ===\nGiven its habitat, it is likely Searls\u2019 prairie clover has evolved mechanisms to survive [[Wildfire|fire stress]]. Plants with destroyed or damaged stems often regenerate stems that are capable of flowering later in the growing season. Furthermore, the species has been found to occur following [[Controlled burn|controlled burnings]] indicating tolerance to fire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Similar Species ==\nA newly identified species, ''[[Dalea janosensis]]'' collected from [[Chihuahua, Mexico]] is morphologically similar to ''D. searlsiae''. Both species have rose-purple coloured flowers which can cause confusion. However, ''D. janosensis'' is significantly smaller than ''D. searlsiae'' with smaller leaves and non-deciduous bracts<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Estrada-C, Villarreal-Q, and Vega-M|first=|date=2014|title=A new species of Dalea series Compactae (Leguminosae: Amorpheae) from northwestern Chihuahua, Mexico|url=|journal=Brittonia|volume=66|pages=151-155|via=}}</ref>. \n\nWhen not flowering, ''D. searlsiae'' can be confused with ''[[Dalea cylindriceps|D. cylindriceps]]'', ''[[Dalea ornata|D. ornata]]'', and ''[[Dalea flavescens|D. flavescens]]''. However, flower colour can easily distinguish these species. Other morphological characteristics are often unreliable if used to distinguish these species due to [[phenotypic plasticity]]<ref name=\":5\" />.\n\n== Rangeland Restoration and Revegetation ==\nLegume species are in high demand for [[Revegetation|land revegetation]] and [[Land restoration|restoration]] efforts due to their symbiosis with [[Rhizobia|nitrogen-fixing Rhizobia]] bacteria. The presence of legumes alongside their rhizobial symbionts is desired in restoration, revegetation, and reclamation efforts to improve soil nutrient characteristics. However, the availability of these crops for these projects are limited due to the lack of cultivation. In 2011, Bhattarai and Bushman proposed the use of Searls' prairie clover in rangeland reclamation in the southwestern USA.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nSearls\u2019 prairie clover is recommended for restoration and revegetation in regions attaining 152-356mm in [[Precipitation|annual precipitation]]. The rationale for using ''D. searlsiae'' in restoration projects is attributed to its rehabilitation of soil nutrient conditions and attraction of pollinators.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n=== Cultivation and Establishment of Seeds ===\nThree phenotypic/genetic [[Germplasm|germplasms]] identified by Bhattarai et al. (2011) are used in land revegetation and restoration efforts.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\">{{Cite journal|last=Johnson, Bushman, Connors, Bhattarai, Jones, Jensen, Parr, and Eldredge|first=|date=2015|title=Notice of release of Fanny Germplasm, Carmel Germplasm, and Bonneville Germplasm Searls\u2019 prairie clover: selected class of natural germplasm|url=|journal=Native Plants Journal|volume=16|pages=265-275|via=}}</ref> The \u2018Fanny\u2019 germplasm originates from seeds found at Patterson Pass in east-central [[Nevada]] and is recommended for [[USDA plant hardiness zone]] 5b. The \u2018Carmel\u2019 germplasm originates from the [[Colorado Plateau]] of south-central [[Utah]] and is recommended for USDA plant hardiness zone 7a. The Bonneville germplasm was sourced from NW Utah near the Nevada border in USDA plant hardiness zone 6b. However, the Bonneville germplasm was found to be a genetically distinct population and is recommended for use in northwestern Utah. Local germplasms are recommended to prevent outbreeding depression.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":6\" /> \n\nThe three germplasms were made available by the [[Agricultural Research Service|USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service]] for revegetation and restoration efforts. In 2015, researchers collected seeds from the regions identified by Bhattarai et al. (2011), created germplasms for future cultivation, and verified the genotype of each germplasm through genetic testing.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nPlanting seeds for these efforts requires pre-treatments. Allowing seeds to overwinter after planting in fall is an effective method. However, many projects use a 5-minute treatment with 98% [[sulfuric acid]] to increase germination success.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe species can grow well without irrigation.
