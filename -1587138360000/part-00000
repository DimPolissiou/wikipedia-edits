The university's iconic buildings act as symbols of wider Aberdeen, particularly Marischal College in the city centre and the [[crown steeple]] of King's College in [[Old Aberdeen]]. There are two campuses; the predominantly utilised King's College campus dominates the section of the city known as [[Old Aberdeen]], which is approximately two miles north of the city centre. Although the original site of the university's foundation, most academic buildings apart from the King's College Chapel and Quadrangle were constructed in the 20th century during a period of significant expansion. The university's [[Foresterhill]] campus is next to [[Aberdeen Royal Infirmary]] and houses the [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine and Dentistry|School of Medicine and Dentistry]] as well as the School of Medical Sciences. Together these buildings comprise one of Europe's largest health campuses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-aberdeen/courses/medicine|title=Medicine - University of Aberdeen|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en}}</ref> The annual income of the institution for 2017\u201318 was \u00a3219.5&nbsp;million of which \u00a356.1&nbsp;million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of \u00a3226.8&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"accounts\"/>\n\nAberdeen has {{HESA student population|INSTID=0170}} students from undergraduate to doctoral level (as of {{HESA year}}), including many international students. An abundant range of disciplines are taught at the university, with 650 undergraduate degree programmes offered in the 2012\u201313 academic year. Many important figures in the field of divinity were educated at the university, particularly in its earlier history, giving rise to the [[Aberdeen doctors]] in the 17th century, and the prolific [[Scottish Enlightenment|enlightenment]] philosopher [[Thomas Reid]] during the [[Scottish Enlightenment|Scottish Enlightenment.]] [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation#University of Aberdeen|Five Nobel laureates]] have since been associated with the university.<ref name=FastFacts>{{cite web |url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/fast-facts.php |title=Fast Facts | publisher=University of Aberdeen |accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{for|history pre-1860|King's College, Aberdeen|Marischal College}}\n\n===King's and Marischal Colleges===\n[[File:King's College, Aberdeen (4315559621).jpg|alt=|thumb|King's College, Aberdeen.]]\nThere appears to have existed in Old Aberdeen, from a very early period, a ''Studium Generate,'' or University, attached to the Episcopal Chapter of the See of Aberdeen. It is said to have been founded in 1157 by Edward, Bishop of Aberdeen, and although, according to Boece, it still existed at the period when King's College was founded, it is probable that it had in some way ceased to answer the purposes which it must have been designed to serve, since King James IV., in his letter to Pope Alexander VI., requesting him to found a University in Old Aberdeen, mentions as the chief motive for the undertaking, the profound ignorance of the inhabitants of the north of Scotland, and the great deficiency of properly educated men to fill the clerical office in that part of his kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gregory|first=William|title=The New Statistical Account of Scotland (1845)|publisher=|year=1845|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe first university in Aberdeen, [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]], formally '''The University and King's College of Aberdeen (Collegium Regium Abredonense)''', was founded on 10th February 1494 by [[William Elphinstone]], [[Bishop of Aberdeen]], [[Chancellor]] of Scotland, and a graduate of the [[University of Glasgow]] drafting a request on behalf of [[James IV of Scotland|King James IV]] to [[Pope Alexander VI]] resulting in a [[Papal Bull]] being issued.<ref name=\"foundation\" /> It seems that James was keen to ensure that Scotland had as many universities as England at the time, and it was to possess all the privileges enjoyed by those of Paris and [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], two of the most highly favoured in Europe. The university, modelled on that of the [[University of Paris]] and intended principally as a [[law school]], soon became the most famous and popular of the Scots seats of learning, largely due to the prestige of Elphinstone and his friend, [[Hector Boece]], the first principal appointed in 1500. Its aim was to train doctors, teachers and clergy who would serve the communities of northern Scotland, as well as lawyers and administrators for the Scottish Crown. It was a collegiate foundation with 36 full-time staff and students and walls protecting it from the outside world. In 1497 the College established the first [[Regius Professor|chair of medicine]] in the English-speaking world. \n\nFollowing the [[Scottish Reformation]] in 1560, King's College was purged of its Roman Catholic staff but in other respects was largely resistant to change. [[George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal|George Keith]], the fifth [[Earl Marischal]] was a moderniser within the college and supportive of the reforming ideas of [[Peter Ramus]] and [[Andrew Melville]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/noblecollege/building.htm |title=This Noble College: Building on the European tradition |publisher=University of Aberdeen |accessdate=20 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508105123/http://www.abdn.ac.uk/noblecollege/building.htm |archivedate=8 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In April 1593 he founded a second university in the city, [[Marischal College]]. It is also possible the founding of another college in nearby [[Fraserburgh]] by Sir Alexander Fraser, a business rival of Keith, was instrumental in its creation. Aberdeen was highly unusual at this time for having two universities in one city: as 20th-century University prospectuses observed, Aberdeen had the same number as existed in England at the time (the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]]).\n[[File:Kings College, Aberdeen about 1661. Wellcome M0008087.jpg|alt=|thumb|An illustration of King's College in 1661.]]\nInitially, Marischal College offered the Principal of King's College a role in selecting its academics, but this was refused - the first blow in a developing rivalry. Marischal College, in the commercial heart of the city (rather than the ancient but much smaller collegiate enclave of Old Aberdeen), was quite different in nature and outlook. For example, it was more integrated into the life of the city, such as allowing students to live outwith the College. The two rival colleges often clashed, sometimes in court, but also in brawls between students on the streets of Aberdeen. [[Duncan Liddel|Duncan Liddell]] endowed the first chair in mathematics at Marischal in 1613, but the first professor wasn't appointed until 1626.\n\nAs the institutions put aside their differences, a process of attempted (but unsuccessful) mergers began in the 17th century. During this time, both colleges made notable intellectual contributions to the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. Both colleges supported the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rebellion and following the defeat of the [[1715 rising]] were largely purged by the authorities of their academics and officials.\n\n===King Charles' University (1641-61) and the merger of the two Colleges (1860)===\n[[File:Marischal College, Aberdeen - geograph.org.uk - 1548676.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Marischal College]]\nThe nearest the two colleges had come to full union was as the \"Caroline University of Aberdeen\", a merger initiated by [[Charles I of England|Charles I of Scotland]] in 1641, which united the two colleges for twenty years. Following the civil conflicts of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], a more complete unification was attempted following the ratification of Parliament by [[Oliver Cromwell]] during the [[English Interregnum|interregnum]] in 1654. This united university survived until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] whereby all laws made during this period were rescinded by [[Charles II of Scotland|Charles II]] and the two colleges reverted to independent status.<ref name=\"electricscotland.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/statistical/kings.htm |title=The New Statistical Account of Scotland - Account of the University and King's College of Aberdeen |publisher=Electricscotland.com |accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> Charles I is still recognised as one of the university's founders, due to his part in creating the Caroline University and his benevolence towards King's College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mediareleases/archive/2004/pr1311.hti |publisher=Public Relations, University of Aberdeen, pubrel@abdn.ac.uk |title=Founders' Day Service |date=9 November 2004 |accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> Further unsuccessful suggestions for union were brought about throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries.<ref name=\"electricscotland.com\" /> The evolving examination system now required much higher academic standards from the students. The two colleges in Aberdeen merged on 15 September 1860 in accordance with the [[Universities (Scotland) Act 1858]], which also created a new medical school at Marischal College. The 1858 [[Act of Parliament]] stated the \"''united University shall take rank among the Universities of Scotland as from the date of erection of King's College and University.''\" The university is thus Scotland's third oldest and the United Kingdom's fifth oldest University.\n\n===The modern university===\nThe relationship of the two ex-college campuses has changed over the years. While at the time of unification each had approximately equal numbers of students, buildings at Marischal College began to be expanded in the late-19th century with a significant rebuilding effort completed in 1906. In the 20th century, the university expanded greatly, particularly at King's College. New buildings were constructed on the land around King's College throughout the 20th century. Initially, these were built to match the ancient buildings (e.g. the New King's lecture rooms and Elphinstone Hall), but later ones from the 1960s onward were constructed in [[Brutalism|brutalist]] style. Meanwhile, the Foresterhill campus began to train medical students in the 1930s next to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\n[[File:Sir Duncan Rice Library 2018-04-21.jpg|alt=|thumb|192x192px|Fa\u00e7ade of the Sir Duncan Rice Library in Old Aberdeen]]\nDuring the mid-20th century departments which had been at Marischal College moved into one of these new buildings (most at King's College) and by the late 20th-century Marischal College had been abandoned by all but the Anatomy Department, a graduation hall and the Marischal Museum ([[Marischal College]] has now been restored as the headquarters of Aberdeen City Council, which is leasing a portion of the complex from the university). Following extensive fundraising, a \u00a357 million new university library (the [[Sir Duncan Rice Library]]) opened in autumn 2011 at the King's College campus to replace the outgrown Queen Mother Library<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/library/about/main/|title=The Sir Duncan Rice Library |publisher=University of Aberdeen |accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref> and was officially opened by the Queen in September 2012.<ref name=\"Queen New Library\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19707174|title=Queen opens new library at Aberdeen University|publisher=BBC News|date=24 September 2012 |accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref> Today, most students spend most of their time in modern buildings which provide up-to-date facilities for teaching, research and other activities such as dining. However, the old buildings at King's College are still in use as lecture and tutorial rooms and accommodation for various academic departments.\n\nIn February 2020, the [[Scottish Funding Council]] (SFC) found that in approving a financial settlement agreement with the former Principal [[Ian Diamond|Professor Sir Ian Diamond]], the university failed to make best use of public funds or exercise good governance. As a result of the investigation, the university was ordered to repay \u00a3119,000 of grant finance to the SFC and undertake an externally-facilitated examination of its governance and culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/aberdeen-told-repay-ps119k-over-ex-heads-gardening-leave|title=Aberdeen told to repay \u00a3119K over ex-head\u2019s \u2018gardening leave\u2019|last=Grove|first=Jack|date=18 February 2020|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Campuses==\nThe original buildings of both colleges which united to form the university are much admired architectural features of Aberdeen. The main campus is now at King's College, where the original buildings are still in use in addition to many newer buildings of largely [[modernist]] style. A second campus at [[Foresterhill]] houses the [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine|School of Medicine, Medical Science & Nutrition]].<ref name=\"estates\"/> In addition, there are smaller facilities at other sites such as the [[Royal Cornhill Hospital]] to the west of the city centre, and the [[Rowett Research Institute|Rowett Institute]] in [[Bucksburn]].\n\n===King's College===\n{{See also|King's College, Aberdeen}}\n[[File:AberdeenKingsCollegeChapel 2013-08.jpg|alt=|thumb|King's College quad|left]]\nThe King's College campus covers an area of some 35 hectares around the ancient [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]] buildings and the High Street. It hosts around two-thirds of the university's built estate and most student facilities, and lies 2 miles north of [[Aberdeen]] city centre.<ref name=\"estates\"/> The university does not own all the buildings on the \"campus\" which also include private houses, shops and businesses (although many of these rely heavily on custom from the university community) and it is best thought of as a district of the city dominated by the university. It can be reached from the city centre by bus routes 1, 2, 13, 19 and 20 operated by [[First Aberdeen]] and from northern Aberdeenshire or the bus station at Union Square by various routes operated by [[Stagecoach Bluebird]].\n[[File:New King's, Old Aberdeen. - geograph.org.uk - 115911.jpg|alt=|thumb|New Building, King's College (\"New Kings\")]]\nThe historic King's College buildings form a [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] with interior court, two sides of which have been rebuilt and expanded with a library wing in the 19th century. The Crown Tower and the Chapel, the oldest parts, date from around 1500. The original foundation contained the Chapel, the Great Hall and living accommodation, with its own kitchen and brewery, a well in the quadrangle, and a college garden to provide herbs and vegetables. The Grammar School was just outside the walls, in front of the College. The Crown Tower is surmounted by a structure about 40&nbsp;ft (12 m) high, consisting of a six-sided lantern and Imperial crown, both sculptured, and resting on the intersections of two arched ornamental slips rising from the four corners of the top of the tower. This crown, also known as the \"Crown of Kings\", frequently acts as a symbol of the university. The [[choir]] of the chapel contains original oak-canopied stalls, miserere seats, and lofty open screens in the French flamboyant style. They were preserved by the college's Principal during the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], who fought off local barons who had attacked the nearby [[St Machar's Cathedral]].  The Cromwell Tower, created between 1658-1662 opposite the Crown Tower, was originally built as residential accommodation, but an observatory was built on top in 1826.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/nph120/astro/cto/histcrom.htm|title=History of the Cromwell Tower Observatory|last=|first=|date=|website=Aberdeen University History|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The library wing was converted into an exhibition and conference venue in the 1990s and today also houses the university's Business School.\nThe first of the modern age of construction in the King's campus began with the construction in 1913 of the New Building (now known as ''\"New King's\"''), largely in a similar architectural style to the old buildings. New King's groups to form a yet larger quadrangle-like green for the campus also bordered by the High Street, King's and [[Elphinstone Hall]], a traditional 1930 replacement for the Great Hall. The Elphinstone Hall was subsequently used as a dining facility but is now used for graduations, examinations, fairs, and other large university events.\n\nHowever, most students and staff spend relatively little time in these historic buildings, with a large number of modern ones housing most facilities and academic departments. Most date from the second half of the 20th century. Some of these echo the existing architecture of [[Old Aberdeen]], such as the Fraser Noble Building with its distinctive concrete crown designed to resemble the one adorning King's College. Other buildings were constructed of stone in the 1950s (e.g. the Taylor Building and Meston Building). A number of other buildings are designed in the [[Brutalism|brutalist style]], such as the Arts Lecture Theatre and adjoining William Guild Building, opened in 1969 to house the School of Psychology. Also on the site is the [[Cruickshank Botanic Garden]] which was presented to the university in 1899 and is open to the public.\n\n[[File:Aberdeen University Library interior atrium, Aberdeen, Scotland, UK.JPG|thumb|Atrium of the main Sir Duncan Rice Library at King's College campus, looking up]]The most recent building on campus is the Sir Duncan Rice Library, completed in 2011 and designed by Danish architects [[Schmidt Hammer Lassen]]. It was officially opened by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in September 2012 and named after [[Duncan Rice]], a previous Principal of the university.<ref name=\"Queen New Library\" /> This seven-storey tower, clad in zebra-like jagged stripes of white and clear glass, replaced the smaller Queen Mother Library as the university's main library and can be seen prominently from the entire campus and much of the city. It is open to the public and outstanding views of the city and coastline are available from the upper floors. In addition to expanded facilities it also houses public exhibition space and the university's historic collections, comprising more than a quarter of a million ancient and priceless books and manuscripts collected over five centuries since the university's foundations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mediareleases/release.php?id=530|publisher=University of Aberdeen|accessdate=13 August 2009|title=Press Release: 'Flagship library project to match academic ambitions' leads next phase of University\u2019s infrastructure investment}}</ref> Other libraries are in the Taylor Building on the same campus (for law books and materials) and at Foresterhill (for medicine and medical sciences). The university's library service (i.e. including all libraries) holds over one million books.\n\n===Marischal College===\n{{See also|Marischal College}}\n[[File:Marischal College - panoramio (1).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Marischal College (following restoration in 2011)]]\n[[Marischal College]] is a [[neo-Gothic]] building, having been rebuilt in 1836\u201341, and greatly extended several years later. Formerly an open three-sided court, the college now forms a quadrangle as additions to the buildings were opened by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] in 1906 and form the current facade from Broad Street. The building is widely considered to be one of the best examples of neo-Gothic [[architecture]] in Great Britain; the architect, [[Alexander Marshall Mackenzie]] was a native of Aberdeen as well as an alumnus of the university. The Mitchell Tower at the rear is named for the benefactor (Dr [[Charles Mitchell (shipbuilder)|Charles Mitchell]]) who paid for the graduation hall. The opening of this tower in 1895 was part of celebrations of the 400th anniversary of the university.\n\nUntil 1996, Marischal College housed the Departments of Molecular & Cell Biology and Biomedical Sciences, which had been there for many decades. From 1996, the departments moved to Kings College campus and Foresterhill campus.  Teaching no longer takes place at Marischal College, with many of the departments formerly based there having moved to King's College some decades previously. While graduations and other events (e.g. concerts) took place in the cathedral-like Mitchell Hall in the north wing, for many years much of the building (including the frontage to the street) was derelict. A restoration project was completed in 2011 and restored the building and its ornamentation. The Broad Street frontage is now on long-term lease to [[Aberdeen City Council]] and forms the administrative headquarters for the city, replacing the ageing St. Nicholas House across the street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abdn.ac.uk/about/campus/marischal-college-394.php|title=Marischal College {{!}} About {{!}} The University of Aberdeen|website=www.abdn.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref> The project provided modernized public facilities and office accommodation for the Council as well as cosmetic rejuvenation, and involved the demolition and reconstruction of internal spaces while retaining and restoring the outer walls and windows. The university controls the north wing of the building containing the Marischal Museum and Mitchell Hall which was used in the past for graduation and other academic ceremonies.<ref name=\"estates\"/> Graduations take place at [[Elphinstone Hall]] at King's College.\n\n===Other campuses===\n====Doha, Qatar====\nA new state of the art campus has been established in Doha, Qatar since May 2017. They have expanded their School of Business to Qatar. The courses currently offered are Accounting & finance and Business Management. The first batch started on 10 September 2017.\nThe university requirements are the same as those in the Kings College Campus which are A<sup>*</sup>ABB to AAAB. These students will be the first ones to graduate at a campus abroad.\nThe current dean of the college is Brian Buckley. The Provost is Dr Karen Foster.\n\n[[File:Kingscollegeaberdeen2.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to King's College Quadrangle]]\n\n====Foresterhill====\nThe Foresterhill site contains the university's [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine|School of Medicine, Medical Science & Nutrition]], Medical Library and associated modern buildings for teaching and research. The School includes the Rowett Institute of Nutrition, the Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Applied Health Sciences, Institute of Dentistry, and Institute of Education for Medical & Dental Sciences. It is at Foresterhill, in Aberdeen's West End. It became part of the university's holdings in 1938 following the move of the Medical School and forms part of a modern teaching hospital complex alongside the [[Aberdeen Royal Infirmary]]. The 41 hectare site is split between the university (owning around a third) and [[NHS Scotland|NHS Grampian]].<ref name=\"estates\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/estates/strategy.shtml|publisher=University Estates Office|accessdate=13 August 2009|title=Estate Strategy 2002-2007}}</ref>\n\n====Hilton====\nA small campus at Hilton became part of the university estate following a merger in 2001 between the university and the Aberdeen campus of the Northern College, and temporarily became home to the university's Faculty of Education.

This gives the university a tripartite constitution comprising the [[General Council (Scottish university)|General Council]] of senior academics and graduates, the [[University Court]] responsible for finances and administration, and the [[Academic Senate]] (''Senatus Academicus'')--the university's supreme academic body.\n[[File:Elphinstone Hall Wiki.jpg|left|thumb|Elphinstone Hall]]\nThere are correspondingly three main officers of the university. It is nominally headed by the [[University Chancellor|Chancellor]], a largely ceremonial position traditionally held by the [[Bishop of Aberdeen]] but divorced from the see as a result of the [[Scottish Reformation]] and holders are now elected for life by the General Council.

Academic dress is usually worn only at formal occasions, such as at graduation, Founder's Day, or academic processions which take place for ceremonial reasons. For undergraduate degrees (e.g. MA, BSc, LLB etc.), a long black gown is worn with a hood of black silk and lined with silk in a colour which varies depending on discipline. For example, the lining is white silk for all [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] degrees, green silk for [[Bachelor of Science]] in pure sciences, and crimson silk for [[MBChB]]. A black mortarboard is also worn. For master's degrees (e.g. [[MSc]], MLitt etc.) a long black gown is worn, with a white silk hood lined in a colour that varies by discipline. For [[PhD]], the doctor's scarlet robe is worn with black facings and sleeve lining, along with a black \"John Knox\" cap. For other doctoral degrees (e.g. EdD, LLD etc.), the scarlet robe has facings and sleeve linings in a different colour.\n\n==Academic profile==\n\n===Rankings and reputation===\n\n{{Infobox UK university rankings\n| ARWU_N = 21-28\n| ARWU_W = 201-300\n| QS_N = 23=\n| QS_W = 194\n| THE_N = 28\n| THE_W = 168\n| LEIDEN_W = 107\n| LINE_1 = 0\n| Complete = 29\n| The_Guardian = 34\n| Times/Sunday_Times = 27\n}}\n{{further|Rankings of universities in the United Kingdom}}Aberdeen is consistently ranked among the top 200 universities in the world<ref name=\":0\" /> and is ranked within the top 30 universities in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> In the 2019 ''Times Higher Education University Impact Rankings'', Aberdeen was ranked 31st in the world for impact on society.<ref name=\":3\" /> Aberdeen was also named the 2019 Scottish University of the Year by The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide.<ref name=\":4\" /> Its highest internationally ranked subject is Divinity and Religious Studies, which is ranked at 34th in the world<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2019/theology-divinity-religious-studies|title=Theology, Divinity & Religious Studies|date=15 February 2019|website=Top Universities|language=en|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref> and joint 7th in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nuk-tnl-deck-prod-static.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/a57d48399922b03419153a9760c5ce53.html|title=University Guide 2016 - The Times|website=nuk-tnl-deck-prod-static.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref> It also has an excellent reputation for medical research and many of its subjects are ranked in top 10 in the UK, including Accounting & Finance (ranked 10th in the UK, [[Complete University Guide|Complete 2020]]), Civil Engineering (9th in the UK, Complete 2020), Dentistry (9th in the UK, Complete 2020), Education (8th in the UK, Complete 2020), General Engineering (7th in the UK, Complete 2020), Law (9th in the UK, Complete 2020), Linguistics (3rd in the UK, Complete 2020) and Sports Science (2nd in the UK, Complete 2020).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings|title=Top UK University League Tables and Rankings 2020|website=www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref> Aberdeen also has great reputation for economics with leading graduate prospect in the country.

The university's iconic buildings act as symbols of wider Aberdeen, particularly Marischal College in the city centre and the [[crown steeple]] of King's College in [[Old Aberdeen]]. There are two campuses; the predominantly utilised King's College campus dominates the section of the city known as [[Old Aberdeen]], which is approximately two miles north of the city centre. Although the original site of the university's foundation, most academic buildings apart from the King's College Chapel and Quadrangle were constructed in the 20th century during a period of significant expansion. The university's [[Foresterhill]] campus is next to [[Aberdeen Royal Infirmary]] and houses the [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine and Dentistry|School of Medicine and Dentistry]] as well as the School of Medical Sciences. Together these buildings comprise one of Europe's largest health campuses.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/university-aberdeen/courses/medicine|title=Medicine - University of Aberdeen|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en}}</ref> The annual income of the institution for 2017\u201318 was \u00a3219.5&nbsp;million of which \u00a356.1&nbsp;million was from research grants and contracts, with an expenditure of \u00a3226.8&nbsp;million.<ref name=\"accounts\"/>\n\nAberdeen has {{HESA student population|INSTID=0170}} students from undergraduate to doctoral level (as of {{HESA year}}), including many international students. An abundant range of disciplines are taught at the university, with 650 undergraduate degree programmes offered in the 2012\u201313 academic year. Many important figures in the field of divinity were educated at the university, particularly in its earlier history, giving rise to the [[Aberdeen doctors]] in the 17th century, and the prolific [[Scottish Enlightenment|enlightenment]] philosopher [[Thomas Reid]] during the [[Scottish Enlightenment|Scottish Enlightenment.]] [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation#University of Aberdeen|Five Nobel laureates]] have since been associated with the university.<ref name=FastFacts>{{cite web |url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/news/fast-facts.php |title=Fast Facts | publisher=University of Aberdeen |accessdate=27 June 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{for|history pre-1860|King's College, Aberdeen|Marischal College}}\n\n===King's and Marischal Colleges===\n[[File:King's College, Aberdeen (4315559621).jpg|alt=|thumb|King's College, Aberdeen.]]\nThere appears to have existed in Old Aberdeen, from a very early period, a ''Studium Generate,'' or University, attached to the Episcopal Chapter of the See of Aberdeen. It is said to have been founded in 1157 by Edward, Bishop of Aberdeen, and although, according to Boece, it still existed at the period when King's College was founded, it is probable that it had in some way ceased to answer the purposes which it must have been designed to serve, since King James IV., in his letter to Pope Alexander VI., requesting him to found a University in Old Aberdeen, mentions as the chief motive for the undertaking, the profound ignorance of the inhabitants of the north of Scotland, and the great deficiency of properly educated men to fill the clerical office in that part of his kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Gregory|first=William|title=The New Statistical Account of Scotland (1845)|publisher=|year=1845|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe first university in Aberdeen, [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]], formally '''The University and King's College of Aberdeen (Collegium Regium Abredonense)''', was founded on 10th February 1494 by [[William Elphinstone]], [[Bishop of Aberdeen]], [[Chancellor]] of Scotland, and a graduate of the [[University of Glasgow]] drafting a request on behalf of [[James IV of Scotland|King James IV]] to [[Pope Alexander VI]] resulting in a [[Papal Bull]] being issued.<ref name=\"foundation\" /> It seems that James was keen to ensure that Scotland had as many universities as England at the time, and it was to possess all the privileges enjoyed by those of Paris and [[University of Bologna|Bologna]], two of the most highly favoured in Europe. The university, modelled on that of the [[University of Paris]] and intended principally as a [[law school]], soon became the most famous and popular of the Scots seats of learning, largely due to the prestige of Elphinstone and his friend, [[Hector Boece]], the first principal appointed in 1500. Its aim was to train doctors, teachers and clergy who would serve the communities of northern Scotland, as well as lawyers and administrators for the Scottish Crown. It was a collegiate foundation with 36 full-time staff and students and walls protecting it from the outside world. In 1497 the College established the first [[Regius Professor|chair of medicine]] in the English-speaking world. \n\nFollowing the [[Scottish Reformation]] in 1560, King's College was purged of its Roman Catholic staff but in other respects was largely resistant to change. [[George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal|George Keith]], the fifth [[Earl Marischal]] was a moderniser within the college and supportive of the reforming ideas of [[Peter Ramus]] and [[Andrew Melville]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/noblecollege/building.htm |title=This Noble College: Building on the European tradition |publisher=University of Aberdeen |accessdate=20 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130508105123/http://www.abdn.ac.uk/noblecollege/building.htm |archivedate=8 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In April 1593 he founded a second university in the city, [[Marischal College]]. It is also possible the founding of another college in nearby [[Fraserburgh]] by Sir Alexander Fraser, a business rival of Keith, was instrumental in its creation. Aberdeen was highly unusual at this time for having two universities in one city: as 20th-century University prospectuses observed, Aberdeen had the same number as existed in England at the time (the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge]]).\n[[File:Kings College, Aberdeen about 1661. Wellcome M0008087.jpg|alt=|thumb|An illustration of King's College in 1661.]]\nInitially, Marischal College offered the Principal of King's College a role in selecting its academics, but this was refused - the first blow in a developing rivalry. Marischal College, in the commercial heart of the city (rather than the ancient but much smaller collegiate enclave of Old Aberdeen), was quite different in nature and outlook. For example, it was more integrated into the life of the city, such as allowing students to live outwith the College. The two rival colleges often clashed, sometimes in court, but also in brawls between students on the streets of Aberdeen. [[Duncan Liddel|Duncan Liddell]] endowed the first chair in mathematics at Marischal in 1613, but the first professor wasn't appointed until 1626.\n\nAs the institutions put aside their differences, a process of attempted (but unsuccessful) mergers began in the 17th century. During this time, both colleges made notable intellectual contributions to the [[Scottish Enlightenment]]. Both colleges supported the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] rebellion and following the defeat of the [[1715 rising]] were largely purged by the authorities of their academics and officials.\n\n===King Charles' University (1641-61) and the merger of the two Colleges (1860)===\n[[File:Marischal College, Aberdeen - geograph.org.uk - 1548676.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Marischal College]]\nThe nearest the two colleges had come to full union was as the \"Caroline University of Aberdeen\", a merger initiated by [[Charles I of England|Charles I of Scotland]] in 1641, which united the two colleges for twenty years. Following the civil conflicts of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]], a more complete unification was attempted following the ratification of Parliament by [[Oliver Cromwell]] during the [[English Interregnum|interregnum]] in 1654. This united university survived until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] whereby all laws made during this period were rescinded by [[Charles II of Scotland|Charles II]] and the two colleges reverted to independent status.<ref name=\"electricscotland.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/statistical/kings.htm |title=The New Statistical Account of Scotland - Account of the University and King's College of Aberdeen |publisher=Electricscotland.com |accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> Charles I is still recognised as one of the university's founders, due to his part in creating the Caroline University and his benevolence towards King's College.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/mediareleases/archive/2004/pr1311.hti |publisher=Public Relations, University of Aberdeen, pubrel@abdn.ac.uk |title=Founders' Day Service |date=9 November 2004 |accessdate=20 November 2010}}</ref> Further unsuccessful suggestions for union were brought about throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries.<ref name=\"electricscotland.com\" /> The evolving examination system now required much higher academic standards from the students. The two colleges in Aberdeen merged on 15 September 1860 in accordance with the [[Universities (Scotland) Act 1858]], which also created a new medical school at Marischal College. The 1858 [[Act of Parliament]] stated the \"''united University shall take rank among the Universities of Scotland as from the date of erection of King's College and University.''\" The university is thus Scotland's third oldest and the United Kingdom's fifth oldest University.\n\n===The modern university===\nThe relationship of the two ex-college campuses has changed over the years. While at the time of unification each had approximately equal numbers of students, buildings at Marischal College began to be expanded in the late-19th century with a significant rebuilding effort completed in 1906. In the 20th century, the university expanded greatly, particularly at King's College. New buildings were constructed on the land around King's College throughout the 20th century. Initially, these were built to match the ancient buildings (e.g. the New King's lecture rooms and Elphinstone Hall), but later ones from the 1960s onward were constructed in [[Brutalism|brutalist]] style. Meanwhile, the Foresterhill campus began to train medical students in the 1930s next to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.\n[[File:Sir Duncan Rice Library 2018-04-21.jpg|alt=|thumb|192x192px|Fa\u00e7ade of the Sir Duncan Rice Library in Old Aberdeen]]\nDuring the mid-20th century departments which had been at Marischal College moved into one of these new buildings (most at King's College) and by the late 20th-century Marischal College had been abandoned by all but the Anatomy Department, a graduation hall and the Marischal Museum ([[Marischal College]] has now been restored as the headquarters of Aberdeen City Council, which is leasing a portion of the complex from the university). Following extensive fundraising, a \u00a357 million new university library (the [[Sir Duncan Rice Library]]) opened in autumn 2011 at the King's College campus to replace the outgrown Queen Mother Library<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/library/about/main/|title=The Sir Duncan Rice Library |publisher=University of Aberdeen |accessdate=12 July 2014}}</ref> and was officially opened by the Queen in September 2012.<ref name=\"Queen New Library\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-19707174|title=Queen opens new library at Aberdeen University|publisher=BBC News|date=24 September 2012 |accessdate=20 December 2012}}</ref> Today, most students spend most of their time in modern buildings which provide up-to-date facilities for teaching, research and other activities such as dining. However, the old buildings at King's College are still in use as lecture and tutorial rooms and accommodation for various academic departments.\n\nIn February 2020, the [[Scottish Funding Council]] (SFC) found that in approving a financial settlement agreement with the former Principal [[Ian Diamond|Professor Sir Ian Diamond]], the university failed to make best use of public funds or exercise good governance. As a result of the investigation, the university was ordered to repay \u00a3119,000 of grant finance to the SFC and undertake an externally-facilitated examination of its governance and culture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/aberdeen-told-repay-ps119k-over-ex-heads-gardening-leave|title=Aberdeen told to repay \u00a3119K over ex-head\u2019s \u2018gardening leave\u2019|last=Grove|first=Jack|date=18 February 2020|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Campuses==\nThe original buildings of both colleges which united to form the university are much admired architectural features of Aberdeen. The main campus is now at King's College, where the original buildings are still in use in addition to many newer buildings of largely [[modernist]] style. A second campus at [[Foresterhill]] houses the [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine|School of Medicine, Medical Science & Nutrition]].<ref name=\"estates\"/> In addition, there are smaller facilities at other sites such as the [[Royal Cornhill Hospital]] to the west of the city centre, and the [[Rowett Research Institute|Rowett Institute]] in [[Bucksburn]].\n\n===King's College===\n{{See also|King's College, Aberdeen}}\n[[File:AberdeenKingsCollegeChapel 2013-08.jpg|alt=|thumb|King's College quad|left]]\nThe King's College campus covers an area of some 35 hectares around the ancient [[King's College, Aberdeen|King's College]] buildings and the High Street. It hosts around two-thirds of the university's built estate and most student facilities, and lies 2 miles north of [[Aberdeen]] city centre.<ref name=\"estates\"/> The university does not own all the buildings on the \"campus\" which also include private houses, shops and businesses (although many of these rely heavily on custom from the university community) and it is best thought of as a district of the city dominated by the university. It can be reached from the city centre by bus routes 1, 2, 13, 19 and 20 operated by [[First Aberdeen]] and from northern Aberdeenshire or the bus station at Union Square by various routes operated by [[Stagecoach Bluebird]].\n[[File:New King's, Old Aberdeen. - geograph.org.uk - 115911.jpg|alt=|thumb|New Building, King's College (\"New Kings\")]]\nThe historic King's College buildings form a [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] with interior court, two sides of which have been rebuilt and expanded with a library wing in the 19th century. The Crown Tower and the Chapel, the oldest parts, date from around 1500. The original foundation contained the Chapel, the Great Hall and living accommodation, with its own kitchen and brewery, a well in the quadrangle, and a college garden to provide herbs and vegetables. The Grammar School was just outside the walls, in front of the College. The Crown Tower is surmounted by a structure about 40&nbsp;ft (12 m) high, consisting of a six-sided lantern and Imperial crown, both sculptured, and resting on the intersections of two arched ornamental slips rising from the four corners of the top of the tower. This crown, also known as the \"Crown of Kings\", frequently acts as a symbol of the university. The [[choir]] of the chapel contains original oak-canopied stalls, miserere seats, and lofty open screens in the French flamboyant style. They were preserved by the college's Principal during the [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]], who fought off local barons who had attacked the nearby [[St Machar's Cathedral]].  The Cromwell Tower, created between 1658-1662 opposite the Crown Tower, was originally built as residential accommodation, but an observatory was built on top in 1826.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/nph120/astro/cto/histcrom.htm|title=History of the Cromwell Tower Observatory|last=|first=|date=|website=Aberdeen University History|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The library wing was converted into an exhibition and conference venue in the 1990s and today also houses the university's Business School.\nThe first of the modern age of construction in the King's campus began with the construction in 1913 of the New Building (now known as ''\"New King's\"''), largely in a similar architectural style to the old buildings. New King's groups to form a yet larger quadrangle-like green for the campus also bordered by the High Street, King's and [[Elphinstone Hall]], a traditional 1930 replacement for the Great Hall. The Elphinstone Hall was subsequently used as a dining facility but is now used for graduations, examinations, fairs, and other large university events.\n\nHowever, most students and staff spend relatively little time in these historic buildings, with a large number of modern ones housing most facilities and academic departments. Most date from the second half of the 20th century. Some of these echo the existing architecture of [[Old Aberdeen]], such as the Fraser Noble Building with its distinctive concrete crown designed to resemble the one adorning King's College. Other buildings were constructed of stone in the 1950s (e.g. the Taylor Building and Meston Building). A number of other buildings are designed in the [[Brutalism|brutalist style]], such as the Arts Lecture Theatre and adjoining William Guild Building, opened in 1969 to house the School of Psychology. Also on the site is the [[Cruickshank Botanic Garden]] which was presented to the university in 1899 and is open to the public.\n\n[[File:Aberdeen University Library interior atrium, Aberdeen, Scotland, UK.JPG|thumb|Atrium of the main Sir Duncan Rice Library at King's College campus, looking up]]The most recent building on campus is the Sir Duncan Rice Library, completed in 2011 and designed by Danish architects [[Schmidt Hammer Lassen]]. It was officially opened by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] in September 2012 and named after [[Duncan Rice]], a previous Principal of the university.<ref name=\"Queen New Library\" /> This seven-storey tower, clad in zebra-like jagged stripes of white and clear glass, replaced the smaller Queen Mother Library as the university's main library and can be seen prominently from the entire campus and much of the city. It is open to the public and outstanding views of the city and coastline are available from the upper floors.

The university's library service (i.e. including all libraries) holds over one million books.\n\n===Marischal College===\n{{See also|Marischal College}}\n[[File:Marischal College - panoramio (1).jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Marischal College (following restoration in 2011)]]\n[[Marischal College]] is a [[neo-Gothic]] building, having been rebuilt in 1836\u201341, and greatly extended several years later. Formerly an open three-sided court, the college now forms a quadrangle as additions to the buildings were opened by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] in 1906 and form the current facade from Broad Street. The building is widely considered to be one of the best examples of neo-Gothic [[architecture]] in Great Britain; the architect, [[Alexander Marshall Mackenzie]] was a native of Aberdeen as well as an alumnus of the university. The Mitchell Tower at the rear is named for the benefactor (Dr [[Charles Mitchell (shipbuilder)|Charles Mitchell]]) who paid for the graduation hall. The opening of this tower in 1895 was part of celebrations of the 400th anniversary of the university.\n\nUntil 1996, Marischal College housed the Departments of Molecular & Cell Biology and Biomedical Sciences, which had been there for many decades. From 1996, the departments moved to Kings College campus and Foresterhill campus.  Teaching no longer takes place at Marischal College, with many of the departments formerly based there having moved to King's College some decades previously. While graduations and other events (e.g. concerts) took place in the cathedral-like Mitchell Hall in the north wing, for many years much of the building (including the frontage to the street) was derelict. A restoration project was completed in 2011 and restored the building and its ornamentation. The Broad Street frontage is now on long-term lease to [[Aberdeen City Council]] and forms the administrative headquarters for the city, replacing the ageing St. Nicholas House across the street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abdn.ac.uk/about/campus/marischal-college-394.php|title=Marischal College {{!}} About {{!}} The University of Aberdeen|website=www.abdn.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref> The project provided modernized public facilities and office accommodation for the Council as well as cosmetic rejuvenation, and involved the demolition and reconstruction of internal spaces while retaining and restoring the outer walls and windows. The university controls the north wing of the building containing the Marischal Museum and Mitchell Hall which was used in the past for graduation and other academic ceremonies.<ref name=\"estates\"/> Graduations take place at [[Elphinstone Hall]] at King's College.\n\n===Other campuses===\n====Doha, Qatar====\nA new state of the art campus has been established in Doha, Qatar since May 2017. They have expanded their School of Business to Qatar. The courses currently offered are Accounting & finance and Business Management. The first batch started on 10 September 2017.\nThe university requirements are the same as those in the Kings College Campus which are A<sup>*</sup>ABB to AAAB. These students will be the first ones to graduate at a campus abroad.\nThe current dean of the college is Brian Buckley. The Provost is Dr Karen Foster.\n\n[[File:Kingscollegeaberdeen2.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to King's College Quadrangle]]\n\n====Foresterhill====\nThe Foresterhill site contains the university's [[University of Aberdeen School of Medicine|School of Medicine, Medical Science & Nutrition]], Medical Library and associated modern buildings for teaching and research. The School includes the Rowett Institute of Nutrition, the Institute of Medical Sciences, Institute of Applied Health Sciences, Institute of Dentistry, and Institute of Education for Medical & Dental Sciences. It is at Foresterhill, in Aberdeen's West End. It became part of the university's holdings in 1938 following the move of the Medical School and forms part of a modern teaching hospital complex alongside the [[Aberdeen Royal Infirmary]]. The 41 hectare site is split between the university (owning around a third) and [[NHS Scotland|NHS Grampian]].<ref name=\"estates\">{{cite web|url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/estates/strategy.shtml|publisher=University Estates Office|accessdate=13 August 2009|title=Estate Strategy 2002-2007}}</ref>\n\n====Hilton====\nA small campus at Hilton became part of the university estate following a merger in 2001 between the university and the Aberdeen campus of the Northern College, and temporarily became home to the university's Faculty of Education.

This gives the university a tripartite constitution comprising the [[General Council (Scottish university)|General Council]] of senior academics and graduates, the [[University Court]] responsible for finances and administration, and the [[Academic Senate]] (''Senatus Academicus'')--the university's supreme academic body.\n[[File:Elphinstone Hall Wiki.jpg|left|thumb|Elphinstone Hall]]\nThere are correspondingly three main officers of the university. It is nominally headed by the [[University Chancellor|Chancellor]], a largely ceremonial position traditionally held by the [[Bishop of Aberdeen]] but divorced from the see as a result of the [[Scottish Reformation]] and holders are now elected for life by the General Council. There is also a [[Rector of the University of Aberdeen|rector of the university]], who chairs the University Court and is elected by the students for a three-year term to represent their interests. There are also four Assessors, ten Masters, including the Principal and Vice Principal, and the factor or Procurator.\n\nThe administrative head and [[chief executive]] of the university is its [[University Principal|principal and vice chancellor]]. The principal acts as chair of the ''Senatus Academicus'', and his status as [[vice chancellor]] enables him to perform the functions reserved to the chancellor in the latter's absence, such as the awarding of degrees.\n\n====Chancellor====\n[[File:Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall - ABr 1831JC143a.jpg|thumb|150x150px|[[Camilla, Duchess of Rothesay]]]]\nThe [[Chancellor (university)|chancellor]] is the nominal head of the university.

Academic dress is usually worn only at formal occasions, such as at graduation, Founder's Day, or academic processions which take place for ceremonial reasons. For undergraduate degrees (e.g. MA, BSc, LLB etc.), a long black gown is worn with a hood of black silk and lined with silk in a colour which varies depending on discipline. For example, the lining is white silk for all [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] degrees, green silk for [[Bachelor of Science]] in pure sciences, and crimson silk for [[MBChB]]. A black mortarboard is also worn. For master's degrees (e.g. [[MSc]], MLitt etc.) a long black gown is worn, with a white silk hood lined in a colour that varies by discipline. For [[PhD]], the doctor's scarlet robe is worn with black facings and sleeve lining, along with a black \"John Knox\" cap. For other doctoral degrees (e.g. EdD, LLD etc.), the scarlet robe has facings and sleeve linings in a different colour.\n\n==Academic profile==\n\n===Rankings and reputation===\n\n{{Infobox UK university rankings\n| ARWU_N = 21-28\n| ARWU_W = 201-300\n| QS_N = 23=\n| QS_W = 194\n| THE_N = 28\n| THE_W = 168\n| LEIDEN_W = 107\n| LINE_1 = 0\n| Complete = 29\n| The_Guardian = 34\n| Times/Sunday_Times = 27\n}}\n{{further|Rankings of universities in the United Kingdom}}Aberdeen is consistently ranked among the top 200 universities in the world<ref name=\":0\" /> and is ranked within the top 30 universities in the United Kingdom.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> In the 2019 ''Times Higher Education University Impact Rankings'', Aberdeen was ranked 31st in the world for impact on society.<ref name=\":3\" /> Aberdeen was also named the 2019 Scottish University of the Year by The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide.<ref name=\":4\" /> Its highest internationally ranked subject is Divinity and Religious Studies, which is ranked at 34th in the world<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2019/theology-divinity-religious-studies|title=Theology, Divinity & Religious Studies|date=15 February 2019|website=Top Universities|language=en|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref> and joint 7th in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nuk-tnl-deck-prod-static.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/projects/a57d48399922b03419153a9760c5ce53.html|title=University Guide 2016 - The Times|website=nuk-tnl-deck-prod-static.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com|access-date=2019-05-30}}</ref> It also has an excellent reputation for medical research and many of its subjects are ranked in top 10 in the UK, including Accounting & Finance (ranked 10th in the UK, [[Complete University Guide|Complete 2020]]), Civil Engineering (9th in the UK, Complete 2020), Dentistry (9th in the UK, Complete 2020), Education (8th in the UK, Complete 2020), General Engineering (7th in the UK, Complete 2020), Law (9th in the UK, Complete 2020), Linguistics (3rd in the UK, Complete 2020) and Sports Science (2nd in the UK, Complete 2020).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk/league-tables/rankings|title=Top UK University League Tables and Rankings 2020|website=www.thecompleteuniversityguide.co.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2019-05-21}}</ref> Aberdeen also has great reputation for economics with leading graduate prospect in the country.

He was also a professional [[American football|football]] player, actor and author.\n\n== Early life ==\n\n===Childhood===\nErnest Barnes Jr. was born during the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] in \"the bottom\" community of [[Durham, North Carolina]], near the [[Hayti, Durham, North Carolina|Hayti District]] of the city. He had a younger brother, James (b. 1942), as well as a half-brother, Benjamin B. Rogers Jr. (1920\u20131970). Ernest Jr. was nicknamed \"June\". His father, Ernest E. Barnes Sr. (\n\u20131966), worked as a shipping clerk for [[Liggett Group|Liggett Myers Tobacco Company]]. His mother, Fannie Mae Geer (1905\u20132004), oversaw the household staff for a prominent Durham attorney and local [[Board of Education]] member, Frank L. Fuller Jr.\n\nOn days when Fannie allowed \"June\" (Barnes' nickname to family and childhood friends) to accompany her to work, Mr. Fuller encouraged him to peruse the art books and listen to classical music. The young Ernest was intrigued and captivated by the works of master artists. By the time Barnes entered the first grade, he was familiar with the works of such masters as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and [[Michelangelo]]. When he entered junior high school, he could appreciate, as well as decode, many of the cherished masterpieces within the walls of mainstream museums \u2013 although it would be many more years before he was allowed entrance because of segregation.<ref name=\"ebbook\">{{cite book| last= Barnes| first= Ernie| year= 1995| title= From Pads to Palette| location= Waco, Texas| publisher= WRS Publishing| isbn= 1-56796-064-2}}</ref>\n\nA self-described chubby and unathletic child, Barnes was taunted and bullied by classmates. He continually sought refuge in his [[sketchbook]]s, finding the less-traveled parts of campus away from other students. One day Ernest was drawing in his notebook in a quiet area of the school. He was discovered hiding there by the masonry teacher, Tommy Tucker, who was also the weightlifting coach and a former athlete. He was intrigued with Barnes' drawings, so he asked the aspiring artist about his grades and goals. Tucker shared his own experience of how bodybuilding improved his strength and outlook on life. That one encounter would begin Barnes' discipline and dedication that would permeate his life. In his senior year at [[Hillside High School (Durham, North Carolina)|Hillside High School]], Barnes became the captain of the football team and state champion in the [[shot put]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Artist's Portrait |first=Charles |last=Maher |newspaper= Los Angeles Times |date=May 7, 1968}}</ref>\n\n=== College education ===\nBarnes attended racially segregated schools. In 1956 he graduated from Hillside High School with 26 athletic scholarship offers. [[Racial segregation in the United States|Segregation]] prevented him from attending nearby [[Duke University]] or the [[University of North Carolina]]. His mother promised him a car if he lived at home so he attended the all-Black North Carolina College at Durham (formerly North Carolina College for Negroes, now [[North Carolina Central University]]). At North Carolina College he majored in art on a full athletic scholarship. His track coach was [[LeRoy T. Walker|Dr. Leroy T. Walker]].<ref name=\"ebbook\" /> Barnes played the football positions of tackle and center at NCC.\n\nAt age 18, on a college art class field trip to the newly desegregated [[North Carolina Museum of Art]] in Raleigh, Barnes inquired where he could find \"paintings by Negro artists\". The [[Museum docent|docent]] responded, \"Your people don't express themselves that way\".<ref name=\"BOTGcat1990\">\"The Beauty of the Ghetto\" catalogue, Grand Central Art Galleries, New York, 1990 \"Artist Statement\"</ref> 23 years later, in 1979, when Barnes returned to the museum for a solo exhibition, North Carolina Governor [[Jim Hunt]] attended.\n\nIn 1990 Barnes was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts by North Carolina Central University.<ref name=\"Artnet.com Ernie Barnes Bio\">{{cite web|title=Ernie Barnes Bio|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/ernie-barnes/biography|website=artnet.com|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999 Barnes was bestowed \"The University Award\", the highest honor by the University of North Carolina Board of Governors.<ref name=\"Artnet.com Ernie Barnes Bio\"/>\n\n== Professional football ==\n\n=== Baltimore Colts (1959\u201360) ===\nIn December 1959 Barnes was drafted in the 10th round by the then-World Champion [[Indianapolis Colts#The NFL Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]].  He was originally selected in the 8th-round by the [[Washington Redskins]],<ref name=\"NYTimes05071964\">{{cite news |title=Ernie Barnes: An Athletic Artist |newspaper=New York Times |date=May 7, 1984}}</ref> who renounced the pick minutes after discovering he was a [[Negro]].\n\nShortly after his 22nd birthday, while at the Colts training camp, Barnes was interviewed by N.P. Clark, sportswriter for the [[Baltimore News-Post]] newspaper.  Until then Barnes was always known by his birth name, Ernest Barnes.  But when Clark's article appeared on July 20, 1960, it referred to him as \"Ernie Barnes,\" which changed his name and life forever.<ref>{{cite news |title=Little Bunch of Colt Rookies Turn Up Big |first=N.P. |last=Clark |newspaper=The Baltimore News-Post |date=July 20, 1960}}</ref>\n\n=== Titans of New York (1960) ===\nBarnes was the last cut of the Colts' training camp.  After Baltimore released Barnes, the newly formed [[New York Jets|Titans of New York]] immediately signed him because the team had first option on any player released within the league.<ref name=\"NYTimes05071964\" />\n\nBarnes loathed being on the Titans.  He said, \"(New York team organization) was a circus of ineptitude.  The equipment was poor, the coaches not as knowledgeable as the ones in Baltimore.  We were like a group of guys in the neighborhood who said let's pretend we're pros.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes05071964\" />\n\nAfter their seventh game on October 9, 1960 at [[Jeppesen Stadium]], his teammate [[Howard Glenn]] died.  Barnes asked for his release two days later.  The cause of Glenn's death was reported as a broken neck.  However, Barnes and other teammates have long attributed it to [[Heat stroke|heatstroke]].<ref name=\"ebbook\" />  In a later interview, Barnes said, \"They never really said what he died of.  (Coach) [[Sammy Baugh]] said he'd broken his neck in a game the Sunday before.  But how could that be?  How could he have hit in practice all week with a broken neck?  What he died of, I think, was more like heat exhaustion.  I told them I didn't want to play on a team like this.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes05071964\" />\n\n=== San Diego Chargers (1960\u201362) ===\nBarnes decided to accept a previous offer from Coach [[Al Davis]] at the [[Los Angeles Chargers]].  Barnes joined their team at mid-season as a member of their [[taxi squad]].  The following season in 1961 the team moved to [[San Diego]].  It was there Barnes met teammate [[Jack Kemp]], and the two men would share a very close lifelong friendship.

Courtesy of the Ernie Barnes Family Trust.]]\n \nDuring the off-seasons with the Chargers, Barnes was program director at San Diego's Southeast [[YMCA]] working with parolees from the [[California Youth Authority]].<ref name=\"ebbook\" />  He also worked as the Sports Editor for ''The Voice'', a local San Diego newspaper, writing a weekly column called \"A Matter of Sports.\"<ref>{{cite news |year=1962\u20131963 |newspaper=The Voice Newspapers}}</ref>\n\nBarnes also illustrated several articles for ''[[San Diego Magazine]]'' during the off-seasons in 1962 and 1963.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ridgely |first=Roberta |date=February 1962 |title=The Times are Out of Joints |journal=San Diego Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Keen |first=Harold |date=July 1963 |title=San Diego's Racial Powder Keg |journal=San Diego Magazine}}</ref>\n\nBarnes' first television interview as a professional football player and artist was in 1962 on ''The [[Regis Philbin]] Show'' on [[KGTV]] in San Diego.  It was Philbin's first talk show.  They would see each other again 45 years later when Philbin attended the tribute to Barnes in New York City.\n\n=== Denver Broncos (1963\u201364) ===\nMidway through Barnes' second season with the Chargers, he was cut after a series of injuries.  He was then signed to the [[Denver Broncos]].\n\nBarnes was often fined by Denver Coach [[Jack Faulkner]] when caught sketching during team meetings.<ref name=\"ebbook\" />  One of the sketches that he was fined $100 for sold years later for $1000.<ref name=\"MobileReg03131985\">{{cite news |title=Two 'Gold Medalists' in Art, Barnes, Parmenter, Coming Here |newspaper=Mobile Register |date=March 13, 1985}}</ref>\n\t\nMany times during breaks, Barnes would run off the field onto the sideline to give his offensive line coach [[Red Miller]] the scraps of paper of his sketches and notes.\n\n\"During a timeout you've got nothing to do \u2013 you're not talking \u2013 you're just trying to breathe, mostly.  Nothing to take out that little pencil and write down what you saw.  The shape of the linemen.  The body language a defensive lineman would occupy... his posture...  What I see when you pull.  The reaction of the defense to your movement.  The awareness of the lines within the movement, the pattern within the lines, the rhythm of movement.

In the final quarter of their last exhibition game, Barnes fractured his right foot, effectively ending his professional football career.\n\n=== Retirement ===\nShortly after his final football game, Barnes went to the 1965 NFL owners meeting in Houston in hopes of becoming the league's official artist.  There he was introduced to [[New York Jets]] owner [[Sonny Werblin]], who was intrigued by Barnes and his art.  He paid for Barnes to bring his paintings to [[New York City]].  Later they met at a gallery and unbeknownst to Barnes, three art critics were there to evaluate his paintings.  They told Werblin that Barnes was \"the most expressive painter of sports since [[George Bellows]].\"<ref name=\"ebbook\" />\n\nIn what was one of the most unusual posts in the history of the NFL, Werblin retained Barnes as a salaried player, but positioned him in front of the canvas, rather than on the football field. Werblin told Barnes, \"You have more value to the country as an artist than as a football player.\"<ref>''Resonance, The Company of Art'' (newsletter), 1996.</ref>\n\nBarnes' November 1966 debut solo exhibition, hosted by Werblin at the [[Grand Central Art Galleries]] in New York City was critically acclaimed and all the paintings sold.<ref name= SpIllus112166>{{cite journal| title= People| url= https://www.si.com/vault/1966/11/21/609984/people |date=November 21, 1966 |journal=Sports Illustrated |accessdate= August 21, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The Painter |first= Larry| last= Merchant |newspaper=The New York Post |date=November 19, 1966}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971 Barnes wrote a series of essays (illustrated with his own drawings) in the Gridiron newspaper titled \"I Hate the Game I Love\" (with Neil Amdur).<ref>{{cite news |title=I Hate the Game I Love |first1= Ernie | last1= Barnes| first2= Neil| last2= Amdur |newspaper= Gridiron |year=1971 }}</ref>  These articles became the beginning manuscript of his autobiography, later-published in 1995 titled ''From Pads to Palette'' which chronicles his transition from professional football to his art career.\n\nIn 1993 Barnes was selected to the \"Black College Football 100th Year All-Time Team\" by the Sheridan Broadcasting Network.\n\n== Artwork ==\nBarnes credits his college art instructor Ed Wilson for laying the foundation for his development as an artist.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/27/nyregion/ed-wilson-71-a-sculptor-and-art-teacher.html|title=Ed Wilson, 71, a Sculptor and Art Teacher|last=Jr|first=Robert Mcg Thomas|date=1997-01-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>  Wilson was a sculptor who instructed Barnes to paint from his own life experiences.  \"He made me conscious of the fact that the artist who is useful to America is one who studies his own life and records it through the medium of art, manners and customs of his own experiences.\"<ref>{{cite news |newspaper= Durham Morning Herald |date=November 1, 1973}}</ref>\n\nAll his life, Barnes was ambivalent about his football experience.  In interviews and in personal appearances, Barnes said he hated the violence and the physical torment of the sport.  However, his years as an athlete gave him unique, in-depth observations.  \"(Wilson) told me to pay attention to what my body felt like in movement.  Within that elongation, there's a feeling.  And attitude and expression. I hate to think had I not played sports what my work would look like.\"<ref>Interview, \"Our World with Black Enterprise\"</ref>\n\nBarnes sold his first painting \"Slow Dance\" at age 21 in 1959 for $90 to [[Boston Celtics|Boston Celtic]] [[Sam Jones (basketball)|Sam Jones]].<ref name=\"ebbook\" />  It was subsequently lost in a fire at Jones' home.\n\nNumerous artists have been influenced by Barnes' art and unique style. Accordingly, several [[copyright infringement]] lawsuits have been settled and are currently pending.\n\n=== Framing ===\nErnie Barnes framed his paintings with distressed wood in homage to his father. In his 1995 autobiography, Barnes wrote of his father: \u201c... with so little education, he had worked so hard for us. His legacy to me was his effort, and that was plenty. He knew absolutely nothing about art.\u201d<ref name=\"ebbook\"/>\n\nWeeks before Ernie Barnes\u2019 first solo art exhibition in 1966, he was at the family home in Durham as his father lay in the hospital after suffering a [[stroke]]. He noticed the usually well-maintained white picketed fence had gone untended since his father\u2019s illness. Days later, Ernest E. Barnes Sr. died. \u201cI placed a painting against the fence and stood away and had a look. I was startled at the marriage between the old wood fence and the painting. It was perfect. In tribute, Daddy\u2019s fence would hug all my paintings in a prestigious New York gallery. That would have made him smile.\u201d<ref name=\"ebbook\"/>\n\n=== Eyes closed ===\nA consistent and distinct feature in Barnes' work is the closed eyes of his subjects.  \"It was in 1971 when I conceived the idea of ''The Beauty of the Ghetto'' as an exhibition.  And I showed it to some people who were Black to get a reaction.  And from one (person) it was very negative.  And when I began to express my points of view (to this) professional man, he resisted the notion. And as a result of his comments and his attitude I began to see, observe, how blind we are to one another's humanity.  Blinded by a lot of things that have, perhaps, initiated feelings in that light.  We don't see into the depths of our interconnection.  The gifts, the strength and potential within other human beings.  We stop at color quite often. So one of the things we have to be aware of is who we are in order to have the capacity to like others.  But when you cannot visualize the offerings of another human being you're obviously not looking at the human being with open eyes.\"<ref>Barnes, Ernie. Interview, \"Personal Diaries\" with Ed Gordon, BET, 1990</ref>  \"We look upon each other and decide immediately: This person is black, so he must be... This person lives in poverty, so he must be...\"<ref name=\"NSDaily12141990\" />\n\n=== Jewish community influence ===\nMoving to an all-Jewish neighborhood in Los Angeles known as the Fairfax District in 1971 was a major turning point in Barnes' life and art.\n \n\"Fairfax enlivened me to everyday life themes,\" he said, \"and forced me to look at my life \u2013 the way I had grown up, the customs within my community versus the customs in the Jewish community. Their customs were documented, ours were not. Because we were so clueless that our own culture had value and because of the phrase 'Black is Beautiful' had just come into fashion, Black people were just starting to appreciate themselves as a people. But when it was said, 'I'm Black and I'm Proud,' I said, 'proud of what?' And that question of 'proud of what' led to a series of paintings that became \u201cThe Beauty of the Ghetto.'\"\n\n=== \"The Beauty of the Ghetto\" exhibition ===\nIn response to the 1960s \"[[Black is beautiful]]\" cultural movement and [[James Brown]]'s 1968 \"Say it Loud: I'm Black and I'm Proud\" song, Barnes created ''The Beauty of the Ghetto'' exhibition of 35 paintings that toured major American cities from 1972 to 1979 hosted by dignitaries, professional athletes and celebrities.\n\nOf this exhibition, Barnes said, \"I am providing a pictorial background for an understanding into the aesthetics of black America.  It is not a plea to people to continue to live there (in the ghetto) but for those who feel trapped, it is...a challenge of how beautiful life can be.\"<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Atlanta Journal and Constitution |date=September 16, 1973}}</ref>\n\nWhen the exhibition was on view in 1974 at the [[National Museum of African Art|Museum of African Art]] in Washington, DC, Rep. [[John Conyers]] stressed the important positive message of the exhibit in the [[Congressional Record]].\n\n=== Sports art ===\nThe [[Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee]] named Barnes \"Sports Artist of the 1984 Olympic Games\".  LAOOC President [[Peter V. Ueberroth]] said Barnes and his art \"captured the essence of the [[Olympics]]\" and \"portray the city's ethnic diversity, the power and emotion of sports competition, the singleness of purpose and hopes that go into the making of athletes the world over.\" Barnes was commissioned to create five Olympic-themed paintings and serve as an official Olympic spokesman to encourage inner city youth.<ref name=\"LATimes03151984\">{{cite news |title=An Olympic Artist With A Message |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=May 24, 1984}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Long Beach Press Telegram |date=March 15, 1984}}</ref>\n\n1985:  Barnes was named the first \"Sports Artist of the Year\" by the [[United States Sports Academy]].<ref name=\"MobileReg03131985\" />\n\n1987:  Barnes created ''Fastbreak'', a commissioned painting of the World Champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]] basketball team that included [[Magic Johnson]], [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[James Worthy]], [[Kurt Rambis]] and [[Michael Cooper]].\n\n1996: [[Carolina Panthers]] football team owners Rosalind and [[Jerry Richardson]] (Barnes' former Colts teammate) commissioned Barnes to create the large painting ''Victory in Overtime'' (approximately 7&nbsp;ft. x 14&nbsp;ft.).  It was unveiled before the team's 1996 inaugural season and hangs permanently in the owner's suite at the stadium.  Richardson and Barnes were Baltimore Colts teammates briefly in 1960.\n\n1996:  To commemorate their 50th anniversary in 1996, the [[National Basketball Association]] commissioned Barnes to create a painting with the theme, \"Where we were, where we are, and where we are going.\"  The painting, ''The Dream Unfolds'' hangs in the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[Massachusetts]].  A limited edition of lithographs were made, with the first 50 prints going to each of the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team. \n\t\t\t\t\n2004:  Barnes was named \"America's Best Painter of Sports\" by the American Sport Art Museum & Archives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asama.org/awards-of-sport/medallion-series/sport-artist-of-the-year/ernie-barnes |title=1984 & 2004 Sports Artist of the Year, Ernie Barnes, America's El Greco| website= ASAMA.org| publisher= The American Sport Art Museum & Archives |accessdate= October 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOther notable sports commissions include paintings for the [[New Orleans Saints]], [[Oakland Raiders]] and [[Boston Patriots]] football team owners.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.erniebarnes.com/biography.html |title= Biography |website= ErnieBarnes.com |accessdate= October 26, 2010 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161216172615/http://www.erniebarnes.com/biography.html |archivedate= December 16, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n=== \"The Bench\" painting ===\nShortly after Barnes was drafted by the Baltimore Colts, Barnes was invited to see their [[1959 NFL Championship Game|Colts' NFL Championship Game]] vs. the [[New York Giants]] at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] in [[Maryland]] on December 27, 1959.  The Colts won 31\u201316 and Barnes was filled with layers of emotion after watching the game from the Colts' bench.  At age 21, he had just signed his football contract and met his new teammates [[Johnny Unitas]], [[Jim Parker (American football)|Jim Parker]], [[Lenny Moore]], [[Art Donovan]], [[Gino Marchetti]], [[Alan Ameche]] and [[Eugene Lipscomb|\"Big Daddy\" Lipscomb]].\n\nAfter he returned home, without making any preliminary sketches, he went directly to a blank canvas to record his point of view.  Using a palette knife, \"painting in quick, direct movements hoping to capture the vision...before it evaporated,\" Barnes said, he created \"The Bench\" in less than an hour.<ref name=\"ebbook\" />  Throughout his life, ''The Bench'' remained in Barnes' possession, even taking it with him to all his football training camps and hiding it under his bed. It would be the only painting Barnes would never sell, despite many substantial offers, including a $25,000 bid at his first show in 1966.\n\nIn 2014, Barnes' wife Bernie presented ''The Bench'' painting to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] for their permanent collection in Canton, Ohio.\n\n=== \"The Sugar Shack\" painting ===\nBarnes created the painting ''The Sugar Shack'' in 1971.

He was also a professional [[American football|football]] player, actor and author.\n\n== Early life ==\n\n===Childhood===\nErnest Barnes Jr. was born during the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] in \"the bottom\" community of [[Durham, North Carolina]], near the [[Hayti, Durham, North Carolina|Hayti District]] of the city. He had a younger brother, James (b. 1942), as well as a half-brother, Benjamin B. Rogers Jr. (1920\u20131970). Ernest Jr. was nicknamed \"June\". His father, Ernest E. Barnes Sr. (\n\u20131966), worked as a shipping clerk for [[Liggett Group|Liggett Myers Tobacco Company]]. His mother, Fannie Mae Geer (1905\u20132004), oversaw the household staff for a prominent Durham attorney and local [[Board of Education]] member, Frank L. Fuller Jr.\n\nOn days when Fannie allowed \"June\" (Barnes' nickname to family and childhood friends) to accompany her to work, Mr. Fuller encouraged him to peruse the art books and listen to classical music. The young Ernest was intrigued and captivated by the works of master artists. By the time Barnes entered the first grade, he was familiar with the works of such masters as [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec|Toulouse-Lautrec]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and [[Michelangelo]]. When he entered junior high school, he could appreciate, as well as decode, many of the cherished masterpieces within the walls of mainstream museums \u2013 although it would be many more years before he was allowed entrance because of segregation.<ref name=\"ebbook\">{{cite book| last= Barnes| first= Ernie| year= 1995| title= From Pads to Palette| location= Waco, Texas| publisher= WRS Publishing| isbn= 1-56796-064-2}}</ref>\n\nA self-described chubby and unathletic child, Barnes was taunted and bullied by classmates. He continually sought refuge in his [[sketchbook]]s, finding the less-traveled parts of campus away from other students. One day Ernest was drawing in his notebook in a quiet area of the school. He was discovered hiding there by the masonry teacher, Tommy Tucker, who was also the weightlifting coach and a former athlete. He was intrigued with Barnes' drawings, so he asked the aspiring artist about his grades and goals. Tucker shared his own experience of how bodybuilding improved his strength and outlook on life. That one encounter would begin Barnes' discipline and dedication that would permeate his life. In his senior year at [[Hillside High School (Durham, North Carolina)|Hillside High School]], Barnes became the captain of the football team and state champion in the [[shot put]].<ref>{{cite news |title= Artist's Portrait |first=Charles |last=Maher |newspaper= Los Angeles Times |date=May 7, 1968}}</ref>\n\n=== College education ===\nBarnes attended racially segregated schools. In 1956 he graduated from Hillside High School with 26 athletic scholarship offers. [[Racial segregation in the United States|Segregation]] prevented him from attending nearby [[Duke University]] or the [[University of North Carolina]]. His mother promised him a car if he lived at home so he attended the all-Black North Carolina College at Durham (formerly North Carolina College for Negroes, now [[North Carolina Central University]]). At North Carolina College he majored in art on a full athletic scholarship. His track coach was [[LeRoy T. Walker|Dr. Leroy T. Walker]].<ref name=\"ebbook\" /> Barnes played the football positions of tackle and center at NCC.\n\nAt age 18, on a college art class field trip to the newly desegregated [[North Carolina Museum of Art]] in Raleigh, Barnes inquired where he could find \"paintings by Negro artists\". The [[Museum docent|docent]] responded, \"Your people don't express themselves that way\".<ref name=\"BOTGcat1990\">\"The Beauty of the Ghetto\" catalogue, Grand Central Art Galleries, New York, 1990 \"Artist Statement\"</ref> 23 years later, in 1979, when Barnes returned to the museum for a solo exhibition, North Carolina Governor [[Jim Hunt]] attended.\n\nIn 1990 Barnes was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts by North Carolina Central University.<ref name=\"Artnet.com Ernie Barnes Bio\">{{cite web|title=Ernie Barnes Bio|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/ernie-barnes/biography|website=artnet.com|accessdate=March 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999 Barnes was bestowed \"The University Award\", the highest honor by the University of North Carolina Board of Governors.<ref name=\"Artnet.com Ernie Barnes Bio\"/>\n\n== Professional football ==\n\n=== Baltimore Colts (1959&ndash;60) ===\nIn December 1959 Barnes was drafted in the 10th round by the then-World Champion [[Indianapolis Colts#The NFL Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]].  He was originally selected in the 8th-round by the [[Washington Redskins]],<ref name=\"NYTimes05071964\">{{cite news |title=Ernie Barnes: An Athletic Artist |newspaper=New York Times |date=May 7, 1984}}</ref> who renounced the pick minutes after discovering he was a [[Negro]].\n\nShortly after his 22nd birthday, while at the Colts training camp, Barnes was interviewed by N.P. Clark, sportswriter for the [[Baltimore News-Post]] newspaper.  Until then Barnes was always known by his birth name, Ernest Barnes.  But when Clark's article appeared on July 20, 1960, it referred to him as \"Ernie Barnes,\" which changed his name and life forever.<ref>{{cite news |title=Little Bunch of Colt Rookies Turn Up Big |first=N.P. |last=Clark |newspaper=The Baltimore News-Post |date=July 20, 1960}}</ref>\n\n=== Titans of New York (1960) ===\nBarnes was the last cut of the Colts' training camp.  After Baltimore released Barnes, the newly formed [[New York Jets|Titans of New York]] immediately signed him because the team had first option on any player released within the league.<ref name=\"NYTimes05071964\" />\n\nBarnes loathed being on the Titans.  He said, \"(New York team organization) was a circus of ineptitude.  The equipment was poor, the coaches not as knowledgeable as the ones in Baltimore.  We were like a group of guys in the neighborhood who said let's pretend we're pros.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes05071964\" />\n\nAfter their seventh game on October 9, 1960 at [[Jeppesen Stadium]], his teammate [[Howard Glenn]] died.  Barnes asked for his release two days later.  The cause of Glenn's death was reported as a broken neck.  However, Barnes and other teammates have long attributed it to [[Heat stroke|heatstroke]].<ref name=\"ebbook\" />  In a later interview, Barnes said, \"They never really said what he died of.  (Coach) [[Sammy Baugh]] said he'd broken his neck in a game the Sunday before.  But how could that be?  How could he have hit in practice all week with a broken neck?  What he died of, I think, was more like heat exhaustion.  I told them I didn't want to play on a team like this.\"<ref name=\"NYTimes05071964\" />\n\n=== San Diego Chargers (1960-62) ===\nBarnes decided to accept a previous offer from Coach [[Al Davis]] at the [[Los Angeles Chargers]].  Barnes joined their team at mid-season as a member of their [[taxi squad]].  The following season in 1961 the team moved to [[San Diego]].  It was there Barnes met teammate [[Jack Kemp]], and the two men would share a very close lifelong friendship. [[Image:ernie barnes no 61 san diego chargers in action.jpg|thumb|1961-62 San Diego Chargers #61 Offensive guard, 6' 3\" 250 lbs. Courtesy of the Ernie Barnes Family Trust.]]\n \nDuring the off-seasons with the Chargers, Barnes was program director at San Diego's Southeast [[YMCA]] working with parolees from the [[California Youth Authority]].<ref name=\"ebbook\" />  He also worked as the Sports Editor for ''The Voice'', a local San Diego newspaper, writing a weekly column called \"A Matter of Sports.\"<ref>{{cite news |year=1962\u20131963 |newspaper=The Voice Newspapers}}</ref>\n\nBarnes also illustrated several articles for ''[[San Diego Magazine]]'' during the off-seasons in 1962 and 1963.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Ridgely |first=Roberta |date=February 1962 |title=The Times are Out of Joints |journal=San Diego Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Keen |first=Harold |date=July 1963 |title=San Diego's Racial Powder Keg |journal=San Diego Magazine}}</ref>\n\nBarnes' first television interview as a professional football player and artist was in 1962 on ''The [[Regis Philbin]] Show'' on [[KGTV]] in San Diego.  It was Philbin's first talk show.  They would see each other again 45 years later when Philbin attended the tribute to Barnes in New York City.\n\n=== Denver Broncos (1963-64) ===\nMidway through Barnes' second season with the Chargers, he was cut after a series of injuries.  He was then signed to the [[Denver Broncos]].\n\nBarnes was often fined by Denver Coach [[Jack Faulkner]] when caught sketching during team meetings.<ref name=\"ebbook\" />  One of the sketches that he was fined $100 for sold years later for $1000.<ref name=\"MobileReg03131985\">{{cite news |title=Two 'Gold Medalists' in Art, Barnes, Parmenter, Coming Here |newspaper=Mobile Register |date=March 13, 1985}}</ref>\n\t\nMany times during breaks, Barnes would run off the field onto the sideline to give his offensive line coach [[Red Miller]] the scraps of paper of his sketches and notes.\n\n\"During a timeout you've got nothing to do \u2013 you're not talking \u2013 you're just trying to breathe, mostly.  Nothing to take out that little pencil and write down what you saw.  The shape of the linemen.  The body language a defensive lineman would occupy... his posture...  What I see when you pull.  The reaction of the defense to your movement.  The awareness of the lines within the movement, the pattern within the lines, the rhythm of movement.  A couple of notes to me would denote an action... an image that I could instantly recreate in my mind.  Some of those notes have been made into paintings.  Quite a few, really.\"<ref name=\"NSDaily12141990\">{{cite news |newspaper=The National Sports Daily |date=December 14, 1990}}</ref>[[Image:ernie barnes no 62 denver broncos.jpg|thumb|1963-64 Denver Broncos, Offensive guard, 6' 3\" 253 lbs.

His jersey was #62.\n\nBarnes was called \"Big [[Rembrandt]]\" by his Denver teammates.<ref name=\"EmpireMag12061964\">{{cite journal |date=December 6, 1964 |title=Rembrandt of the Broncos |journal=Empire Magazine}}</ref>  Coincidentally, Barnes and Rembrandt share the same birthday.\n\n=== Canadian Football League ===\nIn 1965, after his second season with the Broncos, Barnes signed with the [[Saskatchewan Roughriders]] in [[Canada]].  In the final quarter of their last exhibition game, Barnes fractured his right foot, effectively ending his professional football career.\n\n=== Retirement ===\nShortly after his final football game, Barnes went to the 1965 NFL owners meeting in Houston in hopes of becoming the league's official artist.  There he was introduced to [[New York Jets]] owner [[Sonny Werblin]], who was intrigued by Barnes and his art.  He paid for Barnes to bring his paintings to [[New York City]].  Later they met at a gallery and unbeknownst to Barnes, three art critics were there to evaluate his paintings.  They told Werblin that Barnes was \"the most expressive painter of sports since [[George Bellows]].\"<ref name=\"ebbook\" />\n\nIn what was one of the most unusual posts in the history of the NFL, Werblin retained Barnes as a salaried player, but positioned him in front of the canvas, rather than on the football field. Werblin told Barnes, \"You have more value to the country as an artist than as a football player.\"<ref>''Resonance, The Company of Art'' (newsletter), 1996.</ref>\n\nBarnes' November 1966 debut solo exhibition, hosted by Werblin at the [[Grand Central Art Galleries]] in New York City was critically acclaimed and all the paintings sold.<ref name= SpIllus112166>{{cite journal| title= People| url= https://www.si.com/vault/1966/11/21/609984/people |date=November 21, 1966 |journal=Sports Illustrated |accessdate= August 21, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=The Painter |first= Larry| last= Merchant |newspaper=The New York Post |date=November 19, 1966}}</ref>\n\nIn 1971 Barnes wrote a series of essays (illustrated with his own drawings) in the Gridiron newspaper titled \"I Hate the Game I Love\" (with Neil Amdur).<ref>{{cite news |title=I Hate the Game I Love |first1= Ernie | last1= Barnes| first2= Neil| last2= Amdur |newspaper= Gridiron |year=1971 }}</ref>  These articles became the beginning manuscript of his autobiography, later-published in 1995 titled ''From Pads to Palette'' which chronicles his transition from professional football to his art career.\n\nIn 1993 Barnes was selected to the \"Black College Football 100th Year All-Time Team\" by the Sheridan Broadcasting Network.\n\n== Artwork ==\nBarnes credits his college art instructor Ed Wilson for laying the foundation for his development as an artist.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/27/nyregion/ed-wilson-71-a-sculptor-and-art-teacher.html|title=Ed Wilson, 71, a Sculptor and Art Teacher|last=Jr|first=Robert Mcg Thomas|date=1997-01-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-09-04|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>  Wilson was a sculptor who instructed Barnes to paint from his own life experiences.  \"He made me conscious of the fact that the artist who is useful to America is one who studies his own life and records it through the medium of art, manners and customs of his own experiences.\"<ref>{{cite news |newspaper= Durham Morning Herald |date=November 1, 1973}}</ref>\n\nAll his life, Barnes was ambivalent about his football experience.  In interviews and in personal appearances, Barnes said he hated the violence and the physical torment of the sport.  However, his years as an athlete gave him unique, in-depth observations.  \"(Wilson) told me to pay attention to what my body felt like in movement.  Within that elongation, there's a feeling.  And attitude and expression. I hate to think had I not played sports what my work would look like.\"<ref>Interview, \"Our World with Black Enterprise\"</ref>\n\nBarnes sold his first painting \"Slow Dance\" at age 21 in 1959 for $90 to [[Boston Celtics|Boston Celtic]] [[Sam Jones (basketball)|Sam Jones]].<ref name=\"ebbook\" />  It was subsequently lost in a fire at Jones' home.\n\nNumerous artists have been influenced by Barnes' art and unique style. Accordingly, several [[copyright infringement]] lawsuits have been settled and are currently pending.\n\n=== Framing ===\nErnie Barnes framed his paintings with distressed wood in homage to his father. In his 1995 autobiography, Barnes wrote of his father: \u201c... with so little education, he had worked so hard for us. His legacy to me was his effort, and that was plenty. He knew absolutely nothing about art.\u201d<ref name=\"ebbook\"/>\n\nWeeks before Ernie Barnes\u2019 first solo art exhibition in 1966, he was at the family home in Durham as his father lay in the hospital after suffering a [[stroke]]. He noticed the usually well-maintained white picketed fence had gone untended since his father\u2019s illness. Days later, Ernest E. Barnes Sr. died. \u201cI placed a painting against the fence and stood away and had a look. I was startled at the marriage between the old wood fence and the painting. It was perfect. In tribute, Daddy\u2019s fence would hug all my paintings in a prestigious New York gallery. That would have made him smile.\u201d<ref name=\"ebbook\"/>\n\n=== Eyes closed ===\nA consistent and distinct feature in Barnes' work is the closed eyes of his subjects.  \"It was in 1971 when I conceived the idea of ''The Beauty of the Ghetto'' as an exhibition.  And I showed it to some people who were Black to get a reaction.  And from one (person) it was very negative.  And when I began to express my points of view (to this) professional man, he resisted the notion. And as a result of his comments and his attitude I began to see, observe, how blind we are to one another's humanity.  Blinded by a lot of things that have, perhaps, initiated feelings in that light.  We don't see into the depths of our interconnection.  The gifts, the strength and potential within other human beings.  We stop at color quite often. So one of the things we have to be aware of is who we are in order to have the capacity to like others.  But when you cannot visualize the offerings of another human being you're obviously not looking at the human being with open eyes.\"<ref>Barnes, Ernie. Interview, \"Personal Diaries\" with Ed Gordon, BET, 1990</ref>  \"We look upon each other and decide immediately: This person is black, so he must be... This person lives in poverty, so he must be...\"<ref name=\"NSDaily12141990\" />\n\n=== Jewish community influence ===\nMoving to an all-Jewish neighborhood in Los Angeles known as the Fairfax District in 1971 was a major turning point in Barnes' life and art.\n \n\"Fairfax enlivened me to everyday life themes,\" he said, \"and forced me to look at my life - the way I had grown up, the customs within my community versus the customs in the Jewish community. Their customs were documented, ours were not. Because we were so clueless that our own culture had value and because of the phrase 'Black is Beautiful' had just come into fashion, Black people were just starting to appreciate themselves as a people. But when it was said, 'I'm Black and I'm Proud,' I said, 'proud of what?' And that question of 'proud of what' led to a series of paintings that became \u201cThe Beauty of the Ghetto.'\"\n\n=== \"The Beauty of the Ghetto\" exhibition ===\nIn response to the 1960s \"[[Black is beautiful]]\" cultural movement and [[James Brown]]'s 1968 \"Say it Loud: I'm Black and I'm Proud\" song, Barnes created ''The Beauty of the Ghetto'' exhibition of 35 paintings that toured major American cities from 1972 to 1979 hosted by dignitaries, professional athletes and celebrities.\n\nOf this exhibition, Barnes said, \"I am providing a pictorial background for an understanding into the aesthetics of black America.  It is not a plea to people to continue to live there (in the ghetto) but for those who feel trapped, it is...a challenge of how beautiful life can be.\"<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Atlanta Journal and Constitution |date=September 16, 1973}}</ref>\n\nWhen the exhibition was on view in 1974 at the [[National Museum of African Art|Museum of African Art]] in Washington, DC, Rep. [[John Conyers]] stressed the important positive message of the exhibit in the [[Congressional Record]].\n\n=== Sports art ===\nThe [[Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee]] named Barnes \"Sports Artist of the 1984 Olympic Games\".  LAOOC President [[Peter V. Ueberroth]] said Barnes and his art \"captured the essence of the [[Olympics]]\" and \"portray the city's ethnic diversity, the power and emotion of sports competition, the singleness of purpose and hopes that go into the making of athletes the world over.\" Barnes was commissioned to create five Olympic-themed paintings and serve as an official Olympic spokesman to encourage inner city youth.<ref name=\"LATimes03151984\">{{cite news |title=An Olympic Artist With A Message |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=May 24, 1984}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Long Beach Press Telegram |date=March 15, 1984}}</ref>\n\n1985:  Barnes was named the first \"Sports Artist of the Year\" by the [[United States Sports Academy]].<ref name=\"MobileReg03131985\" />\n\n1987:  Barnes created ''Fastbreak'', a commissioned painting of the World Champion [[Los Angeles Lakers]] basketball team that included [[Magic Johnson]], [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], [[James Worthy]], [[Kurt Rambis]] and [[Michael Cooper]].\n\n1996: [[Carolina Panthers]] football team owners Rosalind and [[Jerry Richardson]] (Barnes' former Colts teammate) commissioned Barnes to create the large painting ''Victory in Overtime'' (approximately 7&nbsp;ft. x 14&nbsp;ft.).  It was unveiled before the team's 1996 inaugural season and hangs permanently in the owner's suite at the stadium.  Richardson and Barnes were Baltimore Colts teammates briefly in 1960.\n\n1996:  To commemorate their 50th anniversary in 1996, the [[National Basketball Association]] commissioned Barnes to create a painting with the theme, \"Where we were, where we are, and where we are going.\"  The painting, ''The Dream Unfolds'' hangs in the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] in [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[Massachusetts]].  A limited edition of lithographs were made, with the first 50 prints going to each of the NBA's 50th Anniversary All-Time Team. \n\t\t\t\t\n2004:  Barnes was named \"America's Best Painter of Sports\" by the American Sport Art Museum & Archives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asama.org/awards-of-sport/medallion-series/sport-artist-of-the-year/ernie-barnes |title=1984 & 2004 Sports Artist of the Year, Ernie Barnes, America's El Greco| website= ASAMA.org| publisher= The American Sport Art Museum & Archives |accessdate= October 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nOther notable sports commissions include paintings for the [[New Orleans Saints]], [[Oakland Raiders]] and [[Boston Patriots]] football team owners.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.erniebarnes.com/biography.html |title= Biography |website= ErnieBarnes.com |accessdate= October 26, 2010 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20161216172615/http://www.erniebarnes.com/biography.html |archivedate= December 16, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n=== \"The Bench\" painting ===\nShortly after Barnes was drafted by the Baltimore Colts, Barnes was invited to see their [[1959 NFL Championship Game|Colts' NFL Championship Game]] vs. the [[New York Giants]] at [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]] in [[Maryland]] on December 27, 1959.  The Colts won 31-16 and Barnes was filled with layers of emotion after watching the game from the Colts' bench.  At age 21, he had just signed his football contract and met his new teammates [[Johnny Unitas]], [[Jim Parker (American football)|Jim Parker]], [[Lenny Moore]], [[Art Donovan]], [[Gino Marchetti]], [[Alan Ameche]] and [[Eugene Lipscomb|\"Big Daddy\" Lipscomb]].\n\nAfter he returned home, without making any preliminary sketches, he went directly to a blank canvas to record his point of view.  Using a palette knife, \"painting in quick, direct movements hoping to capture the vision...before it evaporated,\" Barnes said, he created \"The Bench\" in less than an hour.<ref name=\"ebbook\" />  Throughout his life, ''The Bench'' remained in Barnes' possession, even taking it with him to all his football training camps and hiding it under his bed. It would be the only painting Barnes would never sell, despite many substantial offers, including a $25,000 bid at his first show in 1966.\n\nIn 2014, Barnes' wife Bernie presented ''The Bench'' painting to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] for their permanent collection in Canton, Ohio.\n\n=== \"The Sugar Shack\" painting ===\nBarnes created the painting ''The Sugar Shack'' in 1971.

It was the second film produced by Pixar. Directed by [[John Lasseter]] and co-directed and written by [[Andrew Stanton]], the film involves a misfit ant, Flik, who is looking for \"tough warriors\" to save his colony from greedy grasshoppers, only to recruit a group of insects that turn out to be an inept circus troupe. The film stars the voices of [[Dave Foley]], [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] and [[Hayden Panettiere]] among others.\n\nThe film is inspired by [[Aesop]]'s fable ''[[The Ant and the Grasshopper]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/174122/A-Bug-s-Life/overview | title = A Bug's Life (1998) | last = Maslin | first = Janet | date = November 25, 1998 | work = The New York Times | accessdate = June 16, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160302204943/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/174122/A-Bug-s-Life/overview | archivedate = March 2, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = A Bug's Life \u2013 The Tale | url = https://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/abl/tale_pop1.html | website = pixar.com | publisher = Pixar | accessdate = July 24, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101205053510/https://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/abl/tale_pop1.html | archivedate = December 5, 2010}}</ref> Production began shortly after the release of ''[[Toy Story]]'' in 1995. The screenplay was penned by Stanton and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, and Ranft. The ants in the film were redesigned to be more appealing, and Pixar's animation unit employed technical innovations in computer animation. [[Randy Newman]] composed the music for the film. During production, a controversial public feud erupted between [[Steve Jobs]] and Lasseter of Pixar and [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] co-founder [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] due to the parallel production of his similar film ''[[Antz]]'', which was released the same year.\n\nThe film was released on November 25, 1998, and grossed $363&nbsp;million in receipts, receiving positive reviews from critics. It was the first film to be digitally transferred frame-by-frame and released to [[DVD]], and has been released multiple times on home video.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nAnt Island is a colony of ants led by the Queen and her daughter, Princess Atta. Every season, they are forced to give food to a gang of marauding grasshoppers led by Hopper. One day, when Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, inadvertently knocks the offering into a stream with his latest invention, a grain harvesting device, Hopper demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik suggests in earnest that they seek help from other stronger bugs, the other ants see it as an opportunity to remove him and send him off.\n\nAt the \"bug city\", which is a heap of trash under a trailer, Flik mistakes a troupe of Circus Bugs (who were recently dismissed by their greedy ringmaster, P.T. Flea) for the warrior bugs he seeks. The bugs, in turn, mistake Flik for a talent agent, and accept his offer to travel with him back to Ant Island. During a welcome ceremony upon their arrival, the Circus Bugs and Flik both discover their mutual misunderstandings. The Circus Bugs attempt to leave, but are attacked by a bird; while fleeing, they save Dot, Atta's younger sister, gaining the ants' respect in the process. At Flik's request, they continue the ruse of being \"warriors\", so the troupe can continue to enjoy the hospitality of the ants. Hearing that Hopper fears birds inspires Flik to create a false bird to scare away the grasshoppers. Meanwhile, Hopper tells his gang how greatly the ants outnumber them and worries that they will eventually rebel against them.\n\nThe ants finish constructing the fake bird, but during a celebration, P.T. Flea arrives, searching for his troupe, and inadvertently reveals their secret. Outraged by Flik's deception, the ants exile him, and desperately attempt to gather food for a new offering to the grasshoppers. However, when Hopper returns to discover the mediocre offering, he takes over the island, and demands the ants' winter food supply, planning to assassinate the Queen afterwards. Overhearing the plan, Dot persuades Flik and the Circus Bugs to return to Ant Island.\n\nAfter the Circus Bugs distract the grasshoppers long enough to rescue the Queen, Flik deploys the bird; it initially fools the grasshoppers, but P.T. Flea, who also mistakes it for a real bird, burns it, exposing it as a decoy. Hopper beats Flik in retaliation, saying that the ants are humble and lowly life forms who live to serve the grasshoppers. However, Flik responds that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of, inspiring the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers. The ants attempt to force Hopper out of Ant Island using P.T. Flea's circus cannon, but it suddenly begins to rain. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper frees himself from the cannon, and abducts Flik. After the Circus Bugs fail to catch them, Atta rescues Flik. As Hopper pursues them, Flik lures him to the nest of the bird he, Dot, and the Circus Bugs encountered earlier. Thinking that the bird is another decoy, Hopper taunts it before discovering in panic that it is real, and is captured and devoured by its chicks.\n\nWith their enemies gone, Flik has improved his inventions along with the quality of life for Ant Island, he and Atta become a couple, and they give Hopper's younger brother Molt, and a few ants to P.T. Flea as new members of his troupe. Atta and Dot respectively become the new queen and princess. The ants congratulate Flik as a hero, and bid a fond farewell to the circus troupe.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{anchor|Cast and characters|Cast}}\n* [[Dave Foley]] as Flik, an inventive, but mostly accident-prone, ant.\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Hopper, the ruthless leader of the grasshopper gang.\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Princess Atta, the soon-to-be queen of the colony.\n* [[Hayden Panettiere]] as Dot, Princess Atta's younger sister and initially Flik's only friend in the ant colony.\n* [[Phyllis Diller]] as the Queen, the leader of the ant colony.\n* [[Richard Kind]] as Molt, Hopper's dimwitted younger brother.\n* [[David Hyde Pierce]] as Slim, a walking stick and Francis and Heimlich's friend.\n* [[Joe Ranft]] as Heimlich, a plump, German-accented caterpillar who longs to be a butterfly.\n* [[Denis Leary]] as Francis, a short-tempered male ladybug who is constantly mistaken for a female.\n* [[Jonathan Harris]] as Manny, a praying mantis and magician in P.T.

Like toys, insects were within the reach of computer animation back then, due to their relatively simple surfaces. Stanton and Ranft wondered whether they could find a starting point in Aesop's fable ''The Ant and the Grasshopper''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> [[Walt Disney]] had produced his own version with a cheerier ending decades earlier in the 1934 short film ''[[The Grasshopper and the Ants (film)|The Grasshopper and the Ants]]''. In addition, [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] had considered producing a film in the late-1980s entitled ''Army Ants'', that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic colony, but this never fully materialized.<ref name=\"bw\">{{cite news | url = http://www.businessweek.com/1998/47/b3605013.htm | last1 = Burrows | first1 = Peter | title = ''Antz'' vs. ''Bugs'' | work = Business Week | date = November 23, 1998 | accessdate = March 7, 2017 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19991128083348/http://www.businessweek.com/1998/47/b3605013.htm | archivedate = November 28, 1999 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nAs Stanton and Ranft discussed the adaptation, they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> Lasseter liked the idea and offered some suggestions. The concept simmered until early 1995, when the story team began work on the second film in earnest.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> During an early test screening for ''[[Toy Story]]'' in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]] in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]]. Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early-July under the title ''Bugs''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\">Price, p. 159</ref> Lasseter assigned the co-director job to Stanton; both worked well together and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had realized that working on a computer-animated feature as a sole director was dangerous while the production of ''Toy Story'' was in process.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\"/> In addition, Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\">Price, p. 160</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nIn ''The Ant and the Grasshopper'', a grasshopper squanders the spring and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for food, but the ants turn him away.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just take the food.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/><ref name=\"inspiration\">Pixar Animation Studios, official website, feature films, ''A Bugs Life'', The inspiration</ref> After Stanton had completed a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story's main pillars \u2013 that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/> He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. Also, no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act.<ref name=commentary>''A Bugs Life'', DVD Commentary</ref> Although the film was already far along, Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/>\n\nStanton took one of the early circus bug characters, Red the [[red ant]], and changed him into the character Flik.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The Circus Bugs, no longer out to cheat the colony, would be embroiled in a comic misunderstanding as to why Flik was recruiting them. Lasseter agreed with this new approach, and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw spent a few months working on further polishing with Stanton.<ref name=\"PixarTouch05\">Price, p. 161</ref> The characters \"Tuck and Roll\" were inspired by a drawing that Stanton did of two bugs fighting when he was in the second grade.<ref name=\"inspiration\"/> Lasseter had come to envision the film as an [[epic film|epic]] in the tradition of [[David Lean]]'s 1962 film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''.<ref name=\"commentary\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nThe voice cast was heavy with television [[sitcom]] stars of the time: Flik was voiced by [[Dave Foley]] (from ''[[NewsRadio]]''), Princess Atta was voiced by [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] (from ''[[Seinfeld]]''), Molt was voiced by [[Richard Kind]] (from ''[[Spin City]]''), Slim was voiced by [[David Hyde Pierce]] (from ''[[Frasier]]'') and Dim was voiced by [[Brad Garrett]] (from ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''). [[Joe Ranft]], member of Pixar's story team, played Heimlich the caterpillar at the suggestion of Lasseter's wife, Nancy, who had heard him playing the character on a scratch vocal track.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\"/>\n\nThe casting of Hopper, the film's villain, proved problematic. Lasseter's top choice was [[Robert De Niro]], who repeatedly turned the part down, as did a succession of other actors.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\"/> [[Kevin Spacey]] met John Lasseter at the [[68th Academy Awards|1995 Academy Awards]] and Lasseter asked Spacey if he would be interested in doing the voice of Hopper. Spacey was delighted and signed on immediately.<ref name=commentary/>\n\n''A Bug's Life'' was the final film appearance of actor [[Roddy McDowall]], who played Mr. Soil, before dying shortly before the film's theatrical release.<ref name=\"Chicago Tribune\">{{cite web | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-11-25/features/9811250037_1_ant-colonies-bug-s-life-ant-hero | title = 'A Bug's Life | first = Michael | last = Wilmington | date = November 25, 1998 | work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | quote = The players\u2014whose colorful members include Madeline Kahn as Gypsy the moth, Michael McShane as the Hungarian pill bug brothers Tuck & Roll and, in his farewell appearance, Roddy McDowall as the grandfatherly Mr. Soil\u2014all help make \"Bug's Life\" special. | accessdate = January 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Art design and animation===\nIt was more difficult for animators during the production of ''A Bug's Life'' than that of ''Toy Story'', as computers ran sluggishly due to the complexity of the character models. Lasseter and Stanton had two supervising animators to assist with directing and reviewing the animation: Rich Quade and [[Glenn McQueen]]. The first sequence to be animated and rendered was the circus sequence that culminated with P.T. Flea's \"Flaming Wall of Death\". Lasseter placed this scene first in the pipeline because he believed it was \"less likely to change\".<ref name=\"PixarTouch11\"/> Lasseter thought it would be useful to look at a view of the world from an insect's perspective. Two technicians obliged by creating a miniature video camera on [[Lego]] wheels, which they dubbed as the \"Bugcam\".<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/><ref name=\"behind the scenes\">''A Bugs Life'', DVD Behind the Scenes</ref> Fastened to the end of a stick, the Bugcam could roll through grass and other terrain and send back an insect's-eye outlook. Lasseter was intrigued by the way grass, leaves, and flower petals formed a translucent canopy, as if the insects were living under a [[stained-glass]] ceiling. The team also later sought inspiration from ''[[Microcosmos (film)|Microcosmos]]'' (1996), a French documentary on love and violence in the insect world.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/>\n\nThe transition from treatment to storyboards took on an extra layer of complexity due to the profusion of storylines. Where ''Toy Story'' focused heavily on Woody and Buzz, with the other toys serving mostly as sidekicks, ''A Bug's Life'' required in-depth storytelling for several major groups of characters.<ref name=\"PixarTouch05\"/> Character design also presented a new challenge, in that the designers had to make ants appear likable. Although the animators and the art department studied insects more closely, natural realism would give way to the film's larger needs.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\">Price, p. 162</ref> The team took out mandibles and designed the ants to stand upright, replacing their normal six legs with two arms and two legs. The grasshoppers, in contrast, received a pair of extra appendages to appear less attractive.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/> The story's scale also required software engineers to accommodate new demands. Among these was the need to handle shots with crowds of ants.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/> The film would include more than 400 such shots in the ant colony, some with as many as 800. It was impractical for animators to control them individually, but neither could the ants remain static for even a moment without appearing lifeless, or move identically. Bill Reeves, one of the film's two supervising technical directors, dealt with the quandary by leading the development of software for autonomous ants.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/> The animators would only animate four or five groups of about eight individual \"universal ants\". Each one of these \"universal ants\" would later be randomly distributed throughout the digital set. The program also allowed each ant to be automatically modified in subtle ways (e.g. different color of eye or skin, different heights, different weights, etc.). This ensured that no two ants were the same.<ref name=\"behind the scenes\"/> It was partly based on Reeves's invention of particle systems a decade and a half earlier, which had let animators use masses of self-guided particles to create effects like swirling dust and snow.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\">Price, p. 163</ref>\n\nThe animators also employed [[subsurface scattering]]\u2014developed by Pixar co-founder [[Edwin Catmull]] during his graduate student days at the [[University of Utah]] in the 1970s\u2014to render surfaces in a more lifelike way. This would be the first time that subsurface scattering would be used in a Pixar film, and a small team at Pixar worked out the practical problems that kept it from working in animation. Catmull asked for a short film to test and showcase subsurface scattering and the result, ''[[Geri's Game]]'' (1997), was attached alongside ''A Bug's Life'' in its theatrical release.<ref name=\"PixarTouch12\">Price, p. 173</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nDuring the production of ''A Bug's Life'', a public feud erupted between [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]]' [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], and Pixar's [[Steve Jobs]] and John Lasseter. Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney's film division, had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael Eisner. In response, he formed DreamWorks SKG with [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[David Geffen]] and planned to rival Disney in animation.<ref name=\"Isaacson307\">{{cite book | last = Isaacson | first = Walter | title = [[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]] | publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] | location = New York | year = 2011 | page = [https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/307 307] | isbn = 1-4516-4853-7 }}</ref> After DreamWorks' acquisition of [[Pacific Data Images]] (PDI)\u2014long Pixar's contemporary in computer animation\u2014Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed to learn from the trade papers that PDI's first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called ''[[Antz]]''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch09\">Price, p. 170</ref> By this time, Pixar's project was well known within the animation community.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\">Price, p. 171</ref> Both ''Antz'' and ''A Bug's Life'' center on a young male ant, a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess's hand by saving their society. Whereas ''A Bug's Life'' relied chiefly on visual gags, ''Antz'' was more verbal and revolved more around satire. The script of ''Antz'' was also heavy with adult references, whereas Pixar's film was more accessible to children.<ref name=\"PixarTouch13\"/>\n\nIt was clear that Lasseter and Jobs believed that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg.<ref name=\"bw\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson307\"/> Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on ''Toy Story'' at the [[Universal Studios|Universal]] lot's [[Technicolor]] facility in [[Universal City, California|Universal City]], where DreamWorks was also located, he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton.<ref name=\"Isaacson307\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch08\"/> When Katzenberg asked what they were doing next, Lasseter described what would become ''A Bug's Life'' in detail.

It was the second film produced by Pixar. Directed by [[John Lasseter]] and co-directed and written by [[Andrew Stanton]], the film involves a misfit ant, Flik, who is looking for \"tough warriors\" to save his colony from greedy grasshoppers, only to recruit a group of insects that turn out to be an inept circus troupe. The film stars the voices of [[Dave Foley]], [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] and [[Hayden Panettiere]] among others.\n\nThe film is inspired by [[Aesop]]'s fable ''[[The Ant and the Grasshopper]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/174122/A-Bug-s-Life/overview | title = A Bug's Life (1998) | last = Maslin | first = Janet | date = November 25, 1998 | work = The New York Times | accessdate = June 16, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160302204943/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/174122/A-Bug-s-Life/overview | archivedate = March 2, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = A Bug's Life \u2013 The Tale | url = https://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/abl/tale_pop1.html | website = pixar.com | publisher = Pixar | accessdate = July 24, 2016 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101205053510/https://www.pixar.com/featurefilms/abl/tale_pop1.html | archivedate = December 5, 2010}}</ref> Production began shortly after the release of ''[[Toy Story]]'' in 1995. The screenplay was penned by Stanton and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw from a story by Lasseter, Stanton, and Ranft. The ants in the film were redesigned to be more appealing, and Pixar's animation unit employed technical innovations in computer animation. [[Randy Newman]] composed the music for the film. During production, a controversial public feud erupted between [[Steve Jobs]] and Lasseter of Pixar and [[DreamWorks Animation|DreamWorks]] co-founder [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] due to the parallel production of his similar film ''[[Antz]]'', which was released the same year.\n\nThe film was released on November 20, 1998, and grossed $363&nbsp;million in receipts, receiving positive reviews from critics. It was the first film to be digitally transferred frame-by-frame and released to [[DVD]], and has been released multiple times on home video.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\nAnt Island is a colony of ants led by the Queen and her daughter, Princess Atta. Every season, they are forced to give food to a gang of marauding grasshoppers led by Hopper. One day, when Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, inadvertently knocks the offering into a stream with his latest invention, a grain harvesting device, Hopper demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik suggests in earnest that they seek help from other stronger bugs, the other ants see it as an opportunity to remove him and send him off.\n\nAt the \"bug city\", which is a heap of trash under a trailer, Flik mistakes a troupe of Circus Bugs (who were recently dismissed by their greedy ringmaster, P.T. Flea) for the warrior bugs he seeks. The bugs, in turn, mistake Flik for a talent agent, and accept his offer to travel with him back to Ant Island. During a welcome ceremony upon their arrival, the Circus Bugs and Flik both discover their mutual misunderstandings. The Circus Bugs attempt to leave, but are attacked by a bird; while fleeing, they save Dot, Atta's younger sister, gaining the ants' respect in the process. At Flik's request, they continue the ruse of being \"warriors\", so the troupe can continue to enjoy the hospitality of the ants. Hearing that Hopper fears birds inspires Flik to create a false bird to scare away the grasshoppers. Meanwhile, Hopper tells his gang how greatly the ants outnumber them and worries that they will eventually rebel against them.\n\nThe ants finish constructing the fake bird, but during a celebration, P.T. Flea arrives, searching for his troupe, and inadvertently reveals their secret. Outraged by Flik's deception, the ants exile him, and desperately attempt to gather food for a new offering to the grasshoppers. However, when Hopper returns to discover the mediocre offering, he takes over the island, and demands the ants' winter food supply, planning to assassinate the Queen afterwards. Overhearing the plan, Dot persuades Flik and the Circus Bugs to return to Ant Island.\n\nAfter the Circus Bugs distract the grasshoppers long enough to rescue the Queen, Flik deploys the bird; it initially fools the grasshoppers, but P.T. Flea, who also mistakes it for a real bird, burns it, exposing it as a decoy. Hopper beats Flik in retaliation, saying that the ants are humble and lowly life forms who live to serve the grasshoppers. However, Flik responds that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of, inspiring the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers. The ants attempt to force Hopper out of Ant Island using P.T. Flea's circus cannon, but it suddenly begins to rain. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper frees himself from the cannon, and abducts Flik. After the Circus Bugs fail to catch them, Atta rescues Flik. As Hopper pursues them, Flik lures him to the nest of the bird he, Dot, and the Circus Bugs encountered earlier. Thinking that the bird is another decoy, Hopper taunts it before discovering in panic that it is real, and is captured and devoured by its chicks.\n\nWith their enemies gone, Flik has improved his inventions along with the quality of life for Ant Island, he and Atta become a couple, and they give Hopper's younger brother Molt, and a few ants to P.T. Flea as new members of his troupe. Atta and Dot respectively become the new queen and princess. The ants congratulate Flik as a hero, and bid a fond farewell to the circus troupe.\n\n==Voice cast==\n{{anchor|Cast and characters|Cast}}\n* [[Dave Foley]] as Flik, an inventive, but mostly accident-prone, ant.\n* [[Kevin Spacey]] as Hopper, the ruthless leader of the grasshopper gang.\n* [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] as Princess Atta, the soon-to-be queen of the colony.\n* [[Hayden Panettiere]] as Dot, Princess Atta's younger sister and initially Flik's only friend in the ant colony.\n* [[Phyllis Diller]] as the Queen, the leader of the ant colony.\n* [[Richard Kind]] as Molt, Hopper's dimwitted younger brother.\n* [[David Hyde Pierce]] as Slim, a walking stick and Francis and Heimlich's friend.\n* [[Joe Ranft]] as Heimlich, a plump, German-accented caterpillar who longs to be a butterfly.\n* [[Denis Leary]] as Francis, a short-tempered male ladybug who is constantly mistaken for a female.\n* [[Jonathan Harris]] as Manny, a praying mantis and magician in P.T.

Like toys, insects were within the reach of computer animation back then, due to their relatively simple surfaces. Stanton and Ranft wondered whether they could find a starting point in Aesop's fable ''The Ant and the Grasshopper''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> [[Walt Disney]] had produced his own version with a cheerier ending decades earlier in the 1934 short film ''[[The Grasshopper and the Ants (film)|The Grasshopper and the Ants]]''. In addition, [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]] had considered producing a film in the late-1980s entitled ''Army Ants'', that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic colony, but this never fully materialized.<ref name=\"bw\">{{cite news | url = http://www.businessweek.com/1998/47/b3605013.htm | last1 = Burrows | first1 = Peter | title = ''Antz'' vs. ''Bugs'' | work = Business Week | date = November 23, 1998 | accessdate = March 7, 2017 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19991128083348/http://www.businessweek.com/1998/47/b3605013.htm | archivedate = November 28, 1999 | url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nAs Stanton and Ranft discussed the adaptation, they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> Lasseter liked the idea and offered some suggestions. The concept simmered until early 1995, when the story team began work on the second film in earnest.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> During an early test screening for ''[[Toy Story]]'' in [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]] in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]]. Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early-July under the title ''Bugs''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\">Price, p. 159</ref> Lasseter assigned the co-director job to Stanton; both worked well together and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had realized that working on a computer-animated feature as a sole director was dangerous while the production of ''Toy Story'' was in process.<ref name=\"PixarTouch03\"/> In addition, Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\">Price, p. 160</ref>\n\n===Writing===\nIn ''The Ant and the Grasshopper'', a grasshopper squanders the spring and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for food, but the ants turn him away.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/> Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just take the food.<ref name=\"PixarTouch02\"/><ref name=\"inspiration\">Pixar Animation Studios, official website, feature films, ''A Bugs Life'', The inspiration</ref> After Stanton had completed a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story's main pillars \u2013 that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/> He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. Also, no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act.<ref name=commentary>''A Bugs Life'', DVD Commentary</ref> Although the film was already far along, Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/>\n\nStanton took one of the early circus bug characters, Red the [[red ant]], and changed him into the character Flik.<ref name=\"commentary\"/> The Circus Bugs, no longer out to cheat the colony, would be embroiled in a comic misunderstanding as to why Flik was recruiting them. Lasseter agreed with this new approach, and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw spent a few months working on further polishing with Stanton.<ref name=\"PixarTouch05\">Price, p. 161</ref> The characters \"Tuck and Roll\" were inspired by a drawing that Stanton did of two bugs fighting when he was in the second grade.<ref name=\"inspiration\"/> Lasseter had come to envision the film as an [[epic film|epic]] in the tradition of [[David Lean]]'s 1962 film ''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]''.<ref name=\"commentary\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/>\n\n===Casting===\nThe voice cast was heavy with television [[sitcom]] stars of the time: Flik was voiced by [[Dave Foley]] (from ''[[NewsRadio]]''), Princess Atta was voiced by [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] (from ''[[Seinfeld]]''), Molt was voiced by [[Richard Kind]] (from ''[[Spin City]]''), Slim was voiced by [[David Hyde Pierce]] (from ''[[Frasier]]'') and Dim was voiced by [[Brad Garrett]] (from ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''). [[Joe Ranft]], member of Pixar's story team, played Heimlich the caterpillar at the suggestion of Lasseter's wife, Nancy, who had heard him playing the character on a scratch vocal track.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\"/>\n\nThe casting of Hopper, the film's villain, proved problematic. Lasseter's top choice was [[Robert De Niro]], who repeatedly turned the part down, as did a succession of other actors.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\"/> [[Kevin Spacey]] met John Lasseter at the [[68th Academy Awards|1995 Academy Awards]] and Lasseter asked Spacey if he would be interested in doing the voice of Hopper. Spacey was delighted and signed on immediately.<ref name=commentary/>\n\n''A Bug's Life'' was the final film appearance of actor [[Roddy McDowall]], who played Mr. Soil, before dying shortly before the film's theatrical release.<ref name=\"Chicago Tribune\">{{cite web | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-11-25/features/9811250037_1_ant-colonies-bug-s-life-ant-hero | title = 'A Bug's Life | first = Michael | last = Wilmington | date = November 25, 1998 | work = [[Chicago Tribune]] | quote = The players\u2014whose colorful members include Madeline Kahn as Gypsy the moth, Michael McShane as the Hungarian pill bug brothers Tuck & Roll and, in his farewell appearance, Roddy McDowall as the grandfatherly Mr. Soil\u2014all help make \"Bug's Life\" special. | accessdate = January 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Art design and animation===\nIt was more difficult for animators during the production of ''A Bug's Life'' than that of ''Toy Story'', as computers ran sluggishly due to the complexity of the character models. Lasseter and Stanton had two supervising animators to assist with directing and reviewing the animation: Rich Quade and [[Glenn McQueen]]. The first sequence to be animated and rendered was the circus sequence that culminated with P.T. Flea's \"Flaming Wall of Death\". Lasseter placed this scene first in the pipeline because he believed it was \"less likely to change\".<ref name=\"PixarTouch11\"/> Lasseter thought it would be useful to look at a view of the world from an insect's perspective. Two technicians obliged by creating a miniature video camera on [[Lego]] wheels, which they dubbed as the \"Bugcam\".<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/><ref name=\"behind the scenes\">''A Bugs Life'', DVD Behind the Scenes</ref> Fastened to the end of a stick, the Bugcam could roll through grass and other terrain and send back an insect's-eye outlook. Lasseter was intrigued by the way grass, leaves, and flower petals formed a translucent canopy, as if the insects were living under a [[stained-glass]] ceiling. The team also later sought inspiration from ''[[Microcosmos (film)|Microcosmos]]'' (1996), a French documentary on love and violence in the insect world.<ref name=\"PixarTouch04\"/>\n\nThe transition from treatment to storyboards took on an extra layer of complexity due to the profusion of storylines. Where ''Toy Story'' focused heavily on Woody and Buzz, with the other toys serving mostly as sidekicks, ''A Bug's Life'' required in-depth storytelling for several major groups of characters.<ref name=\"PixarTouch05\"/> Character design also presented a new challenge, in that the designers had to make ants appear likable. Although the animators and the art department studied insects more closely, natural realism would give way to the film's larger needs.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\">Price, p. 162</ref> The team took out mandibles and designed the ants to stand upright, replacing their normal six legs with two arms and two legs. The grasshoppers, in contrast, received a pair of extra appendages to appear less attractive.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/> The story's scale also required software engineers to accommodate new demands. Among these was the need to handle shots with crowds of ants.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/> The film would include more than 400 such shots in the ant colony, some with as many as 800. It was impractical for animators to control them individually, but neither could the ants remain static for even a moment without appearing lifeless, or move identically. Bill Reeves, one of the film's two supervising technical directors, dealt with the quandary by leading the development of software for autonomous ants.<ref name=\"PixarTouch06\"/> The animators would only animate four or five groups of about eight individual \"universal ants\". Each one of these \"universal ants\" would later be randomly distributed throughout the digital set. The program also allowed each ant to be automatically modified in subtle ways (e.g. different color of eye or skin, different heights, different weights, etc.). This ensured that no two ants were the same.<ref name=\"behind the scenes\"/> It was partly based on Reeves's invention of particle systems a decade and a half earlier, which had let animators use masses of self-guided particles to create effects like swirling dust and snow.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\">Price, p. 163</ref>\n\nThe animators also employed [[subsurface scattering]]\u2014developed by Pixar co-founder [[Edwin Catmull]] during his graduate student days at the [[University of Utah]] in the 1970s\u2014to render surfaces in a more lifelike way. This would be the first time that subsurface scattering would be used in a Pixar film, and a small team at Pixar worked out the practical problems that kept it from working in animation. Catmull asked for a short film to test and showcase subsurface scattering and the result, ''[[Geri's Game]]'' (1997), was attached alongside ''A Bug's Life'' in its theatrical release.<ref name=\"PixarTouch12\">Price, p. 173</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nDuring the production of ''A Bug's Life'', a public feud erupted between [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]]' [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], and Pixar's [[Steve Jobs]] and John Lasseter. Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney's film division, had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael Eisner. In response, he formed DreamWorks SKG with [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[David Geffen]] and planned to rival Disney in animation.<ref name=\"Isaacson307\">{{cite book | last = Isaacson | first = Walter | title = [[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]] | publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] | location = New York | year = 2011 | page = [https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/307 307] | isbn = 1-4516-4853-7 }}</ref> After DreamWorks' acquisition of [[Pacific Data Images]] (PDI)\u2014long Pixar's contemporary in computer animation\u2014Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed to learn from the trade papers that PDI's first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called ''[[Antz]]''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch09\">Price, p. 170</ref> By this time, Pixar's project was well known within the animation community.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\">Price, p. 171</ref> Both ''Antz'' and ''A Bug's Life'' center on a young male ant, a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess's hand by saving their society. Whereas ''A Bug's Life'' relied chiefly on visual gags, ''Antz'' was more verbal and revolved more around satire. The script of ''Antz'' was also heavy with adult references, whereas Pixar's film was more accessible to children.<ref name=\"PixarTouch13\"/>\n\nIt was clear that Lasseter and Jobs believed that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg.<ref name=\"bw\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson307\"/> Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on ''Toy Story'' at the [[Universal Studios|Universal]] lot's [[Technicolor]] facility in [[Universal City, California|Universal City]], where DreamWorks was also located, he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton.<ref name=\"Isaacson307\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch08\"/> When Katzenberg asked what they were doing next, Lasseter described what would become ''A Bug's Life'' in detail. Lasseter respected Katzenberg's judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative ideas.<ref name=\"PixarTouch08\">Price, p. 169</ref> Lasseter had high hopes for ''Toy Story'', and he was telling friends throughout the tight-knit computer-animation business to get cracking on their own films. \"If this hits, it's going to be like space movies after ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''\" for computer animation companies, he told various friends.<ref name=\"bw\"/> \"I should have been wary,\" Lasseter later recalled. \"Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released.\"<ref name=\"Isaacson307\"/>\n\nWhen the trades indicated production on ''Antz'', Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg and asked him bluntly if it were true, who in turn asked him where he had heard the rumor. Lasseter asked again, and Katzenberg admitted it was true. Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg's story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago. Katzenberg claimed ''Antz'' came from a 1991 story pitch by [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim Johnson]] that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994.<ref name=\"bw\"/> Another source gives [[Nina Jacobson]], one of Katzenberg's executives, as the person responsible for the ''Antz'' pitch.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/> Lasseter, who normally did not use profane language, cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the phone.<ref name=\"Isaacson308\">{{cite book | last = Isaacson | first = Walter | title = [[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]] | publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] | location = New York | year = 2011 | page = [https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/308 308] | isbn = 1-4516-4853-7 }}</ref> Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was \"out to get him\" and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg's fight with Disney.<ref name=\"bw\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/> For his part, Katzenberg believed he was the victim of a conspiracy: Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney's board not to give him anything.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/> Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled ''Bugs'' to open the same week as ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'', which was then intended to be DreamWorks' first animated release.<ref name=\"PixarTouch10\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson308\"/> Lasseter grimly relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high.

Katzenberg made an offer: He would delay production of ''Antz'' if Jobs and Disney would move ''A Bug's Life'' so that it did not compete with ''The Prince of Egypt''. Jobs believed it \"a blatant [[Extortion|extortion attempt]]\" and would not go for it, explaining that there was nothing he could do to convince Disney to change the date.<ref name=\"bw\"/><ref name=\"Isaacson308\"/> Katzenberg casually responded that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar's rescue by making the deal for ''Toy Story'', as Pixar was near bankruptcy at that time.<ref name=\"PixarTouch07\"/> \"I was the one guy there for you back then, and now you're allowing them to use you to screw me,\" Katzenberg said.<ref name=\"Isaacson308\"/> He suggested that if Jobs wanted to, he could simply slow down production on ''A Bug's Life'' without telling Disney.

Regardless, Lasseter publicly dismissed ''Antz'' as a \"schlock version\" of ''A Bug's Life''.<ref name=\"PixarTouch12\"/> Lasseter, who claimed to have never seen ''Antz'', told others that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than insects, he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see it.<ref name=\"bw\"/><ref name=\"PixarTouch13\">Price, p. 174</ref> Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press frenzy. \"The bad guys rarely win,\" Jobs told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. In response, DreamWorks' head of marketing Terry Press suggested, \"Steve Jobs should take a pill.\"<ref name=\"Isaacson308\"/> Despite the successful box office performance of both ''Antz'' and ''A Bug's Life'', tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many years. According to Jobs, Katzenberg came to Jobs after the success of ''[[Shrek]]'' (2001) and insisted he had never heard the pitch for ''A Bug's Life'', reasoning that his settlement with Disney would have given him a share of the profits if that were so.<ref name=\"Isaacson309\">{{cite book | last = Isaacson | first = Walter | title = [[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]] | publisher = [[Simon & Schuster]] | location = New York | year = 2011 | page = [https://archive.org/details/stevejobs00isaa/page/309 309] | isbn = 1-4516-4853-7 }}</ref> Although the contention left all parties estranged, Pixar and PDI employees kept up the old friendships that had arisen from spending a long time together in computer animation.<ref name=\"PixarTouch11\"/>\n\n==Music==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = A Bug's Life: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack\n| type       = soundtrack\n| artist     = [[Randy Newman]]\n| cover      =\n| alt        =\n| released   = October 27, 1998\n| recorded   = 1998\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Film score|Score]]\n| length     = 47:32\n| label      = [[Walt Disney Records|Walt Disney]]\n| producer   =\n| chronology = [[Randy Newman]]\n| prev_title = [[Michael (1996 film)|Michael]]\n| prev_year  = 1996\n| next_title = [[Pleasantville (soundtrack)|Pleasantville]]\n| next_year  = 1998\n| misc       = {{Extra chronology\n | artist     = [[Pixar]] soundtrack\n | type       = film\n | prev_title = [[Toy Story#Soundtrack|Toy Story]]\n | prev_year  = 1995\n | title      = A Bug's Life\n | year       = 1998\n | next_title = [[Toy Story 2 (soundtrack)|Toy Story 2]]\n | next_year  = 1999\n}}\n}}\nThe film's score was composed and conducted by [[Randy Newman]].

The University is a combination of two smaller institutes formed earlier, after the departments were gradually raised to a degree level starting from 1996. The official slogan of the university is [http://www.bdu.edu.et/sites/default/files/Finalized%20Strategic%20Plan.pdf \"Wisdom at the source of the Blue Nile\"] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bdu.edu.et |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918140650/http://www.bdu.edu.et/ |archivedate=2010-09-18 }}</ref> The University is composed of five colleges, four institutes, seven faculties, two academies and one school.\n\n==Sports==\nThe Bahir Dar University has a 15,000-capacity stadium on its campus, named Bahir Dar University Stadium, in [[Bahir Dar]]. It is used mostly for association football matches. It is also sometimes used for athletics.\n\n==Establishment==\nBahir Dar University was created from the merger of two former higher institutions. The first was Bahir Dar Polytechnic Institute, which formed one of the faculties of the University, was established in 1963 under the technical cooperation between the Government of [[USSR]] and the [[Politics of Ethiopia|Imperial Government of Ethiopia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bdu.edu.et/sites/default/files/A%20Brief%20History%20of%20BDU.pdf|title=A Brief History of Bahir Dar University|last=Ayele|first=Fantahun|date=2013|website=bdu.edu.et|access-date=}}</ref> The objective of the institute was to train skilled technicians in the fields of Agro-Mechanics, Industrial Chemistry and Metal, [[Textile]], Electrical and [[Wood]] Technologies. The Institute had to undergo number of program changes within the area of technology until the commencement of the Engineering degree program 1996. Throughout these program changes, the institute did all what it could to supply the labor market with the best technicians who are now running most of the businesses in the industrial, educational, agricultural and other sectors.\n\nThe other institution of higher learning was Bahir Dar Teachers College, which had been established more than three decades ago. Its original name was the Academy of Pedagogy, and it was created in 1972 by the tripartite agreement of the Imperial Government, [[UNESCO]], and [[UNDP]] and started actual work in the following year under the auspices of the Ministry of Education and Fine Arts. Its general objective was to train multi-purpose primary education professionals capable of adopting primary education to rural life and rural development. Its specific objectives were to train primary school teacher trainers, supervisors, educational leaders, adult education organizers and community development agents.\n\nSoon after its beginning, however, the program only focused on offering pedagogics as a major area of study and [[Amharic language|Amharic]], English, Geography and Mathematics as minor courses. Later, diploma programs were introduced when in 1996 the diploma offering departments were raised to degree level. All in all the college provided instructors to the different levels of the education sector through its regular and extension programs.\n\nThe two institutions were integrated into Bahir Dar University following the Council of Ministers regulation no. 60/1999.

The University is a combination of two smaller institutes formed earlier, after the departments were gradually raised to a degree level starting from 1996.

It is used mostly for association football matches. It is also sometimes used for athletics.\n\n==Establishment==\nBahir Dar University was created from the merger of two former higher institutions. The first was Bahir Dar Polytechnic Institute, which formed one of the faculties of the University, was established in 1963 under the technical cooperation between the Government of [[USSR]] and the [[Politics of Ethiopia|Imperial Government of Ethiopia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bdu.edu.et/sites/default/files/A%20Brief%20History%20of%20BDU.pdf|title=A Brief History of Bahir Dar University|last=Ayele|first=Fantahun|date=2013|website=bdu.edu.et|access-date=}}</ref> The objective of the institute was to train skilled technicians in the fields of Agro-Mechanics, Industrial Chemistry and Metal, [[Textile]], Electrical and [[Wood]] Technologies. The Institute had to undergo number of program changes within the area of technology until the commencement of the Engineering degree program 1996. Throughout these program changes, the institute did all what it could to supply the labor market with the best technicians who are now running most of the businesses in the industrial, educational, agricultural and other sectors.\n\nThe other institution of higher learning was Bahir Dar Teachers College, which had been established more than three decades ago. Its original name was the Academy of Pedagogy, and it was created in 1972 by the tripartite agreement of the Imperial Government, [[UNESCO]], and [[UNDP]] and started actual work in the following year under the auspices of the Ministry of Education and Fine Arts. Its general objective was to train multi-purpose primary education professionals capable of adopting primary education to rural life and rural development. Its specific objectives were to train primary school teacher trainers, supervisors, educational leaders, adult education organizers and community development agents.\n\nSoon after its beginning, however, the program only focused on offering pedagogics as a major area of study and [[Amharic language|Amharic]], English, Geography and Mathematics as minor courses. Later, diploma programs were introduced when in 1996 the diploma offering departments were raised to degree level. All in all the college provided instructors to the different levels of the education sector through its regular and extension programs.\n\nThe two institutions were integrated into Bahir Dar University following the Council of Ministers regulation no. 60/1999. The University was inaugurated on May 6, 2000, and the Polytechnic Institute and the Teachers College became the Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Education, respectively. In addition, the university added two more faculties, that of Business and Economics and the faculty of Law, which were established in 2001 and 2003 respectively.
