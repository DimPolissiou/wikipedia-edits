A year later, women in Kansas City founded the first alumnae chapter (now known as professional chapters), followed by women in Des Moines and Indianapolis.\n\n[[World War I]] brought more women into newspaper jobs as their male colleagues went to battle. Theta Sigma Phi member [[Alice Rohe]] was a [[United Press]] reporter in Rome; [[Bessie Beatty]] of the ''[[San Francisco Bulletin]]'' and [[Sigrid Schultz]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' reported from Germany as the war ended. But in the postwar economic slump, hostility against \"women in men's jobs\" ran high. Many editors relegated women to society pages instead of \"hard news.\"\n\nAlthough women gained the right to vote in 1920, support lagged for other reforms. Ruby Black, who was national president, editor of ''The Matrix'' and the first manager of an employment bureau for members, noted in 1931 that female journalists couldn't get reporting jobs at the same pay as similarly qualified men.\n\nTheta Sigma Phi strengthened as a national network during the 1930s. The association hired a professional director and founded a national office in 1934. It inaugurated the Headliner Awards in 1939 to honor members who had made outstanding contributions to the field. The group gave [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] honorary membership for her efforts to aid female communicators. The First Lady's most notable action was to close her news conferences to male reporters. Mrs. Roosevelt contributed several articles to ''The Matrix''.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBy 1940, Theta Sigma Phi had 39 chapters, and [[World War II]] was expanding opportunities for women. But inequality persisted, and women were regarded as temporary or less-serious workers.
