In November 1914, the [[Ottoman Empire]] entered the war on the side of the Central Powers, opening fronts in the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus]], [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]], and the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Sinai Peninsula]]. The war was fought in and drew upon each power's colonial empire as well, spreading the conflict to [[African theatre of World War I|Africa]] and across the globe. The Entente and its allies would eventually become known as the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], while the grouping of Austria-Hungary, Germany and their allies would become known as the [[Central Powers]].\n\nThe German advance into France was halted at the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] and by the end of 1914, the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] settled into a [[battle of attrition]], marked by a long series of [[trench warfare|trench lines]] that changed little until 1917 (the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], by contrast, was marked by much greater exchanges of territory). In 1915, Italy joined the Allied Powers and opened a [[Alpine Front|front in the Alps]]. [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] joined the Central Powers in 1915 and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] joined the Allies in 1917, expanding the [[Balkans Campaign (World War I)|war in the Balkans]]. The United States initially remained neutral, though even while neutral it became an important supplier of war [[materiel]] to the Allies. Eventually, after the sinking of American merchant ships by German submarines, the declaration by Germany that its navy would resume unrestricted attacks on neutral shipping, and [[Zimmermann Telegram|the revelation]] that Germany was trying to incite Mexico to make war on the United States, the [[American entry into World War I|U.S. declared war on Germany]] on 6{{nbsp}}April 1917. Trained American forces would not begin arriving at the front in large numbers until mid-1918, but ultimately the [[American Expeditionary Forces|American Expeditionary Force]] would reach some two million troops.<ref>Edward M.

The 1917 [[February Revolution]] in Russia replaced the [[Tsarist autocracy]] with the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], but continuing discontent with the cost of the war led to the [[October Revolution]], the creation of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Socialist Republic]], and the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] by the new government in March 1918, ending Russia's involvement in the war. This allowed the transfer of large numbers of German troops from the East to the Western Front, resulting in the [[Spring Offensive|German March 1918 Offensive]]. This offensive was initially successful, but failed to score a decisive victory and exhausted the last of the German reserves. The Allies rallied and drove the Germans back in their [[Hundred Days Offensive]], a continual series of attacks to which the Germans had no reply.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sheffield |first1=Gary |title=Forgotten Victory |date=2002 |publisher=Review |isbn=978-0747271574 |page=251}}</ref> Bulgaria was the first Central Power to sign an armistice\u2014the [[Armistice of Salonica]] on 29 September 1918.

Victory in the 1866 [[Austro-Prussian War]] established Prussian hegemony in Germany, while victory over France in the 1870\u20131871 [[Franco-Prussian War]] [[Unification of Germany|unified]] the German states into a [[German Empire|German Reich]] under Prussian leadership.\n\nIn 1873, to isolate France and avoid a war on two fronts, Bismarck negotiated the [[League of the Three Emperors]] (German: ''Dreikaiserbund'') between Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. Concerned by Russia's victory in the 1877\u20131878 [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878|Russo-Turkish War]] and their influence in the [[Balkans]], the League was dissolved in 1878, with Germany and Austria-Hungary subsequently forming the 1879 [[Dual Alliance, 1879|Dual Alliance]]; this became the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] when Italy joined in 1882.<ref>{{cite book |first=H.

Germany and Austria-Hungary relied on faster mobilisation to compensate for fewer numbers; it was concern at the closing of this gap that led to the end of the naval race, rather than a reduction in tension elsewhere. When Germany expanded its standing army by 170,000 men in 1913, France extended compulsory military service from two to three years; similar measures taken by the [[Balkans|Balkan powers]] and Italy led to increased expenditure by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and Austria-Hungary. Absolute figures are hard to calculate, due to differences in categorising expenditure, while they often omit civilian infrastructure projects with a military use, such as railways. However, from 1908 to 1913, defence spending by the six major European powers increased by over 50% in real terms.{{sfn|Stevenson|2016|p=42}}\n\n===Conflicts in the Balkans===\n[[File:1908-10-07 - Moritz Schiller's Delicatessen.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of large white building with one signs saying \"Moritz Schiller\" and another in Arabic; in front is a cluster of people looking at poster on the wall.|Sarajevo citizens reading a poster with the proclamation of the [[Bosnian Crisis|Austrian annexation in 1908]]]]\n\nIn October 1908, Austria-Hungary precipitated the [[Bosnian crisis]] of 1908\u20131909 by officially annexing the former Ottoman territory of [[Bosnia Vilayet|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which it [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|had occupied]] since 1878. This angered the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and its patron, the [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Russian Empire]].

When Bulgaria attacked Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it sparked the 33-day [[Second Balkan War]], by the end of which it lost most of [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] to Serbia and Greece, and [[Southern Dobruja]] to Romania, further destabilising the region.{{sfn|Willmott |2003 |pp=2\u201323}} The [[Great Powers]] were able to keep these Balkan conflicts contained, but the next one would spread throughout Europe and beyond.\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Sarajevo assassination===\n{{Main|Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand}}\n[[File:Gavrilo Princip captured in Sarajevo 1914.jpg|thumb |This picture is usually associated with the arrest of [[Gavrilo Princip]], although some<ref name=\"FinestoneMassie\">{{cite book |first1=Jeffrey |last1=Finestone |first2=Robert K. |last2=Massie |title=The last courts of Europe |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=-1cvAAAAMAAJ |page=247}} |year=1981 |publisher=Dent |page=247}}</ref>{{sfn|Smith |2010}} believe it depicts Ferdinand Behr, a bystander.]]\n\nOn 28 June 1914, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], heir presumptive to the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], visited the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] capital, [[Sarajevo]].

The political objective of the assassination was to break off Austria-Hungary's South Slav provinces, which Austria-Hungary had annexed from the Ottoman Empire, so they could be combined into a Yugoslavia.\n\n\u010cabrinovi\u0107 threw a [[hand grenade|grenade]] at the car, but missed.

With a pistol, Princip shot and killed Ferdinand and his wife [[Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg|Sophie]]. Although they were reportedly not personally close, the Emperor [[Franz Joseph of Austria|Franz Joseph]] was profoundly shocked and upset.

[[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George's]] War Cabinet considered the German offer to be a ploy to create divisions amongst the Allies. After initial outrage and much deliberation, they took Wilson's note as a separate effort, signalling that the United States was on the verge of entering the war against Germany following the \"submarine outrages\". While the Allies debated a response to Wilson's offer, the Germans chose to rebuff it in favour of \"a direct exchange of views\". Learning of the German response, the Allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 January. They sought restoration of damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for France, Russia and Romania, and a recognition of the principle of nationalities.{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |p=345}} This included the liberation of Italians, Slavs, Romanians, Czecho-Slovaks, and the creation of a \"free and united Poland\".{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |p=345}} On the question of security, the Allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement.{{sfn |Kernek |1970 |pp=721\u2013766}} The negotiations failed and the Entente powers rejected the German offer on the grounds that Germany had not put forward any specific proposals.\n\n===1917\u20131918===\nEvents of 1917 proved decisive in ending the war, although their effects were not fully felt until 1918.\n\n====Developments in 1917====\n[[File:Guetteur au poste de l'\u00e9cluse 26.jpg|thumb|upright|left|French Army lookout at his observation post, [[Haut-Rhin]], France, 1917]]\n\nThe British naval blockade began to have a serious impact on Germany. In response, in February 1917, the [[German General Staff]] convinced [[Chancellor]] Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg to declare unrestricted submarine warfare, with the goal of starving Britain out of the war. German planners estimated that unrestricted submarine warfare would cost Britain a monthly shipping loss of 600,000 tons. The General Staff acknowledged that the policy would almost certainly bring the United States into the conflict, but calculated that British shipping losses would be so high that they would be forced to sue for peace after five to six months, before American intervention could have an effect. Tonnage sunk rose above 500,000&nbsp;tons per month from February to July. It peaked at 860,000&nbsp;tons in April. After July, the newly re-introduced [[convoy]] system became effective in reducing the U-boat threat. Britain was safe from starvation, while German industrial output fell, and the United States joined the war far earlier than Germany had anticipated.\n\nOn 3 May 1917, during the Nivelle Offensive, the French 2nd Colonial Division, veterans of the Battle of Verdun, refused orders, arriving drunk and without their weapons. Their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division, and harsh measures were not immediately implemented. The French Army Mutinies eventually spread to a further 54 French divisions, and 20,000 men deserted. However, appeals to patriotism and duty, as well as mass arrests and trials, encouraged the soldiers to return to defend their trenches, although the French soldiers refused to participate in further offensive action.<ref>Marshall, 292.</ref> [[Robert Nivelle]] was removed from command by 15 May, replaced by General [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]], who suspended bloody large-scale attacks.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1983-0323-501, Kriegskinematograph im Sch\u00fctzengraben.jpg|thumb|German<!--UFA?--> film crew recording the action]]\n\nThe victory of the Central Powers at the Battle of Caporetto led the Allies to convene the [[Rapallo Conference]] at which they formed the [[Supreme War Council]] to co-ordinate planning. Previously, British and French armies had operated under separate commands.\n\nIn December, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia, thus freeing large numbers of German troops for use in the west. With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western Front. The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success based on a final quick offensive. Furthermore, both sides became increasingly fearful of social unrest and revolution in Europe. Thus, both sides urgently sought a decisive victory.{{sfn|Heyman |1997 |pp=146\u2013147}}\n\nIn 1917, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]] secretly attempted separate peace negotiations with Clemenceau, through his wife's brother [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma|Sixtus]] in Belgium as an intermediary, without the knowledge of Germany.

They were replaced by Indian Army units. During several months of reorganisation and training of the summer, a [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign#Summer front line operations|number of attacks]] were carried out on sections of the Ottoman front line. These pushed the front line north to more advantageous positions for the Entente in preparation for an attack and to acclimatise the newly arrived Indian Army infantry. It was not until the middle of September that the integrated force was ready for large-scale operations.\n\nThe reorganised Egyptian Expeditionary Force, with an additional mounted division, broke Ottoman forces at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]] in September 1918.

The Desert Mounted Corps rode through the break in the front line created by the infantry.

Germany did this realising it would mean American entry. The German Foreign Minister, in the [[Zimmermann Telegram]], invited Mexico to join the war as Germany's ally against the United States. In return, the Germans would finance Mexico's war and help it recover the territories of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.{{sfn |Tuchman |1966}} The United Kingdom intercepted the message and presented it to the US embassy in the UK. From there it made its way to President Wilson who released the Zimmermann note to the public, and Americans saw it as ''[[casus belli]]''. Wilson called on anti-war elements to end all wars, by winning this one and eliminating militarism from the globe. He argued that the war was so important that the US had to have a voice in the peace conference.<ref name=\"Karp-PoW-1979\">{{harvnb |Karp |1979}}</ref> After the sinking of seven US merchant ships by submarines and the publication of the Zimmermann telegram, Wilson called for war on Germany on 2{{nbsp}}April 1917,<ref>[[S: Woodrow Wilson Urges Congress to Declare War on Germany|\"Woodrow Wilson Urges Congress to Declare War on Germany\"]] (Wikisource)</ref> which the [[US Congress]] [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|declared 4{{nbsp}}days later]].\n\nThe United States was never formally a member of the Allies but became a self-styled \"Associated Power\".

General Foch pressed to use the arriving American troops as individual replacements, whereas Pershing still sought to field American units as an independent force. These units were assigned to the depleted French and British Empire commands on 28 March 1918.\n\n====German Spring Offensive of 1918====\n{{Main|Spring Offensive}}\n[[File:General gouraud french army world war i machinegun marne 1918.JPEG|thumb|French soldiers under [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|General Gouraud]], with machine guns amongst the ruins of a cathedral near the [[Marne (river)|Marne]], 1918]]\n\nLudendorff drew up plans ([[Code name|codenamed]] [[Operation Michael]]) for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front. The Spring Offensive sought to divide the British and French forces with a series of feints and advances. The German leadership hoped to end the war before significant US forces arrived. The operation commenced on 21 March 1918 with an attack on British forces near [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]]. German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of {{convert|60|km|mi}}.{{sfn |Westwell |2004}}\n\nBritish and French trenches were penetrated using novel [[infiltration tactics]], also named ''Hutier'' tactics after General [[Oskar von Hutier]], by specially trained units called [[Stosstruppen|stormtroopers]]. Previously, attacks had been characterised by long artillery bombardments and massed assaults. In the Spring Offensive of 1918, however, Ludendorff used artillery only briefly and infiltrated small groups of infantry at weak points. They attacked command and logistics areas and bypassed points of serious resistance. More heavily armed infantry then destroyed these isolated positions. This German success relied greatly on the element of surprise.{{sfn |Posen |1984 |p=190}}{{Citation not found}}\n\n[[File:British 55th Division gas casualties 10 April 1918.jpg|thumb|left|British [[55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division|55th Division]] soldiers blinded by tear gas during the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of Estaires]], 10 April 1918]]\n\nThe front moved to within {{convert|120|km|mi}} of Paris. Three heavy [[Krupp]] [[railway gun]]s fired 183&nbsp;shells on the capital, causing many Parisians to flee. The initial offensive was so successful that Kaiser Wilhelm II declared 24 March a [[Public holiday|national holiday]]. Many Germans thought victory was near. After heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted. Lacking tanks or [[Self-propelled artillery|motorised artillery]], the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains. The problems of re-supply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shell-torn and often impassable to traffic.{{sfn |Gray |1991 |p=86}}\n\nFollowing Operation Michael, Germany launched [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Operation Georgette]] against the northern [[English Channel]] ports. The Allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by Germany. The German Army to the south then conducted [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Operations Bl\u00fccher and Yorck]], pushing broadly towards Paris. Germany launched Operation Marne ([[Second Battle of the Marne]]) on 15 July, in an attempt to encircle [[Reims]]. The resulting counter-attack, which started the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], marked the first successful Allied offensive of the war. By 20 July, the Germans had retreated across the Marne to their starting lines,{{sfn |Rickard |2007}} having achieved little, and the German Army never regained the initiative. German casualties between March and April 1918 were 270,000, including many highly trained stormtroopers.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany was falling apart at home. [[Anti-war]] marches became frequent and morale in the army fell. Industrial output was half the 1913 levels.\n\n====New states enter the war====\nIn the late spring of 1918, three new states were formed in the [[South Caucasus]]: the [[First Republic of Armenia]], the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], and the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], which declared their independence from the Russian Empire. Two other minor entities were established, the [[Centrocaspian Dictatorship]] and [[South West Caucasian Republic]] (the former was liquidated by Azerbaijan in the autumn of 1918 and the latter by a joint Armenian-British task force in early 1919). With the withdrawal of the Russian armies from the Caucasus front in the winter of 1917\u201318, the three major republics braced for an imminent Ottoman advance, which commenced in the early months of 1918. Solidarity was briefly maintained when the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic|Transcaucasian Federative Republic]] was created in the spring of 1918, but this collapsed in May, when the Georgians [[Treaty of Poti|asked for and received protection]] from Germany and the Azerbaijanis concluded a treaty with the Ottoman Empire that was more akin to a military alliance.

The war must be ended.\" On 13 August, at [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], Hindenburg, Ludendorff, the Chancellor, and Foreign Minister Hintz agreed that the war could not be ended militarily and, on the following day, the German Crown Council decided that victory in the field was now most improbable. Austria and Hungary warned that they could continue the war only until December, and Ludendorff recommended immediate peace negotiations.

The German High Command realised that the war was lost and made attempts to reach a satisfactory end. On 10 September Hindenburg urged peace moves to Emperor Charles of Austria, and Germany appealed to the Netherlands for mediation. On 14 September Austria sent a note to all belligerents and neutrals suggesting a meeting for peace talks on neutral soil, and on 15 September Germany made a peace offer to Belgium.

It was evident that Germany could no longer mount a successful defence. The collapse of the Balkans meant that Germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food.

Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war they believed to be as good as lost, initiating the uprising. The [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|sailors' revolt]], which then ensued in the naval ports of [[Wilhelmshaven]] and [[Kiel mutiny|Kiel]], spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9{{nbsp}}November 1918, shortly thereafter to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II, and to German surrender.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kurkuhl.de/docs/kieler_14punkte.pdf |author=K.

On 29 October, the imperial authorities asked Italy for an armistice, but the Italians continued advancing, reaching Trento, Udine, and Trieste. On 3{{nbsp}}November, Austria-Hungary sent a [[White flag|flag of truce]] to ask for an [[armistice]] (Armistice of Villa Giusti).

Yet at the time of the armistice, no Allied force had crossed the German frontier, the Western Front was still some {{convert|720|km|mi}} from Berlin, and the Kaiser's armies had retreated from the battlefield in good order. These factors enabled Hindenburg and other senior German leaders to spread the story that their armies had not really been defeated. This resulted in the [[stab-in-the-back legend]],{{sfn |Baker |2006}}{{sfn |Chickering |2004 |pp=185\u2013188}} which attributed Germany's defeat not to its inability to continue fighting (even though up to a million soldiers were suffering from the [[1918 flu pandemic]] and unfit to fight), but to the public's failure to respond to its \"patriotic calling\" and the supposed intentional sabotage of the war effort, particularly by Jews, Socialists, and Bolsheviks.\n\nThe Allies had much more potential wealth they could spend on the war. One estimate (using 1913 US dollars) is that the Allies spent $58&nbsp;billion on the war and the Central Powers only $25&nbsp;billion.

The [[Ottoman Empire]] was soon replaced by Turkey and several other countries in the Middle East.\n\nIn the British Empire, the war unleashed new forms of nationalism. In Australia and New Zealand the Battle of Gallipoli became known as those nations' \"Baptism of Fire\". It was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought, and it was one of the first times that Australian troops fought as Australians, not just subjects of the [[British Crown]].

By the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, [[Wireless|wireless communication]],{{sfn |Hartcup |1988 |p=154}} [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]], [[tank]]s,{{sfn |Hartcup |1988 |pp=82\u201386}} and aircraft.

In 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. By 1917, [[indirect fire]] with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably aircraft and the often overlooked [[field telephone]].<ref>Sterling, Christopher H.; Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century (2008).

The British had a 6-inch (152&nbsp;mm) howitzer, but it was so heavy it had to be hauled to the field in pieces and assembled. The Germans also fielded Austrian {{convert|305|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|420|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns and, even at the beginning of the war, had inventories of various calibres of ''[[Minenwerfer]]'', which were ideally suited for trench warfare.{{sfn |Mosier |2001 |pp=42\u201348}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Jager |first=Herbert |title=German Artillery of World War One |publisher=Crowood Press |date=2001 |page=224 |isbn=978-1861264039}}</ref>\n\n[[File:38cmBttrPommern.jpg|thumb|38-cm \"[[Batterie Pommern|Lange Max]]\" of [[Koekelare]] (Leugenboom), biggest gun in the world in 1917]]\n\nOn 27 June 1917 the Germans used the biggest gun in the world, [[Batterie Pommern]], nicknamed \"[[Lange Max Museum|Lange Max]]\". This gun from Krupp was able to shoot 750&nbsp;kg shells from [[Koekelare]] to [[Dunkirk]], a distance of about {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nMuch of the combat involved trench warfare, in which hundreds often died for each metre gained. Many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during World War{{nbsp}}I. Such battles include Ypres, the Marne, [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]], the Somme, Verdun, and Gallipoli. The Germans employed the [[Haber process]] of [[nitrogen fixation]] to provide their forces with a constant supply of gunpowder despite the British naval blockade.{{sfn |Hartcup |1988}} Artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties{{sfn |Raudzens |1990 |p=421}} and consumed vast quantities of explosives. The large number of head wounds caused by exploding shells and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] forced the combatant nations to develop the modern steel helmet, led by the French, who introduced the [[Adrian helmet]] in 1915. It was quickly followed by the [[Brodie helmet]], worn by British Imperial and US troops, and in 1916 by the distinctive German ''[[Stahlhelm]]'', a design, with improvements, still in use today.\n\n{{quote |source=|\n<poem>Gas!

Gases used included chlorine, [[mustard gas]] and [[phosgene]]. Relatively few war casualties were caused by gas,{{sfn |Raudzens |1990}} as effective countermeasures to gas attacks were quickly created, such as [[gas mask]]s. The use of [[chemical warfare]] and small-scale [[Aerial bombing of cities|strategic bombing]] (as opposed to [[tactical bombing]]) were both outlawed by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, and both proved to be of limited effectiveness,{{sfn |Heller |1984}} though they captured the public imagination.<ref>Postwar pulp novels on future \"gas wars\" included Reginald Glossop's 1932 novel ''Ghastly Dew'' and Neil Bell's 1931 novel ''The Gas War of 1940''.</ref>\n\nThe most powerful land-based weapons were railway guns, weighing dozens of tons apiece.<ref>{{YouTube|Hl4jJJ9b9MA|\"Heavy Railroad Artillery\"}}</ref> The German version were nicknamed [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Berthas]], even though the namesake was not a railway gun. Germany developed the [[Paris Gun]], able to bombard Paris from over {{convert|100|km|mi}}, though shells were relatively light at 94&nbsp;kilograms (210&nbsp;lb).\n\n[[File:Vickers machine gun in the Battle of Passchendaele - September 1917.jpg|thumb|British [[Vickers machine gun]], 1917]]\n\nTrenches, machine guns, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, and modern artillery with fragmentation [[Shell (projectile)|shells]] helped bring the battle lines of World War{{nbsp}}I to a stalemate. The British and the French sought a solution with the creation of the tank and [[mechanised warfare]]. The British [[Mark I (tank)|first tanks]] were used during the Battle of the Somme on 15 September 1916. Mechanical reliability was an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. Within a year, the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds, and they showed their potential during the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917, by breaking the Hindenburg Line, while [[combined arms]] teams captured 8,000 enemy soldiers and 100&nbsp;guns. Meanwhile, the French introduced the first tanks with a rotating turret, the [[Renault FT]], which became a decisive tool of the victory. The conflict also saw the introduction of [[Light machine gun|light automatic weapons]] and [[submachine gun]]s, such as the [[Lewis Gun]], the [[Browning Automatic Rifle]], and the [[Bergmann MP18]].\n\nAnother new weapon, the [[flamethrower]], was first used by the German army and later adopted by other forces. Although not of high tactical value, the flamethrower was a powerful, demoralising weapon that caused terror on the battlefield.\n\n[[Trench railways]] evolved to supply the enormous quantities of food, water, and ammunition required to support large numbers of soldiers in areas where conventional transportation systems had been destroyed. Internal combustion engines and improved traction systems for automobiles and trucks/lorries eventually rendered trench railways obsolete.\n\n====Areas taken in major attacks====\n[[File:Attack areas in WW1.jpg|thumb|center|upright=4.0]]\n\nOn the Western Front neither side made impressive gains in the first three years of the war with attacks at Verdun, the Somme, Passchendaele, and Cambrai {{mdash}} the exception was Nivelle's Offensive in which the German defence gave ground while mauling the attackers so badly that there were mutinies in the French Army. In 1918 the Germans smashed through the defence lines in three great attacks: Michael, on the Lys, and on the Aisne, which displayed the power of their new tactics. The Allies struck back at [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Soissons]], which showed the Germans that they must return to the defensive, and at Amiens; tanks played a prominent role in both these assaults, as they had the year before at Cambrai.\n\nThe areas in the East were larger. The Germans did well at the First Masurian Lakes driving the invaders from East Prussia, and at [[Battle of Jugla|Riga]], which led the Russians to sue for peace. The Austro-Hungarians and Germans joined for a great success at Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w, which drove the Russians out of Poland. In a series of attacks along with the Bulgarians they occupied Serbia, Albania, Montenegro and most of Romania. The Allies successes came later in [[Third Battle of Gaza|Palestine]], the beginning of the end for the Ottomans, in Macedonia, which drove the Bulgarians out of the war, and at Vittorio Veneto, the final blow for the Austro-Hungarians. The area occupied in East by the Central powers on 11 November 1918 was {{cvt|1042600|km2|sqmi}}.\n\n===Naval===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-61-15, Panzerkreuzer \"SMS Goeben\".jpg|thumb|The {{sclass-|Moltke|battlecruiser|0}} {{ship|Ottoman battlecruiser|Yav\u00fbz Sult\u00e2n Sel\u00eem}}]]\n\nGermany deployed U-boats (submarines) after the war began. Alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic, the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] employed them to deprive the British Isles of vital supplies. The deaths of British merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of U-boats led to the development of depth charges (1916), hydrophones (passive [[sonar]], 1917), blimps, [[hunter-killer submarine]]s ([[British R-class submarine|HMS ''R-1'']], 1917), forward-throwing [[anti-submarine weapon]]s, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918).<ref name=\"price1980\"/> To extend their operations, the Germans proposed supply submarines (1916).

Balloons commonly had a crew of two, equipped with [[parachute]]s,{{sfn |Winter |1983}} so that if there was an enemy air attack the crew could parachute to safety. At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output), and smaller versions were not developed until the end of the war; they were also opposed by the British leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice.<ref name=FullCircle>{{harvnb |Johnson |2001}}</ref>\n\nRecognised for their value as observation platforms, balloons were important targets for enemy aircraft. To defend them against air attack, they were heavily protected by antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft; to attack them, unusual weapons such as air-to-air rockets were tried. Thus, the reconnaissance value of blimps and balloons contributed to the development of air-to-air combat between all types of aircraft, and to the trench stalemate, because it was impossible to move large numbers of troops undetected. The Germans conducted air raids on England during 1915 and 1916 with airships, hoping to damage British morale and cause aircraft to be diverted from the front lines, and indeed the resulting panic led to the diversion of several squadrons of fighters from France.<ref name=\"Cross 1991\"/><ref name=FullCircle/>\n\n==War crimes==\n\n===Baralong incidents===\n{{Main|Baralong incidents}}\n[[File:HMS Baralong.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Baralong'']]\n\nOn 19 August 1915, the German submarine [[SM U-27 (Germany)|U-27]] was sunk by the British [[Q-ship]] {{HMS|Baralong}}.

Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives. Most deaths were those of young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers.{{sfn |Havighurst |1985 |p=131}} Conscription during the First World War began when the British government passed the [[Military Service Act 1916|Military Service Act]] in 1916. The act specified that single men aged 18 to 40 years old were liable to be called up for military service unless they were widowed with children or ministers of a religion. There was a system of [[Military Service Tribunals]] to adjudicate upon claims for exemption upon the grounds of performing civilian work of national importance, domestic hardship, health, and conscientious objection. The law went through several changes before the war ended. Married men were exempt in the original Act, although this was changed in June 1916. The age limit was also eventually raised to 51 years old. Recognition of work of national importance also diminished, and in the last year of the war there was some support for the conscription of clergy.<ref>Chelmsford, J.E. \"Clergy and Man-Power\", ''[[The Times]]'' 15 April 1918, p. 12</ref> Conscription lasted until mid-1919.

This was deemed to be inadequate, so age ranges were increased and exemptions reduced, and so by the end of 1918 this increased to 24 million men that were registered with nearly 3{{nbsp}}million inducted into the military services. The draft was universal and included blacks on the same terms as whites, although they served in different units. In all 367,710 black Americans were drafted (13% of the total), compared to 2,442,586 white (87%).\n\nForms of resistance ranged from peaceful protest to violent demonstrations and from humble letter-writing campaigns asking for mercy to radical newspapers demanding reform. The most common tactics were dodging and desertion, and many communities sheltered and defended their draft dodgers as political heroes. Many socialists were jailed for \"obstructing the recruitment or enlistment service\". The most famous was Eugene Debs, head of the Socialist Party of America, who ran for president in 1920 from his prison cell. In 1917 a number of radicals and anarchists challenged the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the [[Selective Draft Law Cases]] on 7{{nbsp}}January 1918.\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\nLike all the armies of mainland Europe, Austria-Hungary relied on conscription to fill its ranks. Officer recruitment, however, was voluntary. The effect of this at the start of the war was that well over a quarter of the rank and file were Slavs, while more than 75% of the officers were ethnic Germans. This was much resented. The army has been described as being \"run on colonial lines\" and the Slav soldiers as \"disaffected\". Thus conscription contributed greatly to Austria's disastrous performance on the battlefield.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Catastrophe: Europe goes to War 1914 |last=Hastings |first=Max |publisher=Collins |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-00-746764-8 |location=London |pages=30, 140}}</ref>\n\n==Diplomacy==\n{{Main|Diplomatic history of World War I}}\nThe non-military diplomatic and propaganda interactions among the nations were designed to build support for the cause, or to undermine support for the enemy. For the most part, wartime diplomacy focused on five issues: [[Propaganda in World War I|propaganda campaigns]]; defining and redefining the war goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations (Italy, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Romania) into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the Allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the Central Powers, especially among Czechs, Poles, and Arabs.

Scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalisation of politics, race, and the male body. Furthermore, new research has revised our understanding of five major topics that historians have long debated: Why the war began, why the Allies won, whether generals were responsible for high casualty rates, how the soldiers endured the horrors of trench warfare, and to what extent the civilian homefront accepted and endorsed the war effort.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Heather |last=Jones |title=As the centenary approaches: the regeneration of First World War historiography |journal=[[Historical Journal]] |year=2013 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=857\u2013878 [p. 858] |doi=10.1017/S0018246X13000216 }}</ref>\n\n===Memorials===\n{{Main|World War I memorials}}\n[[File:Pagny le Chateau monument morts 002b.jpg|thumb|A typical village [[war memorial]] to soldiers killed in World War I]]\n\nMemorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns.

Films such as ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' and ''[[King & Country]]'' have perpetuated the idea, while war-time films including ''Camrades'', ''[[Poppies of Flanders]]'', and ''[[Shoulder Arms]]'' indicate that the most contemporary views of the war were overall far more positive.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=153\u2013221}} Likewise, the art of [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], [[Christopher Nevinson]], and [[Henry Tonks]] in Britain painted a negative view of the conflict in keeping with the growing perception, while popular war-time artists such as [[Muirhead Bone]] painted more serene and pleasant interpretations subsequently rejected as inaccurate.<ref name=\"Hynes1991\">{{cite book |last=Hynes |first=Samuel Lynn |authorlink=Samuel Hynes |title=A war imagined: the First World War and English culture |year=1991 |publisher=Atheneum |isbn=978-0-689-12128-9 |pages=i\u2013xii}}</ref> Several historians like [[John Terraine]], [[Niall Ferguson]] and [[Gary Sheffield (historian)|Gary Sheffield]] have challenged these interpretations as partial and [[polemic]]al views:\n\n<blockquote>These beliefs did not become widely shared because they offered the only accurate interpretation of wartime events. In every respect, the war was much more complicated than they suggest. In recent years, historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular clich\u00e9 of World War{{nbsp}}I. It has been pointed out that, although the losses were devastating, their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited. The many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers in and out of the front line, including comradeship, boredom, and even enjoyment, have been recognised. The war is not now seen as a 'fight about nothing', but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less liberal democracy. It has been acknowledged that British generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges, and that it was under their command that the British army played a major part in the defeat of the Germans in 1918: a great forgotten victory.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=153\u2013221}}</blockquote>\n\nThough these views have been discounted as \"myths\",<ref name=\"Hynes1991\"/><ref name=\"Fussell2000\">{{cite book |last=Fussell |first=Paul |title=The Great War and modern memory |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=D9iNQYfeKdwC}} |accessdate=18 May 2010 |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-513332-5 |pages=1\u201378}}</ref> they are common.

Though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception. Such historians as Dan Todman, [[Paul Fussell]], and Samuel Heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=xi\u2013xv}}\n\n===Discontent in Germany===\nThe rise of [[Nazism]] and [[Fascism]] included a revival of the nationalist spirit and a rejection of many post-war changes. Similarly, the popularity of the stab-in-the-back legend (German: ''Dolchsto\u00dflegende'') was a testament to the psychological state of defeated Germany and was a rejection of responsibility for the conflict. This conspiracy theory of betrayal became common, and the German populace came to see themselves as victims. The widespread acceptance of the \"stab-in-the-back\" theory delegitimised the Weimar government and destabilised the system, opening it to extremes of right and left.\n\nCommunist and fascist movements around Europe drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a new level of popularity. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or harshly affected by the war. [[Adolf Hitler]] was able to gain popularity by using German discontent with the still controversial Treaty of Versailles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/war_end_01.shtml |publisher=BBC |title=The Ending of World War One, and the Legacy of Peace |first=Martin |last=Kitchen}}</ref> World War{{nbsp}}II was in part a continuation of the power struggle never fully resolved by World War{{nbsp}}I.

All these slaughters, it is argued here, had a common origin, the collapse of the elite structure and normal modes of government of much of central, eastern and southern Europe as a result of World War{{nbsp}}I, without which surely neither Communism nor Fascism would have existed except in the minds of unknown agitators and crackpots.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rubinstein |first=W.D. |year=2004 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=nMMAk4VwLLwC}} |title=Genocide: a history |publisher=Pearson Education |page=7 |isbn=978-0-582-50601-5}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Economic effects===\n{{See also|Economic history of World War I}}\n[[File:The Girl Behind the Gun 1915.jpg|thumb|Poster showing women workers, 1915]]\n\nOne of the most dramatic effects of the war was the expansion of governmental powers and responsibilities in Britain, France, the United States, and the Dominions of the British Empire. To harness all the power of their societies, governments created new ministries and powers. New taxes were levied and laws enacted, all designed to bolster the [[war effort]]; many have lasted to this day. Similarly, the war strained the abilities of some formerly large and bureaucratised governments, such as in Austria-Hungary and Germany.\n\n[[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and the United States), but decreased in France and Russia, in neutral Netherlands, and in the three main Central Powers. The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire ranged between 30% and 40%. In Austria, for example, most pigs were slaughtered, so at war's end there was no meat.\n\nIn all nations, the government's share of GDP increased, surpassing 50% in both Germany and France and nearly reaching that level in Britain. To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily from [[Wall Street]]. President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but allowed a great increase in [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] lending to the Allies. After 1919, the US demanded repayment of these loans. The repayments were, in part, funded by German reparations that, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany. This circular system collapsed in 1931 and some loans were never repaid. Britain still owed the United States $4.4 [[1,000,000,000|billion]]<ref>10{{sup|9}} in this context&nbsp;\u2013 see [[Long and short scales]]</ref> of World War{{nbsp}}I debt in 1934, the last instalment was finally paid in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/562830/First-World-War-debt-paid-off |title=Britain FINALLY pays off last of First World War debt as George Osborne redeems \u00a31.9bn |first=Peter |last=Henn |date=9 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMacro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war. Families were altered by the departure of many men. With the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. At the same time, industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war. This aided the struggle for [[suffragette|voting rights for women]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Noakes |first=Lucy |title=Women in the British Army: War and the Gentle Sex, 1907\u20131948 |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, England |isbn=978-0-415-39056-9 |page=48}}</ref>\n\nWorld War I further compounded the gender imbalance, adding to the phenomenon of [[surplus women]]. The deaths of nearly one million men during the war in Britain increased the gender gap by almost a million: from 670,000 to 1,700,000. The number of unmarried women seeking economic means grew dramatically. In addition, demobilisation and economic decline following the war caused high unemployment. The war increased female employment; however, the return of demobilised men displaced many from the workforce, as did the closure of many of the wartime factories.\n\nIn Britain, rationing was finally imposed in early 1918, limited to meat, sugar, and fats (butter and margarine), but not bread. The new system worked smoothly. From 1914 to 1918, trade union membership doubled, from a little over four million to a little over eight million.\n\nBritain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply from traditional sources had become difficult. Geologists such as [[Albert Ernest Kitson]] were called on to find new resources of precious minerals in the African colonies. Kitson discovered important new deposits of [[manganese]], used in munitions production, in the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]].{{sfn |Green |1938 |p=cxxvi}}\n\nArticle 231 of the Treaty of Versailles (the so-called \"war guilt\" clause) stated Germany accepted responsibility for \"all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies.\"<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Anton Kaes |editor2=Martin Jay |editor3=Edward Dimendberg |title=The Weimar Republic Sourcebook |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4A1gt4-VCsC&pg=PA8 |chapter=The Treaty of Versailles: The Reparations Clauses |year=1994 |publisher=University of California Press |page=8 |isbn=978-0520909601}}</ref> It was worded as such to lay a legal basis for reparations, and a similar clause was inserted in the treaties with Austria and Hungary.

In November 1914, the [[Ottoman Empire]] entered the war on the side of the Central Powers, opening fronts in the [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus]], [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]], and the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Sinai Peninsula]]. The war was fought in and drew upon each power's colonial empire as well, spreading the conflict to [[African theatre of World War I|Africa]] and across the globe. The Entente and its allies would eventually become known as the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], while the grouping of Austria-Hungary, Germany and their allies would become known as the [[Central Powers]].\n\nThe German advance into France was halted at the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] and by the end of 1914, the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] settled into a [[battle of attrition]], marked by a long series of [[trench warfare|trench lines]] that changed little until 1917 (the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], by contrast, was marked by much greater exchanges of territory). In 1915, Italy joined the Allied Powers and opened a [[Alpine Front|front in the Alps]]. [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] joined the Central Powers in 1915 and [[Kingdom of Greece|Greece]] joined the Allies in 1917, expanding the [[Balkans Campaign (World War I)|war in the Balkans]]. The United States initially remained neutral, though even while neutral it became an important supplier of war [[materiel]] to the Allies. Eventually, after the sinking of American merchant ships by German submarines, the declaration by Germany that its navy would resume unrestricted attacks on neutral shipping, and [[Zimmermann Telegram|the revelation]] that Germany was trying to incite Mexico to make war on the United States, the [[American entry into World War I|U.S. declared war on Germany]] on 6{{nbsp}}April 1917. Trained American forces would not begin arriving at the front in large numbers until mid-1918, but ultimately the [[American Expeditionary Forces|American Expeditionary Force]] would reach some two million troops.<ref>Edward M.

The 1917 [[February Revolution]] in Russia replaced the [[Tsarist autocracy]] with the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], but continuing discontent with the cost of the war led to the [[October Revolution]], the creation of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Socialist Republic]], and the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] by the new government in March 1918, ending Russia's involvement in the war. This allowed the transfer of large numbers of German troops from the East to the Western Front, resulting in the [[Spring Offensive|German March 1918 Offensive]]. This offensive was initially successful, but failed to score a decisive victory and exhausted the last of the German reserves. The Allies rallied and drove the Germans back in their [[Hundred Days Offensive]], a continual series of attacks to which the Germans had no reply.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sheffield |first1=Gary |title=Forgotten Victory |date=2002 |publisher=Review |isbn=978-0747271574 |page=251}}</ref> Bulgaria was the first Central Power to sign an armistice\u2014the [[Armistice of Salonica]] on 29 September 1918.

When Germany expanded its standing army by 170,000 men in 1913, France extended compulsory military service from two to three years; similar measures taken by the [[Balkans|Balkan powers]] and Italy led to increased expenditure by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] and Austria-Hungary.

After initial outrage and much deliberation, they took Wilson's note as a separate effort, signalling that the United States was on the verge of entering the war against Germany following the \"submarine outrages\". While the Allies debated a response to Wilson's offer, the Germans chose to rebuff it in favour of \"a direct exchange of views\". Learning of the German response, the Allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 January. They sought restoration of damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for France, Russia and Romania, and a recognition of the principle of nationalities.{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |p=345}} This included the liberation of Italians, Slavs, Romanians, Czecho-Slovaks, and the creation of a \"free and united Poland\".{{sfn |Keegan |1998 |p=345}} On the question of security, the Allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement.{{sfn |Kernek |1970 |pp=721\u2013766}} The negotiations failed and the Entente powers rejected the German offer on the grounds that Germany had not put forward any specific proposals.\n\n===1917\u20131918===\nEvents of 1917 proved decisive in ending the war, although their effects were not fully felt until 1918.\n\n====Developments in 1917====\n[[File:Guetteur au poste de l'\u00e9cluse 26.jpg|thumb|upright|left|French Army lookout at his observation post, [[Haut-Rhin]], France, 1917]]\n\nThe British naval blockade began to have a serious impact on Germany. In response, in February 1917, the [[German General Staff]] convinced [[Chancellor]] Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg to declare unrestricted submarine warfare, with the goal of starving Britain out of the war. German planners estimated that unrestricted submarine warfare would cost Britain a monthly shipping loss of 600,000 tons. The General Staff acknowledged that the policy would almost certainly bring the United States into the conflict, but calculated that British shipping losses would be so high that they would be forced to sue for peace after five to six months, before American intervention could have an effect. Tonnage sunk rose above 500,000&nbsp;tons per month from February to July. It peaked at 860,000&nbsp;tons in April. After July, the newly re-introduced [[convoy]] system became effective in reducing the U-boat threat. Britain was safe from starvation, while German industrial output fell, and the United States joined the war far earlier than Germany had anticipated.\n\nOn 3 May 1917, during the Nivelle Offensive, the French 2nd Colonial Division, veterans of the Battle of Verdun, refused orders, arriving drunk and without their weapons. Their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division, and harsh measures were not immediately implemented. The French Army Mutinies eventually spread to a further 54 French divisions, and 20,000 men deserted. However, appeals to patriotism and duty, as well as mass arrests and trials, encouraged the soldiers to return to defend their trenches, although the French soldiers refused to participate in further offensive action.<ref>Marshall, 292.</ref> [[Robert Nivelle]] was removed from command by 15 May, replaced by General [[Philippe P\u00e9tain]], who suspended bloody large-scale attacks.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1983-0323-501, Kriegskinematograph im Sch\u00fctzengraben.jpg|thumb|German<!--UFA?--> film crew recording the action]]\n\nThe victory of the Central Powers at the Battle of Caporetto led the Allies to convene the [[Rapallo Conference]] at which they formed the [[Supreme War Council]] to co-ordinate planning.

With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western Front. The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success based on a final quick offensive.

These pushed the front line north to more advantageous positions for the Entente in preparation for an attack and to acclimatise the newly arrived Indian Army infantry.

Germany did this realising it would mean American entry. The German Foreign Minister, in the [[Zimmermann Telegram]], invited Mexico to join the war as Germany's ally against the United States. In return, the Germans would finance Mexico's war and help it recover the territories of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.{{sfn |Tuchman |1966}} The United Kingdom intercepted the message and presented it to the US embassy in the UK. From there it made its way to President Wilson who released the Zimmermann note to the public, and Americans saw it as ''[[casus belli]]''. Wilson called on anti-war elements to end all wars, by winning this one and eliminating militarism from the globe. He argued that the war was so important that the US had to have a voice in the peace conference.<ref name=\"Karp-PoW-1979\">{{harvnb |Karp |1979}}</ref> After the sinking of seven US merchant ships by submarines and the publication of the Zimmermann telegram, Wilson called for war on Germany on 2{{nbsp}}April 1917,<ref>[[S: Woodrow Wilson Urges Congress to Declare War on Germany|\"Woodrow Wilson Urges Congress to Declare War on Germany\"]] (Wikisource)</ref> which the [[US Congress]] [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|declared 4{{nbsp}}days later]].\n\nThe United States was never formally a member of the Allies but became a self-styled \"Associated Power\".

The British and French wanted American units used to reinforce their troops already on the battle lines and not waste scarce shipping on bringing over supplies. General [[John J.

General Foch was appointed as supreme commander of the Allied forces. Haig, Petain, and Pershing retained tactical control of their respective armies; Foch assumed a co-ordinating rather than a directing role, and the British, French, and US commands operated largely independently. General Foch pressed to use the arriving American troops as individual replacements, whereas Pershing still sought to field American units as an independent force. These units were assigned to the depleted French and British Empire commands on 28 March 1918.\n\n====German Spring Offensive of 1918====\n{{Main|Spring Offensive}}\n[[File:General gouraud french army world war i machinegun marne 1918.JPEG|thumb|French soldiers under [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|General Gouraud]], with machine guns amongst the ruins of a cathedral near the [[Marne (river)|Marne]], 1918]]\n\nLudendorff drew up plans ([[Code name|codenamed]] [[Operation Michael]]) for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front. The Spring Offensive sought to divide the British and French forces with a series of feints and advances. The German leadership hoped to end the war before significant US forces arrived. The operation commenced on 21 March 1918 with an attack on British forces near [[Saint-Quentin, Aisne|Saint-Quentin]]. German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of {{convert|60|km|mi}}.{{sfn |Westwell |2004}}\n\nBritish and French trenches were penetrated using novel [[infiltration tactics]], also named ''Hutier'' tactics after General [[Oskar von Hutier]], by specially trained units called [[Stosstruppen|stormtroopers]]. Previously, attacks had been characterised by long artillery bombardments and massed assaults. In the Spring Offensive of 1918, however, Ludendorff used artillery only briefly and infiltrated small groups of infantry at weak points. They attacked command and logistics areas and bypassed points of serious resistance. More heavily armed infantry then destroyed these isolated positions. This German success relied greatly on the element of surprise.{{sfn |Posen |1984 |p=190}}{{Citation not found}}\n\n[[File:British 55th Division gas casualties 10 April 1918.jpg|thumb|left|British [[55th (West Lancashire) Infantry Division|55th Division]] soldiers blinded by tear gas during the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of Estaires]], 10 April 1918]]\n\nThe front moved to within {{convert|120|km|mi}} of Paris. Three heavy [[Krupp]] [[railway gun]]s fired 183&nbsp;shells on the capital, causing many Parisians to flee. The initial offensive was so successful that Kaiser Wilhelm II declared 24 March a [[Public holiday|national holiday]]. Many Germans thought victory was near. After heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted. Lacking tanks or [[Self-propelled artillery|motorised artillery]], the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains. The problems of re-supply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shell-torn and often impassable to traffic.{{sfn |Gray |1991 |p=86}}\n\nFollowing Operation Michael, Germany launched [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Operation Georgette]] against the northern [[English Channel]] ports. The Allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by Germany. The German Army to the south then conducted [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Operations Bl\u00fccher and Yorck]], pushing broadly towards Paris. Germany launched Operation Marne ([[Second Battle of the Marne]]) on 15 July, in an attempt to encircle [[Reims]]. The resulting counter-attack, which started the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], marked the first successful Allied offensive of the war. By 20 July, the Germans had retreated across the Marne to their starting lines,{{sfn |Rickard |2007}} having achieved little, and the German Army never regained the initiative. German casualties between March and April 1918 were 270,000, including many highly trained stormtroopers.\n\nMeanwhile, Germany was falling apart at home. [[Anti-war]] marches became frequent and morale in the army fell. Industrial output was half the 1913 levels.\n\n====New states enter the war====\nIn the late spring of 1918, three new states were formed in the [[South Caucasus]]: the [[First Republic of Armenia]], the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], and the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], which declared their independence from the Russian Empire. Two other minor entities were established, the [[Centrocaspian Dictatorship]] and [[South West Caucasian Republic]] (the former was liquidated by Azerbaijan in the autumn of 1918 and the latter by a joint Armenian-British task force in early 1919). With the withdrawal of the Russian armies from the Caucasus front in the winter of 1917\u201318, the three major republics braced for an imminent Ottoman advance, which commenced in the early months of 1918. Solidarity was briefly maintained when the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic|Transcaucasian Federative Republic]] was created in the spring of 1918, but this collapsed in May, when the Georgians [[Treaty of Poti|asked for and received protection]] from Germany and the Azerbaijanis concluded a treaty with the Ottoman Empire that was more akin to a military alliance. Armenia was left to fend for itself and struggled for five months against the threat of a full-fledged occupation by the Ottoman Turks before defeating them at the [[Battle of Sardarabad]].{{sfn|Hovannisian |1967 |pp=1\u201339}}\n\n===Allied victory: summer 1918 onwards===\n\n====Hundred Days Offensive====\n{{Main|Hundred Days Offensive|Weimar Republic}}\n[[File:Riflemen-1918-Western-Front.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Between April and November 1918, the Allies increased their front-line rifle strength while German strength fell by half.{{sfn |Ayers |1919 |p=104}}]]\n[[File:Aerial view of ruins of Vaux, France, 1918, ca. 03-1918 - ca. 11-1918 - NARA - 512862.tif|thumb|upright=0.9|Aerial view of ruins of [[Vaux-devant-Damloup]], France, 1918]]\n\nThe Allied counteroffensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, began on 8{{nbsp}}August 1918, with the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]].

Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives, and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it. They began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks, then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus.<ref name=\"Pitt-1962\">{{harvnb |Pitt |2003}}</ref>\n\nThe day after the Offensive began, Ludendorff said: \"We cannot win the war any more, but we must not lose it either.\" On 11 August he offered his resignation to the Kaiser, who refused it, replying, \"I see that we must strike a balance. We have nearly reached the limit of our powers of resistance. The war must be ended.\" On 13 August, at [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], Hindenburg, Ludendorff, the Chancellor, and Foreign Minister Hintz agreed that the war could not be ended militarily and, on the following day, the German Crown Council decided that victory in the field was now most improbable. Austria and Hungary warned that they could continue the war only until December, and Ludendorff recommended immediate peace negotiations.

The German High Command realised that the war was lost and made attempts to reach a satisfactory end. On 10 September Hindenburg urged peace moves to Emperor Charles of Austria, and Germany appealed to the Netherlands for mediation. On 14 September Austria sent a note to all belligerents and neutrals suggesting a meeting for peace talks on neutral soil, and on 15 September Germany made a peace offer to Belgium.

It was evident that Germany could no longer mount a successful defence. The collapse of the Balkans meant that Germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food.

This culminated in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto, which marked the end of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an effective fighting force. The offensive also triggered the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the last week of October, declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague, and Zagreb. On 29 October, the imperial authorities asked Italy for an armistice, but the Italians continued advancing, reaching Trento, Udine, and Trieste. On 3{{nbsp}}November, Austria-Hungary sent a [[White flag|flag of truce]] to ask for an [[armistice]] (Armistice of Villa Giusti). The terms, arranged by telegraph with the Allied Authorities in Paris, were communicated to the Austrian commander and accepted.

Yet at the time of the armistice, no Allied force had crossed the German frontier, the Western Front was still some {{convert|720|km|mi}} from Berlin, and the Kaiser's armies had retreated from the battlefield in good order. These factors enabled Hindenburg and other senior German leaders to spread the story that their armies had not really been defeated. This resulted in the [[stab-in-the-back legend]],{{sfn |Baker |2006}}{{sfn |Chickering |2004 |pp=185\u2013188}} which attributed Germany's defeat not to its inability to continue fighting (even though up to a million soldiers were suffering from the [[1918 flu pandemic]] and unfit to fight), but to the public's failure to respond to its \"patriotic calling\" and the supposed intentional sabotage of the war effort, particularly by Jews, Socialists, and Bolsheviks.\n\nThe Allies had much more potential wealth they could spend on the war. One estimate (using 1913 US dollars) is that the Allies spent $58&nbsp;billion on the war and the Central Powers only $25&nbsp;billion. Among the Allies, the UK spent $21&nbsp;billion and the US$17&nbsp;billion; among the Central Powers Germany spent $20&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite book |first=Gerd |last=Hardach |title=The First World War, 1914\u20131918 |url=https://archive.org/details/firstworldwar1910000hard |url-access=registration |location=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1977 |page=[https://archive.org/details/firstworldwar1910000hard/page/153 153] |isbn=0-520-03060-5 |postscript=none }}, using estimated made by {{cite book |first=H. |last=Menderhausen |title=The Economics of War |location=New York |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1941 |page=305 |oclc=774042 }}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{Main|Aftermath of World War I}}\nIn the aftermath of the war, four empires disappeared: the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian.

However, the negotiation of the treaty with the Ottoman Empire was followed by strife, and a final peace treaty between the Allied Powers and the country that would shortly become the [[Republic of Turkey]] was not signed until 24 July 1923, at [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]].\n\nSome [[war memorial]]s date the end of the war as being when the Versailles Treaty was signed in 1919, which was when many of the troops serving abroad finally returned home; by contrast, most commemorations of the war's end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918. Legally, the formal peace treaties were not complete until the last, the Treaty of Lausanne, was signed. Under its terms, the Allied forces left [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] on 23 August 1923.\n\n===Peace treaties and national boundaries===\n[[File:Venizelos signing the Treaty of Sevres.jpeg|thumb|left|Greek prime minister [[Eleftherios Venizelos]] signing the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]]]\n\nAfter the war, the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] imposed a series of peace treaties on the Central Powers officially ending the war.

Transylvania was shifted from Hungary to [[Greater Romania]]. The details were contained in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] and the Treaty of Trianon. As a result of the [[Treaty of Trianon]], 3.3&nbsp;million Hungarians came under foreign rule. Although the Hungarians made up approximately 54% of the population of the pre-war [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (according to the [[Ethnic and religious composition of Austria-Hungary#Transleithanian states|1910 census]]), only 32% of its territory was left to Hungary.

This treaty was never ratified by the Sultan and was rejected by the [[Turkish National Movement]], leading to the victorious [[Turkish War of Independence]] and the much less stringent 1923 Treaty of Lausanne.\n\nThough by 1923 most countries had made peace treaties, [[Andorra]] was an exception. Andorra declared war on Germany in August 1914. At that time, it had an army of 600 part-time military men, commanded by two officials.

By the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, [[Wireless|wireless communication]],{{sfn |Hartcup |1988 |p=154}} [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]], [[tank]]s,{{sfn |Hartcup |1988 |pp=82\u201386}} and aircraft.

In 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. By 1917, [[indirect fire]] with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably aircraft and the often overlooked [[field telephone]].<ref>Sterling, Christopher H.; Military Communications: From Ancient Times to the 21st Century (2008).

The German Army employed {{convert|150|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|210|mm|0|abbr=on}} [[howitzer]]s in 1914, when typical French and British guns were only {{convert|75|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|105|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The British had a 6-inch (152&nbsp;mm) howitzer, but it was so heavy it had to be hauled to the field in pieces and assembled. The Germans also fielded Austrian {{convert|305|mm|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|420|mm|0|abbr=on}} guns and, even at the beginning of the war, had inventories of various calibres of ''[[Minenwerfer]]'', which were ideally suited for trench warfare.{{sfn |Mosier |2001 |pp=42\u201348}}<ref>{{cite book |last=Jager |first=Herbert |title=German Artillery of World War One |publisher=Crowood Press |date=2001 |page=224 |isbn=978-1861264039}}</ref>\n\n[[File:38cmBttrPommern.jpg|thumb|38-cm \"[[Batterie Pommern|Lange Max]]\" of [[Koekelare]] (Leugenboom), biggest gun in the world in 1917]]\n\nOn 27 June 1917 the Germans used the biggest gun in the world, [[Batterie Pommern]], nicknamed \"[[Lange Max Museum|Lange Max]]\". This gun from Krupp was able to shoot 750&nbsp;kg shells from [[Koekelare]] to [[Dunkirk]], a distance of about {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nMuch of the combat involved trench warfare, in which hundreds often died for each metre gained. Many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during World War{{nbsp}}I. Such battles include Ypres, the Marne, [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]], the Somme, Verdun, and Gallipoli. The Germans employed the [[Haber process]] of [[nitrogen fixation]] to provide their forces with a constant supply of gunpowder despite the British naval blockade.{{sfn |Hartcup |1988}} Artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties{{sfn |Raudzens |1990 |p=421}} and consumed vast quantities of explosives. The large number of head wounds caused by exploding shells and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] forced the combatant nations to develop the modern steel helmet, led by the French, who introduced the [[Adrian helmet]] in 1915. It was quickly followed by the [[Brodie helmet]], worn by British Imperial and US troops, and in 1916 by the distinctive German ''[[Stahlhelm]]'', a design, with improvements, still in use today.\n\n{{quote |source=|\n<poem>Gas!

Gases used included chlorine, [[mustard gas]] and [[phosgene]]. Relatively few war casualties were caused by gas,{{sfn |Raudzens |1990}} as effective countermeasures to gas attacks were quickly created, such as [[gas mask]]s. The use of [[chemical warfare]] and small-scale [[Aerial bombing of cities|strategic bombing]] (as opposed to [[tactical bombing]]) were both outlawed by the Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907, and both proved to be of limited effectiveness,{{sfn |Heller |1984}} though they captured the public imagination.<ref>Postwar pulp novels on future \"gas wars\" included Reginald Glossop's 1932 novel ''Ghastly Dew'' and Neil Bell's 1931 novel ''The Gas War of 1940''.</ref>\n\nThe most powerful land-based weapons were railway guns, weighing dozens of tons apiece.<ref>{{YouTube|Hl4jJJ9b9MA|\"Heavy Railroad Artillery\"}}</ref> The German version were nicknamed [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Berthas]], even though the namesake was not a railway gun. Germany developed the [[Paris Gun]], able to bombard Paris from over {{convert|100|km|mi}}, though shells were relatively light at 94&nbsp;kilograms (210&nbsp;lb).\n\n[[File:Vickers machine gun in the Battle of Passchendaele - September 1917.jpg|thumb|British [[Vickers machine gun]], 1917]]\n\nTrenches, machine guns, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, and modern artillery with fragmentation [[Shell (projectile)|shells]] helped bring the battle lines of World War{{nbsp}}I to a stalemate. The British and the French sought a solution with the creation of the tank and [[mechanised warfare]]. The British [[Mark I (tank)|first tanks]] were used during the Battle of the Somme on 15 September 1916. Mechanical reliability was an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. Within a year, the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds, and they showed their potential during the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917, by breaking the Hindenburg Line, while [[combined arms]] teams captured 8,000 enemy soldiers and 100&nbsp;guns. Meanwhile, the French introduced the first tanks with a rotating turret, the [[Renault FT]], which became a decisive tool of the victory. The conflict also saw the introduction of [[Light machine gun|light automatic weapons]] and [[submachine gun]]s, such as the [[Lewis Gun]], the [[Browning Automatic Rifle]], and the [[Bergmann MP18]].\n\nAnother new weapon, the [[flamethrower]], was first used by the German army and later adopted by other forces. Although not of high tactical value, the flamethrower was a powerful, demoralising weapon that caused terror on the battlefield.\n\n[[Trench railways]] evolved to supply the enormous quantities of food, water, and ammunition required to support large numbers of soldiers in areas where conventional transportation systems had been destroyed. Internal combustion engines and improved traction systems for automobiles and trucks/lorries eventually rendered trench railways obsolete.\n\n====Areas taken in major attacks====\n[[File:Attack areas in WW1.jpg|thumb|center|upright=4.0]]\n\nOn the Western Front neither side made impressive gains in the first three years of the war with attacks at Verdun, the Somme, Passchendaele, and Cambrai {{mdash}} the exception was Nivelle's Offensive in which the German defence gave ground while mauling the attackers so badly that there were mutinies in the French Army. In 1918 the Germans smashed through the defence lines in three great attacks: Michael, on the Lys, and on the Aisne, which displayed the power of their new tactics. The Allies struck back at [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Soissons]], which showed the Germans that they must return to the defensive, and at Amiens; tanks played a prominent role in both these assaults, as they had the year before at Cambrai.\n\nThe areas in the East were larger. The Germans did well at the First Masurian Lakes driving the invaders from East Prussia, and at [[Battle of Jugla|Riga]], which led the Russians to sue for peace. The Austro-Hungarians and Germans joined for a great success at Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w, which drove the Russians out of Poland. In a series of attacks along with the Bulgarians they occupied Serbia, Albania, Montenegro and most of Romania. The Allies successes came later in [[Third Battle of Gaza|Palestine]], the beginning of the end for the Ottomans, in Macedonia, which drove the Bulgarians out of the war, and at Vittorio Veneto, the final blow for the Austro-Hungarians. The area occupied in East by the Central powers on 11 November 1918 was {{cvt|1042600|km2|sqmi}}.\n\n===Naval===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv DVM 10 Bild-23-61-15, Panzerkreuzer \"SMS Goeben\".jpg|thumb|The {{sclass-|Moltke|battlecruiser|0}} {{ship|Ottoman battlecruiser|Yav\u00fbz Sult\u00e2n Sel\u00eem}}]]\n\nGermany deployed U-boats (submarines) after the war began. Alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic, the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] employed them to deprive the British Isles of vital supplies. The deaths of British merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of U-boats led to the development of depth charges (1916), hydrophones (passive [[sonar]], 1917), blimps, [[hunter-killer submarine]]s ([[British R-class submarine|HMS ''R-1'']], 1917), forward-throwing [[anti-submarine weapon]]s, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918).<ref name=\"price1980\"/> To extend their operations, the Germans proposed supply submarines (1916).

By 1914, their military utility was obvious. They were initially used for [[reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground attack]]. To shoot down enemy planes, [[anti-aircraft guns]] and [[fighter aircraft]] were developed. [[Strategic bomber]]s were created, principally by the Germans and British, though the former used [[Zeppelin]]s as well.<ref name=\"Cross 1991\">{{harvnb |Cross |1991}}</ref> Towards the end of the conflict, aircraft carriers were used for the first time, with HMS ''Furious'' launching [[Sopwith Camels]] in a raid to destroy the Zeppelin hangars at [[Tondern]] in 1918.{{sfn |Cross |1991 |pp=56\u201357}}\n\n[[File:Richthofen and Falkenhayn with Fokker Dr.I c1918.jpg|thumb|right|[[Luftstreitkr\u00e4fte]] [[Fokker Dr.I]] being inspected by [[Manfred von Richthofen]], also known as the Red Baron, one of most famous pilots in the war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/richthofen2.php|title=Manfred von Richthofen|website=theaerodrome.com|access-date=21 April 2019}}</ref>]]\n\nManned [[observation balloon]]s, floating high above the trenches, were used as stationary reconnaissance platforms, reporting enemy movements and directing artillery.

At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output), and smaller versions were not developed until the end of the war; they were also opposed by the British leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice.<ref name=FullCircle>{{harvnb |Johnson |2001}}</ref>\n\nRecognised for their value as observation platforms, balloons were important targets for enemy aircraft. To defend them against air attack, they were heavily protected by antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft; to attack them, unusual weapons such as air-to-air rockets were tried. Thus, the reconnaissance value of blimps and balloons contributed to the development of air-to-air combat between all types of aircraft, and to the trench stalemate, because it was impossible to move large numbers of troops undetected. The Germans conducted air raids on England during 1915 and 1916 with airships, hoping to damage British morale and cause aircraft to be diverted from the front lines, and indeed the resulting panic led to the diversion of several squadrons of fighters from France.<ref name=\"Cross 1991\"/><ref name=FullCircle/>\n\n==War crimes==\n\n===Baralong incidents===\n{{Main|Baralong incidents}}\n[[File:HMS Baralong.jpg|thumb|HMS ''Baralong'']]\n\nOn 19 August 1915, the German submarine [[SM U-27 (Germany)|U-27]] was sunk by the British [[Q-ship]] {{HMS|Baralong}}.

Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives. Most deaths were those of young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers.{{sfn |Havighurst |1985 |p=131}} Conscription during the First World War began when the British government passed the [[Military Service Act 1916|Military Service Act]] in 1916. The act specified that single men aged 18 to 40 years old were liable to be called up for military service unless they were widowed with children or ministers of a religion. There was a system of [[Military Service Tribunals]] to adjudicate upon claims for exemption upon the grounds of performing civilian work of national importance, domestic hardship, health, and conscientious objection. The law went through several changes before the war ended. Married men were exempt in the original Act, although this was changed in June 1916. The age limit was also eventually raised to 51 years old. Recognition of work of national importance also diminished, and in the last year of the war there was some support for the conscription of clergy.<ref>Chelmsford, J.E. \"Clergy and Man-Power\", ''[[The Times]]'' 15 April 1918, p. 12</ref> Conscription lasted until mid-1919.

This was deemed to be inadequate, so age ranges were increased and exemptions reduced, and so by the end of 1918 this increased to 24 million men that were registered with nearly 3{{nbsp}}million inducted into the military services. The draft was universal and included blacks on the same terms as whites, although they served in different units. In all 367,710 black Americans were drafted (13% of the total), compared to 2,442,586 white (87%).\n\nForms of resistance ranged from peaceful protest to violent demonstrations and from humble letter-writing campaigns asking for mercy to radical newspapers demanding reform. The most common tactics were dodging and desertion, and many communities sheltered and defended their draft dodgers as political heroes. Many socialists were jailed for \"obstructing the recruitment or enlistment service\". The most famous was Eugene Debs, head of the Socialist Party of America, who ran for president in 1920 from his prison cell. In 1917 a number of radicals and anarchists challenged the new draft law in federal court, arguing that it was a direct violation of the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition against slavery and involuntary servitude. The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the draft act in the [[Selective Draft Law Cases]] on 7{{nbsp}}January 1918.\n\n===Austria-Hungary===\nLike all the armies of mainland Europe, Austria-Hungary relied on conscription to fill its ranks. Officer recruitment, however, was voluntary. The effect of this at the start of the war was that well over a quarter of the rank and file were Slavs, while more than 75% of the officers were ethnic Germans. This was much resented. The army has been described as being \"run on colonial lines\" and the Slav soldiers as \"disaffected\". Thus conscription contributed greatly to Austria's disastrous performance on the battlefield.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Catastrophe: Europe goes to War 1914 |last=Hastings |first=Max |publisher=Collins |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-00-746764-8 |location=London |pages=30, 140}}</ref>\n\n==Diplomacy==\n{{Main|Diplomatic history of World War I}}\nThe non-military diplomatic and propaganda interactions among the nations were designed to build support for the cause, or to undermine support for the enemy. For the most part, wartime diplomacy focused on five issues: [[Propaganda in World War I|propaganda campaigns]]; defining and redefining the war goals, which became harsher as the war went on; luring neutral nations (Italy, Ottoman Empire, Bulgaria, Romania) into the coalition by offering slices of enemy territory; and encouragement by the Allies of nationalistic minority movements inside the Central Powers, especially among Czechs, Poles, and Arabs.

Scholars have raised entirely new questions regarding military occupation, radicalisation of politics, race, and the male body. Furthermore, new research has revised our understanding of five major topics that historians have long debated: Why the war began, why the Allies won, whether generals were responsible for high casualty rates, how the soldiers endured the horrors of trench warfare, and to what extent the civilian homefront accepted and endorsed the war effort.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Heather |last=Jones |title=As the centenary approaches: the regeneration of First World War historiography |journal=[[Historical Journal]] |year=2013 |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=857\u2013878 [p. 858] |doi=10.1017/S0018246X13000216 }}</ref>\n\n===Memorials===\n{{Main|World War I memorials}}\n[[File:Pagny le Chateau monument morts 002b.jpg|thumb|A typical village [[war memorial]] to soldiers killed in World War I]]\n\nMemorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns.

Films such as ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' and ''[[King & Country]]'' have perpetuated the idea, while war-time films including ''Camrades'', ''[[Poppies of Flanders]]'', and ''[[Shoulder Arms]]'' indicate that the most contemporary views of the war were overall far more positive.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=153\u2013221}} Likewise, the art of [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], [[Christopher Nevinson]], and [[Henry Tonks]] in Britain painted a negative view of the conflict in keeping with the growing perception, while popular war-time artists such as [[Muirhead Bone]] painted more serene and pleasant interpretations subsequently rejected as inaccurate.<ref name=\"Hynes1991\">{{cite book |last=Hynes |first=Samuel Lynn |authorlink=Samuel Hynes |title=A war imagined: the First World War and English culture |year=1991 |publisher=Atheneum |isbn=978-0-689-12128-9 |pages=i\u2013xii}}</ref> Several historians like [[John Terraine]], [[Niall Ferguson]] and [[Gary Sheffield (historian)|Gary Sheffield]] have challenged these interpretations as partial and [[polemic]]al views:\n\n<blockquote>These beliefs did not become widely shared because they offered the only accurate interpretation of wartime events. In every respect, the war was much more complicated than they suggest. In recent years, historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular clich\u00e9 of World War{{nbsp}}I. It has been pointed out that, although the losses were devastating, their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited. The many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers in and out of the front line, including comradeship, boredom, and even enjoyment, have been recognised. The war is not now seen as a 'fight about nothing', but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less liberal democracy. It has been acknowledged that British generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges, and that it was under their command that the British army played a major part in the defeat of the Germans in 1918: a great forgotten victory.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=153\u2013221}}</blockquote>\n\nThough these views have been discounted as \"myths\",<ref name=\"Hynes1991\"/><ref name=\"Fussell2000\">{{cite book |last=Fussell |first=Paul |title=The Great War and modern memory |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=D9iNQYfeKdwC}} |accessdate=18 May 2010 |year=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-513332-5 |pages=1\u201378}}</ref> they are common.

Though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception. Such historians as Dan Todman, [[Paul Fussell]], and Samuel Heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.{{sfn |Todman |2005 |pp=xi\u2013xv}}\n\n===Discontent in Germany===\nThe rise of [[Nazism]] and [[Fascism]] included a revival of the nationalist spirit and a rejection of many post-war changes. Similarly, the popularity of the stab-in-the-back legend (German: ''Dolchsto\u00dflegende'') was a testament to the psychological state of defeated Germany and was a rejection of responsibility for the conflict. This conspiracy theory of betrayal became common, and the German populace came to see themselves as victims. The widespread acceptance of the \"stab-in-the-back\" theory delegitimised the Weimar government and destabilised the system, opening it to extremes of right and left.\n\nCommunist and fascist movements around Europe drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a new level of popularity. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or harshly affected by the war. [[Adolf Hitler]] was able to gain popularity by using German discontent with the still controversial Treaty of Versailles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/war_end_01.shtml |publisher=BBC |title=The Ending of World War One, and the Legacy of Peace |first=Martin |last=Kitchen}}</ref> World War{{nbsp}}II was in part a continuation of the power struggle never fully resolved by World War{{nbsp}}I.

All these slaughters, it is argued here, had a common origin, the collapse of the elite structure and normal modes of government of much of central, eastern and southern Europe as a result of World War{{nbsp}}I, without which surely neither Communism nor Fascism would have existed except in the minds of unknown agitators and crackpots.<ref>{{cite book |last=Rubinstein |first=W.D. |year=2004 |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=nMMAk4VwLLwC}} |title=Genocide: a history |publisher=Pearson Education |page=7 |isbn=978-0-582-50601-5}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Economic effects===\n{{See also|Economic history of World War I}}\n[[File:The Girl Behind the Gun 1915.jpg|thumb|Poster showing women workers, 1915]]\n\nOne of the most dramatic effects of the war was the expansion of governmental powers and responsibilities in Britain, France, the United States, and the Dominions of the British Empire. To harness all the power of their societies, governments created new ministries and powers. New taxes were levied and laws enacted, all designed to bolster the [[war effort]]; many have lasted to this day. Similarly, the war strained the abilities of some formerly large and bureaucratised governments, such as in Austria-Hungary and Germany.\n\n[[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and the United States), but decreased in France and Russia, in neutral Netherlands, and in the three main Central Powers. The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire ranged between 30% and 40%. In Austria, for example, most pigs were slaughtered, so at war's end there was no meat.\n\nIn all nations, the government's share of GDP increased, surpassing 50% in both Germany and France and nearly reaching that level in Britain. To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily from [[Wall Street]]. President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but allowed a great increase in [[Federal government of the United States|US government]] lending to the Allies. After 1919, the US demanded repayment of these loans. The repayments were, in part, funded by German reparations that, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany. This circular system collapsed in 1931 and some loans were never repaid. Britain still owed the United States $4.4 [[1,000,000,000|billion]]<ref>10{{sup|9}} in this context&nbsp;\u2013 see [[Long and short scales]]</ref> of World War{{nbsp}}I debt in 1934, the last instalment was finally paid in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/562830/First-World-War-debt-paid-off |title=Britain FINALLY pays off last of First World War debt as George Osborne redeems \u00a31.9bn |first=Peter |last=Henn |date=9 March 2015 }}</ref>\n\nMacro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war. Families were altered by the departure of many men. With the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. At the same time, industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war. This aided the struggle for [[suffragette|voting rights for women]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Noakes |first=Lucy |title=Women in the British Army: War and the Gentle Sex, 1907\u20131948 |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=Abingdon, England |isbn=978-0-415-39056-9 |page=48}}</ref>\n\nWorld War I further compounded the gender imbalance, adding to the phenomenon of [[surplus women]]. The deaths of nearly one million men during the war in Britain increased the gender gap by almost a million: from 670,000 to 1,700,000. The number of unmarried women seeking economic means grew dramatically. In addition, demobilisation and economic decline following the war caused high unemployment. The war increased female employment; however, the return of demobilised men displaced many from the workforce, as did the closure of many of the wartime factories.\n\nIn Britain, rationing was finally imposed in early 1918, limited to meat, sugar, and fats (butter and margarine), but not bread. The new system worked smoothly. From 1914 to 1918, trade union membership doubled, from a little over four million to a little over eight million.\n\nBritain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply from traditional sources had become difficult. Geologists such as [[Albert Ernest Kitson]] were called on to find new resources of precious minerals in the African colonies. Kitson discovered important new deposits of [[manganese]], used in munitions production, in the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]].{{sfn |Green |1938 |p=cxxvi}}\n\nArticle 231 of the Treaty of Versailles (the so-called \"war guilt\" clause) stated Germany accepted responsibility for \"all the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments and their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war imposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies.\"<ref>{{cite book |editor1=Anton Kaes |editor2=Martin Jay |editor3=Edward Dimendberg |title=The Weimar Republic Sourcebook |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J4A1gt4-VCsC&pg=PA8 |chapter=The Treaty of Versailles: The Reparations Clauses |year=1994 |publisher=University of California Press |page=8 |isbn=978-0520909601}}</ref> It was worded as such to lay a legal basis for reparations, and a similar clause was inserted in the treaties with Austria and Hungary.

Her mother was a model and her father won five NBA championships with the Los Angeles Lakers. She was also the granddaughter of Joe Bryant and great-niece of John \"Chubby\" Cox.\n\nHer father, Kobe, was the reason she started playing basketball. Bryant played basketball for the Mamba Sports Academy, where she was coached by her father until their tragic death. She played on the competitive team with the club at the U-10 through U-15 levels.\n\nBryant wanted to play college basketball at the power house University of Connecticut, she regularly attended UConn, WNBA, and Lakers games with her father. She had a very close relationship with her father Kobe as she was usually always by her father's side. Kobe would talk about Gianna saying how she was female version of him.\n\n\"This kid, man... I'm telling you, The best thing that happens is when we go out, and fans will come up to me, and she'll be standing next to me, and they will be like, 'You gotta have a boy, you and V [wife Vanessa] gotta have a boy, man, to have somebody carry on the tradition, the legacy.' And [Gigi] is like, 'I got this!'\" Bryant said. \"That's right. Yes, you do. You got this.\"\n\n== Death ==\n\nAt 9:06&nbsp;a.m. Pacific Standard Time on January 26, 2020, a Sikorsky S-76 helicopter departed from John Wayne Airport in Orange County, California, with nine people aboard: Gianna, her father, six family friends, and the pilot. The helicopter was registered to the Fillmore-based Island Express Holding Corp., according to the California Secretary of State business database. The group was traveling to Camarillo Airport in Ventura County for a basketball game at Bryant's Mamba Academy in Thousand Oaks.\n\nDue to light rain and fog that morning, the LAPD helicopters and most other air traffic were grounded. The flight tracker showed that the helicopter circled above the L.A. Zoo due to heavy air traffic in the area. At 9:30&nbsp;a.m. the pilot contacted the Burbank Airport's control tower, notifying the tower of the situation and was told he was \"flying too low\" to be tracked by radar. At that time, the helicopter experienced extreme fog and turned south towards the mountains. At 9:40&nbsp;a.m. the helicopter climbed rapidly from 1,200 to 2,000 feet (370 to 610 m), flying at 161 knots (298&nbsp;km/h; 185&nbsp;mph).\n\nAt 9:45&nbsp;a.m., the helicopter crashed into the side of a mountain in Calabasas, about 30 miles (48&nbsp;km) northwest of downtown Los Angeles, and began burning. Bryant, his daughter, and the other seven occupants were killed. This also started a quarter-acre bush fire. At 9:47&nbsp;a.m. authorities were called. Los Angeles County Fire Department firefighters responded to the scene, and paramedics rappelled from a helicopter to the scene to look for survivors. The fire was difficult to extinguish due to the presence of magnesium, but the fire had been extinguished by 10:30&nbsp;a.m. Initial reports indicated that the helicopter crashed in the hills above Calabasas in heavy fog. Witnesses reported hearing a helicopter struggling before crashing.\n\nOn February 7, Kobe and Gianna Bryant were buried in a private funeral in Pacific View Memorial Park in the Corona del Mar neighborhood of Newport Beach, California. A memorial service will be held on February 24 at the Staples Center in Downtown Los Angeles.\n\n<ref>https://nbafamily.fandom.com/wiki/Gianna_Bryant</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Uncategorized|date=April 2020}}\n", "text_old": "{{db-repost|xfd=Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gianna Bryant (2nd nomination)|help=off}}\n\n#  Biography\n#  Death\n\nGianna Maria Onore Bryant also referred to as \"Gigi\", (May 1, 2006 \u2013 January 26, 2020) was an American middle school basketball player that attended Harbor Day School in Newport Beach, California\n\nBryant and her father Los Angeles Lakers legend Kobe Bryant died on January 26, 2020, in a helicopter crash near Calabasas, California.\n\n===== Biography =====\n\nBorn in Los Angeles, California to Vanessa and Kobe Bryant, Gianna was raised with her older sister Natalia and two younger sisters, Bianka and Capri.

For safety and mechanical reasons, conservators securely fix long case clocks and wall clocks to a wall to avoid accidents and to ensure the clocks area to run properly.

A clean clock environment can eliminate opportunities for dangerous contaminants to come into contact with a clock. An [[HVAC]] system can add an extra level of security by removing such contaminants from the air.\n\n==== Humidity and temperature levels ====\nThe [[humidity]] and [[temperature]] of the environment in which a clock is being displayed or stored can adversely affect the clock's condition. Damage may be avoided by maintaining certain levels of humidity and temperature within the clock environment, dependent on the materials from which the clock is constructed.\n:a. '''Wood clocks'''\n:The ideal humidity and temperature ranges for clocks whose cases are made from wood vary depending on the season. In the summer, an environment with a temperature of 70 to 75 degrees Fahrenheit and 40% to 60% [[relative humidity]] is suitable.<ref name=Fahey /> During the winter, an environment with a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and 35% to 50% relative humidity is prime.<ref name=Fahey />\n:b. '''Metal clocks'''\n:Clocks whose cases are made from metal function well in an environment with a temperature of 68 degrees Fahrenheit and a relative humidity of 30%.<ref name=Fahey />\n\n=== Maintenance ===\n[[File:Prim clockwork.jpg|thumb|The mechanics inside a timepiece]] [[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 22:46, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\nRegular maintenance of a clock can ensure its long-term preservation. Conservation experts advise clocks need to be serviced regularly. A clock is a complex mechanical contraption made of a variety of materials and with many small moving parts <ref>Historical Clocks, 2012. Retrieved from: http://publish.illinois.edu/cuhistoricalclocks/preservation/</ref>. Even in perfect conditions lubricants deteriorate, particularly after three years. Clocks should be examined and re-lubricated every three years.  After five years, and certainly no longer than eight years, the whole movement is advised to be dismantled and \u2018cleaned\u2019 if excessive wear and expensive attention is to be avoided <ref>ICON, (2006).

[[User:Aparmel2JHU|Aparmel2JHU]] ([[User talk:Aparmel2JHU|talk]]) 15:06, 20 April 2020 (UTC)\n\n==== Condition checks ====\nVisual inspection can determine whether a clock should be cleaned and/or lubricated, whether any signs of infestation and/or damage exist, and whether a clock should be wound and/or set to the correct time. \n:a. '''Cleaning, polishing, and lubrication'''\n:Regular clock surface dusting can negate opportunities for corrosion or abrasion as a result of dust buildup. It should be stated that such surface cleaning can also result in a loss of information about a clock\u2019s history, as \u201c[...] various \u201cdirt\u201d or \u201csalt\u201d deposits can provide precious clues to an objects past [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=James|title=Concerns regarding the Conservation of Functional Horological Objects|url= http://cool.conservation-us.org/byauth//moss/concerns.html|website=Conservation OnLine|publisher=Foundation of the American Institute for Conservation|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Dust and other contaminants can also cause clockwork wear, as \u201cthe abrasive particle will become imbedded into the bearing wall and act as a piece of \u201csandpaper [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Regular clockwork activities can also lead to wear, as lubricants are known to degrade over time. Loss of clock function due to clockwork wear can be avoided through regular clockwork cleaning, polishing, and lubrication performed by a trained professional. In performing such maintenance, a professional will disassemble clockwork so that it can be thoroughly examined \u201c[...] for worn or broken parts, fatigued springs and accumulations of dirt or oil.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> \n:b. '''Winding and setting'''\n:In order to function as time keepers, and to prevent damage to clockwork, clocks must be regularly wound. An established winding schedule eliminates the threat of over-winding. Regular winding can also ensure that clockwork is still functioning. In setting the correct time, the minute hand is turned clockwise to the desired time.\n\n== Typical types of damage ==\nDamage can occur via a variety of mechanisms, either rooted in human error or naturally caused.\n\n=== Human interaction ===\n\n:a. '''Mishandling'''\n:The failure of a handler to remove loose items from their person can result in these items striking a clock\u2019s surface. A handler who uses his or her bare hands to touch or transport a clock exposes the clock to contaminants, leaving \u201cunsightly and potentially damaging marks.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> A handler who chooses to drag rather than lift a clock \u201c[...] can place stress on the legs and feet of the clock.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Lifting a clock via false handles or non-sturdy components may cause these parts to snap off of the clock, potentially leading to the clock falling and smashing on a surface.\n:b. '''Over-winding or improper hand setting'''\n:Improper clock winding and hand setting procedures can cause serious damage to clockwork components. The use of an inappropriate key to wind a clock is one such improper procedure. The manner in which a clock is wound is also important, as \u201c[...] considerable and potentially expensive damage can be caused by not winding gently and steadily\u201d,<ref name=ICON /> as well as by turning the key one too many times. \n:In terms of improper hand setting, manually moving the hour or seconds hand rather than the minute hand in an attempt to set the time can be damaging, as can be counterclockwise hand turning.<ref name=ICON /> Moving the minute hand ahead on a clock by several hours when setting the time can also lead to clockwork damage. For this reason, \u201cRather than turning the hands forward through several hours it is better to stop the clock and re-start it when the time matches that on the dial.\u201d <ref name=ICON /> \n:c. '''Unsuitable storage or display''' \n:Unsuitable storage and display environments pose great risks to a clock\u2019s condition. Placement of a clock on an unstable surface or non secure mounting on a wall can cause a clock to fall when external vibrations or human caused accidents occur.\n:d. '''Improper cleaning and polishing'''\n:Many cleaners and polishers contain properties that \u201c[...] have been proven to age poorly.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Resultantly, the use of such cleaners and polishers can prove detrimental. The use of ammonia based cleaning products for example on brass clock components can lead to an irreversible form of damage called [[Stress Corrosion Cracking]].<ref name=Moss /> Depending on the type of metal on which it is used, a metallic brush employed to apply cleaning products not only can create the proper conditions for corrosion, but can \u201c[...] remove any protective oxide layers even with careful use.\u201d <ref name=Moss /> \n:e. '''Improper lubrication'''\n:Attempts by non-professionals to lubricate or repair clockwork can lead to serious damage and loss of clock functionality. A lubricant applied without first cleaning and polishing clockwork to remove the previous lubricant and contaminants can result in wear rather than prevent it.<ref name=Moss /> The combination of the newly applied lubricant with the previous lubricant often results in \u201c[...] an unwanted chemical reaction between the two lubricants [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> A careless lubricant choice can result in the use of inappropriate or \"Poor-quality oil\" on clockwork, which \"can become sticky leading to mechanical problems.\" <ref name=Fahey /> The inexperience of a non-professional can also lead to \u201cthe use of too much oil, or oil in the wrong place\u201d <ref name=ICON /> during attempts to lubricate clockwork. The application of too much of a lubricant can be damaging because it \u201c[...] usually causes the lubrication to run out of the bearing and by capillary action will cause the bearing to go dry.\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Totally ignoring the lubrication needs of clockwork can be jeopardizing not only because of lubricant degradation, but because of the acidic nature of the organic lubricants often used in antique clocks.<ref name=Moss />\n\n=== Natural causes ===\n\n:a. '''Humidity and temperature'''\n:The amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. \u201c[...] extremes in temperature and humidity\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near \"a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements.\" <ref name=ICON /> \n:b. '''Pests'''\n:Clocks are as susceptible to pest damage as any other object constructed from organic materials. Pests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:\n:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''<!--intentional link to DAB page-->- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such \u201c[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.<ref name=Fahey />\n:c. '''Light'''\n:Over-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.<ref name=Fahey /> Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration \u201c[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or \u201calligatored\u201d appearance.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:d. '''Contaminants'''\n[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]\n:Contaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:  \n:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock\u2019s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. \n:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.\n\n=== Types of clock damage ===\nDamage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.\n\n==== Wood damage ====\nDue to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.<ref name=Fahey /> Such changes in character from the wood's original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include \u201c[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\" <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Metal damage ====\nSimilar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This \u201c[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Finish or paint damage ====\nFinish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock's surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products \u201ccan actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.\n\n==== Interior or clockwork damage ====\nClockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.\n\n== Conservation and restoration ==\nInterventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.\n\n=== Conservators ===\n\nA [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to \u201c[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as \u201cSometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].\u201d <ref name=NAWCC>{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.\n\n=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===\n[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]].

'''Humidity and temperature'''\n:The amount of water in the air and temperature of a given environment can play a direct role in clock deterioration. \u201c[...] extremes in temperature and humidity\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> can cause drastic changes in the materials from which a clock is made, inevitably leading to damage. Placement of a clock for example near \"a heat source of any kind, including strong sunlight or a mantel over a working fire [...] can cause damage to cases and movements.\" <ref name=ICON /> \n:b. '''Pests'''\n:Clocks are as susceptible to pest damage as any other object constructed from organic materials. Pests that are known to infest clocks are attracted to the organic materials from which a clock may be constructed:\n:* '''[[Carpet beetle (disambiguation)|Carpet beetle]]'''<!--intentional link to DAB page-->- Attracted to protein-based adhesives sometimes used in clock construction, and as such \u201c[...] are generally found at joinery and inside clock cases.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:* '''[[Powderpost beetle]]'''- Lured by any wood materials from which a clock is constructed, they are known to drill holes into wood.<ref name=Fahey />\n:c. '''Light'''\n:Over-exposure to light can impact clock materials in a number of ways. Heat from a light source can cause the varnish or finish on a clock surface to melt, resulting in a sticky surface to which harmful contaminants can become attached.<ref name=Fahey /> Too much light exposure can also result in changes to finish color, as well as cause finish deterioration \u201c[...] resulting in a cracked, brittle and/or \u201calligatored\u201d appearance.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n:d. '''Contaminants'''\n[[File:Dust_buildup_on_a_clock_case.jpg|thumb|right|Dust buildup on top of a clock case.]]\n:Contaminants themselves vary and come into contact with a clock by way of various means. The following are two such examples:  \n:* '''Dust''' is one such contaminant which settles on a clock\u2019s surface. If not addressed, dust buildup can lead to abrasion and corrosion. \n:* '''Oil''' is transferred to a clock surface when a clock is handled with bare hands. The presence of oil on a clock can cause damage, particularly corrosion when metal clock components are touched.\n\n=== Types of clock damage ===\nDamage can impact all components and materials from which a clock may be constructed.\n\n==== Wood damage ====\nDue to its porous nature, wood is significantly impacted through contact with water. When humidity is high, the excess water in the air is absorbed, resulting in wood expansion, while little to no water in the air when humidity is low can cause wood shrinkage.<ref name=Fahey /> Such changes in character from the wood's original state can lead to damage. Types of low humidity-related wood damage include \u201c[...] structural cracks, lifting veneer and inlays, gaps in joints and the embrittlement of adhesives.\" <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Metal damage ====\nSimilar to wood, interaction with water can also prove detrimental to metal. When contaminants come into contact with metal, they either combine with any present moisture or attract moisture to the metal. This \u201c[...] combination with moisture can produce corrosion.\u201d <ref name=Fahey />\n\n==== Finish or paint damage ====\nFinish damage can occur as a result of the use of cleaning products and/or polishes on a clock's surface. Rather than perform their intended duty to assist in the preservation of a clock, some products \u201ccan actually darken or become opaque with age, resulting in a dark, dull and often irreparable finish.\u201d <ref name=Fahey /> Any words or images painted on a clock surface can become faded or even removed when these delicate pieces are touched and exposed to moisture from hands.\n\n==== Interior or clockwork damage ====\nClockwork damage can be inflicted via over-winding, interaction with contaminants, ill-advised lubrication, and clock movement when a pendulum is not secured prior to the clock being moved. A free swinging pendulum can itself be damaged and can inflict damage onto other interior components during such clock movement.\n\n== Conservation and restoration ==\nInterventive actions can be taken by trained conservators when clock issues arise, with treatment varying depending on the type of clock and situation.\n\n=== Conservators ===\n\nA [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] who specializes in clock care will have the qualifications and training to properly treat a clock with the wherewithal to \u201c[...] not totally compromise the historical worth of the object [...].\u201d <ref name=Moss /> Conservators rely on a system of examination, documentation, and research prior to treatment so that proper treatment is received, as \u201cSometimes the only way one can understand the detailed history, quirks, and specific eccentricities common to a particular timepiece is by studying it to glean as much information from it as possible [...].\u201d <ref name=NAWCC>{{cite web|title=Horological Conservation|url= http://www.nawcc.org/index.php/member-resources/horological-conservation<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=NAWCC|publisher=National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Aside from pinpointing clock issues and providing care to a clock in need, conservators are also able to impart knowledge about procedures like clock winding to ill-informed clock owners so that future clock damage due to human error may be avoided.\n\n=== Example: Anglesey Abbey Pagoda Clock ===\n[[Horological]] conservators at West Dean College were responsible for the treatment of an 18th-century pagoda clock sent from the historic house [[Anglesey Abbey]] by the [[National Trust]]. In starting the project, examination of the clock revealed that \"The automata and clock elements seem to be running, but struggling, and the music sounds as though it needs a few extra hands to help play its tune.\" <ref>{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=Anglesey Abbey\u2019s Pagoda Clock|url=http://westdeanconservation.com/2012/06/05/anglesey-abbeys-pagoda-clock/|date=5 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref> The clock was then disassembled, and care was taken to document information about each of the over 600 components both textually and photographically, including measurements and where each component fits within the clock. \"After examination, each component was cleaned and dried, wrapped in acid-free tissue, and stored with the catalogue number.\" <ref>{{cite web|last1=Cox|first1=Brittany N.|title=The Pagoda Part 2|url=http://westdeanconservation.com/2012/06/28/the-pagoda-part-2/|date=28 June 2012|website=Current Projects|publisher=West Dean Conservation|accessdate=20 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Cultural Conservation-Restoration |state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Clocks]]\n[[Category:Conservation and restoration]]\n[[Hr:Konzervacija satova]]\n", "name_user": "Aparmel2JHU", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eStorage and display", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_and_restoration_of_clocks"}

However, other orbital families exist with significant populations, including the [[near-Earth object]]s. Individual asteroids are classified by their characteristic [[Emission spectrum|spectra]], with the majority falling into three main groups: [[C-type asteroid|C-type]], [[M-type asteroid|M-type]], and [[S-type asteroid|S-type]]. These were named after and are generally identified with [[Carbon|carbon-rich]], [[metal]]lic, and [[silicate]] (stony) compositions, respectively.

He discovered a new star-like object in [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and followed the displacement of this object during several nights. Later that year, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] used these observations to calculate the orbit of this unknown object, which was found to be between the planets [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]].

After eight more years of fruitless searches, most astronomers assumed that there were no more and abandoned any further searches.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nHowever, [[Karl Ludwig Hencke]] persisted, and began searching for more asteroids in 1830. Fifteen years later, he found [[5 Astraea]], the first new asteroid in 38 years. He also found [[6 Hebe]] less than two years later. After this, other astronomers joined in the search and at least one new asteroid was discovered every year after that (except the wartime years 1944 and 1945). Notable asteroid hunters of this early era were [[John Russell Hind|J. R. Hind]], [[Annibale de Gasparis]], [[Karl Theodor Robert Luther|Robert Luther]], [[Hermann Mayer Salomon Goldschmidt|H. M. S.

This dramatically increased the rate of detection compared with earlier visual methods: Wolf alone discovered 248 asteroids, beginning with [[323 Brucia]], whereas only slightly more than 300 had been discovered up to that point.

First, a region of the sky was [[Astrophotography|photographed]] by a wide-field [[telescope]], or [[astrograph]]. Pairs of photographs were taken, typically one hour apart. Multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days. Second, the two films or [[photographic plate|plates]] of the same region were viewed under a [[stereoscope]]. Any body in orbit around the Sun would move slightly between the pair of films. Under the stereoscope, the image of the body would seem to float slightly above the background of stars. Third, once a moving body was identified, its location would be measured precisely using a digitizing microscope. The location would be measured relative to known star locations.<ref>{{cite web | last=Chapman | first=Mary G. | date=17 May 1992 | url=https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/About/People/CarolynShoemaker | title=Carolyn Shoemaker, Planetary Astronomer and Most Successful 'Comet Hunter' To Date | publisher=USGS | accessdate=15 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nThese first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery: the observer has only found an apparition, which gets a [[provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]], made up of the year of discovery, a letter representing the half-month of discovery, and finally a letter and a number indicating the discovery's sequential number (example: {{mp|1998 FJ|74}}).\n\nThe last step of discovery is to send the locations and time of observations to the [[Minor Planet Center]], where computer programs determine whether an apparition ties together earlier apparitions into a single orbit. If so, the object receives a catalogue number and the observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer, and granted the honor of naming the object subject to the approval of the [[International Astronomical Union]].\n\n=== Computerized methods ===\n[[File:Asteroid 2004 FH.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|[[2004 FH]] is the center dot being followed by the sequence; the object that flashes by during the clip is an [[satellite|artificial satellite]].]]\n[[File:Known NEAs.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Cumulative discoveries of just the near-Earth asteroids known by size, 1980\u20132017]]\nThere is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross [[Earth]]'s, and that could, given enough time, collide with Earth ''(see [[List of Earth-crossing minor planets|Earth-crosser asteroids]])''. The three most important groups of [[near-Earth asteroid]]s are the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollos]], [[Amor asteroid|Amors]], and [[Aten asteroid|Atens]]. Various [[asteroid deflection strategies]] have been proposed, as early as the 1960s<!--- ''Project Icarus'' --->.\n\nThe [[near-Earth object|near-Earth]] asteroid [[433 Eros]] had been discovered as long ago as 1898, and the 1930s brought a flurry of similar objects. In order of discovery, these were: [[1221 Amor]], [[1862 Apollo]], [[2101 Adonis]], and finally [[69230 Hermes]], which approached within 0.005&nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] of [[Earth]] in 1937. Astronomers began to realize the possibilities of Earth impact.\n\nTwo events in later decades increased the alarm: the increasing acceptance of the [[Alvarez hypothesis]] that an [[impact event]] resulted in the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction]], and the 1994 observation of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] crashing into [[Jupiter]]. The U.S. military also declassified the information that its [[military satellite]]s, built to [[detect nuclear explosions]], had detected hundreds of upper-atmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to ten meters across.\n\nAll these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient surveys that consist of charge-coupled device ([[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]) cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes. {{As of|2011}}, it was estimated that 89% to 96% of near-Earth asteroids one kilometer or larger in diameter had been discovered.<ref name=nasa_neo/> A list of teams using such systems includes:<ref>{{cite web\n | last=Yeomans | first=Don\n | url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/programs/\n | title=Near Earth Object Search Programs\n | publisher=NASA | accessdate=15 April 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080424093951/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/programs/| archivedate= 24 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n | url=https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/site_all.html\n | title=Discovery Statistics{{Snd}} by Survey (all)\n | publisher=NASA\n | access-date=27 December 2018\n | date=27 December 2018\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228041653/https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/site_all.html\n | archive-date=28 December 2018\n | url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] (LINEAR)\n* [[Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking]] (NEAT)\n* [[Spacewatch]]\n* [[LONEOS|Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search]] (LONEOS)\n* [[Catalina Sky Survey]] (CSS)\n* [[Pan-STARRS]]\n* [[NEOWISE]]\n* [[Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System]] (ATLAS)\n* [[Campo Imperatore Near-Earth Object Survey]] (CINEOS)\n* [[Japanese Spaceguard Association]]\n* [[Asiago-DLR Asteroid Survey]] (ADAS)\n\n{{as of|2018|10|29}}, the LINEAR system alone has discovered 147,132 asteroids.<ref>{{cite web |title=Minor Planet Discover Sites |website= International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Center |accessdate=27 December 2018 |url=https://minorplanetcenter.net//iau/lists/MPDiscSites.html}}</ref> Among all the surveys, 19,266 near-Earth asteroids have been discovered<ref>{{cite web|url=https://minorplanetcenter.net//iau/lists/Unusual.html|title=Unusual Minor Planets|website=International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Center|accessdate=27 December 2018}}<!--- using the \"close approach\" quote ---></ref> including almost 900 more than {{cvt|1|km|1}} in diameter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/totals.html|title=Discovery Statistics{{Snd}} Cumulative Totals|date=20 December 2018|access-date=27 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Terminology{{anchor|Terminology}} == <!-- Linked from \"Comet\" -->\n[[File:Euler diagram of solar system bodies.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Euler diagram]] showing the types of bodies in the Solar System.

The main difference between an asteroid and a comet is that a comet shows a coma due to [[Outgassing|sublimation]] of near surface ices by solar radiation. A few objects have ended up being dual-listed because they were first classified as minor planets but later showed evidence of cometary activity. Conversely, some (perhaps all) comets are eventually depleted of their surface [[volatiles|volatile ices]] and become asteroid-like.

These inhabit the cold outer reaches of the Solar System where ices remain solid and comet-like bodies are not expected to exhibit much cometary activity; if centaurs or trans-Neptunian objects were to venture close to the Sun, their volatile ices would sublimate, and traditional approaches would classify them as comets and not asteroids.\n\nThe innermost of these are the [[Kuiper belt|Kuiper-belt objects]], called \"objects\" partly to avoid the need to classify them as asteroids or comets.<ref name=KBOasteroids>{{cite news |url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=601 |title=Are Kuiper Belt Objects asteroids? |work=Ask an astronomer |publisher=Cornell University |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103110110/http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=601 |archivedate=3 January 2009 }}</ref> They are thought to be predominantly comet-like in composition, though some may be more akin to asteroids.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect19/Sect19_22.html |author=Nicholas M.

The last can only be determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have. So far, every asteroid with moons has turned out to be a rubble pile, a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may be half empty space by volume. The investigated asteroids are as large as 280&nbsp;km in diameter, and include [[121 Hermione]] (268\u00d7186\u00d7183&nbsp;km), and [[87 Sylvia]] (384\u00d7262\u00d7232&nbsp;km). Only half a dozen asteroids are [[List of notable asteroids#Largest by diameter|larger than 87 Sylvia]], though none of them have moons; however, some smaller asteroids are thought to be more massive, suggesting they may not have been disrupted, and indeed [[511 Davida]], the same size as Sylvia to within measurement error, is estimated to be two and a half times as massive, though this is highly uncertain. The fact that such large asteroids as Sylvia can be rubble piles, presumably due to disruptive impacts, has important consequences for the formation of the Solar System: Computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging, but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge. This means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quickly.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Icarus |volume=211 |issue=2 |date=February 2011 |pages=1022\u20131033 |title=Triplicity and physical characteristics of Asteroid (216) Kleopatra |display-authors=3 |first1=P. |last1=Descamps |first2=F. |last2=Marchis |first3=J. |last3=Berthier |first4=J.P. |last4=Emery |first5=G. |last5=Duch\u00eane |first6=I. |last6=de Pater |first7=M.H. |last7=Wong |first8=L. |last8=Lim |first9=H.B. |last9=Hammel |first10=F. |last10=Vachier |first11=P. |last11=Wiggins |first12=J.-P. |last12=Teng-Chuen-Yu |first13=A. |last13=Peyrot |first14=J. |last14=Pollock |first15=M. |last15=Assafin |first16=R. |last16=Vieira-Martinsa |first17=J.I.B. |last17=Camargoi |first18=F. |last18=Braga-Ribas |first19=B. |last19=Macomberk |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2010.11.016|arxiv=1011.5263 |bibcode=2011Icar..211.1022D }}</ref>\n\nOn 7 October 2009, the presence of [[ice|water ice]] was confirmed on the surface of [[24 Themis]] using [[NASA]]'s [[Infrared Telescope Facility]].

Apart from the broadest divisions, it is customary to name a group of asteroids after the first member of that group to be discovered. Groups are relatively loose dynamical associations, whereas families are tighter and result from the catastrophic break-up of a large parent asteroid sometime in the past.<ref>{{cite journal\n |display-authors=3 | last=Zappal\u00e0 | first=V. |first2=Ph. |last2=Bendjoya |first3=A. |last3=Cellino |first4=P. |last4=Farinella |first5=C. |last5=Froeschl\u00e9\n | title=Asteroid families: Search of a 12,487-asteroid sample using two different clustering techniques\n | journal=Icarus | date=1995 | volume=116\n | issue=2 | pages=291\u2013314\n | bibcode=1995Icar..116..291Z\n | doi=10.1006/icar.1995.1127 }}</ref> Families are more common and easier to identify within the main asteroid belt, but several small families have been reported among the [[Jupiter trojan]]s.<ref name=\"Jewitt2004\">{{cite book |last=Jewitt |first=David C. |last2=Sheppard |first2=Scott |last3=Porco |first3=Carolyn |chapter=Jupiter's Outer Satellites and Trojans |title=Jupiter: The Planet, Satellites and Magnetosphere |date=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |editor=Bagenal, F. |editor2=Dowling, T.E. |editor3=McKinnon, W.B. |chapter-url=http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/users/sheppard/pub/Sheppard04JupChapter.pdf }}</ref> Main belt families were first recognized by [[Kiyotsugu Hirayama]] in 1918 and are often called [[Hirayama families]] in his honor.\n\nAbout 30\u201335% of the bodies in the asteroid belt belong to dynamical families each thought to have a common origin in a past collision between asteroids. A family has also been associated with the plutoid [[dwarf planet]] {{dp|Haumea}}.\n\n==== Quasi-satellites and horseshoe objects ====\nSome asteroids have unusual [[horseshoe orbit]]s that are co-orbital with [[Earth]] or some other planet. Examples are [[3753 Cruithne]] and {{mpl|2002 AA|29}}. The first instance of this type of orbital arrangement was discovered between [[Saturn]]'s moons [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]] and [[Janus (moon)|Janus]].\n\nSometimes these horseshoe objects temporarily become [[quasi-satellite]]s for a few decades or a few hundred years, before returning to their earlier status. Both Earth and [[Venus]] are known to have quasi-satellites.\n\nSuch objects, if associated with Earth or Venus or even hypothetically [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], are a special class of [[Aten asteroid]]s. However, such objects could be associated with outer planets as well.\n\n=== Spectral classification ===\n{{Main|Asteroid spectral types}}\n[[File:433eros.jpg|thumb|This picture of [[433 Eros]] shows the view looking from one end of the asteroid across the gouge on its underside and toward the opposite end. Features as small as {{cvt|35|m|0}} across can be seen.]]\nIn 1975, an asteroid [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] system based on [[color]], [[albedo]], and [[spectral line|spectral shape]] was developed by [[Clark R. Chapman]], [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]], and [[Ben Zellner]].<ref>{{cite journal | first=C.R. | last=Chapman | title=Surface properties of asteroids: A synthesis of polarimetry, radiometry, and spectrophotometry | journal=Icarus | volume=25 | issue=1 | pages=104\u2013130 | bibcode=1975Icar...25..104C | date=1975 | doi=10.1016/0019-1035(75)90191-8 | last2=Morrison | first2=David | last3=Zellner | first3=Ben}}</ref> These properties are thought to correspond to the composition of the asteroid's surface material. The original classification system had three categories: [[C-type asteroid|C-types]] for dark carbonaceous objects (75% of known asteroids), [[S-type asteroid|S-types]] for stony (silicaceous) objects (17% of known asteroids) and U for those that did not fit into either C or S. This classification has since been expanded to include many other asteroid types. The number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied.\n\nThe two most widely used taxonomies now used are the [[Tholen classification]] and [[SMASS classification]]. The former was proposed in 1984 by [[David J. Tholen]], and was based on data collected from an eight-color asteroid survey performed in the 1980s. This resulted in 14 asteroid categories.<ref>{{cite conference | last=Tholen | first=D.J. | title=Asteroid taxonomic classifications | booktitle=Asteroids II; Proceedings of the Conference | pages=1139\u20131150 | publisher=University of Arizona Press | date=1989 | bibcode=1989aste.conf.1139T}}</ref> In 2002, the Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey resulted in a modified version of the Tholen taxonomy with 24 different types. Both systems have three broad categories of C, S, and X asteroids, where X consists of mostly metallic asteroids, such as the [[M-type asteroid|M-type]]. There are also several smaller classes.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Bus | first=S.J. | title=Phase II of the Small Main-belt Asteroid Spectroscopy Survey: A feature-based taxonomy | journal=Icarus | date=2002 | volume=158 | issue=1 | page=146 | doi=10.1006/icar.2002.6856 | bibcode=2002Icar..158..146B| url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7332ce5163551b5ad96203e710f02ede89a832d9 }}</ref>\n\nThe proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type; some types are easier to detect than others, biasing the totals.\n\n==== Problems ====\nOriginally, spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroid's composition.<ref>{{cite book | first=Harry Y. | last=McSween Jr. | date=1999 | title=Meteorites and their Parent Planets | edition=2nd | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-521-58751-8 }}</ref> However, the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good, and a variety of classifications are in use. This has led to significant confusion. Although asteroids of different spectral classifications are likely to be composed of different materials, there are no assurances that asteroids within the same taxonomic class are composed of similar materials.\n\n== Naming ==\n{{Main|Minor planet#Naming}}\n[[File:Asteroid20130318-full.jpg|thumb|right|[[2013 EC]], shown here in radar images, has a provisional designation]]\nA newly discovered asteroid is given a [[Provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]] (such as {{mpl|2002 AT|4}}) consisting of the year of discovery and an alphanumeric code indicating the [[half-month]] of discovery and the sequence within that half-month. Once an asteroid's orbit has been confirmed, it is given a number, and later may also be given a name (e.g. [[433 Eros]]). The formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number (e.g. (433) Eros), but dropping the parentheses is quite common. Informally, it is common to drop the number altogether, or to drop it after the first mention when a name is repeated in running text.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Naming of Asteroids|url=http://www.open.edu/openlearn/science-maths-technology/science/physics-and-astronomy/astronomy/the-naming-asteroids|website=Open Learn|publisher=The Open University|accessdate=14 August 2016}}</ref> In addition, names can be proposed by the asteroid's discoverer, within guidelines established by the International Astronomical Union.<ref>{{cite web|title=Asteroid Naming Guidelines|url=http://www.planetary.org/get-involved/contests/osirisrex/guidelines.html|website=The Planetary Society|publisher=The Planetary Society|accessdate=14 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Symbols ===\n{{main|Astronomical symbols}}\nThe first asteroids to be discovered were assigned iconic symbols like the ones traditionally used to designate the planets.

He introduced a disk (circle), a traditional symbol for a star, as the generic symbol for an asteroid. The circle was then numbered in order of discovery to indicate a specific asteroid (although he assigned \u2460 to the fifth, [[5 Astraea|Astraea]], while continuing to designate the first four only with their existing iconic symbols). The numbered-circle convention was quickly adopted by astronomers, and the next asteroid to be discovered ([[16 Psyche]], in 1852) was the first to be designated in that way at the time of its discovery. However, Psyche was given an iconic symbol as well, as were a few other asteroids discovered over the next few years (see chart above). [[20 Massalia]] was the first asteroid that was not assigned an iconic symbol, and no iconic symbols were created after the 1855 discovery of [[37 Fides]].<ref group=note>Except for Pluto and, in the astrological community, for a few outer bodies such as [[2060 Chiron]]</ref> That year Astraea's number was increased to \u2464, but the first four asteroids, Ceres to Vesta, were not listed by their numbers until the 1867 edition. The circle was soon abbreviated to a pair of parentheses, which were easier to typeset and sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades, leading to the modern convention.<ref name=\"hilton\"/>\n\n== Exploration ==\n{{see also|Sample return mission|Asteroid mining|Colonization of the asteroids}}\n[[File:Eros rotation Dec. 3-4 2000.gif|thumb|Eros as seen by visiting spacecraft]]\nUntil the age of [[Spaceflight|space travel]], objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes and their shapes and terrain remained a mystery. The best modern ground-based telescopes and the Earth-orbiting [[Hubble Space Telescope]] can resolve a small amount of detail on the surfaces of the largest asteroids, but even these mostly remain little more than fuzzy blobs. Limited information about the shapes and compositions of asteroids can be inferred from their [[light curve]]s (their variation in brightness as they rotate) and their spectral properties, and asteroid sizes can be estimated by timing the lengths of star occulations (when an asteroid passes directly in front of a star). [[Radar]] imaging can yield good information about asteroid shapes and orbital and rotational parameters, especially for near-Earth asteroids.

These images revealed the irregular, potato-like shapes of most asteroids, as did later images from the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes of the small moons of the [[gas giant]]s.\n\nThe first true asteroid to be photographed in close-up was [[951 Gaspra]] in 1991, followed in 1993 by [[243 Ida]] and its moon [[Dactyl (asteroid)|Dactyl]], all of which were imaged by the [[Galileo

Larger asteroids have also been called '''planetoids'''. These terms have historically been applied to any astronomical object orbiting the [[Sun]] that did not resolve into a disc in a telescope and was not observed to have characteristics of an active [[comet]] such as a tail. As [[Distant minor planet|minor planets in the outer Solar System]] were discovered that were found to have [[Volatiles|volatile]]-rich surfaces similar to comets, these came to be distinguished from the objects found in the main [[asteroid belt]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/?asteroids |title=Asteroids |website=NASA{{Snd}} Jet Propulsion Laboratory |accessdate=13 September 2010}}</ref> In this article, the term \"asteroid\" refers to the minor planets of the inner Solar System, including those co-orbital with [[Jupiter]].\n\nThere exist millions of asteroids, many the shattered remnants of [[planetesimal]]s, bodies within the young Sun's [[solar nebula]] that never grew large enough to become [[planet]]s.<ref>{{cite web |website=CNEOS |title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs){{Snd}} What Are Asteroids And Comets? |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/#ast |accessdate=13 September 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100909210213/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/faq/ |archivedate= 9 September 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The vast majority of known asteroids orbit within the main asteroid belt located between the orbits of [[Mars]] and Jupiter, or are co-orbital with Jupiter (the [[Jupiter trojan]]s). However, other orbital families exist with significant populations, including the [[near-Earth object]]s. Individual asteroids are classified by their characteristic [[Emission spectrum|spectra]], with the majority falling into three main groups: [[C-type asteroid|C-type]], [[M-type asteroid|M-type]], and [[S-type asteroid|S-type]]. These were named after and are generally identified with [[Carbon|carbon-rich]], [[metal]]lic, and [[silicate]] (stony) compositions, respectively. The sizes of asteroids varies greatly; the largest, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], is almost {{cvt|1000|sigfig=1|km}} across and massive enough to qualify as a [[dwarf planet]].\n\nAsteroids are somewhat arbitrarily differentiated from [[comet]]s and [[meteoroid]]s. In the case of comets, the difference is one of composition: while asteroids are mainly composed of mineral and rock, comets are primarily composed of dust and ice. Furthermore, asteroids formed closer to the sun, preventing the development of cometary ice.<ref>{{cite web |title=What is the difference between an asteroid and a comet?|url=http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/181-What-is-the-difference-between-an-asteroid-and-a-comet- |website=Cool Cosmos |publisher=Infrared Processing and Analysis Center |accessdate=13 August 2016}}</ref> The difference between asteroids and meteoroids is mainly one of size: meteoroids have a diameter of one meter or less, whereas asteroids have a diameter of greater than one meter.<ref name=Rubin2010>{{cite journal |last1=Rubin |first1=Alan E. |last2=Grossman |first2=Jeffrey N. |title=Meteorite and meteoroid: new comprehensive definitions |journal=Meteoritics and Planetary Science |date=January 2010 |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=114\u2013122 |bibcode=2010M&PS...45..114R |doi=10.1111/j.1945-5100.2009.01009.x |doi-access=free}}</ref> Finally, meteoroids can be composed of either cometary or asteroidal materials.<ref name=\"Universe Today\">{{cite web |title=What is the difference between asteroids and meteorites? |url=http://www.universetoday.com/36398/what-is-the-difference-between-asteroids-and-meteorites/ |website=Universe Today |last=Atkinson |first=Nancy |date=2 June 2015 |accessdate=13 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nOnly one asteroid, [[4 Vesta]], which has a relatively [[Albedo|reflective surface]], is normally visible to the naked eye, and this only in very dark skies when it is favorably positioned.

He discovered a new star-like object in [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]] and followed the displacement of this object during several nights. Later that year, [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] used these observations to calculate the orbit of this unknown object, which was found to be between the planets [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]]. Piazzi named it after [[Ceres (Roman mythology)|Ceres]], the Roman goddess of agriculture.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThree other asteroids ([[2 Pallas]], [[3 Juno]], and [[4 Vesta]]) were discovered over the next few years, with Vesta found in 1807. After eight more years of fruitless searches, most astronomers assumed that there were no more and abandoned any further searches.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nHowever, [[Karl Ludwig Hencke]] persisted, and began searching for more asteroids in 1830. Fifteen years later, he found [[5 Astraea]], the first new asteroid in 38 years. He also found [[6 Hebe]] less than two years later. After this, other astronomers joined in the search and at least one new asteroid was discovered every year after that (except the wartime years 1944 and 1945). Notable asteroid hunters of this early era were [[John Russell Hind|J. R. Hind]], [[Annibale de Gasparis]], [[Karl Theodor Robert Luther|Robert Luther]], [[Hermann Mayer Salomon Goldschmidt|H. M. S.

This dramatically increased the rate of detection compared with earlier visual methods: Wolf alone discovered 248 asteroids, beginning with [[323 Brucia]], whereas only slightly more than 300 had been discovered up to that point.

First, a region of the sky was [[Astrophotography|photographed]] by a wide-field [[telescope]], or [[astrograph]]. Pairs of photographs were taken, typically one hour apart. Multiple pairs could be taken over a series of days. Second, the two films or [[photographic plate|plates]] of the same region were viewed under a [[stereoscope]]. Any body in orbit around the Sun would move slightly between the pair of films. Under the stereoscope, the image of the body would seem to float slightly above the background of stars.

The location would be measured relative to known star locations.<ref>{{cite web | last=Chapman | first=Mary G. | date=17 May 1992 | url=https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/About/People/CarolynShoemaker | title=Carolyn Shoemaker, Planetary Astronomer and Most Successful 'Comet Hunter' To Date | publisher=USGS | accessdate=15 April 2008}}</ref>\n\nThese first three steps do not constitute asteroid discovery: the observer has only found an apparition, which gets a [[provisional designation in astronomy|provisional designation]], made up of the year of discovery, a letter representing the half-month of discovery, and finally a letter and a number indicating the discovery's sequential number (example: {{mp|1998 FJ|74}}).\n\nThe last step of discovery is to send the locations and time of observations to the [[Minor Planet Center]], where computer programs determine whether an apparition ties together earlier apparitions into a single orbit. If so, the object receives a catalogue number and the observer of the first apparition with a calculated orbit is declared the discoverer, and granted the honor of naming the object subject to the approval of the [[International Astronomical Union]].\n\n=== Computerized methods ===\n[[File:Asteroid 2004 FH.gif|thumb|upright=1.2|[[2004 FH]] is the center dot being followed by the sequence; the object that flashes by during the clip is an [[satellite|artificial satellite]].]]\n[[File:Known NEAs.png|thumb|upright=1.2|Cumulative discoveries of just the near-Earth asteroids known by size, 1980\u20132017]]\nThere is increasing interest in identifying asteroids whose orbits cross [[Earth]]'s, and that could, given enough time, collide with Earth ''(see [[List of Earth-crossing minor planets|Earth-crosser asteroids]])''. The three most important groups of [[near-Earth asteroid]]s are the [[Apollo asteroid|Apollos]], [[Amor asteroid|Amors]], and [[Aten asteroid|Atens]]. Various [[asteroid deflection strategies]] have been proposed, as early as the 1960s<!--- ''Project Icarus'' --->.\n\nThe [[near-Earth object|near-Earth]] asteroid [[433 Eros]] had been discovered as long ago as 1898, and the 1930s brought a flurry of similar objects. In order of discovery, these were: [[1221 Amor]], [[1862 Apollo]], [[2101 Adonis]], and finally [[69230 Hermes]], which approached within 0.005&nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] of [[Earth]] in 1937. Astronomers began to realize the possibilities of Earth impact.\n\nTwo events in later decades increased the alarm: the increasing acceptance of the [[Alvarez hypothesis]] that an [[impact event]] resulted in the [[Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event|Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction]], and the 1994 observation of [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9]] crashing into [[Jupiter]]. The U.S. military also declassified the information that its [[military satellite]]s, built to [[detect nuclear explosions]], had detected hundreds of upper-atmosphere impacts by objects ranging from one to ten meters across.\n\nAll these considerations helped spur the launch of highly efficient surveys that consist of charge-coupled device ([[Charge-coupled device|CCD]]) cameras and computers directly connected to telescopes. {{As of|2011}}, it was estimated that 89% to 96% of near-Earth asteroids one kilometer or larger in diameter had been discovered.<ref name=nasa_neo/> A list of teams using such systems includes:<ref>{{cite web\n | last=Yeomans | first=Don\n | url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/programs/\n | title=Near Earth Object Search Programs\n | publisher=NASA | accessdate=15 April 2008 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080424093951/http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/programs/| archivedate= 24 April 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite web\n | url=https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/site_all.html\n | title=Discovery Statistics{{Snd}} by Survey (all)\n | publisher=NASA\n | access-date=27 December 2018\n | date=27 December 2018\n | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228041653/https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/site_all.html\n | archive-date=28 December 2018\n | url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] (LINEAR)\n* [[Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking]] (NEAT)\n* [[Spacewatch]]\n* [[LONEOS|Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search]] (LONEOS)\n* [[Catalina Sky Survey]] (CSS)\n* [[Pan-STARRS]]\n* [[NEOWISE]]\n* [[Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System]] (ATLAS)\n* [[Campo Imperatore Near-Earth Object Survey]] (CINEOS)\n* [[Japanese Spaceguard Association]]\n* [[Asiago-DLR Asteroid Survey]] (ADAS)\n\n{{as of|2018|10|29}}, the LINEAR system alone has discovered 147,132 asteroids.<ref>{{cite web |title=Minor Planet Discover Sites |website= International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Center |accessdate=27 December 2018 |url=https://minorplanetcenter.net//iau/lists/MPDiscSites.html}}</ref> Among all the surveys, 19,266 near-Earth asteroids have been discovered<ref>{{cite web|url=https://minorplanetcenter.net//iau/lists/Unusual.html|title=Unusual Minor Planets|website=International Astronomical Union Minor Planet Center|accessdate=27 December 2018}}<!--- using the \"close approach\" quote ---></ref> including almost 900 more than {{cvt|1|km|1}} in diameter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/totals.html|title=Discovery Statistics{{Snd}} Cumulative Totals|date=20 December 2018|access-date=27 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Terminology{{anchor|Terminology}} == <!-- Linked from \"Comet\" -->\n[[File:Euler diagram of solar system bodies.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|[[Euler diagram]] showing the types of bodies in the Solar System.

The main difference between an asteroid and a comet is that a comet shows a coma due to [[Outgassing|sublimation]] of near surface ices by solar radiation. A few objects have ended up being dual-listed because they were first classified as minor planets but later showed evidence of cometary activity. Conversely, some (perhaps all) comets are eventually depleted of their surface [[volatiles|volatile ices]] and become asteroid-like. A further distinction is that comets typically have more eccentric orbits than most asteroids; most \"asteroids\" with notably eccentric orbits are probably dormant or extinct comets.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Weissman, Paul R.|author2= Bottke, William F.

Then, when the first [[trans-Neptunian object]] (other than [[Pluto]]), [[15760 Albion|Albion]], was discovered in 1992, and especially when large numbers of similar objects started turning up, new terms were invented to sidestep the issue: [[Kuiper belt|Kuiper-belt object]], [[trans-Neptunian object]], [[scattered-disc object]], and so on. These inhabit the cold outer reaches of the Solar System where ices remain solid and comet-like bodies are not expected to exhibit much cometary activity; if centaurs or trans-Neptunian objects were to venture close to the Sun, their volatile ices would sublimate, and traditional approaches would classify them as comets and not asteroids.\n\nThe innermost of these are the [[Kuiper belt|Kuiper-belt objects]], called \"objects\" partly to avoid the need to classify them as asteroids or comets.<ref name=KBOasteroids>{{cite news |url=http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=601 |title=Are Kuiper Belt Objects asteroids? |work=Ask an astronomer |publisher=Cornell University |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103110110/http://curious.astro.cornell.edu/question.php?number=601 |archivedate=3 January 2009 }}</ref> They are thought to be predominantly comet-like in composition, though some may be more akin to asteroids.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect19/Sect19_22.html |author=Nicholas M.

These asteroids may be remnants of the [[protoplanetary disk]], and in this region the [[accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] of [[planetesimal]]s into planets during the formative period of the Solar System was prevented by large gravitational perturbations by [[Jupiter]].\n\n=== Trojans ===\n{{main|Trojan (astronomy)}}\n[[Trojan (astronomy)|Trojans]] are populations that share an orbit with a larger planet or moon, but do not collide with it because they orbit in one of the two [[Lagrangian point]]s of stability, [[Trojan points|L4 and L5]], which lie 60\u00b0 ahead of and behind the larger body.\nThe most significant population of trojans are the [[Jupiter trojan]]s. Although fewer Jupiter trojans have been discovered ({{as of|2010}}), it is thought that they are as numerous as the asteroids in the asteroid belt. Trojans have been found in the orbits of other planets, including [[Venus trojan|Venus]], [[Earth trojan|Earth]], [[Mars trojan|Mars]], [[Uranus trojan|Uranus]], and [[Neptune trojan|Neptune]].\n\n=== Near-Earth asteroids ===\n[[File:Asteroids-KnownNearEarthObjects-Animation-UpTo20180101.gif|thumb|upright=1.7|<center>Known [[Near-Earth objects]]{{Snd}} as of January 2018<br />[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfvo-Ujb_qk Video (0:55; July 23, 2018)]</center>]]\n[[File:SmallAsteroidImpacts-Frequency-Bolide-20141114.jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Frequency of [[bolide]]s, small asteroids roughly 1 to 20 meters in diameter impacting Earth's atmosphere]]{{main|Near-Earth object#Near-Earth asteroids|l1=Near-Earth asteroids}}\nNear-Earth asteroids, or NEAs, are asteroids that have orbits that pass close to that of Earth. Asteroids that actually cross Earth's orbital path are known as ''Earth-crossers''. {{As of|2016|06}}, 14,464 near-Earth asteroids are known<ref name=nasa_neo>{{cite web |title=Discovery Statistics |url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/ |website=CNEOS |accessdate=15 June 2016}}</ref> and the number over one kilometer in diameter is estimated to be 900\u20131,000.\n\n== Characteristics ==\n\n=== Size distribution ===\n[[File:Asteroids by size and number.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|The asteroids of the Solar System, categorized by size and number]]\nAsteroids vary greatly in size, from almost {{val|1000|u=km}} for the largest down to rocks just 1&nbsp;meter across.<ref group=note>Below 1&nbsp;meter, these are considered to be [[meteoroid]]s.

The vast majority, however, are much smaller and are irregularly shaped; they are thought to be either battered [[planetesimal]]s or fragments of larger bodies.\n\nThe [[dwarf planet]] [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] is by far the largest asteroid, with a diameter of {{cvt|940|km|-1}}. The next largest are [[4 Vesta]] and [[2 Pallas]], both with diameters of just over {{cvt|500|km|-2}}. Vesta is the only main-belt asteroid that can, on occasion, be visible to the naked eye. On some rare occasions, a near-Earth asteroid may briefly become visible without technical aid; see [[99942 Apophis]].\n\nThe mass of all the objects of the [[asteroid belt]], lying between the orbits of [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]], is estimated to be in the range of {{val|2.8|-|3.2|e=21|u=kg}}, about 4% of the mass of the Moon. Of this, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] comprises {{val|.938|e=21|u=kg}}, about a third of the total. Adding in the next three most massive objects, [[4 Vesta|Vesta]] (9%), [[2 Pallas|Pallas]] (7%), and [[10 Hygiea|Hygiea]] (3%), brings this figure up to half, whereas the three most-massive asteroids after that, [[511 Davida]] (1.2%), [[704 Interamnia]] (1.0%), and [[52 Europa]] (0.9%), constitute only another 3%. The number of asteroids increases rapidly as their individual masses decrease.\n\nThe number of asteroids decreases markedly with size. Although this generally follows a [[power law]], there are 'bumps' at {{val|5|u=km}} and {{val|100|u=km}}, where more asteroids than expected from a [[logarithmic distribution]] are found.<ref>Davis (2002) ''Asteroids III'', cited by {{cite web |url=http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/ivezic/Astr598/lecture4.pdf |title=Lecture 4: Moving Objects Detected by SDSS |first=\u017deljko |last=Ivezi\u0107 |date=2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720111753/http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/ivezic/Astr598/lecture4.pdf |archive-date=20 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\"\n! colspan=\"15\" style=\"background:#ddd; text-align:center;\"| Approximate number of asteroids (N) larger than a certain diameter (D)\n|-\n!D\n| 0.1&nbsp;km || 0.3&nbsp;km || 0.5&nbsp;km || 1&nbsp;km || 3&nbsp;km || 5&nbsp;km || 10&nbsp;km || 30&nbsp;km || 50&nbsp;km || 100&nbsp;km || 200&nbsp;km || 300&nbsp;km || 500&nbsp;km || 900&nbsp;km\n|-\n!N\n| {{val|25000000}} || {{val|4000000}} || {{val|2000000}} || {{val|750000}} || {{val|200000}} || {{val|90000}} || {{val|10000}} || {{val|1100}} || 600 || 200 || 30 || 5 || 3 || 1\n|}\n\n====Largest asteroids====\n[[File:The Four Largest Asteroids.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The four largest asteroids: 1 Ceres, 4 Vesta, 2 Pallas and 10 Hygiea]]\n{{See also|Largest asteroids}}\nAlthough their location in the asteroid belt excludes them from planet status, the three largest objects, [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], and [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], are intact [[protoplanet]]s that share many characteristics common to planets, and are atypical compared to the majority of irregularly-shaped asteroids.

The last can only be determined accurately by observing the orbits of moons the asteroid might have. So far, every asteroid with moons has turned out to be a rubble pile, a loose conglomeration of rock and metal that may be half empty space by volume. The investigated asteroids are as large as 280&nbsp;km in diameter, and include [[121 Hermione]] (268\u00d7186\u00d7183&nbsp;km), and [[87 Sylvia]] (384\u00d7262\u00d7232&nbsp;km). Only half a dozen asteroids are [[List of notable asteroids#Largest by diameter|larger than 87 Sylvia]], though none of them have moons; however, some smaller asteroids are thought to be more massive, suggesting they may not have been disrupted, and indeed [[511 Davida]], the same size as Sylvia to within measurement error, is estimated to be two and a half times as massive, though this is highly uncertain. The fact that such large asteroids as Sylvia can be rubble piles, presumably due to disruptive impacts, has important consequences for the formation of the Solar System: Computer simulations of collisions involving solid bodies show them destroying each other as often as merging, but colliding rubble piles are more likely to merge. This means that the cores of the planets could have formed relatively quickly.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Icarus |volume=211 |issue=2 |date=February 2011 |pages=1022\u20131033 |title=Triplicity and physical characteristics of Asteroid (216) Kleopatra |display-authors=3 |first1=P. |last1=Descamps |first2=F. |last2=Marchis |first3=J. |last3=Berthier |first4=J.P. |last4=Emery |first5=G. |last5=Duch\u00eane |first6=I. |last6=de Pater |first7=M.H. |last7=Wong |first8=L. |last8=Lim |first9=H.B. |last9=Hammel |first10=F. |last10=Vachier |first11=P. |last11=Wiggins |first12=J.-P. |last12=Teng-Chuen-Yu |first13=A. |last13=Peyrot |first14=J. |last14=Pollock |first15=M. |last15=Assafin |first16=R. |last16=Vieira-Martinsa |first17=J.I.B. |last17=Camargoi |first18=F. |last18=Braga-Ribas |first19=B. |last19=Macomberk |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2010.11.016|arxiv=1011.5263 |bibcode=2011Icar..211.1022D }}</ref>\n\nOn 7 October 2009, the presence of [[ice|water ice]] was confirmed on the surface of [[24 Themis]] using [[NASA]]'s [[Infrared Telescope Facility]].

A family has also been associated with the plutoid [[dwarf planet]] {{dp|Haumea}}.\n\n==== Quasi-satellites and horseshoe objects ====\nSome asteroids have unusual [[horseshoe orbit]]s that are co-orbital with [[Earth]] or some other planet. Examples are [[3753 Cruithne]] and {{mpl|2002 AA|29}}. The first instance of this type of orbital arrangement was discovered between [[Saturn]]'s moons [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]] and [[Janus (moon)|Janus]].\n\nSometimes these horseshoe objects temporarily become [[quasi-satellite]]s for a few decades or a few hundred years, before returning to their earlier status. Both Earth and [[Venus]] are known to have quasi-satellites.\n\nSuch objects, if associated with Earth or Venus or even hypothetically [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], are a special class of [[Aten asteroid]]s. However, such objects could be associated with outer planets as well.\n\n=== Spectral classification ===\n{{Main|Asteroid spectral types}}\n[[File:433eros.jpg|thumb|This picture of [[433 Eros]] shows the view looking from one end of the asteroid across the gouge on its underside and toward the opposite end. Features as small as {{cvt|35|m|0}} across can be seen.]]\nIn 1975, an asteroid [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] system based on [[color]], [[albedo]], and [[spectral line|spectral shape]] was developed by [[Clark R. Chapman]], [[David Morrison (astrophysicist)|David Morrison]], and [[Ben Zellner]].<ref>{{cite journal | first=C.R. | last=Chapman | title=Surface properties of asteroids: A synthesis of polarimetry, radiometry, and spectrophotometry | journal=Icarus | volume=25 | issue=1 | pages=104\u2013130 | bibcode=1975Icar...25..104C | date=1975 | doi=10.1016/0019-1035(75)90191-8 | last2=Morrison | first2=David | last3=Zellner | first3=Ben}}</ref> These properties are thought to correspond to the composition of the asteroid's surface material. The original classification system had three categories: [[C-type asteroid|C-types]] for dark carbonaceous objects (75% of known asteroids), [[S-type asteroid|S-types]] for stony (silicaceous) objects (17% of known asteroids) and U for those that did not fit into either C or S. This classification has since been expanded to include many other asteroid types. The number of types continues to grow as more asteroids are studied.\n\nThe two most widely used taxonomies now used are the [[Tholen classification]] and [[SMASS classification]]. The former was proposed in 1984 by [[David J. Tholen]], and was based on data collected from an eight-color asteroid survey performed in the 1980s. This resulted in 14 asteroid categories.<ref>{{cite conference | last=Tholen | first=D.J. | title=Asteroid taxonomic classifications | booktitle=Asteroids II; Proceedings of the Conference | pages=1139\u20131150 | publisher=University of Arizona Press | date=1989 | bibcode=1989aste.conf.1139T}}</ref> In 2002, the Small Main-Belt Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey resulted in a modified version of the Tholen taxonomy with 24 different types. Both systems have three broad categories of C, S, and X asteroids, where X consists of mostly metallic asteroids, such as the [[M-type asteroid|M-type]]. There are also several smaller classes.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Bus | first=S.J. | title=Phase II of the Small Main-belt Asteroid Spectroscopy Survey: A feature-based taxonomy | journal=Icarus | date=2002 | volume=158 | issue=1 | page=146 | doi=10.1006/icar.2002.6856 | bibcode=2002Icar..158..146B| url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7332ce5163551b5ad96203e710f02ede89a832d9 }}</ref>\n\nThe proportion of known asteroids falling into the various spectral types does not necessarily reflect the proportion of all asteroids that are of that type; some types are easier to detect than others, biasing the totals.\n\n==== Problems ====\nOriginally, spectral designations were based on inferences of an asteroid's composition.<ref>{{cite book | first=Harry Y. | last=McSween Jr. | date=1999 | title=Meteorites and their Parent Planets | edition=2nd | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0-521-58751-8 }}</ref> However, the correspondence between spectral class and composition is not always very good, and a variety of classifications are in use. This has led to significant confusion.

The formal naming convention uses parentheses around the number (e.g. (433) Eros), but dropping the parentheses is quite common.

He introduced a disk (circle), a traditional symbol for a star, as the generic symbol for an asteroid. The circle was then numbered in order of discovery to indicate a specific asteroid (although he assigned \u2460 to the fifth, [[5 Astraea|Astraea]], while continuing to designate the first four only with their existing iconic symbols). The numbered-circle convention was quickly adopted by astronomers, and the next asteroid to be discovered ([[16 Psyche]], in 1852) was the first to be designated in that way at the time of its discovery. However, Psyche was given an iconic symbol as well, as were a few other asteroids discovered over the next few years (see chart above). [[20 Massalia]] was the first asteroid that was not assigned an iconic symbol, and no iconic symbols were created after the 1855 discovery of [[37 Fides]].<ref group=note>Except for Pluto and, in the astrological community, for a few outer bodies such as [[2060 Chiron]]</ref> That year Astraea's number was increased to \u2464, but the first four asteroids, Ceres to Vesta, were not listed by their numbers until the 1867 edition. The circle was soon abbreviated to a pair of parentheses, which were easier to typeset and sometimes omitted altogether over the next few decades, leading to the modern convention.<ref name=\"hilton\"/>\n\n== Exploration ==\n{{see also|Sample return mission|Asteroid mining|Colonization of the asteroids}}\n[[File:Eros rotation Dec. 3-4 2000.gif|thumb|Eros as seen by visiting spacecraft]]\nUntil the age of [[Spaceflight|space travel]], objects in the asteroid belt were merely pinpricks of light in even the largest telescopes and their shapes and terrain remained a mystery. The best modern ground-based telescopes and the Earth-orbiting [[Hubble Space Telescope]] can resolve a small amount of detail on the surfaces of the largest asteroids, but even these mostly remain little more than fuzzy blobs. Limited information about the shapes and compositions of asteroids can be inferred from their [[light curve]]s (their variation in brightness as they rotate) and their spectral properties, and asteroid sizes can be estimated by timing the lengths of star occulations (when an asteroid passes directly in front of a star). [[Radar]] imaging can yield good information about asteroid shapes and orbital and rotational parameters, especially for near-Earth asteroids. In terms of [[delta-v]] and propellant requirements, NEOs are more easily accessible than the Moon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/m/project/neo/pdf/NEO_feasibility.pdf |title=A Piloted Orion Flight to a Near-Earth Object: A Feasibility Study |display-authors=3 |author1=Rob R.

These images revealed the irregular, potato-like shapes of most asteroids, as did later images from the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] probes of the small moons of the [[gas giant]]s.\n\nThe first true asteroid to be photographed in close-up was [[951 Gaspra]] in 1991, followed in 1993 by [[243 Ida]] and its moon [[Dactyl (asteroid)|Dactyl]], all of which were imaged by the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|''Galileo'' probe]] en route to [[Jupiter]].\n\nThe first dedicated asteroid probe was ''[[NEAR Shoemaker]]'', which photographed [[253 Mathilde]] in 1997, before entering into orbit around [[433 Eros]], finally landing on its surface in 2001.\n\nOther asteroids briefly visited by spacecraft en route to other destinations include [[9969 Braille]] (by ''[[Deep Space 1]]'' in 1999), and [[5535 Annefrank]] (by ''[[Stardust (spacecraft)|Stardust]]'' in 2002).\n\nFrom September to November 2005, the Japanese ''[[Hayabusa (spacecraft)|Hayabusa]]'' probe studied [[25143 Itokawa]] in detail and was plagued with difficulties, but [[Sample return mission|returned samples]] of its surface to Earth on 13 June 2010.\n\nThe European [[Rosetta (spacecraft)|''Rosetta'' probe]] (launched in 2004) flew by [[2867 \u0160teins]] in 2008 and [[21 Lutetia]], the third-largest asteroid visited to date, in 2010.\n\nIn September 2007, [[NASA]] launched the [[Dawn (spacecraft)|''Dawn'' spacecraft]], which orbited [[4 Vesta]] from July 2011 to September 2012, and has been orbiting the dwarf planet [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|1 Ceres]] since 2015. 4 Vesta is the second-largest asteroid

The city is close to winter skiing centres in the north and to seaside resorts on the [[Adriatic Sea]].\n\n[[Podgorica Municipality]] covers 10.4% of Montenegro's territory and is home to 29.9% of the country's population. It is the nation's administrative centre and its economic, cultural, and educational focus.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Podgorica'' means \"[area] below Gorica\". Gorica, meaning \"little hill\", is the name of one of the [[cypress]]-covered [[hillock]]s that overlook the city centre.\n\nSome three kilometres ({{convert|3|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) north-west of Podgorica lie the ruins of the Roman-era town of [[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], from which the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] hailed. In later centuries, Romans \"corrected\" the name to {{lang|la|Dioclea}}, guessing wrongly that an ''i'' had been lost in vulgar speech. {{lang|zls|Duklja}} is the later [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] version of that word.\n\nAt its foundation (some time before the 11th century), the town was called '''Birziminium'''. In the [[Middle Ages]], it was known as '''Ribnica''' (Montenegrin Cyrillic: {{lang|sh|\u0420\u0438\u0431\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430}} {{IPA-sh|r\u00eebnitsa|}}). The name Podgorica was used from 1326. From 1946 to 1992, the city was [[List of places named after Tito|named]] '''Titograd''' in honour of [[Josip Broz Tito]], the former [[President of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|President of Yugoslavia]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\n[[File:Doclea Roman city Podgorica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], Roman town, the seat of the Late Roman province of [[Praevalitana]].]]\n[[File:Ancient city Doclea - ruins 06.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Archeological remains of the Roman period in Doclea.]]\nPodgorica is at the [[Crossroads (culture)|crossroads]] of several historically important routes, near the rivers [[Zeta River|Zeta]], [[Mora\u010da]], [[Cijevna]], [[Ribnica (river)|Ribnica]], [[Sitnica (Mora\u010da)|Sitnica]] and [[Mareza]] in the valley of [[Lake Skadar]] and near the Adriatic Sea, in fertile lowlands with favourable climate. The earliest human settlements were in prehistory: the oldest physical remains are from the late [[Stone Age]].\n\nIn the [[Iron Age]], the area between the [[Zeta plain|Zeta]] and [[Bjelopavli\u0107i plain|Bjelopavli\u0107i valleys]] was occupied by two Illyrian tribes, the [[Labeates]] and the [[Docleatae]]. The population of the town of Doclea was 8,000\u201310,000, in which all core urban issues were resolved. The high population density (in an area of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} radius) was made possible by the geographical position, favourable climate and economic conditions and by the defensive positions that were of great importance at that time.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nFrom the 5th century AD, with the arrival of the first [[Sclaveni|Slavic]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] tribes and the beginning of the break-up of the [[Roman Empire]], the area bore witness to many noteworthy events. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} With time, the fortifications ceased their function and new towns were built; a new settlement probably named after the Ribnica river, on whose banks it was built, Ribnica, was established. It was first mentioned during the reign of the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]], as part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian kingdom]]. The importance of Ribnica was its position as crossroads in communications with the west. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe name Podgorica was first mentioned in 1326 in a court document of the [[Kotor]] archives. The city was economically strong: trade routes between the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and Serbia, well developed at that time, were maintained via the road that led to Podgorica through [[Trebinje]] and [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]]. As a busy crossroad, Podgorica was a vibrant regional centre of trade and communication. This boosted its development, economic power, military strength and strategic importance. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:28iulsah.jpg|thumb|View of [[Depedogen|Ribnica fortress and Old bridge]], Catholic Church (right), Debbaglar Bridge, government mansion and the Mirko Varosh Hotel (far left), before 1901.]]\n[[File:Sahat-kula in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Clock Tower (Podgorica)|City Clock Tower]].]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] captured Podgorica in 1474.

This part of the city is today traditionally regarded as city centre, and is called ''Nova Varo\u0161'' (''New town'')\n\nDuring World War II, Podgorica was almost razed to the ground, being [[Bombing of Podgorica in World War II|bombed over 70 times]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled SFRY. Mass residential blocks were erected, with basic design typical of [[Eastern bloc]] countries. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} All that part of the city on the right bank of the [[Mora\u010da River]] was built this way.\n\nThe main contemporary traffic arteries were laid out during this period, which extended the orthogonal street layout of city center, to the south and west. Residential and infrastructural developments in the SFRY era have mostly shaped the layout of today's Podgorica, and accommodated the unprecedented population growth that followed World War II. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n<gallery>\nSaborniHram.JPG|[[Roman Square (Podgorica)|Roman Square]] and [[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of Podgorica]].\nMost_Bla\u017ea_Jovanovi\u0107a.jpg|[[Bla\u017eo Jovanovi\u0107 Bridge]] over the Mora\u010da.\nPodgorica_EKIP_and_Prva_TV_IMG_1286_82_Bulevar_D%C5%BEord%C5%BEa_Va%C5%A1ingtona.JPG|Office building at George Washington Street\nBlok_5_i_6.jpg|Highrise housing in Podgorica.\nDelta City - panoramio.jpg|[[Delta Holding|Delta Shopping Mall]].\nBulevar Svetog Petra Cetinjskog, 2019.jpg|[[Peter I of Montenegro|St Peter of Cetinje]] Boulevard\nAerodromPodgorica.jpg|[[Podgorica Airport]]\nMora\u010da Sports Center.jpg|[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]]\n</gallery>\n\nA major advance in Podgorica architecture began in the late 1990s and, since then, the face of the city has changed rapidly. Residential and business construction are proceeding rapidly, incorporating contemporary glass-and-steel architectural trends. In an effort to create a recognizable and modern state capital, city officials are routing significant investments in city's public spaces. Thus, the city has gained entirely new squares, parks and monuments. New landmarks include the ''Hristovog Vaskrsenja'' [[Orthodox temple (church)|orthodox temple]] and the [[Millennium Bridge, Podgorica|Millennium Bridge]], the main feature of the Podgorica skyline. \n{{wide image|Dva_mosta_Podgorica_banner.jpg|1400px|A panoramic view of the [[Moscow bridge]] (right) and the [[Millennium Bridge (Montenegro)|Millennium Bridge]] (left).

The Montenegrin National Theatre is the most significant theatre not only in Podgorica but in all of Montenegro. Podgorica is also host to the City Theatre (''Gradsko pozori\u0161te''), which includes the Children's Theatre and the Puppet Theatre. Although not as rich in museums and galleries as the historic royal capital [[Cetinje]], there are several noteworthy museums:\n\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(9).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] interior.]]\n[[File:Royal Garden in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Former residence of King Nikola I Petrovi\u0107, today an art gallery.]]\n[[File:Crnogorsko Narodno Pozori\u0161te.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Montenegrin National Theatre]]]]\n[[File:Podgorica, museo nazionale, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|left|200px|{{nowrap|National Museum of Montenegro}}]]\n* The Podgorica City Museum (''Muzej grada Podgorice'') preserves Podgorica's rich heritage. Founded in 1950, it has four categories: archaeological, ethnographic, historical and cultural-historical. It houses artefacts which date back to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Illyria]]n eras. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n* The Archaeological Research Centre (''Centar za arheolo\u0161ka istra\u017eivanja'') was founded in 1961. Its mission is to gather, classify, restore and display archaeological sites.\n* The [[Marko Miljanov]] Museum (''Muzej Marka Miljanova'') in [[Medun]] shows life in 19th century Montenegro. \n* The Natural History Museum (''Prirodnja\u010dki muzej'') displays specimens of Montenegrin flora and fauna. This museum has no exhibition space of its own, despite many proposals and initiatives to build one. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\nThere is a notable art gallery in the ''Dvorac'' [[House of Petrovi\u0107|''Petrovi\u0107a'']] ([[Podgorica Royal Palace|Petrovi\u0107 Castle]]) complex in Podgorica's largest public park. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nicholas]]'s castle, ''Perjani\u010dki Dom'' (House of the Honour Guard), castle chapel and surrounding buildings were converted to an art gallery in 1984. Since 1995, it has been part of the Modern Arts Centre (''Centar savremenih umjetnosti'') and houses approximately 1,500 works of art. The historic Cinema of Culture (''Kino Kultura''), which was founded in 1949, was closed in November 2008 due to continuous financial losses it generated. It was the only cinema in the city for 6 decades. The building of the former cinema will be converted to host the Podgorica City Theatre. Shortly after its closure, a [[Ster-Kinekor]] (later acquired by [[Cineplexx Cinemas|Cineplexx]]) 6-screen [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] cinema opened at [[Delta City]] shopping mall.\n\nA significant cultural institution of over fifty years' standing is the Budo Tomovi\u0107 Cultural-Informational Centre (''KIC Budo Tomovi\u0107''). It is a public institution which organizes various artistic events, including Podgorica Cultural Summer (''Podgori\u010dko Kulturno Ljeto''), FIAT \u2013 International Alternative Theatre Festival (''Festival Internacionalnog Alternativnog Teatra''), DEUS \u2013 December Arts Scene (''Decembarska Umjetni\u010dka Scena'').\n\n==Media==\nPodgorica is the media hub of Montenegro. It is home to the headquarters of the state-owned [[public television]] broadcaster [[RTCG]]. Commercial broadcasters in Podgorica include [[RTV A1]], [[TV Vijesti]], [[Nova M]] and [[Prva TV]]. It was announced that the city's local television will be launched soon.<ref>[http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html Mugo\u0161a: Podgorica dobija svoju televiziju] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723040909/http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html |date=23 July 2011 }}</ref> Their programmes can be received in much of Montenegro.\n\nAll Montenegro's daily newspapers (oldest Montenegrin daily newspaper ''[[Pobjeda]]'', ''[[Vijesti]]'', ''[[Dnevne Novine]]'' and ''[[Dan (newspaper)|Dan]]'') are published in Podgorica, as the weekly magazines ''[[The Monitor (Montenegro)|Monitor]]'' and ''[[Magazin BIT]]''.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(34).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]].]]\nThe most popular sports by far are [[association football|football]] and [[basketball]]. Basketball became especially popular with the success in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of [[KK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|KK Budu\u0107nost]], both in [[ABA League|Regional]] and European competitions.\n\nFootball in Podgorica has a long tradition associated with [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|Budu\u0107nost]]. World-famous players [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]] and [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]] were born in Podgorica and made their debut in that team. The club [[FK Zeta]] from the Podgorica suburb of [[Golubovci]] has also reached the former first league of Serbia and Montenegro. These clubs, along with [[FK Sutjeska Nik\u0161i\u0107|Sutjeska]] from Nik\u0161i\u0107, usually compete with each other for leading position in the [[First League of Montenegro]].\nOther clubs from Podgorica and its surroundings play in the Montenegrin First League e.g. [[OFK Titograd]] & [[FK Kom|Kom]]. One of the most popular clubs from the suburbs is [[FK Ribnica]] from [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik]], [[FK Zabjelo]] from [[Zabjelo]] and [[OFK Mladost Lje\u0161kopolje|OFK Mladost 1970]] from ''Donja Gorica''.\n\nThe volleyball team [[OK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|OK Budu\u0107nost]] and the women's handball team [[\u017dRK Budu\u0107nost T-Mobile]] have had significant success in European competition. [[Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] is the most important sports club in Podgorica. Its name means ''Future''.\n\n[[Chess]] is another popular sport and some famous global chess players, like [[Slavko Dedi\u0107]], are born in Podgorica.\n\nSporting events like the annual [[Podgorica Marathon]] and the ''Mora\u010da River'' jumps attract international competitors.\nPodgorica was the host of [[2009 FINA Men's Water Polo World League]].\n\n===Venues===\n[[File:PodgoricaCityStadium2017.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Podgorica City Stadium]]]]\nPodgorica has a number of sporting venues; some are under reconstruction and expansion. The main ones are:\n*[[Podgorica City Stadium]]. It has a capacity of 11,264 and it is the home of [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] and the [[Montenegro national football team]]. It is currently the only venue in Montenegro that complies with [[FIFA]] standards for international football matches.\n*[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]], a multi functional indoor sport facility. It has a capacity of 6 000 seats. It hosted one group of [[EuroBasket 2005]], while other games were played in [[Belgrade Arena|Belgrade]], [[Millennium Centar|Vr\u0161ac]], and [[Spens Sports Center|Novi Sad]].\n\nAlmost every football club in Podgorica has its own stadium, although these are often only fields with small stands or no stands at all.\nOther notable venues are the [[Stadion malih sportova]] under Gorica hill and the [[sport shooting]] range under Ljubovi\u0107 hill. There are many other sports facilities around the city, most notably [[indoor soccer]] fields.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Podgorica_National_bank_of_Montenegro.JPG|thumb|left|Central Bank of Montenegro.]]\n[[File:Podgorica-Tuzi plantaze wineyard IMG 1318 Cijevna river.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of the [[Planta\u017ee]] wineyard, this wine field is the largest single one in Europe.]]\nPodgorica is not only the administrative centre of Montenegro, but also its main economic engine. Most of Montenegro's industrial, financial, and commercial base is in Podgorica. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nBefore World War I, most of Podgorica's economy was in trade and small-scale manufacture, which was an economic model established during the long rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} After World War II, Podgorica became Montenegro's capital and a focus of the rapid urbanization and industrialization of the SFRY era. Industries such as aluminium and tobacco processing, [[textile industry|textiles]], engineering, vehicle production, and wine production were established in and around the city. In 1981, Podgorica's GDP per capita was 87% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book | title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju | year=1984 | edition=3rd | publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber | location=Zagreb | language=Croatian | editor1-first=Radovan | editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107 | editor2-first=Ivan | editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|dissolution of Yugoslavia]], [[Yugoslav wars]], and the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 757|UN-imposed sanctions]] left Podgorica's industries without traditional markets, suppliers, and available funds. This, combined with typical [[Transition economy|transition]] pressures, led to a decline of the industrial base, where many industries collapsed leaving thousands of citizens unemployed. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} However, some of the industries, including [[Podgorica Aluminium Plant|Podgorica aluminium smelter]] and [[Planta\u017ee]], managed to survive the turmoil of the 1990s, and are still major contributors to Montenegrin export and industrial output to this day.\n\nAs Montenegro began its push for independence from Serbia in the late 1990s, Podgorica greatly benefited from increased concentration of government and service sectors. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In addition to almost the entire country's government, Podgorica is home to the [[Montenegro Stock Exchange]] and other major Montenegrin financial institutions, along with telecommunications carriers, media outlets, [[Montenegro Airlines|Montenegrin flag carrier airline]], and other significant institutions and companies.\n\nThe large presence of government and service sectors spared the economy of Podgorica from prolonged stagnation in the [[Great Recession|late 2000s recession]], which hit Montenegro hard. Although, in mid-2014, some 30% of Montenegro's citizens lived in Podgorica, the municipality accounted for 44% of the country's employed. Out of the entire mass of paid nwt salaries in Montenegro in that year, some 47% was paid in Podgorica. The average monthly net salary in May, 2014 was \u20ac509 in Podgorica municipality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstat.org/userfiles/file/publikacije/2014/6/zaposlenost%20i%20zarade.pdf |title=Monthly Statistical Review, no. 6/2014 |format=pdf|publisher=Monstat |date=2014-05-05 |accessdate=2014-10-13}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Capital Plaza of Podgorica Trg Svetog Petra Cetinjskog IMG 1291 Ulitsa Dr Ljubomira Ra\u0161ovi\u0107a.jpg|The Capital Plaza\nFile:Telenor.JPG|Telenor Center\nFile:DeltaPG.JPG|Delta City\nFile:PC Kru\u0161evac.JPG|TC Kru\u0161evac\n</gallery>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Further|Demographics of Podgorica}}\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|1948|14369 |1953|19868 |1961|35054 |1971|61727 |1981|96074 |1991|117875 |2003|136473 |2011|150977 |2018|199715\n|\n}}\n\nAlthough medium-sized by European standards, Podgorica is by far the largest city in [[Montenegro]]: almost one third of Montenegrin citizens live there.

The average age of the population is 35.7. [[Serbian language|Serbian]] is the most spoken language, with 42.4% of Podgorica citizens declaring it as their first language. It is followed closely by [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], at 41.17%. Other significant languages spoken in Podgorica are [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (5.53%) and [[Romani language|Romani]] (1.81%).\n\nThe majority of Podgorica citizens are [[Orthodox Christians]] (78.27%), while there are significant minorities of [[Muslims]] (11.23%) and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] (4.27%).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"100\" | Nationality (2011 census)\n! width=\"80\" | Number\n! width=\"80\" | Percentage\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 106,642 || 57.35%\n|-\n| [[Serbs]] || 43,248 || 23.26%\n|-\n| [[Albanians]] || 9,538 || 5.13%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 4,122 || 2.22%\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks]] || 3,687\t || 1,98%\n|-\n| [[Romani people|Romani]] || 3,988 || 2.14%\n|-\n| others || 5,820 || 3.13%\n|-\n| undeclared || 8,892 || 4.78%'''\n|}\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Podgorica, cattedrale della resurrezione di cristo, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of Podgorica]].]]\n[[File:Manastir Dajbabe - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Dajbabe Monastery]].]]\n\nPodgorica is home to three main religious groups: [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] and [[Catholicism|Catholic Christians]].\n\nOrthodox Christian population mostly originates from the local [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] and [[Serb]] population, which accepted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Middle Ages after a major split during [[East\u2013West Schism|The Great Schism]]. They represent the major religious group. There are various Eastern Orthodox churches in the City such as St. George Church which originates from the 13th century, or [[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ (Podgorica)|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] which is the largest church in the city to have been recently erected.\nThe [[Muslims|Muslim]] population mostly originates from local [[Bosniaks]], as well as [[Albanians]].\n\nThere are several mosques in Podgorica and [[Tuzi]]. Catholic population mainly consists of local Albanian minority. The main religious site for the Catholic population located in the [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik neighbourhood]] is the [[Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus (Podgorica)|Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus]] constructed in 1966, in [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style which makes this object unique.

The city assembly has 59 members, elected directly for four-year terms. The mayor used to be directly elected for five-year term, but since the new law was introduced in Montenegrin municipalities mayors will be elected by the city assembly and will have to maintain its support during his term. Separate elections are held for the local sub-division of [[Golubovci]] since it is part of their administrative autonomy inside Podgorica municipality. Constant questions are raised by various politicians over gaining separate municipality status for [[Golubovci]]. In 2018, [[Tuzi Municipality|Tuzi]] became its own municipality after a vote on the Montenegrin Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdm.me/english/tuzi-will-become-independent-municipality/|title=Tuzi became its own Municipality.}}</ref>\n\nOn local elections held on 25 May 2014, the [[Democratic Party of Socialists]] won 29 seats in the municipal assembly, one short of 30 needed to form a majority.

After lengthy negotiations, SDP dissolved coalition with Pozitivna, and made arrangement on forming majority with DPS, similar to one they have in national government. While SDP is longtime partner of DPS at national level, it has been in opposition in Podgorica municipal assembly in 2010-2014 period. \nSince October 2014, position of the mayor is held by [[Democratic Party of Socialists|DPS]] official, Slavoljub Stijepovi\u0107, replacing Podgorica mayor od 14 years, [[Miomir Mugo\u0161a]].\n\n===City Assembly===\n{{see|Podgorica City Assembly election, 2018}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n!colspan=2|Party/Coalition\n!Seats\n!Local government\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #F6931D\" |\n| [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] \n| {{Composition bar|32|60|hex=#F6931D}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| [[Democratic Montenegro]] \n| {{Composition bar|12|60|hex=#FF0000}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkred\" |\n| [[United Reform Action]]\n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkred}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkblue\" |\n| [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] \n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: cornflowerblue\" |\n| [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|Socialist People's Party]]\n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=cornflowerblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #fd00ff\" |\n| [[Social Democrats of Montenegro|Social Democrats]] \n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=#fd00ff}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: blue\" |\n| [[Albanian Alternative]]\n| {{Composition bar|1|60|hex=blue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|}\n\n===Local subdivisions===\n{{Main|Subdivisions of Podgorica}}\n\nThe municipality of Podgorica consists of ''Podgorica City Proper'' and one subdivision (called ''[[city municipality]],'' \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435, ''gradske op\u0161tine''), which is [[Golubovci]].\n\nThe entire municipality of Podgorica is further divided into 57 ''[[local community|local communities]]'' (\u043c\u0458\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0458\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435, ''mjesne zajednice''), bodies in which the citizens participate in decisions on matters of relevance to the local community.\n\n==Education==\n\nMost of Montenegro's higher education establishments are in Podgorica. It is home to the [[University of Montenegro]], the country's most significant such institution. The following faculties are in Podgorica:\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Economics|Faculty of Economics]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Electrical Engineering|Faculty of Electrical Engineering]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Metallurgy and Technology|Faculty of Metallurgy and Technology]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Political Sciences|Faculty of Political Sciences]]\n* Faculty of [[Civil Engineering]]\n{{col-2}}\n* Faculty of [[Mechanical Engineering]]\n* Faculty of [[Natural Sciences]] and [[Mathematics]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Pharmacy|Faculty of Pharmacy]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Architecture|Faculty of Architecture]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Biotechnology|Faculty of Biotechnology]]\n{{col-2}}\n{{col-end}}\n\nThe university's scientific research institutes are in the city:\n* Institute of Foreign Languages\n* Institute of Biotechnology\n* Institute of History\n\nThe [[Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts]] is in Podgorica, as is the [[Doclean Academy of Sciences and Arts|DANU]] cultural organization.\n\nThe [[Mediterranean University]] was founded 2006 as first private university in Montenegro. In the meantime, the number of private institutions for higher education has increased, like [[University of Donja Gorica|UDG - University of Donja Gorica]]. The municipality of Podgorica has 34 elementary schools and 10 secondary schools, including one [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. The first secondary school established in Podgorica is [[Gymnasium \"Slobodan \u0160kerovi\u0107\"]]. The rebuilt economic high school offers new features and higher quality education. The Radosav Ljumovi\u0107 National Library is considered the most comprehensive in Montenegro.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Public transport===\n[[File:PGWelcome.jpg|thumb|left|Northern entrance to Podgorica ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]).]]\n[[File:Millennium Bridge in Podgorica, Montenegro 02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Millennium Bridge (Montenegro)|Millennium Bridge]].]]\nPublic transport in Podgorica consists of 11 urban and 16 suburban bus lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.podgorica.me/%C5%BDivotuPodgorici/Saobra%C4%87aj/tabid/129/language/sr-Latn-CS/Default.aspx |title=Saobra\u0107aj |publisher=Podgorica.me |accessdate=2013-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325043642/http://www.podgorica.me/%C5%BDivotuPodgorici/Saobra%C4%87aj/tabid/129/language/sr-Latn-CS/Default.aspx |archivedate=25 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The city-owned ''AD Gradski saobra\u0107aj'' public transport company used to be the sole bus operator until the 1990s, when private carriers were introduced. The company went bankrupt in 2001, and buses were since operated solely by private carriers.\n\nPublic transport faces competition from very popular dispatched taxi services. De-regulation and stiff competition has made taxi services very affordable. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Over 20 taxi companies are operating in Podgorica with close to 800 vehicles in service. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Usually, taxi companies provide a high level of service, with relatively new and uniform car fleets and [[GPS]]-tracked vehicles.\n\n===Roads===\n[[File:Sozina-Tunnel.png|thumb|350px|[[Sozina Tunnel]] shortens the journey from Podgorica to Montenegro's main port [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], by some 25 km.]]\nPodgorica's location in central Montenegro makes it a natural hub for rail and road transport. Roads in Montenegro (especially those connecting Podgorica to northern Montenegro and [[Serbia]]) are usually inferior to modern European roads. Both major Montenegrin motorway projects, [[A-1 motorway (Montenegro)|Bar-Boljare motorway]] and [[Adriatic\u2013Ionian motorway#Montenegro|Nudo\u2013Bo\u017eaj motorway]], will pass near Podgorica. The newly built [[Sozina tunnel]] (4.2&nbsp;km) shortened the journey from Podgorica to [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] (Montenegro's main seaport) to under 30 minutes. Also a new road bypass has been constructed in 2011, to remove transport routes from north to south of the country, out of the city centre. A south-western bypass has also been planned {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, with same goal of moving heavy transport out of the city core. Podgorica is also characteristic for its extensive network of multi-lane boulevards which make inner city transport quick and effective. Traffic over the [[Mora\u010da River]] also goes fluently since river banks are very well connected with 6 vehicular and 3 pedestrian bridges.\n\nThe current main transit connections of Podgorica are:\n* north ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]), towards [[Belgrade]] and on to Central Europe\n* west ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and on to Western Europe\n* south ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]) towards the [[Adriatic coast]]\n* east ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Albania]]\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:01.10.13 Podgorica 6111.101 & 461.040 (10101220063).jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Rail Station]].]]\nPodgorica is a hub of the X-shaped [[Railways of Montenegro|Montenegrin rail network]]. The [[Belgrade\u2013Bar railway|Belgrade\u2013Bar]] line converges with the [[Nik\u0161i\u0107-Podgorica railway|line to Nik\u0161i\u0107]] and [[Podgorica\u2013Shkod\u00ebr railway|line to Shkod\u00ebr]] at the [[Podgorica Rail Station]]. The station itself is located {{convert|1.5|km|2|abbr=on}} to the southeast of the main city square. Podgorica's main railway link (for both passenger and freight traffic) is Belgrade\u2013Bar.  The link to [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]] was recently under reconstruction ([[Railway electrification system|electrification]]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montenegroberza.com/code/navigate.asp?Id=718|title=U \u017deljeznicu ula\u017eu 52 miliona eura}}</ref> afterwards, passenger service started in October 2012. The rail link to [[Shkod\u00ebr]] is currently used as freight-only.\n\n===Air===\n[[File:Podgorica airport.jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Airport]] near [[Golubovci]].]]\n[[Podgorica Airport]] is located in [[Zeta Plain]], {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Podgorica City centre, and is Montenegro's main international airport. The airport is locally known as Golubovci Airport (\u0410\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0446\u0438 / Aerodrom Golubovci), as it is located within the administrative boundaries of the town of [[Golubovci]]. The IATA code of the airport is still TGD because Podgorica was named Titograd, during which time the airport opened. It is the main hub for [[Montenegro Airlines]] and [[Di Air]].\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Montenegro}}\n\n===Twin towns and sister cities===\nPodgorica is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n*{{flagicon|NMK}} [[Skopje]], North Macedonia<ref name=\"Skopje twinnings\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skopje.gov.mk/EN/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=0&tabid=69|title=Official portal of City of Skopje \u2013 Skopje Sister Cities|publisher=2006\u20132009 [http://www.skopje.gov.mk/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=0&tabid=1 City of Skopje]|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>\n\n===Partner cities===\n*{{flagicon|ARM}} [[Yerevan]], Armenia<ref name=\"Yerevan partnerships\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yerevan.am/3-233-233.html|title=Yerevan - Partner Cities|accessdate=2013-11-04|work=Yerevan Municipality Official Website|publisher=\u00a9 2005\u20142013 www.yerevan.am|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105220142/http://www.yerevan.am/3-233-233.html|archivedate=5 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nBelow are some of the most notable people who were either born, or spent most of their lives in Podgorica:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Bo\u017eidar Vukovi\u0107]], one of the first printers among the [[South Slavs]]\n*[[Bla\u017eo Jovanovi\u0107]], first [[President of Montenegro|President of the People's Assembly]] of [[Montenegro]]\n*[[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]], football player, [[1990\u201391 European Cup|European Cup]] champion\n*[[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]], football player\n*[[Stevan Joveti\u0107]], football player\n*[[Du\u0161ko Vujo\u0161evi\u0107]], Montenegrin basketball coach\n*[[Marko Miljanov]], general, clan chief and writer\n*[[Vojo Stani\u0107]], sculptor and painter\n*[[Risto Stijovi\u0107]], sculptor and painter\n*[[Borislav Peki\u0107]], novelist\n*[[Nikola Radovi\u0107]], football player, Olympic silver medalist\n*[[Zoran Filipovi\u0107]] football player and coach\n*[[Du\u0161ko Radinovi\u0107]], football player\n*[[Simon Vuk\u010devi\u0107]], football player\n*[[Refik \u0160abanad\u017eovi\u0107]] football player\n*[[Dejan Zlati\u010danin]], boxer, lightweight [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] champion\n*[[Dejan Radonji\u0107]], basketball player and coach\n*[[Nikola Bulatovi\u0107]], basketball player\n*[[Ljiljana Mugo\u0161a]], handball player, Olympic champion\n*[[Svetlana Mugo\u0161a-Anti\u0107]], handball player, Olympic champion\n*[[Nikola Miroti\u0107]], Spanish basketball player, Olympic bronze medalist and European champion\n*[[Ivan Strugar]], kick-boxer\n*[[An\u0111ela Bulatovi\u0107]], handball player, Olympic silver medalist and European champion\n*[[Jovanka Radi\u010devi\u0107]], handball player, Olympic silver medalist and European champion\n*[[Knez (singer)|Nenad Kne\u017eevi\u0107 \"Knez\"]], pop singer\n*[[Sergej \u0106etkovi\u0107]], pop singer\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Honorary citizens===\n\n*{{flagicon|CRO}} [[Stjepan Mesi\u0107]], former [[List of Presidents of Croatia|President of Croatia]].\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Podgorica City Hall Independence Day Montenegro.jpg|Podgorica City Hall on Independence Day\nFile:Podgorica Trg Republike.JPG|[[Independence Square (Podgorica)|Independence Square]]\nFile:Vaso Brajovic.jpg|Monument to General [[Vaso Brajovi\u0107]]\nFile:Marko Miljanov - spomenik u Podgorici.jpg|Monument to [[Marko Miljanov]]\nFile:Josip Broz Tito Podgorica.jpg|Monument to [[Josip Broz Tito]]\nFile:Moskovska.jpg|Moscow street, Preko Mora\u010de neighbourhood\nFile:Pet udovica - panoramio.jpg|Momi\u0161i\u0107i neighbourhood\nFile:Natural History Museum of Montenegro, Sahat Kula, 2019.jpg|Natural History Museum and Clock Tower in the Old Town\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book | ref = harv | url = http://www.cpi.hr/download/links/7292.pdf | chapter = Antibirokratska revolucija 1987-1989. godine | language = Serbian | first = Olivera | last = Milosavljevi\u0107 | format = PDF | title = Dijalog povjesni\u010dara - istori\u010dara 8, Zadar | editor-last1 = Graovac | editor-first1 = Igor | editor-last2 = Fleck | editor-first2 = Hans-Georg | publisher = Political Science Research Centre Ltd.

Gorica, meaning \"little hill\", is the name of one of the [[cypress]]-covered [[hillock]]s that overlook the city centre.\n\nSome three kilometres ({{convert|3|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) north-west of Podgorica lie the ruins of the Roman-era town of [[Doclea (town)|Doclea]], from which the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] hailed. In later centuries, Romans \"corrected\" the name to {{lang|la|Dioclea}}, guessing wrongly that an ''i'' had been lost in vulgar speech. {{lang|zls|Duklja}} is the later [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] version of that word.\n\nAt its foundation (some time before the 11th century), the town was called '''Birziminium'''. In the [[Middle Ages]], it was known as '''Ribnica''' (Montenegrin Cyrillic: {{lang|sh|\u0420\u0438\u0431\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430}} {{IPA-sh|r\u00eebnitsa|}}). The name Podgorica was used from 1326.

The earliest human settlements were in prehistory: the oldest physical remains are from the late [[Stone Age]].\n\nIn the [[Iron Age]], the area between the [[Zeta plain|Zeta]] and [[Bjelopavli\u0107i plain|Bjelopavli\u0107i valleys]] was occupied by two Illyrian tribes, the [[Labeates]] and the [[Docleatae]]. The population of the town of Doclea was 8,000\u201310,000, in which all core urban issues were resolved. The high population density (in an area of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}} radius) was made possible by the geographical position, favourable climate and economic conditions and by the defensive positions that were of great importance at that time.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nFrom the 5th century AD, with the arrival of the first [[Sclaveni|Slavic]] and [[Pannonian Avars|Avar]] tribes and the beginning of the break-up of the [[Roman Empire]], the area bore witness to many noteworthy events. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} With time, the fortifications ceased their function and new towns were built; a new settlement probably named after the Ribnica river, on whose banks it was built, Ribnica, was established. It was first mentioned during the reign of the [[Nemanji\u0107 dynasty]], as part of the [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbian kingdom]]. The importance of Ribnica was its position as crossroads in communications with the west. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe name Podgorica was first mentioned in 1326 in a court document of the [[Kotor]] archives. The city was economically strong: trade routes between the [[Republic of Ragusa]] and Serbia, well developed at that time, were maintained via the road that led to Podgorica through [[Trebinje]] and [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]]. As a busy crossroad, Podgorica was a vibrant regional centre of trade and communication. This boosted its development, economic power, military strength and strategic importance. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\n[[File:28iulsah.jpg|thumb|View of [[Depedogen|Ribnica fortress and Old bridge]], Catholic Church (right), Debbaglar Bridge, government mansion and the Mirko Varosh Hotel (far left), before 1901.]]\n[[File:Sahat-kula in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[Clock Tower (Podgorica)|City Clock Tower]].]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire]] captured Podgorica in 1474.

An occasional strong northerly wind influences the climate in the winter, with a [[wind chill]] effect lowering the perceived temperature by a few degrees. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nThe all-time maximum snowfall record was beaten on 11 February 2012, when {{convert|58|cm|0|abbr=on}} of snowfall were measured.

This part of the city is today traditionally regarded as city centre, and is called ''Nova Varo\u0161'' (''New town'')\n\nDuring World War II, Podgorica was almost razed to the ground, being [[Bombing of Podgorica in World War II|bombed over 70 times]]. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} After liberation, rebuilding began as in other cities of the communist-ruled SFRY. Mass residential blocks were erected, with basic design typical of [[Eastern bloc]] countries. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} All that part of the city on the right bank of the [[Mora\u010da River]] was built this way.\n\nThe main contemporary traffic arteries were laid out during this period, which extended the orthogonal street layout of city center, to the south and west. Residential and infrastructural developments in the SFRY era have mostly shaped the layout of today's Podgorica, and accommodated the unprecedented population growth that followed World War II. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n<gallery>\nSaborniHram.JPG|[[Roman Square (Podgorica)|Roman Square]] and [[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of Podgorica]].\nMost_Bla\u017ea_Jovanovi\u0107a.jpg|[[Bla\u017eo Jovanovi\u0107 Bridge]] over the Mora\u010da.\nPodgorica_EKIP_and_Prva_TV_IMG_1286_82_Bulevar_D%C5%BEord%C5%BEa_Va%C5%A1ingtona.JPG|Office building at George Washington Street\nBlok_5_i_6.jpg|Highrise housing in Podgorica.\nDelta City - panoramio.jpg|[[Delta Holding|Delta Shopping Mall]].\nBulevar Svetog Petra Cetinjskog, 2019.jpg|[[Peter I of Montenegro|St Peter of Cetinje]] Boulevard\nAerodromPodgorica.jpg|[[Podgorica Airport]]\nMora\u010da Sports Center.jpg|[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]]\n</gallery>\n\nA major advance in Podgorica architecture began in the late 1990s and, since then, the face of the city has changed rapidly. Residential and business construction are proceeding rapidly, incorporating contemporary glass-and-steel architectural trends. In an effort to create a recognizable and modern state capital, city officials are routing significant investments in city's public spaces. Thus, the city has gained entirely new squares, parks and monuments. New landmarks include the ''Hristovog Vaskrsenja'' [[Orthodox temple (church)|orthodox temple]] and the [[Millennium Bridge, Podgorica|Millennium Bridge]], the main feature of the Podgorica skyline. \n{{wide image|Dva_mosta_Podgorica_banner.jpg|1400px|A panoramic view of the [[Moscow bridge]] (right) and the [[Millennium Bridge (Montenegro)|Millennium Bridge]] (left).

The Montenegrin National Theatre is the most significant theatre not only in Podgorica but in all of Montenegro. Podgorica is also host to the City Theatre (''Gradsko pozori\u0161te''), which includes the Children's Theatre and the Puppet Theatre. Although not as rich in museums and galleries as the historic royal capital [[Cetinje]], there are several noteworthy museums:\n\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(9).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] interior.]]\n[[File:Royal Garden in Podgorica.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Former residence of King Nikola I Petrovi\u0107, today an art gallery.]]\n[[File:Crnogorsko Narodno Pozori\u0161te.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Montenegrin National Theatre]]]]\n[[File:Podgorica, museo nazionale, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|left|200px|{{nowrap|National Museum of Montenegro}}]]\n* The Podgorica City Museum (''Muzej grada Podgorice'') preserves Podgorica's rich heritage. Founded in 1950, it has four categories: archaeological, ethnographic, historical and cultural-historical. It houses artefacts which date back to the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Illyria]]n eras. {{citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n* The Archaeological Research Centre (''Centar za arheolo\u0161ka istra\u017eivanja'') was founded in 1961. Its mission is to gather, classify, restore and display archaeological sites.\n* The [[Marko Miljanov]] Museum (''Muzej Marka Miljanova'') in [[Medun]] shows life in 19th century Montenegro. \n* The Natural History Museum (''Prirodnja\u010dki muzej'') displays specimens of Montenegrin flora and fauna. This museum has no exhibition space of its own, despite many proposals and initiatives to build one. {{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}\nThere is a notable art gallery in the ''Dvorac'' [[House of Petrovi\u0107|''Petrovi\u0107a'']] ([[Podgorica Royal Palace|Petrovi\u0107 Castle]]) complex in Podgorica's largest public park. [[Nicholas I of Montenegro|King Nicholas]]'s castle, ''Perjani\u010dki Dom'' (House of the Honour Guard), castle chapel and surrounding buildings were converted to an art gallery in 1984. Since 1995, it has been part of the Modern Arts Centre (''Centar savremenih umjetnosti'') and houses approximately 1,500 works of art. The historic Cinema of Culture (''Kino Kultura''), which was founded in 1949, was closed in November 2008 due to continuous financial losses it generated. It was the only cinema in the city for 6 decades. The building of the former cinema will be converted to host the Podgorica City Theatre. Shortly after its closure, a [[Ster-Kinekor]] (later acquired by [[Cineplexx Cinemas|Cineplexx]]) 6-screen [[Multiplex (movie theater)|multiplex]] cinema opened at [[Delta City]] shopping mall.\n\nA significant cultural institution of over fifty years' standing is the Budo Tomovi\u0107 Cultural-Informational Centre (''KIC Budo Tomovi\u0107''). It is a public institution which organizes various artistic events, including Podgorica Cultural Summer (''Podgori\u010dko Kulturno Ljeto''), FIAT \u2013 International Alternative Theatre Festival (''Festival Internacionalnog Alternativnog Teatra''), DEUS \u2013 December Arts Scene (''Decembarska Umjetni\u010dka Scena'').\n\n==Media==\nPodgorica is the media hub of Montenegro. It is home to the headquarters of the state-owned [[public television]] broadcaster [[RTCG]]. Commercial broadcasters in Podgorica include [[RTV A1]], [[TV Vijesti]], [[Nova M]] and [[Prva TV]]. It was announced that the city's local television will be launched soon.<ref>[http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html Mugo\u0161a: Podgorica dobija svoju televiziju] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723040909/http://www.cgvijesti.net/209191_Mugosa-Podgorica-dobija-svoju-televiziju.html |date=23 July 2011 }}</ref> Their programmes can be received in much of Montenegro.\n\nAll Montenegro's daily newspapers (oldest Montenegrin daily newspaper ''[[Pobjeda]]'', ''[[Vijesti]]'', ''[[Dnevne Novine]]'' and ''[[Dan (newspaper)|Dan]]'') are published in Podgorica, as the weekly magazines ''[[The Monitor (Montenegro)|Monitor]]'' and ''[[Magazin BIT]]''.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Novi_Grad,_Podgorica,_Montenegro_-_panoramio_(34).jpg|thumb|right|[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]].]]\nThe most popular sports by far are [[association football|football]] and [[basketball]]. Basketball became especially popular with the success in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of [[KK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|KK Budu\u0107nost]], both in [[ABA League|Regional]] and European competitions.\n\nFootball in Podgorica has a long tradition associated with [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|Budu\u0107nost]]. World-famous players [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]] and [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]] were born in Podgorica and made their debut in that team. The club [[FK Zeta]] from the Podgorica suburb of [[Golubovci]] has also reached the former first league of Serbia and Montenegro. These clubs, along with [[FK Sutjeska Nik\u0161i\u0107|Sutjeska]] from Nik\u0161i\u0107, usually compete with each other for leading position in the [[First League of Montenegro]].\nOther clubs from Podgorica and its surroundings play in the Montenegrin First League e.g. [[OFK Titograd]] & [[FK Kom|Kom]]. One of the most popular clubs from the suburbs is [[FK Ribnica]] from [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik]], [[FK Zabjelo]] from [[Zabjelo]] and [[OFK Mladost Lje\u0161kopolje|OFK Mladost 1970]] from ''Donja Gorica''.\n\nThe volleyball team [[OK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica|OK Budu\u0107nost]] and the women's handball team [[\u017dRK Budu\u0107nost T-Mobile]] have had significant success in European competition. [[Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] is the most important sports club in Podgorica. Its name means ''Future''.\n\n[[Chess]] is another popular sport and some famous global chess players, like [[Slavko Dedi\u0107]], are born in Podgorica.\n\nSporting events like the annual [[Podgorica Marathon]] and the ''Mora\u010da River'' jumps attract international competitors.\nPodgorica was the host of [[2009 FINA Men's Water Polo World League]].\n\n===Venues===\n[[File:PodgoricaCityStadium2017.jpeg|thumb|right|[[Podgorica City Stadium]]]]\nPodgorica has a number of sporting venues; some are under reconstruction and expansion. The main ones are:\n*[[Podgorica City Stadium]]. It has a capacity of 11,264 and it is the home of [[FK Budu\u0107nost Podgorica]] and the [[Montenegro national football team]]. It is currently the only venue in Montenegro that complies with [[FIFA]] standards for international football matches.\n*[[Mora\u010da Sports Center]], a multi functional indoor sport facility. It has a capacity of 6 000 seats. It hosted one group of [[EuroBasket 2005]], while other games were played in [[Belgrade Arena|Belgrade]], [[Millennium Centar|Vr\u0161ac]], and [[Spens Sports Center|Novi Sad]].\n\nAlmost every football club in Podgorica has its own stadium, although these are often only fields with small stands or no stands at all.\nOther notable venues are the [[Stadion malih sportova]] under Gorica hill and the [[sport shooting]] range under Ljubovi\u0107 hill. There are many other sports facilities around the city, most notably [[indoor soccer]] fields.\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Podgorica_National_bank_of_Montenegro.JPG|thumb|left|Central Bank of Montenegro.]]\n[[File:Podgorica-Tuzi plantaze wineyard IMG 1318 Cijevna river.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of the [[Planta\u017ee]] wineyard, this wine field is the largest single one in Europe.]]\nPodgorica is not only the administrative centre of Montenegro, but also its main economic engine. Most of Montenegro's industrial, financial, and commercial base is in Podgorica. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nBefore World War I, most of Podgorica's economy was in trade and small-scale manufacture, which was an economic model established during the long rule of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} After World War II, Podgorica became Montenegro's capital and a focus of the rapid urbanization and industrialization of the SFRY era. Industries such as aluminium and tobacco processing, [[textile industry|textiles]], engineering, vehicle production, and wine production were established in and around the city. In 1981, Podgorica's GDP per capita was 87% of the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{cite book | title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju | year=1984 | edition=3rd | publisher=Sveu\u010dili\u0161na naklada Liber | location=Zagreb | language=Croatian | editor1-first=Radovan | editor1-last=Radovinovi\u0107 | editor2-first=Ivan | editor2-last=Berti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1990s, the [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|dissolution of Yugoslavia]], [[Yugoslav wars]], and the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 757|UN-imposed sanctions]] left Podgorica's industries without traditional markets, suppliers, and available funds. This, combined with typical [[Transition economy|transition]] pressures, led to a decline of the industrial base, where many industries collapsed leaving thousands of citizens unemployed. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} However, some of the industries, including [[Podgorica Aluminium Plant|Podgorica aluminium smelter]] and [[Planta\u017ee]], managed to survive the turmoil of the 1990s, and are still major contributors to Montenegrin export and industrial output to this day.\n\nAs Montenegro began its push for independence from Serbia in the late 1990s, Podgorica greatly benefited from increased concentration of government and service sectors. {{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} In addition to almost the entire country's government, Podgorica is home to the [[Montenegro Stock Exchange]] and other major Montenegrin financial institutions, along with telecommunications carriers, media outlets, [[Montenegro Airlines|Montenegrin flag carrier airline]], and other significant institutions and companies.\n\nThe large presence of government and service sectors spared the economy of Podgorica from prolonged stagnation in the [[Great Recession|late 2000s recession]], which hit Montenegro hard. Although, in mid-2014, some 30% of Montenegro's citizens lived in Podgorica, the municipality accounted for 44% of the country's employed. Out of the entire mass of paid nwt salaries in Montenegro in that year, some 47% was paid in Podgorica. The average monthly net salary in May, 2014 was \u20ac509 in Podgorica municipality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monstat.org/userfiles/file/publikacije/2014/6/zaposlenost%20i%20zarade.pdf |title=Monthly Statistical Review, no. 6/2014 |format=pdf|publisher=Monstat |date=2014-05-05 |accessdate=2014-10-13}}</ref>\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Capital Plaza of Podgorica Trg Svetog Petra Cetinjskog IMG 1291 Ulitsa Dr Ljubomira Ra\u0161ovi\u0107a.jpg|The Capital Plaza\nFile:Telenor.JPG|Telenor Center\nFile:DeltaPG.JPG|Delta City\nFile:PC Kru\u0161evac.JPG|TC Kru\u0161evac\n</gallery>\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Further|Demographics of Podgorica}}\n{{Historical populations\n|type =\n|1948|14369 |1953|19868 |1961|35054 |1971|61727 |1981|96074 |1991|117875 |2003|136473 |2011|150977 |2018|199715\n|\n}}\n\nAlthough medium-sized by European standards, Podgorica is by far the largest city in [[Montenegro]]: almost one third of Montenegrin citizens live there.

The average age of the population is 35.7. [[Serbian language|Serbian]] is the most spoken language, with 42.4% of Podgorica citizens declaring it as their first language. It is followed closely by [[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]], at 41.17%. Other significant languages spoken in Podgorica are [[Albanian language|Albanian]] (5.53%) and [[Romani language|Romani]] (1.81%).\n\nThe majority of Podgorica citizens are [[Orthodox Christians]] (78.27%), while there are significant minorities of [[Muslims]] (11.23%) and [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] (4.27%).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"100\" | Nationality (2011 census)\n! width=\"80\" | Number\n! width=\"80\" | Percentage\n|-\n| [[Montenegrins]] || 106,642 || 57.35%\n|-\n| [[Serbs]] || 43,248 || 23.26%\n|-\n| [[Albanians]] || 9,538 || 5.13%\n|-\n| [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims]] || 4,122 || 2.22%\n|-\n| [[Bosniaks]] || 3,687\t || 1,98%\n|-\n| [[Romani people|Romani]] || 3,988 || 2.14%\n|-\n| others || 5,820 || 3.13%\n|-\n| undeclared || 8,892 || 4.78%'''\n|}\n\n==Religion==\n[[File:Podgorica, cattedrale della resurrezione di cristo, esterno 01.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ, Podgorica|Cathedral of Podgorica]].]]\n[[File:Manastir Dajbabe - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Dajbabe Monastery]].]]\n\nPodgorica is home to three main religious groups: [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]], [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] and [[Catholicism|Catholic Christians]].\n\nOrthodox Christian population mostly originates from the local [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] and [[Serb]] population, which accepted [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Middle Ages after a major split during [[East\u2013West Schism|The Great Schism]].

There are various Eastern Orthodox churches in the City such as St. George Church which originates from the 13th century, or [[Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ (Podgorica)|Cathedral of the Resurrection of Christ]] which is the largest church in the city to have been recently erected.\nThe [[Muslims|Muslim]] population mostly originates from local [[Bosniaks]], as well as [[Albanians]].\n\nThere are several mosques in Podgorica and [[Tuzi]]. Catholic population mainly consists of local Albanian minority. The main religious site for the Catholic population located in the [[Konik, Montenegro|Konik neighbourhood]] is the [[Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus (Podgorica)|Church of the Holy Heart of Jesus]] constructed in 1966, in [[Brutalist architecture|Brutalist]] style which makes this object unique. Other Catholic objects are located in eastern suburb Tuzi.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Religion\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Number\n! style=\"width:80px;\"|Percentage\n|-\n|[[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodoxy]]||145,575||78.29%\n|-\n|[[Muslims|Islam]] ||20,883||11.23%\n|-\n|[[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]] ||7,947||4.27%\n|-\n|[[Christians|Other Christian]]||568||0.31%\n|-\n|[[Agnostic]]||225||0.12%\n|-\n|[[Atheist]]||3,698||1.99%\n|-\n|Other||1,961||1.05%\n|-\n|Did not declare||4,583 ||\n|}\n\n==Administration==\n[[File:Podgorica City Hall, 2019.jpg|thumb|left|Podgorica City Hall.]]\n[[File:PodgoricaUrbanSubdivisions.png|thumb|350px|right|[[List of Podgorica neighbourhoods and suburbs|Podgorica urban subdivisions]]]]\nThe city administration consists of mayor, city [[deliberative assembly|assembly]] and a number of secretariats and administrative bodies which together act as a city local government. The city assembly has 59 members, elected directly for four-year terms. The mayor used to be directly elected for five-year term, but since the new law was introduced in Montenegrin municipalities mayors will be elected by the city assembly and will have to maintain its support during his term. Separate elections are held for the local sub-division of [[Golubovci]] since it is part of their administrative autonomy inside Podgorica municipality. Constant questions are raised by various politicians over gaining separate municipality status for [[Golubovci]]. In 2018, [[Tuzi Municipality|Tuzi]] became its own municipality after a vote on the Montenegrin Parliament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdm.me/english/tuzi-will-become-independent-municipality/|title=Tuzi became its own Municipality.}}</ref>\n\nOn local elections held on 25 May 2014, the [[Democratic Party of Socialists]] won 29 seats in the municipal assembly, one short of 30 needed to form a majority. [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] won 17 seats, [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|SNP]] won 8 seats, while coalition made of [[Positive Montenegro]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro|SDP]] won 5 seats. After lengthy negotiations, SDP dissolved coalition with Pozitivna, and made arrangement on forming majority with DPS, similar to one they have in national government. While SDP is longtime partner of DPS at national level, it has been in opposition in Podgorica municipal assembly in 2010-2014 period. \nSince October 2014, position of the mayor is held by [[Democratic Party of Socialists|DPS]] official, Slavoljub Stijepovi\u0107, replacing Podgorica mayor od 14 years, [[Miomir Mugo\u0161a]].\n\n===City Assembly===\n{{see|Podgorica City Assembly election, 2018}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n!colspan=2|Party/Coalition\n!Seats\n!Local government\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #F6931D\" |\n| [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro|Democratic Party of Socialists]] \n| {{Composition bar|32|60|hex=#F6931D}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: red\" |\n| [[Democratic Montenegro]] \n| {{Composition bar|12|60|hex=#FF0000}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkred\" |\n| [[United Reform Action]]\n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkred}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: darkblue\" |\n| [[Democratic Front (Montenegro)|Democratic Front]] \n| {{Composition bar|5|60|hex=darkblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: cornflowerblue\" |\n| [[Socialist People's Party of Montenegro|Socialist People's Party]]\n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=cornflowerblue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: #fd00ff\" |\n| [[Social Democrats of Montenegro|Social Democrats]] \n| {{Composition bar|3|60|hex=#fd00ff}}\n| {{yes|Government}}\n|-\n! style=\"background-color: blue\" |\n| [[Albanian Alternative]]\n| {{Composition bar|1|60|hex=blue}}\n| {{no|Opposition}}\n|}\n\n===Local subdivisions===\n{{Main|Subdivisions of Podgorica}}\n\nThe municipality of Podgorica consists of ''Podgorica City Proper'' and one subdivision (called ''[[city municipality]],'' \u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043e\u043f\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435, ''gradske op\u0161tine''), which is [[Golubovci]].\n\nThe entire municipality of Podgorica is further divided into 57 ''[[local community|local communities]]'' (\u043c\u0458\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u0458\u0435\u0434\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0435, ''mjesne zajednice''), bodies in which the citizens participate in decisions on matters of relevance to the local community.\n\n==Education==\n\nMost of Montenegro's higher education establishments are in Podgorica. It is home to the [[University of Montenegro]], the country's most significant such institution. The following faculties are in Podgorica:\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Economics|Faculty of Economics]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Law|Faculty of Law]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Electrical Engineering|Faculty of Electrical Engineering]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Metallurgy and Technology|Faculty of Metallurgy and Technology]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Political Sciences|Faculty of Political Sciences]]\n* Faculty of [[Civil Engineering]]\n{{col-2}}\n* Faculty of [[Mechanical Engineering]]\n* Faculty of [[Natural Sciences]] and [[Mathematics]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Pharmacy|Faculty of Pharmacy]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Architecture|Faculty of Architecture]]\n* [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Biotechnology|Faculty of Biotechnology]]\n{{col-2}}\n{{col-end}}\n\nThe university's scientific research institutes are in the city:\n* Institute of Foreign Languages\n* Institute of Biotechnology\n* Institute of History\n\nThe [[Montenegrin Academy of Sciences and Arts]] is in Podgorica, as is the [[Doclean Academy of Sciences and Arts|DANU]] cultural organization.\n\nThe [[Mediterranean University]] was founded 2006 as first private university in Montenegro. In the meantime, the number of private institutions for higher education has increased, like [[University of Donja Gorica|UDG - University of Donja Gorica]]. The municipality of Podgorica has 34 elementary schools and 10 secondary schools, including one [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. The first secondary school established in Podgorica is [[Gymnasium \"Slobodan \u0160kerovi\u0107\"]]. The rebuilt economic high school offers new features and higher quality education. The Radosav Ljumovi\u0107 National Library is considered the most comprehensive in Montenegro.\n\n==Transport==\n\n===Public transport===\n[[File:PGWelcome.jpg|thumb|left|Northern entrance to Podgorica ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]).]]\n[[File:Millennium Bridge in Podgorica, Montenegro 02.jpg|thumb|left|[[Millennium Bridge (Montenegro)|Millennium Bridge]].]]\nPublic transport in Podgorica consists of 11 urban and 16 suburban bus lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.podgorica.me/%C5%BDivotuPodgorici/Saobra%C4%87aj/tabid/129/language/sr-Latn-CS/Default.aspx |title=Saobra\u0107aj |publisher=Podgorica.me |accessdate=2013-03-12 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325043642/http://www.podgorica.me/%C5%BDivotuPodgorici/Saobra%C4%87aj/tabid/129/language/sr-Latn-CS/Default.aspx |archivedate=25 March 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The city-owned ''AD Gradski saobra\u0107aj'' public transport company used to be the sole bus operator until the 1990s, when private carriers were introduced. The company went bankrupt in 2001, and buses were since operated solely by private carriers.\n\nPublic transport faces competition from very popular dispatched taxi services. De-regulation and stiff competition has made taxi services very affordable. {{Citation needed|date=August 2017}} Over 20 taxi companies are operating in Podgorica with close to 800 vehicles in service. {{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Usually, taxi companies provide a high level of service, with relatively new and uniform car fleets and [[GPS]]-tracked vehicles.\n\n===Roads===\n[[File:Sozina-Tunnel.png|thumb|350px|[[Sozina Tunnel]] shortens the journey from Podgorica to Montenegro's main port [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]], by some 25 km.]]\nPodgorica's location in central Montenegro makes it a natural hub for rail and road transport. Roads in Montenegro (especially those connecting Podgorica to northern Montenegro and [[Serbia]]) are usually inferior to modern European roads. Both major Montenegrin motorway projects, [[A-1 motorway (Montenegro)|Bar-Boljare motorway]] and [[Adriatic\u2013Ionian motorway#Montenegro|Nudo\u2013Bo\u017eaj motorway]], will pass near Podgorica. The newly built [[Sozina tunnel]] (4.2&nbsp;km) shortened the journey from Podgorica to [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] (Montenegro's main seaport) to under 30 minutes. Also a new road bypass has been constructed in 2011, to remove transport routes from north to south of the country, out of the city centre. A south-western bypass has also been planned {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}, with same goal of moving heavy transport out of the city core. Podgorica is also characteristic for its extensive network of multi-lane boulevards which make inner city transport quick and effective. Traffic over the [[Mora\u010da River]] also goes fluently since river banks are very well connected with 6 vehicular and 3 pedestrian bridges.\n\nThe current main transit connections of Podgorica are:\n* north ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]), towards [[Belgrade]] and on to Central Europe\n* west ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and on to Western Europe\n* south ([[European route E65|E65]], [[European route E80|E80]]) towards the [[Adriatic coast]]\n* east ([[European route E762|E762]]), towards [[Albania]]\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:01.10.13 Podgorica 6111.101 & 461.040 (10101220063).jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Rail Station]].]]\nPodgorica is a hub of the X-shaped [[Railways of Montenegro|Montenegrin rail network]]. The [[Belgrade\u2013Bar railway|Belgrade\u2013Bar]] line converges with the [[Nik\u0161i\u0107-Podgorica railway|line to Nik\u0161i\u0107]] and [[Podgorica\u2013Shkod\u00ebr railway|line to Shkod\u00ebr]] at the [[Podgorica Rail Station]]. The station itself is located {{convert|1.5|km|2|abbr=on}} to the southeast of the main city square. Podgorica's main railway link (for both passenger and freight traffic) is Belgrade\u2013Bar.  The link to [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]] was recently under reconstruction ([[Railway electrification system|electrification]]);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montenegroberza.com/code/navigate.asp?Id=718|title=U \u017deljeznicu ula\u017eu 52 miliona eura}}</ref> afterwards, passenger service started in October 2012. The rail link to [[Shkod\u00ebr]] is currently used as freight-only.\n\n===Air===\n[[File:Podgorica airport.jpg|thumb|[[Podgorica Airport]] near [[Golubovci]].]]\n[[Podgorica Airport]] is located in [[Zeta Plain]], {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Podgorica City centre, and is Montenegro's main international airport. The airport is locally known as Golubovci Airport (\u0410\u0435\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0440\u043e\u043c \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0443\u0431\u043e\u0432\u0446\u0438 / Aerodrom Golubovci), as it is located within the administrative boundaries of the town of [[Golubovci]]. The IATA code of the airport is still TGD because Podgorica was named Titograd, during which time the airport opened. It is the main hub for [[Montenegro Airlines]] and [[Di Air]].\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Montenegro}}\n\n===Twin towns and sister cities===\nPodgorica is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:\n*{{flagicon|NMK}} [[Skopje]], North Macedonia<ref name=\"Skopje twinnings\">{{cite web|url=http://www.skopje.gov.mk/EN/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=0&tabid=69|title=Official portal of City of Skopje \u2013 Skopje Sister Cities|publisher=2006\u20132009 [http://www.skopje.gov.mk/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=0&tabid=1 City of Skopje]|accessdate=2009-07-14}}</ref>\n\n===Partner cities===\n*{{flagicon|ARM}} [[Yerevan]], Armenia<ref name=\"Yerevan partnerships\">{{cite web|url=http://www.yerevan.am/3-233-233.html|title=Yerevan - Partner Cities|accessdate=2013-11-04|work=Yerevan Municipality Official Website|publisher=\u00a9 2005\u20142013 www.yerevan.am|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105220142/http://www.yerevan.am/3-233-233.html|archivedate=5 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people ==\n\nBelow are some of the most notable people who were either born, or spent most of their lives in Podgorica:\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Bo\u017eidar Vukovi\u0107]], one of the first printers among the [[South Slavs]]\n*[[Bla\u017eo Jovanovi\u0107]], first [[President of Montenegro|President of the People's Assembly]] of [[Montenegro]]\n*[[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]], football player, [[1990\u201391 European Cup|European Cup]] champion\n*[[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]], football player\n*[[Stevan Joveti\u0107]], football player\n*[[Du\u0161ko Vujo\u0161evi\u0107]], Montenegrin basketball coach\n*[[Marko Miljanov]], general, clan chief and writer\n*[[Vojo Stani\u0107]], sculptor and painter\n*[[Risto Stijovi\u0107]], sculptor and painter\n*[[Borislav Peki\u0107]], novelist\n*[[Nikola Radovi\u0107]], football player, Olympic silver medalist\n*[[Zoran Filipovi\u0107]] football player and coach\n*[[Du\u0161ko Radinovi\u0107]], football player\n*[[Simon Vuk\u010devi\u0107]], football player\n*[[Refik \u0160abanad\u017eovi\u0107]] football player\n*[[Dejan Zlati\u010danin]], boxer, lightweight [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] champion\n*[[Dejan Radonji\u0107]], basketball player and coach\n*[[Nikola Bulatovi\u0107]], basketball player\n*[[Ljiljana Mugo\u0161a]], handball player, Olympic champion\n*[[Svetlana Mugo\u0161a-Anti\u0107]], handball player, Olympic champion\n*[[Nikola Miroti\u0107]], Spanish basketball player, Olympic bronze medalist and European champion\n*[[Ivan Strugar]], kick-boxer\n*[[An\u0111ela Bulatovi\u0107]], handball player, Olympic silver medalist and European champion\n*[[Jovanka Radi\u010devi\u0107]], handball player, Olympic silver medalist and European champion\n*[[Knez (singer)|Nenad Kne\u017eevi\u0107 \"Knez\"]], pop singer\n*[[Sergej \u0106etkovi\u0107]], pop singer\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Honorary citizens===\n\n*{{flagicon|CRO}} [[Stjepan Mesi\u0107]], former [[List of Presidents of Croatia|President of Croatia]].\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:Podgorica City Hall Independence Day Montenegro.jpg|Podgorica City Hall on Independence Day\nFile:Podgorica Trg Republike.JPG|[[Independence Square (Podgorica)|Independence Square]]\nFile:Vaso Brajovic.jpg|Monument to General [[Vaso Brajovi\u0107]]\nFile:Marko Miljanov - spomenik u Podgorici.jpg|Monument to [[Marko Miljanov]]\nFile:Josip Broz Tito Podgorica.jpg|Monument to [[Josip Broz Tito]]\nFile:Moskovska.jpg|Moscow street, Preko Mora\u010de neighbourhood\nFile:Pet udovica - panoramio.jpg|Momi\u0161i\u0107i neighbourhood\nFile:Natural History Museum of Montenegro, Sahat Kula, 2019.jpg|Natural History Museum and Clock Tower in the Old Town\n</gallery>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite book | ref = harv | url = http://www.cpi.hr/download/links/7292.pdf | chapter = Antibirokratska revolucija 1987-1989. godine | language = Serbian | first = Olivera | last = Milosavljevi\u0107 | format = PDF | title = Dijalog povjesni\u010dara - istori\u010dara 8, Zadar | editor-last1 = Graovac | editor-first1 = Igor | editor-last2 = Fleck | editor-first2 = Hans-Georg | publisher = Political Science Research Centre Ltd.
