Typically, after welding, the properties near the weld are those of 6061-T4, a loss of strength of around 40%. The material can be re-heat-treated to restore near -T6 temper for the whole piece. After welding, the material can naturally age and restore some of its strength as well. Most strength is recovered in the first few days to a few weeks. Nevertheless, the Aluminum Design Manual (Aluminum Association) recommends the design strength of the material adjacent to the weld to be taken as 165 MPa/24000 PSI without proper heat treatment after the welding. Typical filler material is 4043 or 5356.\n\n=== Extrusions ===\n6061 is an alloy used in the production of [[extrusion]]s\u2014long constant\u2013cross-section structural shapes produced by pushing metal through a shaped [[die (manufacturing)|die]].\n\n=== Forgings ===\n6061 is an alloy that is suitable for hot [[forging]]. The billet is heated through an [[induction furnace]] and forged using a closed die process. This particular alloy is suitable for open die forgings. Automotive parts, ATV parts, and industrial parts are just some of the uses as a forging. Aluminum 6061 can be forged into flat or round bars, rings, blocks, discs and blanks, hollows, and spindles. 6061 can be forged into special and custom shapes.<ref>{{Cite web|title = 6061 Aluminum Alloy Forging {{!}} Anderson Shumaker|url = http://www.andersonshumaker.com/materials/aluminum/6061-aluminum.html|website = www.andersonshumaker.com|accessdate = 2015-10-08}}</ref>\n\n===Castings===\n\n6061 is not an alloy that is traditionally cast due to its low silicon content affecting the fluidity in casting.

Typically, after welding, the properties near the weld are those of 6061-T4, a loss of strength of around 40%. The material can be re-heat-treated to restore near -T6 temper for the whole piece. After welding, the material can naturally age and restore some of its strength as well. Most strength is recovered in the first few days to a few weeks. Nevertheless, the Aluminum Design Manual (Aluminum Association) recommends the design strength of the material adjacent to the weld to be taken as 165 MPa/24000 PSI without proper heat treatment after the welding.

{"title_page": "Allocation (oil and gas)", "text_new": "In the [[petroleum industry]], '''allocation''' refers to practices of breaking down <!--fiscal--> measures of quantities of extracted <!--blend of -->[[hydrocarbons]] across various contributing sources.<ref name=\"apidef\"/> Allocation aids the attribution of ownerships of hydrocarbons as each contributing element to a commingled [[fluid flow|flow]] or to a storage of petroleum may have a unique ownership.  Contributing sources in this context are typically producing [[Oil well|petroleum wells]] delivering flows of [[petroleum]] or flows of [[natural gas]] to a commingled flow or storage.\n\nThe terms '''hydrocarbon accounting''' and allocation are sometimes used interchangeably.<ref name=\"EIGuide\"/><ref name=\"cramer\"/> Hydrocarbon accounting has a wider scope, taking advantages of allocation results, it is the petroleum management process by which ownership of extracted hydrocarbons is determined and tracked from a point of sale or discharge back to the point of extraction. In this way, hydrocarbon accounting also covers [[inventory control]], material balance, and practices to trace ownership of hydrocarbons being transported in a [[transportation system]], e.g. through [[Pipeline transport#For oil or natural gas|pipelines]] to customers distant from the production plant.\n\nIn an allocation problem, contributing sources are more widely natural gas streams, [[fluid flow]]s or [[multiphase flow]]s derived from [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formations]] or zones in a well, from wells, and from [[Oil field|fields]], <!--licences, -->unitised production entities or production facilities. In hydrocarbon accounting, quantities of extracted hydrocarbon can be further split by ownership, by \"cost oil\" or \"profit oil\" categories, and broken down to individual composition fraction types. Such components may be [[alkane]] hydrocarbons, boiling point fractions,<ref name=\"ei29\"/> and mole weight fractions.<ref name=\"wilks\"/><ref name=\"norsok\"/>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Scope and terminology ==\nThe term ''allocate''<ref name=\"wiktionary2\"/>  is being used in the sense to denote distributing according to a plan, but the etymology may also be linked to 'earmark'.<ref name=\"picexpr\"/> The term ''accounting''<ref name=\"wiktionary\"/>  is being used in the sense to denote justification of actions.<ref name=\"deloitteDef\"/>\n\nIn the context of hydrocarbon accounting, an [[oil field]] is an area developed for exploration of hydrocarbons from one or more reservoirs<ref name=\"aadland\"/> in the underground. Sometimes one well extracts hydrocarbons from more than one [[Formation (stratigraphy)|geologic formation]] or reservoir, hence it may be useful <!-- Source lost: and even a regulatory imposed requirement -->to divide the oil field and its well streams by formations or layers. More than one oil field may share infrastructure like oil processing units and pipelines. The field activities are regulated by a jurisdiction of a state and a contract of the licence. The contract is a business arrangement for exploration of the oil field between the licensor, (the [[mineral rights]] owner, onshore in United States often the land owner, elsewhere often the state possesses the ownership of mineral rights including petroleum reservoirs){{citeneeded|date=November 2019}} and a licensee to share investment costs, operational costs, and income from the oil field. In case of a [[production sharing agreement]], PSA, the licensee will take all development costs and have this capital recovered by \"cost oil\". \"Profit oil\" will be shared by licensee and the state.<ref name=\"Mazeel2010P18\"/> The licensee may be one oil company, or often a group of companies sharing the risks, costs and profit in a partnership, consortium or joint venture. When more than one company is involved, the term \"group ownership members\" is used, and the business arrangement for petroleum extraction specifies the equity of cost and income for each member company. Where a [[petroleum concessionary licence system]] is in use rather than [[petroleum contractual licence system|contractual type]] of [[petroleum fiscal regime]], ownership of extracted hydrocarbons are shared according to fixed equities of each member company.\n\n=== More specific definitions ===\n''Field allocation'' or ''platform allocation'' denotes allocation cases where contribution sources are more than one production field or more than one offshore platform, making a commingled flow into a pipeline.<ref name=hwang />\n\n''Well allocation'' is a term used in the case where the contribution sources are production petroleum wells, or any type of injection well.\n\n''Component allocation'': while the term ''product allocation'' is used to allocate the primary product groups like oil, gas or condensate ingredients (phase fractions) to a contributing well for instance,<ref name=\"sapprodalloc\"/> component allocation breaks down and allocate individual [[alkane]] hydrocarbons like [[methane]] and [[ethane]], to 3 isomers [[pentane]]s in a natural gas stream. [[Components of crude oil]] streams to be allocated may be split up by [[boiling point]] fractions.<ref name=\"ei29\"/>\n\nOther combinatorics on the allocation term include ''production allocation'',<ref name=\"elsinger\"/>\n''hydrocarbon allocation'',<ref name=\"engineerlive\"/> ''pipeline allocation'' and ''back allocation''.<ref name=hwang/><ref name=Lorentzen14Estimation/><ref name=Leskens08Downhole/> ''Export allocation'' denotes the allocation at a custody transfer where production quantities are transferred from an oil field. Allocation at exports decide exactly what quantities each partner of the contract is paid for.<ref name=\"ei13\"/> ''Ownership allocation'' is also used to denote the income distribution from extracted hydrocarbons on each partner of a licence or joint business arrangement area.\n\n=== Scope ===\nAllocation is an ongoing process based on flow or volume [[measurements]], and gives the distribution of contributing sources, often with a final calculation per day, which in turn provides the basis for a daily production report in the case of a field that produces hydrocarbons. Moreover, the allocation process may be designed to split up a flow of multiple products of the individual ingredients or phase fractions, for example when associated gas and water are supplied with a crude oil flow,<ref name=\"deloitteDef\"/> and each fraction within the commingled flow or storage is allocated between the contributors and its ownership.  A traditional allocation practice will execute quantity calculations for [[crude oil]], [[natural-gas condensate]] and [[produced water]] based on measured results from periodic, time-limited  [[Well test (oil and gas)|well tests]]. [[Natural gas]] flows from pure gas wells are usually measured continuously at or near the individual [[wellhead]]s.\n\nWithin the wider scope of hydrocarbon accounting; all measurements and parameters used for calculations are being deposited in a data storage, results of calculations along with methods used in calculations, are stored in a manner that is accepted by the internal and external audit. Stored results can be further utilised to optimise the reservoir performance of a producing field, possibly optimising the utilisation in case of a transportation system.\n\nThe hydrocarbon accounting process is emphasizing the tracking of all hydrocarbons through flows until a sale to a customer has occurred or hydrocarbons are disposed for including all fluid discharges, vents and [[Gas flare|flaring of gas]], consumption of gas for power production at the facility, and quantities of [[evaporation]] from oil storages. Similarly, measurements of injected flow of water and gas into the reservoir through injection wells are being part of hydrocarbon accounting.\n\n== Demand for allocation ==\nAllocation is commercial rooted in the need to distribute the costs, revenues and taxes among multiple players collaborating on field development and production of oil and gas. There are various incentives for collaboration, one is risk and cost sharing, the practice by issuing licenses for exploration and production to a partnership of oil companies. Another is the aim of improving production efficiency,  by extracting from multiple [[Land (economics)|land properties]] or multiple oil fields by shared arrangement for production, also called unitisation.\n\nProduction allocation to wellbore or completion is required for Reservoir Simulation where the dynamic geological model is history matched and used for production forecasting.\n\n=== History ===\nThe principle of unitised production, to allow for more efficient development of new exploration areas, was established for the Van field in the [[State of Texas]], US, since 1929,<ref name=\"vanfield\"/><ref name=\"Warner2007\"/> and this practice has been developed to a widespread \"hidden law of unitisation\" in Texas.<ref name=\"eubanks\"/> Even before 1929, it was early established a practice of sharing equipment to extract from several wells.<ref name=\"johnson\"/> Today, most US states except Texas, have compulsory unitization statutes. Ownership and extraction of oil and gas in the ground of USA is regulated by the present [[oil and gas law in the United States]].\n\nSharing risks by a joint venture of several companies to field development, production and transportation, and [[Downstream (petroleum industry)|downstream]] activities has also been going on for long time, specifically for cross border arrangements.<ref name=\"oilgovern146\"/> In the [[North Sea]], oil companies shared risk in consortia, and in the initial licence round regulated by Norwegian government, more than half of the licences were awarded partnerships of several licensees.<ref name=\"oilgovern151\"/> It has also been a clear tendency towards transition to awarding licences to partnerships.\n\nIn recent times, cost savings have become an impetus for shared utilisation of infrastructures for processing and transport of oil and gas in areas of extraction from the ground. Methods are being developed to allocate back contributions into commingled streams in pipeline, when oil is being transported from a collection of offshore oil fields to facilities terminals onshore in Asia.<ref name=hwang/>\n\nRecent restructuring in this industry for [[enhanced oil recovery]], deepwater field development, and use of subsea production systems that commingled production flows from multiple oil fields,<ref name=\"Parshall\"/> strengthen the requirements for flexible and accurate allocation systems, to keep up with the transition from conventional [[Well test (oil and gas)|well flow testing]] to prevalence of model simulations, virtual flow meters and multiphase flow meters.<ref name=\"gjesdal\"/>\n\n=== Benefits ===\nThere are multiple operational benefits from allocation.  Detailed results from allocation to wells, or even to oil or gas layers per well, are used to manage the production process.\n\nResults from the allocation process are important feed into production reporting to governments and partners, and allocation results may also feed operator's internal systems for product sales, [[Accounting system|accounting]], [[enterprise resource planning]], [[data warehouse]], and [[management information systems|management information]]. Allocation and hydrocarbon accounting are supporting information to the wider business area ''petroleum accounting'', the latter considering life cycle business and financial aspects of oil field operations.<ref name=\"WrigthGallun2005\"/>\n\n== Allocation practices and methods ==\nTransparency, fairness and compliance with audit requirements are fundamental criteria for the design of allocation practices and methods. Furthermore, the implemented processes should be cost efficient as well as practical to operate. Requirements for the measurement processes and the associated allocation process are set by legislation and the relevant government authority, contract documents governing the relationship between the operator, partners, licensor, and government may also provide guidelines for allocation. Details of design configuration and setup can be read out of available [[piping and instrumentation diagram]]s, [[process flow diagram]]s and other documentation showing [[flow measurement]] and connections between measuring points via flow from wells to sale points. P&ID showing downhole sensors may also contribute to the design of an allocation process.\n\nPartners involved in any allocation system, agree upon and establish a set of principles to follow. <!--Important elements are inclusion of all kind of stocks in the allocation system, such that materials held in pipelines, process equipment, and intermediate storages, are accounted for.--> The principles states the units and measurement types used in allocations, i.e. where to account mass, volume, molar or energy balance. Since physical properties of hydrocarbons are constantly changing when hydrocarbons from various contributing sources are mixed, affected by [[heat transfer]] and transitions in pressure and temperature, owners of hydrocarbon in a commingled material cannot be allocated materials equal to what physically delivered from their well. For instance, two multiphase streams are commingled, one with oil of mole weight 107 and gas of 20&nbsp;kg/kgmol, the other of 116 and 21 respectively, may result in a commingled stream of 115&nbsp;kg/kgmol for the oil and mole weight of 20.3&nbsp;kg/kgmol for the gas. The allocation principles account for this effect.<ref name=\"EIGuide\"/>\n\n=== Sample configurations ===\n[[File:Oil field flow metering.svg|right|350px|thumb|'''Figure 1:''' Illustration of meter setup in allocation problems, simplified for clarity. A host field \"A\" processing plant separates, processes and exports hydrocarbon flows from field \"A\", and two satellite fields \"B\" and \"C\".<br/ > Legend: Red M is custody transfer meter, black M fiscal meter, gray M indicate optional allocation meter.<ref name=\"ercb\"/>]]\nAllocation systems seen in the figure to the right:\n* Fields \"B\" and \"C\" are each a basic allocation system where all the measured out-flow quantities from the field are allocated to the respective wells, and allocation can be conducted on all phases, oil, gas, water. (\"B\" and \"C\" have possible subsea plants only.)\n* Field \"A\", an oil field where fluid of oil, produced water and associated gas is extracted. If free of pipeline connection, field \"A\" illustrates the typical allocation case. A processing plant splits crude oil into three fractions. Metering stations on the export point satisfy requirements for [[custody transfer]], measuring instrument for flare gas is a fiscal measurement if subject to taxation, it depends on regulatory requirements. Measurement of well streams will typically have lower accuracy, or no meters are installed, when estimation processes are in use.\n* All together, the collection of fields is a field allocation system in which contributions in sales products are allocated to each of the three fields.\n\n=== Measurements ===\nNot all streams and measurements at a production plant will feed an allocation process, but all allocations need at least measurement of the total out-flow or total volume, along with measurements, or estimates for, or some physical properties of the contributing flows included in the total.\n\nFiscal measurements meet the statutory requirements for accuracy in the jurisdiction for tax payments to the government; custody transfer measurements meet the requirements for financial transactions between buyers and sellers of hydrocarbons; allocation measurements helps support the allocation of all contributors to a commingled flow, whereby it also supports ownership allocation. Allocation measurements may not meet custody transfer standards.\n\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|+ Flow measurement and allocation\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Flow location'''\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Measurement type'''\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Allocation'''\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| Flow to an export transportation system, (pipeline, tanker, truck)  ||Fiscal measurement and <br />Custody transfer measurement||Back allocation to field or well, ownership allocation\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| Flow into and out of an intermediate fluid storage||Custody transfer measurement||Back allocation to field or well\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| Flow to consumption, power, flare||Fiscal measurement||N/A\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| Flow to shared facility, from a satellite field||Custody transfer measurement (when ownership changes)||Field allocation\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| Flow from the reservoir||Allocation measurement||Back allocation to well or formation\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| Flow from a gas well||E.g. with ultrasonic flow meter|| \n|-\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| Flow from an oil well||Well test or with multiphase meter for instance|| \n|-\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| Various flows within the processing facility||Meters with sufficient accuracies|| \n|-\n| colspan=\"3\"  align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"|'''Table 1:''' A selection of places where flows are measured.

Available meters in the market are characterized by properties such as accuracy, operational rangebility: flowrate, viscosity, velocity, pressure and temperature conditions, durability and demand with respect to calibration and monitoring, the ability to withstand contaminants, injected chemicals, salty and acidic environment. For the application of custody transfer measurements of fluid hydrocarbons, [[positive displacement meters]] and [[turbine meters]] have been preferred.<ref name=\"suri\"/>  For gas metering, [[Gas meter#Orifice meters|gas orifice meters]] and [[ultrasonic flow meters]] are most common.<ref name=\"O&GHB\"/> [[Gas meter#Coriolis meters|Coriolis meters]] are in use for liquid measurements, but can also take gas measurement applications.<ref name=\"Yoder\"/>\n\nFor the application of allocation measurements, [[multiphase flow meter]]s have been adopted, especially for subsea production systems. These equipments are able to deduce the proportion and flow rate of each fluid phase.\n\n=== Estimates, alternatives for measures ===\nIn some locations it is too costly or not practical to implement metering of flow rates, e.g. down in the wells and in many places at process plants, especially on subsea plants. However, a set of methods and techniques that aim to provide estimates for flows, are adopted by the industry to solve allocation problems.\n\n;Geochemical allocation\n[[Gas chromatography]] and [[isotope analysis]] <!-- and [[Isotope geochemistry]] ? -->are the known methods that are used for determining the characteristics of hydrocarbon material samples.<ref name=\"bazan\"/> The method is also named ''oil fingerprinting'', and uses data about the chemical and isotope composition of liquid and gas flow for each contribution that is collected. Samples from each contributing stream is parsed, and fingerprints established, for example by using whole-oil gas chromatography methods. These fingerprints are then recognized in aggregate flows, which in turn can help to allocate back to the sources.\n\nApplications of this method comprise allocation of single [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] or layer in a commingled well,<ref name=\"Mccaffrey\"/> and allocation of commingled pipeline oil to contributing oil fields.<ref name=\"hwang\"/><ref name=\"elsinger\"/> Moreover, the adoption of fingerprinting is widely spread geographically, it includes North America and the Middle East.<ref name=\"Nouvelle\"/>\n\n;Flow rate estimation\nThere are varieties of methods for estimating the flow rate of the wells when flow measurements are unavailable. Models describe multiphase flows behaviour under different conditions, and they are continuously being supplied with readings from pressure, temperature, and pressure drop across the [[venturi effect|venturi]] and density, and other properties.<ref name=\"cramer2009\"/> [[Numerical weather prediction#Ensembles|Ensemble]] based [[data assimilation]] methods are among available techniques for back allocation to reservoir formations.<ref name=Lorentzen14Estimation/><ref name=Leskens08Downhole/>\n\nA ''virtual flow meter'' is a type of an implementation using such methods. Some gas and condensate fields in the [[North Sea]] are developed with subsea templates where [[multiphase flow meter]]s are installed for each well and virtual flow meters for each well are taken in use as a backup for and redundancy to the flow meters.<ref name=\"larsen\"/><ref name=\"Angelo\"/>\n\n''Process models and phase behaviour models'' are other implementations of rate estimation. With the aid of commercially available software, process models simulate the behaviour of hydrocarbons in the processing plant. Among other purposes it is used for calculation of shrinkage factors or expansion factors and estimation of flow inside the plant that does not have meters. The models build on the theory of [[thermodynamic]]s to predict the behaviour of components in the streams. Examples of [[equations of state]] that contribute to the calculations in such models are [[Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state]] and/or \n[[Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong]]. Process models with simulations are in use in allocation systems at North Sea plants.<ref name=\"Stockton\"/>\n\n=== Uncertainty in measures and allocation ===\nIn the oil and gas industry, it is common that the regulatory authorities in the country set requirements for all measurements of produced hydrocarbons, where such measurements affect taxes or royalties to the government, the fiscal measurements. Requirements can be found in a guideline and be specific in the way uncertainties are targeted. Examples of targets in publicly available standards and guidelines are:\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ Flow measurement and target uncertainties\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|&nbsp;\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Newfoundland,<br/>Labrador,<br/>Nova Scotia<ref name=\"cnlopb\"/>\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|United<br/>Kingdom<ref name=\"DECCMeter\"/>\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Norway<ref name=\"npdreg\"/>\n|-\n|  style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Liquid volume||\u00b10.25%||\u00b10.25%||\u00b10.3%\n|-\n|  style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Gas mass||\u00b11%||\u00b11%||\u00b11%\n|}\n\nFor oil and gas well allocation, Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia Offshore Areas, Drilling and Production Regulations,<ref name=\"cnlopb\"/> for example, requires accuracy within \u00b15%.\n\nIn general, the total uncertainty of the allocation system is related to [[measurement uncertainty]] of each measured input. Investments in improved metering systems and operations to reduce the uncertainty may be subject to cost benefit analysis that points to an optimum, overall uncertainty in the allocated products.<ref name=\"ei13\"/>\n\n=== Proportional allocation ===\n[[File:Well test separator.svg|thumb|right|400px|'''Figure 2:''' Periodic [[Well test (oil and gas)|well tests]] on the production plant is the conventional way to get an estimated or theoretical production contribution per phase fraction per well per month. This plant is receiving a multi phased flow of oil and gas from many wells via a manifold. Flow from one well at a time is taken to the test separator (shaded). The output flow rates are measured for each phase fraction.]]\n\nIt is easy to implement measures of flow rates of commingled, single phase hydrocarbon flows under normal pressure and temperature, but often not feasible to measure the individual well flow rate of multiphase streams from oil wells, under high temperature and pressure, while achieving known and acceptable uncertainty in the measurements. A practical adaptation to this problem is to estimate or otherwise prepare theoretical estimates of the flow rate from the individual wells, and somehow normalise the estimates to even out discrepancies with the measured overall product stream from a production facility.\n\nThe conventional approach of estimating individual flow performance from contributing oil wells in the allocation problem is the [[Well test (oil and gas)#Flow test|well test]] practice using test [[Separator (oil production)|separator]].<ref name=\"cramer2009\"/>\n\n;Proportional allocation calculation\nThis is generally the most intuitive procedure, allocating a stream to the contributing stream sources in proportions according to a known quantity.<ref name=\"ei38\"/>\n\n:<math> Q_k = C_k{Q_T\\over\\sum_{k=1}^N C_k} </math> \nwhere\n:N is the number of contributing sources, for example number of wells\n:<math>Q_T</math> is the total quantity in stream to be allocated \n:<math>C_k</math> is a measured or estimated quantity portion of contributor k, for example from a [[Well test (oil and gas)#Flow test|flow test]]\n:<math>Q_k</math> is the portion of the total allocated to contributor k\n\nThe quantity Q could be mass or energy as well as volume. The allocation calculations are carried out per phase, for example oil, gas and water respectively.\n\n;Example with calculations to illustrate the principle of proportional allocation\nAssume that the flows of separated oil from two production units go to a common storage tank. The tank is used as a cache so that the owners of the oil can get their load according to an [[entitlement]] plan. Allocation is first calculated using estimated production from each well, based on well testing.\n\nThe results of a [[Well test (oil and gas)#Flow test|well test]] in May are shown in the column \"Theoretical production\" below. Suppose it was measured in 610,000 barrels (corrected, measured total) of oil produced by end of May 2013.\n\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ An example of monthly production allocation via theoretical oil production from well test\n| align=\"left\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Plant /<br>platform'''\n| align=\"right\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Well'''\n| align=\"right\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Hours<br>contributing'''\n| align=\"right\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Hours<br>on test'''\n| align=\"right\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Test<br>results'''\n| align=\"right\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Calculation'''\n| align=\"right\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Theoretical<br>production'''\n| align=\"right\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Calculation'''\n| align=\"right\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Well<br>allocation'''\n|-\n| align=\"left\"|\"Skink\"||S-1||672||24||5000||5000*672/24||140,000||140000*610000/615800|| 138,681 \n|-\n| ||S-2||672||24||4000||4000*672/24||112,000||112000*610000/615800|| 110,945 \n|-\n| ||S-5||672||24||4500||4500*672/24||126,000||126000*610000/615800|| 124,813 \n|-\n| ||||||||||||||Plant total|| 374,440 \n|-\n| align=\"left\"|\"Gecko\"||G-2||696||12||2500||2500*696/12||145,000||145000*610000/615800|| 143,634 \n|-\n| ||G-3||696||12||1000||1000*696/12||58,000||58000*610000/615800|| 57,454 \n|-\n| ||G-5||696||24||1200||1200*696/24||34,800||34800*610000/615800|| 34,472 \n|-\n| ||||||||||||||Plant total|| 235,560 \n|-\n| colspan=\"6\"  align=\"left\"|Theoretical tank total||615,800||||\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\"  align=\"left\"|Corrected, measured total (Net quantity)|| 610,000\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\"  align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"|'''Table 2:''' The example shows the final allocation by month end. <br />It distributes the total measured oil, 610,000 bbl to each well, at the proportion of estimates given by the well test results. <br />\nThe case is simplified for illustration purposes.<ref name=\"WrightGallun2005P237\"/>\n|}\n\n;Field factor\n:<math> FF = {Q_n\\over\\sum_{k=1}^N TH_k} </math>&nbsp;&nbsp;where&nbsp;&nbsp;<math> TH_k </math> is the theoretical (estimated) production for well k;&nbsp;&nbsp;N is the number of wells;&nbsp;&nbsp;<math> Q_n </math> is the net quantity, the measured and corrected total\n\nIn table 2, the field factor is 610,000 over 615,800, equal to 0.99058.\n\n;Corrected well allocation\nThe effect of field factor is to distribute the difference between fiscal measured total and theoretical total, 5,800 bbl, evenly at the same proportion across all wells.<ref name=\"Lorentzen\"/>\n:<math> WA_k = TH_k * FF </math>\n\n=== Probabilistic allocation ===\nProbabilistic rate allocation fully exploits the available measurement configuration and knowledge about measurement noise characteristics to achieve a more accurate allocation as well as uncertainty quantification.<ref name=\"tewari2018\"/> This is particularly beneficial for allocation accuracy when additional per-well measurements are available, such as the fluid rate per well derived from a rod pump [https://production-technology.org/sucker-rod-pumping-system/ dynamometer card], or (manual) measurements of the per-well water fraction. This method combines measurements taken at different times using a probabilistic dynamic model for the production type curve.\n\n=== Ownership allocation ===\nWhen a fluid stream is owned by a compound ownership, each owner's equity is allocated in accordance with their share. For joint venture contractual arrangement with fixed equities, allocation is in the proportion of their share of ownership.<ref name=\"ei34\"/> [[Production sharing agreements]] may lead to further splits into cost oil and profit oil categories.\n\n;Example of equity-based allocation with calculations\nThree companies A, B, and C cooperate in a joint venture contractual arrangement with fixed equity shares.

Contributing sources in this context are typically producing [[Oil well|petroleum wells]] delivering flows of [[petroleum]] or flows of [[natural gas]] to a commingled flow or storage.\n\nThe terms '''hydrocarbon accounting''' and allocation are sometimes used interchangeably.<ref name=\"EIGuide\"/><ref name=\"cramer\"/> Hydrocarbon accounting has a wider scope, taking advantages of allocation results, it is the petroleum management process by which ownership of extracted hydrocarbons is determined and tracked from a point of sale or discharge back to the point of extraction. In this way, hydrocarbon accounting also covers [[inventory control]], material balance, and practices to trace ownership of hydrocarbons being transported in a [[transportation system]], e.g. through [[Pipeline transport#For oil or natural gas|pipelines]] to customers distant from the production plant.\n\nIn an allocation problem, contributing sources are more widely natural gas streams, [[fluid flow]]s or [[multiphase flow]]s derived from [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formations]] or zones in a well, from wells, and from [[Oil field|fields]], <!--licences, -->unitised production entities or production facilities. In hydrocarbon accounting, quantities of extracted hydrocarbon can be further split by ownership, by \"cost oil\" or \"profit oil\" categories, and broken down to individual composition fraction types. Such components may be [[alkane]] hydrocarbons, boiling point fractions,<ref name=\"ei29\"/> and mole weight fractions.<ref name=\"wilks\"/><ref name=\"norsok\"/>\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Scope and terminology ==\nThe term ''allocate''<ref name=\"wiktionary2\"/>  is being used in the sense to denote distributing according to a plan, but the etymology may also be linked to 'earmark'.<ref name=\"picexpr\"/> The term ''accounting''<ref name=\"wiktionary\"/>  is being used in the sense to denote justification of actions.<ref name=\"deloitteDef\"/>\n\nIn the context of hydrocarbon accounting, an [[oil field]] is an area developed for exploration of hydrocarbons from one or more reservoirs<ref name=\"aadland\"/> in the underground. Sometimes one well extracts hydrocarbons from more than one [[Formation (stratigraphy)|geologic formation]] or reservoir, hence it may be useful <!-- Source lost: and even a regulatory imposed requirement -->to divide the oil field and its well streams by formations or layers. More than one oil field may share infrastructure like oil processing units and pipelines. The field activities are regulated by a jurisdiction of a state and a contract of the licence. The contract is a business arrangement for exploration of the oil field between the licensor, (the [[mineral rights]] owner, onshore in United States often the land owner, elsewhere often the state possesses the ownership of mineral rights including petroleum reservoirs){{citeneeded|date=November 2019}} and a licensee to share investment costs, operational costs, and income from the oil field. In case of a [[production sharing agreement]], PSA, the licensee will take all development costs and have this capital recovered by \"cost oil\". \"Profit oil\" will be shared by licensee and the state.<ref name=\"Mazeel2010P18\"/> The licensee may be one oil company, or often a group of companies sharing the risks, costs and profit in a partnership, consortium or joint venture. When more than one company is involved, the term \"group ownership members\" is used, and the business arrangement for petroleum extraction specifies the equity of cost and income for each member company. Where a [[petroleum concessionary licence system]] is in use rather than [[petroleum contractual licence system|contractual type]] of [[petroleum fiscal regime]], ownership of extracted hydrocarbons are shared according to fixed equities of each member company.\n\n=== More specific definitions ===\n''Field allocation'' or ''platform allocation'' denotes allocation cases where contribution sources are more than one production field or more than one offshore platform, making a commingled flow into a pipeline.<ref name=hwang />\n\n''Well allocation'' is a term used in the case where the contribution sources are production petroleum wells, or any type of injection well.\n\n''Component allocation'': while the term ''product allocation'' is used to allocate the primary product groups like oil, gas or condensate ingredients (phase fractions) to a contributing well for instance,<ref name=\"sapprodalloc\"/> component allocation breaks down and allocate individual [[alkane]] hydrocarbons like [[methane]] and [[ethane]], to 3 isomers [[pentane]]s in a natural gas stream. [[Components of crude oil]] streams to be allocated may be split up by [[boiling point]] fractions.<ref name=\"ei29\"/>\n\nOther combinatorics on the allocation term include ''production allocation'',<ref name=\"elsinger\"/>\n''hydrocarbon allocation'',<ref name=\"engineerlive\"/> ''pipeline allocation'' and ''back allocation''.<ref name=hwang/><ref name=Lorentzen14Estimation/><ref name=Leskens08Downhole/> ''Export allocation'' denotes the allocation at a custody transfer where production quantities are transferred from an oil field. Allocation at exports decide exactly what quantities each partner of the contract is paid for.<ref name=\"ei13\"/> ''Ownership allocation'' is also used to denote the income distribution from extracted hydrocarbons on each partner of a licence or joint business arrangement area.\n\n=== Scope ===\nAllocation is an ongoing process based on flow or volume [[measurements]], and gives the distribution of contributing sources, often with a final calculation per day, which in turn provides the basis for a daily production report in the case of a field that produces hydrocarbons. Moreover, the allocation process may be designed to split up a flow of multiple products of the individual ingredients or phase fractions, for example when associated gas and water are supplied with a crude oil flow,<ref name=\"deloitteDef\"/> and each fraction within the commingled flow or storage is allocated between the contributors and its ownership.  A traditional allocation practice will execute quantity calculations for [[crude oil]], [[natural-gas condensate]] and [[produced water]] based on measured results from periodic, time-limited  [[Well test (oil and gas)|well tests]]. [[Natural gas]] flows from pure gas wells are usually measured continuously at or near the individual [[wellhead]]s.\n\nWithin the wider scope of hydrocarbon accounting; all measurements and parameters used for calculations are being deposited in a data storage, results of calculations along with methods used in calculations, are stored in a manner that is accepted by the internal and external audit. Stored results can be further utilised to optimise the reservoir performance of a producing field, possibly optimising the utilisation in case of a transportation system.\n\nThe hydrocarbon accounting process is emphasizing the tracking of all hydrocarbons through flows until a sale to a customer has occurred or hydrocarbons are disposed for including all fluid discharges, vents and [[Gas flare|flaring of gas]], consumption of gas for power production at the facility, and quantities of [[evaporation]] from oil storages. Similarly, measurements of injected flow of water and gas into the reservoir through injection wells are being part of hydrocarbon accounting.\n\n== Demand for allocation ==\nAllocation is commercial rooted in the need to distribute the costs, revenues and taxes among multiple players collaborating on field development and production of oil and gas. There are various incentives for collaboration, one is risk and cost sharing, the practice by issuing licenses for exploration and production to a partnership of oil companies. Another is the aim of improving production efficiency,  by extracting from multiple [[Land (economics)|land properties]] or multiple oil fields by shared arrangement for production, also called unitisation.\n\nProduction allocation to wellbore or completion is required for Reservoir Simulation where the dynamic geological model is history matched and used for production forecasting.\n\n=== History ===\nThe principle of unitised production, to allow for more efficient development of new exploration areas, was established for the Van field in the [[State of Texas]], US, since 1929,<ref name=\"vanfield\"/><ref name=\"Warner2007\"/> and this practice has been developed to a widespread \"hidden law of unitisation\" in Texas.<ref name=\"eubanks\"/> Even before 1929, it was early established a practice of sharing equipment to extract from several wells.<ref name=\"johnson\"/> Today, most US states except Texas, have compulsory unitization statutes. Ownership and extraction of oil and gas in the ground of USA is regulated by the present [[oil and gas law in the United States]].\n\nSharing risks by a joint venture of several companies to field development, production and transportation, and [[Downstream (petroleum industry)|downstream]] activities has also been going on for long time, specifically for cross border arrangements.<ref name=\"oilgovern146\"/> In the [[North Sea]], oil companies shared risk in consortia, and in the initial licence round regulated by Norwegian government, more than half of the licences were awarded partnerships of several licensees.<ref name=\"oilgovern151\"/> It has also been a clear tendency towards transition to awarding licences to partnerships.\n\nIn recent times, cost savings have become an impetus for shared utilisation of infrastructures for processing and transport of oil and gas in areas of extraction from the ground. Methods are being developed to allocate back contributions into commingled streams in pipeline, when oil is being transported from a collection of offshore oil fields to facilities terminals onshore in Asia.<ref name=hwang/>\n\nRecent restructuring in this industry for [[enhanced oil recovery]], deepwater field development, and use of subsea production systems that commingled production flows from multiple oil fields,<ref name=\"Parshall\"/> strengthen the requirements for flexible and accurate allocation systems, to keep up with the transition from conventional [[Well test (oil and gas)|well flow testing]] to prevalence of model simulations, virtual flow meters and multiphase flow meters.<ref name=\"gjesdal\"/>\n\n=== Benefits ===\nThere are multiple operational benefits from allocation.  Detailed results from allocation to wells, or even to oil or gas layers per well, are used to manage the production process.\n\nResults from the allocation process are important feed into production reporting to governments and partners, and allocation results may also feed operator's internal systems for product sales, [[Accounting system|accounting]], [[enterprise resource planning]], [[data warehouse]], and [[management information systems|management information]]. Allocation and hydrocarbon accounting are supporting information to the wider business area ''petroleum accounting'', the latter considering life cycle business and financial aspects of oil field operations.<ref name=\"WrigthGallun2005\"/>\n\n== Allocation practices and methods ==\nTransparency, fairness and compliance with audit requirements are fundamental criteria for the design of allocation practices and methods. Furthermore, the implemented processes should be cost efficient as well as practical to operate. Requirements for the measurement processes and the associated allocation process are set by legislation and the relevant government authority, contract documents governing the relationship between the operator, partners, licensor, and government may also provide guidelines for allocation. Details of design configuration and setup can be read out of available [[piping and instrumentation diagram]]s, [[process flow diagram]]s and other documentation showing [[flow measurement]] and connections between measuring points via flow from wells to sale points. P&ID showing downhole sensors may also contribute to the design of an allocation process.\n\nPartners involved in any allocation system, agree upon and establish a set of principles to follow. <!--Important elements are inclusion of all kind of stocks in the allocation system, such that materials held in pipelines, process equipment, and intermediate storages, are accounted for.--> The principles states the units and measurement types used in allocations, i.e. where to account mass, volume, molar or energy balance. Since physical properties of hydrocarbons are constantly changing when hydrocarbons from various contributing sources are mixed, affected by [[heat transfer]] and transitions in pressure and temperature, owners of hydrocarbon in a commingled material cannot be allocated materials equal to what physically delivered from their well. For instance, two multiphase streams are commingled, one with oil of mole weight 107 and gas of 20&nbsp;kg/kgmol, the other of 116 and 21 respectively, may result in a commingled stream of 115&nbsp;kg/kgmol for the oil and mole weight of 20.3&nbsp;kg/kgmol for the gas. The allocation principles account for this effect.<ref name=\"EIGuide\"/>\n\n=== Sample configurations ===\n[[File:Oil field flow metering.svg|right|350px|thumb|'''Figure 1:''' Illustration of meter setup in allocation problems, simplified for clarity. A host field \"A\" processing plant separates, processes and exports hydrocarbon flows from field \"A\", and two satellite fields \"B\" and \"C\".<br/ > Legend: Red M is custody transfer meter, black M fiscal meter, gray M indicate optional allocation meter.<ref name=\"ercb\"/>]]\nAllocation systems seen in the figure to the right:\n* Fields \"B\" and \"C\" are each a basic allocation system where all the measured out-flow quantities from the field are allocated to the respective wells, and allocation can be conducted on all phases, oil, gas, water. (\"B\" and \"C\" have possible subsea plants only.)\n* Field \"A\", an oil field where fluid of oil, produced water and associated gas is extracted. If free of pipeline connection, field \"A\" illustrates the typical allocation case. A processing plant splits crude oil into three fractions. Metering stations on the export point satisfy requirements for [[custody transfer]], measuring instrument for flare gas is a fiscal measurement if subject to taxation, it depends on regulatory requirements. Measurement of well streams will typically have lower accuracy, or no meters are installed, when estimation processes are in use.\n* All together, the collection of fields is a field allocation system in which contributions in sales products are allocated to each of the three fields.\n\n=== Measurements ===\nNot all streams and measurements at a production plant will feed an allocation process, but all allocations need at least measurement of the total out-flow or total volume, along with measurements, or estimates for, or some physical properties of the contributing flows included in the total.\n\nFiscal measurements meet the statutory requirements for accuracy in the jurisdiction for tax payments to the government; custody transfer measurements meet the requirements for financial transactions between buyers and sellers of hydrocarbons; allocation measurements helps support the allocation of all contributors to a commingled flow, whereby it also supports ownership allocation. Allocation measurements may not meet custody transfer standards.\n\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\"\n|+ Flow measurement and allocation\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Flow location'''\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Measurement type'''\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Allocation'''\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| Flow to an export transportation system, (pipeline, tanker, truck)  ||Fiscal measurement and <br />Custody transfer measurement||Back allocation to field or well, ownership allocation\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| Flow into and out of an intermediate fluid storage||Custody transfer measurement||Back allocation to field or well\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| Flow to consumption, power, flare||Fiscal measurement||N/A\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| Flow to shared facility, from a satellite field||Custody transfer measurement (when ownership changes)||Field allocation\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| Flow from the reservoir||Allocation measurement||Back allocation to well or formation\n|-\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| Flow from a gas well||E.g. with ultrasonic flow meter|| \n|-\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| Flow from an oil well||Well test or with multiphase meter for instance|| \n|-\n| style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"| Various flows within the processing facility||Meters with sufficient accuracies|| \n|-\n| colspan=\"3\"  align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"|'''Table 1:''' A selection of places where flows are measured.

Available meters in the market are characterized by properties such as accuracy, operational rangebility: flowrate, viscosity, velocity, pressure and temperature conditions, durability and demand with respect to calibration and monitoring, the ability to withstand contaminants, injected chemicals, salty and acidic environment. For the application of custody transfer measurements of fluid hydrocarbons, [[positive displacement meters]] and [[turbine meters]] have been preferred.<ref name=\"suri\"/>  For gas metering, [[Gas meter#Orifice meters|gas orifice meters]] and [[ultrasonic flow meters]] are most common.<ref name=\"O&GHB\"/> [[Gas meter#Coriolis meters|Coriolis meters]] are in use for liquid measurements, but can also take gas measurement applications.<ref name=\"Yoder\"/>\n\nFor the application of allocation measurements, [[multiphase flow meter]]s have been adopted, especially for subsea production systems. These equipments are able to deduce the proportion and flow rate of each fluid phase.\n\n=== Estimates, alternatives for measures ===\nIn some locations it is too costly or not practical to implement metering of flow rates, e.g. down in the wells and in many places at process plants, especially on subsea plants. However, a set of methods and techniques that aim to provide estimates for flows, are adopted by the industry to solve allocation problems.\n\n;Geochemical allocation\n[[Gas chromatography]] and [[isotope analysis]] <!-- and [[Isotope geochemistry]] ? -->are the known methods that are used for determining the characteristics of hydrocarbon material samples.<ref name=\"bazan\"/> The method is also named ''oil fingerprinting'', and uses data about the chemical and isotope composition of liquid and gas flow for each contribution that is collected. Samples from each contributing stream is parsed, and fingerprints established, for example by using whole-oil gas chromatography methods. These fingerprints are then recognized in aggregate flows, which in turn can help to allocate back to the sources.\n\nApplications of this method comprise allocation of single [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] or layer in a commingled well,<ref name=\"Mccaffrey\"/> and allocation of commingled pipeline oil to contributing oil fields.<ref name=\"hwang\"/><ref name=\"elsinger\"/> Moreover, the adoption of fingerprinting is widely spread geographically, it includes North America and the Middle East.<ref name=\"Nouvelle\"/>\n\n;Flow rate estimation\nThere are varieties of methods for estimating the flow rate of the wells when flow measurements are unavailable. Models describe multiphase flows behaviour under different conditions, and they are continuously being supplied with readings from pressure, temperature, and pressure drop across the [[venturi effect|venturi]] and density, and other properties.<ref name=\"cramer2009\"/> [[Numerical weather prediction#Ensembles|Ensemble]] based [[data assimilation]] methods are among available techniques for back allocation to reservoir formations.<ref name=Lorentzen14Estimation/><ref name=Leskens08Downhole/>\n\nA ''virtual flow meter'' is a type of an implementation using such methods. Some gas and condensate fields in the [[North Sea]] are developed with subsea templates where [[multiphase flow meter]]s are installed for each well and virtual flow meters for each well are taken in use as a backup for and redundancy to the flow meters.<ref name=\"larsen\"/><ref name=\"Angelo\"/>\n\n''Process models and phase behaviour models'' are other implementations of rate estimation. With the aid of commercially available software, process models simulate the behaviour of hydrocarbons in the processing plant. Among other purposes it is used for calculation of shrinkage factors or expansion factors and estimation of flow inside the plant that does not have meters. The models build on the theory of [[thermodynamic]]s to predict the behaviour of components in the streams. Examples of [[equations of state]] that contribute to the calculations in such models are [[Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state]] and/or \n[[Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong]]. Process models with simulations are in use in allocation systems at North Sea plants.<ref name=\"Stockton\"/>\n\n=== Uncertainty in measures and allocation ===\nIn the oil and gas industry, it is common that the regulatory authorities in the country set requirements for all measurements of produced hydrocarbons, where such measurements affect taxes or royalties to the government, the fiscal measurements. Requirements can be found in a guideline and be specific in the way uncertainties are targeted. Examples of targets in publicly available standards and guidelines are:\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ Flow measurement and target uncertainties\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|&nbsp;\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Newfoundland,<br/>Labrador,<br/>Nova Scotia<ref name=\"cnlopb\"/>\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|United<br/>Kingdom<ref name=\"DECCMeter\"/>\n| align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Norway<ref name=\"npdreg\"/>\n|-\n|  style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Liquid volume||\u00b10.25%||\u00b10.25%||\u00b10.3%\n|-\n|  style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Gas mass||\u00b11%||\u00b11%||\u00b11%\n|}\n\nFor oil and gas well allocation, Newfoundland and Labrador and Nova Scotia Offshore Areas, Drilling and Production Regulations,<ref name=\"cnlopb\"/> for example, requires accuracy within \u00b15%.\n\nIn general, the total uncertainty of the allocation system is related to [[measurement uncertainty]] of each measured input. Investments in improved metering systems and operations to reduce the uncertainty may be subject to cost benefit analysis that points to an optimum, overall uncertainty in the allocated products.<ref name=\"ei13\"/>\n\n=== Proportional allocation ===\n[[File:Well test separator.svg|thumb|right|400px|'''Figure 2:''' Periodic [[Well test (oil and gas)|well tests]] on the production plant is the conventional way to get an estimated or theoretical production contribution per phase fraction per well per month. This plant is receiving a multi phased flow of oil and gas from many wells via a manifold. Flow from one well at a time is taken to the test separator (shaded). The output flow rates are measured for each phase fraction.]]\n\nIt is easy to implement measures of flow rates of commingled, single phase hydrocarbon flows under normal pressure and temperature, but often not feasible to measure the individual well flow rate of multiphase streams from oil wells, under high temperature and pressure, while achieving known and acceptable uncertainty in the measurements. A practical adaptation to this problem is to estimate or otherwise prepare theoretical estimates of the flow rate from the individual wells, and somehow normalise the estimates to even out discrepancies with the measured overall product stream from a production facility.\n\nThe conventional approach of estimating individual flow performance from contributing oil wells in the allocation problem is the [[Well test (oil and gas)#Flow test|well test]] practice using test [[Separator (oil production)|separator]].<ref name=\"cramer2009\"/>\n\n;Proportional allocation calculation\nThis is generally the most intuitive procedure, allocating a stream to the contributing stream sources in proportions according to a known quantity.<ref name=\"ei38\"/>\n\n:<math> Q_k = C_k{Q_T\\over\\sum_{k=1}^N C_k} </math> \nwhere\n:N is the number of contributing sources, for example number of wells\n:<math>Q_T</math> is the total quantity in stream to be allocated \n:<math>C_k</math> is a measured or estimated quantity portion of contributor k, for example from a [[Well test (oil and gas)#Flow test|flow test]]\n:<math>Q_k</math> is the portion of the total allocated to contributor k\n\nThe quantity Q could be mass or energy as well as volume. The allocation calculations are carried out per phase, for example oil, gas and water respectively.\n\n;Example with calculations to illustrate the principle of proportional allocation\nAssume that the flows of separated oil from two production units go to a common storage tank. The tank is used as a cache so that the owners of the oil can get their load according to an [[entitlement]] plan. Allocation is first calculated using estimated production from each well, based on well testing.\n\nThe results of a [[Well test (oil and gas)#Flow test|well test]] in May are shown in the column \"Theoretical production\" below. Suppose it was measured in 610,000 barrels (corrected, measured total) of oil produced by end of May 2013.\n\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: right;\"\n|+ An example of monthly production allocation via theoretical oil production from well test\n| align=\"left\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Plant /<br>platform'''\n| align=\"right\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Well'''\n| align=\"right\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Hours<br>contributing'''\n| align=\"right\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Hours<br>on test'''\n| align=\"right\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Test<br>results'''\n| align=\"right\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Calculation'''\n| align=\"right\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Theoretical<br>production'''\n| align=\"right\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Calculation'''\n| align=\"right\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|'''Well<br>allocation'''\n|-\n| align=\"left\"|\"Skink\"||S-1||672||24||5000||5000*672/24||140,000||140000*610000/615800|| 138,681 \n|-\n| ||S-2||672||24||4000||4000*672/24||112,000||112000*610000/615800|| 110,945 \n|-\n| ||S-5||672||24||4500||4500*672/24||126,000||126000*610000/615800|| 124,813 \n|-\n| ||||||||||||||Plant total|| 374,440 \n|-\n| align=\"left\"|\"Gecko\"||G-2||696||12||2500||2500*696/12||145,000||145000*610000/615800|| 143,634 \n|-\n| ||G-3||696||12||1000||1000*696/12||58,000||58000*610000/615800|| 57,454 \n|-\n| ||G-5||696||24||1200||1200*696/24||34,800||34800*610000/615800|| 34,472 \n|-\n| ||||||||||||||Plant total|| 235,560 \n|-\n| colspan=\"6\"  align=\"left\"|Theoretical tank total||615,800||||\n|-\n| colspan=\"8\"  align=\"left\"|Corrected, measured total (Net quantity)|| 610,000\n|-\n| colspan=\"9\"  align=\"left\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\"|'''Table 2:''' The example shows the final allocation by month end. <br />It distributes the total measured oil, 610,000 bbl to each well, at the proportion of estimates given by the well test results. <br />\nThe case is simplified for illustration purposes.<ref name=\"WrightGallun2005P237\"/>\n|}\n\n;Field factor\n:<math> FF = {Q_n\\over\\sum_{k=1}^N TH_k} </math>&nbsp;&nbsp;where&nbsp;&nbsp;<math> TH_k </math> is the theoretical (estimated) production for well k;&nbsp;&nbsp;N is the number of wells;&nbsp;&nbsp;<math> Q_n </math> is the net quantity, the measured and corrected total\n\nIn table 2, the field factor is 610,000 over 615,800, equal to 0.99058.\n\n;Corrected well allocation\nThe effect of field factor is to distribute the difference between fiscal measured total and theoretical total, 5,800 bbl, evenly at the same proportion across all wells.<ref name=\"Lorentzen\"/>\n:<math> WA_k = TH_k * FF </math>\n\n=== Probabilistic allocation ===\nProbabilistic rate allocation fully exploits the available measurement configuration and knowledge about measurement noise characteristics to achieve a more accurate allocation as well as uncertainty quantification.<ref name=\"tewari2018\"/> This is particularly beneficial for allocation accuracy when additional per-well measurements are available, such as the fluid rate per well derived from a rod pump [https://production-technology.org/sucker-rod-pumping-system/ dynamometer card], or (manual) measurements of the per-well water fraction. This method combines measurements taken at different times using a probabilistic dynamic model for the production type curve.\n\n=== Ownership allocation ===\nWhen a fluid stream is owned by a compound ownership, each owner's equity is allocated in accordance with their share. For joint venture contractual arrangement with fixed equities, allocation is in the proportion of their share of ownership.<ref name=\"ei34\"/> [[Production sharing agreements]] may lead to further splits into cost oil and profit oil categories.\n\n;Example of equity-based allocation with calculations\nThree companies A, B, and C cooperate in a joint venture contractual arrangement with fixed equity shares.

They are generally referred to as [[disinfection by-product]]s. They result from the reaction of chlorine or bromine with [[organic matter]] present in the water being treated. The THMs produced have been associated through epidemiological studies with some adverse health effects. Many governments set limits on the amount permissible in drinking water. However, trihalomethanes are only one group of many hundreds of possible disinfection by-products&mdash;the vast majority of which are not monitored&mdash;and it has not yet been clearly demonstrated which of these are the most plausible candidate for causation of these health effects. In the [[United States]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] limits the total concentration of the four chief constituents  ([[chloroform]], [[bromoform]], [[bromodichloromethane]], and [[dibromochloromethane]]), referred to as total trihalomethanes (TTHM), to 80 [[parts per billion]] in treated water. <ref>{{cite journal |last1=Durmishi |first1=Bujar H. |last2=Reka |first2=Arianit A. |last3=Hellon |first3=Teuta Gjuladin- |last4=Ismaili |first4=Murtezan |last5=Srbinovski |first5=Mile |last6=Shabani |first6=Agim |title=Disinfection of Drinking Water and Trihalomethanes: A Review |journal=International Journal of Advanced Research in Chemical Science |date=2015 |volume=2 |issue=11 |pages=45\u201356 |url=https://www.arcjournals.org/international-journal-of-advanced-research-in-chemical-science/volume-2-issue-11/9 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nTraces of [[chloroform]] is also formed in [[swimming pools]] that are disinfected with [[chlorine]] or [[hypochlorite]] in the [[haloform reaction]] with organic substances (e.g. [[urine]], [[sweat]], [[hair]] and [[skin]] particles). Although it is possible to inhale THMs, the U.S. EPA has determined that this exposure is minimal compared to that from consumption. In swimmers, uptake of THMs is greatest via the skin with dermal absorption accounting for 80% of THM uptake.<ref name=\"Lindstrom1997\">{{cite journal|last=Lindstrom|first=A B|last2=Pleil|first2=J.D.|last3=Berkoff|first3=D.C.|year=1997|title=Alveolar breath sampling and analysis to assess trihalomethane exposures during competitive swimming training|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=105|issue=6|pages=636\u2013642|issn=0091-6765|doi=10.1289/ehp.97105636|pmid=9288498|pmc=1470079}}</ref> Exercising in a chlorinated pool increases the toxicity of a \"safe\" chlorinated pool atmosphere<ref name=\"Drobnic1996\">{{cite journal|last=Drobnic|first=Franchek|last2=Freixa|first2=Assumpci??|last3=Casan|first3=Pere|last4=Sanchis|first4=Joaqu??N|last5=Guardino|first5=Xavier|year=1996|title=Assessment of chlorine exposure in swimmers during training|journal=Medicine &amp Science in Sports &amp Exercise|volume=28|issue=2|pages=271\u2013274|issn=0195-9131|doi=10.1097/00005768-199602000-00018}}</ref> with toxic effects of chlorine byproducts greater in young swimmers than older swimmers.<ref name=\"Aiking1994\">{{cite journal|last=Aiking|first=Harry|last2= van Ackert|first2=Manila B.|last3=Sch\u00f6lten|first3=Rob J.P.M.|last4=Feenstra|first4= Jan F.|last5=Valkenburg|first5= Hans A.|year=1994|title=Swimming pool chlorination: a health hazard?|journal=[[Toxicology Letters]]|volume=72|issue=1\u20133|pages=375\u2013380|issn=0378-4274|doi=10.1016/0378-4274(94)90051-5|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222136311}}</ref>\nStudies in adolescents have shown an inverse relationship between serum testosterone levels and the amount of time spent in public pools.

They are generally referred to as [[disinfection by-product]]s. They result from the reaction of chlorine or bromine with [[organic matter]] present in the water being treated. The THMs produced have been associated through epidemiological studies with some adverse health effects. Many governments set limits on the amount permissible in drinking water. However, trihalomethanes are only one group of many hundreds of possible disinfection by-products&mdash;the vast majority of which are not monitored&mdash;and it has not yet been clearly demonstrated which of these are the most plausible candidate for causation of these health effects. In the [[United States]], the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] limits the total concentration of the four chief constituents  ([[chloroform]], [[bromoform]], [[bromodichloromethane]], and [[dibromochloromethane]]), referred to as total trihalomethanes (TTHM), to 80 [[parts per billion]] in treated water.\n\nTraces of [[chloroform]] is also formed in [[swimming pools]] that are disinfected with [[chlorine]] or [[hypochlorite]] in the [[haloform reaction]] with organic substances (e.g. [[urine]], [[sweat]], [[hair]] and [[skin]] particles). Although it is possible to inhale THMs, the U.S. EPA has determined that this exposure is minimal compared to that from consumption. In swimmers, uptake of THMs is greatest via the skin with dermal absorption accounting for 80% of THM uptake.<ref name=\"Lindstrom1997\">{{cite journal|last=Lindstrom|first=A B|last2=Pleil|first2=J.D.|last3=Berkoff|first3=D.C.|year=1997|title=Alveolar breath sampling and analysis to assess trihalomethane exposures during competitive swimming training|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=105|issue=6|pages=636\u2013642|issn=0091-6765|doi=10.1289/ehp.97105636|pmid=9288498|pmc=1470079}}</ref> Exercising in a chlorinated pool increases the toxicity of a \"safe\" chlorinated pool atmosphere<ref name=\"Drobnic1996\">{{cite journal|last=Drobnic|first=Franchek|last2=Freixa|first2=Assumpci??|last3=Casan|first3=Pere|last4=Sanchis|first4=Joaqu??N|last5=Guardino|first5=Xavier|year=1996|title=Assessment of chlorine exposure in swimmers during training|journal=Medicine &amp Science in Sports &amp Exercise|volume=28|issue=2|pages=271\u2013274|issn=0195-9131|doi=10.1097/00005768-199602000-00018}}</ref> with toxic effects of chlorine byproducts greater in young swimmers than older swimmers.<ref name=\"Aiking1994\">{{cite journal|last=Aiking|first=Harry|last2= van Ackert|first2=Manila B.|last3=Sch\u00f6lten|first3=Rob J.P.M.|last4=Feenstra|first4= Jan F.|last5=Valkenburg|first5= Hans A.|year=1994|title=Swimming pool chlorination: a health hazard?|journal=[[Toxicology Letters]]|volume=72|issue=1\u20133|pages=375\u2013380|issn=0378-4274|doi=10.1016/0378-4274(94)90051-5|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222136311}}</ref>\nStudies in adolescents have shown an inverse relationship between serum testosterone levels and the amount of time spent in public pools.

It is owned by WestJet Airlines, Ltd. which also is the holding company for [[WestJet Airlines]]. The airline is headquartered in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]]. In response to internal market studies about future growth limitations by WestJet Airlines operating only [[Boeing 737]] aircraft, WestJet Encore was formed to allow increased frequency of flights by using smaller aircraft, as well as to expand service to routes with less traffic.\n\nThe airline operates [[Bombardier Q400]] NextGen aircraft, a variant of the Bombardier Dash 8. The airline is the fourth largest operator of the [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] Q400 series. Pilot bases are in Calgary and [[Toronto]], where many WestJet Encore flights operate. Air service originally started in Western Canada, but routes in the eastern half of the country were added later.\n\nThe airline is a [[low-cost carrier]]. It was initially staffed with non-union employees but the pilots have since unionized. Food is available for purchase. WestJet Encore participates in the WestJet Rewards, a revenue-based frequent flyer program that offers flight discount rewards.\n\n==History==\n===Market conditions leading to the formation of WestJet Encore (2005\u20132013)===\n\nPrior to the formation of WestJet Encore, WestJet Airlines, Inc. internal studies concluded in 2005, when the company had 50 [[Boeing 737]] aircraft, that WestJet would saturate the Canadian commercial airline market when it reached a 90\u2013100 Boeing 737 aircraft fleet. WestJet Airlines had become the second largest airline in Canada in 2002.<ref name=\"2nd largest airline in Canada\">{{cite book|last1=DeWil|first1=Bob|last2=Meyer|first2=Ron|title=Strategy: Process, Content, Context|publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA|isbn=1408019027|page=439}}</ref> Solutions included slowing expansion of the airline or adding smaller aircraft models to serve routes with less traffic. The absence of [[turboprop]] aircraft in the WestJet fleet was seen as a disadvantage compared to competitor [[Air Canada]]. In some cases where Air Canada had smaller aircraft, WestJet either avoided the market or had only one daily flight using a Boeing 737, an aircraft much larger than the ones Air Canada used.<ref name=\"AviationWeekSumers\">{{cite news|last1=Sumers|first1=Brian|title=WestJet Airlines Looks to Expand into Long-Haul|url=http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/westjet-airlines-looks-expand-long-haul|accessdate=18 March 2018|work=Aviation Week and Space Technology}}</ref> Having more flights on a route than a competitor is a competitive advantage.<ref name=\"more flights is an advantage\">{{cite book|last1=Wensveen|first1=John|title=Air Transportation: A Management Advantage|date=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=1409486826|page=204}}</ref><ref name=\"Global Airline Industry\">{{cite book|last1=Belobaba|first1=Peter|last2=Odoni|first2=Amedeo|last3=Barnhart|first3=Cynthia|title=The Global Airline Industry|date=April 1, 2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=0470744723|page=174|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRtDl0CJpQIC|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Westjet Encore Dash-8 Q400.jpg|thumb|alt=WestJet Encore Q400 aircraft with propellers taxiing at an airport|WestJet Encore Bombardier Q400 NextGen displaying 2013\u20132015 livery]]\nWestJet made an initial order of 20 Bombardier Dash 8-Q400 NextGen (Q400 NextGen) aircraft through a letter of intent on May 1, 2012, which resulted in a conditional order on June 28, 2012.

It is owned by WestJet Airlines, Ltd. which also is the holding company for [[WestJet Airlines]]. The airline is headquartered in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]]. In response to internal market studies about future growth limitations by WestJet Airlines operating only [[Boeing 737]] aircraft, WestJet Encore was formed to allow increased frequency of flights by using smaller aircraft, as well as to expand service to routes with less traffic.\n\nThe airline operates [[Bombardier Q400]] NextGen aircraft, a variant of the Bombardier Dash 8. The airline is the fourth largest operator of the [[Bombardier Aerospace|Bombardier]] Q400 series. Pilot bases are in Calgary and [[Toronto]], where many WestJet Encore flights operate. Air service originally started in Western Canada, but routes in the eastern half of the country were added later.\n\nThe airline is a [[low-cost carrier]]. It was initially staffed with non-union employees but the pilots have since unionized. Food is available for purchase. WestJet Encore participates in the WestJet Rewards, a revenue-based frequent flyer program that offers flight discount rewards.\n\n==History==\n===Market conditions leading to the formation of WestJet Encore (2005\u20132013)===\n\nPrior to the formation of WestJet Encore, WestJet Airlines, Inc. internal studies concluded in 2005, when the company had 50 [[Boeing 737]] aircraft, that WestJet would saturate the Canadian commercial airline market when it reached a 90\u2013100 Boeing 737 aircraft fleet. WestJet Airlines had become the second largest airline in Canada in 2002.<ref name=\"2nd largest airline in Canada\">{{cite book|last1=DeWil|first1=Bob|last2=Meyer|first2=Ron|title=Strategy: Process, Content, Context|publisher=Cengage Learning EMEA|isbn=1408019027|page=439}}</ref> Solutions included slowing expansion of the airline or adding smaller aircraft models to serve routes with less traffic. The absence of [[turboprop]] aircraft in the WestJet fleet was seen as a disadvantage compared to competitor [[Air Canada]]. In some cases where Air Canada had smaller aircraft, WestJet either avoided the market or had only one daily flight using a Boeing 737, an aircraft much larger than the ones Air Canada used.<ref name=\"AviationWeekSumers\">{{cite news|last1=Sumers|first1=Brian|title=WestJet Airlines Looks to Expand into Long-Haul|url=http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/westjet-airlines-looks-expand-long-haul|accessdate=18 March 2018|work=Aviation Week and Space Technology}}</ref> Having more flights on a route than a competitor is a competitive advantage.<ref name=\"more flights is an advantage\">{{cite book|last1=Wensveen|first1=John|title=Air Transportation: A Management Advantage|date=2012|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=1409486826|page=204}}</ref><ref name=\"Global Airline Industry\">{{cite book|last1=Belobaba|first1=Peter|last2=Odoni|first2=Amedeo|last3=Barnhart|first3=Cynthia|title=The Global Airline Industry|date=April 1, 2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=0470744723|page=174|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRtDl0CJpQIC|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Westjet Encore Dash-8 Q400.jpg|thumb|alt=WestJet Encore Q400 aircraft with propellers taxing at an airport|WestJet Encore Bombardier Q400 NextGen displaying 2013\u20132015 livery]]\nWestJet made an initial order of 20 Bombardier Dash 8-Q400 NextGen (Q400 NextGen) aircraft through a letter of intent on May 1, 2012, which resulted in a conditional order on June 28, 2012.
