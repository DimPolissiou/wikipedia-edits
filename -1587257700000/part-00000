The denomination maintains headquarters in [[Valley Forge, Pennsylvania|Valley Forge]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The organization is usually considered [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainline]], although varying theological and mission emphases may be found among its congregations, including modernist, [[Charismatic Movement|charismatic]] and [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] orientations.<ref>{{Citation | title = The Baptist Heritage | first = H Leon | last = McBeth | publisher = Broadman | year = 1987 | pages = 596\u2013608}}.</ref> It traces its history to the [[First Baptist Church in America]] (1638) and the Baptist congregational associations which organized the [[Triennial Convention]] in 1814. From 1907 to 1950, it was known as the '''Northern Baptist Convention,''' and from 1950 to 1972 as the '''American Baptist Convention'''.\n\nIn 2017, ABCUSA had 1,145,647 members in 5,057 congregations.<ref name=\"stats\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Colonial New England Baptists===\nThe [[Puritan]] minister [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] (''c.'' 1603\u20131683) established the First Baptist Church in Providence \u2014 now the [[First Baptist Church in America]] \u2014 in 1638. Regarded by the more dogmatic Puritans of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] as a [[heresy|heretic]] for his [[English Dissenters|religious separatism]], Williams was banished into the [[New England]] wilderness where he and his followers created the settlement of [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] and later, the colony of [[Rhode Island]].  Williams is credited with being the founder of the Baptist movement in America, the founder of the state of Rhode Island, and the first highly visible public leader in America to call for the [[separation of church and state]].\n\n[[Image:First Baptist Meetinghouse, Providence, RI.jpg|left|150px|thumb|The [[First Baptist Church in America]] was formed in 1638 in [[Providence, R.I.]]]]\n\n===Triennial Convention===\nHaving a [[congregational polity]], early Baptist churches in America operated independently from one another, following an array of [[Protestant]] theological paths, but were often unified in their mission to evangelize.  In the 18th century, they sometimes created local congregational associations for support, fellowship, and work (such as the founding of [[Brown University]] in 1764). The evangelical mission led to the establishment of the national [[Triennial Convention]] in 1814, a collaborative effort by local churches to organize, fund, and deploy missionaries.  The ABCUSA descends from this Triennial Convention. Through the Triennial Convention structure a number of mission-oriented societies were formed, including the [[American Baptist Missionary Union|American Baptist Foreign Mission Society]] (1814), [[American Baptist Home Mission Society]] (1832), American Baptist Publication Society (1841), and the American Baptist Education Society (1888).\n\nIn 1845, a majority of Baptists in the [[Southern U.S.|South]] withdrew support from the Triennial Convention \u2013 largely in response to the decision of its delegates to ban slave holders from becoming ordained missionaries \u2013 and formed the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] (SBC).  The Triennial Convention was loosely structured, and the SBC offered Baptists a more centralized organizational structure for carrying on missionary and benevolent work.  In contrast, however, the Triennial Convention afforded local churches a higher degree of local autonomy, a more traditional characteristic of Baptist polity.  The majority of churches in the North continued to work through these separate cooperating societies for missions and benevolence.  The societies were united under the umbrella of a unified convention in 1907.\n\n===Northern Baptist Convention===\nThe ''Northern Baptist Convention'' was founded in Washington, D.C. on May 17, 1907. [[Charles Evans Hughes]], then [[Governor of New York]] and later [[Chief Justice of the United States]], served the body as its first president. The purpose of the Northern Baptist Convention was to bring about a consistent cooperation among the separate Baptist bodies then existing.  It was the first step in bringing together Baptists in the North \"with ties to the historic American Baptist mission societies in the nineteenth century.\"<ref name = Martin>{{Citation | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NXG/is_1_34/ai_94160904/ | first = Dana | last = Martin | contribution = The American Baptist Convention and the Civil Rights Movement: Rhetoric and Response | title = Baptist History and Heritage |date=Winter 1999}}.</ref> These had contributed to establishing many schools for [[freedmen]] in the South after the [[American Civil War]], as well as working on issues of health and welfare. Many of their missionaries and members had worked as teachers in the South.  In 1911, most of the churches of the [[Free Will Baptist Church|Free Will Baptist General Conference]] merged with it.\n\n===American Baptist Convention===\n[[File:Riverside Church 05.JPG|thumb|right|195px|Historic [[Riverside Church]] (1930) in [[Upper Manhattan]] retains its association with ABCUSA.]]\nThe name of the Convention was changed in 1950 to the ''American Baptist Convention'' (ABC), and it operated under this name until 1972.  It was the second step at bringing together on a national level Baptists with ties to the mission societies.  The ABC was characterized from 1950\u201366 with annual resolutions at its conventions having to do with the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and race relations.\n{{Quote | Without exception, these resolutions were progressive and genuinely encompassing. They addressed both the need for individual change in attitude and action, and the need for broader social change that could only be instituted through political action.<ref name=Martin />}}\n\nAs in many cases, the rhetoric of the annual conventions was sometimes ahead of local activity, but the denomination gradually made progress. In 1964, it created the Baptist Action for Racial Brotherhood (BARB), which early the next year produced a pamphlet outlining actions for change in local churches. In 1968, the national convention was challenged by \"Black American Baptist Churchmen Speak To the American Baptist Convention,\" demands that challenged how the denomination had \"conducted its business relative to black American Baptists.\"<ref name = Martin /> The black churchmen said the Convention had excluded them from decisionmaking positions, even while working with good intentions on behalf of black American Baptists. The following year, Dr. Thomas Kilgore Jr., pastor of the Second Baptist Church of Los Angeles, was elected the first black president of the Convention. The 1968 Convention also voted to create the Study Commission on Denominational Structure (SCODS). Its recommendations changed the denomination in a variety of ways, after being adopted at the 1972 Convention.<ref name =Martin />\n\n===American Baptist Churches USA===\nTo reflect its new structure, the Convention in 1972 changed its name to the American Baptist Churches USA.  Rather than relying on decisionmaking at the annual Convention by whichever churches happened to send delegates, the SCODS restructuring resulted in the following:\n{{Quote | A General Board was composed of duly elected representatives from geographically designated districts. Three-fourths of those representatives would be elected by the American Baptist regional bodies; one-fourth would be elected as at-large representatives, or in the official terminology, \"Nationally Nominated Representatives.\" These representatives would be \"chosen so as to provide the necessary balance among the Representatives in respect of racial/ethnic inclusiveness, geographic area, age, gender, and desirable skills.<ref name=Martin />}}\n\nIn 2006, the American Baptist Churches of the Pacific Southwest, believing that \"the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching,\" split from the ABCUSA.

From 1907 to 1950, it was known as the '''Northern Baptist Convention,''' and from 1950 to 1972 as the '''American Baptist Convention'''.\n\nIn 2017, ABCUSA had 1,145,647 members in 5,057 congregations.<ref name=\"stats\"/>\n\n==History==\n===Colonial New England Baptists===\nThe [[Puritan]] minister [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] (''c.'' 1603\u20131683) established the First Baptist Church in Providence \u2014 now the [[First Baptist Church in America]] \u2014 in 1638. Regarded by the more dogmatic Puritans of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] as a [[heresy|heretic]] for his [[English Dissenters|religious separatism]], Williams was banished into the [[New England]] wilderness where he and his followers created the settlement of [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] and later, the colony of [[Rhode Island]].  Williams is credited with being the founder of the Baptist movement in America, the founder of the state of Rhode Island, and the first highly visible public leader in America to call for the [[separation of church and state]].\n\n[[Image:First Baptist Meetinghouse, Providence, RI.jpg|left|150px|thumb|The [[First Baptist Church in America]] was formed in 1638 in [[Providence, R.I.]]]]\n\n===Triennial Convention===\nHaving a [[congregational polity]], early Baptist churches in America operated independently from one another, following an array of [[Protestant]] theological paths, but were often unified in their mission to evangelize.  In the 18th century, they sometimes created local congregational associations for support, fellowship, and work (such as the founding of [[Brown University]] in 1764). The evangelical mission led to the establishment of the national [[Triennial Convention]] in 1814, a collaborative effort by local churches to organize, fund, and deploy missionaries.  The ABCUSA descends from this Triennial Convention. Through the Triennial Convention structure a number of mission-oriented societies were formed, including the [[American Baptist Missionary Union|American Baptist Foreign Mission Society]] (1814), [[American Baptist Home Mission Society]] (1832), American Baptist Publication Society (1841), and the American Baptist Education Society (1888).\n\nIn 1845, a majority of Baptists in the [[Southern U.S.|South]] withdrew support from the Triennial Convention \u2013 largely in response to the decision of its delegates to ban slave holders from becoming ordained missionaries \u2013 and formed the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] (SBC).  The Triennial Convention was loosely structured, and the SBC offered Baptists a more centralized organizational structure for carrying on missionary and benevolent work.  In contrast, however, the Triennial Convention afforded local churches a higher degree of local autonomy, a more traditional characteristic of Baptist polity.  The majority of churches in the North continued to work through these separate cooperating societies for missions and benevolence.  The societies were united under the umbrella of a unified convention in 1907.\n\n===Northern Baptist Convention===\nThe ''Northern Baptist Convention'' was founded in Washington, D.C. on May 17, 1907. [[Charles Evans Hughes]], then [[Governor of New York]] and later [[Chief Justice of the United States]], served the body as its first president. The purpose of the Northern Baptist Convention was to bring about a consistent cooperation among the separate Baptist bodies then existing.  It was the first step in bringing together Baptists in the North \"with ties to the historic American Baptist mission societies in the nineteenth century.\"<ref name = Martin>{{Citation | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0NXG/is_1_34/ai_94160904/ | first = Dana | last = Martin | contribution = The American Baptist Convention and the Civil Rights Movement: Rhetoric and Response | title = Baptist History and Heritage |date=Winter 1999}}.</ref> These had contributed to establishing many schools for [[freedmen]] in the South after the [[American Civil War]], as well as working on issues of health and welfare. Many of their missionaries and members had worked as teachers in the South.  In 1911, most of the churches of the [[Free Will Baptist Church|Free Will Baptist General Conference]] merged with it.\n\n===American Baptist Convention===\n[[File:Riverside Church 05.JPG|thumb|right|195px|Historic [[Riverside Church]] (1930) in [[Upper Manhattan]] retains its association with ABCUSA.]]\nThe name of the Convention was changed in 1950 to the ''American Baptist Convention'' (ABC), and it operated under this name until 1972.  It was the second step at bringing together on a national level Baptists with ties to the mission societies.  The ABC was characterized from 1950\u201366 with annual resolutions at its conventions having to do with the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and race relations.\n{{Quote | Without exception, these resolutions were progressive and genuinely encompassing. They addressed both the need for individual change in attitude and action, and the need for broader social change that could only be instituted through political action.<ref name=Martin />}}\n\nAs in many cases, the rhetoric of the annual conventions was sometimes ahead of local activity, but the denomination gradually made progress. In 1964, it created the Baptist Action for Racial Brotherhood (BARB), which early the next year produced a pamphlet outlining actions for change in local churches. In 1968, the national convention was challenged by \"Black American Baptist Churchmen Speak To the American Baptist Convention,\" demands that challenged how the denomination had \"conducted its business relative to black American Baptists.\"<ref name = Martin /> The black churchmen said the Convention had excluded them from decisionmaking positions, even while working with good intentions on behalf of black American Baptists. The following year, Dr. Thomas Kilgore Jr., pastor of the Second Baptist Church of Los Angeles, was elected the first black president of the Convention. The 1968 Convention also voted to create the Study Commission on Denominational Structure (SCODS). Its recommendations changed the denomination in a variety of ways, after being adopted at the 1972 Convention.<ref name =Martin />\n\n===American Baptist Churches USA===\nTo reflect its new structure, the Convention in 1972 changed its name to the American Baptist Churches USA.  Rather than relying on decisionmaking at the annual Convention by whichever churches happened to send delegates, the SCODS restructuring resulted in the following:\n{{Quote | A General Board was composed of duly elected representatives from geographically designated districts. Three-fourths of those representatives would be elected by the American Baptist regional bodies; one-fourth would be elected as at-large representatives, or in the official terminology, \"Nationally Nominated Representatives.\" These representatives would be \"chosen so as to provide the necessary balance among the Representatives in respect of racial/ethnic inclusiveness, geographic area, age, gender, and desirable skills.<ref name=Martin />}}\n\nIn 2006, the American Baptist Churches of the Pacific Southwest, believing that \"the practice of homosexuality is incompatible with Christian teaching,\" split from the ABCUSA.
