The instrument has approximately 33,000 pipes and requires approximately {{convert|600|hp|lk=in}} of blowers to operate. The condition of the organ deteriorated partly as a result of carelessness during hall renovation in 2001, and was no longer functional. However a repair program began in 2007, bringing the organ back to about 25% functionality by 2013.<ref>http://www.boardwalkhall.com/arena-information/midmer-losh Accessed 2015-05-07.</ref>\n\nBoardwalk Hall's attached ballroom contains a 55-[[Organ stop|rank]] Kimball concert/theater pipe organ&nbsp;\u2014 originally installed to accompany silent movies&nbsp;\u2014 that was severely damaged during the hall's renovation. Compared to the Main Auditorium organ, this organ looks tiny.

With additional foundation and private funding, the committee forecasts completion of restoration in 2023.\n\n==Awards==\nThe convention center is one of the only buildings surviving from Atlantic City's heyday as a seaside resort in the 1920s.

He is seen as the Chief Minister for a long time and should provide access to young people.\n\n[[Iskandar of Johor|Tunku Mahmood Iskandar]], who had just been re-appointed as the Crown Prince of Johor, urged Othman to immediately resign for questioning the legitimacy of the crown prince.<ref name=\"Kershaw103\">Kershaw (2001), pg 103</ref> Several demonstrations were reportedly planned to be held in several places including [[Kota Tinggi]].<ref>'The 1983 Malaysian constitutional crisis: two views and select ...', Simon Barraclough, P.

He had served in that position for 14 years.\n\nA few years later, in 1987, he joined the newly formed [[Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah]]-helmed political party S46 to challenge UMNO in the [[1990 Malaysian general election]].<ref name=\":3\" /> However, the party did not succeed and was later dissolved.\n\n==Personal life==\nOthman was born in ''Kampung Tengah'' (Tengah Village), [[Muar (town)|Muar]], [[Johor]] to a wealthy rice trader.\n\nOthman has nine children from three marriages, 32 grandchildren and ten great-grandchildren.

Tiwari ([1955] 2005) lists the following principal differences between the two:\n\n* Vedic had a [[voiceless bilabial fricative]] ({{lang|sa|\u1cf6}} {{IPAblink|\u0278}}, called ''upadhm\u0101n\u012bya'') and a [[voiceless velar fricative]] ({{lang|sa|\u1cf5}} {{IPAblink|x}}, called ''jihv\u0101m\u016bl\u012bya'')\u2014which used to occur as [[allophones]] of ''visarga'' (\u0905\u0903 {{IPAblink|h}}) appeared before voiceless [[labial consonant|labial]] and [[velar consonant]]s respectively. Both of them were lost in Classical Sanskrit to give way to the simple ''visarga''. ''Upadhm\u0101n\u012bya'' occurs before ''{{IAST|p}}'' and ''{{IAST|ph}}'', ''jihv\u0101m\u016bl\u012bya'' before ''{{IAST|k}}'' and ''{{IAST|kh}}''.\n* Vedic had a [[retroflex lateral approximant]] ({{IPAblink|\u026d}}) ({{lang|sa|\u0933}}) as well as its breathy-voiced counterpart {{IPA|[\u026d\u02b1]}} ({{lang|sa|\u0933\u094d\u0939}}), which were lost in Classical Sanskrit, to be replaced with the corresponding plosives {{IPAblink|\u027d}} ({{lang|sa|\u0921}}) and {{IPA|[\u027d\u02b1]}} ({{lang|sa|\u0922}}). (Varies by region; Vedic pronunciations are still in common use in some regions, e.g. southern India, including Maharashtra; it was also metrically a cluster, suggesting original Rigvedic pronunciations of {{IPA|[\u0290\u0256]}} and {{IPA|[\u0290\u0256\u02b1]}} (see [[Mitanni-Aryan]]) before the loss of voiced sibilants, which occurred after the split of Proto-Indo-Iranian.\n:Vedic also had a separate symbol {{lang|sa|\u0933}} for retroflex ''l'', an intervocalic allophone of ''{{IAST|\u1e0d}}'', transliterated as ''{{IAST|\u1e37}}'' or ''{{IAST|\u1e37h}}''. In order to disambiguate vocalic ''l'' from retroflex ''l'', vocalic ''l'' is sometimes transliterated with a ring below the letter, ''{{transl|sa|l\u0325}}''; when this is done, vocalic ''r'' is also represented with a ring, ''{{transl|sa|r\u0325}}'', for consistency (c.f. [[ISO 15919]]).\n* The pronunciations of syllabic {{IPA|[r\u0329]}} ({{lang|sa|\u090b}}) and {{IPA|[l\u0329]}} ({{lang|sa|\u090c}}) and their long counterparts {{IPA|[r\u0329\u02d0]}} ({{lang|sa|\u0960}}) and {{IPA|[l\u0329\u02d0]}} ({{lang|sa|\u0961}}) no longer retained their pure pronunciations, but had started to be pronounced as short and long {{IPA|[ri]}} ({{lang|sa|\u0930\u093f}}) and {{IPA|[li]}} ({{lang|sa|\u0932\u094d\u0930\u093f}}) during the decline of Sanskrit. It partly varies by region like in southern India, including Maharashtra, people will pronounce \u090b as ru (\u0930\u0941)and \u090c as lru (\u0932\u094d\u0930\u0941), this is pronounced according to Taittiriya Pratishakya of the Taittiriya Shakha or branch of the Yajur Veda. Virtually no region pronounces as would in vedic Sanskrit generally. Only while reciting Vedas is it normally heard. But if the Pratishakhya, i.e. the pronunciation manual,  mandates it otherwise, the latter is followed.\n* The vowels ''e'' ({{lang|sa|\u090f}}) and ''o'' ({{lang|sa|\u0913}}) were actually realized in Vedic as [[diphthong]]s {{IPA|[ai\u032f]}} and {{IPA|[au\u032f]}}, but they became pure [[monophthong]]s {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[o\u02d0]}} in Classical Sanskrit, such as ''{{IAST|daiv\u00e1}}'' > ''{{IAST|dev\u00e1}}''.\n* The vowels ''ai'' ({{lang|sa|\u0910}}) and ''au'' ({{lang|sa|\u0914}}) were actually realized in Vedic as long [[diphthong]]s {{IPA|[a\u02d0i\u032f]}} ({{lang|sa|\u0906\u0907}}) and {{IPA|[a\u02d0u\u032f]}} ({{lang|sa|\u0906\u0909}}), but they became short [[diphthong]]s {{IPA|[ai\u032f]}} ({{lang|sa|\u0905\u0907}}) and {{IPA|[au\u032f]}} ({{lang|sa|\u0905\u0909}}) in Classical Sanskrit, such as ''{{IAST|dy\u0101\u0301u\u1e25}}'' > ''{{IAST|dy\u00e1u\u1e25}}''.\n* The ''Pr\u0101tish\u0101khyas'' claim that the \"dental\" consonants were articulated from the root of the teeth (''dantam\u016bl\u012bya'', [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]]), but they became pure [[dental consonant|dentals]] later. This included {{IPAblink|r}}, which later became a [[retroflex consonant]].\n* Vedic had a [[pitch accent]] which could even change the meaning of the words, and was still in use in P\u0101\u1e47ini's time, as we can infer by his use of devices to indicate its position. At some latter time, this was replaced by a stress accent limited to the second to fourth syllables from the end. Today, the pitch accent can be heard only in the traditional Vedic chantings.\n:Since a small number of words in the late pronunciation of Vedic carry the so-called \"independent ''[[svarita]]''\" on a short vowel, one can argue that ''late'' Vedic was ''marginally'' a [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal language]]. Note however that in the metrically-restored versions of the ''[[Rig Veda]] ''almost all of the syllables carrying an [[independent svarita]] must revert to a sequence of two syllables, the first of which carries an ''[[udatta|ud\u0101tta]]'' and the second a so-called dependent ''[[svarita]]''. Early Vedic was thus definitely not a tone language like [[Chinese language|Chinese]] but a pitch accent language like [[Japanese language|Japanese]], which was inherited from the [[Proto-Indo-European accent]]. See [[Vedic accent]].\n:Pitch accent was not restricted to Vedic: early Sanskrit grammarian [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]] gives both accent rules for the spoken language of his (post-Vedic) time as well as the differences of Vedic accent. We have, however, no extant post-Vedic text with accents.\n* The ''[[pluti]]'' ([[mora (linguistics)|trimoraic]]) vowels were on the verge of becoming [[phoneme|phonemicized]] during middle Vedic, but disappeared again.\n* Vedic often allowed two like vowels to come together in [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] without merger during [[sandhi]], possibly through a laryngeal ''/H/'', such as ''{{IAST|bh\u00e1as}}'' ~ ''{{IAST|bh\u00e1Has}}'' > ''{{IAST|bh\u0101\u0301s}}''.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{main|Vedic Sanskrit grammar}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Vedic meter]]\n*[[Vedic period]]\n*''[[A Vedic Word Concordance]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Delbr\u00fcck|first1=Berthold|authorlink1=Berthold Delbr\u00fcck|last2=Windisch|first2=Ernst Wilhelm Oskar|title=Syntaktische Forschungen: III.

In order to disambiguate vocalic ''l'' from retroflex ''l'', vocalic ''l'' is sometimes transliterated with a ring below the letter, ''{{transl|sa|l\u0325}}''; when this is done, vocalic ''r'' is also represented with a ring, ''{{transl|sa|r\u0325}}'', for consistency (c.f. [[ISO 15919]]).\n* The pronunciations of syllabic {{IPA|[r\u0329]}} ({{lang|sa|\u090b}}) and {{IPA|[l\u0329]}} ({{lang|sa|\u090c}}) and their long counterparts {{IPA|[r\u0329\u02d0]}} ({{lang|sa|\u0960}}) and {{IPA|[l\u0329\u02d0]}} ({{lang|sa|\u0961}}) no longer retained their pure pronunciations, but had started to be pronounced as short and long {{IPA|[ri]}} ({{lang|sa|\u0930\u093f}}) and {{IPA|[li]}} ({{lang|sa|\u0932\u094d\u0930\u093f}}) during the decline of Sanskrit. It partly varies by region like in southern India, including Maharashtra, people will pronounce \u090b as ru (\u0930\u0941)and \u090c as lru (\u0932\u094d\u0930\u0941), this is pronounced according to Taittiriya Pratishakya of the Taittiriya Shakha or branch of the Yajur Veda. Virtually no region pronounces as would in vedic Sanskrit generally. Only while reciting Vedas is it normally heard. But if the Pratishakhya, i.e. the pronunciation manual,  mandates it otherwise, the latter is followed.\n* The vowels ''e'' ({{lang|sa|\u090f}}) and ''o'' ({{lang|sa|\u0913}}) were actually realized in Vedic as [[diphthong]]s {{IPA|[ai\u032f]}} and {{IPA|[au\u032f]}}, but they became pure [[monophthong]]s {{IPA|[e\u02d0]}} and {{IPA|[o\u02d0]}} in Classical Sanskrit, such as ''{{IAST|daiv\u00e1}}'' > ''{{IAST|dev\u00e1}}''.\n* The vowels ''ai'' ({{lang|sa|\u0910}}) and ''au'' ({{lang|sa|\u0914}}) were actually realized in Vedic as long [[diphthong]]s {{IPA|[a\u02d0i\u032f]}} ({{lang|sa|\u0906\u0907}}) and {{IPA|[a\u02d0u\u032f]}} ({{lang|sa|\u0906\u0909}}), but they became short [[diphthong]]s {{IPA|[ai\u032f]}} ({{lang|sa|\u0905\u0907}}) and {{IPA|[au\u032f]}} ({{lang|sa|\u0905\u0909}}) in Classical Sanskrit, such as ''{{IAST|dy\u0101\u0301u\u1e25}}'' > ''{{IAST|dy\u00e1u\u1e25}}''.\n* The ''Pr\u0101tish\u0101khyas'' claim that the \"dental\" consonants were articulated from the root of the teeth (''dantam\u016bl\u012bya'', [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]]), but they became pure [[dental consonant|dentals]] later. This included {{IPAblink|r}}, which later became a [[retroflex consonant]].\n* Vedic had a [[pitch accent]] which could even change the meaning of the words, and was still in use in P\u0101\u1e47ini's time, as we can infer by his use of devices to indicate its position. At some latter time, this was replaced by a stress accent limited to the second to fourth syllables from the end. Today, the pitch accent can be heard only in the traditional Vedic chantings.\n:Since a small number of words in the late pronunciation of Vedic carry the so-called \"independent ''[[svarita]]''\" on a short vowel, one can argue that ''late'' Vedic was ''marginally'' a [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal language]]. Note however that in the metrically-restored versions of the ''[[Rig Veda]] ''almost all of the syllables carrying an [[independent svarita]] must revert to a sequence of two syllables, the first of which carries an ''[[udatta|ud\u0101tta]]'' and the second a so-called dependent ''[[svarita]]''. Early Vedic was thus definitely not a tone language like [[Chinese language|Chinese]] but a pitch accent language like [[Japanese language|Japanese]], which was inherited from the [[Proto-Indo-European accent]]. See [[Vedic accent]].\n:Pitch accent was not restricted to Vedic: early Sanskrit grammarian [[P\u0101\u1e47ini]] gives both accent rules for the spoken language of his (post-Vedic) time as well as the differences of Vedic accent. We have, however, no extant post-Vedic text with accents.\n* The ''[[pluti]]'' ([[mora (linguistics)|trimoraic]]) vowels were on the verge of becoming [[phoneme|phonemicized]] during middle Vedic, but disappeared again.\n* Vedic often allowed two like vowels to come together in [[hiatus (linguistics)|hiatus]] without merger during [[sandhi]], possibly through a laryngeal ''/H/'', such as ''{{IAST|bh\u00e1as}}'' ~ ''{{IAST|bh\u00e1Has}}'' > ''{{IAST|bh\u0101\u0301s}}''.\n\n==Grammar==\n{{main|Vedic Sanskrit grammar}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Vedic meter]]\n*[[Vedic period]]\n*''[[A Vedic Word Concordance]]''\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Delbr\u00fcck|first1=Berthold|authorlink1=Berthold Delbr\u00fcck|last2=Windisch|first2=Ernst Wilhelm Oskar|title=Syntaktische Forschungen: III.
