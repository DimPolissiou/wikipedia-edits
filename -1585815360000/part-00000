Water use is measured in water volume consumed (evaporated) and/or polluted per unit of time. A water footprint can be [[Calculation|calculated]] for any well-defined group of [[consumer]]s (e.g., an individual, family, village, city, province, state or nation) or [[Production (economics)|producers]] (e.g., a public organization, private enterprise or economic sector), for a single [[process]] (such as growing rice) or for any [[Product (business)|product]] or [[Service (economics)|service]].<ref name=waterfootprintorg>{{cite web|title=Waterfootprint.org: Water footprint and virtual water|url=http://www.waterfootprint.org/?page=files/home|publisher=The Water Footprint Network|access-date=9 April 2014}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, water use has been approached from the production side, by quantifying the following three columns of water use: water withdrawals in the  [[Agriculture|agricultural]], [[Manufacturing|industrial]], and [[Home|domestic]] sector. While this does provide valuable data, it is a limited way of looking at water use in a [[Globalization|globalised]] world, in which products are not always consumed in their country of origin. International trade of agricultural and industrial products in effect creates a global flow of [[virtual water]], or ''embodied water'' (akin to the concept of [[embodied energy]]).<ref name=\"nations\" />\n\nIn 2002, the water footprint concept was introduced in order to have a consumption-based [[Economic indicator|indicator]] of water use, that could provide useful information in addition to the traditional production-sector-based indicators of water use. It is analogous to the [[ecological footprint]] concept introduced in the 1990s. The water footprint is a geographically explicit indicator, not only showing volumes of water use and pollution, but also the locations.<ref>Definition taken from the Hoekstra, A.Y. and Chapagain, A.K.

Irrigated agriculture, industry and domestic water use can each have a blue water footprint.<ref name=\"whatis\">{{cite web|title=What is a water footprint?|url=http://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/what-is-water-footprint/|publisher=The Water Footprint Network|access-date=8 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Green water footprint===\nA ''green water footprint'' is the amount of water from [[precipitation]] that, after having been stored in the root zone of the soil (green water), is either lost by [[evapotranspiration]] or incorporated by plants. It is particularly relevant for agricultural, [[Horticulture|horticultural]] and [[forestry]] products.<ref name=\"whatis\" />\n\n===Grey water footprint===\nA ''grey water footprint'' is the volume of water that is required to dilute [[Water pollution|pollutants]] (industrial discharges, seepage from tailing ponds at mining operations, untreated municipal wastewater, or [[nonpoint source pollution]] such as agricultural runoff or [[urban runoff]]) to such an extent that the quality of the water meets agreed water quality standards.<ref name=\"whatis\" /> It is calculated as:\n\n:<math>\\frac{L}{c_\\text{max} - c_\\text{nat}}</math>\n\nwhere ''L'' is the pollutant load (as [[mass flux]]), ''c''<sub>max</sub> the maximum allowable concentration and ''c''<sub>nat</sub> the natural concentration of the pollutant in the receiving water body (both expressed in mass/volume).<ref name=\"TheWaterFootprintAssessmentManual\">{{cite web|title=The Water Footprint Assessment Manual|url=http://www.waterfootprint.org/?page=files/WaterFootprintAssessmentManual|publisher=Water Footprint Network|access-date=2015-01-20}}</ref>\n\n===Calculation for different actors===\nThe water footprint of a process is expressed as [[volumetric flow rate]] of water. That of a product is the whole footprint (sum) of processes in its complete supply chain divided by the number of product units. For consumers, businesses and geographic area, water footprint is indicated as volume of water per time, in particular:<ref name=\"TheWaterFootprintAssessmentManual\" />\n\n* That of a consumer is the sum of footprint of all consumed products.\n* That of a community or a nation is the sum for all of its members resp. inhabitants.\n* That of a business is the footprint of all produced goods.\n* That of a geographically delineated area is the footprint of all processes undertaken in this area. The virtual water balance of an area is the net import of virtual water ''V<sub>i, net</sub>'', defined as the difference of the gross import ''V<sub>i</sub>'' of virtual water from its gross export ''V<sub>e</sub>''. The water footprint of national consumption ''WF<sub>area,nat</sub>'' results from this as the sum of the water footprint of national area and its virtual water balance.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a ''water footprint'' was coined in 2002, by [[Arjen Hoekstra]], Professor in [[water management]] at the [[University of Twente]], Netherlands, and co-founder and scientific director of the Water Footprint Network, whilst working at the [[UNESCO-IHE]] Institute for Water Education, as a [[System of measurement|metric]] to measure the amount of water consumed and polluted to produce goods and services along their full supply chain.<ref name=\"aims\">{{cite web|url=http://waterfootprint.org/en/about-us/aims-history/ |title=Water Footprint Network - Aims & history |publisher=Water Footprint Network |date=|access-date= 27 January 2018}}</ref><ref>Jayne M.

The network consists of around 100 partners from all sectors \u2013 producers, investors, suppliers and regulators \u2013 as well as [[non-governmental organisation]]s and [[Academy|academia]].

In July 2014, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] issued ''ISO 14046:2014, Environmental management\u2014Water footprint\u2014Principles, requirements and guidelines'', to provide practical guidance to practitioners from various backgrounds, such as large companies, public authorities, non-governmental organizations, academic and research groups as well as small and medium enterprises, for carrying out a water footprint assessment.

Analysis of the water footprint of nations illustrates the global dimension of water consumption and pollution, by showing that several countries rely heavily on foreign water resources and that (consumption patterns in) many countries significantly and in various ways impact how, and how much, water is being consumed and polluted elsewhere on Earth. International water dependencies are substantial and are likely to increase with continued global [[Free trade|trade liberalisation]]. The largest share (76%) of the virtual water flows between countries is related to international trade in crops and derived crop products. Trade in animal products and industrial products contributed 12% each to the global virtual water flows. The four major direct factors determining the water footprint of a country are: volume of consumption (related to the [[gross national income]]); consumption pattern (e.g. high versus low [[List of countries by meat consumption|meat consumption]]); climate (growth conditions); and agricultural practice (water use efficiency).<ref name=\"nations\" />\n\n===Production or consumption===\nThe assessment of total water use in connection to consumption can be approached from both ends of the [[supply chain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/national-water-footprint/|title=National water footprint|author=|date=|website=waterfootprint.org|access-date=10 March 2018}}</ref> The water footprint of '''production''' estimates how much water from local sources is used or polluted in order to provide the goods and services produced in that country.

A country's [[per capita]] water footprint (that nation's water footprint divided by its number of inhabitants) can be used to compare its water footprint with those of other nations.\n\nThe global water footprint in the period 1996\u20132005 was 9.087 Gm3/yr (Billion Cubic Metres per year, or 9.087.000.000.000.000 liters/year), of which 74% was and green, 11% blue, 15% grey.

High water footprints can also be found in Malaysia and Thailand. In contrast, the Chinese people have a relatively low per capita water footprint with an average of 700 m3/yr.<ref name=\"nations\" /> (These numbers are also from the period 1996-2005)\n\n===Internal or external===\n[[File:GlobalWaterFootprint by sector.1500.jpg|thumb|560px|Global average numbers and composition of all national water footprints, internal and external]]\nThe '''internal water footprint''' is the amount of water used from domestic water resources; the '''external water footprint''' is the amount of water used in other countries to produce goods and services imported and consumed by the inhabitants of the country. When assessing the water footprint of a nation, it is crucial to take into account the international flows of [[virtual water]] (also called ''embodied water'', i.e. the water used or polluted in connection to all agricultural and industrial commodities) leaving and entering the country. When taking the use of domestic water resources as a starting point for calculating a nation's water footprint, one should subtract the virtual water flows that leave the country and add the virtual water flows that enter the country.<ref name=\"nations\" />\n\nThe external part of a nation's water footprint varies strongly from country to country. Some African nations, such as Sudan, Mali, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Malawi and Chad have hardly any external water footprint, simply because they have little import. Some European countries on the other hand\u2014e.g. Italy, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands\u2014have external water footprints that constitute 50\u201380% of their total water footprint. The agricultural products that on average contribute most to the external water footprints of nations are: bovine meat, soybean, wheat, cocoa, rice, cotton and maize.\n<ref name=\"nations\" />\n\nThe top 10 gross virtual water exporting nations, which together account for more than half of the global virtual water export, are the United States (314 Gm3\u2215year), China (143 Gm3\u2215year), India (125 Gm3\u2215year), Brazil (112 Gm3\u2215year), Argentina (98 Gm3\u2215year), Canada (91 Gm3\u2215year), Australia (89 Gm3\u2215year), Indonesia (72 Gm3\u2215year), France (65 Gm3\u2215year), and Germany (64 Gm3\u2215year).<ref name=\"humanity\" />\n\nThe top 10 gross virtual water importing nations are the United States (234 Gm3\u2215year), Japan (127 Gm3\u2215year), Germany (125 Gm3\u2215year), China (121 Gm3\u2215year), Italy (101 Gm3\u2215year), Mexico (92 Gm3\u2215year), France (78 Gm3\u2215year), the United Kingdom (77 Gm3\u2215year), and The Netherlands (71 Gm3\u2215year).<ref name=\"humanity\" />\n\n== Water use in continents ==\n\n=== Europe ===\n{{See also |:Category:Droughts in Europe}}\nEach [[Demographics of the European Union|EU citizen]] consumes 4,815 litres of water per day on average; 44% is used in power production primarily to cool thermal plants or [[Nuclear power in the European Union|nuclear power]] plants.

For example, in [[California]], where water use issues are sometimes severe because of drought, about 48 percent of \u201cdedicated water use\u201d in an average water year is for the environment (somewhat more than for agriculture).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.water.ca.gov/swp/watersupply.cfm|title=California State Water Project-Water Supply|author=|date=|website=www.Water.ca.gov|access-date=5 May 2017}}</ref> Such environmental water use is for keeping streams flowing, maintaining aquatic and riparian habitats, keeping wetlands wet, etc.\n\n==Criticism of water footprint and virtual water==\n\n===Insufficient consideration of consequences of proposed water saving policies to farm households===\nAccording to Dennis Wichelns of the [[International Water Management Institute]]: \"Although one goal of virtual water analysis is to describe opportunities for improving water security, there is almost no mention of the potential impacts of the prescriptions arising from that analysis on farm households in industrialized or developing countries. It is essential to consider more carefully the inherent flaws in the virtual water and water footprint perspectives, particularly when seeking guidance regarding policy decisions.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wichelns |first=Dennis |date=2010 |title=Virtual water and water footprints offer limited insight regarding important policy questions |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/publications/journal-articles/ |journal=International Journal of Water Resources Development |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=639\u2013651 |doi=10.1080/07900627.2010.519494 |access-date=21 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Regional water scarcity should be taken into account when interpreting water footprint===\nThe application and interpretation of water footprints may sometimes be used to promote industrial activities that lead to facile criticism of certain products. For example, the 140&nbsp;litres required for coffee production for one cup<ref name=\"waterfootprintorg\" /> might be of no harm to water resources if its cultivation occurs mainly in humid areas, but could be damaging in more arid regions. Other factors such as hydrology, climate, geology, topography, population and demographics should also be taken into account. Nevertheless, high water footprint calculations do suggest that environmental concern may be appropriate.\n\nThe use of the term ''footprint'' can also confuse people familiar with the notion of a [[carbon footprint]], because the water footprint concept includes sums of water quantities without necessarily evaluating related impacts. This is in contrast to the carbon footprint, where carbon emissions are not simply summarized but normalized by CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, which are globally identical, to account for the environmental harm. The difference is due to the somewhat more complex nature of water; while involved in the global hydrological cycle, it is expressed in conditions both local and regional through various forms like river basins, watersheds, on down to groundwater (as part of larger [[aquifer]] systems).\n\n==Sustainable water use==\n[[Sustainable]] water use involves the rigorous assessment of all source of clean water to establish the current and future rates of use, the impacts of that use both downstream and in the wider area where the water may be used and the impact of  contaminated water streams on the environment and economic well being of the area. It also involves the implementation of [[social policy|social policies]] such as [[water pricing]] in order to manage water demand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/water-resources/policies-and-measures-to-promote-sustainable-water-use|publisher=Europeanm Environment Agency|title=Policies and measure to promote sustainable water use|access-date=26 April 2016|date=18 February 2008}}</ref> In some localities, water may also have spiritual relevance and the use of such water may need to take account of such interests.

For example, in Canada, in 2005, 42 billion m\u00b3 of withdrawn water were used, of which about 38 billion m\u00b3 were freshwater. Distribution of this use among sectors was: thermoelectric power generation 66.2%, manufacturing 13.6%, residential 9.0%, agriculture 4.7%, commercial and institutional 2.7%, water treatment and distribution systems   2.3%, mining  1.1%, and oil and gas extraction 0.5%.  The 38 billion cu.m of freshwater withdrawn in that year can be compared with the nation's annual freshwater yield (estimated as streamflow) of 3,472 billion cu.m.<ref>Statistics Canada.  2010.  Human activity and the environment.  Freshwater supply and demand in Canada.

While this does provide valuable data, it is a limited way of looking at water use in a [[Globalization|globalised]] world, in which products are not always consumed in their country of origin. International trade of agricultural and industrial products in effect creates a global flow of [[virtual water]], or ''embodied water'' (akin to the concept of [[embodied energy]]).<ref name=\"nations\" />\n\nIn 2002, the water footprint concept was introduced in order to have a consumption-based [[Economic indicator|indicator]] of water use, that could provide useful information in addition to the traditional production-sector-based indicators of water use. It is analogous to the [[ecological footprint]] concept introduced in the 1990s. The water footprint is a geographically explicit indicator, not only showing volumes of water use and pollution, but also the locations.<ref>Definition taken from the Hoekstra, A.Y. and Chapagain, A.K.

That of a product is the whole footprint (sum) of processes in its complete supply chain divided by the number of product units. For consumers, businesses and geographic area, water footprint is indicated as volume of water per time, in particular:<ref name=\"TheWaterFootprintAssessmentManual\" />\n\n* That of a consumer is the sum of footprint of all consumed products.\n* That of a community or a nation is the sum for all of its members resp. inhabitants.\n* That of a business is the footprint of all produced goods.\n* That of a geographically delineated area is the footprint of all processes undertaken in this area. The virtual water balance of an area is the net import of virtual water ''V<sub>i, net</sub>'', defined as the difference of the gross import ''V<sub>i</sub>'' of virtual water from its gross export ''V<sub>e</sub>''. The water footprint of national consumption ''WF<sub>area,nat</sub>'' results from this as the sum of the water footprint of national area and its virtual water balance.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a ''water footprint'' was coined in 2002, by [[Arjen Hoekstra]], Professor in [[water management]] at the [[University of Twente]], Netherlands, and co-founder and scientific director of the Water Footprint Network, whilst working at the [[UNESCO-IHE]] Institute for Water Education, as a [[System of measurement|metric]] to measure the amount of water consumed and polluted to produce goods and services along their full supply chain.<ref name=\"aims\">{{cite web|url=http://waterfootprint.org/en/about-us/aims-history/ |title=Water Footprint Network - Aims & history |publisher=Water Footprint Network |date=|access-date= 27 January 2018}}</ref><ref>Jayne M.

Analysis of the water footprint of nations illustrates the global dimension of water consumption and pollution, by showing that several countries rely heavily on foreign water resources and that (consumption patterns in) many countries significantly and in various ways impact how, and how much, water is being consumed and polluted elsewhere on Earth. International water dependencies are substantial and are likely to increase with continued global [[Free trade|trade liberalisation]]. The largest share (76%) of the virtual water flows between countries is related to international trade in crops and derived crop products. Trade in animal products and industrial products contributed 12% each to the global virtual water flows. The four major direct factors determining the water footprint of a country are: volume of consumption (related to the [[gross national income]]); consumption pattern (e.g. high versus low [[List of countries by meat consumption|meat consumption]]); climate (growth conditions); and agricultural practice (water use efficiency).<ref name=\"nations\" />\n\n===Production or consumption===\nThe assessment of total water use in connection to consumption can be approached from both ends of the [[supply chain]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/national-water-footprint/|title=National water footprint|author=|date=|website=waterfootprint.org|access-date=10 March 2018}}</ref> The water footprint of '''production''' estimates how much water from local sources is used or polluted in order to provide the goods and services produced in that country. The water footprint of '''consumption''' of a country looks at the amount of water used or polluted (locally, or in the case of imported goods, in other countries) in connection with all the goods and services that are consumed by the inhabitants of that country. The water footprint of production and that of consumption, can also be estimated for any administrative unit such as a city, province, river basin or the entire world.<ref name=\"nations\" />\n\n===Absolute or per capita===\nThe absolute water footprint is the total sum of water footprints of all people. A country's [[per capita]] water footprint (that nation's water footprint divided by its number of inhabitants) can be used to compare its water footprint with those of other nations.\n\nThe global water footprint in the period 1996\u20132005 was 9.087 Gm3/yr (Billion Cubic Metres per year, or 9.087.000.000.000.000 liters/year), of which 74% was and green, 11% blue, 15% grey. This is an average amount per capita of 1.385 Gm3/yr., or 3.800 liters per person per day.<ref name=Morelli>{{cite web|title=Angela Morelli - The Global Water Footprint of Humanity|publisher=TEDxOslo}}</ref> On average 92% of this is embedded in agricultural products consumed, 4.4% in industrial products consumed, and 3.6% is domestic water use.

In relative terms (i.e. taking population size into account), the people of the USA have the largest water footprint, with 2480 m3/yr per capita, followed by the people in south European countries such as Greece, Italy and Spain (2300\u20132400 m3/yr per capita). High water footprints can also be found in Malaysia and Thailand. In contrast, the Chinese people have a relatively low per capita water footprint with an average of 700 m3/yr.<ref name=\"nations\" /> (These numbers are also from the period 1996-2005)\n\n===Internal or external===\n[[File:GlobalWaterFootprint by sector.1500.jpg|thumb|560px|Global average numbers and composition of all national water footprints, internal and external]]\nThe '''internal water footprint''' is the amount of water used from domestic water resources; the '''external water footprint''' is the amount of water used in other countries to produce goods and services imported and consumed by the inhabitants of the country. When assessing the water footprint of a nation, it is crucial to take into account the international flows of [[virtual water]] (also called ''embodied water'', i.e. the water used or polluted in connection to all agricultural and industrial commodities) leaving and entering the country. When taking the use of domestic water resources as a starting point for calculating a nation's water footprint, one should subtract the virtual water flows that leave the country and add the virtual water flows that enter the country.<ref name=\"nations\" />\n\nThe external part of a nation's water footprint varies strongly from country to country. Some African nations, such as Sudan, Mali, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Malawi and Chad have hardly any external water footprint, simply because they have little import. Some European countries on the other hand\u2014e.g. Italy, Germany, the UK and the Netherlands\u2014have external water footprints that constitute 50\u201380% of their total water footprint. The agricultural products that on average contribute most to the external water footprints of nations are: bovine meat, soybean, wheat, cocoa, rice, cotton and maize.\n<ref name=\"nations\" />\n\nThe top 10 gross virtual water exporting nations, which together account for more than half of the global virtual water export, are the United States (314 Gm3\u2215year), China (143 Gm3\u2215year), India (125 Gm3\u2215year), Brazil (112 Gm3\u2215year), Argentina (98 Gm3\u2215year), Canada (91 Gm3\u2215year), Australia (89 Gm3\u2215year), Indonesia (72 Gm3\u2215year), France (65 Gm3\u2215year), and Germany (64 Gm3\u2215year).<ref name=\"humanity\" />\n\nThe top 10 gross virtual water importing nations are the United States (234 Gm3\u2215year), Japan (127 Gm3\u2215year), Germany (125 Gm3\u2215year), China (121 Gm3\u2215year), Italy (101 Gm3\u2215year), Mexico (92 Gm3\u2215year), France (78 Gm3\u2215year), the United Kingdom (77 Gm3\u2215year), and The Netherlands (71 Gm3\u2215year).<ref name=\"humanity\" />\n\n== Water use in continents ==\n\n=== Europe ===\n{{See also |:Category:Droughts in Europe}}\nEach [[Demographics of the European Union|EU citizen]] consumes 4,815 litres of water per day on average; 44% is used in power production primarily to cool thermal plants or [[Nuclear power in the European Union|nuclear power]] plants.

For example, in [[California]], where water use issues are sometimes severe because of drought, about 48 percent of \u201cdedicated water use\u201d in an average water year is for the environment (somewhat more than for agriculture).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.water.ca.gov/swp/watersupply.cfm|title=California State Water Project-Water Supply|author=|date=|website=www.Water.ca.gov|access-date=5 May 2017}}</ref> Such environmental water use is for keeping streams flowing, maintaining aquatic and riparian habitats, keeping wetlands wet, etc.\n\n==Criticism of water footprint and virtual water==\n\n===Insufficient consideration of consequences of proposed water saving policies to farm households===\nAccording to Dennis Wichelns of the [[International Water Management Institute]]: \"Although one goal of virtual water analysis is to describe opportunities for improving water security, there is almost no mention of the potential impacts of the prescriptions arising from that analysis on farm households in industrialized or developing countries. It is essential to consider more carefully the inherent flaws in the virtual water and water footprint perspectives, particularly when seeking guidance regarding policy decisions.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wichelns |first=Dennis |date=2010 |title=Virtual water and water footprints offer limited insight regarding important policy questions |url=http://www.iwmi.cgiar.org/publications/journal-articles/ |journal=International Journal of Water Resources Development |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=639\u2013651 |doi=10.1080/07900627.2010.519494 |access-date=21 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Regional water scarcity should be taken into account when interpreting water footprint===\nThe application and interpretation of water footprints may sometimes be used to promote industrial activities that lead to facile criticism of certain products. For example, the 140&nbsp;litres required for coffee production for one cup<ref name=\"waterfootprintorg\" /> might be of no harm to water resources if its cultivation occurs mainly in humid areas, but could be damaging in more arid regions. Other factors such as hydrology, climate, geology, topography, population and demographics should also be taken into account. Nevertheless, high water footprint calculations do suggest that environmental concern may be appropriate.\n\nThe use of the term ''footprint'' can also confuse people familiar with the notion of a [[carbon footprint]], because the water footprint concept includes sums of water quantities without necessarily evaluating related impacts. This is in contrast to the carbon footprint, where carbon emissions are not simply summarized but normalized by CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, which are globally identical, to account for the environmental harm. The difference is due to the somewhat more complex nature of water; while involved in the global hydrological cycle, it is expressed in conditions both local and regional through various forms like river basins, watersheds, on down to groundwater (as part of larger [[aquifer]] systems).\n\n==Sustainable water use==\n[[Sustainable]] water use involves the rigorous assessment of all source of clean water to establish the current and future rates of use, the impacts of that use both downstream and in the wider area where the water may be used and the impact of  contaminated water streams on the environment and economic well being of the area. It also involves the implementation of [[social policy|social policies]] such as [[water pricing]] in order to manage water demand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/water/water-resources/policies-and-measures-to-promote-sustainable-water-use|publisher=Europeanm Environment Agency|title=Policies and measure to promote sustainable water use|access-date=26 April 2016|date=18 February 2008}}</ref> In some localities, water may also have spiritual relevance and the use of such water may need to take account of such interests.

For example, in Canada, in 2005, 42 billion m\u00b3 of withdrawn water were used, of which about 38 billion m\u00b3 were freshwater. Distribution of this use among sectors was: thermoelectric power generation 66.2%, manufacturing 13.6%, residential 9.0%, agriculture 4.7%, commercial and institutional 2.7%, water treatment and distribution systems   2.3%, mining  1.1%, and oil and gas extraction 0.5%.  The 38 billion cu.m of freshwater withdrawn in that year can be compared with the nation's annual freshwater yield (estimated as streamflow) of 3,472 billion cu.m.<ref>Statistics Canada.  2010.  Human activity and the environment.  Freshwater supply and demand in Canada.

It is one of the most widely used rifles in history, having been used by more than 90 countries.<ref name=\"hogg2002\">Hogg, Ian (2002). ''Jane's Guns Recognition Guide''.

The [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] variant of the FAL was redesigned from FN's [[metre|metrical]] FAL into British [[imperial units]] and was produced under licence as the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1946, the first FAL prototype was completed. It was designed to fire the intermediate [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]] cartridge developed and used by the forces of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] during [[World War II]] (with the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] [[assault rifle]]). After testing this prototype in 1948, the [[British Army]] urged FN to build additional prototypes, including one in [[bullpup]] configuration, chambered for their new [[.280 British]] [7x43mm] caliber intermediate cartridge.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\">{{cite web|url=http://world.guns.ru/assault/as24f-e.htm|title=FN FAL (Belgium)|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117172148/http://world.guns.ru/assault/as24f-e.htm|archive-date=17 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> After evaluating the single bullpup prototype, FN decided to return instead to their original, conventional design for future production.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\"/>\n\nIn 1950, the United Kingdom presented the redesigned FN rifle and the British [[EM-2 rifle|EM-2]], both in .280 British calibre, to the United States for comparison testing against the favoured [[United States Army]] design of the time\u2014Earle Harvey's T25.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powmadeak47.com/rifle/t25.html|title=Earl Harvey's T-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325165934/http://www.powmadeak47.com/rifle/t25.html |archivedate= 25 March 2012|work=powmadeak47.com}}</ref> It was hoped that a common cartridge and rifle could be standardized for issue to the armies of all NATO member countries. After this testing was completed, U.S. Army officials suggested that FN should redesign their rifle to fire the U.S. prototype \".30 Light Rifle\" cartridge. FN decided to hedge their bets with the U.S., and in 1951 even made a deal that the U.S. could produce FALs royalty-free, given that the UK appeared to be favouring their own EM-2.\n\nThis decision appeared to be correct when the British Army decided to adopt the EM-2 (as Rifle No.9 Mk1) and .280 British cartridge.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\"/> This decision was later rescinded after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] lost the 1951 General Election and [[Winston Churchill]] returned as Prime Minister. It is believed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that there was a [[quid pro quo]] agreement between Churchill and U.S. President [[Harry Truman]] in 1952 that the British accept the .30 Light Rifle cartridge as NATO standard in return for the U.S. acceptance of the FN FAL as NATO standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-fn-fal-was-almost-americas-battle-rifle-5186bdbda998|title=The FN FAL Was Almost America's Battle Rifle|first=War Is|last=Boring|date=5 October 2014|access-date=28 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506202808/https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-fn-fal-was-almost-americas-battle-rifle-5186bdbda998|archive-date=6 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The .30 Light Rifle cartridge was in fact later standardized as the 7.62&nbsp;mm NATO; however, the U.S. insisted on continued rifle tests. The FAL chambered for the .30 Light Rifle went up against the redesigned T25 (now redesignated as the T47), and an M1 Garand variant, the T44. Eventually, the T44 won, becoming the [[M14 rifle|M14]]. However, in the meantime, most other NATO countries were evaluating and selecting the FAL.\n\nFN created what is possibly the classic post-war [[battle rifle]]. Formally introduced by its designer [[Dieudonn\u00e9 Saive]] in 1951, and produced two years later, it has been described as the \"Right Arm of the Free World.\"{{sfn|Cashner|2013|p=5}} The FAL battle rifle has its [[Warsaw Pact]] counterpart in the [[AKM]], each being fielded by dozens of countries and produced in many of them. A few, such as Israel and South Africa, manufactured and issued both designs at various times. Unlike the Soviet AKM assault rifle, the FAL utilized a heavier full-power [[rifle]] [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]].\n\n==Design details==\n[[File:PISTONM16.gif|thumb|left|[[Gas-operated reloading#Short-stroke piston|Short-stroke]] gas piston, the action used on the FAL.]]\n[[File:L1A1 FIELD STRIPPED.jpg|thumb|left|L1A1 British FAL variant field stripped.]]\n\nThe FAL operates by means of a [[gas-operated]] [[Firearm action|action]] very similar to that of the Russian [[SVT-40]]. The gas system is driven by a short-stroke, spring-loaded piston housed above the [[Gun barrel|barrel]], and the locking mechanism is what is known as a ''tilting breechblock''. To lock, it drops down into a solid shoulder of metal in the heavy [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]] much like the [[Bolt (firearm)|bolts]] of the Russian [[SKS]] [[carbine]] and French [[MAS-49]] series of semi-automatic rifles. The gas system is fitted with a gas regulator behind the front sight base, allowing adjustment of the gas system in response to environmental conditions. The piston system can be bypassed completely, using the gas plug, to allow for the firing of [[rifle grenade]]s and manual operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/1457/tuning-the-fals-gas-system/|title=Tuning the FAL's Gas System|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112160722/http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/1457/tuning-the-fals-gas-system/|archive-date=12 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The FAL's magazine capacity ranges from five to 30 rounds, with most magazines holding 20 rounds. In fixed [[Stock (firearms)|stock]] versions of the FAL, the [[recoil]] spring is housed in the stock, while in folding-stock versions it is housed in the receiver cover, necessitating a slightly different receiver cover, recoil spring, and bolt carrier, and a modified lower receiver for the stock.<ref name=\"popeneker\">Popeneker, Maxim & Williams, Anthony (2005).

During opening the rifle pivots between the trigger guard and magazine well to give access to the action and piston system. This opening method causes a suboptimal iron sight line as the rear and front sight elements of the sight line are fixed to two different movable subassemblies. The sight radius for the FAL 50.00 and FAL 50.41 models is {{cvt|553|mm|1}} and for the 50.61 and FAL 50.63 models {{cvt|549|mm|in|1}}.\n \nFAL rifles have also been manufactured in both light and heavy-barrel configurations, with the heavy barrel intended for automatic fire as a section or squad light support weapon. Most heavy barrel FALs are equipped with [[bipod]]s, although some light barrel models were equipped with bipods, such as the Austrian StG58 and the German G1, and a bipod was later made available as an accessory.\n\nAmong other 7.62\u00d751mm NATO battle rifles at the time, the FN FAL had relatively light recoil, due to the user-adjustable gas system being able to be tuned via a regulator in fore-end of the rifle, which allowed for excess gas which would simply increase recoil to bleed off. The regulator is an adjustable gas port opening that adjusts the rifle to function reliably with various propellant and projectile specific pressure behavior, making the FAL not ammunition specific. In fully automatic mode, however, the shooter receives considerable abuse from recoil, and the weapon climbs off-target quickly, making automatic fire only of marginal effectiveness.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Small arms visual encyclopedia|last=J.|first=Dougherty, Martin|publisher=Amber Books|year=2011|isbn=9781907446986|location=London|pages=222|oclc=751804871}}</ref> Many military forces using the FAL eventually eliminated full-automatic firearms training in the light-barrel FAL.\n\n==Variants==<!-- This section is linked from FN FAL -->\n\n===FN production variants===\n\nDepending on the variant and the country of adoption, the FAL was issued as either [[semi-automatic rifle|semi-automatic]] only or [[selective fire|select-fire]] (capable of both semi-automatic and fully automatic firing modes).\n\n====LAR 50.41 & 50.42 (FAL HBAR & FALO)====\n* Also known as FALO as an abbreviation from the French ''Fusil Automatique Lourd'';\n* Heavy barrel for sustained fire with a 30-round magazine as a [[squad automatic weapon]];\n* Known in Canada as the C2A1, it was their primary squad automatic weapon until it was phased out during the 1980s in favor of the [[FN Minimi|C9]], which has better accuracy and higher ammunition capacity than the C2;\n* Known to the Australian Army as the L2A1, it was replaced by the FN Minimi.

British observers in return claimed the experimental American [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|.30-caliber T65 round]] (7.62\u00d751mm) was too powerful to control in automatic fire. Britain was forced to abandon the promising .280 round and adopt the American-designed .30-caliber T65 as the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge. The EM-2 couldn't be rechambered for the longer and more powerful cartridge and the Americans didn't yet have a working service rifle of their own. Britain and Canada adopted the Belgian 7.62mm FN FAL instead as the L1 ''Self-Loading Rifle'' (SLR).\n* '''FAL .280 Experimental Automatic Carbine, Short Model (1951)''': A [[Bullpup|bullpup-frame]] version of the FAL chambered in .280 British designed to compete with the British EM-1 and EM-2 bullpup rifles.

The first 20,000 were manufactured by ''Fabrique Nationale d\u2019Armes de Guerre''-Herstal Belgique, but later the StG58 was manufactured under licence by [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]] (now [[Steyr Mannlicher]]), and was formerly the standard rifle of the [[Austrian Armed Forces|''\u00d6sterreichisches Bundesheer'']] (Austrian Federal Army). It is essentially a user-customized version of the FAL and is still in use, mainly as a drill weapon in the Austrian forces. It was selected in a 1958 competition, beating the Spanish [[CETME]] and American [[Armalite AR-10|AR-10]].\n\n[[File:West German FN FAL.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Two West German soldiers on a joint exercise in 1960. West Germany used the FN FAL designated as G1.]]\n\nMost StG 58s featured a folding bipod, and differ from the FAL by using a plastic [[stock (firearms)|stock]] rather than wood in order to reduce weight in the later production rifles (although some of the early FN-built production rifles did come with wooden stocks). The rifle can be distinguished from its Belgian and Argentine counterparts by its combination [[flash suppressor]] and [[grenade launcher]]. The foregrip was a two-part steel pressing.\n\nSteyr-built StG 58s had a hammer forged barrel that was considered to be the best barrel fitted to any FAL. Some StG58s had modifications made to the fire mode selector so that the fully automatic option was removed, leaving the selector with only safe and single-shot positions. The StG 58 was replaced by the [[Steyr AUG]] in 1977, although the StG 58 served with many units as the primary service rifle through the mid-1980s.\n\n====Olin/Winchester FAL====\nA semi-automatic, twin-barrel variant chambered in the 5.56mm Duplex round during [[Project SALVO]].

It comes with a 406&nbsp;mm (16&nbsp;in), 457&nbsp;mm (18&nbsp;in) or 533&nbsp;mm (21&nbsp;in) barrel, an [[Hiduminium|aluminum-alloy]] lower receiver, and improved [[Glass-filled polymer|Glass-filled]] [[Nylon]] furniture. Civilian models are semi-automatic, but military and Law Enforcement clients can procure select-fire models that have a fully automatic [[cyclic rate]] of 750 rounds/minute. The DSA-58 can use any metric-measurement FAL magazines, which come in 5, 10, 20 or 30-round capacities.\n* The '''DSA-58 OSW (''Operational Specialist Weapon'')''' is an assault carbine version of the paratrooper model of the FAL. It has a side-folding Enhanced PARA polymer stock, shorter 279&nbsp;mm (11 inch) or 330&nbsp;mm (13 inch) barrel and an optional full-auto setting.\n* The '''DSA-58 CTC (''Compact Tactical Carbine'')''' is a carbine version of the FAL.

The FAL was also exported to many other countries, such as [[Venezuela]], where a small-arms industry produces some basically unchanged variants, as well as ammunition. By modern standards, one disadvantage of the FAL is the amount of work which goes into machining the complex receiver, bolt and bolt carrier. Some theorized that the movement of the tilting bolt mechanism tends to return differently with each shot, affecting inherent accuracy of the weapon, but this has been proven to be false. The FAL's receiver is machined, while most other modern military rifles use quicker stamping or casting techniques. Modern FALs have many improvements over those produced by FN and others in the mid-20th-century.\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:Armamento - Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n 19.JPG|thumb|Weapons in the [[Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n]], [[Buenos Aires]]]]\n\nThe Argentine Armed Forces officially adopted the FN FAL in 1955, but the first FN made examples did not arrive in Argentina until the autumn of 1958. Subsequently, in 1960, licensed production of FALs began and continued until the mid-to-late 1990s, when production ceased. In 2010, a project to modernize all existing FAL and to produce an unknown number of them was approved. This project was called FAL M5.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nArgentine FALs were produced by the government-owned arsenal FM (Fabricaciones Militares) at the F\u00e1brica Militar de Armas Port\u00e1tiles \"Domingo Matheu\" (FMAP \"DM\") in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]]. The acronym \"FAL\" was kept, its translation being \"Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Liviano\", (Light Automatic Rifle). Production weapons included \"Standard\" and \"Para\" (folding buttstock) versions. Military rifles were produced with the full auto fire option. The rifles were usually known as the FM FAL, for the \"Fabricaciones Militares\" brand name (FN and FM have a long-standing licensing and manufacturing agreement). A heavy barrel version, known as the ''FAP'' (''Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Pesado'', or heavy automatic rifle) was also produced for the armed forces, to be used as a squad automatic weapon. The Argentine 'heavy barrel' FAL, also used by several other nations, was found to frequently experience a failure to feed after firing two rounds from a full magazine when in automatic mode.\n\n[[Image:Bayoneta de FAL.JPG|thumb|left|150px|FAL [[bayonet]].]]\n\nA version of the FALMP III chambered in the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] cartridge was developed in the early 1980s. It used M16 type magazines but one version called the FALMP III 5.56mm Type 2 used [[Steyr AUG]] magazines. The [[FARA 83]] (Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Rep\u00fablica Argentina) was to replace the Argentine military's FAL rifles. The design borrowed features from the FAL such as the gas system and folding stock. It seems to have been also influenced to some degree by other rifles (the Beretta AR70/223, M16, and the [[IMI Galil|Galil]]). An estimated quantity of between 2,500 and 3,000 examples were produced for field testing, but military spending cuts killed the project in the mid-1980s.\n\nThere was also a semi-automatic\u2013only version, the ''FSL'', intended for the civilian market. Legislation changes in 1995 (namely, the enactment of ''Presidential Decree N\u00ba 64/95'') imposed a ''[[de facto]]'' ban on \"semi-automatic assault weapons\". Today, it can take up to two years to obtain a permit for the ownership of an FSL. The FSL was offered with full or folding stocks, plastic furniture and orthoptic sights.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n[[File:Soldadosargesperandodesembarco.jpg|thumb|right|Argentine soldiers armed with FAL, Falklands War]]\n\nArgentine FALs saw action during the [[Falklands War]] (Falklands-Malvinas/South Atlantic War), and in different peace-keeping operations such as in Cyprus and the former Yugoslavia. Rosario-made FALs are known to have been exported to Bolivia (in 1971), Colombia, Croatia (during the wars in former Yugoslavia during the 1990s), Honduras, Nigeria (this is unconfirmed, most Nigerian FALs are from FN in Belgium or are British-made L1A1s), Peru, and Uruguay (which reportedly took delivery of some Brazilian IMBEL-made FALs as well).{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Deactivated Argentinean FALs from the many thousands captured during the Falklands War are used by UK forces as part of the soldier's load on some training courses run over public land in the UK.\n\nThe [[Argentine Marine Corps]], a branch of the Argentine Navy, has replaced the FN/FM FAL in front line units, adopting the U.S. M16A2. The Argentine Army has expressed its desire to acquire at least 1,500 new rifles chambered for the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO SS109/U.S. M855 (.223 Remington) cartridge, to be used primarily by its peacekeeping troops on overseas deployments.\n\nThe US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) secretly purchased several thousand Argentine FAL rifles in 1981, which were supplied to the Nicaraguan [[Contras]] rebel group. These rifles have since appeared throughout Central America in use with other organizations.\n\nThese rifles are currently being modernized to a new standard, the FAL M5 (or FAL V), which uses polymer parts to reduce weight, and has [[Picatinny rails]] and optic mounts for carrying accessories, that created these variants:\n* '''FAMTD''': ''Fusil Argentino Modelo Tirador Destacado - Ca\u00f1\u00f3n Pesado'' (Argentine Designated Marksman Rifle - Heavy Barrel), [[Designated marksman rifle|DMR]] variant.

Troop field testing was performed with FN made FALs between 1958 and 1962. Then, in 1964, Brazil officially adopted the rifle, designating the rifle M964 for 1964. Licensed production started shortly thereafter at the ''[[IMBEL|Ind\u00fastria de Material B\u00e9lico do Brasil]]'' (IMBEL), in [[Itajub\u00e1]] in the state of [[Minas Gerais]]. The folding stock version was designated M964A1. By the late 1980s/early 1990s, IMBEL had manufactured some 200,000 M964 rifles. Later Brazilian made FALs have Type 3, hammer forged receivers. Early FN made FALs for Brazil are typical FN 1964 models with Type 1 or Type 2 receivers, plastic stock, handguard, and pistol grip, 22&nbsp;mm cylindrical flash hider for grenade launching, and plastic model \"D\" carrying handle. Brazilian-made FALs are thought to have been exported to Uruguay. A heavy barrel version, known as the FAP (Fuzil Autom\u00e1tico Pesado, or heavy automatic rifle) was also produced for the armed forces, to be used as a squad automatic weapon.[[File:Combatente da Caatinga (26607172042).jpg|left|thumb|[[Caatinga]] soldier of the Brazilian Army.]]\nBrazil's planned service weapon was a development of the FAL in 5.56\u00d745mm. Known as the MD-2 and MD-3 assault rifles, it was also manufactured by IMBEL. The first prototype, the MD-1, came out around 1983. In 1985, the MD-2 was presented and adopted by the [[Military Police]]. Its new 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambering aside, the MD-2/MD-3 is still very similar to the FAL and externally resembles it, changes include a change in the locking system, which was replaced by an M16-type rotating bolt. The MD-2 and MD-3 use [[STANAG magazine]]s, but have different buttstocks. The MD-2 features an FN 50.63 'para' side-folding stock, while the MD-3 uses the same fixed polymer stock of the standard FAL.\n\nHowever, Brazil's current service weapon is a Brazilian FAL-based assault rifle in 5.56\u00d745mm and 7.62\u00d751mm versions, with Assault Rifle and Carbine variants, including a Sniper and CQB rifle, called the [[IMBEL A2|IA2]], also produced by IMBEL.\n\nAlong with the IA2, MD-2 and MD-3 assault rifles, Brazil produces the M964A1/Pelopes (Special Operations Platoon), with an 11\" barrel, 3-point sling and a [[Picatinny rail]] with a [[tactical flashlight]] and sight.<ref>BASTOS, Carlos Stephani.

These weapons were intended for the ''[[German Federal Police|Bundesgrenzschutz]]'' (border guard) and not the nascent ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' (army), which at the time used M1 Garands and M1/M2 carbines. In November 1956, however, West Germany ordered 100,000 additional FALs, designated the G1, for the army. FN made the rifles between April 1957 and May 1958. G1s served in the West German ''Bundeswehr'' for a relatively short time in the late 1950s and early 1960s, before they were replaced by the Spanish [[CETME]] Modelo 58 rifle in 1959 (which was extensively reworked into the later [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]] rifle). The G1 featured a pressed metal handguard identical to the ones used on the Austrian Stg. 58, as well as the Dutch and Greek FALs, this being slightly slimmer than the standard wood or plastic handguards, and featuring horizontal lines running almost their entire length. G1s were also fitted with a unique removable prong flash hider, adding another external distinction. The main reason for the replacement of the G1 in Germany was the refusal of the Belgians to grant a license for production of the weapon in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/weapons/index.php/tour-by-region/europe/europe/firearm-379/index.html|title=Europe|website=web.prm.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2017-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427012535/http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/weapons/index.php/tour-by-region/europe/europe/firearm-379/index.html|archive-date=2017-04-27|url-status=live}}</ref> Many G1 FALs were passed on to Turkey after their withdrawal from German service.

Note the hinged butt plate.]]\n\nAfter the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) had to overcome several [[Military logistics|logistics problems]] which were a result of the wide variety of old firearms that were in service. In 1955 the IDF adopted the [[Israel Military Industries|IMI]]-produced [[Uzi]] submachine gun. To replace the German [[Karabiner 98k|Mauser Kar 98k]] and some British [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles, the IDF decided in the same year to adopt the FN FAL as its standard-issue infantry rifle, under the name ''Rov've Mitta'enn'' or ''Romat'' (\u05e8\u05d5\u05de\"\u05d8), an abbreviation of \"Self-Loading Rifle\". The FAL version ordered by the IDF came in two basic variants, both regular and heavy-barrel (automatic rifle), and were chambered for 7.62mm NATO ammunition. In common with heavy-barrel FALs used by several other nations, the Israeli 'heavy barrel' FAL (called the ''Makle'a Kal'', or ''Makleon'') was found to frequently experience a failure to feed after firing two rounds from a full magazine when in automatic mode. The Israeli FALs were originally produced as selective-fire rifles, though later light-barrel rifle versions were altered to semi-automatic fire only. The Israeli models are recognizable by a distinctive handguard with a forward perforated sheet metal section, and a rear wood section unlike most other FALs in shape, and their higher 'Commonwealth'-type sights. Israel has been a keen user of rifle grenades, in particular the [[BT/AT 52|AT 52]] which is often seen in photographs with the FAL.<ref name=\"Cashner2013gren\">{{harvnb|Cashner|2013|pp=21\u201322|ps=:\"''The IDF has long been fond of the rifle grenade. For night assaults on prepared defensive positions, Israeli infantry often crept to within rifle grenade range. The assault was started with a volley of grenades onto the enemy positions intended to stun them and put their heads down, immediately followed by the infantry assault before their opponents could recover... As far back as the 1960s, S.L.A. Marshall noted: \"Israel's infantry prefers the rifle-fired antitank grenade to the bazooka for shock effect on a group or bunker. At night, if the section should run into an ambush, the grenadier fires, and the others rush straight in, not firing\"''\"}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bukvoed.livejournal.com/274610.html?thread=2172850 |title=Images of Israeli use of rifle grenades from 1956 onwards|date = 24 October 2014| accessdate = 22 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Israeli FAL first saw action in relatively small quantities during the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956, the [[Six-Day War]] in June 1967, the [[War of Attrition]] of 1967 until 1970, it was the standard Israeli rifle. During the [[Yom Kippur War]] of October 1973 it was still in front-line service as the standard Israeli rifle, though increasing criticism eventually led to the phasing-out of the weapon.

The FAL was originally designed to handle intermediate cartridges, but in an attempt to secure US favor for the rifle, the FAL was redesigned to use the newly developed 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge. The US tested several variants of the FAL to replace the M1 Garand. These rifles were tested against the T44, essentially an updated version of the basic Garand design.<ref name=\"STE\">Stevens, R.

The rifles were imported to the United States as fully automatic guns. Once in the U.S., the FAL's were \"de-militarized\" (upper receiver destroyed) to eliminate the rifles' character as an automatic rifle, as stipulated by the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] (GCA 68 currently prohibits the importation of foreign-made full-automatic rifles prior to the enactment of the Gun Control Act; semiautomatic versions of the same firearm were legal to import until the Semiautomatic Assault Rifle Ban of 1989). Thousands of the resulting \"parts kits\" were sold at generally low prices ($90 \u2013 $250) to hobbyists. The hobbyists rebuilt the parts kits to legal and functional semi-automatic rifles on new semi-automatic upper receivers. FAL rifles are still commercially available from a few domestic firms in semi-auto configuration: Entreprise Arms, DSArms, and [[Century International Arms]]. Century Arms created a semi-automatic version L1A1 with an [[IMBEL]] upper receiver and surplus British [[Royal Small Arms Factory|Enfield]] inch-pattern parts, while DSArms used Steyr-style metric-pattern FAL designs (this standard-metric difference means the Century Arms and DSArms firearms are not made from fully interchangeable batches of parts).\n\n===Venezuela===\nUntil recently, the FAL was the main service rifle of the Venezuelan army, made under license by [[CAVIM]].<ref name=\"CAVIM\">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/asmp/library/articles/PIR_Winter_2007_Recurrent.pdf|title=A Recurrent Latin American Nightmare|accessdate=2010-04-01|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]|author=Pablo Dreyfus|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613045713/http://fas.org/asmp/library/articles/PIR_Winter_2007_Recurrent.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-13|url-status=live}}</ref> The first batch of rifles to arrive in Venezuela were chambered in [[.280 British#Variants|7\u00d749mm]] (also known as 7&nbsp;mm Liviano or 7&nbsp;mm Venezuelan). Essentially a [[7\u00d757mm]] round shortened to intermediate length, this caliber was jointly developed by Venezuelan and Belgian engineers motivated by a global move towards intermediate calibers. The Venezuelans, who had been exclusively using the 7\u00d757mm round in their light and medium weapons since the turn of the 20th century, felt it was a perfect platform on which to base a calibre tailored to the particular rigours of the Venezuelan terrain.\n\nEventually the plan was dropped despite having ordered millions of rounds and thousands of weapons of this caliber. As the Cold War escalated, the military command felt it necessary to align with NATO despite not being a member, resulting in the adoption of the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge and the rechambering of the 5,000 or so FAL rifles that had already arrived in 7\u00d749mm by 1955-56.\n\nVenezuela has bought 100,000 [[AK-103]] assault rifles from Russia in order to replace the old FALs.<ref name=\"CAVIM\"/> Although the full shipment arrived by the end of 2006, the FAL will remain in service with the Venezuelan Reserve Forces and the Territorial Guard.\n\n==Conflicts==\n[[File:Patrol Kenya.jpg|thumb|[[British Army]] patrol crossing a stream during the [[Mau Mau rebellion]].

The [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] variant of the FAL was redesigned from FN's [[metre|metrical]] FAL into British [[imperial units]] and was produced under licence as the [[L1A1 Self-Loading Rifle]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1946, the first FAL prototype was completed. It was designed to fire the intermediate [[7.92\u00d733mm Kurz]] cartridge developed and used by the forces of [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] during [[World War II]] (with the [[Sturmgewehr 44]] [[assault rifle]]). After testing this prototype in 1948, the [[British Army]] urged FN to build additional prototypes, including one in [[bullpup]] configuration, chambered for their new [[.280 British]] [7x43mm] caliber intermediate cartridge.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\">{{cite web|url=http://world.guns.ru/assault/as24f-e.htm|title=FN FAL (Belgium)|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141117172148/http://world.guns.ru/assault/as24f-e.htm|archive-date=17 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> After evaluating the single bullpup prototype, FN decided to return instead to their original, conventional design for future production.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\"/>\n\nIn 1950, the United Kingdom presented the redesigned FN rifle and the British [[EM-2 rifle|EM-2]], both in .280 British calibre, to the United States for comparison testing against the favoured [[United States Army]] design of the time\u2014Earle Harvey's T25.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powmadeak47.com/rifle/t25.html|title=Earl Harvey's T-25 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325165934/http://www.powmadeak47.com/rifle/t25.html |archivedate= 25 March 2012|work=powmadeak47.com}}</ref> It was hoped that a common cartridge and rifle could be standardized for issue to the armies of all NATO member countries. After this testing was completed, U.S. Army officials suggested that FN should redesign their rifle to fire the U.S. prototype \".30 Light Rifle\" cartridge. FN decided to hedge their bets with the U.S., and in 1951 even made a deal that the U.S. could produce FALs royalty-free, given that the UK appeared to be favouring their own EM-2.\n\nThis decision appeared to be correct when the British Army decided to adopt the EM-2 (as Rifle No.9 Mk1) and .280 British cartridge.<ref name=\"FN FAL Belgium\"/> This decision was later rescinded after the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] lost the 1951 General Election and [[Winston Churchill]] returned as Prime Minister. It is believed{{by whom|date=December 2014}} that there was a [[quid pro quo]] agreement between Churchill and U.S. President [[Harry Truman]] in 1952 that the British accept the .30 Light Rifle cartridge as NATO standard in return for the U.S. acceptance of the FN FAL as NATO standard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-fn-fal-was-almost-americas-battle-rifle-5186bdbda998|title=The FN FAL Was Almost America's Battle Rifle|first=War Is|last=Boring|date=5 October 2014|access-date=28 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506202808/https://medium.com/war-is-boring/the-fn-fal-was-almost-americas-battle-rifle-5186bdbda998|archive-date=6 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The .30 Light Rifle cartridge was in fact later standardized as the 7.62&nbsp;mm NATO; however, the U.S. insisted on continued rifle tests. The FAL chambered for the .30 Light Rifle went up against the redesigned T25 (now redesignated as the T47), and an M1 Garand variant, the T44. Eventually, the T44 won, becoming the [[M14 rifle|M14]]. However, in the meantime, most other NATO countries were evaluating and selecting the FAL.\n\nFN created what is possibly the classic post-war [[battle rifle]]. Formally introduced by its designer [[Dieudonn\u00e9 Saive]] in 1951, and produced two years later, it has been described as the \"Right Arm of the Free World.\"{{sfn|Cashner|2013|p=5}} The FAL battle rifle has its [[Warsaw Pact]] counterpart in the [[AKM]], each being fielded by dozens of countries and produced in many of them. A few, such as Israel and South Africa, manufactured and issued both designs at various times. Unlike the Soviet AKM assault rifle, the FAL utilized a heavier full-power [[rifle]] [[cartridge (weaponry)|cartridge]].\n\n==Design details==\n[[File:PISTONM16.gif|thumb|left|[[Gas-operated reloading#Short-stroke piston|Short-stroke]] gas piston, the action used on the FAL.]]\n[[File:L1A1 FIELD STRIPPED.jpg|thumb|left|L1A1 British FAL variant field stripped.]]\n\nThe FAL operates by means of a [[gas-operated]] [[Firearm action|action]] very similar to that of the Russian [[SVT-40]]. The gas system is driven by a short-stroke, spring-loaded piston housed above the [[Gun barrel|barrel]], and the locking mechanism is what is known as a ''tilting breechblock''. To lock, it drops down into a solid shoulder of metal in the heavy [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]] much like the [[Bolt (firearm)|bolts]] of the Russian [[SKS]] [[carbine]] and French [[MAS-49]] series of semi-automatic rifles. The gas system is fitted with a gas regulator behind the front sight base, allowing adjustment of the gas system in response to environmental conditions. The piston system can be bypassed completely, using the gas plug, to allow for the firing of [[rifle grenade]]s and manual operation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/1457/tuning-the-fals-gas-system/|title=Tuning the FAL's Gas System|accessdate=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140112160722/http://www.shootingillustrated.com/index.php/1457/tuning-the-fals-gas-system/|archive-date=12 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The FAL's magazine capacity ranges from five to 30 rounds, with most magazines holding 20 rounds. In fixed [[Stock (firearms)|stock]] versions of the FAL, the [[recoil]] spring is housed in the stock, while in folding-stock versions it is housed in the receiver cover, necessitating a slightly different receiver cover, recoil spring, and bolt carrier, and a modified lower receiver for the stock.<ref name=\"popeneker\">Popeneker, Maxim & Williams, Anthony (2005). ''Assault Rifle''. The Crowood Press Ltd. {{ISBN|1-86126-700-2}}.</ref>\nFor field stripping the FAL can be opened. During opening the rifle pivots between the trigger guard and magazine well to give access to the action and piston system. This opening method causes a suboptimal iron sight line as the rear and front sight elements of the sight line are fixed to two different movable subassemblies. The sight radius for the FAL 50.00 and FAL 50.41 models is {{cvt|553|mm|1}} and for the 50.61 and FAL 50.63 models {{cvt|549|mm|in|1}}.\n \nFAL rifles have also been manufactured in both light and heavy-barrel configurations, with the heavy barrel intended for automatic fire as a section or squad light support weapon. Most heavy barrel FALs are equipped with [[bipod]]s, although some light barrel models were equipped with bipods, such as the Austrian StG58 and the German G1, and a bipod was later made available as an accessory.\n\nAmong other 7.62\u00d751mm NATO battle rifles at the time, the FN FAL had relatively light recoil, due to the user-adjustable gas system being able to be tuned via a regulator in fore-end of the rifle, which allowed for excess gas which would simply increase recoil to bleed off. The regulator is an adjustable gas port opening that adjusts the rifle to function reliably with various propellant and projectile specific pressure behavior, making the FAL not ammunition specific. In fully automatic mode, however, the shooter receives considerable abuse from recoil, and the weapon climbs off-target quickly, making automatic fire only of marginal effectiveness.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Small arms visual encyclopedia|last=J.|first=Dougherty, Martin|publisher=Amber Books|year=2011|isbn=9781907446986|location=London|pages=222|oclc=751804871}}</ref> Many military forces using the FAL eventually eliminated full-automatic firearms training in the light-barrel FAL.\n\n==Variants==<!-- This section is linked from FN FAL -->\n\n===FN production variants===\n\nDepending on the variant and the country of adoption, the FAL was issued as either [[semi-automatic rifle|semi-automatic]] only or [[selective fire|select-fire]] (capable of both semi-automatic and fully automatic firing modes).\n\n====LAR 50.41 & 50.42 (FAL HBAR & FALO)====\n* Also known as FALO as an abbreviation from the French ''Fusil Automatique Lourd'';\n* Heavy barrel for sustained fire with a 30-round magazine as a [[squad automatic weapon]];\n* Known in Canada as the C2A1, it was their primary squad automatic weapon until it was phased out during the 1980s in favor of the [[FN Minimi|C9]], which has better accuracy and higher ammunition capacity than the C2;\n* Known to the Australian Army as the L2A1, it was replaced by the FN Minimi.

Although the [[EM-2 rifle|EM-2]] \"bullpup\" did well, American observers protested that the small-bore .280-caliber round lacked the power and range of a medium-bore .30-caliber round. British observers in return claimed the experimental American [[7.62\u00d751mm NATO|.30-caliber T65 round]] [7.62\u00d751mm] was too powerful to control in automatic fire. Britain was forced to abandon the promising .280 round and adopt the American-designed .30-caliber T65 as the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge. The EM-2 couldn't be rechambered for the longer and more powerful cartridge and the Americans didn't yet have a working service rifle of their own.

The first 20,000 were manufactured by ''Fabrique Nationale d\u2019Armes de Guerre''-Herstal Belgique, but later the StG58 was manufactured under licence by [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]] (now [[Steyr Mannlicher]]), and was formerly the standard rifle of the [[Austrian Armed Forces|''\u00d6sterreichisches Bundesheer'']] (Austrian Federal Army). It is essentially a user-customized version of the FAL and is still in use, mainly as a drill weapon in the Austrian forces. It was selected in a 1958 competition, beating the Spanish [[CETME]] and American [[Armalite AR-10|AR-10]].\n\n[[File:West German FN FAL.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Two West German soldiers on a joint exercise in 1960. West Germany used the FN FAL designated as G1.]]\n\nMost StG 58s featured a folding bipod, and differ from the FAL by using a plastic [[stock (firearms)|stock]] rather than wood in order to reduce weight in the later production rifles (although some of the early FN-built production rifles did come with wooden stocks). The rifle can be distinguished from its Belgian and Argentine counterparts by its combination [[flash suppressor]] and [[grenade launcher]]. The foregrip was a two-part steel pressing.\n\nSteyr-built StG 58s had a hammer forged barrel that was considered to be the best barrel fitted to any FAL. Some StG58s had modifications made to the fire mode selector so that the fully automatic option was removed, leaving the selector with only safe and single-shot positions. The StG 58 was replaced by the [[Steyr AUG]] in 1977, although the StG 58 served with many units as the primary service rifle through the mid-1980s.\n\n====Olin/Winchester FAL====\nA semi-automatic, twin-barrel variant chambered in the 5.56mm Duplex round during [[Project SALVO]].

It comes with a 406&nbsp;mm (16&nbsp;in), 457&nbsp;mm (18&nbsp;in) or 533&nbsp;mm (21&nbsp;in) barrel, an [[Hiduminium|aluminum-alloy]] lower receiver, and improved [[Glass-filled polymer|Glass-filled]] [[Nylon]] furniture. Civilian models are semi-automatic, but military and Law Enforcement clients can procure select-fire models that have a fully automatic [[cyclic rate]] of 750 rounds/minute. The DSA-58 can use any metric-measurement FAL magazines, which come in 5, 10, 20 or 30-round capacities.\n* The '''DSA-58 OSW (''Operational Specialist Weapon'')''' is an assault carbine version of the paratrooper model of the FAL.

The FAL was also exported to many other countries, such as [[Venezuela]], where a small-arms industry produces some basically unchanged variants, as well as ammunition. By modern standards, one disadvantage of the FAL is the amount of work which goes into machining the complex receiver, bolt and bolt carrier. Some theorized that the movement of the tilting bolt mechanism tends to return differently with each shot, affecting inherent accuracy of the weapon, but this has been proven to be false. The FAL's receiver is machined, while most other modern military rifles use quicker stamping or casting techniques. Modern FALs have many improvements over those produced by FN and others in the mid-20th-century.\n\n===Argentina===\n[[File:Armamento - Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n 19.JPG|thumb|Weapons in the [[Museo de Armas de la Naci\u00f3n]], [[Buenos Aires]]]]\n\nThe Argentine Armed Forces officially adopted the FN FAL in 1955, but the first FN made examples did not arrive in Argentina until the autumn of 1958. Subsequently, in 1960, licensed production of FALs began and continued until the mid-to-late 1990s, when production ceased. In 2010, a project to modernize all existing FAL and to produce an unknown number of them was approved. This project was called FAL M5.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nArgentine FALs were produced by the government-owned arsenal FM (Fabricaciones Militares) at the F\u00e1brica Militar de Armas Port\u00e1tiles \"Domingo Matheu\" (FMAP \"DM\") in [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]]. The acronym \"FAL\" was kept, its translation being \"Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Liviano\", (Light Automatic Rifle). Production weapons included \"Standard\" and \"Para\" (folding buttstock) versions. Military rifles were produced with the full auto fire option. The rifles were usually known as the FM FAL, for the \"Fabricaciones Militares\" brand name (FN and FM have a long-standing licensing and manufacturing agreement). A heavy barrel version, known as the ''FAP'' (''Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Pesado'', or heavy automatic rifle) was also produced for the armed forces, to be used as a squad automatic weapon. The Argentine 'heavy barrel' FAL, also used by several other nations, was found to frequently experience a failure to feed after firing two rounds from a full magazine when in automatic mode.\n\n[[Image:Bayoneta de FAL.JPG|thumb|left|150px|FAL [[bayonet]].]]\n\nA version of the FALMP III chambered in the [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] cartridge was developed in the early 1980s. It used M16 type magazines but one version called the FALMP III 5.56mm Type 2 used [[Steyr AUG]] magazines. The [[FARA 83]] (Fusil Autom\u00e1tico Rep\u00fablica Argentina) was to replace the Argentine military's FAL rifles. The design borrowed features from the FAL such as the gas system and folding stock. It seems to have been also influenced to some degree by other rifles (the Beretta AR70/223, M16, and the [[IMI Galil|Galil]]). An estimated quantity of between 2,500 and 3,000 examples were produced for field testing, but military spending cuts killed the project in the mid-1980s.\n\nThere was also a semi-automatic\u2013only version, the ''FSL'', intended for the civilian market. Legislation changes in 1995 (namely, the enactment of ''Presidential Decree N\u00ba 64/95'') imposed a ''[[de facto]]'' ban on \"semi-automatic assault weapons\". Today, it can take up to two years to obtain a permit for the ownership of an FSL. The FSL was offered with full or folding stocks, plastic furniture and orthoptic sights.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\n[[File:Soldadosargesperandodesembarco.jpg|thumb|right|Argentine soldiers armed with FAL, Falklands War]]\n\nArgentine FALs saw action during the [[Falklands War]] (Falklands-Malvinas/South Atlantic War), and in different peace-keeping operations such as in Cyprus and the former Yugoslavia. Rosario-made FALs are known to have been exported to Bolivia (in 1971), Colombia, Croatia (during the wars in former Yugoslavia during the 1990s), Honduras, Nigeria (this is unconfirmed, most Nigerian FALs are from FN in Belgium or are British-made L1A1s), Peru, and Uruguay (which reportedly took delivery of some Brazilian IMBEL-made FALs as well).{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Deactivated Argentinean FALs from the many thousands captured during the Falklands War are used by UK forces as part of the soldier's load on some training courses run over public land in the UK.\n\nThe [[Argentine Marine Corps]], a branch of the Argentine Navy, has replaced the FN/FM FAL in front line units, adopting the U.S. M16A2. The Argentine Army has expressed its desire to acquire at least 1,500 new rifles chambered for the 5.56\u00d745mm NATO SS109/U.S. M855 (.223 Remington) cartridge, to be used primarily by its peacekeeping troops on overseas deployments.\n\nThe US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) secretly purchased several thousand Argentine FAL rifles in 1981, which were supplied to the Nicaraguan [[Contras]] rebel group. These rifles have since appeared throughout Central America in use with other organizations.\n\nThese rifles are currently being modernized to a new standard, the FAL M5 (or FAL V), which uses polymer parts to reduce weight, and has [[Picatinny rails]] and optic mounts for carrying accessories, that created these variants:\n* '''FAMTD''': ''Fusil Argentino Modelo Tirador Destacado - Ca\u00f1\u00f3n Pesado'' (Argentine Designated Marksman Rifle - Heavy Barrel), [[Designated marksman rifle|DMR]] variant.

Troop field testing was performed with FN made FALs between 1958 and 1962. Then, in 1964, Brazil officially adopted the rifle, designating the rifle M964 for 1964. Licensed production started shortly thereafter at the ''[[IMBEL|Ind\u00fastria de Material B\u00e9lico do Brasil]]'' (IMBEL), in [[Itajub\u00e1]] in the state of [[Minas Gerais]]. The folding stock version was designated M964A1. By the late 1980s/early 1990s, IMBEL had manufactured some 200,000 M964 rifles. Later Brazilian made FALs have Type 3, hammer forged receivers. Early FN made FALs for Brazil are typical FN 1964 models with Type 1 or Type 2 receivers, plastic stock, handguard, and pistol grip, 22&nbsp;mm cylindrical flash hider for grenade launching, and plastic model \"D\" carrying handle. Brazilian-made FALs are thought to have been exported to Uruguay. A heavy barrel version, known as the FAP (Fuzil Autom\u00e1tico Pesado, or heavy automatic rifle) was also produced for the armed forces, to be used as a squad automatic weapon.[[File:Combatente da Caatinga (26607172042).jpg|left|thumb|[[Caatinga]] soldier of the Brazilian Army.]]\nBrazil's planned service weapon was a development of the FAL in 5.56\u00d745mm. Known as the MD-2 and MD-3 assault rifles, it was also manufactured by IMBEL. The first prototype, the MD-1, came out around 1983. In 1985, the MD-2 was presented and adopted by the [[Military Police]]. Its new 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambering aside, the MD-2/MD-3 is still very similar to the FAL and externally resembles it, changes include a change in the locking system, which was replaced by an M16-type rotating bolt. The MD-2 and MD-3 use [[STANAG magazine]]s, but have different buttstocks. The MD-2 features an FN 50.63 'para' side-folding stock, while the MD-3 uses the same fixed polymer stock of the standard FAL.\n\nHowever, Brazil's current service weapon is a Brazilian FAL-based assault rifle in 5.56\u00d745mm and 7.62\u00d751mm versions, with Assault Rifle and Carbine variants, including a Sniper and CQB rifle, called the [[IMBEL A2|IA2]], also produced by IMBEL.\n\nAlong with the IA2, MD-2 and MD-3 assault rifles, Brazil produces the M964A1/Pelopes (Special Operations Platoon), with an 11\" barrel, 3-point sling and a [[Picatinny rail]] with a [[tactical flashlight]] and sight.<ref>BASTOS, Carlos Stephani.

These weapons were intended for the ''[[German Federal Police|Bundesgrenzschutz]]'' (border guard) and not the nascent ''[[Bundeswehr]]'' (army), which at the time used M1 Garands and M1/M2 carbines. In November 1956, however, West Germany ordered 100,000 additional FALs, designated the G1, for the army. FN made the rifles between April 1957 and May 1958. G1s served in the West German ''Bundeswehr'' for a relatively short time in the late 1950s and early 1960s, before they were replaced by the Spanish [[CETME]] Modelo 58 rifle in 1959 (which was extensively reworked into the later [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3]] rifle). The G1 featured a pressed metal handguard identical to the ones used on the Austrian Stg. 58, as well as the Dutch and Greek FALs, this being slightly slimmer than the standard wood or plastic handguards, and featuring horizontal lines running almost their entire length. G1s were also fitted with a unique removable prong flash hider, adding another external distinction. The main reason for the replacement of the G1 in Germany was the refusal of the Belgians to grant a license for production of the weapon in Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/weapons/index.php/tour-by-region/europe/europe/firearm-379/index.html|title=Europe|website=web.prm.ox.ac.uk|access-date=2017-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170427012535/http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/weapons/index.php/tour-by-region/europe/europe/firearm-379/index.html|archive-date=2017-04-27|url-status=live}}</ref> Many G1 FALs were passed on to Turkey after their withdrawal from German service.

Note the hinged butt plate.]]\n\nAfter the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War]], the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] (IDF) had to overcome several [[Military logistics|logistics problems]] which were a result of the wide variety of old firearms that were in service. In 1955 the IDF adopted the [[Israel Military Industries|IMI]]-produced [[Uzi]] submachine gun. To replace the German [[Karabiner 98k|Mauser Kar 98k]] and some British [[Lee\u2013Enfield]] rifles, the IDF decided in the same year to adopt the FN FAL as its standard-issue infantry rifle, under the name ''Rov've Mitta'enn'' or ''Romat'' (\u05e8\u05d5\u05de\"\u05d8), an abbreviation of \"Self-Loading Rifle\". The FAL version ordered by the IDF came in two basic variants, both regular and heavy-barrel (automatic rifle), and were chambered for 7.62mm NATO ammunition. In common with heavy-barrel FALs used by several other nations, the Israeli 'heavy barrel' FAL (called the ''Makle'a Kal'', or ''Makleon'') was found to frequently experience a failure to feed after firing two rounds from a full magazine when in automatic mode. The Israeli FALs were originally produced as selective-fire rifles, though later light-barrel rifle versions were altered to semi-automatic fire only. The Israeli models are recognizable by a distinctive handguard with a forward perforated sheet metal section, and a rear wood section unlike most other FALs in shape, and their higher 'Commonwealth'-type sights. Israel has been a keen user of rifle grenades, in particular the [[BT/AT 52|AT 52]] which is often seen in photographs with the FAL.<ref name=\"Cashner2013gren\">{{harvnb|Cashner|2013|pp=21\u201322|ps=:\"''The IDF has long been fond of the rifle grenade.

As far back as the 1960s, S.L.A. Marshall noted: \"Israel's infantry prefers the rifle-fired antitank grenade to the bazooka for shock effect on a group or bunker.

Following that country's [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilateral declaration of independence]] in 1965, new rifles could not be readily procured from the UK, so Belgian FNs and South African R1s were imported instead.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} The older L1s subsequently completed their service with the [[British South Africa Police]] and to a lesser extent territorial troops in the [[Rhodesia Regiment]] .<ref name=\"Fireforce\">{{cite book |last=Chris Cocks|authorlink=|title=Fireforce: One Man's War in the Rhodesian Light Infantry|edition=July 1, 2001|pages=139\u2013141 |publisher=Covos Day|isbn= 1-919874-32-1|date=2002-04-03}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Rhodesian Bush War]], security forces fitted some standard FNs with customised [[flash suppressor]]s to reduce recoil on fully automatic fire. Rhodesian Security Forces seldom ever used the FN on automatic fire and were trained to use a \"double tap\" on semi-automatic in combat, as automatic fire was considered a total waste of ammunition. However, a few soldiers rejected these devices, which they claimed upset the balance of their weapons during close action.<ref name=\"Fireforce\"/> In this theatre, the FN was generally considered superior to the Soviet [[AK-47|Kalashnikovs]] or [[SKS]] carbines carried by communist-backed [[Patriotic Front (Zimbabwe)|PF]] insurgents.<ref name=\"Fireforce\"/>\n\nTrade sanctions and the gradual erosion of South African support in the 1970s led to serious part shortages.<ref name=\"SmithGB\">{{cite book|author= Smith, Ian|title=The Great Betrayal|pages=74\u201375|publisher= Blake Publishing Ltd.|location=London|year=1997|isbn=1-85782-176-9}}</ref> Consequently, shipments of [[Heckler & Koch G3|G3s]] were accepted from Portugal, although the security forces considered these less reliable than the FAL.<ref name=\"Fireforce\"/> Following [[Robert Mugabe]]'s ascension to power in 1980, Rhodesia's remaining FNs were passed on to [[Zimbabwe]], its successor state.<ref name=\"jones2009\">Jones, Richard D.

The FAL was originally designed to handle intermediate cartridges, but in an attempt to secure US favor for the rifle, the FAL was redesigned to use the newly developed 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge. The US tested several variants of the FAL to replace the M1 Garand. These rifles were tested against the T44, essentially an updated version of the basic Garand design.<ref name=\"STE\">Stevens, R.

The rifles were imported to the United States as fully automatic guns. Once in the U.S., the FAL's were \"de-militarized\" (upper receiver destroyed) to eliminate the rifles' character as an automatic rifle, as stipulated by the [[Gun Control Act of 1968]] (GCA 68 currently prohibits the importation of foreign-made full-automatic rifles prior to the enactment of the Gun Control Act; semiautomatic versions of the same firearm were legal to import until the Semiautomatic Assault Rifle Ban of 1989). Thousands of the resulting \"parts kits\" were sold at generally low prices ($90 \u2013 $250) to hobbyists. The hobbyists rebuilt the parts kits to legal and functional semi-automatic rifles on new semi-automatic upper receivers. FAL rifles are still commercially available from a few domestic firms in semi-auto configuration: Entreprise Arms, DSArms, and [[Century International Arms]]. Century Arms created a semi-automatic version L1A1 with an [[IMBEL]] upper receiver and surplus British [[Royal Small Arms Factory|Enfield]] inch-pattern parts, while DSArms used Steyr-style metric-pattern FAL designs (this standard-metric difference means the Century Arms and DSArms firearms are not made from fully interchangeable batches of parts).\n\n===Venezuela===\nUntil recently, the FAL was the main service rifle of the Venezuelan army, made under license by [[CAVIM]].<ref name=\"CAVIM\">{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/asmp/library/articles/PIR_Winter_2007_Recurrent.pdf|title=A Recurrent Latin American Nightmare|accessdate=2010-04-01|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]|author=Pablo Dreyfus|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613045713/http://fas.org/asmp/library/articles/PIR_Winter_2007_Recurrent.pdf|archive-date=2010-06-13|url-status=live}}</ref> The first batch of rifles to arrive in Venezuela were chambered in [[.280 British#Variants|7\u00d749mm]] (also known as 7&nbsp;mm Liviano or 7&nbsp;mm Venezuelan). Essentially a [[7\u00d757mm]] round shortened to intermediate length, this caliber was jointly developed by Venezuelan and Belgian engineers motivated by a global move towards intermediate calibers. The Venezuelans, who had been exclusively using the 7\u00d757mm round in their light and medium weapons since the turn of the 20th century, felt it was a perfect platform on which to base a calibre tailored to the particular rigours of the Venezuelan terrain.\n\nEventually the plan was dropped despite having ordered millions of rounds and thousands of weapons of this caliber. As the Cold War escalated, the military command felt it necessary to align with NATO despite not being a member, resulting in the adoption of the 7.62\u00d751mm NATO cartridge and the rechambering of the 5,000 or so FAL rifles that had already arrived in 7\u00d749mm by 1955-56.\n\nVenezuela has bought 100,000 [[AK-103]] assault rifles from Russia in order to replace the old FALs.<ref name=\"CAVIM\"/> Although the full shipment arrived by the end of 2006, the FAL will remain in service with the Venezuelan Reserve Forces and the Territorial Guard.\n\n==Conflicts==\n[[File:Patrol Kenya.jpg|thumb|[[British Army]] patrol crossing a stream during the [[Mau Mau rebellion]].
