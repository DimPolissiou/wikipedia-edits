Later the word came to denote any weapon which was used by releasing it from one's hand (e.g. an arrow, compared to keeping it one's hand e.g. a sword [shastra]). In Ramayana and Mahabharata, [[Arjuna]] had more number of astras than other warriors.

Because of the power involved, the knowledge involving an ''astra'' was passed in the [[Guru-shishya tradition]] from a [[Guru]] (teacher) to a ''Shishya'' (pupil) by word of mouth alone, and only following the establishment of the student's character. Certain ''astras'' had to be handed down from the [[deity]] involved directly, knowledge of the incantation being insufficient.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Astras in Hindu Epics==\n{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}\n[[File:Arjuna gifted Arrow of Fire to Gandarva.jpg|thumb|Arjuna gifts the Agneyastra to the Gandharva]]\nAstras come into importance mainly in the [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]], where they are used in the great battles described in each epic.

Hazarvi's inspiration from his mentor, [[Ahmed Raza Khan Barelvi]] and non-traditionalist approach to the religion has parted him from traditionalist understanding on a number of issues, but he never goes out of the traditional framework.\n\n===Jihad===\nHazarvi believes that there are certain directives of the [[Qur'an]] pertaining to war which were specific only to [[Muhammad]] and certain specified peoples of his times (particularly the progeny of [[Abraham]]: the [[Ishmaelites]], the [[Israelites]], and the [[Nazarites]]). Thus, Muhammad and his designated followers waged a war against Divinely specified peoples of their time (the [[polytheists]] and the [[Israelites]] and [[Nazarites]] of Arabia and some other Jews, Christians, et al.) as a form of Divine punishment and asked the polytheists of Arabia for submission to Islam as a condition for exoneration and the others for [[jizya]] and submission to the political authority of the Muslims for exemption from death punishment and for military protection as the [[dhimmi]]s of the Muslims. Therefore, after Muhammad and his companions, there is no concept in Islam obliging Muslims to wage war for propagation or implementation of Islam. The only valid basis for [[jihad]] through arms is to end oppression when all other measures have failed.<ref name=\"jihad\">''Mizan'', [http://www.renaissance.com.pk/junespart2y2.html The Islamic Law of Jihad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121083252/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/junespart2y2.html |date=21 November 2008 }}</ref> According to him Jihad can only be waged by an organised Islamic state. No person, party or group can take arms into their hands (for the purpose of waging Jihad) under any circumstances. Another corollary, in his opinion, is that death punishment for [[apostasy]] was also specifically for the recipients of the same Divine punishment during Muhammad's times\u2014for they had persistently denied the truth of Muhammad's mission even after it had been made conclusively evident to them by God through Muhammad.<ref>''[http://www.renaissance.com.pk/septrefl22y2.html Islamic Punishments: Some Misconceptions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205707/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/septrefl22y2.html |date=27 September 2007 }}'', [[Al-Mawrid|Renaissance \u2013 Monthly Islamic Journal]], 12(9), 2002.</ref>\n\nThe formation of an Islamic state is not a religious obligation ''per se'' upon the Muslims.

Thus, Muhammad and his designated followers waged a war against Divinely specified peoples of their time (the [[polytheists]] and the [[Israelites]] and [[Nazarites]] of Arabia and some other Jews, Christians, et al.) as a form of Divine punishment and asked the polytheists of Arabia for submission to Islam as a condition for exoneration and the others for [[jizya]] and submission to the political authority of the Muslims for exemption from death punishment and for military protection as the [[dhimmi]]s of the Muslims. Therefore, after Muhammad and his companions, there is no concept in Islam obliging Muslims to wage war for propagation or implementation of Islam. The only valid basis for [[jihad]] through arms is to end oppression when all other measures have failed.<ref name=\"jihad\">''Mizan'', [http://www.renaissance.com.pk/junespart2y2.html The Islamic Law of Jihad] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121083252/http://www.renaissance.com.pk/junespart2y2.html |date=21 November 2008 }}</ref> According to him Jihad can only be waged by an organised Islamic state.

The sketch was created by show writers Kenny Solms and [[Gail Parent]].<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref> ''The Carol Burnett Show'' introduced the series during its first season in 1967\u201368 and continued to air new installments for the remainder of its 11-season run, through its final season in 1977\u201378. However, the final installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" would not air until September 8, 1979, on a different four-week summer series titled ''Carol Burnett & Company''. This was the only installment of \"As the Stomach Turns\" that did not air on ''The Carol Burnett Show'' which had completed its run almost a year and a half earlier on March 29, 1978.\n\n==Premise==\nThe sketch's premise was to describe, in great detail, the problems of a woman in her 30s named Marion Clayton (played by [[Carol Burnett]]), who lived in the fictional town of Canoga Falls. The first installment aired on the 21st episode of the first season on February 12, 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0536556|title=The Carol Burnett Show (1967\u20131978) Episode #1.21 |author= IMDB|date=|website=|accessdate=April 11, 2017}}</ref> As introduced by [[Lyle Waggoner]], it was supposed to be the final episode of a 15-year long soap opera.<ref>{{cite episode |title=022 |series=The Carol Burnett Show |network=[[CBS]] |date=February 12, 1968}}</ref>\n\nThe sketch dealt with problems that were more likely to be seen on a soap opera than in real life, although many skits were inspired by popular television shows or movies. An example of the latter is a spoof of ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' when Marion's niece Raven (played by guest [[Bernadette Peters]]) came to visit her and was possessed by a devil, Marion assumed, because Raven was such a nice girl normally. Otto Blackflag, the town exterminator, now styling himself as a freelance exorcist (played by [[Tim Conway]] and  using the same faux-Swedish dialect that he would use to play the character [[Mrs. Wiggins|Mr. Tudball]]) exorcised the demon from Raven's body. This same sort of plot was eventually done, in all seriousness, on ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' decades later.\n\nAnother movie parody saw Marion meet the bedraggled \"Richard Dryface,\" played by guest [[Steve Martin]] in a spoof of ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', complete with a grey, bulbous-headed alien played by Conway.\n\nThe sketch also touched on stereotypical aspects of production values in American soaps. Many times, Marion forgot what she wanted to say, reminiscent of the times when soap operas were broadcast live and actors routinely forgot their next line. Marion also answered the door either too soon or too late when someone rang her doorbell. Other times, she would miss the correct time to answer the phone, saying \"Hello\" before the sound effect came for it to ring. On live soap opera productions, these were big problems; due to the live nature of the show, they happened fairly frequently, and were subsequently spoofed at length on ''The Carol Burnett Show''.\n\nIn addition to the missed cues, the sketch was notorious for overusing loud and plangent [[Organ (music)|organ music]], a reference to a time when soap operas would have in-house organists play dramatic music as well as the show's theme song (when this skit first ran, organ music was still in wide use on the serials). Organ music was eventually discontinued in the mid-1970s, around the time ''The Carol Burnett Show'' wrapped up its run, so when the sketch is seen in syndication today, it brings back a sense of production technique that is now seen by many younger soap viewers as archaic and outdated.\n\nOne of the sketch's recurring characters is Marion's \"ne'er-do-well\" daughter (played by [[Vicki Lawrence]]) who arrives at the door holding a baby (a doll), usually says \"Don't you recognize me mother? I'm your daughter,\" then leaves after giving the baby to Marion who immediately stashes it in the umbrella stand.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> This was a parody of the fact that traditional soap operas have little use for child characters, either dropping them from the plot line shortly after they are introduced or [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|unnaturally aging]] them into adulthood or, more recently, into the teenage years (for example, a young character might be sent upstairs to put on his or her shoes and never be referred to again).\n\nThe sketch also marks the first appearances of [[Harvey Korman]]'s Mother Marcus character, who had also become a recurring resident of Canoga Falls, as well as [[Tim Conway]]'s [[The Oldest Man (character)|Oldest Man character]], who within the confines of the series played several characters, including Marion's grandfather, her Uncle Waldo, insurance agent Duane Toddleberry, and obscene phone caller Marvin Peterson Jr.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref>\n\nThe sketch was famous for the parody ending in which the announcer would ask foreboding, progressively nonsensical questions about the characters while focusing on their puzzled reactions.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In her 1996 memoir, \"As My World Still Turns\", actress [[Eileen Fulton]], who has starred on the [[CBS]] soap ''[[As the World Turns]]'' for over four decades, claimed credit for coming up with the concept for \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Fulton stated that when she was contacted to be a guest star on the ''Burnett'' show, she suggested a parody of a soap called \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Ultimately Fulton ended up not appearing on the ''Burnett'' show, but the \"Stomach Turns\" sketch did.<ref>{{cite book|title= As My World Still Turns|last= Fulton|first= Eileen|authorlink= |author2= Atholl, Desmond|author3= Cherkinian, Michael|year= 1996|publisher= [[St. Martin's Press]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 1-55972-274-6|oclc= 31606927|pages= |url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/asmyworldstilltu00fult}}</ref>\n* [[Cher]] appeared on an episode of \"As the Stomach Turns\" as Pocahontas Pirelli, \"the town half-breed: half-Indian, and half-dressed,\" which was a play on her hit song of the time, \"[[Half-Breed (song)|Half-Breed]].\" She came in wearing a Native American headdress and a bikini top.\n* In an early sketch, Carol Burnett opens the door to find Harvey Korman as Mother Marcus for the character's first appearance on the show. When rehearsing the sketch, Korman never appeared in costume but spoke in the voice. When Burnett opened the door in dress rehearsal it was the first time she had actually seen him dressed up as the character. Burnett's reaction (pausing, struggling to regain her composure before slamming the door in his face, then cracking up when she opened the door again to move the script along) was completely genuine.\n\n==Sketches==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!

Other times, she would miss the correct time to answer the phone, saying \"Hello\" before the sound effect came for it to ring. On live soap opera productions, these were big problems; due to the live nature of the show, they happened fairly frequently, and were subsequently spoofed at length on ''The Carol Burnett Show''.\n\nIn addition to the missed cues, the sketch was notorious for overusing loud and plangent [[Organ (music)|organ music]], a reference to a time when soap operas would have in-house organists play dramatic music as well as the show's theme song (when this skit first ran, organ music was still in wide use on the serials). Organ music was eventually discontinued in the mid-1970s, around the time ''The Carol Burnett Show'' wrapped up its run, so when the sketch is seen in syndication today, it brings back a sense of production technique that is now seen by many younger soap viewers as archaic and outdated.\n\nOne of the sketch's recurring characters is Marion's \"ne'er-do-well\" daughter Jamie (played by [[Vicki Lawrence]]) who arrives at the door holding a baby (a doll), usually says \"Don't you recognize me mother? I'm your daughter,\" then leaves after giving the baby to Marion who immediately stashes it in the umbrella stand.<ref name=\"emmytvlegends.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/vicki-lawrence#|title=Vicki Lawrence|work=Archive of American Television|accessdate=1 December 2016}}</ref> This was a parody of the fact that traditional soap operas have little use for child characters, either dropping them from the plot line shortly after they are introduced or [[Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome|unnaturally aging]] them into adulthood or, more recently, into the teenage years (for example, a young character might be sent upstairs to put on his or her shoes and never be referred to again).\n\nThe sketch also marks the first appearances of [[Harvey Korman]]'s Mother Marcus character, who had also become a recurring resident of Canoga Falls, as well as [[Tim Conway]]'s [[The Oldest Man (character)|Oldest Man character]], who within the confines of the series played several characters, including Marion's grandfather, her Uncle Waldo, insurance agent Duane Toddleberry, and obscene phone caller Marvin Peterson Jr.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Burnett |first=Carol |subjectlink= |interviewer=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) |title=Featurette: Fabulous Firsts |url= |date= |work=Carol Burnett Show: The Lost Episodes Limited Edition (7 DVD Collection) }}</ref>\n\nThe sketch was famous for the parody ending in which the announcer would ask foreboding, progressively nonsensical questions about the characters while focusing on their puzzled reactions.\n\n==Trivia==\n* In her 1996 memoir, \"As My World Still Turns\", actress [[Eileen Fulton]], who has starred on the [[CBS]] soap ''[[As the World Turns]]'' for over four decades, claimed credit for coming up with the concept for \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Fulton stated that when she was contacted to be a guest star on the ''Burnett'' show, she suggested a parody of a soap called \"As the Stomach Turns\".  Ultimately Fulton ended up not appearing on the ''Burnett'' show, but the \"Stomach Turns\" sketch did.<ref>{{cite book|title= As My World Still Turns|last= Fulton|first= Eileen|authorlink= |author2= Atholl, Desmond|author3= Cherkinian, Michael|year= 1996|publisher= [[St. Martin's Press]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 1-55972-274-6|oclc= 31606927|pages= |url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/asmyworldstilltu00fult}}</ref>\n* [[Cher]] appeared on an episode of \"As the Stomach Turns\" as Pocahontas Pirelli, \"the town half-breed: half-Indian, and half-dressed,\" which was a play on her hit song of the time, \"[[Half-Breed (song)|Half-Breed]].\" She came in wearing a Native American headdress and a bikini top.\n* In an early sketch, Carol Burnett opens the door to find Harvey Korman as Mother Marcus for the character's first appearance on the show. When rehearsing the sketch, Korman never appeared in costume but spoke in the voice. When Burnett opened the door in dress rehearsal it was the first time she had actually seen him dressed up as the character. Burnett's reaction (pausing, struggling to regain her composure before slamming the door in his face, then cracking up when she opened the door again to move the script along) was completely genuine.\n\n==Sketches==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\"\n|-\n!

Here the problem is to share tasks equally between resources, such as individual servers, when the load that each task will require cannot be determined in advance, and where it would be inefficient or slow to poll every available server to determine it's current load. Failure to schedule tasks appropriately may lead to individual tasks becoming resource-constrained, or even fail. Tournament scheduling proceeds by polling servers in a small, randomly-selected, pool, and assigning the task to the server with the current most capacity. In many contexts this gives an efficient and robust tradeoff between the resource and time required to determine the load on each server, and ensuring an equitable distribution of load.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Fitness proportionate selection]]\n*[[Reward-based selection]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Genetic algorithms]]\n", "text_old": "'''Tournament selection''' is a method of selecting an individual from a population of individuals in a [[genetic algorithm]].<ref name=miller-goldberg>{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Brad|last2=Goldberg|first2=David|title=Genetic Algorithms, Tournament Selection, and the Effects of Noise|journal=Complex Systems|date=1995|volume=9|pages=193\u2013212|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/df6e/e94e2cf14c38e9cff4d2446a50db0aedd4ca.pdf}}</ref> Tournament selection involves running several \"tournaments\" among a few individuals (or \"[[chromosome (genetic algorithm)|chromosome]]s\") chosen at random from the population.

Introduced in 1949 by [[Piper Aircraft]], it was developed from the [[Piper PA-11]], and traces its lineage back through the [[Piper J-3|J-3]] to the [[Taylor E-2|Taylor E-2 Cub]] of the 1930s.  In close to 40 years of production, over 9,000{{cn|date=December 2018}} were built. Super Cubs are commonly found in roles such as [[bush flying]], [[banner towing]] and [[glider towing]].\n\n==Design and development==\nWhile based on the design of the earlier [[Piper Cub|Cubs]], the addition of an electrical system, [[Flap (aircraft)|flap]]s (3 notches), and a considerably more powerful [[reciprocating engine|engine]] (150&nbsp;hp), made it a very different flying experience. Although the \"standard\" Super Cub was fitted with a 150-horsepower (112&nbsp;kW) Lycoming engine, it is not uncommon to see them equipped with a 160-horsepower O-320-B2B, or even 180 horsepower (134&nbsp;kW) Lycoming O-360 powerplant. The high-lift [[wing]] and powerful engine made the Super Cub a prime candidate for conversion to either [[seaplane|floatplane]] or [[Landing gear|skiplane]].  In addition, the PA-18A (an agricultural version) was produced for [[Aerial application|applying]] either dry chemical or liquid spray.\n\nThe Super Cub retained the basic \"[[Tube-and-fabric construction|rag and tube]]\" (fabric stretched over a steel tube frame) structure of the earlier J-3 Cub.\n[[File:Piper PA-18-150 Super Cub lands RIAT Fairford 13July2017 arp.jpg|thumb|[[Piper Aircraft|Piper]] PA-18-150 Super Cub lands at the 2017 [[RIAT]], England. Built 1958.]]\n[[File:Piper PA-18 Super Cub on crane - Theb1936 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|Piper Cub used for weather monitoring and instrument maintenance in Alaska in 1950]]\nThe first true \"Super\" Cubs had flaps, dual fuel tanks, and an O-235 Lycoming engine producing about 108&nbsp;hp (115&nbsp;hp for takeoff only). However, a 90&nbsp;hp Continental variant without flaps and an optional second wing tank was available.  Their empty weight was, on the average, 800\u20131000 pounds with a gross weight of 1,500&nbsp;lb.  These Cubs would take off in about 400 feet (at gross weight) and land in about 300 feet (thanks to the flaps). The Super Cub is renowned for its ability to take off and land in very short distances. The first Super Cubs were going to be offered with a unique four-wheel tandem main landing gear designed for landing and takeoff from rough terrain, but this was replaced with [[conventional landing gear]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=mdgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA156&dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BAjZT-rpNYOe8gTth_jqAw&sqi=2&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Popular%20Mechanics%20Science%20installing%20linoleum&f=true \"Steep Climbing Air Horse For Farmers.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', September 1950, p. 156.</ref><ref>On a taildragger, the optional Whitaker tandem main landing gear was difficult to steer on a paved surface, whereas two large balloon tires provide maneuverability comparable to standard tires while still providing the flotation required on soft surfaces.</ref> The O-290 Lycoming powered Cubs (135&nbsp;hp) followed and would take off in about {{convert|200|ft|m}}. The landing distance remained the same at about {{convert|400|ft|m}}, or {{convert|300|ft|m}} using flaps.  With the use of the Lycoming O-320 at 150\u2013160&nbsp;hp, the Cub's allowable gross weight increased to 1,750&nbsp;lb while retaining the capability of a mere {{convert|200|ft|m}} required for takeoff.\n\nThe PA-18 has developed a very dedicated following in the bush-flying community, and many modifications have been developed for it, to the point where it is quite rare to find an original, completely stock Super Cub. Modifications include extended baggage compartments (reaching farther back into the fuselage, or even two-level baggage compartments in the top and bottom of the rear fuselage), external luggage pods, fuel pods, lumber racks for carrying construction materials into unimproved bush runways. Also the removal of header tanks, larger 24 or even 30 gallon wing fuel tanks, extended main landing gear for better ground clearance of the propeller, strengthened tailwheel springs, the addition of a small third passenger seat in the luggage area and lightweight generators and starters. Also various different mount areas for the battery (to move the weight forward, and reduce tail weight to shorten takeoff distance), various different tailfin shapes to increase surface area, lengthened flaps, various wingtip designs, vortex generators on the leading edge of the wings, movement of the electrical panel from the right wing root to the dashboard to reduce fire hazard during a crash, and even the addition of a constant-speed propeller.\nAbove all, the most common modification is the addition of \"bush wheels\", large, soft, low pressure balloon-tires designed to absorb impacts from rocks and boulders, and to not sink into sand or other soft surfaces, ideal for off-runway landings.\n\n==Variants==\n;PA-18 Super Cub\n:Prototype and production variant powered by a 95&nbsp;hp Continental C-90-8F piston engine, sometimes known as the PA-18-95.<ref name=\"ab\" />\n;PA-18-105 Super Cub\n:Production variant fitted with a 105&nbsp;hp [[Lycoming O-235|Lycoming O-235-C1]] piston engine and larger tailplane.<ref name=\"ab\" />\n;PA-18-105 Special\n:Special variant built in 1952 and 1953 for the [[Civil Air Patrol]] as a trainer with horn-balanced elevators and provision for seat parachutes.<ref name=\"ab\" />\n;PA-18-125 Super Cub\n:Variant to replace the PA-18-95 with flaps and horn-balanced elevators and a 125&nbsp;hp [[Lycoming O-290|Lycoming O-290-D]] piston engine and either wood or metal controllable-pitch propeller.<ref name=\"ab\" />\n;PA-18-135 Super Cub \n:Variant with a 135&nbsp;HP [[Lycoming O-290|Lycoming O-290-D]] piston engine and fitted with two wing tanks as standard.<ref name=\"ab\" />\n[[File:9A-DBS, a Piper Cub with no military history.jpg|right|thumb|PA-18-150]]\n;PA-18-150 Super Cub\n:1954 variant with a 150&nbsp;hp [[Lycoming O-320]].<ref name=\"ab\" />\n;PA-18-180 Super Cub\n:Experimental variant with a 180&nbsp;hp [[Lycoming O-360]] engine, one built in 1980 by Piper.<ref name=\"ab\" /> Other aircraft have been re-engined under a Supplemental Type Certificate.<ref name=\"stc\" />\n;PA-18A\n:Designation for production agricultural aircraft, including [[cropduster]]s and sprayer variants and incorporating a slightly different rear fuselage profile to allow fitting of a hopper-tank in the rear seat position.<ref name=\"ab\" />\n;PA-18S\n:Designation for production aircraft fitted with floats.<ref name=\"ab\" />\n;PA-18AS\n:Designation of a small number of agricultural aircraft fitted with floats.<ref name=\"ab\" />\n;PA-19 Super Cub\n:Original designation of the military variant of the PA-18, only three built and all subsequent military production were designated as PA-18s.<ref name=\"ab\" />\n;Aeromod Loadstar Model 100\n:[[Biplane]] conversion of Super Cub, powered by {{convert|135|hp|kW|abbr=on}} O-290-D engine, designed for improved capability from high-altitude airfields.<ref>Taylor 1967, p. 190.</ref>\n;SAFAT 01: A Sudanese development / copy built by the SAFAT Aviation Complex at [[Khartoum]].{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n===Military designations===\n;L-18C Super Cub\n:Military designation of the PA-18 Super Cub for the United States Army, powered by a 95&nbsp;hp (71&nbsp;kW) Continental C90-8F piston engine, 838 delivered, at least 156 of which were delivered to other nations under MDAP.<ref name=\"andrade131\" />\n;YL-21 Super Cub\n:Two Super Cub 135s for evaluation by the United States Army.<ref name=\"andrade134\" />\n;L-21A Super Cub\n:Military designation of the Super Cub 125, powered by a 125&nbsp;hp (92&nbsp;kW) Avco Lycoming 0-290-II piston engine, 150 delivered.<ref name=\"andrade134\" />\n;L-21B Super Cub\n:Military designation of the Super Cub 135, powered by a 135&nbsp;hp (101&nbsp;kW) Avco Lycoming 0-290-D2 piston engine, 584 delivered many to other nations under MDAP, re-designated U-7A in 1962.<ref name=\"andrade134\" />\n;TL-21A\n:A number of L-21As were converted into training aircraft.\n;U-7A Super Cub\n:1962 redesignation of the L-21B.<ref name=\"andrade134\" />\n\n==Operators==\n\n===Military operators===\n;{{ARG}}\n*[[Argentine Air Force]]\n;{{AUT}}\n*[[Austrian Air Force]]\n;{{BEL}}\n*[[Belgian Army]]\n;{{GER}}\n*[[German Air Force|Federal German Luftwaffe]]\n;{{GRE}}\n* [[Greek Army]]<ref name=\"fiwaf74p174-5\">Wheeler 1974, pp. 174\u2013175.</ref>\n;{{IRN}}\n*[[Imperial Iranian Air Force]]\n;{{ITA}}\n*[[Italian Army]]<ref name=\"andrade134\" /><ref>{{in lang|it}} [http://www.anae.it/docs/03-storia.html ANAE;

Although the \"standard\" Super Cub was fitted with a 150-horsepower (112&nbsp;kW) Lycoming engine, it is not uncommon to see them equipped with a 160-horsepower O-320-B2B, or even 180 horsepower (134&nbsp;kW) Lycoming O-360 powerplant. The high-lift [[wing]] and powerful engine made the Super Cub a prime candidate for conversion to either [[seaplane|floatplane]] or [[Landing gear|skiplane]].  In addition, the PA-18A (an agricultural version) was produced for [[Aerial application|applying]] either dry chemical or liquid spray.\n\nThe Super Cub retained the basic \"[[Tube-and-fabric construction|rag and tube]]\" (fabric stretched over a steel tube frame) structure of the earlier J-3 Cub.\n[[File:Piper PA-18-150 Super Cub lands RIAT Fairford 13July2017 arp.jpg|thumb|[[Piper Aircraft|Piper]] PA-18-150 Super Cub lands at the 2017 [[RIAT]], England. Built 1958.]]\n[[File:Piper PA-18 Super Cub on crane - Theb1936 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg|thumb|Piper Cub used for weather monitoring and instrument maintenance in Alaska in 1950]]\nThe first true \"Super\" Cubs had flaps, dual fuel tanks, and an O-235 Lycoming engine producing about 108&nbsp;hp (115&nbsp;hp for takeoff only). However, a 90&nbsp;hp Continental variant without flaps and an optional second wing tank was available.  Their empty weight was, on the average, 800\u20131000 pounds with a gross weight of 1,500&nbsp;lb.  These Cubs would take off in about 400 feet (at gross weight) and land in about 300 feet (thanks to the flaps). The Super Cub is renowned for its ability to take off and land in very short distances. The first Super Cubs were going to be offered with a unique four-wheel tandem main landing gear designed for landing and takeoff from rough terrain, but this was replaced with [[conventional landing gear]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=mdgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA156&dq=Popular+Mechanics+Science+installing+linoleum&hl=en&sa=X&ei=BAjZT-rpNYOe8gTth_jqAw&sqi=2&ved=0CD4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=Popular%20Mechanics%20Science%20installing%20linoleum&f=true \"Steep Climbing Air Horse For Farmers.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', September 1950, p. 156.</ref><ref>On a taildragger, the optional Whitaker tandem main landing gear was difficult to steer on a paved surface, whereas two large balloon tires provide maneuverability comparable to standard tires while still providing the flotation required on soft surfaces.</ref> The O-290 Lycoming powered Cubs (135&nbsp;hp) followed and would take off in about {{convert|200|ft|m}}. The landing distance remained the same at about {{convert|400|ft|m}}, or {{convert|300|ft|m}} using flaps.  With the use of the Lycoming O-320 at 150\u2013160&nbsp;hp, the Cub's allowable gross weight increased to 1,750&nbsp;lb while retaining the capability of a mere {{convert|200|ft|m}} required for takeoff.\n\nThe PA-18 has developed a very dedicated following in the bush-flying community, and many modifications have been developed for it, to the point where it is quite rare to find an original, completely stock Super Cub. Modifications include extended baggage compartments (reaching farther back into the fuselage, or even two-level baggage compartments in the top and bottom of the rear fuselage), external luggage pods, fuel pods, lumber racks for carrying construction materials into unimproved bush runways. Also the removal of header tanks, larger 24 or even 30 gallon wing fuel tanks, extended main landing gear for better ground clearance of the propeller, strengthened tailwheel springs, the addition of a small third passenger seat in the luggage area and lightweight generators and starters. Also various different mount areas for the battery (to move the weight forward, and reduce tail weight to shorten takeoff distance), various different tailfin shapes to increase surface area, lengthened flaps, various wingtip designs, vortex generators on the leading edge of the wings, movement of the electrical panel from the right wing root to the dashboard to reduce fire hazard during a crash, and even the addition of a constant-speed propeller.\nAbove all, the most common modification is the addition of \"bush wheels\", large, soft, low pressure balloon-tires designed to absorb impacts from rocks and boulders, and to not sink into sand or other soft surfaces, ideal for off-runway landings.\n\n==Variants==\n;PA-18 Super Cub\n:Prototype and production variant powered by a 95&nbsp;hp Continental C-90-8F piston engine, sometimes known as the PA-18-95.<ref name=\"ab\" />\n;PA-18-105 Super Cub\n:Production variant fitted with a 105&nbsp;hp [[Lycoming O-235|Lycoming O-235-C1]] piston engine and larger tailplane.<ref name=\"ab\" />\n;PA-18-105 Special\n:Special variant built in 1952 and 1953 for the [[Civil Air Patrol]] as a trainer with horn-balanced elevators and provision for seat parachutes.<ref name=\"ab\" />\n;PA-18-125 Super Cub\n:Variant to replace the PA-18-95 with flaps and horn-balanced elevators and a 125&nbsp;hp [[Lycoming O-290|Lycoming O-290-D]] piston engine and either wood or metal controllable-pitch propeller.<ref name=\"ab\" />\n;PA-18-135 Super Cub \n:Variant with a 135&nbsp;hp [[Lycoming O-290|Lycoming O-290-D]] piston engine and fitted with two wing tanks as standard.<ref name=\"ab\" />\n[[File:9A-DBS, a Piper Cub with no military history.jpg|right|thumb|PA-18-150]]\n;PA-18-150 Super Cub\n:1954 variant with a 150&nbsp;hp [[Lycoming O-320]].<ref name=\"ab\" />\n;PA-18-180 Super Cub\n:Experimental variant with a 180&nbsp;hp [[Lycoming O-360]] engine, one built in 1980 by Piper.<ref name=\"ab\" /> Other aircraft have been re-engined under a Supplemental Type Certificate.<ref name=\"stc\" />\n;PA-18A\n:Designation for production agricultural aircraft, including [[cropduster]]s and sprayer variants and incorporating a slightly different rear fuselage profile to allow fitting of a hopper-tank in the rear seat position.<ref name=\"ab\" />\n;PA-18S\n:Designation for production aircraft fitted with floats.<ref name=\"ab\" />\n;PA-18AS\n:Designation of a small number of agricultural aircraft fitted with floats.<ref name=\"ab\" />\n;PA-19 Super Cub\n:Original designation of the military variant of the PA-18, only three built and all subsequent military production were designated as PA-18s.<ref name=\"ab\" />\n;Aeromod Loadstar Model 100\n:[[Biplane]] conversion of Super Cub, powered by {{convert|135|hp|kW|abbr=on}} O-290-D engine, designed for improved capability from high-altitude airfields.<ref>Taylor 1967, p. 190.</ref>\n;SAFAT 01: A Sudanese development / copy built by the SAFAT Aviation Complex at [[Khartoum]].{{cn|date=December 2018}}\n===Military designations===\n;L-18C Super Cub\n:Military designation of the PA-18 Super Cub for the United States Army, powered by a 95&nbsp;hp (71&nbsp;kW) Continental C90-8F piston engine, 838 delivered, at least 156 of which were delivered to other nations under MDAP.<ref name=\"andrade131\" />\n;YL-21 Super Cub\n:Two Super Cub 135s for evaluation by the United States Army.<ref name=\"andrade134\" />\n;L-21A Super Cub\n:Military designation of the Super Cub 125, powered by a 125&nbsp;hp (92&nbsp;kW) Avco Lycoming 0-290-II piston engine, 150 delivered.<ref name=\"andrade134\" />\n;L-21B Super Cub\n:Military designation of the Super Cub 135, powered by a 135&nbsp;hp (101&nbsp;kW) Avco Lycoming 0-290-D2 piston engine, 584 delivered many to other nations under MDAP, re-designated U-7A in 1962.<ref name=\"andrade134\" />\n;TL-21A\n:A number of L-21As were converted into training aircraft.\n;U-7A Super Cub\n:1962 redesignation of the L-21B.<ref name=\"andrade134\" />\n\n==Operators==\n\n===Military operators===\n;{{ARG}}\n*[[Argentine Air Force]]\n;{{AUT}}\n*[[Austrian Air Force]]\n;{{BEL}}\n*[[Belgian Army]]\n;{{GER}}\n*[[German Air Force|Federal German Luftwaffe]]\n;{{GRE}}\n* [[Greek Army]]<ref name=\"fiwaf74p174-5\">Wheeler 1974, pp. 174\u2013175.</ref>\n;{{IRN}}\n*[[Imperial Iranian Air Force]]\n;{{ITA}}\n*[[Italian Army]]<ref name=\"andrade134\" /><ref>{{in lang|it}} [http://www.anae.it/docs/03-storia.html ANAE;
