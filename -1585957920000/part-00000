He played primarily for the [[Seattle Mariners]] and [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. His [[300 win club|303 career victories]] rank as the fifth-most by a left-hander in MLB history, while his [[3,000 strikeout club|4,875 strikeouts]] place him second all-time behind [[Nolan Ryan]] and are the most by a left-hander. He holds five of the seven highest single-season [[strikeout]] totals by a left-hander in modern history. Johnson won the [[Cy Young Award]] five times, second only to [[Roger Clemens]]' seven, and he is one of only two pitchers (the other being [[Greg Maddux]]) to win the award in four consecutive seasons (1999\u20132002). In 1999, he joined [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]] and [[Gaylord Perry]] in the rare feat of winning the award in both the [[American League|American]] and [[National League|National]] Leagues (a feat since accomplished by Clemens, [[Roy Halladay]], and [[Max Scherzer]]). He is also one of five pitchers to pitch [[No-hitter|no-hitters]] in both leagues. On May 18, 2004, at the age of 40, Johnson became the oldest pitcher in major league history to throw a [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]], and is one of seven pitchers who have thrown both a perfect game and a no-hitter in their careers. He is also one of 18 pitchers in history to record a [[Major league pitchers beating all 30 teams|win against all 30 MLB franchises]]. On May 8th 2001, Johnson achieved the feat of striking out 20 batters in one game, doing so against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. \n\nOne of the tallest players in major league history at {{convert|6|ft|10|in|m}}, and a ten-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], Johnson was celebrated for having one of the most dominant [[Fastball|fastballs]] in the game. He regularly approached \u2013 and occasionally exceeded \u2013 {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h}}, during his prime. Johnson also threw a hard, biting [[Slider (baseball)|slider]]. After struggling early in his career (having won only 64 games by his 30th birthday), he went on to lead his league in strikeouts nine times, and in [[earned run average]], [[win\u2013loss record (pitching)|winning percentage]], and [[Complete game|complete games]] four times each. Johnson was named one of two (along with [[Curt Schilling]]) [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|World Series Most Valuable Players]] in [[2001 World Series|2001]], with three pitching victories, leading the Diamondbacks to a World Series championship over the [[New York Yankees]] in only Arizona's fourth season. He won the pitching [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]] in 2002.\n\nJohnson's .646 career winning percentage ranks sixth among left-handers with at least 200 decisions; among southpaws, he ranks eighth in [[games started]] (603) and ninth in [[innings pitched]] ({{frac|4,135|1|3}}). Johnson's career elite rankings also include: first in [[strikeouts per nine innings pitched]] (10.67), third in [[hit by pitch|hit batsmen]] (188), and tenth in fewest hits allowed per nine innings pitched (7.24). He was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[2015 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2015]], his first year of eligibility, and is the first member of the Hall to be depicted in a Diamondbacks uniform on his plaque.\n\n==Early life==\nJohnson was born in [[Walnut Creek, California]], to Carol Hannah and Rollen Charles \"Bud\" Johnson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/rjohnson.htm|accessdate=January 6, 2010|title=1. Randall David (\"Randy\") Johnson|work=[[rootsweb]]|publisher=[[Ancestry.com]]}}</ref> By the time he entered [[Livermore High School]], he was a star in baseball and [[basketball]]. In 1982, as a senior, he struck out 121 batters in 66 innings, and threw a [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] in his last high school start. He also played on a Bercovich team that assembled top players from throughout California. After high school, he was drafted in 1982 by the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the 4th round and offered $50,000 to sign. Instead, Johnson accepted a full athletic scholarship to play baseball for the [[USC Trojans baseball|University of Southern California]]. While at USC, he also played two years of [[basketball]]. He was a starter at USC (where he was a teammate of [[Mark McGwire]]) under coach [[Rod Dedeaux]], but often exhibited control problems.\n\n==Major league career (1988\u20132009)==\n\n===Montreal Expos (1988\u20131989)===\nJohnson was drafted by the [[Montreal Expos]] in the second round of the [[1985 Major League Baseball draft]]. He made his major league debut on September 15, 1988 against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], earning a 9&ndash;4 victory with a five-inning outing in which he gave up two runs with five strikeouts; his first victim was [[Orestes Destrade]] in the second inning. Johnson posted a record of 3&ndash;0 with a 2.42 earned run average (ERA) in four games in 1988, but 1989 saw him slip to an 0&ndash;4 mark with a 6.67 ERA in seven games through May 7, and on May 25 he was traded to the [[Seattle Mariners]] in a trade involving five pitchers that brought [[Mark Langston]] to Montreal. In 11 total games played with the Expos, he went 3\u20134 with a 4.69 ERA and one complete game in 55.2 innings with 51 strikeouts and 33 walks.\n\n===Seattle Mariners (1989\u20131998)===\n====1989\u20131992====\nAfter joining the Mariners during the [[1989 Seattle Mariners season|1989 season]], Johnson led the American League in walks for three consecutive seasons (1990\u20131992), and hit batsmen in 1992 and 1993. In July 1991, facing the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], the erratic Johnson allowed 4 runs on 1 hit, thanks to 10 walks in 4 innings. A month later, a 9th-inning single cost him a no-hitter against the [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]]. Johnson suffered another 10-walk, 4-inning start in 1992.\n\nHis untapped talent was volcanic: In 1990, Johnson became the first left-hander to strike out [[Wade Boggs]] three times in one game, and a no-hitter against the [[1990 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] attested to his potential. Johnson credits a session with [[Nolan Ryan]] late in the 1992 season with helping him take his career to the next level; Ryan has said that he appreciated Johnson's talent and did not want to see him take as long to figure certain things out as he had taken. Ryan recommended a slight change in his delivery; before the meeting, Johnson would land on the heel of his foot after delivering a pitch, and he therefore usually landed offline from home plate. Ryan suggested that he land on the ball of his foot, and almost immediately, he began finding the strike zone more consistently.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/RJohnson/RJohnson_bio.html |title=Randy Johnson Biography |publisher=JockBio |date=September 10, 1963 |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref> In a September 27, 1992 game against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], with Ryan the opposing starting pitcher, Johnson struck out 18 batters in eight innings while throwing 160 pitches, a pitch count that has not been reached in an MLB game since.<ref name=kepner>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E0DE113BF934A35752C0A9669D8B63|title=AN APPRECIATION; Worth Watching, From Start to Finish|first=Tyler|last=Kepner|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 7, 2010|accessdate=December 1, 2011}}</ref> It was during the 1992 off-season when Johnson returned home for Christmas only to lose his father to an  [[aortic aneurysm]].

In May 1993, Johnson again lost a no-hitter to a 9th-inning single; again, the opponent was the Oakland Athletics. He also recorded his 1,000th career strikeout against the [[1993 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]]' [[Chuck Knoblauch]]. Prior to the trade deadline, Johnson was nearly dealt to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] for [[Steve Karsay]] and [[Mike Timlin]]. Toronto general manager [[Pat Gillick]] had two separate transactions on the table including the one for Johnson with Seattle general manager [[Woody Woodward]] and one for [[Rickey Henderson]] with Oakland general manager [[Sandy Alderson]]. When Gillick was unable to contact Woodward he agreed to utilize the deal with Alderson. When Woodward returned Gillick's call he said he would agree to the deal for Johnson. However, Gillick gave his word to Alderson even though the deal had not been finalized.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bluejayhunter.com/2012/01/randy-johnson-almost-traded-to-blue.html|title=Randy Johnson Almost Traded to the Blue Jays}}</ref> At the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1993 All-Star Game]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], in a famous incident, Johnson threw a fastball over the head of [[Philadelphia Phillies]] first baseman [[John Kruk]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB2A5104290F467&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePMA|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=July 18, 1993|page=E07|title=AN ALL-STAR STRIKEOUT THAT WAS GOOD FOR SOME LAUGHS JOHN KRUK MAY HAVE LOOKED A BIT OVERMATCHED AGAINST \\ RANDY JOHNSON.

His .900 winning percentage was the second highest in AL history, behind [[Johnny Allen (baseball)|Johnny Allen]], who had gone 15\u20131 for the [[Cleveland Indians]] in 1937. Johnson became the first regular starting pitcher in history to strike out more than a third of all batters faced. He also became the first Seattle Mariners pitcher to win the Cy Young Award, and the only one until [[F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez]] took home the honor in [[2010 Seattle Mariners season|2010]].\n\nJohnson capped the Mariners' late season comeback by pitching a three-hitter in the AL West's one-game playoff, crushing the [[1995 California Angels season|California Angels]]' hopes with 12 strikeouts. Thus unable to start in the 5-game [[1995 American League Division Series|ALDS]] series against the [[1995 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] until the third game, Johnson watched as New York took a 2\u20130 series lead.  He defeated the Yankees in Game 3 with 10 strikeouts in seven innings.\n\nWhen the series went the full five games, the Mariners having come back from an 0\u20132 deficit to win both games at the [[Kingdome]], Johnson made a dramatic relief appearance in the series final, Game 5, on only one day's rest. Entering a 4\u20134 game in the ninth inning, Johnson pitched the ninth, 10th, and 11th innings.

Johnson led the major leagues in strikeouts (with 290). In the games where Arizona scored three or more runs, Johnson was 13\u20132.

Johnson began 2006 well, but then he struggled to find form. In between some impressive performances, he allowed 5 or more runs in 7 of his first 18 starts for the season. Johnson was more effective in the second half. Johnson finished the season with a 17\u201311 record, a subpar 5.00 ERA with 172 strikeouts. It was revealed at the end of the 2006 season that a herniated disc in Johnson's back had been stiffening him and it was only in his second to last start of the season that he decided to get it checked. This exposure caused him to miss his last start of 2006.

Johnson''' (born September 10, 1963), nicknamed '''\"The Big Unit\"''', is an [[Americans|American]] former [[Professional baseball|professional baseball]] [[Pitcher|pitcher]] who played 22 seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB), from 1988 to 2009, for six teams. He played primarily for the [[Seattle Mariners]] and [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. His [[300 win club|303 career victories]] rank as the fifth-most by a left-hander in MLB history, while his [[3,000 strikeout club|4,875 strikeouts]] place him second all-time behind [[Nolan Ryan]] and are the most by a left-hander. He holds five of the seven highest single-season [[strikeout]] totals by a left-hander in modern history. Johnson won the [[Cy Young Award]] five times, second only to [[Roger Clemens]]' seven, and he is one of only two pitchers (the other being [[Greg Maddux]]) to win the award in four consecutive seasons (1999\u20132002). In 1999, he joined [[Pedro Mart\u00ednez]] and [[Gaylord Perry]] in the rare feat of winning the award in both the [[American League|American]] and [[National League|National]] Leagues (a feat since accomplished by Clemens, [[Roy Halladay]], and [[Max Scherzer]]). He is also one of five pitchers to pitch [[No-hitter|no-hitters]] in both leagues. On May 18, 2004, at the age of 40, Johnson became the oldest pitcher in major league history to throw a [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]], and is one of seven pitchers who have thrown both a perfect game and a no-hitter in their careers. He is also one of 18 pitchers in history to record a [[Major league pitchers beating all 30 teams|win against all 30 MLB franchises]]. On May 8th 2001, Johnson achieved the feat of striking out 20 batters in one game, doing so against the [[Cincinnati Reds]]. \n\nOne of the tallest players in major league history at {{convert|6|ft|10|in|m}}, and a ten-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]], Johnson was celebrated for having one of the most dominant [[Fastball|fastballs]] in the game. He regularly approached \u2013 and occasionally exceeded \u2013 {{convert|100|mi/h|km/h}}, during his prime. Johnson also threw a hard, biting [[Slider (baseball)|slider]]. After struggling early in his career (having won only 64 games by his 30th birthday), he went on to lead his league in strikeouts nine times, and in [[earned run average]], [[win\u2013loss record (pitching)|winning percentage]], and [[Complete game|complete games]] four times each. Johnson was named one of two (along with [[Curt Schilling]]) [[World Series Most Valuable Player Award|World Series Most Valuable Players]] in [[2001 World Series|2001]], with three pitching victories, leading the Diamondbacks to a World Series championship over the [[New York Yankees]] in only Arizona's fourth season. He won the pitching [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]] in 2002.\n\nJohnson's .646 career winning percentage ranks sixth among left-handers with at least 200 decisions; among southpaws, he ranks eighth in [[games started]] (603) and ninth in [[innings pitched]] ({{frac|4,135|1|3}}). Johnson's career elite rankings also include: first in [[strikeouts per nine innings pitched]] (10.67), third in [[hit by pitch|hit batsmen]] (188), and tenth in fewest hits allowed per nine innings pitched (7.24). He was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[2015 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting|2015]], his first year of eligibility, and is the first member of the Hall to be depicted in a Diamondbacks uniform on his plaque.\n\n==Early life==\nJohnson was born in [[Walnut Creek, California]], to Carol Hannah and Rollen Charles \"Bud\" Johnson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/celeb/rjohnson.htm|accessdate=January 6, 2010|title=1. Randall David (\"Randy\") Johnson|work=[[rootsweb]]|publisher=[[Ancestry.com]]}}</ref> By the time he entered [[Livermore High School]], he was a star in baseball and [[basketball]]. In 1982, as a senior, he struck out 121 batters in 66 innings, and threw a [[Perfect game (baseball)|perfect game]] in his last high school start. He also played on a Bercovich team that assembled top players from throughout California. After high school, he was drafted in 1982 by the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the 4th round and offered $50,000 to sign. Instead, Johnson accepted a full athletic scholarship to play baseball for the [[USC Trojans baseball|University of Southern California]]. While at USC, he also played two years of [[basketball]]. He was a starter at USC (where he was a teammate of [[Mark McGwire]]) under coach [[Rod Dedeaux]], but often exhibited control problems.\n\n==Major league career (1988\u20132009)==\n\n===Montreal Expos (1988\u20131989)===\nJohnson was drafted by the [[Montreal Expos]] in the second round of the [[1985 Major League Baseball draft]]. He made his major league debut on September 15, 1988 against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]], earning a 9&ndash;4 victory with a five-inning outing in which he gave up two runs with five strikeouts; his first victim was [[Orestes Destrade]] in the second inning. Johnson posted a record of 3&ndash;0 with a 2.42 earned run average (ERA) in four games in 1988, but 1989 saw him slip to an 0&ndash;4 mark with a 6.67 ERA in seven games through May 7, and on May 25 he was traded to the [[Seattle Mariners]] in a trade involving five pitchers that brought [[Mark Langston]] to Montreal. In 11 total games played with the Expos, he went 3\u20134 with a 4.69 ERA and one complete game in 55.2 innings with 51 strikeouts and 33 walks.\n\n===Seattle Mariners (1989\u20131998)===\n====1989\u20131992====\nAfter joining the Mariners during the [[1989 Seattle Mariners season|1989 season]], Johnson led the American League in walks for three consecutive seasons (1990\u20131992), and hit batsmen in 1992 and 1993. In July 1991, facing the [[Milwaukee Brewers]], the erratic Johnson allowed 4 runs on 1 hit, thanks to 10 walks in 4 innings. A month later, a 9th-inning single cost him a no-hitter against the [[1989 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]]. Johnson suffered another 10-walk, 4-inning start in 1992.\n\nHis untapped talent was volcanic: In 1990, Johnson became the first left-hander to strike out [[Wade Boggs]] three times in one game, and a no-hitter against the [[1990 Detroit Tigers season|Detroit Tigers]] attested to his potential. Johnson credits a session with [[Nolan Ryan]] late in the 1992 season with helping him take his career to the next level; Ryan has said that he appreciated Johnson's talent and did not want to see him take as long to figure certain things out as he had taken. Ryan recommended a slight change in his delivery; before the meeting, Johnson would land on the heel of his foot after delivering a pitch, and he therefore usually landed offline from home plate. Ryan suggested that he land on the ball of his foot, and almost immediately, he began finding the strike zone more consistently.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/RJohnson/RJohnson_bio.html |title=Randy Johnson Biography |publisher=JockBio |date=September 10, 1963 |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref> In a September 27, 1992 game against the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], with Ryan the opposing starting pitcher, Johnson struck out 18 batters in eight innings while throwing 160 pitches, a pitch count that has not been reached in an MLB game since.<ref name=kepner>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E0DE113BF934A35752C0A9669D8B63|title=AN APPRECIATION; Worth Watching, From Start to Finish|first=Tyler|last=Kepner|newspaper=The New York Times|date=January 7, 2010|accessdate=December 1, 2011}}</ref> It was during the 1992 off-season when Johnson returned home for Christmas only to lose his father to an  [[aortic aneurysm]].

In May 1993, Johnson again lost a no-hitter to a 9th-inning single; again, the opponent was the Oakland Athletics. He also recorded his 1,000th career strikeout against the [[1993 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]]' [[Chuck Knoblauch]]. Prior to the trade deadline, Johnson was nearly dealt to the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] for [[Steve Karsay]] and [[Mike Timlin]]. Toronto general manager [[Pat Gillick]] had two separate transactions on the table including the one for Johnson with Seattle general manager [[Woody Woodward]] and one for [[Rickey Henderson]] with Oakland general manager [[Sandy Alderson]]. When Gillick was unable to contact Woodward he agreed to utilize the deal with Alderson. When Woodward returned Gillick's call he said he would agree to the deal for Johnson. However, Gillick gave his word to Alderson even though the deal had not been finalized.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bluejayhunter.com/2012/01/randy-johnson-almost-traded-to-blue.html|title=Randy Johnson Almost Traded to the Blue Jays}}</ref> At the [[1993 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1993 All-Star Game]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], in a famous incident, Johnson threw a fastball over the head of [[Philadelphia Phillies]] first baseman [[John Kruk]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB2A5104290F467&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePMA|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]]|date=July 18, 1993|page=E07|title=AN ALL-STAR STRIKEOUT THAT WAS GOOD FOR SOME LAUGHS JOHN KRUK MAY HAVE LOOKED A BIT OVERMATCHED AGAINST \\ RANDY JOHNSON.

His .900 winning percentage was the second highest in AL history, behind [[Johnny Allen (baseball)|Johnny Allen]], who had gone 15\u20131 for the [[Cleveland Indians]] in 1937. Johnson became the first regular starting pitcher in history to strike out more than a third of all batters faced. He also became the first Seattle Mariners pitcher to win the Cy Young Award, and the only one until [[F\u00e9lix Hern\u00e1ndez]] took home the honor in [[2010 Seattle Mariners season|2010]].\n\nJohnson capped the Mariners' late season comeback by pitching a three-hitter in the AL West's one-game playoff, crushing the [[1995 California Angels season|California Angels]]' hopes with 12 strikeouts. Thus unable to start in the 5-game [[1995 American League Division Series|ALDS]] series against the [[1995 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] until the third game, Johnson watched as New York took a 2\u20130 series lead.  He defeated the Yankees in Game 3 with 10 strikeouts in seven innings.\n\nWhen the series went the full five games, the Mariners having come back from an 0\u20132 deficit to win both games at the [[Kingdome]], Johnson made a dramatic relief appearance in the series final, Game 5, on only one day's rest. Entering a 4\u20134 game in the ninth inning, Johnson pitched the ninth, 10th, and 11th innings. He allowed one run, struck out six, and held on for the series-ending win in Seattle's dramatic comeback.\n\nJohnson posted an 0\u20136 playoff record in his next four playoff series, each of which his teams lost.\n\n====1996\u22121998====\nJohnson was sidelined throughout much of the 1996 season with a back injury, but he rebounded in [[1997 Seattle Mariners season|1997]] with a 20\u20134 record, 291 strikeouts, and a 2.28 ERA (his personal best). Between May 1994 and October 1997, Johnson had gone 53\u20139, including a 16\u20130 streak that fell one short of the AL record. Johnson had two 19-strikeout starts in 1997, on June 24 and August 8.\n\nAnother colorful All-Star Game moment proceeded in the [[1997 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1997]] edition involving former Expos teammate [[Larry Walker]], at that point with the [[1997 Colorado Rockies season|Colorado Rockies]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DP&p_theme=dp&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EAF884F1FF49657&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Walker gets Kruk off hook Wilting under Johnson's high heat|first=Jerry|last=Crasnick|authorlink=Jerry Crasnick |newspaper=[[Denver Post]]|date=July 9, 1997|page=D\u201301|accessdate=December 1, 2011}} {{subscription required|date=December 2011}}</ref>   When Johnson had started an interleague game versus the Rockies on June 12, Walker chose not to play, explaining that \"I faced Randy one time in [[spring training]] and he almost killed me.\"<ref>{{cite newspaper |author=[[Associated Press]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-06-12/sports/sp-2622_1_face-johnson |title=Walker will not face Johnson |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 12, 1997 |accessdate=February 4, 2017}}</ref>  In the All-Star Game, Walker batted against Johnson, who theatrically threw over his head.

On August 23, 2001, Johnson struck out three batters on nine pitches in the 6th inning of a 5\u20131 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates, becoming the 30th pitcher in major league history to pitch an [[List of Major League Baseball pitchers who have struck out three batters on nine pitches|immaculate inning]].\n\nIn 2002, Johnson won the pitching [[Major League Baseball Triple Crown|Triple Crown]], leading the NL in wins, ERA and strikeouts, and was voted his fourth consecutive Cy Young and Warren Spahn Awards.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20030102&content_id=189354&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=null|first=Barry M.|last=Bloom|title=More hardware for Big Unit |work=[[MLB.com]] |publisher=[[Major League Baseball Advanced Media|MLB Advanced Media]] |date=August 21, 2002 |accessdate=October 10, 2011}}</ref> It was Johnson's fourth consecutive 300-strikeout season with the Diamondbacks, and fifth consecutive overall, extending his own MLB record from the previous season in which he set the record for the most consecutive seasons with 300 or more strikeouts in a season by a pitcher.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Gilbert |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/print.jsp?ymd=20090602&content_id=5109916&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb |title=Unit's historic career like no other &#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref> He also became the first pitcher in baseball history to post a 24\u20135 record.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Neyer/James Guide to Pitchers: An Historical Compendium of Pitching, Pitchers, and Pitches: Books: Bill James, Rob Neyer |publisher=Amazon.com |isbn=0743261585 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/neyerjamesguidet00jame }}</ref>\n\nJohnson spent the majority of the 2003 season on the disabled list and was ineffective in the few injury-hampered starts he did make. He hit his first career home run in a September 19, 2003, game against the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. It was the only home run to date for Johnson, a career .125 hitter.\n\nOn May 18, 2004, Johnson [[Randy Johnson's perfect game|pitched the 17th perfect game in baseball history]]. At 40 years of age, he was the oldest pitcher to accomplish this feat. Johnson had 13 strikeouts on his way to a 2\u20130 victory against the [[Atlanta Braves]]. The perfect game made him the fifth pitcher in Major League history (after [[Cy Young]], [[Jim Bunning]], [[Nolan Ryan]], and [[Hideo Nomo]]) to pitch a no-hitter in both leagues. He also became the fifth pitcher in Major League history to throw both a no-hitter and a perfect game in his career (after Young, Bunning, [[Addie Joss]], and [[Sandy Koufax]]; since Johnson, [[Mark Buehrle]] and [[Roy Halladay]] have joined this group). Johnson struck out [[Jeff Cirillo]] of the [[San Diego Padres]] on June 29, 2004 to become only the fourth MLB player to reach 4,000 strikeouts in a career.<ref>{{cite web|author=Steve Gilbert |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20040629&content_id=783948&vkey=news_mlb&fext=.jsp&c_id=null |title=Big Unit joins 4,000-strikeout club &#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nHe finished the 2004 season with a 16\u201314 record, though his poor record was partially due to a lack of run support as his ERA that year was 2.60. Johnson led the major leagues in strikeouts (with 290). In the games where Arizona scored three or more runs, Johnson was 13\u20132. As his team only won 51 games that year, his ratio of winning 31.3% of his team's games was the highest for any starting pitcher since [[Steve Carlton]] in 1972 (who won 27 of the [[Phillies]]' 59 wins for an all-time record ratio of 45.8%).\n\n===New York Yankees (2005\u20132006)===\n[[File:RandyJohnson.jpg|thumb|upright|Johnson with the Yankees]]\nThe Diamondbacks traded Johnson to the [[New York Yankees]] for [[Javier V\u00e1zquez (baseball)|Javier V\u00e1zquez]], [[Brad Halsey]], [[Dioner Navarro]], and cash in January 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1955906|title=Paperwork in place for Johnson-Vazquez trade \u2013 MLB|work=ESPN.com|accessdate=December 16, 2014}}</ref> Johnson pitched Opening Day for the Yankees on April 3, 2005 against the [[Boston Red Sox]]. Johnson was inconsistent through 2005, allowing 32 home runs; however, he regained his dominance in late 2005. He was 5\u20130 against the Yankees' [[Yankees \u2013 Red Sox rivalry|division rival]] Red Sox and finished the season 17\u20138 with a 3.79 ERA, and was second in the AL with 211 strikeouts.\n\nIn 2005, ''[[The Sporting News]]'' published an update of their 1999 book ''Baseball's 100 Greatest Players''. Johnson did not make the original edition, but for the 2005 update, with his career totals considerably higher and his 2001 World Championship season taken into account, he was ranked at Number 60.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nJohnson was a disappointment in Game 3 of the 2005 [[Division Series]] against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], allowing 5 runs on 2 home runs in 3 innings. In Game 5 in Anaheim, Johnson made an effective relief appearance after [[Mike Mussina]] gave up 5 runs and 6 hits to give the Angels a 5\u20132 lead, but the Yankees were unable to come back in the series.\n\nAfter an inconclusive year in pinstripes, New York fans hoped that Johnson would return to his dominant style in his second Yankee season. Johnson began 2006 well, but then he struggled to find form. In between some impressive performances, he allowed 5 or more runs in 7 of his first 18 starts for the season. Johnson was more effective in the second half. Johnson finished the season with a 17\u201311 record, a subpar 5.00 ERA with 172 strikeouts. It was revealed at the end of the 2006 season that a herniated disc in Johnson's back had been stiffening him and it was only in his second to last start of the season that he decided to get it checked. This exposure caused him to miss his last start of 2006. After being given [[epidural anesthesia]] and a few bullpen sessions he was cleared to start in game 3 of the ALDS, however he gave up 5 runs in 5{{frac|2|3}} innings.\n\n===Second stint with the Arizona Diamondbacks (2007\u20132008)===\n[[File:Randy Johnson 04.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Johnson pitching for the Arizona Diamondbacks.]]\nIn January 2007, the Yankees traded Johnson back to the Diamondbacks, almost two years to the day that Arizona had traded him to New York, for a package of [[Luis Vizca\u00edno]], [[Alberto Gonz\u00e1lez (baseball)|Alberto Gonz\u00e1lez]], [[Steven Jackson (baseball)|Steven Jackson]], and [[Ross Ohlendorf]].<ref name=\"baseball-reference1\"/> The Yankees' decision to trade Johnson was primarily based on a pre-season conversation he had with Yankees General Manager [[Brian Cashman]] about the importance of being closer to his family in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] after the death of his brother.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kepner|first=Tyler|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/05/sports/baseball/05yanks.html | title=Yankees Send Johnson Back to Arizona |publisher=New York Times |date=January 5, 2007 |accessdate=August 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJohnson missed most of April, rehabilitating his injured back before returning on April 24, 2007. Johnson allowed six runs in 5 innings and took the loss, but struck out seven. He returned to form, and by his tenth start of the season was among the NL's top ten strikeout pitchers. But on July 3, his surgically repaired disc from the previous season was reinjured. Johnson had season-ending surgery on the same disc, this time removing it completely. Reporting that the procedure went \"a little better than expected\", Arizona hoped that Johnson would be ready for the 2008 season.<ref>{{cite web|last=Associated |first=The |url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2008-03-09-3753914909_x.htm |title=Hideki Matsui returns to Yankees' lineup; Randy Johnson ready for spring debut |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=March 9, 2008 |accessdate=July 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\nJohnson made his season debut on April 14, 2008 against the [[San Francisco Giants]] at [[AT&T Park]] eight months following his back surgery.

Following Zhukov's death in 2002, the trio slowly lost original popularity and oriented themselves into a mainstream [[electropop]] movement.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== The origins ===\nTowards the end of the eighties Nikolay Timofeev and Alexey Ryzhov met in high school. Both being creative minds with good sense of humor, they started creating humorous material. After being noticed at a KVN (\u041a\u043b\u0443\u0431 \u0412\u0435\u0441\u0451\u043b\u044b\u0445 \u0438 \u041d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0447\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0445, Klub Vesyolyh i Nahodchivyh, Club of Funny and Smart, is a Russian TV show, a humor contest, which indirectly spanned similar contests in schools, independent from the show), they started receiving invitations to provide entertainment at parties.\nTimofeev and Ryzhov's first intended musical direction was rock. At a summer camp, they created a very short lived rock band called \"\u041e\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0443\u0448\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\" (Ognetushitel, \"Fire extinguisher\"). But both of them lacked money to buy instruments and various equipment to play rock professionally, so they had to make some money. The duo started emceeing at local clubs and liked it.\nDuring college years, the duo was involved with another short lived band called \"Interview\". Also, Timofeev and Ryzhov were invited to a local radio station to make their own radioshow. During that period of time, the duo started putting sketches in some songs: whenever a famous song had a part void of lyrics, they put some of their own rap into it. This was later to become their trademark in their early songs.\nMeanwhile, the band was asked to perform in a local club called \"\u042d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\" (\"Electron\"). Noticing the bad state of their club, they dubbed it \"Disaster Disco\". After a few fixing, the rating of their club went uphill as it became more and more famous.\n\n===From two to four===\nA childhood acquaintance of Timofeev and Ryzhov, Oleg Zhukov, was amongst the biggest and most loyal fans of \"Disco 'Crash'\", and soon joined the duo's closest circle of friends. One night, they took him with them to a soir\u00e9e organized by a company called \"Kranek\", and all Zhukov did was repeating the company's name during one song. As Timofeev recalls: \"And during one of our song, Zhukov repeated the company's name, Kranek, with such a voice, that the audience and us fell for his charm, and since then, he joined us for good\". This happened in 1991. Around that time, the band was invited to Moscow for a trial studio record, resulting in their first album \"\u0422\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0439 \u0441\u043e \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0439\" (Tantsuy so mnoy\", Dance with me), but it wasn't what the band expected. Some of its songs were later reused in their first official album.\nTowards 1997, the trio noticed their club was losing their popularity. They found out that a rival disco opened in town, and people there were charged half as much. They discovered that disco had only one MC, young and motivated, close in style to Timofeev. They decided that it was the best to join forces with him. That's how Alexey Serov joined the band. His first contribution to the band was recording a skit where he asked to turn the music off using lots of expletives (used later in the song \"\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0431\u0430\u043b \u0422\u044b!\" but with expletives covered by radio parasite sounds), and his second contribution was recording vocals for the second and final version of the song \"\u0414\u0432\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0439-\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0439\" (\"Dvigay-dvigay\", Move it-move it).\n\n===First success===\nIn 1998, while Russia was in crisis, the band decided to record their second album (considered by many to be their first). They lacked the cash to pay for studio time, so they made a deal with the studio \"Soyuz\". At that time, the studio was working on a remix album for the Belorussian band [[Lyapis Trubetskoy]] called \"Lyapis-Dance\", and Diskoteka \"Avariya\" was asked to make four remixes for the album. They made three pure remixes, while the last one became a comic rap song using Lyapis Trubetskoy's chorus. The song, called \"\u0422\u044b \u043a\u0438\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0430\" (\"Ty kinula\", You dumped) became their first single and later, their first music video. The band then had enough money to record their first official album \"\u041f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\" (\"Pesnya pro tebya i menya\", Song about you and me). It was composed of three of the Lyapis Trubetskoy remixes (one of them was remade for this album as an instrumental track), some songs from \"\u0422\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0439 \u0441\u043e \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0439\", and some brand new material. Soon other albums were released and the band became one of the most popular Russian bands. \nAlexey Serov's law education has allowed the band to stay producer-free. Their one stint with a producer, Peter Volkov, was short-lived.\n\n===Back to three===\nAfter their album \"\u041c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u044f\u043a\u0438\"(\"Manyaki\", Maniacs) was released in 2001, Oleg Zhukov fell ill, and the band had to perform without him. 9 February 2002, Zhukov died of brain cancer.\nAfter Zhukov's death and a period of pause, the band decided to go on as a trio. They released their first music videos without Zhukov: \"\u0425\u0425\u0425\u0438\u0420\u041d\u0420\" (acronym for \"Hip-Hop, House and Rock'N'Roll\") and \"\u041d\u0435\u0431\u043e\" (\"Nebo\", Sky), the latter featuring international model [[Katia Elizarova]]. These videos featured new versions of songs from the album \"\u041c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u044f\u043a\u0438\", with different music, and Zhukov's lyrics either sung by Ryzhov, or dropped out.\nAfter releases of some famous singles, the band released in 2006 a new album called \"\u0427\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0439\" (\"Chetvero Parney\", Four guys). It featured the song of the same name (although listed in the song list as an acronym of its title) which was recorded prior to the release of \"\u041c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u044f\u043a\u0438\", but the band lacked time to put it in the album. This song was the last new song released to feature Oleg Zhukov's vocals.<ref>http://avariya.ru/?p=biography (in Russian, the history of the band from their official website)</ref><ref>http://avariya.ru/?p=74 (in Russian, history of the band as seen by Alexey Serov)</ref><ref>http://avariya.ru/?p=77 (in Russian, history of the band, as seen by Alexey Ryzhov)</ref><ref>http://avariya.ru/?p=71 (in Russian, history of the band, as seen by Nikolay Timofeev)</ref>\n\n===Changes in style and lineup===\nIn 2011, the band released a new album \"\u041d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f\" (\"Nedetskoe vremya\", A Time not for Kids), featuring a more electropop-sounding style, and for the first time the autotune was used. The album itself was released online for free.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.avariya.ru/media.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-08-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804104825/http://www.avariya.ru/media.aspx |archive-date=2012-08-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \n\nIn July 2012, Timofeev left the band<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.avariya.ru/news/2012/07/diskoteka-auaria-teper-bez-nikolaya-timofeeva.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-08-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103072446/http://www.avariya.ru/news/2012/07/diskoteka-auaria-teper-bez-nikolaya-timofeeva.aspx |archive-date=2018-01-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> to start his own solo career.

Following Zhukov's death in 2002, the trio slowly lost original popularity and oriented themselves into a mainstream [[electropop]] movement.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== The origins ===\nTowards the end of the eighties Nikolay Timofeev and Alexey Ryzhov met in high school. Both being creative minds with good sense of humor, they started creating humorous material. After being noticed at a KVN (\u041a\u043b\u0443\u0431 \u0412\u0435\u0441\u0451\u043b\u044b\u0445 \u0438 \u041d\u0430\u0445\u043e\u0434\u0447\u0438\u0432\u044b\u0445, Klub Vesyolyh i Nahodchivyh, Club of Funny and Smart, is a Russian TV show, a humor contest, which indirectly spanned similar contests in schools, independent from the show), they started receiving invitations to provide entertainment at parties.\nTimofeev and Ryzhov's first intended musical direction was rock. At a summer camp, they created a very short lived rock band called \"\u041e\u0433\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0443\u0448\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\" (Ognetushitel, \"Fire extinguisher\"). But both of them lacked money to buy instruments and various equipment to play rock professionally, so they had to make some money. The duo started emceeing at local clubs and liked it.\nDuring college years, the duo was involved with another short lived band called \"Interview\". Also, Timofeev and Ryzhov were invited to a local radio station to make their own radioshow. During that period of time, the duo started putting sketches in some songs: whenever a famous song had a part void of lyrics, they put some of their own rap into it. This was later to become their trademark in their early songs.\nMeanwhile, the band was asked to perform in a local club called \"\u042d\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043d\" (\"Electron\"). Noticing the bad state of their club, they dubbed it \"Disaster Disco\". After a few fixing, the rating of their club went uphill as it became more and more famous.\n\n===From two to four===\nA childhood acquaintance of Timofeev and Ryzhov, Oleg Zhukov, was amongst the biggest and most loyal fans of \"Disco 'Crash'\", and soon joined the duo's closest circle of friends. One night, they took him with them to a soir\u00e9e organized by a company called \"Kranek\", and all Zhukov did was repeating the company's name during one song. As Timofeev recalls: \"And during one of our song, Zhukov repeated the company's name, Kranek, with such a voice, that the audience and us fell for his charm, and since then, he joined us for good\". This happened in 1991. Around that time, the band was invited to Moscow for a trial studio record, resulting in their first album \"\u0422\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0439 \u0441\u043e \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0439\" (Tantsuy so mnoy\", Dance with me), but it wasn't what the band expected. Some of its songs were later reused in their first official album.\nTowards 1997, the trio noticed their club was losing their popularity. They found out that a rival disco opened in town, and people there were charged half as much. They discovered that disco had only one MC, young and motivated, close in style to Timofeev. They decided that it was the best to join forces with him. That's how Alexey Serov joined the band. His first contribution to the band was recording a skit where he asked to turn the music off using lots of expletives (used later in the song \"\u0417\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0431\u0430\u043b \u0422\u044b!\" but with expletives covered by radio parasite sounds), and his second contribution was recording vocals for the second and final version of the song \"\u0414\u0432\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0439-\u0434\u0432\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0439\" (\"Dvigay-dvigay\", Move it-move it).\n\n===First success===\nIn 1998, while Russia was in crisis, the band decided to record their second album (considered by many to be their first). They lacked the cash to pay for studio time, so they made a deal with the studio \"Soyuz\". At that time, the studio was working on a remix album for the Belorussian band [[Lyapis Trubetskoy]] called \"Lyapis-Dance\", and Diskoteka \"Avariya\" was asked to make four remixes for the album. They made three pure remixes, while the last one became a comic rap song using Lyapis Trubetskoy's chorus. The song, called \"\u0422\u044b \u043a\u0438\u043d\u0443\u043b\u0430\" (\"Ty kinula\", You dumped) became their first single and later, their first music video. The band then had enough money to record their first official album \"\u041f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u044f \u0438 \u043c\u0435\u043d\u044f\" (\"Pesnya pro tebya i menya\", Song about you and me). It was composed of three of the Lyapis Trubetskoy remixes (one of them was remade for this album as an instrumental track), some songs from \"\u0422\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0439 \u0441\u043e \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0439\", and some brand new material. Soon other albums were released and the band became one of the most popular Russian bands. \nAlexey Serov's law education has allowed the band to stay producer-free. Their one stint with a producer, Peter Volkov, was short-lived.\n\n===Back to three===\nAfter their album \"\u041c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u044f\u043a\u0438\"(\"Manyaki\", Maniacs) was released in 2001, Oleg Zhukov fell ill, and the band had to perform without him. 9 February 2002, Zhukov died of brain cancer.\nAfter Zhukov's death and a period of pause, the band decided to go on as a trio. They released their first music videos without Zhukov: \"\u0425\u0425\u0425\u0438\u0420\u041d\u0420\" (acronym for \"Hip-Hop, House and Rock'N'Roll\") and \"\u041d\u0435\u0431\u043e\" (\"Nebo\", Sky), the latter featuring international model [[Katia Elizarova]]. These videos featured new versions of songs from the album \"\u041c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u044f\u043a\u0438\", with different music, and Zhukov's lyrics either sung by Ryzhov, or dropped out.\nAfter releases of some famous singles, the band released in 2006 a new album called \"\u0427\u0435\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e \u041f\u0430\u0440\u043d\u0435\u0439\" (\"Chetvero Parney\", Four guys). It featured the song of the same name (although listed in the song list as an acronym of its title) which was recorded prior to the release of \"\u041c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u044f\u043a\u0438\", but the band lacked time to put it in the album. This song was the last new song released to feature Oleg Zhukov's vocals.<ref>http://avariya.ru/?p=biography (in Russian, the history of the band from their official website)</ref><ref>http://avariya.ru/?p=74 (in Russian, history of the band as seen by Alexey Serov)</ref><ref>http://avariya.ru/?p=77 (in Russian, history of the band, as seen by Alexey Ryzhov)</ref><ref>http://avariya.ru/?p=71 (in Russian, history of the band, as seen by Nikolay Timofeev)</ref>\n\n===Changes in style and lineup===\nIn 2011, the band released a new album \"\u041d\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f\" (\"Nedetskoe vremya\", A Time not for Kids), featuring a more electropop-sounding style, and for the first time the autotune was used. The album itself was released online for free.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.avariya.ru/media.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-08-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804104825/http://www.avariya.ru/media.aspx |archive-date=2012-08-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \n\nIn July 2012, Timofeev left the band<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.avariya.ru/news/2012/07/diskoteka-auaria-teper-bez-nikolaya-timofeeva.aspx |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-08-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103072446/http://www.avariya.ru/news/2012/07/diskoteka-auaria-teper-bez-nikolaya-timofeeva.aspx |archive-date=2018-01-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> to start his own solo career.
