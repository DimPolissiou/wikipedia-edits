However, he was actually arrested on a misdemeanor drug charge, which was incorrectly written as a felony at first due to a data entry error made by a jail clerk. The mistake was noticed by the jail two days after the arrest, but the change was not made. The FBI agent conducting the background check examination then called the wrong agency while making the inquiry into the drug charge, due to having limited information on law enforcement agencies in [[Lexington County, South Carolina|Lexington County]].

The mistake was noticed by the jail two days after the arrest, but the change was not made.

Originally a PhD thesis, the author adapted it into a book.<ref name=\"Financial-Times\">{{cite news |last1=Ben-Ami |first1=Daniel |title=Free market defined |url=https://www.ft.com/content/519636d2-4298-11e2-a3d2-00144feabdc0 |accessdate=30 July 2019 |publisher=Financial Times |date=13 December 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"Prospect\">{{cite news |last1=Burns |first1=Jennifer |title=The Measure of All Things |url=https://prospect.org/article/measure-all-things |accessdate=3 August 2019 |publisher=The American Prospect |date=3 December 2012}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Jones, neoliberalism began after the [[Great Depression]] as a movement of intellectuals committed to protecting [[liberalism|liberal]] values of [[individual liberty]] and [[limited government]], which they believed were threatened in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States]] by expanding government. They aimed to construct a distinctly new liberalism (hence \"neoliberalism\") by charting a middle way between the [[laissez-faire]] economics of the pre-[[Great Depression|Depression]] era and the \"[[collectivism]]\" of [[New Deal]] liberalism and British [[social democracy]]. He argues that between the 1950s and 1970s this commitment evolved into one of greater conviction in the superiority of the [[free market]], such that by the 1980s neoliberal policy proposals centered almost entirely around [[market liberalization]]. Modern neoliberalism, according to Jones, is associated with [[economic liberalism]], [[monetarism]], and a staunch support of [[free market]] [[capitalism]], and advocates political policies of [[deregulation]], [[privatization]], and other market-based reforms.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1}}\n\nJones structures the book around what he argues are the three phases of the history of neoliberalism. In the first, lasting from roughly 1920 until 1950, he details how early European neoliberal thinkers like [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Karl Popper]], motivated by expanding government and later the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe during [[World War II]], developed critiques of \"[[collectivism]]\", which to them included British [[social democracy]] and American [[New Deal]] liberalism. Particularly influential during this time was the formation of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], which brought together intellectuals committed to the defense of [[liberalism]] and [[individualism]]. In the second phase, lasting from roughly 1950 until 1980, the locus of neoliberal thought moved to the [[United States]], where academics like [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]] built upon the earlier neoliberal foundation by developing new academic and political arguments and introducing a range of neoliberal policy prescriptions. It was during this time that Jones contends neoliberal thought evolved from its more moderate early stance into a \"faith\" in the power and efficiency of markets. Jones argues that during this period a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, and [[think tanks]] arose to promote neoliberal ideology, slowly moving neoliberalism out of the political fringes and into the mainstream. The third phase, taking place after 1980, was the period of neoliberal political prominence. After a decade of [[stagflation]] in the United States and the United Kingdom, the neoliberal alternative to the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated politics was adopted by politicians, finding particular influence with US president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. This era, Jones notes, was characterized by sweeping [[deregulation]], [[market liberalization]], and [[tax cut|tax reductions]].\n\n==Structure==\nThe book is divided into an introduction, seven chapters, and a conclusion.<ref name =\"Masters\">{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9827.html|title=Masters of the Universe: Hayek, Friedman, and the Birth of Neoliberal Politics|last=Stedman Jones|first=Daniel|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0691151571|ref=harv}}</ref> \n* The introduction summarizes the history of [[neoliberalism]] and lays out the structure of the book. \n* Chapter one (\"The Postwar Settlement\") provides context for the rise of neoliberalism by briefly describing the development of [[embedded liberalism]] and [[Keynesianism]] after the [[Great Depression]]. \n* Chapter two (\"The 1940s: The Emergence of the Neoliberal Critique\") discusses the critiques of [[social democracy]] by the early neoliberals [[Karl Popper]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Friedrich Hayek]], and outlines the birth of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].\n* Chapter three (\"The Rising Tide: Neoliberal Ideas in the Postwar Period) discusses the two [[Chicago school of economics|Chicago School]]s, the relation of [[Adam Smith]] to neoliberalism, the early ideas of [[Milton Friedman]], the [[ordoliberal]]s in [[West Germany]], and the economic theories of [[regulatory capture]], [[public choice]], and [[rational choice theory]]. \n* Chapter four (\"A Transatlantic Nework: Think Tanks and the Ideological Entrepreneurs\") discusses [[fusionism]] in the [[United States]], [[conservatism]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] during the 1950s, the growth of neoliberal organizations and [[think tanks]] from the 1950s through the 1970s, and the spread of neoliberal thought to journalists and politicians. \n* Chapter five (\"Keynesianism and the Emergence of Monetarism, 1945\u201371) discusses [[Keynesianism]], American economic policy in the 1960s, and the development of [[monetarism]] by Milton Friedman. \n* Chapter six (\"Economic Strategy: The Neoliberal Breakthrough, 1971-84\") discusses the [[stagflation]] of the 1970s in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] and how it set the stage for the political rise of [[monetarism]], which ushered in further neoliberal reforms; it continues with a description of the neoliberal policies of British prime ministers [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]], [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Denis Healey]], US presidents [[Jimmy Carter]] and [[Ronald Reagan]], and [[Chair of the Federal Reserve]] [[Paul Volcker]]. \n* Chapter seven (\"Neoliberalism Applied?

However, it was during this time that neoliberal thought was refined and spread, creating a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, university departments and [[think tank]]s promoting neoliberal ideas.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} The locus of neoliberal thought shifted from Europe to the United States, with the American intellectuals [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]], as well as the larger [[Chicago school of economics]] they were a part of, becoming increasingly influential.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}} Neoliberal thought evolved: whereas the neoliberalism that had emerged during the [[interwar period|interwar years]] had been a \"nuanced response\" to war, depression and totalitarian regimes, late-twentieth-century neoliberalism became dominated by [[market liberalization]] and [[globalization]], and galvanized around a defense of the superiority of [[free market]]s to government [[Planned economy|economic planning]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\nThe third phase, lasting from 1980 onward (the book was released in 2012), is the period of neoliberal political hegemony. Jones suggests that the high [[inflation]] and low [[economic growth]] in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] during the 1970s chipped away at the Keynesian political consensus, which seemed unable to address the decade's [[stagflation]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|215}} Jones argues that the transatlantic neoliberal network provided a compelling alternative economic ideology\u2014one that conveniently included [[monetarism]], an economic theory dealing with inflation.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|216}} Jones asserts that this led to the widespread political acceptance of neoliberal policies in the 1980s, which brought with it a greater acceptance of neoliberal ideology.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|270}} Jones maintains that, contrary to the opinion of some observers, the adoption of neoliberal policies was not an inevitability; they were not necessarily the \"right\" policies for the challenges of the era, but instead found political power through an \"unpredictable, patchy\" process that had \"luck and historical contingency\" as central players.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|333}} The left-leaning [[Carter administration]] and [[Callaghan government]] were the first to implement particular neoliberal policies,<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|269}} but neoliberalism would find its greatest impact with US president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who would each successfully advance agendas of [[deregulation]], [[tax cut]]s, and [[market liberalization]]. Jones argues that while these incremental policy changes did not require a wholesale acceptance of neoliberal philosophy, by the late 1980s that is exactly what had happened. Neoliberal ideas on the superiority of the market and [[individual liberty]] became widely accepted by politicians and academics, and Jones contends that this \"boundless belief in markets and deregulation\" ultimately led to the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]].<ref name=\"Masters\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\n===First phase: Early history (1920\u20131950)===\nAccording to Jones, neoliberalism traces its earliest beginnings to the establishment of the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann]] in 1938. The [[Great Depression]] left the reputation of [[economic liberalism]] in tatters, and the scholars at the society sought to \"reconstruct a theory of liberalism\" because they believed that \"[[classical liberalism]] was under assault\". They called this reconstruction \"neoliberalism\" to signify that they were not simply accepting [[laissez-faire]] economics but were developing a new vision of economic liberalism. Ultimately, however, the ideas promoted at the colloquium did not take political hold, and at the outset of [[World War II]] the colloquium was largely forgotten.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|31}}\n\nThe destruction wrought by [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes during World War II would, however, energize a number of liberal thinkers in their opposition to [[collectivism]]. From this fear of collectivism emerged the early influential neoliberal texts critiquing [[social democracy]], and led to the formation of a new neoliberal organization by many of the same individuals present at the Colloque Walter Lippman: the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|30\u201331}}\n\n====Mont Pelerin Society====\n[[File:Hoff i Mont Pelerin society.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Trygve J.

Instead, it acted as \"a siren call, a warning about the tragic possibilities of moving in the direction\" of greater collectivist government intervention \"which Western politics, economy, and society seemed to be moving.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|84}} Importantly, Jones argues it helped to \"create a transatlantic neoliberal network that would...combat the [[New Deal]] and social-democratic political establishments in Britain and the United States\", \"combat the forces of [[collectivism]]\", and refine neoliberal thought into a workable set of policies.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|32}}\n\n===Second phase: Emergence of a transatlantic neoliberal network (1950\u20131980)===\nJones outlines how a transatlantic network of neoliberal intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, university departments, and think tanks arose between 1950 and 1980 and, building on the foundations of the critiques of [[New Deal]] liberalism and [[social democracy]] of the early neoliberals, refined and popularized neoliberal ideas to the point that \"they eventually seemed the natural alternative to liberal or [[social democracy|social democratic]] policies\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|153}} This network would serve \"almost like a kind of Neoliberal International\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|218}} that would be highly influential in the later adoption of neoliberal policies by the governments of the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} During this time, the locus of neoliberal thought shifted from Europe to America, with the American economist [[Milton Friedman]] becoming its most influential proponent\u2014its \"beating heart\", as Jones describes it.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|135}} Neoliberalism, according to Jones, evolved from an attempt to find a middle way between [[laissez-faire]] capitalism and collectivism into a \"faith in free markets\", often articulating \"individual liberty in apocalyptic terms as a struggle between free societies and [[communist]] [[totalitarianism]]\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|345,116}} Neoliberals of the era emphasized the need to recover \"lost truths\" from [[classical liberalism]], including the value of [[individual liberty]], the [[invisible hand]] of the free market, and the virtues of [[limited government]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|101}} By the 1960s, Jones contends, neoliberal thought had established a \"distinct and coherent identity\" centered around \"individual liberty, free markets, spontaneous order, the price mechanism, competition, consumerism, deregulation, and rational self-interest.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|132}} Additionally, during this period a body of policy prescriptions was injected into neoliberalism.\n\nJones points to an early essay by [[Milton Friedman]] entitled [https://miltonfriedman.hoover.org/objects/57816/neoliberalism-and-its-prospects?ctx=b8c0f32e-f5a4-4e53-ba3d-cf017b993579&idx=0 \"Neoliberalism and its Prospects\"] as a \"bridge\" between the first phase of neoliberal thought\u2014dominated by European conerns\u2014and the second phase, centered in the United States and concerned more with economic freedom and the superiority of markets.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|6}} Jones considers the essay a \"useful marker of the moment when neoliberalism became a self-conscious political and economic concept in the United States\", as it was one of the first instances in which an American writer claimed the neoliberal moniker.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|96}} In the essay Friedman makes a quintessentially first-phase argument for a \"new faith\" between [[collectivism]], which he believed leads to an over-mighty state, and [[laissez-faire]] economics, which he believed fostered the development of over-mighty individuals.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Friedman |first1=Milton |title=Neo-Liberalism and its Prospects |url=https://miltonfriedman.hoover.org/objects/57816/neoliberalism-and-its-prospects?ctx=b8c0f32e-f5a4-4e53-ba3d-cf017b993579&idx=0 |accessdate=25 July 2019 |publisher=Farmand |date=17 February 1951}}</ref><ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|96}} However, the essay marked a \"symbolic cutting off point\" in neoliberal thought, signifying the point in time when neoliberalism began to shift away from the early \"middle way\" arguments to a more strident belief in free markets. Friedman himself advocated a level of government intervention in the essay which he would never again publicly support.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|97}}\n\n====Academic thought====\nAccording to Jones: \"After 1945, a distinct neoliberal worldview was built on the foundations of the critique of [[New Deal]] liberalism and [[social democracy]] synthesized in the writings of [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], and [[Karl Popper]]...Its main tenets\u2014philosophical, political, and economic\u2014were worked out in detail by scholars such as [[Milton Friedman]], [[George Stigler]], [[Gary Becker]], [[James Buchanan]], and [[Gordon Tullock]], as well as Hayek and Mises.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}}\n\nJones asserts that the [[Chicago school of economics]], of which Friedman and Stigler were a part, was \"perhaps the most influential group in terms of the development of transatlantic neoliberal politics\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|89}} In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s Chicago economists published influential works arguing for [[free market]] policies and extending free market analyses into new regions (e.g. law and regulation). They painted a hostile portrait of [[trade unions]] and presented [[monopoly|monopolies]] as mostly benign.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|92\u201393}}\n\nThe theories of [[regulatory capture]], [[public choice theory]], and [[rational choice theory]] all became influential to neoliberal thought, according to Jones, because they connected the market to politics and the public sector, and helped the neoliberal view of free markets seep into mainstream public and political consciousness.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|126\u2013133}} The economist George Stigler argued that government regulatory bodies often become captured by private industry, so that these bodies act in the interests of private corporations rather than in the public's interest\u2014a notion known as \"regulatory capture\". James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, considered the \"fathers of public choice theory\", emphasized the imperfections of political institutions and constitutional mechanisms, and argued voters have a tendency to vote their own interest rather than in the public interest.\n\n====Milton Friedman and monetarism====\n[[File:Portrait of Milton Friedman.jpg|thumb|[[Milton Friedman]]]]\n[[Milton Friedman]] became a leading figure of neoliberal thought and a prominent public intellectual in the 1950s. An American, Friedman was less influenced by the effects of [[World War II]] than by the subsequent [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Jones argues that for neoliberals \"the Cold War necessitated the unambiguous advocacy of the superiority of the market\", and Friedman framed the \"war of ideas\" between [[socialism]] and free-market [[capitalism]] as a \"life-or-death struggle.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|101,120}}\n\nJones argues that \"Friedman's significant contribution to neoliberal thought was his connection of [[economic freedom]] with [[political freedom]]\", which he made in his popular book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (which Jones describes as the \"American ''[[Road to Serfdom]]''\").<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|116}} Friedman argued that free markets and liberal democracy are inseparable, that the market guarantees basic political freedoms by ensuring that alternatives are always available (e.g. alternative employment options or alternative goods), guarantees equality by separating divorcing economic activities from reasons unrelated to an individual's [[productivity]], and protects dissent by separating economic power (i.e. the ability to make money) from political power (in other words, politicians cannot deprive an individual of employment if they express political dissent).<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|117,121}} Friedman consistently pointed out his view that \"increases in economic freedom have gone hand in hand with increases in political and civil freedom and have led to increased prosperity; competitive capitalism and freedom have become inseparable\", and pointed to countries like [[China]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Chile]] to justify this.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|121}}\n\nJones notes that Friedman was a harsh critic of government intervention in the economy. A key point of ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', according to Jones, was outlining government failure, including in the areas of railroad regulation, [[labor law]], [[monetary policy|monetary]] reform, agriculture, [[public housing]], [[social security]] legislation, [[foreign aid]], [[urban redevelopment]], and [[income tax]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|118}} In ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', Friedman blamed the [[Great Depression]] on overly tight monetary policy by the [[Federal Reserve]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|202}} Friedman linked [[New Deal]] liberalism with [[socialism]] and [[communism]], while he considered his own ideas as a part of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] family.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|119}}\n\nFriedman's development of the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory [[monetarism]] was particularly influential to neoliberalism. Jones argues that the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated political thought in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] for decades had prioritized low [[unemployment]] over [[inflation]]. In contrast, by the 1950s neoliberal thinkers began to emphasize inflation.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|193}} Friedman ultimately developed [[monetarism]], a [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory dealing with [[inflation]] and the [[supply of money]] that suggested that the Keynesian view that government can achieve [[full employment]] at the cost of limited inflation was incorrect and would lead to higher inflation in the [[Long run and short run|long run]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Friedman argued that governments and central banks, rather than focusing on employment, should focus on ensuring a constant and predictable level of [[monetary inflation|monetary growth]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Jones describes monetarism as \"the most consistent, systematic, and significant alternative economic strategy to Keynesian demand management and fine-tuning\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|201}} This, according to Jones, primed neoliberal theory for political acceptance in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], who would experience persistent [[stagflation]] during the 1970s. Jones sums it up as such: \"Friedman's monetarist analysis and market solutions grabbed people's attention as a ready-made and plausible alternative strategy [to Keynesianism] when the economy began to unravel [in the 1970s] under the weight of stagflation\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n====Think tanks====\nIn Britain and the United States, the neoliberal right built a \"dazzling array of think tanks\", which became the preferred vehicle of neoliberal thinkers.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|336}} Notable among these, according to Jones, were the [[American Enterprise Institute]], the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], the [[Heritage Foundation]], the [[Cato Institute]], the [[Adam Smith Institute]], and a group of think tanks emanating out of the [[Atlas Network|Atlas Foundation]], including the [[Fraser Institute]], the Fisher Institute, and the [[Manhattan Institute]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} These think tanks brought politicians and businesspeople into contact with neoliberal ideas and thinkers and raised the public profile of free-market policies. In particular, the Heritage Foundation had a significant influence on US president [[Ronald Reagan]]\u2014claiming on its website that nearly two-thirds of the proposals they suggested to him in their policy guide ''[[Mandate for Leadership]]'' were implemented<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blasko |first1=Andrew |title=REAGAN AND HERITAGE: A Unique Partnership |url=https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/reagan-and-heritage-unique-partnership |website=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref>\u2014while the Adam Smith Institute had appreciable sway with the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]]. Jones notes that many of these institutes were funded by wealthy businessmen, such as [[Charles Koch]] and [[Joseph Coors]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\n====Relation to conservatism====\nFree market economics has been associated with the [[political right]], but Jones emphasizes that it is \"but one branch\" of it.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|138}} In the United States, he argues that the right had a number of often-competing interests (principally [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]], [[anticommunism]], and [[neoliberalism]]), but the \"distinctive feature of the conservative revival in the 1950s and 1960s was the ability of its disparate elements to unite under the banners of [[anticommunism]] and [[states' rights]]\"\u2014a union that became known as \"[[fusionism]]\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|140}} This union, which Jones largely credits [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] for achieving, led to the growth of a conservative establishment that would, after decades of decline, rival its liberal opponents.

The collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] in 1971 indicated the end of the experiment with [[fixed exchange rates]]. The assumption that there was a relatively simple and manipulable trade-off between [[inflation]] and [[employment]], the famous [[Phillips Curve]]...proved to be a dangerous illusion...In both Britain and the United States, the appearance of [[stagflation]]...meant that governments felt forced to change course.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1\u20132}}|align = right |width = 20%}}\nJones notes that there were two major issues facing the United States and the United Kingdom at the end of the 1960s: the instability of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] and high [[inflation]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|219\u2013220}} As Jones describes it: \"the late 1960s and early 1970s brought a succession of economic shocks that undermined the postwar international monetary system and pushed the world economy into stormy waters.

They aimed to construct a distinctly new liberalism (hence \"neoliberalism\") by charting a middle way between the [[laissez-faire]] economics of the pre-[[Great Depression|Depression]] era and the \"[[collectivism]]\" of [[New Deal]] liberalism and British [[social democracy]]. He argues that between the 1950s and 1970s this commitment evolved into one of greater conviction in the superiority of the [[free market]], such that by the 1980s neoliberal policy proposals centered almost entirely around [[market liberalization]]. Modern neoliberalism, according to Jones, is associated with [[economic liberalism]], [[monetarism]], and a staunch support of [[free market]] [[capitalism]], and advocates political policies of [[deregulation]], [[privatization]], and other market-based reforms.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1}}\n\nJones structures the book around what he argues are the three phases of the history of neoliberalism. In the first, lasting from roughly 1920 until 1950, he details how early European neoliberal thinkers like [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Ludwig von Mises]], and [[Karl Popper]], motivated by expanding government and later the rise of totalitarian regimes in Europe during [[World War II]], developed critiques of \"[[collectivism]]\", which to them included British [[social democracy]] and American [[New Deal]] liberalism. Particularly influential during this time was the formation of the [[Mont Pelerin Society]], which brought together intellectuals committed to the defense of [[liberalism]] and [[individualism]]. In the second phase, lasting from roughly 1950 until 1980, the locus of neoliberal thought moved to the [[United States]], where academics like [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]] built upon the earlier neoliberal foundation by developing new academic and political arguments and introducing a range of neoliberal policy prescriptions. It was during this time that Jones contends neoliberal thought evolved from its more moderate early stance into a \"faith\" in the power and efficiency of markets. Jones argues that during this period a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, and [[think tanks]] arose to promote neoliberal ideology, slowly moving neoliberalism out of the political fringes and into the mainstream. The third phase, taking place after 1980, was the period of neoliberal political prominence. After a decade of [[stagflation]] in the United States and the United Kingdom, the neoliberal alternative to the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated politics was adopted by politicians, finding particular influence with US president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]].

Together, these strands were called '[[collectivism]]' by neoliberals.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|329}}|align = right |width = 20%}}\n\nThe author divides the history of neoliberalism into three phases.\n\nIn the first phase, lasting from 1920 to 1950, Jones contends that the crises of the [[Great Depression]] and [[Second World War]] produced two competing economic ideologies: [[Keynesianism]] and [[neoliberalism]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|22}} Keynesianism, developed by economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] and motivated by the widespread [[unemployment]] during the Great Depression, viewed government intervention in the economy as a means to alleviate [[economic downturn]]s and achieve [[full employment]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|24}} Neoliberalism, promoted by economists like [[Friedrich Hayek]], [[Milton Friedman]], and [[Ludwig von Mises]] and arising out of fears of [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes like the [[Nazi]]s, [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Soviet communists]], and [[Italian fascism|Italian fascists]], viewed increasing government intervention as a threat to [[economic freedom|economic]] and [[political freedom]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|22}} Early neoliberal thought, according to Jones, focused on defending [[liberalism]] and critiquing all forms of [[collectivism]], and in particular on critiquing [[New Deal]] liberalism and British [[social democracy]], which they believed posed a \"grave threat to the continued existence of Western civilization\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|23,136}}\n\nIn the second phase, lasting from 1950 to 1980, Jones notes that Keynesianism dominated political policy while neoliberal thought was mostly confined to universities and [[think tanks]]. However, it was during this time that neoliberal thought was refined and spread, creating a transatlantic network of intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, university departments and [[think tank]]s promoting neoliberal ideas.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} The locus of neoliberal thought shifted from Europe to the United States, with the American intellectuals [[Milton Friedman]] and [[George Stigler]], as well as the larger [[Chicago school of economics]] they were a part of, becoming increasingly influential.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}} Neoliberal thought evolved: whereas the neoliberalism that had emerged during the [[interwar period|interwar years]] had been a \"nuanced response\" to war, depression and totalitarian regimes, late-twentieth-century neoliberalism became dominated by [[market liberalization]] and [[globalization]], and galvanized around a defense of the superiority of [[free market]]s to government [[Planned economy|economic planning]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|4\u20135}}\n\nThe third phase, lasting from 1980 onward (the book was released in 2012), is the period of neoliberal political hegemony. Jones suggests that the high [[inflation]] and low [[economic growth]] in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] during the 1970s chipped away at the Keynesian political consensus, which seemed unable to address the decade's [[stagflation]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|215}} Jones argues that the transatlantic neoliberal network provided a compelling alternative economic ideology\u2014one that conveniently included [[monetarism]], an economic theory dealing with inflation.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|216}} Jones asserts that this led to the widespread political acceptance of neoliberal policies in the 1980s, which brought with it a greater acceptance of neoliberal ideology.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|270}} Jones maintains that, contrary to the opinion of some observers, the adoption of neoliberal policies was not an inevitability; they were not necessarily the \"right\" policies for the challenges of the era, but instead found political power through an \"unpredictable, patchy\" process that had \"luck and historical contingency\" as central players.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|333}} The left-leaning [[Carter administration]] and [[Callaghan government]] were the first to implement particular neoliberal policies,<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|269}} but neoliberalism would find its greatest impact with US president [[Ronald Reagan]] and British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who would each successfully advance agendas of [[deregulation]], [[tax cut]]s, and [[market liberalization]]. Jones argues that while these incremental policy changes did not require a wholesale acceptance of neoliberal philosophy, by the late 1980s that is exactly what had happened. Neoliberal ideas on the superiority of the market and [[individual liberty]] became widely accepted by politicians and academics, and Jones contends that this \"boundless belief in markets and deregulation\" ultimately led to the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]].<ref name=\"Masters\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\n===First phase: Early history (1920\u20131950)===\nAccording to Jones, neoliberalism traces its earliest beginnings to the establishment of the [[Colloque Walter Lippmann]] in 1938. The [[Great Depression]] left the reputation of [[economic liberalism]] in tatters, and the scholars at the society sought to \"reconstruct a theory of liberalism\" because they believed that \"[[classical liberalism]] was under assault\". They called this reconstruction \"neoliberalism\" to signify that they were not simply accepting [[laissez-faire]] economics but were developing a new vision of economic liberalism. Ultimately, however, the ideas promoted at the colloquium did not take political hold, and at the outset of [[World War II]] the colloquium was largely forgotten.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|31}}\n\nThe destruction wrought by [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] regimes during World War II would, however, energize a number of liberal thinkers in their opposition to [[collectivism]]. From this fear of collectivism emerged the early influential neoliberal texts critiquing [[social democracy]], and led to the formation of a new neoliberal organization by many of the same individuals present at the Colloque Walter Lippman: the [[Mont Pelerin Society]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|30\u201331}}\n\n====Mont Pelerin Society====\n[[File:Hoff i Mont Pelerin society.png|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Trygve J.

Instead, it acted as \"a siren call, a warning about the tragic possibilities of moving in the direction\" of greater collectivist government intervention \"which Western politics, economy, and society seemed to be moving.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|84}} Importantly, Jones argues it helped to \"create a transatlantic neoliberal network that would...combat the [[New Deal]] and social-democratic political establishments in Britain and the United States\", \"combat the forces of [[collectivism]]\", and refine neoliberal thought into a workable set of policies.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|32}}\n\n===Second phase: Emergence of a transatlantic neoliberal network (1950\u20131980)===\nJones outlines how a transatlantic network of neoliberal intellectuals, businessmen, journalists, university departments, and think tanks arose between 1950 and 1980 and, building on the foundations of the critiques of [[New Deal]] liberalism and [[social democracy]] of the early neoliberals, refined and popularized neoliberal ideas to the point that \"they eventually seemed the natural alternative to liberal or [[social democracy|social democratic]] policies\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|153}} This network would serve \"almost like a kind of Neoliberal International\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|218}} that would be highly influential in the later adoption of neoliberal policies by the governments of the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} During this time, the locus of neoliberal thought shifted from Europe to America, with the American economist [[Milton Friedman]] becoming its most influential proponent\u2014its \"beating heart\", as Jones describes it.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|135}} Neoliberalism, according to Jones, evolved from an attempt to find a middle way between [[laissez-faire]] capitalism and collectivism into a \"faith in free markets\", often articulating \"individual liberty in apocalyptic terms as a struggle between free societies and [[communist]] [[totalitarianism]]\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|345,116}} Neoliberals of the era emphasized the need to recover \"lost truths\" from [[classical liberalism]], including the value of [[individual liberty]], the [[invisible hand]] of the free market, and the virtues of [[limited government]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|101}} By the 1960s, Jones contends, neoliberal thought had established a \"distinct and coherent identity\" centered around \"individual liberty, free markets, spontaneous order, the price mechanism, competition, consumerism, deregulation, and rational self-interest.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|132}} Additionally, during this period a body of policy prescriptions was injected into neoliberalism.\n\nJones points to an early essay by [[Milton Friedman]] entitled [https://miltonfriedman.hoover.org/objects/57816/neoliberalism-and-its-prospects?ctx=b8c0f32e-f5a4-4e53-ba3d-cf017b993579&idx=0 \"Neoliberalism and its Prospects\"] as a \"bridge\" between the first phase of neoliberal thought\u2014dominated by European conerns\u2014and the second phase, centered in the United States and concerned more with economic freedom and the superiority of markets.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|6}} Jones considers the essay a \"useful marker of the moment when neoliberalism became a self-conscious political and economic concept in the United States\", as it was one of the first instances in which an American writer claimed the neoliberal moniker.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|96}} In the essay Friedman makes a quintessentially first-phase argument for a \"new faith\" between [[collectivism]], which he believed leads to an over-mighty state, and [[laissez-faire]] economics, which he believed fostered the development of over-mighty individuals.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Friedman |first1=Milton |title=Neo-Liberalism and its Prospects |url=https://miltonfriedman.hoover.org/objects/57816/neoliberalism-and-its-prospects?ctx=b8c0f32e-f5a4-4e53-ba3d-cf017b993579&idx=0 |accessdate=25 July 2019 |publisher=Farmand |date=17 February 1951}}</ref><ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|96}} However, the essay marked a \"symbolic cutting off point\" in neoliberal thought, signifying the point in time when neoliberalism began to shift away from the early \"middle way\" arguments to a more strident belief in free markets. Friedman himself advocated a level of government intervention in the essay which he would never again publicly support.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|97}}\n\n====Academic thought====\nAccording to Jones: \"After 1945, a distinct neoliberal worldview was built on the foundations of the critique of [[New Deal]] liberalism and [[social democracy]] synthesized in the writings of [[Ludwig von Mises]], [[Friedrich Hayek]], and [[Karl Popper]]...Its main tenets\u2014philosophical, political, and economic\u2014were worked out in detail by scholars such as [[Milton Friedman]], [[George Stigler]], [[Gary Becker]], [[James Buchanan]], and [[Gordon Tullock]], as well as Hayek and Mises.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|85}}\n\nJones asserts that the [[Chicago school of economics]], of which Friedman and Stigler were a part, was \"perhaps the most influential group in terms of the development of transatlantic neoliberal politics\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|89}} In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s Chicago economists published influential works arguing for [[free market]] policies and extending free market analyses into new regions (e.g. law and regulation). They painted a hostile portrait of [[trade unions]] and presented [[monopoly|monopolies]] as mostly benign.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|92\u201393}}\n\nThe theories of [[regulatory capture]], [[public choice theory]], and [[rational choice theory]] all became influential to neoliberal thought, according to Jones, because they connected the market to politics and the public sector, and helped the neoliberal view of free markets seep into mainstream public and political consciousness.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|126\u2013133}} The economist George Stigler argued that government regulatory bodies often become captured by private industry, so that these bodies act in the interests of private corporations rather than in the public's interest\u2014a notion known as \"regulatory capture\". James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, considered the \"fathers of public choice theory\", emphasized the imperfections of political institutions and constitutional mechanisms, and argued voters have a tendency to vote their own interest rather than in the public interest.\n\n====Milton Friedman and monetarism====\n[[File:Portrait of Milton Friedman.jpg|thumb|[[Milton Friedman]]]]\n[[Milton Friedman]] became a leading figure of neoliberal thought and a prominent public intellectual in the 1950s. An American, Friedman was less influenced by the effects of [[World War II]] than by the subsequent [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. Jones argues that for neoliberals \"the Cold War necessitated the unambiguous advocacy of the superiority of the market\", and Friedman framed the \"war of ideas\" between [[socialism]] and free-market [[capitalism]] as a \"life-or-death struggle.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|101,120}}\n\nJones argues that \"Friedman's significant contribution to neoliberal thought was his connection of [[economic freedom]] with [[political freedom]]\", which he made in his popular book ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'' (which Jones describes as the \"American ''[[Road to Serfdom]]''\").<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|116}} Friedman argued that free markets and liberal democracy are inseparable, that the market guarantees basic political freedoms by ensuring that alternatives are always available (e.g. alternative employment options or alternative goods), guarantees equality by separating divorcing economic activities from reasons unrelated to an individual's [[productivity]], and protects dissent by separating economic power (i.e. the ability to make money) from political power (in other words, politicians cannot deprive an individual of employment if they express political dissent).<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|117,121}} Friedman consistently pointed out his view that \"increases in economic freedom have gone hand in hand with increases in political and civil freedom and have led to increased prosperity; competitive capitalism and freedom have become inseparable\", and pointed to countries like [[China]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and [[Chile]] to justify this.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|121}}\n\nJones notes that Friedman was a harsh critic of government intervention in the economy. A key point of ''[[Capitalism and Freedom]]'', according to Jones, was outlining government failure, including in the areas of railroad regulation, [[labor law]], [[monetary policy|monetary]] reform, agriculture, [[public housing]], [[social security]] legislation, [[foreign aid]], [[urban redevelopment]], and [[income tax]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|118}} In ''[[A Monetary History of the United States]]'', Friedman blamed the [[Great Depression]] on overly tight monetary policy by the [[Federal Reserve]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|202}} Friedman linked [[New Deal]] liberalism with [[socialism]] and [[communism]], while he considered his own ideas as a part of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] family.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|119}}\n\nFriedman's development of the [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory [[monetarism]] was particularly influential to neoliberalism. Jones argues that the [[Keynesian]] consensus that had dominated political thought in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] for decades had prioritized low [[unemployment]] over [[inflation]]. In contrast, by the 1950s neoliberal thinkers began to emphasize inflation.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|193}} Friedman ultimately developed [[monetarism]], a [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] theory dealing with [[inflation]] and the [[supply of money]] that suggested that the Keynesian view that government can achieve [[full employment]] at the cost of limited inflation was incorrect and would lead to higher inflation in the [[Long run and short run|long run]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Friedman argued that governments and central banks, rather than focusing on employment, should focus on ensuring a constant and predictable level of [[monetary inflation|monetary growth]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|207}} Jones describes monetarism as \"the most consistent, systematic, and significant alternative economic strategy to Keynesian demand management and fine-tuning\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|201}} This, according to Jones, primed neoliberal theory for political acceptance in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], who would experience persistent [[stagflation]] during the 1970s. Jones sums it up as such: \"Friedman's monetarist analysis and market solutions grabbed people's attention as a ready-made and plausible alternative strategy [to Keynesianism] when the economy began to unravel [in the 1970s] under the weight of stagflation\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|212}}\n\n====Think tanks====\nIn Britain and the United States, the neoliberal right built a \"dazzling array of think tanks\", which became the preferred vehicle of neoliberal thinkers.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|336}} Notable among these, according to Jones, were the [[American Enterprise Institute]], the [[Foundation for Economic Education]], the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]], the [[Heritage Foundation]], the [[Cato Institute]], the [[Adam Smith Institute]], and a group of think tanks emanating out of the [[Atlas Network|Atlas Foundation]], including the [[Fraser Institute]], the Fisher Institute, and the [[Manhattan Institute]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|134}} These think tanks brought politicians and businesspeople into contact with neoliberal ideas and thinkers and raised the public profile of free-market policies. In particular, the Heritage Foundation had a significant influence on US president [[Ronald Reagan]]\u2014claiming on its website that nearly two-thirds of the proposals they suggested to him in their policy guide ''[[Mandate for Leadership]]'' were implemented<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blasko |first1=Andrew |title=REAGAN AND HERITAGE: A Unique Partnership |url=https://www.heritage.org/conservatism/commentary/reagan-and-heritage-unique-partnership |website=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref>\u2014while the Adam Smith Institute had appreciable sway with the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]]. Jones notes that many of these institutes were funded by wealthy businessmen, such as [[Charles Koch]] and [[Joseph Coors]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|163\u2013164}}\n\n====Relation to conservatism====\nFree market economics has been associated with the [[political right]], but Jones emphasizes that it is \"but one branch\" of it.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|138}} In the United States, he argues that the right had a number of often-competing interests (principally [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]], [[anticommunism]], and [[neoliberalism]]), but that the \"distinctive feature of the conservative revival in the 1950s and 1960s was the ability of its disparate elements to unite under the banners of [[anticommunism]] and [[states' rights]]\"\u2014a union that became known as \"[[fusionism]]\".<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|140}} This union, which Jones largely credits [[William F. Buckley Jr.]] for achieving, led to the growth of a conservative establishment that would, after decades of decline, rival its liberal opponents. This \"pave[d] the way for the later electoral successes of Ronald Reagan,\" which would usher in neoliberal policies.<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|146}}\n\n===Third phase: Policy implementation (1980 onward)===\n{{Quote box|quote = \"The demise of the postwar economic settlement had been hastened by a series of catastrophic events: the [[Vietnam War]], the first [[1973 oil crisis|oil shock of 1973]], and the near collapse of [[industrial relations]] in Britain.

The collapse of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] in 1971 indicated the end of the experiment with [[fixed exchange rates]]. The assumption that there was a relatively simple and manipulable trade-off between [[inflation]] and [[employment]], the famous [[Phillips Curve]]...proved to be a dangerous illusion...In both Britain and the United States, the appearance of [[stagflation]]...meant that governments felt forced to change course.\"<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|1\u20132}}|align = right |width = 20%}}\nJones notes that there were two major issues facing the United States and the United Kingdom at the end of the 1960s: the instability of the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods international monetary system]] and high [[inflation]].<ref name =\"Masters\"/>{{rp|219\u2013220}} As Jones describes it: \"the late 1960s and early 1970s brought a succession of economic shocks that undermined the postwar international monetary system and pushed the world economy into stormy waters.

Karzanov|year=1973|txt}}.{{sfnp|Dinitz|2006}} As in previous methods for matching such as the [[Hungarian algorithm]] and the work of {{harvtxt|Edmonds|1965}}, the Hopcroft\u2013Karp algorithm repeatedly increases the size of a partial matching by finding augmenting paths: sequences of edges that alternate between being in and out of the matching, such that swapping which edges of the path are in and which are out of the matching produces a larger matching. However, instead of finding just a single augmenting path per iteration, the algorithm finds a maximal set of shortest augmenting paths. As a result, only <math>O(\\sqrt{|V|})</math> iterations are needed. The same principle has also been used to develop more complicated algorithms for non-bipartite matching with the same asymptotic running time as the Hopcroft\u2013Karp algorithm.\n\n==Augmenting paths==\nA vertex that is not the endpoint of an edge in some partial matching <math>M</math> is called a ''free vertex''. The basic concept that the algorithm relies on is that of an ''augmenting path'', a path that starts at a free vertex, ends at a free vertex, and alternates between unmatched and matched edges within the path. It follows from this definition that, except for the endpoints, all other vertices (if any) in augmenting path must be non-free vertices. An augmenting path could consist of only two vertices (both free) and single unmatched edge between them.\n\nIf <math>M</math> is a matching, and <math>P</math> is an augmenting path relative to <math>M</math>, then the [[symmetric difference]] of the two sets of edges, <math>M \\oplus P</math>, would form a matching with size <math>|M| + 1</math>. Thus, by finding augmenting paths, an algorithm may increase the size of the matching.\n\nConversely, suppose that a matching <math>M</math> is not optimal, and let <math>P</math> be the symmetric difference <math>M \\oplus M^*</math> where <math>M^*</math> is an optimal matching. Because <math>M</math> and <math>M^*</math> are both matchings, every vertex has degree at most 2 in <math>P</math>. So <math>P</math> must form a collection of disjoint cycles, of paths with an equal number of matched and unmatched edges in <math>M</math>, of augmenting paths for <math>M</math>, and of augmenting paths for <math>M^*</math>; but the latter is impossible because <math>M^*</math> is optimal. Now, the cycles and the paths with equal numbers of matched and unmatched vertices do not contribute to the  difference in size between <math>M</math> and <math>M^*</math>, so this difference is equal to the number of augmenting paths for <math>M</math> in <math>P</math>. Thus, whenever there exists a matching <math>M^*</math> larger than the current matching <math>M</math>, there must also exist an augmenting path. If no augmenting path can be found, an algorithm may safely terminate, since in this case <math>M</math> must be optimal.\n\nAn augmenting path in a matching problem is closely related to the [[augmenting path]]s arising in [[maximum flow problem]]s, paths along which one may increase the amount of flow between the terminals of the flow. It is possible to transform the bipartite matching problem into a maximum flow instance, such that the alternating paths of the matching problem become augmenting paths of the flow problem.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ahuja|Magnanti|Orlin|1993}}, section 12.3, bipartite cardinality matching problem, pp. 469\u2013470.</ref> In fact, a generalization of the technique used in Hopcroft\u2013Karp algorithm to arbitrary flow networks is known as [[Dinic's algorithm]].\n\n==Algorithm==\nThe algorithm may be expressed in the following [[pseudocode]].\n\n: '''Input''': Bipartite graph <math>G(U \\cup V, E)</math>\n: '''Output''': Matching <math>M \\subseteq E</math>\n: <math>M \\leftarrow \\empty</math>\n: '''repeat'''\n:: <math>\\mathcal P \\leftarrow \\{P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_k\\}</math> ''maximal set of vertex-disjoint shortest augmenting paths''\n:: <math>M \\leftarrow M \\oplus (P_1 \\cup P_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup P_k)</math>\n: '''until''' <math>\\mathcal P = \\empty</math>\n\nIn more detail, let <math>U</math> and <math>V</math> be the two sets in the bipartition of <math>G</math>, and let the matching from <math>U</math> to <math>V</math> at any time be represented as the set <math>M</math>.\nThe algorithm is run in phases. Each phase consists of the following steps.\n* A [[breadth-first search]] partitions the vertices of the graph into layers. The free vertices in <math>U</math> are used as the starting vertices of this search and form the first layer of the partitioning. At the first level of the search, there are only unmatched edges, since the free vertices in <math>U</math> are by definition not adjacent to any matched edges. At subsequent levels of the search, the traversed edges are required to alternate between matched and unmatched. That is, when searching for successors from a vertex in <math>U</math>, only unmatched edges may be traversed, while from a vertex in <math>V</math> only matched edges may be traversed.  The search terminates at the first layer <math>k</math> where one or more free vertices in <math>V</math> are reached.\n* All free vertices in <math>V</math> at layer <math>k</math> are collected into a set <math>F</math>. That is, a vertex <math>v</math> is put into <math>F</math> if and only if it ends a shortest augmenting path.\n* The algorithm finds a maximal set of ''vertex disjoint'' augmenting paths of length <math>k</math>. (''Maximal'' means that no more such paths can be added. This is different from finding the ''maximum'' number of such paths, which would be harder to do. Fortunately, it is sufficient here to find a maximal set of paths.) This set may be computed by [[depth first search]] (DFS) from <math>F</math> to the free vertices in <math>U</math>, using the breadth first layering to guide the search: the DFS is only allowed to follow edges that lead to an unused vertex in the previous layer, and paths in the DFS tree must alternate between matched and unmatched edges. Once an augmenting path is found that involves one of the vertices in <math>F</math>, the DFS is continued from the next starting vertex. Any vertex encountered during the DFS can immediately be marked as used, since if there is no path from it to <math>U</math> at the current point in the DFS, then that vertex can't be used to reach <math>U</math> at any other point in the DFS. This ensures <math>O(|E|)</math> running time for the DFS. It is also possible to work in the other direction, from free vertices in <math>U</math> to those in <math>V</math>, which is the variant used in the pseudocode.\n* Every one of the paths found in this way is used to enlarge <math>M</math>.\n\nThe algorithm terminates when no more augmenting paths are found in the breadth first search part of one of the phases.\n\n==Analysis==\nEach phase consists of a single breadth first search and a single depth first search. Thus, a single phase may be implemented in <math>O(|E|)</math> time.\nTherefore, the first <math>\\sqrt{|V|}</math> phases, in a graph with <math>|V|</math> vertices and <math>|E|</math> edges, take time <math>O(|E|\\sqrt{|V|})</math>.\n\nEach phase increases the length of the shortest augmenting path by at least one: the phase finds a maximal set of augmenting paths of the given length, so any remaining augmenting path must be longer. Therefore, once the initial <math>\\sqrt{|V|}</math> phases of the algorithm are complete, the shortest remaining augmenting path has at least <math>\\sqrt{|V|}</math> edges in it. However, the [[symmetric difference]] of the eventual optimal matching and of the partial matching ''M'' found by the initial phases forms a collection of vertex-disjoint augmenting paths and alternating cycles. If each of the paths in this collection has length at least <math>\\sqrt{|V|}</math>, there can be at most <math>\\sqrt{|V|}</math> paths in the collection, and the size of the optimal matching can differ from the size of <math>M</math> by at most <math>\\sqrt{|V|}</math> edges. Since each phase of the algorithm increases the size of the matching by at least one, there can be at most <math>\\sqrt{|V|}</math> additional phases before the algorithm terminates.\n\nSince the algorithm performs a total of at most <math>2\\sqrt{|V|}</math> phases, it takes a total time of <math>O(|E|\\sqrt{|V|})</math> in the worst case.\n\nIn many instances, however, the time taken by the algorithm may be even faster than this worst case analysis indicates. For instance, in the [[average case analysis|average case]] for [[sparse graph|sparse]] bipartite [[random graph]]s, {{harvtxt|Bast|Mehlhorn|Schafer|Tamaki|2006}} (improving a previous result of {{harvnb|Motwani|1994}}) showed that with high probability all non-optimal matchings have augmenting paths of [[logarithm]]ic length. As a consequence, for these graphs, the Hopcroft\u2013Karp algorithm takes <math>O(\\log |V|)</math> phases and <math>O(|E| \\log |V|)</math> total time.\n\n==Comparison with other bipartite matching algorithms==\nFor [[sparse graph]]s, the Hopcroft\u2013Karp algorithm continues to have the best known worst-case performance, but for dense graphs (<math>|E|=\\Omega(|V|^2)</math>) a more recent algorithm by {{harvtxt|Alt|Blum|Mehlhorn|Paul|1991}} achieves a slightly better time bound, <math>O\\left(|V|^{1.5}\\sqrt{\\frac{|E|}{\\log |V|}}\\right)</math>. Their algorithm is based on using a [[push-relabel maximum flow algorithm]] and then, when the matching created by this algorithm becomes close to optimum, switching to the Hopcroft\u2013Karp method.\n\nSeveral authors have performed experimental comparisons of bipartite matching algorithms. Their results in general tend to show that the Hopcroft\u2013Karp method is not as good in practice as it is in theory: it is outperformed both by simpler breadth-first and depth-first strategies for finding augmenting paths, and by push-relabel techniques.<ref>{{harvtxt|Chang|McCormick|1990}}; {{harvtxt|Darby-Dowman|1980}}; {{harvtxt|Setubal|1993}}; {{harvtxt|Setubal|1996}}.</ref>\n\n==Non-bipartite graphs==\nThe same idea of finding a maximal set of shortest augmenting paths works also for finding maximum cardinality matchings in non-bipartite graphs, and for the same reasons the algorithms based on this idea take <math>O(\\sqrt{|V|})</math> phases. However, for non-bipartite graphs, the task of finding the augmenting paths within each phase is more difficult. Building on the work of several slower predecessors, {{harvtxt|Micali|Vazirani|1980}} showed how to implement a phase in linear time, resulting in a non-bipartite matching algorithm with the same time bound as the Hopcroft\u2013Karp algorithm for bipartite graphs. The Micali\u2013Vazirani technique is complex, and its authors did not provide full proofs of their results; subsequently,\na \"clear exposition\" was published by {{harvtxt|Peterson|Loui|1988}} and alternative methods were  described by other authors.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gabow|Tarjan|1991}}.</ref> In 2012, Vazirani offered a new simplified proof of the Micali-Vazirani algorithm.<ref>{{harvtxt|Vazirani|2012}}</ref>\n\n==Pseudocode==\n /* \n  G = U \u222a V \u222a {NIL}\n  where U and V are partition of graph and NIL is a special null vertex\n */\n   \n '''function''' BFS() '''is'''\n     '''for each''' u '''in''' U '''do'''\n         '''if''' Pair_U[u] = NIL '''then'''\n             Dist[u] := 0\n             Enqueue(Q, u)\n         '''else'''\n             Dist[u] := \u221e\n     Dist[NIL] := \u221e\n     '''while''' Empty(Q) = false '''do'''\n         u := Dequeue(Q)\n         '''if''' Dist[u] < Dist[NIL] '''then'''\n             '''for each''' v '''in''' Adj[u] '''do'''\n                 '''if''' Dist[Pair_V[v]] = \u221e '''then'''\n                     Dist[Pair_V[v]] := Dist[u] + 1\n                     Enqueue(Q, Pair_V[v])\n     '''return''' Dist[NIL] \u2260 \u221e\n \n '''function''' DFS(u) '''is'''\n     '''if''' u \u2260 NIL '''then'''\n         '''for each''' v '''in''' Adj[u] '''do'''\n             '''if''' Dist[Pair_V[v]] = Dist[u] + 1 '''then'''\n                 '''if''' DFS(Pair_V[v]) = true '''then'''\n                     Pair_V[v] := u\n                     Pair_U[u] := v\n                     '''return''' true\n         Dist[u] := \u221e\n         '''return''' false\n     '''return''' true\n \n '''function''' Hopcroft\u2013Karp '''is'''\n     '''for each''' u '''in''' U '''do'''\n         Pair_U[u] := NIL\n     '''for each''' v '''in''' V '''do'''\n         Pair_V[v] := NIL\n     matching := 0\n     '''while''' BFS() = true '''do'''\n         '''for each''' u '''in''' U '''do'''\n             '''if''' Pair_U[u] = NIL '''then'''\n                 '''if''' DFS(u) = true '''then'''\n                     matching := matching + 1\n     '''return''' matching\n\n[[File:HopcroftKarpExample.png|thumb|Execution on an example graph showing input graph and matching after intermediate iteration 1 and final iteration 2.]]\n\n=== Explanation ===\nLet our graph have two partitions U, V. The key idea is to add two dummy vertices on each side of the graph: uDummy connecting it to all unmatched vertices in U and vDummy connecting to all unmatched vertices in V. Now if we run BFS from uDummy to vDummy then we can get shortest path between an unmatched vertex in U to unmatched vertex in V. Due to bipartite nature of the graph, this path would zig zag from U to V. However we need to make sure that when going from V to U, we always select matched edge. If there is no matched edge then we end at vDummy. If we make sure of this criteria during BFS then the generated path would meet the criteria for being an augmented shortest path.\n\nOnce we have found the augmented shortest path, we want to make sure we ignore any other paths that are longer than this shortest paths. BFS algorithm marks nodes in path with distance with source being 0. Thus, after doing BFS, we can start at each unmatched vertex in U, follow the path by following nodes with distance that increments by 1. When we finally arrive at the destination vDummy, if its distance is 1 more than last node in V then we know that the path we followed is (one of the possibly many) shortest path. In that case we can go ahead and update the pairing for vertices on path in U and V. Note that each vertex in V on path, except for the last one, is non-free vertex. So updating pairing for these vertices in V to different vertices in U is equivalent to removing previously matched edge and adding new unmatched edge in matching. This is same as doing the symmetric difference (i.e. remove edges common to previous matching and add non-common edges in augmented path in new matching).\n\nHow do we make sure augmented paths are vertex disjoint? It is already guaranteed: After doing the symmetric difference for a path, none of its vertices could be considered again just because the Dist[ Pair_V[v] ] will not be equal to Dist[u] + 1 (It would be exactly Dist[u]).\n\nSo what is the mission of these two lines in pseudocode?:\n Dist[u] = \u221e\n return false\nWhen we were not able to find any shortest augmented path from a vertex, DFS returns false. In this case it would be good to mark these vertices to not to visit them again. This marking is simply done by setting Dist[u] to infinity.\n\nFinally, we actually don't need uDummy because it's there just to put all unmatched vertices of U in queue when BFS starts. That we can do as just as initialization. The vDummy can be appended in U for convenience in many implementations and initialize default pairing for all V to point to vDummy. That way, if final vertex in V doesn't have any matching vertex in U then we finally end at vDummy which is the end of our augmented path. In above pseudocode vDummy is denoted as Nil.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bipartite matching]]\n* [[Hungarian algorithm]]\n* [[Assignment problem]]\n* [[Edmonds\u2013Karp algorithm]] for finding maximum flow\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|first1=Ravindra K.|last1=Ahuja|author1-link=Ravindra K.

However, instead of finding just a single augmenting path per iteration, the algorithm finds a maximal set of shortest augmenting paths. As a result, only <math>O(\\sqrt{|V|})</math> iterations are needed. The same principle has also been used to develop more complicated algorithms for non-bipartite matching with the same asymptotic running time as the Hopcroft\u2013Karp algorithm.\n\n==Augmenting paths==\nA vertex that is not the endpoint of an edge in some partial matching <math>M</math> is called a ''free vertex''. The basic concept that the algorithm relies on is that of an ''augmenting path'', a path that starts at a free vertex, ends at a free vertex, and alternates between unmatched and matched edges within the path. It follows from this definition that, except for the endpoints, all other vertices (if any) in augmenting path must be non-free vertices. An augmenting path could consist of only two vertices (both free) and single unmatched edge between them.\n\nIf <math>M</math> is a matching, and <math>P</math> is an augmenting path relative to <math>M</math>, then the [[symmetric difference]] of the two sets of edges, <math>M \\oplus P</math>, would form a matching with size <math>|M| + 1</math>. Thus, by finding augmenting paths, an algorithm may increase the size of the matching.\n\nConversely, suppose that a matching <math>M</math> is not optimal, and let <math>P</math> be the symmetric difference <math>M \\oplus M^*</math> where <math>M^*</math> is an optimal matching. Because <math>M</math> and <math>M^*</math> are both matchings, every vertex has degree at most 2 in <math>P</math>. So <math>P</math> must form a collection of disjoint cycles, of paths with an equal number of matched and unmatched edges in <math>M</math>, of augmenting paths for <math>M</math>, and of augmenting paths for <math>M^*</math>; but the latter is impossible because <math>M^*</math> is optimal. Now, the cycles and the paths with equal numbers of matched and unmatched vertices do not contribute to the  difference in size between <math>M</math> and <math>M^*</math>, so this difference is equal to the number of augmenting paths for <math>M</math> in <math>P</math>. Thus, whenever there exists a matching <math>M^*</math> larger than the current matching <math>M</math>, there must also exist an augmenting path. If no augmenting path can be found, an algorithm may safely terminate, since in this case <math>M</math> must be optimal.\n\nAn augmenting path in a matching problem is closely related to the [[augmenting path]]s arising in [[maximum flow problem]]s, paths along which one may increase the amount of flow between the terminals of the flow. It is possible to transform the bipartite matching problem into a maximum flow instance, such that the alternating paths of the matching problem become augmenting paths of the flow problem.<ref>{{harvtxt|Ahuja|Magnanti|Orlin|1993}}, section 12.3, bipartite cardinality matching problem, pp. 469\u2013470.</ref> In fact, a generalization of the technique used in Hopcroft\u2013Karp algorithm to arbitrary flow networks is known as [[Dinic's algorithm]].\n\n==Algorithm==\nThe algorithm may be expressed in the following [[pseudocode]].\n\n: '''Input''': Bipartite graph <math>G(U \\cup V, E)</math>\n: '''Output''': Matching <math>M \\subseteq E</math>\n: <math>M \\leftarrow \\empty</math>\n: '''repeat'''\n:: <math>\\mathcal P \\leftarrow \\{P_1, P_2, \\dots, P_k\\}</math> ''maximal set of vertex-disjoint shortest augmenting paths''\n:: <math>M \\leftarrow M \\oplus (P_1 \\cup P_2 \\cup \\dots \\cup P_k)</math>\n: '''until''' <math>\\mathcal P = \\empty</math>\n\nIn more detail, let <math>U</math> and <math>V</math> be the two sets in the bipartition of <math>G</math>, and let the matching from <math>U</math> to <math>V</math> at any time be represented as the set <math>M</math>.\nThe algorithm is run in phases. Each phase consists of the following steps.\n* A [[breadth-first search]] partitions the vertices of the graph into layers. The free vertices in <math>U</math> are used as the starting vertices of this search and form the first layer of the partitioning. At the first level of the search, there are only unmatched edges, since the free vertices in <math>U</math> are by definition not adjacent to any matched edges. At subsequent levels of the search, the traversed edges are required to alternate between matched and unmatched. That is, when searching for successors from a vertex in <math>U</math>, only unmatched edges may be traversed, while from a vertex in <math>V</math> only matched edges may be traversed.  The search terminates at the first layer <math>k</math> where one or more free vertices in <math>V</math> are reached.\n* All free vertices in <math>V</math> at layer <math>k</math> are collected into a set <math>F</math>. That is, a vertex <math>v</math> is put into <math>F</math> if and only if it ends a shortest augmenting path.\n* The algorithm finds a maximal set of ''vertex disjoint'' augmenting paths of length <math>k</math>. (''Maximal'' means that no more such paths can be added. This is different from finding the ''maximum'' number of such paths, which would be harder to do. Fortunately, it is sufficient here to find a maximal set of paths.) This set may be computed by [[depth first search]] (DFS) from <math>F</math> to the free vertices in <math>U</math>, using the breadth first layering to guide the search: the DFS is only allowed to follow edges that lead to an unused vertex in the previous layer, and paths in the DFS tree must alternate between matched and unmatched edges. Once an augmenting path is found that involves one of the vertices in <math>F</math>, the DFS is continued from the next starting vertex. Any vertex encountered during the DFS can immediately be marked as used, since if there is no path from it to <math>U</math> at the current point in the DFS, then that vertex can't be used to reach <math>U</math> at any other point in the DFS. This ensures <math>O(|E|)</math> running time for the DFS. It is also possible to work in the other direction, from free vertices in <math>U</math> to those in <math>V</math>, which is the variant used in the pseudocode.\n* Every one of the paths found in this way is used to enlarge <math>M</math>.\n\nThe algorithm terminates when no more augmenting paths are found in the breadth first search part of one of the phases.\n\n==Analysis==\nEach phase consists of a single breadth first search and a single depth first search. Thus, a single phase may be implemented in <math>O(|E|)</math> time.\nTherefore, the first <math>\\sqrt{|V|}</math> phases, in a graph with <math>|V|</math> vertices and <math>|E|</math> edges, take time <math>O(|E|\\sqrt{|V|})</math>.\n\nEach phase increases the length of the shortest augmenting path by at least one: the phase finds a maximal set of augmenting paths of the given length, so any remaining augmenting path must be longer. Therefore, once the initial <math>\\sqrt{|V|}</math> phases of the algorithm are complete, the shortest remaining augmenting path has at least <math>\\sqrt{|V|}</math> edges in it. However, the [[symmetric difference]] of the eventual optimal matching and of the partial matching ''M'' found by the initial phases forms a collection of vertex-disjoint augmenting paths and alternating cycles. If each of the paths in this collection has length at least <math>\\sqrt{|V|}</math>, there can be at most <math>\\sqrt{|V|}</math> paths in the collection, and the size of the optimal matching can differ from the size of <math>M</math> by at most <math>\\sqrt{|V|}</math> edges. Since each phase of the algorithm increases the size of the matching by at least one, there can be at most <math>\\sqrt{|V|}</math> additional phases before the algorithm terminates.\n\nSince the algorithm performs a total of at most <math>2\\sqrt{|V|}</math> phases, it takes a total time of <math>O(|E|\\sqrt{|V|})</math> in the worst case.\n\nIn many instances, however, the time taken by the algorithm may be even faster than this worst case analysis indicates. For instance, in the [[average case analysis|average case]] for [[sparse graph|sparse]] bipartite [[random graph]]s, {{harvtxt|Bast|Mehlhorn|Schafer|Tamaki|2006}} (improving a previous result of {{harvnb|Motwani|1994}}) showed that with high probability all non-optimal matchings have augmenting paths of [[logarithm]]ic length. As a consequence, for these graphs, the Hopcroft\u2013Karp algorithm takes <math>O(\\log |V|)</math> phases and <math>O(|E| \\log |V|)</math> total time.\n\n==Comparison with other bipartite matching algorithms==\nFor [[sparse graph]]s, the Hopcroft\u2013Karp algorithm continues to have the best known worst-case performance, but for dense graphs (<math>|E|=\\Omega(|V|^2)</math>) a more recent algorithm by {{harvtxt|Alt|Blum|Mehlhorn|Paul|1991}} achieves a slightly better time bound, <math>O\\left(|V|^{1.5}\\sqrt{\\frac{|E|}{\\log |V|}}\\right)</math>. Their algorithm is based on using a [[push-relabel maximum flow algorithm]] and then, when the matching created by this algorithm becomes close to optimum, switching to the Hopcroft\u2013Karp method.\n\nSeveral authors have performed experimental comparisons of bipartite matching algorithms. Their results in general tend to show that the Hopcroft\u2013Karp method is not as good in practice as it is in theory: it is outperformed both by simpler breadth-first and depth-first strategies for finding augmenting paths, and by push-relabel techniques.<ref>{{harvtxt|Chang|McCormick|1990}}; {{harvtxt|Darby-Dowman|1980}}; {{harvtxt|Setubal|1993}}; {{harvtxt|Setubal|1996}}.</ref>\n\n==Non-bipartite graphs==\nThe same idea of finding a maximal set of shortest augmenting paths works also for finding maximum cardinality matchings in non-bipartite graphs, and for the same reasons the algorithms based on this idea take <math>O(\\sqrt{|V|})</math> phases. However, for non-bipartite graphs, the task of finding the augmenting paths within each phase is more difficult. Building on the work of several slower predecessors, {{harvtxt|Micali|Vazirani|1980}} showed how to implement a phase in linear time, resulting in a non-bipartite matching algorithm with the same time bound as the Hopcroft\u2013Karp algorithm for bipartite graphs. The Micali\u2013Vazirani technique is complex, and its authors did not provide full proofs of their results; subsequently,\na \"clear exposition\" was published by {{harvtxt|Peterson|Loui|1988}} and alternative methods were  described by other authors.<ref>{{harvtxt|Gabow|Tarjan|1991}}.</ref> In 2012, Vazirani offered a new simplified proof of the Micali-Vazirani algorithm.<ref>{{harvtxt|Vazirani|2012}}</ref>\n\n==Pseudocode==\n /* \n  G = U \u222a V \u222a {NIL}\n  where U and V are partition of graph and NIL is a special null vertex\n */\n   \n '''function''' BFS() '''is'''\n     '''for each''' u '''in''' U '''do'''\n         '''if''' Pair_U[u] = NIL '''then'''\n             Dist[u] := 0\n             Enqueue(Q, u)\n         '''else'''\n             Dist[u] := \u221e\n     Dist[NIL] := \u221e\n     '''while''' Empty(Q) = false '''do'''\n         u := Dequeue(Q)\n         '''if''' Dist[u] < Dist[NIL] '''then'''\n             '''for each''' v '''in''' Adj[u] '''do'''\n                 '''if''' Dist[Pair_V[v]] = \u221e '''then'''\n                     Dist[Pair_V[v]] := Dist[u] + 1\n                     Enqueue(Q, Pair_V[v])\n     '''return''' Dist[NIL] \u2260 \u221e\n \n '''function''' DFS(u) '''is'''\n     '''if''' u \u2260 NIL '''then'''\n         '''for each''' v '''in''' Adj[u] '''do'''\n             '''if''' Dist[Pair_V[v]] = Dist[u] + 1 '''then'''\n                 '''if''' DFS(Pair_V[v]) = true '''then'''\n                     Pair_V[v] := u\n                     Pair_U[u] := v\n                     '''return''' true\n         Dist[u] := \u221e\n         '''return''' false\n     '''return''' true\n \n '''function''' Hopcroft\u2013Karp '''is'''\n     '''for each''' u '''in''' U '''do'''\n         Pair_U[u] := NIL\n     '''for each''' v '''in''' V '''do'''\n         Pair_V[v] := NIL\n     matching := 0\n     '''while''' BFS() = true '''do'''\n         '''for each''' u '''in''' U '''do'''\n             '''if''' Pair_U[u] = NIL '''then'''\n                 '''if''' DFS(u) = true '''then'''\n                     matching := matching + 1\n     '''return''' matching\n\n[[File:HopcroftKarpExample.png|thumb|Execution on an example graph showing input graph and matching after intermediate iteration 1 and final iteration 2.]]\n\n=== Explanation ===\nLet our graph have two partitions U, V. The key idea is to add two dummy vertices on each side of the graph: uDummy connecting it to all unmatched vertices in U and vDummy connecting to all unmatched vertices in V. Now if we run BFS from uDummy to vDummy then we can get shortest path between an unmatched vertex in U to unmatched vertex in V. Due to bipartite nature of the graph, this path would zig zag from U to V. However we need to make sure that when going from V to U, we always select matched edge. If there is no matched edge then we end at vDummy. If we make sure of this criteria during BFS then the generated path would meet the criteria for being an augmented shortest path.\n\nOnce we have found the augmented shortest path, we want to make sure we ignore any other paths that are longer than this shortest paths. BFS algorithm marks nodes in path with distance with source being 0. Thus, after doing BFS, we can start at each unmatched vertex in U, follow the path by following nodes with distance that increments by 1. When we finally arrive at the destination vDummy, if its distance is 1 more than last node in V then we know that the path we followed is (one of the possibly many) shortest path. In that case we can go ahead and update the pairing for vertices on path in U and V. Note that each vertex in V on path, except for the last one, is non-free vertex. So updating pairing for these vertices in V to different vertices in U is equivalent to removing previously matched edge and adding new unmatched edge in matching. This is same as doing the symmetric difference (i.e. remove edges common to previous matching and add non-common edges in augmented path in new matching).\n\nHow do we make sure augmented paths are vertex disjoint? It is already guaranteed: After doing the symmetric difference for a path, none of its vertices could be considered again just because the Dist[ Pair_V[v] ] will not be equal to Dist[u] + 1 (It would be exactly Dist[u]).\n\nSo what is the mission of these two lines in pseudocode?:\n Dist[u] = \u221e\n return false\nWhen we were not able to find any shortest augmented path from a vertex, DFS returns false. In this case it would be good to mark these vertices to not to visit them again. This marking is simply done by setting Dist[u] to infinity.\n\nFinally, we actually don't need uDummy because it's there just to put all unmatched vertices of U in queue when BFS starts. That we can do as just as initialization. The vDummy can be appended in U for convenience in many implementations and initialize default pairing for all V to point to vDummy. That way, if final vertex in V doesn't have any matching vertex in U then we finally end at vDummy which is the end of our augmented path. In above pseudocode vDummy is denoted as Nil.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Bipartite matching]]\n* [[Hungarian algorithm]]\n* [[Assignment problem]]\n* [[Edmonds\u2013Karp algorithm]] for finding maximum flow\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation|first1=Ravindra K.|last1=Ahuja|author1-link=Ravindra K.
