Mushroom management often develops when managers see themselves as the sole decision-makers within the company, rather than the people who lead all the employees towards a shared success. This can often take place unintentionally: managers fear that their employees will discover important new ideas instead of them, which drives the managers to make bad decisions and prevent employees from taking an active role in their work. As a result, the employees end up doing this work in a mechanical, repeated fashion, without contributing in a more productive or active way.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mushroom Management|url=http://changingminds.org/disciplines/leadership/articles/mushroom_management.htm|website=Changing Minds|publisher=Changing Minds|accessdate=22 October 2014}}</ref> \n\n==Benefits==\nThe key feature of mushroom management is that the employees have limited responsibility over the company.

Thus in Coal Phase-out we have global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from coal increasing 2% per year until 2012, 1% per year growth of coal emissions between 2013 and 2022, flat coal emissions for 2023\u20132025, and finally a linear decrease to zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from coal in 2050.  These rates refer to emissions to the atmosphere and do not constrain consumption of coal, provided the CO<sub>2</sub> is captured and sequestered. Oil and gas emissions are assumed to be the same as in the BAU [business as usual] scenario.}}\n\nKharecha and Hansen also consider three other mitigation scenarios, all with the same coal phase-out schedule but each making different assumptions about the size of oil and gas reserves and the speed at which they are depleted. Under the Business as Usual scenario, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> peaks at 563 parts per million (ppm) in the year 2100. Under the four coal phase-out scenarios, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> peaks at 422-446 ppm between 2045 and 2060 and declines thereafter. The key implications of the study are as follows: a phase-out of coal emissions is the most important remedy for mitigating human-induced global warming; actions should be taken toward limiting or stretching out the use of conventional oil and gas; and strict emissions-based constraints are needed for future use of unconventional fossil fuels such as [[methane hydrates]] and [[tar sands]].\n\n=== Others ===\nThe impulse of renewable energy can create jobs through the construction of new power plants and the manufacturing of the equipment that they need, as could be seen in the case of Germany and the wind power industry.<ref name=\"Heinrichs 285\u2013305\">{{Cite journal|last=Heinrichs|first=Heidi Ursula|last2=Schumann|first2=Diana|last3=V\u00f6gele|first3=Stefan|last4=Bi\u00df|first4=Klaus Hendrik|last5=Shamon|first5=Hawal|last6=Markewitz|first6=Peter|last7=T\u00f6bben|first7=Johannes|last8=Gillessen|first8=Bastian|last9=Gotzens|first9=Fabian|date=2017-05-01|title=Integrated assessment of a phase-out of coal-fired power plants in Germany|journal=Energy|volume=126|pages=285\u2013305|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2017.03.017}}</ref>\n\n== Studies about fossil fuel phase-out ==\nIn the [[Greenpeace]] and EREC's Energy (R)evolution scenario,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190220024950/http://www.erec.org/documents/publications/energy-revolution.html?0=]</ref> the world would eliminate all fossil fuel use by 2090.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution |title=Energy Revolution |publisher=Greenpeace International |accessdate=2013-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623042344/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution/ |archive-date=23 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erec.org/fileadmin/erec_docs/Documents/Press_Releases/Press_release_Greenpeace_EREC__October_2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029182526/http://www.erec.org/fileadmin/erec_docs/Documents/Press_Releases/Press_release_Greenpeace_EREC__October_2008.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/dn15043-world-can-halt-fossil-fuel-use-by-2090.html |title=Science news and science jobs from New Scientist - New Scientist |publisher=Environment.newscientist.com |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2015, [[Greenpeace]] and [[Climate Action Network|Climate Action Network Europe]] released a report highlighting the need for an active phase-out of coal-fired generation across Europe.

Hansen}}</ref> Their baseline mitigation scenario was a phaseout of global coal emissions by 2050. The authors describe the scenario as follows:\n\n{{quote|The second scenario, labeled Coal Phase-out, is meant to approximate a situation in which developed countries freeze their CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from coal by 2012 and a decade later developing countries similarly halt increases in coal emissions.  Between 2025 and 2050 it is assumed that both developed and developing countries will linearly phase out emissions of CO<sub>2</sub> from coal usage.  Thus in Coal Phase-out we have global CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from coal increasing 2% per year until 2012, 1% per year growth of coal emissions between 2013 and 2022, flat coal emissions for 2023\u20132025, and finally a linear decrease to zero CO<sub>2</sub> emissions from coal in 2050.  These rates refer to emissions to the atmosphere and do not constrain consumption of coal, provided the CO<sub>2</sub> is captured and sequestered. Oil and gas emissions are assumed to be the same as in the BAU [business as usual] scenario.}}\n\nKharecha and Hansen also consider three other mitigation scenarios, all with the same coal phase-out schedule but each making different assumptions about the size of oil and gas reserves and the speed at which they are depleted. Under the Business as Usual scenario, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> peaks at 563 parts per million (ppm) in the year 2100. Under the four coal phase-out scenarios, atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> peaks at 422-446 ppm between 2045 and 2060 and declines thereafter. The key implications of the study are as follows: a phase-out of coal emissions is the most important remedy for mitigating human-induced global warming; actions should be taken toward limiting or stretching out the use of conventional oil and gas; and strict emissions-based constraints are needed for future use of unconventional fossil fuels such as [[methane hydrates]] and [[tar sands]].\n\n=== Others ===\nThe impulse of renewable energy can create jobs through the construction of new power plants and the manufacturing of the equipment that they need, as could be seen in the case of Germany and the wind power industry.<ref name=\"Heinrichs 285\u2013305\">{{Cite journal|last=Heinrichs|first=Heidi Ursula|last2=Schumann|first2=Diana|last3=V\u00f6gele|first3=Stefan|last4=Bi\u00df|first4=Klaus Hendrik|last5=Shamon|first5=Hawal|last6=Markewitz|first6=Peter|last7=T\u00f6bben|first7=Johannes|last8=Gillessen|first8=Bastian|last9=Gotzens|first9=Fabian|date=2017-05-01|title=Integrated assessment of a phase-out of coal-fired power plants in Germany|journal=Energy|volume=126|pages=285\u2013305|doi=10.1016/j.energy.2017.03.017}}</ref>\n\n== Studies about fossil fuel phase-out ==\nIn the [[Greenpeace]] and EREC's Energy (R)evolution scenario,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190220024950/http://www.erec.org/documents/publications/energy-revolution.html?0=]</ref> the world would eliminate all fossil fuel use by 2090.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution |title=Energy Revolution |publisher=Greenpeace International |accessdate=2013-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623042344/http://www.greenpeace.org/international/campaigns/climate-change/energyrevolution/ |archive-date=23 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erec.org/fileadmin/erec_docs/Documents/Press_Releases/Press_release_Greenpeace_EREC__October_2008.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029182526/http://www.erec.org/fileadmin/erec_docs/Documents/Press_Releases/Press_release_Greenpeace_EREC__October_2008.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/dn15043-world-can-halt-fossil-fuel-use-by-2090.html |title=Science news and science jobs from New Scientist - New Scientist |publisher=Environment.newscientist.com |accessdate=2013-12-27}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2015, [[Greenpeace]] and [[Climate Action Network|Climate Action Network Europe]] released a report highlighting the need for an active phase-out of coal-fired generation across Europe.

The device was unveiled on September 10, 2013, at Apple's [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino headquarters]]. It was released on September 20, 2013, alongside its lower-cost counterpart, the [[iPhone 5C]].<ref name=\"verge 5s unveil\" />\n\nThe iPhone 5S maintains almost the same external design as its predecessor, the [[iPhone 5]], although the 5S received a new white/gold color scheme in addition to white/silver and space gray/black. The 5S has vastly upgraded internal hardware, however. It introduced the [[Apple A7|A7]] 64-bit dual-core system-on-chip, the first [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] processor to be used on a smartphone, accompanied by the [[Apple M7|M7]] \"motion co-processor\". A redesigned home button with [[Touch ID]], a [[fingerprint recognition]] system which can be used to unlock the phone and authenticate [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and [[iTunes Store]] purchases, was also introduced. The camera was also updated with a larger [[aperture]] and a dual-LED flash optimized for different [[color temperature]]s. Earphones known as EarPods were included with the 5S, and Apple released accessories including a case and a dock.\n\nThe iPhone 5S originally shipped with [[iOS 7]], which introduced a revamped visual appearance among other new features. Designed by [[Jony Ive]], iOS 7 departed from [[skeuomorph]]ic elements used in previous versions of iOS in favor of a flat, colorful design. Among new software features introduced to the iPhone 5S were [[AirDrop]], an ad-hoc Wi-Fi sharing platform; Control Center, a control panel containing a number of commonly used functions; and [[iTunes Radio]], an [[internet radio]] service. The 5S is the only iPhone to be supported through six major versions of iOS, from [[iOS 7]] to [[iOS 12]], and the second iOS device to support six major updates - the first being the [[iPad 2]] which supported iOS versions 4 to 9.\n\nReception towards the device was generally positive, with some outlets considering it to be the best smartphone available on the market due to its upgraded hardware, Touch ID, and other changes introduced by iOS 7.<ref name=\"atd review\"/> Some criticized the iPhone 5S for keeping the design and small display of the iPhone 5,<ref name=\"scottstein\"/> and others expressed security concerns about the Touch ID system.<ref name=\"touch id hackers\"/> Nine million units of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were sold on the weekend of their release, breaking Apple's sales record for iPhones.<ref name=\"NYT iP5S sales 1\"/> The iPhone 5S was the best selling phone on all major U.S. carriers in September 2013.<ref name=\"iP5S best selling\"/>\n\nThe iPhone 5S was succeeded as Apple's flagship smartphone by the larger [[iPhone 6]] in September 2014. On March 21, 2016, the 5S received a direct replacement with the announcement of the [[iPhone SE]], which incorporated internal hardware similar to the [[iPhone 6S]] while retaining the smaller form factor and design of the 5S.<ref name=\"macworld-iphonese\">{{cite web|title=iPhone SE first look: Where 2012 meets 2016|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/3046615/iphone-ipad/iphone-se-first-look-its-2012-all-over-again.html|website=MacWorld|publisher=IDG|accessdate=23 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| footer = The iPhone&nbsp;5S was announced during a keynote at [[4 Infinite Loop]] on September 10, 2013.\n| image1    = 4 Infinite Loop.jpg\n| alt1      =  The front of 4 Infinite Loop at the Apple Campus.\n| width1 = 232\n}}\n\nBefore its official unveiling, media speculation primarily centered on reports that the next iPhone would include a [[fingerprint scanner]]; including Apple's July 2012 acquisition of [[AuthenTec]], a developer of [[mobile security]] products,<ref name=\"verge authentec 1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/27/3193078/apple-purchases-authentec-356-million|title=Apple buys patent-rich security firm Authentec for $356 million|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|work=[[The Verge (website)|The Verge]]|date=July 27, 2012|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}</ref> references to a fingerprint sensor on the home button in the beta release of [[iOS 7]]<ref name=\"verge ios7 finger\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/29/4568802/iphone-biometric-sensor-ios-7-beta-code|title=Apple references iPhone fingerprint sensor in latest iOS 7 beta|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|work=[[The Verge (website)|The Verge]]|date=July 29, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}</ref> and leaked packaging for an iPhone 5S showing that the traditional home button now had a metallic \"ring\" around it.

Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015, even as that form factor was succeeded as the flagship iPhone by the redesigned larger display 4.7/5.5-inch [[iPhone 6]] and 6 Plus back in September 2014. Furthermore, the 5/5S design was regarded as \"long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general\" (with the 5S's gold finish adding a premium touch to the 5's already well-regarded look), while the succeeding 6 and 6S design was less critically acclaimed as it \"felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap\". The iPhone 5 was described as \"elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, iPhone 5 didn\u2019t really look like anything else on the market at the time\". However, the iPhone 5/5S design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus [[phablet]] models. When Apple discontinued the iPhone 5S, it was replaced by the iPhone SE which outwardly appears almost identical to the 5S even as the SE's internal hardware has been upgraded significantly.<ref name=\"forbes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2016/03/26/iphone-se-review-very-average-smartphone/#c8fbbb168fda|title=iPhone SE Reviews: Apple's Strange Case Of Jekyll And Hyde|date=26 March 2016|work=Forbes|accessdate=1 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"wired.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/03/iphone-se-smaller-phone/|title=With the iPhone SE, Apple Returns to a Masterpiece of Design|date=22 March 2016|work=WIRED|accessdate=1 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial reception===\nThe iPhone 5S and 5C sold over nine million units in the first three days, setting a record for first weekend smartphone sales,<ref name=\"NYT iP5S sales 1\">{{cite web|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/apple-sells-nine-million-new-iphones|title=Apple Sells Nine Million New iPhones|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Brian X.|last=Chen|date=September 23, 2013|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}</ref> with the 5S selling three times more units than the 5C.

The device was unveiled on September 10, 2013, at Apple's [[Cupertino, California|Cupertino headquarters]]. It was released on September 20, 2013, alongside its lower-cost counterpart, the [[iPhone 5C]].<ref name=\"verge 5s unveil\" />\n\nThe iPhone 5S maintains almost the same external design as its predecessor, the [[iPhone 5]], although the 5S received a new white/gold color scheme in addition to white/silver and space gray/black. The 5S has vastly upgraded internal hardware, however. It introduced the [[Apple A7|A7]] 64-bit dual-core system-on-chip, the first [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] processor to be used on a smartphone, accompanied by the [[Apple M7|M7]] \"motion co-processor\". A redesigned home button with [[Touch ID]], a [[fingerprint recognition]] system which can be used to unlock the phone and authenticate [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] and [[iTunes Store]] purchases, was also introduced. The camera was also updated with a larger [[aperture]] and a dual-LED flash optimized for different [[color temperature]]s. Earphones known as EarPods were included with the 5S, and Apple released accessories including a case and a dock.\n\nThe iPhone 5S originally shipped with [[iOS 7]], which introduced a revamped visual appearance among other new features. Designed by [[Jony Ive]], iOS 7 departed from [[skeuomorph]]ic elements used in previous versions of iOS in favor of a flat, colorful design. Among new software features introduced to the iPhone 5S were [[AirDrop]], an ad-hoc Wi-Fi sharing platform; Control Center, a control panel containing a number of commonly used functions; and [[iTunes Radio]], an [[internet radio]] service. The 5S is the only iPhone to be supported through six major versions of iOS, from [[iOS 7]] to [[iOS 12]], and the second iOS device to support six major updates - the first being the [[iPad 2]] which supported iOS versions 4 to 9.\n\nReception towards the device was generally positive, with some outlets considering it to be the best smartphone available on the market due to its upgraded hardware, Touch ID, and other changes introduced by iOS 7.<ref name=\"atd review\"/> Some criticized the iPhone 5S for keeping the design and small display of the iPhone 5,<ref name=\"scottstein\"/> and others expressed security concerns about the Touch ID system.<ref name=\"touch id hackers\"/> Nine million units of the iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were sold on the weekend of their release, breaking Apple's sales record for iPhones.<ref name=\"NYT iP5S sales 1\"/> The iPhone 5S was the best selling phone on all major U.S. carriers in September 2013.<ref name=\"iP5S best selling\"/>\n\nThe iPhone 5S was succeeded as Apple's flagship smartphone by the larger [[iPhone 6]] in September 2014. On March 21, 2016, the 5S received a direct replacement with the announcement of the [[iPhone SE]], which incorporated internal hardware similar to the [[iPhone 6S]] while retaining the smaller form factor and design of the 5S.<ref name=\"macworld-iphonese\">{{cite web|title=iPhone SE first look: Where 2012 meets 2016|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/3046615/iphone-ipad/iphone-se-first-look-its-2012-all-over-again.html|website=MacWorld|publisher=IDG|accessdate=23 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| footer = The iPhone&nbsp;5S was announced during a keynote at [[4 Infinite Loop]] on September 10, 2013.\n| image1    = 4 Infinite Loop.jpg\n| alt1      =  The front of 4 Infinite Loop at the Apple Campus.\n| width1 = 232\n}}\n\nBefore its official unveiling, media speculation primarily centered on reports that the next iPhone would include a [[fingerprint scanner]]; including Apple's July 2012 acquisition of [[AuthenTec]], a developer of [[mobile security]] products,<ref name=\"verge authentec 1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2012/7/27/3193078/apple-purchases-authentec-356-million|title=Apple buys patent-rich security firm Authentec for $356 million|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|work=[[The Verge (website)|The Verge]]|date=July 27, 2012|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}</ref> references to a fingerprint sensor on the home button in the beta release of [[iOS 7]]<ref name=\"verge ios7 finger\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/29/4568802/iphone-biometric-sensor-ios-7-beta-code|title=Apple references iPhone fingerprint sensor in latest iOS 7 beta|publisher=[[Vox Media]]|work=[[The Verge (website)|The Verge]]|date=July 29, 2013|accessdate=September 10, 2013}}</ref> and leaked packaging for an iPhone 5S showing that the traditional home button now had a metallic \"ring\" around it.

The 5C retained almost the same hardware as the discontinued iPhone 5, while the iPhone 5S featured substantially improved performance/features thanks to its new 64-bit A7 processor, as well as extra storage space, all for a relatively small additional upfront cost over the iPhone 5C (US$650 versus US$550 in March 2014). This was especially the case when iOS 8 was released and both iPhone 5S and iPhone 5C were moved to the mid and low end of the iPhone range, respectively; the iPhone 5S still had 16 or 32 GB (14.9 or 29.8 [[gibibyte|GiB]]) storage available while the iPhone 5C had to make do with 8 GB storage with only 4.9GB available to the user after installing iOS 8. Furthermore, the 5C's polycarbonate exterior received a mixed reception and was seen as a cost-cutting downgrade compared to the iPhone 5's aluminum/glass case; the 5S retained the latter design and looked even more premium due to its additional gold finish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gottabemobile.com/2014/09/23/iphone-5c-the-iphone-that-isnt-worth-buying-for-0/|title=iPhone 5c: The iPhone That Isn't Worth Buying for $0|author=Xavier Lanier|work=Gotta Be Mobile}}</ref><ref name=\"readwrite1\">{{cite web|url=http://readwrite.com/2014/03/18/iphone-5c-price-8gb|title=The 8GB iPhone 5C Is Still Not The Budget iPhone You Are Looking For|date=March 18, 2014|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2015\u201316, there were still a significant number of customers who preferred the 4-inch screen size of iPhone 5S, which remained the second-most popular iPhone after the iPhone 6 and ahead of the iPhone 6S. Apple stated in their event that they sold 30 million 4-inch iPhones in 2015, even as that form factor was succeeded as the flagship iPhone by the redesigned larger display 4.7/5.5-inch [[iPhone 6]] and 6 Plus back in September 2014. Furthermore, the 5/5S design was regarded as \"long been the golden child of Apple phone design and a benchmark for phones in general\" (with the 5S's gold finish adding a premium touch to the 5's already well-regarded look), while the succeeding 6 and 6S design was less critically acclaimed as it \"felt a little bit wrong, as though you were holding a slick $650 bar of soap\". The iPhone 5 was described as \"elegance rooted in the way the aluminum and glass work together. It felt streamlined, yet substantial, which is different from iPhone 6, which feels substantial in size alone. Plus, unlike the ubiquitous rounded corners of the 6, iPhone 5 didn\u2019t really look like anything else on the market at the time\". However, the iPhone 5/5S design was not suited to scaling up, in contrast to the iPhone 6/6S which could better accommodate the growing consumer trend towards larger screen sizes and indeed spawned the 6/6S Plus [[phablet]] models. When Apple discontinued the iPhone 5S, it was replaced by the iPhone SE which outwardly appears almost identical to the 5S even as the SE's internal hardware has been upgraded significantly.<ref name=\"forbes.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewanspence/2016/03/26/iphone-se-review-very-average-smartphone/#c8fbbb168fda|title=iPhone SE Reviews: Apple's Strange Case Of Jekyll And Hyde|date=26 March 2016|work=Forbes|accessdate=1 April 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"wired.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/03/iphone-se-smaller-phone/|title=With the iPhone SE, Apple Returns to a Masterpiece of Design|date=22 March 2016|work=WIRED|accessdate=1 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial reception===\nThe iPhone 5S and 5C sold over nine million units in the first three days, setting a record for first weekend smartphone sales,<ref name=\"NYT iP5S sales 1\">{{cite web|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/apple-sells-nine-million-new-iphones|title=Apple Sells Nine Million New iPhones|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|work=[[The New York Times]]|first=Brian X.|last=Chen|date=September 23, 2013|accessdate=September 23, 2013}}</ref> with the 5S selling three times more units than the 5C.

In charge of Jerusalem was [[Sophronius_of_Jerusalem|Patriarch Sophronius]], a representative of the Byzantine government, as well as a leader in the Christian Church. Although numerous Muslim armies under the command of [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]] and [['Amr ibn al-'As]] began to surround the city, Sophronius accepted to surrender but he demanded that Umar come to accept the surrender himself.\n\nHaving heard of such a condition, [[Umar ibn al-Khattab]] left Medina to Jerusalem.\n\n==Text==\nThe text as reported by [[al-Tabari]]:\n\n\n\u00abIn the name of Allah the Merciful,\nThis is what gave Abdullah, Omar, Commander of the Faithful, the people of Aelia from safety, he gave them security for themselves, their money, their churches, their crosses, their sin, their innocence, and all other sects. That their churches do not live and are not demolished, and there is no shortage of them, their realm or their cross, nor any of their money, and they do not hate their religion, and none of them is harmed, and no one dwells from them with any of the Jews. And the people of Aelia must be given a tribute, just as it is given to the people of the cities. They have to get the rum and thieves out Whoever comes out of it is safe for himself and his wealth until they reach their security. And he who resides among them is safe, and he is obligated to do the same as what the Aelias are obligated to pay.

Judge Barbara Cordoba, sitting in the Commercial Court in Barcelona, held that, under international air travel conventions, Ryanair can neither demand passengers turn up at the airport with their boarding pass, nor charge them \u20ac40 (\u00a330) if they do not, and that the fines were abusive because aviation law obliges airlines to issue boarding passes. Judge Cordoba stated that: \"I declare abusive and, therefore, null, the clause in the contract by which Ryanair obliges the passenger to take a boarding pass to the airport... the customary practice over the years has been that the obligation to provide the boarding pass has always fallen on the airline\". The judge ordered a refund for Mr. Garcia and said the fact the company was a low-cost carrier did \"not allow it to alter its basic contractual obligations\".<ref name=Charges4>{{cite news|author=Giles Tremlett |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/jan/14/ryanair-spanish-court-boarding-pass |title=Judge tells Ryanair that forcing passengers to print boarding passes is illegal |work=The Guardian |date= 14 January 2011|accessdate=30 September 2012 |location=London}}</ref> Ryanair appealed the decision and the Appeals Court in Spain overturned the ruling in November 2011, holding that the surcharge is in compliance with international law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ryanair.com/en/news/spanish-appeal-court-rules-ryanair-s-boarding-card-reissue-fee-legal |title=Spanish Appeal Court Rules Ryanair's Boarding Card Reissue Fee... |publisher=Ryanair.com |date=11 October 2011 |accessdate=30 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2011, Ryanair announced that it would fight against the UK Treasury's plan to ban what ''[[Which?]]'' magazine called \"rip-off\" charges made when customers paid by credit card.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/business/personal-finance/more-stories/ryanair_ready_for_the_fight_to_keep_excessive_card_charges_1_2023831 |title=Ryanair ready for the fight to keep 'excessive' card charges \u2013 More stories |work=The Scotsman |date= 24 December 2011|accessdate=25 December 2011}}</ref> EU legislation has already been drafted against surcharges for methods of payment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/pressroom/content/20110622IPR22326/html/Consumer-Rights-Parliament-approves-new-EU-wide-rules-for-on-line-shopping |title=Consumer Rights: Parliament approves new EU-wide rules for on-line shopping |publisher=European Parliament |accessdate=13 August 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Fuel incidents===\nOn 26 July 2012 three Ryanair aircraft inbound to [[Madrid\u2013Barajas Airport]] diverted to [[Valencia Airport]] due to severe thunderstorms in the Madrid area.

Judge Barbara Cordoba, sitting in the Commercial Court in Barcelona, held that, under international air travel conventions, Ryanair can neither demand passengers turn up at the airport with their boarding pass, nor charge them \u20ac40 (\u00a330) if they do not, and that the fines were abusive because aviation law obliges airlines to issue boarding passes. Judge Cordoba stated that: \"I declare abusive and, therefore, null, the clause in the contract by which Ryanair obliges the passenger to take a boarding pass to the airport... the customary practice over the years has been that the obligation to provide the boarding pass has always fallen on the airline\".

For instance, we accept as a common notion to worship joyously the classic beauty of St. Petersburg, its harmony and stately grandeur. This exposition does have variations of that sort. But observe \u201cNight Nevsky\u201d by Parygin. Rough to the touch texture, dark abyss. In the darkness urgent lights explode. They bring forth immediate spiritual angst. One does not regard the regal magnificence of the urban landscape-it is neither cast aside, nor left behind the curtains, as dramatism of  modern perception takes over. One regards not a city museum for curious crowds, but one beholds the habitat of our days where we seek, love, fight, suffer.

The intimate relationships between text and image is enhanced when author and artist are one and the same person and engage in an inter-art discourse that leads to creations that are truly unified works of art. An artist who achieved equal mastery in more than one medium and made different arts merge in his personality was no doubt Alexey Parygin. His poetic collections <...> represent an attempt to synthesize text and plastic figurative form in books where literary and visual languages are calculated to have a simultaneous effect on the reader/viewer.

His father [[Boris Parygin]] was a [[Social psychology|social psychologist]]. Alexey studied at the Graphics Faculty of the [[Herzen University]] from 1982\u20131989. He organized the art group \u201cUnion \u2116 0\u201d in Leningrad in 1986-1989 and created the art squatters\u2019 studio \u201cNevsky 25\u201d in Leningrad in 1987\u20131990.

For instance, we accept as a common notion to worship joyously the classic beauty of St. Petersburg, its harmony and stately grandeur. This exposition does have variations of that sort. But observe \u201cNight Nevsky\u201d by Parygin. Rough to the touch texture, dark abyss. In the darkness urgent lights explode. They bring forth immediate spiritual angst. One does not regard the regal magnificence of the urban landscape-it is neither cast aside, nor left behind the curtains, as dramatism of  modern perception takes over. One regards not a city museum for curious crowds, but one beholds the habitat of our days where we seek, love, fight, suffer.

The intimate relationships between text and image is enhanced when author and artist are one and the same person and engage in an inter-art discourse that leads to creations that are truly unified works of art. An artist who achieved equal mastery in more than one medium and made different arts merge in his personality was no doubt Alexey Parygin. His poetic collections <...> represent an attempt to synthesize text and plastic figurative form in books where literary and visual languages are calculated to have a simultaneous effect on the reader/viewer.

It was released on November 5, 2001 in the United States through [[Jive Records]]. Looking to transition from the [[teen pop]] styles of her earlier albums ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), Spears began to embrace a significantly more mature sound with ''Britney''. Its music incorporates genres of [[Pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] with influences of [[Electronic dance music|dance]] and occasionally dips into elements of [[disco]], [[hip hop]], [[Rock music|rock]], and [[electronica]]. Its lyrics address the subjects of reaching adulthood and sexuality.<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/britney-mw0000006300|title=Britney&nbsp;\u2014 Britney Spears|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|date=November 6, 2001|accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref> Contributions to its production came from a variety of collaborators, including [[Max Martin]] and [[Rami Yacoub]].<ref name=\"Credits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/britney-mw0000006300/credits|title=Britney&nbsp;\u2014 Britney Spears: Credits|publisher=Allmusic.

The album debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 745,750 copies. Its success made Spears the first female artist to have her first three studio albums debut atop the chart, a record she would later break again with her fourth studio album ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003). To promote the album, Spears embarked on her fourth concert tour, the [[Dream Within a Dream Tour]], which began in November 2001 and continued until July 2002. The album received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[45th Annual Grammy Awards]] (2003).<ref name=\"Nominations\">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Complete-list-of-Grammy-nominees-ceremony-set-2687689.php|title=Complete list of Grammy nominees; ceremony set for Feb. 23|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|date=January 8, 2003|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSix singles were released from the album. \"[[I'm a Slave 4 U]]\" reached the top ten in several countries but reached only number twenty-seven on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Spears's first lead single not to peak within the top ten of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. \"[[Overprotected]]\" and \"[[I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman]]\" had alternated as the second and third single of the album, respectively, both of which performed similarly internationally by reaching top ten in several countries, while the [[Darkchild]]  remix of the former peaked at number eighty-six on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100. \"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\", as well as the following singles \"[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll#Britney Spears version|I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]\", \"[[Anticipating]]\" (which was released exclusively in France) and \"[[Boys (Britney Spears song)|Boys]]\" didn't chart on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100; however all of them except for \"Anticipating\" reached the top ten in several countries albeit in less than its preceding singles.

She stated that she chose to self-title the album because the majority of its content describes who she is. Spears recorded twenty-three tracks for the release, several of which she co-wrote with the assistance of [[Brian Kierulf]] and Josh Schwartz.

It was released on November 5, 2001 in the United States through [[Jive Records]]. Looking to transition from the [[teen pop]] styles of her earlier albums ''[[...Baby One More Time (album)|...Baby One More Time]]'' (1999) and ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]'' (2000), Spears began to embrace a significantly more mature sound with ''Britney''. Its music incorporates genres of [[Pop music|pop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] with influences of [[Electronic dance music|dance]] and occasionally dips into elements of [[disco]], [[hip hop]], [[Rock music|rock]], and [[electronica]]. Its lyrics address the subjects of reaching adulthood and sexuality.<ref name=\"Allmusic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/britney-mw0000006300|title=Britney&nbsp;\u2014 Britney Spears|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|date=November 6, 2001|accessdate=April 18, 2013}}</ref> Contributions to its production came from a variety of collaborators, including [[Max Martin]] and [[Rami Yacoub]].<ref name=\"Credits\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/britney-mw0000006300/credits|title=Britney&nbsp;\u2014 Britney Spears: Credits|publisher=Allmusic.

The album debuted at number one on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with first-week sales of 745,750 copies. Its success made Spears the first female artist to have her first three studio albums debut atop the chart, a record she would later break again with her fourth studio album ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003). To promote the album, Spears embarked on her fourth concert tour, the [[Dream Within a Dream Tour]], which began in November 2001 and continued until July 2002. The album received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album|Best Pop Vocal Album]] at the [[45th Annual Grammy Awards]] (2003).<ref name=\"Nominations\">{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Complete-list-of-Grammy-nominees-ceremony-set-2687689.php|title=Complete list of Grammy nominees; ceremony set for Feb. 23|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|date=January 8, 2003|accessdate=April 19, 2013}}</ref>\n\nSix singles were released from the album. \"[[I'm a Slave 4 U]]\" reached the top ten in several countries but reached only number twenty-seven on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Spears's first lead single not to peak within the top ten of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. \"[[Overprotected]]\" and \"[[I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman]]\" had alternated as the second and third single of the album, respectively, both of which performed similarly internationally by reaching top ten in several countries, while the [[Darkchild]]  remix of the former peaked at number eighty-six on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100. \"I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a Woman\", as well as the following singles \"[[I Love Rock 'n' Roll#Britney Spears version|I Love Rock 'n' Roll]]\", \"[[Anticipating]]\" (which was released exclusively in France) and \"[[Boys (Britney Spears song)|Boys]]\" didn't chart on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100; however all of them except for \"Anticipating\" reached the top ten in several countries albeit in less than its preceding singles.

She married teacher William Shockley in 1948, and had two children named William Leslie Jr. and Tamara Ann.<ref name=\":1\" /> The couple later divorced but Shockley kept her ex-husband's last name.\n\nShockley was encouraged to read and write creatively at a young age and was heavily influenced by [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]]'s short story form in ''Uncle Tom's Children.'' Her eighth grade teacher, Harriet La Forest, was said to serve as Shockley's early mentor and had a large influence on Shockley's writing.<ref name=\":1\" /> She started writing for an audience in high school, where she worked as the editor for her school's newspaper. She continued to work as a journalist and column writer for various newspapers in her undergraduate studies and later graduated with a bachelor's degree from [[Fisk University]] in 1948. Shockley went on to receive her master's degree in [[library science]] from [[Case Western Reserve University]] in 1959.\n\nShockley worked as a librarian at [[Delaware State University|Delaware State College]] and the [[University of Maryland Eastern Shore]], before working for Special Negro Collection at [[Fisk University]] in 1969. She served as a professor of [[library science]], university archivist, as well as an associate librarian for special collections at Fisk and founded the Black Oral History Program until she later retired in 1988. Throughout her career, Shockley published several books on librarianship and special collections, particularly related to African-American collections.<ref name=\":1\" /> She became a writer of more than thirty short stories, novels, and articles that address issues of racism and homophobia.\n\n== Major works ==\n\n=== Newspaper columns ===\nThroughout July 1945 through March 1954, Shockley worked as a [[Freelancer|freelance]] newspaper columnist. She has several works in newspaper columns documented in ''Louisville Defender, Fisk University Herald, Federalsburg [MD] Times,'' and ''Bridgeville [DE] News'' that centered primarily around issues in the African American community and [[LGBT community]].<ref name=\":0\" /> Her writings can be found under \"Mostly Teen Talk\", \"Duffy's Corner\", and \"Ebony's Topics\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Short stories ===\nShockley also has many short stories that she has written, most of which center around the issues surrounding homosexuality, being African American, and being a woman. Through these short stories, Shockley sheds light on the conditions in which these people live and the impact these conditions have on their lives. A few of these short stories include \"Holly Craft Isn't Gay\"(1980), \"A Meeting of Sapphic Daughters\" (Spring 1979) which can be found in ''The Black and White of It'' (1980), as well as \"The Eternal Triangle\"(1948), \"The Curse of Kapa\"(1951), and \"Monday Will Be Better\"(1964), posted in various outlets such as ''Afro-American [Baltimore]'' and ''[[Negro Digest]]''.<ref name=\":0\" /> Most of Shockley's short stories were controversial for their time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stallings|first=L.H.|date=September 22, 2002|title=Re-reading Ann Allen Shockley through Queer Queen B Eyes|url=search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&AuthType=ip,uid&db=edsglr&AN=edsgcl.205734735&site=eds-live.|journal=Obsidian III|volume=|pages=68\u201369|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Non-fiction ===\n* ''A History of Public Library Services to Negroes in the South, 1900\u20131955'' (1960)\n* ''A Handbook for the Administration of Special Black Collections'' (1970)\n*''Living Black American Authors: A Biographical Directory'' (comp. and ed. with Sue P.

''Say Jesus and Come to Me'' in particular was said to introduce and recognize a character that typically lacks representation and appeared on the ''Christopher Street'' best seller's list, however Shockley was still criticized for her writing style and lack of structure in the stories.

Shockley herself attributes this lack of recognition due to the subject matter that she writes about.<ref name=\":1\" /> She claims that works addressing lesbian themes were rare at the time, as most publishers were not interested and writers were too fearful to admit to their own sexuality to push for publishing.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nJournals have come out that go as far to say that Shockley complicates [[Same gender loving|same-gender loving]] as well as problematizes it through her characterizations of African American people who also happen to be homosexual. Along with this, some argue that Shockley uses too many generalizations in her texts, has a poor stylistic choice, and did not work to battle common stereotypes about black lesbianism. In her first novel, ''Loving Her,'' the main character, Renay, chooses to live her life as a lesbian but still performs stereotypically heteronormative notions on romance, which works against Shockley's supposed intentions of exposing what a lesbian relationship really is like in the late twentieth-century.
