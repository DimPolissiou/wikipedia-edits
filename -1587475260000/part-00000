The following were announced by the UAAP Board: In support of the [[2019 Southeast Asian Games]] that the [[Philippines]] will host from November 30, 2019 to December 11, 2019, no UAAP event will be held for the duration of the regional meet; necessitating triple-headers during Wednesdays for men's and women's basketball in order for the tournament to end by the third week of November. Another way of ensuring the league's full cooperation, the UAAP Board will move some of the traditional first semester sports events into the second semester.\n\nHost Ateneo de Manila University announced the addition of new sporting events in both the collegiate and high school divisions.  Starting season 82, 3x3 Basketball will be an official sport. For the high school division, Boys' and Girls' Beach Volleyball will be added as medal events and Boys' and Girls' Lawn Tennis  as demo sports. For the first time in league history, a Girls' Basketball Tournament will be held as a demonstration sport starting UAAP Season 82. National University will serve as the sub-host for this inaugural tournament.\n\nUAAP President Em Fernandez explained that for the past two seasons, 3x3 basketball has been a demonstration sport and with the active participation of all member schools, the league has deemed to upgrade it as an official sport, raising the medal events in the collegiate level to 31.\n\nFar Eastern University will serve as the sub-host for this season's 3x3 basketball tournament that is set to take place on March 2020.\n\nOn the other hand, lawn tennis and beach volleyball in the high school division will be making its debut.\n\nBeach volleyball, which will be sub-hosted by University of Sto. Tomas, will open its curtains on January 2020 while lawn tennis, which will be sub-hosted by National University, is scheduled to take place on February 2020.\n\nAnother firsts for the country's most prestigious collegiate league are the official Twitter and Instagram accounts (both @uaap_official) where official announcements from the league will be posted by the current school host and will be handed over to the next host once the current season is over.\n\n==Opening ceremony==\nThe opening ceremony of UAAP Season 82 was held on September 1, 2019 at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]]. \"All for More\" is the theme for Season 82. Like [[UAAP Season 74|Season 74]] (the last time Ateneo hosted) and [[UAAP Season 79|Season 79]], the start of the men's basketball games won't be held after the opening ceremony. Instead, it will be held three days later on September 4, 2019 at the [[Smart Araneta Coliseum]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/uaap_official/status/1159406041525891073|title=The #UAAPSeason82 Men\u2019s Basketball first round schedule. https://ift.tt/2KnmLfJ pic.twitter.com/G3zRbJglLi|last=UAAP|first=The|date=2019-08-08|website=@uaap_official|language=en|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/uaap_official/status/1159406033904775168|title=The #UAAPSeason82 Women\u2019s Basketball first round schedule. https://ift.tt/31tPUM7 pic.twitter.com/3NNcAUVjdt|last=UAAP|first=The|date=2019-08-08|website=@uaap_official|language=en|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref> The high school volleyball tournament also commences on the same day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/uaap_official/status/1161144202043879424|title=Rest of the first round schedule of #UAAPSeason82 HS volleyball.pic.twitter.com/qUBmU6XvD3|last=UAAP|first=The|date=2019-08-12|website=@uaap_official|language=en|access-date=2019-08-21}}</ref>\n\n==Sports calendar==\nThis is the calendar of sports events of UAAP Season 82.

The following were announced by the UAAP Board: In support of the [[2019 Southeast Asian Games]] that the [[Philippines]] will host from November 30, 2019 to December 11, 2019, no UAAP event will be held for the duration of the regional meet; necessitating triple-headers during Wednesdays for men's and women's basketball in order for the tournament to end by the third week of November. Another way of ensuring the league's full cooperation, the UAAP Board will move some of the traditional first semester sports events into the second semester.\n\nHost Ateneo de Manila University announced the addition of new sporting events in both the collegiate and high school divisions.  Starting season 82, 3x3 Basketball will be an official sport. For the high school division, Boys' and Girls' Beach Volleyball will be added as medal events and Boys' and Girls' Lawn Tennis  as demo sports. For the first time in league history, a Girls' Basketball Tournament will be held as a demonstration sport starting UAAP Season 82. National University will serve as the sub-host for this inaugural tournament.\n\nUAAP President Em Fernandez explained that for the past two seasons, 3x3 basketball has been a demonstration sport and with the active participation of all member schools, the league has deemed to upgrade it as an official sport, raising the medal events in the collegiate level to 31.\n\nFar Eastern University will serve as the sub-host for this season's 3x3 basketball tournament that is set to take place on March 2020.\n\nOn the other hand, lawn tennis and beach volleyball in the high school division will be making its debut.\n\nBeach volleyball, which will be sub-hosted by University of Sto. Tomas, will open its curtains on January 2020 while lawn tennis, which will be sub-hosted by National University, is scheduled to take place on February 2020.\n\nAnother firsts for the country's most prestigious collegiate league are the official Twitter and Instagram accounts (both @uaap_official) where official announcements from the league will be posted by the current school host and will be handed over to the next host once the current season is over.\n\n==Opening ceremony==\nThe opening ceremony of UAAP Season 82 was held on September 1, 2019 at the [[Mall of Asia Arena]]. \"All for More\" is the theme for Season 82. Like [[UAAP Season 74|Season 74]] (the last time Ateneo hosted) and [[UAAP Season 79|Season 79]], the start of the men's basketball games won't be held after the opening ceremony.

Written by [[Barry Hines]] and directed and produced by [[Mick Jackson (director)|Mick Jackson]], it is a dramatic account of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] and its effects on the city of [[Sheffield]] in [[Northern England]]. The plot centres on two families as a confrontation between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] erupts. As the nuclear exchange between [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] begins, the film depicts the medical, economic, social and environmental consequences of nuclear war.\n\nShot on a budget of [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]400,000, the film was the first of its kind to depict a [[nuclear winter]]. It has been called \"a film which comes closest to representing the full horror of nuclear war and its aftermath, as well as the catastrophic impact that the event would have on human culture.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=MdgfWkeAMD4C&pg=PA237&lpg=PA237&dq=film+which+comes+closest+to+representing+the+full+horror+of+nuclear+war+and+its+aftermath,+as+well+as+the+catastrophic+impact+that+the+event+would+have&source=bl&ots=CNtyXEVK4T&sig=IrVaJYFcleCITDv03vrBsTuBi8w&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIscPi8oOExgIViu0UCh1gOwC3#v=onepage&q=film%20which%20comes%20closest%20to%20representing%20the%20full%20horror%20of%20nuclear%20war%20and%20its%20aftermath%2C%20as%20well%20as%20the%20catastrophic%20impact%20that%20the%20event%20would%20have&f=false \"Film and the Nuclear Age: Representing Cultural Anxiety\" By Toni A.

As tensions between the US and the Soviet Union in [[Iran]] escalate, the [[Home Office]] directs [[Sheffield City Council]] to assemble an emergency operations team, which establishes itself in a makeshift [[bomb shelter]] in the basement of the [[Sheffield Town Hall|town hall]]. After an ignored US ultimatum to the Soviets results in a brief tactical nuclear skirmish, Britain experiences fear, looting and rioting. \"Subversives\" including [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|peace activists]] and some trade unionists are arrested and interned under the [[Emergency Powers Act 1964|Emergency Powers Act]].\n\n[[File:Along Curbar Edge - geograph.org.uk - 551058.jpg|left|thumb|Curbar Edge, [[Peak District]], where the scenes set six weeks after the attack take place.]]\n[[HANDEL|Attack Warning Red]] is transmitted and Sheffield town hall staff react with \"action, confusion and slight panic.\"<ref>{{cite book |year=1990 |editor-last=Mangan |editor-first=Michael |title=Threads and Other Sheffield Plays |series=Critical Stages |volume=3 |location=Sheffield |publisher=[[Sheffield Academic Press]] |page=198 |isbn=978-1-850-75140-3 |issn=0953-0533}}</ref> Amidst panic, a nuclear warhead [[air burst]]s high over the [[North Sea]], producing an [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulse]]; most electrical systems throughout the UK and [[northwestern Europe]] are destroyed. The first missile salvos hit [[NATO]] targets, including nearby [[RAF Finningley]]. Although the city is not yet heavily damaged, chaos reigns in the streets. Jimmy is last seen running from his stalled car to reach Ruth. Sheffield is targeted by a one-[[TNT equivalent|megaton]] warhead which air bursts directly above the [[Tinsley Viaduct]]. Strategic targets, including steel and chemical factories in the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]], are the primary targets. Two thirds of all UK homes are destroyed, and immediate deaths range between 12 and 30 million. Of 3,000 megatons total, about 210 fall on the UK.\n\nSheffield Town Hall is destroyed and traps the city's emergency operations team. They attempt to coordinate the city's emergency and relief efforts through their few remaining short wave radios. [[Nuclear fallout]] from a [[ground burst]] at [[Crewe]] descends upon Sheffield. Jimmy's mother succumbs to [[radiation sickness]] and severe burns after being caught by the Tinsley Viaduct explosion. Jimmy's father searches for food and water. Fallout prevents the remaining functioning civil authorities from fighting fires or rescuing those trapped under debris. Ruth leaves her parents and grandmother in their basement, making her way to the [[Sheffield Royal Infirmary]], where there is no electricity, running water, sanitation, or supplies. While she is absent, looters kill her parents and are executed.\n\nBy June, soldiers dig to the town hall basement but find the emergency staff have suffocated. Without the manpower or fuel to bury or burn the dead, an epidemic of communicable diseases spreads. The government authorizes [[capital punishment]], and special courts execute criminals. The only viable currency becomes food, given as a reward for work or withheld as punishment. The millions of tons of soot, smoke and dust in the upper atmosphere trigger a [[nuclear winter]]. By July, without running water, electricity, or basic sanitation, Sheffield becomes uninhabitable. Ruth and thousands of other survivors defy official orders and leave the city. Many survivors die of radiation poisoning. Low-flying government light aircraft order them to return home. In [[Buxton]], the police assign Ruth to a house. Once the policeman leaves, the home owner evicts her at gunpoint. At an outdoor soup kitchen, Ruth meets Bob, a pre-war acquaintance of Jimmy's. Ruth and Bob travel together, surviving on scavenged food, including the raw carcasses of radiation poisoned livestock.\n\nIn September, Ruth partakes in the yearly harvest, accomplished using the last remaining petrol and raw human labour, but the nuclear winter keeps yields low. Ruth gives birth to her child in an abandoned barn. The army relies on rifles and tear gas for control.\n\nMillions of people around the Northern Hemisphere have died due to radiation, fallout, starvation, exposure or the nuclear strikes. Sunlight returns, but food remains scarce due to the lack of equipment, fertilizers, and fuel. Damage to the [[ozone layer]] intensifies [[ultraviolet radiation]], increasing [[cataracts]] and [[cancer]].\n\nTen years later, Britain's population has fallen to medieval levels of about 4 to 11 million people. Survivors work the fields using primitive hand-held farming tools. Few children have been born or raised since the attack. They speak broken English due to poor education and the breakdown of family life. Prematurely aged and blind with cataracts, Ruth collapses in a field and dies, survived by her 10-year-old daughter Jane. The country begins to recover, resuming [[coal mining]], producing limited electricity, and using steam power. The population continues to live in near-barbaric squalor.\n\nThree years after Ruth's death, Jane and two boys are caught stealing food. One boy is shot in the ensuing confusion. Jane wrestles for the food with the other boy and they have sex; while Hines' published script does not describe this as rape,<ref>{{cite book |year=1990 |editor-last=Mangan |editor-first=Michael |title=Threads and Other Sheffield Plays |series=Critical Stages |volume=3 |location=Sheffield |publisher=[[Sheffield Academic Press]] |page=234 |isbn=978-1-850-75140-3 |issn=0953-0533}}</ref> it has been widely interpreted as such.<ref name=\"BFIScreenOnline\">{{cite web | author=[[BFI]] | website=[[Screenonline]] | title=Threads (1984) | url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/730560/synopsis.html | date=2013\u201314 | accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Telegraph2018\">{{cite news | last=Hogan | first=Michael | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/britain-atomic-bomb-threads-terrifying-ever/ | title=Britain after the atomic bomb: why Threads is more terrifying than ever | date=9 April 2019 | accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Tribune2019\">{{cite news | last=Foster | first=Dawn | url=https://tribunemag.co.uk/2019/02/apocalypse-now | title=Apocalypse Now | work=[[Tribune]] | date=14 February 2019 | accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref> Pregnant, Jane finds a makeshift hospital, gives birth to a child which is depicted as not crying nor moving (the implication being of a stillbirth), and screams as she sees it; again, while Hines' script does not describe the child as mutated, this interpretation is widespread.<ref name=\"BFIScreenOnline\"/><ref name=\"Telegraph2018\"/><ref name=\"IrishTimes2015\">{{cite news | last=Freyne | first=Patrick | work=[[The Irish Times]] | url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/what-should-we-do-in-the-event-of-a-nuclear-war-1.2451991 | title=What should we do in the event of a nuclear war? | date=2 December 2015 | accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\nAlthough Jackson initially considered casting actors from ''[[Coronation Street]]'', he later decided to take a [[Neorealism (art)|neorealist]] approach, and opted to cast relatively unknown actors in order to heighten the film's impact through the use of characters the audience could relate to.<ref name=\"scotsman\"/>\n\n* [[Paul Vaughan]] as the Narrator\n* [[Karen Meagher]] as Ruth Beckett\n* [[Reece Dinsdale]] as Jimmy Kemp\n* [[David Brierley]] as Mr Bill Kemp\n* [[Rita May (actress)|Rita May]] as Mrs Rita Kemp\n* Nicholas Lane as Michael Kemp\n* [[Jane Hazlegrove]] as Alison Kemp\n* [[Phil Rose]] as Doctor Talbot \n* Henry Moxon as Mr Beckett\n* June Broughton as Mrs Beckett\n* Sylvia Stoker as Granny Beckett\n* Harry Beety as Clive J.

Written by [[Barry Hines]] and directed and produced by [[Mick Jackson (director)|Mick Jackson]], it is a dramatic account of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]] and its effects on the city of [[Sheffield]] in [[Northern England]]. The plot centres on two families as a confrontation between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] erupts. As the nuclear exchange between [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]] begins, the film depicts the medical, economic, social and environmental consequences of nuclear war.\n\nShot on a budget of [[pound sterling|\u00a3]]400,000, the film was the first of its kind to depict a [[nuclear winter]]. It has been called \"a film which comes closest to representing the full horror of nuclear war and its aftermath, as well as the catastrophic impact that the event would have on human culture.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=MdgfWkeAMD4C&pg=PA237&lpg=PA237&dq=film+which+comes+closest+to+representing+the+full+horror+of+nuclear+war+and+its+aftermath,+as+well+as+the+catastrophic+impact+that+the+event+would+have&source=bl&ots=CNtyXEVK4T&sig=IrVaJYFcleCITDv03vrBsTuBi8w&hl=fr&sa=X&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMIscPi8oOExgIViu0UCh1gOwC3#v=onepage&q=film%20which%20comes%20closest%20to%20representing%20the%20full%20horror%20of%20nuclear%20war%20and%20its%20aftermath%2C%20as%20well%20as%20the%20catastrophic%20impact%20that%20the%20event%20would%20have&f=false \"Film and the Nuclear Age: Representing Cultural Anxiety\" By Toni A.

As tensions between the US and the Soviet Union in [[Iran]] escalate, the [[Home Office]] directs [[Sheffield City Council]] to assemble an emergency operations team, which establishes itself in a makeshift [[bomb shelter]] in the basement of the [[Sheffield Town Hall|town hall]]. After an ignored US ultimatum to the Soviets results in a brief tactical nuclear skirmish, Britain experiences fear, looting and rioting. \"Subversives\" including [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|peace activists]] and some trade unionists are arrested and interned under the [[Emergency Powers Act 1964|Emergency Powers Act]].\n\n[[File:Along Curbar Edge - geograph.org.uk - 551058.jpg|left|thumb|Curbar Edge, [[Peak District]], where the scenes set six weeks after the attack take place.]]\n[[HANDEL|Attack Warning Red]] is transmitted and Sheffield town hall staff react with \"action, confusion and slight panic.\"<ref>{{cite book |year=1990 |editor-last=Mangan |editor-first=Michael |title=Threads and Other Sheffield Plays |series=Critical Stages |volume=3 |location=Sheffield |publisher=[[Sheffield Academic Press]] |page=198 |isbn=978-1-850-75140-3 |issn=0953-0533}}</ref> Amidst panic, a nuclear warhead [[air burst]]s high over the [[North Sea]], producing an [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulse]]; most electrical systems throughout the UK and [[northwestern Europe]] are destroyed. The first missile salvos hit [[NATO]] targets, including nearby [[RAF Finningley]]. Although the city is not yet heavily damaged, chaos reigns in the streets. Jimmy is last seen running from his stalled car to reach Ruth. Sheffield is targeted by a one-[[TNT equivalent|megaton]] warhead which air bursts directly above the [[Tinsley Viaduct]]. Strategic targets, including steel and chemical factories in the [[Midlands (England)|Midlands]], are the primary targets. Two thirds of all UK homes are destroyed, and immediate deaths range between 12 and 30 million. Of 3,000 megatons total, about 210 fall on the UK.\n\nSheffield Town Hall is destroyed and traps the city's emergency operations team. They attempt to coordinate the city's emergency and relief efforts through their few remaining short wave radios. [[Nuclear fallout]] from a [[ground burst]] at [[Crewe]] descends upon Sheffield. Jimmy's mother succumbs to [[radiation sickness]] and severe burns after being caught by the Tinsley Viaduct explosion. Jimmy's father searches for food and water. Fallout prevents the remaining functioning civil authorities from fighting fires or rescuing those trapped under debris. Ruth leaves her parents and grandmother in their basement, making her way to the [[Sheffield Royal Infirmary]], where there is no electricity, running water, sanitation, or supplies. While she is absent, looters kill her parents and are executed.\n\nBy June, soldiers dig to the town hall basement but find the emergency staff have suffocated. Without the manpower or fuel to bury or burn the dead, an epidemic of communicable diseases spreads. The government authorizes [[capital punishment]], and special courts execute criminals. The only viable currency becomes food, given as a reward for work or withheld as punishment. The millions of tons of soot, smoke and dust in the upper atmosphere trigger a [[nuclear winter]]. By July, without running water, electricity, or basic sanitation, Sheffield becomes uninhabitable. Ruth and thousands of other survivors defy official orders and leave the city. Many survivors die of radiation poisoning. Low-flying government light aircraft order them to return home. In [[Buxton]], the police assign Ruth to a house. Once the policeman leaves, the home owner evicts her at gunpoint. At an outdoor soup kitchen, Ruth meets Bob, a pre-war acquaintance of Jimmy's. Ruth and Bob travel together, surviving on scavenged food, including the raw carcasses of radiation poisoned livestock.\n\nIn September, Ruth partakes in the yearly harvest, accomplished using the last remaining petrol and raw human labour, but the nuclear winter keeps yields low. Ruth gives birth to her child in an abandoned barn. The army relies on rifles and tear gas for control.\n\nMillions of people around the Northern Hemisphere have died due to radiation, fallout, starvation, exposure or the nuclear strikes. Sunlight returns, but food remains scarce due to the lack of equipment, fertilizers, and fuel. Damage to the [[ozone layer]] intensifies [[ultraviolet radiation]], increasing [[cataracts]] and [[cancer]].\n\nTen years later, Britain's population has fallen to medieval levels of about 4 to 11 million people. Survivors work the fields using primitive hand-held farming tools. Few children have been born or raised since the attack. They speak broken English due to poor education and the breakdown of family life. Prematurely aged and blind with cataracts, Ruth collapses in a field and dies, survived by her 10-year-old daughter Jane. The country begins to recover, resuming [[coal mining]], producing limited electricity, and using steam power. The population continues to live in near-barbaric squalor.\n\n<!--THE PUBLISHED SCRIPT DOES NOT CHARACTERISE OR DESCRIBE THE EVENT IN THE PARAGRAPH BELOW AS \"RAPE\" - ANY CHANGE TO DESCRIBE OR SUGGEST IT AS SUCH WILL BE REGARDED AS VANDALISM AND DEALT WITH ACCORDINGLY.

In [[Atlanta]] and New York City the marches were called ''Gay Liberation Marches'', and the day of celebration was called \"Gay Liberation Day\"; in Los Angeles and San Francisco they became known as 'Gay Freedom Marches' and the day was called \"Gay Freedom Day\". As more cities and even smaller towns began holding their own celebrations, these names spread. The rooted ideology behind the parades is a critique of space which has been produced to seem [[heteronormative]] and 'straight', and therefore any act appearing to be homosexual is considered dissident by society. The Parade brings this homosexual behaviour into the space.\n\nIn the 1980s, there was a cultural shift in the gay movement.

The variation is largely dependent upon the political, economic, and religious settings of the area. However, in more accepting cities, the parades take on a festive or even [[Mardi Gras]]-like character, whereby the political stage is built on notions of celebration. Large parades often involve floats, dancers, [[drag queen]]s and amplified music; but even such celebratory parades usually include political and educational contingents, such as local politicians and marching groups from LGBT institutions of various kinds. Other typical parade participants include local LGBT-friendly churches such as [[Metropolitan Community Church]]es, [[United Church of Christ]], and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] Churches, [[PFLAG]], and LGBT employee associations from large businesses.\n\nEven the most festive parades usually offer some aspect dedicated to remembering victims of [[AIDS]] and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and [[corporate sponsorship|corporate sponsors]] and promoted as major [[tourist attraction]]s for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere in a nearby park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade can be hard to establish in some events, however, in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.\n\nThough the reality was that the Stonewall riots themselves, as well as the immediate and the ongoing political organizing that occurred following them, were events fully participated in by lesbian women, bisexual people, and transgender people, as well as by gay men of all races and backgrounds, historically these events were first named ''Gay'', the word at that time being used in a more generic sense to cover the entire spectrum of what is now variously called the 'queer' or LGBT community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary for Sylvia Rae Rivera|url=http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|publisher=Sylvia's Place|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928113130/http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gender.org/remember/people/marshajohnson.html |title=Marsha P.

The language has become more accurate and inclusive, though these changes met with initial resistance from some in their own communities who were unaware of the historical events.<ref>[http://www.nyabn.org/Pages/WhoWeR/OurHistory.html New York Area Bisexual Network: A Brief History of NYC's Bisexual Community].

The first [[Tel Aviv Pride|Pride parade in Tel Aviv]] took place in 1993.\n\nOn June 30, 2005, the fourth annual Pride march of [[Jerusalem]] took place. The Jerusalem parade has been met with resistance due to the high presence of religious bodies in the city. It had originally been prohibited by a municipal ban which was canceled by the court. Many of the religious leaders of Jerusalem's [[Muslim]], [[Jewish]], and [[Christians|Christian]] communities had arrived to a rare consensus asking the municipal government to cancel the permit of the paraders.\n\nAnother parade, this time billed as an international event, was scheduled to take place in the summer of 2005, but was postponed to 2006 due to the stress on police forces during the summer of [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan]]. In 2006, it was again postponed due to the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict|Israel-Hezbollah war]]. It was scheduled to take place in Jerusalem on November 10, 2006, and caused a wave of protests by [[Haredi]] Jews around central Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=114609 |title=9 Protesters Detained at Anti-Gay Pride Demonstration |publisher=[[Arutz 7]] |date=November 1, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The [[Israeli Police|Israel National Police]] had filed a petition to cancel the parade due to foreseen strong opposition. Later, an agreement was reached to convert the parade into an assembly inside the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem|Hebrew University]] stadium in Jerusalem. June 21, 2007, the [[Jerusalem Open House]] organization succeeded in staging a parade in central Jerusalem after police allocated thousands of personnel to secure the general area. The rally planned afterwards was canceled due to an unrelated national fire brigade strike which prevented proper permits from being issued. The parade was postponed once more in 2014, as a result of [[2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict|Protective Edge]] Operation.\n\n====Japan====\n{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\n''See also [[:ja:\u30b2\u30a4\u30fb\u30d1\u30ec\u30fc\u30c9#\u65e5\u672c|Pride Parade in Japan]]''\n\nThe first Pride Parade in Japan was held on August 28th, 1994 in Tokyo (while the names were not Pride Parade until 2007).

At Quezon City Memorial Circle, a program was held with a Queer Pride Mass and solidarity remarks from various organizations and individuals.\n\nIn 1995 MCC, ProGay Philippines and other organizations held internal celebrations. In 1996, 1997 and 1998 large and significant marches were organized and produced by Reachout AIDS Foundation, all of which were held in Malate, Manila, Philippines. In 1998, the year of the centennial commemoration of the Republic of the Philippines, a Gay and Lesbian Pride March was incorporated in the mammoth \"citizens' parade\" which was part of the official centennial celebration. That parade culminated in \"marching by\" the President of the Philippines, His Excellency Joseph Estrada, at the Quirino Grandstand in Luneta Park in Manila.\n\nIn 1999, Task Force Pride Philippines (TFP), a network of LGBT and LGBT-friendly groups and individuals seeking to promote positive visibility for the LGBT community was born. Since then, TFP has been organizing the annual Metro Manila Pride March. In 2003, a decision was made to move the Pride March from June to the December Human Rights Week to coincide with related human rights activities such as World AIDS Day (December 1), Philippine National Lesbian Day (December 8), and International Human Rights Day (December 10).\n\nOn December 10, 2005, the First LGBT Freedom March, with the theme \"CPR: Celebrating Pride and Rights\" was held along the streets of Espa\u00f1a and Quiapo in Manila, Philippines. Concerned that the prevailing economic and political crisis in the country at the time presented threats to freedoms and liberties of all Filipinos, including sexual and gender minorities, LGBT individuals and groups, non-government organizations and members of various communities and sectors organized the LGBT Freedom March calling for systemic and structural change. At historic Plaza Miranda, in front of Quiapo Church, despite the pouring rain, a program with performances and speeches depicting LGBT pride was held soon after the march.\nOn December 6, 2014, Philippines will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150709154531/http://metromanilapride.org/ Metro Manila Pride] March with the theme: Come Out For Love ''Kasi Pag-ibig Pa Rin'' (Come Out For Love Because It's Still All About Love). The theme is a reminder of the love and passion that started and sustained 20 years of taking to the streets for the recognition and respect of LGBT lives as human lives. It is also a celebration of and an invitation for families, friends, and supporters of LGBT people to claim Metro Manila Pride as a safe space to voice their support for the community, for the LGBT human rights advocacy, and for the people they love and march with every year.\n\nThe 21st Metro Manila Pride March in 2015, entitled Fight For Love, was held on the 25th of July.

Out of all ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] states, at that time only [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] had a tradition of organising Pride events, whereas the attempt to organize such an event in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] in 2001, ended in a bloody showdown between the police and the counter-protesters, with the participants heavily beaten up. This manifestation was held in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] from June 22\u201325, 2006 and brought together representatives of those Eastern European and [[Balkans|Southeastern European]] countries where the sociopolitical climate is not ripe for the organization of Prides, or where such a manifestation is expressly forbidden by the authorities. From 13 countries that participated, only [[Poland]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Latvia]] have been organizing Prides. [[Slovakia]] also hosted the pride, but encountered many problems with Slovak extremists from [[Slovenska pospolitost]] (the pride did not cross the centre of the city). [[Republic of Macedonia|North Macedonia]] and [[Albania]] also host Pride Parades with no major issues arising, mainly due to the protection from police. [[Lithuania]] has never had Prides before. There were also representatives from [[Kosovo]], that participated apart from Serbia. It was the very first Pride organized jointly with other states and nations, which only ten years ago have been at war with each other. Weak cultural, political and social cooperation exists among these states, with an obvious lack of public encouragement for solidarity, which organizers hoped to initiate through that regional Pride event. The host and the initiator of The Internationale LGBT Pride was [[Zagreb Pride]], which has been held since 2002.\n\n====Bosnia and Herzegovina====\nThe first Pride parade in Bosnia and Herzegovina was held on 8 September 2019 in Sarajevo under the slogan ''Ima Iza\u0107' '' (Coming Out).

Although homosexuality was decriminalized in 1968, people with different sexual orientations and identities are still not well accepted in society. In 2003 the country enacted several laws protecting the [[LGBT]] community and individuals from discrimination. In 2008, Bulgaria organized its first ever pride parade. The almost 200 people who had gathered were attacked by [[skinhead]]s, but police managed to prevent any injuries. The 2009 pride parade, with the motto \"Rainbow Friendship\" attracted more than 300 participants from [[Bulgaria]] and tourists from [[Greece]] and [[UK|Great Britain]]. There were no disruptions and the parade continued as planned.

Copenhagen Pride is a colourful and festive occasion, combining political issues with concerts, films and a parade. The focal point is the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]] in the city centre. It usually opens on the Wednesday of Pride Week, culminating on the Saturday with a parade and Denmark's Mr Gay contest.

The Festival involves the Pride Parade, the route of which is from [[O'Connell Street]] to [[Merrion Square]]. However, the route was changed for the 2017 Parade due to [[Luas Cross City]] works.\nThe parade attracts thousands of people who line the streets each year.

Participants included [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]], [[Amnesty International]] observers and random individuals who travelled from abroad to support LGBT Latvians and their friends and families.\n\nIn 2008, the Riga Pride was held in the historically potent 11. novembra krastmala (November 11 [[Bank (geography)|Embankment]]) beneath the [[Riga Castle]]. The participants heard speeches from MEPs and a message of support from the [[President of Latvia|Latvian President]]. The embankment was not open and was isolated from the public with some participants having trouble getting past police cordons. About 300 ''No Pride'' protesters gathered on the bridges behind barricades erected by the police who kept Pride participants and the \"No Pride\" protesters separated. Participants were once more \"bused\" out but this time a 5-minute journey to central Riga.\n\nIn 2009, the annual Baltic Pride was launched, with the first edition being held in Riga with a march. This event and the following ones have been held without serious incidents.\n\nThe 2012 Baltic Pride was held on June 2nd. The parade marched through T\u0113rbatas street from the corner of \u0122ertr\u016bdes street towards V\u0113rmane Garden, where concerts and a conference were held.

The very first Gay Pride Parade in Madrid was held in June 1979 nearly four years after the death of Spain's dictator [[Francisco Franco]], with the gradual arrival of democracy and the de-criminalization of homosexuality. Since then, dozens of companies like [[Microsoft]], [[Google]] and [[Schweppes]] and several political parties and trade unions, including [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]], [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|PODEMOS]], [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]], [[Union, Progress and Democracy]], [[CCOO]] and [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores|UGT]] have been sponsoring and supporting the parade. Madrid Pride Parade is the biggest gay demonstration in Europe, with more than 1.5 million attendees in 2009, according to the [[Spanish government]].\n\nIn 2007, [[Europride]], the European Pride Parade, took place in [[Madrid]]. About 2.5 million people attended more than 300 events over one week in the Spanish capital to celebrate Spain as the country with the most developed LGBT rights in the world. Independent media estimated that more than 200,000 visitors came from foreign countries to join in the festivities. Madrid gay district [[Chueca]], the biggest gay district in Europe, was the centre of the celebrations. The event was supported by the city, regional and national government and private sector which also ensured that the event was financially successful. [[Barcelona]], [[Valencia]] and [[Seville]] hold also local Pride Parades. In 2008 [[Barcelona]] hosted the [[EuroGames (LGBT sporting event)|Eurogames]].\n\nIn 2014, Winter Pride Maspalomas was held for the first time at [[Maspalomas]], [[Gran Canaria, Canary Islands]], one of one Europe's most popular LGTB tourist destinations.

The march is the event's main activity and the one that draws the biggest attention to the press, the Brazilian authorities, and the hundreds of thousands of curious people that line themselves along the parade's route. In 2009, 3.2 million people attended the 13th annual Gay Pride Parade.\n\nThe second biggest Pride Parade in Brazil is [[Rio de Janeiro]] Gay Pride Parade, numbering about 2 million people, traditionally taking place in [[Zona Sul]] or Rio's most affluent neighborhoods between the city center and the world-famous oceanic beaches, which usually happens in the second part of the year, when it is winter or spring in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], generally characterizing milder weather for Rio de Janeiro (about 15[[Celsius|\u00b0C]] in difference), except for occasional stormy cold fronts. The Rio de Janeiro Gay Pride Parade and its associated events are organized by the NGO Arco-\u00cdris ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''rainbow''). The group is one of the founders of the [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Gays, L\u00e9sbicas, Bissexuais, Travestis e Transexuais]] (Brazilian Association of Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuals, Transvestites (this word used as a synonym for transgender persons in Brazil) and Transsexuals). Other Pride Parades which happen in [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]] take place in [[Niter\u00f3i]], Rio de Janeiro's ex-capital in the times when Rio was the Brazilian capital and a separated [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]], and [[Nova Igua\u00e7u]], where about 800,000 persons live and is located in the center of [[Baixada Fluminense]], which compose all northern suburban cities of Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area numbering 3.5 million people.\n\nOther [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeastern Brazilian]] parades are held in [[Cabo Frio]] ([[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]), [[Campinas]] ([[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]), [[Vit\u00f3ria, Esp\u00edrito Santo|Vit\u00f3ria]] (capital of [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]]), and [[Belo Horizonte]] and [[Uberaba]] ([[Minas Gerais]]). [[South Region, Brazil|Southern Brazilian]] parades take place in [[Curitiba]], [[Florian\u00f3polis]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Pelotas]], and [[Center-West Region, Brazil|Center-Western]] ones happen in [[Campo Grande]], [[Cuiab\u00e1]], [[Goi\u00e2nia]] and [[Bras\u00edlia]]. Across [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]], they are present in all capitals, namely, in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Aracaju]], [[Macei\u00f3]], [[Recife]], [[Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Para\u00edba|Jo\u00e3o Pessoa]], [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Teresina]] and [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds]], and also in [[Cear\u00e1]]'s [[Sert\u00e3o|hinterland]] major urban center, [[Juazeiro do Norte]].

As more cities and even smaller towns began holding their own celebrations, these names spread. The rooted ideology behind the parades is a critique of space which has been produced to seem [[heteronormative]] and 'straight', and therefore any act appearing to be homosexual is considered dissident by society. The Parade brings this homosexual behaviour into the space.\n\nIn the 1980s, there was a cultural shift in the gay movement. Activists of a less radical nature began taking over the march committees in different cities,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kolher|first1=Will|title=June 28, 1970 \u2013 From Liberation to Pride: The 45th Anniversary of the Christopher Street Liberation Day March \u2013 Rare Video|url=http://www.back2stonewall.com/2015/06/june-28-1970-liberation-pride-45th-anniversary-christopher-street-liberation-day-march-rare-video.html|accessdate=December 11, 2017|publisher=back2stonewall.com|date=June 28, 2015}}</ref> and they dropped \"Gay Liberation\" and \"Gay Freedom\" from the names, replacing them with \"Gay Pride\".\n[[File:Chicago Pride Parade 1985 030.jpg|thumb|right|Pride march in [[Lakeview, Chicago]] in 1985]]\n\n==Description==\n[[File: Gay parade.jpg|thumb|Gay Pride Parade in New York City, 2008]]\nMany parades still have at least some of the original political or [[activism|activist]] character, especially in less accepting settings. The variation is largely dependent upon the political, economic, and religious settings of the area. However, in more accepting cities, the parades take on a festive or even [[Mardi Gras]]-like character, whereby the political stage is built on notions of celebration. Large parades often involve floats, dancers, [[drag queen]]s and amplified music; but even such celebratory parades usually include political and educational contingents, such as local politicians and marching groups from LGBT institutions of various kinds. Other typical parade participants include local LGBT-friendly churches such as [[Metropolitan Community Church]]es, [[United Church of Christ]], and [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian Universalist]] Churches, [[PFLAG]], and LGBT employee associations from large businesses.\n\nEven the most festive parades usually offer some aspect dedicated to remembering victims of [[AIDS]] and anti-LGBT violence. Some particularly important pride parades are funded by governments and [[corporate sponsorship|corporate sponsors]] and promoted as major [[tourist attraction]]s for the cities that host them. In some countries, some pride parades are now also called Pride Festivals. Some of these festivals provide a carnival-like atmosphere in a nearby park or city-provided closed-off street, with information booths, music concerts, barbecues, beer stands, contests, sports, and games. The 'dividing line' between onlookers and those marching in the parade can be hard to establish in some events, however, in cases where the event is received with hostility, such a separation becomes very obvious. There have been studies considering how the relationship between participants and onlookers is affected by the divide, and how space is used to critique the heteronormative nature of society.\n\nThough the reality was that the Stonewall riots themselves, as well as the immediate and the ongoing political organizing that occurred following them, were events fully participated in by lesbian women, bisexual people, and transgender people, as well as by gay men of all races and backgrounds, historically these events were first named ''Gay'', the word at that time being used in a more generic sense to cover the entire spectrum of what is now variously called the 'queer' or LGBT community.<ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary for Sylvia Rae Rivera|url=http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|publisher=Sylvia's Place|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928113130/http://www.sylviasplace.org/sylvia_obituary.htm|archivedate=September 28, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gender.org/remember/people/marshajohnson.html |title=Marsha P.

The language has become more accurate and inclusive, though these changes met with initial resistance from some in their own communities who were unaware of the historical events.<ref>[http://www.nyabn.org/Pages/WhoWeR/OurHistory.html New York Area Bisexual Network: A Brief History of NYC's Bisexual Community].

At Quezon City Memorial Circle, a program was held with a Queer Pride Mass and solidarity remarks from various organizations and individuals.\n\nIn 1995 MCC, ProGay Philippines and other organizations held internal celebrations. In 1996, 1997 and 1998 large and significant marches were organized and produced by Reachout AIDS Foundation, all of which were held in Malate, Manila, Philippines. In 1998, the year of the centennial commemoration of the Republic of the Philippines, a Gay and Lesbian Pride March was incorporated in the mammoth \"citizens' parade\" which was part of the official centennial celebration. That parade culminated in \"marching by\" the President of the Philippines, His Excellency Joseph Estrada, at the Quirino Grandstand in Luneta Park in Manila.\n\nIn 1999, Task Force Pride Philippines (TFP), a network of LGBT and LGBT-friendly groups and individuals seeking to promote positive visibility for the LGBT community was born. Since then, TFP has been organizing the annual Metro Manila Pride March. In 2003, a decision was made to move the Pride March from June to the December Human Rights Week to coincide with related human rights activities such as World AIDS Day (December 1), Philippine National Lesbian Day (December 8), and International Human Rights Day (December 10).\n\nOn December 10, 2005, the First LGBT Freedom March, with the theme \"CPR: Celebrating Pride and Rights\" was held along the streets of Espa\u00f1a and Quiapo in Manila, Philippines. Concerned that the prevailing economic and political crisis in the country at the time presented threats to freedoms and liberties of all Filipinos, including sexual and gender minorities, LGBT individuals and groups, non-government organizations and members of various communities and sectors organized the LGBT Freedom March calling for systemic and structural change. At historic Plaza Miranda, in front of Quiapo Church, despite the pouring rain, a program with performances and speeches depicting LGBT pride was held soon after the march.\nOn December 6, 2014, Philippines will be celebrating the 20th anniversary of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20150709154531/http://metromanilapride.org/ Metro Manila Pride] March with the theme: Come Out For Love ''Kasi Pag-ibig Pa Rin'' (Come Out For Love Because It's Still All About Love). The theme is a reminder of the love and passion that started and sustained 20 years of taking to the streets for the recognition and respect of LGBT lives as human lives. It is also a celebration of and an invitation for families, friends, and supporters of LGBT people to claim Metro Manila Pride as a safe space to voice their support for the community, for the LGBT human rights advocacy, and for the people they love and march with every year.\n\nThe 21st Metro Manila Pride March in 2015, entitled Fight For Love, was held on the 25th of July.

Out of all ex-[[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] states, at that time only [[Slovenia]] and [[Croatia]] had a tradition of organising Pride events, whereas the attempt to organize such an event in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] in 2001, ended in a bloody showdown between the police and the counter-protesters, with the participants heavily beaten up. This manifestation was held in [[Zagreb]], [[Croatia]] from June 22\u201325, 2006 and brought together representatives of those Eastern European and [[Balkans|Southeastern European]] countries where the sociopolitical climate is not ripe for the organization of Prides, or where such a manifestation is expressly forbidden by the authorities. From 13 countries that participated, only [[Poland]], [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], [[Romania]] and [[Latvia]] have been organizing Prides. [[Slovakia]] also hosted the pride, but encountered many problems with Slovak extremists from [[Slovenska pospolitost]] (the pride did not cross the centre of the city). [[Republic of Macedonia|North Macedonia]] and [[Albania]] also host Pride Parades with no major issues arising, mainly due to the protection from police. [[Lithuania]] has never had Prides before. There were also representatives from [[Kosovo]], that participated apart from Serbia. It was the very first Pride organized jointly with other states and nations, which only ten years ago have been at war with each other. Weak cultural, political and social cooperation exists among these states, with an obvious lack of public encouragement for solidarity, which organizers hoped to initiate through that regional Pride event. The host and the initiator of The Internationale LGBT Pride was [[Zagreb Pride]], which has been held since 2002.\n\n====Bosnia and Herzegovina====\nThe first Pride parade in Bosnia and Herzegovina was held on 8 September 2019 in Sarajevo under the slogan ''Ima Iza\u0107' '' (Coming Out).

Although homosexuality was decriminalized in 1968, people with different sexual orientations and identities are still not well accepted in society. In 2003 the country enacted several laws protecting the [[LGBT]] community and individuals from discrimination. In 2008, Bulgaria organized its first ever pride parade. The almost 200 people who had gathered were attacked by [[skinhead]]s, but police managed to prevent any injuries. The 2009 pride parade, with the motto \"Rainbow Friendship\" attracted more than 300 participants from [[Bulgaria]] and tourists from [[Greece]] and [[UK|Great Britain]].

The focal point is the [[City Hall Square, Copenhagen|City Hall Square]] in the city centre.

The event was attended by about forty people belonging to various homophile groups, including ones from France, Belgium, Great Britain's Gay Liberation Front, and Italy's activist homosexual rights group ''{{ill|Fuori!|it}}''.<ref name=\"Barilli-1999\">{{cite book |language=Italian |last1=Rossi Barilli |first1=Gianni |title=Il movimento gay in Italia |trans-title=The Gay Movement in Italy |url=https://books.google.com/?id=2cJ1zT70ucwC |publisher=[[Feltrinelli (publisher)|Feltrinelli]] |location=Milano |year=1999 |isbn=88-07-81559-1 |oclc=801192305 |series=Universale economica}}</ref>{{rp|54\u201359}}\n\nThe first Italian event specifically associated with international celebrations of Gay Pride was the sixth congress of ''Fuori!'' held in [[Turin]] in late June 1978 and included a week of films on gay subjects.<ref name=\"Barilli-1999\"/>{{rp|103}}  Episodes of violence against homosexuals were frequent in Italy, such as in the summer of 1979 when two young gay men were killed in [[Livorno]]. In [[Pisa]] in November of that year, the {{ill|Orfeo Collective|it|Collettivo Omosessuale Orfeo}} organized the first march against anti-gay violence.  Around 500 gay and lesbian participants attended, and this remained the largest gathering of the kind until 1994.<ref name=\"Barilli-1999\"/>{{rp|122\u2013124}}\n\nLater, a system of \"national Pride\" observances designated one city to hold the official events, starting with Rome in 1994. Starting in 2013, the organization Onda Pride organized additional events, and in 2017 events were organized in 24 cities nationwide under its auspices.\n\n====Latvia====\n{{Main|Riga Pride and Friendship Days}}\n\nOn July 22, 2005, the first Latvian gay pride march took place in [[Riga]], surrounded by protesters. It had previously been banned by the [[Riga City Council]], and the then-[[Prime Minister of Latvia]], [[Aigars Kalv\u012btis]], opposed the event, stating Riga should \"not promote things like that\", however a court decision allowed the march to go ahead.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4708617.stm | work=BBC News | title=Latvia gay pride given go-ahead | date=July 22, 2005 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> In 2006, LGBT people in Latvia attempted a Parade but were assaulted by \"No Pride\" protesters, an incident sparking a storm of international media pressure and protests from the European Parliament at the failure of the Latvian authorities to adequately protect the Parade so that it could proceed.\n\nIn 2007, following international pressure, a Pride Parade was held once again in Riga with 4,500 people parading around [[V\u0113rmane Garden]], protected physically from \"No Pride\" protesters by 1,500 [[State Police (Latvia)|Latvian police]], with ringing the inside and the outside of the iron railings of the park. Two fire crackers were detonated with one being thrown from outside at the end of the festival as participants were moving off to the buses.

Participants included [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]], [[Amnesty International]] observers and random individuals who travelled from abroad to support LGBT Latvians and their friends and families.\n\nIn 2008, the Riga Pride was held in the historically potent 11. novembra krastmala (November 11 [[Bank (geography)|Embankment]]) beneath the [[Riga Castle]]. The participants heard speeches from MEPs and a message of support from the [[President of Latvia|Latvian President]]. The embankment was not open and was isolated from the public with some participants having trouble getting past police cordons. About 300 ''No Pride'' protesters gathered on the bridges behind barricades erected by the police who kept Pride participants and the \"No Pride\" protesters separated. Participants were once more \"bused\" out but this time a 5-minute journey to central Riga.\n\nIn 2009, the annual Baltic Pride was launched, with the first edition being held in Riga with a march. This event and the following ones have been held without serious incidents.\n\nThe 2012 Baltic Pride was held on June 2nd. The parade marched through T\u0113rbatas street from the corner of \u0122ertr\u016bdes street towards V\u0113rmane Garden, where concerts and a conference were held.

The very first Gay Pride Parade in Madrid was held in June 1979 nearly four years after the death of Spain's dictator [[Francisco Franco]], with the gradual arrival of democracy and the de-criminalization of homosexuality. Since then, dozens of companies like [[Microsoft]], [[Google]] and [[Schweppes]] and several political parties and trade unions, including [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]], [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|PODEMOS]], [[United Left (Spain)|United Left]], [[Union, Progress and Democracy]], [[CCOO]] and [[Uni\u00f3n General de Trabajadores|UGT]] have been sponsoring and supporting the parade. Madrid Pride Parade is the biggest gay demonstration in Europe, with more than 1.5 million attendees in 2009, according to the [[Spanish government]].\n\nIn 2007, [[Europride]], the European Pride Parade, took place in [[Madrid]]. About 2.5 million people attended more than 300 events over one week in the Spanish capital to celebrate Spain as the country with the most developed LGBT rights in the world. Independent media estimated that more than 200,000 visitors came from foreign countries to join in the festivities. Madrid gay district [[Chueca]], the biggest gay district in Europe, was the centre of the celebrations. The event was supported by the city, regional and national government and private sector which also ensured that the event was financially successful. [[Barcelona]], [[Valencia]] and [[Seville]] hold also local Pride Parades. In 2008 [[Barcelona]] hosted the [[EuroGames (LGBT sporting event)|Eurogames]].\n\nIn 2014, Winter Pride Maspalomas was held for the first time at [[Maspalomas]], [[Gran Canaria, Canary Islands]], one of one Europe's most popular LGTB tourist destinations.

The march is the event's main activity and the one that draws the biggest attention to the press, the Brazilian authorities, and the hundreds of thousands of curious people that line themselves along the parade's route. In 2009, 3.2 million people attended the 13th annual Gay Pride Parade.\n\nThe second biggest Pride Parade in Brazil is [[Rio de Janeiro]] Gay Pride Parade, numbering about 2 million people, traditionally taking place in [[Zona Sul]] or Rio's most affluent neighborhoods between the city center and the world-famous oceanic beaches, which usually happens in the second part of the year, when it is winter or spring in the [[Southern Hemisphere]], generally characterizing milder weather for Rio de Janeiro (about 15[[Celsius|\u00b0C]] in difference), except for occasional stormy cold fronts. The Rio de Janeiro Gay Pride Parade and its associated events are organized by the NGO Arco-\u00cdris ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''rainbow''). The group is one of the founders of the [[Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Gays, L\u00e9sbicas, Bissexuais, Travestis e Transexuais]] (Brazilian Association of Gays, Lesbians, Bisexuals, Transvestites (this word used as a synonym for transgender persons in Brazil) and Transsexuals). Other Pride Parades which happen in [[Greater Rio de Janeiro]] take place in [[Niter\u00f3i]], Rio de Janeiro's ex-capital in the times when Rio was the Brazilian capital and a separated [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]], and [[Nova Igua\u00e7u]], where about 800,000 persons live and is located in the center of [[Baixada Fluminense]], which compose all northern suburban cities of Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area numbering 3.5 million people.\n\nOther [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeastern Brazilian]] parades are held in [[Cabo Frio]] ([[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]]), [[Campinas]] ([[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]), [[Vit\u00f3ria, Esp\u00edrito Santo|Vit\u00f3ria]] (capital of [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]]), and [[Belo Horizonte]] and [[Uberaba]] ([[Minas Gerais]]). [[South Region, Brazil|Southern Brazilian]] parades take place in [[Curitiba]], [[Florian\u00f3polis]], [[Porto Alegre]] and [[Pelotas]], and [[Center-West Region, Brazil|Center-Western]] ones happen in [[Campo Grande]], [[Cuiab\u00e1]], [[Goi\u00e2nia]] and [[Bras\u00edlia]]. Across [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]], they are present in all capitals, namely, in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Aracaju]], [[Macei\u00f3]], [[Recife]], [[Jo\u00e3o Pessoa, Para\u00edba|Jo\u00e3o Pessoa]], [[Natal, Rio Grande do Norte|Natal]], [[Fortaleza]], [[Teresina]] and [[S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, Maranh\u00e3o|S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds]], and also in [[Cear\u00e1]]'s [[Sert\u00e3o|hinterland]] major urban center, [[Juazeiro do Norte]]. [[North Region, Brazil|Northern Brazilian]] parades are those from [[Bel\u00e9m]], [[Macap\u00e1]], [[Boa Vista, Roraima|Boa Vista]] and [[Manaus]].\n\n==== Guyana ====\nGuyana held its first pride parade in June 2018.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite web|url=http://demerarawaves.com/2018/06/02/virtually-incident-free-gay-pride-parade-held-in-guyana-to-demand-election-promises/|title=Virtually incident-free gay pride parade held in Guyana to demand election promises|last=Chabrol|first=Denis|date=2018-06-03|website=Demerara Waves|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-30}}</ref> It was the first in the Anglo-phone Caribbean and was successfully staged in spite of religious opposition.\n\n==Opposition==\n\n<nowiki/><nowiki/>{{More citations needed|section|date=November 2017}}\n[[File:SF Pride Drag Queens.jpg|thumb|A festive float with costumed dancers at [[San Francisco Pride]] 2005]]\nThere is opposition to pride events both within LGBT and mainstream populations.\n\nCritics, such as [[Gay Shame]], charge the parades with an undue emphasis on sex and [[sexual fetish|fetish-related]] interests, which they see as counterproductive to LGBT interests, and expose the \"gay community\" to ridicule. LGBT activists{{Who|date=July 2010}} counter that traditional media have played a role in emphasizing the most outlandish and therefore non-representative aspects of the community. This in turn has prompted participants to engage in more flamboyant costumes to gain media coverage.\n\nVarious critics have denounced what they view as a ''[[merchandization]]'' of Pride parades.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://blogs.publico.es/shangaylily/2014/07/02/gaypitalismo-orgullo-empresarial/ Gaypitalismo: Orgullo Empresarial.] P\u00fablico. 2 July 2014</ref><ref>{{in lang|es}} [https://www.diagonalperiodico.net/cuerpo/27129-mercadeo-rosa-para-la-amnesia-del-movimiento.html Mercadeo rosa para la amnesia del movimiento.] Diagonal Peri\u00f3dico. 2 July 2015</ref><ref>[https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2016/06/28/lgbt-night-march-decries-prides-corporate-sponsorship.html LGBT Night March decries Pride\u2019s corporate sponsorship.] The Star. 28 June 2016</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jun/25/san-francisco-gay-pride-corporate-orlando-shooting Too straight, white and corporate: why some queer people are skipping SF Pride.] The Guardian. 25 June 2016</ref>\n\n[[Socially conservative|Social conservatives]] are sometimes opposed to such events because they view them to be contrary to public morality. This belief is partly based on certain displays often found in the parades, such as public nudity, [[BDSM]] paraphernalia, and other sexualized features. Within the academic community, there has been criticism that the parades actually set to strengthen homosexual-heterosexual divides and increase essentialist views.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|LGBT}}\n{{Commons category|LGBT Pride}}\n* [[Disability Pride Parades]]\n* [[Dyke March]]\n* [[National pride]]\n* [[Peace flag]]\n* [[Rainbow flag (gay movement)|Gay pride flag]]\n* [[Straight pride]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n# Bell, David (1991).

Because the Russian-made Kornet is an accurate, laser-guided weapon, it appeared that the bus was intentionally targeted. The attackers were never apprehended.

Israel said the yellow color of the bus made it easily identifiable and accused Hamas of \"crossing a line. The missile hit the bus after all but one of the children had been dropped off.
