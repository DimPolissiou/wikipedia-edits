The film stars [[Lou Diamond Phillips]] as Valens, [[Esai Morales]], [[Rosanna DeSoto]], [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]], [[Danielle von Zerneck]], and [[Joe Pantoliano]]. The film depicts the impact Valens's career had on the lives of his half-brother Bob Morales, his girlfriend Donna Ludwig and the rest of his family.\n\nIn 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the  [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-178/|title=2017 National Film Registry Is More Than a 'Field of Dreams'|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|last=Cannady|first=Sheryl|date=December 13, 2017|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nRichard Steven Valenzuela is a normal teenage boy who becomes a [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] superstar under the stage name Ritchie Valens. He meets and falls in love with high school classmate Donna Ludwig, for whom he writes a song that becomes a number two hit, ([[Donna (Ritchie Valens song)|\"Donna\"]]). However, Donna's father has issues with his daughter dating a [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]], which causes friction between Ritchie and Donna. Ritchie's relationship with his mother Connie and half-brother Bob Morales, and the jealousy Bob feels toward Ritchie's success, are also depicted.\n\nBob wins an important art contest that helps promising [[cartoonist]]s, only to throw away his prize because, in his mind, his mother does not care enough. Bob resorts to drinking heavily and, at one point, yells in a drunken rage in front of his mother's door, \"I want to see my daughter!\" in reference to the child he sired with Ritchie's first girlfriend Rosie. However, when they get an opportunity, Ritchie and Bob sneak out for a good time. On one occasion, they take a road trip to [[Tijuana]], visiting one of the local clubs where Ritchie discovers what will become his [[List of signature songs|signature song]], \"[[La Bamba (song)|La Bamba]]\".\n\nRitchie has a [[fear of flying]], triggered by a recurring dream resulting from [[1957 Pacoima mid-air collision|a midair collision between two planes over Ritchie's school]] which killed his best friend. Ritchie initially manages to avoid flying to his concerts and appearances, but has to conquer his fear when invited to perform \"Donna\" on ''[[American Bandstand]]''. Ritchie's record producer and manager, [[Bob Keane]], helps him by giving him a little [[vodka]] to calm his nerves during the flight to [[Philadelphia]].\n\nAs Ritchie becomes more famous, his responsibilities change, and he eventually joins the ill-fated [[The Day the Music Died|Winter Dance Party]] tour with [[Buddy Holly]] and \"[[The Big Bopper]]\" after \"La Bamba\" and \"Donna\" reach the top of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts. Ritchie, Holly, and Bopper take off in an airplane during a snowstorm for their fateful flight on [[The Day the Music Died|February 3, 1959]]. Before the flight, Ritchie makes a call to his brother, wherein they patch up their differences. He even invites Bob to fly out to [[Chicago]] to join the tour for family support.\n\nThe next day, while Bob is fixing his mother's car, he hears the news bulletin on the radio that his brother's plane crashed without any survivors. Bob darts out of his driveway in an attempt to get to his mother before she hears the news, only to find her standing immobile. The news of Ritchie's death hits the Valenzuela family, Bob, Rosie, and Donna very hard. After Ritchie's funeral at [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]], Bob walks across a bridge and screams out Ritchie's name, remembering the good times they had together, accompanied by the [[Santo & Johnny]] instrumental \"[[Sleep Walk]]\".\n\nDuring the end credits, [[Lou Diamond Phillips]], as Ritchie, is shown in footage from an earlier scene performing Valens's version of \"[[La Bamba (song)|La Bamba]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Lou Diamond Phillips]] as [[Ritchie Valens]]\n*[[Esai Morales]] as Roberto \"Bob\" Morales (Ritchie's half-brother)\n*[[Rosanna DeSoto]] as Connie Reyes (Ritchie's mother)\n*[[Danielle von Zerneck]] as Donna Ludwig\n*[[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]] as Rosie Morales\n*[[Joe Pantoliano]] as [[Bob Keane]]\n*[[Rick Dees]] as [[Ted Quillin]]\n*[[Marshall Crenshaw]] as [[Buddy Holly]]\n*[[Howard Huntsberry]] as [[Jackie Wilson]]\n*[[Brian Setzer]] as [[Eddie Cochran]]\n*[[Stephen Lee (actor)|Stephen Lee]] as [[The Big Bopper]]\n*[[Sam Anderson]] as Mr. Ludwig (Donna's father)\n\nAlso featured are several members of the Valenzuela family and director Luis Valdez's family, including:\n*Concepcion Reyes (the real Connie Reyes, Ritchie's mother) as the elderly woman sitting next to Lou Diamond Phillips (as Ritchie) at a party\n*[[Daniel Valdez]] (Luis' brother) as Ritchie's Uncle Lelo\n*Katie Valdez (Luis' daughter) as Ritchie's sister Connie Jr.\n\n==Distribution==\n''La Bamba'' opened in wide release in the United States on July 24, 1987.

The film stars [[Lou Diamond Phillips]] as Valens, [[Esai Morales]], [[Rosanna DeSoto]], [[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]], [[Danielle von Zerneck]], and [[Joe Pantoliano]]. The film depicts the impact Valens's career had on the lives of his half-brother Bob Morales, his girlfriend Donna Ludwig and the rest of his family.\n\nIn 2017, the film was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the  [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-17-178/|title=2017 National Film Registry Is More Than a 'Field of Dreams'|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|last=Cannady|first=Sheryl|date=December 13, 2017|accessdate=December 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nRichard Steven Valenzuela is a normal teenage boy who becomes a [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] superstar under the stage name Ritchie Valens. He meets and falls in love with high school classmate Donna Ludwig, for whom he writes a song that becomes a number two hit, ([[Donna (Ritchie Valens song)|\"Donna\"]]). However, Donna's father has issues with his daughter dating a [[Mexican Americans|Mexican-American]], which causes friction between Ritchie and Donna. Ritchie's relationship with his mother Connie and half-brother Bob Morales, and the jealousy Bob feels toward Ritchie's success, are also depicted.\n\nBob wins an important art contest that helps promising [[cartoonist]]s, only to throw away his prize because, in his mind, his mother does not care enough. Bob resorts to drinking heavily and, at one point, yells in a drunken rage in front of his mother's door, \"I want to see my daughter!\" in reference to the child he sired with Ritchie's first girlfriend Rosie. However, when they get an opportunity, Ritchie and Bob sneak out for a good time. On one occasion, they take a road trip to [[Tijuana]], visiting one of the local clubs where Ritchie discovers what will become his [[List of signature songs|signature song]], \"[[La Bamba (song)|La Bamba]]\".\n\nRitchie has a [[fear of flying]], triggered by a recurring dream resulting from [[1957 Pacoima mid-air collision|a midair collision between two planes over Ritchie's school]] which killed his best friend. Ritchie initially manages to avoid flying to his concerts and appearances, but has to conquer his fear when invited to perform \"Donna\" on ''[[American Bandstand]]''. Ritchie's record producer and manager, [[Bob Keane]], helps him by giving him a little [[vodka]] to calm his nerves during the flight to [[Philadelphia]].\n\nAs Ritchie becomes more famous, his responsibilities change, and he eventually joins the ill-fated [[The Day the Music Died|Winter Dance Party]] tour with [[Buddy Holly]] and \"[[The Big Bopper]]\" after \"La Bamba\" and \"Donna\" reach the top of the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts. Ritchie, Holly, and Bopper take off in an airplane during a snowstorm for their fateful flight on [[The Day the Music Died|February 3, 1959]]. Before the flight, Ritchie makes a call to his brother, wherein they patch up their differences. He even invites Bob to fly out to [[Chicago]] to join the tour for family support.\n\nThe next day, while Bob is fixing his mother's car, he hears the news bulletin on the radio that his brother's plane crashed without any survivors. Bob darts out of his driveway in an attempt to get to his mother before she hears the news, only to find her standing immobile. The news of Ritchie's death hits the Valenzuela family, Bob, Rosie, and Donna very hard. After Ritchie's funeral at [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]], Bob walks across a bridge and screams out Ritchie's name, remembering the good times they had together, accompanied by the [[Santo & Johnny]] instrumental \"[[Sleep Walk]]\".\n\nDuring the end credits, [[Lou Diamond Phillips]], as Ritchie, is shown in footage from an earlier scene performing Valens's version of \"[[La Bamba (song)|La Bamba]]\".\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Lou Diamond Phillips]] as [[Ritchie Valens]]\n*[[Esai Morales]] as Roberto \"Bob\" Morales (Ritchie's half-brother)\n*[[Rosanna DeSoto]] as Connie Reyes (Ritchie's mother)\n*[[Danielle von Zerneck]] as Donna Ludwig\n*[[Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a]] as Rosie Morales\n*[[Joe Pantoliano]] as [[Bob Keane]]\n*[[Rick Dees]] as [[Ted Quillin]]\n*[[Marshall Crenshaw]] as [[Buddy Holly]]\n*[[Howard Huntsberry]] as [[Jackie Wilson]]\n*[[Brian Setzer]] as [[Eddie Cochran]]\n*[[Stephen Lee (actor)|Stephen Lee]] as [[The Big Bopper]]\n*[[Sam Anderson]] as Mr. Ludwig (Donna's father)\n\nAlso featured are several members of the Valenzuela family and director Luis Valdez's family, including:\n*Concepcion Reyes (the real Connie Reyes, Ritchie's mother) as the elderly woman sitting next to Lou Diamond Phillips (as Ritchie) at a party\n*[[Daniel Valdez]] (Luis' brother) as Ritchie's Uncle Lelo\n*Katie Valdez (Luis' daughter) as Ritchie's sister Connie Jr.\n\n==Distribution==\n''La Bamba'' opened in wide release in the United States on July 24, 1987.

This law required Williams, in his role as United States Attorney, to oversee the capture of runaway slaves and their return to their owners in the South. Williams was opposed to slavery personally but, in the 1850s, acknowledged the right of slave owners in the South to keep their slaves. He fully discharged his duties under the Fugitive Slave Act.<ref>''Quincy (Illinois) Whig,'' October 29, 1850; February 4, 1851; and September 18, 1852; quoted in Dennis J.

Williams and Lincoln became good friends and both subsequently joined the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. Lincoln was said to have seen Williams as a great \"reasoner.\" The two men were described as \"sitting next to each other in the southeast corner of the statehouse.\" It was noted: \"Lincoln did not hesitate to consult Williams at all times, and the two men were often associated in legal work.\"<ref>Carl Landrum, \"From Quincy's past: Archibald Williams, early lawyer,\" ''Quincy (Illinois) Herald-Whig'', December 5, 1971.</ref>\n\nWilliams ran for the [[United States Senate]] as a Whig in 1836 and in 1842.

Although opposed to slavery, both men believed Southerners should be allowed to keep their slaves but also should be urged to free their slaves voluntarily and return them to Africa. This was thought to be a reasonable and non-coercive solution to the slavery problem.<ref>''Sangamo Journal'', January 23, 1845, quoted in Maurice J. Baxter, ''Orville H.

A problem developed when Orville H. Browning, a Whig Party leader in Quincy supported the nomination of past Whig Party favorite Henry Clay. On April 30, 1848, Lincoln wrote a letter to Williams urging him to support Zachary Taylor and, if possible, also enlist the support of Browning.<ref>\"Valuable Lincoln Letter Treasured by Quincyan; Was Written to Judge Archibald Williams in 1848; Mrs. Walter D.

He might get New\nYork, and that would have elected in 1844 but it will not now; because he must now at the\nleast, have Tennessee, which he had then and, in addition, the fifteen new votes of Florida, Texas, Iowa, and Wisconsin. I know that our good friend Browning is a great admirer of Mr. Clay, and I therefore fear he is favoring his nomination. If he is, ask him to discard feeling, and try if he can possibly, as a matter of judgement, count the votes necessary to elect him.\n\nIn my judgment, we can elect nobody but Gen. Taylor, and we cannot elect him without a nomination - Therefore don't fail to send a delegation -\n\nYour friend as ever,\n\nA. Lincoln\n</blockquote>\n\nThis letter demonstrates the close friendship and easygoing familiarity between Lincoln and Williams.

H. Roberts, ''History of the Church'' (Latter-Day Saints), Volume 4, p. 367.</ref> Joseph Smith was the founder of the Church of Latter Day Saints (Mormons), and he and his church were unpopular because of the voting power of his supporters and their belief in men having multiple wives. Thanks to Browning's and Williams's arguments in court, Smith was not extradited to Missouri but remained in Illinois and founded a Mormon colony at [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], Illinois.\n\nFour years later, in 1844, Smith and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] were murdered by a mob while incarcerated in the jail at [[Carthage, Illinois|Carthage]], Illinois. Williams and Browning switched sides and helped to defend in court the accused murderers of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. The defendants were all found not-guilty.<ref>Dallin H. Oaks and Marvin S.

The convention met in the state capitol in Springfield and proceeded to write an improved state constitution. Williams was elected in a Democratic district against a Democratic candidate.<ref>\"Hon. Archibald Williams, Quincy,\" in ''United States Biographical Dictionary and Portrait Gallery'' (Chicago, IL: American Biographical Publishing Company, 1876), Illinois Volume, p. 152.</ref> Although the Democrats had a majority of the delegates to the convention, the Whigs could break away Democratic votes when they needed them and ended up dominating the convention.

It took two days for him to travel by railroad and stagecoach to Quincy. In a letter to a friend and political ally, Lincoln wrote: \"I am here now going to Quincy, to try to give Mr. [Archibald] Williams a little life.\"<ref>Abraham Lincoln to Richard Yates, October 30, 1854, in Roy P.

After 1854, Williams and Lincoln and other anti-Nebraskans took the lead in forming the Republican Party in Illinois around the issue of \"no slavery in the territories.\"\n\nLincoln wrote a letter in which he said he was ready to \"fuse\" with other anti-slavery groups according to \"principles\" adopted at a public meeting in Quincy. The purpose of fusion was to bring many disparate anti-slavery groups together to form the Republican Party.

Orville Browning, Williams's good friend from Quincy, Illinois, was the opposing lawyer. The issue in dispute dealt with rival claims for lands and centered on whether the question of \"bad faith\" in the matter should be decided by a judge or by a jury. The Court ruled in ''Wright v. Mattison''<ref>''Wright v. Mattison,'' 59 US 50(1855).</ref> that \"bad faith\" should not be decided by the judge but by the jury, which had been the precedent.

Later in his legislative career, he labeled the Illinois Internal Improvements program \"Infernal Improvements\" due to its financial difficulties leading to bankruptcy.<ref>Letter, Archibald Williams to Henry Asbury, December 27, 1839, Henry Asbury File, Quincy Historical Society, Quincy, Illinois.</ref>\n\n===Service as United States Attorney and Fugitive Slave Act===\n\nAs the United States Attorney for Illinois, it was Williams's job to prosecute cases in the United States District Court. The job became more difficult for Williams in 1850 when Congress enacted the [[Compromise of 1850]], which included a new [[Fugitive Slave Law]]. This law required Williams, in his role as United States Attorney, to oversee the capture of runaway slaves and their return to their owners in the South. Williams was opposed to slavery personally but, in the 1850s, acknowledged the right of slave owners in the South to keep their slaves. He fully discharged his duties under the Fugitive Slave Act.<ref>''Quincy (Illinois) Whig,'' October 29, 1850; February 4, 1851; and September 18, 1852; quoted in Dennis J.

Pease and James G. Randall, ''The Diary of Orville Hickman Browning'' (Springfield, IL: 1925 and 1933), Volume I, p. 547.</ref>\n\n==Relationship with Lincoln==\n\nLincoln was elected to the state legislature in 1834. Williams and Lincoln became good friends and both subsequently joined the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]]. Lincoln was said to have seen Williams as a great \"reasoner.\" The two men were described as \"sitting next to each other in the southeast corner of the statehouse.\" It was noted: \"Lincoln did not hesitate to consult Williams at all times, and the two men were often associated in legal work.\"<ref>Carl Landrum, \"From Quincy's past: Archibald Williams, early lawyer,\" ''Quincy (Illinois) Herald-Whig'', December 5, 1971.</ref>\n\nWilliams ran for the [[United States Senate]] as a Whig in 1836 and in 1842. At those times the selection of [[United States Senator]]s was made by both houses of the state legislature. Lincoln voted for Williams the first time he ran for United States Senator in 1836.<ref>Paul Simon, ''Lincoln's Preparation for Greatness: The Illinois Legislative Years'' (Norman, OK: University of Oklahoma Press, 1965), p. 54. Also see Carl Sandburg, ''Abraham Lincoln: The Prairie Years and the War Years - One Volume Edition'' (New York, NY: Harcourt, Brace & World, 1954), p. 51.</ref> The second time Williams ran, in 1842, Lincoln was no longer in the state legislature and thus could not vote for his friend. In both instances, Williams was not elected.\n\nLincoln was admitted to practice law in the [[United States Circuit Court]] on December 3, 1839. United States District Judge [[Nathaniel Pope]] presided over the ceremony. A Quincy newspaper noted that Williams was present at the ceremony.<ref>''Quincy (Illinois) Whig'', December 14, 1839, quoted in Earl Schenck Myers, Ed., ''Lincoln Day by Day - A Chronology, 1809-1865'' (Dayton, OH: Morningside, 1991).</ref>\n\nWilliams presided over a Whig Party state convention meeting in Springfield, Illinois, in 1843.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Lincoln attended the convention and was elected a Whig Party presidential elector for the 1844 presidential election.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Unfortunately for the Whigs, Democrat [[James K. Polk]] of Tennessee won the presidential election.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nIn June 1844, Williams was elected president of an Illinois state Whig Party convention in [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]], Illinois. Lincoln spoke to the convention in support of the United States charging higher tariffs on imported goods, a major Whig position at the time.<ref>Website: MrLincolnAndFriends.org., click on Politicians, click on Archibald Williams.</ref>\n\nAlong with Lincoln, Williams in the 1840s supported the African colonization of freed slaves by joining the Illinois colonization society. Although opposed to slavery, both men believed Southerners should be allowed to keep their slaves but also should be urged to free their slaves voluntarily and return them to Africa. This was thought to be a reasonable and non-coercive solution to the slavery problem.<ref>''Sangamo Journal'', January 23, 1845, quoted in Maurice J. Baxter, ''Orville H. Browning: Lincoln's Friend and Critic'' (Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press, 1957) p. 66-67.</ref>\n\n===1848 election===\n\nIn the 1848 presidential election, Lincoln was backing General [[Zachary Taylor]], a [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican War]] hero, for the Whig Party nomination. A problem developed when Orville H. Browning, a Whig Party leader in Quincy supported the nomination of past Whig Party favorite Henry Clay. On April 30, 1848, Lincoln wrote a letter to Williams urging him to support Zachary Taylor and, if possible, also enlist the support of Browning.<ref>\"Valuable Lincoln Letter Treasured by Quincyan; Was Written to Judge Archibald Williams in 1848; Mrs. Walter D. Franklin Prizes Highly Note Written by Emancipator,\" ''Quincy (Illinois) Herald-Whig,'' February 20, 1947.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nWashington, April 30, 1848\n\nDear Williams,\n\nI have not seen in the papers any evidence of a movement to send a delegate from your circuit to the June convention - I wish to say that I think it all important that a delegate should be sent - Mr. Clay's chance for election is just no chance at all. He might get New\nYork, and that would have elected in 1844 but it will not now; because he must now at the\nleast, have Tennessee, which he had then and, in addition, the fifteen new votes of Florida, Texas, Iowa, and Wisconsin. I know that our good friend Browning is a great admirer of Mr. Clay, and I therefore fear he is favoring his nomination. If he is, ask him to discard feeling, and try if he can possibly, as a matter of judgement, count the votes necessary to elect him.\n\nIn my judgment, we can elect nobody but Gen. Taylor, and we cannot elect him without a nomination - Therefore don't fail to send a delegation -\n\nYour friend as ever,\n\nA. Lincoln\n</blockquote>\n\nThis letter demonstrates the close friendship and easygoing familiarity between Lincoln and Williams. It also reveals Lincoln's developing skills as an up-and-coming Illinois politician. It is not known whether Williams prevailed on Orville Browning to support Zachary Taylor for the Whig nomination for president in 1848.<ref>Norma Lorene Johnston, \"Lincoln's Relationships with Four Quincy Republicans,\" Masters Thesis, University of Wisconsin, 1955, p. 23.</ref>\n\nOnce in the White House in Washington, D.C., newly elected President Zachary Taylor appointed Williams the United States District Attorney for the state of Illinois. Lincoln had sent the following letter in support of Williams's nomination:\n\n<blockquote>\nWashington, March 8, 1849\n\nHon: [[John M. Clayton]]\n\nSecretary of State\n\nDear Sir:\n\nWe Recommend that Archibald Williams, of Quincy, Illinois, be appointed U.S. District Attorney for the District of Illinois, when that office shall become vacant.\n\nYour Obt.

Basler, ''Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln'' (Springfield, IL: 1953), Volume 2, p. 39.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==The Mormon Problem in Illinois==\n\nJoining with his friend and fellow Quincy lawyer [[Orville Browning]], Williams in 1841 helped to defend Mormon leader [[Joseph Smith]] from being extradited to Missouri to face possible execution for alleged crimes.<ref>B. H. Roberts, ''History of the Church'' (Latter-Day Saints), Volume 4, p. 367.</ref> Joseph Smith was the founder of the Church of Latter Day Saints (Mormons), and he and his church were unpopular because of the voting power of his supporters and their belief in men having multiple wives. Thanks to Browning's and Williams's arguments in court, Smith was not extradited to Missouri but remained in Illinois and founded a Mormon colony at [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], Illinois.\n\nFour years later, in 1844, Smith and his brother [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] were murdered by a mob while incarcerated in the jail at [[Carthage, Illinois|Carthage]], Illinois. Williams and Browning switched sides and helped to defend in court the accused murderers of Joseph and Hyrum Smith. The defendants were all found not-guilty.<ref>Dallin H. Oaks and Marvin S. Hill, ''[[Carthage Conspiracy: The Trial of the Accused Assassins of Joseph Smith]] ''(Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 1975), p. 182.</ref>\n\nShortly afterward, Williams chaired a meeting in Quincy that sought to arrange for a peaceful departure of the Mormons from Illinois to the far western [[Utah Territory]].<ref>\"Public Meeting,\" unidentified newspaper article in Special Collections, Brigham Young University Library.</ref> Williams appointed a delegation of Quincy citizens that traveled to Nauvoo and convinced the new Mormon leader, [[Brigham Young]], to leave Illinois for Utah in an orderly manner. Brigham Young said the Mormons could not leave immediately, but when \"grass grows and water runs,\" both signs of spring.<ref>David F. Wilcox and Lyman McCarl, ''Quincy and Adams County: History and Representative Men'' (Chicago, IL: Lewis Publishing Company, 1919), p. 206.</ref> The following spring the Mormons peacefully left Illinois for Utah, traveling mainly by wagon train.\n\n==The Illinois Constitutional Convention of 1847==\n\nWilliams was elected to the Illinois Constitutional Convention of 1847 as a Whig. The convention met in the state capitol in Springfield and proceeded to write an improved state constitution. Williams was elected in a Democratic district against a Democratic candidate.<ref>\"Hon. Archibald Williams, Quincy,\" in ''United States Biographical Dictionary and Portrait Gallery'' (Chicago, IL: American Biographical Publishing Company, 1876), Illinois Volume, p. 152.</ref> Although the Democrats had a majority of the delegates to the convention, the Whigs could break away Democratic votes when they needed them and ended up dominating the convention. A historian noted: \"James W. Singleton of Mount Sterling, Archibald Williams of Quincy, and David M. Woodson of Carrollton aggressively upheld the Whig cause against the attacks of various capable Democratic opponents.\"<ref>Arthur Charles Cole, \"Introduction,\" in Arthur Charles Cole, Ed., ''The Constitutional Debates of 1847'' (Springfield, IL: Illinois State Historical Library, 1919), p. xviii.</ref>\n\nAt the constitutional convention, Williams and the Whig Party supported the rights of property, strict voting requirements in state elections, and allowing the state legislature to override the governor's veto by a majority vote rather than a two-thirds vote.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Two issues were sent to the state's voters - one calling for the creation of an Illinois state bank and the other limiting the immigration into Illinois of freed slaves from the slave states.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} The voters of Illinois rejected the idea of an Illinois state bank but approved limiting the immigration of freed slaves.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nWilliams gave a major speech at the constitutional convention opposing the idea that the [[Illinois Supreme Court]] should meet at various locations throughout the state rather than only in the state capital of Springfield.<ref>Arthur Charles Cole, Ed., ''The Constitutional Debates of 1847'' (Springfield, IL: Illinois State Historical Library, 1919), p. 501-505</ref> After the constitutional convention adjourned, the voters of Illinois approved the new constitution by a ratio of almost 4 to 1.\n\nThe Constitutional Convention of 1847 was a landmark in the legal and political career of Williams.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} He succeeded in furthering the ideals and policies of the Whig Party against stiff Democratic Party opposition.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} He was three months in Springfield, the state capital, meeting and working with many of the leading politicians and government officials from throughout the state.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} It helped to make him a significant figure in Illinois political and governmental history.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Anti-Nebraska movement and William's failed run for Congress==\n\nIn the early 1850s, [[United States Senator]] [[Stephen Douglas]] of Illinois sought the adoption of the [[Kansas-Nebraska Act]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} The bill provided for Kansas and Nebraska to become territories with provision for \"[[popular sovereignty]],\" the idea that the citizens of each new territory would be allowed to vote on whether the territory should be slave or free.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} This produced a sharp reaction on the part of those opposed to slavery in the territories, because the [[Missouri Compromise]] of 1820 had stated that the lands that comprised Kansas and Nebraska should be free territory, not slave territory.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe result was the [[anti-Nebraska movement]], which opposed popular sovereignty for Nebraska on the grounds that the citizens of the territory might vote for slavery and thereby spread slavery further into the territories.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Williams and Lincoln both became anti-Nebraska men.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} For his part, Williams ran for the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1854 on a strong anti-Nebraska platform.<ref>\"Anti-Nebraska: A Whig Ticket That Is Quite A Curiosity In Its Way,\" ''Quincy (Illinois) Herald,'' February 1, 1893, p. 2.</ref>\n\nWilliams was running against incumbent Democratic Representative [[William Alexander Richardson]], a formidable opponent. The United States House district that comprised Quincy was strongly Democratic. On the other hand, Richardson was a close political ally of Stephen Douglas and had strongly backed popular sovereignty for Nebraska in the United States House.<ref>Dennis J. Thavenet, \"William Alexander Richardson, 1811-1875,\" Ph.D. dissertation, University of Nebraska, 1967, p. 152.</ref> Williams and his supporters hoped the wave of anti-Nebraska sentiment sweeping the northern states might just be strong enough to defeat Richardson, despite the strong Democratic voting tendency of the House district.\n\nOn October 31, 1854, Lincoln arrived in Quincy to give a speech in support of Williams's candidacy for the United States House of Representatives. It took two days for him to travel by railroad and stagecoach to Quincy. In a letter to a friend and political ally, Lincoln wrote: \"I am here now going to Quincy, to try to give Mr. [Archibald] Williams a little life.\"<ref>Abraham Lincoln to Richard Yates, October 30, 1854, in Roy P.

After 1854, Williams and Lincoln and other anti-Nebraskans took the lead in forming the Republican Party in Illinois around the issue of \"no slavery in the territories.\"\n\nLincoln wrote a letter in which he said he was ready to \"fuse\" with other anti-slavery groups according to \"principles\" adopted at a public meeting in Quincy. The purpose of fusion was to bring many disparate anti-slavery groups together to form the Republican Party. Lincoln's letter noted that the principles had been drawn up by a three-person committee led \"by Mr. Archibald Williams.\"<ref>Abraham Lincoln to Owen Lovejoy, August 11, 1855, in Roy P.

Orville Browning, Williams's good friend from Quincy, Illinois, was the opposing lawyer. The issue in dispute dealt with rival claims for lands and centered on whether the question of \"bad faith\" in the matter should be decided by a judge or by a jury. The Court ruled in ''Wright v. Mattison''<ref>''Wright v. Mattison,'' 59 US 50(1855).</ref> that \"bad faith\" should not be decided by the judge but by the jury, which had been the precedent. The Court ordered the case to be retried in a lower court. The outcome was a victory for Browning and a loss for Williams.<ref>Theodore C. Pease and James G.

A historian noted:\n\n\"At Bloomington, Lincoln, Williams, his old associate in the Legislature, [and] T.

All three times, Douglas pointed to Williams as an Illinois Republican who would have been an acceptable alternate choice to Lincoln in that contest.<ref>Roy P. Basler, ''Collected Works of Abraham Lincoln'' (Springfield, IL: 1953), Volume III, p. 7, 109, 174</ref>\n\nWilliams traveled and spoke throughout the state of Illinois in Lincoln's behalf during the 1858 United States Senate race. A newspaper in Quincy allied with the Republican Party, printed: \"Old Archie Williams is doing good service for the Republican cause... He has already spoken at Macomb, Oquawka, Monmouth, Cameron, Galesburg, and other points...to large assemblages; and everywhere, he has created enthusiasm and confidence among our friends and animated the lukewarm...

Michelin was getting a powerful advertisement for the capabilities of the [[radial tire]] Michelin had invented, when such experimentation was successful.\n\nNew models based on the small, utilitarian [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV|2CV]] [[economy car]] were introduced, notably the 1961 [[Citro\u00ebn Ami|Ami]]. It was also designed by [[Flaminio Bertoni]] and aimed to combine [[Three-box styling]] with the chassis of the 2CV. The Ami was very successful in France, but less so on export markets.

All these 2 cylinder models were very small, so there remained a wide market gap to the DS range all through the 1960s.\n\nIn 1970, Citro\u00ebn finally introduced a car to target the mid-range - the [[Citro\u00ebn GS]], which won the \"European car of the Year\" for 1971 and sold 2.5&nbsp;million units. It combined a small {{cvt|55|HP|kW|disp=flip}} flat-4 air-cooled engine with [[Hydropneumatic suspension]].

Its peak production year was 1970. Certain design elements like the somewhat narrow cabin, column-mounted [[gearstick]], and separate [[Fender (automobile)|fender]]s began to seem a little old-fashioned in the 1970s.\n\nCitro\u00ebn invested enormous resources to design and launch an entirely new vehicle in 1970, the [[Citro\u00ebn SM|SM]], which was in effect a thoroughly modernized DS, with similar length, but greater width.<ref name=\"Fall\">{{cite web | url=http://boitierrouge.com/2015/05/16/citroen-sm-la-chute-de-sa-majeste/| title= Citroen SM: the fall of \"Her Majesty\"| publisher=Boitier Rouge| language=French|date=16 May 2015 | accessdate=25 September 2017 | author=}}</ref> The manual gearbox was a modified DS unit. The front disc brakes were the same design. Axles, wheel bearings, steering knuckles, and hydraulic components were either DS parts or modified DS parts.<ref>Citro\u00ebn SM parts and repair manuals</ref>\n\nThe SM had a different purpose than replacing the 15-year-old DS design, however - it was meant to launch Citro\u00ebn into a completely new [[grand tourer|luxury grand touring]] [[market segment]]. Only fitted with a costly, exotic [[Maserati]] engine, the SM was faster and much more expensive than the DS. The SM was not designed to be a practical 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon]] suitable as a large [[family car]], the key market for vehicles of this type in Europe. Typically, manufacturers would introduce low-volume [[coup\u00e9]]s based on parts shared with an existing saloon, not as unique models, a contemporary example being the [[Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class]].<ref>Mercedes-Benz Buyer's Guide, Fred Larimer, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0760318119}} Page 81</ref> BMW follows a similar strategy of a mid size sedan (5 series), large coupe (6 series), and large sedan (7 series) sharing common underpinnings.<ref name=\"Fall\"/>\n\nThe SM's high price and limited utility of the [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2]] seating configuration meant the SM as actually produced could not seize the mantle from the DS. While the design funds invested would allow the DS to be replaced by two cars, a 'modern DS' and the smaller [[Citro\u00ebn CX|CX]], it was left to the CX alone to provide Citro\u00ebn's large family or executive car in the model range.<ref name=Automobilia1974/><ref name=\"Fall\"/>\n\nThe last DS came off the production line on 24 April 1975 - the manufacturer had taken the elementary precaution of building up approximately eight months of inventory of the \"break\" (estate/station wagon) version of the DS, to cover the period till the autumn of 1975, when the estate/station wagon version of the CX would be introduced.<ref name=Automobilia1974/>\n\n==Development==\nThe DS always maintained its size and shape, with easily removable, unstressed body panels, but certain design changes did occur.\nDuring the 20-year production life improvements were made on an ongoing basis.\n\n===ID 19 submodel to extend brand downwards (1957\u201369)===\nThe 1955 DS19 was 65% more expensive than the car it replaced, the [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant]].<ref>Bobbitt, p. 64.</ref> This affected potential sales in a country still recovering economically from World War II, so a cheaper submodel, the Citro\u00ebn ID, was introduced in 1957. \n[[File:1967 Citroen ID19B pic3.JPG|right|thumb|1967 Citro\u00ebn ID19B]]\nThe ID shared the DS's body but was less powerful and luxurious.

It retained the open two headlamp appearance, but was available with an optional set of driving lights mounted on the front fenders. All models in the range changed nose design at the same time, including the ID and station wagon models.\n\n===Series 3 - Nose redesign in 1967 with directional headlights===\nIn late 1967, for the 1968 model year, the DS and ID was again restyled, by [[Robert Opron]], who also styled the 1970 SM and 1974 CX. This version had a more streamlined [[Headlamp#History of automotive headlamps|headlamp]] design, giving the car a notably shark-like appearance. This design had four headlights under a smooth glass canopy, and the inner set [[Headlamp#Directional headlamps|swivelled]] with the steering wheel. This allowed the driver to see \"around\" turns, especially valuable on twisting roads driven at high speed at night. The directional headlamps were linked to the wheels by cable.<ref>{{cite book | title=Popular Science | date=July 1933 | publisher=Bonnier Corporation | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_AygDAAAAMBAJ | access-date=2020-03-15 | page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_AygDAAAAMBAJ/page/n60 59]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Kingston | first=Lewis | title=PH Origins: Directional headlights | website=PistonHeads | date=2018-11-19 | url=https://www.pistonheads.com/news/ph-origins/ph-origins-directional-headlights/39160 | access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref>\n\nBehind each glass cover lens, the inboard high-beam headlamp swivels by up to 80\u00b0 as the driver steers, throwing the beam along the driver's intended path rather than uselessly across the curved road.

Note the \"mushroom\" brake pedal. (The pedal on the left is the parking brake)\n}}\n\n===Suspension===\nIn a [[hydropneumatic suspension]] system, each wheel is connected, not to a spring, but to a hydraulic suspension unit consisting of a [[hydraulic accumulator]] sphere of about 12&nbsp;cm in diameter containing pressurised [[nitrogen]], a cylinder containing [[hydraulic fluid]] screwed to the suspension sphere, a piston inside the cylinder connected by levers to the suspension itself, and a [[dashpot|damper valve]] between the piston and the sphere.<ref name=\"mycitroen.dk\">{{cite web|url= http://www.mycitroen.dk/library/ds/Red/Hydraulics/Chas'%20Hydraulic%20Course.pdf |title=The hydraulic system of the Citro\u00ebn DS explained |first=Charles |last=Vyse |date=April 2003 |website=mycitroen.dk |accessdate=18 July 2018}}</ref> A membrane in the sphere prevented the nitrogen from escaping. The motion of the wheels translated to a motion of the piston, which acted on the oil in the nitrogen cushion and provided the spring effect. The damper valve took place of the shock absorber in conventional suspensions. The hydraulic cylinder was fed with hydraulic fluid from the main pressure reservoir via a ''height corrector'', a valve controlled by the mid-position of the anti-roll bar connected to the axle. If the suspension was too low, the height corrector introduced high-pressure fluid; if it was too high, it released fluid back to the fluid reservoir. In this manner, a constant ride height was maintained. A control in the cabin allowed the driver to select one of five [[height adjustable suspension|heights]]: normal riding height, two slightly higher riding heights for poor terrain, and two extreme positions for changing wheels. (The correct term, ''oleopneumatic'' (oil-air), has never gained widespread use. ''Hydropneumatic'' (water-air) continues to be preferred overwhelmingly.)\n\nThe DS did not have a jack for lifting the car off the ground. Instead, the hydraulic system enabled wheel changes with the aid of a simple adjustable stand. To change a flat tyre, one would adjust the suspension to its topmost setting, insert the stand into a special peg near the flat tyre, then readjust the suspension to its lowermost setting. The flat tyre would then retract upwards and hover above ground, ready to be changed.<ref name=\"hemmings2\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2013/07/25/cars-of-futures-past-citroen-ds/|title=Cars of Futures Past &#8211; Citroen DS - Hemmings Daily|author=Hemmings.com|publisher=blog.hemmings.com|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref> This system, used on the SM also, was superseded on the CX by a screw jack that, after the suspension was raised to the high position, lifted the tire clear of the ground. The DS system, while impressive to use, sometimes dropped the car quite suddenly, especially if the stand was not placed precisely or the ground was soft or unlevel.\n\n===Source and reserve of pressure===\nThe central part of the hydraulic system was the high-pressure pump, which maintained a pressure of between 130 and 150&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|bar]] in two ''accumulators''. These accumulators were very similar in construction to the suspension spheres. One was dedicated to the front [[brake]]s, and the other ran the other hydraulic systems. (On the simpler ID models, the front brakes operated from the main accumulator.) Thus in case of a hydraulic failure, the first indication would be that the steering became heavy, followed by the gearbox not working; only later would the brakes fail.\n\nTwo different hydraulic pumps were used. The DS used a seven-cylinder [[axial piston pump]] driven off two belts and delivering 175 bar (2,540&nbsp;psi) of pressure. The ID19, with its simpler hydraulic system, had a single-cylinder pump driven by an eccentric on the [[camshaft]].\n\n===Gearbox and clutch===\n\n====''Hydraulique'' or ''Citromatic''====\nThe DS was initially offered only with the \"hydraulique\" four-speed [[Semi-automatic transmission#Citro\u00ebn|semi-automatic]] (bvh\u2014\"bo\u00eete de vitesses hydraulique\") gearbox.<ref name=\"mycitroen.dk\"/>\n\nThis was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, operated by a hydraulic controller. To change gears, the driver flicked a lever behind the steering wheel to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The hydraulic controller disengaged the [[clutch]], engaged the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled by a centrifugal regulator sensing engine rpm and driven off the [[camshaft]] by a belt, the position of the [[butterfly valve]] in the carburetor (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the brake circuit. When the brake was pressed, the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop in idle throttle position also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following loss of system fluid), the clutch would disengage, to prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to a standstill.\n\nUnlike an automatic transmission, there is no Park position on the transmission where the wheels are locked.  In addition, the hydraulic clutch would disengage with the engine stopped, so the car could not be left in gear when parked.  The only way to prevent the car from rolling (for example, if parked on a slope) is to use the parking brake.\n\n==== Manual\u2014four-speed and five-speed ====\nThe later and simpler ID19 had the same gearbox and clutch, manually operated. This configuration was offered as a cheaper option for the DS in 1963. The mechanical aspects of the [[gearbox]] and [[clutch]] were completely conventional and the same elements were used in the ID 19. In September 1970, Citro\u00ebn introduced a five-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] gearbox, in addition to the original four-speed unit.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1996\">{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=John |title=Original Citro\u00ebn DS |year=1996 |publisher=Bay View Books |isbn=1-870979-71-0}}</ref>  All manual transmissions used a steering column mounted shifter.\n\n==== Fully automatic ====\nIn September 1971 Citro\u00ebn introduced a 3-speed fully [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] [[Borg-Warner 35 transmission]] gearbox, on the DS 21 and later DS 23 models.<ref>{{cite web |title=la DS \u00e0 boite automatique Borg Warner |url=http://www.nuancierds.fr/Citroen%20DS%20boite%20Borg%20Warner.htm |website=Le Nuancier DS |accessdate=18 July 2018 |language=French}}</ref> The fully automatic transmission DS was never sold in the US market where this type of transmission had gained market share so quickly that it became the majority of the market by this time. Many automatic DSs, fuel-injected DS 23 sedans with air conditioning, were sold in [[Australia]].\n\n===Engines===\n[[File:Citro\u00ebn Schnitt-DS Motor.jpg|thumb|Cutaway model shows engine set far back from front wheels (\"[[MF layout]]\"), and partially reveals configuration of the oleopneumatic suspension]]\nThe DS was originally designed around an [[Air-cooled engine|air-cooled]] [[flat-6|flat-six]] based on the design of the [[Flat-twin|2-cylinder]] engine of the 2CV, similar to the motor in the [[Porsche 911]]. Technical and monetary problems forced this idea to be scrapped.\n\nThus, for such a modern car, the engine of the original DS 19 was also old-fashioned. It was derived from the engine of the 11CV [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant|Traction Avant]] (models 11B and 11C).<ref name=\"citroenet.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.citroenet.org.uk/passenger-cars/michelin/ds/03.html|title=Citro\u00ebn DS the birth of the goddess 3|publisher=citroenet.org.uk|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref> It was an [[Overhead valve|OHV]] [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] engine with three main bearings and wet liners, and a bore of {{convert|78|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and a stroke of {{convert|100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, giving a volumetric displacement of 1911&nbsp;cc. The cylinder head had been reworked; the 11C had a reverse-flow cast iron cylinder head and generated {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} at 3800&nbsp;rpm; by contrast, the DS 19 had an aluminium cross-flow head with hemispherical combustion chambers and generated {{convert|75|hp|abbr=on}} at 4500&nbsp;rpm.\n\nLike the Traction Avant, the DS had the gearbox mounted in front of the engine, with the differential in between. Thus some consider the DS to be a [[MF layout|mid engine front-wheel drive]] car.<ref name=\"citroenet.org.uk\"/>\n\nThe DS and ID powerplants evolved throughout its 20-year production life. The car was underpowered and faced constant mechanical changes to boost the performance of the four-cylinder engine. The initial [[engine displacement|1911&nbsp;cc]] three main [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] engine (carried forward from the [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant|Traction Avant]]) of the DS 19 was replaced in 1965 with the 1985&nbsp;cc five-bearing wet-cylinder motor, becoming the DS 19a (called DS 20 from September 1969).\n\n[[File:Citroen-DS-capot-ouvert.jpg|thumb|right|Spare tire, mounted under the hood]]\n\nThe DS 21 was also introduced for model year 1965. This was a 2175&nbsp;cc, five main bearing engine; power was 109&nbsp;hp<ref name=\"willson1995\">{{cite book|last=Willson|first=Quentin|title=The Ultimate Classic Car Book|year=1995|publisher=DK Publishing|isbn=0-7894-0159-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ultimateclassicc00quen}}</ref> This engine received a substantial increase in power with the introduction of [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] electronic [[fuel injection]] for 1970, making the DS one of the first mass-market cars to use electronic fuel injection. Power of the carbureted version also increased slightly at the same time, owing to the employment of larger inlet valves.\n\nLastly, 1973 saw the introduction of the 2347&nbsp;cc engine of the DS 23 in both carbureted and fuel-injected forms. The DS 23 with electronic fuel injection was the most powerful production model, producing {{convert|141|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.<ref>Bobbitt, p. 131.</ref>\n\nIDs and their variants went through a similar evolution, generally lagging the DS by about one year. ID saloon models never received the DS 23 engine or fuel injection, although the Break/Familiale versions received the carburetted version of the DS 23 engine when it was introduced, supplemented the DS20 Break/Familiale.\n\nThe top of the range ID model, The DSuper5 (DP) gained the DS21 engine (the only model that this engine was retained in) for the 1973 model year and it was mated to a five-speed gearbox. This should not be confused with the 1985&nbsp;cc DSuper fitted with an optional \"low ratio\" five-speed gearbox, or with the previous DS21M (DJ) five-speed.\n\n==In popular culture==\nPresident [[Charles de Gaulle]] survived an assassination attempt at Le Petit-Clamart near [[Paris]] on August 22, 1962, planned by [[Algerian War]] veteran [[Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry]]. The plan was to ambush the motorcade with machine guns, disable the vehicles, and then close in for the kill. De Gaulle praised the unusual abilities of his unarmoured DS with saving his life \u2013 the car was peppered with bullets, and the shots had punctured the tyres, but the car could still escape at full speed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/citroen-helps-de-gaulle-survive-assassination-attempt |title=Citroen helps De Gaulle survive assassination attempt |publisher=History.com}}</ref> This event was accurately recreated in the 1973 film ''[[The Day of the Jackal (film)|The Day of the Jackal]]''.

Many feature hybrid-diesel engines to maximise efficiency.\n\n==Production figures==\n[[File:Citroen DS production chart.png|thumb|300px|Citro\u00ebn DS production chart]]\n{{div col|colwidth=19em}}\n* 1955: 69\n* 1956: 9,868\n* 1957: 28,593\n* 1958: 52,416\n* 1959: 66,931\n* 1960: 83,205\n* 1961: 77,597\n* 1962: 83,035\n* 1963: 93,476\n* 1964: 85,379\n* 1965: 89,314\n* 1966: 99,561\n* 1967: 101,904\n* 1968: 81,860\n* 1969: 82,218\n* 1970: 103,633\n* 1971: 84,328\n* 1972: 92,483\n* 1973: 96,990\n* 1974: 40,039\n* 1975: 847<ref>{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=John |title=Original Citro\u00ebn DS |year=1996 |publisher=Bay View Books |page=135 |isbn=1-870979-71-0}}</ref>\n{{div col end}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== See also ==\n*''[[Road & Track]]'' magazine, USA.

Throughout the late 1950s and 1960s Citro\u00ebn developed many new vehicles for the very large, profitable market segments between the 2CV and the DS, occupied by vehicles like the [[Peugeot 403]], [[Renault 16]] and [[Ford Cortina]], but none made it into production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citroenet.org.uk/prototypes/c8-c10/cocinelle.html|title=Citro\u00ebn Cocinelle C1 - C8|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citroenet.org.uk/prototypes/c60/c-60.html|title=Citro\u00ebn C 60|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citroenet.org.uk/prototypes/projet-f/projet-f.html|title=Citro\u00ebn Projet F (Projet AP)|publisher=}}</ref> Either they had uneconomic build costs, or were ordinary \"me too\" cars, not up to the company's high standard of [[innovation]]. As Citro\u00ebn was owned by [[Michelin]] from 1934 to 1974 as a sort of research laboratory, such broad experimentation was possible. Michelin was getting a powerful advertisement for the capabilities of the [[radial tire]] Michelin had invented, when such experimentation was successful.\n\nNew models based on the small, utilitarian [[Citro\u00ebn 2CV|2CV]] [[economy car]] were introduced, notably the 1961 [[Citro\u00ebn Ami|Ami]]. It was also designed by [[Flaminio Bertoni]] and aimed to combine [[Three-box styling]] with the chassis of the 2CV. The Ami was very successful in France, but less so on export markets. Many found the styling controversial, and the car noisy and underpowered.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/triggerscarstuff/sets/72157640750682204/|title=Citroen Ami 6 Road Test 1962|work=Flickr}}</ref> The [[Citro\u00ebn Dyane|Dyane]] was a modernised 2CV with a hatchback that competed with the 2CV inspired [[Renault 4]] [[Hatchback]]. All these 2 cylinder models were very small, so there remained a wide market gap to the DS range all through the 1960s.\n\nIn 1970, Citro\u00ebn finally introduced a car to target the mid-range - the [[Citro\u00ebn GS]], which won the \"European car of the Year\" for 1971 and sold 2.5&nbsp;million units. It combined a small {{cvt|55|HP|kW|disp=flip}} flat-4 air-cooled engine with [[Hydropneumatic suspension]]. The intended {{cvt|106|HP|kW|disp=flip}} [[Comotor|Wankel rotary-engined]] version with more power did not reach full production.\n\n==Replacing the DS==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Citro\u00ebn SM]] -->\nThe DS remained popular and competitive throughout its production run. Its peak production year was 1970. Certain design elements like the somewhat narrow cabin, column-mounted [[gearstick]], and separate [[Fender (automobile)|fender]]s began to seem a little old-fashioned in the 1970s.\n\nCitro\u00ebn invested enormous resources to design and launch an entirely new vehicle in 1970, the [[Citro\u00ebn SM|SM]], which was in effect a thoroughly modernized DS, with similar length, but greater width.<ref name=\"Fall\">{{cite web | url=http://boitierrouge.com/2015/05/16/citroen-sm-la-chute-de-sa-majeste/| title= Citroen SM: the fall of \"Her Majesty\"| publisher=Boitier Rouge| language=French|date=16 May 2015 | accessdate=25 September 2017 | author=}}</ref> The manual gearbox was a modified DS unit. The front disc brakes were the same design. Axles, wheel bearings, steering knuckles, and hydraulic components were either DS parts or modified DS parts.<ref>Citro\u00ebn SM parts and repair manuals</ref>\n\nThe SM had a different purpose than replacing the 15-year-old DS design, however - it was meant to launch Citro\u00ebn into a completely new [[grand tourer|luxury grand touring]] [[market segment]]. Only fitted with a costly, exotic [[Maserati]] engine, the SM was faster and much more expensive than the DS. The SM was not designed to be a practical 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|saloon]] suitable as a large [[family car]], the key market for vehicles of this type in Europe. Typically, manufacturers would introduce low-volume [[coup\u00e9]]s based on parts shared with an existing saloon, not as unique models, a contemporary example being the [[Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class]].<ref>Mercedes-Benz Buyer's Guide, Fred Larimer, 2004, {{ISBN|978-0760318119}} Page 81</ref> BMW follows a similar strategy of a mid size sedan (5 series), large coupe (6 series), and large sedan (7 series) sharing common underpinnings.<ref name=\"Fall\"/>\n\nThe SM's high price and limited utility of the [[2+2 (car body style)|2+2]] seating configuration meant the SM as actually produced could not seize the mantle from the DS. While the design funds invested would allow the DS to be replaced by two cars, a 'modern DS' and the smaller [[Citro\u00ebn CX|CX]], it was left to the CX alone to provide Citro\u00ebn's large family or executive car in the model range.<ref name=Automobilia1974/><ref name=\"Fall\"/>\n\nThe last DS came off the production line on 24 April 1975 - the manufacturer had taken the elementary precaution of building up approximately eight months of inventory of the \"break\" (estate/station wagon) version of the DS, to cover the period till the autumn of 1975, when the estate/station wagon version of the CX would be introduced.<ref name=Automobilia1974/>\n\n==Development==\nThe DS always maintained its size and shape, with easily removable, unstressed body panels, but certain design changes did occur.\nDuring the 20-year production life improvements were made on an ongoing basis.\n\n===ID 19 submodel to extend brand downwards (1957\u201369)===\nThe 1955 DS19 was 65% more expensive than the car it replaced, the [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant]].<ref>Bobbitt, p. 64.</ref> This affected potential sales in a country still recovering economically from World War II, so a cheaper submodel, the Citro\u00ebn ID, was introduced in 1957. \n[[File:1967 Citroen ID19B pic3.JPG|right|thumb|1967 Citro\u00ebn ID19B]]\nThe ID shared the DS's body but was less powerful and luxurious.

This version had a more streamlined [[Headlamp#History of automotive headlamps|headlamp]] design, giving the car a notably shark-like appearance. This design had four headlights under a smooth glass canopy, and the inner set [[Headlamp#Directional headlamps|swivelled]] with the steering wheel. This allowed the driver to see \"around\" turns, especially valuable on twisting roads driven at high speed at night. The directional headlamps were linked to the wheels by cable.<ref>{{cite book | title=Popular Science | date=July 1933 | publisher=Bonnier Corporation | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_AygDAAAAMBAJ | access-date=2020-03-15 | page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_AygDAAAAMBAJ/page/n60 59]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | last=Kingston | first=Lewis | title=PH Origins: Directional headlights | website=PistonHeads | date=2018-11-19 | url=https://www.pistonheads.com/news/ph-origins/ph-origins-directional-headlights/39160 | access-date=2020-03-15}}</ref>\n\nBehind each glass cover lens, the inboard high-beam headlamp swivels by up to 80\u00b0 as the driver steers, throwing the beam along the driver's intended path rather than uselessly across the curved road.

The difficulty with hygroscopic hydraulic fluid was exacerbated in the DS/ID due to the extreme rise and fall in the fluid level in the reservoir, which went from nearly full to nearly empty when the suspension extended to maximum height and the six accumulators in the system filled with fluid.

Note the \"mushroom\" brake pedal. (The pedal on the left is the parking brake)\n}}\n\n===Suspension===\nIn a [[hydropneumatic suspension]] system, each wheel is connected, not to a spring, but to a hydraulic suspension unit consisting of a [[hydraulic accumulator]] sphere of about 12&nbsp;cm in diameter containing pressurised [[nitrogen]], a cylinder containing [[hydraulic fluid]] screwed to the suspension sphere, a piston inside the cylinder connected by levers to the suspension itself, and a [[dashpot|damper valve]] between the piston and the sphere.<ref name=\"mycitroen.dk\">{{cite web|url= http://www.mycitroen.dk/library/ds/Red/Hydraulics/Chas'%20Hydraulic%20Course.pdf |title=The hydraulic system of the Citro\u00ebn DS explained |first=Charles |last=Vyse |date=April 2003 |website=mycitroen.dk |accessdate=18 July 2018}}</ref> A membrane in the sphere prevented the nitrogen from escaping. The motion of the wheels translated to a motion of the piston, which acted on the oil in the nitrogen cushion and provided the spring effect. The damper valve took place of the shock absorber in conventional suspensions. The hydraulic cylinder was fed with hydraulic fluid from the main pressure reservoir via a ''height corrector'', a valve controlled by the mid-position of the anti-roll bar connected to the axle. If the suspension was too low, the height corrector introduced high-pressure fluid; if it was too high, it released fluid back to the fluid reservoir. In this manner, a constant ride height was maintained. A control in the cabin allowed the driver to select one of five [[height adjustable suspension|heights]]: normal riding height, two slightly higher riding heights for poor terrain, and two extreme positions for changing wheels. (The correct term, ''oleopneumatic'' (oil-air), has never gained widespread use. ''Hydropneumatic'' (water-air) continues to be preferred overwhelmingly.)\n\nThe DS did not have a jack for lifting the car off the ground. Instead, the hydraulic system enabled wheel changes with the aid of a simple adjustable stand. To change a flat tyre, one would adjust the suspension to its topmost setting, insert the stand into a special peg near the flat tyre, then readjust the suspension to its lowermost setting. The flat tyre would then retract upwards and hover above ground, ready to be changed.<ref name=\"hemmings2\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2013/07/25/cars-of-futures-past-citroen-ds/|title=Cars of Futures Past &#8211; Citroen DS - Hemmings Daily|author=Hemmings.com|publisher=blog.hemmings.com|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref> This system, used on the SM also, was superseded on the CX by a screw jack that, after the suspension was raised to the high position, lifted the tire clear of the ground. The DS system, while impressive to use, sometimes dropped the car quite suddenly, especially if the stand was not placed precisely or the ground was soft or unlevel.\n\n===Source and reserve of pressure===\nThe central part of the hydraulic system was the high-pressure pump, which maintained a pressure of between 130 and 150&nbsp;[[bar (unit)|bar]] in two ''accumulators''. These accumulators were very similar in construction to the suspension spheres. One was dedicated to the front [[brake]]s, and the other ran the other hydraulic systems. (On the simpler ID models, the front brakes operated from the main accumulator.) Thus in case of a hydraulic failure, the first indication would be that the steering became heavy, followed by the gearbox not working; only later would the brakes fail.\n\nTwo different hydraulic pumps were used. The DS used a seven-cylinder [[axial piston pump]] driven off two belts and delivering 175 bar (2,540&nbsp;psi) of pressure. The ID19, with its simpler hydraulic system, had a single-cylinder pump driven by an eccentric on the [[camshaft]].\n\n===Gearbox and clutch===\n\n====''Hydraulique'' or ''Citromatic''====\nThe DS was initially offered only with the \"hydraulique\" four-speed [[Semi-automatic transmission#Citro\u00ebn|semi-automatic]] (bvh\u2014\"bo\u00eete de vitesses hydraulique\") gearbox.<ref name=\"mycitroen.dk\"/>\n\nThis was a four-speed gearbox and clutch, operated by a hydraulic controller. To change gears, the driver flicked a lever behind the steering wheel to the next position and eased-up on the accelerator pedal. The hydraulic controller disengaged the [[clutch]], engaged the nominated gear, and re-engaged the clutch. The speed of engagement of the clutch was controlled by a centrifugal regulator sensing engine rpm and driven off the [[camshaft]] by a belt, the position of the [[butterfly valve]] in the carburetor (i.e., the position of the accelerator), and the brake circuit. When the brake was pressed, the engine idle speed dropped to an rpm below the clutch engagement speed, thus preventing friction while stopped in gear at traffic lights. When the brake was released, the idle speed increased to the clutch dragging speed. The car would then creep forward much like automatic transmission cars. This drop in idle throttle position also caused the car to have more engine drag when the brakes were applied even before the car slowed to the idle speed in gear, preventing the engine from pulling against the brakes. In the event of loss of hydraulic pressure (following loss of system fluid), the clutch would disengage, to prevent driving, while brake pressure reserves would allow safe braking to a standstill.\n\nUnlike an automatic transmission, there is no Park position on the transmission where the wheels are locked.  In addition, the hydraulic clutch would disengage with the engine stopped, so the car could not be left in gear when parked.  The only way to prevent the car from rolling (for example, if parked on a slope) is to use the parking brake.\n\n==== Manual\u2014four-speed and five-speed ====\nThe later and simpler ID19 had the same gearbox and clutch, manually operated. This configuration was offered as a cheaper option for the DS in 1963. The mechanical aspects of the [[gearbox]] and [[clutch]] were completely conventional and the same elements were used in the ID 19. In September 1970, Citro\u00ebn introduced a five-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] gearbox, in addition to the original four-speed unit.<ref name=\"Reynolds 1996\">{{cite book |last=Reynolds |first=John |title=Original Citro\u00ebn DS |year=1996 |publisher=Bay View Books |isbn=1-870979-71-0}}</ref>  All manual transmissions used a steering column mounted shifter.\n\n==== Fully automatic ====\nIn September 1971 Citro\u00ebn introduced a 3-speed fully [[Automatic transmission|automatic]] [[Borg-Warner 35 transmission]] gearbox, on the DS 21 and later DS 23 models.<ref>{{cite web |title=la DS \u00e0 boite automatique Borg Warner |url=http://www.nuancierds.fr/Citroen%20DS%20boite%20Borg%20Warner.htm |website=Le Nuancier DS |accessdate=18 July 2018 |language=French}}</ref> The fully automatic transmission DS was never sold in the US market where this type of transmission had gained market share so quickly that it became the majority of the market by this time. Many automatic DSs, fuel-injected DS 23 sedans with air conditioning, were sold in [[Australia]].\n\n===Engines===\n[[File:Citro\u00ebn Schnitt-DS Motor.jpg|thumb|Cutaway model shows engine set far back from front wheels (\"[[MF layout]]\"), and partially reveals configuration of the oleopneumatic suspension]]\nThe DS was originally designed around an [[Air-cooled engine|air-cooled]] [[flat-6|flat-six]] based on the design of the [[Flat-twin|2-cylinder]] engine of the 2CV, similar to the motor in the [[Porsche 911]]. Technical and monetary problems forced this idea to be scrapped.\n\nThus, for such a modern car, the engine of the original DS 19 was also old-fashioned. It was derived from the engine of the 11CV [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant|Traction Avant]] (models 11B and 11C).<ref name=\"citroenet.org.uk\">{{cite web|url=http://www.citroenet.org.uk/passenger-cars/michelin/ds/03.html|title=Citro\u00ebn DS the birth of the goddess 3|publisher=citroenet.org.uk|accessdate=1 September 2015}}</ref> It was an [[Overhead valve|OHV]] [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] engine with three main bearings and wet liners, and a bore of {{convert|78|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} and a stroke of {{convert|100|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, giving a volumetric displacement of 1911&nbsp;cc. The cylinder head had been reworked; the 11C had a reverse-flow cast iron cylinder head and generated {{convert|60|hp|abbr=on}} at 3800&nbsp;rpm; by contrast, the DS 19 had an aluminium cross-flow head with hemispherical combustion chambers and generated {{convert|75|hp|abbr=on}} at 4500&nbsp;rpm.\n\nLike the Traction Avant, the DS had the gearbox mounted in front of the engine, with the differential in between. Thus some consider the DS to be a [[MF layout|mid engine front-wheel drive]] car.<ref name=\"citroenet.org.uk\"/>\n\nThe DS and ID powerplants evolved throughout its 20-year production life. The car was underpowered and faced constant mechanical changes to boost the performance of the four-cylinder engine. The initial [[engine displacement|1911&nbsp;cc]] three main [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]] engine (carried forward from the [[Citro\u00ebn Traction Avant|Traction Avant]]) of the DS 19 was replaced in 1965 with the 1985&nbsp;cc five-bearing wet-cylinder motor, becoming the DS 19a (called DS 20 from September 1969).\n\n[[File:Citroen-DS-capot-ouvert.jpg|thumb|right|Spare tire, mounted under the hood]]\n\nThe DS 21 was also introduced for model year 1965. This was a 2175&nbsp;cc, five main bearing engine; power was 109&nbsp;hp<ref name=\"willson1995\">{{cite book|last=Willson|first=Quentin|title=The Ultimate Classic Car Book|year=1995|publisher=DK Publishing|isbn=0-7894-0159-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ultimateclassicc00quen}}</ref> This engine received a substantial increase in power with the introduction of [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] electronic [[fuel injection]] for 1970, making the DS one of the first mass-market cars to use electronic fuel injection. Power of the carbureted version also increased slightly at the same time, owing to the employment of larger inlet valves.\n\nLastly, 1973 saw the introduction of the 2347&nbsp;cc engine of the DS 23 in both carbureted and fuel-injected forms. The DS 23 with electronic fuel injection was the most powerful production model, producing {{convert|141|hp|kW|abbr=on}}.<ref>Bobbitt, p. 131.</ref>\n\nIDs and their variants went through a similar evolution, generally lagging the DS by about one year. ID saloon models never received the DS 23 engine or fuel injection, although the Break/Familiale versions received the carburetted version of the DS 23 engine when it was introduced, supplemented the DS20 Break/Familiale.\n\nThe top of the range ID model, The DSuper5 (DP) gained the DS21 engine (the only model that this engine was retained in) for the 1973 model year and it was mated to a five-speed gearbox. This should not be confused with the 1985&nbsp;cc DSuper fitted with an optional \"low ratio\" five-speed gearbox, or with the previous DS21M (DJ) five-speed.\n\n==In popular culture==\nPresident [[Charles de Gaulle]] survived an assassination attempt at Le Petit-Clamart near [[Paris]] on August 22, 1962, planned by [[Algerian War]] veteran [[Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry]]. The plan was to ambush the motorcade with machine guns, disable the vehicles, and then close in for the kill. De Gaulle praised the unusual abilities of his unarmoured DS with saving his life \u2013 the car was peppered with bullets, and the shots had punctured the tyres, but the car could still escape at full speed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/citroen-helps-de-gaulle-survive-assassination-attempt |title=Citroen helps De Gaulle survive assassination attempt |publisher=History.com}}</ref> This event was accurately recreated in the 1973 film ''[[The Day of the Jackal (film)|The Day of the Jackal]]''.

One plausible theory is that the word \"Tehran\" is derived from Tiran/Tirgan, \"The Abode of Tir\" (Tir being the Zoroastrian deity equivalent to the Greek deity Mercury). The ancient Parthian town of Tiran was a neighbour to the town of Mehran (\"The Abode of Mehr/Mithra\", the Zoroastrian sun god). Both of these were mere villages in the suburbs of the great city of Ray/Rhages. Mehran is still extant and forms a residential district inside the Greater Tehran, as is also Ray\u2014which forms the southern suburbs of Tehran.\nAnother theory is that Tehran means \"a warm place\", as opposed to \"a cool place\" (e.g. Shemiran)\u2014a cooler district in northern Tehran. Some current texts in this regard claim that the word Tehran in Persian means \"warm mountain slope\" (\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0646\u0647 \u06af\u0631\u0645).\nThe official City of Tehran website says that \"Tehran\" comes from the Persian words \"Tah\" meaning \"end or bottom\" and \"Ran\" meaning \"[mountain] slope\"\u2014literally, bottom of the mountain slope. Given Tehran's geographic position at the bottom of the slope of the Alborz Mountains, this appears to be the most plausible explanation of the origin of the name of the city (\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0646\u0647 \u06cc \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u062f\u0648 \u06a9\u0648\u0647).<ref>{{Cite web |author=Behrooz, Samira; Karampour, Katayoun. |url=http://universityandheritage.net/SIFU/XII_Hanoi_2009/en/abstracts/html/14.html |title=A Research on Adaptation of Historic Urban Landscapes |date=November 15, 2008}}</ref> \n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Timeline of Tehran}}\n\nThe settlement of Tehran dates back over 7,000 years.<ref>{{Cite new |publisher=[[Press TV]] |url=http://presstv.ir/Detail/2015/01/13/392911/New-skeleton-unearthed-in-south-Tehran |title=7,000-year-old human skeleton recovered in south Tehran |date=January 14, 2015 |access-date=November 9, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016094735/http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/01/13/392911/New-skeleton-unearthed-in-south-Tehran |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Classical era ===\nTehran is situated within the historical region of [[Media (region)|Media]] ({{lang-peo|\ud800\udfb6\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfad}} {{transl|peo|M\u0101da}}) in northwestern Iran.

On June 2, 1907, the parliament passed a law on local governance known as the ''Baladie'' ([[municipal law]]), providing a detailed outline on issues such as the role of councils within the city, the members' qualifications, the election process, and the requirements to be entitled to vote. The then Qajar monarch [[Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar|Mohammad Ali Shah]] abolished the constitution and [[1908 bombardment of the Majlis|bombarded]] the parliament with the help of the Russian-controlled [[Persian Cossack Brigade|Cossack Brigade]] on June 23, 1908.

The consortium of Iranian architect [[Abdol-Aziz Mirza Farmanfarmaian|Abd-ol-Aziz Farmanfarmaian]] and the American firm of [[Victor Gruen|Victor Gruen Associates]] identified the main problems blighting the city to be high-density suburbs, air and water pollution, inefficient infrastructure, unemployment, and rural-urban migration.

After the political, social, and economic consequences of the [[1979 Revolution]] and the years that followed, a number of Iranian citizens, mostly Tehranis, left Iran. The majority of [[Iranian diaspora|Iranian emigrations]] have left for the [[Iranian Americans|United States]], [[Iranians in Germany|Germany]], [[Swedish Iranians|Sweden]], and [[Iranian Canadians|Canada]].\n\nWith the start of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (1980\u20131988), the second wave of inhabitants fled the city, especially during the Iraqi air offensives on the capital. With most major powers backing Iraq at the time, economic isolation gave yet more reason for many inhabitants to leave the city (and the country). Having left all they had and have struggled to adapt to a new country and build a life, most of them never came back when the war was over. During the war, Tehran also received a great number of migrants from the west and the southwest of the country bordering [[Iraq]].\n\nThe unstable situation and the war in neighbouring [[Afghanistan]] and Iraq prompted a rush of refugees into the country who arrived in their millions, with Tehran being a magnet for much seeking work, who subsequently helped the city to recover from war wounds, working for far less pay than local construction workers. Many of these refugees are being repatriated with the assistance of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], but there are still sizable groups of Afghan and Iraqi refugees in Tehran who are reluctant to leave, being pessimistic about the situation in their own countries. Afghan refugees are mostly [[Dari language|Dari]]-speaking [[Tajiks|Tajik]] and [[Hazara people|Hazara]], speaking a variety of Persian, and Iraqi refugees are mainly [[Mesopotamian Arabic]]-speakers who are often of Iranian heritage.\n\n=== Religion ===\n{{See also|Religion in Iran}}\nThe majority of Tehranis are officially [[Twelver Shia]] [[Islam|Muslims]], which has also been the state religion since the 16th-century [[Safavid conversion of Iran to Shia Islam|Safavid conversion]]. Other religious communities in the city include followers of the [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] and [[Sufism|Mystic]] branches of Islam, various [[Christianity|Christian]] denominations, [[Judaism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]].\n\nThere are many religious centres scattered around the city, from old to newly built centres, including [[List of religious centers in Tehran#Mosques and madrasehs|mosques]], [[List of religious centres in Tehran#Churches|churches]], [[List of religious centers in Tehran#Synagogues|synagogues]], and [[List of religious centers in Tehran#Fire temples|Zoroastrian fire temples]].

One plausible theory is that the word \"Tehran\" is derived from Tiran/Tirgan, \"The Abode of Tir\" (Tir being the Zoroastrian deity equivalent to the Greek deity Mercury). The ancient Parthian town of Tiran was a neighbour to the town of Mehran (\"The Abode of Mehr/Mithra\", the Zoroastrian sun god). Both of these were mere villages in the suburbs of the great city of Ray/Rhages. Mehran is still extant and forms a residential district inside the Greater Tehran, as is also Ray\u2014which forms the southern suburbs of Tehran.\nAnother theory is that Tehran means \"a warm place\", as opposed to \"a cool place\" (e.g. Shemiran)\u2014a cooler district in northern Tehran. Some current texts in this regard claim that the word Tehran in Persian means \"warm mountain slope\" (\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0646\u0647 \u06af\u0631\u0645).\nThe official City of Tehran website says that \"Tehran\" comes from the Persian words \"Tah\" meaning \"end or bottom\" and \"Ran\" meaning \"[mountain] slope\"\u2014literally, bottom of the mountain slope. Given Tehran's geographic position at the bottom of the slope of the Alborz Mountains, this appears to be the most plausible explanation of the origin of the name of the city (\u062f\u0627\u0645\u0646\u0647 \u06cc \u0628\u06cc\u0646 \u062f\u0648 \u06a9\u0648\u0647).<ref>{{Cite web |author=Behrooz, Samira; Karampour, Katayoun. |url=http://universityandheritage.net/SIFU/XII_Hanoi_2009/en/abstracts/html/14.html |title=A Research on Adaptation of Historic Urban Landscapes |date=November 15, 2008}}</ref> \n\n== History ==\n{{See also|Timeline of Tehran}}\n\nThe settlement of Tehran dates back over 7,000 years.<ref>{{Cite new |publisher=[[Press TV]] |url=http://presstv.ir/Detail/2015/01/13/392911/New-skeleton-unearthed-in-south-Tehran |title=7,000-year-old human skeleton recovered in south Tehran |date=January 14, 2015 |access-date=November 9, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016094735/http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2015/01/13/392911/New-skeleton-unearthed-in-south-Tehran |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n=== Classical era ===\nTehran is situated within the historical region of [[Media (region)|Media]] ({{lang-peo|\ud800\udfb6\ud800\udfa0\ud800\udfad}} {{transl|peo|M\u0101da}}) in northwestern Iran.

The 1878 plan of Tehran included new city walls, in the form of a perfect octagon with an area of 19 square kilometres, which mimicked the [[Renaissance]] cities of Europe.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web|url=http://jph.sagepub.com/content/12/1/49|author=Vahdat Za, Vahid.|title=Spatial Discrimination in Tehran's Modern Urban Planning 1906\u20131979|year=2011|work=Journal of Planning History vol. 12 no. 1 49\u201362|accessdate=2013-04-11|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016094735/http://jph.sagepub.com/content/12/1/49|archivedate=2015-10-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Late modern era ===\n[[File:Poster of Conquest of Tehran in July 1909 by Bakhtiaris.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Triumph of Tehran]]: [[Ali-Qoli Khan Bakhtiari|Sardar Asad II]] and [[Mohammad Vali Khan Tonekaboni|Sepahsalar e Tonekaboni]] conquering Tehran in July 1909]]\nThe growing social awareness of civil rights resulted in the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|Constitutional Revolution]] and the [[Persian Constitution of 1906|first constitution of Iran]] in 1906. On June 2, 1907, the parliament passed a law on local governance known as the ''Baladie'' ([[municipal law]]), providing a detailed outline on issues such as the role of councils within the city, the members' qualifications, the election process, and the requirements to be entitled to vote. The then Qajar monarch [[Mohammad Ali Shah Qajar|Mohammad Ali Shah]] abolished the constitution and [[1908 bombardment of the Majlis|bombarded]] the parliament with the help of the Russian-controlled [[Persian Cossack Brigade|Cossack Brigade]] on June 23, 1908. That followed the capture of the city by the revolutionary forces of [[Ali-Qoli Khan Bakhtiari|Ali-Qoli Khan]] (Sardar Asad II) and [[Mohammad Vali Khan Tonekaboni|Mohammad Vali Khan]] (Sepahsalar e Tonekaboni) on July 13, 1909. As a result, the monarch was exiled and replaced with his son [[Ahmad Shah Qajar|Ahmad]], and the parliament was re-established.\n[[File:ETH-BIB-Teheran aus 400 m H\u00f6he-Persienflug 1924-1925-LBS MH02-02-0085-AL-FL.tif|250px|thumb|Aerial view of Tehran in 1925]]\nAfter [[World War I]], the constituent assembly elected [[Reza Shah]] of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]] as the new monarch, who immediately suspended the Baladie law of 1907, replacing the decentralized and autonomous city councils with centralist approaches of governance and planning.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nFrom the 1920s to the 1930s, under the rule of Reza Shah, the city was essentially rebuilt from scratch. That followed a systematic demolition of several old buildings, including parts of the [[Golestan Palace]], [[Tekyeh Dowlat|Tekye Dowlat]], and [[Toopkhaneh|Tupkhane Square]], which were replaced with modern buildings influenced by classical Iranian architecture, particularly the building of the [[Bank Melli Iran|National Bank]], the Police Headquarters, the Telegraph Office, and the Military Academy.\n\nThe changes in urban fabric started with the street-widening act of 1933, which served as a framework for changes in all other cities. The [[Grand Bazaar, Tehran|Grand Bazaar]] was divided in half and many historic buildings were demolished to be replaced with wide straight avenues.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Chaichian|first1=Mohammad|title=Town and Country in the Middle East: Iran and Egypt in the Transition to Globalization|date=2009|publisher=Lexington Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7391-2677-6|pages=95\u2013116}}</ref> As a result, the traditional texture of the city was replaced with intersecting cruciform streets that created large roundabouts, located on major public spaces such as the bazaar.\n\nAs an attempt to create a network for easy transportation within the city, the old citadel and city walls were demolished in 1937, replaced by wide streets cutting through the urban fabric. The new city map of Tehran in 1937 was heavily influenced by modernist planning patterns of zoning and gridiron networks.<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\nDuring [[World War II]], [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] troops entered the city. In 1943, Tehran was the site of the [[Tehran Conference]], attended by U.S. President [[Franklin D.

These plans not only failed to slow the unbalanced growth of Tehran, but with the 1962 land reforms that Reza Shah's son and successor [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Mohammad Reza Shah]] named the ''[[White Revolution]]'', Tehran's chaotic growth was further accentuated.\n\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, Tehran was rapidly developing under the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah. Modern buildings altered the face of Tehran and ambitious projects were envisioned for the following decades. In order to resolve the problem of [[social exclusion]], the first comprehensive plan of Tehran was approved in 1968. The consortium of Iranian architect [[Abdol-Aziz Mirza Farmanfarmaian|Abd-ol-Aziz Farmanfarmaian]] and the American firm of [[Victor Gruen|Victor Gruen Associates]] identified the main problems blighting the city to be high-density suburbs, air and water pollution, inefficient infrastructure, unemployment, and rural-urban migration. Eventually, the whole plan was marginalized by the [[1979 Revolution]] and the subsequent [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]].<ref name=autogenerated2 />\n\n[[File:Tehran's Azadi Tower at night.jpeg|thumb|The [[Azadi Tower]] was built in 1971.]]\nTehran's most famous landmark, the [[Azadi Tower]], was built by the order of the Shah in 1971. It was designed by [[Hossein Amanat]], an architect who won a competition to design the monument, combining elements of classical [[Sasanian architecture|Sassanian architecture]] with post-classical Iranian architecture. Formerly known as the ''Shahyad Tower'', it was built in commemoration of the [[2,500-year celebration of the Persian Empire|2,500th year of the foundation of the Imperial State of Iran]].\n\nDuring the 1980\u20131988 Iran\u2013Iraq War, Tehran was the target of repeated [[Scud]] missile attacks and airstrikes.\n\nThe 435-meter-high [[Milad Tower]], which was part of the proposed development projects in pre-revolutionary Iran,<ref name=SadCity>{{cite web|last=Vanstiphout|first=Wouter|title=The Saddest City in the World|url=http://www.thenewtown.nl/article.php?id_article=71|work=The New Town|accessdate=1 June 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219102023/http://www.thenewtown.nl/article.php?id_article=71|archivedate=19 December 2013}}</ref> was completed in 2007, and has thence become a famous landmark of Tehran.

Tehran's climate is largely defined by its geographic location, with the towering [[Alborz]] mountains to its north and the country's central desert to the south. It can be generally described as mild in spring and autumn, hot and dry in summer, and cold and wet in winter.\n\n[[File:A fall in Nation Park, Tehran City.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Mellat Park]] in autumn.]]\nAs the city has a large area, with significant differences in elevation among various districts, the weather is often cooler in the hilly north than in the flat southern part of Tehran.

After the political, social, and economic consequences of the [[1979 Revolution]] and the years that followed, a number of Iranian citizens, mostly Tehranis, left Iran. The majority of [[Iranian diaspora|Iranian emigrations]] have left for the [[Iranian Americans|United States]], [[Iranians in Germany|Germany]], [[Swedish Iranians|Sweden]], and [[Iranian Canadians|Canada]].\n\nWith the start of the [[Iran\u2013Iraq War]] (1980\u20131988), the second wave of inhabitants fled the city, especially during the Iraqi air offensives on the capital. With most major powers backing Iraq at the time, economic isolation gave yet more reason for many inhabitants to leave the city (and the country). Having left all they had and have struggled to adapt to a new country and build a life, most of them never came back when the war was over. During the war, Tehran also received a great number of migrants from the west and the southwest of the country bordering [[Iraq]].\n\nThe unstable situation and the war in neighbouring [[Afghanistan]] and Iraq prompted a rush of refugees into the country who arrived in their millions, with Tehran being a magnet for much seeking work, who subsequently helped the city to recover from war wounds, working for far less pay than local construction workers. Many of these refugees are being repatriated with the assistance of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|UNHCR]], but there are still sizable groups of Afghan and Iraqi refugees in Tehran who are reluctant to leave, being pessimistic about the situation in their own countries.

At present, the chair of the organization is Toronto businessman Stephen Smith, while Anthony Wilson-Smith has been president and chief executive officer since September, 2012.  Other members of the board of directors include some of Canada's most prominent citizens, such as chair emeritus [[Avie Bennett]] \u2013 a Companion of the Order of Canada; businessman and philanthropist [[Charles Bronfman]]; and comedian and social commentator [[Rick Mercer]].\n\nSome of the organizations best-known programs include its collection of more than 80 Heritage Minutes \u2013 60 second vignettes re-enacting important and remarkable incidents in Canada's history \u2013 and [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]], the only known national encyclopedia of its nature in the Western world.\n\n== Indigenous Arts & Stories ==\n\nIndigenous Arts & Stories invites [[First Nations]], [[M\u00e9tis]], and [[Inuit]] artists aged 11 to 29 to interpret an aspect of their culture and heritage through literary and visual arts. 2010-2011 is the first year the contest expanded to accept arts submissions, after six years as exclusively a writing competition.\n \nA jury of accomplished Indigenous authors, artists, and community leaders select the winning submissions, including [[Drew Hayden Taylor]], [[Kent Monkman]] and [[Lee Maracle]]. Honorary Patrons of the program include  [[Assembly of First Nations]] National Chief [[Perry Bellegarde]], [[Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami]] President Terry Audla, and [[M\u00e9tis National Council]] President Cl\u00e9ment Chartier.\n\nThe contest was born out of the book \"Our Story,\" a joint project of the Dominion Institute and Doubleday Canada.

The Encyclopedia is updated on a daily basis. In addition to updates, the Encyclopedia's staff of eight full-time editors regularly write and commission new articles.\n\n==Encounters With Canada==\n\n[[Encounters with Canada]] is Canada's largest youth forum. The program brings more than 100 Canadian youth aged 14 to 17 to Ottawa each week during the school year to participate in themed weeks, to discover Canada and to explore various career pathways. More than 100,000 youth have participated in the program.\n\n== Heritage Minutes ==\n\nThe ''[[Heritage Minutes]]'' recreate events of great importance, accomplishment, and bravery in Canada's history. The Minutes were created by The CRB Foundation in 1991 and re-launched by Historica Canada in 2012.  Nationally known \u2013 especially to a generation of young Canadians who grew up watching them \u2013 The Minutes themselves have come to fit their tag line, \"A part of our heritage\". Over the years, they have featured appearances by some of Canada's best-known actors, including [[Colm Feore]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], {{ill|Jean l'Italien|fr}}, and [[Kate Nelligan]].\n\n== The Memory Project ==\n\nThe Memory Project invites veterans and [[Canadian Forces]] members to share their military experience with fellow Canadians, young and old.

The Memory Project Digital Archive is an extensive online collection of the oral histories and personal memorabilia of the men and women of the Canadian Armed Forces. The Archive provides more than 3,000 firsthand stories and 1,500 original artifacts (photos, letters and memorabilia) that chronicle Canada's military heritage.<ref>[http://www.thememoryproject.com/stories The Memory Project.] Retrieved 2007-08-10.</ref> Through the online archive and speakers bureau, The Memory Project has reached more than 1.5 million Canadians.\n\n==Passages Canada==\nPassages Canada is a national storytelling initiative that invites newcomers and established Canadians to share their personal experiences of identity, heritage, and immigration with groups of all ages. More than 1,000 volunteers are part of the Passages Canada Speakers' Bureau. These speakers visit schools and community groups across the country to nurture cross-cultural dialogue.\n\nThe Passages Canada Digital Archive presents a portrait of the life experience of the members of the Passages Canada Speakers' Bureau through multilingual interviews and original artifacts (photos, letters and memorabilia) that recount their personal journeys to Canada.\n\n==Learning resources==\nHistorica Canada produces a number of learning tools for educators and students. Some examples include: The Black History in Canada Education Guide, grounded in [[Lawrence Hill]]'s historical fiction novel ''[[The Book of Negroes (novel)|The Book of Negroes]]''; Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] and Confederation learning tools for junior and senior levels, as part of the Stories of Sir John A. program; four guides focused on different aspects of the [[War of 1812]] including the role of Aboriginal peoples and the importance of borders and geography; Canada at War learning tools examine the legacy of both the First and Second World Wars.\n\nHistorica Canada also provides some of its content to the public through iTunes University, where users can browse materials organized in course collections along themes such as Women in Canadian History and Asian-Canadian History.\n\n==Board of directors==\n*Alison Faulknor\n:Director of New Initiatives, [[The National Trust for Canada]]\n\n*Ann Dadson\n:Former President, Historica Canada\n\n*Arni C.

Thomas Professor of Government and Sociology at [[Harvard University]]. An influential figure in both disciplines, Skocpol is best known as an advocate of the [[historical institutionalism|historical-institutional]] and [[comparative sociology|comparative]] approaches, as well as her \"state autonomy theory.\"  She has written widely for both popular and academic audiences.\n\nIn historical sociology, Skocpol's works and opinions have been associated with the structuralist school. As an example, she argues that social revolutions can best be explained given their relation with specific structures of agricultural societies and their respective states. Such an approach differs greatly from more \"behaviorist\" ones, which tend to emphasize the role of \"revolutionary populations,\" \"revolutionary psychology,\" and/or \"revolutionary consciousness,\" as determinant factors of revolutionary processes.\n\nAccording to her profile on the Harvard Department of Sociology website, her current research agenda focuses on \u201cU.S. social policy and civic engagement in American democracy, including changes since the 1960s. She has recently launched new projects on the development of U.S. higher education and on the transformations of U.S. federal policies in the Obama era.\u201d<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/people/theda-skocpol|title=Theda Skocpol|website=sociology.fas.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-15}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nTheda Skocpol was born in [[Detroit, Michigan]] on May 4, 1947.  She earned her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] at [[Michigan State University]] in 1969. She then went on to earn her M.A. (1972), and [[Ph.D.]] at [[Harvard University]] (1975). While attending [[Harvard University]], Skocpol studied with [[Barrington Moore Jr.]]\n\nFrom 1975\u20131981, Skocpol served as an Assistant and Associate Professor of Sociology, at [[Harvard University]]. During this time, Skocpol published her first of many books, ''[[States and Social Revolutions|States and Social Revolutions: A comparative Analysis of Social Revolutions in Russia, France and China]]'' (1979). Some of her subsequent work focused on methodology and theory, including the co-edited volume ''Bringing the State Back In'', which heralded a new focus by social scientists on the [[State (polity)|state]] as an agent of social and political change.\n\nIn 1981, Skocpol moved on to work at the [[University of Chicago]]. For the next five years, Skocpol would serve as an Associate Professor of Sociology and Political Science, and of Social Science, Professor of Sociology and Political Science, and Director for the Center for the Study of Industrial Societies.<ref name=\"Skocpol bio\">{{cite web|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/thedaskocpol/files/skocpol_cv_2009.pdf|title=Theda Skocpol|last1=Skocpol|first1=Theda|date=|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=2016-07-10|ref=7}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Prof. Skocpol publicly alleged that [[Harvard University]] had denied her tenure (1980) because she was a woman. This charge was found to be justified by an internal review committee in 1981.<ref name=\"New York Times - Harvard Controversy\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/18/magazine/a-question-of-sex-bias-at-harvard.html?pagewanted=all|title=A QUESTION OF SEX BIAS AT HARVARD|last=|first=|date=October 18, 1981|website=|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=17 July 2014}}</ref> In 1984, [[Harvard University]] offered Skocpol a tenured position (its first ever for a female sociologist), which she accepted.\n\nFrom 1986 to the present, Skocpol has held various positions at [[Harvard University]] to include: Professor of Sociology; Director for the Center for American Political Studies; Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences; and presently is the Professor of Government and of Sociology, Victor S. Thomas Professor of Government and Sociology.\n\n== Honors and titles ==\nThroughout her career, Skocpol has held many positions at various academic, and professional organizations, some of which include: President of Politics and History Section, Chairperson, and later Council member of the [[American Political Science Association]] (1991\u20131996).  Out of over one hundred past presidents, since 1903, only about ten women have held that office. Skocpol is also Founder and Co-Editor, Princeton Studies in American Politics: Historical, Comparative, and International Perspectives (1993 \u2013 present); and Senior Advisor in the Social Sciences, [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]] (2006\u20132008).\n\nAccording to her [http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/thedaskocpol/files/skocpol_cv_2009.pdf Curriculum Vitae] Skocpol has been distinguished by over twenty awards and honors, some of which are: C. Wright Mills Award of [[The Society for the Study of Social Problems]] in 1979; elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2006; and she was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 2008. Her book ''Protecting Soldiers and Mothers'' (1992) was awarded the 1993 Woodrow Wilson Award for best book in political science by the [[American Political Science Association]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2007, she was awarded the [[Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science]], one of the world's most prestigious prizes in political science for her \"visionary analysis of the significance of the state for revolutions, welfare, and political trust, pursued with theoretical depth and empirical evidence.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Theda Skocpol|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/thedaskocpol/home|website=Theda Skocpol|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=June 26, 2016|ref=10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/kultur/did_14913020.asp|title=SvD: Skocpol g\u00e5r till botten med staten|date=2007-09-29|website=Svenska Dagbladet|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102703/http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/kultur/did_14913020.asp|archive-date=2007-09-29|url-status=bot: unknown|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, she was named an [[Andrew Dickson White]] Professor-at-Large at [[Cornell University]] (term: 2015\u20132021).\n\nIn Oktober 2019 Skocpol was awarded with an honorary doctorate from [[Radboud University]] Nijmegen.\n\n== Major works and contributions ==\n===''States and Social Revolutions (1979)''===\n{{main|States and Social Revolutions}}\n\nSkocpol\u2019s most famous book, ''States and Social Revolutions: A comparative Analysis of Social Revolutions in [[Russian Revolution|Russia]], [[French Revolution|France]] and [[Xinhai Revolution|China]]'' (1979), discusses how most theories account only for direct action in bringing about revolutions. Social Revolutions are fast-paced foundational transformations of society's state and class structures. She includes the structure involved in creating a [[revolutionary situation]] that can lead to a social revolution - one that changes civic institutions and government once the administration and military branches collapse.\n\nIn her text, Skocpol \"offers a framework of reference for analyzing social-revolutionary transformations in modern world history\" and discusses and compares the causes of The \"[[Timeline of the French Revolution|French Revolution]]\" of 1787\u20131800, [[The Russian Revolution]] of 1917\u20131921, and [[Xinhai Revolution|The Chinese Revolution]] of 1911\u20131949.\n\nAccording to Skocpol, there are two stages to social revolutions: a crisis of state and the emergence of a dominant class to take advantage of a revolutionary situation. The crisis of state emerges from poor economy, natural disaster, food shortage, or security concerns. Leaders of the revolution also have to face these constraints, and their handling of them affects how well they re-establish the state.\n\nSkocpol uses Marxism\u2019s class struggle to assert that the main causes of social unrest are state social structures, international competitive pressures, international demonstrations, and class relations. Critics suggest that Skocpol ignores the role of individuals and ideology<ref>{{cite web|last=Wikisum|title=States and Social Revolutions|url=http://wikisum.com/w/Skocpol:_States_and_social_revolutions}}</ref>  and uses varied comparative methodological strategies.\n\n===State Autonomy Theory===\nBefore she wrote'' Protecting Soldiers and Mothers'', Skocpol first devised what she termed State Autonomy Theory.  This theory underlined the idea that state bureaucracies could have the potential for autonomous operations, and that this potential was ignored by scientists who were focused on society-centric studies. Skocpol considers the idea that parties are more important in America than the government, and that class dominance plays heavily into American politics.<ref>Skocpol, Theda, Peter Evans, and Dietrich Rueschemeyer. \"Bringing the state back in.\" Cambridge (1999).</ref>\n\n===''Protecting Soldiers and Mothers (1992)''===\nIn this book, Skocpol considers increased benefits for Civil War veterans and their families resulting from competitive party politics, as well as greater actions taken in women's movements. Soldiers and mothers benefited from social spending, labor regulations, and health education through reformative women's clubs across the nation. Simultaneously, Skocpol refutes her claim that theorists had ignored states' independent power in her state autonomy theory, explaining \"my state-centered theoretical frame of reference had evolved into a fully 'polity-centered approach,' meaning that social movements, coalitions of pressure groups, and political parties must be given their due in understanding power in America.\"\n\nSkocpol explains how clubs and associations fill the vacuum left by fewer bureaucracies and an official church throughout the country, offering a case study in how women succeeded in gaining labor rights, pensions, minimum wage, and subsidized natal health clinics. Further, Skocpol points out that women were able to overcome class disparity to achieve these goals, working at a national level, influencing representatives with books, TV, magazines, and meetings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/theory/skocpol.html|title=The Death of State Autonomy Theory: A Critique of Skocpol's Protecting Soldiers And Mothers|last=Domhoff|first=G. William|date=September 2005|website=Who Rules America|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===''Diminished Democracy (2003)''===\n''Diminished Democracy'' discusses the changes in US public involvement and its recent concerning decline. Skocpol talks about how to reverse it in explaining how the U.S. became a civic nation, the organizers of that movement, management of civic organizations, changes in them, the harmful effects of that change, and how to recreate a sense of citizenship.\n\nSince fewer and fewer Americans join voluntary groups that meet frequently, there has been a proliferation of nonprofit groups led by elites who can interact with the government, but not the people. Dr. Skocpol provokes the reader with the idea that civic involvement will one day become another job rather than a civilian responsibility.\n\n=== Scholars Strategy Network ===\nIn 2009, Skocpol conceived of and co-founded the [[Scholars Strategy Network]], an association of academics and researchers who coordinate to address public challenges while increasing the accessibility of their findings to those outside of [[academia]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/02/environmentalist-failure-to-pass-cap-and-trade#.UR_sYt3N2oc.email|title=The Politics of Climate Change Legislation|date=2013-02-15|work=Harvard Magazine|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://harvardmagazine.com/2014/09/citizen-scholars|title=Citizen Scholars|date=2014-08-15|work=Harvard Magazine|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}</ref> As of 2018, she serves as the network's Director.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scholars.org/scholar/theda-skocpol|title=skocpol.theda {{!}} Scholars Strategy Network|website=scholars.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1967, while studying at [[Michigan State University]], she married [[William Skocpol|Bill Skocpol]], a physicist who taught at [[Boston University]].

Thomas Professor of Government and Sociology at [[Harvard University]]. An influential figure in both disciplines, Skocpol is best known as an advocate of the [[historical institutionalism|historical-institutional]] and [[comparative sociology|comparative]] approaches, as well as her \"state autonomy theory.\"  She has written widely for both popular and academic audiences.\n\nIn historical sociology, Skocpol's works and opinions have been associated with the structuralist school. As an example, she argues that social revolutions can best be explained given their relation with specific structures of agricultural societies and their respective states. Such an approach differs greatly from more \"behaviorist\" ones, which tend to emphasize the role of \"revolutionary populations,\" \"revolutionary psychology,\" and/or \"revolutionary consciousness,\" as determinant factors of revolutionary processes.\n\nAccording to her profile on the Harvard Department of Sociology website, her current research agenda focuses on \u201cU.S. social policy and civic engagement in American democracy, including changes since the 1960s. She has recently launched new projects on the development of U.S. higher education and on the transformations of U.S. federal policies in the Obama era.\u201d<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://sociology.fas.harvard.edu/people/theda-skocpol|title=Theda Skocpol|website=sociology.fas.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-15}}</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nTheda Skocpol was born in [[Detroit, Michigan]] on May 4, 1947.  She earned her [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] at [[Michigan State University]] in 1969. She then went on to earn her M.A. (1972), and [[Ph.D.]] at [[Harvard University]] (1975). While attending [[Harvard University]], Skocpol studied with [[Barrington Moore Jr.]]\n\nFrom 1975\u20131981, Skocpol served as an Assistant and Associate Professor of Sociology, at [[Harvard University]]. During this time, Skocpol published her first of many books, ''[[States and Social Revolutions|States and Social Revolutions: A comparative Analysis of Social Revolutions in Russia, France and China]]'' (1979). Some of her subsequent work focused on methodology and theory, including the co-edited volume ''Bringing the State Back In'', which heralded a new focus by social scientists on the [[State (polity)|state]] as an agent of social and political change.\n\nIn 1981, Skocpol moved on to work at the [[University of Chicago]]. For the next five years, Skocpol would serve as an Associate Professor of Sociology and Political Science, and of Social Science, Professor of Sociology and Political Science, and Director for the Center for the Study of Industrial Societies.<ref name=\"Skocpol bio\">{{cite web|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/thedaskocpol/files/skocpol_cv_2009.pdf|title=Theda Skocpol|last1=Skocpol|first1=Theda|date=|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=2016-07-10|ref=7}}</ref>\n\nIn the early 1980s, Prof. Skocpol publicly alleged that [[Harvard University]] had denied her tenure (1980) because she was a woman. This charge was found to be justified by an internal review committee in 1981.<ref name=\"New York Times - Harvard Controversy\">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/18/magazine/a-question-of-sex-bias-at-harvard.html?pagewanted=all|title=A QUESTION OF SEX BIAS AT HARVARD|last=|first=|date=October 18, 1981|website=|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=17 July 2014}}</ref> In 1984, [[Harvard University]] offered Skocpol a tenured position (its first ever for a female sociologist), which she accepted.\n\nFrom 1986 to the present, Skocpol has held various positions at [[Harvard University]] to include: Professor of Sociology; Director for the Center for American Political Studies; Dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences; and presently is the Professor of Government and of Sociology, Victor S. Thomas Professor of Government and Sociology.\n\n== Honors and titles ==\nThroughout her career, Skocpol has held many positions at various academic, and professional organizations, some of which include: President of Politics and History Section, Chairperson, and later Council member of the [[American Political Science Association]] (1991\u20131996).  Out of over one hundred past presidents, since 1903, only about ten women have held that office. Skocpol is also Founder and Co-Editor, Princeton Studies in American Politics: Historical, Comparative, and International Perspectives (1993 \u2013 present); and Senior Advisor in the Social Sciences, [[Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study]] (2006\u20132008).\n\nAccording to her [http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/thedaskocpol/files/skocpol_cv_2009.pdf Curriculum Vitae] Skocpol has been distinguished by over twenty awards and honors, some of which are: C. Wright Mills Award of [[The Society for the Study of Social Problems]] in 1979; elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2006; and she was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 2008. Her book ''Protecting Soldiers and Mothers'' (1992) was awarded the 1993 Woodrow Wilson Award for best book in political science by the [[American Political Science Association]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 2007, she was awarded the [[Johan Skytte Prize in Political Science]], one of the world's most prestigious prizes in political science for her \"visionary analysis of the significance of the state for revolutions, welfare, and political trust, pursued with theoretical depth and empirical evidence.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Theda Skocpol|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/thedaskocpol/home|website=Theda Skocpol|publisher=Harvard University|accessdate=June 26, 2016|ref=10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/kultur/did_14913020.asp|title=SvD: Skocpol g\u00e5r till botten med staten|date=2007-09-29|website=Svenska Dagbladet|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929102703/http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/kultur/did_14913020.asp|archive-date=2007-09-29|url-status=bot: unknown|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, she was named an [[Andrew Dickson White]] Professor-at-Large at [[Cornell University]] (term: 2015\u20132021).\n\nIn Oktober 2019 Skocpol was awarded with an honorary doctorate from [[Radboud University]] Nijmegen.\n\n== Major works and contributions ==\n===''States and Social Revolutions (1979)''===\n{{main|States and Social Revolutions}}\n\nSkocpol\u2019s most famous book, ''States and Social Revolutions: A comparative Analysis of Social Revolutions in [[Russian Revolution|Russia]], [[French Revolution|France]] and [[Xinhai Revolution|China]]'' (1979), discusses how most theories account only for direct action in bringing about revolutions. Social Revolutions are fast-paced foundational transformations of society's state and class structures. She includes the structure involved in creating a [[revolutionary situation]] that can lead to a social revolution - one that changes civic institutions and government once the administration and military branches collapse.\n\nIn her text, Skocpol \"offers a framework of reference for analyzing social-revolutionary transformations in modern world history\" and discusses and compares the causes of The \"[[Timeline of the French Revolution|French Revolution]]\" of 1787\u20131800, [[The Russian Revolution]] of 1917\u20131921, and [[Xinhai Revolution|The Chinese Revolution]] of 1911\u20131949.\n\nAccording to Skocpol, there are two stages to social revolutions: a crisis of state and the emergence of a dominant class to take advantage of a revolutionary situation. The crisis of state emerges from poor economy, natural disaster, food shortage, or security concerns. Leaders of the revolution also have to face these constraints, and their handling of them affects how well they re-establish the state.\n\nSkocpol uses Marxism\u2019s class struggle to assert that the main causes of social unrest are state social structures, international competitive pressures, international demonstrations, and class relations. Critics suggest that Skocpol ignores the role of individuals and ideology<ref>{{cite web|last=Wikisum|title=States and Social Revolutions|url=http://wikisum.com/w/Skocpol:_States_and_social_revolutions}}</ref>  and uses varied comparative methodological strategies.\n\n===State Autonomy Theory===\nBefore she wrote'' Protecting Soldiers and Mothers'', Skocpol first devised what she termed State Autonomy Theory.  This theory underlined the idea that state bureaucracies could have the potential for autonomous operations, and that this potential was ignored by scientists who were focused on society-centric studies. Skocpol considers the idea that parties are more important in America than the government, and that class dominance plays heavily into American politics.<ref>Skocpol, Theda, Peter Evans, and Dietrich Rueschemeyer. \"Bringing the state back in.\" Cambridge (1999).</ref>\n\n===''Protecting Soldiers and Mothers (1992)''===\nIn this book, Skocpol considers increased benefits for Civil War veterans and their families resulting from competitive party politics, as well as greater actions taken in women's movements. Soldiers and mothers benefited from social spending, labor regulations, and health education through reformative women's clubs across the nation. Simultaneously, Skocpol refutes her claim that theorists had ignored states' independent power in her state autonomy theory, explaining \"my state-centered theoretical frame of reference had evolved into a fully 'polity-centered approach,' meaning that social movements, coalitions of pressure groups, and political parties must be given their due in understanding power in America.\"\n\nSkocpol explains how clubs and associations fill the vacuum left by fewer bureaucracies and an official church throughout the country, offering a case study in how women succeeded in gaining labor rights, pensions, minimum wage, and subsidized natal health clinics. Further, Skocpol points out that women were able to overcome class disparity to achieve these goals, working at a national level, influencing representatives with books, TV, magazines, and meetings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/theory/skocpol.html|title=The Death of State Autonomy Theory: A Critique of Skocpol's Protecting Soldiers And Mothers|last=Domhoff|first=G. William|date=September 2005|website=Who Rules America|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===''Diminished Democracy (2003)''===\n''Diminished Democracy'' discusses the changes in US public involvement and its recent concerning decline. Skocpol talks about how to reverse it in explaining how the U.S. became a civic nation, the organizers of that movement, management of civic organizations, changes in them, the harmful effects of that change, and how to recreate a sense of citizenship.\n\nSince fewer and fewer Americans join voluntary groups that meet frequently, there has been a proliferation of nonprofit groups led by elites who can interact with the government, but not the people. Dr. Skocpol provokes the reader with the idea that civic involvement will one day become another job rather than a civilian responsibility.\n\n=== Scholars Strategy Network ===\nIn 2009, Skocpol conceived of and co-founded the [[Scholars Strategy Network]], an association of academics and researchers who coordinate to address public challenges while increasing the accessibility of their findings to those outside of [[academia]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2013/02/environmentalist-failure-to-pass-cap-and-trade#.UR_sYt3N2oc.email|title=The Politics of Climate Change Legislation|date=2013-02-15|work=Harvard Magazine|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://harvardmagazine.com/2014/09/citizen-scholars|title=Citizen Scholars|date=2014-08-15|work=Harvard Magazine|access-date=2018-11-30|language=en}}</ref> As of 2018, she serves as the network's Director.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scholars.org/scholar/theda-skocpol|title=skocpol.theda {{!}} Scholars Strategy Network|website=scholars.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-30}}</ref>\n\n== Personal life ==\nIn 1967, while studying at [[Michigan State University]], she married [[William Skocpol|Bill Skocpol]], a physicist who taught at [[Boston University]].
