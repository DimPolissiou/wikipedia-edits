With this order, the Hand Ejector Model became known as the .38 Military and Police model.<ref name=\"cumpston2003\">{{cite web|last=Cumpston |first=Mike |title=The First M&P |accessdate=2008-05-02 |url=http://www.gunblast.com/Cumpston_SW-MP.htm |date=2003-01-16 |publisher=Gunblast.com}}</ref> That same year, in response to reports from military sources serving in the Philippines on the relative ineffectiveness of the new cartridge, Smith & Wesson began offering the Military & Police in a new chambering, .38 S&W Special (a.k.a. .38 Special), a slightly elongated version of the .38 Long Colt cartridge with greater bullet weight (158 grains) and powder charge increased from 18 to 21 grains of gunpowder.<ref name=\"cumpston2003\"/>\n\nIn 1902 the .38 Military & Police (2nd Model) was introduced, featuring substantial changes.<ref name=\"supica2001\">{{cite book|last=Supica |first=Jim |author2=Richard Nahas  |title=Standard Catalog of Smith & Wesson |location=Iola Wisconsin |year=2001 |publisher=Krause Publications |page=1068}}</ref> These included major modification and simplification of the internal lockwork and the addition of a locking underlug on the barrel to engage the previously free-standing ejector rod. Barrel lengths were 4-, 5-, 6-, and 6.5-inches with a rounded butt. Serial numbers for the Military & Police ranged from number 1 in the series to 20,975. Most of the early M&P revolvers chambered in .38 Special appear to have been sold to the civilian market.<ref name=\"cumpston2003\"/>  By 1904, S&W was offering the .38 M&P with a rounded or square butt, and 4-, 5-, and 6.5-inch barrels.\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Model 10 snub nose round butt.jpg|thumb|left|S&W Model 10 [[Snubnosed revolver|snubnose]]]]\n[[File:Model10target.jpg|thumb|left|Smith & Wesson 1905 4th change 1915 Target model. \"NRA\" Slow Fire at 25 yards.

The M&P revolver was issued in large numbers during World War I, where it proved itself to be a highly reliable and accurate weapon. Although WWI saw the rise of semi-automatic pistols, revolvers such as the M&P were used in vast numbers as semi-automatic handgun production at the time wasn't sufficient to meet the demand.\n\nAfter the War, the M&P would become the standard issue police sidearm for the next 70 years. It would also become very popular with civilian shooters, with several new models being made, including the first [[Snubnosed revolver|snubnosed]] 2-, 2.5- and 3-barrel models being made in 1936.<ref name=\"supica2001\"/><ref>http://sportsmansvintagepress.com/read-free/smith-wesson-hand-guns/sw-terrier/ Smith & Wesson did not succumb to the fad for short-barreled revolvers until 1936, when the firm brought out what was termed the \"S&W .38/32 2\u2033,\" later christened the \"Terrier\" which was simply the round butt Regulation Police Model with a two-inch barrel.</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nThe S&W M&P military revolvers produced from 1942 to 1944 had serial numbers with a \"V\" prefix, and were known as the '''Smith & Wesson Victory Model'''. Early Victory Models did not always have the V prefix. During World War II over 570,000 of these pistols were supplied to the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa under the [[Lend-Lease]] program, chambered in the British [[.38-200|.38/200]] caliber already in use in the [[Enfield No. 2|Enfield No 2 Mk I Revolver]] and the [[Webley Revolver|Webley Mk IV Revolver]].  Most Victory Models sent to Britain were fitted with 4-inch or 5-inch barrels, although a few early versions had 6-inch barrels.<ref>Shore, C. (Capt), ''With British Snipers to the Reich'', Paladin Press (1988), p. 55</ref><ref>Dunlap, Roy, ''Ordnance Went Up Front'', Samworth Press (1948), p. 142</ref>\n\nThe Victory Model was used by United States forces during World War II, being chambered in the well-known and popular [[.38 Special]] cartridge.  The Victory Model was a standard-issue sidearm for United States Navy and Marine Corps aircrews, and was also used by security guards at factories and defense installations throughout the United States during the war.<ref name=\"Ayoob2010\">{{cite book|last=Ayoob|first=Massad|authorlink=Massad Ayoob|title=Massad Ayoob's Greatest Handguns of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OAeBNnV3m-cC&pg=PA71|date=15 March 2010|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-1503-2|page=71}}</ref>\n\nSome of these revolvers remained in service well into the 1990s with units of the United States Armed Forces, including the [[United States Air Force]] and the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]].  Until the introduction of the [[Beretta M9]] 9mm pistol in 1990, U.S. Army helicopter crew members and female [[military police]] officers were equipped with .38 caliber Victory Model revolvers.  [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Criminal Investigation Division]] agents were issued .38 caliber revolvers with two inch barrels. The Victory Model remained in use with Air National Guard tanker and transport crews as late as [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991, and with [[United States Navy]] security personnel until 1995.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nSome Lend-Lease Victory Model revolvers originally chambered for the British .38/200 were returned to the United States and rechambered to fire the more popular and more powerful .38 Special ammunition, and such revolvers are usually so marked on their barrels. Rechambering of .38-200 cylinders to .38 Special results in oversized chambers, which may cause problems.  [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was carrying a re-chambered Victory Model when he was apprehended on November 22, 1963.<ref name=\"Martin2010\">{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Orlando|title=JFK.

Other distinguishing features of the Victory Model revolver are the lanyard loop at the bottom of the grip frame, and the use of smooth (rather than checkered) walnut grip panels. However some early models did use a checkered grip, most notably the pre-1942 manufacture.<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Hunter | first = Hunter | year = 2009 | title = S&W Victory & Colt Commando Revolvers | journal = American Rifleman | volume = 157| issue= 6 | pages = 36\u201337 | issn = 0003-083X}}</ref>\n\n===Model 10===\nAfter World War II, Smith & Wesson returned to manufacturing the M&P series. Along with cosmetic changes and replacement of the frame fitting grip with the Magna stocks, the spring-loaded hammer block safety gave way to a cam-actuated hammer block that rode in a channel in the side plate (Smith 1968). In 1957, Smith & Wesson adopted the convention of using numeric designations to distinguish their various models of handguns, and the M&P was renamed the '''Model 10'''.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nThe M&P/Model 10 has been available in both blued steel finish and nickel finish for most of its production run. The model has also been offered throughout the years with both the round butt and square butt grip patterns. Beginning with the Model 10-5 series in the late 1960s, the tapered barrel and its trademark 'half moon' front sight (as shown in the illustrations on this page) were replaced by a straight bull barrel and a sloped milled ramp front sight.

In production since 1899, the Model 10 is a six-shot, [[.38 Special]], double-action revolver with fixed sights.

With this order, the Hand Ejector Model became known as the .38 Military and Police model.<ref name=\"cumpston2003\">{{cite web|last=Cumpston |first=Mike |title=The First M&P |accessdate=2008-05-02 |url=http://www.gunblast.com/Cumpston_SW-MP.htm |date=2003-01-16 |publisher=Gunblast.com}}</ref> That same year, in response to reports from military sources serving in the Philippines on the relative ineffectiveness of the new cartridge, Smith & Wesson began offering the Military & Police in a new chambering, .38 S&W Special (a.k.a. .38 Special), a slightly elongated version of the .38 Long Colt cartridge with greater bullet weight (158 grains) and powder charge increased from 18 to 21 grains of gunpowder.<ref name=\"cumpston2003\"/>\n\nIn 1902 the .38 Military & Police (2nd Model) was introduced, featuring substantial changes.<ref name=\"supica2001\">{{cite book|last=Supica |first=Jim |author2=Richard Nahas  |title=Standard Catalog of Smith & Wesson |location=Iola Wisconsin |year=2001 |publisher=Krause Publications |page=1068}}</ref> These included major modification and simplification of the internal lockwork and the addition of a locking underlug on the barrel to engage the previously free-standing ejector rod. Barrel lengths were 4-, 5-, 6-, and 6.5-inches with a rounded butt. Serial numbers for the Military & Police ranged from number 1 in the series to 20,975. Most of the early M&P revolvers chambered in .38 Special appear to have been sold to the civilian market.<ref name=\"cumpston2003\"/>  By 1904, S&W was offering the .38 M&P with a rounded or square butt, and 4-, 5-, and 6.5-inch barrels.\n\n===World War I===\n[[File:Model 10 snub nose round butt.jpg|thumb|left|S&W Model 10 [[Snubnosed revolver|snubnose]]]]\n[[File:Model10target.jpg|thumb|left|Smith & Wesson 1905 4th change 1915 Target model. \"NRA\" Slow Fire at 25 yards.

The M&P revolver was issued in large numbers during World War I, where it proved itself to be a highly reliable and accurate weapon. Although WWI saw the rise of semi-automatic pistols, revolvers such as the M&P were used in vast numbers as semi-automatic handgun production at the time wasn't sufficient to meet the demand.\n\nAfter the War, the M&P would become the standard issue police sidearm for the next 70 years. It would also become very popular with civilian shooters, with several new models being made, including the first [[Snubnosed revolver|snubnosed]] 2-, 2.5- and 3-barrel models being made in 1936.<ref name=\"supica2001\"/><ref>http://sportsmansvintagepress.com/read-free/smith-wesson-hand-guns/sw-terrier/ Smith & Wesson did not succumb to the fad for short-barreled revolvers until 1936, when the firm brought out what was termed the \"S&W .38/32 2\u2033,\" later christened the \"Terrier\" which was simply the round butt Regulation Police Model with a two-inch barrel.</ref>\n\n===World War II===\nThe S&W M&P military revolvers produced from 1942 to 1944 had serial numbers with a \"V\" prefix, and were known as the '''Smith & Wesson Victory Model'''. Early Victory Models did not always have the V prefix. During World War II over 570,000 of these pistols were supplied to the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa under the [[Lend-Lease]] program, chambered in the British [[.38-200|.38/200]] caliber already in use in the [[Enfield No. 2|Enfield No 2 Mk I Revolver]] and the [[Webley Revolver|Webley Mk IV Revolver]].  Most Victory Models sent to Britain were fitted with 4-inch or 5-inch barrels, although a few early versions had 6-inch barrels.<ref>Shore, C. (Capt), ''With British Snipers to the Reich'', Paladin Press (1988), p. 55</ref><ref>Dunlap, Roy, ''Ordnance Went Up Front'', Samworth Press (1948), p. 142</ref>\n\nThe Victory Model was used by United States forces during World War II, being chambered in the well-known and popular [[.38 Special]] cartridge.  The Victory Model was a standard-issue sidearm for United States Navy and Marine Corps aircrews, and was also used by security guards at factories and defense installations throughout the United States during the war.<ref name=\"Ayoob2010\">{{cite book|last=Ayoob|first=Massad|authorlink=Massad Ayoob|title=Massad Ayoob's Greatest Handguns of the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OAeBNnV3m-cC&pg=PA71|date=15 March 2010|publisher=Gun Digest Books|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-1-4402-1503-2|page=71}}</ref>\n\nSome of these revolvers remained in service well into the 1990s with units of the United States Armed Forces, including the [[United States Air Force]] and the [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]].  Until the introduction of the [[Beretta M9]] 9mm pistol in 1990, U.S. Army helicopter crew members and female [[military police]] officers were equipped with .38 caliber Victory Model revolvers.  [[United States Army Criminal Investigation Command|Criminal Investigation Division]] agents were issued .38 caliber revolvers with two inch barrels. The Victory Model remained in use with Air National Guard tanker and transport crews as late as [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991, and with [[United States Navy]] security personnel until 1995.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nSome Lend-Lease Victory Model revolvers originally chambered for the British .38/200 were returned to the United States and rechambered to fire the more popular and more powerful .38 Special ammunition, and such revolvers are usually so marked on their barrels. Rechambering of .38-200 cylinders to .38 Special results in oversized chambers, which may cause problems.  [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] was carrying a re-chambered Victory Model when he was apprehended on November 22, 1963.<ref name=\"Martin2010\">{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Orlando|title=JFK.

Other distinguishing features of the Victory Model revolver are the lanyard loop at the bottom of the grip frame, and the use of smooth (rather than checkered) walnut grip panels. However some early models did use a checkered grip, most notably the pre-1942 manufacture.<ref>{{Cite journal| last = Hunter | first = Hunter | year = 2009 | title = S&W Victory & Colt Commando Revolvers | journal = American Rifleman | volume = 157| issue= 6 | pages = 36\u201337 | issn = 0003-083X}}</ref>\n\n===Model 10===\nAfter World War II, Smith & Wesson returned to manufacturing the M&P series. Along with cosmetic changes and replacement of the frame fitting grip with the Magna stocks, the spring-loaded hammer block safety gave way to a cam-actuated hammer block that rode in a channel in the side plate (Smith 1968). In 1957, Smith & Wesson adopted the convention of using numeric designations to distinguish their various models of handguns, and the M&P was renamed the '''Model 10'''.<ref name=\"SupicaNahas2007\"/>\n\nThe M&P/Model 10 has been available in both blued steel finish and nickel finish for most of its production run. The model has also been offered throughout the years with both the round butt and square butt grip patterns. Beginning with the Model 10-5 series in the late 1960s, the tapered barrel and its trademark 'half moon' front sight (as shown in the illustrations on this page) were replaced by a straight bull barrel and a sloped milled ramp front sight.

Until the twentieth century, [[Mexico]] was an overwhelmingly rural country, with rural [[women]]'s status defined within the context of the family and local community.  With urbanization beginning in the sixteenth century, following the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire]], cities have provided economic and social opportunities not possible within rural villages. [[Roman Catholicism in Mexico]] has shaped societal attitudes about women's social role, emphasizing the role of women as nurturers of the family, with the [[Virgin Mary]] as a model. [[Marianismo]] has been an ideal, with women's role as being within the family under the authority of men. In the twentieth century, Mexican women made great strides towards a more equal legal and social status. In 1953 women in Mexico were granted the right to vote in national elections.\n\nUrban women in Mexico worked in factories, the earliest being the tobacco factories set up in major Mexican cities as part of the lucrative tobacco monopoly. Women ran a variety of enterprises in the colonial era, with the widows of elite businessmen continuing to run the family business.  In the prehispanic and colonial periods, non-elite women were small-scale sellers in markets.  In the late nineteenth century, as Mexico allowed foreign investment in industrial enterprises, women found increased opportunities to work outside the home. Women can now be seen working in factories, portable food carts, and owning their own business. \u201cIn 1910, women made up 14% of the workforce, by 2008 they were 38%\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article1922|title=Mexican women - then and now - International Viewpoint - online socialist magazine|website=www.internationalviewpoint.org|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref>\n\nMexican women face discrimination and at times harassment from the men exercising [[machismo]] against them. Although women in Mexico are making great advances, they are faced with the traditional expectation of being the head of the household. Researcher Margarita Vald\u00e9s noted that while there are few inequities imposed by law or policy in Mexico, gender inequalities perpetuated by social structures and Mexican cultural expectations limit the capabilities of Mexican women.<ref name=capabilities>{{cite book|last=Vald\u00e9s|first=Margarita M.|title=Inequality in capabilities between men and women in Mexico.|year=1995|pages=426\u2013433|editor=Nussbaum M. e Glover J.}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2014, Mexico has the 16th highest female homicide rate in the world.<ref name=femicide/>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Pre-Columbian societies===\n\n====Maya====\n{{See also|Women in Maya Society}}\nThe Mayan civilization was initially established during the Pre-Classic period (c. 2000 BC to 250 AD). According to the consensus [[Mesoamerican chronology|chronology of Mesoamerica]], many Mayan cities reached their highest state of development during the Classical period (c. 250 to 900 AD), and continued throughout the post-Classical period until the arrival of the Spanish in 1519 AD. Women within Mayan society were limited in regards to status, marriage, and inheritance. In all pre-Columbian societies, marriage was the ideal state for women beyond the age of puberty. Noble women were often married to the rulers of neighboring kingdoms, thus creating dynastic alliances<ref name=\"Socolow, S. M. 2000\">Socolow, S. M. (2000). The women of colonial Latin America. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nAlthough the majority of these women had few political responsibilities, they were vital to the political fabric of the state.{{dubious|date=June 2014}}<ref name=\"Socolow, S.

They owned what could be termed feminine goods which included household objects, domestic animals, beehives, and their own clothing.<ref name=\"Socolow, S. M. 2000\"/> Women could bequeath their property, but it was gender specific and was usually not of much value.<ref name=\"Socolow, S. M. 2000\"/>\n\n====Aztec====\n{{See also|Women in Aztec civilization}}\nThe word 'Aztec' refers to certain ethnic groups of central [[Mexico]], particularly those groups who spoke the [[N\u00e1huatl language]] and who dominated large parts of [[Mesoamerica]] from the 1300 A.D. to 1500 A.D. Women within Aztec society were groomed from birth to be wives and mothers and to produce tribute goods that each household owed. Each girl was given small spindles and shuttles to symbolize her future role in household production.<ref name=\"Socolow, S. M. 2000\"/> Her umbilical cord was buried near the fireplace of her house in the hope that she would be a good keeper of the home.<ref name=\"Socolow, S.

M. 2000\"/> Girls were married soon after reaching puberty<ref name=\"Socolow, S. M. 2000\"/> as marriage was the ideal state for women. It is estimated that as many as ninety-five percent of indigenous women were married.<ref name=\"Socolow, S. M. 2000\"/> Couples were expected to stay together, however Aztec society did recognize divorce, with each partner retaining their own property brought into the marriage after divorce.<ref name=\"Socolow, S.

Although women were allowed to inherit property, their rights to it were more to usage rights.<ref name=\"Kellogg, Susan 1986\">Kellogg, Susan. (1986).

Although often overlooked in the history of the conquest, individual women facilitated the defeat of the powerful Aztec Empire. Women possessed knowledge of the land and the local language. One of the most notable women who assisted Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s during the conquest period of Mexico was [[Do\u00f1a Marina]], or Malinche, who knew both the [[Nahuatl]] and [[Mayan language]] and later learned Spanish.<ref name=\"Alves\">{{cite book |last=Alves |first=A. A. |year=1996 |title=''Brutality and benevolence: Human ethology, culture, and the birth of Mexico''. |publisher=Greenwood Press, Westwood, Conn. |page= 71}}</ref>\n\nBorn a Nahua, or an Aztec, Marina was sold into slavery by her own people to the Mayans and eventually was given to Cort\u00e9s as a payment of tribute. To Cort\u00e9s, Do\u00f1a Marina was a valuable asset in overthrowing the Aztec empire based in [[Tenochtitl\u00e1n]] (now Mexico City) and was always seen at his side, even during battles with the Aztecs and Mayans.<ref name=\"Alves\"/>\n\nMalinche had become the translator and the mistress of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. No matter how useful Do\u00f1a Marina was to Cort\u00e9s, he was \u201creluctant to give Do\u00f1a Marina credit, referring to her as \u2018my interpreter, who is an Indian woman\u2019\u201d. During the conquest women were viewed as objects that could be exploited by men to gain a higher standing in society. Malinche was considered a spoil of conquest to the males surrounding her and originally intended to sexually please the soldiers.<ref>Alves, A. A. (1996). Brutality and benevolence: Human ethology, culture, and the birth of Mexico. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press. Pg 72</ref>\n\nJust like Malinche, many women were offered to the conquistadors as an offering because both cultures viewed females as objects to be presented to others.<ref>Tu\u00f1\u00f3n, J.

Austin: University of Texas Press, Institute of Latin American Studies, p 16.</ref> Since few women traveled to the New World, native females were considered a treasure that needed to be Christianized. It is believed that there were ulterior motives in the Christianization of indigenous individuals, especially women.

[[Luis de Mena]], Virgin of Guadalupe and castas, 1750.]]\n\nThe division of social classes was essential and such divisions were expressed through the attire worn by individuals. Elite and upper class women could afford expensive textiles imported from Spain. Due to the strong system of racial hierarchy, known as the ''sistema de [[castas]]'', women tended to dress in accordance with their level of wealth and racial status. The racial hierarchy divided society first through separating the ''Rep\u00fablica de Espa\u00f1oles'', which was the Hispanic sphere encompassing Spaniards, (Espa\u00f1oles) both peninsular- and American-born; ''[[Mestizos]]'' (mixed Espa\u00f1ol and Indian); ''Mulatos'' (mixed Negro and Espa\u00f1ol); ''Negros'' (Africans); and offspring of further mixed-race pairings.<ref>Ilarione, ., Miller, R.

Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, p 92.</ref> Regardless of the social status of Indian women, she would dress in compliance with Indian customs. Wealthy females were able to purchase superior materials for clothing.\n\nThe importance placed upon social class caused purity of blood to become a factor in regards to marriage. Women were affected by these policies as it was required for both men and women to submit documents proving their blood purity. European men sought elite Mexican women to marry and have children with, in order to retain or gain a higher status in society. Problems that occurred with providing documentation in blood purity are that males were the ones who were called as a witness. Women rarely were able to defend their purity and had to rely on men from the community.<ref>Mart\u00ednez, M. E. (2008). Genealogical fictions: Limpieza de sangre, religion, and gender in colonial Mexico. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, p 174</ref>\n\nRegardless of social class, women in eighteenth century Mexico City usually married for the first time between the ages of 17 and 27, with a median age of 20.5 years. Women were inclined to marry individuals belonging to the same social group as their fathers.<ref>Socolow, S. M. (2000). The women of colonial Latin America. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p 61</ref>\n\nEducation for women was surrounded by religion. Individuals believed that girls should be educated enough to read the bible and religious devotionals, but should not be taught to write. When girls were provided with an education, they would live in convents and be instructed by nuns, with education being significantly limited. Of all the women who sought entry into Mexico City's convent of Corpus Christi, only 10 percent of elite Indian women had a formal education.<ref>Socolow, S. M. (2000).

It began with the [[Grito de Dolores]] on September 16 of 1810 and officially ended on September 27 of 1821 when Spanish rule collapse and the [[Army of the Three Guarantees]] marched into [[Mexico City]]. Women participated in the [[Mexican War of Independence]], most famously [[Josefa Ortiz de Dom\u00ednguez]], known in Mexican history as ''La Corregidora''.  Her remains were moved to the Monument to Independence in Mexico City; there are statues of her in her honor, and her face has appeared on Mexican currency. Other distinguished women of the era are [[Gertrudis Bocanegra]], [[Mar\u00eda Luisa Mart\u00ednez de Garc\u00eda Rojas]], [[Manuela Medina]], [[Rita P\u00e9rez de Moreno]], [[Maria Fermina Rivera]], [[Mar\u00eda Ignacia Rodr\u00edguez de Velasco y Osorio Barba]], known as the ''G\u00fcera Rodr\u00edguez''; and [[Leona Vicario]].\n\nFollowing independence, some women in Zacatecas raised the question of citizenship for women. They petitioned for it, saying \"women also wish to have the title of citizen .. to see ourselves in the census as 'La ciudadana' (woman citizen).\"<ref>quoted in Miller, Francesca. \"Feminism and Feminist Organizations\" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 2, p. 551. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.</ref>  Independence affected women in both positive and negatives ways. Prior to the independence, women were only allowed to act as their children's guardians until the age of seven in cases of separation of widowhood. Post-independence laws allowed women to serve as guardians until the age of majority.<ref name=\"Connor, Erin E. 2014\">O\u2019Connor, Erin E. (2014). Mothers Making Latin America.

Liberal Reform and Porfiriato 1850-1910===\n[[File:Laureana Wright de Kleinhans.JPG|thumb|[[Laureana Wright de Kleinhans]], considered the most brilliant and radical defender of women's emancipation.]]\nAs with Liberalism elsewhere, [[Liberalism in Mexico]] emphasized secular education as a path forward toward equality before the law. In the colonial era, there were limited opportunities for Mexican girls and women, but with the establishment of secular schools in the middle of the nineteenth century, girls had greater access to education, while women entered the teaching profession. Quite a number of them became advocates for women's rights, becoming active in politics, founding journals and newspapers, and attending international conferences for women's rights. Women teachers were part of the new middle class in Mexico, which also included women office workers in the private sector and government.  Women also became involved in general improvement in society, including better hygiene and nutrition. Toward the end of the [[Porfiriato]], the period when General [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] ruled Mexico (1876-1910), women began pressing for legal equality and the right to vote.  The largest sector of Mexico's population was rural and indigenous or mixed-race, so that the movement for women's equality was carried forward by a very small sector of educated, urban women.<ref>Miller, \"Feminism and Femimist Organizations\", p. 550</ref>\n\n===Mexican Revolution and its Consolidation, 1910-40===\n{{See also|Soldaderas|Feminism in Mexico|Women's suffrage in Mexico}}\n[[Image:Las adelitas.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Depiction of \u00abadelitas\u00bb, or [[Soldaderas]], of the Mexican revolution.]]\nThe [[Mexican revolution]] began in 1910 with an uprising led by [[Francisco I. Madero]] against the longstanding regime of [[Porfirio Diaz]]. The military phase is generally considered to have lasted through 1920. Most often it is the case that women involved in war are overlooked. Although the revolution is attributed to men, it is important to note the dedication and participation women contributed, just as much as their male counterparts. Poor mestiza and indigenous women had a strong presence in the revolutionary conflict becoming camp followers often referred to in Mexico as [[soldaderas]].<ref name=\"Connor, Erin E. 2014\"/> [[Nellie Campobello]] was one of the few women to write a first-person account of the Mexican Revolution, ''Cartucho''.\n\nMost often, these women followed the army when a male relative joined and provided essential services such as food preparation, tending to the wounded, mending clothing, burying the dead, and retrieval of items from the battlefield.<ref name=\"Connor, Erin E. 2014\"/> Women involved in the revolution were just as laden if not more so than men, carrying food, cooking supplies, and bedding.<ref name=\"Connor, Erin E. 2014\"/> Many soldaderas took their children with them, often because their husband had joined or been conscripted into the army. In 1914, a count of [[Pancho Villa]]\u2019s forces included 4,557 male soldiers, 1,256 soldaderas, and 554 children many of whom were babies or toddlers strapped to their mother\u2019s backs.<ref name=\"Connor, Erin E. 2014\"/> Many women picked up arms and joined in combat alongside men, often when a male comrade, their husband or brother had fallen.<ref name=\"Connor, Erin E. 2014\"/>\n\n[[File:Elena_Arizmendi_ca_1916.PNG|right|250px|thumb|A Mexican feminist who established the [[Neutral White Cross]] organisation during the Mexican Revolution.]]\nThere were also many cases of women who fought in the revolution disguised as men, however most returned to female identities once the conflict had ended.<ref name=\"Connor, Erin E. 2014\"/> The lasting impacts of the revolution have proved mixed at best. The revolution promised reforms and greater rights for women to one extent or another, but failed to live up to its promises. Thousands of women fought in the battles and provided necessary services to the armies, however their contributions have largely been forgotten and viewed as merely supportive.<ref name=\"Connor, Erin E. 2014\"/>\n\nThere had been agitation for [[women's suffrage]] in Mexico in the late nineteenth century, and both [[Francisco Madero]] and [[Venustiano Carranza]] were sympathetic to women's issues, both having female private secretaries who influenced their thinking on the matter.<ref>Wade M.

The idea soon grew into an unprecedented and inspiring movement. On March 9 2020, Mexican women will leave their workplaces to show, in a powerful display of solidarity, what the country would be like without them.\n\nIn what has been called a galling display of cruelty and indolence, Mexico\u2019s president [[Lopez Obrador]] has disparaged the fight against gender-based violence. He has questioned its motives, accused the movement of being a front set up by his \u201cconservative\u201d opponents for nefarious reasons and expressed concern for the doors and walls spray-painted by the protesters rather than focusing on the movement\u2019s urgent demands. In February, after protesters spray-painted slogans against gender-based violence over the facade of the [[National Palace]], President L\u00f3pez Obrador asked the feminist groups staging the action to refrain from \u201cpainting the doors\u201d of the building, in which he lives and works.\n\nAs of the end of January 2020, 40,299 Mexicans had been killed since Mexico\u2019s president L\u00f3pez Obrador took office on Dec. 1, 2018.

As Mexico became more urban and industrialized, the government formulated and implemented family planning policies in the 1970s and 80s that aimed at educating Mexicans about the advantages of controlling fertility.<ref>Soto Laveaga, \u201cLet\u2019s Become Fewer\u201d p. 19</ref> A key component of the educational campaign was the creation of [[telenovelas]] (soap operas) that conveyed the government's message about the virtues of family planning.  Mexico pioneered the use of soap operas to shape public attitudes on sensitive issues in a format both accessible and enjoyable to a wide range of viewers.<ref>Miguel Sabido, ''Towards the social use of soap operas.''

It is the second most populated nation in Latin America. The population trend is even expected to grow in size in a little over thirty years. With a population that keeps increasing it was the first nation in 1973 to establish a family planning program. It is called MEXFAM (The Mexican Family Planning Association); the program has been recorded to have decreased Mexican households from 7.2 children to 2.4 in 1999.<ref name=\"d.umn.edu\">Birth Control & Mexico.

Approximately 25% of Mexican women live in rural areas, and of that, only 44% of those use birth control, and their fertility rate, 4.7%, is almost twice that of urban women.\u201d<ref name=\"d.umn.edu\"/>  Mexico was even able to incorporate a sexual education program in the schools to educate on contraception, but with many young girls living in rural areas, they are usually not able to attend.\n\n===Sexuality===\n{{Main|Miss Mexico Organization|Mexicana Universal}}\n{{See also|Nena von Schlebr\u00fcgge|Elsa Ben\u00edtez|Laura Z\u00fa\u00f1iga|Liliana Dom\u00ednguez|Alta\u00edr Jarabo|Ninel Conde}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Miss_Mexico,_Vanessa_Ponce_in_2018.jpg|'''[[Miss World 2018]]'''<br />[[Vanessa Ponce]] \nFile:Ximena Navarrete - Miss Universe 2010.jpg|'''[[Miss Universe 2010]]'''<br />[[Ximena Navarrete]]\nFile:Miss Mexico 08 Anagabriela Espinoza.jpg|'''[[Miss International 2009]]'''<br />[[Anagabriela Espinoza]]\nFile:Lupita_Jones.jpg|'''[[Miss Universe 1991]]'''<br />[[Lupita Jones]]\n</gallery>\n\nThere are still persisting inequalities between levels of sexual experience between females and males.

Until the twentieth century, [[Mexico]] was an overwhelmingly rural country, with rural [[women]]'s status defined within the context of the family and local community.  With urbanization beginning in the sixteenth century, following the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec empire]], cities have provided economic and social opportunities not possible within rural villages. [[Roman Catholicism in Mexico]] has shaped societal attitudes about women's social role, emphasizing the role of women as nurturers of the family, with the [[Virgin Mary]] as a model. [[Marianismo]] has been an ideal, with women's role as being within the family under the authority of men. In the twentieth century, Mexican women made great strides towards a more equal legal and social status. In 1953 women in Mexico were granted the right to vote in national elections.\n\nUrban women in Mexico worked in factories, the earliest being the tobacco factories set up in major Mexican cities as part of the lucrative tobacco monopoly. Women ran a variety of enterprises in the colonial era, with the widows of elite businessmen continuing to run the family business.  In the prehispanic and colonial periods, non-elite women were small-scale sellers in markets.  In the late nineteenth century, as Mexico allowed foreign investment in industrial enterprises, women found increased opportunities to work outside the home. Women can now be seen working in factories, portable food carts, and owning their own business. \u201cIn 1910, women made up 14% of the workforce, by 2008 they were 38%\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.internationalviewpoint.org/spip.php?article1922|title=Mexican women - then and now - International Viewpoint - online socialist magazine|website=www.internationalviewpoint.org|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref>\n\nMexican women face discrimination and at times harassment from the men exercising [[machismo]] against them. Although women in Mexico are making great advances, they are faced with the traditional expectation of being the head of the household. Researcher Margarita Vald\u00e9s noted that while there are few inequities imposed by law or policy in Mexico, gender inequalities perpetuated by social structures and Mexican cultural expectations limit the capabilities of Mexican women.<ref name=capabilities>{{cite book|last=Vald\u00e9s|first=Margarita M.|title=Inequality in capabilities between men and women in Mexico.|year=1995|pages=426\u2013433|editor=Nussbaum M. e Glover J.}}</ref>\n\nAs of 2014, Mexico has the 16th highest female homicide rate in the world.<ref name=femicide/>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Pre-Columbian societies===\n\n====Maya====\n{{See also|Women in Maya Society}}\nThe Mayan civilization was initially established during the Pre-Classic period (c. 2000 BC to 250 AD). According to the consensus [[Mesoamerican chronology|chronology of Mesoamerica]], many Mayan cities reached their highest state of development during the Classical period (c. 250 to 900 AD), and continued throughout the post-Classical period until the arrival of the Spanish in 1519 AD. Women within Mayan society were limited in regards to status, marriage, and inheritance. In all pre-Columbian societies, marriage was the ideal state for women beyond the age of puberty. Noble women were often married to the rulers of neighboring kingdoms, thus creating dynastic alliances<ref name=\"Socolow, S. M. 2000\">Socolow, S. M. (2000). The women of colonial Latin America. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press.</ref>\n\nAlthough the majority of these women had few political responsibilities, they were vital to the political fabric of the state.{{dubious|date=June 2014}}<ref name=\"Socolow, S. M. 2000\"/>  Elite women enjoyed a high status within their society and were sometimes rulers of city states.<ref name=\"Socolow, S.

They owned what could be termed feminine goods which included household objects, domestic animals, beehives, and their own clothing.<ref name=\"Socolow, S. M. 2000\"/> Women could bequeath their property, but it was gender specific and was usually not of much value.<ref name=\"Socolow, S. M. 2000\"/>\n\n====Aztec====\n{{See also|Women in Aztec civilization}}\nThe word 'Aztec' refers to certain ethnic groups of central [[Mexico]], particularly those groups who spoke the [[N\u00e1huatl language]] and who dominated large parts of [[Mesoamerica]] from the 1300 A.D. to 1500 A.D. Women within Aztec society were groomed from birth to be wives and mothers and to produce tribute goods that each household owed. Each girl was given small spindles and shuttles to symbolize her future role in household production.<ref name=\"Socolow, S. M. 2000\"/> Her umbilical cord was buried near the fireplace of her house in the hope that she would be a good keeper of the home.<ref name=\"Socolow, S. M. 2000\"/>\n\nGrowing up, unmarried girls were expected to be virgins and were closely chaperoned to ensure their virginity stayed intact until their marriage.<ref name=\"Socolow, S. M. 2000\"/> Girls were married soon after reaching puberty<ref name=\"Socolow, S. M. 2000\"/> as marriage was the ideal state for women. It is estimated that as many as ninety-five percent of indigenous women were married.<ref name=\"Socolow, S. M. 2000\"/> Couples were expected to stay together, however Aztec society did recognize divorce, with each partner retaining their own property brought into the marriage after divorce.<ref name=\"Socolow, S. M. 2000\"/>\n\nSimilar to Mayan society, Aztec noblewomen had little choice in their marriage as it was a matter of state policy to create alliances.<ref name=\"Socolow, S. M. 2000\"/> In regards to inheritance and property rights, Aztec women were severely limited. Although women were allowed to inherit property, their rights to it were more to usage rights.<ref name=\"Kellogg, Susan 1986\">Kellogg, Susan. (1986).

Although often overlooked in the history of the conquest, individual women facilitated the defeat of the powerful Aztec Empire. Women possessed knowledge of the land and the local language. One of the most notable women who assisted Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s during the conquest period of Mexico was [[Do\u00f1a Marina]], or Malinche, who knew both the [[Nahuatl]] and [[Mayan language]] and later learned Spanish.<ref name=\"Alves\">{{cite book |last=Alves |first=A. A. |year=1996 |title=''Brutality and benevolence: Human ethology, culture, and the birth of Mexico''. |publisher=Greenwood Press, Westwood, Conn. |page= 71}}</ref>\n\nBorn a Nahua, or an Aztec, Marina was sold into slavery by her own people to the Mayans and eventually was given to Cort\u00e9s as a payment of tribute. To Cort\u00e9s, Do\u00f1a Marina was a valuable asset in overthrowing the Aztec empire based in [[Tenochtitl\u00e1n]] (now Mexico City) and was always seen at his side, even during battles with the Aztecs and Mayans.<ref name=\"Alves\"/>\n\nMalinche had become the translator and the mistress of Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s. No matter how useful Do\u00f1a Marina was to Cort\u00e9s, he was \u201creluctant to give Do\u00f1a Marina credit, referring to her as \u2018my interpreter, who is an Indian woman\u2019\u201d. During the conquest women were viewed as objects that could be exploited by men to gain a higher standing in society. Malinche was considered a spoil of conquest to the males surrounding her and originally intended to sexually please the soldiers.<ref>Alves, A. A. (1996). Brutality and benevolence: Human ethology, culture, and the birth of Mexico. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press. Pg 72</ref>\n\nJust like Malinche, many women were offered to the conquistadors as an offering because both cultures viewed females as objects to be presented to others.<ref>Tu\u00f1\u00f3n, J. (1999). Women in Mexico: A past unveiled. Austin: University of Texas Press, Institute of Latin American Studies, p 16.</ref> Since few women traveled to the New World, native females were considered a treasure that needed to be Christianized. It is believed that there were ulterior motives in the Christianization of indigenous individuals, especially women. Conquistadores were quick to convert the women and distribute them amongst themselves.<ref>Alves, A. A. (1996). Brutality and benevolence: Human ethology, culture, and the birth of Mexico.

[[Luis de Mena]], Virgin of Guadalupe and castas, 1750.]]\n\nThe division of social classes was essential and such divisions were expressed through the attire worn by individuals. Elite and upper class women could afford expensive textiles imported from Spain. Due to the strong system of racial hierarchy, known as the ''sistema de [[castas]]'', women tended to dress in accordance with their level of wealth and racial status. The racial hierarchy divided society first through separating the ''Rep\u00fablica de Espa\u00f1oles'', which was the Hispanic sphere encompassing Spaniards, (Espa\u00f1oles) both peninsular- and American-born; ''[[Mestizos]]'' (mixed Espa\u00f1ol and Indian); ''Mulatos'' (mixed Negro and Espa\u00f1ol); ''Negros'' (Africans); and offspring of further mixed-race pairings.<ref>Ilarione, ., Miller, R.

Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, p 92.</ref> Regardless of the social status of Indian women, she would dress in compliance with Indian customs. Wealthy females were able to purchase superior materials for clothing.\n\nThe importance placed upon social class caused purity of blood to become a factor in regards to marriage. Women were affected by these policies as it was required for both men and women to submit documents proving their blood purity. European men sought elite Mexican women to marry and have children with, in order to retain or gain a higher status in society. Problems that occurred with providing documentation in blood purity are that males were the ones who were called as a witness. Women rarely were able to defend their purity and had to rely on men from the community.<ref>Mart\u00ednez, M. E. (2008). Genealogical fictions: Limpieza de sangre, religion, and gender in colonial Mexico. Stanford, Calif: Stanford University Press, p 174</ref>\n\nRegardless of social class, women in eighteenth century Mexico City usually married for the first time between the ages of 17 and 27, with a median age of 20.5 years. Women were inclined to marry individuals belonging to the same social group as their fathers.<ref>Socolow, S. M. (2000). The women of colonial Latin America. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, p 61</ref>\n\nEducation for women was surrounded by religion. Individuals believed that girls should be educated enough to read the bible and religious devotionals, but should not be taught to write. When girls were provided with an education, they would live in convents and be instructed by nuns, with education being significantly limited. Of all the women who sought entry into Mexico City's convent of Corpus Christi, only 10 percent of elite Indian women had a formal education.<ref>Socolow, S. M. (2000).

It began with the [[Grito de Dolores]] on September 16 of 1810 and officially ended on September 27 of 1821 when Spanish rule collapse and the [[Army of the Three Guarantees]] marched into [[Mexico City]]. Women participated in the [[Mexican War of Independence]], most famously [[Josefa Ortiz de Dom\u00ednguez]], known in Mexican history as ''La Corregidora''.  Her remains were moved to the Monument to Independence in Mexico City; there are statues of her in her honor, and her face has appeared on Mexican currency. Other distinguished women of the era are [[Gertrudis Bocanegra]], [[Mar\u00eda Luisa Mart\u00ednez de Garc\u00eda Rojas]], [[Manuela Medina]], [[Rita P\u00e9rez de Moreno]], [[Maria Fermina Rivera]], [[Mar\u00eda Ignacia Rodr\u00edguez de Velasco y Osorio Barba]], known as the ''G\u00fcera Rodr\u00edguez''; and [[Leona Vicario]].\n\nFollowing independence, some women in Zacatecas raised the question of citizenship for women. They petitioned for it, saying \"women also wish to have the title of citizen .. to see ourselves in the census as 'La ciudadana' (woman citizen).\"<ref>quoted in Miller, Francesca. \"Feminism and Feminist Organizations\" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 2, p. 551. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.</ref>  Independence affected women in both positive and negatives ways. Prior to the independence, women were only allowed to act as their children's guardians until the age of seven in cases of separation of widowhood. Post-independence laws allowed women to serve as guardians until the age of majority.<ref name=\"Connor, Erin E. 2014\">O\u2019Connor, Erin E. (2014). Mothers Making Latin America.

Liberal Reform and Porfiriato 1850-1910===\n[[File:Laureana Wright de Kleinhans.JPG|thumb|[[Laureana Wright de Kleinhans]], considered the most brilliant and radical defender of women's emancipation.]]\nAs with Liberalism elsewhere, [[Liberalism in Mexico]] emphasized secular education as a path forward toward equality before the law. In the colonial era, there were limited opportunities for Mexican girls and women, but with the establishment of secular schools in the middle of the nineteenth century, girls had greater access to education, while women entered the teaching profession. Quite a number of them became advocates for women's rights, becoming active in politics, founding journals and newspapers, and attending international conferences for women's rights. Women teachers were part of the new middle class in Mexico, which also included women office workers in the private sector and government.  Women also became involved in general improvement in society, including better hygiene and nutrition. Toward the end of the [[Porfiriato]], the period when General [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] ruled Mexico (1876-1910), women began pressing for legal equality and the right to vote.  The largest sector of Mexico's population was rural and indigenous or mixed-race, so that the movement for women's equality was carried forward by a very small sector of educated, urban women.<ref>Miller, \"Feminism and Femimist Organizations\", p. 550</ref>\n\n===Mexican Revolution and its Consolidation, 1910-40===\n{{See also|Soldaderas|Feminism in Mexico|Women's suffrage in Mexico}}\n[[Image:Las adelitas.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Depiction of \u00abadelitas\u00bb, or [[Soldaderas]], of the Mexican revolution.]]\nThe [[Mexican revolution]] began in 1910 with an uprising led by [[Francisco I. Madero]] against the longstanding regime of [[Porfirio Diaz]]. The military phase is generally considered to have lasted through 1920. Most often it is the case that women involved in war are overlooked. Although the revolution is attributed to men, it is important to note the dedication and participation women contributed, just as much as their male counterparts. Poor mestiza and indigenous women had a strong presence in the revolutionary conflict becoming camp followers often referred to in Mexico as [[soldaderas]].<ref name=\"Connor, Erin E. 2014\"/> [[Nellie Campobello]] was one of the few women to write a first-person account of the Mexican Revolution, ''Cartucho''.\n\nMost often, these women followed the army when a male relative joined and provided essential services such as food preparation, tending to the wounded, mending clothing, burying the dead, and retrieval of items from the battlefield.<ref name=\"Connor, Erin E. 2014\"/> Women involved in the revolution were just as laden if not more so than men, carrying food, cooking supplies, and bedding.<ref name=\"Connor, Erin E. 2014\"/> Many soldaderas took their children with them, often because their husband had joined or been conscripted into the army. In 1914, a count of [[Pancho Villa]]\u2019s forces included 4,557 male soldiers, 1,256 soldaderas, and 554 children many of whom were babies or toddlers strapped to their mother\u2019s backs.<ref name=\"Connor, Erin E. 2014\"/> Many women picked up arms and joined in combat alongside men, often when a male comrade, their husband or brother had fallen.<ref name=\"Connor, Erin E. 2014\"/>\n\n[[File:Elena_Arizmendi_ca_1916.PNG|right|250px|thumb|A Mexican feminist who established the [[Neutral White Cross]] organisation during the Mexican Revolution.]]\nThere were also many cases of women who fought in the revolution disguised as men, however most returned to female identities once the conflict had ended.<ref name=\"Connor, Erin E. 2014\"/> The lasting impacts of the revolution have proved mixed at best. The revolution promised reforms and greater rights for women to one extent or another, but failed to live up to its promises. Thousands of women fought in the battles and provided necessary services to the armies, however their contributions have largely been forgotten and viewed as merely supportive.<ref name=\"Connor, Erin E. 2014\"/>\n\nThere had been agitation for [[women's suffrage]] in Mexico in the late nineteenth century, and both [[Francisco Madero]] and [[Venustiano Carranza]] were sympathetic to women's issues, both having female private secretaries who influenced their thinking on the matter.<ref>Wade M. Morton, ''Woman Suffrage in Mexico''. Gainesville: University of Florida Press 1962, p. 2-3.</ref> Carranza's secretary [[Hermila Galindo]] was an important feminist activist, who in collaboration with others founded a feminist magazine ''La Mujer Moderna'' that folded in 1919, but until then advocated for women's rights. Mexican feminist [[Andrea Villarreal]] was active agitating against the D\u00edaz regime in the [[Mexican Liberal Party]] and was involved with ''La Mujer Moderna'', until it ceased publication.  She was known as the \"Mexican Joan of Arc\" and was a woman represented in U.S. artist [[Judy Chicago]]'s dinner party.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklynmuseum.org/eascfa/dinner_party/heritage_floor/andres_villareal.php|title=Brooklyn Museum: Andres Villareal|website=www.brooklynmuseum.org|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\nCarranza made changes in family and marital law with long-lasting consequences. In December 1914, he issued a decree that allowed for divorce under certain circumstances.  His initial decree was then expanded when he became president in 1916, which in addition to divorce \"gave women the right to alimony and to the management of property, and other similar rights.\"<ref>Morton, ''Woman Suffrage in Mexico'', pp. 8-9.</ref>\n\nWith the victory of the Constitutionalist faction in the Revolution, a new constitution was drafted in 1917.  It was an advanced social document on many grounds, enshrining rights of labor, empowering the state to expropriate natural resources, and expanding the role of the secular state, but it did not grant women the right to vote, since they were still not considered citizens.<ref>Miller, \"Feminism and Feminist Organizations\" pp. 550-51.</ref>\n\nDuring the presidency of [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]] (1934\u201340), legislation to give women the right to vote was passed, but not implemented. He had campaigned on a \"promise to reform the constitution to grant equal rights.\"<ref>Miller, \"Feminism and Feminist Organizations\" p. 552</ref>  Women did not achieve the right to vote until 1953.\n\n==Women in the Professions==\n{{See also|100 Women (BBC)}}\n\n===Politics===\n{{See also|Amalia Garc\u00eda}}\n\n[[File:04242012Ministra olga sanchez derecho03 (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|[[Olga Sanchez Cordero]], Minister of the Interior]]\n[[File:Claudia_Sheinbaum.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo]] a Mexican politician and scientist who jointly received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 2007 as a member of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]].]]\n\nAlthough women comprise half the Mexican population, they are generally absent from the highest ranks of political power.

However, President [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] married [[Carmen Romero Rubio]] the young daughter of one of his cabinet ministers, [[Manuel Romero Rubio]]; she was an influential First Lady of Mexico during his long presidency, 1881-1911. A few subsequent First Ladies took more visible roles in politics. The wife of President [[Vicente Fox]] (2000-2006), [[Marta Sahag\u00fan]] was an active member of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] and became the wife of Fox after she had served as his spokesperson.  Sahag\u00fan was criticized for her political ambitions, and she has stated that she will no longer pursue them.

Mexico City: Institute for Communication Research 1981.</ref>  Mexico's success in reducing the increase of its population has been the subject of scholarly study.<ref>Soto Laveaga, \u201cLet\u2019s become fewer\u201d</ref><ref>F.

It is the second most populated nation in Latin America. The population trend is even expected to grow in size in a little over thirty years. With a population that keeps increasing it was the first nation in 1973 to establish a family planning program. It is called MEXFAM (The Mexican Family Planning Association); the program has been recorded to have decreased Mexican households from 7.2 children to 2.4 in 1999.<ref name=\"d.umn.edu\">Birth Control & Mexico.

Approximately 25% of Mexican women live in rural areas, and of that, only 44% of those use birth control, and their fertility rate, 4.7%, is almost twice that of urban women.\u201d<ref name=\"d.umn.edu\"/>  Mexico was even able to incorporate a sexual education program in the schools to educate on contraception, but with many young girls living in rural areas, they are usually not able to attend.\n\n===Sexuality===\n{{Main|Miss Mexico Organization|Mexicana Universal}}\n{{See also|Nena von Schlebr\u00fcgge|Elsa Ben\u00edtez|Laura Z\u00fa\u00f1iga|Liliana Dom\u00ednguez|Alta\u00edr Jarabo|Ninel Conde}}\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Miss_Mexico,_Vanessa_Ponce_in_2018.jpg|'''[[Miss World 2018]]'''<br />[[Vanessa Ponce]] \nFile:Ximena Navarrete - Miss Universe 2010.jpg|'''[[Miss Universe 2010]]'''<br />[[Ximena Navarrete]]\nFile:Miss Mexico 08 Anagabriela Espinoza.jpg|'''[[Miss International 2009]]'''<br />[[Anagabriela Espinoza]]\nFile:Lupita_Jones.jpg|'''[[Miss Universe 1991]]'''<br />[[Lupita Jones]]\n</gallery>\n\nThere are still persisting inequalities between levels of sexual experience between females and males.
