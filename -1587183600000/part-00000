Shakur continued his recordings despite increasing problems at the Death Row label. [[Dr. Dre]] left his post as in-house producer to form his own label, [[Aftermath Entertainment|Aftermath]]. Shakur continued to produce hundreds of tracks during his time at Death Row, most of which would be released on his posthumous albums ''[[Still I Rise (2PAC album)|Still I Rise]]'', ''[[Until the End of Time (Tupac Shakur album)|Until the End of Time]]'', ''[[Better Dayz]]'', ''[[Loyal to the Game]]'' and ''[[Pac's Life]]''.

In the track, Shakur claimed to have had sexual intercourse with [[Faith Evans]], the wife of Wallace, and attacked [[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]]'s street credibility. Shakur was convinced that some members associated with Bad Boy had known about the 1994 attack on him due to their behavior that night and the information that his sources gave to him. According to a 2005 interview with [[Jimmy Henchman]], in ''Vibe'' magazine, after the attack, Shakur immediately accused Henchman, an associate of Bad Boy CEO Sean Combs, of orchestrating the attack. Shakur, therefore, aligned himself with Suge, Death Row's CEO, who was already bitter towards Combs over a 1995 incident at the Platinum Club in Atlanta, Georgia, which culminated in the death of Jake Robles, the friend and bodyguard of [[Suge Knight]]; Knight was adamant in voicing his suspicions about Combs' involvement.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Egbert |first=Bill |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/02/27/2001-02-27__hip_hype___rival_rap.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704173248/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/02/27/2001-02-27__hip_hype___rival_rap.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 4, 2010 |title=Hip Hype & Rival Rap, by Bill Egbert |work=Daily News |location=New York |date=February 27, 2001 |accessdate=July 24, 2010}}</ref> In the years following their killings, associates of both Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. made comments indicating that the pair, were it not for their deaths, would have reconciled.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1641700/tupac-and-biggie-would-have-reconciled-naughty-by-natures-treach-says/ |title=Tupac And Biggie Would Have Reconciled, Naughty By Nature's Treach Says |date=June 16, 2010 |first=Mawuse |last=Ziegbe |publisher=MTV |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101190821/http://www.mtv.com/news/1641700/tupac-and-biggie-would-have-reconciled-naughty-by-natures-treach-says/ |archivedate=January 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.20015/title.lil-cease-says-tupac-and-notorious-b-i-g-would-have-ultimately-reconciled |title=Lil' Cease Says Tupac And Notorious B.I.G.

Shakur, with the three New Jersey rappers and other associates, formed the original lineup of the Outlawz. When Shakur signed to [[Death Row Records|Death Row]] after his release from prison, he recruited step brother [[Mopreme Shakur]] and [[Big Syke]] from Thug Life. [[Hussein Fatal]], [[Napoleon (rapper)|Napoleon]], [[E.D.I. Mean]], [[Kastro (Outlawz)|Kastro]], [[Yaki Kadafi]], and Storm (the only female Outlaw) were also added, and together they formed the original lineup of the Outlaw Immortalz that debuted on ''All Eyez on Me''. They later dropped the Immortal part of their name after the untimely deaths of Shakur and Yaki Kadafi and moved on as Outlawz without the members of Thug Life. [[Young Noble]] was later added and appeared on Shakur's second Death Row release ''The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory''. It was on this album that Outlawz first came to the greater rap community's notice, appearing on a few songs. The idea behind the group was for each member to have a rap name coinciding with the names of various tyrants or enemies of America, past, and present. Outlawz chose in later years to make a [[backronym]] out of the letters of their group name ''Operating Under Thug Laws as Warriorz'' although it does not stand for the group's name and is used infrequently.\n\nOn forming the Outlawz, Shakur gave each of them a name of a dictator/military leader and/or an enemy of America.\n* [[Yaki Kadafi]], after Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]]\n* [[Hussein Fatal]], after Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]]\n* [[Big Syke|Mussolini]] (formerly [[Big Syke]]), after Italian fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]\n* [[Mopreme Shakur|Komani]] (Shakur's step brother [[Mopreme Shakur]]), after [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian Islamic Revolution]] leader [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ruhollah \"Ayatollah\" Khomeini]]\n* [[Kastro (Outlawz)|Kastro]], after Cuban communist revolutionary and leader [[Fidel Castro]]\n* [[E.D.I.

He mentioned Makaveli Records a few times before his death. This was supposed to be a music label for up-and-coming artists that Shakur had an interest in developing or potentially signing, and his own future projects would have been published through it as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2pacworld.co.uk/2pacCompanies.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050311080759/http://www.2pacworld.co.uk/2pacCompanies.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 11, 2005 |title=Makaveil Records |publisher=2pacworld.co.uk |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Acting career==\nIn addition to his endeavors in the music industry, Shakur acted in films.

Shakur continued his recordings despite increasing problems at the Death Row label. [[Dr. Dre]] left his post as in-house producer to form his own label, [[Aftermath Entertainment|Aftermath]]. Shakur continued to produce hundreds of tracks during his time at Death Row, most of which would be released on his posthumous albums ''[[Still I Rise (2PAC album)|Still I Rise]]'', ''[[Until the End of Time (Tupac Shakur album)|Until the End of Time]]'', ''[[Better Dayz]]'', ''[[Loyal to the Game]]'' and ''[[Pac's Life]]''.

In the track, Shakur claimed to have had sexual intercourse with [[Faith Evans]], the wife of Wallace, and attacked [[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]]'s street credibility. Shakur was convinced that some members associated with Bad Boy had known about the 1994 attack on him due to their behavior that night and the information that his sources gave to him. According to a 2005 interview with [[Jimmy Henchman]], in ''Vibe'' magazine, after the attack, Shakur immediately accused Henchman, an associate of Bad Boy CEO Sean Combs, of orchestrating the attack. Shakur, therefore, aligned himself with Suge, Death Row's CEO, who was already bitter towards Combs over a 1995 incident at the Platinum Club in Atlanta, Georgia, which culminated in the death of Jake Robles, the friend and bodyguard of [[Suge Knight]]; Knight was adamant in voicing his suspicions about Combs' involvement.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Egbert |first=Bill |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/02/27/2001-02-27__hip_hype___rival_rap.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704173248/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/02/27/2001-02-27__hip_hype___rival_rap.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 4, 2010 |title=Hip Hype & Rival Rap, by Bill Egbert |work=Daily News |location=New York |date=February 27, 2001 |accessdate=July 24, 2010}}</ref> In the years following their killings, associates of both Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. made comments indicating that the pair, were it not for their deaths, would have reconciled.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1641700/tupac-and-biggie-would-have-reconciled-naughty-by-natures-treach-says/ |title=Tupac And Biggie Would Have Reconciled, Naughty By Nature's Treach Says |date=June 16, 2010 |first=Mawuse |last=Ziegbe |publisher=MTV |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101190821/http://www.mtv.com/news/1641700/tupac-and-biggie-would-have-reconciled-naughty-by-natures-treach-says/ |archivedate=January 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.20015/title.lil-cease-says-tupac-and-notorious-b-i-g-would-have-ultimately-reconciled |title=Lil' Cease Says Tupac And Notorious B.I.G.

Shakur, with the three New Jersey rappers and other associates, formed the original lineup of the Outlawz. When Shakur signed to [[Death Row Records|Death Row]] after his release from prison, he recruited step brother [[Mopreme Shakur]] and [[Big Syke]] from Thug Life. [[Hussein Fatal]], [[Napoleon (rapper)|Napoleon]], [[E.D.I. Mean]], [[Kastro (Outlawz)|Kastro]], [[Yaki Kadafi]], and Storm (the only female Outlaw) were also added, and together they formed the original lineup of the Outlaw Immortalz that debuted on ''All Eyez on Me''. They later dropped the Immortal part of their name after the untimely deaths of Shakur and Yaki Kadafi and moved on as Outlawz without the members of Thug Life. [[Young Noble]] was later added and appeared on Shakur's second Death Row release ''The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory''. It was on this album that Outlawz first came to the greater rap community's notice, appearing on a few songs. The idea behind the group was for each member to have a rap name coinciding with the names of various tyrants or enemies of America, past, and present. Outlawz chose in later years to make a [[backronym]] out of the letters of their group name ''Operating Under Thug Laws as Warriorz'' although it does not stand for the group's name and is used infrequently.\n\nOn forming the Outlawz, Shakur gave each of them a name of a dictator/military leader and/or an enemy of America.\n* [[Yaki Kadafi]], after Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]]\n* [[Hussein Fatal]], after Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]]\n* [[Big Syke|Mussolini]] (formerly [[Big Syke]]), after Italian fascist dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]\n* [[Mopreme Shakur|Komani]] (Shakur's step brother [[Mopreme Shakur]]), after [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian Islamic Revolution]] leader [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ruhollah \"Ayatollah\" Khomeini]]\n* [[Kastro (Outlawz)|Kastro]], after Cuban communist revolutionary and leader [[Fidel Castro]]\n* [[E.D.I.

He mentioned Makaveli Records a few times before his death. This was supposed to be a music label for up-and-coming artists that Shakur had an interest in developing or potentially signing, and his own future projects would have been published through it as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2pacworld.co.uk/2pacCompanies.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050311080759/http://www.2pacworld.co.uk/2pacCompanies.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 11, 2005 |title=Makaveil Records |publisher=2pacworld.co.uk |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Acting career==\nIn addition to his endeavors in the music industry, Shakur acted in films.

Losses, material destruction, and organizational flaws regarding strategic planning and officer training, were noted by officers like [[Emilio Sotomayor]] and [[Patricio Lynch]], who approached President [[Domingo Santa Mar\u00eda|Santa Mar\u00eda]] arguing the need of good schools and technical departments for the military. Other factor that supported the emulation, the deliberate systematic imitation of the military technology, organisation, and doctrine of one country by another<ref group=\"Notes\">Joao Resende-Santos in ''Neorealism, States, and the Modern Mass Army'' (page 3, 9-10) uses \"emulation\" instead of \"prussianization\" as a broader term. He says: \"Crossnational emulation occurs in a wide variety of areas and by an equal variety of state and nonstate entities ... Emulation in all forms, by firms or states whether in economic or military areas is driven by the same pressures of competition and based in the same political criterion\"</ref> was the danger of war with Argentina. The emulation was backed by a broad coalition of civil and military leaders.\n\nChile hired a French military training mission in 1858,<ref name=\"harvnb|Resende-Santos|2007\">{{harvnb|Resende-Santos|2007|}}</ref>{{rp|129}} and the Chilean legation in [[Berlin]] was instructed to find a training mission during the War of the Pacific in 1881. But large-scale [[wiktionary:emulation|emulation]] of the [[Prussian Army]] began in 1886 with the appointment of Captain [[Emil K\u00f6rner]], a graduate of the renowned [[Prussian Military Academy|Kriegsakademie]] in Berlin. Also appointed were 36 Prussian officers to train officer cadets in the Chilean Military Academy. The training occurred in three phases; the first took place from 1885 to 1891 during the presidency of [[Domingo Santa Mar\u00eda]], the second was the post-civil-war phase, and the third was the 1906 reorganization.<ref name=\"harvnb|Resende-Santos|2007\"/>{{rp|128-}}\n\nThe emulation was focused in armaments, conscription, officer recruitment and instruction, and general staff organization as well as military doctrine (adopted 1906). It was extended also into military logistics and medical services, promotions, retirement, salary regulation and even uniforms (adopted 1904), marching styles, helmets, parades, and military music.\n\n'''Armaments''': Prior to 1883, the army was equipped with a variety of rifles, mostly French and Belgian origin. From 1892 to 1902, the Chilean-Argentine Arms Race, marked the peak of Chilean arms purchase. 100,000 [[Mauser]] rifles and new [[Krupp]] artillery was bought for 3,000,000&nbsp;[[Deutsche Mark|DM]] in 1893, 2,000,000&nbsp;DM in 1895 and 15,000,000&nbsp;DM in 1898. Ammunition factories and small arms manufacturing plants were established.<ref name=\"harvnb|Resende-Santos|2007\"/>{{rp|134}}\n\n'''Conscription''': Like others armies in South America, Chile had had a small army of long-term service officers and soldiers. In 1900 Chile became the first country in Latin America to enforce a system of compulsory military service, whereby training, initially five to eighteen months (Germany: three years), took place in zones of divisional organization in order to create a solid military structure that could be easily doubled with well-trained and combat-ready reserve forces. Budgetary restrictions prevented the full impact of the law: the service fell disproportionately on the lower classes, no more than 20% of the contingent was incorporated annually, and former conscripts were not retrained periodically.<ref name=\"harvnb|Resende-Santos|2007\"/>{{rp|137}}\n\n'''Officer education and training''': The beginning of the German mission were dedicated almost exclusively to the organization and implementation of a standardized, technically oriented military education with the essence of [[Moltke]]'s German military system of continuous study of artillery, infantry, cartography, history, topography, logistics, tactics, etc., for a modern, professional and technically trained officer corps. In 1886, the \"Academia de Guerra\" (War Academy) was founded ''\"to elevate the level of technical and scientific instruction of army officers, in order that they be able, in case of war, to utilize the advantages of new methods of combat and new armaments.\"'' The best alumni were candidates for general staff service. By the mid-1890s K\u00f6rner organized the courses for a Noncommissioned Officers' School (''Escuela de Suboficiales y Clases'').<ref name=\"harvnb|Resende-Santos|2007\"/>{{rp|139}}\n\nDuring the '''[[1891 Chilean Civil War]]''' K\u00f6rner was removed from duty by [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Balmaceda]]. He and his followers set sail north to join the Congressional forces in [[Iquique]]. He became chief architect of the new army and, though [[Estanislao del Canto]] formally was commander-in-chief, K\u00f6rner led the rebel forces in the major clashes of the civil war.<ref name=\"harvnb|Resende-Santos|2007\"/>{{rp|145}}\n\nChile had had a '''General Staff''' during the War of the Pacific.<ref name=\"SaterHerwig1999\">{{cite book|author1=William F.

The military suppressed, dismantled, and purged not only political parties but also publication, unions, schools, and other bastions of the democratic opposition. Even such privileged constituencies as university professors and students encountered serious limitations on their traditional ability to voice opinions of national, or even institutional relevance. ... The military regime viewed such activities [of the Catholic Church] with distrust, if not hostility. It launched a campaign of harassment against the Catholic Church ...''\n:''Once the military had demobilized the polity and society, the regime began implanting its vision of a new order.

The Army was on full alert status during the duration of the crisis.\n\n[[Patricio Aylwin]] became [[Chilean presidential election, 1989|elected]] President of the Republic on December 14, 1989. Although Chile had officially become a democracy, the Chilean military remained highly powerful during the presidency of Aylwin, and the [[Constitution of Chile|Constitution]], amended by Pinochet's regime, ensured the continued influence of Pinochet and his commanders.\n\n===21st century===\nAs a result of tensions with neighbors during the conflict-prone 1970s and early 1980s, the Chilean Army refined existing strategic concepts and eventually formulated a plan to restructure its forces.  Though wars were avoided, the threats from the 1970s and 1980s encouraged the army to address more effectively its major defense disadvantage: lack of [[strategic depth]]. Thus in the early 1980s it looked outward for a model of army organization that would best advance defensive capabilities by restructuring forces into smaller, more mobile units instead of traditional divisions.  The resulting '''Plan Alc\u00e1zar''' envisions three military zones in Chile, with the bulk of forces concentrated in the north, and reinforces the center and south. The plan was implemented in stages, starting in 1994.

The early armed forces adopted many Prussian military traditions, and it was during this period that the Chilean military had many of its most famous victories. As a result, the drill features many 19th and early 20th century Prussian and German patterns.\n\nParticipating soldiers wear [[stahlhelm]] and [[pickelhaube]] helmets and march in unaltered [[Goose step|stechschritt]]. Marching music consists of Central European marches, alongside several local compositions. Each ''Parada Militar'' on 19 September ends with a playing of [[Preussischer Pr\u00e4sentiermarsch]] (first played in 2018) and [[Los viejos estandartes]] by a mounted band playing in the German tradition.\n\nPickelhaubes have been worn by the Military School and since recently by the 1st Cavalry Regiment and the 1st Artillery Regiment, and the stahlhelm only by the NCO School.\n\nThis is also the cases on parades held on 18 September, Independence Day, in the local level, whenever Army units take part.\n\nGiven the long list of battles fought by the Army, the following wear on parade historical dress uniforms from these times, but not march in the German manner:\n\n* 1st Infantry Regiment \"Buin\" -

Losses, material destruction, and organizational flaws regarding strategic planning and officer training, were noted by officers like [[Emilio Sotomayor]] and [[Patricio Lynch]], who approached President [[Domingo Santa Mar\u00eda|Santa Mar\u00eda]] arguing the need of good schools and technical departments for the military. Other factor that supported the emulation, the deliberate systematic imitation of the military technology, organisation, and doctrine of one country by another<ref group=\"Notes\">Joao Resende-Santos in ''Neorealism, States, and the Modern Mass Army'' (page 3, 9-10) uses \"emulation\" instead of \"prussianization\" as a broader term. He says: \"Crossnational emulation occurs in a wide variety of areas and by an equal variety of state and nonstate entities ... Emulation in all forms, by firms or states whether in economic or military areas is driven by the same pressures of competition and based in the same political criterion\"</ref> was the danger of war with Argentina. The emulation was backed by a broad coalition of civil and military leaders.\n\nChile hired a French military training mission in 1858,<ref name=\"harvnb|Resende-Santos|2007\">{{harvnb|Resende-Santos|2007|}}</ref>{{rp|129}} and the Chilean legation in [[Berlin]] was instructed to find a training mission during the War of the Pacific in 1881. But large-scale [[wiktionary:emulation|emulation]] of the [[Prussian Army]] began in 1886 with the appointment of Captain [[Emil K\u00f6rner]], a graduate of the renowned [[Prussian Military Academy|Kriegsakademie]] in Berlin. Also appointed were 36 Prussian officers to train officer cadets in the Chilean Military Academy. The training occurred in three phases; the first took place from 1885 to 1891 during the presidency of [[Domingo Santa Mar\u00eda]], the second was the post-civil-war phase, and the third was the 1906 reorganization.<ref name=\"harvnb|Resende-Santos|2007\"/>{{rp|128-}}\n\nThe emulation was focused in armaments, conscription, officer recruitment and instruction, and general staff organization as well as military doctrine (adopted 1906). It was extended also into military logistics and medical services, promotions, retirement, salary regulation and even uniforms (adopted 1904), marching styles, helmets, parades, and military music.\n\n'''Armaments''': Prior to 1883, the army was equipped with a variety of rifles, mostly French and Belgian origin. From 1892 to 1902, the Chilean-Argentine Arms Race, marked the peak of Chilean arms purchase. 100,000 [[Mauser]] rifles and new [[Krupp]] artillery was bought for 3,000,000&nbsp;[[Deutsche Mark|DM]] in 1893, 2,000,000&nbsp;DM in 1895 and 15,000,000&nbsp;DM in 1898. Ammunition factories and small arms manufacturing plants were established.<ref name=\"harvnb|Resende-Santos|2007\"/>{{rp|134}}\n\n'''Conscription''': Like others armies in South America, Chile had had a small army of long-term service officers and soldiers. In 1900 Chile became the first country in Latin America to enforce a system of compulsory military service, whereby training, initially five to eighteen months (Germany: three years), took place in zones of divisional organization in order to create a solid military structure that could be easily doubled with well-trained and combat-ready reserve forces. Budgetary restrictions prevented the full impact of the law: the service fell disproportionately on the lower classes, no more than 20% of the contingent was incorporated annually, and former conscripts were not retrained periodically.<ref name=\"harvnb|Resende-Santos|2007\"/>{{rp|137}}\n\n'''Officer education and training''': The beginning of the German mission were dedicated almost exclusively to the organization and implementation of a standardized, technically oriented military education with the essence of [[Moltke]]'s German military system of continuous study of artillery, infantry, cartography, history, topography, logistics, tactics, etc., for a modern, professional and technically trained officer corps. In 1886, the \"Academia de Guerra\" (War Academy) was founded ''\"to elevate the level of technical and scientific instruction of army officers, in order that they be able, in case of war, to utilize the advantages of new methods of combat and new armaments.\"'' The best alumni were candidates for general staff service. By the mid-1890s K\u00f6rner organized the courses for a Noncommissioned Officers' School (''Escuela de Suboficiales y Clases'').<ref name=\"harvnb|Resende-Santos|2007\"/>{{rp|139}}\n\nDuring the '''[[1891 Chilean Civil War]]''' K\u00f6rner was removed from duty by [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Balmaceda]]. He and his followers set sail north to join the Congressional forces in [[Iquique]]. He became chief architect of the new army and, though [[Estanislao del Canto]] formally was commander-in-chief, K\u00f6rner led the rebel forces in the major clashes of the civil war.<ref name=\"harvnb|Resende-Santos|2007\"/>{{rp|145}}\n\nChile had had a '''General Staff''' during the War of the Pacific.<ref name=\"SaterHerwig1999\">{{cite book|author1=William F.

The military regime viewed such activities [of the Catholic Church] with distrust, if not hostility. It launched a campaign of harassment against the Catholic Church ...''\n:''Once the military had demobilized the polity and society, the regime began implanting its vision of a new order.

The Army was on full alert status during the duration of the crisis.\n\n[[Patricio Aylwin]] became [[Chilean presidential election, 1989|elected]] President of the Republic on December 14, 1989. Although Chile had officially become a democracy, the Chilean military remained highly powerful during the presidency of Aylwin, and the [[Constitution of Chile|Constitution]], amended by Pinochet's regime, ensured the continued influence of Pinochet and his commanders.\n\n===21st century===\nAs a result of tensions with neighbors during the conflict-prone 1970s and early 1980s, the Chilean Army refined existing strategic concepts and eventually formulated a plan to restructure its forces.  Though wars were avoided, the threats from the 1970s and 1980s encouraged the army to address more effectively its major defense disadvantage: lack of [[strategic depth]]. Thus in the early 1980s it looked outward for a model of army organization that would best advance defensive capabilities by restructuring forces into smaller, more mobile units instead of traditional divisions.  The resulting '''Plan Alc\u00e1zar''' envisions three military zones in Chile, with the bulk of forces concentrated in the north, and reinforces the center and south. The plan was implemented in stages, starting in 1994.  Thus Alc\u00e1zar, based on threat scenarios of the past, is one of the most durable \"lessons\" of the past.{{Clarify|date= March 2015}} Even with the resolution of almost all remaining territorial disputes, the restructuring agenda continued, reinforcing a conflict-based mindset in the army.<ref>Kristina Mani, [http://lasa.international.pitt.edu/Lasa2003/ManiKristina.pdf Democratization and Strategic Thinking: What the Militaries in Argentina and Chile Learned in the 1990s] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301032816/http://lasa.international.pitt.edu/Lasa2003/ManiKristina.pdf |date=2014-03-01 }}, Columbia University, 2003, retrieved on 4 August 2013</ref>\n\n====Peacekeeping====\n{{see also|Chilean Joint Peacekeeping Operations Center}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 200px\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n|\n*1964-2013 [[UNFICYP]]\n*1969 El Salvador-Honduras conflict ([[Organization of American States|OAS]] mission).\n*1978-2013 [[UNIFIL]]\n*1989-1992 [[ONUCA]]\n*1991-1992 [[UNIKOM]]\n*1992-1993 [[UNTAC]]\n*1992-1995 [[ONUSAL]]\n*1995-1999 [[MOMEP]] (Military Observer Mission in the Ecuador-Peru conflict)\n*1996-1998 [[UNSCOM]]\n*1997-2002 [[UNMIBH]]\n*2000-2002 [[UNTAET]]\n|\n*2000-2003 [[UNMOVIC]]\n*2000-(2013) [[UNMIK]]\n*2001-(2013) [[UNFICYP]]\n*2002-2003 [[UNMISET]]\n*2003-2006 [[DPKO]]\n*2003-(2013) [[MONUC]]\n*2003-2004 [[UNAMA]]\n*2004-(2013) [[EUFOR]] - [[ALTHEA]]\n*2004-(2013) [[MIFH]] (Multinational Interim Force for [[Haiti]])\n*2004-(2013) [[MINUSTAH]]\n*2007-(2013) [[UNLOG]] (UN Logistics Base in [[Brindisi, Italy]])\n|}\n\n==Organization==\n{{main|Chilean Army order of battle}}\n[[File:Chile Army 2014.png|thumb|right|480px|Structure of the Chilean Army in 2014 (click on image to enlarge)]]\n\n===Order Of Battle===\n'''Army General Headquarters''', in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]].\n\n'''Land Operations Command''', headquartered in [[Concepci\u00f3n, Chile|Concepcion]].\n* '''1st Army Division''': Regions II and III, with headquarters in [[Antofagasta]].\n* '''2nd Motorized Division''': Regions IV, V, VI, VII and [[Santiago Metropolitan Region]] with headquarters in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago de Chile]].\n* '''3rd Mountain Division''': Serving Regions VIII, IX, XIV, and X with headquarters in [[Valdivia]].\n* '''4th Army Division''': Region XI with headquarters in [[Coyhaique]].\n* '''5th Army Division''': Serving Region XII with headquarters in [[Punta Arenas]].\n* '''6th Army Division''': Serving Regions I and XV, with headquarters in [[Iquique]].\n* '''Army Aviation Brigade''': with headquarters in [[Rancagua]] (''Brigada de Aviaci\u00f3n del Ej\u00e9rcito'').

The early armed forces adopted many Prussian military traditions, and it was during this period that the Chilean military had many of its most famous victories. As a result, the drill features many 19th and early 20th century Prussian and German patterns.\n\nParticipating soldiers wear [[stahlhelm]] and [[pickelhaube]] helmets and march in unaltered [[Goose step|stechschritt]]. Marching music consists of Central European marches, alongside several local compositions. Each ''Parada Militar'' on 19 September ends with a playing of [[Preussischer Pr\u00e4sentiermarsch]] (first played in 2018) and [[Los viejos estandartes]] by a mounted band playing in the German tradition.\n\nPickelhaubes have been worn by the Military School and since recently by the 1st Cavalry Regiment and the 1st Artillery Regiment, and the stahlhelm only by the NCO School.\n\nThis is also the cases on parades held on 18 September, Independence Day, in the local level, whenever Army units take part.\n\nGiven the long list of battles fought by the Army, the following wear on parade historical dress uniforms from these times, but not march in the German manner:\n\n* 1st Infantry Regiment \"Buin\" - Grenadier uniform of the 1st Infantry Battalion \"Chilean Grenadiers\"\n* 6th Reinforced Regimient \"Chacabuco\" - War of the Pacific French-styled uniform worn by the 4th Company, in recognition of its heroic final stand in the [[Battle of La Concepcion]]\n* 4th Motorized Infantry Brigade \"Rancagua\" - War of the Pacific French-styled uniform worn by the Historical Company, similar to those worn by the regiment during the 1880 [[Battle of Arica]]\n\n==Commanders-in-chief==\n{{main|List of commanders-in-chief of the Chilean Army}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chilean Navy]]\n* [[Chilean Air Force]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=\"Notes\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book\n | last       = Resende-Santos\n | first      = Joao\n | authorlink =\n | title      = Neorealism, States, and the Modern Mass Army\n | location   = New York\n | publisher  = Cambridge University Press\n | year       = 2007\n | edition =\n | url        = \n | isbn       = 978 - 0 - 521 - 86948 - 5\n | ref        = harv\n | language   = \n}}\n* {{cite book\n | last       = Bawden\n | first      = John R\n | authorlink =\n | title      = The Pinochet Generation: The Chilean Military in the Twentieth Century\n | location   = Tuscaloosa\n | publisher  = University of Alabama Press\n | year       = 2016\n | edition =\n | url        = \n | isbn       = 978-0817319281\n | language   = \n}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.ejercito.cl/ Official Chilean Army site] {{in lang|es}}\n* {{Citation| title       =Ranks of Chilean Army site| publisher       =Chilean Army| publication-place       =Chilean Army website| url       =http://www.ejercito.cl/nuestro_ejercito/grados.php| accessdate       =28 August 2010| archiveurl       =https://web.archive.org/web/20100828173143/http://www.ejercito.cl/nuestro_ejercito/grados.php| archivedate       =28 August 2010| url-status       =dead}}\n*[http://www.fas.org/asmp/campaigns/smallarms/lainven.html Latin American Light Weapons National Inventories]\n\n{{FFAA Chile}}\n{{Chile topics}}\n{{Armies in Latin America}}\n\n[[Category:Chilean Army| ]]\n", "name_user": "Fabiondo", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eThe Army under Pinochet", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chilean_Army"}
