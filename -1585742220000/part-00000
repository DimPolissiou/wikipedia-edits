Serving with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), he was credited with as many as seventeen aerial victories during the [[Battle of Britain]], before being killed in action on 7&nbsp;September 1940. His tally made him the highest-scoring Australian of the battle, and among the three highest-scoring Australians of the war.\n\nBorn in [[Cooma, New South Wales|Cooma]], New South Wales, Hughes joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] as a cadet in 1936. After graduating as a pilot,  he chose to take a commission with the RAF. In July 1937, he was assigned to [[No. 64 Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;64 Squadron]], which operated [[Hawker Demon]] and, later, [[Bristol Blenheim]] fighters. Posted to [[No. 234 Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;234 Squadron]] following the outbreak of World War&nbsp;II, Hughes began flying [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s as a [[flight commander]]. He shared in his unit's first aerial victory on 8&nbsp;July 1940, and began scoring heavily against the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' the following month. Known for his practice of attacking his targets at extremely close range, Hughes is generally thought to have died after his Spitfire was struck by flying debris from a German bomber that he had just shot down. He was posthumously awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], and was buried in England.\n\n==Early life==\nPaterson Clarence Hughes was born in Numeralla, near [[Cooma, New South Wales|Cooma]], New South Wales, on 19&nbsp;September 1917. He was the second-youngest of twelve children, the last of four boys in his family.<ref name=ADB>{{cite web|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hughes-paterson-clarence-10564 |title= Hughes, Paterson Clarence (1917\u20131940)|last=Newton|first=Dennis|work= [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|accessdate= 26 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=Alexander30>Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. 30\u201331</ref> Hughes' father was a teacher by profession but at the time of Pat's birth was running the community post office; christened Percival Clarence Hughes, and known as Percy, he had apparently adopted the name Paterson by the time of his marriage to Catherine Vennell in 1895. Percy was also a writer, contributing to newspapers and magazines such as ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'', and \"Paterson\" may have been homage to the poet [[Banjo Paterson]]. In any case, Pat shared his father's interest in literature.

Hughes''', [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]] (19 September 1917&nbsp;\u2013 7&nbsp;September 1940) was an Australian [[flying ace|fighter ace]] of World War&nbsp;II. Serving with the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), he was credited with as many as seventeen aerial victories during the [[Battle of Britain]], before being killed in action on 7&nbsp;September 1940. His tally made him the highest-scoring Australian of the battle, and among the three highest-scoring Australians of the war.\n\nBorn in [[Cooma, New South Wales|Cooma]], New South Wales, Hughes joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] as a cadet in 1936. After graduating as a pilot,  he chose to take a commission with the RAF. In July 1937, he was assigned to [[No. 64 Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;64 Squadron]], which operated [[Hawker Demon]] and, later, [[Bristol Blenheim]] fighters. Posted to [[No. 234 Squadron RAF|No.&nbsp;234 Squadron]] following the outbreak of World War&nbsp;II, Hughes began flying [[Supermarine Spitfire]]s as a [[flight commander]]. He shared in his unit's first aerial victory on 8&nbsp;July 1940, and began scoring heavily against the ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' the following month. Known for his practice of attacking his targets at extremely close range, Hughes is generally thought to have died after his Spitfire was struck by flying debris from a German bomber that he had just shot down. He was posthumously awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], and was buried in England.\n\n==Early life==\nPaterson Clarence Hughes was born in Numeralla, near [[Cooma, New South Wales|Cooma]], New South Wales, on 19&nbsp;September 1917. He was the second-youngest of twelve children, the last of four boys in his family.<ref name=ADB>{{cite web|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hughes-paterson-clarence-10564 |title= Hughes, Paterson Clarence (1917\u20131940)|last=Newton|first=Dennis|work= [[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]|accessdate= 26 May 2015}}</ref><ref name=Alexander30>Alexander, ''Australia's Few'', pp. 30\u201331</ref> Hughes' father was a teacher by profession but at the time of Pat's birth was running the community post office; christened Percival Clarence Hughes, and known as Percy, he had apparently adopted the name Paterson by the time of his marriage to Catherine Vennell in 1895.

He graduated at the Gansu provincial academy and then served as the Principal at the provincial normal school. He entered the Imperial Civil Service, where he got into the attention of [[Yang Zengxin]], at the time District Magistrate of [[Hezhou]]. When Yang was appointed Governor of [[Xinjiang Province, Republic of China|Xinjiang]] in 1908, Jin followed him as a district magistrate. After the collapse of the [[Qing dynasty]] in 1911, Jin rose through the ranks during Yang's absolute rule over Xinjiang. In 1927 he was named Provincial Commissioner for Civil Affairs in [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]], a post which he held until Yang's assassination in July 1928.{{sfn|Forbes|1986|p=38}}\n\nAfter taking the Yang's post, Jin sent a telegram to [[Nanking]] asking for [[Kuomintang]]'s recognition of his new post. Kuomintang had no other choice but to recognise Jin as a new governor, but under new terminology he was recognised as Provincial Chairman and Commander-in-Chief, unlike his predecessor Yang who held the titles of Provincial Governor and Military Governor.{{sfn|Forbes|1986|p=38}}\n\nImmediately after taking power, Jin took steps to strengthen his power by increasing the secret police, doubling the salaries of army and police and introducing new uniforms. The army was later expanded and new weapons were acquired. The administrative system remained almost unchanged, while Jin employed the practice of his predecessor of appointing relatives and fellow provincials. Subsequently, former [[Yunnan]]ese officials, both [[Han Chinese|Han]] and [[Hui people|Hui]] were replaced by Han from Gansu, especially from the region of Hezhou. He appointed his brother Jin Shuhsin as Provincial Commissioner for Military Affairs and another brother Jin Shuchih was given a senior military post in [[Kashgar]].{{sfn|Forbes|1986|p=38&ndash;39}}\n\nJin expanded Yang's system of internal surveillance and censorship. Besides increasing the strength of both secret and ordinary police, he introduced internal passports which gave him greater control over internal travels thus tightening internal security, as well as giving additional source of revenue for his administration. Traveling outside the province became almost impossible.{{sfn|Forbes|1986|p=39}}\n\nJin's rule of Xinjiang for about a half-decade was characterized by strife caused by corruption, suppression and disruption. Ethnic and religious conflicts were intensified and resulted in numerous riots against his regime and his eventual downfall. Jin confiscated the local [[Turkic people|Turkic]] lands in order to redistribute them to the Chinese, but he gave these lands to his personal associates. The deception caused the Chinese to become the targets of hatred. Jin also favored the Han over the Turkic (such as the [[Uyghur people|Uighur]]s) and intensified ethnic conflicts between the Uighurs and Chinese. In April 1933 Jin's [[White Emigre|White Russian]] troops changed allegiance, encouraged revolt in Xinjiang, ended his reign and forced him to flee to the [[USSR]]. He was succeeded by [[Sheng Shicai]].{{sfn|Starr|2004|p=71}} Jin incurred the wrath of the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) when, without approval, he signed an arms treaty with the [[Soviet Union]]. The Tungan General [[Ma Zhongying]] allied himself with the KMT and his troops became the [[36th Division (National Revolutionary Army)|36th Division of the National Revolutionary Army]] (NRA). Ma was ordered to overthrow Jin.{{sfn|Forbes|1986|p=106}} Jin however, was overthrown after the [[First Battle of Urumqi (1933)]] by White Russian troops under Colonel [[Pavel Pappengut]]. When he returned to China in October 1933 he was arrested by the KMT, brought to trial in March 1935 and sentenced to 3-1/2 years imprisonment. However, the KMT pardoned him on 10 October 1935 and he was released from prison the next day.{{sfn|Forbes|1986|p=106}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kvxwAAAAMAAJ&dq=aitchen+wu&q=chin+shu-jen+treaty|title=Turkistan Tumult|author=Aitchen Wu, Aichen Wu|year=1984|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=|isbn=0-19-583839-4|pages=278|accessdate=2010-06-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Who's Who in China; Biographies of Chinese leaders |year=1936 |location=Shanghai|publisher=THE CHINA WEEKLY REVIEW |url=https://archive.org/stream/5edwhoswhoinchina00shanuoft#page/52/mode/2up |page=52 |isbn= | ref=harv }}</ref>\n\n== Footnotes ==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n\n=== Books ===\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Forbes |first=Andrew D.

It provides wide views and you can see Donaghadee Road and the carry out easily. Popular with doggers and for car park shenanigans. It was built as a memorial to [[Charles Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry]] and was originally known as the '''Londonderry Monument'''. Its architectural style is [[Scottish baronial architecture#Scottish Baronial Revival|Scottish Baronial Revival]].{{harv|Howley|1993}}\n\n== Name and location ==\nNowadays, the tower on Scrabo Hill is usually just called Scrabo Tower and is visited for its views and surroundings. However, its original name was Londonderry Monument or Memorial. That name referred to the [[Marquess of Londonderry|Marquesses of Londonderry]] and only indirectly to the town or county of that name, which is {{convert|87|miles|km}} away. The marquesses owned much ground around the hill. The hill and tower rise over the town of [[Newtownards]], {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Belfast. As the tower dominates the town, it is often used as an emblem for Newtownards. The tower is built on the site of a prehistoric hill fort.{{sfn|Historic Building Details|loc=[https://apps.communities-ni.gov.uk/Buildings/buildview.aspx?id=6620 Historic Building Details HB Ref No: HB24/11/031a]|ps=: \"During the Bronze Age the summit of Scrabo Hill was the site of a considerable settlement, enclosed within an oval hill fort.\"}}{{sfn|Dublin Builder|1865|p=124a|ps=: \"The excavations for the foundations disclosed a vast quantity of wild boar tusks and bones, suggesting that the elevated position had been formerly the scene of Druidical sacrifices or of pre-historic pic-nics.\"}} Scrabo is pronounced {{IPAc-en|'|s|k|r|\u00e6|b|ou}} according to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC){{sfn|Pointon|1990|p=[https://archive.org/details/bbcpronouncingdi00gepo/page/217 217] |ps=: \"skr\u00e6bo\u028a\"}} or {{IPA-sco|\u02c8skr\u0251\u02d0bo|}} according to the pronunciation heard on the ''[[Placenames Database of Ireland]]'' website.<ref name=DCU>{{cite web |url=https://www.logainm.ie/en/1413295 |title=The Placenames Database of Ireland |publisher=Dublin City University |accessdate=1 September 2018}}</ref> The pronunciation of the final vowel as the pure sound [o] rather than the diphthong [ou] is also attested by the spelling variation Scraboh.{{sfn|Dublin Builder|1865|p=124b|ps=: \"The Londonderry Monument, Scraboh Hill, Co Down\"}}\n\nTwo etymologies are proposed for Scrabo. The first derives the name from Irish ''screabach'' meaning \"rough stony land\".{{sfn|McKay|2007|p=129}} Screabach is also the Irish name of the Scrabo townland in which the hill lies.<ref name=DCU /> The second derives the name from Irish ''scraith b\u00f3'', which means \"sward of the cow\",<ref>[https://www.logainm.ie/en/ Placenames Database of Ireland].

This derivation explains the final \"o\" of Scrabo.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThe tower commemorates the [[Charles Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry|3rd Marquess of Londonderry]], who was born Charles William Stewart in 1788. He fought in the Napoleonic Wars.{{sfn|Vane |1828}} He became married twice first Catherine Bligh and then [[Frances Vane, Marchioness of Londonderry|Frances Anne Vane]]. At his second wife was a rich heiress and the marriage contract obliged him to change his surname to hers, which explains why he was first called Stewart and later Vane. He succeeded his half-brother [[Viscount Castlereagh]] as marquess in 1822 and became owner of the family estate in County Down. The estate's great house, [[Mount Stewart]], became his Irish residence but after his second marriage he lived mostly in England.\n\nIn 1854, when the 3rd Marquess died, his eldest son, [[Frederick Stewart, 4th Marquess of Londonderry]], and his widow, the dowager marchioness, decided to build him a monument. As these two were not at good terms, each conceived and pushed his or her own project. Two monuments resulted: the Irish tower discussed here and an equestrian statue in Durham, England.{{sfn|Lloyd|2004|p=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_0198614063/page/98 98]|ps=: \"an equestrian statue by him by Gaetano Monti was unveiled in the market-place at Durham by Disraeli on 2 December 1861.\"}}\n\nA committee was formed in Newtownards to raise funds by subscription for an Irish monument. The local gentry and the late marquess's friends, among which [[Napoleon III]] of France, donated most of the money, with some of the tenants also contributing.{{sfn|McCavery|1994|p=140a|ps=: \"Two thirds of the cost was raised by 98 individuals (the list was headed by the Emperor Napoleon III of France), most of whom were fellow gentry from Antrim and Down, and personal friends of the Marquess.\"}} Altogether 730 people subscribed.{{sfn|Illustrated London News|1857|p=299a|ps=: \"There was also placed in the jar a list of the subscribers' names, 730 of them all;\"}} The person behind these efforts was his eldest son [[Frederick Stewart, 4th Marquess of Londonderry]].{{sfn|Hyde|1979|p=50|ps=: \"At the same time her husband constructed the great tower on Scrabo Hill overlooking the town in his father's memory.\"}}\n\nThe funds raised allowed for a budget of \u00a32000. At first, the monument was to be built in Newtownards, but it was later shifted to Scrabo Hill where it could be seen from Mount Stewart and where suitable building stone was quarried. In December 1855 the committee decided to hold a design competition.{{sfn|McCavery|1994|p=140b|ps=: \"In 1855, it was decided that the memorial should be erected on Scrabo, and that the design should be subject of a competition with the cost of the work not to exceed \u00a32,000.\"}} The deadline was 1 February 1856.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archiseek.com/2011/1857-scrabo-tower-newtownards-co-down/#.U1k7q_ldVws |publisher=Archiseek |title=1857 \u2013 Scrabo Tower, Newtownards, Co.

Such a tower was considered especially suitable for a Stewart as the [[House of Stuart|Stewarts or Stuarts]] ruled Scotland during the times when peel towers were erected.\n\nThe [[Frederick Temple Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|5th Baron Dufferin and Claneboye]], a neighbour of the Londonderrys, had recently built [[Helen's Tower]], also in the Scottish Baronial style, on the next hill to the north of Scrabo: the new tower was to have more than double the height of theirs.\n\n[[File:Londonderry Memorial Tower (project) Watercolour.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A framed picture showing the tower |Artist' View of the Londonderry Memorial Tower,<ref name=pict>{{cite web |title=Londonderry Memorial Tower on Scrabo Hill |url=http://www.nationaltrustcollections.org.uk/object/1220367 |publisher=National Trust Collections |accessdate=29 July 2018}}</ref> believed to represent the original project by Lanyon & Lynn]]\n\nA gilt-framed picture of the Scrabo Tower, which seems to be a coloured-in wood engraving, is preserved at Mount Stewart. It gives an artist's view of the Londonderry Monument, showing three towers linked by two short stretches of crenellated wall.<ref name=pict /> The middle tower resembles the one built. The others are much smaller.

The author's purpose seems to have been to defend Lanyon and the Londonderrys against accusations of having rigged the competition.

The tower's square part is surmounted by a short setback cylindrical storey that is covered with a steep conical roof. The transition from square to round is achieved by a platform decorated with four corner turrets linked by [[Machicolation|machicolated]] [[battlements]]. The turrets are round and also wear steep conical roofs. The five roofs are entirely built in lapped stone courses. The southeastern turret serves as cap-house over the stairs giving access to the parapet walk (or [[chemin de ronde]]). The other three turrets are smaller and sit on corbelled bases.

The relief is deeply undercut under the coronet and behind the dragon's wing. The coronet is decorated with three leaves and two balls as befits a marquess. The dragon crest represents the Stewart family. The arm (more precisely \"cubit\") with the hand in a gauntlet holding a sword represents the Vane family. The scroll below the coronet and the crests shows the motto (in Latin), which reads: METUENDA COROLLA DRACONIS (the dragon's crest is to be feared).\n\nThe tower should have had eight levels according to the placement of its windows on the wood engraving: the ground floor in the base, six floors in the main body and one in the setback masonry cylinder that occupies the centre of the platform and carries the main roof. When work stopped in 1859, only the ground floor and the first floor had floors and ceilings. All the space in the tower above the first floor's ceiling right up into the cone of the main roof was left empty. The ground floor was the caretaker's apartment. The first floor was planned as an armoury as would be required in a peel tower but was never equipped and used as such.{{sfn|Dublin Builder|1865|p=124f}} This armoury is covered with a brick [[groin vault]], which is the reason why the spacing between the armoury's windows and those of the second floor is wider than those between the other levels in the main body. A proper second floor was created later by inserting a wooden floor as part of the repairs and the upgrading done by the Department of Environment. This second floor was thus gained on the remaining undivided space.\n\nTwo types of stone were used in the tower: whitish to pinkish [[Triassic]] sandstone{{sfn|Hull|1872|pp=269\u2013270|ps=: \"At Scrabo Hill ... sandstone belonging to the upper division of the Trias ... are to be found;\"}} and dark-grey [[dolerite]]. The sandstone, more suitable for fine carvings, was used for [[quoins]], window dressings, stairs, corbels, copings and roofs, as well as for courses that mark limits: the moulding between the base and the main body and the one that separates the stair tower from the cap-house above it. The dolerite is described as [[whinstone]] or as basalt in various sources.{{sfn|Dublin Builder|1865|p=124g\ng|ps=: \"... a green whinstone ...\"}}{{sfn|Historic Building Details|loc=[https://apps.communities-ni.gov.uk/Buildings/buildview.aspx?id=6620 Historic Building Details HB Ref No: HB24/11/031e]|ps=: \"... constructed in random basalt rubble ...\"}} This material is harder and more resistant to weathering than the sandstone but difficult to work. It was cut into blocks of variable size and laid in frequently interrupted courses. The outer surfaces of these blocks were left in rough [[rustication (architecture)|rustication]] with many blocks quite prominent.\n\n[[File:Scrobo_Tower,_from_across_Strangford_Lough.JPG|thumbnail|alt=Photograph on Scrabo Hill with tower seen from far |The tower, seen from the other side of Strangford Lough]]\n\n==Surroundings and view==\nScrabo Hill rises to a height of {{convert|540|ft}} above mean sea level.

It provides wide views and is a landmark that can be seen from afar. It was built as a memorial to [[Charles Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry]] and was originally known as the '''Londonderry Monument'''. Its architectural style is [[Scottish baronial architecture#Scottish Baronial Revival|Scottish Baronial Revival]].{{harv|Howley|1993}}\n\n== Name and location ==\nNowadays, the tower on Scrabo Hill is usually just called Scrabo Tower and is visited for its views and surroundings. However, its original name was Londonderry Monument or Memorial. That name referred to the [[Marquess of Londonderry|Marquesses of Londonderry]] and only indirectly to the town or county of that name, which is {{convert|87|miles|km}} away. The marquesses owned much ground around the hill. The hill and tower rise over the town of [[Newtownards]], {{convert|10|mi|km}} east of Belfast. As the tower dominates the town, it is often used as an emblem for Newtownards. The tower is built on the site of a prehistoric hill fort.{{sfn|Historic Building Details|loc=[https://apps.communities-ni.gov.uk/Buildings/buildview.aspx?id=6620 Historic Building Details HB Ref No: HB24/11/031a]|ps=: \"During the Bronze Age the summit of Scrabo Hill was the site of a considerable settlement, enclosed within an oval hill fort.\"}}{{sfn|Dublin Builder|1865|p=124a|ps=: \"The excavations for the foundations disclosed a vast quantity of wild boar tusks and bones, suggesting that the elevated position had been formerly the scene of Druidical sacrifices or of pre-historic pic-nics.\"}} Scrabo is pronounced {{IPAc-en|'|s|k|r|\u00e6|b|ou}} according to the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC){{sfn|Pointon|1990|p=[https://archive.org/details/bbcpronouncingdi00gepo/page/217 217] |ps=: \"skr\u00e6bo\u028a\"}} or {{IPA-sco|\u02c8skr\u0251\u02d0bo|}} according to the pronunciation heard on the ''[[Placenames Database of Ireland]]'' website.<ref name=DCU>{{cite web |url=https://www.logainm.ie/en/1413295 |title=The Placenames Database of Ireland |publisher=Dublin City University |accessdate=1 September 2018}}</ref> The pronunciation of the final vowel as the pure sound [o] rather than the diphthong [ou] is also attested by the spelling variation Scraboh.{{sfn|Dublin Builder|1865|p=124b|ps=: \"The Londonderry Monument, Scraboh Hill, Co Down\"}}\n\nTwo etymologies are proposed for Scrabo. The first derives the name from Irish ''screabach'' meaning \"rough stony land\".{{sfn|McKay|2007|p=129}} Screabach is also the Irish name of the Scrabo townland in which the hill lies.<ref name=DCU /> The second derives the name from Irish ''scraith b\u00f3'', which means \"sward of the cow\",<ref>[https://www.logainm.ie/en/ Placenames Database of Ireland].

This derivation explains the final \"o\" of Scrabo.\n\n==History==\n===Origins===\nThe tower commemorates the [[Charles Vane, 3rd Marquess of Londonderry|3rd Marquess of Londonderry]], who was born Charles William Stewart in 1788. He fought in the Napoleonic Wars.{{sfn|Vane |1828}} He became married twice first Catherine Bligh and then [[Frances Vane, Marchioness of Londonderry|Frances Anne Vane]]. At his second wife was a rich heiress and the marriage contract obliged him to change his surname to hers, which explains why he was first called Stewart and later Vane. He succeeded his half-brother [[Viscount Castlereagh]] as marquess in 1822 and became owner of the family estate in County Down. The estate's great house, [[Mount Stewart]], became his Irish residence but after his second marriage he lived mostly in England.\n\nIn 1854, when the 3rd Marquess died, his eldest son, [[Frederick Stewart, 4th Marquess of Londonderry]], and his widow, the dowager marchioness, decided to build him a monument. As these two were not at good terms, each conceived and pushed his or her own project. Two monuments resulted: the Irish tower discussed here and an equestrian statue in Durham, England.{{sfn|Lloyd|2004|p=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_0198614063/page/98 98]|ps=: \"an equestrian statue by him by Gaetano Monti was unveiled in the market-place at Durham by Disraeli on 2 December 1861.\"}}\n\nA committee was formed in Newtownards to raise funds by subscription for an Irish monument. The local gentry and the late marquess's friends, among which [[Napoleon III]] of France, donated most of the money, with some of the tenants also contributing.{{sfn|McCavery|1994|p=140a|ps=: \"Two thirds of the cost was raised by 98 individuals (the list was headed by the Emperor Napoleon III of France), most of whom were fellow gentry from Antrim and Down, and personal friends of the Marquess.\"}} Altogether 730 people subscribed.{{sfn|Illustrated London News|1857|p=299a|ps=: \"There was also placed in the jar a list of the subscribers' names, 730 of them all;\"}} The person behind these efforts was his eldest son [[Frederick Stewart, 4th Marquess of Londonderry]].{{sfn|Hyde|1979|p=50|ps=: \"At the same time her husband constructed the great tower on Scrabo Hill overlooking the town in his father's memory.\"}}\n\nThe funds raised allowed for a budget of \u00a32000. At first, the monument was to be built in Newtownards, but it was later shifted to Scrabo Hill where it could be seen from Mount Stewart and where suitable building stone was quarried. In December 1855 the committee decided to hold a design competition.{{sfn|McCavery|1994|p=140b|ps=: \"In 1855, it was decided that the memorial should be erected on Scrabo, and that the design should be subject of a competition with the cost of the work not to exceed \u00a32,000.\"}} The deadline was 1 February 1856.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archiseek.com/2011/1857-scrabo-tower-newtownards-co-down/#.U1k7q_ldVws |publisher=Archiseek |title=1857 \u2013 Scrabo Tower, Newtownards, Co.

Such a tower was considered especially suitable for a Stewart as the [[House of Stuart|Stewarts or Stuarts]] ruled Scotland during the times when peel towers were erected.\n\nThe [[Frederick Temple Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|5th Baron Dufferin and Claneboye]], a neighbour of the Londonderrys, had recently built [[Helen's Tower]], also in the Scottish Baronial style, on the next hill to the north of Scrabo: the new tower was to have more than double the height of theirs.\n\n[[File:Londonderry Memorial Tower (project) Watercolour.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A framed picture showing the tower |Artist' View of the Londonderry Memorial Tower,<ref name=pict>{{cite web |title=Londonderry Memorial Tower on Scrabo Hill |url=http://www.nationaltrustcollections.org.uk/object/1220367 |publisher=National Trust Collections |accessdate=29 July 2018}}</ref> believed to represent the original project by Lanyon & Lynn]]\n\nA gilt-framed picture of the Scrabo Tower, which seems to be a coloured-in wood engraving, is preserved at Mount Stewart. It gives an artist's view of the Londonderry Monument, showing three towers linked by two short stretches of crenellated wall.<ref name=pict /> The middle tower resembles the one built. The others are much smaller. Wood engravings similar to this picture have been published in the [[The Illustrated London News|Illustrated London News]]{{sfn|Illustrated London News|1857|p=299b|ps=: \"Memorial to the late Marquis of Londonderry, in course of Erection on Scrabo Hill, County Down, Ireland\"}}<ref>{{cite news |title=Memorial To The Late Marquis Of Londonderry, In Course Of Erection On Scrabo Hill, County Down, Ireland (picture from Dublin Libraries) |work=The Illustrated London News |issue=March 28, 1857 |page=299 |url=http://www.dublincity.ie/image/libraries/iln-028-scrabo}}</ref> and the [[Dublin Builder]]. It seems that these pictures represent the original project before simplification to cut cost.

Work ceased in 1859 after the cost had risen to \u00a33010.{{sfn|McCavery|1994|p=140c|ps=: \"In the end, however, the 135 feet high monument actually cost \u00a33,010.\"}} The contractor was ruined, and the interior was left unfinished. In 1865 the Dublin Builder somewhat belatedly published an article about the tower. The author's purpose seems to have been to defend Lanyon and the Londonderrys against accusations of having rigged the competition. This article overstates the tower's height as 195&nbsp;feet instead of 135 and understates the cost of the tower as \u00a32300 instead of \u00a33010.{{sfn|Dublin Builder|1865|p=124c|ps=: \"The cost was about 2,300, and the total height 195&nbsp;feet.\"}} It also exaggerates the contribution made by the tenants to the point of making us believe that the tower was exclusively financed by the tenants.{{sfn|Dublin Builder|1865|p=124d|ps=: \"It has been erected by the tenantry of the late Marquis of Londonderry, ...\"}}\n\nThe tower is massive and imposing, symbolizing landlord power.{{sfn|McCavery|1994|p=141|ps=: \" \"... if the tower is a symbol of anything, it is surely a symbol of landlord power.\"}} This effect was the main purpose according to the article in the Dublin Builder.{{sfn|Dublin Builder|1865|p=124h|ps=: \"... size and mass were the chief objects to be attained at a comparably small cost ...\"}} In later appreciations it is found \"more curious than beautiful\"{{sfn|Williams|1995|p=112|ps=: \"more curious than beautiful\"}} and \"one of the finest examples of 19th century folly towers\".{{sfn|Howley|1993|p=[https://archive.org/details/folliesgardenbui00howl/page/54 54, right column, line 5]|ps=: \"Two of the finest examples of nineteenth-century folly towers are found standing within a few miles from each other, at Scrabo and Clandeboye in north Co.

His family ran a tearoom in the tower until 1966<ref name=\"Orme\" /> despite the lack of water at the top of the hill. The tower and the grounds on which it stands were then acquired by the state. In 1977, the tower was listed as a [[list of Grade B+ listed buildings in County Down|Grade B+ historic building]].{{sfn|Historic Building Details|loc=[https://apps.communities-ni.gov.uk/Buildings/buildview.aspx?id=6620 Historic Building Details HB Ref No: HB24/11/031b]|ps=: \"Survey 2: B+\"}} The Department of Environment spent \u00a320,000 on the tower in 1992, repairing windows, repointing the masonry, adding lightning protection and fitting in a wooden floor between the second and third floor, which had been omitted in 1859 to cut costs.{{sfn|Brett|2002|p=272|ps=: \"Having fallen in considerable disrepair, it was taken into public ownership, and \u00a320,000 was spent on its restoration in 1992.\"}} The tower now stands in the Scrabo [[Country Park]], which is managed by the Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/Scrabo-Tower-and-Country-Park-Newtownards-P2886 |title=Scrabo Tower and Country Park |publisher=Northern Ireland Tourist Board |accessdate=24 April 2014 }}</ref> In 2014, the NIEA announced that water ingress had damaged the electricity supply, and citing safety concerns, closed the tower to visitors.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.u.tv/News/Scrabo-Tower-shut-for-foreseeable-future/d6d99a3e-f9de-493a-a2f8-b89a4766c47a |publisher=UTV News |title=Scrabo Tower shut for foreseeable future |date=22 April 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-27114225 | publisher=BBC News| title=Scrabo Tower: County Down monument closed to the public |date=22 April 2014 }}</ref>\nBy 2015, the tower opened occasionally,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/Scrabo-Tower-for-EHOD-2015-Newtownards-P52395 |publisher=Northern Ireland Tourist Board |accessdate=13 September 2015 |title=Scrabo Tower - European Heritage Open Day (EHOD) 2015 Cultural Event - 12-13 September}}</ref>\nand in 2017 it was fully reopened to the public.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-40525496|publisher=BBC|title=Scrabo Tower reopens to the public |date=7 July 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Scrabo_Tower_near_Newtownards_(6)_-_geograph.org.uk_-_1398819.jpg|thumb|alt=Photograph of the tower's roofs |The tower's roofs in 2009.

The base contains the ground floor. It has [[Batter (walls)|battered]] (sloped) outer surfaces. The main body has vertical walls. The limit between the base and the main body is marked by a sandstone [[belt course]]. The base and the main body are square in plan and comprise a round [[staircase tower|stair tower]] that projects from the southeast corner. The tower's square part is surmounted by a short setback cylindrical storey that is covered with a steep conical roof. The transition from square to round is achieved by a platform decorated with four corner turrets linked by [[Machicolation|machicolated]] [[battlements]]. The turrets are round and also wear steep conical roofs. The five roofs are entirely built in lapped stone courses. The southeastern turret serves as cap-house over the stairs giving access to the parapet walk (or [[chemin de ronde]]). The other three turrets are smaller and sit on corbelled bases. Each of these bases consists of a pile of five roll-moulded corbel courses. A chimney stack is attached to the inner side of the northwestern turret.{{sfn|Historic Building Details|loc=[https://apps.communities-ni.gov.uk/Buildings/buildview.aspx?id=6620 Historic Building Details HB Ref No: HB24/11/031d]|ps=: \"Exterior Description And Setting\"}}\n\nThe tower's entrance door is on the north face. It is accessed by a short outer stair. The door is surmounted by a commemorative plaque in a bluish black stone, probably slate. The inscription dedicates the monument to the 3rd Marquess. Following his change of surname,<ref>https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/17480/page/906 ...may, in compliance with the provisions of the last will and testament of the said Sir Henry Vane, Bart. from henceforth continue respectively to use the surname of Vane only, ...</ref> he is called Vane rather than Stewart. The [[post-nominal]] KG stands for [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]]. The \"& c\" should be read \"et cetera\" and means that the marquess's many lesser post-nominals were omitted.\n\n<div style=\"background: gainsboro; border: thin solid gray; float: left; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: smaller; margin: 6px 16px 6px 0;  padding: 6px 16px; text-align: center;\">\nERECTED<br />\nIN MEMORY OF<br />\nCHARLES WILLIAM VANE<br />\n3<sup><span><small style=\"font-family: sans-serif\">RD</small></span></sup> MARQUIS OF LONDONDERRY<br />\nKG & c<br />\nBY HIS TENANTRY AND FRIENDS<br />\n<span style=\"font-family: sans-serif\"><small>\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014<br />\nFAME BELONGS TO HISTORY, REMEMBRANCE TO US</small></span><br />\n1857\n</div>\n\n[[File:CIMG1476 ScraboPlaque.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Photograph of the inscription and relief above the tower's entrance |Inscription surmounted by a relief showing Londonderry coronet, crests & motto]]\n\nAbove the plaque is a recess filled with a relief in white limestone or marble showing the coronet, two crests (dragon and sword arm), and the motto of the [[Marquess of Londonderry|marquesses of Londonderry]]. The relief is deeply undercut under the coronet and behind the dragon's wing. The coronet is decorated with three leaves and two balls as befits a marquess. The dragon crest represents the Stewart family. The arm (more precisely \"cubit\") with the hand in a gauntlet holding a sword represents the Vane family. The scroll below the coronet and the crests shows the motto (in Latin), which reads: METUENDA COROLLA DRACONIS (the dragon's crest is to be feared).\n\nThe tower should have had eight levels according to the placement of its windows on the wood engraving: the ground floor in the base, six floors in the main body and one in the setback masonry cylinder that occupies the centre of the platform and carries the main roof. When work stopped in 1859, only the ground floor and the first floor had floors and ceilings. All the space in the tower above the first floor's ceiling right up into the cone of the main roof was left empty. The ground floor was the caretaker's apartment. The first floor was planned as an armoury as would be required in a peel tower but was never equipped and used as such.{{sfn|Dublin Builder|1865|p=124f}} This armoury is covered with a brick [[groin vault]], which is the reason why the spacing between the armoury's windows and those of the second floor is wider than those between the other levels in the main body. A proper second floor was created later by inserting a wooden floor as part of the repairs and the upgrading done by the Department of Environment. This second floor was thus gained on the remaining undivided space.\n\nTwo types of stone were used in the tower: whitish to pinkish [[Triassic]] sandstone{{sfn|Hull|1872|pp=269\u2013270|ps=: \"At Scrabo Hill ... sandstone belonging to the upper division of the Trias ... are to be found;\"}} and dark-grey [[dolerite]]. The sandstone, more suitable for fine carvings, was used for [[quoins]], window dressings, stairs, corbels, copings and roofs, as well as for courses that mark limits: the moulding between the base and the main body and the one that separates the stair tower from the cap-house above it. The dolerite is described as [[whinstone]] or as basalt in various sources.{{sfn|Dublin Builder|1865|p=124g\ng|ps=: \"... a green whinstone ...\"}}{{sfn|Historic Building Details|loc=[https://apps.communities-ni.gov.uk/Buildings/buildview.aspx?id=6620 Historic Building Details HB Ref No: HB24/11/031e]|ps=: \"... constructed in random basalt rubble ...\"}} This material is harder and more resistant to weathering than the sandstone but difficult to work. It was cut into blocks of variable size and laid in frequently interrupted courses. The outer surfaces of these blocks were left in rough [[rustication (architecture)|rustication]] with many blocks quite prominent.\n\n[[File:Scrobo_Tower,_from_across_Strangford_Lough.JPG|thumbnail|alt=Photograph on Scrabo Hill with tower seen from far |The tower, seen from the other side of Strangford Lough]]\n\n==Surroundings and view==\nScrabo Hill rises to a height of {{convert|540|ft}} above mean sea level. The viewing platform or parapet walk of the tower, reached by climbing 122 steps, provides views over [[Strangford Lough]] and its islands, as well as the towns of Newtownards and [[Comber]]. As the area to the south and southwest of Scrabo Hill is part of the Ulster [[Drumlin]] Belt, this glacial landform can be very well observed from the tower.\n\nOn clear days Helen's Tower in the north, the [[Copeland Islands]] with their lighthouse and the Scottish coast ([[Mull of Kintyre]], [[Ailsa Craig]] and [[Rhins of Galloway]])<ref name=Orme /> beyond the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]] in the northeast, the [[Isle of Man]] in the southeast, the [[Mourne Mountains]] in the south, as well as [[Divis]] Mountain and [[Cavehill|Cave Hill]] over Belfast in the west can be seen.\n\nScrabo Country Park, in which the tower stands, includes parts of the top and the eastern and southern slopes of Scrabo Hill as well as Killynether Wood.<ref>{{cite web |last=Department of Environment |title=Scrabo Landscape Character Assessment (LCA 101) |url=https://www.daera-ni.gov.uk/sites/default/files/publications/doe/environment-land-information-NI-landscape-character-assessment-scrabo-2006.pdf |publisher=Department of Environment |accessdate=20 July 2018}}</ref> The eastern part of the hill is of geological interest because outcrops in the South Quarry reveal contacts between sediments (sandstone) and locally cross-cutting [[sill (geology)|sills]] of intrusive rocks (dolerite).

He is the author of more than 200 books and has written more than 200 magazine articles and short stories, and several plays, all primarily for [[teenagers]]. He won the [[Margaret Edwards Award]] from the [[American Library Association]] in 1997 for his lifetime contribution in writing for teens.<ref name=edwards/>\n\n==Biography==\n\nPaulsen has written some fragmented autobiographical buttface mgee works, such as ''Eastern Sun, Winter Moon: An Autobiographical Odyssey''. The book, which is written in first person, begins when Paulsen was seven, living in Chicago with his mother. Paulsen described several traumatic occurrences that transpired during the three years that are chronicled by the book. For example, one day while his mother was napping, Gary sneaked outside to play.  There a vagrant snatched him and apparently attempted to molest him, but his mother fricker suddenly appeared on the scene and beat the man to death. Paulsen reported his mother's many adulterous affairs in ''Eastern Sun'', suggesting that the man he called \"father\" was not really his biological father.  He also discussed his mother's alcoholism.  He told how she would bring him to a bar and had him sing for his supper, even though she had an income from her work in an ammunition factory, and he felt there was no need for this.  When World War II ended, Gary's father sent for him and his mother to come join him in the [[Philippines]], where he was stationed.  A great part of the book is dedicated to the voyage by naval vessel to the Philippines.  During the trip, Gary witnessed a plane crash.  He, his mother, and the people who were also being transported on this ship, looked on as many of the airplane's passengers were killed or maimed by the sharks who would follow the ship consuming waste.  His mother, the only woman aboard, helped the [[corpsman]] care for the surviving victims.  After arriving in [[Hawaii]], according to Paulsen, his mother began an affair with the ship's corpsman.<ref name=EasternSun>{{cite book|last=Paulsen|first=Gary|title=Eastern Sun, Winter Moon|url=https://archive.org/details/easternsunwinter00paul|url-access=registration|year=1993|publisher=Harcourt Brace|location=New York|isbn=0-15-600203-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/easternsunwinter00paul/page/244 244]}}</ref>\n\nIn elementary he was very bad at literacy class and struggled with it. The accounts in ''Eastern Sun'' ended when Gary and his mother left Manila.  Bits and pieces of Gary's adolescence can be pieced together in ''[[Guts: The True Stories Behind Hatchet and the Brian Books]]''. In that book, Paulsen discussed the ways in which he survived between the ages of twelve and fourteen back in Minnesota.  He barely mentioned his parents except to say that they were too busy being drunk to stock the refrigerator. He worked several jobs during this time, including setting pins at the bowling alley, delivering newspapers and working as a farm hand.  He bought his own school supplies and a rifle, which he used to hunt for sustenance.  Eventually, he gave up the rifle and manufactured his own bow and arrows which he used to hunt deer.<ref name=Guts>{{cite book|last=Paulsen|first=Gary|title=Guts: The True Stories Behind Hatchet And The Brian Books|year=2001|publisher=Random house|location=New York|isbn=978-0-385-32650-6}}</ref>\n\nMuch of what is known about Gary Paulsen's life is revealed in prologues and epilogues of his own books.  In Gary Paulsen's book ''The Quilt'', one of a series of three books based on summers spent with his grandmother, Paulsen told about what a tremendous influence his grandmother had on him.  It is difficult to say how factual an autobiography ''The Quilt'' is intended to be, as Paulsen is supposed to have been six years old in this story and yet he made references to events found in ''Eastern Sun'', which is supposed to have been set later.  He also refers to himself, in this book, in third person and only as \"the boy\".<ref name=Quilt>{{cite book|last=Paulsen|first=Gary|title=The Quilt|year=2004|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=0-440-22936-7}}</ref>\n\nEven though Paulsen is now a successful author, he says he chooses to live in relative poverty.  He reportedly lives with his wife, Ruth, who illustrates children's literature, in [[La Luz, New Mexico]]. (ALA reported [[Tularosa, New Mexico]] in 1997.)<ref name=edwards/> He also spends some time living on a house boat on the Pacific Ocean.\n<!--\n   prefer arrangement in sections, at least below this line\n-->\n\nIn 1983, Paulsen entered the {{convert|1150|mi|km|adj=on}} [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race]], and placed 41st<ref name=Iditarod>http://iditarod.com/race-archives/?raceyear=1983&musherid=2942</ref> out of 54 finishers, with an official time of 17 days, 12 hours, 38 minutes, and 38 seconds. In 1990, suffering from heart disease, Paulsen made the decision to give up dog sledding, which he described as the most difficult decision he has ever made. Paulsen would spend more than a decade sailing the Pacific before getting back into dog sledding in 2003. According to his keynote speech on October 13, 2007, at the [[Sinclair Lewis]] writing conference in [[Sauk Centre, Minnesota]], he still intended to compete in the Iditarod. He is listed in the \"Withdrawn/Scratched\" section of the 1985 and [[2006 Iditarod]]. Paulsen is an outdoorsman (a [[hunter]] and [[animal trapping|trapper]]), who maintains a {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} spread north of [[Willow, Alaska]], where he breeds and trains sled dogs for the Iditarod.\n\nMuch of Paulsen's work features the outdoors and highlights the importance of nature. He often uses \"coming of age\" themes in his novels, where a character masters the art of survival in isolation as a rite of passage to manhood and maturity. He is critical of technology and has been called a [[Luddite]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/26/books/26paul.html?ex=1173157200&en=2f33b070f21704d7&ei=5070|work=The New York Times|title=On the Road and Between the Pages, an Author Is Restless for Adventure|author=Anne Goodwin Sides|date=August 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe Hatchet series, or Brian's adventures, five novels published from 1987 to 2003, comprises some of Paulsen's best known work. ''[[Dogsong]]'' (1985), My Life in Dog Years (1998), ''The Winter Room'' (1989), and ''[[Harris and Me]]'' (1993) are three others of his many popular novels. ''[[Woodsong]]'' (1990) and ''[[Winterdance: The Fine Madness of Running the Iditarod|Winterdance]]'' (1994) are among the most popular books about the Iditarod.\n\nThe ALA [[Margaret Edwards Award]] recognizes one writer and a particular body of work for \"significant and lasting contribution to young adult literature\". Paulsen won the annual award in 1997, when the panel cited six books published from 1983 to 1990:<!--chron order --> ''Dancing Carl'', ''Hatchet'' (first in the series), ''The Crossing'', ''[[The Winter Room]]'', ''[[Canyons (novel)|Canyons]]'', and ''Woodsong''.

They had been hacked to death and separately buried in shallow graves.

She had met Michael X through her relationship with [[Malcolm X]]'s cousin [[Hakim Jamal]].\n\nMichael X fled to [[Guyana]] a few days later and was captured there.
