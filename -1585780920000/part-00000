The city is adjacent to the [[Brookfield (town), Wisconsin|Town of Brookfield]].\n\n==History==\nBrookfield is west of [[Milwaukee]] in Waukesha County in an area originally inhabited by [[Potawatomi]] Indians.<ref name=WSHS>[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=15120 Brookfield (brief history)] Wisconsin State Historical Society</ref> The first white settler, William Howe, arrived in 1820 with a Presidential Land Grant giving him title to the area. Soon after, Robert Curren bought a claim in 1836, and established a tavern and inn.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn May 1838, Jacques View Jr., with a large party of white settlers, lead the local [[Potawatomi]] west. By 1839, the population needed a school house, as the 1840 census showed a population of 148. In these 1840's, George Gebhardt started trading with the surrounding [[Potawatomi]] and [[Menominee]] neighbors. 1843 is when the first church was built, by the Irish Catholic congregation, named St. Dominic. 1848 was when telegraph lines were laid through Brookfield, towards [[Waukesha, Wisconsin|Waukesha]]. Communication was made easier due to this. In 1849, [[cholera]] reached Brookfield, and one Laura Grover recalls, \"The death-like stillness was appalling; nothing was seen but the death carts rolling round the streets gathering the recent dead... I believe there were fifty deaths from [[cholera]] that day.\" The same year, 64 Brookfield residents voted in favor of giving suffrage to black residents, and 0 the other way. In 1850, cholera again went through Brookfield, and according to one Earl Thayer, \"The cholera returned... more terrible than the year before. People literally died walking along the streets. Official reports put the toll at over 300.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Brookfield : a fine and fertile land : an early history of the town of Brookfield, Waukesha County, Wisconsin|last=Ramstack, Thomas.|date=2007|publisher=T.

In the year 1850, the Town of Brookfield had 1,944 inhabitants and in land area covered 36 square miles. The town slowly grew over following years, with the economy being mostly agricultural, with Brookfield Junction serving as a commercial center for the surrounding farms.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[American Civil War|Civil War]], an important part of American history, had little affect to this town.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1867, a second rail depot was constructed, which still stands.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1900s, Brookfield gained a new reputation. [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha County]] was called Cow County, U.S.A., as according to advertisers, they claimed that in the county there were more cows than people.

Early subdivisions grew slowly due to the [[Great Depression]] hitting a year later, affecting its growth and killing demand.\n\nDevelopment in Brookfield began to increase after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Suburban development was encouraged by a lack of housing, the baby boom, and government sponsored building programs, which further grew the town, and after several annexations of neighboring communities, an incorporation drive started. The City of Brookfield was incorporated from the [[Brookfield (town), Wisconsin|town of Brookfield]], a portion of which still survives along the city's western edge, on August 14, 1954. The first mayor was Franklin Wirth, and he oversaw the new city, which at the time had a population of 7,900 and covered an area of 17.5 square miles. Much of the land was still in agricultural use, so the city's founders encouraged orderly development of office and industrial areas to cause the community to function with strong industrial and commercial base.\n\nToday, Brookfield covers 27.66 square miles, and numbers 37,920 residents.<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.ci.brookfield.wi.us/index.aspx?nid=59 About Brookfield-History]</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|27.59|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|27.29|sqmi|sqkm|2|abbr=}} is land and {{convert|0.367|sqmi|sqkm|2|abbr=}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/2018_Gazetteer/2018_gaz_place_55.txt|title=US Gazetteer files 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2019-05-26|df=}}</ref> The [[Subcontinental divide|''sub-continental divide'']] passes through Brookfield;

The city is adjacent to the [[Brookfield (town), Wisconsin|Town of Brookfield]].\n\n==History==\nBrookfield is west of [[Milwaukee]] in Waukesha County in an area originally inhabited by [[Potawatomi]] Indians.<ref name=WSHS>[http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/dictionary/index.asp?action=view&term_id=15120 Brookfield (brief history)] Wisconsin State Historical Society</ref> The first white settler, William Howe, arrived in 1820 with a Presidential Land Grant giving him title to the area. Soon after, Robert Curren bought a claim in 1836, and established a tavern and inn.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn May 1838, Jacques View Jr., with a large party of white settlers, lead the local [[Potawatomi]] west. By 1839, the population needed a school house, as the 1840 census showed a population of 148. In these 1840's, George Gebhardt started trading with the surrounding [[Potawatomi]] and [[Menominee]] neighbors. 1843 is when the first church was built, by the Irish Catholic congregation, named St. Dominic. 1848 was when telegraph lines were laid through Brookfield, towards [[Waukesha, Wisconsin|Waukesha]]. Communication was made easier due to this. In 1849, [[cholera]] reached Brookfield, and one Laura Grover recalls, \"The death-like stillness was appalling; nothing was seen but the death carts rolling round the streets gathering the recent dead... I believe there were fifty deaths from [[cholera]] that day.\" The same year, 64 Brookfield residents voted in favor of giving suffrage to black residents, and 0 the other way. In 1850, cholera again went through Brookfield, and according to one Earl Thayer, \"The cholera returned... more terrible than the year before. People literally died walking along the streets. Official reports put the toll at over 300.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Brookfield : a fine and fertile land : an early history of the town of Brookfield, Waukesha County, Wisconsin|last=Ramstack, Thomas.|date=2007|publisher=T.

In the year 1850, the Town of Brookfield had 1,944 inhabitants and in land area covered 36 square miles. The town slowly grew over following years, with the economy being mostly agricultural, with Brookfield Junction serving as a commercial center for the surrounding farms.<ref name=\":0\" /> The [[American Civil War|Civil War]], an important part of American history, had little affect to this town.<ref name=\":1\" /> In 1867, a second rail depot was constructed, which still stands.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the 1900's, Brookfield gained a new reputation. [[Waukesha County, Wisconsin|Waukesha County]] was called Cow County, U.S.A., as according to advertisers, they claimed that in the county there were more cows than people. This was, of course, fantastical, although there were cows. This did help cement [[Wisconsin|Wisconsin's]] dairy reputation. [[World War I|WWI]], one of the biggest wars in history, also didn't have too much of an effect on Brookfield and how we know it today. The [[Spanish flu]], however, did kill many people, but not as many as [[cholera]] had in the past.<ref name=\":1\" /> On May 31, 1914, a tornado hit, devastating the farmers and the rural area.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Brookfield and Elm Grove|last=Ramstack, Thomas.|date=2009|publisher=Arcadia Pub|isbn=9780738560700|location=Charleston, SC|oclc=311792802}}</ref>\n\nThis quiet, rural atmosphere attracted one notorious resident, [[Al Capone]], as he established an area to live and a distillery on Brookfield Road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmtoday.com/content/m_magazine/2011/September/m_092011_92.asp|title=Gangster's paradise|website=www.gmtoday.com|access-date=2019-07-01}}</ref> In 1928, the first suburban development, Kinsey's Garvendale, a residential subdivision, was created. Early subdivisions grew slowly due to the [[Great Depression]] hitting a year later, affecting its growth and killing demand.\n\nDevelopment in Brookfield began to increase after the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Suburban development was encouraged by a lack of housing, the baby boom, and government sponsored building programs, which further grew the town, and after several annexations of neighboring communities, an incorporation drive started. The City of Brookfield was incorporated from the [[Brookfield (town), Wisconsin|town of Brookfield]], a portion of which still survives along the city's western edge, on August 14, 1954. The first mayor was Franklin Wirth, and he oversaw the new city, which at the time had a population of 7,900 and covered an area of 17.5 square miles. Much of the land was still in agricultural use, so the city's founders encouraged orderly development of office and industrial areas to cause the community to function with strong industrial and commercial base.\n\nToday, Brookfield covers 27.66 square miles, and numbers 37,920 residents.<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.ci.brookfield.wi.us/index.aspx?nid=59 About Brookfield-History]</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|27.59|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|27.29|sqmi|sqkm|2|abbr=}} is land and {{convert|0.367|sqmi|sqkm|2|abbr=}} is water.<ref name=\"Gazetteer files\">{{cite web|url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/2018_Gazetteer/2018_gaz_place_55.txt|title=US Gazetteer files 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2019-05-26|df=}}</ref> The [[Subcontinental divide|''sub-continental divide'']] passes through Brookfield;

The island of [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] is the most southerly point in the United Kingdom, being over {{convert|4|mi}} further south than the most southerly point of the [[British mainland]] at [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]].\n\nThe population of all the islands at the 2011 census was 2,203.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/scilly-islands/e06000053 |title=UK Census Data 2011 |work=UK Census Data |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}</ref> Scilly forms part of the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Cornwall, and some services are combined with those of Cornwall. However, since 1890, the islands have had a separate local authority. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a county council and today is known as the [[Council of the Isles of Scilly]].\n\nThe adjective \"Scillonian\" is sometimes used for people or things related to the archipelago. The [[Duchy of Cornwall]] owns most of the [[freehold (law)|freehold]] land on the islands. Tourism is a major part of the local economy, along with agriculture\u2014particularly the production of [[cut flowers]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe islands may correspond to the [[Cassiterides]] ('Tin Isles') believed by some to have been visited by the [[Phoenicia]]ns and mentioned by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However, the archipelago itself does not contain much [[tin]].\n\nThe isles were off the coast of the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic Celtic]] kingdom of [[Dumnonia]] and later its offshoot, Kernow ([[Cornwall]]), and may have been a part of these polities until their conquest by the English in the 10th century AD.\n\nIt is likely that until relatively recent times the islands were much larger and perhaps joined together into one island named Ennor. Rising sea levels flooded the central plain around 400\u2013500 AD, forming the current 55 islands and islets, if an island is defined as \"land surrounded by water at high tide and supporting land vegetation\".<ref>'The Fortunate Islands' by R.L.

Born {{circa}} 960, Olaf had raided various European cities and fought in several wars. In 986 he met a Christian [[clairvoyance|seer]] on the Isles of Scilly. He was probably a follower of [[Priscillian]] and part of the tiny Christian community that was exiled here from Spain by [[Emperor Maximus]] for [[Priscillianism]]. In [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s Royal Sagas of Norway, it is stated that this seer told him:\n<blockquote>Thou wilt become a renowned king, and do celebrated deeds. Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and others' good; and that thou mayst have no doubt of the truth of this answer, listen to these tokens. When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and immediately thou shalt let thyself be baptised.</blockquote>\n\nThe legend continues that, as the seer foretold, Olaf was attacked by a group of [[Mutiny|mutineers]] upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the [[Haakon Jarl]] was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.\n\nWith the [[Norman Conquest]], the Isles of Scilly came more under centralised control. About 20 years later, the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] was conducted. The islands would have formed part of the \"[[Exeter]] Domesday\" circuit, which included Cornwall, [[Devon]], Dorset, [[Somerset]], and [[Wiltshire]].\n\nIn the mid-12th century, there was reportedly a Viking attack on the Isles of Scilly, called '''{{lang|non|Syllingar}}''' by the Norse,<ref name=\"OrkSaga\">Anderson, Joseph (Ed.) (1893) ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]''. Translated by J\u00f3n A. Hjaltalin & Gilbert Goudie. Edinburgh. James Thin and Mercat Press (1990 reprint). {{ISBN|0-901824-25-9}}</ref> recorded in the ''{{lang|non|[[Orkneyinga saga]]}}''\u2014 [[Sweyn Asleifsson]] \"went south, under Ireland, and seized a barge belonging to some monks in Syllingar and plundered it\".<ref name=OrkSaga /> (Chap LXXIII)\n\n<blockquote>...the three chiefs \u2013 Swein, \u00deorbj\u00f6rn and Eirik \u2013 went out on a plundering expedition. They went first to the Su\u00f0reyar [Hebrides], and all along the west to the Syllingar, where they gained a great victory in Mar\u00eduh\u00f6fn on Columba's-mass [9 June], and took much booty. Then they returned to the Orkneys.<ref name=OrkSaga /></blockquote>\n\n\"{{lang|non|Mar\u00eduh\u00f6fn}}\" literally means \"Mary's Harbour/Haven\". The name does not make it clear if it referred to a harbour on a larger island than today's St Mary's, or a whole island.\n\nIt is generally considered that Cornwall, and possibly the Isles of Scilly, came under the dominion of the English Crown late in the reign of [[\u00c6thelstan]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 924\u2013939). In early times one group of islands was in the possession of a confederacy of hermits. [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] (r. 1100\u201335) gave it to the [[Tavistock Abbey|abbey of Tavistock]] who established a priory on [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], which was abolished at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cornish Church Guide |last=Henderson |first=Charles |location=Truro |publisher=Oscar Blackford |year=1925 |page=194 }}</ref>\n\n===Later Middle Ages and early modern period===\n[[File:Kernow Hundreds.png|thumb|Scilly was one of the [[Hundreds of Cornwall]] (formerly known as Cornish Shires) in the early 19th century.]]\n[[File:Scilly-bartholomew02 large.jpg|thumb|Scilly Isles: map by John Bartholomew (1874)]]\n\nAt the turn of the 14th century, the Abbot and convent of Tavistock Abbey petitioned the king,\n\n<blockquote>stat[ing] that they hold certain isles in the sea between Cornwall and Ireland, of which the largest is called Scilly, to which ships come passing between France, Normandy, Spain, [[Bayonne]], [[Gascony]], Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Cornwall: and, because they feel that in the event of a war breaking out between the kings of England and France, or between any of the other places mentioned, they would not have enough power to do justice to these sailors, they ask that they might exchange these islands for lands in Devon, saving the churches on the islands appropriated to them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7710638&queryType=1&resultcount=7 |title=Petitioners: Abbot and convent of Tavistock.

The names provide a wide variety of origins, e.g. Robert and Henry Sage (English), Richard de Tregenestre (Cornish), Ace de Veldre (French), Davy Gogch (possibly Welsh, or Cornish), and Adam le Fuiz Yaldicz (Spanish?).\n\nIt is not known at what point the islanders stopped speaking the [[Cornish language]], but the language seems to have gone into decline in Cornwall beginning in the [[Late Middle Ages]]; it was still dominant between the islands and Bodmin at the time of the Reformation, but it suffered an accelerated decline thereafter. The islands appear to have lost the old Celtic language before parts of [[Penwith]] on the mainland, in contrast to the history of [[Irish language|Irish]] or [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] captured the isles, only to see their garrison mutiny and return the isles to the [[Cavalier|Royalists]]. By 1651 the Royalist governor, [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath|Sir John Grenville]], was using the islands as a base for [[privateering]] raids on Commonwealth and Dutch shipping. The Dutch admiral [[Maarten Tromp]] sailed to the isles and on arriving on 30 May 1651 demanded compensation. In the absence of compensation or a satisfactory reply, he declared war on England in June, but declined to challenge Blake for the isles.<ref>Blakemore, Richard J. and Marphy, Elaine. (2018).

Blake's initial attack on [[Old Grimsby]] failed, but the next attacks succeeded in taking [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] and [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]]. Blake placed a battery on Tresco to fire on [[St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], but one of the guns exploded, killing its crew and injuring Blake. A second battery proved more successful. Subsequently, Grenville and Blake negotiated terms that permitted the Royalists to surrender honourably. The Parliamentary forces then set to fortifying the islands. They built [[Cromwell's Castle]]\u2014a gun platform on the west side of Tresco\u2014using materials scavenged from an earlier gun platform further up the hill. Although this poorly sited earlier platform dated back to the 1550s, it is now referred to as [[King Charles's Castle]]. In March 1646 the [[Charles II of England|Prince of Wales]] escaped from Falmouth to the isles before seeking a safer base in Jersey.<ref>Blakemore & Murphy.

They were styled ''Governors of Scilly'' and the Godolphins and their Osborne relatives held this position until 1834. In 1834 [[Augustus Smith (politician)|Augustus John Smith]] acquired the lease from the Duchy for \u00a320,000.{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}} Smith created the title ''Lord Proprietor of the Isles of Scilly'' for himself, and many of his actions were unpopular. The lease remained in his family until it expired for most of the Isles in 1920 when ownership reverted to the Duchy of Cornwall.

The chief agricultural product is cut flowers, mostly [[daffodil]]s. Exposure to [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] winds also means that spectacular winter gales lash the islands from time to time. This is reflected in the landscape, most clearly seen on Tresco where the lush [[Tresco Abbey Gardens|Abbey Gardens]] on the sheltered southern end of the island contrast with the low [[calluna|heather]] and bare rock sculpted by the wind on the exposed northern end.\n\n[[Natural England]] has designated the Isles of Scilly as [[National Character Area]] 158.<ref>[http://www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/158_Isles_of_scilly_tcm6-32162.pdf ''NCA 158: Isles of Scilly Key Facts & Data''], Naturalengland.org.uk.

The islands of Annet and Samson have large [[tern]]eries and the islands are well populated by [[pinniped|seals]]. The Isles of Scilly are the only British haunt of the [[lesser white-toothed shrew]] (''Crocidura suaveolens''), where it is known locally as a \"''teak''\" or \"''teke''\".<ref>{{cite news |author=Robinson, H.W. |year=1925 |title=A new British animal discovered in Scilly |newspaper=Scillonian |volume=4 |pages=123\u2013124}}</ref>\n\nThe islands are famous among [[birdwatching|birdwatchers]] for their ability to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is generally in October when it is not unusual for several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far-flung islands first.\n[[File:Isles of Scilly NASA.jpg|thumb|The Isles of Scilly, viewed from the [[International Space Station]].]]\n\n===Tidal influx===\nThe tidal range at the Isles of Scilly is high for an open sea location; the maximum for St.&nbsp;Mary's is {{convert|5.99|m|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the inter-island waters are mostly shallow, which at [[spring tides]] allows for dry land walking between several of the islands. Many of the northern islands can be reached from Tresco, including Bryher, Samson and St.&nbsp;Martin's (requires very low tides). From St.&nbsp;Martin's White Island, Little Ganilly and Great Arthur are reachable. Although the sound between St.&nbsp;Mary's and Tresco, The Road, is fairly shallow, it never becomes totally dry, but according to some sources it should be possible to wade at extreme low tides. Around St.&nbsp;Mary's several minor islands become accessible, including Taylor's Island on the west coast and Tolls Island on the east coast. From St.&nbsp;Agnes, Gugh becomes accessible at each low tide, via a [[tombolo]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe Isles of Scilly features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] : ''Cfb'') bordering on a rare 49\u00b0N [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_528495_en.html |title=Isles of Scilly climate |department=news |website=exeter.ac.uk}}</ref> The average annual temperature is {{convert|11.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}, by far the warmest place in the British Isles.

Suitably qualified students after age eighteen attend universities and colleges on the mainland.\n\n==Economy==\n===Historical context===\nSince the mid-18th century the Scillonian economy has relied on trade with the mainland and beyond as a means of sustaining its population. Over the years the nature of this trade has varied, due to wider economic and political factors that have seen the rise and fall of industries such as [[kelp]] harvesting, [[harbour pilot|pilotage]], smuggling, fishing, [[shipbuilding]] and, latterly, [[floriculture|flower farming]]. In a 1987 study of the Scillonian economy, Neate found that many farms on the islands were struggling to remain profitable due to increasing costs and strong competition from overseas producers, with resulting diversification into tourism. Recent statistics suggest that agriculture on the islands now represents less than 2% of all employment.<ref>Gibson, F, ''My Scillionian Home... its past, its present, its future'', St Ives, 1980</ref><ref name=\"partnership\">''Isles of Scilly Integrated Area Plan 2001\u20132004'', Isles of Scilly Partnership 2001</ref><ref>Neate, S, ''The role of tourism in sustaining farm structures and communities on the Isles of Scilly'' in M Bouquet and M Winter (eds) ''Who From Their Labours Rest?  Conflict and practice in rural tourism'' Aldershot, 1987</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:St Martins Daymark.jpg|thumb|The [[Daymark]] (daylight version of a [[lighthouse]]) on St Martins, the nearest point to the mainland of [[Cornwall]].]]\n\nToday, tourism is estimated to account for 85 percent of the islands' income. The islands have been successful in attracting this investment due to their special environment, favourable summer climate, relaxed culture, efficient co-ordination of tourism providers and good transport links by sea and air to the mainland, uncommon in scale to similar-sized island communities.<ref name=\"council\">''Isles of Scilly Local Plan: A 2020 Vision'', Council of the Isles of Scilly, 2004</ref><ref name=\"touristboard\">''Isles of Scilly 2004, imagine...'', Isles of Scilly Tourist Board, 2004</ref> The majority of visitors stay on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], which has a concentration of holiday accommodation and other amenities. Of the other inhabited islands, [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] is run as a timeshare resort, and is consequently the most obviously tourist-oriented. [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]] and [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]] are more unspoilt, although each has a hotel and other accommodation. [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] has no hotel and is the least-developed of the inhabited islands.\n\nThe islands' economy is highly dependent on tourism, even by the standards of other island communities. \"The concentration [on] a small number of sectors is typical of most similarly sized UK island communities. However, it is the degree of concentration, which is distinctive along with the overall importance of tourism within the economy as a whole and the very limited manufacturing base that stands out\".<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nTourism is also a highly seasonal industry owing to its reliance on outdoor recreation, and the lower number of tourists in winter results in a significant constriction of the islands' commercial activities. However, the tourist season benefits from an extended period of business in October when many [[birding|birdwatchers]] (\"birders\") arrive.\n\n====Ornithology====\nBecause of its position, Scilly is the first landing for many migrant birds, including extreme rarities from North America and [[Siberia]]. Scilly is situated far into the Atlantic Ocean, so many American vagrant birds will make first European landfall in the archipelago.\n\nScilly is responsible for many firsts for Britain, and is particularly good at producing vagrant American [[passerine]]s. If an extremely rare bird turns up, the island will see a significant increase in numbers of birders. This type of birding, chasing after rare birds, is called \"[[Birdwatching#Birding, birdwatching and twitching|twitching]]\".\n\nThe islands are home to [[ornithologist]] [[Will Wagstaff]].\n\n===Employment===\nThe predominance of tourism means that \"tourism is by far the main sector throughout each of the individual islands, in terms of employment... [and] this is much greater than other remote and rural areas in the United Kingdom\". Tourism accounts for approximately 63% of all employment.<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nBusinesses dependent on tourism, with the exception of a few hotels, tend to be small enterprises typically employing fewer than four people; many of these are family run, suggesting an entrepreneurial culture among the local population.<ref name=\"partnership\" /> However, much of the work generated by this, with the exception of management, is low skilled and thus poorly paid, especially for those involved in cleaning, catering and retail.<ref>J.Urry, ''The Tourist Gaze'' (2nd edition), London, 2002</ref>\n\nBecause of the seasonality of tourism, many jobs on the islands are seasonal and part-time, so work cannot be guaranteed throughout the year. Some islanders take up other temporary jobs 'out of season' to compensate for this. Due to a lack of local casual labour at peak holiday times, many of the larger employers accommodate guest workers, who come to the islands for the summer to have a \u2018[[volunteer travel|working holiday]]\u2019.\n\n===Taxation===\nThe islands were not subject to [[Income Tax|income tax]] until 1954, and there was no motor [[vehicle excise duty]] levied until 1971.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/travel-living-in-a-world-of-their-own-on-the-shortest-day-of-the-year-simon-calder-took-the-high-road-to-shetland-and-frank-barrett-took-the-low-road-to-the-scillies-as-britains-extremities-made-ready-for-christmas-1469283.html |title=Travel: Living in a world of their own: On the shortest day of the year, Simon Calder took the high road to Shetland and Frank Barrett took the low road to the Scillies, as Britain's extremities made ready for Christmas |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=24 December 1993 }}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Electric golf buggy on St Marys.jpg|thumb|An electric golf buggy on St Mary's; these are road licensed and available for hire, as are bicycles, for use on public roads on the island.]]\n[[File:RMV Scillonian III docked at St Mary's harbour.jpg|thumb|''[[Scillonian III]]'' in St Mary's Harbour]]\n\nSt Mary's is the only island with a significant road network and the only island with public highways; in 2005 there were 619 registered vehicles on the island.

[[Fixed-wing aircraft]] services, operated by [[Isles of Scilly Skybus]], operate from [[Land's End Airport|Land's End]], [[Newquay Cornwall Airport|Newquay]] and [[Exeter International Airport|Exeter]].<ref name=iossb>{{cite web |url=http://www.islesofscilly-travel.co.uk/timetable_skybus.asp |title=Skybus Timetables |publisher=Skybus |accessdate=8 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131116023855/http://www.islesofscilly-travel.co.uk/timetable_skybus.asp |archivedate=16 November 2013}}</ref>  There is currently no Sunday air transport.\n\nAt present all air and sea, passenger and freight transport between the Isles of Scilly and the mainland is owned by one company - The Isles of Scilly Steamship Company.  This is often blamed for high year-on-year fare increases.  There have been various local attempts to create competition, but as yet none have succeeded.\n\nThe scheduled [[helicopter]] service, which previously linked [[Penzance Heliport]] with St Mary's Airport and [[Tresco Heliport]], ceased at the end of October 2012. A new heliport is currently under construction in Penzance and helicopter services to Tresco and St Mary's are expected to commence in 2019 or 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://penzanceheliport.co.uk/|title=Isles of Scilly Helicopter from Penzance Heliport|website=Penzance Heliport|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-26}}</ref>\n\n===Tenure===\nThe [[freehold (law)|freehold land]] of the islands is the property of the Duchy of Cornwall (except for [[Hugh Town]] on St Mary's, which was sold to the inhabitants in 1949).

The full trust board is responsible for policy whilst a management team is responsible for day-to-day administration. Its small income and the small number of staff have led to the trust adopting a policy of recruiting volunteers to help it carry out its extensive work programme. While volunteers of all ages are welcome, most are young people who are studying for qualifications in related fields, such as conservation and land management.\n\nLimited housing availability is a contentious yet critical issue for the Isles of Scilly, especially as it affects the feasibility of residency on the islands. Few properties are privately owned, with many units being let by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], the council and a few by [[housing association]]s. The management of these subsequently affects the possibility of residency on the islands.<ref name=\"martin\">Martin D, 'Heaven and Hell', in ''Inside Housing'', 31 October 2004</ref> The [[Duchy Tenants Association]] was formed in 1996 by a number of tenants of the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nHousing demand outstrips supply, a problem compounded by restrictions on further development designed to protect the islands' unique environment and prevent the infrastructural carrying capacity from being exceeded. This has pushed up the prices of the few private properties that become available and, significantly for the majority of the islands' populations, it has also affected the rental sector where rates have likewise drastically increased.<ref name=\"SWHB\">''Sub Regional Housing Markets in the South West'', South West Housing Board, 2004</ref><ref name=\"fleming\">S. Fleming et al., ''\"In from the cold\" A report on Cornwall\u2019s Affordable Housing Crisis'', Liberal Democrats, Penzance, 2003</ref>\n\nHigh housing costs pose significant problems for the local population, especially as local incomes (in Cornwall) are only 70% of the national average, whilst house prices are almost \u00a35,000 higher than the national average. This in turn affects the retention of 'key workers' and the younger generation, which consequently affects the viability of schools and other essential community services.<ref name=\"council\" /><ref name=\"fleming\" />\n\nThe limited access to housing provokes strong local politics. It is often assumed that tourism is to blame for this, attracting newcomers to the area who can afford to outbid locals for available housing. Many buildings are used for tourist accommodation which reduces the number available for local residents. Second homes are also thought to account for a significant proportion of the housing stock, leaving many buildings empty for much of the year.<ref name=\"The Cornishman\">''The Cornishman'', \"Islanders in dispute with Duchy over housing policy\", 19 August 2004</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n===People===\n{{Main|Cornish people|English people}}\nAccording to the 2001 UK census, 97% of the population of the islands are [[white British]],<ref name=ONS1 /> with nearly 93% of the inhabitants born in the islands, in mainland Cornwall or elsewhere in England.<ref name=ONS2>{{cite web |title=Isles of Scilly \u2013 Country of Birth |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276909&c=TR21+0LW&d=13&e=13&g=431427&i=1x1003x1004&m=0&r=0&s=1354783435942&enc=1&dsFamilyId=11 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=6 December 2012 }}</ref> Since EU enlargement in 2004, a number of [[A8 countries|central Europeans]] have moved to the island, joining the Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans who traditionally made up most of the islands' overseas workers.

Gig racing has been said to derive from the race to collect [[marine salvage|salvage]] from shipwrecks on the rocks around Scilly, but the race was actually to deliver a [[harbour pilot|pilot]] onto incoming vessels, to guide them through the hazardous reefs and shallows. (The boats are correctly termed \"pilot gigs\"). The [[World Pilot Gig Championships]] are held annually over the May Day bank holiday weekend. The event originally involved crews from the Islands and a few crews from Cornwall, but in the intervening years the number of gigs attending has increased, with crews coming from all over the South-West and as far afield as the Netherlands and the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldgigs.co.uk/|title=World Pilot Gig Championships&nbsp;\u2013 Isles of Scilly |author1=Rick Persich |author2=Chairman World Pilot Gigs Championships Committee |accessdate=26 September 2010 }}</ref>\n\nThe Isles of Scilly feature what is reportedly the smallest [[association football|football]] league in the world, the [[Isles of Scilly Football League]].<ref>Smith, Rory (22 December 2016).

The island of [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] is the most southerly point in the United Kingdom, being over {{convert|4|mi}} further south than the most southerly point of the [[British mainland]] at [[Lizard Point, Cornwall|Lizard Point]].\n\nThe population of all the islands at the 2011 census was 2,203.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcensusdata.com/scilly-islands/e06000053 |title=UK Census Data 2011 |work=UK Census Data |accessdate=9 June 2015 }}</ref> Scilly forms part of the [[ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Cornwall, and some services are combined with those of Cornwall. However, since 1890, the islands have had a separate local authority. Since the passing of the Isles of Scilly Order 1930, this authority has had the status of a county council and today is known as the [[Council of the Isles of Scilly]].\n\nThe adjective \"Scillonian\" is sometimes used for people or things related to the archipelago. The [[Duchy of Cornwall]] owns most of the [[freehold (law)|freehold]] land on the islands. Tourism is a major part of the local economy, along with agriculture\u2014particularly the production of [[cut flowers]].\n\n==History==\n===Early history===\nThe islands may correspond to the [[Cassiterides]] ('Tin Isles') believed by some to have been visited by the [[Phoenicia]]ns and mentioned by the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]. However, the archipelago itself does not contain much [[tin]].\n\nThe isles were off the coast of the [[Celtic Britons|Brittonic Celtic]] kingdom of [[Dumnonia]] and later its offshoot, Kernow ([[Cornwall]]), and may have been a part of these polities until their conquest by the English in the 10th century AD.\n\nIt is likely that until relatively recent times the islands were much larger and perhaps joined together into one island named Ennor. Rising sea levels flooded the central plain around 400\u2013500 AD, forming the current 55 islands and islets, if an island is defined as \"land surrounded by water at high tide and supporting land vegetation\".<ref>'The Fortunate Islands' by R.L.

Born {{circa}} 960, Olaf had raided various European cities and fought in several wars. In 986 he met a Christian [[clairvoyance|seer]] on the Isles of Scilly. He was probably a follower of [[Priscillian]] and part of the tiny Christian community that was exiled here from Spain by [[Emperor Maximus]] for [[Priscillianism]]. In [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s Royal Sagas of Norway, it is stated that this seer told him:\n<blockquote>Thou wilt become a renowned king, and do celebrated deeds. Many men wilt thou bring to faith and baptism, and both to thy own and others' good; and that thou mayst have no doubt of the truth of this answer, listen to these tokens. When thou comest to thy ships many of thy people will conspire against thee, and then a battle will follow in which many of thy men will fall, and thou wilt be wounded almost to death, and carried upon a shield to thy ship; yet after seven days thou shalt be well of thy wounds, and immediately thou shalt let thyself be baptised.</blockquote>\n\nThe legend continues that, as the seer foretold, Olaf was attacked by a group of [[Mutiny|mutineers]] upon returning to his ships. As soon as he had recovered from his wounds, he let himself be baptised. He then stopped raiding Christian cities, and lived in England and Ireland. In 995, he used an opportunity to return to Norway. When he arrived, the [[Haakon Jarl]] was facing a revolt. Olaf Tryggvason persuaded the rebels to accept him as their king, and Jarl Haakon was murdered by his own slave, while he was hiding from the rebels in a pig sty.\n\nWith the [[Norman Conquest]], the Isles of Scilly came more under centralised control. About 20 years later, the [[Domesday Book|Domesday survey]] was conducted. The islands would have formed part of the \"[[Exeter]] Domesday\" circuit, which included Cornwall, [[Devon]], Dorset, [[Somerset]], and [[Wiltshire]].\n\nIn the mid-12th century, there was reportedly a Viking attack on the Isles of Scilly, called '''{{lang|non|Syllingar}}''' by the Norse,<ref name=\"OrkSaga\">Anderson, Joseph (Ed.) (1893) ''[[Orkneyinga saga]]''. Translated by J\u00f3n A. Hjaltalin & Gilbert Goudie. Edinburgh. James Thin and Mercat Press (1990 reprint). {{ISBN|0-901824-25-9}}</ref> recorded in the ''{{lang|non|[[Orkneyinga saga]]}}''\u2014 [[Sweyn Asleifsson]] \"went south, under Ireland, and seized a barge belonging to some monks in Syllingar and plundered it\".<ref name=OrkSaga /> (Chap LXXIII)\n\n<blockquote>...the three chiefs \u2013 Swein, \u00deorbj\u00f6rn and Eirik \u2013 went out on a plundering expedition.

Then they returned to the Orkneys.<ref name=OrkSaga /></blockquote>\n\n\"{{lang|non|Mar\u00eduh\u00f6fn}}\" literally means \"Mary's Harbour/Haven\". The name does not make it clear if it referred to a harbour on a larger island than today's St Mary's, or a whole island.\n\nIt is generally considered that Cornwall, and possibly the Isles of Scilly, came under the dominion of the English Crown late in the reign of [[\u00c6thelstan]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} 924\u2013939). In early times one group of islands was in the possession of a confederacy of hermits. [[Henry I of England|King Henry I]] (r. 1100\u201335) gave it to the [[Tavistock Abbey|abbey of Tavistock]] who established a priory on [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]], which was abolished at the [[English Reformation|Reformation]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cornish Church Guide |last=Henderson |first=Charles |location=Truro |publisher=Oscar Blackford |year=1925 |page=194 }}</ref>\n\n===Later Middle Ages and early modern period===\n[[File:Kernow Hundreds.png|thumb|Scilly was one of the [[Hundreds of Cornwall]] (formerly known as Cornish Shires) in the early 19th century.]]\n[[File:Scilly-bartholomew02 large.jpg|thumb|Scilly Isles: map by John Bartholomew (1874)]]\n\nAt the turn of the 14th century, the Abbot and convent of Tavistock Abbey petitioned the king,\n\n<blockquote>stat[ing] that they hold certain isles in the sea between Cornwall and Ireland, of which the largest is called Scilly, to which ships come passing between France, Normandy, Spain, [[Bayonne]], [[Gascony]], Scotland, Ireland, Wales and Cornwall: and, because they feel that in the event of a war breaking out between the kings of England and France, or between any of the other places mentioned, they would not have enough power to do justice to these sailors, they ask that they might exchange these islands for lands in Devon, saving the churches on the islands appropriated to them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7710638&queryType=1&resultcount=7 |title=Petitioners: Abbot and convent of Tavistock.

The names provide a wide variety of origins, e.g. Robert and Henry Sage (English), Richard de Tregenestre (Cornish), Ace de Veldre (French), Davy Gogch (possibly Welsh, or Cornish), and Adam le Fuiz Yaldicz (Spanish?).\n\nIt is not known at what point the islanders stopped speaking the [[Cornish language]], but the language seems to have gone into decline in Cornwall beginning in the [[Late Middle Ages]]; it was still dominant between the islands and Bodmin at the time of the Reformation, but it suffered an accelerated decline thereafter. The islands appear to have lost the old Celtic language before parts of [[Penwith]] on the mainland, in contrast to the history of [[Irish language|Irish]] or [[Scottish Gaelic]].\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]], the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]] captured the isles, only to see their garrison mutiny and return the isles to the [[Cavalier|Royalists]]. By 1651 the Royalist governor, [[John Granville, 1st Earl of Bath|Sir John Grenville]], was using the islands as a base for [[privateering]] raids on Commonwealth and Dutch shipping. The Dutch admiral [[Maarten Tromp]] sailed to the isles and on arriving on 30 May 1651 demanded compensation. In the absence of compensation or a satisfactory reply, he declared war on England in June, but declined to challenge Blake for the isles.<ref>Blakemore, Richard J. and Marphy, Elaine. (2018).

Blake's initial attack on [[Old Grimsby]] failed, but the next attacks succeeded in taking [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] and [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]]. Blake placed a battery on Tresco to fire on [[St. Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], but one of the guns exploded, killing its crew and injuring Blake. A second battery proved more successful. Subsequently, Grenville and Blake negotiated terms that permitted the Royalists to surrender honourably. The Parliamentary forces then set to fortifying the islands. They built [[Cromwell's Castle]]\u2014a gun platform on the west side of Tresco\u2014using materials scavenged from an earlier gun platform further up the hill. Although this poorly sited earlier platform dated back to the 1550s, it is now referred to as [[King Charles's Castle]]. In March 1646 the [[Charles II of England|Prince of Wales]] escaped from Falmouth to the isles before seeking a safer base in Jersey.<ref>Blakemore & Murphy.

The designation covers the entire archipelago, including the uninhabited islands and rocks, and is the smallest such area in the UK. The islands of Annet and Samson have large [[tern]]eries and the islands are well populated by [[pinniped|seals]]. The Isles of Scilly are the only British haunt of the [[lesser white-toothed shrew]] (''Crocidura suaveolens''), where it is known locally as a \"''teak''\" or \"''teke''\".<ref>{{cite news |author=Robinson, H.W. |year=1925 |title=A new British animal discovered in Scilly |newspaper=Scillonian |volume=4 |pages=123\u2013124}}</ref>\n\nThe islands are famous among [[birdwatching|birdwatchers]] for their ability to attract rare birds from all corners of the globe. The peak time of year for this is generally in October when it is not unusual for several of the rarest birds in Europe to share this archipelago. One reason for the success of these islands in producing rarities is the extensive coverage these islands get from birdwatchers, but archipelagos are often favoured by rare birds which like to make landfall and eat there before continuing their journeys and often arrive on far-flung islands first.\n[[File:Isles of Scilly NASA.jpg|thumb|The Isles of Scilly, viewed from the [[International Space Station]].]]\n\n===Tidal influx===\nThe tidal range at the Isles of Scilly is high for an open sea location; the maximum for St.&nbsp;Mary's is {{convert|5.99|m|abbr=on}}. Additionally, the inter-island waters are mostly shallow, which at [[spring tides]] allows for dry land walking between several of the islands. Many of the northern islands can be reached from Tresco, including Bryher, Samson and St.&nbsp;Martin's (requires very low tides). From St.&nbsp;Martin's White Island, Little Ganilly and Great Arthur are reachable. Although the sound between St.&nbsp;Mary's and Tresco, The Road, is fairly shallow, it never becomes totally dry, but according to some sources it should be possible to wade at extreme low tides. Around St.&nbsp;Mary's several minor islands become accessible, including Taylor's Island on the west coast and Tolls Island on the east coast. From St.&nbsp;Agnes, Gugh becomes accessible at each low tide, via a [[tombolo]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe Isles of Scilly features an [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] : ''Cfb'') bordering on a rare 49\u00b0N [[humid subtropical climate]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/featurednews/title_528495_en.html |title=Isles of Scilly climate |department=news |website=exeter.ac.uk}}</ref> The average annual temperature is {{convert|11.8|\u00b0C|1|abbr=on}}, by far the warmest place in the British Isles.

The maximum snowfall was {{convert|23|cm|0|abbr=on}} on 12 January 1987.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/n/MetLIB_13_013_FactSheet_7_Final.pdf |publisher=Met Office |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524004028/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/c/n/MetLIB_13_013_FactSheet_7_Final.pdf |archive-date=24 May 2014  |title=Fact Sheet \u2013 South West England |page=17}}</ref> Summers are not as warm as on the mainland.

Suitably qualified students after age eighteen attend universities and colleges on the mainland.\n\n==Economy==\n===Historical context===\nSince the mid-18th century the Scillonian economy has relied on trade with the mainland and beyond as a means of sustaining its population. Over the years the nature of this trade has varied, due to wider economic and political factors that have seen the rise and fall of industries such as [[kelp]] harvesting, [[harbour pilot|pilotage]], smuggling, fishing, [[shipbuilding]] and, latterly, [[floriculture|flower farming]]. In a 1987 study of the Scillonian economy, Neate found that many farms on the islands were struggling to remain profitable due to increasing costs and strong competition from overseas producers, with resulting diversification into tourism. Recent statistics suggest that agriculture on the islands now represents less than 2% of all employment.<ref>Gibson, F, ''My Scillionian Home... its past, its present, its future'', St Ives, 1980</ref><ref name=\"partnership\">''Isles of Scilly Integrated Area Plan 2001\u20132004'', Isles of Scilly Partnership 2001</ref><ref>Neate, S, ''The role of tourism in sustaining farm structures and communities on the Isles of Scilly'' in M Bouquet and M Winter (eds) ''Who From Their Labours Rest?  Conflict and practice in rural tourism'' Aldershot, 1987</ref>\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:St Martins Daymark.jpg|thumb|The [[Daymark]] (daylight version of a [[lighthouse]]) on St Martins, the nearest point to the mainland of [[Cornwall]].]]\n\nToday, tourism is estimated to account for 85 percent of the islands' income. The islands have been successful in attracting this investment due to their special environment, favourable summer climate, relaxed culture, efficient co-ordination of tourism providers and good transport links by sea and air to the mainland, uncommon in scale to similar-sized island communities.<ref name=\"council\">''Isles of Scilly Local Plan: A 2020 Vision'', Council of the Isles of Scilly, 2004</ref><ref name=\"touristboard\">''Isles of Scilly 2004, imagine...'', Isles of Scilly Tourist Board, 2004</ref> The majority of visitors stay on [[St Mary's, Isles of Scilly|St Mary's]], which has a concentration of holiday accommodation and other amenities. Of the other inhabited islands, [[Tresco, Isles of Scilly|Tresco]] is run as a timeshare resort, and is consequently the most obviously tourist-oriented. [[Bryher, Isles of Scilly|Bryher]] and [[St Martin's, Isles of Scilly|St Martin's]] are more unspoilt, although each has a hotel and other accommodation. [[St Agnes, Isles of Scilly|St Agnes]] has no hotel and is the least-developed of the inhabited islands.\n\nThe islands' economy is highly dependent on tourism, even by the standards of other island communities. \"The concentration [on] a small number of sectors is typical of most similarly sized UK island communities. However, it is the degree of concentration, which is distinctive along with the overall importance of tourism within the economy as a whole and the very limited manufacturing base that stands out\".<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nTourism is also a highly seasonal industry owing to its reliance on outdoor recreation, and the lower number of tourists in winter results in a significant constriction of the islands' commercial activities. However, the tourist season benefits from an extended period of business in October when many [[birding|birdwatchers]] (\"birders\") arrive.\n\n====Ornithology====\nBecause of its position, Scilly is the first landing for many migrant birds, including extreme rarities from North America and [[Siberia]]. Scilly is situated far into the Atlantic Ocean, so many American vagrant birds will make first European landfall in the archipelago.\n\nScilly is responsible for many firsts for Britain, and is particularly good at producing vagrant American [[passerine]]s. If an extremely rare bird turns up, the island will see a significant increase in numbers of birders. This type of birding, chasing after rare birds, is called \"[[Birdwatching#Birding, birdwatching and twitching|twitching]]\".\n\nThe islands are home to [[ornithologist]] [[Will Wagstaff]].\n\n===Employment===\nThe predominance of tourism means that \"tourism is by far the main sector throughout each of the individual islands, in terms of employment... [and] this is much greater than other remote and rural areas in the United Kingdom\". Tourism accounts for approximately 63% of all employment.<ref name=\"partnership\" />\n\nBusinesses dependent on tourism, with the exception of a few hotels, tend to be small enterprises typically employing fewer than four people; many of these are family run, suggesting an entrepreneurial culture among the local population.<ref name=\"partnership\" /> However, much of the work generated by this, with the exception of management, is low skilled and thus poorly paid, especially for those involved in cleaning, catering and retail.<ref>J.Urry, ''The Tourist Gaze'' (2nd edition), London, 2002</ref>\n\nBecause of the seasonality of tourism, many jobs on the islands are seasonal and part-time, so work cannot be guaranteed throughout the year. Some islanders take up other temporary jobs 'out of season' to compensate for this. Due to a lack of local casual labour at peak holiday times, many of the larger employers accommodate guest workers, who come to the islands for the summer to have a \u2018[[volunteer travel|working holiday]]\u2019.\n\n===Taxation===\nThe islands were not subject to [[Income Tax|income tax]] until 1954, and there was no motor [[vehicle excise duty]] levied until 1971.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/travel-living-in-a-world-of-their-own-on-the-shortest-day-of-the-year-simon-calder-took-the-high-road-to-shetland-and-frank-barrett-took-the-low-road-to-the-scillies-as-britains-extremities-made-ready-for-christmas-1469283.html |title=Travel: Living in a world of their own: On the shortest day of the year, Simon Calder took the high road to Shetland and Frank Barrett took the low road to the Scillies, as Britain's extremities made ready for Christmas |work=[[The Independent]] |location=London |date=24 December 1993 }}</ref>\n\n===Transport===\n[[File:Electric golf buggy on St Marys.jpg|thumb|An electric golf buggy on St Mary's; these are road licensed and available for hire, as are bicycles, for use on public roads on the island.]]\n[[File:RMV Scillonian III docked at St Mary's harbour.jpg|thumb|''[[Scillonian III]]'' in St Mary's Harbour]]\n\nSt Mary's is the only island with a significant road network and the only island with public highways; in 2005 there were 619 registered vehicles on the island.

The full trust board is responsible for policy whilst a management team is responsible for day-to-day administration. Its small income and the small number of staff have led to the trust adopting a policy of recruiting volunteers to help it carry out its extensive work programme. While volunteers of all ages are welcome, most are young people who are studying for qualifications in related fields, such as conservation and land management.\n\nLimited housing availability is a contentious yet critical issue for the Isles of Scilly, especially as it affects the feasibility of residency on the islands. Few properties are privately owned, with many units being let by the [[Duchy of Cornwall]], the council and a few by [[housing association]]s. The management of these subsequently affects the possibility of residency on the islands.<ref name=\"martin\">Martin D, 'Heaven and Hell', in ''Inside Housing'', 31 October 2004</ref> The [[Duchy Tenants Association]] was formed in 1996 by a number of tenants of the Duchy of Cornwall.\n\nHousing demand outstrips supply, a problem compounded by restrictions on further development designed to protect the islands' unique environment and prevent the infrastructural carrying capacity from being exceeded. This has pushed up the prices of the few private properties that become available and, significantly for the majority of the islands' populations, it has also affected the rental sector where rates have likewise drastically increased.<ref name=\"SWHB\">''Sub Regional Housing Markets in the South West'', South West Housing Board, 2004</ref><ref name=\"fleming\">S. Fleming et al., ''\"In from the cold\" A report on Cornwall\u2019s Affordable Housing Crisis'', Liberal Democrats, Penzance, 2003</ref>\n\nHigh housing costs pose significant problems for the local population, especially as local incomes (in Cornwall) are only 70% of the national average, whilst house prices are almost \u00a35,000 higher than the national average. This in turn affects the retention of 'key workers' and the younger generation, which consequently affects the viability of schools and other essential community services.<ref name=\"council\" /><ref name=\"fleming\" />\n\nThe limited access to housing provokes strong local politics. It is often assumed that tourism is to blame for this, attracting newcomers to the area who can afford to outbid locals for available housing. Many buildings are used for tourist accommodation which reduces the number available for local residents. Second homes are also thought to account for a significant proportion of the housing stock, leaving many buildings empty for much of the year.<ref name=\"The Cornishman\">''The Cornishman'', \"Islanders in dispute with Duchy over housing policy\", 19 August 2004</ref>\n\n==Culture==\n===People===\n{{Main|Cornish people|English people}}\nAccording to the 2001 UK census, 97% of the population of the islands are [[white British]],<ref name=ONS1 /> with nearly 93% of the inhabitants born in the islands, in mainland Cornwall or elsewhere in England.<ref name=ONS2>{{cite web |title=Isles of Scilly \u2013 Country of Birth |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadTableView.do?a=7&b=276909&c=TR21+0LW&d=13&e=13&g=431427&i=1x1003x1004&m=0&r=0&s=1354783435942&enc=1&dsFamilyId=11 |publisher=Office for National Statistics |accessdate=6 December 2012 }}</ref> Since EU enlargement in 2004, a number of [[A8 countries|central Europeans]] have moved to the island, joining the Australians, New Zealanders and South Africans who traditionally made up most of the islands' overseas workers.

Steinbrenner Field]] in Tampa. Former original Rowdie [[Ricky Hill]] was named the club's manager in January 2011.\n\nAfter winning only 2 of their first 10 matches, the club rebounded to finish 3rd in the league table and qualified for the NASL playoffs. They were upset by eventual league champion [[NSC Minnesota Stars]] in the quarterfinals by a score of 1\u20130. Tampa Bay won their second straight [[Coastal Cup]], by taking three out of four matches against their [[Florida Derby (soccer)|Florida Derby]] rivals, [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (2006\u20132016)|Fort Lauderdale]]. Another highlight was a 1\u20130 mid-season friendly win over the [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] of the [[English Premier League]] at Al Lang Stadium. The Rowdies (along with the rest of the NASL) did not participate in the [[2011 U.S. Open Cup]] due to late provisional sanctioning by the [[United States Soccer Federation|USSF]].\n\n== Results

Steinbrenner Field]] in Tampa. Former original Rowdie [[Ricky Hill]] was named the club's manager in January 2011.\n\nAfter winning only 2 of their first 10 matches, the club rebounded to finish 3rd in the league table and qualified for the NASL playoffs. They were upset by eventual league champion [[NSC Minnesota Stars]] in the quarterfinals by a score of 1\u20130. Tampa Bay won their second straight [[Coastal Cup]], by taking three out of four matches against their [[Florida Derby (soccer)|Florida Derby]] rivals, [[Fort Lauderdale Strikers (2006\u20132016)|Fort Lauderdale]]. Another highlight was a 1\u20130 mid-season friendly win over the [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] of the [[English Premier League]] at Al Lang Stadium. The Rowdies (along with the rest of the NASL) did not participate in the [[2011 U.S. Open Cup]] due to late provisional sanctioning by the [[United States Soccer Federation|USSF]].\n\n== Results

Hoar names Jeremiah William Patrick O'Brien (1844\u20131950) as the last Confederate participant of the battle. Though O'Brien claimed four years of service, more recent research included in Damian Shiel's book ''Irish in the American Civil War'' (2013) puts his known enlistment date as 15 May 1864, almost a full year after the battle. For this reason, the penultimate veteran mentioned by Dr. Hoar is included in this article.</ref>\n|1844\u20131948\n|<ref name=Hoar2/>{{rp|1559}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://virginiachronicle.com/cgi-bin/virginia?a=d&d=TSMT19481013.1.1&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN--------|title=J.

Hoar names Jeremiah William Patrick O'Brien (1844\u20131950) as the last Confederate participant of the battle. Though O'Brien claimed four years of service, more recent research included in Damian Shiel's book ''Irish in the American Civil War'' (2013) puts his known enlistment date as 15 May 1864, almost a full year after the battle. For this reason, the penultimate veteran mentioned by Dr. Hoar is included in this article.</ref>\n|1844\u20131948\n|<ref name=Hoar2/>{{rp|1559}}<ref>{{cite news|url=https://virginiachronicle.com/cgi-bin/virginia?a=d&d=TSMT19481013.1.1&e=-------en-20--1--txt-txIN--------|title=J.

In 1964, his family fled the [[Zanzibar Revolution]], moving to [[Middlesex]], England. Having studied and written music for years, he formed Queen in 1970 with guitarist [[Brian May]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]]. Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", \"[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]\", \"[[We Are the Champions]]\", \"[[Don't Stop Me Now]]\", and \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\". His charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the audience, as displayed at the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert. He also led a solo career and served as a producer and guest musician for other artists. Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to complications from [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]. He confirmed the day before his death that he had contracted the disease, having been diagnosed in 1987. In 1992, [[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|his tribute concert]] was held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]].\n\nAs a member of Queen, Mercury was posthumously inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2001, the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 2003, and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2004. In 1990, he and the other Queen members were awarded the [[Brit Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to British Music, and one year after his death Mercury was awarded it individually.<!-- This is what text says in article below --> In 2005, Queen were awarded an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Song Collection from the [[British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors]].

Mercury wrote numerous hits for Queen, including \"[[Killer Queen]]\", \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\", \"[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]\", \"[[We Are the Champions]]\", \"[[Don't Stop Me Now]]\", and \"[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]\". His charismatic stage performances often saw him interact with the audience, as displayed at the 1985 [[Live Aid]] concert. He also led a solo career and served as a producer and guest musician for other artists. Mercury died in 1991 at age 45 due to complications from [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]].

According to early deeds for property on both sides of the Still River, \"Sachem Pokono\" the son of Sachem Waramaug who met the first settlers to Brookfield in 1710  (or \"Pocono\") led the local Indians for many years. Indian relics are still found in Brookfield.<ref name=hist1>[http://www.brookfieldcthistory.org/page_Brookfield.html#Newbury] \"Newbury to Brookfield\" Web page at ''Brookfield Historical Society'' Web site, accessed April 6, 2007</ref>\n\nAt one time, the \"Indian Tree\", a wild cherry tree on Route 133 was said to be the spot where local Indians would meet. Area names that come from the local Indians include [[Lake Waramaug]] (for a chief or \" Sachem\" in Algonquin ). Lillinonah was the name of his daughter.  Pocono Road was named for Chief Pocono.<ref name=hist3>[http://www.brookfieldcthistory.org/page_Brookfield.html#Childrens]\"A Children's Guide to Brookfield History\", Web page at ''Brookfield Historical Society'' Web site, accessed April 6, 2007</ref>\n\nIn the 18th century the community was called \"Newbury,\" a name that came from the three towns from which its land was taken \u2013 '''New''' Milford, '''New'''town, and Dan'''bury'''.<ref name=history>[http://www.brookfield.org/TownHistory.htm] \"Brookfield, Connecticut History\" Web page on the Town of Brookfield Web site, accessed July 23, 2006</ref>\n\nBecause it was difficult for community residents to get to one of the distant churches in those towns in winter, in 1752 the General Assembly gave the community the right to have worship in area homes from September through March. In 1754, the General Assembly granted permission for the Parish of Newbury to build its own meeting house and get its own minister. On September 28, 1757, the first Congregational Church building was dedicated. The Reverend Thomas Brooks was ordained as the first settled minister. In 1787, when the town was incorporated, it changed its name to Brookfield in honor of Brooks, who was still the minister.<ref name=history/>\n\nAlong the [[Still River (Housatonic River)|Still River]] mills were in operation as early as 1732 in an area that became known as the Iron Works District. Brookfield was a thriving town with iron furnaces, grist mills, sawmills, comb shops, carding and cotton mills, a paper mill, a knife factory, hat factories, stage-coach shops, lime kilns, harness shops and other plants operated there. The grist mill (now the [[Brookfield Craft Center]]) still stands.

One section has recipes (mostly desserts).\n\nBefore 1912 the town had two train stations: one in the Iron Works District, near the present Brookfield Market and, second, Junction Station, near the corner of Junction Road and Stony Hill Road. Young people used the train to attend high school in Danbury.<ref name=history/>\n\nThe first Town Hall (first called the \"Town House\" was built in 1794 across from the meetinghouse (Congregational Church).

Her will, dated April 13, 1793, stated: \"I give and bequeath unto the Town of Brookfield all my monies, Notes, or Bonds or Book Debts or Lands or Chattels or any interest that shall be found belonging to me after my decease, for use of a school, to be kept in the center of town [...] the interest of the money to be paid yearly for the support of the school after a reasonable time to settle the estate in.\" She apparently could not read herself and signed the will with an \"X\", her mark.<ref name=hist1/>\n\nThe town received 138 pounds, 11 shillings and nine pence from the estate in 1794.<ref name=hist1/> Northrop was called \"Molly\", and the fund became known by 1804 as the \"Molly Fund\", a name that has stuck to this day. Since Northrop's will stated the money should be used in the center of town, the fund was used to pay the singing master in the town's Sing School, which was located there.<ref name=hist1/>\n\nThe Long Meadow Hill School was built in 1959 and later became Brookfield High School, which graduated its first class in 1967.<ref name=hist1/>\n\n==Books about the history of Brookfield==\n* Whittlesey, Marilyn, ''Images of America, Brookfield'' a collection of images of Brookfield, 128 pages, Arcadia Publishing (1999), {{ISBN|0-7385-0116-6}} {{ISBN|978-0738501161}}\n* Whittlesey, Marilyn, ''A look back: Brookfield, Connecticut'' Published by the Heritage Committee of the Brookfield, Connecticut Bicentennial Taskforce (1988) ASIN B00072DZLW\n* Hawley, Emily Carrie, ''Annals of Brookfield, Fairfield County, Connecticut'', 656 pages, Published by E.C.

The pair can activate their superpowers by touching hands and saying the phrase \"Wonder Twin powers, activate!\" Jayna can transform her shape into any animal, and Zan can become water in any state. The pair also have a pet monkey, [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]], who assists in their crime-fighting activities.\n\nThey subsequently appeared in comics based on the animated series, and were later introduced into the main [[DC Comics Universe]]. They have since appeared in other media, including the animated series ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' and the live-action TV series ''[[Smallville]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe duo made their debut in ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'' and went on to appear in ''[[The World's Greatest Super Friends]]'', ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'', and ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]''. Zan (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]) and Jayna (voiced by Louise Williams from 1977-1983, and [[B. J. Ward (actress)|B. J.

Unlike their predecessors, [[Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog|Wendy Harris and Marvin White]], this pair was able to participate in combat with abilities of their own.\n\nHanna-Barbera animator [[Darrell McNeil]] recalls the twins were created by [[Norman Maurer]], the ''[[Super Friends]]'' series developer/story editor. They were originally called Dick and Jane, and their sidekick was Mighty Monkey, before finally becoming Zan, Jayna, and Gleek. The names \"Zan\" and \"Jayna\" derived from the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] characters [[Tarzan]] and his romantic interest [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]]. According to McNeil, \"Originally Zan (Dick) had '[[Plastic Man]]' powers and Jayna (Jane) could transform into anything, not just animals, but they were scaled back to their present powers as it made the other Super Friends (even [[Superman]]) seem almost superfluous.\"<ref name=\"blogspot1\">{{cite web|author=Marc Tyler Nobleman |url=http://noblemania.blogspot.com/2011/07/super-70s-and-80s-super-friendsdarrell.html |title=Noblemania: Super \u201870s and \u201880s: \"Super Friends\"\u2014Darrell McNeil, animator |publisher=Noblemania.blogspot.com |date=2011-07-29 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref> Jayna's distinctive [[hairdo]] was based on that of an animation checker at Hanna-Barbera, while the pointed ears were inspired by the character [[Spock]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise.

Velez, an avowed die-hard fan of the Wonder Twins, intended to begin a revival of the characters, but was taken off the series after the first issue with the Wonder Twins.

They are adopted by the owner of a Space [[Circus]] who only wants to use them as [[sideshow]] freaks. However, the circus' clown (or \"laugh-maker\") is a kind man and raises them. He also gives them Gleek as a pet. Eventually, as teens, the pair escape the circus and hide on a planet where a space villain called Grax (an enemy of [[Superman]]) has established his headquarters. Spying on him, they learn that Grax is planning to destroy the Earth using hidden superbombs. The twins decide to travel to Earth and warn the [[Justice League]], which is how they come to replace Wendy and Marvin (who were planning on retiring as heroes anyway) as their sidekicks. The heroes arrange for the kids to live with an old scientist named [[Professor Carter Nichols]] and they even take secret identities as Johan and Joanna Fleming. \"Johan\" and \"Johanna\" were supposedly transfer students from Esko, [[Sweden]], disguised with blonde hair (Zan wore a wig, while Jayna uses her powers to transform into a human to change her hair color and ear shape), to allow them to attend [[Gotham City]] High School.\n\n===In comics===\n[[Image:WonderTwins New.JPG|150px|thumb|The new, revamped Wonder Twins.

The Wonder Comics imprint is considered part of the current DCU, so this places the Wonder Twins in current DC continuity. \n\nIn September of 2019, the Wonder Twins have a cameo appearance in Action Comics #1015, which also guest stars new Wonder Comics hero Naomi. \n\nWonder Comics is also having their own first crossover event, taking place in Young Justice issue #12, which will feature Naomi and the Wonder Twins as guest stars in Young Justice.  \n\nThe Wonder Twins are also on the cover of \"Superman: Heroes\" #1.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}\nThe Wonder Twins powers are activated when they touch each other and speak the phrase, \"Wonder Twin powers, activate!\" Physical contact is required. If the two are out of reach of each other, they are unable to activate their powers. As they are about to transform, they would each announce their intended form. \"Shape of...\", \"Form of...\"\n\nZan can transform into water at any state (solid, liquid, gas) and add to his mass by incorporating water in his immediate area. In the case of becoming solid ice, he can also become any form he chooses, from a {{convert|5000|ft|m|adj=on}} humanoid ice giant to a cage for a criminal to complex machinery (such as a jet engine, as he did in the episode \"Eruption\"). In the episode \"Pressure Point,\" he changes into a gelatinous form. In the episode \"Terror from the Phantom Zone,\" he was able to transform into [[liquid nitrogen]]. In addition, he can transform himself into atmospheric disturbances (usually very localized) involving water, such as a [[blizzard]], a [[monsoon]], [[waterspout]] or a [[typhoon]], as he did in the episodes \"The Water Beast\", \"The Beasts are Coming\", and \"Stowaways.\"\n\nJayna can transform into any animal, whether real, mythological, indigenous to Earth, or indigenous to some other planet like Exxor. Since she must vocalize her choice of form to assume, she must know the common name. As revealed in \"The Mummy of Nazca,\" naming the wrong animal will cause her to assume the wrong animal's form. She has been known to take the form of anything from a mosquito to a whale, as in \"The Water Beast\" episode.\n\nIn the ''Super Friends'' comic book, their powers were shown to be more extensive. By transforming into an animal of [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] origin, for instance, Jayna could gain both the creature's natural abilities and the super-powers that all Kryptonians possess under Earth-like conditions; she was even capable of overpowering [[Superman]] in the form of a Kryptonian animal.<ref>''Super Friends'' #42 (March 1981)--Jayna defeats Superman in a training exercise by becoming a Kryptonian ''Tanthou Flez'' (\"Winged One\")</ref>  Similarly, Zan was able to transform into anything tangentially related to water or ice, including a [[J\u00f6tunn|frost giant]] in the \"Demons of Exxor\" episode.\n\nIn addition to their powers of transformation, the two share a telepathic link, enabling one to alert the other over a distance when in dire circumstances, as revealed in the episode \"The Village of Lost Souls.\"\n\nThe Wonder Twins have a pet Space Monkey named [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]], who has a useful prehensile tail and who could act as a conduit for the twins to activate their powers should they be out of reach. Gleek also served as a courier when the twins needed to travel: Jayna would typically transform into a large [[eagle]], and Zan would transform into [[water]], \"jumping\" into a bucket which Gleek would be holding while clutched by Jayna in her eagle form.\n\nA rarely seen aspect of their powers is the ability to break mind control. On at least two occasions (\"Pied Piper From Space\" and \"Circus of Horrors\"), while the twins were under the influence of mind control, [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]] caused them to make contact and the activation of their powers freed them instantly from the mind control.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* In the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode \"Injustice For All\", statues of the Twins are briefly seen in a museum devoted to super-powered heroes.  Later in the same scene, the two statues are destroyed during the battle between the heroes and villains.\n\n* In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', two characters called '''Downpour''' and '''Shifter''' appear in the episode \"Ultimatum\" where they were both voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]. They are members of the Ultimen, a group of superheroes created by the [[United States government|government]] and [[Project Cadmus]] with [[Maxwell Lord]] as their sponsor. The group is a [[pastiche]] of the heroes that were created for ''Super Friends'', with Downpour and Shifter specifically a pastiche of the Wonder Twins. Downpour and his twin sister Shifter have [[albino]] white skin, pink eyes and pointy ears. Downpour would say the name of a liquid in order to turn into that liquid (like [[flood]], [[water]], and [[Tidal bore|tidal wave]]) while Shifter would say the name of a creature (like a [[sea serpent]], a [[lion]], a [[rhinoceros]], a [[African buffalo|cape buffalo]], and a [[Tyrannosaurus]]) in order to become that creature. Later on in the episode, Downpour and Shifter were with the Ultimen when they learned on their own that the Ultimen were clones created by Project Cadmus. After Wind Dragon had used his wind attacks to bring Maxwell Lord to the roof that they were on, Downpour became water that entrapped Maxwell Lord while Shifter became a lion asking which is worse: drowning in water or being eaten by a lion. Maxwell Lord convinced them to let him explain over the fact that Project Cadmus had created them in order to be better heroes with the clones having implanted images and interact with actors that portrayed their parents. When it came to attacking the building they lived in while hunting for Maxwell Lord's boss Amanda Waller, Downpour and Shifter fought Aquaman and were defeated. Clones of the characters later appear in the episode \"Panic in the Sky\" where they join the other Ultimatum clones into attacking the Watchtower. Some clones of Downpour formed a water trap around [[Fire (comics)|Fire]] until she managed to heat herself to the point of breaking free.\n\n* Zan appeared in season 1, episode 2 of the [[Adult Swim]] series ''[[Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law]]''. In the episode, Zan (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]) is on the stand being questioned by Harvey Birdman.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://video.adultswim.com/harvey-birdman-attorney-at-law/i-was-the-bathwater.html |title=I Was the Bathwater - Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law - Adult Swim Video |publisher=Video.adultswim.com |date=2007-06-22 |accessdate=2013-09-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231012337/http://video.adultswim.com/harvey-birdman-attorney-at-law/i-was-the-bathwater.html |archivedate=2012-12-31 }}</ref> In 2007, the Adult Swim website ran a series of five [[webisode]]s entitled \"The New Adventures of the Wonder Twins.\" These shorts were not canon, but rather a [[Black comedy|dark-humor]] [[parody]]. Zan and Jayna were portrayed as well-meaning but inept, with their attempts at heroism always ending in tragic failure.\n\n* In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"A Fish Out of Water\", Peter Griffin and his dog Brian put their rings together and simultaneously say \"Wonder Twin powers, activate\", after which Peter states what he wants to be changed into. Brian says to Peter, \"Peter, we got these rings out of a box of \"Franken Berry\". In another episode, \"Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High\", Peter reveals that he was once one of the Wonder Twins. In his flashback, it is revealed that after activating their powers, Peter turned himself into Jayna's tampon.\n\n[[Image:SmallvilleWonderTwins.jpg|200px|thumb|[[David Gallagher]] as Zan and [[Allison Scagliotti]] as Jayna in the Smallville episode \"Idol\".]]\n* Zan and Jayna appeared in the ''[[Smallville]]'' season nine episode, \"Idol\", which aired on November 13, 2009. Zan was played by [[David Gallagher]] and Jayna by [[Allison Scagliotti]]. They both carry cell phones that have an image of Gleek on the back and that make the sound of Gleek laughing as a [[ringtone]]. Though not explicitly labeled as aliens, the two are implied to be from another world{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and claim to be of [[Swedish people|Swedish]] descent in order to explain their odd-sounding names. The Twins are portrayed as being obsessed with \"The Blur\" (the name given to Clark Kent before he officially adopts the [[Superman]] identity), and attempt to impersonate him in order to build up his positive reputation. They send a crate to young reporter [[Lois Lane]] containing several bound and gagged drug dealers who turn out to be undercover cops that Zan and Jayna abducted by mistake, thus ruining a calculated police drug sting. When an attempt at stopping a robbery accidentally causes a citywide blackout in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], the Twins are ambushed and abducted by Clark and his partner [[Chloe Sullivan]]. After being threatened into giving up their vigilante activities, Zan and Jayna prove their worth when Lois is thrown from the rooftop of the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' building by a crooked politician who wants to expose \"The Blur's\" true identity. Jayna transforms into an attack dog and captures the politician as he attempts to flee the scene, while Zan transforms his body into a massive cloud of mist, providing the cover Clark needs to lower Lois safely to the ground unobserved. After this, the Twins are encouraged by Clark to continue their super heroics outside of Metropolis, albeit on their own reputations rather than attempting to emulate him.\n\n* In the ''[[Flash (2014 TV series)|Flash]]'' episode \"Crazy for You\", Barry Allen rescues a man and woman by the names of Jayna and Zay from a burning car. Unlike in the comics, it appears these versions are a couple rather than twins.\n\n* The Wonder Twins appear in the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' episode \"You're Fired\"{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} with Zan voiced by [[Khary Payton]] and Jayna voiced by [[Tara Strong]]. They appear amongst the heroes at the audition for the replacement of [[Beast Boy]]. Although Robin was impressed with Jayna, Zan was hired as a [[receptionist]] with Jayna stating that she needs Zan to activate her powers. Beast Boy works with Zan to sabotage Jayna's attempts. After Zan comes clean, he turns into water and escapes into the toilet. In the form of a pelican, Beast Boy catches Zan before he can land in the ocean. Zan and Jayna later leave with Zan in the form of an ice unicycle and Jayna in the form of an octopus.\n\n===Film===\n* The Wonder Twins appear in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]''. They are seen at the 57th Annual Justice League Anniversary Party.\n\n* The Wonder Twins make a brief appearance in ''[[Teen Titans Go! To the Movies]].''\n\n===Video games===\nThe ''Teen Titans Go!'' incarnations of the Wonder Twins appear in ''[[Lego Dimensions]]''. They appear in a sidequest where Jayna requests the player to find a bucket to catch Zan with in case he tries to escape again like he did in the \"You're Fired\" episode. The ''Lego Batman Movie'' incarnations also cameo in the ''Lego Batman Movie'' story pack.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=2110|title=Zan}}\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=2111|title=Jayna}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100202153527/http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/profiles/zan+jayna.htm Cosmic Teams: Zan and Jayna]\n* [http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=wondertwins DCU Guide: Wonder Twins]\n* [http://www.seanbaby.com/superfriends/wondertwins.htm Seanbaby's Wonder Twins page]\n* [http://www.kryptonsite.com/smallvillespoilers.htm Kryptonsite: Smallville Spoilers]\n* {{tv.com show|wonder-twins|The New Adventures of the Wonder Twins|type=web}}\n\n{{Superfriends series}}\n\n[[Category:2019 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:Animated duos]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1977]]\n[[Category:DC Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:DC Comics female superheroes]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial superheroes]]\n[[Category:Female characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with ice or cold abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with water abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional clones]]\n[[Category:Fictional extraterrestrial characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional duos]]\n[[Category:Fictional shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Fictional twins]]\n[[Category:Hanna-Barbera characters]]\n[[Category:Super Friends characters]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Superheroes who are adopted]]\n[[Category:Television duos]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|DC Comics characters}}\n{{About|DC Comics|other uses|Wondertwins (disambiguation){{!}}Wondertwins}}\n{{Infobox comics character <!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image              = Wonder_Twins.jpg\n|imagesize          = <!-- numeral only, defaults to 250 -->\n|converted          = y\n|caption            = The Wonder Twins, from ''[[Super Friends]]''.\n|character_name     = Wonder Twins\n|real_name          = Zan and Jayna\n| first_series   = [[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]\n| first_episode  = Joy Ride\n|first_comic = '' Super Friends #7 DC comics October, 1977\n|creators            = [[Norman Maurer]]<br>[[William Hanna]]<br>[[Joseph Barbera]]\n|Base of operations = <!-- optional -->\n|species            = Exxorian\n|homeworld          = Exxor\n|alliances          = [[Super Friends]]<br>[[Justice League]]<br>Ten Elements of the Universe\n|partners           = <!-- optional -->\n|supports           = <!-- optional -->\n|aliases            =  <!-- optional: actual identities the character uses, not nicknames -->\n|powers             = Zan can transform into any form of water<br>Jayna can transform into any animal.\n|cat                = super\n|subcat             = DC Comics\n|hero               = y\n|villain            =\n|sortkey            = Wonder Twins\n}}\nThe '''Wonder Twins''' ('''Zan''' and '''Jayna''') are a fictional [[extraterrestrials in fiction|extraterrestrial]] twin brother and sister [[superhero]] duo who first appeared in [[Hanna-Barbera]]'s American [[animated cartoon|animated]] television series ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]''. The pair can activate their superpowers by touching hands and saying the phrase \"Wonder Twin powers, activate!\" Jayna can transform her shape into any animal, and Zan can become water in any state. The pair also have a pet monkey, [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]], who assists in their crime-fighting activities.\n\nThey subsequently appeared in comics based on the animated series, and were later introduced into the main [[DC Comics Universe]]. They have since appeared in other media, including the animated series ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' and the live-action TV series ''[[Smallville]]''.\n\n==Publication history==\nThe duo made their debut in ''[[The All-New Super Friends Hour]]'' and went on to appear in ''[[The World's Greatest Super Friends]]'', ''[[Super Friends (1980)|Super Friends]]'', and ''[[Super Friends: The Legendary Super Powers Show]]''. Zan (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]) and Jayna (voiced by Louise Williams from 1977-1983, and [[B. J. Ward (actress)|B. J. Ward]] in 1984<ref>http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/voice-compare/DC-Universe/Jayna</ref>) are siblings from the planet Exxor (also spelled Exor) who were being informally trained by the superheroes. Unlike their predecessors, [[Wendy, Marvin and Wonder Dog|Wendy Harris and Marvin White]], this pair was able to participate in combat with abilities of their own.\n\nHanna-Barbera animator [[Darrell McNeil]] recalls the twins were created by [[Norman Maurer]], the ''[[Super Friends]]'' series developer/story editor. They were originally called Dick and Jane, and their sidekick was Mighty Monkey, before finally becoming Zan, Jayna, and Gleek. The names \"Zan\" and \"Jayna\" derived from the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] characters [[Tarzan]] and his romantic interest [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]]. According to McNeil, \"Originally Zan (Dick) had '[[Plastic Man]]' powers and Jayna (Jane) could transform into anything, not just animals, but they were scaled back to their present powers as it made the other Super Friends (even [[Superman]]) seem almost superfluous.\"<ref name=\"blogspot1\">{{cite web|author=Marc Tyler Nobleman |url=http://noblemania.blogspot.com/2011/07/super-70s-and-80s-super-friendsdarrell.html |title=Noblemania: Super \u201870s and \u201880s: \"Super Friends\"\u2014Darrell McNeil, animator |publisher=Noblemania.blogspot.com |date=2011-07-29 |accessdate=2013-09-10}}</ref> Jayna's distinctive [[hairdo]] was based on that of an animation checker at Hanna-Barbera, while the pointed ears were inspired by the character [[Spock]] from the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise.

Newsarama.</ref>\n\nIn the 2013 comic ''[[Justice League 3000]]'', the handlers of the new Justice League are named Teri and Terry, nicknamed The Wonder Twins and working for Cadmus.\n\nIn \"Superpowers\", a 2017 backup series in ''Cave Carson Has A Cybernetic Eye'', cartoonist [[Tom Scioli]] offers a slightly different version of the origin of the Wonder Twins, set on an alternate Earth.<ref>\"Cave Carson Has A Cybernetic Eye\" 1 (October, 2016)</ref>\n\nIn February of 2019, the first issue of a 6-issue mini-series was released on Wonder Comics, titled \"Wonder Twins.\"  It was so well received and did so well in sales that it was expanded to a 12-issue maxi-series.  The Wonder Comics imprint is considered part of the current DCU, so this places the Wonder Twins in current DC continuity. \n\nIn September of 2019, the Wonder Twins have a cameo appearance in Action Comics #1015, which also guest stars new Wonder Comics hero Naomi. \n\nWonder Comics is also having their own first crossover event, taking place in Young Justice issue #12, which will feature Naomi and the Wonder Twins as guest stars in Young Justice.  \n\nThe Wonder Twins are also on the cover of \"Superman: Heroes\" #1.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}\nThe Wonder Twins powers are activated when they touch each other and speak the phrase, \"Wonder Twin powers, activate!\" Physical contact is required. If the two are out of reach of each other, they are unable to activate their powers. As they are about to transform, they would each announce their intended form. \"Shape of...\", \"Form of...\"\n\nZan can transform into water at any state (solid, liquid, gas) and add to his mass by incorporating water in his immediate area. In the case of becoming solid ice, he can also become any form he chooses, from a {{convert|5000|ft|m|adj=on}} humanoid ice giant to a cage for a criminal to complex machinery (such as a jet engine, as he did in the episode \"Eruption\"). In the episode \"Pressure Point,\" he changes into a gelatinous form. In the episode \"Terror from the Phantom Zone,\" he was able to transform into [[liquid nitrogen]]. In addition, he can transform himself into atmospheric disturbances (usually very localized) involving water, such as a [[blizzard]], a [[monsoon]], [[waterspout]] or a [[typhoon]], as he did in the episodes \"The Water Beast\", \"The Beasts are Coming\", and \"Stowaways.\"\n\nJayna can transform into any animal, whether real, mythological, indigenous to Earth, or indigenous to some other planet like Exxor. Since she must vocalize her choice of form to assume, she must know the common name. As revealed in \"The Mummy of Nazca,\" naming the wrong animal will cause her to assume the wrong animal's form. She has been known to take the form of anything from a mosquito to a whale, as in \"The Water Beast\" episode.\n\nIn the ''Super Friends'' comic book, their powers were shown to be more extensive. By transforming into an animal of [[Krypton (comics)|Kryptonian]] origin, for instance, Jayna could gain both the creature's natural abilities and the super-powers that all Kryptonians possess under Earth-like conditions; she was even capable of overpowering [[Superman]] in the form of a Kryptonian animal.<ref>''Super Friends'' #42 (March 1981)--Jayna defeats Superman in a training exercise by becoming a Kryptonian ''Tanthou Flez'' (\"Winged One\")</ref>  Similarly, Zan was able to transform into anything tangentially related to water or ice, including a [[J\u00f6tunn|frost giant]] in the \"Demons of Exxor\" episode.\n\nIn addition to their powers of transformation, the two share a telepathic link, enabling one to alert the other over a distance when in dire circumstances, as revealed in the episode \"The Village of Lost Souls.\"\n\nThe Wonder Twins have a pet Space Monkey named [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]], who has a useful prehensile tail and who could act as a conduit for the twins to activate their powers should they be out of reach. Gleek also served as a courier when the twins needed to travel: Jayna would typically transform into a large [[eagle]], and Zan would transform into [[water]], \"jumping\" into a bucket which Gleek would be holding while clutched by Jayna in her eagle form.\n\nA rarely seen aspect of their powers is the ability to break mind control. On at least two occasions (\"Pied Piper From Space\" and \"Circus of Horrors\"), while the twins were under the influence of mind control, [[Gleek (Super Friends)|Gleek]] caused them to make contact and the activation of their powers freed them instantly from the mind control.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Television===\n* In the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode \"Injustice For All\", statues of the Twins are briefly seen in a museum devoted to super-powered heroes.  Later in the same scene, the two statues are destroyed during the battle between the heroes and villains.\n\n* In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', two characters called '''Downpour''' and '''Shifter''' appear in the episode \"Ultimatum\" where they were both voiced by [[Grey DeLisle]]. They are members of the Ultimen, a group of superheroes created by the [[United States government|government]] and [[Project Cadmus]] with [[Maxwell Lord]] as their sponsor. The group is a [[pastiche]] of the heroes that were created for ''Super Friends'', with Downpour and Shifter specifically a pastiche of the Wonder Twins. Downpour and his twin sister Shifter have [[albino]] white skin, pink eyes and pointy ears. Downpour would say the name of a liquid in order to turn into that liquid (like [[flood]], [[water]], and [[Tidal bore|tidal wave]]) while Shifter would say the name of a creature (like a [[sea serpent]], a [[lion]], a [[rhinoceros]], a [[African buffalo|cape buffalo]], and a [[Tyrannosaurus]]) in order to become that creature. Later on in the episode, Downpour and Shifter were with the Ultimen when they learned on their own that the Ultimen were clones created by Project Cadmus. After Wind Dragon had used his wind attacks to bring Maxwell Lord to the roof that they were on, Downpour became water that entrapped Maxwell Lord while Shifter became a lion asking which is worse: drowning in water or being eaten by a lion. Maxwell Lord convinced them to let him explain over the fact that Project Cadmus had created them in order to be better heroes with the clones having implanted images and interact with actors that portrayed their parents. When it came to attacking the building they lived in while hunting for Maxwell Lord's boss Amanda Waller, Downpour and Shifter fought Aquaman and were defeated. Clones of the characters later appear in the episode \"Panic in the Sky\" where they join the other Ultimatum clones into attacking the Watchtower. Some clones of Downpour formed a water trap around [[Fire (comics)|Fire]] until she managed to heat herself to the point of breaking free.\n\n* Zan appeared in season 1, episode 2 of the [[Adult Swim]] series ''[[Harvey Birdman: Attorney at Law]]''. In the episode, Zan (voiced by [[Michael Bell (actor)|Michael Bell]]) is on the stand being questioned by Harvey Birdman.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://video.adultswim.com/harvey-birdman-attorney-at-law/i-was-the-bathwater.html |title=I Was the Bathwater - Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law - Adult Swim Video |publisher=Video.adultswim.com |date=2007-06-22 |accessdate=2013-09-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231012337/http://video.adultswim.com/harvey-birdman-attorney-at-law/i-was-the-bathwater.html |archivedate=2012-12-31 }}</ref> In 2007, the Adult Swim website ran a series of five [[webisode]]s entitled \"The New Adventures of the Wonder Twins.\" These shorts were not canon, but rather a [[Black comedy|dark-humor]] [[parody]]. Zan and Jayna were portrayed as well-meaning but inept, with their attempts at heroism always ending in tragic failure.\n\n* In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"A Fish Out of Water\", Peter Griffin and his dog Brian put their rings together and simultaneously say \"Wonder Twin powers, activate\", after which Peter states what he wants to be changed into. Brian says to Peter, \"Peter, we got these rings out of a box of \"Franken Berry\". In another episode, \"Fast Times at Buddy Cianci Jr. High\", Peter reveals that he was once one of the Wonder Twins. In his flashback, it is revealed that after activating their powers, Peter turned himself into Jayna's tampon.\n\n[[Image:SmallvilleWonderTwins.jpg|200px|thumb|[[David Gallagher]] as Zan and [[Allison Scagliotti]] as Jayna in the Smallville episode \"Idol\".]]\n* Zan and Jayna appeared in the ''[[Smallville]]'' season nine episode, \"Idol\", which aired on November 13, 2009. Zan was played by [[David Gallagher]] and Jayna by [[Allison Scagliotti]]. They both carry cell phones that have an image of Gleek on the back and that make the sound of Gleek laughing as a [[ringtone]]. Though not explicitly labeled as aliens, the two are implied to be from another world{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} and claim to be of [[Swedish people|Swedish]] descent in order to explain their odd-sounding names. The Twins are portrayed as being obsessed with \"The Blur\" (the name given to Clark Kent before he officially adopts the [[Superman]] identity), and attempt to impersonate him in order to build up his positive reputation. They send a crate to young reporter [[Lois Lane]] containing several bound and gagged drug dealers who turn out to be undercover cops that Zan and Jayna abducted by mistake, thus ruining a calculated police drug sting. When an attempt at stopping a robbery accidentally causes a citywide blackout in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], the Twins are ambushed and abducted by Clark and his partner [[Chloe Sullivan]]. After being threatened into giving up their vigilante activities, Zan and Jayna prove their worth when Lois is thrown from the rooftop of the ''[[Daily Planet]]'' building by a crooked politician who wants to expose \"The Blur's\" true identity. Jayna transforms into an attack dog and captures the politician as he attempts to flee the scene, while Zan transforms his body into a massive cloud of mist, providing the cover Clark needs to lower Lois safely to the ground unobserved. After this, the Twins are encouraged by Clark to continue their super heroics outside of Metropolis, albeit on their own reputations rather than attempting to emulate him.\n\n* In the ''[[Flash (2014 TV series)|Flash]]'' episode \"Crazy for You\", Barry Allen rescues a man and woman by the names of Jayna and Zay from a burning car. Unlike in the comics, it appears these versions are a couple rather than twins.\n\n* The Wonder Twins appear in the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' episode \"You're Fired\"{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} with Zan voiced by [[Khary Payton]] and Jayna voiced by [[Tara Strong]]. They appear amongst the heroes at the audition for the replacement of [[Beast Boy]]. Although Robin was impressed with Jayna, Zan was hired as a [[receptionist]] with Jayna stating that she needs Zan to activate her powers. Beast Boy works with Zan to sabotage Jayna's attempts. After Zan comes clean, he turns into water and escapes into the toilet. In the form of a pelican, Beast Boy catches Zan before he can land in the ocean. Zan and Jayna later leave with Zan in the form of an ice unicycle and Jayna in the form of an octopus.\n\n===Film===\n* The Wonder Twins appear in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie]]''. They are seen at the 57th Annual Justice League Anniversary Party.\n\n* The Wonder Twins make a brief appearance in ''[[Teen Titans Go! To the Movies]].''\n\n===Video games===\nThe ''Teen Titans Go!'' incarnations of the Wonder Twins appear in ''[[Lego Dimensions]]''. They appear in a sidequest where Janya requests the player to find a bucket to catch Zan with in case he tries to escape again like he did in the \"You're Fired\" episode. The ''Lego Batman Movie'' incarnations also cameo in the ''Lego Batman Movie'' story pack.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=2110|title=Zan}}\n*{{comicbookdb|type=character|id=2111|title=Jayna}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100202153527/http://www.mykey3000.com/cosmicteams/profiles/zan+jayna.htm Cosmic Teams: Zan and Jayna]\n* [http://www.dcuguide.com/who.php?name=wondertwins DCU Guide: Wonder Twins]\n* [http://www.seanbaby.com/superfriends/wondertwins.htm Seanbaby's Wonder Twins page]\n* [http://www.kryptonsite.com/smallvillespoilers.htm Kryptonsite: Smallville Spoilers]\n* {{tv.com show|wonder-twins|The New Adventures of the Wonder Twins|type=web}}\n\n{{Superfriends series}}\n\n[[Category:2019 comics debuts]]\n[[Category:Animated duos]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1977]]\n[[Category:DC Comics aliens]]\n[[Category:DC Comics female superheroes]]\n[[Category:DC Comics superheroes]]\n[[Category:Extraterrestrial superheroes]]\n[[Category:Female characters in animation]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with ice or cold abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters with water abilities]]\n[[Category:Fictional clones]]\n[[Category:Fictional extraterrestrial characters]]\n[[Category:Fictional duos]]\n[[Category:Fictional shapeshifters]]\n[[Category:Fictional twins]]\n[[Category:Hanna-Barbera characters]]\n[[Category:Super Friends characters]]\n[[Category:Superheroes]]\n[[Category:Superheroes who are adopted]]\n[[Category:Television duos]]\n", "name_user": "On the Bowery", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eVideo games:fixed typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Twins"}
