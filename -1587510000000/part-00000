The contestants, referred to as \"HouseGuests,\" are sequestered in the Big Brother House with no contact to or from the outside world. Each week, the HouseGuests take part in several compulsory challenges that determine who will win food, luxuries and power in the house.\n\nAt the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in the Head of Household (HoH) competition. The winner of the HoH competition will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. As with [[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|the previous season]], the first five weeks of the season feature two concurrent Heads of Household. Each HoH would nominate two other HouseGuests for eviction, totaling four nominees. The two pairs of nominees would then compete in the \"Battle of the Block\" competition. The winning pair would be removed from the block, with the HoH who nominated them dethroned. The dethroned HoH would later be eligible to be nominated as a replacement if the Veto was used, while the Battle of the Block winners are safe for the rest of the week. The rest of the cycle would continue as per usual, with the remaining HoH retaining immunity for the week, and the two nominees being eligible for safety through the Power of Veto. The reigning (or sole) HoH also earns the right to name the \"Have Nots\" for the week, forcing the chosen HouseGuests to eat solely \"Big Brother slop\" and a weekly food selection chosen by producers, take cold showers, and sleep in a bedroom designed to look like a dental clinic.\n\nEach week, six HouseGuests are selected to compete in the Power of Veto (PoV) competition: the reigning HoH, their two nominees, and three HouseGuests selected by random draw. The winner of the PoV competition wins the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated HouseGuests or leave them as is; if the veto winner uses this power, the HoH must immediately nominate another HouseGuest for eviction. The PoV winner is also immune from being named as the replacement nominee. The HouseGuest overthrown as a result of the Battle of the Block competition is eligible to be nominated by the reigning Head of Household if the Power of Veto is used.\n\nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests vote to evict one of the two nominees, with the exception of the nominees and the Head of Household, who is only allowed to vote in the event of a tie, and in that case, must do so publicly. This compulsory vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. Unlike most other versions of Big Brother, the HouseGuests may openly and freely discuss the nomination and eviction process. The nominee with the majority of votes will be evicted from the house on the weekly live broadcast, exiting to an adjacent studio to be interviewed by Chen, after which the cycle begins again.\n\nHouseGuests may voluntarily leave the house at any time and those who break the rules may be expelled from the house. The last nine evicted HouseGuests will form the Big Brother jury, and vote for the winner during the season finale. The jury members will be sequestered in a separate house and will not be allowed to watch the show except for competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests; the jury members will not be shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations.\n\n===Twists===\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\n\n====BB Takeover====\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\nCBS announced the season's twist, BB Takeover, on June 17, 2015, in which a surprise guest was to visit the house each week to reveal a different twist to the HouseGuests.<ref name=\"BB Takeover\">{{cite web|title='Big Brother' Announces this Season's New Twist, 'BB Takeover,' Featuring Weekly Surprise Guests Who Will Shake Up the House Each and Every Week|url=http://www.cbspressexpress.com/cbs-entertainment/releases/view?id=42928|website=CBS Press Express|accessdate=June 17, 2015|date=June 17, 2015}}</ref> Though it was initially announced that there would be a guest every week, there were no Takeovers after Week 3; in an interview during the season, host Julie Chen stated that the twist had been cancelled because \"there was enough going on\u201d with the other elements of the game, though no official announcement was ever made to the HouseGuests.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why the Big Brother twist BB Takeover disappeared|url=http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2015/08/bb17-bb-takeover-what-happened-julie-chen/|website=Reality Blurred|first=Andy|last=Dehnart|accessdate=August 11, 2015|date=August 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%\"|Week\n! style=\"width:15%\"|Takeover guest\n! style=\"width:20%\"|Twist\n! style=\"width:60%\"|Effect\n|-\n! rowspan=2|1\n| rowspan=2|[[Phil Keoghan]]\n| Two additional HouseGuests\n| ''[[The Amazing Race 26]]'' alumni Jackie and Jeff entered the game.\n|-\n| [[#BB Fast Forward|BB Fast Forward]]\n| Immunity for the week was granted to the two HouseGuests who sat out of the first HoH competitions and one HouseGuest of their choice each.\n|-\n! 2\n| [[Kathy Griffin]]\n| [[#Last Laugh|The Last Laugh]]\n| The power to block three HouseGuests from voting in the next eviction was granted to the HouseGuest who answered the seventh call to a phone booth in the house.\n|-\n! rowspan=2|3\n| rowspan=2|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n| Gronk Party Week\n| Have-Nots were removed for the week, provided the HouseGuests participated in Gronk Parties throughout.\n|-\n| Luxury competition \n| All of the week's competition winners earned a chance to win a cabin on a three-day cruise.\n|}\n\n====Battle of the Block====\nThe Battle of the block was first introduced in [[Big Brother 16 (American season)|the sixteenth season]].

A mutual attraction began to form between Clay and Shelli, as did an early alliance between Audrey, Da'Vonne, and Shelli. Julie Chen revealed the return of the [[Big Brother 17 (U.S.)#Battle of the Block|Battle of the Block]] twist and announced the first Head of Household competition. First, the HouseGuests were told that one of them would have to sit out of the competition; Da'Vonne volunteered in exchange for none of the others nominating her, to which they all agreed.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Flying Tomatoes\"):''' The HouseGuests, standing on movable perches, were pelted with plastic tomatoes; as HouseGuests fell off, they were eliminated. The first HouseGuest to catch ten tomatoes or the last one remaining on the perch, whichever occurred first, became the first Head of Household.\n\nAudrey, Jace, James, and Shelli were the final four competitors remaining, but all fell off at the same time; upon review of the footage, James was determined to have fallen off last, so he was named the first Head of Household. The HouseGuests were told about the [[Big Brother 17 (U.S.)#BB Takeover|BB Takeover]], in which a new twist would be introduced every week. Addressing the viewing public, Julie revealed the final twist, which would be kept secret from the HouseGuests.

Vanessa held court to help her with her decision and settled on Austin. Da'Vonne decided not to protect her allies Audrey and Shelli in order to hide their alliance and picked Liz instead. Da'Vonne's decision angered Shelli, and she later flirted with Clay, which made Da'Vonne question her loyalty. Austin and Jace bonded and later formed an alliance called ShellTown, but Jace's brash remarks and physique made him a target to several HouseGuests, including Jason. James and Jason teamed up with Audrey and Da'Vonne to backdoor Jace and tried to recruit other HouseGuests to be nominated as pawns. Jason nominated Becky and John while James nominated Jackie and Steve.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"DuBoB\"):''' The pairs navigated a series of balance beams to transport blocks to a platform and used them to build a tower according to a blueprint.

To save themselves, Austin and Jace formed an alliance with Audrey and James, who had no intention of deviating from their initial plan to take out Jace. While preparing for a possible future counting competition, Da'Vonne wandered into all the rooms, alarming Clay, Jeff, and Shelli, which led to both factions plotting against each other. Jeff and Clay's attempts to address the situation led to further confrontations, and Audrey later tried to get Clay and Da'Vonne to make up, to no avail. Audrey and Da'Vonne independently considered betraying each other\u2014Audrey for Da'Vonne's attitude and Da'Vonne for Audrey's constant meddling. James had to choose four Have-Nots; he picked the four HouseGuests protected by the BB Fast Forward\u2014Austin, Da'Vonne, Liz, and Vanessa. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, John, Jason, and Becky were selected to compete.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Nose-a Scotia\"):''' The six competitors dug for pieces with a letter on them; each letter had an assigned point value. The HouseGuest who made the correctly-spelled word that was worth the most points won the Power of Veto.\n\nSteve won the Power of Veto with the word \"trombonists.\" Audrey decided to bring Jeff and Shelli into her main alliance, but her incessant strategizing in the middle of the night alienated her allies, making James consider putting her up as the replacement nominee.

The HouseGuest who answered the seventh call would earn the right to stop three HouseGuests from voting in the next eviction.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Ginger Fever\"):''' Divided into two groups of seven by random draw, the HouseGuests raced to assemble a puzzle.

Becky proposed backdooring Audrey; while Shelli initially agreed, she later conspired with Clay and Jeff to target Da'Vonne after their altercation the previous week. The trio recruited John to be nominated as a pawn and told him to throw the Battle of the Block competition while pledging that they would do whatever they could to ensure his safety. Shelli nominated Da'Vonne and John while Becky, still hoping to backdoor Audrey, nominated Jason\u2014as payback for him putting her up the previous week\u2014and Steve.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"Give Me Props\"):''' The pairs, conjoined by a single shirt and a three-legged pair of pants, operated nine cameras and repositioned them to follow a shot list; the cameras corresponded to a specific shot but were unlabeled. The first pair that correctly lined up all nine cameras earned safety for the week and dethroned the Head of Household who nominated them.\n\nJason and Steve only operated two cameras at a time, which proved to be an effective strategy. Meanwhile, Da'Vonne's idea to turn on all nine cameras at once put her and John at a disadvantage, and he didn't even need to actively try to throw the competition. Jason and Steve handily won the competition, dethroning Becky and keeping Shelli in power and putting the plan to backdoor Audrey in jeopardy.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 552\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n| Title = Episode 7\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|08}}\n| Aux1 = Days 16\u201319\n| ShortSummary = While a dethroned Becky was convinced that the plan to backdoor Audrey was still on the agenda, Shelli continued to plot Da'Vonne's eviction. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Meg, Steve, and Clay were drawn to join Shelli, Da'Vonne, and John.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"High Maintenance\"):''' Two competitors would be given a list of seven items and then shown an image with six of those items. The first competitor to press their buzzer after retrieving the missing item from an adjacent room would win the round, and the other competitor would be eliminated from the competition. If the first player to press their buzzer brought back a wrong item, they would be eliminated. The winner would then choose one of the remaining competitors to play in the next round who in turn would choose their opponent. The last competitor remaining won the Power of Veto.\n\nIn the final round, John beat Clay to win the Power of Veto, which forced Shelli to find a replacement nominee. After unsuccessfully trying to get John to not use the Veto on himself, Shelli considered nominating Liz. Liz's allies Austin and Vanessa tried to get Shelli to put Meg up instead, telling Shelli that Meg was going to work with Da'Vonne, James, and Jason to save Da'Vonne and target Clay and Shelli and that the only way to ensure Da'Vonne's eviction was to nominate Meg as a pawn. Audrey later reprimanded Clay for being condescending, which prompted Clay to convince Shelli to nominate Audrey instead. However, at the Veto Meeting, after John used the Power of Veto on himself, Shelli decided to listen to Austin and Vanessa and nominated Meg.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 553\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 8\n| Title = Episode 8\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|09}}\n| Aux1 = Days 19\u201322\n| ShortSummary = A telephone booth appeared in the house for Kathy's BB Takeover, and she told the HouseGuests about the Last Laugh twist. Da'Vonne answered the seventh call and earned the power to stop three of the HouseGuests from voting in the upcoming eviction, which meant that she only needed five votes to survive the eviction. Da'Vonne and Jason suspected that Liz had been playing with a twin and alerted the other HouseGuests. Da'Vonne tried to use this information as leverage to secure Liz's vote. At the live eviction, Da'Vonne used the power of the Last Laugh to stop Becky, Jackie, and Jeff from voting, but it didn't matter, as she was evicted anyway after everyone except Audrey and Jason voted against her, and she became the second HouseGuest to be evicted from the house. [[New England Patriots]] [[tight end]] [[Rob Gronkowski]] kicked off his BB Takeover, Gronk's Party Week, by announcing that there would be no Have-Nots that week.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Gronk Pong\"):''' One at a time, each HouseGuest launched a ball toward 55 oversized cups arranged in the shape of a triangle. Each cup had its own unique point value; the two HouseGuests with the highest scores became the new Heads of Household.\n\nAustin became the first new Head of Household while James, Liz, and Vanessa tied for second; Vanessa won the tiebreaker and became the second new Head of Household.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 3|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 554\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n| Title = Episode 9\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|12}}\n| Aux1 = Days 21\u201323\n| ShortSummary = The night before Da'Vonne's eviction, Vanessa confronted Liz, not knowing it was actually Julia, about the rumors of her being a twin, which Julia confessed to, and Vanessa brought in Austin, Clay, and Shelli to protect the twins and ensure that they make it past the first five evictions in order to increase their numbers. The next night, \nJulia and Liz switched again, and Liz joined her new allies in officially forming the Sixth Sense alliance. Allies and new Heads of Household Austin and Vanessa planned to target Jeff and James as the strongest members of the opposing alliance with James as the upfront target and Jeff to be potentially backdoored. Austin and Vanessa planned for Vanessa to remain Head of Household after the Battle of the Block to allow her to improve her social connections. Austin nominated Jason and Meg, Jeff and James's allies, while Vanessa nominated James and John, who again had been recruited to throw the Battle of the Block competition in exchange for future protection. To remove suspicion, Austin told his nominees that Audrey, not Jeff, was the backdoor target.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"Gronk's A-maze-ing Foam Party\"):''' One at a time, a competitor searched through a pile of clothing for a patterned item and then waded through a foam maze to deliver it to the person wearing that pattern. After bringing the person to the starting platform, the player then switched out with their partner. The first pair that brought ten people out of the maze earned safety for the week and dethroned the Head of Household who nominated them.\n\nFor the second week in a row, John had no need to throw the competition, as James was confused by the patterns.

Audrey, Austin, and Shelli were randomly chosen to compete in the Veto competition. In order to justify not nominating her as a replacement if the Veto was used, Vanessa conspired with the Sixth Sense to throw the competition to Audrey.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Gronk and Roll\"):''' Two players in giant six-sided [[dice]] went head-to-head. A number between one and six would be randomly selected, and the two competitors maneuvered around the playing field attempting to return to their starting platform with the correct number on top. The first to do so stayed in the competition, eliminating their opponent. After five rounds, the last competitor remaining won the Power of Veto.\n\nThe plot to throw the competition to Audrey was foiled after she was defeated by John, and he went on to defeat Austin in the final round to earn his second consecutive Veto. Vanessa, now needing to find a replacement nominee, accused Austin of throwing the final round to John. As part of Rob Gronkowski's BB Takeover, he mandated that all HouseGuests participate in parties; any non-participating HouseGuests would become Have-Nots. All of the HouseGuests participated. Jeff talked to Vanessa to ensure his safety and realized that she had no intention of nominating Audrey. Jason then alerted Jeff to the fact that Austin and Vanessa were working together, which Jeff told Clay, unaware that Clay was also working with them. Austin decided to call Jeff out for talking against him, and Jeff's resulting confrontation with Vanessa provided enough reason for her to nominate him.\n\n*'''Luxury Competition:''' The week's competition winners\u2014Austin, Vanessa, Jason, Meg, and John\u2014picked a cup at random; one of the cups had a chip at the bottom that would earn its owner a cabin on a three-day cruise with Rob.\n\nMeg won the Luxury Competition.

Liz returned to the house, much to the delight of Austin, who had been developing feelings for her. Jeff, during his campaign, told Liz that he knew about the Twin Twist, and she decided to flirt with him in order to control him. Austin walked in on the two lying in bed together under the covers, which made him angry and jealous. Jeff's campaigning ultimately earned him votes from Jackie, John, Liz, and Steve, but it wasn't enough, as he became the third HouseGuest to be evicted from the house after the other seven voters voted against him.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Bustin' Moves\"):''' The HouseGuests were asked true or false questions based on a 1990s-inspired dance routine they had just watched; HouseGuests who answered incorrectly were eliminated.

With Liz as one of the new Heads of Household, HouseGuests suspicious about her being a twin\u2014especially John\u2014scoured her new bedroom for clues. Jackie, now without any allies thanks to Jeff's eviction, was approached by Austin in order to potentially work with her later and told her that she was likely to be nominated by Liz. After Jackie discussed her impending nomination with Shelli, Shelli considered severing ties with the volatile Austin. Audrey told Shelli that Jason was coming after her; deciding to target him, Shelli and Clay recruited John to be a pawn, this time to ensure that Jason went home. Liz nominated Jackie and James while Shelli nominated Jason and John. After Liz assured Jackie that she was safe, Jackie asked Liz who the real target was, which angered Liz. Shelli told Jason that Audrey had told her that he was targeting her, which Jason denied. After Audrey told Shelli that it was a lie, Shelli considered nominating her if the Power of Veto was used.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"[[Grunge (music)|Grunge]] BoB\"):''' The pairs dove through [[mudhoney]] to get to four zones themed after grunge bands from the 1990s\u2014[[Pearl Jam]], [[Screaming Trees]], [[Soundgarden]], and [[Smashing Pumpkins]]\u2014to find one key in each. They then used the four keys to unlock a mannequin, [[Alice in Chains|Alice]], tied up in chains. The first pair that unchained Alice and took her to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], the finish platform, won the competition.\n\nThough Jason and John had an early lead, they fell behind in the pumpkin smashing zone, which allowed Jackie and James to come from behind to win the competition, dethroning Liz and keeping Shelli in power and putting the plan to backdoor Audrey in jeopardy again.

Clay later discussed it with Audrey while trying to dissuade her paranoia regarding being backdoored. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, James, Meg, and Vanessa were chosen to compete. After Audrey wasn't chosen to compete for the Veto, all of those chosen plotted to use it on John so that Shelli could nominate Audrey as the replacement, though Shelli was later distraught regarding her impending decision.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Saved by the Smell\"):''' In each round, the six competitors were given a list of chemicals and then instructed to pour a specific chemical based on a question about the list. If a competitor was incorrect, they would be eliminated and splattered with paint; the last competitor remaining won the Power of Veto.\n\nIn the fifth round, Vanessa beat Jason and John to win the competition. After Audrey complained about her loneliness in the game to Clay, he berated her for not trusting their alliance, which quickly escalated into an argument after Audrey denied asking Clay if Shelli was going to backdoor her, leading to subsequent altercations with Shelli and Vanessa. After the confrontations, Audrey secluded herself from the other HouseGuests and didn't even attend the Veto Meeting, although it didn't matter because Vanessa used the Power of Veto on Jason, and Shelli nominated Audrey in his place.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 559\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 14\n| Title = Episode 14\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|23}}\n| Aux1 = Days 33\u201336\n| ShortSummary = After spending five hours in the Diary Room before the Veto Meeting, Audrey retreated to the Have-Not room, prompting the other HouseGuests to wonder if she would quit the game. Ultimately, Audrey remained in the game until eviction night when she became the fourth HouseGuest to be evicted after everyone except Austin voted against her, and she received a penalty vote for breaking the Have-Not rule by eating regular food.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Pop Till You Drop\"):''' Two HouseGuests, competing head-to-head, listened to a 1990s pop song about a past competition. The first to buzz in with the correct competition type (\"Head of Household,\" \"Battle of the Block,\" or \"Power of Veto\") won the round, and the other HouseGuest was eliminated. If the first player to buzz in was wrong, they were eliminated and the other HouseGuest would choose the next match-up.

Jason, along with Meg, told Shelli and Vanessa, both of whom continued to lose trust in Austin. After the eviction and the Head of Household competition, Austin lied to Vanessa about his conversation with Jason, and she conspired with Clay, Shelli, and Jackie to betray him. Jackie and Vanessa decided to work together to backdoor Austin and to ensure that Jackie became the surviving Head of Household as Vanessa had already been the surviving Head of Household once before. Vanessa nominated Becky and a volunteering Clay with the hope that they would win and be safe while Jackie nominated Liz and James, who had been recruited to throw the Battle of the Block. An alliance of Vanessa, Jackie, Shelli, Clay, Jason, James, Becky, and Meg called Dark Moon was formed with the idea of them being the final eight HouseGuests.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"Splashy Headlines\"):''' The pairs threw paint around a room to reveal letters that spelled the names of three ''[[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|Big Brother 16]]'' HouseGuests.

Austin's attraction to Liz developed; though she enjoyed her time with him, she privately admitted that she didn't return his affections, though he was unaware and kissed her anyway. Shelli, Liz, and John were drawn to join Vanessa, Becky, and Clay in the Power of Veto competition.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Get Nutty\"):''' The competitors rolled a plastic acorn back and forth on a ramp; the first competitor to roll it 250 times in a row without dropping it won the Power of Veto.\n\nClay won the Power of Veto, setting the plan to backdoor Austin in motion. Vanessa first told Liz about it and then decided to confront Austin about what he had said to Jason. When Austin relayed his heated conversation with Vanessa to Clay and Shelli, they realized that they needed to keep him in the game as, despite his volatility, he was loyal to them. Clay and Shelli attempted to convince Vanessa to change the plan, and Vanessa proposed getting rid of Jason, the smartest player outside of the Sixth Sense. At the Veto Meeting, Clay used the Power of Veto on himself, and Vanessa nominated Jason in his place.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 562\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 17\n| Title = Episode 17\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|30}}\n| Aux1 = Days 40\u201343\n| ShortSummary = After Jason's nomination, the members of Dark Moon not in the Sixth Sense\u2014Becky, Jackie, James, Jason, and Meg\u2014felt betrayed by Vanessa and discussed it with Clay and Shelli. Though Clay and Shelli remained adamant about not knowing about Jason's nomination, Jason realized that they had known, and their refusal to own up to it worried Vanessa, who had to shoulder the entire blame for the plan. The alliance of Jackie, James, Jason, and Meg campaigned for Jason's safety, but it wasn't enough as he became the fifth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house after only James and Meg voted to keep him. Having survived five evictions, Liz and Julia earned the right to compete as individuals, and Julia officially entered the game as a HouseGuest.

Shelli, not wanting to be Head of Household for a third time, proposed a deal to John and James for her and Clay's safety for the week. James agreed to keep them and John safe, and John and Shelli dropped off to make James the sole Head of Household, taking the Sixth Sense out of power for the first time since Week 1. Now in the house together, Julia and Liz discussed Austin telling Jason that he would target Julia; though Liz believed that Austin was trustworthy and that Jason had been lying, Julia was firmly against Austin. Finally in control, Jackie, James, and Meg decided to target Clay and Shelli for betraying them the previous week and debated putting them both up directly or backdooring Shelli. They discussed it with Becky who, unbeknownst to them, relayed James's plan back to Clay and Shelli. Clay and Shelli tried to convince James to honor their deal and target Austin instead. Vanessa, knowing full well that she was responsible for sending two of James's closest allies home in Jeff and Jason in Week 3 and Week 5, respectively, offered James and one other person of his choice safety until the final seven, provided he didn't nominate her. James took Vanessa up on her deal and avenged Jason's blindside by nominating Clay and Shelli, breaking his deal with them that he had made earlier. Shelli called James out for betraying them and continued to claim that they had nothing to do with Jason's nomination, which further alienated Vanessa.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 564\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 19\n| Title = Episode 19\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|05}}\n| Aux1 = Days 44\u201347\n| ShortSummary = Clay and Shelli lamented being on the block with each other. Clay yelled at James for breaking their deal and told Shelli that he was ready to sacrifice himself to keep her, the bigger threat to win, in the game. Vanessa, upset that Clay and Shelli were refusing to own up to their roles in Jason's nomination, broke down, and James told her that it was that refusal that caused him to target them for eviction and not Vanessa. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Jackie, Vanessa, and Becky were chosen to compete.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Game of Throws\"):''' In each round, the competitors launched a dart onto a board that was divided into sections with assigned point values. The player who scored the fewest points in each round was eliminated. Upon elimination, each HouseGuest uncovered a prize that could be good or bad; they could then choose to keep their prize or trade it for another eliminated HouseGuest's prize. After all five rounds, the HouseGuest holding the Veto medallion won the Power of Veto.\n\nShelli initially won the Veto, but after the fifth round, James took the Veto for himself. Jackie had to wear a [[unitard]] shaped like a suit of armor, and Vanessa was forced to shine Jackie's armor for 24 hours. Clay won a trip to Ireland, and Becky won $5,000. Shelli had to perform a regimen with a sword 2,400 times in 24 hours; if she failed, then she would be ineligible to compete in the next Veto competition. After completing her punishment, Shelli attempted to get James to use the Power of Veto on her and to nominate Austin for being deceptive, but James chose not to use it, ensuring that Clay and Shelli would be separated.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 565\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 20\n| Title = Episode 20\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|06}}\n| Aux1 = Days 47\u201350\n| ShortSummary = Having had romantic feelings for each other since Day 1, Clay and Shelli vowed to not campaign against each other. James and his alliance targeted Shelli, but Vanessa campaigned to keep her. James told Austin that Clay and Shelli had campaigned against him but didn't reveal what they had told him. Vanessa, knowing the Sixth Sense was crumbling, affirmed with Austin, Shelli, and the twins that they needed to stay together. Knowing that their time together was running out, Clay and Shelli finally kissed. When discussing whom to eliminate, Vanessa campaigned hard for Shelli, alarming James and Jackie as to Vanessa's true motives. During the live eviction, Clay asked the voters to evict him; they respected his wish, and he became the sixth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house and the first to be evicted by a unanimous vote. After Clay's eviction, Julie informed the HouseGuests that the next nine evicted HouseGuests would make up the game-deciding Jury and that they may not be out of the game upon eviction.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Midway Mayhem\"):''' The HouseGuests skated down an icy path while transporting liquid in a funnel to a container, which contained three labeled balls: Head of Household, $5,000, and a Never-Not Pass, which would exempt the winner from being a Have-Not for the remainder of the game.

Clay, in an attempt to patch things up, told Vanessa that James told John that Vanessa was targeting him, which resulted in a confrontation between Clay and James in which Clay threatened violence. Vanessa then publicly discussed the situation with Clay; though John admitted that James had nothing to do with it and it was all his thoughts, Vanessa didn't believe him. Clay, John and Shelli compared notes and realized that it was a whole misunderstanding. They realized that Vanessa's emotional outbursts were routinely used to send her targets home, and pledged to retaliate so that it wouldn't happen to them next. Becky had such a large lead in the HoH competition that she was able to win all three prizes. Though Becky had worked with both James' alliance and the Sixth Sense, many were unsure as to who she would target. Becky teamed up with Jackie, James and Meg to nominate Shelli and Steve under the guise of targeting Shelli as per the agreement of evicting her and Clay consecutively, but actually backdoor Vanessa, having eavesdropped on the confrontations between Clay, James and Vanessa earlier that day. Becky told Shelli about her plan and told her to act as if she didn't know to stop Vanessa from thinking something was up, though Vanessa became suspicious after Becky told her that John was the backdoor target and then refused to make a deal.

John later told Shelli to pick him to play, but she was hesitant about clueing Vanessa into the plan. John told Steve about the plan to backdoor Vanessa and also asked him to pick him for the Veto competition as well, but John said he wouldn't use the Veto to save him, only to save Shelli and ensure Vanessa's nomination, as he believed that no one would ever vote to evict Steve. Liz began developing romantic feelings for Austin, much to Julia's disapproval. When picking players for the Veto competition, Austin, Meg and Vanessa were chosen to compete.  Shelli picked the \"HouseGuest's Choice\" chip and chose Vanessa, upsetting John, Becky and Steve.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"BB Comics\"):''' The competitors ziplined past a display of 17 comic books designed after the HouseGuests. One at a time, they had to replicate the display in order, but were given two copies of each cover with minor differences between them. The competitor to correctly assemble the display in the fastest time won the Power of Veto. \n\nSteve won the competition.

Vanessa campaigned for votes; while she thought she could count on Steve's vote, he was hesitant and she felt betrayed. Vanessa told James that Becky was the one who fed information from his alliance to Shelli and Clay. Jackie, James and Meg realized that Shelli would be targeting James for sending Clay home, but Vanessa would go after Becky. James' alliance decided to betray Becky and vote against Shelli; Shelli became the seventh HouseGuest evicted from the house, the second unanimously, becoming the first Jury member in the process, blindsiding Becky and her allies. The HouseGuests were told that the night would be a double eviction, with a week's worth of competitions occurring that night, culminating in a second eviction.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Getting Loopy\"):''' The night before the challenge, HouseGuests were shown looping video clips of 16 events from earlier that summer.

The last HouseGuest standing became the new Head of Household. \n\nLiz became the new Head of Household and put her alliance back in power for the first time since Week 5.

The last HouseGuest remaining will win the Power of Veto. \n\nLiz defeated Austin in the final round to win the Power of Veto.

Becky told Julie that should she return, she would work with Vanessa and go after Austin and the twins.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Ready, Set, Whoa\"):''' HouseGuests stood at the end of their own lane and held down three buttons with their hands and one foot. In each round, they had to hold down their buttons until the screens at the end of the lane went through the words \"ready,\" \"set\" and \"go.\" If any HouseGuest released a button before the word \"go,\" they were eliminated. The last HouseGuest to hit their button in each round was also eliminated.

Austin and the twins also thought about keeping Becky and using her to go after Vanessa. In the Head of Household competition, even though he considered throwing it, Austin beat James in the final round to become the new Head of Household. Austin was furious to be the new Head of Household due to having multiple deals with everyone in the game.

Zingbot arrived to heckle the HouseGuests and host the upcoming Veto competition.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Newly Zingle\"):''' HouseGuests competed one at a time. Competitors looked at six of Zingbot's potential lovers on the new \"Zinder\" app. For each face, HouseGuests had to identify which three HouseGuests composed the face. The HouseGuest who identifies all six faces in the fastest amount of time will win the Power of Veto. \n\nVanessa finished in the fastest time and won the Power of Veto, foiling Austin's plan of backdooring her. Steve told Vanessa he was very excited about her Veto win. However, Vanessa knew he was fine with Austin's plan to backdoor her, so at the Veto meeting, Vanessa called Steve out on his bluff and decided to not use the Power of Veto, keeping Austin's nominations intact.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 574\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 29\n| Title = Episode 29\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|27}}\n| Aux1 = Days 68\u201371\n| ShortSummary = All of the HouseGuests were unsure of whom to evict. John hoped to gain James, Meg and Vanessa's votes. However, Vanessa told John she would be voting with the twins, which caused John to work for Liz and Julia's votes instead. Ultimately, John's campaigning was unsuccessful and he became the tenth HouseGuest evicted from the house,  becoming the fourth Jury member. Shortly after, John, along with Shelli, Jackie and Becky, re-entered the House to join the rest of the HouseGuests to have a chance to re-enter the game and possibly become the new Head of Household.\n\n*'''Head of Household/Battle to Return (\"Dizzyland\"):''' The eligible HouseGuests and jurors each stood on a small disc suspended by a hanging rope. As the competition continued, they were spun into hand-shaped punching bags, which caused them to spin more. The last juror standing on their rope re-entered the game, while the last HouseGuest remaining overall became the new Head of Household. \n\nJulia, Steve and Meg quickly fell off before the conclusion of the live show.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 10|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 575\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 30\n| Title = Episode 30\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|30}}\n| Aux1 = Days 71\u201372\n| ShortSummary = John, Shelli and Vanessa were the last competitors remaining. After Shelli fell off, John became a HouseGuest again; Vanessa attempted to make a deal with him, but he declined. Moments later, he fell, making the Vanessa HoH for a third time. \n\nVanessa, with conflicting deals with everyone, knew she had to break a promise at the upcoming nomination ceremony. Hoping to gain information from Meg and James to give her reason to nominate Austin and the twins and not them, she asked them why she should keep them safe and got no information, so at the nomination ceremony, Vanessa nominated Meg and James, with James as the target.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 576\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 31\n| Title = Episode 31\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|09|02}}\n| Aux1 = Days 72\u201375\n| ShortSummary = Now furious with Vanessa for going back on the deal she made in Week 6, James tried to broker a deal with her to keep himself and Meg safe, but all his plan did was irritate Vanessa and make him a bigger target than he already was. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Austin, Julia and Liz were selected, with John and Steve as co-hosts of the competition.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Hide and Go Veto\")''': Individually, HouseGuests entered the House to hide a locked Veto box with their name inside. After everyone hid their boxes, HouseGuests had two minutes to individually search the House for a Veto box. The competition continued until five Veto boxes had been found. The HouseGuest who hides their Veto box the best will win the Power of Veto. \n\nJames hid his Veto box under the living room rug and won the Power of Veto. Now desperately needing a replacement nominee and not wanting to break her secret alliance with John and Steve, Vanessa asked Julia if she would be fine with going up in James' place as a pawn to ensure Meg's eviction and weaken James. Austin and the twins urged Vanessa to nominate and evict John, unaware of her secret alliance with him. At the Veto Meeting, James used the Veto on himself and Vanessa nominated Julia in his place.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 577\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 32\n| Title = Episode 32\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|09|03}}\n| Aux1 = Days 75\u201378\n| ShortSummary = James and Meg attempted to rally Steve and John onto their side to vote Julia out, unaware that they were secretly working with Vanessa.

At the live eviction ceremony, Steve and John ultimately decided to keep Julia and Meg was evicted by a vote of 4-1, with James voting to evict Julia.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"BB Road Trip\")''': The HouseGuests were presented with two images depicting the six pre-jury members on a tour around the world. They were then asked questions about the shown images and had to respond with either 'True' or 'False.' If an incorrect answer is given, that HouseGuest is eliminated from the competition. The last HouseGuest remaining is the new Head of Household. \n\nThe final round came down to the twins, with Liz outlasting Julia and becoming a two-time HoH. Immediately after, Liz nominated James and John for eviction, citing that she had previous loyalties in the house to others. In the random draw for veto players, all of the HouseGuests competed except Vanessa were chosen to compete.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Boomerang\")''': The HouseGuests rolled two balls onto a boomerang-shaped block, with slots on the other side of the block that are designated with specific point values. The HouseGuest whose balls roll into slots that produce the greatest sum is awarded the Power of Veto. \n\nJulia won the Power of Veto and chose not to use it, keeping her sister's nominations intact.

In order to do so, it was imperative for one of them to win the upcoming Head of Household competition.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Starting Lineup\")''': In each round, HouseGuests were shown a rapid series of 16 baseball cards depicting the HouseGuests. Once they figured out which HouseGuest was excluded from the lineup, they had to take their puzzle pieces, build their face, and hit their button. The last HouseGuest to assemble their puzzle in each round was eliminated. The last HouseGuest standing will be the new Head of Household with a guaranteed spot in the final five.\n\nSteve defeated John in the final round to become a two-time HoH after John threw the competition. Now in power, John, Steve and Vanessa debated about which Austwin to leave off of the block to ensure all three of them would be safe. They also needed to decide which Austwin would be easiest to beat in the final four to ensure they make the final three. Ultimately, they decided to leave Julia off the block and at the nomination ceremony, Steve nominated Austin and Liz, with Austin as the target and Julia as a backdoor option.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 579\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 34\n| Title = Episode 34\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|09|09}}\n| Aux1 = Days 79\u201382\n| ShortSummary = With only six HouseGuests remaining, John, Steve and Vanessa needed to prevent Julia from winning the Power of Veto to keep their final three deal intact, while Austin and the twins knew in order to save them, Julia needed to win the Power of Veto to keep all three of them safe and force Steve to put up either John or Vanessa in Liz's place. Seasons 10 & 11 Jessie Godderz surprised the HouseGuests to host the Power of Veto competition.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Bowlerina\")''': Jessie drew names out of a box to determine the order. In each round, two HouseGuests went head-to-head. HouseGuests had to hold onto a handle above their heads and spin 30 times to lower the gate at the end of their bowling lane for 30 seconds. This gave the HouseGuests the opportunity to bowl down their pins. The first HouseGuest to knock down their four pins in each round moved on and eliminated their opponent. The last HouseGuest standing will win the Power of Veto. \n\nDuring the competition, Vanessa manipulated Julia to compete against Austin to ensure Julia would not win the Power of Veto. It worked, as Austin eventually beat John in the final round to win the Power of Veto. At the Veto Meeting, Austin used the Veto on himself and Steve nominated Julia in his place.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 580\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 35\n| Title = Episode 35\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|09|10}}\n| Aux1 = Days 82\u201385\n| ShortSummary = Knowing that they would be split up, just like Clay and Shelli in Week 6, Liz and Julia spent their final moments together. The twins asked for Julia to be evicted, knowing that Liz would fare better in future competitions. However, John and Vanessa considered evicting Liz due to her being the tie between Austin and Julia, and due to the fact that she is better in competitions. However, at the live eviction, John and Vanessa honored the twins' wishes and Julia was evicted from the house by a 3-0 vote.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Under the Rainbow\")''': Each HouseGuest has their own lane with a curved section of chicken wire. HouseGuests must maneuver their eggs on top of the chicken wire and over the rainbow into ten slots. The HouseGuests also had a slot off to the side for a prize.

Liz won the trip outside the house and was able to take another houseguest with her; she chose Vanessa and the two went to an [[Ariana Grande]] concert with her brother, [[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|season 16]] alumni [[Frankie Grande]]. Again, with conflicting deals with everyone, Vanessa knew she had to break a promise at the upcoming nomination ceremony. Hoping to gain information from Steve to give her reason to put Austin and Liz back on the block, Vanessa asked him why she should keep him and got no information, so at the nomination ceremony, she nominated John and Steve, with John as the target.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 582\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 37\n| Title = Episode 37\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|09|15}}\n| Aux1 = Days 86\u201389\n| ShortSummary = Vanessa decided to work both sides of the house, this time with Austin and Liz, to win the Veto and ensure John's re-eviction.

Each HouseGuest had their own lane with a balance beam, a timer with a button, and a magnetic puzzle board. HouseGuests had to hit their button to magnetize their puzzle board for twenty seconds. They then had to walk across the beam to start working on their puzzle. Running out of time or falling off of the beam resulted in the puzzle board being demagnetized, forcing them to start their puzzle from scratch. After a board demagnetizes, that HouseGuest only has ten seconds to remagnetize their board or they will be eliminated from the competition. The first HouseGuest to complete their puzzle and hit their button will win the Power of Veto. \n\nVanessa was quickly eliminated after her board demagnetized and her time ran out. John had a strategy to build his puzzle in his tray instead of on the board, allowing him to walk on the grass as he pleased, then once he had his pieces situated, he could place them on the board correctly. His strategy proved effective and John won the Power of Veto for the fourth time. At the Veto Meeting, John used the Veto on himself and Vanessa nominated Austin in his place. At the live eviction ceremony, after John cast his vote to evict Austin and Liz cast hers to evict Steve, Vanessa cast the tie-breaking vote to send Austin to the jury and he became the fourteenth HouseGuest evicted from the house, becoming the seventh jury member.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"What the Bleep?!\")''': HouseGuests were shown a clip with a censored word(s). Julie then gave them a word that the censored word(s) could be. HouseGuests then had to decide if Julie's statement was true or false.

At the final nomination ceremony of the summer, Steve nominated John and Vanessa for eviction. Caleb Reynolds from last season entered the House to host the final Veto competition of the summer.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Martial Smarts\")''': In each round, Caleb asked the HouseGuests on what day a certain event occurred. The HouseGuests then had to hit their karate partner, either a hand punch for one day, or a shin kick for 5 days, to display the correct day on their counter. If a HouseGuest buzzed in with an incorrect answer, their counter would drop to zero and would have to try again. The last HouseGuest to answer correctly in each round got one strike against them. Two strikes resulted in elimination from the competition. The last HouseGuest standing will win the final Power of Veto of the summer.\n\nThe competition came down to Vanessa and John, both with both strikes remaining. Vanessa won the last two rounds to win the Power of Veto. Liz campaigned to Vanessa, stating if she kept her, she would take her to the final two.

This also meant the HoH who nominated them was dethroned, and subsequently eligible for post-veto nomination.\n*{{note|2|Note 2}}: Identical twins Liz and Julia took turns playing as a single HouseGuest during the first five weeks, secretly trading places every few days between living inside the house and being in sequester. Both twins pretended to be Liz until they completed this task. Following the Week 5 eviction, Julia was allowed to enter the house under her own identity and both twins were allowed to play for themselves.\n*{{note|3|Note 3}}: {{anchor|BB Fast Forward}}{{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} For volunteering to sit out of the Week 1 Head of Household competitions, Da'Vonne and Vanessa were awarded the BB Fast Forward, which gave them immunity for the week. They were instructed to share the Fast Forward with another HouseGuest each; they chose Liz and Austin. \n*{{note|4|Note 4}}: {{anchor|Last Laugh}}{{Color box|#ccc|border=darkgray}} A telephone appeared in the House; for being the HouseGuest who answered the seventh call, Da'Vonne was awarded the Last Laugh, which allowed her to block three HouseGuests from voting in this week's eviction; she chose Becky, Jackie, and Jeff.\n*{{note|5|Note 5}}: Audrey was given a penalty vote for eviction after eating normal food while on the mandatory Have-Not slop diet.\n*{{note|6|Note 6}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following the first eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games \u2014 including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n*{{note|7|Note 7}}: During the Head of Household competition in Week 10, the first four jurors \u2014 Shelli, Jackie, Becky, and John \u2014 competed for an opportunity to come back into the game. The juror who lasted the longest would return to the game to win and was eligible to become Head of Household if that juror finished first amongst the other HouseGuests in the competition. John lasted the longest of the jury members and re-entered the house.\n*{{note|8|Note 8}}: As Head of Household, Vanessa was forced to break the tie on Day 89.\n*{{note|9|Note 9}}: During the finale, the jury members voted for which finalist should win Big Brother.\n</small>\n<!--</div>-->\n\n==Reception==\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\n\n===Viewing figures===\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | #\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Air Date\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"unsortable\" | United States\n! rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Source\n|-\n! 18\u201349<br />(rating/share)\n!

The series would continue to be hosted by [[Julie Chen]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Big Brother Renewed: Two More Seasons To Look Forward To |url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/news/1003191/big-brother-renewed-two-more-seasons-to-look-forward-to/|website=CBS}}</ref>\n\nOn June 15, 2015, CBS released pictures of the house via ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'', which has a modern steel beach house theme. The upstairs is 155 square feet larger than in previous seasons, the result of the incorporation of a glass bridge added in by ''Big Brother'' house designer Scott Storey.<ref name=\"Big Brother House\">{{cite web|last1=Boyer|first1=Matthew|title=Big Brother 17 House Revealed \u2013 Update: More Pics & Video Added|url=http://bigbrothernetwork.com/big-brother-17-house-revealed/|website=Big Brother Network|accessdate=June 16, 2015|date=June 15, 2015}}</ref> Season 17 is the first season for which the live feeds were bundled with CBS All Access, an [[over-the-top content|over-the-top]] streaming service launched by CBS in January 2015 that allows users to view past and present episodes of CBS shows, and includes the live feeds and special ''Big Brother'' content.<ref>{{cite web|title=Big Brother All Access|url=https://www.cbs.com/all-access/account/|website=CBS All Access|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}</ref>\n\nWhile the aired episodes had transitioned to HD the previous season, BB17 was the first season in which the live internet feeds were broadcast in HD. \n\n===Format===\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\nThe format has changed slightly from previous seasons. The contestants, referred to as \"HouseGuests,\" are sequestered in the Big Brother House with no contact to or from the outside world. Each week, the HouseGuests take part in several compulsory challenges that determine who will win food, luxuries and power in the house.\n\nAt the start of each week, the HouseGuests compete in the Head of Household (HoH) competition. The winner of the HoH competition will select two HouseGuests to be nominated for eviction. As with [[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|the previous season]], the first five weeks of the season feature two concurrent Heads of Household. Each HoH would nominate two other HouseGuests for eviction, totaling four nominees. The two pairs of nominees would then compete in the \"Battle of the Block\" competition. The winning pair would be removed from the block, with the HoH who nominated them dethroned. The dethroned HoH would later be eligible to be nominated as a replacement if the Veto was used, while the Battle of the Block winners are safe for the rest of the week. The rest of the cycle would continue as per usual, with the remaining HoH retaining immunity for the week, and the two nominees being eligible for safety through the Power of Veto. The reigning (or sole) HoH also earns the right to name the \"Have Nots\" for the week, forcing the chosen HouseGuests to eat solely \"Big Brother slop\" and a weekly food selection chosen by producers, take cold showers, and sleep in a bedroom designed to look like a dental clinic.\n\nEach week, six HouseGuests are selected to compete in the Power of Veto (PoV) competition: the reigning HoH, their two nominees, and three HouseGuests selected by random draw. The winner of the PoV competition wins the right to either revoke the nomination of one of the nominated HouseGuests or leave them as is; if the veto winner uses this power, the HoH must immediately nominate another HouseGuest for eviction. The PoV winner is also immune from being named as the replacement nominee. The HouseGuest overthrown as a result of the Battle of the Block competition is eligible to be nominated by the reigning Head of Household if the Power of Veto is used.\n\nOn eviction night, all HouseGuests vote to evict one of the two nominees, with the exception of the nominees and the Head of Household, who is only allowed to vote in the event of a tie, and in that case, must do so publicly. This compulsory vote is conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room. Unlike most other versions of Big Brother, the HouseGuests may openly and freely discuss the nomination and eviction process. The nominee with the majority of votes will be evicted from the house on the weekly live broadcast, exiting to an adjacent studio to be interviewed by Chen, after which the cycle begins again.\n\nHouseGuests may voluntarily leave the house at any time and those who break the rules may be expelled from the house. The last nine evicted HouseGuests will form the Big Brother jury, and vote for the winner during the season finale. The jury members will be sequestered in a separate house and will not be allowed to watch the show except for competitions and ceremonies that include all of the remaining HouseGuests; the jury members will not be shown any Diary Room interviews or any footage that may include strategy or details regarding nominations.\n\n===Twists===\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\n\n====BB Takeover====\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\nCBS announced the season's twist, BB Takeover, on June 17, 2015, in which a surprise guest was to visit the house each week to reveal a different twist to the HouseGuests.<ref name=\"BB Takeover\">{{cite web|title='Big Brother' Announces this Season's New Twist, 'BB Takeover,' Featuring Weekly Surprise Guests Who Will Shake Up the House Each and Every Week|url=http://www.cbspressexpress.com/cbs-entertainment/releases/view?id=42928|website=CBS Press Express|accessdate=June 17, 2015|date=June 17, 2015}}</ref> Though it was initially announced that there would be a guest every week, there were no Takeovers after Week 3; in an interview during the season, host Julie Chen stated that the twist had been cancelled because \"there was enough going on\u201d with the other elements of the game, though no official announcement was ever made to the HouseGuests.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why the Big Brother twist BB Takeover disappeared|url=http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/2015/08/bb17-bb-takeover-what-happened-julie-chen/|website=Reality Blurred|first=Andy|last=Dehnart|accessdate=August 11, 2015|date=August 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%\"|Week\n! style=\"width:15%\"|Takeover guest\n! style=\"width:20%\"|Twist\n! style=\"width:60%\"|Effect\n|-\n! rowspan=2|1\n| rowspan=2|[[Phil Keoghan]]\n| Two additional HouseGuests\n| ''[[The Amazing Race 26]]'' alumni Jackie and Jeff entered the game.\n|-\n| [[#BB Fast Forward|BB Fast Forward]]\n| Immunity for the week was granted to the two HouseGuests who sat out of the first HoH competitions and one HouseGuest of their choice each.\n|-\n! 2\n| [[Kathy Griffin]]\n| [[#Last Laugh|The Last Laugh]]\n| The power to block three HouseGuests from voting in the next eviction was granted to the HouseGuest who answered the seventh call to a phone booth in the house.\n|-\n! rowspan=2|3\n| rowspan=2|[[Rob Gronkowski]]\n| Gronk Party Week\n| Have-Nots were removed for the week, provided the HouseGuests participated in Gronk Parties throughout.\n|-\n| Luxury competition \n| All of the week's competition winners earned a chance to win a cabin on a three-day cruise.\n|}\n\n====Battle of the Block====\nThe Battle of the block was first introduced in [[Big Brother 16 (American season)|the sixteenth season]].

During introductions, both Clay and Da'Vonne withheld their professions as a former football player and poker dealer, respectively, while Audrey revealed that she is a [[trans woman]], which received a universally positive reaction from her fellow HouseGuests. A mutual attraction began to form between Clay and Shelli, as did an early alliance between Audrey, Da'Vonne, and Shelli. Julie Chen revealed the return of the [[Big Brother 17 (U.S.)#Battle of the Block|Battle of the Block]] twist and announced the first Head of Household competition. First, the HouseGuests were told that one of them would have to sit out of the competition; Da'Vonne volunteered in exchange for none of the others nominating her, to which they all agreed.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Flying Tomatoes\"):''' The HouseGuests, standing on movable perches, were pelted with plastic tomatoes; as HouseGuests fell off, they were eliminated. The first HouseGuest to catch ten tomatoes or the last one remaining on the perch, whichever occurred first, became the first Head of Household.\n\nAudrey, Jace, James, and Shelli were the final four competitors remaining, but all fell off at the same time; upon review of the footage, James was determined to have fallen off last, so he was named the first Head of Household. The HouseGuests were told about the [[Big Brother 17 (U.S.)#BB Takeover|BB Takeover]], in which a new twist would be introduced every week. Addressing the viewing public, Julie revealed the final twist, which would be kept secret from the HouseGuests. Known as the [[Big Brother 17 (U.S.)#Twin Twist|Twin Twist]], a pair of identical twins would be taking turns competing as one, earning the right to play as individuals, provided they survive the first five evictions.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 547\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n| Title = Episode 2\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|06|25}}\n| Aux1 = Day 1\n| ShortSummary = Six more new HouseGuests\u2014Becky, Jason, John, Liz, Steve, and Vanessa\u2014entered the Big Brother house. As the 14 HouseGuests met each other, Vanessa withheld her profession as a poker player, while Jace noticed that there were two empty seats at the dinner table. For the first BB Takeover, ''[[The Amazing Race]]'' host [[Phil Keoghan]] introduced two new HouseGuests: ''[[The Amazing Race 26]]'' alumni Jackie and Jeff. As with the first group, one of the six new HouseGuests was instructed to sit out of the other Head of Household competition; Vanessa volunteered and the HouseGuests agreed not to nominate her as they did with Da'Vonne earlier.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"UFOh No\"):''' The seven HouseGuests held onto a pole while a harness pulled them upward. The last HouseGuest left hanging onto their pole became the second Head of Household.\n\nWhen only Jackie and Jason remained, Jason promised her that he wouldn't nominate her if she dropped out of the competition; she did, and Jason won.

Former ''Amazing Race'' partners Jackie and Jeff decided to keep their distance from each other to decrease their targets and be perceived as individuals. Phil returned and granted Da'Vonne and Vanessa the BB Fast Forward, which granted them immunity for the week, along with immunity for one HouseGuest each of their choice. Vanessa held court to help her with her decision and settled on Austin. Da'Vonne decided not to protect her allies Audrey and Shelli in order to hide their alliance and picked Liz instead. Da'Vonne's decision angered Shelli, and she later flirted with Clay, which made Da'Vonne question her loyalty. Austin and Jace bonded and later formed an alliance called ShellTown, but Jace's brash remarks and physique made him a target to several HouseGuests, including Jason. James and Jason teamed up with Audrey and Da'Vonne to backdoor Jace and tried to recruit other HouseGuests to be nominated as pawns. Jason nominated Becky and John while James nominated Jackie and Steve.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"DuBoB\"):''' The pairs navigated a series of balance beams to transport blocks to a platform and used them to build a tower according to a blueprint.

Jace decided to [[streaking|streak]], which further annoyed the other HouseGuests, including his closest ally, Austin. To save themselves, Austin and Jace formed an alliance with Audrey and James, who had no intention of deviating from their initial plan to take out Jace. While preparing for a possible future counting competition, Da'Vonne wandered into all the rooms, alarming Clay, Jeff, and Shelli, which led to both factions plotting against each other. Jeff and Clay's attempts to address the situation led to further confrontations, and Audrey later tried to get Clay and Da'Vonne to make up, to no avail. Audrey and Da'Vonne independently considered betraying each other\u2014Audrey for Da'Vonne's attitude and Da'Vonne for Audrey's constant meddling. James had to choose four Have-Nots; he picked the four HouseGuests protected by the BB Fast Forward\u2014Austin, Da'Vonne, Liz, and Vanessa. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, John, Jason, and Becky were selected to compete.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Nose-a Scotia\"):''' The six competitors dug for pieces with a letter on them; each letter had an assigned point value. The HouseGuest who made the correctly-spelled word that was worth the most points won the Power of Veto.\n\nSteve won the Power of Veto with the word \"trombonists.\" Audrey decided to bring Jeff and Shelli into her main alliance, but her incessant strategizing in the middle of the night alienated her allies, making James consider putting her up as the replacement nominee. However, at the Veto Meeting, Steve used the Power of Veto on himself, and James followed through on his original plan and nominated Jace.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 550\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n| Title = Episode 5\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|02}}\n| Aux1 = Days 10\u201315\n| ShortSummary = After his nomination, an agitated Jace attempted to rally support, to no avail. Audrey told Jace that she had no part in his nomination but later told him that the whole house was involved; he saw through her lies and later threatened to expose her manipulations. Host Julie Chen revealed that Liz and her twin sister, Julia, were competing as one in the Twin Twist and would switch places again while casting a vote that night. During the live eviction, everyone except Audrey voted against Jace, and he became the first HouseGuest to be evicted from the house. Actress and comedian [[Kathy Griffin]] arrived for the season's second takeover and revealed to the viewing public that there would be a telephone booth in the house, ringing periodically. The HouseGuest who answered the seventh call would earn the right to stop three HouseGuests from voting in the next eviction.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Ginger Fever\"):''' Divided into two groups of seven by random draw, the HouseGuests raced to assemble a puzzle. The first HouseGuest in each round that assembled their puzzle became the new Heads of Household.\n\nBecky and Shelli won their respective rounds and became the new Heads of Household.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 2|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 551\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 6\n| Title = Episode 6\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|05}}\n| Aux1 = Days 13\u201316\n| ShortSummary = Two days before Jace's eviction, Audrey told her alliance that Vanessa was the leader of an opposing, all-girls alliance and then told Vanessa that Da'Vonne had started that rumor. After Vanessa tried to talk things out with Da'Vonne, Da'Vonne realized that Audrey had been lying and called an alliance meeting; after Audrey refused to own up to her machinations, she was exiled from her alliance.\n\nWith Becky and Shelli as the Heads of Household, the HouseGuests scrambled to ensure their safety, except for Audrey, who decided to lay low to reduce her target. Becky proposed backdooring Audrey; while Shelli initially agreed, she later conspired with Clay and Jeff to target Da'Vonne after their altercation the previous week. The trio recruited John to be nominated as a pawn and told him to throw the Battle of the Block competition while pledging that they would do whatever they could to ensure his safety. Shelli nominated Da'Vonne and John while Becky, still hoping to backdoor Audrey, nominated Jason\u2014as payback for him putting her up the previous week\u2014and Steve.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"Give Me Props\"):''' The pairs, conjoined by a single shirt and a three-legged pair of pants, operated nine cameras and repositioned them to follow a shot list; the cameras corresponded to a specific shot but were unlabeled. The first pair that correctly lined up all nine cameras earned safety for the week and dethroned the Head of Household who nominated them.\n\nJason and Steve only operated two cameras at a time, which proved to be an effective strategy. Meanwhile, Da'Vonne's idea to turn on all nine cameras at once put her and John at a disadvantage, and he didn't even need to actively try to throw the competition. Jason and Steve handily won the competition, dethroning Becky and keeping Shelli in power and putting the plan to backdoor Audrey in jeopardy.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 552\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n| Title = Episode 7\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|08}}\n| Aux1 = Days 16\u201319\n| ShortSummary = While a dethroned Becky was convinced that the plan to backdoor Audrey was still on the agenda, Shelli continued to plot Da'Vonne's eviction. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Meg, Steve, and Clay were drawn to join Shelli, Da'Vonne, and John.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"High Maintenance\"):''' Two competitors would be given a list of seven items and then shown an image with six of those items. The first competitor to press their buzzer after retrieving the missing item from an adjacent room would win the round, and the other competitor would be eliminated from the competition. If the first player to press their buzzer brought back a wrong item, they would be eliminated. The winner would then choose one of the remaining competitors to play in the next round who in turn would choose their opponent. The last competitor remaining won the Power of Veto.\n\nIn the final round, John beat Clay to win the Power of Veto, which forced Shelli to find a replacement nominee. After unsuccessfully trying to get John to not use the Veto on himself, Shelli considered nominating Liz. Liz's allies Austin and Vanessa tried to get Shelli to put Meg up instead, telling Shelli that Meg was going to work with Da'Vonne, James, and Jason to save Da'Vonne and target Clay and Shelli and that the only way to ensure Da'Vonne's eviction was to nominate Meg as a pawn. Audrey later reprimanded Clay for being condescending, which prompted Clay to convince Shelli to nominate Audrey instead. However, at the Veto Meeting, after John used the Power of Veto on himself, Shelli decided to listen to Austin and Vanessa and nominated Meg.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 553\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 8\n| Title = Episode 8\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|09}}\n| Aux1 = Days 19\u201322\n| ShortSummary = A telephone booth appeared in the house for Kathy's BB Takeover, and she told the HouseGuests about the Last Laugh twist. Da'Vonne answered the seventh call and earned the power to stop three of the HouseGuests from voting in the upcoming eviction, which meant that she only needed five votes to survive the eviction. Da'Vonne and Jason suspected that Liz had been playing with a twin and alerted the other HouseGuests. Da'Vonne tried to use this information as leverage to secure Liz's vote. At the live eviction, Da'Vonne used the power of the Last Laugh to stop Becky, Jackie, and Jeff from voting, but it didn't matter, as she was evicted anyway after everyone except Audrey and Jason voted against her, and she became the second HouseGuest to be evicted from the house. [[New England Patriots]] [[tight end]] [[Rob Gronkowski]] kicked off his BB Takeover, Gronk's Party Week, by announcing that there would be no Have-Nots that week.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Gronk Pong\"):''' One at a time, each HouseGuest launched a ball toward 55 oversized cups arranged in the shape of a triangle. Each cup had its own unique point value; the two HouseGuests with the highest scores became the new Heads of Household.\n\nAustin became the first new Head of Household while James, Liz, and Vanessa tied for second; Vanessa won the tiebreaker and became the second new Head of Household.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 3|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 554\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n| Title = Episode 9\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|12}}\n| Aux1 = Days 21\u201323\n| ShortSummary = The night before Da'Vonne's eviction, Vanessa confronted Liz, not knowing it was actually Julia, about the rumors of her being a twin, which Julia confessed to, and Vanessa brought in Austin, Clay, and Shelli to protect the twins and ensure that they make it past the first five evictions in order to increase their numbers. The next night, \nJulia and Liz switched again, and Liz joined her new allies in officially forming the Sixth Sense alliance. Allies and new Heads of Household Austin and Vanessa planned to target Jeff and James as the strongest members of the opposing alliance with James as the upfront target and Jeff to be potentially backdoored. Austin and Vanessa planned for Vanessa to remain Head of Household after the Battle of the Block to allow her to improve her social connections. Austin nominated Jason and Meg, Jeff and James's allies, while Vanessa nominated James and John, who again had been recruited to throw the Battle of the Block competition in exchange for future protection. To remove suspicion, Austin told his nominees that Audrey, not Jeff, was the backdoor target.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"Gronk's A-maze-ing Foam Party\"):''' One at a time, a competitor searched through a pile of clothing for a patterned item and then waded through a foam maze to deliver it to the person wearing that pattern. After bringing the person to the starting platform, the player then switched out with their partner. The first pair that brought ten people out of the maze earned safety for the week and dethroned the Head of Household who nominated them.\n\nFor the second week in a row, John had no need to throw the competition, as James was confused by the patterns.

Audrey, Austin, and Shelli were randomly chosen to compete in the Veto competition. In order to justify not nominating her as a replacement if the Veto was used, Vanessa conspired with the Sixth Sense to throw the competition to Audrey.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Gronk and Roll\"):''' Two players in giant six-sided [[dice]] went head-to-head. A number between one and six would be randomly selected, and the two competitors maneuvered around the playing field attempting to return to their starting platform with the correct number on top. The first to do so stayed in the competition, eliminating their opponent. After five rounds, the last competitor remaining won the Power of Veto.\n\nThe plot to throw the competition to Audrey was foiled after she was defeated by John, and he went on to defeat Austin in the final round to earn his second consecutive Veto. Vanessa, now needing to find a replacement nominee, accused Austin of throwing the final round to John. As part of Rob Gronkowski's BB Takeover, he mandated that all HouseGuests participate in parties; any non-participating HouseGuests would become Have-Nots. All of the HouseGuests participated. Jeff talked to Vanessa to ensure his safety and realized that she had no intention of nominating Audrey. Jason then alerted Jeff to the fact that Austin and Vanessa were working together, which Jeff told Clay, unaware that Clay was also working with them. Austin decided to call Jeff out for talking against him, and Jeff's resulting confrontation with Vanessa provided enough reason for her to nominate him.\n\n*'''Luxury Competition:''' The week's competition winners\u2014Austin, Vanessa, Jason, Meg, and John\u2014picked a cup at random; one of the cups had a chip at the bottom that would earn its owner a cabin on a three-day cruise with Rob.\n\nMeg won the Luxury Competition.

Liz returned to the house, much to the delight of Austin, who had been developing feelings for her. Jeff, during his campaign, told Liz that he knew about the Twin Twist, and she decided to flirt with him in order to control him. Austin walked in on the two lying in bed together under the covers, which made him angry and jealous. Jeff's campaigning ultimately earned him votes from Jackie, John, Liz, and Steve, but it wasn't enough, as he became the third HouseGuest to be evicted from the house after the other seven voters voted against him.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Bustin' Moves\"):''' The HouseGuests were asked true or false questions based on a 1990s-inspired dance routine they had just watched; HouseGuests who answered incorrectly were eliminated. The last two HouseGuests remaining became the new Heads of Household.\n\nAfter just three questions, Liz and Shelli became the new Heads of Household.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 4|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 557\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 12\n| Title = Episode 12\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|19}}\n| Aux1 = Days 29\u201330\n| ShortSummary = After it was revealed that four people voted to save Jeff, members of the Sixth Sense tried to figure out who the four were, unaware that one was among them\u2014Liz. With Liz as one of the new Heads of Household, HouseGuests suspicious about her being a twin\u2014especially John\u2014scoured her new bedroom for clues. Jackie, now without any allies thanks to Jeff's eviction, was approached by Austin in order to potentially work with her later and told her that she was likely to be nominated by Liz. After Jackie discussed her impending nomination with Shelli, Shelli considered severing ties with the volatile Austin. Audrey told Shelli that Jason was coming after her; deciding to target him, Shelli and Clay recruited John to be a pawn, this time to ensure that Jason went home. Liz nominated Jackie and James while Shelli nominated Jason and John. After Liz assured Jackie that she was safe, Jackie asked Liz who the real target was, which angered Liz. Shelli told Jason that Audrey had told her that he was targeting her, which Jason denied. After Audrey told Shelli that it was a lie, Shelli considered nominating her if the Power of Veto was used.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"[[Grunge (music)|Grunge]] BoB\"):''' The pairs dove through [[mudhoney]] to get to four zones themed after grunge bands from the 1990s\u2014[[Pearl Jam]], [[Screaming Trees]], [[Soundgarden]], and [[Smashing Pumpkins]]\u2014to find one key in each. They then used the four keys to unlock a mannequin, [[Alice in Chains|Alice]], tied up in chains. The first pair that unchained Alice and took her to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], the finish platform, won the competition.\n\nThough Jason and John had an early lead, they fell behind in the pumpkin smashing zone, which allowed Jackie and James to come from behind to win the competition, dethroning Liz and keeping Shelli in power and putting the plan to backdoor Audrey in jeopardy again. As punishment for losing the competition or being dethroned, Jason, John, and Liz were forced to dress up as a [[boy band]] and dance together at routine intervals.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 558\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 13\n| Title = Episode 13\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|22}}\n| Aux1 = Days 30\u201333\n| ShortSummary = Audrey, having exposed her manipulations to Shelli, vented her frustration to James and urged him to target Shelli and Clay if he ever became Head of Household; he subsequently ratted her out. Clay later discussed it with Audrey while trying to dissuade her paranoia regarding being backdoored. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, James, Meg, and Vanessa were chosen to compete. After Audrey wasn't chosen to compete for the Veto, all of those chosen plotted to use it on John so that Shelli could nominate Audrey as the replacement, though Shelli was later distraught regarding her impending decision.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Saved by the Smell\"):''' In each round, the six competitors were given a list of chemicals and then instructed to pour a specific chemical based on a question about the list. If a competitor was incorrect, they would be eliminated and splattered with paint; the last competitor remaining won the Power of Veto.\n\nIn the fifth round, Vanessa beat Jason and John to win the competition. After Audrey complained about her loneliness in the game to Clay, he berated her for not trusting their alliance, which quickly escalated into an argument after Audrey denied asking Clay if Shelli was going to backdoor her, leading to subsequent altercations with Shelli and Vanessa. After the confrontations, Audrey secluded herself from the other HouseGuests and didn't even attend the Veto Meeting, although it didn't matter because Vanessa used the Power of Veto on Jason, and Shelli nominated Audrey in his place.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 559\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 14\n| Title = Episode 14\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|23}}\n| Aux1 = Days 33\u201336\n| ShortSummary = After spending five hours in the Diary Room before the Veto Meeting, Audrey retreated to the Have-Not room, prompting the other HouseGuests to wonder if she would quit the game. Ultimately, Audrey remained in the game until eviction night when she became the fourth HouseGuest to be evicted after everyone except Austin voted against her, and she received a penalty vote for breaking the Have-Not rule by eating regular food.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Pop Till You Drop\"):''' Two HouseGuests, competing head-to-head, listened to a 1990s pop song about a past competition. The first to buzz in with the correct competition type (\"Head of Household,\" \"Battle of the Block,\" or \"Power of Veto\") won the round, and the other HouseGuest was eliminated. If the first player to buzz in was wrong, they were eliminated and the other HouseGuest would choose the next match-up.

Jason, along with Meg, told Shelli and Vanessa, both of whom continued to lose trust in Austin. After the eviction and the Head of Household competition, Austin lied to Vanessa about his conversation with Jason, and she conspired with Clay, Shelli, and Jackie to betray him. Jackie and Vanessa decided to work together to backdoor Austin and to ensure that Jackie became the surviving Head of Household as Vanessa had already been the surviving Head of Household once before. Vanessa nominated Becky and a volunteering Clay with the hope that they would win and be safe while Jackie nominated Liz and James, who had been recruited to throw the Battle of the Block. An alliance of Vanessa, Jackie, Shelli, Clay, Jason, James, Becky, and Meg called Dark Moon was formed with the idea of them being the final eight HouseGuests.\n\n*'''Battle of the Block (\"Splashy Headlines\"):''' The pairs threw paint around a room to reveal letters that spelled the names of three ''[[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|Big Brother 16]]'' HouseGuests. The first pair to correctly identify the three names earned safety for the week, and they, plus the surviving Head of Household, won a private [[Outback Steakhouse]] dinner.\n\nThe plan to backdoor Austin was put in jeopardy when Liz was able to win the Battle of the Block all by herself, securing immunity for the week for herself and James and all but ensuring Julia's entry into the game after the upcoming eviction.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 561\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 16\n| Title = Episode 16\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|29}}\n| Aux1 = Days 37\u201340\n| ShortSummary = Though the initial plan to backdoor Austin was foiled after James and Liz won the Battle of the Block, Vanessa assured the now-dethroned Jackie that she was still committed to backdooring Austin. Austin's attraction to Liz developed; though she enjoyed her time with him, she privately admitted that she didn't return his affections, though he was unaware and kissed her anyway. Shelli, Liz, and John were drawn to join Vanessa, Becky, and Clay in the Power of Veto competition.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Get Nutty\"):''' The competitors rolled a plastic acorn back and forth on a ramp; the first competitor to roll it 250 times in a row without dropping it won the Power of Veto.\n\nClay won the Power of Veto, setting the plan to backdoor Austin in motion. Vanessa first told Liz about it and then decided to confront Austin about what he had said to Jason. When Austin relayed his heated conversation with Vanessa to Clay and Shelli, they realized that they needed to keep him in the game as, despite his volatility, he was loyal to them. Clay and Shelli attempted to convince Vanessa to change the plan, and Vanessa proposed getting rid of Jason, the smartest player outside of the Sixth Sense. At the Veto Meeting, Clay used the Power of Veto on himself, and Vanessa nominated Jason in his place.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 562\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 17\n| Title = Episode 17\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|07|30}}\n| Aux1 = Days 40\u201343\n| ShortSummary = After Jason's nomination, the members of Dark Moon not in the Sixth Sense\u2014Becky, Jackie, James, Jason, and Meg\u2014felt betrayed by Vanessa and discussed it with Clay and Shelli. Though Clay and Shelli remained adamant about not knowing about Jason's nomination, Jason realized that they had known, and their refusal to own up to it worried Vanessa, who had to shoulder the entire blame for the plan. The alliance of Jackie, James, Jason, and Meg campaigned for Jason's safety, but it wasn't enough as he became the fifth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house after only James and Meg voted to keep him. Having survived five evictions, Liz and Julia earned the right to compete as individuals, and Julia officially entered the game as a HouseGuest. Julie Chen then announced that the Battle of the Block twist was officially finished.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"On the Edge\"):''' The HouseGuests stood on a perch against a movable wall; the last HouseGuest remaining became the first solo Head of Household.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 6|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 563\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 18\n| Title = Episode 18\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|02}}\n| Aux1 = Days 43\u201344\n| ShortSummary = After close to two hours, only James, John, and Shelli remained in the competition. Shelli, not wanting to be Head of Household for a third time, proposed a deal to John and James for her and Clay's safety for the week. James agreed to keep them and John safe, and John and Shelli dropped off to make James the sole Head of Household, taking the Sixth Sense out of power for the first time since Week 1. Now in the house together, Julia and Liz discussed Austin telling Jason that he would target Julia; though Liz believed that Austin was trustworthy and that Jason had been lying, Julia was firmly against Austin. Finally in control, Jackie, James, and Meg decided to target Clay and Shelli for betraying them the previous week and debated putting them both up directly or backdooring Shelli. They discussed it with Becky who, unbeknownst to them, relayed James's plan back to Clay and Shelli. Clay and Shelli tried to convince James to honor their deal and target Austin instead. Vanessa, knowing full well that she was responsible for sending two of James's closest allies home in Jeff and Jason in Week 3 and Week 5, respectively, offered James and one other person of his choice safety until the final seven, provided he didn't nominate her. James took Vanessa up on her deal and avenged Jason's blindside by nominating Clay and Shelli, breaking his deal with them that he had made earlier. Shelli called James out for betraying them and continued to claim that they had nothing to do with Jason's nomination, which further alienated Vanessa.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 564\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 19\n| Title = Episode 19\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|05}}\n| Aux1 = Days 44\u201347\n| ShortSummary = Clay and Shelli lamented being on the block with each other. Clay yelled at James for breaking their deal and told Shelli that he was ready to sacrifice himself to keep her, the bigger threat to win, in the game. Vanessa, upset that Clay and Shelli were refusing to own up to their roles in Jason's nomination, broke down, and James told her that it was that refusal that caused him to target them for eviction and not Vanessa. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Jackie, Vanessa, and Becky were chosen to compete.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Game of Throws\"):''' In each round, the competitors launched a dart onto a board that was divided into sections with assigned point values. The player who scored the fewest points in each round was eliminated. Upon elimination, each HouseGuest uncovered a prize that could be good or bad; they could then choose to keep their prize or trade it for another eliminated HouseGuest's prize. After all five rounds, the HouseGuest holding the Veto medallion won the Power of Veto.\n\nShelli initially won the Veto, but after the fifth round, James took the Veto for himself. Jackie had to wear a [[unitard]] shaped like a suit of armor, and Vanessa was forced to shine Jackie's armor for 24 hours. Clay won a trip to Ireland, and Becky won $5,000. Shelli had to perform a regimen with a sword 2,400 times in 24 hours; if she failed, then she would be ineligible to compete in the next Veto competition. After completing her punishment, Shelli attempted to get James to use the Power of Veto on her and to nominate Austin for being deceptive, but James chose not to use it, ensuring that Clay and Shelli would be separated.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 565\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 20\n| Title = Episode 20\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|06}}\n| Aux1 = Days 47\u201350\n| ShortSummary = Having had romantic feelings for each other since Day 1, Clay and Shelli vowed to not campaign against each other. James and his alliance targeted Shelli, but Vanessa campaigned to keep her. James told Austin that Clay and Shelli had campaigned against him but didn't reveal what they had told him. Vanessa, knowing the Sixth Sense was crumbling, affirmed with Austin, Shelli, and the twins that they needed to stay together. Knowing that their time together was running out, Clay and Shelli finally kissed. When discussing whom to eliminate, Vanessa campaigned hard for Shelli, alarming James and Jackie as to Vanessa's true motives. During the live eviction, Clay asked the voters to evict him; they respected his wish, and he became the sixth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house and the first to be evicted by a unanimous vote. After Clay's eviction, Julie informed the HouseGuests that the next nine evicted HouseGuests would make up the game-deciding Jury and that they may not be out of the game upon eviction.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Midway Mayhem\"):''' The HouseGuests skated down an icy path while transporting liquid in a funnel to a container, which contained three labeled balls: Head of Household, $5,000, and a Never-Not Pass, which would exempt the winner from being a Have-Not for the remainder of the game. The first HouseGuest to retrieve each ball would receive the corresponding prize.

Clay, in an attempt to patch things up, told Vanessa that James told John that Vanessa was targeting him, which resulted in a confrontation between Clay and James in which Clay threatened violence. Vanessa then publicly discussed the situation with Clay; though John admitted that James had nothing to do with it and it was all his thoughts, Vanessa didn't believe him. Clay, John and Shelli compared notes and realized that it was a whole misunderstanding. They realized that Vanessa's emotional outbursts were routinely used to send her targets home, and pledged to retaliate so that it wouldn't happen to them next. Becky had such a large lead in the HoH competition that she was able to win all three prizes. Though Becky had worked with both James' alliance and the Sixth Sense, many were unsure as to who she would target. Becky teamed up with Jackie, James and Meg to nominate Shelli and Steve under the guise of targeting Shelli as per the agreement of evicting her and Clay consecutively, but actually backdoor Vanessa, having eavesdropped on the confrontations between Clay, James and Vanessa earlier that day. Becky told Shelli about her plan and told her to act as if she didn't know to stop Vanessa from thinking something was up, though Vanessa became suspicious after Becky told her that John was the backdoor target and then refused to make a deal. At the nomination ceremony, Becky followed through with nominating Shelli and Steve, with Vanessa as the backdoor target.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 567\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 22\n| Title = Episode 22\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|12}}\n| Aux1 = Days 51\u201354\n| ShortSummary = Vanessa, afraid of being backdoored by Becky, asked both Shelli and Steve to choose her to play in the Veto competition if given the choice so that Vanessa could take one of them off the block and remain immune from being the replacement nominee. John later told Shelli to pick him to play, but she was hesitant about clueing Vanessa into the plan. John told Steve about the plan to backdoor Vanessa and also asked him to pick him for the Veto competition as well, but John said he wouldn't use the Veto to save him, only to save Shelli and ensure Vanessa's nomination, as he believed that no one would ever vote to evict Steve. Liz began developing romantic feelings for Austin, much to Julia's disapproval. When picking players for the Veto competition, Austin, Meg and Vanessa were chosen to compete.  Shelli picked the \"HouseGuest's Choice\" chip and chose Vanessa, upsetting John, Becky and Steve.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"BB Comics\"):''' The competitors ziplined past a display of 17 comic books designed after the HouseGuests. One at a time, they had to replicate the display in order, but were given two copies of each cover with minor differences between them. The competitor to correctly assemble the display in the fastest time won the Power of Veto. \n\nSteve won the competition. A paranoid Vanessa interrogated James about Becky's plans and he told her to talk to Becky about it; during the conversation, Becky assured Vanessa that she wasn't going up.

Vanessa campaigned for votes; while she thought she could count on Steve's vote, he was hesitant and she felt betrayed. Vanessa told James that Becky was the one who fed information from his alliance to Shelli and Clay. Jackie, James and Meg realized that Shelli would be targeting James for sending Clay home, but Vanessa would go after Becky. James' alliance decided to betray Becky and vote against Shelli; Shelli became the seventh HouseGuest evicted from the house, the second unanimously, becoming the first Jury member in the process, blindsiding Becky and her allies. The HouseGuests were told that the night would be a double eviction, with a week's worth of competitions occurring that night, culminating in a second eviction.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Getting Loopy\"):''' The night before the challenge, HouseGuests were shown looping video clips of 16 events from earlier that summer. The HouseGuests were given true or false statements based on the clips; incorrect HouseGuests were eliminated and the last one remaining became the new Head of Household. \n\nSteve won the competition; minutes later, he nominated Jackie and Meg for eviction.

However, Vanessa knew he was fine with Austin's plan to backdoor her, so at the Veto meeting, Vanessa called Steve out on his bluff and decided to not use the Power of Veto, keeping Austin's nominations intact.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 574\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 29\n| Title = Episode 29\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|27}}\n| Aux1 = Days 68\u201371\n| ShortSummary = All of the HouseGuests were unsure of whom to evict. John hoped to gain James, Meg and Vanessa's votes. However, Vanessa told John she would be voting with the twins, which caused John to work for Liz and Julia's votes instead. Ultimately, John's campaigning was unsuccessful and he became the tenth HouseGuest evicted from the house,  becoming the fourth Jury member. Shortly after, John, along with Shelli, Jackie and Becky, re-entered the House to join the rest of the HouseGuests to have a chance to re-enter the game and possibly become the new Head of Household.\n\n*'''Head of Household/Battle to Return (\"Dizzyland\"):''' The eligible HouseGuests and jurors each stood on a small disc suspended by a hanging rope. As the competition continued, they were spun into hand-shaped punching bags, which caused them to spin more. The last juror standing on their rope re-entered the game, while the last HouseGuest remaining overall became the new Head of Household. \n\nJulia, Steve and Meg quickly fell off before the conclusion of the live show.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 10|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 575\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 30\n| Title = Episode 30\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|08|30}}\n| Aux1 = Days 71\u201372\n| ShortSummary = John, Shelli and Vanessa were the last competitors remaining. After Shelli fell off, John became a HouseGuest again; Vanessa attempted to make a deal with him, but he declined. Moments later, he fell, making the Vanessa HoH for a third time. \n\nVanessa, with conflicting deals with everyone, knew she had to break a promise at the upcoming nomination ceremony. Hoping to gain information from Meg and James to give her reason to nominate Austin and the twins and not them, she asked them why she should keep them safe and got no information, so at the nomination ceremony, Vanessa nominated Meg and James, with James as the target.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 576\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 31\n| Title = Episode 31\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|09|02}}\n| Aux1 = Days 72\u201375\n| ShortSummary = Now furious with Vanessa for going back on the deal she made in Week 6, James tried to broker a deal with her to keep himself and Meg safe, but all his plan did was irritate Vanessa and make him a bigger target than he already was. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Austin, Julia and Liz were selected, with John and Steve as co-hosts of the competition.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Hide and Go Veto\")''': Individually, HouseGuests entered the House to hide a locked Veto box with their name inside. After everyone hid their boxes, HouseGuests had two minutes to individually search the House for a Veto box. The competition continued until five Veto boxes had been found. The HouseGuest who hides their Veto box the best will win the Power of Veto. \n\nJames hid his Veto box under the living room rug and won the Power of Veto. Now desperately needing a replacement nominee and not wanting to break her secret alliance with John and Steve, Vanessa asked Julia if she would be fine with going up in James' place as a pawn to ensure Meg's eviction and weaken James. Austin and the twins urged Vanessa to nominate and evict John, unaware of her secret alliance with him. At the Veto Meeting, James used the Veto on himself and Vanessa nominated Julia in his place.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 577\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 32\n| Title = Episode 32\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|09|03}}\n| Aux1 = Days 75\u201378\n| ShortSummary = James and Meg attempted to rally Steve and John onto their side to vote Julia out, unaware that they were secretly working with Vanessa. Steve and John became conflicted, recognizing the valuable opportunity to break up Austin and the twins, but at the time, also wanting to appease Vanessa. At the live eviction ceremony, Steve and John ultimately decided to keep Julia and Meg was evicted by a vote of 4-1, with James voting to evict Julia.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"BB Road Trip\")''': The HouseGuests were presented with two images depicting the six pre-jury members on a tour around the world. They were then asked questions about the shown images and had to respond with either 'True' or 'False.' If an incorrect answer is given, that HouseGuest is eliminated from the competition. The last HouseGuest remaining is the new Head of Household. \n\nThe final round came down to the twins, with Liz outlasting Julia and becoming a two-time HoH. Immediately after, Liz nominated James and John for eviction, citing that she had previous loyalties in the house to others. In the random draw for veto players, all of the HouseGuests competed except Vanessa were chosen to compete.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Boomerang\")''': The HouseGuests rolled two balls onto a boomerang-shaped block, with slots on the other side of the block that are designated with specific point values. The HouseGuest whose balls roll into slots that produce the greatest sum is awarded the Power of Veto. \n\nJulia won the Power of Veto and chose not to use it, keeping her sister's nominations intact. At the live second eviction ceremony, James was evicted by a unanimous 4-0 vote, becoming the 5th member of the Jury. \n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 11|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 578\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 33\n| Title = Episode 33\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|09|06}}\n| Aux1 = Days 78\u201379\n| ShortSummary = After realizing only the two power trios remained, Steve and Vanessa agreed to side completely with John and go after Austin and the twins. In order to do so, it was imperative for one of them to win the upcoming Head of Household competition.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Starting Lineup\")''': In each round, HouseGuests were shown a rapid series of 16 baseball cards depicting the HouseGuests. Once they figured out which HouseGuest was excluded from the lineup, they had to take their puzzle pieces, build their face, and hit their button. The last HouseGuest to assemble their puzzle in each round was eliminated. The last HouseGuest standing will be the new Head of Household with a guaranteed spot in the final five.\n\nSteve defeated John in the final round to become a two-time HoH after John threw the competition. Now in power, John, Steve and Vanessa debated about which Austwin to leave off of the block to ensure all three of them would be safe. They also needed to decide which Austwin would be easiest to beat in the final four to ensure they make the final three. Ultimately, they decided to leave Julia off the block and at the nomination ceremony, Steve nominated Austin and Liz, with Austin as the target and Julia as a backdoor option.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 579\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 34\n| Title = Episode 34\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|09|09}}\n| Aux1 = Days 79\u201382\n| ShortSummary = With only six HouseGuests remaining, John, Steve and Vanessa needed to prevent Julia from winning the Power of Veto to keep their final three deal intact, while Austin and the twins knew in order to save them, Julia needed to win the Power of Veto to keep all three of them safe and force Steve to put up either John or Vanessa in Liz's place. Seasons 10 & 11 Jessie Godderz surprised the HouseGuests to host the Power of Veto competition.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Bowlerina\")''': Jessie drew names out of a box to determine the order. In each round, two HouseGuests went head-to-head. HouseGuests had to hold onto a handle above their heads and spin 30 times to lower the gate at the end of their bowling lane for 30 seconds. This gave the HouseGuests the opportunity to bowl down their pins. The first HouseGuest to knock down their four pins in each round moved on and eliminated their opponent. The last HouseGuest standing will win the Power of Veto. \n\nDuring the competition, Vanessa manipulated Julia to compete against Austin to ensure Julia would not win the Power of Veto. It worked, as Austin eventually beat John in the final round to win the Power of Veto. At the Veto Meeting, Austin used the Veto on himself and Steve nominated Julia in his place.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 580\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 35\n| Title = Episode 35\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|09|10}}\n| Aux1 = Days 82\u201385\n| ShortSummary = Knowing that they would be split up, just like Clay and Shelli in Week 6, Liz and Julia spent their final moments together. The twins asked for Julia to be evicted, knowing that Liz would fare better in future competitions. However, John and Vanessa considered evicting Liz due to her being the tie between Austin and Julia, and due to the fact that she is better in competitions. However, at the live eviction, John and Vanessa honored the twins' wishes and Julia was evicted from the house by a 3-0 vote.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"Under the Rainbow\")''': Each HouseGuest has their own lane with a curved section of chicken wire. HouseGuests must maneuver their eggs on top of the chicken wire and over the rainbow into ten slots. The HouseGuests also had a slot off to the side for a prize. The first HouseGuest to place an egg in the special slot will win a trip outside of the House and the first HouseGuest to place ten eggs in their slots at the end of the rainbow will be the new Head of Household, guaranteeing them a spot in the final four.\n\nAt the end of the live show, Austin had his first egg in his slots, while the other HouseGuests were struggling to get their first egg in their slots.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 12|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 581\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 36\n| Title = Episode 36\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|09|13}}\n| Aux1 = Days 85\u201386\n| ShortSummary = Vanessa narrowly defeated Austin and John to become a four-time HoH. Liz won the trip outside the house and was able to take another houseguest with her; she chose Vanessa and the two went to an [[Ariana Grande]] concert with her brother, [[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|season 16]] alumni [[Frankie Grande]]. Again, with conflicting deals with everyone, Vanessa knew she had to break a promise at the upcoming nomination ceremony. Hoping to gain information from Steve to give her reason to put Austin and Liz back on the block, Vanessa asked him why she should keep him and got no information, so at the nomination ceremony, she nominated John and Steve, with John as the target.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 582\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 37\n| Title = Episode 37\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|09|15}}\n| Aux1 = Days 86\u201389\n| ShortSummary = Vanessa decided to work both sides of the house, this time with Austin and Liz, to win the Veto and ensure John's re-eviction. John knew that he needed to win the Power of Veto in order to further his life in the game.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Life in Pieces\")''': HouseGuests competed in a puzzle competition sponsored by CBS' new sitcom, ''[[Life in Pieces]]''. Each HouseGuest had their own lane with a balance beam, a timer with a button, and a magnetic puzzle board. HouseGuests had to hit their button to magnetize their puzzle board for twenty seconds. They then had to walk across the beam to start working on their puzzle. Running out of time or falling off of the beam resulted in the puzzle board being demagnetized, forcing them to start their puzzle from scratch. After a board demagnetizes, that HouseGuest only has ten seconds to remagnetize their board or they will be eliminated from the competition. The first HouseGuest to complete their puzzle and hit their button will win the Power of Veto. \n\nVanessa was quickly eliminated after her board demagnetized and her time ran out. John had a strategy to build his puzzle in his tray instead of on the board, allowing him to walk on the grass as he pleased, then once he had his pieces situated, he could place them on the board correctly. His strategy proved effective and John won the Power of Veto for the fourth time. At the Veto Meeting, John used the Veto on himself and Vanessa nominated Austin in his place. At the live eviction ceremony, after John cast his vote to evict Austin and Liz cast hers to evict Steve, Vanessa cast the tie-breaking vote to send Austin to the jury and he became the fourteenth HouseGuest evicted from the house, becoming the seventh jury member.\n\n*'''Head of Household (\"What the Bleep?!\")''': HouseGuests were shown a clip with a censored word(s). Julie then gave them a word that the censored word(s) could be. HouseGuests then had to decide if Julie's statement was true or false. The HouseGuest with the most points after seven clips will be the new Head of Household with a guaranteed place in the final three. \n\nAfter a tie-breaker question between John and Steve, Steve won his third Head of Household of the season.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 583\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 38\n| Title = Episode 38\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|09|16}}\n| Aux1 = Days 89\u201391\n| ShortSummary = With the final veto competition looming, John, Steve, and Vanessa hoped to win the Power of Veto to send Liz to the jury. At the final nomination ceremony of the summer, Steve nominated John and Vanessa for eviction. Caleb Reynolds from last season entered the House to host the final Veto competition of the summer.\n\n*'''Power of Veto (\"Martial Smarts\")''': In each round, Caleb asked the HouseGuests on what day a certain event occurred. The HouseGuests then had to hit their karate partner, either a hand punch for one day, or a shin kick for 5 days, to display the correct day on their counter. If a HouseGuest buzzed in with an incorrect answer, their counter would drop to zero and would have to try again. The last HouseGuest to answer correctly in each round got one strike against them. Two strikes resulted in elimination from the competition. The last HouseGuest standing will win the final Power of Veto of the summer.\n\nThe competition came down to Vanessa and John, both with both strikes remaining. Vanessa won the last two rounds to win the Power of Veto. Liz campaigned to Vanessa, stating if she kept her, she would take her to the final two. At the Veto Meeting, Vanessa used the Power of Veto to save herself, with Liz going up in her stead. Vanessa then cast her vote to evict John, and he became the eighth member of the Jury.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode table/part|c=#B0C4DE|p=Week 13|nopart=y}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 584\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 39\n| Title = Episode 39\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|09|20}}\n| Aux1 = Days 91\u201394\n| ShortSummary = Liz, Steve, and Vanessa reminisced about the summer's events.\n\n*'''Final Head of Household, Part 1 (\"How 'Bout Them Apples?\")''': HouseGuests sat on an apple-shaped ball and were dunked in chocolate; the last competitor remaining advanced to the third part of the competition, to face off against the winner of Part 2.\n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Big Brother 17 (American season)\n| EpisodeNumber = 585\n| EpisodeNumber2 = 40\n| Title = Episode 40\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|09|23}}\n| Aux1 = Days 91\u201398\n| ShortSummary = Steve fell 3 hours and 35 minutes into the competition. Liz dropped after Vanessa convinced her that she'd be more likely to beat Steve in Part 2, and Vanessa won Part 1 of the Final Head of Household competition. Steve and Liz then had to face off in Part 2 of the Final Head of Household competition.\n\n*'''Final Head of Household, Part 2 (\"Colossal Crossword\")''': HouseGuests competed individually. Each HouseGuest had a giant crossword puzzle with several clues. They had to scale the wall and collect the letters to spell the correct answer to each clue and place them in the crossword. The HouseGuest who completes the crossword and hits their button faster will face Vanessa in Part 3 of the Final Head of Household competition on Finale Night. \n\nSteve completed his puzzle faster than Liz, and advanced to face Vanessa in Part 3.\n\n*'''Final Head of Household, Part 3 (\"Scales of Just-Us\")''': Vanessa and Steve were asked questions based on how the members of the jury completed various statements. A correct answer resulted in receiving one point. The HouseGuest with the most points after 8 questions will become the final Head of Household of the summer.\n\nSteve defeated Vanessa and became the final Head of Household, guaranteeing himself a spot in the final two. He then immediately cast the sole vote to evict Vanessa after praising her strategic game. After the jury questioned the final two, they locked in their votes. Steve won the game after receiving Shelli, Jackie, Becky, Meg, James, and John's votes to win, and Liz became the runner-up with Vanessa, Austin, and Julia's votes. John, James, and Jason were the top three vote-getters for America's Favorite HouseGuest; James won. \n| LineColor = B0C4DE\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Have-Nots==\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%; width:100%; line-height:15px;\"\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 1\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 2\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 3\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 4\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 5\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 6\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 7\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 8\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 9\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 10\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 11\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 12\n! style=\"width:7%\"|Week 13\n|-\n| Austin,<br />Da'Vonne,<br />Liz,<br />Vanessa\n| James,<br />Jason,<br />Meg,<br />Steve\n| {{cNone|None}}\n| Audrey,<br />Becky,<br />Jackie,<br />John\n| Clay,<br />Shelli,<br />Steve\n| Austin,<br />Julia,<br />Liz\n| Jackie,<br />James,<br />Meg\n| John,<br />Steve,<br />Vanessa\n| {{cNone|None}}\n| James,<br />John,<br />Julia,<br />Meg\n| colspan=\"3\" {{cNone|None}}\n|}\n\n==Voting history==\n<!--<div class=\"mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\">-->\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%; text-align:center; font-size:85%<!--Please keep the font size at this value for conforming to page margins.-->; line-height:12px;\"\n|+\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 1<!--Jason nominated FIRST in Week 1.-->\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 2<!--Shelli nominated FIRST in Week 2.-->\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 3<!--Austin nominated FIRST in Week 3.-->\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 4<!--Liz nominated FIRST in Week 4.-->\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 5<!--Jackie nominated FIRST in Week 5.-->\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 6\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 7\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 8\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 9\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 10\n! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 11\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 12\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:5%\" |Week 13\n|-\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 50\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 57\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 71\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 78 \n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 85\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 89\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Day 98\n! style=\"width:5%\" |Finale\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Head(s) of Household<!--Please keep this in the order they nominated.

This also meant the HoH who nominated them was dethroned, and subsequently eligible for post-veto nomination.\n*{{note|2|Note 2}}: Identical twins Liz and Julia took turns playing as a single HouseGuest during the first five weeks, secretly trading places every few days between living inside the house and being in sequester. Both twins pretended to be Liz until they completed this task. Following the Week 5 eviction, Julia was allowed to enter the house under her own identity and both twins were allowed to play for themselves.\n*{{note|3|Note 3}}: {{anchor|BB Fast Forward}}{{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} For volunteering to sit out of the Week 1 Head of Household competitions, Da'Vonne and Vanessa were awarded the BB Fast Forward, which gave them immunity for the week. They were instructed to share the Fast Forward with another HouseGuest each; they chose Liz and Austin. \n*{{note|4|Note 4}}: {{anchor|Last Laugh}}{{Color box|#ccc|border=darkgray}} A telephone appeared in the House; for being the HouseGuest who answered the seventh call, Da'Vonne was awarded the Last Laugh, which allowed her to block three HouseGuests from voting in this week's eviction; she chose Becky, Jackie, and Jeff.\n*{{note|5|Note 5}}: Audrey was given a penalty vote for eviction after eating normal food while on the mandatory Have-Not slop diet.\n*{{note|6|Note 6}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following the first eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games \u2014 including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n*{{note|7|Note 7}}: During the Head of Household competition in Week 10, the first four jurors \u2014 Shelli, Jackie, Becky, and John \u2014 competed for an opportunity to come back into the game. The juror who lasted the longest would return to the game to win and was eligible to become Head of Household if that juror finished first amongst the other HouseGuests in the competition. John lasted the longest of the jury members and re-entered the house.\n*{{note|8|Note 8}}: As Head of Household, Vanessa was forced to break the tie on Day 89.\n*{{note|9|Note 9}}: During the finale, the jury members voted for which finalist should win Big Brother.\n</small>\n<!--</div>-->\n\n==Reception==\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\n\n===Viewing figures===\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | #\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Air Date\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"unsortable\" | United States\n! rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Source\n|-\n! 18\u201349<br />(rating/share)\n!

They played their home games at [[Spectrum Stadium]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], and were led by first-year head coach [[Josh Heupel]]. The Knights competed as members of the East Division of the [[American Athletic Conference]]. The 2018 season marked the 40th season of football for the Knights program.\n\nThe 2018 campaign began with the Knights attempting to defend their [[American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game|AAC championship]], as well as extend the nation's longest active winning streak, which stood at 13 games. For the first time in program history, the Knights were [[2018 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings|ranked]] in both the preseason [[AP Poll]] (#21) and preseason [[Coaches Poll]] (#23). By week 12, the team had risen into the top ten of the AP, Coaches, and [[College Football Playoff|CFP]] rankings, the first time they had been ranked in the top ten in all three during the regular season.\n\nAfter winning their first twelve games of the season, UCF extended their school record [[Longest NCAA Division I football winning streaks|winning streak]] to 25 consecutive games, dating back to the start of the [[2017 UCF Knights football team|2017 season]]. The Knights also secured their second-consecutive undefeated regular season, and second-consecutive American Athletic Conference title by defeating [[2018 Memphis Tigers football team|Memphis]] in the [[2018 American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game|2018 AAC Championship Game]]. It was the fourth AAC conference title in six years for the Knights. They were invited to their third [[New Year's Six|NY6]]/[[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] bowl in school history, the [[2019 Fiesta Bowl (January)|Fiesta Bowl]]. Their winning streak came to end, as they were defeated by [[2018 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]], 40-32.\n\n==Preseason==\n===Award watch lists===\n<small>Listed in the order that they were released</small>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=UCF Knights|Award|Player|Position|Year}}\n|-\n|[[Lott Trophy]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lottimpacttrophy.org/2018-watch-list/|title=2018 Watch List {{!}} Lott IMPACT Trophy {{!}} Honoring College Football's Defensive Best|website=lottimpacttrophy.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-17}}</ref>\n|Pat Jasinski\n|LB\n|SR\n|-\n|[[Rimington Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Rimington Trophy Press Release|url=http://www.rimingtontrophy.com/news/?article_id=100|date=May 30, 2018|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}</ref>\n|Jordan Johnson\n|C\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Chuck Bednarik Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 Bednarik Award Watch List|url=https://www.maxwellfootballclub.org/2018-maxwell-bednarik-watch-list|date=July 16, 2018|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}</ref>\n|[[Trysten Hill]]\n|DT\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Maxwell Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 Maxwell Award Watch List|url=https://www.maxwellfootballclub.org/2018-maxwell-watch-list|date=July 16, 2018|accessdate=July 17, 2018}}</ref>\n|[[McKenzie Milton]]\n|QB\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Davey O'Brien Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Davey O\u2019Brien Award Watch List includes 26 players|url=http://daveyobrienaward.org/2018/07/2018-davey-obrien-award-watch-list-includes-26-players|date=July 17, 2018|accessdate=July 17, 2018}}</ref>\n|McKenzie Milton\n|QB\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Jim Thorpe Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Paycom Jim Thorpe Award Names 2018 Preseason Watchlist|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180723005105/en/Paycom-Jim-Thorpe-Award-Names-2018-Preseason|date=July 23, 2018|accessdate=July 23, 2018}}</ref>\n|Kyle Gibson\n|DB\n|SR\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Bronko Nagurski Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 Bronko Nagurski Trophy Preseason Watch List|url=http://touchdownclub.com/nagurski-trophy/watch-list/|date=July 24, 2018|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}</ref>\n|Kyle Gibson\n|DB\n|SR\n|-\n|Trysten Hill\n|DT\n|JR\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Outland Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=22018 OUTLAND TROPHY WATCH LIST UNVEILED|url=http://www.sportswriters.net/fwaa/news/2018/outland180724.html|date=July 24, 2018|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}</ref>\n|Trysten Hill\n|DT\n|JR\n|-\n|Jordan Johnson\n|C\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Walter Camp Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Walter Camp Football Foundation Announces 2018 Player of the Year Preseason \u201cWatch List\u201d|last1=Carbone|first1=Al|url=https://waltercamp.org/walter-camp-football-foundation-announces-2018-player-of-the-year-preseason-watch-list|date=July 27, 2018|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}</ref>\n|McKenzie Milton\n|QB\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Watch List for 2018 Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award \u00ae Presented by A.

The Knights beat conference foe [[2018 Memphis Tigers football team|Memphis]], rallying from a 16-point deficit, on a cool, rainy afternoon at the [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium|Liberty Bowl]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. The Tigers offense, behind running back [[Darrell Henderson]] dominated the first half of the game. Henderson would rush for 199 yards and one touchdown, and the Knights defense had little answer in the first half. Memphis jumped out to a 17\u20137 lead in the first quarter. Brady White had an 11-yard touchdown run, then later Henderson broke free for a 25-yard touchdown as time expired in the first quarter. UCF received a kickoff to begin the second quarter. Adrian Killins Jr. returned the kick 44 yards to near midfield. However, UCF later went for it on a 4th & 2 at the Memphis 43. [[McKenzie Milton]]'s pass to Otis Anderson fell incomplete, turning the ball over on downs. Memphis subsequently drove seven plays for a field goal, building a 20\u20137 lead. UCF received the kickoff for a touchback. On their first play from scrimmage, McKenzie Milton threw deep to Gabriel Davis, who turned it into a 75-yard touchdown pass. After another Memphis field goal drive, the score was 23\u201314 in favor of the Tigers. After forcing UCF into a 3-and-out, the Tigers went on a 4-play, 66 yard touchdown drive. [[Darrell Henderson]] blasted the defense for runs of 31 yards and 14 yards, setting up [[Tony Pollard (American football)|Tony Pollard]]'s 19-yard touchdown run. Memphis now led 30\u201314, UCF's largest deficit during the winning streak. In the closing two minutes, the Knights drove to the Memphis 27 yard line, and Matthew Wright kicked a 44-yard field goal as time expired. Memphis led 30\u201317 at halftime.\n\nThe second half turned into a slug fest, as heavy rains began to pelt the stadium. The UCF defense stepped up their efforts, and forced Memphis into three straight punts to start the second half. However, the UCF offense was unable to yet capitalize. Twice they got into Memphis territory, but both times they were forced to punt. Late in the third quarter, UCF started their drive at their own 20 yard line. Facing a 3rd & 9, Milton scrambled to the 29 yard line, tackled about one yard short of a first down. Still trailing by two scores, UCF decided to go for it on 4th down. Taj McGowan blasted through the line for a first down, then broke free for a shocking 71-yard touchdown run. Memphis fumbled away the ball on the next drive, only to see UCF fumble it right back to them. The Tigers marched down the field to the UCF 21, aided by two UCF 15-yard penalties. At the 23 yard line, Kedarian Jones fumbled away the ball, and UCF recovered. Trailing 30\u201324, Milton drove the Knights 74 yards for a go-ahead touchdown. At the 7 yard line with 12:14 remaining in regulation, Milton scrambled to the endzone, was hit by a defender, flipped into the air, but crossed the plane for the score. Leading now 31\u201330, the Knights defense stiffened. With one minute left in the game, UCF punted, and pinned the Tigers back at their own 15 yard line. Brady White quickly drove the Tigers to the UCF 40 yard line. With 18 seconds left in regulation, White under pressure, rolled out to his left, completing a pass to Tony Pollard to the UCF 31 yard line. Pollard was tackled in-bounds, and the clock ran out.

However, the Pirates drove 98 yards to the UCF 1 yard line. Facing a 3rd & Goal at the 1, Holton Ahlers' jump pass attempt resulted in a fumble. Nate Evans recovered the ball and ran 94 yards for a UCF touchdown.

Going into the game, the Knights were ranked 12th in the initial [[College Football Playoff|CFP ranking]]. The game turned into a high-scoring affair, with 1,300 total yards of offense. Temple was arguably the stronger team in the first half, as Owls quarterback Anthony Russo threw for 277 yards and three touchdown, and rushed for one touchdown before halftime. The Owls got on the board first with a 41-yard field goal by Will Mobley. The Owls then blocked a UCF field goal attempt. The Knights scored touchdowns on their next two drives, while the Owls scored on their next four drives (three touchdowns, one field goal). The Owls held a ten-point lead at one point during the second quarter, with the highlight being a 70-yard touchdown pass to Randle Jones. The Knights took a 28\u201327 lead with less than two minutes left in the half. However, Temple drove 64 yards in 1:25 for another touchdown, and a 34\u201328 halftime lead.\n\nAfter the explosive first half by the Owls, the Knights defense would stiffen in the second half. The Knights would allow only six points in the second half, forced two turnovers, and managed to take control of the game. To open the third quarter, [[McKenzie Milton]] drove the Knights 66 yards in only four plays. Greg McCrae ran for a 32-yard touchdown, and a 35\u201334 UCF lead. Anthony Russo was intercepted with an over-the-shoulder diving catch by Knights defender Nevelle Clarke, for the game's first turnover. Though the Knights were held to a 3-and-out, they would score on their next drive, a 19-yard touchdown pass to Michael Colubiale. Trailing 42\u201334, Temple drove ten plays to the UCF 12 yard line. Facing 3rd down & 4, the Owls had back-to-back false start penalties, then their ensuing field attempt was missed.\n\nWith just over 13 minutes left in regulation, Temple intercepted [[McKenzie Milton]] at the 33 yard line. Russo threw an 8-yard touchdown pass to Ventell Bryant, but Temple's game-tying two-point conversion attempt was stuffed a half yard short of the goal line. UCF maintained the lead 42\u201340 with 9:44 to go. A 10-yard touchdown run by Taj McGowan put the Knights up 49\u201340. The Owls drove down the UCF 20 yard line, but facing a 3rd & 10, Trysten Hill sacked Anthony Russo for a 10-yard loss, UCF's first sack of the night. On 4th & 20 at the 30 yard line, Russo's pass attempt the endzone was too high, and the Owls turned the ball over on downs. UCF tacked on a field goal for a 52\u201340 lead. Temple got the ball back with 1:36 left, but Russo was sacked again, and then intercepted, which clinched the game for the Knights.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/recap?gameId=401019517|title=Milton throws 3 TDs, No. 12 UCF holds off Temple 52-40|publisher=ESPN.com|date=November 2, 2018|accessdate=November 2, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe victory, coupled with a loss by [[2018 Houston Cougars football team|Houston]] two days later, gave UCF the lead in most intra-conference game wins in [[American Athletic Conference|AAC]] history (since 2013).

Navy fumbled away the ball on their next two drives, both leading to Knights touchdowns. In the second quarter, the Midshipmen went on a ten-play drive, reaching the UCF 3, but a false start penalty followed by an incompletion resulted in Navy managing only a field goal. UCF looked to tack on another touchdown just before halftime, but with 14 seconds remaining, running back Taj McGowan fumbled away the ball at the Navy 13 yard line.\n\nTrailing 21\u20133, Navy received the second half kickoff, and drove 75 yards in 11 plays for a touchdown. UCF answered on the next drive, with their own 75-yard drive, capped off by Milton's 1-yard touchdown run. At the start of the fourth quarter, Mike Martin's 14-yard touchdown run reduced the deficit to 28\u201317. UCF put the game mostly out of reach as Milton threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Dredrick Snelson with 11:28 left in regulation. The Knights forced a Navy punt, then proceeded to run the clock down to 6 minutes. Mac Loudermilk's punt was short, however, giving Navy the ball at the own 49 yard line. Trailing 35\u201317, Navy scored a touchdown with 3:34 to go, but failed to recover the ensuing onside kick attempt.

The day started out with UCF hosting ''[[College GameDay (football TV program)|College Gameday]]'' at the [[University of Central Florida#Main campus|UCF campus]] for the first time in program history. It was UCF's second appearance on ''Gameday'' (they were also the visiting team at [[2005 South Carolina Gamecocks football team|South Carolina]] on September 1, 2005), and Cincinnati's first-ever appearance. The American Athletic Conference East Division title was at stake for both teams \u2014 UCF would clinch the division with a victory, and Cincinnati with a win would have a chance to clinch the division in the following week. The Knights routed the Bearcats, as quarterback [[McKenzie Milton]] threw for 268 yards, three touchdown passes, and ran for one touchdown. The Knights extended their winning streak to 23 games.\n\nCincinnati received the opening kickoff. The Bearcats suffered two false start penalties before running a single play, as crowd noise was already a factor. They were forced to punt, pinning the Knights back at their own 7 yard line. On their first play from scrimmage, Malik Clements sacked McKenzie Milton causing a fumble. Kimoni Fitz recovered the ball in the endzone for a Cincinnati touchdown. The extra point was missed, and the Bearcats led 6\u20130. The Knights went 3-and-out on their next possession, with Cincinnati's defense sacking Milton for the second time. The Bearcats could not capitalize, however, as Cole Smith missed an ensuring 38-yard goal attempt. The Knights offense finally got revved up, as Milton completed two straight passes to Dredrick Snelson (15 and 28 yards), then to Greg McCrae (27 yards). That set up Milton's 3-yard quarterback keeper for a touchdown and a 7\u20136 lead. The Bearcats drove 50 yards in ten plays to the UCF 24 yard line. With seconds left in the first quarter, Cole Smith's 41-yard field goal attempt was blocked, and recovered by Brandon Moore. Moore ran back the ball 53 yard to the Cincinnati 22 yard line. Three plays later, facing 3rd & 5, Adrian Killins Jr. caught a diving 17-yard touchdown pass from Milton for a 14\u20136 lead.\n\nUCF added another touchdown in the second quarter, stretching their lead to 21\u20136. In the final minutes of the half, the Bearcats went on a 15-play drive reaching as far as the UCF 12 yard line. Quarterback Desmond Ridder was sacked by Titus Davis for a loss of 2, then sacked again by Davis, this time fumbling. The Knights recovered, and took a knee to end the half.\n\nThe second half belonged to the Knights. Cincinnati committed two turnovers, and a turnover on downs, while the Knights added two more touchdowns, as well as a field goal. The Bearcats finally scored an offensive touchdown with just over 9 minutes remaining in regulation.

It was the Knights second straight win in the rivalry, and their second win at Tampa. The Knights extended their active winning streak to 24 games, their away game winning streak to nine games, and tied an NCAA record with their 24th consecutive game scoring 30+ points.\n\nThe first quarter opened with punts by both teams, followed by interceptions by both teams. Nick Roberts of the Bulls picked off McKenzie Milton at the UCF 30, and returned the ball to the 12. The Knights defense stiffened, and the Bulls went for it on a 4th & 1 at the 3 yard line. Jordan Cronkrite was stuffed for no gain, and the Bulls turned the ball over on downs. Milton led the Knights on a 97-yard drive, including a 38-yard pass to Gabriel Davis, following a 14-yard touchdown pass to Davis, and a 7\u20130 lead.\n\nEarly in the second quarter, the Bulls drove to the UCF 35, and again went for it on a 4th down. For the second time, Jordan Cronkrite was tackled for no gain, and again the Bulls turned the ball over on downs. Six plays later, facing a 3rd & 7 at the USF 30, [[McKenzie Milton]] scrambled to the right and was upended after a diving tackle by Mazzi Wilkins.

On the fourth play of the game, Tigers running back [[Darrell Henderson]] broke free for a 62-yard touchdown run, and a quick 7\u20130 lead for Memphis. Knights quarterback Darriel Mack Jr. then fumbled away the ball at the UCF 27, leading to Henderson's second touchdown. The Knights finally got on the board, going 65 yards in 7 plays, with a 14-yard touchdown run by Greg McCrae. The Memphis rushing attack struck again quickly. Facing 3rd & 4 at their own 30 yard line, Patrick Taylor Jr. broke free for a 70-yard touchdown, and 21\u20137 lead. The miscues for the Knights continued, as Mack was sacked and fumbled, leading to a Tigers field goal and a shocking 24\u20137 lead at the end of the first quarter.\n\nAs the second quarter began, the Knights were driving into Tigers territory. A 20-yard completion from Mack to Gabriel Davis sparked the drive, and UCF eventually reached the red zone. Facing 3rd & Goal at the 6, Mack ran up the middle for an apparent touchdown, but the ball was fumbled and bouncing live into the endzone, dangerously close to going out-of-bounds. Michael Colubiale fell on the ball and recovered it for the UCF touchdown. [[Darrell Henderson]] continued to punish the Knights defense. On the second play of the next drive, he blasted for an 82-yard touchdown run, and a 31\u201314 Tigers lead. With under 4 minutes left in the half, a Memphis punt set UCF deep at their own 6 yard line. Mack threw a 44-yard pass to Gabriel Davis, then Greg McCrae broke free for a 47-yard run all the way to the 3 yard line. Mack's 4 yard touchdown pass to Jake Hescock made the score 31\u201321. The Knights forced a 3-and-out and Memphis punted with 1:50 remaining. But Otis Anderson muffed the punt, and Memphis recovered. With 21 seconds left in the half, [[Darrell Henderson]] connected with Sean Dykes for a 4-yard touchdown pass, and the Tigers led 38\u201321 at halftime.\n\nUCF received the ball to start the third quarter, and proceeded to dominate the second half. The Knights would score five touchdown on five consecutive drives, erasing a 17-point deficit, and held the Tigers to only three points in the second half. [[Darrell Henderson]] was held to only 3 yards in the second half, while Darriel Mack Jr. threw for a touchdown, and ran for four more. Mack sparked the rally with a 54-yard touchdown to a wide-open Otis Anderson, who ran untouched to the endzone. Later, Memphis managed to drive to the UCF 2 yard line, but Brady White's pass to the endzone fell incomplete off the fingertips of Damonte Coxie as he hit the ground. The Tigers settled for a field goal, and clung to a 41\u201335 lead. The Knights took their first lead of the game (42\u201341) with a touchdown in the opening seconds of the fourth quarter.

Kyle Gibson sacked quarterback [[Joe Burrow]] for a 6-yard loss, but Knights defender Randy Charlton was subsequently flagged for an [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] penalty after spiking the ball. The penalty proved costly as it gave LSU new life, and was a turning point in the game. The Tigers were awarded 15 yards and a first down. Six plays later they were in the endzone for a touchdown. Driving across midfield in the closing seconds of the first quarter, quarterback Darriel Mack Jr. was tackled on a run, and fumbled the ball, and LSU recovered.\n\nLSU scored touchdowns on their first two possessions of the second quarter, erasing the deficit, and pulling out to a 24\u201314 lead.

With 3:56 left in the third quarter, Mack Loudermilk's punt was muffed by Tigers return man [[Justin Jefferson]], and UCF recovered at the 20 yard line. The Knights had to settle for a field goal, however, and kicker Matthew Wright trimmed the score to 34\u201324.\n\nLSU tacked on two more field goals in the fourth quarter, and stretched their lead to 40\u201324.

The Knights defense forced a three-and-out, and got one last possession with 35 seconds to go. With 20 seconds left, Mack's pass attempt deflected off of players, and was intercepted by JaCoby Stevens to seal the win for LSU.<ref name=\"espnrecap\">{{cite news|url=https://www.espn.com/college-football/recap?gameId=401032084|title=No. 11 LSU knocks off No. 7 UCF 40-32 in Fiesta Bowl|publisher=ESPN.com|date=January 2, 2019|accessdate=August 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Rankings==\n{{Further|2018 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings}}\n{{NCAA Division I FBS CFP ranking movements\n| year            = {{2018}}\n| finalpollweek   = -\n| cfpfirstweek    = 9\n| AP_pre          = 21\n| coaches_pre     = 23\n| AP_1            = 19\n| coaches_1       = 20\n| AP_2            = 18\n| coaches_2       = 18\n| AP_3            = 16\n| coaches_3       = 18\n| AP_4            = 13\n| coaches_4       = 14\n| AP_5            = 12\n| coaches_5       = 13\n| AP_6            = 10\n| coaches_6       = 9\n| AP_7            = 10\n| coaches_7       = 9\n| AP_8            = 10\n| coaches_8       = 10\n| AP_9            = 9\n| coaches_9       = 9\n| cfp_9           = 12\n| AP_10           = 11\n| coaches_10      = 11\n| cfp_10          = 12\n| AP_11           = 11\n| coaches_11      = 11\n| cfp_11          = 11\n| AP_12           = 8-T\n| coaches_12      = 9\n| cfp_12          = 9\n| AP_13           = 7\n| coaches_13      = 7\n| cfp_13          = 8\n| AP_14           = 7\n| coaches_14      = 7\n| cfp_14          = 8\n| AP_15           = 11\n| coaches_15      = 12\n}}\n\n==Awards and milestones==\n===American Athletic Conference honors===\n====Offensive player of the year====\n*[[McKenzie Milton]]<ref name=\"AAC11-28-2018\">{{cite news|url=http://theamerican.org/news/2018/11/28/football-ucfs-milton-ecus-harvey-temples-wright-named-as-american-players-of-the-year.aspx|title=UCF's Milton, ECU's Harvey, Temple's Wright named as American Players of the Year|publisher=TheAmerican.org|date=November 28, 2018|accessdate=November 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n====American Athletic Conference All-Conference====\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n*'''First Team'''<ref name=\"AAC11-28-2018\"/>\n*OT Jake Brown\n*OG Cole Schneider\n*C Jordan Johnson\n*QB [[McKenzie Milton]]\n*LB Nate Evans\n*CB [[Nevelle Clarke]]\n*S Richie Grant\n{{col-break}}\n*'''Second Team'''<ref name=\"AAC11-28-2018\"/>\n*WR [[Gabriel Davis]]\n*OT [[Wyatt Miller]]\n*RB Adrian Killins Jr.\n*DL Titus Davis\n*DL Brendon Hayes\n*LB Pat Jasinski\n*K Matthew Wright\n*RS Adrian Killins Jr.\n{{col-break}}\n*'''Honorable Mention'''<ref name=\"AAC11-28-2018\"/>\n*TE Michael Colubiale\n*CB Brandon Moore\n{{col-end}}\n\n====American Athletic Conference Player of the Week====\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n*'''Offense'''<ref name=\"AAC-Report\">{{cite news|url=http://theamerican.org/documents/2018/8/27/2018_release_1a.pdf|title=American Athletic Conference Football Report|publisher=American Athletic Conference|accessdate=September 6, 2018}}</ref>\n*September 3: [[McKenzie Milton]]\n*September 24: [[McKenzie Milton]]\n*October 1: [[McKenzie Milton]]\n*October 15: [[McKenzie Milton]]\n{{col-break}}\n*'''Defense'''<ref name=\"AAC-Report\"/>\n*October 8: Titus Davis\n*October 22: Nate Evans\n*November 19: Titus Davis\n{{col-break}}\n*'''Special Teams'''<ref name=\"AAC-Report\"/>\n*October 15: Matthew Wright\n*October 22: Matthew Wright\n{{col-end}}\n\n===School records===\n*Most consecutive victories: 25 (an American Athletic Conference record<ref name=\"AAC-Report\"/>) <!-- through AAC Champ -->\n*Most consecutive games scoring 30+ points: 26 (ongoing;

They played their home games at [[Spectrum Stadium]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], and were led by first-year head coach [[Josh Heupel]]. The Knights competed as members of the East Division of the [[American Athletic Conference]]. The 2018 season marked the 40th season of football for the Knights program.\n\nThe 2018 campaign began with the Knights attempting to defend their [[American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game|AAC championship]], as well as extend the nation's longest active winning streak, which stood at 13 games. For the first time in program history, the Knights were [[2018 NCAA Division I FBS football rankings|ranked]] in both the preseason [[AP Poll]] (#21) and preseason [[Coaches Poll]] (#23). By week 12, the team had risen into the top ten of the AP, Coaches, and [[College Football Playoff|CFP]] rankings, the first time they had been ranked in the top ten in all three during the regular season.\n\nAfter winning their first twelve games of the season, UCF extended their school record [[Longest NCAA Division I football winning streaks|winning streak]] to 25 consecutive games, dating back to the start of the [[2017 UCF Knights football team|2017 season]]. The Knights also secured their second-consecutive undefeated regular season, and second-consecutive American Athletic Conference title by defeating [[2018 Memphis Tigers football team|Memphis]] in the [[2018 American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game|2018 AAC Championship Game]]. It was the fourth AAC conference title in six years for the Knights. They were invited to their third [[New Year's Six|NY6]]/[[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] bowl in school history, the [[2019 Fiesta Bowl (January)|Fiesta Bowl]]. Their winning streak came to end, as they were defeated by [[2018 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]], 40-32.\n\n==Preseason==\n===Award watch lists===\n<small>Listed in the order that they were released</small>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=UCF Knights|Award|Player|Position|Year}}\n|-\n|[[Lott Trophy]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lottimpacttrophy.org/2018-watch-list/|title=2018 Watch List {{!}} Lott IMPACT Trophy {{!}} Honoring College Football's Defensive Best|website=lottimpacttrophy.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-17}}</ref>\n|Pat Jasinski\n|LB\n|SR\n|-\n|[[Rimington Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Rimington Trophy Press Release|url=http://www.rimingtontrophy.com/news/?article_id=100|date=May 30, 2018|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}</ref>\n|Jordan Johnson\n|C\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Chuck Bednarik Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 Bednarik Award Watch List|url=https://www.maxwellfootballclub.org/2018-maxwell-bednarik-watch-list|date=July 16, 2018|accessdate=July 16, 2018}}</ref>\n|[[Trysten Hill]]\n|DT\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Maxwell Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 Maxwell Award Watch List|url=https://www.maxwellfootballclub.org/2018-maxwell-watch-list|date=July 16, 2018|accessdate=July 17, 2018}}</ref>\n|[[McKenzie Milton]]\n|QB\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Davey O'Brien Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Davey O\u2019Brien Award Watch List includes 26 players|url=http://daveyobrienaward.org/2018/07/2018-davey-obrien-award-watch-list-includes-26-players|date=July 17, 2018|accessdate=July 17, 2018}}</ref>\n|McKenzie Milton\n|QB\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Jim Thorpe Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Paycom Jim Thorpe Award Names 2018 Preseason Watchlist|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180723005105/en/Paycom-Jim-Thorpe-Award-Names-2018-Preseason|date=July 23, 2018|accessdate=July 23, 2018}}</ref>\n|Kyle Gibson\n|DB\n|SR\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Bronko Nagurski Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2018 Bronko Nagurski Trophy Preseason Watch List|url=http://touchdownclub.com/nagurski-trophy/watch-list/|date=July 24, 2018|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}</ref>\n|Kyle Gibson\n|DB\n|SR\n|-\n|Trysten Hill\n|DT\n|JR\n|-\n|rowspan=2|[[Outland Trophy]]<ref>{{cite web|title=22018 OUTLAND TROPHY WATCH LIST UNVEILED|url=http://www.sportswriters.net/fwaa/news/2018/outland180724.html|date=July 24, 2018|accessdate=July 24, 2018}}</ref>\n|Trysten Hill\n|DT\n|JR\n|-\n|Jordan Johnson\n|C\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Walter Camp Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Walter Camp Football Foundation Announces 2018 Player of the Year Preseason \u201cWatch List\u201d|last1=Carbone|first1=Al|url=https://waltercamp.org/walter-camp-football-foundation-announces-2018-player-of-the-year-preseason-watch-list|date=July 27, 2018|accessdate=July 30, 2018}}</ref>\n|McKenzie Milton\n|QB\n|JR\n|-\n|[[Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Watch List for 2018 Johnny Unitas Golden Arm Award \u00ae Presented by A.

The Knights beat conference foe [[2018 Memphis Tigers football team|Memphis]], rallying from a 16-point deficit, on a cool, rainy afternoon at the [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium|Liberty Bowl]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]].

Henderson would rush for 199 yards and one touchdown, and the Knights defense had little answer in the first half. Memphis jumped out to a 17\u20137 lead in the first quarter. Brady White had an 11-yard touchdown run, then later Henderson broke free for a 25-yard touchdown as time expired in the first quarter. UCF received a kickoff to begin the second quarter. Adrian Killins Jr. returned the kick 44 yards to near midfield. However, UCF later went for it on a 4th & 2 at the Memphis 43. [[McKenzie Milton]]'s pass to Otis Anderson fell incomplete, turning the ball over on downs. Memphis subsequently drove seven plays for a field goal, building a 20\u20137 lead. UCF received the kickoff for a touchback. On their first play from scrimmage, McKenzie Milton threw deep to Gabriel Davis, who turned it into a 75-yard touchdown pass. After another Memphis field goal drive, the score was 23\u201314 in favor of the Tigers. After forcing UCF into a 3-and-out, the Tigers went on a 4-play, 66 yard touchdown drive. [[Darrell Henderson]] blasted the defense for runs of 31 yards and 14 yards, setting up [[Tony Pollard (American football)|Tony Pollard]]'s 19-yard touchdown run. Memphis now led 30\u201314, UCF's largest deficit during the winning streak. In the closing two minutes, the Knights drove to the Memphis 27 yard line, and Matthew Wright kicked a 44-yard field goal as time expired. Memphis led 30\u201317 at halftime.\n\nThe second half turned into a slug fest, as heavy rains began to pelt the stadium. The UCF defense stepped up their efforts, and forced Memphis into three straight punts to start the second half. However, the UCF offense was unable to yet capitalize. Twice they got into Memphis territory, but both times they were forced to punt. Late in the third quarter, UCF started their drive at their own 20 yard line. Facing a 3rd & 9, Milton scrambled to the 29 yard line, tackled about one yard short of a first down. Still trailing by two scores, UCF decided to go for it on 4th down. Taj McGowan blasted through the line for a first down, then broke free for a shocking 71-yard touchdown run. Memphis fumbled away the ball on the next drive, only to see UCF fumble it right back to them. The Tigers marched down the field to the UCF 21, aided by two UCF 15-yard penalties. At the 23 yard line, Kedarian Jones fumbled away the ball, and UCF recovered. Trailing 30\u201324, Milton drove the Knights 74 yards for a go-ahead touchdown. At the 7 yard line with 12:14 remaining in regulation, Milton scrambled to the endzone, was hit by a defender, flipped into the air, but crossed the plane for the score. Leading now 31\u201330, the Knights defense stiffened. With one minute left in the game, UCF punted, and pinned the Tigers back at their own 15 yard line. Brady White quickly drove the Tigers to the UCF 40 yard line. With 18 seconds left in regulation, White under pressure, rolled out to his left, completing a pass to Tony Pollard to the UCF 31 yard line. Pollard was tackled in-bounds, and the clock ran out.

On 4th & 20 at the 30 yard line, Russo's pass attempt the endzone was too high, and the Owls turned the ball over on downs. UCF tacked on a field goal for a 52\u201340 lead.

The Knights won their 22nd consecutive game, and 13th consecutive home game. The Knights jumped out to a 21\u20130 lead, with Greg McCrae's 11-yard touchdown run the first points of the day. Navy fumbled away the ball on their next two drives, both leading to Knights touchdowns. In the second quarter, the Midshipmen went on a ten-play drive, reaching the UCF 3, but a false start penalty followed by an incompletion resulted in Navy managing only a field goal. UCF looked to tack on another touchdown just before halftime, but with 14 seconds remaining, running back Taj McGowan fumbled away the ball at the Navy 13 yard line.\n\nTrailing 21\u20133, Navy received the second half kickoff, and drove 75 yards in 11 plays for a touchdown. UCF answered on the next drive, with their own 75-yard drive, capped off by Milton's 1-yard touchdown run. At the start of the fourth quarter, Mike Martin's 14-yard touchdown run reduced the deficit to 28\u201317. UCF put the game mostly out of reach as Milton threw a 12-yard touchdown pass to Dredrick Snelson with 11:28 left in regulation. The Knights forced a Navy punt, then proceeded to run the clock down to 6 minutes. Mac Loudermilk's punt was short, however, giving Navy the ball at the own 49 yard line. Trailing 35\u201317, Navy scored a touchdown with 3:34 to go, but failed to recover the ensuing onside kick attempt. UCF successfully ran out the clock, and secured the victory.\n\nThe Knights defense held Navy quarterback [[Zach Abey]] to 0 passing yards on only 2 attempts.\n\n===Cincinnati===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=No. 19 Bearcats\n|R1=6 |R2=0 |R3=0 |R4=7\n|Home='''No. 11 Knights'''\n|H1=7 |H2=14 |H3=7 |H4=10\n}}\n{{see also|2018 Cincinnati Bearcats football team}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n{{CollegePrimaryHeader|team=UCF Knights|Overall record|Last meeting|Result}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 2\u20131\n| 2017\n| '''W''', 51\u201323\n|}\n{{-}}\nUCF hosted [[2018 Cincinnati Bearcats football team|Cincinnati]] in prime time on ''[[Saturday Night Football|Saturday Night Football on ABC]]''. The day started out with UCF hosting ''[[College GameDay (football TV program)|College Gameday]]'' at the [[University of Central Florida#Main campus|UCF campus]] for the first time in program history. It was UCF's second appearance on ''Gameday'' (they were also the visiting team at [[2005 South Carolina Gamecocks football team|South Carolina]] on September 1, 2005), and Cincinnati's first-ever appearance. The American Athletic Conference East Division title was at stake for both teams \u2014 UCF would clinch the division with a victory, and Cincinnati with a win would have a chance to clinch the division in the following week. The Knights routed the Bearcats, as quarterback [[McKenzie Milton]] threw for 268 yards, three touchdown passes, and ran for one touchdown. The Knights extended their winning streak to 23 games.\n\nCincinnati received the opening kickoff. The Bearcats suffered two false start penalties before running a single play, as crowd noise was already a factor. They were forced to punt, pinning the Knights back at their own 7 yard line. On their first play from scrimmage, Malik Clements sacked McKenzie Milton causing a fumble. Kimoni Fitz recovered the ball in the endzone for a Cincinnati touchdown. The extra point was missed, and the Bearcats led 6\u20130. The Knights went 3-and-out on their next possession, with Cincinnati's defense sacking Milton for the second time. The Bearcats could not capitalize, however, as Cole Smith missed an ensuring 38-yard goal attempt. The Knights offense finally got revved up, as Milton completed two straight passes to Dredrick Snelson (15 and 28 yards), then to Greg McCrae (27 yards). That set up Milton's 3-yard quarterback keeper for a touchdown and a 7\u20136 lead. The Bearcats drove 50 yards in ten plays to the UCF 24 yard line. With seconds left in the first quarter, Cole Smith's 41-yard field goal attempt was blocked, and recovered by Brandon Moore. Moore ran back the ball 53 yard to the Cincinnati 22 yard line. Three plays later, facing 3rd & 5, Adrian Killins Jr. caught a diving 17-yard touchdown pass from Milton for a 14\u20136 lead.\n\nUCF added another touchdown in the second quarter, stretching their lead to 21\u20136. In the final minutes of the half, the Bearcats went on a 15-play drive reaching as far as the UCF 12 yard line. Quarterback Desmond Ridder was sacked by Titus Davis for a loss of 2, then sacked again by Davis, this time fumbling. The Knights recovered, and took a knee to end the half.\n\nThe second half belonged to the Knights. Cincinnati committed two turnovers, and a turnover on downs, while the Knights added two more touchdowns, as well as a field goal. The Bearcats finally scored an offensive touchdown with just over 9 minutes remaining in regulation. The Knights won by the score of 38\u201313, and clinched the AAC east division.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/game/_/gameId/401019531|title=Milton shines, No. 11 UCF routs No. 19 Cincinnati 38-13|publisher=ESPN.com|date=November 18, 2018|accessdate=November 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===at South Florida===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''No. 8 Knights'''\n|R1=7 |R2=10 |R3=7 |R4=14\n|Home=Bulls\n|H1=0 |H2=3 |H3=7 |H4=0\n}}\n{{see also|2018 South Florida Bulls football team|War on I-4}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=\"center\"\n{{CollegeSecondaryHeader|team=UCF Knights|Overall record|Last meeting|Result}}\n|- align=\"center\"\n| 3\u20136\n| 2017\n| '''W''', 49\u201342\n|}\n{{-}}\nUCF faced [[2018 South Florida Bulls football team|South Florida]] in the [[South Florida\u2013UCF rivalry|War on I-4]] rivalry. The Knights defeated the Bulls 38\u201310, however, the game was marred by the devastating, season-ending injury to starting quarterback [[McKenzie Milton]]. It was the Knights second straight win in the rivalry, and their second win at Tampa. The Knights extended their active winning streak to 24 games, their away game winning streak to nine games, and tied an NCAA record with their 24th consecutive game scoring 30+ points.\n\nThe first quarter opened with punts by both teams, followed by interceptions by both teams. Nick Roberts of the Bulls picked off McKenzie Milton at the UCF 30, and returned the ball to the 12. The Knights defense stiffened, and the Bulls went for it on a 4th & 1 at the 3 yard line. Jordan Cronkrite was stuffed for no gain, and the Bulls turned the ball over on downs. Milton led the Knights on a 97-yard drive, including a 38-yard pass to Gabriel Davis, following a 14-yard touchdown pass to Davis, and a 7\u20130 lead.\n\nEarly in the second quarter, the Bulls drove to the UCF 35, and again went for it on a 4th down. For the second time, Jordan Cronkrite was tackled for no gain, and again the Bulls turned the ball over on downs. Six plays later, facing a 3rd & 7 at the USF 30, [[McKenzie Milton]] scrambled to the right and was upended after a diving tackle by Mazzi Wilkins. Milton suffered a \"traumatic\" knee injury,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/25366136/ucf-quarterback-mckenzie-milton-surgery-stabilize-knee\n|title=UCF quarterback McKenzie Milton has surgery to stabilize knee|publisher=ESPN.com|date=November 23, 2018|accessdate=November 25, 2018}}</ref> and was carted off the field and brought to [[Tampa General Hospital]] for surgery. After a lengthy delay, the game resumed with Matthew Wright kicking a 42-yard field goal for a 10\u20130 lead.\n\nDarriel Mack Jr. took over at quarterback, and despite the pall cast over the game, the Knights rallied behind him to soundly defeat the Bulls. Mack threw for 81 yards in substitute, but it was the running game and the defense that took over in the second half. Greg McCrae rushed 181 yards on 16 carries, and three touchdowns.

This was the second consecutive years the Knights hosted the Tigers in the conference championship game, and fourth meeting between the two schools in the past two seasons. With starting quarterback [[McKenzie Milton]] out for the season, the Knights rallied from a 17-point halftime deficit behind back-up quarterback Darriel Mack Jr. and won the conference championship for the second year in a row.\n\nUCF won the coin toss and elected to defer to the second half. On the fourth play of the game, Tigers running back [[Darrell Henderson]] broke free for a 62-yard touchdown run, and a quick 7\u20130 lead for Memphis. Knights quarterback Darriel Mack Jr. then fumbled away the ball at the UCF 27, leading to Henderson's second touchdown. The Knights finally got on the board, going 65 yards in 7 plays, with a 14-yard touchdown run by Greg McCrae. The Memphis rushing attack struck again quickly. Facing 3rd & 4 at their own 30 yard line, Patrick Taylor Jr. broke free for a 70-yard touchdown, and 21\u20137 lead. The miscues for the Knights continued, as Mack was sacked and fumbled, leading to a Tigers field goal and a shocking 24\u20137 lead at the end of the first quarter.\n\nAs the second quarter began, the Knights were driving into Tigers territory. A 20-yard completion from Mack to Gabriel Davis sparked the drive, and UCF eventually reached the red zone. Facing 3rd & Goal at the 6, Mack ran up the middle for an apparent touchdown, but the ball was fumbled and bouncing live into the endzone, dangerously close to going out-of-bounds. Michael Colubiale fell on the ball and recovered it for the UCF touchdown. [[Darrell Henderson]] continued to punish the Knights defense. On the second play of the next drive, he blasted for an 82-yard touchdown run, and a 31\u201314 Tigers lead. With under 4 minutes left in the half, a Memphis punt set UCF deep at their own 6 yard line. Mack threw a 44-yard pass to Gabriel Davis, then Greg McCrae broke free for a 47-yard run all the way to the 3 yard line. Mack's 4 yard touchdown pass to Jake Hescock made the score 31\u201321. The Knights forced a 3-and-out and Memphis punted with 1:50 remaining. But Otis Anderson muffed the punt, and Memphis recovered. With 21 seconds left in the half, [[Darrell Henderson]] connected with Sean Dykes for a 4-yard touchdown pass, and the Tigers led 38\u201321 at halftime.\n\nUCF received the ball to start the third quarter, and proceeded to dominate the second half. The Knights would score five touchdown on five consecutive drives, erasing a 17-point deficit, and held the Tigers to only three points in the second half. [[Darrell Henderson]] was held to only 3 yards in the second half, while Darriel Mack Jr. threw for a touchdown, and ran for four more. Mack sparked the rally with a 54-yard touchdown to a wide-open Otis Anderson, who ran untouched to the endzone. Later, Memphis managed to drive to the UCF 2 yard line, but Brady White's pass to the endzone fell incomplete off the fingertips of Damonte Coxie as he hit the ground. The Tigers settled for a field goal, and clung to a 41\u201335 lead. The Knights took their first lead of the game (42\u201341) with a touchdown in the opening seconds of the fourth quarter. With 9:26 remaining, Memphis kicker Riley Patterson missed a 36-yard field goal attempt, and the Knights held their lead.

The Tigers dominated time of possession (44:31) and racked up 555 yards of offense. The Knights offense was held to a season-low 250 total yards. Despite the loss, the Knights extended their [[NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision|NCAA Division I FBS]] record with their 26th consecutive game scoring 30 or more points.\n\nLSU won the coin toss and elected to receive. Clyde Edwards-Helaire took the opening kickoff back 77 yards all the way to the UCF 16 yard line. The Knights defense, however, stiffened, and kept the Tigers out of the endzone. Cole Tracy kicked a 24-yard field goal for the first points of the game. On their first drive, Darriel Mack Jr. led the Knights on a 6-play, 69-yard drive. A 25-yard touchdown run by Greg McCrae put the Knights up 7\u20133. LSU drove to the Knights 15 yard line, but quarterback Joe Burrow was intercepted by Brandon Moore at the 7 yard line. Moore ran the ball back 93 yards for the touchdown, and a 14\u20133 Knights lead. During the return, defensive lineman Joey Connors made a legal blindside block on Burrow, sending him to the ground, but he was able to recover. Nate Evans drew a penalty, however, for taunting Burrows after the play, and it was assessed on the kickoff.\n\nOn the next drive, LSU faced a 3rd down & 12 at the UCF 47 yard line. Kyle Gibson sacked quarterback [[Joe Burrow]] for a 6-yard loss, but Knights defender Randy Charlton was subsequently flagged for an [[unsportsmanlike conduct]] penalty after spiking the ball. The penalty proved costly as it gave LSU new life, and was a turning point in the game. The Tigers were awarded 15 yards and a first down. Six plays later they were in the endzone for a touchdown. Driving across midfield in the closing seconds of the first quarter, quarterback Darriel Mack Jr. was tackled on a run, and fumbled the ball, and LSU recovered.\n\nLSU scored touchdowns on their first two possessions of the second quarter, erasing the deficit, and pulling out to a 24\u201314 lead. Meanwhile, the Knights went [[Down (gridiron football)#Three-and-out|three-and-out]] twice, and also [[Turnover on downs|turned the ball over on downs]] in Tigers territory. With under two minutes left before halftime, LSU pinned UCF back at their own 5 yard line. Mack led the Knights on a 10-play, 95-yard drive, capped off by a much-needed score. Facing a 3rd down & 14 at the LSU 32 yard line, Mack threw a touchdown pass to Gabriel Davis at the back of the endzone with 4 seconds left. At halftime, LSU led 24\u201321.\n\nUCF got the ball to start the second half, but went three-and-out on their first three drives. LSU scored a 32-yard touchdown from Joe Burro to [[Ja'Marr Chase]], and also kicked a field goal to go up 34\u201321. With 3:56 left in the third quarter, Mack Loudermilk's punt was muffed by Tigers return man [[Justin Jefferson]], and UCF recovered at the 20 yard line. The Knights had to settle for a field goal, however, and kicker Matthew Wright trimmed the score to 34\u201324.\n\nLSU tacked on two more field goals in the fourth quarter, and stretched their lead to 40\u201324. With just over four minutes remaining in regulation, the Knights went on a swift 75-yard scoring drive. A 2-yard touchdown run by [[Taj McGowan]], followed by a two-point conversion, made the score 40\u201332 with 2:24 remaining. The Knights attempted an onside kick, but failed to recover.

Dismayed by its political turmoil and isolation, the queen invokes the [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|royal prerogative]] to dissolve parliament and take control over the county herself in an attempt to make Britain great again. Recognising the difficulties in re-conquering a quarter of the Earth's surface, the queen creates a new space organisation called SPIFFING (Special Planetary Investigative Force For Inhabiting New Galaxies<ref name=dev3/>) with the intention of establishing a galactic [[British Empire]]. After preparations made in [[Hounslow]] Mission Control, [[Big Ben]] is launched into space and a fleet of colonists set course for planets in the [[Milky Way]].\n\nOn board the HMSS Imperialise (a converted [[Mini|Mini Cooper]]), Captain Frank Lee English, along with his Welsh subordinate Sub-lieutenant Aled Jones, lead the colonisation effort. English is a [[middle class]], well mannered man with militaristic experience whereas Jones is wryly incompetent. After finding a barren planet fit for colonisation, the two land on it only to discover that it has been claimed by the French. After exploring the planet further, English and Jones discover two French colonists; the first man, Antoine, is a short [[Napoleon]] lookalike whereas the other is [[monkey hanger|a gorilla]] named Pierre. Antoine explains that he intends to [[Terraforming|terraform]] the planet and plant masses of vineyards so that he could produce fine wine, with his ultimate goal of ensuring that the people of his empire will eat [[cr\u00eapes]], wear berets and ride bicycles. English decides that he must remove the presence of the French along with their flag before he can legitimately claim the world. To accomplish this, he throws a frog and cheddar cheese at the French colonists, with both deciding to retreat to their [[Concorde]]. After replacing the [[Flag of France|Tricolore]] with the [[Union Jack]], the French concede defeat shortly before their Concorde explodes due to a fire. As English and Jones run for cover, a platoon of American soldiers arrive on the planet. Seeing that the world has already been claimed, they decide to leave, disliking the British weather.\n\n==Development==\n{{Quote box|quote=We knew it was always going to be difficult, we didn't have a proper back catalogue and we were this obscure Belfast-based indie developer.

Barr also reflected that the studio had some experience with outsource game development for other studios, and cited 1990s [[LucasArts]] point-and-click video games as a major inspiration.<ref name=\"dev2\">{{cite web|last1=Boke|first1=Ingmar|title=William Barr - Her Majesty\u2019s SPIFFING|url=http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/31300|publisher=Adventure Gamers|accessdate=2 April 2017|language=en|date=5 October 2016}}</ref> Since the game was to be the studio's debut title, a [[Kickstarter]] proposal was submitted in hopes that the game would receive adequate funding, but \"failed awfully\" according to Barr. The proposal ended shy of \u00a312,000, raised from a total of 338 backers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Prell|first1=Sam|title=Her Majesty's SPIFFING gives British space explouration another shot|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/25/her-majestys-spiffing-gives-british-space-explouration-another/|website=Engadget|publisher=AOL|accessdate=22 April 2017|date=25 October 2014}}</ref> The studio recognised the difficulties in creating a new video game as Barr reflected that his studio was an obscure [[indie game]] developer and did not have a back catalogue. Despite this, a second Kickstarter proposal was submitted in November 2014 to greater success.<ref>{{cite web|title=HM SPIFFING - a comedy 3D space themed adventure game|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/billygoat/hm-spiffing-a-comedy-3d-space-themed-adventure-gam|publisher=Kickstarter|accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref> The studio had asked for \u00a330,000 in funds and also received finance from [[Northern Ireland Screen]], as well as benefiting from UK video game tax breaks. Furthermore, the team had to use [[work for hire]] and a substantial overdraft.<ref name=\"dev3\">{{cite web|last1=Calvin|first1=Alex|title=BillyGoat Entertainment on the Galactic Empire, Kickstarter and the Brexit|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/billygoat-entertainment-on-the-galactic-empire-kickstarter-and-the-brexit/0173056|publisher=MCV|accessdate=2 April 2017|date=28 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nDue to the outcome of the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]], the game had to be rewritten and some jokes adjusted in order for some parts to make sense. For example, a [[self destruct]] button in the player-character's spaceship has an [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 50]] sticker imprinted on it, and the game also contains some references to [[Nigel Farage]]. Barr thought that the game could benefit from these references and the outcome of [[Brexit]] and even hoped that it would be marked as the \"Official Brexit Game\", but was concerned that a European audience would find its tone arrogant. In light of this, the team had to make some adjustments while trying to keep game's satirical tone. As a result of this, a late addition to the game was to add in the option of using either an English voice or an American voice. If American dialogue is chosen, a [[laugh track]] is played after an appropriate joke so that its audience would be able to understand whenever a joke is happening.<ref name=dev3/>\n\nThe team wanted to ensure that the player would have a closer connection with the protagonist as opposed to feeling of \"disconnect\" between the two in typical point-and-click adventure games. Barr compared the feeling of disorganisation with games like ''[[The Sims]]'' and ''[[The Curse of Monkey Island]]'', where he opined that the player always had to suggest an action as opposed to physically participating themselves.<ref name=dev1/> To counteract this, the team tried to alleviate the sense of disconnect by giving the player direct control of the protagonist, resembling that of an ordinary third-person adventure game. Barr took further comparison to traditional point-and-click titles which involved mundane gameplay tasks, and stressed that he wanted to make ''Her Majesty's SPIFFING'' more responsive and immersive. Barr also explained that keeping the Captain English on-screen at all times instead of viewing it through his [[Point-of-view shot|point of view]] would allow them to design a more personable and endearing character, as well as helping the player bond with English.<ref name=dev1/>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = 66% (XONE)<ref name=\"MCX\">{{cite web|title=Her Majesty's SPIFFING - Xbox One scores|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/her-majestys-spiffing|website=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=22 April 2017}}</ref> <br /> 60% (PC)<ref name=\"MCPC\">{{cite web|title=Her Majesty's SPIFFING - PC scores|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/her-majestys-spiffing|website=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=22 April 2017}}</ref> <br /> 74% (PS4)<ref name=\"MCP\">{{cite web|title=Her Majesty's SPIFFING - PlayStation 4 scores|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/her-majestys-spiffing|website=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=22 April 2017}}</ref> <br /> 68% (NS) <ref name=\"MCNS\">{{cite web|title=Her Majesty's SPIFFING - Nintendo Switch scores|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/her-majestys-spiffing|website=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref>\n| AdvGamers = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"adv\">{{cite web|last1=Mattson|first1=Peter|title=Her Majesty\u2019s SPIFFING review - AdventureGamers.com|url=http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/31838|publisher=Adventure Gamers|accessdate=22 April 2017|language=en|date=12 December 2016}}</ref>\n| IGN = 8/10<ref name=\"IGNES\">{{cite web|last1=Escudero|first1=Miguel|title=Her Majesty\u2019s Spiffin.

The plot follows Captain Frank Lee English and his Welsh subordinate Aled Jones in their attempts to establish a galactic [[British Empire]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Her Majesty's Spiffing gameplay.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The game features many elements from [[point-and-click]] [[adventure game]]s. In this screenshot, English, the player-character, is making a cup of tea.]]\n''Her Majesty's SPIFFING'' is [[point-and-click]]-style [[adventure game]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe game is set shortly after the United Kingdom's [[Brexit|withdrawal from the European Union]]. Dismayed by its political turmoil and isolation, the queen invokes the [[Royal prerogative in the United Kingdom|royal prerogative]] to dissolve parliament and take control over the county herself in an attempt to make Britain great again. Recognising the difficulties in re-conquering a quarter of the Earth's surface, the queen creates a new space organisation called SPIFFING (Special Planetary Investigative Force For Inhabiting New Galaxies<ref name=dev3/>) with the intention of establishing a galactic [[British Empire]]. After preparations made in [[Hounslow]] Mission Control, [[Big Ben]] is launched into space and a fleet of colonists set course for planets in the [[Milky Way]].\n\nOn board the HMSS Imperialise (a converted [[Mini|Mini Cooper]]), Captain Frank Lee English, along with his Welsh subordinate Sub-lieutenant Aled Jones, lead the colonisation effort. English is a [[middle class]], well mannered man with militaristic experience whereas Jones is wryly incompetent. After finding a barren planet fit for colonisation, the two land on it only to discover that it has been claimed by the French. After exploring the planet further, English and Jones discover two French colonists; the first man, Antoine, is a short [[Napoleon]] lookalike whereas the other is [[monkey hanger|a gorilla]] named Pierre. Antoine explains that he intends to [[Terraforming|terraform]] the planet and plant masses of vineyards so that he could produce fine wine, with his ultimate goal of ensuring that the people of his empire will eat [[cr\u00eapes]], wear berets and ride bicycles. English decides that he must remove the presence of the French along with their flag before he can legitimately claim the world. To accomplish this, he throws a frog and cheddar cheese at the French colonists, with both deciding to retreat to their [[Concorde]]. After replacing the [[Flag of France|Tricolore]] with the [[Union Jack]], the French concede defeat shortly before their Concorde explodes due to a fire. As English and Jones run for cover, a platoon of American soldiers arrive on the planet. Seeing that the world has already been claimed, they decide to leave, disliking the British weather.\n\n==Development==\n{{Quote box|quote=We knew it was always going to be difficult, we didn't have a proper back catalogue and we were this obscure Belfast-based indie developer.

The plan was always to try and do it again.|source=William Barr explaining the preliminary planning in an interview with ''[[MCV (magazine)|MCV]]''.<ref name=dev3/>|width=30em}}\nThe game was developed by [[Belfast]]-based Billy Goat Entertainment Ltd, a studio formerly specialising in animated advertisements for Irish television.<ref name=\"dev1\">{{cite web|last1=Kerr|first1=Chris|title=Game Design Deep Dive: Rethinking adventure games to create empathy|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/286958/Game_Design_Deep_Dive_Rethinking_adventure_games_to_create_empathy.php|website=Gamasutra|publisher=UBM|accessdate=2 April 2017|language=en|date=22 December 2016}}</ref> According to William Barr\u2014director and designer of ''Her Majesty's SPIFFING''\u2014the game was originally set to be a short animated film, however Barr realised that a film would be more difficult to fund than an [[adventure video game|adventure game]]. Barr also reflected that the studio had some experience with outsource game development for other studios, and cited 1990s [[LucasArts]] point-and-click video games as a major inspiration.<ref name=\"dev2\">{{cite web|last1=Boke|first1=Ingmar|title=William Barr - Her Majesty\u2019s SPIFFING|url=http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/31300|publisher=Adventure Gamers|accessdate=2 April 2017|language=en|date=5 October 2016}}</ref> Since the game was to be the studio's debut title, a [[Kickstarter]] proposal was submitted in hopes that the game would receive adequate funding, but \"failed awfully\" according to Barr. The proposal ended shy of \u00a312,000, raised from a total of 338 backers.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Prell|first1=Sam|title=Her Majesty's SPIFFING gives British space explouration another shot|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/10/25/her-majestys-spiffing-gives-british-space-explouration-another/|website=Engadget|publisher=AOL|accessdate=22 April 2017|date=25 October 2014}}</ref> The studio recognised the difficulties in creating a new video game as Barr reflected that his studio was an obscure [[indie game]] developer and did not have a back catalogue. Despite this, a second Kickstarter proposal was submitted in November 2014 to greater success.<ref>{{cite web|title=HM SPIFFING - a comedy 3D space themed adventure game|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/billygoat/hm-spiffing-a-comedy-3d-space-themed-adventure-gam|publisher=Kickstarter|accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref> The studio had asked for \u00a330,000 in funds and also received finance from [[Northern Ireland Screen]], as well as benefiting from UK video game tax breaks. Furthermore, the team had to use [[work for hire]] and a substantial overdraft.<ref name=\"dev3\">{{cite web|last1=Calvin|first1=Alex|title=BillyGoat Entertainment on the Galactic Empire, Kickstarter and the Brexit|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/read/billygoat-entertainment-on-the-galactic-empire-kickstarter-and-the-brexit/0173056|publisher=MCV|accessdate=2 April 2017|date=28 September 2016}}</ref>\n\nDue to the outcome of the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]], the game had to be rewritten and some jokes adjusted in order for some parts to make sense. For example, a [[self destruct]] button in the player-character's spaceship has an [[Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 50]] sticker imprinted on it, and the game also contains some references to [[Nigel Farage]]. Barr thought that the game could benefit from these references and the outcome of [[Brexit]] and even hoped that it would be marked as the \"Official Brexit Game\", but was concerned that a European audience would find its tone arrogant. In light of this, the team had to make some adjustments while trying to keep game's satirical tone. As a result of this, a late addition to the game was to add in the option of using either an English voice or an American voice. If American dialogue is chosen, a [[laugh track]] is played after an appropriate joke so that its audience would be able to understand whenever a joke is happening.<ref name=dev3/>\n\nThe team wanted to ensure that the player would have a closer connection with the protagonist as opposed to feeling of \"disconnect\" between the two in typical point-and-click adventure games. Barr compared the feeling of disorganisation with games like ''[[The Sims]]'' and ''[[The Curse of Monkey Island]]'', where he opined that the player always had to suggest an action as opposed to physically participating themselves.<ref name=dev1/> To counteract this, the team tried to alleviate the sense of disconnect by giving the player direct control of the protagonist, resembling that of an ordinary third-person adventure game. Barr took further comparison to traditional point-and-click titles which involved mundane gameplay tasks, and stressed that he wanted to make ''Her Majesty's SPIFFING'' more responsive and immersive. Barr also explained that keeping the Captain English on-screen at all times instead of viewing it through his [[Point-of-view shot|point of view]] would allow them to design a more personable and endearing character, as well as helping the player bond with English.<ref name=dev1/>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = 66% (XONE)<ref name=\"MCX\">{{cite web|title=Her Majesty's SPIFFING - Xbox One scores|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-one/her-majestys-spiffing|website=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=22 April 2017}}</ref> <br /> 60% (PC)<ref name=\"MCPC\">{{cite web|title=Her Majesty's SPIFFING - PC scores|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/her-majestys-spiffing|website=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=22 April 2017}}</ref> <br /> 74% (PS4)<ref name=\"MCP\">{{cite web|title=Her Majesty's SPIFFING - PlayStation 4 scores|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/her-majestys-spiffing|website=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=22 April 2017}}</ref> <br /> 68% (NS) <ref name=\"MCNS\">{{cite web|title=Her Majesty's SPIFFING - Nintendo Switch scores|url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/switch/her-majestys-spiffing|website=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=20 March 2018}}</ref>\n| AdvGamers = {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"adv\">{{cite web|last1=Mattson|first1=Peter|title=Her Majesty\u2019s SPIFFING review - AdventureGamers.com|url=http://www.adventuregamers.com/articles/view/31838|publisher=Adventure Gamers|accessdate=22 April 2017|language=en|date=12 December 2016}}</ref>\n| IGN = 8/10<ref name=\"IGNES\">{{cite web|last1=Escudero|first1=Miguel|title=Her Majesty\u2019s Spiffin.

Collins collaborated with Ray and Ross to write the screenplay. The screenplay expanded the character of [[Seneca Crane]] to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience and Ross added several scenes between Crane and [[Coriolanus Snow]].

In District 12, after her younger sister Primrose is chosen, 16-year old [[Katniss Everdeen]] volunteers to take her place. Primrose gives Katniss a mockingjay pin. She and fellow tribute [[Peeta Mellark]] are then escorted to the Capitol by their chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, the only Games winner from District 12. Haymitch stresses the importance of gaining sponsors, as they can provide potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. While training, Katniss observes the \"Careers\" (Marvel, Glimmer, Cato and Clove), volunteers from the wealthy Districts 1 and 2 who have trained for the Games from an early age. During a televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta expresses his love for Katniss, which she initially sees as an attempt to attract sponsors; she later learns his admission is genuine.\n\nAt the start of the Games, Katniss ignores Haymitch's advice and grabs some of the supplies placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death. Half of the 24 tributes die in the initial melee, and only eleven, including the Careers, survive the first day. Katniss tries to stay away from the others, but Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the Careers to wait her out. The next morning, Katniss notices Rue, District 11's young female tribute, hiding in an adjacent tree. Rue draws her attention to a nest of [[The Hunger Games universe#Tracker Jackers|tracker jackers]], genetically modified poisonous wasps. Using a knife, Katniss saws off the branch holding the nest, causing it to fall on the Careers sleeping below; Glimmer dies, but the others escape. Katniss becomes disoriented from being stung a few times. Peeta returns and tells her to flee.\n\nRue helps Katniss recover, and they become friends and allies. Katniss destroys the supplies the Careers stockpiled by detonating mines guarding them, while Rue provides a distraction. Katniss later finds and frees Rue from a trap, but Marvel throws a spear at Katniss which impales Rue. Katniss kills him with an arrow. She comforts Rue and, after she dies, adorns her body with flowers. This triggers a riot in District 11. President Coriolanus Snow warns Crane about the unrest.\n\nHaymitch persuades Crane to change the rules to allow two winners provided they are from the same district, suggesting that this will pacify the public. After the announcement, Katniss finds a gravely wounded Peeta. Another announcement promises that what each survivor needs the most will be provided at the Cornucopia the next morning. Despite Peeta's vehement opposition, Katniss leaves to get medicine for him, but she is ambushed and overpowered by Clove, who gloats about Rue's death and prepares to kill her. [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Thresh|Thresh]], District 11's male tribute, overhears and kills Clove. He spares Katniss once, for Rue's sake. The medicine heals Peeta overnight.\n\nWhile hunting for food, Katniss hears a cannon go off, signalling a death. She races to Peeta, who has unwittingly collected deadly nightlock berries. They discover \"Foxface\", District 5's female tribute, dead from eating what she assumed were edible berries from watching Peeta.\n\nCrane then unleashes genetically modified beasts. They kill Thresh and force Katniss, Peeta, and Cato - the last three survivors - onto the Cornucopia's roof. Cato gets Peeta in a headlock and uses him as a human shield against Katniss's bow. Peeta directs Katniss to shoot Cato's hand, enabling Peeta to throw him to the beasts below. Katniss kills him with an arrow to end his suffering.\n\nCrane then revokes the rule change allowing two victors to win. Peeta urges Katniss to shoot him, but she convinces him to eat nightlock together. Just before they do, Crane hastily declares them co-victors. Afterward, Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made enemies through these acts of defiance. Snow has Crane locked in a room with nightlock berries.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Jennifer Lawrence SDCC 2015.jpg|thumb|198px|[[Jennifer Lawrence]] wore a dark brown wig to play Katniss.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/43990-hows-jennifer-lawrences-wig-in-mockingjay-holding-up-lets-see-here-photos|title=How's J Law's 'Mockingjay' Wig Holding Up?|website=Bustle|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>]]\n{{See also|List of The Hunger Games characters}}\n{{See also|List of The Hunger Games cast members}}\n<!--Reordered to match billing of primary source: the film -->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Katniss Everdeen]]<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/jennifer-lawrence-gets-lead-role-hunger-games-25482 | title=Jennifer Lawrence Gets Lead Role in 'The Hunger Games' | author=Joshua L.

The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room.\"<ref name=\"nyt-qanda\" /> Ross and [[visual effects supervisor]] Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal [[dei ex machina]] Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that \"we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [animals] that just appear at the end of the movie?

[[Katniss Everdeen]] ([[Jennifer Lawrence]]) volunteers to take her younger sister's place, and with her district's male tribute, [[Peeta Mellark]] ([[Josh Hutcherson]]), travels to the Capitol to train and compete in the games.\n\nDevelopment of ''The Hunger Games'' began in March 2009 when [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] entered into a co-production agreement with [[Color Force]], which had acquired the rights a few weeks earlier. Collins collaborated with Ray and Ross to write the screenplay. The screenplay expanded the character of [[Seneca Crane]] to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience and Ross added several scenes between Crane and [[Coriolanus Snow]]. The main characters were cast between March and May 2011.

In District 12, after her younger sister Primrose is chosen, 16-year old [[Katniss Everdeen]] volunteers to take her place. Primrose gives Katniss a mockingjay pin. She and fellow tribute [[Peeta Mellark]] are then escorted to the Capitol by their chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, the only Games winner from District 12. Haymitch stresses the importance of gaining sponsors, as they can provide potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. While training, Katniss observes the \"Careers\" (Marvel, Glimmer, Cato and Clove), volunteers from the wealthy Districts 1 and 2 who have trained for the Games from an early age. During a televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta expresses his love for Katniss, which she initially sees as an attempt to attract sponsors; she later learns his admission is genuine.\n\nAt the start of the Games, Katniss ignores Haymitch's advice and grabs some of the supplies placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death. Half of the 24 tributes die in the initial melee, and only eleven, including the Careers, survive the first day. Katniss tries to stay away from the others, but Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the Careers to wait her out. The next morning, Katniss notices Rue, District 11's young female tribute, hiding in an adjacent tree. Rue draws her attention to a nest of [[The Hunger Games universe#Tracker Jackers|tracker jackers]], genetically modified poisonous wasps. Using a knife, Katniss saws off the branch holding the nest, causing it to fall on the Careers sleeping below; Glimmer dies, but the others escape. Katniss becomes disoriented from being stung a few times. Peeta returns and tells her to flee.\n\nRue helps Katniss recover, and they become friends and allies. Katniss destroys the supplies the Careers stockpiled by detonating mines guarding them, while Rue provides a distraction. Katniss later finds and frees Rue from a trap, but Marvel throws a spear at Katniss which impales Rue. Katniss kills him with an arrow. She comforts Rue and, after she dies, adorns her body with flowers. This triggers a riot in District 11. President Coriolanus Snow warns Crane about the unrest.\n\nHaymitch persuades Crane to change the rules to allow two winners provided they are from the same district, suggesting that this will pacify the public. After the announcement, Katniss finds a gravely wounded Peeta. Another announcement promises that what each survivor needs the most will be provided at the Cornucopia the next morning. Despite Peeta's vehement opposition, Katniss leaves to get medicine for him, but she is ambushed and overpowered by Clove, who gloats about Rue's death and prepares to kill her. [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Thresh|Thresh]], District 11's male tribute, overhears and kills Clove. He spares Katniss once, for Rue's sake. The medicine heals Peeta overnight.\n\nWhile hunting for food, Katniss hears a cannon go off, signalling a death. She races to Peeta, who has unwittingly collected deadly nightlock berries. They discover \"Foxface\", District 5's female tribute, dead from eating what she assumed were edible berries from watching Peeta.\n\nCrane then unleashes genetically modified beasts. They kill Thresh and force Katniss, Peeta, and Cato - the last three survivors - onto the Cornucopia's roof. Cato gets Peeta in a headlock and uses him as a human shield against Katniss's bow. Peeta directs Katniss to shoot Cato's hand, enabling Peeta to throw him to the beasts below. Katniss kills him with an arrow to end his suffering.\n\nCrane then revokes the rule change allowing two victors to win. Peeta urges Katniss to shoot him, but she convinces him to eat nightlock together. Just before they do, Crane hastily declares them co-victors. Afterward, Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made enemies through these acts of defiance. Snow has Crane locked in a room with nightlock berries.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Jennifer Lawrence SDCC 2015.jpg|thumb|198px|[[Jennifer Lawrence]] wore a dark brown wig to play Katniss.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/43990-hows-jennifer-lawrences-wig-in-mockingjay-holding-up-lets-see-here-photos|title=How's J Law's 'Mockingjay' Wig Holding Up?|website=Bustle|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>]]\n{{See also|List of The Hunger Games characters}}\n{{See also|List of The Hunger Games cast members}}\n<!--Reordered to match billing of primary source: the film -->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Katniss Everdeen]]<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/jennifer-lawrence-gets-lead-role-hunger-games-25482 | title=Jennifer Lawrence Gets Lead Role in 'The Hunger Games' | author=Joshua L.

The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room.\"<ref name=\"nyt-qanda\" /> Ross and [[visual effects supervisor]] Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal [[dei ex machina]] Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that \"we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [animals] that just appear at the end of the movie?
