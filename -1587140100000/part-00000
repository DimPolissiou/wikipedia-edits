{"title_page": "Sten Lex", "text_new": "{{Notability|date=December 2011}}\n\n'''Sten''' (born 1982, [[Rome]]) and '''Lex''' (born 1982, [[Taranto]]), known as '''Sten & Lex''', are two [[Italy|Italian]] street artists.\n\nSten & Lex have been doing stencils on the street since 2000/2001 and today their work is part of the urban landscape in [[London]], [[Paris]], [[Barcelona]], [[New York City]], and in their home town of [[Rome]]. During that early period in Rome, and Italy in general, there wasn't a strong stencil culture such as there was in France, and Sten & Lex are seen by many as the pioneers of \"[[Stencil]] [[Graffiti]]\" in Italy and were the first to be considered \"[[stencil]] artists\". All the work of Sten & Lex results from an individual path that developed far from art academies and design institutes and far from a classic [[writing]] and [[graffiti]] background. The duo are best known in the history of [[stencil]]-making for introducing the halftone stencil technique, in which the greater part of their stencil portraits is composed of thousands of lines. They usually produce portraits of anonymous people they have photographed themselves or found in family photos album.\n\nIn 2008, they took part in the [[Cans Festival]] : Banksy invited thirty-nine artists from around the world, including, [[Prism (street artist)|Prism]], [[Blek le Rat|Blek]], [[Faile (artist)|Faile]], [[Vhils (artists)|Vhils]], [[Vexta]], to exhibit their work in an abandoned tunnel near [[Leake Street]] in South East [[London]].[[File:Sten lex banksy, cans festival, londra 2008.jpg|thumb|Banksy, Sten, Lex, Cans Festival, London 2008]]\n\nIn 2009, they started producing what they call \"[[Stencil]] [[Poster]]\".The technique derives from the union of two of the main techniques of [[street art]]: [[Stencil]] and [[Poster]]. They glue a [[stencil]] cut from paper on the wall and paint over it. They then destroy the matrix and apply its scraps to the wall, thus allowing them to become part of the work itself. The bits of matrix applied to the wall wear out over time, producing work in a state of constant change. Unlike [[stencil]] work in general, the images thus created cannot be reproduced, rendering each piece original and unique. A book documenting this technique entitled \"Stencil Poster\" was published in 2009 by [[Drago (publisher)|Drago]].\n\nIn 2011, they entered the contemporary art world with large-scale pieces in museums, such as the [[Museum of Contemporary Art of Rome]] (MACRO) in Rome, Italy and the Carandente Museum in Spoleto, Italy. That same year, they participated in major international festivals, such as the \"Walk This Way\" Festival in Koge, Denmark and the \"Nuart\" Festival in Stavanger, Norway, contributing to the growth of their fame and popularity.\n\n2012 saw the production of monumental projects that led to Sten Lex being recognized as emerging artists increasingly in demand. They were invited to the \"Living Walls\" show in Atlanta, USA; the Centre de la Gravure et de l\u2019Image imprim\u00e9e in La Louvi\u00e8re, Belgium, as well as to the \"Outer Spaces\" outdoor show in Poznan, Poland and the \"Open Walls\" in Baltimore, USA.\n\nIn 2012, they also presented their work in a large solo show at the [[Magda Danysz Gallery]] in Paris.

The fighting followed a lull in the [[Civil war in Iraq (2006-07)|Civil war in Iraq]] and was the most serious crisis since October 2007.\n\n==Background==\nIn 2007, the Iraqi Army moved 4 [[brigade]]s, including a [[tank]] brigade, and a [[special forces]] battalion to [[Basra]], replacing the existing brigade stationed there which was reported to have been corrupt.<ref>[http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2007/12/basrah_the_untold_st.php Basrah: Missing the Iraqi Security Force Deployment \u2013 Long War Journal]</ref> The Iraqi National Police also moved two battalions to Basra. In August 2007, the Iraqi Army established the [[Iraqi Army#Structure|Basra Operational Command]] under the command of [[Mohan al-Furayji|General Mohan]]. The Vice Chief of Staff of the Iraqi Joint Staff said \"We do not have enough forces there. That is why we are having a new division, the 14th Division, to be built in Basrah, especially with the possibility that the British might be leaving us in time.\"<ref>[http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2007/09/iraqi_security_force_2.php Iraqi Security Forces Order of Battle: September 2007 Update \u2013 Long War Journal]</ref>\n\nSince August 2007, a unilateral ceasefire was in place, imposed by [[Muqtada al-Sadr]] on his militia, the [[Mahdi Army]]. However raids were continuing on so-called \"rogue\" elements of the militia and tensions were building. In February, Sadr extended the ceasefire even though many of his commanders were against it. Despite the extension raids continued and members of the militia accused the members of the security forces of being infiltrated by their rival militia, the [[Badr Organization|Badr Brigade]].\n\n==The Campaign==\nOn 23 March, Easter Sunday [[Iran]]ian trained militants of the Mahdi Army fired 107mm rockets on the heavily fortified [[Green Zone]] in [[Baghdad]] killing Paul Converse, a U.S. government employee, and wounding several other employees and contractors.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/07/AR2008040702533.html]</ref> At least 12 Iraqi civilians were also killed by rockets from Sadr City that missed the Green Zone and hit the civilian sectors around the Zone.<ref>[http://antiwar.com/updates/?articleid=12569 Sunday: 4 US Soldiers, 91 Iraqis Killed; 152 Wounded \u2013 Antiwar.com]</ref>\n\n===Basra operation===\n{{Main|Battle of Basra (2008)}}\nOn 25 March, the Iraqi Army and police attacked the second largest Iraqi city, Basra, which had for the most part been under Mahdi Army control for the past seven months since the [[Siege of U.K. bases in Basra|British troop withdrawal]] from the city in the beginning of September the previous year. Since then the city was in the middle of a turf war between three different militias, including the Mahdi Army, for the control of the [[oil]] exports which had been dominated by the Black Market.\n\nStreet fighting spread through six neighbourhoods after the government operation started at 2:00am. Plumes of smoke were seen over the northern neighbourhoods, and by the end of the first day of fighting government forces took the center of the city but the Mahdi Army was still holding on to the northern part of the city.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nOn 26 March, the [[Iraqi Prime Minister]] issued an ultimatum to the Mahdi Army to surrender within 72 hours.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nOn 28 March, U.S. aircraft bombed two targets in the city while being supported by British planes, a day after militiamen paraded in the city with some 20 captured soldiers and a captured Iraqi Army [[Humvee]]. At least two Iraqi Army armoured vehicles and a [[BMP-1|BMP infantry fighting vehicle]] were seen destroyed on the streets.\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mahdi Army fighters take up positions during the street fighting in Basra.jpg|225px|left|thumb|Mahdi Army fighters take up positions during the street fighting in Basra 26 March 2008.]] -->\nBy 29 March, the Iraqi military offensive against the city was faltering in the face of stiff resistance as the 72-hour ultimatum by the government passed and the militants refused to surrender.\n\nOn 31 March, the fighting in the city ended after al-Sadr's declaration of a new cease-fire. By that point the Mahdi Army was still in control of about 75% of the city.\n\nUp to 236 people were killed and 1,200 wounded in the fighting in districts of central and northern Basra. 921 members of the security forces, including 421 policemen and a full Iraqi Army battalion of 500 men, deserted, defected or were captured.\n\nClashes between militiamen and al-Maliki's tribe in [[Qurna, Iraq|Qurna]], north of Basra, left 7 dead, including a policeman and a civilian, and 2 wounded on both sides.<ref>[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/212/story/31877.html Round-up of Daily Violence in Iraq, Friday March 28, 2008 McClatchy Washington Bureau] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402181527/http://www.mcclatchydc.com/212/story/31877.html |date=2 April 2008 }}</ref>\n<ref>[http://www.aswataliraq.info/look/english/article.tpl?IdLanguage=1&IdPublication=4&NrArticle=74543&NrIssue=2&NrSection=1 5 killed, 2 wounded in clashes in Basra \u2013 Aswat Aliraq] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402095205/http://www.aswataliraq.info/look/english/article.tpl?IdLanguage=1&IdPublication=4&NrArticle=74543&NrIssue=2&NrSection=1 |date=2 April 2008 }}</ref>\n<ref>[http://www.aswataliraq.info/look/english/article.tpl?IdLanguage=1&IdPublication=4&NrArticle=73950&NrIssue=2&NrSection=1 Civilian killed, policeman wounded in clashes in Basra \u2013 Aswat Aliraq] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402095201/http://www.aswataliraq.info/look/english/article.tpl?IdLanguage=1&IdPublication=4&NrArticle=73950&NrIssue=2&NrSection=1 |date=2 April 2008 }}</ref>\n\nMortars also killed two policemen and wounded 23 people, including 13 policemen, in [[Karma, Iraq|Karma]], a town {{convert|50|mi|km}} north of Basra.<ref>[http://wiredispatch.com/news/?id=105058 FACTBOX-Security developments in Iraq, March 28 \u2013 Reuters] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402100251/http://wiredispatch.com/news/?id=105058 |date=2 April 2008 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing the cease-fire in Basra there were still sporadic clashes in the city for some time leaving at least 32 civilians, 34 militants, five policemen and one U.S. Marine dead.

The fighting followed a lull in the [[Civil war in Iraq (2006-07)|Civil war in Iraq]] and was the most serious crisis since October 2007.\n\n==Background==\nIn 2007, the Iraqi Army moved 4 [[brigade]]s, including a [[tank]] brigade, and a [[special forces]] battalion to [[Basra]], replacing the existing brigade stationed there which was reported to have been corrupt.<ref>[http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2007/12/basrah_the_untold_st.php Basrah: Missing the Iraqi Security Force Deployment \u2013 Long War Journal]</ref> The Iraqi National Police also moved two battalions to Basra. In August 2007, the Iraqi Army established the [[Iraqi Army#Structure|Basra Operational Command]] under the command of [[Mohan al-Furayji|General Mohan]]. The Vice Chief of Staff of the Iraqi Joint Staff said \"We do not have enough forces there.

However raids were continuing on so-called \"rogue\" elements of the militia and tensions were building. In February, Sadr extended the ceasefire even though many of his commanders were against it. Despite the extension raids continued and members of the militia accused the members of the security forces of being infiltrated by their rival militia, the [[Badr Organization|Badr Brigade]].\n\n==The Campaign==\nOn 23 March, Easter Sunday [[Iran]]ian trained militants of the Mahdi Army fired 107mm rockets on the heavily fortified [[Green Zone]] in [[Baghdad]] killing Paul Converse, a U.S. government employee, and wounding several other employees and contractors.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/07/AR2008040702533.html]</ref> At least 12 Iraqi civilians were also killed by rockets from Sadr City that missed the Green Zone and hit the civilian sectors around the Zone.<ref>[http://antiwar.com/updates/?articleid=12569 Sunday: 4 US Soldiers, 91 Iraqis Killed; 152 Wounded \u2013 Antiwar.com]</ref>\n\n===Basra operation===\n{{Main|Battle of Basra (2008)}}\nOn 25 March, the Iraqi Army and police attacked the second largest Iraqi city, Basra, which had for the most part been under Mahdi Army control for the past seven months since the [[Siege of U.K. bases in Basra|British troop withdrawal]] from the city in the beginning of September the previous year. Since then the city was in the middle of a turf war between three different militias, including the Mahdi Army, for the control of the [[oil]] exports which had been dominated by the Black Market.\n\nStreet fighting spread through six neighbourhoods after the government operation started at 2:00am.
