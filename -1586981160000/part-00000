It led to the abandonment of the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Earl of Newcastle's]] campaign in [[Lincolnshire]] and the re-establishment of Parliament's presence in [[Yorkshire]].\n\n==Prelude==\n===Lincolnshire Campaign===\nAfter the victory over the army of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]] under [[Ferdinando Fairfax, 2nd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Lord Fairfax]] and Sir [[Thomas Fairfax, 3rd Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]] at the [[Battle of Adwalton Moor]] on 30 June 1643, the Earl of Newcastle advanced with the main northern [[Cavalier|Royalist]] army into [[Lincolnshire]]. At this point in the civil war, Royalist fortunes were high, and Newcastle's advance joined [[Ralph Hopton|Lord Hopton]]'s and [[Charles I of England|King Charles]]'s armies in a three-pronged advance on London.<ref name=britishcivilwars>1643: Civil War in Yorkshire.</ref>\n<ref name=bolingbroke>Bolingbroke Castle: The Siege of 1643.</ref>\n\n===Gainsborough and Lincoln===\n{{main|Battle of Gainsborough}}\n\nOn 16 July 1643, [[Francis Willoughby, 5th Baron Willoughby of Parham|Lord Willoughby]] captured [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire|Gainsborough]] for Parliament, only to be immediately besieged by the Royalists under Sir [[Charles Cavendish (1620-1643)|Charles Cavendish]].<ref name=bolingbroke/> Parliament sent a relieving force under Sir [[John Meldrum]] and Colonel [[Oliver Cromwell]], which beat the Royalists at the [[Battle of Gainsborough]] on 28 July. However, the arrival of Newcastle's main army forced the abandonment of Gainsborough, which, with [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], fell quickly to the Royalists.\n\n===Fairfaxes===\nThe Fairfaxes, meanwhile, having escaped from Adwalton Moor, made their ways separately to Hull, then the only remaining Parliamentary stronghold in Yorkshire.<ref name=2ndsiege>Yorkshire History \u2013 The Second Siege of Hull.</ref> Sir [[Sir John Hotham, 1st Baronet|John Hotham]], the [[military governor]] of Hull, was arrested and removed by Major-General [[Robert Overton]] and the people of Hull in July 1643 after conspiring with Newcastle to surrender the city.<ref>Maj.General Robert Overton.</ref> Lord Fairfax was invited to take up the post by the townsfolk of Hull on 22 July.<ref name=2ndsiege/> He fortified Hull, established a base at [[Beverley]], and set about vigorous raids on Royalist garrisons in Yorkshire.<ref name=britishcivilwars/>\n\nNewcastle now faced a choice. He had [[Boston, Lincolnshire|Boston]] and the [[Eastern Association]] apparently open in front of him, but faced the prospect of the still-intact army of Lord Fairfax behind him in Hull. Fairfax's attack on Stamford Bridge, near York, prompted Newcastle that he must deal with this threat to his rear, and he turned his army back north to face Fairfax,<ref name=britishcivilwars/> leaving garrisons in the captured Lincolnshire towns and strongholds.\n\n===Beverley===\nNewcastle advanced with 12,000 foot and 4,000 horse, together with his [[siege train]] including the guns \"Gog\" and \"Magog\". Fairfax's force of 1,800 foot and 20 troops of horse, decided to retreat to the [[fortifications of Hull]].

The Royalist [[artillery|siege artillery]] began the bombardment on 2 September, but without great effect because the works were too far away from the city walls, the shot being almost spent by the time it reached the city. The Royalists attempted to push their earthworks nearer to make their guns more effective. However, one such work, Fort Royal, was taken by the defenders and destroyed within a week of construction.<ref name=britishcivilwars/>\n\nOn 14 September, Fairfax ordered the sluices be opened and the banks of the Humber be broken, as had happened in the [[Siege of Hull (1642)|first siege of Hull]] in 1642.

Sir [[John Meldrum]] brought 500 further reinforcements to the defenders.\n\nOn 9 October, the Royalists attempted to storm the defences. Although some outlying works were captured, the assault failed to seize the city. The defenders launched a counterattack two days later on 11 October, with 1,500 men comprising soldiers from the garrison, sailors from the warships and townspeople. Led by Meldrum, the force was divided into two columns under Colonel [[John Lambert (General)|John Lambert]] and Colonel Thomas Rainsborough of the ''Lion''. This attack pushed back the Royalists and captured several emplacements and heavy guns.\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn 12 October, Newcastle admitted defeat and lifted the siege. He withdrew to [[York]]. The lifting of the siege was marked by an annual public holiday in Hull until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]].<ref name=2ndsiege/>\n\nOn 11 October, the Royalists had been defeated at the [[Battle of Winceby]] in Lincolnshire.

The ability to prescribe drugs for uses beyond the officially approved indications is commonly used to good effect by healthcare providers. For example, [[methotrexate]] is commonly used off-label because its immunomodulatory effects relieve various disorders.<ref name=\"pmid_21267732\">{{Citation |last=Briem |first=S |display-authors=etal |year=2011 |title=[Current \"off label use\" of methotrexate for chronic inflammatory rheumatic diseases] |journal=Z Rheumatol |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=123\u2013128 |pmid=21267732 |doi=10.1007/s00393-010-0685-2 |postscript=.}}</ref> However, off-label use can entail health risks and differences in [[legal liability]]. [[Pharmaceutical marketing|Marketing of pharmaceuticals]] for off-label use is usually prohibited.\n\n==Indications and labeling laws==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nAn ''[[Indication (medicine)|indication]]'' is when a drug is medically appropriate for a given condition; an ''[[approved indication]]'' is when a government [[drug regulatory agency]] formally agrees that the drug is medically appropriate for the named condition.  Indications may depend not only upon the medical condition that is being treated, but also upon other factors, such as dose, the patient's age, size and sex, whether the patient is pregnant or breastfeeding, and other medical conditions.  For example, aspirin is generally indicated for a headache, but it is not indicated for headaches in people with an allergic reaction to it.\n\nWhen the drug's manufacturer has received a [[marketing authorisation]] from the government agency, then it is allowed to promote the drug for the specific, agreed-upon approved indications in that country.  All legally approved indications are listed on the drug [[package insert]] or \"label\".  Drug manufacturers are not legally permitted to encourage the use of regulated drugs for any indications that have not been formally approved by the country's government, even if significant scientific evidence exists for that unapproved indication, or even if another country's drug agency has approved that indication.\n\nHowever, healthcare providers are not required to limit prescriptions or recommendations to the indications approved by their country's drug regulatory agency, and in fact the [[standard of care]] for many conditions involves off-label uses, either as first-line therapy or as a subsequent line. In other words, properly understanding why off-label use is common and usually appropriate, rather than rare and usually inappropriate, requires understanding that the distinction between regulatory-agency-approved use versus off-label use is not the same distinction as safe versus unsafe, tested versus untested, or good versus bad; it is a marker of ''increased certainty'' about a use being good (safe and effective), as opposed to ''less certainty''\u2014rather than a marker of good as opposed to bad. Regulatory approval for an indication requires a body of evidence that costs money to assemble, and as with [[evidence-based medicine]] generally, the desire for a vast, high-quality evidence base is an ideal that real-world practice can only aspire to and further approach, rather than completely match; there may not be enough resources to test every drug for every possible or logical indication to an exhaustive degree. Regulation of [[therapy freedom]] thus takes [[everything which is not forbidden is allowed|an approach in which anything not explicitly forbidden is allowed rather than an approach in which anything not explicitly allowed is forbidden]], and it is accepted that drugs may be used in off-label ways as long as a competent professional prescribes them.\n\n==Frequency of off-label use==\n\nOff-label use is very common. Generic drugs generally have no sponsor as their indications and use expands, and incentives are limited to initiate new clinical trials to generate additional data for approval agencies to expand indications of proprietary drugs.<ref name=nejm/> Up to one-fifth of all drugs are prescribed off-label and amongst psychiatric drugs, off-label use rises to 31%.<ref name = radley>{{cite journal |author1=David C.

Therefore, drugs are more likely to be used \"off-label\" \u2013 typically, this involves the use of a human medication in an animal, where there is no corresponding medication licensed for that species.  This problem is compounded in \"exotic\" species (such as reptiles and rodents) where there are very few, if any licensed medications. In addition, especially in [[Europe]], [[equine veterinarian]]s are forced to use many drugs off-label, as the horse is classified as a \"food-producing animal\" and many veterinary drugs are labeled specifically not for use in animals intended for human consumption.\n\nThis practice is permitted by the [[Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act of 1994]] (P.L. 103-396).

[[Pharmaceutical marketing|Marketing of pharmaceuticals]] for off-label use is usually prohibited.\n\n==Indications and labeling laws==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2020}}\nAn ''[[Indication (medicine)|indication]]'' is when a drug is medically appropriate for a given condition; an ''[[approved indication]]'' is when a government [[drug regulatory agency]] formally agrees that the drug is medically appropriate for the named condition.  Indications may depend not only upon the medical condition that is being treated, but also upon other factors, such as dose, the patient's age, size and sex, whether the patient is pregnant or breastfeeding, and other medical conditions.  For example, aspirin is generally indicated for a headache, but it is not indicated for headaches in people with an allergic reaction to it.\n\nWhen the drug's manufacturer has received a [[marketing authorisation]] from the government agency, then it is allowed to promote the drug for the specific, agreed-upon approved indications in that country.  All legally approved indications are listed on the drug [[package insert]] or \"label\".  Drug manufacturers are not legally permitted to encourage the use of regulated drugs for any indications that have not been formally approved by the country's government, even if significant scientific evidence exists for that unapproved indication, or even if another country's drug agency has approved that indication.\n\nHowever, healthcare providers are not required to limit prescriptions or recommendations to the indications approved by their country's drug regulatory agency, and in fact the [[standard of care]] for many conditions involves off-label uses, either as first-line therapy or as a subsequent line. In other words, properly understanding why off-label use is common and usually appropriate, rather than rare and usually inappropriate, requires understanding that the distinction between regulatory-agency-approved use versus off-label use is not the same distinction as safe versus unsafe, tested versus untested, or good versus bad; it is a marker of ''increased certainty'' about a use being good (safe and effective), as opposed to ''less certainty''\u2014rather than a marker of good as opposed to bad. Regulatory approval for an indication requires a body of evidence that costs money to assemble, and as with [[evidence-based medicine]] generally, the desire for a vast, high-quality evidence base is an ideal that real-world practice can only aspire to and further approach, rather than completely match; there may not be enough resources to test every drug for every possible or logical indication to an exhaustive degree. Regulation of [[therapy freedom]] thus takes [[everything which is not forbidden is allowed|an approach in which anything not explicitly forbidden is allowed rather than an approach in which anything not explicitly allowed is forbidden]], and it is accepted that drugs may be used in off-label ways as long as a competent professional prescribes them.\n\n==Frequency of off-label use==\n\nOff-label use is very common. Generic drugs generally have no sponsor as their indications and use expands, and incentives are limited to initiate new clinical trials to generate additional data for approval agencies to expand indications of proprietary drugs.<ref name=nejm/> Up to one-fifth of all drugs are prescribed off-label and amongst psychiatric drugs, off-label use rises to 31%.<ref name = radley>{{cite journal |author1=David C.

Some of those lawsuits have ended granting the [[list of largest pharmaceutical settlements|largest pharmaceutical settlements]] in the world.\n\nIn the United States in 2017, the government is considering allowing [[direct-to-consumer advertising]] to promote off-label drug use.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Carr|first1=Teresa|title=FDA Considers Allowing Drug Ads for Unapproved Treatments|url=http://www.consumerreports.org/drugs/fda-considers-allowing-drug-ads-for-unapproved-treatments/|website=Consumer Reports|accessdate=3 April 2017|date=9 November 2016}}</ref> The appointment of [[Scott Gottlieb]] to become head of the [[Food and Drug Administration]] furthered discussion, as this person advocates to allow that sort of promotion.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brill|first1=Steven|title=It's open season for off-label drug promotion|url=https://www.axios.com/its-open-season-for-off-label-drug-promotion-2209853447.html|website=Axios|accessdate=24 March 2017|language=en|date=24 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=McGinley|first1=Laurie|last2=Johnson|first2=Carolyn Y.|title=Trump to select Scott Gottlieb, a physician with deep drug-industry ties, to run the FDA|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2017/03/10/trump-selects-scott-gottlieb-a-physician-with-deep-drug-industry-ties-to-run-the-fda|website=Washington Post|accessdate=24 March 2017|date=10 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Regulation in the United States===\n\nIn the United States, once a drug has been approved for sale for one purpose, physicians are free to [[medical prescription|prescribe]] it for any other purpose that in their professional judgment is both safe and effective, and are not limited to official, FDA-approved indications.<ref name=buckman /> [[Pharmaceutical]] [[list of pharmaceutical companies|companies]] are not allowed to promote a drug for any other purpose without formal FDA approval. Marketing information for the drug will list one or more indications, that is, [[illness]]es or medical conditions for which the drug has been shown to be both safe and effective.\n\nThis off-label prescribing is most commonly done with older, generic medications that have found new uses but have not had the formal (and often costly) applications and studies required by the FDA to formally approve the drug for these new indications. However, there is often extensive medical literature to support the off-label use.\n\nA leading example of how [[regulatory agency|regulatory agencies]] approach off-label use is provided by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA)'s [[Center for Drug Evaluation and Research]], which reviews a company's [[New Drug Application]] (NDA) for [[clinical trials|clinical trial]] data to see if the results support the drug for a specific use or indication.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/default.htm |title=Development & Approval Process (Drugs) |publisher=Fda.gov |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}</ref> If satisfied that the drug is safe and effective, the drug's manufacturer and the FDA agree on specific language describing dosage, route of administration, and other information to be included on the drug's label. More detail is included in the drug's package insert.\n\nThe FDA approves a drug for prescription use, and continues to regulate the [[pharmaceutical industry]]'s promotional practices for that drug through the work of the Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP, formerly the Division for Drug Marketing, Advertisement and Communication (DDMAC).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/AboutFDA/CentersOffices/CDER/ucm090142.htm |title=The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (OPDP) |publisher=Fda.gov |date=2008-03-25 |accessdate=2011-11-21}}</ref> The FDA does not have the legal authority to regulate the practice of the medicine, and the [[physician]] may prescribe a drug off-label.<ref name=buckman>{{cite court |litigants=Buckman Co. v.

In fact, [[Cephalon]], the maker of Actiq, was fined for illegal promotion of the drug in September 2008.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/archive/opa/pr/2008/September/08-civ-860.html|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20150713095048/http://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2008/September/08-civ-860.html|archivedate=2015-07-13|title=Biopharmaceutical Company, Cephalon, to Pay $425 Million & Enter Plea to Resolve Allegations of Off-Label Marketing|date=September 29, 2008|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]}}</ref> Under the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act|Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA)]] at U.S.C. 21 \u00a7\u00a7301-97, manufacturers are prohibited from directly marketing a drug for a use other than the FDA-approved indication.

The labels for the two drugs were similar, but doctors prescribed Lovaza for people who had triglycerides lower than 500&nbsp;mg/dL based on some clinical evidence.  Amarin wanted to actively market E-EPA for that population as well which would have greatly expanded its revenue, and applied to the FDA for permission to do so in 2013, which the FDA denied.<ref>{{cite news|first=Matthew|last=Herper|work=[[Forbes]]|date=17 October 2013|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2013/10/17/why-the-fda-is-right-to-block-amarins-push-to-market-fish-oil-to-millions|title=Why The FDA Is Right To Block Amarin's Push To Market Fish Oil To Millions}}</ref>  In response, in May 2015 Amarin sued the FDA for infringing its [[First Amendment]] rights,<ref>{{cite news | first=Katie | last=Thomas | newspaper=New York Times | date=7 May 2015 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/08/business/drugmaker-sues-fda-over-right-to-discuss-off-label-uses.html | title=Drugmaker Sues F.D.A.

According to [[General Medical Council]] guidance, the physician must be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence or experience of using the medicine to demonstrate safety and efficacy. Prescribing may be necessary when no suitably licensed medicine is available to meet the patient's need (or when the prescribing is part of approved research).<ref>{{cite web |author=General Medical Council |title=Good Practice in Prescribing and Managing Medicines and Devices |website=[[General Medical Council]] |type=Published guidance |date=December 2014 |orig-year=first published February 2013 |publisher=General Medical Council |pages=10\u201311 |url=https://www.gmc-uk.org/ethical-guidance/ethical-guidance-for-doctors/prescribing-and-managing-medicines-and-devices |accessdate=24 May 2018 |format=PDF}}</ref>\n\n==Veterinary medicines==\n\nThe [[veterinarian]] has a much smaller [[pharmacopeia]] available than does the [[physician|human practitioner]]. Therefore, drugs are more likely to be used \"off-label\" \u2013 typically, this involves the use of a human medication in an animal, where there is no corresponding medication licensed for that species.  This problem is compounded in \"exotic\" species (such as reptiles and rodents) where there are very few, if any licensed medications. In addition, especially in [[Europe]], [[equine veterinarian]]s are forced to use many drugs off-label, as the horse is classified as a \"food-producing animal\" and many veterinary drugs are labeled specifically not for use in animals intended for human consumption.\n\nThis practice is permitted by the [[Animal Medicinal Drug Use Clarification Act of 1994]] (P.L. 103-396).  FDA specifically prohibits extralabel use of a number of antibiotics, anti-inflammatory drugs and hormones in food producing animals.   FDA also tightly controls the use of certain veterinary-prescribed drugs when administered in the feed of food-producing animals.<ref>[http://www.cnie.org/NLE/CRSreports/05jun/97-905.pdf CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition - Order Code 97-905] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923055613/http://www.cnie.org/NLE/CRSreports/05jun/97-905.pdf |date=2013-09-23 }}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Pharmaceutical marketing]]\n* [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080521180039/http://www.thedoctorwillseeyounow.com/articles/bioethics/offlabel_11/ Article about the Bioethics of off-label prescribing.]\n* [http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2008/02/17/fda-to-drug-companies-off-label-use-ok/ Recent FDA proposal to loosen off-label marketing restrictions.]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Off-Label Use}}\n[[Category:Off-label drug use| ]]\n", "name_user": "Ich", "label": "safe", "comment": "Add: date.

In 1924, it was incorporated as a ''cidade'' and became known merely as Portim\u00e3o. Historically a fishing and shipbuilding centre, it has nonetheless developed into a strong tourist centre oriented along its beaches and southern coast. The two most populous towns in the Algarve are Portim\u00e3o and [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]].\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:Rio Arade.JPG|thumb|235px|left|A replica of a [[Caravel]] sailing by the Arade River in old Portim\u00e3o]]\n[[File:2007.03.28.pt.Portimao.ForteSantaCatarina.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The Castle of Santa Catarina overlooking the coastal roads of Portim\u00e3o]]\n\n===Prehistory===\nThe area was settled during the prehistoric epoch: the [[Cynetes]], influenced by the [[Celts]] and [[Tartessos]] lived during the Algarve for many centuries.  In the area of Alcalar there are several remnants of [[Neolithic]] funerary sites of which only one, [[Megalithic Monuments of Alcalar|Alcalar monument number seven]], comprising a circular chamber composed of schist stone and long corridor, remains. Comparable to western European and Irish monuments, the funeral crypt, with two lateral ritual niches, was protected by a [[tumulus]]: a similar site exists in Monte Canelas.\n\n===Antiquity===\nThe mouth of the [[Arade River]] proved an important natural shelter that soon became a small commercial port for the [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]]. The Carthaginians founded two settlements nearby in the mid-6th century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, known by their [[Roman Empire|Roman]] names {{nowrap|'''Portus Magonis'''}} and {{nowrap|'''Portus Hannibalis'''}} (\"[[Hannibal]]'s Port\"). The former was the nucleus of present-day Portim\u00e3o.\n\nObvious vestiges of the Roman occupation are situated near Figueira, at [[Roman ruins of Quinta da Abicada|Quinta da Abicada]], in the confluence of two rivers, where the remains of various rooms were unearthed. Also, in the area of Coca Maravilhas was discovered a well-preserved period [[cistern]], while along the Arade River there have been identified gold coins.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the 5th century, the Algarve was inhabited by the [[Visigoths]] until the invasion of the [[Moors]]. It was during the Moorish occupation that the settlement changed to {{nowrap|'''Burj Munt'''}}. The river and its ocean access to the ancient city of Shilb ([[Silves, Portugal|Silves]]), then capital of the Arabian Algarve.\n\n===Kingdom===\nAlong with Silves and Alvor, the small fishing centre in Portim\u00e3o was reconquered in 1249 from the Arabs by Knights of the Order of Santiago and forcibly integrated into the fledgling kingdom, during the reign of [[Afonso III of Portugal]].\n[[File:Igreja_de_Nossa_Senhora_da_Concei\u00e7\u00e3o,_Portim\u00e3o_(1).jpg|thumb|right|230px|Nossa Senhora da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o church. Built in the 15th century and partially rebuilt after the 1755 earthquake]]\nIts geographic location created strong economic conditions to allow the region to prosper, eventually allowing Portim\u00e3o to obtain the status of town in 1435. The inhabitants understood the necessity of constructing walls, in order to protect themselves from constant invasions. The construction of two forts, the Castle of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o (in Ferragudo) and the Castle of Santa Catarin (in Praia da Rocha), protected the centre from attacks from pirates and privateers during this period.\n\nIn Portim\u00e3o, a major part of the commerce was accomplished across the sea. The transport across the Arade River was done across a boat that docked at the ''Largo de Barca''. Until bridge and road was constructed, 400 years later, it was the only form of crossing the river.\n\nIn 1463, King [[Afonso V of Portugal]], under petition from several inhabitants in Portim\u00e3o, authorized the founding of new settlement, which became the urbanized centre of Portim\u00e3o (then named ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o Barrosa''). In 1476, Vila Nova de Portim\u00e3o is donated by [[Afonso V of Portugal]] to his financial inspector, [[Dom (title)|D.]] Gon\u00e7alo Vaz de Castelo Branco, remaining in the family until the 17th century.\n\nThe shipbuilding industry took on an important place in the city's development. These activities were registered in the royal documents that included authorization of [[Sebastian of Portugal]] (in 1536). The king visited in 1573, passing the night and assisting a solemn mass in the Convent of S\u00e3o Francisco.\n\nIn the port of Portim\u00e3o local products, such as figs, olives, oil, wine and fish were regularly exported, while other products from the African and Brazilian colonies, such as slaves and sugar, were introduced into the Portuguese territory. But, by the 17th and 18th century, the rhythm of growth slowed considerably. As commerce decreased the inhabitants emigrated, a fact that accelerated after the 1755 earthquake, causing the destruction within the city. The main church was destroyed, while many of the small chapels were damaged. The city walls were severely damaged, not just by the earthquake but also the resulting tsunami. The [[Fort of Santa Catarina (Portim\u00e3o)|Fort of Santa Catarina]] also suffered damage, but was reconstructed in 1792 and 1794, by the Count of Val de Reys. Twenty years after the earthquake, the Marquess of Pombal, wanted to make Portim\u00e3o a bishopric, and in this evolution, he elevated the town to the status of city. Unfortunately, Queen Maria I of Portugal vetoed these intentions. The civil statute was only issued in 1924, by the Marquess' illustrious son Manuel Teixeira Gomes, as Republican president.\n\n[[File:Portimao skyline.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Portim\u00e3o, Algarve, Portugal]]\n\n===Republic===\nIn the 19th century, a fishing conserving industry reinvigorated the old city. Now renamed Portim\u00e3o, the city turned into one of the more important fishing and packing centres in the Algarve, until the 20th century, when the 1980s recession finally caused these businesses to fold. At the end of the 20th century, visitors to the region began travelling to the beaches of Praia da Rocha or Praia da Santa Catarina. On 1 August 1910, the Praia da Rocha Casino was opened, symptom of the growing influx of tourists to the region, many aristocrats from the southern part of the country and [[Andalusia]].\n\nThe place became populated by houses and chalets built for, or rented to, the numerous tourists. The first hotel constructed, the Hotel Viola, dated to the first part of the 20th century, and was expanded after 1932, when the space became too small to support the influx of travellers. In 1936, the Hotel Bela Vista was constructed as total tourists began to exceed a thousand people annually. It turned into a popular destination for sport fishing, and among popular nautical sports, jet skiing, sailing, windsurfing, diving and dolphin watching.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Praia da Rocha, Portim\u00e3o 2.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The white sand beach and cliffs of the beach of Praia da Rocha]]\nThe municipality is located on the western coast of the Algarve, bordering the municipalities of [[Lagos Municipality|Lagos]], [[Lagoa Municipality (Algarve)|Lagoa]], [[Monchique Municipality]] and [[Silves Municipality, Portugal|Silves]].\n\nPortim\u00e3o is the most important urbanized city in the ''Barlavento Algarvio'' (the western Algarve), supporting a sizeable population with harbour and a small airfield ([[Portim\u00e3o Airport]]) of its own with schedules flights to some domestic destinations by [[Aero VIP (Portugal)|Aero VIP]] (the larger [[Faro Airport|Faro International Airport]] is in the nearby district capital of [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]]).\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 3 civil parishes (''[[freguesia (Portugal)|freguesias]]''):<ref>{{cite web|title=Law nr. 11-A/2013, page 552 99|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf |accessdate=29 July 2014|author=''[[Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica]]''|language=Portuguese|format=pdf}}</ref>\n\n* [[Alvor (Portim\u00e3o)|Alvor]] (6,154 inhabitants, 2011)\n* [[Mexilhoeira Grande]] (4,029 inhabitants, 2011)\n* [[Portim\u00e3o (parish)|Portim\u00e3o]] (45,431 inhabitants, 2011)\n\nThe municipality is primarily serviced by the A22 motorway (the ''Via do Infante''), and the E.N.125 roadway that links it directly to \nthe communities of [[Alvor (Portim\u00e3o)|Alvor]] (4 kilometres), [[Mexilhoeira Grande (Portim\u00e3o)|Mexilhoeira Grande]] (9 kilometres) and [[Praia da Rocha]] (3 kilometres).\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"20\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|\n{{stack|\n{{Historical populations\n|title = Population of the<br> municipality of Portim\u00e3o<br><small>(1981\u20132011)</small>\n| 1981 | 34464\n| 1991 | 38883\n| 2001 | 44818\n| 2004 | 47189\n| 2011 | 55614 \n}}\n}}\n|}\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Portim\u00e3o\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n\n|Jan high C = 15.9\n|Feb high C = 16.6\n|Mar high C = 17.8\n|Apr high C = 19.7\n|May high C = 22.2\n|Jun high C = 25.3\n|Jul high C = 28.4\n|Aug high C = 28.8\n|Sep high C = 26.3\n|Oct high C = 22.9\n|Nov high C = 19.0\n|Dec high C = 16.6\n|year high C = \n\n|Jan mean C = 12.0\n|Feb mean C = 12.6\n|Mar mean C = 13.8\n|Apr mean C = 15.4\n|May mean C = 17.6\n|Jun mean C = 20.4\n|Jul mean C = 22.9\n|Aug mean C = 23.4\n|Sep mean C = 21.6\n|Oct mean C = 18.8\n|Nov mean C = 15.1\n|Dec mean C = 12.7\n|year mean C = \n\n|Jan low C = 8.2\n|Feb low C = 8.6\n|Mar low C = 9.9\n|Apr low C = 11.1\n|May low C = 13.0\n|Jun low C = 15.6\n|Jul low C = 17.5\n|Aug low C = 18.0\n|Sep low C = 16.9\n|Oct low C = 14.7\n|Nov low C = 11.3\n|Dec low C = 8.8\n|year low C = \n\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 79\n|Feb rain mm = 64\n|Mar rain mm = 45\n|Apr rain mm = 36\n|May rain mm = 21\n|Jun rain mm = 12\n|Jul rain mm = 1\n|Aug rain mm = 2\n|Sep rain mm = 14\n|Oct rain mm = 53\n|Nov rain mm = 77\n|Dec rain mm = 77\n|year rain mm = \n\n|Jan sun = 175\n|Feb sun = 191\n|Mar sun = 219\n|Apr sun = 276\n|May sun = 322\n|Jun sun = 352\n|Jul sun = 387\n|Aug sun = 363\n|Sep sun = 281\n|Oct sun = 235\n|Nov sun = 181\n|Dec sun = 180\n|year sun = \n\n|source 1 = Climate-data.org<ref name=Climate-data.org>{{cite web\n|url =https://en.climate-data.org/europe/portugal/portimao/portimao-999359/ |title =Portim\u00e3o Climate|publisher=climate-data.org|year=2020}}\nRetrieved on April 12, 2020.\n</ref>|source 2 = weather-and-climate.com<ref name=weather-and-climate>{{cite web\n|url = https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-hours-Sunshine,praia-da-rocha,Portugal|title =Average Monthly Hours Of Sunshine In Praia Da Rocha (Algarve), Portugal|publisher=weather-and-climate|year=2020}}\nRetrieved on April 11, 2020.\n</ref>|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:Aqua Shopping centre, Portim\u00e3o (2).jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Aqua Shopping centre in Portim\u00e3o]] \n[[File:Praia da Rocha beach, Portim\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|Praia da Rocha attracts numerous tourists]]\n\nThe community, which was founded on the right margin of the Arade River, and oriented towards the sea, is inserted in a region whose geography and physical characteristics justify a seafaring economy. Its maritime economy allowed the development of industries oriented towards salination of fish, the open-water fishing industry, conservation and canning, the construction of ships and transport. Further, the Arade basin permitted rural commerce associated with cultivation of [[Ceratonia siliqua|carob]], fig, almonds and the saw-milling/forestry industry (including cork), among others.\n\nIn the last quarter of the 20th century, tourism became an accentuated economic factor in the regions growth, with the development of activities oriented towards the sea and development of seasonal infrastructures that permitted an influx of new money. By the beginning of the 21st century, 74% of the roughly 2000 annual overnight stays originated from the United Kingdom, Portugal and Ireland. Seasonal concentration (44%) usually occurred around the high-summer months (July, August and September).\n\nThe Algarve in general is a major draw for tourists. In 2018, the region's income from tourism was over a billion euros; the number of visitors totaled 4.2 million. The region's tourism contributed \u20ac1.08 billion to the economy in that year.\n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://algarvedailynews.com/news/16144-algarve-tourism-figures-now-in-for-2018 |title=Algarve tourism figures now in for 2018 |date=14 February 2019 |publisher=Algarve Daily News|access-date=25 November 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n\n===Prehistoric===\n* [[Megalithic Monuments of Alcalar]] ({{lang-pt|Monumentos de Alcalar/Conjunto Pr\u00e9-hist\u00f3rico de Alcalar}})\n\n===Civic===\n* [[Roman ruins of Quinta da Abicada]] ({{lang-pt|Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Romana da Quinta da Abicada}})\n\n== Sports ==\nPortim\u00e3o is known for its sporting events, mostly [[water sports]], including [[surfing]] and [[kitesurfing]]; [[motorsport]]; [[beach soccer]]; and the professional football team [[Portimonense S.C. (football team)|Portimonense S.C.]].\n\n===Team sports===\n[[Portimonense S.C.]] is the local sports club, with team in such sports such as [[basketball]]. It is best known for its [[Portimonense S.C. (football team)|professional association football section]], who play at the [[Est\u00e1dio Municipal de Portim\u00e3o]]. In the summer, a [[beach soccer]] tournament called the [[Mundialito de Futebol de Praia]] ('Little World Cup') is held.\n\n=== Sailing ===\nBeing located on the South coast of Portugal, Portim\u00e3o is well known in the sailing world for being an ideal location for sailing on the Atlantic Ocean, boasting much calmer seas and weather conditions than the Western coastline.\n\nPortim\u00e3o is the host venue for many prestigious sailing events including the annual '''Portim\u00e3o, Portugal Match Cup''' event which is a part of the [[World Match Racing Tour]]. The event draws the world's best sailing teams to Portim\u00e3o. The identical supplied (SM-40) boats are raced two at a time. Points accrued count towards the World Match Race Tour and a place in the final event of the season, with the overall winner taking the title [[International Sailing Federation|ISAF]] World Match Racing Tour Champion. Match racing is an ideal sport for spectators in Portim\u00e3o.\n\n=== Powerboating ===\nThe Portim\u00e3o coastline has also been host to the sport of powerboating. The Portuguese Grand Prix of the Sea run by Powerboat P1 as part of its international championship is also held in Portim\u00e3o. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n=== Motorsport ===\nIn the hills near Portim\u00e3o stands the [[Aut\u00f3dromo Internacional do Algarve]].

In 1924, it was incorporated as a ''cidade'' and became known merely as Portim\u00e3o. Historically a fishing and shipbuilding centre, it has nonetheless developed into a strong tourist centre oriented along its beaches and southern coast. The two most populous towns in the Algarve are Portim\u00e3o and [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]].\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:Rio Arade.JPG|thumb|235px|left|A replica of a [[Caravel]] sailing by the Arade River in old Portim\u00e3o]]\n[[File:2007.03.28.pt.Portimao.ForteSantaCatarina.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The Castle of Santa Catarina overlooking the coastal roads of Portim\u00e3o]]\n\n===Prehistory===\nThe area was settled during the prehistoric epoch: the [[Cynetes]], influenced by the [[Celts]] and [[Tartessos]] lived during the Algarve for many centuries.  In the area of Alcalar there are several remnants of [[Neolithic]] funerary sites of which only one, [[Megalithic Monuments of Alcalar|Alcalar monument number seven]], comprising a circular chamber composed of schist stone and long corridor, remains. Comparable to western European and Irish monuments, the funeral crypt, with two lateral ritual niches, was protected by a [[tumulus]]: a similar site exists in Monte Canelas.\n\n===Antiquity===\nThe mouth of the [[Arade River]] proved an important natural shelter that soon became a small commercial port for the [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Carthage|Carthaginians]]. The Carthaginians founded two settlements nearby in the mid-6th century{{nbsp}}{{sc|bc}}, known by their [[Roman Empire|Roman]] names {{nowrap|'''Portus Magonis'''}} and {{nowrap|'''Portus Hannibalis'''}} (\"[[Hannibal]]'s Port\"). The former was the nucleus of present-day Portim\u00e3o.\n\nObvious vestiges of the Roman occupation are situated near Figueira, at [[Roman ruins of Quinta da Abicada|Quinta da Abicada]], in the confluence of two rivers, where the remains of various rooms were unearthed. Also, in the area of Coca Maravilhas was discovered a well-preserved period [[cistern]], while along the Arade River there have been identified gold coins.\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the 5th century, the Algarve was inhabited by the [[Visigoths]] until the invasion of the [[Moors]]. It was during the Moorish occupation that the settlement changed to {{nowrap|'''Burj Munt'''}}. The river and its ocean access to the ancient city of Shilb ([[Silves, Portugal|Silves]]), then capital of the Arabian Algarve.\n\n===Kingdom===\nAlong with Silves and Alvor, the small fishing centre in Portim\u00e3o was reconquered in 1249 from the Arabs by Knights of the Order of Santiago and forcibly integrated into the fledgling kingdom, during the reign of [[Afonso III of Portugal]].\n[[File:Igreja_de_Nossa_Senhora_da_Concei\u00e7\u00e3o,_Portim\u00e3o_(1).jpg|thumb|right|230px|Nossa Senhora da Concei\u00e7\u00e3o church. Built in the 15th century and partially rebuilt after the 1755 earthquake]]\nIts geographic location created strong economic conditions to allow the region to prosper, eventually allowing Portim\u00e3o to obtain the status of town in 1435. The inhabitants understood the necessity of constructing walls, in order to protect themselves from constant invasions. The construction of two forts, the Castle of S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o (in Ferragudo) and the Castle of Santa Catarin (in Praia da Rocha), protected the centre from attacks from pirates and privateers during this period.\n\nIn Portim\u00e3o, a major part of the commerce was accomplished across the sea. The transport across the Arade River was done across a boat that docked at the ''Largo de Barca''. Until bridge and road was constructed, 400 years later, it was the only form of crossing the river.\n\nIn 1463, King [[Afonso V of Portugal]], under petition from several inhabitants in Portim\u00e3o, authorized the founding of new settlement, which became the urbanized centre of Portim\u00e3o (then named ''S\u00e3o Louren\u00e7o Barrosa''). In 1476, Vila Nova de Portim\u00e3o is donated by [[Afonso V of Portugal]] to his financial inspector, [[Dom (title)|D.]] Gon\u00e7alo Vaz de Castelo Branco, remaining in the family until the 17th century.\n\nThe shipbuilding industry took on an important place in the city's development. These activities were registered in the royal documents that included authorization of [[Sebastian of Portugal]] (in 1536). The king visited in 1573, passing the night and assisting a solemn mass in the Convent of S\u00e3o Francisco.\n\nIn the port of Portim\u00e3o local products, such as figs, olives, oil, wine and fish were regularly exported, while other products from the African and Brazilian colonies, such as slaves and sugar, were introduced into the Portuguese territory. But, by the 17th and 18th century, the rhythm of growth slowed considerably. As commerce decreased the inhabitants emigrated, a fact that accelerated after the 1755 earthquake, causing the destruction within the city. The main church was destroyed, while many of the small chapels were damaged. The city walls were severely damaged, not just by the earthquake but also the resulting tsunami. The [[Fort of Santa Catarina (Portim\u00e3o)|Fort of Santa Catarina]] also suffered damage, but was reconstructed in 1792 and 1794, by the Count of Val de Reys. Twenty years after the earthquake, the Marquess of Pombal, wanted to make Portim\u00e3o a bishopric, and in this evolution, he elevated the town to the status of city. Unfortunately, Queen Maria I of Portugal vetoed these intentions. The civil statute was only issued in 1924, by the Marquess' illustrious son Manuel Teixeira Gomes, as Republican President.\n\n[[File:Portimao skyline.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Portim\u00e3o, Algarve, Portugal]]\n\n===Republic===\nIn the 19th century, a fishing conserving industry reinvigorated the old city. Now renamed Portim\u00e3o, the city turned into one of the more important fishing and packing centres in the Algarve, until the 20th century, when the 1980s recession finally caused these businesses to fold. At the end of the 20th century, visitors to the region began travelling to the beaches of Praia da Rocha or Praia da Santa Catarina. On 1 August 1910, the Praia da Rocha Casino was opened, symptom of the growing influx of tourists to the region, many aristocrats from the southern part of the country and [[Andalusia]].\n\nThe place became populated by houses and chalets built for, or rented to, the numerous tourists. The first hotel constructed, the Hotel Viola, dated to the first part of the 20th century, and was expanded after 1932, when the space became too small to support the influx of travellers. In 1936, the Hotel Bela Vista was constructed as total tourists began to exceed a thousand people annually. It turned into a popular destination for sport fishing, and among popular nautical sports, jet skiing, sailing, windsurfing, diving and dolphin watching.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Praia da Rocha, Portim\u00e3o 2.jpg|thumb|235px|left|The white sand beach and cliffs of the beach of Praia da Rocha]]\nThe municipality is located on the western coast of the Algarve, bordering the municipalities of [[Lagos Municipality|Lagos]], [[Lagoa Municipality (Algarve)|Lagoa]], [[Monchique Municipality]] and [[Silves Municipality, Portugal|Silves]].\n\nPortim\u00e3o is the most important urbanized city in the ''Barlavento Algarvio'' (the western Algarve), supporting a sizeable population with harbour and a small airfield ([[Portim\u00e3o Airport]]) of its own with schedules flights to some domestic destinations by [[Aero VIP (Portugal)|Aero VIP]] (the larger [[Faro Airport|Faro International Airport]] is in the nearby district capital of [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]]).\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 3 civil parishes (''[[freguesia (Portugal)|freguesias]]''):<ref>{{cite web|title=Law nr. 11-A/2013, page 552 99|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf |accessdate=29 July 2014|author=''[[Di\u00e1rio da Rep\u00fablica]]''|language=Portuguese|format=pdf}}</ref>\n\n* [[Alvor (Portim\u00e3o)|Alvor]] (6,154 inhabitants, 2011)\n* [[Mexilhoeira Grande]] (4,029 inhabitants, 2011)\n* [[Portim\u00e3o (parish)|Portim\u00e3o]] (45,431 inhabitants, 2011)\n\nThe municipality is primarily serviced by the A22 motorway (the ''Via do Infante''), and the E.N.125 roadway that links it directly to \nthe communities of [[Alvor (Portim\u00e3o)|Alvor]] (4 kilometres), [[Mexilhoeira Grande (Portim\u00e3o)|Mexilhoeira Grande]] (9 kilometres) and [[Praia da Rocha]] (3 kilometres).\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"20\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|\n{{stack|\n{{Historical populations\n|title = Population of the<br> municipality of Portim\u00e3o<br><small>(1981\u20132011)</small>\n| 1981 | 34464\n| 1991 | 38883\n| 2001 | 44818\n| 2004 | 47189\n| 2011 | 55614 \n}}\n}}\n|}\n\n=== Climate ===\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Portim\u00e3o\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n\n|Jan high C = 15.9\n|Feb high C = 16.6\n|Mar high C = 17.8\n|Apr high C = 19.7\n|May high C = 22.2\n|Jun high C = 25.3\n|Jul high C = 28.4\n|Aug high C = 28.8\n|Sep high C = 26.3\n|Oct high C = 22.9\n|Nov high C = 19.0\n|Dec high C = 16.6\n|year high C = \n\n|Jan mean C = 12.0\n|Feb mean C = 12.6\n|Mar mean C = 13.8\n|Apr mean C = 15.4\n|May mean C = 17.6\n|Jun mean C = 20.4\n|Jul mean C = 22.9\n|Aug mean C = 23.4\n|Sep mean C = 21.6\n|Oct mean C = 18.8\n|Nov mean C = 15.1\n|Dec mean C = 12.7\n|year mean C = \n\n|Jan low C = 8.2\n|Feb low C = 8.6\n|Mar low C = 9.9\n|Apr low C = 11.1\n|May low C = 13.0\n|Jun low C = 15.6\n|Jul low C = 17.5\n|Aug low C = 18.0\n|Sep low C = 16.9\n|Oct low C = 14.7\n|Nov low C = 11.3\n|Dec low C = 8.8\n|year low C = \n\n|rain colour = green\n|Jan rain mm = 79\n|Feb rain mm = 64\n|Mar rain mm = 45\n|Apr rain mm = 36\n|May rain mm = 21\n|Jun rain mm = 12\n|Jul rain mm = 1\n|Aug rain mm = 2\n|Sep rain mm = 14\n|Oct rain mm = 53\n|Nov rain mm = 77\n|Dec rain mm = 77\n|year rain mm = \n\n|Jan sun = 175\n|Feb sun = 191\n|Mar sun = 219\n|Apr sun = 276\n|May sun = 322\n|Jun sun = 352\n|Jul sun = 387\n|Aug sun = 363\n|Sep sun = 281\n|Oct sun = 235\n|Nov sun = 181\n|Dec sun = 180\n|year sun = \n\n|source 1 = Climate-data.org<ref name=Climate-data.org>{{cite web\n|url =https://en.climate-data.org/europe/portugal/portimao/portimao-999359/ |title =Portim\u00e3o Climate|publisher=climate-data.org|year=2020}}\nRetrieved on April 12, 2020.\n</ref>|source 2 = weather-and-climate.com<ref name=weather-and-climate>{{cite web\n|url = https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-hours-Sunshine,praia-da-rocha,Portugal|title =Average Monthly Hours Of Sunshine In Praia Da Rocha (Algarve), Portugal|publisher=weather-and-climate|year=2020}}\nRetrieved on April 11, 2020.\n</ref>|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Economy==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\n[[File:Aqua Shopping centre, Portim\u00e3o (2).jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Aqua Shopping centre in Portim\u00e3o]] \n[[File:Praia da Rocha beach, Portim\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|Praia da Rocha attracts numerous tourists]]\n\nThe community, which was founded on the right margin of the Arade River, and oriented towards the sea, is inserted in a region whose geography and physical characteristics justify a seafaring economy. Its maritime economy allowed the development of industries oriented towards salination of fish, the open-water fishing industry, conservation and canning, the construction of ships and transport. Further, the Arade basin permitted rural commerce associated with cultivation of [[Ceratonia siliqua|carob]], fig, almonds and the saw-milling/forestry industry (including cork), among others.\n\nIn the last quarter of the 20th century, tourism became an accentuated economic factor in the regions growth, with the development of activities oriented towards the sea and development of seasonal infrastructures that permitted an influx of new money. By the beginning of the 21st century, 74% of the roughly 2000 annual overnight stays originated from the United Kingdom, Portugal and Ireland. Seasonal concentration (44%) usually occurred around the high-summer months (July, August and September).\n\nThe Algarve in general is a major draw for tourists. In 2018, the region's income from tourism was over a billion euros; the number of visitors totaled 4.2 million. The region's tourism contributed \u20ac1.08 billion to the economy in that year.\n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://algarvedailynews.com/news/16144-algarve-tourism-figures-now-in-for-2018 |title=Algarve tourism figures now in for 2018 |date=14 February 2019 |publisher=Algarve Daily News|access-date=25 November 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Architecture==\n\n===Prehistoric===\n* [[Megalithic Monuments of Alcalar]] ({{lang-pt|Monumentos de Alcalar/Conjunto Pr\u00e9-hist\u00f3rico de Alcalar}})\n\n===Civic===\n* [[Roman ruins of Quinta da Abicada]] ({{lang-pt|Esta\u00e7\u00e3o Romana da Quinta da Abicada}})\n\n== Sports ==\nPortim\u00e3o is known for its sporting events, mostly [[water sports]], including [[surfing]] and [[kitesurfing]]; [[motorsport]]; [[beach soccer]]; and the professional football team [[Portimonense S.C.

In the summer, a [[beach soccer]] tournament called the [[Mundialito de Futebol de Praia]] ('Little World Cup') is held.\n\n=== Sailing ===\nBeing located on the South coast of Portugal, Portim\u00e3o is well known in the sailing world for being an ideal location for sailing on the Atlantic Ocean, boasting much calmer seas and weather conditions than the Western coastline.\n\nPortim\u00e3o is the host venue for many prestigious sailing events including the annual '''Portim\u00e3o, Portugal Match Cup''' event which is a part of the [[World Match Racing Tour]]. The event draws the world's best sailing teams to Portim\u00e3o. The identical supplied (SM-40) boats are raced two at a time. Points accrued count towards the World Match Race Tour and a place in the final event of the season, with the overall winner taking the title [[International Sailing Federation|ISAF]] World Match Racing Tour Champion. Match racing is an ideal sport for spectators in Portim\u00e3o.\n\n=== Powerboating ===\nThe Portim\u00e3o coastline has also been host to the sport of powerboating.

RNAP [[helicase|locally opens]] the double-stranded [[DNA]] (usually about four turns of the double helix) so that one strand of the exposed [[nucleotide]]s can be used as a template for the synthesis of [[RNA]], a process called [[transcription (biology)|transcription]]. A [[transcription factor]] and its associated transcription [[mediator complex]] must be attached to a [[DNA binding site]] called a [[promoter region]] before RNAP can initiate the DNA unwinding at that position. RNAP not only initiates RNA transcription, it also guides the nucleotides into position, facilitates attachment and elongation, has intrinsic proofreading and replacement capabilities, and termination recognition capability. In [[eukaryote]]s, RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million nucleotides.\n\nRNAP produces RNA that functionally is either [[Coding strand|coding]] (for protein) ([[messenger RNA]]) (mRNA); or [[non-coding]]: so-called \"RNA genes\". At least four functional types of RNA genes exist: \n# [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) \u2014 transfers specific [[amino acid]]s to growing [[polypeptide]] chains at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during [[translation (biology)|translation]];\n# [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) \u2014 incorporates into [[ribosome]]s;\n# [[micro RNA]] (miRNA) \u2014 regulates gene activity; and, \n# [[catalytic RNA]] ([[ribozyme]]) \u2014 functions as an enzymatically active RNA molecule.\n\nRNA polymerase is essential to life, and is found in all living organisms and many viruses. Depending on the organism, a RNA polymerase can be a [[protein complex]] (multi-subunit RNAP) or only consist of one subunit (single-subunit RNAP, ssRNAP), each representing an independent lineage. The former is found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes alike, sharing a similar core structure and mechanism.<ref name=\"pmid21233849\"/> The latter is found in phages as well as eukaryotic [[chloroplast]]s and [[mitochondria]], and is related to modern [[DNA polymerase]]s.<ref name=\"pmid9419244\"/> Eukaryotic and archaeal RNAPs have more subunits than bacterial ones do, and are controlled differently.\n\nBacteria and archaea only have one RNA polymerase. Eukaryotes have multiple types of nuclear RNAP, each responsible for synthesis of a distinct subset of RNA. [[RNA polymerase I]] synthesizes a pre-[[rRNA]] 45[[Svedberg|S]] (35S in [[yeast]]), which matures and will form the major RNA sections of the ribosome. [[RNA polymerase II]] synthesizes precursors of mRNAs and most [[snRNA]] and microRNAs.

Therefore, it is hardly surprising that the activity of RNAP is long, complex, and highly regulated. In ''Escherichia coli'' bacteria, more than 100 [[transcription factor]]s have been identified, which modify the activity of RNAP.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishihama A | title = Functional modulation of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 54 | pages = 499\u2013518 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11018136 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.54.1.499 }}</ref>\n\nRNAP can initiate transcription at specific DNA sequences known as [[promoter (biology)|promoter]]s. It then produces an RNA chain, which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template DNA strand. The process of adding [[nucleotide]]s to the RNA strand is known as elongation; in eukaryotes, RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million [[nucleotides]] (the full length of the [[dystrophin]] gene). RNAP will preferentially release its RNA transcript at specific DNA sequences encoded at the end of genes, which are known as [[Terminator (genetics)|terminators]].\n\nProducts of RNAP include:\n*[[Messenger RNA]] (mRNA)\u2014template for the [[Translation (biology)|synthesis of proteins]] by [[ribosome]]s.\n*[[Non-coding RNA]] or \"RNA genes\"\u2014a broad class of genes that encode RNA that is not translated into protein. The most prominent examples of RNA genes are [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) and [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA), both of which are involved in the process of [[Translation (genetics)|translation]]. However, since the late 1990s, many new RNA genes have been found, and thus RNA genes may play a much more significant role than previously thought.\n**[[Transfer RNA]] (tRNA)\u2014transfers specific [[amino acid]]s to growing [[polypeptide]] chains at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during [[translation (biology)|translation]]\n**[[Ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA)\u2014a component of ribosomes\n**[[Micro RNA]]\u2014regulates gene activity\n**Catalytic RNA ([[Ribozyme]])\u2014enzymatically active RNA molecules\n\nRNAP accomplishes [[de novo synthesis|''de novo'' synthesis]]. It is able to do this because specific interactions with the initiating nucleotide hold RNAP rigidly in place, facilitating chemical attack on the incoming nucleotide. Such specific interactions explain why RNAP prefers to start transcripts with ATP (followed by GTP, UTP, and then CTP). In contrast to [[DNA polymerase]], RNAP includes [[helicase]] activity, therefore no separate enzyme is needed to unwind DNA.\n\n==Action==\n{{see also|Transcription (biology)#Major steps}}\n\n=== Initiation ===\nRNA polymerase binding in bacteria involves the [[sigma factor]] recognizing the core promoter region containing the \u221235 and \u221210 elements (located ''before'' the beginning of sequence to be transcribed) and also, at some promoters, the \u03b1 subunit C-terminal domain recognizing promoter upstream elements.<ref>{{InterPro|IPR011260}}</ref> There are multiple interchangeable sigma factors, each of which recognizes a distinct set of promoters.  For example, in ''E. coli'', \u03c3<sup>70</sup> is expressed under normal conditions and recognizes promoters for genes required under normal conditions (\"[[housekeeping gene]]s\"), while \u03c3<sup>32</sup> recognizes promoters for genes required at high temperatures (\"[[heat shock protein|heat-shock genes]]\"). In archaea and eukaryotes, the functions of the bacterial general transcription factor sigma are performed by multiple [[general transcription factor]]s that work together. The RNA polymerase-promoter closed complex is usually referred to as the \"[[transcription preinitiation complex]].\"<ref name=\"Roeder1991\">{{cite journal|last1=Roeder|first1=Robert G.|title=The complexities of eukaryotic transcription initiation: regulation of preinitiation complex assembly|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|volume=16|issue=11|year=1991|pages=402\u2013408|issn=0968-0004|doi=10.1016/0968-0004(91)90164-Q|pmid=1776168}}</ref><ref name=\"MBOG\">{{cite book |vauthors=Watson JD, Baker TA, Bell SP, Gann AA, Levine M, Losick RM | title=Molecular Biology of the Gene | publisher=Pearson | edition=7th | year=2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter binding to the DNA, the RNA polymerase switches from a closed complex to an open complex.  This change involves the separation of the DNA strands to form an unwound section of DNA of approximately 13 bp, referred to as the \"[[transcription bubble]]\".  [[Supercoiling]] plays an important part in polymerase activity because of the unwinding and rewinding of DNA.  Because regions of DNA in front of RNAP are unwound, there are compensatory positive supercoils.  Regions behind RNAP are rewound and negative supercoils are present.<ref name=\"MBOG\"/>\n\n=== Promoter escape ===\nRNA polymerase then starts to synthesize the initial DNA-RNA heteroduplex, with ribonucleotides base-paired to the template DNA strand according to Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions.  As noted above, RNA polymerase makes contacts with the promoter region. However these stabilizing contacts inhibit the enzyme's ability to access DNA further downstream and thus the synthesis of the full-length product. In order to continue RNA synthesis, RNA polymerase must escape the promoter. It must maintain promoter contacts while unwinding more downstream DNA for synthesis, [[DNA scrunching|\"scrunching\"]] more downstream DNA into the initiation complex.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Revyakin A, Liu C, Ebright RH, Strick TR | title = Abortive initiation and productive initiation by RNA polymerase involve DNA scrunching | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = 5802 | pages = 1139\u201343 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17110577 | pmc = 2754787 | doi = 10.1126/science.1131398 | bibcode = 2006Sci...314.1139R }}</ref> During the promoter escape transition, RNA polymerase is considered a \"stressed intermediate.\"  Thermodynamically the stress accumulates from the DNA-unwinding and DNA-compaction activities. Once the DNA-RNA heteroduplex is long enough (~10 bp), RNA polymerase releases its upstream contacts and effectively achieves the promoter escape transition into the elongation phase. The heteroduplex at the active center stabilizes the elongation complex.\n\nHowever, promoter escape is not the only outcome. RNA polymerase can also relieve the stress by releasing its downstream contacts, arresting transcription.  The paused transcribing complex has two options: (1) release the nascent transcript and begin anew at the promoter or (2) reestablish a new 3'OH on the nascent transcript at the active site via RNA polymerase's catalytic activity and recommence DNA scrunching to achieve promoter escape. [[Abortive initiation]], the unproductive cycling of RNA polymerase before the promoter escape transition, results in short RNA fragments of around 9 bp in a process known as abortive transcription. The extent of abortive initiation depends on the presence of transcription factors and the strength of the promoter contacts.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldman SR, Ebright RH, Nickels BE | title = Direct detection of abortive RNA transcripts in vivo | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5929 | pages = 927\u20138 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19443781 | pmc = 2718712 | doi = 10.1126/science.1169237 | bibcode = 2009Sci...324..927G | authorlink2 = Richard H.

Transcribing the region causes the formation of a \"hairpin\" structure from the RNA transcription looping and binding upon itself.

As a result, the 8 bp DNA-RNA hybrid in the transcription complex shifts to a 4 bp hybrid.  These last 4 base pairs are weak A-U base pairs, and the entire RNA transcript will fall off the DNA.\n\nTranscription termination in eukaryotes is less well understood than in bacteria, but involves cleavage of the new transcript followed by template-independent addition of adenines at its new 3' end, in a process called [[polyadenylation]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lykke-Andersen S, Jensen TH | title = Overlapping pathways dictate termination of RNA polymerase II transcription | journal = Biochimie | volume = 89 | issue = 10 | pages = 1177\u201382 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17629387 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2007.05.007 }}</ref>\n\n==Other organisms==\nGiven that DNA and RNA polymerases both carry out template-dependent nucleotide polymerization, it might be expected that the two types of enzymes would be structurally related.

RNAP [[helicase|locally opens]] the double-stranded [[DNA]] (usually about four turns of the double helix) so that one strand of the exposed [[nucleotide]]s can be used as a template for the synthesis of [[RNA]], a process called [[transcription (biology)|transcription]]. A [[transcription factor]] and its associated transcription [[mediator complex]] must be attached to a [[DNA binding site]] called a [[promoter region]] before RNAP can initiate the DNA unwinding at that position. RNAP not only initiates RNA transcription, it also guides the nucleotides into position, facilitates attachment and elongation, has intrinsic proofreading and replacement capabilities, and termination recognition capability. In [[eukaryote]]s, RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million nucleotides.\n\nRNAP produces RNA that functionally is either [[Coding strand|coding]] (for protein) ([[messenger RNA]]) (mRNA); or [[non-coding]]: so-called \"RNA genes\". At least four functional types of RNA genes exist: \n# [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) \u2014 transfers specific [[amino acid]]s to growing [[polypeptide]] chains at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during [[translation (biology)|translation]];\n# [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA) \u2014 incorporates into [[ribosome]]s;\n# [[micro RNA]] (miRNA) \u2014 regulates gene activity; and, \n# [[catalytic RNA]] ([[ribozyme]]) \u2014 functions as an enzymatically active RNA molecule.\n\nRNA polymerase is essential to life, and is found in all living organisms and many viruses. Depending on the organism, a RNA polymerase can be a [[protein complex]] (multi-subunit RNAP) or only consist of one subunit (single-subunit RNAP, ssRNAP), each representing an independent lineage. The former is found in bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes alike, sharing a similar core structure and mechanism.<ref name=\"pmid21233849\"/> The latter is found in phages as well as eukaryotic [[chloroplast]]s and [[mitochondria]], and is related to modern [[DNA polymerase]]s.<ref name=\"pmid9419244\"/> Eukaryotic and archaeal RNAPs have more subunits than bacterial ones do, and are controlled differently.\n\nBacteria and archaea only have one RNA polymerase. Eukaryotes have multiple types of nuclear RNAP, each responsible for synthesis of a distinct subset of RNA. [[RNA polymerase I]] synthesizes a pre-[[rRNA]] 45[[Svedberg|S]] (35S in [[yeast]]), which matures and will form the major RNA sections of the ribosome. [[RNA polymerase II]] synthesizes precursors of mRNAs and most [[snRNA]] and microRNAs. [[RNA polymerase III]] synthesizes tRNAs, rRNA 5S and other [[small RNA]]s found in the [[cell nucleus|nucleus]] and [[cytosol]]. [[RNA polymerase IV]] and [[RNA polymerase V|V]] found in plants are less-understood; they make [[Small interfering RNA|siRNA]]. In addition to the ssRNAPs, chloroplasts also encode and use a bacteria-like RNAP.\n\n== Structure ==\n{{multiple image\n|image1=Bacterial RNA-polymerase structure 1HQM.png\n|caption1=''T. aquaticus'' RNA polymerase core (PDB 1HQM).\n|image2=Eukaryotic RNA-polymerase II structure 1WCM.png\n|caption2=Yeast RNA polymerase II core (PDB 1WCM).\n|footer=Homologous subunits are colored the same:<ref name=\"pmid21233849\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Werner F, Grohmann D | title = Evolution of multisubunit RNA polymerases in the three domains of life | journal = Nature Reviews.

Therefore, it is hardly surprising that the activity of RNAP is long, complex, and highly regulated. In ''Escherichia coli'' bacteria, more than 100 [[transcription factor]]s have been identified, which modify the activity of RNAP.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ishihama A | title = Functional modulation of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 54 | pages = 499\u2013518 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11018136 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.54.1.499 }}</ref>\n\nRNAP can initiate transcription at specific DNA sequences known as [[promoter (biology)|promoter]]s. It then produces an RNA chain, which is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the template DNA strand. The process of adding [[nucleotide]]s to the RNA strand is known as elongation; in eukaryotes, RNAP can build chains as long as 2.4 million [[nucleotides]] (the full length of the [[dystrophin]] gene). RNAP will preferentially release its RNA transcript at specific DNA sequences encoded at the end of genes, which are known as [[Terminator (genetics)|terminators]].\n\nProducts of RNAP include:\n*[[Messenger RNA]] (mRNA)\u2014template for the [[Translation (biology)|synthesis of proteins]] by [[ribosome]]s.\n*[[Non-coding RNA]] or \"RNA genes\"\u2014a broad class of genes that encode RNA that is not translated into protein. The most prominent examples of RNA genes are [[transfer RNA]] (tRNA) and [[ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA), both of which are involved in the process of [[Translation (genetics)|translation]]. However, since the late 1990s, many new RNA genes have been found, and thus RNA genes may play a much more significant role than previously thought.\n**[[Transfer RNA]] (tRNA)\u2014transfers specific [[amino acid]]s to growing [[polypeptide]] chains at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during [[translation (biology)|translation]]\n**[[Ribosomal RNA]] (rRNA)\u2014a component of ribosomes\n**[[Micro RNA]]\u2014regulates gene activity\n**Catalytic RNA ([[Ribozyme]])\u2014enzymatically active RNA molecules\n\nRNAP accomplishes [[de novo synthesis|''de novo'' synthesis]]. It is able to do this because specific interactions with the initiating nucleotide hold RNAP rigidly in place, facilitating chemical attack on the incoming nucleotide. Such specific interactions explain why RNAP prefers to start transcripts with ATP (followed by GTP, UTP, and then CTP). In contrast to [[DNA polymerase]], RNAP includes [[helicase]] activity, therefore no separate enzyme is needed to unwind DNA.\n\n==Action==\n{{see also|Transcription (biology)#Major steps}}\n\n=== Initiation ===\nRNA polymerase binding in bacteria involves the [[sigma factor]] recognizing the core promoter region containing the \u221235 and \u221210 elements (located ''before'' the beginning of sequence to be transcribed) and also, at some promoters, the \u03b1 subunit C-terminal domain recognizing promoter upstream elements.<ref>{{InterPro|IPR011260}}</ref> There are multiple interchangeable sigma factors, each of which recognizes a distinct set of promoters.  For example, in ''E. coli'', \u03c3<sup>70</sup> is expressed under normal conditions and recognizes promoters for genes required under normal conditions (\"[[housekeeping gene]]s\"), while \u03c3<sup>32</sup> recognizes promoters for genes required at high temperatures (\"[[heat shock protein|heat-shock genes]]\"). In archaea and eukaryotes, the functions of the bacterial general transcription factor sigma are performed by multiple [[general transcription factor]]s that work together. The RNA polymerase-promoter closed complex is usually referred to as the \"[[transcription preinitiation complex]].\"<ref name=\"Roeder1991\">{{cite journal|last1=Roeder|first1=Robert G.|title=The complexities of eukaryotic transcription initiation: regulation of preinitiation complex assembly|journal=Trends in Biochemical Sciences|volume=16|issue=11|year=1991|pages=402\u2013408|issn=0968-0004|doi=10.1016/0968-0004(91)90164-Q|pmid=1776168}}</ref><ref name=\"MBOG\">{{cite book |vauthors=Watson JD, Baker TA, Bell SP, Gann AA, Levine M, Losick RM | title=Molecular Biology of the Gene | publisher=Pearson | edition=7th | year=2013}}</ref>\n\nAfter binding to the DNA, the RNA polymerase switches from a closed complex to an open complex.  This change involves the separation of the DNA strands to form an unwound section of DNA of approximately 13 bp, referred to as the \"[[transcription bubble]]\".  [[Supercoiling]] plays an important part in polymerase activity because of the unwinding and rewinding of DNA.  Because regions of DNA in front of RNAP are unwound, there are compensatory positive supercoils.  Regions behind RNAP are rewound and negative supercoils are present.<ref name=\"MBOG\"/>\n\n=== Promoter escape ===\nRNA polymerase then starts to synthesize the initial DNA-RNA heteroduplex, with ribonucleotides base-paired to the template DNA strand according to Watson-Crick base-pairing interactions.  As noted above, RNA polymerase makes contacts with the promoter region. However these stabilizing contacts inhibit the enzyme's ability to access DNA further downstream and thus the synthesis of the full-length product. In order to continue RNA synthesis, RNA polymerase must escape the promoter. It must maintain promoter contacts while unwinding more downstream DNA for synthesis, [[DNA scrunching|\"scrunching\"]] more downstream DNA into the initiation complex.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Revyakin A, Liu C, Ebright RH, Strick TR | title = Abortive initiation and productive initiation by RNA polymerase involve DNA scrunching | journal = Science | volume = 314 | issue = 5802 | pages = 1139\u201343 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17110577 | pmc = 2754787 | doi = 10.1126/science.1131398 | bibcode = 2006Sci...314.1139R }}</ref> During the promoter escape transition, RNA polymerase is considered a \"stressed intermediate.\"  Thermodynamically the stress accumulates from the DNA-unwinding and DNA-compaction activities. Once the DNA-RNA heteroduplex is long enough (~10 bp), RNA polymerase releases its upstream contacts and effectively achieves the promoter escape transition into the elongation phase. The heteroduplex at the active center stabilizes the elongation complex.\n\nHowever, promoter escape is not the only outcome. RNA polymerase can also relieve the stress by releasing its downstream contacts, arresting transcription.  The paused transcribing complex has two options: (1) release the nascent transcript and begin anew at the promoter or (2) reestablish a new 3'OH on the nascent transcript at the active site via RNA polymerase's catalytic activity and recommence DNA scrunching to achieve promoter escape. [[Abortive initiation]], the unproductive cycling of RNA polymerase before the promoter escape transition, results in short RNA fragments of around 9 bp in a process known as abortive transcription. The extent of abortive initiation depends on the presence of transcription factors and the strength of the promoter contacts.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Goldman SR, Ebright RH, Nickels BE | title = Direct detection of abortive RNA transcripts in vivo | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5929 | pages = 927\u20138 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19443781 | pmc = 2718712 | doi = 10.1126/science.1169237 | bibcode = 2009Sci...324..927G | authorlink2 = Richard H.

This hairpin structure is often rich in G-C base-pairs, making it more stable than the DNA-RNA hybrid itself.  As a result, the 8 bp DNA-RNA hybrid in the transcription complex shifts to a 4 bp hybrid.  These last 4 base pairs are weak A-U base pairs, and the entire RNA transcript will fall off the DNA.\n\nTranscription termination in eukaryotes is less well understood than in bacteria, but involves cleavage of the new transcript followed by template-independent addition of adenines at its new 3' end, in a process called [[polyadenylation]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lykke-Andersen S, Jensen TH | title = Overlapping pathways dictate termination of RNA polymerase II transcription | journal = Biochimie | volume = 89 | issue = 10 | pages = 1177\u201382 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17629387 | doi = 10.1016/j.biochi.2007.05.007 }}</ref>\n\n==Other organisms==\nGiven that DNA and RNA polymerases both carry out template-dependent nucleotide polymerization, it might be expected that the two types of enzymes would be structurally related.

It was for more than a century the center of a large, thriving [[plantation economy|plantation]], and the only private residence in the United States visited by George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nChatham also reflected the new country's racial tensions. In January 1805, Chatham's slaves overpowered and whipped their overseer and assistants in a minor [[slave rebellion]].  An armed posse of white men quickly gathered. They killed one slave in the attack, and two more died trying to escape capture. Two other slaves were deported, likely to the Caribbean or Louisiana, and Fitzhugh soon sold the property.\n\nFive decades later, in 1857, owner Hannah Jones Coalter (the 77-year-old mother of a disabled daughter named Janet), died and attempted to manumit her 93 slaves after making provision both for her daughter and them. Her relatives sued, claiming that after the [[Dred Scott decision]], slaves were legally incapable of choosing whether to remain enslaved or receive their freedom and enough money to establish themselves in another state. While local judges thought the executors should free the slaves per Hannah's intent, a divided Virginia Supreme Court disagreed. Thus, the executors sold Chatham with its slaves to J. Horace Lacy (husband of Hannah's much younger half-sister Betty), although soon one slave was allowed to travel to raise money to buy freedom for herself and her small family, and succeeded.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, the Lacys abandoned Chatham. Its strategic site overlooking Fredericksburg briefly served as Union headquarters, and later as the major Union hospital during battles for control of the strategic Virginia city and [[Spotsylvania County, Virginia|Spotsylvania county]] en route to the Confederate capital. Due to wartime use and disuse, Chatham fell into great disrepair.  The Lacys ultimately sold Chatham to pay taxes (including on their other estate, [[Ellwood Manor]]) in 1872.  Saved from total destruction as the 20th Century began by a series of wealthy American owners, Chatham was refurbished and became a showpiece. Willed to the National Park Service in 1975, the estate now serves as the headquarters for the [[Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park]].\n\n==Antebellum==\n{{North American Slave Revolts}}\n[[File:Chatham Mansion, Fredericksburg, Virginia. Where George Washington and Robert E. Lee did their courting. Lincoln... - NARA - 516529.jpg|thumb|right|Chatham Manor in 1929]]\nWealthy lawyer and [[Planter (American South)|planter]] William Fitzhugh financed building the [[Plantation house in the Southern United States|main house]] at Chatham over three-years ending in 1771.  He was a friend and colleague of [[George Washington]], whose family's farm was just down the [[Rappahannock River]] from Chatham. Washington's diaries note that he was a frequent guest at Chatham. He and Fitzhugh had served together in the [[House of Burgesses]] prior to the [[American Revolution]], and shared a love of farming and horses. Fitzhugh's daughter, [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis|Molly]], would marry the first president's step-grandson, [[George Washington Parke Custis]] as well as becoming a leading abolitionist together with her friend [[Annefield (Boyce, Virginia)|Ann Randolph Meade Page]]. [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Their daughter Mary Anna]], born at Ann Page's estate, would later wed the future Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]], who freed the Custis slaves as executor after his in-laws' deaths.\n\nThe {{convert|1280|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] included an orchard, mill, and a race track where Fitzhugh's horses vied with those of other planters for prize money. Fizhugh named the mansion after the British parliamentarian [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]], who championed many of the opinions held by American colonists prior to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/frsp/chatham.htm Copied from \"Chatham Manor\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050613082214/http://www.nps.gov/frsp/chatham.htm |date=June 13, 2005 }}, National Park Service, accessed 11 Apr 2009</ref> Flanking the main house were dozens of supporting structures: slave quarters, a dairy, ice house, barns, stables. Down on the river were fish traps.\n\nFitzhugh sold the Chatham plantation to Major Churchill Jones, who had served under Col. William Washington and Gen. Light Horse Harry Lee. The elderly Fitzhugh then moved to a city house in Alexandria, Virginia. Jones was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati, and greatly improved the estate: adding terraces down to the Rappahannock River, as well as began constructing the first bridge across that river to Fredericksburg (it took a year and half to build and but washed away in the flood of 1826, slightly more than three years after Churchill Jones died). Churchill's brother William Jones had long owned an estate, [[Ellwood Manor]], in Spotsylvania County, and inherited Chatham around the time his wife of 40 years had died. Hannah Jones Coalter was William's daughter by his first wife, and after her first husband died, she married three-time widower (and [[Virginia Supreme Court|Virginia Court of Appeals]] judge [[John Coalter]] (1771\u20131838)) in 1825 and received the deed to Chatham as their wedding present. Meanwhile, the 78 year old William Jones then remarried, to Lucy Gordon, his late wife's niece. Their 18-year marriage produced a daughter, Betty Churchill Jones, who in 1848 married her former tutor, James Horace Lacy of Mississippi, son of a Presbyterian minister.<ref>Jerrilyn Eby, They Called Stafford Home: The Development of Stafford County, Virginia from 1600 until 1865 (Heritage Books Inc. pp. 280-281)</ref>\n\nChatham remained known for its hospitality: [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Monroe]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] often visited Chatham, as later did [[Washington Irving]].  Irving visited twice, while doing research for his multi-volume biography of George Washington, for whom he was named.\n\nHannah survived her last husband by nearly two decades, as did her disabled daughter Janet. The wealthy widow attempted to provide for her daughter's care, as well as free her household's administrator, Charles, and 92 other slaves in her will. However, the Virginia Constitution of 1851 (and earlier Virginia laws) required manumitted slaves to leave the state within a year, so (as had none other than the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[John Marshall]] for one slave), Hannah gave her each of slaves (other than Charles, who was freed outright) the choice of remaining enslaved in Virginia (but choosing their mistresses/masters) or manumission and a small stake to enable them to support themselves in another state or country. Her estate other than the slaves was valued at $15000 to $20,000, so they could be provided for. However, her executor (presumably emboldened by Betty and her husband) sought court instruction as to their duties. While the local Stafford court thought the slaves should be freed, the Virginia Supreme Court disagreed. In 'Williamson v. Coalter,' 14 Gratton 394 (1858), a majority of three justices refused to uphold Hannah's testamentary wishes, although she had revised the will shortly before she died in order to circumvent another recent decision refusing to uphold manumissions (Bailey v. Poindexter's executor). Her neighbor Justice Richard C.L. Moncure dissented vehemently, joined by Justice Samuels, who died shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~elacey/chatham.htm|title=RootsWeb.com Home Page|website=homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com}}</ref> So Lacy bought Chatham for about $35,000, but as discussed below, ultimately sold it in 1872 to a Pennsylvania banker for $23,900.<ref>Eby at 283</ref>\n\n==Slavery at Chatham==\nFitzhugh had owned upwards of 100 [[slavery|slaves]] as well as about 49,000 acres of land (including roughly 6000 at Chatham), with anywhere from 60 to 90 being used at Chatham, depending on the season. Most worked as field hands or house servants, but he also employed skilled tradesmen such as [[miller]]s, [[carpenter]]s, and [[blacksmith]]s. Little physical evidence remains to show where slaves lived; until recently, most knowledge of slaves at Chatham was from written records.\n\nIn January 1805, a number of Chatham slaves rebelled after an overseer ordered slaves back to work at what they considered was too soon after the Christmas holidays. The slaves overpowered and whipped their overseer and four others who tried to force them back to work. An armed posse put down the rebellion and punished those involved. One black man was executed, two died while trying to escape, and two others were deported, perhaps to a slave colony in the [[Caribbean]], or to Louisiana.\n\nWilliam Churchill gave Chatham as a wedding present for his widowed daughter Hannah and the three-time widowed Judge John Coalter. Coalter died in 1838, so Chatham passed to his wife Hannah, who did not remarry (married women at the time could only hold property through their husbands). Hannah Coalter owned 51 slaves in the 1850 census, and, as an anti-slavery Methodist unlike her late husband, tried to free slaves through her will upon her death in 1857.<ref>Ruth Coder Fitzgerald, A Different Story: A Black History of Fredericksburg, Stafford and Spottsylvania Virginia (Unicorn, 1979), pp. 22, 86.

Horace Lacy]], a prosperous businessman and slaveowner at Ellwood Plantation further to the south in the Wilderness area of Spotyslvania County. Lacy convinced the will's executors to seek court direction. The Stafford court upheld the manumissions, but the Virginia Court of Appeals (the name at the time of the [[Virginia Supreme Court]]) in a 3 to 2 decision overturned the 92 conditional manumissions (only upholding Charles' outright manumission). The court denied Coalter's slaves any chance of freedom by ruling that the 1857 [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'' decision]] by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] had declared that slaves were property, and not persons with choice.<ref>Paul Finkelman, The law of slavery and Bondage: a casebook(NYU)p.132</ref><ref>[[Moncure Conway]], Autobiography vol. 1, pp. 38-39 available at google books</ref>\n\nEllen Mitchell, an enslaved laundress at \"Chatham\", had known of and counted on Mrs. Coalter's promise of manumission. When Lacy's court case took her freedom away, Mitchell, irate, loudly proclaimed how unfair this denial was, particularly as she feared being sent to a plantation in Monroe, Louisiana.<ref name=\"fredericksburghistory.wordpress.com\"/> To be rid of her (and the problem she represented), Lacy sold her to a slave trader, James Aler,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fredericksburghistory.wordpress.com/2010/08/15/george-aler-and-his-slave-jail/|title=George Aler slave trader|date=15 August 2010|publisher=}}</ref> in Fredericksburg. Aler, active in his church and unsure what to do with Mitchell, allowed her a 90-day pass to leave Fredericksburg in early 1860 on a tour during which she and one of her sons attempted to raise money to buy their freedom for $1000. She gave speeches to church and political groups in Washington City, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, raising enough money to return to Fredericksburg and buy not only her own freedom, but also that of her children. Lacy, impressed, also freed Mitchell's mother. The Mitchell family moved to Cincinnati in the free (i.e. slavery-prohibited) state of [[Ohio]]. In the 1860 census, Ellen Mitchell was listed as running a laundry business. Today, some of her descendants still live in that area of Ohio.<ref name=\"fredericksburghistory.wordpress.com\"/>\n\nThe 1860 census indicated that Lacy owned 39 slaves at Chatham and another 49 at his Ellwood plantation, as well as some slaves which he rented out. An outspoken proponent of slavery, Lacy joined the Confederate Army and rose to the rank of major; his brother Beverly Tucker Lacy (a Presbyterian minister) was the chaplain for General [[Stonewall Jackson]], whose amputated arm was buried at Ellwood Plantation near Hannah Coalter's grave. At least two former slaves at Chatham served in the U.S. Colored Troops and survived the war, Charles Sprout and Andrew Weaver, and one may have served as a Confederate scout.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://npsfrsp.wordpress.com/2010/07/20/i-was-a-slave-of-major-horace-lacy-andrew-weaver-of-the-23rd-united-states-colored-troops/|title=\"I was a slave of Major Horace Lacy.\" \u2013 Andrew Weaver of the 23rd United States Colored Troops|date=20 July 2010|publisher=}}</ref> Thus, slavery at Chatham ended in 1865 as a result of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], upon the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] abolishing the institution.\n\n[[National Park Service]] historians and others continue research, seeking to locate the former slave quarters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://npsfrsp.wordpress.com/2010/04/01/j-horace-lacy%E2%80%99s-chatham-quarters-part-1/|title=J.

An 1862 sketch by a Unionist [[New Jersey]] soldier during the Civil War shows some buildings at the Chatham site that were long gone by the time historians began speculating that most slave dwellings were likely to be in the \"rear\", or the field-side area of the estate. This area had been cultivated since the slave days and in the 20th century new structures were built there. The recently discovered sketch shows structures to the south side of the manor house, in an area across a ravine away from the central area of the property. Re-examination of old photographs shows the faint rooflines of structures in that area, which may indicate the location of heretofore unconfirmed slave dwellings.\n\n==The Civil War==\n[[File:Virginia, Falmouth, Lacy House - NARA - 533303.tif|thumb|right|Chatham Manor, 1862. From the [[National Archives and Records Administration]].]]\nThe Civil War brought change and destruction to Chatham. As discussed above, the house was owned by James Horace Lacy (1823\u20131906), a former schoolteacher who had married Churchill Jones's niece. As a planter, Lacy sympathized with the South, and at the age of 37 he left Chatham to serve the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] as a staff officer. He served on the staff of General [[Gustavus W. Smith]] at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], and also served as field transportation inspector in the Trans-Mississippi Department.<ref>Homer D. Musselman, Stafford County in the Civil War, p. 89</ref> His wife and children remained at Chatham until the spring of 1862, when Union troops' arrival forced them to abandon the building and move in with relatives across the river in soon-beleaguered [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], and after its fall later to [[Pulaski County, Virginia|Pulaski County]].<ref>http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~elacey/chatham.htm Original at Virginia Historical Society</ref>\n\nFor much of the next thirteen months, Chatham was occupied by the [[Union army]]; orders, reports and letters referred to it as the \"Lacy House\". Northern officers initially used the mansion as a headquarters. In April 1862, General [[Irvin McDowell]] brought 30,000 men to Fredericksburg and supervised the repair of the [[Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad]] and construction of several bridges across the [[Rappahannock River]] from Chatham. McDowell planned to use the new bridges to march south and join forces with the [[Army of the Potomac]] outside [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].\n\nPresident [[Abraham Lincoln]] journeyed to Fredericksburg to confer with McDowell about the movement, meeting with the general and his staff at Chatham. His visit gave Chatham the distinction of being one of three houses visited by both Lincoln and Washington (the other two are [[Mount Vernon]] and [[Berkeley Plantation]] on the James River east of Richmond.) While at Chatham, Lincoln went to Fredericksburg, walked its streets, and visited a New York regiment encamped on what would become known as \"Marye's Heights\" during a later battle.\n\nSeven months after Lincoln's visit, fighting again erupted at Fredericksburg. In November 1862, General [[Ambrose E. Burnside]] brought the 120,000-man [[Army of the Potomac]] to Fredericksburg.  Using [[pontoon bridge]]s, Burnside crossed the Rappahannock River below Chatham, seized Fredericksburg, and launched a series of bloody assaults against [[Robert E. Lee|Lee's]] [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]], who held the high ground behind the town. One of Burnside's top generals, [[Edwin Sumner]], observed the battle from Chatham, while Union artillery batteries shelled the Confederates from adjacent bluffs. Furthermore, a German Military Observer, Count [[Zeppelin]], from Chatham's lawn sent up a reconnaissance balloon with a soldier to observe the battle, an incidence he later often recounted after starting his air craft factory.<ref>\nalvin T. Embrey, History of Fredericksburg, Virginia (Old Dominion Press, 1937) p.189</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] became a disastrous Union defeat. Burnside suffered 12,600 casualties, many of whom were brought back to Chatham and the nearby [[Conway House (Falmouth, Virginia)]] for care. For several days, army surgeons operated on hundreds of soldiers inside the house. Assisting them were volunteers, including the poet [[Walt Whitman]], [[Clara Barton]] (who later founded the American chapter of the International [[Red Cross]]), and Dr. [[Mary Edwards Walker]] (as of 2015 the only woman awarded the [[Medal of Honor]]).\n\nWhitman had come to Chatham searching for a brother wounded in the fighting. The carnage shocked him. He later wrote a published a description that, outside the house, at the foot of a tree, he noticed \"a heap of amputated feet, legs, arms, hands, etc.-about a load for a one-horse cart. Several dead bodies lie near,\" he added, \"each covered with its brown woolen blanket.\"<citation needed> More than 130 Union soldiers died at Chatham and were initially buried on the grounds. After the war, their bodies were removed to the [[Fredericksburg National Cemetery]]. Years later when three additional bodies were discovered, the remains were buried at Chatham at the outskirts of the again-famous gardens, in graves marked by granite stones lying flush to the ground.\n\nIn the winter following the battle, the Union army camped in [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]], behind Chatham. The Confederate army occupied [[Spotsylvania County, Virginia|Spotsylvania County]], across the river. Opposing [[picket (military)|pickets]] patrolled the riverfront, keeping a wary eye on their foe. Occasionally the men would trade newspapers and other articles using miniature sailboats.  When not on duty, Union pickets slept at Chatham; [[Dorothea Dix]] of the [[United States Sanitary Commission]] operated a [[soup kitchen]] in the house. As the winter progressed and firewood became scarce, some soldiers tore paneling from the walls for fuel, exposing the underlying plaster. Some of the soldiers' pencil graffiti is still visible, with additional scrawls being deciphered by Park Service staff.\n\nMilitary activity resumed in the spring. In April, the new Union commander, General [[Joseph Hooker]], led most of the army upriver, crossing behind Lee's troops. Other portions remained in Stafford County, including [[John Gibbons]]' division at Chatham. The Confederates marched out to meet Hooker's main force and for a week fighting raged around a country crossroad known as [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]]. At the same time, Union troops crossed the Rappahannock at Fredericksburg and drove a Confederate force off [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg|Marye's Heights]], behind the town. Many of 1,000 casualties suffered by the Union army in that 1863 engagement were sent back to Chatham, which again served as a hospital.\n\n==Postwar years==\n[[File:Chatham Manor House.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Chatham Manor, [[Historic American Buildings Survey]]]]\nBy the time the Civil War ended in 1865, Chatham was desolate and severely damaged. When the Lacys returned in November 1865, over 750 panes of glass had been broken, blood stains spotted the floors, graffiti marred its bare plaster walls and much of the interior wood paneling had been removed for firewood.  In addition the surrounding forests had been cut down for fuel, the gardens and several of the outbuildings where damaged or destroyed, and the lawn had been used as a graveyard. Some of their furniture had been evacuated, but the transport boat sank in the Rappahannock, ruining much of it. Over the next years, the Union Burial Corps removed many soldiers' remains from the gardens and lawn for reburial at the new national cemetery in Fredericksburg. Unable to maintain their home properly without slaves, they moved to their house known as \"Ellwood\" and sold Chatham in 1872 to a Pennsylvania banker for $23,900.<ref>Eby at 282-3</ref> Betty Lacy helped found the Ladies Memorial Association of Federicksburg, establishing the Confederate Cemetery, and her husband traveled and made speeches to raise money.<ref>Musselman p. 89</ref>\n\nThe property had a succession of owners until the 1920s, when General [[Daniel Bradford Devore]] (1860\u20131956) and his wife Helen Stewart Devore undertook its restoration (and made significant changes). Their restoration re-oriented the house away from the west front on the river (no longer the main transportation route); the east entrance became the main entrance, easily reached by the automobile. They also added a large, walled English-style garden designed by the noted [[landscape architect]] [[Ellen Biddle Shipman]] on the east side. As a result of the DeVores' efforts, Chatham regained its place among Virginia's finest homes. However, the DeVores sold Chatham in 1931 to move to Washington D.C., where they built a townhouse later also designated a historic site (and once offered to become the official residence of the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-structures.com/washington_dc/dc/devore-chase_house.php|title=Devore-Chase House, Washington DC|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nToday the house and the {{convert|85|acre|m2}} of surrounding grounds are open to the public. The last private owners, [[Northern Neck]] native and General Motors executive [[John Lee Pratt]] and his wife, purchased the Chatham estate (shrunken to 256 acres) from the Devores in 1931 for $150,000 cash. They were looking ahead to retirement.  During World War II, Pratt served as one of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt's]] \"dollar-a-year\" men, Pratt met and had as visitors Generals [[George Marshall]] and [[Dwight Eisenhower]], among many others, essentially to get away from Washington to relax and go duck hunting. Chatham's distinction thus continued during their ownership, as the Pratts did retire to the home and use it as a working \"gentleman's\" farm although he continued to serve on the General Motors Board of Directors until 1968.\n\nUpon Pratt's death in 1975, he bequeathed land around the mansion to Stafford County for parks, as well as a large section to the region's [[YMCA]].  This also left the manor house and approximately {{convert|30|acre|m2}} surrounding it to the [[National Park Service]] (NPS), which uses it as the headquarters for the [[Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park]].\n\nFive rooms are open as a (free) museum during designated hours (with explanatory video tour); the grounds are open to the public. The rest of the house and outbuildings serve as administrative offices and maintenance facilities. In 2014, the National Park Service undertook tree removal designed to improve the vistas to and from Chatham. This increased the house's visibility from the city, as well as essentially restoring the view to what it had been during the Civil War and preceding decades.\n\nSince 2012 the Friends of Chatham, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, has provided additional support for the preservation of the historic house and its grounds.<ref>http://friendsofchatham.org/</ref>  Partnering with local [[Rotary International|Rotary]] and garden clubs, the Friends group supplements NPS-budgeted services by providing extensive garden maintenance and plantings. It has also undertaken repairs of the 1940s-era summer house at the edge of the gardens and a statue of Pan in a scenic gazebo overlooking the sity which was damaged by vandals in 2002, and has begun repairing all 80-plus windows in the original house and outbuildings.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nImage:Dairy Barn c.1900.JPG|Dairy Barn (c.1900)\nImage:Fish Hatcheries.JPG|Garden Seedling Cold Frames(1935)\nImage:Greenhouse 1935.JPG|Greenhouse (1935)\nImage:Kitchen 1768.JPG|Kitchen (1768)\nImage:Laundry 1768.JPG|Laundry (1768)\nImage:Stable and Garage c.1900.JPG|Stable and Garage (c.1900)\nImage:Summer House 1940.JPG|Summer House (1940)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]\n* [[Historic houses in Virginia]]\n* [[Slave rebellions]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.nps.gov/frsp/learn/historyculture/chatham.htm Chatham Manor \"Chatham Manor\"], National Park Service website\n* [http://www.nps.gov/history/NR/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/45chatham/45chatham.htm ''Chatham Plantation: Witness to the Civil War''], a National Park Service Teaching with Historic Places (TwHP) lesson plan\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1805]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Museums in Fredericksburg, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Historic house museums in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Fitzhugh family residences]]\n[[Category:Virginia in the American Civil War]]\n[[Category:Plantations in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Plantation houses in Virginia]]\n[[Category:American Civil War museums in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Georgian architecture in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Slave rebellions in the United States]]\n[[Category:Houses in Stafford County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Stafford County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Historic district contributing properties in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Slave cabins and quarters in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Coord|38|18|31.8|N|77|27|19.3|W|display=title}}\n{{Infobox NRHP\n  | name           = Chatham Manor\n  | partof         = Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania County Battlefields Memorial National Military Park\n  | nrhp_type      = cp\n  | nocat          = yes\n  | image          = US VA Falmouth Chatham Manor.jpg\n  | caption        = Chatham Manor, March 2008\n  | nearest_city   = [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]]\n  | locmapin       = USA Virginia Northern#USA Virginia#USA\n  | built          = 1771\n  | builder        = [[William Fitzhugh]]\n  | architecture   = Georgian\n  | added          = October 15, 1966\n  | area           = {{convert|4601.1|acre}}\n  | governing_body = Federal \n  | partof_refnum  = = 66000046<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n}}\n\n'''Chatham Manor''' is the [[Georgian-style]] home completed in 1771 by farmer and statesman [[William Fitzhugh]], after about 3 years of construction, on the [[Rappahannock River]] in [[Stafford County, Virginia]], opposite [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]]. It was for more than a century the center of a large, thriving [[plantation economy|plantation]], and the only private residence in the United States visited by George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Dwight D. Eisenhower.\n\nChatham also reflected the new country's racial tensions. In January 1805, Chatham's slaves overpowered and whipped their overseer and assistants in a minor [[slave rebellion]].  An armed posse of white men quickly gathered. They killed one slave in the attack, and two more died trying to escape capture. Two other slaves were deported, likely to the Caribbean or Louisiana, and Fitzhugh soon sold the property.\n\nFive decades later, in 1857, owner Hannah Jones Coalter (the 77-year-old mother of a disabled daughter named Janet), died and attempted to manumit her 93 slaves after making provision both for her daughter and them. Her relatives sued, claiming that after the [[Dred Scott decision]], slaves were legally incapable of choosing whether to remain enslaved or receive their freedom and enough money to establish themselves in another state. While local judges thought the executors should free the slaves per Hannah's intent, a divided Virginia Supreme Court disagreed. Thus, the executors sold Chatham with its slaves to J. Horace Lacy (husband of Hannah's much younger half-sister Betty), although soon one slave was allowed to travel to raise money to buy freedom for herself and her small family, and succeeded.\n\nDuring the American Civil War, the Lacys abandoned Chatham, and ultimately sold it to pay taxes (including on their other estate, [[Ellwood Manor]]) in 1872. Its strategic site overlooking Fredericksburg briefly served as Union headquarters, and later as the major Union hospital during battles for control of the strategic Virginia city and [[Spotsylvania County, Virginia|Spotsylvania county]] en route to the Confederate capital. Due to wartime use and disuse, Chatham fell into great disrepair. Saved from total destruction as the 20th Century began by a series of wealthy American owners, Chatham was refurbished and became a showpiece. Willed to the National Park Service in 1975, the estate now serves as the headquarters for the [[Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park]].\n\n==Antebellum==\n{{North American Slave Revolts}}\n[[File:Chatham Mansion, Fredericksburg, Virginia. Where George Washington and Robert E. Lee did their courting. Lincoln... - NARA - 516529.jpg|thumb|right|Chatham Manor in 1929]]\nWealthy lawyer and [[Planter (American South)|planter]] William Fitzhugh financed building the [[Plantation house in the Southern United States|main house]] at Chatham over three-years ending in 1771.  He was a friend and colleague of [[George Washington]], whose family's farm was just down the [[Rappahannock River]] from Chatham. Washington's diaries note that he was a frequent guest at Chatham. He and Fitzhugh had served together in the [[House of Burgesses]] prior to the [[American Revolution]], and shared a love of farming and horses. Fitzhugh's daughter, [[Mary Lee Fitzhugh Custis|Molly]], would marry the first president's step-grandson, [[George Washington Parke Custis]] as well as becoming a leading abolitionist together with her friend [[Annefield (Boyce, Virginia)|Ann Randolph Meade Page]]. [[Mary Anna Custis Lee|Their daughter Mary Anna]], born at Ann Page's estate, would later wed the future Confederate General [[Robert E. Lee]], who freed the Custis slaves as executor after his in-laws' deaths.\n\nThe {{convert|1280|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] included an orchard, mill, and a race track where Fitzhugh's horses vied with those of other planters for prize money. Fizhugh named the mansion after the British parliamentarian [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]], who championed many of the opinions held by American colonists prior to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/frsp/chatham.htm Copied from \"Chatham Manor\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050613082214/http://www.nps.gov/frsp/chatham.htm |date=June 13, 2005 }}, National Park Service, accessed 11 Apr 2009</ref> Flanking the main house were dozens of supporting structures: slave quarters, a dairy, ice house, barns, stables. Down on the river were fish traps.\n\nFitzhugh sold the Chatham plantation to Major Churchill Jones, who had served under Col. William Washington and Gen. Light Horse Harry Lee. The elderly Fitzhugh then moved to a city house in Alexandria, Virginia. Jones was a member of the Society of the Cincinnati, and greatly improved the estate: adding terraces down to the Rappahannock River, as well as began constructing the first bridge across that river to Fredericksburg (it took a year and half to build and but washed away in the flood of 1826, slightly more than three years after Churchill Jones died). Churchill's brother William Jones had long owned an estate, [[Ellwood Manor]], in Spotsylvania County, and inherited Chatham around the time his wife of 40 years had died. Hannah Jones Coalter was William's daughter by his first wife, and after her first husband died, she married three-time widower (and [[Virginia Supreme Court|Virginia Court of Appeals]] judge [[John Coalter]] (1771\u20131838)) in 1825 and received the deed to Chatham as their wedding present. Meanwhile, the 78 year old William Jones then remarried, to Lucy Gordon, his late wife's niece. Their 18-year marriage produced a daughter, Betty Churchill Jones, who in 1848 married her former tutor, James Horace Lacy of Mississippi, son of a Presbyterian minister.<ref>Jerrilyn Eby, They Called Stafford Home: The Development of Stafford County, Virginia from 1600 until 1865 (Heritage Books Inc. pp. 280-281)</ref>\n\nChatham remained known for its hospitality: [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[James Monroe]] and [[William Henry Harrison]] often visited Chatham, as later did [[Washington Irving]].  Irving visited twice, while doing research for his multi-volume biography of George Washington, for whom he was named.\n\nHannah survived her last husband by nearly two decades, as did her disabled daughter Janet. The wealthy widow attempted to provide for her daughter's care, as well as free her household's administrator, Charles, and 92 other slaves in her will. However, the Virginia Constitution of 1851 (and earlier Virginia laws) required manumitted slaves to leave the state within a year, so (as had none other than the late U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[John Marshall]] for one slave), Hannah gave her each of slaves (other than Charles, who was freed outright) the choice of remaining enslaved in Virginia (but choosing their mistresses/masters) or manumission and a small stake to enable them to support themselves in another state or country. Her estate other than the slaves was valued at $15000 to $20,000, so they could be provided for. However, her executor (presumably emboldened by Betty and her husband) sought court instruction as to their duties. While the local Stafford court thought the slaves should be freed, the Virginia Supreme Court disagreed. In 'Williamson v. Coalter,' 14 Gratton 394 (1858), a majority of three justices refused to uphold Hannah's testamentary wishes, although she had revised the will shortly before she died in order to circumvent another recent decision refusing to uphold manumissions (Bailey v. Poindexter's executor). Her neighbor Justice Richard C.L. Moncure dissented vehemently, joined by Justice Samuels, who died shortly thereafter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~elacey/chatham.htm|title=RootsWeb.com Home Page|website=homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com}}</ref> So Lacy bought Chatham for about $35,000, but as discussed below, ultimately sold it in 1872 to a Pennsylvania banker for $23,900.<ref>Eby at 283</ref>\n\n==Slavery at Chatham==\nFitzhugh had owned upwards of 100 [[slavery|slaves]] as well as about 49,000 acres of land (including roughly 6000 at Chatham), with anywhere from 60 to 90 being used at Chatham, depending on the season. Most worked as field hands or house servants, but he also employed skilled tradesmen such as [[miller]]s, [[carpenter]]s, and [[blacksmith]]s. Little physical evidence remains to show where slaves lived; until recently, most knowledge of slaves at Chatham was from written records.\n\nIn January 1805, a number of Chatham slaves rebelled after an overseer ordered slaves back to work at what they considered was too soon after the Christmas holidays. The slaves overpowered and whipped their overseer and four others who tried to force them back to work. An armed posse put down the rebellion and punished those involved. One black man was executed, two died while trying to escape, and two others were deported, perhaps to a slave colony in the [[Caribbean]], or to Louisiana.\n\nWilliam Churchill gave Chatham as a wedding present for his widowed daughter Hannah and the three-time widowed Judge John Coalter. Coalter died in 1838, so Chatham passed to his wife Hannah, who did not remarry (married women at the time could only hold property through their husbands). Hannah Coalter owned 51 slaves in the 1850 census, and, as an anti-slavery Methodist unlike her late husband, tried to free slaves through her will upon her death in 1857.<ref>Ruth Coder Fitzgerald, A Different Story: A Black History of Fredericksburg, Stafford and Spottsylvania Virginia (Unicorn, 1979), pp. 22, 86.

Horace Lacy]], a prosperous businessman and slaveowner at Ellwood Plantation further to the south in the Wilderness area of Spotyslvania County. Lacy convinced the will's executors to seek court direction. The Stafford court upheld the manumissions, but the Virginia Court of Appeals (the name at the time of the [[Virginia Supreme Court]]) in a 3 to 2 decision overturned the 92 conditional manumissions (only upholding Charles' outright manumission). The court denied Coalter's slaves any chance of freedom by ruling that the 1857 [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'' decision]] by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] had declared that slaves were property, and not persons with choice.<ref>Paul Finkelman, The law of slavery and Bondage: a casebook(NYU)p.132</ref><ref>[[Moncure Conway]], Autobiography vol. 1, pp. 38-39 available at google books</ref>\n\nEllen Mitchell, an enslaved laundress at \"Chatham\", had known of and counted on Mrs. Coalter's promise of manumission. When Lacy's court case took her freedom away, Mitchell, irate, loudly proclaimed how unfair this denial was, particularly as she feared being sent to a plantation in Monroe, Louisiana.<ref name=\"fredericksburghistory.wordpress.com\"/> To be rid of her (and the problem she represented), Lacy sold her to a slave trader, James Aler,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fredericksburghistory.wordpress.com/2010/08/15/george-aler-and-his-slave-jail/|title=George Aler slave trader|date=15 August 2010|publisher=}}</ref> in Fredericksburg. Aler, active in his church and unsure what to do with Mitchell, allowed her a 90-day pass to leave Fredericksburg in early 1860 on a tour during which she and one of her sons attempted to raise money to buy their freedom for $1000. She gave speeches to church and political groups in Washington City, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, raising enough money to return to Fredericksburg and buy not only her own freedom, but also that of her children. Lacy, impressed, also freed Mitchell's mother. The Mitchell family moved to Cincinnati in the free (i.e. slavery-prohibited) state of [[Ohio]]. In the 1860 census, Ellen Mitchell was listed as running a laundry business. Today, some of her descendants still live in that area of Ohio.<ref name=\"fredericksburghistory.wordpress.com\"/>\n\nThe 1860 census indicated that Lacy owned 39 slaves at Chatham and another 49 at his Ellwood plantation, as well as some slaves which he rented out. An outspoken proponent of slavery, Lacy joined the Confederate Army and rose to the rank of major; his brother Beverly Tucker Lacy (a Presbyterian minister) was the chaplain for General [[Stonewall Jackson]], whose amputated arm was buried at Ellwood Plantation near Hannah Coalter's grave. At least two former slaves at Chatham served in the U.S. Colored Troops and survived the war, Charles Sprout and Andrew Weaver, and one may have served as a Confederate scout.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://npsfrsp.wordpress.com/2010/07/20/i-was-a-slave-of-major-horace-lacy-andrew-weaver-of-the-23rd-united-states-colored-troops/|title=\"I was a slave of Major Horace Lacy.\" \u2013 Andrew Weaver of the 23rd United States Colored Troops|date=20 July 2010|publisher=}}</ref> Thus, slavery at Chatham ended in 1865 as a result of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], upon the passage of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|constitutional amendment]] abolishing the institution.\n\n[[National Park Service]] historians and others continue research, seeking to locate the former slave quarters.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://npsfrsp.wordpress.com/2010/04/01/j-horace-lacy%E2%80%99s-chatham-quarters-part-1/|title=J.

An 1862 sketch by a Unionist [[New Jersey]] soldier during the Civil War shows some buildings at the Chatham site that were long gone by the time historians began speculating that most slave dwellings were likely to be in the \"rear\", or the field-side area of the estate. This area had been cultivated since the slave days and in the 20th century new structures were built there. The recently discovered sketch shows structures to the south side of the manor house, in an area across a ravine away from the central area of the property. Re-examination of old photographs shows the faint rooflines of structures in that area, which may indicate the location of heretofore unconfirmed slave dwellings.\n\n==The Civil War==\n[[File:Virginia, Falmouth, Lacy House - NARA - 533303.tif|thumb|right|Chatham Manor, 1862. From the [[National Archives and Records Administration]].]]\nThe Civil War brought change and destruction to Chatham. As discussed above, the house was owned by James Horace Lacy (1823\u20131906), a former schoolteacher who had married Churchill Jones's niece. As a planter, Lacy sympathized with the South, and at the age of 37 he left Chatham to serve the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] as a staff officer. He served on the staff of General [[Gustavus W. Smith]] at the [[Battle of Seven Pines]], and also served as field transportation inspector in the Trans-Mississippi Department.<ref>Homer D. Musselman, Stafford County in the Civil War, p. 89</ref> His wife and children remained at Chatham until the spring of 1862, when Union troops' arrival forced them to abandon the building and move in with relatives across the river in soon-beleaguered [[Fredericksburg, Virginia|Fredericksburg]], and after its fall later to [[Pulaski County, Virginia|Pulaski County]].<ref>http://homepages.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~elacey/chatham.htm Original at Virginia Historical Society</ref>\n\nFor much of the next thirteen months, Chatham was occupied by the [[Union army]]; orders, reports and letters referred to it as the \"Lacy House\". Northern officers initially used the mansion as a headquarters. In April 1862, General [[Irvin McDowell]] brought 30,000 men to Fredericksburg and supervised the repair of the [[Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad]] and construction of several bridges across the [[Rappahannock River]] from Chatham. McDowell planned to use the new bridges to march south and join forces with the [[Army of the Potomac]] outside [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].\n\nPresident [[Abraham Lincoln]] journeyed to Fredericksburg to confer with McDowell about the movement, meeting with the general and his staff at Chatham. His visit gave Chatham the distinction of being one of three houses visited by both Lincoln and Washington (the other two are [[Mount Vernon]] and [[Berkeley Plantation]] on the James River east of Richmond.) While at Chatham, Lincoln went to Fredericksburg, walked its streets, and visited a New York regiment encamped on what would become known as \"Marye's Heights\" during a later battle.\n\nSeven months after Lincoln's visit, fighting again erupted at Fredericksburg. In November 1862, General [[Ambrose E. Burnside]] brought the 120,000-man [[Army of the Potomac]] to Fredericksburg.  Using [[pontoon bridge]]s, Burnside crossed the Rappahannock River below Chatham, seized Fredericksburg, and launched a series of bloody assaults against [[Robert E. Lee|Lee's]] [[Confederate States Army|Confederates]], who held the high ground behind the town. One of Burnside's top generals, [[Edwin Sumner]], observed the battle from Chatham, while Union artillery batteries shelled the Confederates from adjacent bluffs. Furthermore, a German Military Observer, Count [[Zeppelin]], from Chatham's lawn sent up a reconnaissance balloon with a soldier to observe the battle, an incidence he later often recounted after starting his air craft factory.<ref>\nalvin T. Embrey, History of Fredericksburg, Virginia (Old Dominion Press, 1937) p.189</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Fredericksburg]] became a disastrous Union defeat. Burnside suffered 12,600 casualties, many of whom were brought back to Chatham and the nearby [[Conway House (Falmouth, Virginia)]] for care. For several days, army surgeons operated on hundreds of soldiers inside the house. Assisting them were volunteers, including the poet [[Walt Whitman]], [[Clara Barton]] (who later founded the American chapter of the International [[Red Cross]]), and Dr. [[Mary Edwards Walker]] (as of 2015 the only woman awarded the [[Medal of Honor]]).\n\nWhitman had come to Chatham searching for a brother wounded in the fighting. The carnage shocked him. He later wrote a published a description that, outside the house, at the foot of a tree, he noticed \"a heap of amputated feet, legs, arms, hands, etc.-about a load for a one-horse cart. Several dead bodies lie near,\" he added, \"each covered with its brown woolen blanket.\"<citation needed> More than 130 Union soldiers died at Chatham and were initially buried on the grounds. After the war, their bodies were removed to the [[Fredericksburg National Cemetery]]. Years later when three additional bodies were discovered, the remains were buried at Chatham at the outskirts of the again-famous gardens, in graves marked by granite stones lying flush to the ground.\n\nIn the winter following the battle, the Union army camped in [[Stafford County, Virginia|Stafford County]], behind Chatham. The Confederate army occupied [[Spotsylvania County, Virginia|Spotsylvania County]], across the river. Opposing [[picket (military)|pickets]] patrolled the riverfront, keeping a wary eye on their foe. Occasionally the men would trade newspapers and other articles using miniature sailboats.  When not on duty, Union pickets slept at Chatham; [[Dorothea Dix]] of the [[United States Sanitary Commission]] operated a [[soup kitchen]] in the house. As the winter progressed and firewood became scarce, some soldiers tore paneling from the walls for fuel, exposing the underlying plaster. Some of the soldiers' pencil graffiti is still visible, with additional scrawls being deciphered by Park Service staff.\n\nMilitary activity resumed in the spring. In April, the new Union commander, General [[Joseph Hooker]], led most of the army upriver, crossing behind Lee's troops. Other portions remained in Stafford County, including [[John Gibbons]]' division at Chatham. The Confederates marched out to meet Hooker's main force and for a week fighting raged around a country crossroad known as [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]]. At the same time, Union troops crossed the Rappahannock at Fredericksburg and drove a Confederate force off [[Second Battle of Fredericksburg|Marye's Heights]], behind the town. Many of 1,000 casualties suffered by the Union army in that 1863 engagement were sent back to Chatham, which again served as a hospital.\n\n==Postwar years==\n[[File:Chatham Manor House.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Chatham Manor, [[Historic American Buildings Survey]]]]\nBy the time the Civil War ended in 1865, Chatham was desolate and severely damaged. When the Lacys returned in November 1865, over 750 panes of glass had been broken, blood stains spotted the floors, graffiti marred its bare plaster walls and much of the interior wood paneling had been removed for firewood.  In addition the surrounding forests had been cut down for fuel, the gardens and several of the outbuildings where damaged or destroyed, and the lawn had been used as a graveyard. Some of their furniture had been evacuated, but the transport boat sank in the Rappahannock, ruining much of it. Over the next years, the Union Burial Corps removed many soldiers' remains from the gardens and lawn for reburial at the new national cemetery in Fredericksburg. Unable to maintain their home properly without slaves, they moved to their house known as \"Ellwood\" and sold Chatham in 1872 to a Pennsylvania banker for $23,900.<ref>Eby at 282-3</ref> Betty Lacy helped found the Ladies Memorial Association of Federicksburg, establishing the Confederate Cemetery, and her husband traveled and made speeches to raise money.<ref>Musselman p. 89</ref>\n\nThe property had a succession of owners until the 1920s, when General [[Daniel Bradford Devore]] (1860\u20131956) and his wife Helen Stewart Devore undertook its restoration (and made significant changes). Their restoration re-oriented the house away from the west front on the river (no longer the main transportation route); the east entrance became the main entrance, easily reached by the automobile. They also added a large, walled English-style garden designed by the noted [[landscape architect]] [[Ellen Biddle Shipman]] on the east side. As a result of the DeVores' efforts, Chatham regained its place among Virginia's finest homes. However, the DeVores sold Chatham in 1931 to move to Washington D.C., where they built a townhouse later also designated a historic site (and once offered to become the official residence of the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historic-structures.com/washington_dc/dc/devore-chase_house.php|title=Devore-Chase House, Washington DC|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nToday the house and the {{convert|85|acre|m2}} of surrounding grounds are open to the public. The last private owners, [[Northern Neck]] native and General Motors executive [[John Lee Pratt]] and his wife, purchased the Chatham estate (shrunken to 256 acres) from the Devores in 1931 for $150,000 cash. They were looking ahead to retirement.  During World War II, Pratt served as one of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt's]] \"dollar-a-year\" men, Pratt met and had as visitors Generals [[George Marshall]] and [[Dwight Eisenhower]], among many others, essentially to get away from Washington to relax and go duck hunting. Chatham's distinction thus continued during their ownership, as the Pratts did retire to the home and use it as a working \"gentleman's\" farm although he continued to serve on the General Motors Board of Directors until 1968.\n\nUpon Pratt's death in 1975, he bequeathed land around the mansion to Stafford County for parks, as well as a large section to the region's [[YMCA]].  This also left the manor house and approximately {{convert|30|acre|m2}} surrounding it to the [[National Park Service]] (NPS), which uses it as the headquarters for the [[Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park]].\n\nFive rooms are open as a (free) museum during designated hours (with explanatory video tour); the grounds are open to the public. The rest of the house and outbuildings serve as administrative offices and maintenance facilities. In 2014, the National Park Service undertook tree removal designed to improve the vistas to and from Chatham. This increased the house's visibility from the city, as well as essentially restoring the view to what it had been during the Civil War and preceding decades.\n\nSince 2012 the Friends of Chatham, a 501(c)3 non-profit organization, has provided additional support for the preservation of the historic house and its grounds.<ref>http://friendsofchatham.org/</ref>  Partnering with local [[Rotary International|Rotary]] and garden clubs, the Friends group supplements NPS-budgeted services by providing extensive garden maintenance and plantings. It has also undertaken repairs of the 1940s-era summer house at the edge of the gardens and a statue of Pan in a scenic gazebo overlooking the sity which was damaged by vandals in 2002, and has begun repairing all 80-plus windows in the original house and outbuildings.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nImage:Dairy Barn c.1900.JPG|Dairy Barn (c.1900)\nImage:Fish Hatcheries.JPG|Garden Seedling Cold Frames(1935)\nImage:Greenhouse 1935.JPG|Greenhouse (1935)\nImage:Kitchen 1768.JPG|Kitchen (1768)\nImage:Laundry 1768.JPG|Laundry (1768)\nImage:Stable and Garage c.1900.JPG|Stable and Garage (c.1900)\nImage:Summer House 1940.JPG|Summer House (1940)\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Battle of Fredericksburg]]\n* [[Historic houses in Virginia]]\n* [[Slave rebellions]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.nps.gov/frsp/learn/historyculture/chatham.htm Chatham Manor \"Chatham Manor\"], National Park Service website\n* [http://www.nps.gov/history/NR/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/45chatham/45chatham.htm ''Chatham Plantation: Witness to the Civil War''], a National Park Service Teaching with Historic Places (TwHP) lesson plan\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1805]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Museums in Fredericksburg, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Historic house museums in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Fitzhugh family residences]]\n[[Category:Virginia in the American Civil War]]\n[[Category:Plantations in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Plantation houses in Virginia]]\n[[Category:American Civil War museums in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Georgian architecture in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Slave rebellions in the United States]]\n[[Category:Houses in Stafford County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania National Military Park]]\n[[Category:National Register of Historic Places in Stafford County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Historic district contributing properties in Virginia]]\n[[Category:Slave cabins and quarters in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "ScottnFred", "label": "safe", "comment": "Moved a sentence in the broad intro to reflect Lacy selling the place.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_Manor"}
