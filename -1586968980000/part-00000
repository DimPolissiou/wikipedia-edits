[[Uintah Basin]] of northeastern Utah. The Duchesne River drains the southwest slope of the [[Uinta Mountains]], and the Strawberry river drains the eastern slopes of the [[Wasatch Range]] and is connected to [[Strawberry Reservoir]]. The two rivers combine at Duchesne, and the Duchesne River continues east to join the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] at [[Ouray, Utah]].\n\nNative stands of [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwood trees]] and willows grow along the river banks, while [[sagebrush]] and [[rabbitbrush]] fill the un-irrigated bench tops. [[Alfalfa]] is the main cultivated crop of farmers in the area.\n\nVia highway, [[Salt Lake City]] is {{convert|114|mi}} to the west, [[Vernal, Utah|Vernal]] is {{convert|58|mi}} to the east, and [[Price, Utah|Price]] is {{convert|54|mi}} to the south.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.5|sqkm|order=flip}}, all of it land.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n==History==\n'''18 September 1776''' The [[Dominguez\u2013Escalante Expedition]] came from the east where they crossed Blue Bench and descended into the valley north of the present-day town of Duchesne. \"We ascended a not very high mesa [Blue Bench] which was level and very stony, traveled about three quarters of a league including ascent and descent, crossed another small river [Duchesne River] which near here enters the San Cosme ([[Strawberry River (Utah)|Strawberry River]]), named it Santa Caterina de Sena, and camped on its banks.\" \"Along these three rivers we have crossed today there is plenty of good land for crops to support three good settlements, with opportunities for irrigation, beautiful cottonwood groves, good pastures, with timber and firewood nearby.\"<ref>Father Escalate journals</ref>\n\n'''1822&ndash;1840''' French Canadian trappers [[\u00c9tienne Provost]], [[Fran\u00e7ois le Clerc]], and [[Antoine Robidoux]] entered the Uintah Basin by way of the Old Spanish Trail and made their fortunes by trapping the many [[North American beaver|beaver]] and trading with the [[Uintah tribe]]. From these French Canadian trappers the Duchesne River and ultimately Duchesne City received its name.\n\n'''1900&ndash;1905''' Leases were arranged with the Ute tribe through the Indian agent \"Major\" H.P. Myton to provide pasture for sheep in and around where Duchesne city is located now. A story passed down from Mrs. William J. Bond about her Father Joseph W. Thomas discusses the area. \"During the winter of 1901 - 02, he (Thomas) hauled supplies from Heber to the now Duchesne area, to the sheep herd camp of John E. Austin, a brother-in-law. Together with three herders, Mr. Thomas tended sheep on the West bench (D-hill) near the (Theodore) cemetery site. They moved the herds to the East desert for the winter months.\nThe Indians had quite a village where Duchesne is now. It was a winter camp and in spring they scattered.\nA fence was stretched across the Indian Canyon as pasture for the horses that grazed there on 8\" and 10\" salt grass.\nSeguesee Jack (Ute tribe leader) refused settlers (sheep herders) permission to trespass the village site. The Indians feared the sheep would eat the good grasses.\" <ref>Mrs. Wm. J. Bond Contributes an Early Story, Duchesne city Library{{https://archive.org/details/mrs.wmjbondcontributesastory/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\n'''1905&ndash;1906''' On June 7, 1905 the Secretary of the Interior directed the [[Commissioner of Indian Affairs]] to select one or more tracts of land in the [[Uintah Reservation]] suitable for townsites, so they might be reserved as such under the statutes of the United States.<ref>A PROCLAMATION, By the President of the United States of America., July 31, 1905.  Proclamations. 34 Stat., Part 3, 3139.</ref> Three sites were designated, which are the current sites of Duchesne, [[Myton, Utah|Myton]], and [[Randlett, Utah|Randlett]]. A month later President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] approved the selections and declared these lands reserved as townsites. On August 28 the US government opened up the Uintah Basin to settlement of land they had acquired from the Ute Indians under the allotment act of 1891. \"Land lotteries\" were held in [[Vernal, Utah|Vernal]], [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], [[Price, Utah|Price]], [[Grand Junction, Colorado]], and [[Vernal, Utah|Vernal]], where each person was given a ticket with a number. On August 28 numbers 1 through 111 were allowed to make their claim. On August 29 the next 111 people could make their claim and so on. 60 people, 46 adults and 14 children settled on the townsite that is now Duchesne and called it by its first name, \"Elsie\" (Glen). Government surveyors laid out the streets, and the survey was accepted by the government on 18 October 1905. The first cabin was built by Charles Dickerson and Charles Ragland in October 1905. A.M. Murdock with the help of a few men put up a large circus tent to act as a [[trading post]] and post office. The name of the town was changed to \"Dora\" for a short time, after Murdock's 23-year-old daughter, then changed once again to \"Theodore\", in honor of President Theodore Roosevelt. On September 15, 1905, Robert Duchesne Marsh was the first \"white\" child born in the townsite. The first winter was harsh, and the residents were living in tents or other temporary shelter. When spring came the high water of the Duchesne River overflowed its banks, flooding the town. Many of the homesteaders' dreams died after the first winter, and they sold their claims off for next to nothing. Judge M. M. Smith recalls, \"One man asked me to write out a relinquishment for him, remarking, 'I must either give up my claim or my wife. She won't live here.'\" [[Levee|Dikes]] were quickly built up but washed away, and some of the town was under {{convert|2|ft}} of water until June. Tents and houses were moved around to avoid the flooding problem before the next spring.\n\nThe flooding continued annually until 1910<ref>''The Duchesne Record'', July 22, 1910, Pg 1, column 3, \"The Work Starts in Theodore\"</ref> when $5,000 was finally given to make the four river cut-offs needed to fix the problem. In 1906 the first bridge was built by Wasatch County across the Duchesne River in east Theodore.\n\n'''1907&ndash;1914''' The men of Theodore organized the Boosters Club, and the women organized the Standard Bearers in 1907. Both groups became a forceful factor in the early development of the town. With the flooding of the rivers every spring, the Boosters club was finding it hard to attract people and business to the \"muddy\" little town. The Boosters Club raised $500 to build a bridge across the Strawberry River at the mouth of Indian Canyon. The bridge was completed in 1908, and later replaced by the state in 1914. In 1908 A. M. Murdock took down the tent and built the first store, barber shop, and post office, the \"Pioneer Supply\". A town hall was built by the citizens in 1907. After the flooding issue was resolved the town grew quickly. In 1910 the population of \"Theodore\" was 929.<ref>1910 US Census</ref> The town's first newspaper, ''The Duchesne Record'', started publication April 8, 1909. By 1910 the citizens had decided to change the name to \"Duchesne\". The post office kept the name \"Theodore\" until the town's petition to change the name was acknowledged on May 5, 1911. The town was incorporated in 1913, and A. M. Murdock was the first mayor.\n\nOn July 13, 1914, \"Wasatch County was divided and Duchesne County was created.\" Duchesne was made the county seat on Nov 5, 1914, by popular vote of the citizens of the county.<ref>''The Duchesne Record'', Sept 4, 1915, \"Roll Call on the 10th Opening Anniversary\"</ref>\n\nThe name \"Duchesne\" is taken from the name of the river that runs through town and may have been named by fur trappers in the 1820s in honor of Mother [[Rose Philippine Duchesne]], founder of the School of the Sacred Heart near [[St. Louis]], Missouri, although other theories as to the name exist.\n\nA photograph dated 1909, showing the A. M. Murdock Pioneer Supply Store and [[post office]] at Theodore, Utah (which was located approximately where Kohl's Market stood in Duchesne in 1991) appeared in a postal history magazine in 1992.<ref>Robertson, A.

Starvation Reservoir is the base of the state park. Located on the Strawberry River, it was created as part of the [[Central Utah Project]] and is a great fishing and boating lake with stocks of [[rainbow trout]], [[smallmouth bass]], [[walleye]], [[yellow perch]], and [[Utah chub]]. The current [[catch and release]] state record<ref>http://wildlife.utah.gov/fishing/recfish.php</ref> for walleye and Utah chub are held at Starvation. The reservoir has {{convert|3500|acre|km2}} of surface area and is great for boating. There are four boat ramps; the largest is at the marina which also hosts RV parking, boat docs, camp sites, hot showers, and an RV waste dump. Activities at Starvation Reservoir include the annual Starvation Walleye Classic and Desert Bass Busters Club Tourny.\n\nOn the banks of the Strawberry River that runs through town is a boardwalk that not only has beautiful views but also is great to fish from. Other great stream fishing can be had on the Duchesne River and Rock Creek.\n\nThe [[Uinta Mountains|High Uintas wilderness]] area is {{convert|30|mi}} to the north and boasts great camping,hiking, and fishing.\nATV riding is permitted within city limits.

Duchesne has hosted grades 1 through 8 since 1905. The first school building was built in 1907.<ref>Historical marker located at 150 West Main Street, Duchesne, {{convert|4|in|cm|adj=on}} round plaque on back of monument.</ref> In 1921 ninth grade classes were added. Other classes on the 10th grade level were added through the late 1920s. On May 17, 1931, [[Duchesne High School (Utah)|Duchesne High School]] held a graduation ceremony for four students that composed the first senior class. The current structure was built in 2004\u20132005. The facility has two gymnasiums, one college-sized basketball court and one smaller gymnasium left from the 1965 structure. English department with classrooms and separate writing lab. Science department with classrooms and separate lab. [[Utah State University]] provides onsite distance education classes at the school so all students have the opportunity to graduate from high school with an [[associate degree]]. Wood and metal shops. Auditorium, lunch room, and administrative offices.\n\nDuchesne High school colors are blue and white; the mascot is the eagle. Duchesne High School sponsors a men's football team, men's and women's basketball teams, men's wrestling, women's volleyball, as well as a track and field team and cross country team. Duchesne added men's baseball in the 2017\u201318 school year. Duchesne High competes in the 2A division of the UHSAA in all activities but Football which competes in 1A.

The Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha mission is under direction of the Saint Helen Parish in [[Roosevelt, Utah]].\n* The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a seminary located at 181 North 200 West.\n\n==Industry==\nIn 1948 oil was found in the [[Uintah Basin]] but not developed until the early 1970s. Duchesne city is located in the area of vast oil and natural gas reserves spanning the northeast corner of Utah and extending into western [[Colorado]]. As prices for [[petroleum|crude]] rise, oil industry jobs open up in the town but also disappear when crude prices fall. Although reserves are vast, oil production is stifled to almost 50% of capacity by lack of transportation of the paraffin rich crude. Currently crude is only transported to refineries in the Salt Lake city area using trucks. Pipelines can not be used because of the high wax content of the crude. Currently(2019) a study is being conducted on feasibility of a rail line passing through Duchesne to allow transport of the crude to bigger markets.\n\nDuchesne has benefited from the water resources of the Duchesne and Strawberry rivers that flow close to the town. The [[Central Utah Project]] was active in the area for 20 years and provided good jobs from 1967 to 1987. A recent expansion to the water treatment plant northwest of town will start supplying culinary water to the community of [[Roosevelt, Utah|Roosevelt]] some {{convert|30|mi}} away.\n\nDuchesne is home to a number of heavy machine and steel manufacturers. A wide variety of products and parts are manufactured, including underground cranes, shield haulers, rifle barrels, steam locomotive parts, drill collars, turbine parts, gears, sprockets, and splines for the oil fields, steel mills, coal mines, trona mines, power plants, other machine shops, manufacturers and other industries in many capacities. Products are shipped both domestically and to Canada, Mexico, South America, Australia, and Europe.\n\nAgriculture has always been a mainstay for many Duchesne residents and surrounding communities. The vast amount of federally owned and leased lands have given cattle ranchers and sheep ranchers good grazing for over 120 years in the area. Overgrazing in the early 20th century has led to reform in the grazing areas and a steady decline in sheep and cow production throughout the area. Small family farms are the mainstay.\n\nDuchesne has always been rich in its rugged beauty and tourism.

[[Uintah Basin]] of northeastern Utah. The Duchesne River drains the southwest slope of the [[Uinta Mountains]], and the Strawberry river drains the eastern slopes of the [[Wasatch Range]] and is connected to [[Strawberry Reservoir]]. The two rivers combine at Duchesne, and the Duchesne River continues east to join the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] at [[Ouray, Utah]].\n\nNative stands of [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwood trees]] and willows grow along the river banks, while [[sagebrush]] and [[rabbitbrush]] fill the un-irrigated bench tops. [[Alfalfa]] is the main cultivated crop of farmers in the area.\n\nVia highway, [[Salt Lake City]] is {{convert|114|mi}} to the west, [[Vernal, Utah|Vernal]] is {{convert|58|mi}} to the east, and [[Price, Utah|Price]] is {{convert|54|mi}} to the south.\n\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.5|sqkm|order=flip}}, all of it land.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\n==History==\n'''18 September 1776''' The [[Dominguez\u2013Escalante Expedition]] came from the east where they crossed Blue Bench and descended into the valley north of the present-day town of Duchesne. \"We ascended a not very high mesa [Blue Bench] which was level and very stony, traveled about three quarters of a league including ascent and descent, crossed another small river [Duchesne River] which near here enters the San Cosme ([[Strawberry River (Utah)|Strawberry River]]), named it Santa Caterina de Sena, and camped on its banks.\" \"Along these three rivers we have crossed today there is plenty of good land for crops to support three good settlements, with opportunities for irrigation, beautiful cottonwood groves, good pastures, with timber and firewood nearby.\"<ref>Father Escalate journals</ref>\n\n'''1822&ndash;1840''' French Canadian trappers [[\u00c9tienne Provost]], [[Fran\u00e7ois le Clerc]], and [[Antoine Robidoux]] entered the Uintah Basin by way of the Old Spanish Trail and made their fortunes by trapping the many [[North American beaver|beaver]] and trading with the [[Uintah tribe]]. From these French Canadian trappers the Duchesne River and ultimately Duchesne City received its name.\n\n'''1900&ndash;1905''' Leases were arranged with the Ute tribe through the Indian agent \"Major\" H.P. Myton to provide pasture for sheep in and around where Duchesne city is located now. A story passed down from Mrs. William J. Bond about her Father Joseph W. Thomas discusses the area. \"During the winter of 1901 - 02, he (Thomas) hauled supplies from Heber to the now Duchesne area, to the sheep herd camp of John E. Austin, a brother-in-law. Together with three herders, Mr. Thomas tended sheep on the West bench (D-hill) near the (Theodore) cemetery site. They moved the herds to the East desert for the winter months.\nThe Indians had quite a village where Duchesne is now. It was a winter camp and in spring they scattered.\nA fence was stretched across the Indian Canyon as pasture for the horses that grazed there on 8\" and 10\" salt grass.\nSeguesee Jack (Ute tribe leader) refused settlers (sheep herders) permission to trespass the village site. The Indians feared the sheep would eat the good grasses.\" <ref>Mrs. Wm. J. Bond Contributes an Early Story, Duchesne city Library{{unreliable source?|date=December 2016}}</ref>\n\n'''1905&ndash;1906''' On June 7, 1905 the Secretary of the Interior directed the [[Commissioner of Indian Affairs]] to select one or more tracts of land in the [[Uintah Reservation]] suitable for townsites, so they might be reserved as such under the statutes of the United States.<ref>A PROCLAMATION, By the President of the United States of America., July 31, 1905.  Proclamations. 34 Stat., Part 3, 3139.</ref> Three sites were designated, which are the current sites of Duchesne, [[Myton, Utah|Myton]], and [[Randlett, Utah|Randlett]]. A month later President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] approved the selections and declared these lands reserved as townsites. On August 28 the US government opened up the Uintah Basin to settlement of land they had acquired from the Ute Indians under the allotment act of 1891. \"Land lotteries\" were held in [[Vernal, Utah|Vernal]], [[Provo, Utah|Provo]], [[Price, Utah|Price]], [[Grand Junction, Colorado]], and [[Vernal, Utah|Vernal]], where each person was given a ticket with a number. On August 28 numbers 1 through 111 were allowed to make their claim. On August 29 the next 111 people could make their claim and so on. 60 people, 46 adults and 14 children settled on the townsite that is now Duchesne and called it by its first name, \"Elsie\" (Glen). Government surveyors laid out the streets, and the survey was accepted by the government on 18 October 1905. The first cabin was built by Charles Dickerson and Charles Ragland in October 1905. A.M. Murdock with the help of a few men put up a large circus tent to act as a [[trading post]] and post office. The name of the town was changed to \"Dora\" for a short time, after Murdock's 23-year-old daughter, then changed once again to \"Theodore\", in honor of President Theodore Roosevelt. On September 15, 1905, Robert Duchesne Marsh was the first \"white\" child born in the townsite. The first winter was harsh, and the residents were living in tents or other temporary shelter. When spring came the high water of the Duchesne River overflowed its banks, flooding the town. Many of the homesteaders' dreams died after the first winter, and they sold their claims off for next to nothing. Judge M. M. Smith recalls, \"One man asked me to write out a relinquishment for him, remarking, 'I must either give up my claim or my wife. She won't live here.'\" [[Levee|Dikes]] were quickly built up but washed away, and some of the town was under {{convert|2|ft}} of water until June. Tents and houses were moved around to avoid the flooding problem before the next spring.\n\nThe flooding continued annually until 1910<ref>''The Duchesne Record'', July 22, 1910, Pg 1, column 3, \"The Work Starts in Theodore\"</ref> when $5,000 was finally given to make the four river cut-offs needed to fix the problem. In 1906 the first bridge was built by Wasatch County across the Duchesne River in east Theodore.\n\n'''1907&ndash;1914''' The men of Theodore organized the Boosters Club, and the women organized the Standard Bearers in 1907. Both groups became a forceful factor in the early development of the town. With the flooding of the rivers every spring, the Boosters club was finding it hard to attract people and business to the \"muddy\" little town. The Boosters Club raised $500 to build a bridge across the Strawberry River at the mouth of Indian Canyon. The bridge was completed in 1908, and later replaced by the state in 1914. In 1908 A. M. Murdock took down the tent and built the first store, barber shop, and post office, the \"Pioneer Supply\". A town hall was built by the citizens in 1907. After the flooding issue was resolved the town grew quickly. In 1910 the population of \"Theodore\" was 929.<ref>1910 US Census</ref> The town's first newspaper, ''The Duchesne Record'', started publication April 8, 1909. By 1910 the citizens had decided to change the name to \"Duchesne\". The post office kept the name \"Theodore\" until the town's petition to change the name was acknowledged on May 5, 1911. The town was incorporated in 1913, and A. M. Murdock was the first mayor.\n\nOn July 13, 1914, \"Wasatch County was divided and Duchesne County was created.\" Duchesne was made the county seat on Nov 5, 1914, by popular vote of the citizens of the county.<ref>''The Duchesne Record'', Sept 4, 1915, \"Roll Call on the 10th Opening Anniversary\"</ref>\n\nThe name \"Duchesne\" is taken from the name of the river that runs through town and may have been named by fur trappers in the 1820s in honor of Mother [[Rose Philippine Duchesne]], founder of the School of the Sacred Heart near [[St. Louis]], Missouri, although other theories as to the name exist.\n\nA photograph dated 1909, showing the A.

Starvation Reservoir is the base of the state park. Located on the Strawberry River, it was created as part of the [[Central Utah Project]] and is a great fishing and boating lake with stocks of [[rainbow trout]], [[smallmouth bass]], [[walleye]], [[yellow perch]], and [[Utah chub]]. The current [[catch and release]] state record<ref>http://wildlife.utah.gov/fishing/recfish.php</ref> for walleye and Utah chub are held at Starvation. The reservoir has {{convert|3500|acre|km2}} of surface area and is great for boating. There are four boat ramps; the largest is at the marina which also hosts RV parking, boat docs, camp sites, hot showers, and an RV waste dump. Activities at Starvation Reservoir include the annual Starvation Walleye Classic and Desert Bass Busters Club Tourny.\n\nOn the banks of the Strawberry River that runs through town is a boardwalk that not only has beautiful views but also is great to fish from.

The Blessed Kateri Tekakwitha mission is under direction of the Saint Helen Parish in [[Roosevelt, Utah]].\n* The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints has a seminary located at 181 North 200 West.\n\n==Industry==\nIn 1948 oil was found in the [[Uintah Basin]] but not developed until the early 1970s. Duchesne city is located in the area of vast oil and natural gas reserves spanning the northeast corner of Utah and extending into western [[Colorado]]. As prices for [[petroleum|crude]] rise, oil industry jobs open up in the town but also disappear when crude prices fall. Although reserves are vast, oil production is stifled to almost 50% of capacity by lack of transportation of the paraffin rich crude. Currently crude is only transported to refineries in the Salt Lake city area using trucks. Pipelines can not be used because of the high wax content of the crude. Currently(2019) a study is being conducted on feasibility of a rail line passing through Duchesne to allow transport of the crude to bigger markets.\n\nDuchesne has benefited from the water resources of the Duchesne and Strawberry rivers that flow close to the town. The [[Central Utah Project]] was active in the area for 20 years and provided good jobs from 1967 to 1987. A recent expansion to the water treatment plant northwest of town will start supplying culinary water to the community of [[Roosevelt, Utah|Roosevelt]] some {{convert|30|mi}} away.\n\nDuchesne is home to a number of heavy machine and steel manufacturers. A wide variety of products and parts are manufactured, including underground cranes, shield haulers, rifle barrels, steam locomotive parts, drill collars, turbine parts, gears, sprockets, and splines for the oil fields, steel mills, coal mines, trona mines, power plants, other machine shops, manufacturers and other industries in many capacities. Products are shipped both domestically and to Canada, Mexico, South America, Australia, and Europe.\n\nAgriculture has always been a mainstay for many Duchesne residents and surrounding communities. The vast amount of federally owned and leased lands have given cattle ranchers and sheep ranchers good grazing for over 120 years in the area. Overgrazing in the early 20th century has led to reform in the grazing areas and a steady decline in sheep and cow production throughout the area. Small family farms are the mainstay.\n\nDuchesne has always been rich in its rugged beauty and tourism. Thousands are drawn during and warmer months to enjoy boating on [[Starvation Reservoir]], fishing on the Strawberry and Duchesne rivers, and camping in the [[Uinta Mountains|High Uintas]].\n\n{{US Census population\n|1910= 929\n|1920= 700\n|1930= 590\n|1940= 907\n|1950= 804\n|1960= 770\n|1970= 1094\n|1980= 1677\n|1990= 1308\n|2000= 1408\n|2010= 1690\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=1770\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018CenPopScriptOnlyDirtyFixDoNotUse\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of the census<ref name=\"GR2\" /> of 2010, there were 1,690 people, 797 households, and 601 families residing in the city.

The term marketspace was introduced by [[Jeffrey Rayport]] and [[John Sviokla]]<ref>{{cite web|title=John J.

In a marketspace, information and/or physical goods are exchanged, and transactions take place through computers and networks. These networks consist of [[blogs]], [[Internet forum|forum]] threads, and [[micro-blogging]] services like Twitter; although  their article predates Twitter. Businesses and their customers are enabled to create conversations and two-way communications about products and services. These conversations may also happen outside the sphere of control of a given business, when a marketing campaign or customer-service issue captures the attention of web-savvy consumers.\n\n'''Marketspace vs Marketplace''' A Marketspace is an online space that facilitates bi-directional commerce. Here not only sellers can list their goods, but buyers can list their needs. The role of the Marketspace is to match buyers and sellers whose contexts have sufficient similarity - if the product being offered and being requested has a high degree of match and the buyer and seller can come to agreement on price, location and timing, then a successful match can be made that will culminate in a transaction.\n\nOnline Marketplaces like [[Etsy]] or [[eBay]] allow vendors to display and sell products taking advantage of the traffic to the site. The marketplace owner typically takes a commission on the sale.\n\nIn 1999, the book ''The Cluetrain Manifesto'' ([[The Cluetrain Manifesto]]) discussed the notions surrounding how the traditional marketplace (or bazaar) was adapting itself to the age of the web{{mdash}}where \"markets were conversations\". By 2010, we see the emergence of numerous online marketplaces: Amazon, eBay, Facebook, and a number of other large online retailers{{mdash}}yet these were still largely inventories of supply that consumers would browse and purchase from.

In August 1942 he was appointed as successor to [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Claude Auchinleck]] as commander of the Eighth Army.

skirmishing along [[Frontier Wire (Libya)|the frontier]] from June 1940;  conducting a planned withdrawal in September during the [[Italian invasion of Egypt]], and during [[Operation Compass]] in December which saw the conquest of [[Cyrenaica]] and the destruction of the [[Tenth Army (Italy)|Italian Tenth Army]] the following February. \n\nFollowing the arrival of the German [[Afrika Korps]], under the command of [[Erwin Rommel]], the [[Operation Sonnenblume|Axis counter-attack in April]], 7th Support Group, which had been refitting in [[Nile Delta|the Delta]], was called upon to stabilize the front and to reform the retreating forces, which was achieved at the Libyan-Egyptian border. \nIn May Gott was placed in command of a mixed force to plan and conduct the ambitious ''[[Operation Brevity]]'', which succeeded in re-taking the [[Halfaya Pass]], but failed in its wider objectives. \nA subsequent larger scale operation, ''[[Operation Battleaxe]]'', in which the Support Group also took part was also a failure and led to a reorganisation of the commands in the Western Desert which included Gott's promotion to command the 7th Armoured Division.<ref>Mead, p. 177.</ref>\n\nDuring the next major Commonwealth offensive, ''[[Operation Crusader]]'', in November 1941, 7th Armoured Division was severely mauled by the [[Afrika Korps]] at the [[battle of Sidi Rezegh]], but kept the field and contributed to the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]]'s ultimate success.<ref>Mead, p.178.</ref>\n\nGott's permanent rank had been made up to full [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] in October 1941<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=35360| date=28 November 1941|page=6826| supp=y}}</ref> and he was promoted to acting [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-general]] and given command of [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] in early 1942.<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=35462| date=17 February 1942|page=833| supp=y}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Gazala]], 8th Army's performance was fatally handicapped by a breakdown in relations at all levels; within XIII Corps during this period Gott's relationship with his subordinate [[Dan Pienaar]], the commander of [[1st South African Division]], was toxic even by the abysmal standards of the time. \nOf XIII Corps performance in the action, [[Battle of Gazala#The Cauldron|the stand by 150th Brigade]], and [[Battle of Gazala#Eighth Army retreat|the breakout by 50th Division]] are notable, while the low point was the [[Battle of Gazala#Fall of Tobruk|loss of Tobruk]] with its entire garrison during the withdrawal to Egypt.\nXIII Corps was able to withdraw in good order to the Alamein position and was instrumental in fighting the Axis to a standstill there in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]].\n\n===Death===\n[[File:General Gott's Grave.jpg|thumb|Gott's grave at the El Alamein cemetery.

Gott's aggressive, somewhat impetuous, personality appealed to Churchill, and he was strongly recommended by [[Anthony Eden]], who had served with Gott during World War I. Gott was therefore chosen to take over Eighth Army. This was despite the reservations of Auchinleck and General [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Sir Alan Brooke]],<ref>Alanbrooke, p. 294.</ref> the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS). Brooke knew Gott very well and had a high opinion of his abilities.<ref>Alanbrooke, p. 290.</ref> However, a number of factors, including a personal interview with Gott on 5 August (during which Brooke realized that Gott had \"...tried most of his ideas on the Boche...\") led Brooke to conclude that \"We want someone with new ideas and plenty of confidence in them...\" and that Gott was tired and had temporarily lost his drive, having been in the desert since the start of the war.<ref>Alanbrooke, pp. 290 & 292.</ref> He also felt that Gott needed more experience before taking an army command.<ref>Alanbrooke, p. 292.</ref>\n\nBefore he could take up his post, Gott was killed when the transport plane he was traveling in was shot down and destroyed while returning to [[Cairo]] from the battle area.<ref>Colin Smith, ''War Without Hate'' [http://www.colin-smith.info/pages/books/alamein.htm synopsis]</ref><ref>{{cite book| first=John| last=Weal| title=Jagdgeschwader 27 'Afrika'| url=http://www.clubhyper.com/reference/jg27bookextractjw_1.htm| publisher=Osprey Publishing| series=Aviation Elite Units Series| year=2003| isbn=978-1-84176-538-9}} Follow the link and search the extract for \"Gott\"</ref> The aircraft, a [[Bristol Bombay]] of [[No. 216 Squadron RAF]] flown by 19-year-old [[Flight Sergeant]] [[Hugh James (RAF officer)|Hugh \"Jimmy\" James]], was intercepted and shot down by [[Unteroffizier]] Bernd Schneider and [[Emil Clade]] of [[Jagdgeschwader 27]] (Fighter Wing 27). With both engines out, the pilot had made a successful crash landing, but two German [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]] fighters attacked the crashed plane, strafing it until the Bombay was totally wrecked. Those who were unable to escape from the downed Bombay (including Gott) were killed. Gott's body was buried at the El Alamein War Cemetery.

[[Officer (armed forces)|officer]] who fought during both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], reaching the rank of lieutenant-general while serving with the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]]. In August 1942 he was appointed as successor to [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Claude Auchinleck]] as commander of the Eighth Army. On the way to take up his command he was killed when his plane was shot down. His death led to the appointment of Lieutenant-General [[Bernard Montgomery]] in his place.\n\n==Military career==\nEducated at [[Harrow School]], he was [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] as a [[second lieutenant]] into the [[King's Royal Rifle Corps]] (KRRC) in 1915, and served with distinction with the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) in France during [[World War I]]. His nickname \"Strafer\" was a pun on the German war slogan ''[[Gott strafe England]]'' (God punish England). He was promoted to the rank of [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] in January 1921,<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=32293| date=15 April 1921|page=3065| supp=y}}</ref> and attended [[Staff College, Camberley]] from January 1931.<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=33572| date=21 January 1930|page=428}}</ref> He was promoted [[Major (United Kingdom)|major]] in July 1934,<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=34071| date=20 July 1934|page=4666}}</ref> having been made a brevet major earlier in January.<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=34011| date=2 January 1934|page=55}}</ref> His service during the [[interwar period]] included a posting as adjutant to a territorial battalion,<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=33092| date=13 October 1925|page=6615}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette| issue=33091| date=9 October 1925|page=6507}}</ref> and a period of postings in [[British Raj|India]] as a [[Staff (military)|general staff officer]] (GSO2)<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=34273| date=10 April 1936|page=2386}}</ref> and Deputy Assistant Quartermaster General.<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=34273| date=10 April 1936|page=2387}}</ref>\n\n===North African campaigns===\n[[File:GenRitchie.jpg|thumb|left|Gott, pictured here second from right, at a briefing led by [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Neil Ritchie]] (smoking pipe).]]\n\nHaving been promoted [[Lieutenant colonel (United Kingdom)|lieutenant colonel]] in October 1938<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=34566| date=1 November 1938|page=6816}}</ref> to command the 1st Battalion, KRRC on its transfer from [[Burma]] to [[Egypt]] to become part of the Mobile Division (later to become [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]], the \"Desert Rats\"),<ref>Mead, p. 176.</ref> Gott held a succession of posts in the division; he was successively chief staff officer of the division (General Staff Officer, Grade I, ranked lieutenant colonel) commander of the [[7th Support Group (United Kingdom)|Support Group]] as [[Acting (rank)|acting]] [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|brigadier]], and [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding]] acting [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|major-general]]<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=35298| date=3 October 1941|page=5775| supp=y}}</ref> of the 7th Armoured Division. \n\nWhile under Gott's command the Support Group performed well from the beginning of the campaign; skirmishing along [[Frontier Wire (Libya)|the frontier]] from June 1940;  conducting a planned withdrawal in September during the [[Italian invasion of Egypt]], and during [[Operation Compass]] in December which saw the conquest of [[Cyrenaica]] and the destruction of the [[Tenth Army (Italy)|Italian Tenth Army]] the following February. \n\nFollowing the arrival of the German [[Afrika Korps]], under the command of [[Erwin Rommel]], the [[Operation Sonnenblume|Axis counter-attack in April]], 7th Support Group, which had been refitting in [[Nile Delta|the Delta]], was called upon to stabilize the front and to reform the retreating forces, which was achieved at the Libyan-Egyptian border. \nIn May Gott was placed in command of a mixed force to plan and conduct the ambitious ''[[Operation Brevity]]'', which succeeded in re-taking the [[Halfaya Pass]], but failed in its wider objectives. \nA subsequent larger scale operation, ''[[Operation Battleaxe]]'', in which the Support Group also took part was also a failure and led to a reorganisation of the commands in the Western Desert which included Gott's promotion to command the 7th Armoured Division.<ref>Mead, p. 177.</ref>\n\nDuring the next major Commonwealth offensive, ''[[Operation Crusader]]'', in November 1941, 7th Armoured Division was severely mauled by the [[Afrika Korps]] at the [[battle of Sidi Rezegh]], but kept the field and contributed to the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]]'s ultimate success.<ref>Mead, p.178.</ref>\n\nGott's permanent rank had been made up to full [[Colonel (United Kingdom)|colonel]] in October 1941<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=35360| date=28 November 1941|page=6826| supp=y}}</ref> and he was promoted to acting [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|lieutenant-general]] and given command of [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|XIII Corps]] in early 1942.<ref>{{London Gazette| issue=35462| date=17 February 1942|page=833| supp=y}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Gazala]], 8th Army's performance was fatally handicapped by a breakdown in relations at all levels; within XIII Corps during this period Gott's relationship with his subordinate [[Dan Pienaar]], the commander of [[1st South African Division]], was toxic even by the abysmal standards of the time. \nOf XIII Corps performance in the action, [[Battle of Gazala#The Cauldron|the stand by 150th Brigade]], and [[Battle of Gazala#Eighth Army retreat|the breakout by 50th Division]] are notable, while the low point was the [[Battle of Gazala#Fall of Tobruk|loss of Tobruk]] with its entire garrison during the withdrawal to Egypt.\nXIII Corps was able to withdraw in good order to the Alamein position and was instrumental in fighting the Axis to a standstill there in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]].\n\n===Death===\n[[File:General Gott's Grave.jpg|thumb|Gott's grave at the El Alamein cemetery. The wreath was laid by Squadron Leader Jimmy James and his son.]]\n\nIn August 1942, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Winston Churchill]] removed [[General (United Kingdom)|General]] Sir [[Claude Auchinleck]] as Commander-in-Chief Middle East and acting General Officer Commanding Eighth Army. Gott's aggressive, somewhat impetuous, personality appealed to Churchill, and he was strongly recommended by [[Anthony Eden]], who had served with Gott during World War I. Gott was therefore chosen to take over Eighth Army. This was despite the reservations of Auchinleck and General [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Sir Alan Brooke]],<ref>Alanbrooke, p. 294.</ref> the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]] (CIGS). Brooke knew Gott very well and had a high opinion of his abilities.<ref>Alanbrooke, p. 290.</ref> However, a number of factors, including a personal interview with Gott on 5 August (during which Brooke realized that Gott had \"...tried most of his ideas on the Boche...\") led Brooke to conclude that \"We want someone with new ideas and plenty of confidence in them...\" and that Gott was tired and had temporarily lost his drive, having been in the desert since the start of the war.<ref>Alanbrooke, pp. 290 & 292.</ref> He also felt that Gott needed more experience before taking an army command.<ref>Alanbrooke, p. 292.</ref>\n\nBefore he could take up his post, Gott was killed when the transport plane he was traveling in was shot down and destroyed while returning to [[Cairo]] from the battle area.<ref>Colin Smith, ''War Without Hate'' [http://www.colin-smith.info/pages/books/alamein.htm synopsis]</ref><ref>{{cite book| first=John| last=Weal| title=Jagdgeschwader 27 'Afrika'| url=http://www.clubhyper.com/reference/jg27bookextractjw_1.htm| publisher=Osprey Publishing| series=Aviation Elite Units Series| year=2003| isbn=978-1-84176-538-9}} Follow the link and search the extract for \"Gott\"</ref> The aircraft, a [[Bristol Bombay]] of [[No. 216 Squadron RAF]] flown by 19-year-old [[Flight Sergeant]] [[Hugh James (RAF officer)|Hugh \"Jimmy\" James]], was intercepted and shot down by [[Unteroffizier]] Bernd Schneider and [[Emil Clade]] of [[Jagdgeschwader 27]] (Fighter Wing 27).

Yemen has an area of {{convert|527970|km2|sqmi}}, including the islands of [[Perim]] at the southern end of the Red Sea and [[Socotra]] at the entrance to the Gulf of Aden. Yemen's land boundaries total {{convert|1746|km|mi}}.

The [[Tihamah]] is a nearly {{convert|419|km|mi|adj=on}} long, semidesert coastal plain that runs along the [[Red Sea]] and is part of the [[Arabian Peninsula coastal fog desert]] [[ecoregion]].\n\nThe highland regions are interspersed with [[wadi]]s, or river valleys, that are dry in the winter months (Yemen has no permanent rivers.) Most notable is the [[Wadi Hadhramaut]] in eastern Yemen, the upper portions of which contain alluvial soil and floodwaters and the lower portion of which is barren and largely uninhabited. Both the eastern plateau region and the desert in the north are hot and dry with little vegetation.<ref name=cp/>\n\nIn the northeastern [[Empty Quarter]], sands highlight the region, being the largest expanse of sand in the world. It receives little to no rain for extensive periods of time. Little vegetation grows here either.\n\nThe central highlands are drier than the western highlands because of rain-shadow influences, but still receives sufficient rain in wet years for extensive cropping. Its [[diurnal temperature variation]]s are among the highest in the world: ranges from {{convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on|lk=on}} in the day to {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} at night are normal. Water storage allows for irrigation and the growing of wheat and barley while the western highlands are famous for [[sorghum]], [[coffee]], and some tropical fruits like bananas and mangos.\n\n==Elevation==\nYemen is a continuously elevated country, with only the coastal plains being the lowest-lying areas. Jagged peaks and plateaus cover most of Yemen, and the average elevation in the country is about {{convert|2,000|m|ft}}. The interior mountains have elevations ranging from a few hundred meters to the highest point in the country and the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Jabal An-Nabi Shu'ayb]], which is {{convert|3,666|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, within the [[Jabal Haraz|Haraz]]i subrange of the [[Sarawat Mountains|Sarawat]].<ref name=\"Burrows2010\">{{cite book |author=Robert D.

The Yemenis used the elevation of their homeland to stay isolated for thousands of years with foreign trade conducted only when the Yemenis wished to go to the coastal areas. The mountains are young, jagged peaks that are known to rise from an elevation of a few hundred meters to well over {{convert|3,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The mountains can be separated into a western and central highland. The western highlands have peaks reaching around {{convert|3,000|m|mile|abbr=off}}, with relatively fertile soil and sufficient and plentiful rainfall. The central highlands is more like a plateau of about {{convert|2,000|\u2013|3,200|m|mile|abbr=off}}, with rolling hills, small knolls, and some very prominent peaks, but is still relatively more elevated. Less rainfall can be seen in this region, but the summer months give enough to sustain crops.\n\n==Climate==\nTemperatures are generally very high in Yemen, particularly in the coastal regions. Rainfall is limited, with variations based on elevation. The highlands enjoy a temperate, rainy summer with an average high temperature of {{convert|21|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1|abbr=on}} and a cool, moderately dry winter with temperatures occasionally dipping below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1|abbr=on}}. The climate of the [[Tihamah]] (western coastal plain) is tropical; temperatures occasionally exceed {{convert|54|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}, and the humidity ranges from 50 to 70 percent. Rainfall, which comes in irregular heavy torrents, averages {{convert|130|mm|in|2}} annually. In Aden the average temperature is {{convert|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} in January and {{convert|32|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} in June, but with highs often exceeding {{convert|37|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}. Average annual rainfall is {{convert|127|mm|in|0}}. The highest mountainous areas of southern Yemen receive from {{convert|520|to|760|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rain a year. Some areas of the western highlands, most notably Ibb and Ta'izz, receive from about {{convert|1000|\u2013|1500|mm|in|1}} of rain each year. The capital, Sana'a, receives around {{convert|300|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} a year, it is not uncommon for the northern and eastern sections of the country to receive no rain for five years or more. The Wadi Hadhramaut in the eastern part of Yemen is arid and hot, and the humidity ranges from 35 percent in June to 64 percent in January. Yemen is dry in the east and humid in the west.\n\n==Coastline and maritime claims==\nYemen has {{convert|1906|km|mi}} of coastline along the [[Arabian Sea]], the [[Gulf of Aden]], and the Red Sea.

The [[Tihamah]] is a nearly {{convert|419|km|mi|adj=on}} long, semidesert coastal plain that runs along the [[Red Sea]] and is part of the [[Arabian Peninsula coastal fog desert]] [[ecoregion]].\n\nThe highland regions are interspersed with [[wadi]]s, or river valleys, that are dry in the winter months (Yemen has no permanent rivers.) Most notable is the [[Wadi Hadhramaut]] in eastern Yemen, the upper portions of which contain alluvial soil and floodwaters and the lower portion of which is barren and largely uninhabited. Both the eastern plateau region and the desert in the north are hot and dry with little vegetation.<ref name=cp/>\n\nIn the northeastern [[Empty Quarter]], sands highlight the region, being the largest expanse of sand in the world. It receives little to no rain for extensive periods of time. Little vegetation grows here either.\n\nThe central highlands are drier than the western highlands because of rain-shadow influences, but still receives sufficient rain in wet years for extensive cropping. Its [[diurnal temperature variation]]s are among the highest in the world: ranges from {{convert|30|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on|lk=on}} in the day to {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} at night are normal. Water storage allows for irrigation and the growing of wheat and barley while the western highlands are famous for [[sorghum]], [[coffee]], and some tropical fruits like bananas and mangos.\n\n==Elevation==\nYemen is a continuously elevated country, with only the coastal plains being the lowest-lying areas. Jagged peaks and plateaus cover most of Yemen, and the average elevation in the country is about {{convert|2,000|m|ft}}. The interior mountains have elevations ranging from a few hundred meters to the highest point in the country and the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Jabal An-Nabi Shu'ayb]], which is {{convert|3,666|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level, within the [[Jabal Haraz|Haraz]]i subrange of the [[Sarawat Mountains|Sarawat]].<ref name=\"Burrows2010\">{{cite book |author=Robert D.

The Yemenis used the elevation of their homeland to stay isolated for thousands of years with foreign trade conducted only when the Yemenis wished to go to the coastal areas. The mountains are young, jagged peaks that are known to rise from an elevation of a few hundred meters to well over {{convert|3,000|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The mountains can be separated into a western and central highland. The western highlands have peaks reaching around {{convert|3,000|m|mile|abbr=off}}, with relatively fertile soil and sufficient and plentiful rainfall. The central highlands is more like a plateau of about {{convert|2,000|\u2013|3,200|m|mile|abbr=off}}, with rolling hills, small knolls, and some very prominent peaks, but is still relatively more elevated. Less rainfall can be seen in this region, but the summer months give enough to sustain crops.\n\n==Climate==\nTemperatures are generally very high in Yemen, particularly in the coastal regions. Rainfall is limited, with variations based on elevation. The highlands enjoy a temperate, rainy summer with an average high temperature of {{convert|21|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1|abbr=on}} and a cool, moderately dry winter with temperatures occasionally dipping below {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1|abbr=on}}. The climate of the [[Tihamah]] (western coastal plain) is tropical; temperatures occasionally exceed {{convert|54|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}, and the humidity ranges from 50 to 70 percent. Rainfall, which comes in irregular heavy torrents, averages {{convert|130|mm|in|2}} annually. In Aden the average temperature is {{convert|25|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} in January and {{convert|32|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}} in June, but with highs often exceeding {{convert|37|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|1}}. Average annual rainfall is {{convert|127|mm|in|0}}. The highest mountainous areas of southern Yemen receive from {{convert|520|to|760|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of rain a year. Some areas of the western highlands, most notably Ibb and Ta'izz, receive from about {{convert|1000|\u2013|1500|mm|in|1}} of rain each year. The capital, Sana'a, receives around {{convert|300|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} a year, it is not uncommon for the northern and eastern sections of the country to receive no rain for five years or more. The Wadi Hadhramaut in the eastern part of Yemen is arid and hot, and the humidity ranges from 35 percent in June to 64 percent in January.

Located at the corner of Duval and Greene street since 1937 (201 Duval Street, Key West, FL  33040).\n\n==HISTORY OF SLOPPY JOE\u2019S BAR, KEY WEST, FL==\n\nThe official beginning of what would become Sloppy Joe's Bar, the famous and infamous Key West saloon, was December 5, 1933--the day Prohibition was repealed. The bar was destined to go through two name changes and a sudden change of location before it would become Sloppy Joe's seen by millions of visitors to Florida's southernmost outpost.\n\n\nIn Key West, being a bastion of free thinkers even in the thirties, Prohibition was looked on as an amusing exercise dreamed up by the government, and Joe Russell was just one of the enterprising individuals who operated an illegal Speak Easy on Front Street. Even Ernest Hemingway, who made Key West his home at the time, slipped over to Russell's on occasion to buy illicit bottles of Scotch and the two struck up an enduring friendship.\n\nWhen the government's Great Experiment ended a dismal failure, Joe Russell moved his business to Greene Street and became a legitimate saloon-keeper-proprietor of the Blind Pig, a droll rundown building that Russell leased for three dollars a week.\n\nThe rowdy, come-as-you-are saloon, was renamed the Silver Slipper upon the addition of a dance floor; but that did not matter, it remained a place of shabby discomfort, good friends and gambling, fifteen-cent whiskey, and ten-cent shots of gin.\n\nIt was Hemingway, a favorite patron of Russell's bar from the start, who encouraged its name change to Sloppy Joe's. The new name was adopted from Jose Garcia Rios Havana Club selling liquor and iced seafood. Because the floor was always wet with melted ice, his patrons taunted Jose (Joe) with running a sloppy place... Sloppy Joe\u2019s \u2026and the name stuck.\n\nIn its early days in Key West, Sloppy Joe's boasted several trademark \"fixtures\" besides Hemingway. There was \"Big\" Skinner, the hearty Bartender who tipped the scales at 300 pounds and served Sloppy Joe's customers for more than two decades.  Big Skinner was captured by Erik Smith a WPA-era artist, along with Russell and Hemingway, in a famous mural that hangs in Sloppy Joe\u2019s today titled \u201cHemingway and Friends.\u201d\n\nCorner of Greene and Duval Street since 1937\nSloppy Joe's migrated across the street to its present location on May 5, 1937. The move was occasioned by a rent increase that Joe Russell refused to pay: from three dollars a week to a whopping four dollars. Luckily, the former Victoria Restaurant owned by Spanish emigrant Juan Farto was vacant. Located at the corner of Duval and Greene Streets, the building had been built in 1917 and incorporated beautiful Cuban tile work, busily whirring ceiling fans, and jalousie doors. Joe Russell paid $2,500 for it.\n\nIn true Key West fashion, the bar never actually closed during the transition--customers simply picked up their drinks and carried them, along with every piece of furniture in the place, down the block to 201 Duval Street. Service resumed with barely a blink. The new Sloppy Joe's boasted the longest bar in town.  Behind the bar, in the back room, were gambling and the requisite pool tables. Skinner had pride of place above his new long curved bar. The bat that Skinner used to control his patrons now hangs on the wall.\n\nNicknames \u201cSloppy Joe\u201d Russell and \u201cJosie Grunts\u201d\nJoe Russell was a Conch.  Born and raised in Key West.  Conch is the name given to Key West natives; a name that derived from that of the tough, tasty mollusk found in the surrounding waters.  Russell was a charter boat captain, rum runner, Hemingway's boat pilot, and the author's fishing companion for twelve years. In his company, Papa once caught an astonishing fifty-four Marlin in 115 days. Hemingway called him \"Josie Grunts\" and used him as the model for Freddy, the owner of Freddy's Bar and captain of the Queen Conch in To Have and Have Not. \n\nWhen Joe officially opened the bar, Hemingway and his \"Mob\" of cohorts were enthusiastic regular customers. In fact, the author once called himself a co-owner or silent partner in the enterprise. The \"Mob\" was comprised of some of the literary lights of the day as well as a variety of famous and infamous local residents: John Dos Pasos, Waldo Pierce, J.B. Sullivan, Hamilton Adams, Captain Eddie Saunders, Henry Strater. They wrangled, drank, and philosophized the days away, never knowing they were building a legend.\n\nWhen Hemingway left Key West in 1939, he left a number of personal effects stored in a house next to Sloppy Joe's. After the house was sold, the effects were moved into the back room behind the bar at Sloppy Joe's. They remained there until 1962, a year after Hemingway's death, when his widow (fourth wife Mary Welsh Hemingway) opened the room and took possession of them, finding uncashed royalty checks, unfinished manuscripts, sections of original manuscript of \u201cTo Have and Have Not,\u201d letters, and personal items. Some of the memorabilia was given to the then-owner of the bar, Stan Smith, to be displayed.  One of the items was the snow skis that hang in the bar today.\n\nJoe Russell died June 20,1941 of a heart attack, he was 53 years old.  At the time Russell and Ernest Hemingway had been fishing in Cuba for three weeks, Hemingway telephoned Joe Russell Jr. to tell him of his father\u2019s death.  He is buried in the Key West Cemetery.\n\nSloppy Joe's Today\n\nSloppy Joe\u2019s was purchased September 8, 1978 by Sid Snelgrove and Jim Mayer and has been owned by the two families since that time.\n\nOver the years Sloppy Joe's, like rare Cuban rum, has gained a richness and flavor while essentially remaining unchanged. The ceiling fans still whisper busily, a little bit wobbly but carrying on. The jalousie doors open on a Duval Street busier than even Hemingway could imagine, yet still bearing the off-beat ambience that prompted him to brand Key West \"the St. Tropez of the Poor.\" The long curving bar wears the scars of generations of visitors and Hemingway aficionados, drawn by the legend and hoping some measure of magic will rub off on them - and it does.\n\nOpen 365 days a year, each day begins at 9:00 am (noon on Sundays).  Sloppy Joe\u2019s has four complimentary divisions: bar, food, entertainment, and the Retail Store. The bar offers generous drinks, live music on stage every day Noon to 2:00am, and dancing. The quality of the entertainment, showcased on the huge stage facing Duval Street, is exceptional.  The performers offer a wide range of music styles and comical entertainment.\n\nJust as in Joe Russell's day, hospitable Bartenders welcome patrons at virtually all hours of the day or night. The generous drinks and casual, undemanding atmosphere so successful in Russell's reign remain, as does the sense that something unusual is always about to happen at Sloppy Joe's.\n \t  \nThe main Bar structure was built in 1917; and the second building, which houses the Kitchen and Joe\u2019s Tap Room, was built in 1892.\n\nJoe\u2019s Tap Room is attached to Sloppy Joe\u2019s. Open daily at Noon, Joe\u2019s Tap Room has the same food menu as Sloppy Joe\u2019s and offers variety of crafted beers on tap.  The neighborhood has found Joe\u2019s Tap Room as a great place to meet friends and watch sports.\n\nSloppy Joe\u2019s Owners\nJoe \u201cSloppy Joe\u201d Russell Original owner, nickname Josie Grunts.

Even Ernest Hemingway, who made Key West his home at the time, slipped over to Russell's on occasion to buy illicit bottles of Scotch and the two struck up an enduring friendship.\n\nWhen the government's Great Experiment ended a dismal failure, Joe Russell moved his business to Greene Street and became a legitimate saloon-keeper-proprietor of the Blind Pig, a droll rundown building that Russell leased for three dollars a week.\n\nThe rowdy, come-as-you-are saloon, was renamed the Silver Slipper upon the addition of a dance floor; but that did not matter, it remained a place of shabby discomfort, good friends and gambling, fifteen-cent whiskey, and ten-cent shots of gin.\n\nIt was Hemingway, a favorite patron of Russell's bar from the start, who encouraged its name change to Sloppy Joe's. The new name was adopted from Jose Garcia Rios Havana Club selling liquor and iced seafood. Because the floor was always wet with melted ice, his patrons taunted Jose (Joe) with running a sloppy place... Sloppy Joe\u2019s \u2026and the name stuck.\n\nIn its early days in Key West, Sloppy Joe's boasted several trademark \"fixtures\" besides Hemingway. There was \"Big\" Skinner, the hearty Bartender who tipped the scales at 300 pounds and served Sloppy Joe's customers for more than two decades.  Big Skinner was captured by Erik Smith a WPA-era artist, along with Russell and Hemingway, in a famous mural that hangs in Sloppy Joe\u2019s today titled \u201cHemingway and Friends.\u201d\n\nCorner of Greene and Duval Street since 1937\nSloppy Joe's migrated across the street to its present location on May 5, 1937. The move was occasioned by a rent increase that Joe Russell refused to pay: from three dollars a week to a whopping four dollars. Luckily, the former Victoria Restaurant owned by Spanish emigrant Juan Farto was vacant. Located at the corner of Duval and Greene Streets, the building had been built in 1917 and incorporated beautiful Cuban tile work, busily whirring ceiling fans, and jalousie doors. Joe Russell paid $2,500 for it.\n\nIn true Key West fashion, the bar never actually closed during the transition--customers simply picked up their drinks and carried them, along with every piece of furniture in the place, down the block to 201 Duval Street. Service resumed with barely a blink. The new Sloppy Joe's boasted the longest bar in town.  Behind the bar, in the back room, were gambling and the requisite pool tables. Skinner had pride of place above his new long curved bar. The bat that Skinner used to control his patrons now hangs on the wall.\n\nNicknames \u201cSloppy Joe\u201d Russell and \u201cJosie Grunts\u201d\nJoe Russell was a Conch.  Born and raised in Key West.  Conch is the name given to Key West natives; a name that derived from that of the tough, tasty mollusk found in the surrounding waters.  Russell was a charter boat captain, rum runner, Hemingway's boat pilot, and the author's fishing companion for twelve years. In his company, Papa once caught an astonishing fifty-four Marlin in 115 days. Hemingway called him \"Josie Grunts\" and used him as the model for Freddy, the owner of Freddy's Bar and captain of the Queen Conch in To Have and Have Not. \n\nWhen Joe officially opened the bar, Hemingway and his \"Mob\" of cohorts were enthusiastic regular customers. In fact, the author once called himself a co-owner or silent partner in the enterprise. The \"Mob\" was comprised of some of the literary lights of the day as well as a variety of famous and infamous local residents: John Dos Pasos, Waldo Pierce, J.B. Sullivan, Hamilton Adams, Captain Eddie Saunders, Henry Strater. They wrangled, drank, and philosophized the days away, never knowing they were building a legend.\n\nWhen Hemingway left Key West in 1939, he left a number of personal effects stored in a house next to Sloppy Joe's. After the house was sold, the effects were moved into the back room behind the bar at Sloppy Joe's. They remained there until 1962, a year after Hemingway's death, when his widow (fourth wife Mary Welsh Hemingway) opened the room and took possession of them, finding uncashed royalty checks, unfinished manuscripts, sections of original manuscript of \u201cTo Have and Have Not,\u201d letters, and personal items. Some of the memorabilia was given to the then-owner of the bar, Stan Smith, to be displayed.  One of the items was the snow skis that hang in the bar today.\n\nJoe Russell died June 20,1941 of a heart attack, he was 53 years old.  At the time Russell and Ernest Hemingway had been fishing in Cuba for three weeks, Hemingway telephoned Joe Russell Jr. to tell him of his father\u2019s death.  He is buried in the Key West Cemetery.\n\nSloppy Joe's Today\n\nSloppy Joe\u2019s was purchased September 8, 1978 by Sid Snelgrove and Jim Mayer and has been owned by the two families since that time.\n\nOver the years Sloppy Joe's, like rare Cuban rum, has gained a richness and flavor while essentially remaining unchanged. The ceiling fans still whisper busily, a little bit wobbly but carrying on. The jalousie doors open on a Duval Street busier than even Hemingway could imagine, yet still bearing the off-beat ambience that prompted him to brand Key West \"the St. Tropez of the Poor.\" The long curving bar wears the scars of generations of visitors and Hemingway aficionados, drawn by the legend and hoping some measure of magic will rub off on them - and it does.\n\nOpen 365 days a year, each day begins at 9:00 am (noon on Sundays).  Sloppy Joe\u2019s has four complimentary divisions: bar, food, entertainment, and the Retail Store. The bar offers generous drinks, live music on stage every day Noon to 2:00am, and dancing. The quality of the entertainment, showcased on the huge stage facing Duval Street, is exceptional.  The performers offer a wide range of music styles and comical entertainment.\n\nJust as in Joe Russell's day, hospitable Bartenders welcome patrons at virtually all hours of the day or night. The generous drinks and casual, undemanding atmosphere so successful in Russell's reign remain, as does the sense that something unusual is always about to happen at Sloppy Joe's.\n \t  \nThe main Bar structure was built in 1917; and the second building, which houses the Kitchen and Joe\u2019s Tap Room, was built in 1892.\n\nJoe\u2019s Tap Room is attached to Sloppy Joe\u2019s. Open daily at Noon, Joe\u2019s Tap Room has the same food menu as Sloppy Joe\u2019s and offers variety of crafted beers on tap.  The neighborhood has found Joe\u2019s Tap Room as a great place to meet friends and watch sports.\n\nSloppy Joe\u2019s Owners\nJoe \u201cSloppy Joe\u201d Russell Original owner, nickname Josie Grunts.
