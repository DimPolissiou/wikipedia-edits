A powerful yet overconfident warrior that serves under the command of [[Rita Repulsa]] and [[Lord Zedd]], he is one of the chief antagonists of the titular protagonists in the show's first three seasons. Goldar is based on the ''[[Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger]]'' villain [[List_of_Ky\u014dry\u016b_Sentai_Zyuranger_characters#Grifforzar|Grifforzar, also spelled as Grifforzer or Griforza by some sources]].<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Powerplay\"/>\n\nGoldar has been portrayed by numerous actors: in the ''Sentai'' footage repurposed for the Power Rangers, the Japanese actors who physically portrayed the character were Takashi Sakamoto for non-action scenes and Kazutoshi Yokoyama for battle sequences; while in original footage produced by [[Saban Entertainment]], Goldar was physically portrayed by Danny Wayne Stallcup for the first two seasons, and by David Wald and several other actors during season three. Goldar is voiced by [[Kerrigan Mahan]] in every major adaptation of the show since the franchise's inception, until the 2007 video game ''[[Power Rangers: Super Legends]]'' where the character is voiced by [[Nolan North]].<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> A reimagined version of Goldar is voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]] in the [[Power Rangers (film)|2017 reboot film]]. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series' characters, has been released since the inception of the ''Power Rangers'' franchise.\n\n==Character overview==\nGoldar is depicted as a bipedal alien from [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], who wields a sword, and wears a gold-plated suit of \"Titanian Armor\", with a matching helmet which looks like a mix of ancient Greek and Egyptian visual design. He had red eyes, a long mane, a wolf-like snout, and speaks in a gravelly voice.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> He originally Lord Zedd long ago, and was later assigned to serve Rita prior to their imprisonment on the Moon.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Overmind\"/> He is usually depicted as the obsequious commander of Rita and Zedd's minions, the Putty Patrol (or Putties), to frighten and distract the Power Rangers.<ref name=\"Media\"/> The Putties are typically used as a diversion for Goldar's masters to further their plans, and Goldar would often engage in speculation as to the likelihood of said plan's success.<ref name=\"Media\"/> \n\nGoldar is portrayed as a formidable enemy in the show's pilot episode, and often depicted in the show's early seasons as capable of holding his own against the entire Power Ranger team and defeat them single-handedly unlike many of their opponents.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Nerdbot\"/> In later seasons of the series, Goldar's characterization became less threatening and more comical in nature.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Overmind\"/> \n\n==Creation and development==\n[[File:GrifforzerConcept.png|left|thumb|Concept art of Grifforzar from ''[[Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger]]''.]]\nMuch of the footage for the ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' series was taken from the Japanese TV show ''Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger'' and used as the basis for its costumes, Zords, and villains.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Scenes were shot with North American actors and spliced together with recycled footage from ''Zyuranger'' together to make a brand new show with radically different plots and storylines.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n\nGoldar's design was initially identical to the original character design for his Zyuranger counterpart Grifforzar, which is visually similar to a [[manticore]]: a humanoid face, the body of a lion, and the tail of a scorpion. From the first episode, ''[[Day of the Dumpster]]'', to ''Lions and Blizzards'', the Goldar costume looked like [[The Bandora Gang|Grifforzar]], where the snout would move awkwardly whenever the character is talking.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Goldar's costume was revised in the show's second season, with more realistic skin, longer fangs, and a mouth that could fully move, though the old iteration of Goldar with the rising snout would occasionally appear in recycled footage.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n\nIn addition to the changes in his facial appearance, the revised costume has a permanent pair of extended wings.<ref name=Screenrant/> Although Goldar is shown with the ability to fly in early episodes, the wings on the ''Sentai'' original costume were designed to fold behind the character.<ref name=Screenrant/> The wings later disappear for reasons not explained within the season, though the show's writers later addressed this by making the wings symbolic.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Overmind\"/> When Goldar defects from [[Rita Repulsa|Rita]] upon [[Lord Zedd]]'s arrival in \"Mutiny, Part I\", Zedd uses his staff to restore Goldar's wings as reward for his loyalty.<ref name=\"Zedd\"/> It was implied that Rita had taken them away as punishment for the character's repeated failures against the Rangers, which was confirmed when he lost his wings during the ''Power Rangers Zeo'' series.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n\nMahan initially used a gruff, growling voice for Goldar's, but he could not sustain the voice which eventually took a toll on his vocal chords; while experimenting with different voices, he came up with a voice that was more low-pitched and grumbly.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Overmind\"/> Mahan's original high pitched voice for Goldar can still be heard in later episodes, particularly in recycled scenes where Goldar would fight or grow to giant size, as the showrunners did not re-dub any recycled footage.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n \n==Appearances==\n===In ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' ===\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers}}\nGoldar led Rita Repulsa's first invasion against Earth. However, he was soon faced the Power Rangers and was beaten by their Megazord after an intense fight. Ever since then, Goldar is a recurring opponent of the Rangers and their Zords, developing a particular vendetta for [[Jason Lee Scott]] and [[Tommy Oliver]], the Red and Green Rangers respectively.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> In the first season he is often berated by Rita for his failures, who calls him by a variety of derogatory names. This pattern also happened when [[Lord Zedd]] was introduced as well; in addition to insulting the now apparently incompetent golden warrior, he often blamed Goldar for his ''own'' failures, and had a habit of silencing him frequently. Goldar also pilots a [[Zord]] known as Cyclopsis, an ancient war machine owned by Rita, but the Zord was defeated by the Rangers' Ultrazord after a prolonged battle.<ref name=\"Overmind\"/> He was also one of [[Bulk and Skull]]'s more memorable encounters with a monster, where he picked up a bus with the duo inside while giant-sized.\n\nWhen [[Lord Zedd]] arrived on Rita's Moon palace in the second season, Goldar eagerly defected and regained his wings in the process. As Zedd's right hand man, Goldar led many missions for him, repeatedly encountering Tommy (now the White Ranger). Each time they fought, the White Ranger would best him, sending Goldar back to Zedd in disgrace. Rita later returned to the Moon and successfully seduced Zedd into marrying her as part of her plan of usurping Zedd. When he later discovered it was a cover for Rita's plot, he immediately made [[List_of_Mighty_Morphin_Power_Rangers_characters#Finster|Finster]] create an antidote for the love spell that Rita used.<ref name=\"Overmind\"/> Goldar discovered to his dismay that Zedd had come to love Rita on his own, even after the antidote has been applied. In the third season, Goldar is often paired with Rita's brother [[Rito Revolto]], and is often disgusted by his buffoonish behaviour. Goldar was also essential in Lord Zedd's powering of the [[Shogun Zords]], as he defeated the Power Rangers' ally Ninjor, allowing Zedd to capture and use him as a power source for the Zords.\n\n=== In ''Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers'' ===\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers}}\nIn the ''[[Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers]]'' mini series, which sets up the transition from ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' to ''Power Rangers Zeo'', Goldar and Rito plants a bomb outside of the Command Center, but it is defused by Alpha 5.  Goldar also played a role in the destruction of the Ninja power coins. Later, Goldar and Rito were sent to the Command Center, having been given a map of the Command Center's basement, and attempted to destroy the Command Center with an implosion device. The bomb went off and destroyed the Command Center. Just before the implosion device went off, Goldar steals the Zeo Crystal with the help of Rito. \n\n=== In ''Power Rangers Zeo'' ===\n{{main|Power Rangers Zeo}}\nIn ''Power Rangers Zeo'', the Rangers discovered the Zeo Crystal in the ruins of the Command Center, surmising that Rito and Goldar must have dropped it. An amnesiac Goldar, who also lost his wings along with his memories, is later seen wandering around [[Angel Grove]] along with Rito; as Zedd and Rita flee from the Machine Empire, one of their Tenga Warriors is seen carrying Goldar's detached wings after his failure to destroy the Rangers, despite successfully blowing up the Command Center.<ref name=Screenrant/> They eventually encountered Bulk and Skull, and ended up becoming their butlers in exchange for food and shelter. Zedd and Rita eventually found them and restored their memories. They returned to their masters and helped them in their quest to destroy the [[Machine Empire]].\n\n=== In ''Power Rangers in Space'' ===\n{{main|Power Rangers in Space}}\nGoldar's final appearance was in the final episode of ''Power Rangers in Space'', \"[[List of Power Rangers in Space episodes| Countdown to Destruction]]\". Unlike Rito, Goldar went with Zedd and Rita to the Cimmerian Planet for Dark Specter's conference, where he was responsible for revealing Andros' identity as a Power Ranger by removing his cloak.  He was later present in their invasion of the Vica Galaxy, helping to subdue the [[Trey of Triforia|Gold Ranger]]. Goldar's final fate remains unknown, as he was not shown among the other villains who were either destroyed or purified following Zordon's destruction as the subsequent energy wave.<ref name=Screenrant/> \n\n==Reception==\nGoldar is considered to be one of the ''Power Ranger'' franchise's most notable villains, and his original iteration's appearance is considered to be recognizable.<ref name=Screenrant/><ref name=\"Player\"/><ref name=Spin/> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin magazine]]'' described the character as a \"big freak with wings\" in their 1995 coverage of the franchise and the then-upcoming ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie''.<ref name=Spin/> Joe Otterson from ''[[The Wrap]]'' described Goldar as a \"gargoyle-type beast covered in gold armor\".<ref name=\"Melt\"/> Justin Harp from ''Digital Spy'' remembered the character as a \"hulking baboon-type creature with gold armour and a penchant for sassy comebacks\".<ref name=\"Digital\"/> Eric Francisco from Inverse said Goldar \"strongly resembled a [[Flying Monkey]] from [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]] on steroids\",<ref name=\"Inverse\"/> and Blair Marnell from ''The Nerdist'' opined that Goldar looks like an \"anthropomorphic ape-wolf with wings\".<ref name=Nerdist/> Loryn Stone from ''Nerdbot'' was of the view that Goldar stood out from the rest of the ''Power Ranger's'' ensemble cast of characters as a \"legitimately terrifying\" antagonist. She praised Goldar's characterization and depiction in ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'', and considered him to be the show's most definitive villain.<ref name=Nerdbot/> \n\n== In Other Media ==\n===Movies===\n==== In ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie'' ====\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie}}\n[[File:MovieGoldar1.jpg|left|thumb|Goldar in the 1995 film ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie]]''.]]\nGoldar appears as a thoroughly bumbling sidekick who serves Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa, and does not carry a sword unlike his television counterpart. His suit was specifically created for the movie and was of much higher quality than the ones seen in the show, as it allowed the character's face to be more expressive and had increased flexibility that allowed the actor to move naturally.<ref name=\"Overmind\"/>\n\nGoldar accompanies Zedd and Rita to Earth, where they release the sorcerer Ivan Ooze from his egg-like prison. Goldar and his cohort Mordant defects to Ooze immediately after he traps both Rita and Zedd in a snowglobe and deprive them of the their powers. He serves Ooze as his right hand man while the sorcerer terrorizes Angel Grove. He flees Earth for the Moon after Ivan Ooze merges with one of his monsters in an attempt to defeat the resurgent Power Rangers. In a mid-credits scene, Goldar had taken over the Moon palace and calls himself King Goldar. He lounges on Zedd's throne being served by Mordant, only to panic when Zedd and Rita unexpectedly appears to punish both him and Mordant.\n\n====''Power Rangers (2017 film)''====\n{{main|Power Rangers (2017 film)}}\n[[File:GoldarMovie2.jpg|left|thumb|A Goldar action figure, released to promote the 2017 film ''[[Power Rangers (film)|Power Rangers]]''.]]\n{{Quote box |width = 26em |align = right |quote = \"I said with my production designer language lets sort of push the envelope on him. And it seemed to start ... and I said, we always have to go back to the mythology we're creating. And the mythology that we are creating is that Rita can ... has control over elements around her.

He appears as a giant [[gargoyle]]-like monster made purely out of gold.<ref name=\"NYCC\"/> In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, director [[Dean Israelite]] envisioned Goldar to be a [[kaiju]]-like beast that would be a physical manifestation of Rita\u2019s evil, as opposed to an individual with a distinct personality.<ref name=\"EW\"/>  Israelite and production designer Andrew Menzies said Goldar is a faceless and intimidating extension of Rita which is nigh unstoppable, and designed the creature's look after a [[chocolate fountain]] with a melting form that never takes shape.<ref name=\"EW\"/> Menzies commented, \"I think as humans we always search for character in a face, and if it\u2019s always shifting and changing, it becomes scary\".<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\nIn the film's narrative, Goldar was created by Rita to penetrate the force field that protects the Zeo crystal. Goldar's molecular essence was scattered after he was vaporized by Zordon into a cloud of microscopic gold particles during the opening action sequence on Ancient Earth.<ref name=Wrap/> Rita reconstitutes Goldar by stealing gold from jewelry stores, buildings, and even dental implants to manifest the monster. As Rita orders Goldar to retrieve the Zeo Crystal from underneath the local [[Krispy Kreme]] shop, the Rangers confront him with their zords for the first time, which culminates in them assembling the Megazord. Rita attempts to counter them by merging herself with Goldar directly, but the Rangers are able to destroy the monster.\n\nA preview of Goldar's appearance, in the form of a tie-in action figure for the 2017 film has generated commentary about the film's visual direction, with various sources noting his gold-centric character design as one of the biggest departures from the 1990's series. Otterson described the iteration as \"someone took an old Goldar action figure and put it through a few popcorn cycles on a microwave\".<ref name=\"Melt\"/> Other sources have described his appearance as a \"melting candle of gold\",<ref name=Nerdist/> \"a giant chocolate fountain\",<ref name=\"Digital\"/> \"a golem formed out of molten, melted gold\",<ref name=\"Inverse\"/> and \"someone took the classic Goldar and drowned him in [[nacho cheese]].\"<ref name=\"Slash\"/>\n\n===Comics===\nGoldar appears as a recurring character in the ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' comic series, published by [[Boom! Studios]]. It is a modern alternate retelling of the TV series of the same name, and has no connections to any past media or the 2017 reboot film.<ref name=Screenrant/> The comic series revealed that Goldar once had a brother named Silverback, and they both served Lord Zedd as the emperor.<ref name=Screenrant/> At one point, Silverback tries to overthrow Zedd, who gravely wounds his traitor subordinate and instructs Goldar to finish off his own brother with his sword, who complies without much hesitation.<ref name=Screenrant/>\n\n===Video games===\n{{main|List of Power Rangers video games}}\nGoldar has appeared in multiple iterations of ''[[Power Rangers]]'' video games. He serves as the main villain in the Mighty Morphin' section of the game ''[[Power Rangers: Super Legends]]''.  He is first seen complaining about Rita making him do her dirty work. Lord Zedd then appears in a time hole and tells him to contaminate Angel Grove's water supply, zombifying everyone there to form an army of Z-Putties.  Goldar follows Zedd's demands, however the Power Rangers are hot on his tail.  The \"chase\" ends at Angel Grove, where Goldar is ready to contaminate the water supply, however the Power Rangers stop him and he is forced to grow. He is defeated in the [[Megazord]] battle.\n\n===Stage play===\nGoldar appeared in ''Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers Live'', a traveling stage show featuring voice recordings of the entire cast of the TV series for their lines and scenes, with different actors playing all the characters on stage.<ref name=Screenrant/>\n\n===Promotion and merchandise===\nLike many ''Power Rangers'' series characters, various merchandise has been made of Goldar since the inception of the franchise. An exclusive figure to video game retailer [[GameStop]] was released as part of the Power Rangers Lightning Collection. The action figure features Goldar's trademark sword and battle FX accessories, as well as fully articulated wings.<ref name=\"Gamestop\"/> Goldar's iteration in the 2017 reboot film was recreated as an action figure for the Power Rangers Movie Interactive Megazord series by [[Bandai]].<ref name=Nerdist/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em\n\n<!--TV Show-->\n<ref name=\"Zedd\">{{Cite episode |title=Mutiny Part I |series=Mighty Morphin Power Rangers |first= Shuki|last=Levy|network=Fox Kids |station=Fox |date=July 21, 1994 |season=2 |quote='''Lord Zedd''': \"Your spineless, sniveling attitude leads me to believe you will serve me well.

A powerful yet overconfident warrior that serves under the command of [[Rita Repulsa]] and [[Lord Zedd]], he is one of the chief antagonists of the titular protagonists in the show's first three seasons. Goldar is based on the ''[[Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger]]'' villain [[List_of_Ky\u014dry\u016b_Sentai_Zyuranger_characters#Grifforzar|Grifforzar, also spelled as Grifforzer or Griforza by some sources]].<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Powerplay\"/>\n\nGoldar has been portrayed by numerous actors: in the ''Sentai'' footage repurposed for the Power Rangers, the Japanese actors who physically portrayed the character were Takashi Sakamoto for non-action scenes and Kazutoshi Yokoyama for battle sequences; while in original footage produced by [[Saban Entertainment]], Goldar was physically portrayed by Danny Wayne Stallcup for the first two seasons, and by David Wald and several other actors during season three. Goldar is voiced by [[Kerrigan Mahan]] in every major adaptation of the show since the franchise's inception, until the 2007 video game ''[[Power Rangers: Super Legends]]'' where the character is voiced by [[Nolan North]].<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> A reimagined version of Goldar is voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]] in the [[Power Rangers (film)|2017 reboot film]]. Various merchandise for the character, as with other of the series' characters, has been released since the inception of the ''Power Rangers'' franchise.\n\n==Character overview==\nGoldar is depicted as a bipedal alien from [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], who wields a sword, and wears a gold-plated suit of \"Titanian Armor\", with a matching helmet which looks like a mix of ancient Greek and Egyptian visual design. He had red eyes, a long mane, a wolf-like snout, and speaks in a gravelly voice.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> He originally Lord Zedd long ago, and was later assigned to serve Rita prior to their imprisonment on the Moon.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Overmind\"/> He is usually depicted as the obsequious commander of Rita and Zedd's minions, the Putty Patrol (or Putties), to frighten and distract the Power Rangers.<ref name=\"Media\"/> The Putties are typically used as a diversion for Goldar's masters to further their plans, and Goldar would often engage in speculation as to the likelihood of said plan's success.<ref name=\"Media\"/> \n\nGoldar is portrayed as a formidable enemy in the show's pilot episode, and often depicted in the show's early seasons as capable of holding his own against the entire Power Ranger team and defeat them single-handedly unlike many of their opponents.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Nerdbot\"/> In later seasons of the series, Goldar's characterization became less threatening and more comical in nature.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Overmind\"/> \n\n==Creation and development==\n[[File:GrifforzerConcept.png|left|thumb|Concept art of Grifforzar from ''[[Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger]]''.]]\nMuch of the footage for the ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' series was taken from the Japanese TV show ''Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger'' and used as the basis for its costumes, Zords, and villains.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Scenes were shot with North American actors and spliced together with recycled footage from ''Zyuranger'' together to make a brand new show with radically different plots and storylines.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n\nGoldar's design was initially identical to the original character design for his Zyuranger counterpart Grifforzar, which is visually similar to a [[manticore]]: a humanoid face, the body of a lion, and the tail of a scorpion. From the first episode, ''[[Day of the Dumpster]]'', to ''Lions and Blizzards'', the Goldar costume looked like [[The Bandora Gang|Grifforzar]], where the snout would move awkwardly whenever the character is talking.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> Goldar's costume was revised in the show's second season, with more realistic skin, longer fangs, and a mouth that could fully move, though the old iteration of Goldar with the rising snout would occasionally appear in recycled footage.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n\nIn addition to the changes in his facial appearance, the revised costume has a permanent pair of extended wings.<ref name=Screenrant/> Although Goldar is shown with the ability to fly in early episodes, the wings on the ''Sentai'' original costume were designed to fold behind the character.<ref name=Screenrant/> The wings later disappear for reasons not explained within the season, though the show's writers later addressed this by making the wings symbolic.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Overmind\"/> When Goldar defects from [[Rita Repulsa|Rita]] upon [[Lord Zedd]]'s arrival in \"Mutiny, Part I\", Zedd uses his staff to restore Goldar's wings as reward for his loyalty.<ref name=\"Zedd\"/> It was implied that Rita had taken them away as punishment for the character's repeated failures against the Rangers, which was confirmed when he lost his wings during the ''Power Rangers Zeo'' series.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n\nMahan initially used a gruff, growling voice for Goldar's, but he could not sustain the voice which eventually took a toll on his vocal chords; while experimenting with different voices, he came up with a voice that was more low-pitched and grumbly.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/><ref name=\"Overmind\"/> Mahan's original high pitched voice for Goldar can still be heard in later episodes, particularly in recycled scenes where Goldar would fight or grow to giant size, as the showrunners did not re-dub any recycled footage.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> \n \n==Appearances==\n===In ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' ===\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers}}\nGoldar led Rita Repulsa's first invasion against Earth. However, he was soon faced the Power Rangers and was beaten by their Megazord after an intense fight. Ever since then, Goldar is a recurring opponent of the Rangers and their Zords, developing a particular vendetta for [[Jason Lee Scott]] and [[Tommy Oliver]], the Red and Green Rangers respectively.<ref name=\"Screenrant\"/> In the first season he is often berated by Rita for his failures, who calls him by a variety of derogatory names. This pattern also happened when [[Lord Zedd]] was introduced as well; in addition to insulting the now apparently incompetent golden warrior, he often blamed Goldar for his ''own'' failures, and had a habit of silencing him frequently. Goldar also pilots a [[Zord]] known as Cyclopsis, an ancient war machine owned by Rita, but the Zord was defeated by the Rangers' Ultrazord after a prolonged battle.<ref name=\"Overmind\"/> He was also one of [[Bulk and Skull]]'s more memorable encounters with a monster, where he picked up a bus with the duo inside while giant-sized.\n\nWhen [[Lord Zedd]] arrived on Rita's Moon palace in the second season, Goldar eagerly defected and regained his wings in the process. As Zedd's right hand man, Goldar led many missions for him, repeatedly encountering Tommy (now the White Ranger). Each time they fought, the White Ranger would best him, sending Goldar back to Zedd in disgrace. Rita later returned to the Moon and successfully seduced Zedd into marrying her as part of her plan of usurping Zedd. When he later discovered it was a cover for Rita's plot, he immediately made [[List_of_Mighty_Morphin_Power_Rangers_characters#Finster|Finster]] create an antidote for the love spell that Rita used.<ref name=\"Overmind\"/> Goldar discovered to his dismay that Zedd had come to love Rita on his own, even after the antidote has been applied. In the third season, Goldar is often paired with Rita's brother [[Rito Revolto]], and is often disgusted by his buffoonish behaviour. Goldar was also essential in Lord Zedd's powering of the [[Shogun Zords]], as he defeated [[Ninjor]], allowing Zedd to capture and use him as a power source for the Zords.\n\n=== In ''Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers'' ===\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers}}\nIn the ''[[Mighty Morphin Alien Rangers]]'' mini series, which sets up the transition from ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' to ''Power Rangers Zeo'', Goldar and Rito plants a bomb outside of the Command Center, but it is defused by Alpha 5.  Goldar also played a role in the destruction of the Ninja power coins. Later, Goldar and Rito were sent to the Command Center, having been given a map of the Command Center's basement, and attempted to destroy the Command Center with an implosion device. The bomb went off and destroyed the Command Center. Just before the implosion device went off, Goldar steals the Zeo Crystal with the help of Rito. \n\n=== In ''Power Rangers Zeo'' ===\n{{main|Power Rangers Zeo}}\nIn ''Power Rangers Zeo'', the Rangers discovered the Zeo Crystal in the ruins of the Command Center, surmising that Rito and Goldar must have dropped it. An amnesiac Goldar, who also lost his wings along with his memories, is later seen wandering around [[Angel Grove]] along with Rito; as Zedd and Rita flee from the Machine Empire, one of their Tenga Warriors is seen carrying Goldar's detached wings after his failure to destroy the Rangers, despite successfully blowing up the Command Center.<ref name=Screenrant/> They eventually encountered Bulk and Skull, and ended up becoming their butlers in exchange for food and shelter. Zedd and Rita eventually found them and restored their memories. They returned to their masters and helped them in their quest to destroy the [[Machine Empire]].\n\n=== In ''Power Rangers in Space'' ===\n{{main|Power Rangers in Space}}\nGoldar's final appearance was in the final episode of ''Power Rangers in Space'', \"[[List of Power Rangers in Space episodes| Countdown to Destruction]]\". Unlike Rito, Goldar went with Zedd and Rita to the Cimmerian Planet for Dark Specter's conference, where he was responsible for revealing Andros' identity as a Power Ranger by removing his cloak.  He was later present in their invasion of the Vica Galaxy, helping to subdue the [[Trey of Triforia|Gold Ranger]]. Goldar's final fate remains unknown, as he was not shown among the other villains who were either destroyed or purified following Zordon's destruction as the subsequent energy wave.<ref name=Screenrant/> \n\n==Reception==\nGoldar is considered to be one of the ''Power Ranger'' franchise's most notable villains, and his original iteration's appearance is considered to be recognizable.<ref name=Screenrant/><ref name=\"Player\"/><ref name=Spin/> ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin magazine]]'' described the character as a \"big freak with wings\" in their 1995 coverage of the franchise and the then-upcoming ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie''.<ref name=Spin/> Joe Otterson from ''[[The Wrap]]'' described Goldar as a \"gargoyle-type beast covered in gold armor\".<ref name=\"Melt\"/> Justin Harp from ''Digital Spy'' remembered the character as a \"hulking baboon-type creature with gold armour and a penchant for sassy comebacks\".<ref name=\"Digital\"/> Eric Francisco from Inverse said Goldar \"strongly resembled a [[Flying Monkey]] from [[The Wizard of Oz]] on steroids\",<ref name=\"Inverse\"/> and Blair Marnell from ''The Nerdist'' opined that Goldar looks like an \"anthropomorphic ape-wolf with wings\".<ref name=Nerdist/> Loryn Stone from ''Nerdbot'' was of the view that Goldar stood out from the rest of the ''Power Ranger's'' ensemble cast of characters as a \"legitimately terrifying\" antagonist. She praised Goldar's characterization and depiction in ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'', and considered him to be the show's most definitive villain.<ref name=Nerdbot/> \n\n== In Other Media ==\n===Movies===\n==== In ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie'' ====\n{{main|Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie}}\n[[File:MovieGoldar1.jpg|left|thumb|Goldar in the 1995 film ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers: The Movie]]''.]]\nGoldar appears as a thoroughly bumbling sidekick who serves Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa, and does not carry a sword unlike his television counterpart. His suit was specifically created for the movie and was of much higher quality than the ones seen in the show, as it allowed the character's face to be more expressive and had increased flexibility that allowed the actor to move naturally.<ref name=\"Overmind\"/>\n\nGoldar accompanies Zedd and Rita to Earth, where they release the sorcerer Ivan Ooze from his egg-like prison. Goldar and his cohort Mordant defects to Ooze immediately after he traps both Rita and Zedd in a snowglobe and deprive them of the their powers. He serves Ooze as his right hand man while the sorcerer terrorizes Angel Grove. He flees Earth for the Moon after Ivan Ooze merges with one of his monsters in an attempt to defeat the resurgent Power Rangers. In a mid-credits scene, Goldar had taken over the Moon palace and calls himself King Goldar. He lounges on Zedd's throne being served by Mordant, only to panic when Zedd and Rita unexpectedly appears to punish both him and Mordant.\n\n====''Power Rangers (2017 film)''====\n{{main|Power Rangers (2017 film)}}\n[[File:GoldarMovie2.jpg|left|thumb|A Goldar action figure, released to promote the 2017 film ''[[Power Rangers (film)|Power Rangers]]''.]]\n{{Quote box |width = 26em |align = right |quote = \"I said with my production designer language lets sort of push the envelope on him.

He appears as a giant [[gargoyle]]-like monster made purely out of gold.<ref name=\"NYCC\"/> In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, director [[Dean Israelite]] envisioned Goldar to be a [[kaiju]]-like beast that would be a physical manifestation of Rita\u2019s evil, as opposed to an individual with a distinct personality.<ref name=\"EW\"/>  Israelite and production designer Andrew Menzies said Goldar is a faceless and intimidating extension of Rita which is nigh unstoppable, and designed the creature's look after a [[chocolate fountain]] with a melting form that never takes shape.<ref name=\"EW\"/> Menzies commented, \"I think as humans we always search for character in a face, and if it\u2019s always shifting and changing, it becomes scary\".<ref name=\"EW\"/>\n\nIn the film's narrative, Goldar was created by Rita to penetrate the force field that protects the Zeo crystal. Goldar's molecular essence was scattered after he was vaporized by Zordon into a cloud of microscopic gold particles during the opening action sequence on Ancient Earth.<ref name=Wrap/> Rita reconstitutes Goldar by stealing gold from jewelry stores, buildings, and even dental implants to manifest the monster. As Rita orders Goldar to retrieve the Zeo Crystal from underneath the local [[Krispy Kreme]] shop, the Rangers confront him with their zords for the first time, which culminates in them assembling the Megazord. Rita attempts to counter them by merging herself with Goldar directly, but the Rangers are able to destroy the monster.\n\nA preview of Goldar's appearance, in the form of a tie-in action figure for the 2017 film has generated commentary about the film's visual direction, with various sources noting his gold-centric character design as one of the biggest departures from the 1990's series. Otterson described the iteration as \"someone took an old Goldar action figure and put it through a few popcorn cycles on a microwave\".<ref name=\"Melt\"/> Other sources have described his appearance as a \"melting candle of gold\",<ref name=Nerdist/> \"a giant chocolate fountain\",<ref name=\"Digital\"/> \"a golem formed out of molten, melted gold\",<ref name=\"Inverse\"/> and \"someone took the classic Goldar and drowned him in [[nacho cheese]].\"<ref name=\"Slash\"/>\n\n===Comics===\nGoldar appears as a recurring character in the ''Mighty Morphin Power Rangers'' comic series, published by [[Boom! Studios]]. It is a modern alternate retelling of the TV series of the same name, and has no connections to any past media or the 2017 reboot film.<ref name=Screenrant/> The comic series revealed that Goldar once had a brother named Silverback, and they both served Lord Zedd as the emperor.<ref name=Screenrant/> At one point, Silverback tries to overthrow Zedd, who gravely wounds his traitor subordinate and instructs Goldar to finish off his own brother with his sword, who complies without much hesitation.<ref name=Screenrant/>\n\n===Video games===\n{{main|List of Power Rangers video games}}\nGoldar has appeared in multiple iterations of ''[[Power Rangers]]'' video games. He serves as the main villain in the Mighty Morphin' section of the game ''[[Power Rangers: Super Legends]]''.  He is first seen complaining about Rita making him do her dirty work. Lord Zedd then appears in a time hole and tells him to contaminate Angel Grove's water supply, zombifying everyone there to form an army of Z-Putties.  Goldar follows Zedd's demands, however the Power Rangers are hot on his tail.  The \"chase\" ends at Angel Grove, where Goldar is ready to contaminate the water supply, however the Power Rangers stop him and he is forced to grow. He is defeated in the [[Megazord]] battle.\n\n===Stage play===\nGoldar appeared in ''Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers Live'', a traveling stage show featuring voice recordings of the entire cast of the TV series for their lines and scenes, with different actors playing all the characters on stage.<ref name=Screenrant/>\n\n===Promotion and merchandise===\nLike many ''Power Rangers'' series characters, various merchandise has been made of Goldar since the inception of the franchise. An exclusive figure to video game retailer [[GameStop]] was released as part of the Power Rangers Lightning Collection. The action figure features Goldar's trademark sword and battle FX accessories, as well as fully articulated wings.<ref name=\"Gamestop\"/> Goldar's iteration in the 2017 reboot film was recreated as an action figure for the Power Rangers Movie Interactive Megazord series by [[Bandai]].<ref name=Nerdist/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em\n\n<!--TV Show-->\n<ref name=\"Zedd\">{{Cite episode |title=Mutiny Part I |series=Mighty Morphin Power Rangers |first= Shuki|last=Levy|network=Fox Kids |station=Fox |date=July 21, 1994 |season=2 |quote='''Lord Zedd''': \"Your spineless, sniveling attitude leads me to believe you will serve me well.

{"title_page": "Titles of Mary", "text_new": "[[File:Our Lady of Good Counsel by Pasquale Sarullo.jpg|thumb|210px|''[[Our Lady of Good Counsel]]'' by [[Pasquale Sarullo]], 19th century.]]\n[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] is known by many different titles (Blessed Mother, Madonna, Our Lady), [[epithet]]s ([[Our Lady, Star of the Sea|Star of the Sea]], [[Queen of Heaven]], Cause of Our Joy), invocations (''[[Theotokos]]'', ''[[Panagia]]'', Mother of Mercy) and other names ([[Our Lady of Loreto]], [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]]).\n{{Mary}}\nAll of these titles refer to the same individual named Mary, the mother of [[Jesus Christ]] (in the [[New Testament]]) and are used variably by [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholics]], [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodox]], [[Oriental Orthodoxy|Oriental Orthodox]], and some [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]].  (Note: [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary of Clopas]], and [[Mary Salome]] are different individuals from Mary, mother of Jesus.)\n\nMany of the titles given to Mary are [[dogma]]tic in nature.  Other titles are poetic or allegorical and have lesser or no canonical status, but form part of [[popular piety]], with varying degrees of acceptance by the clergy.  Yet more titles refer to depictions of Mary in the [[history of art]].\n\n==Historical and cultural context==\n{{see also|History of Roman Catholic Mariology}}\n\nThere are several explanations of the significance of the relatively large number of titles given to Mary.<ref>[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/t/titles-reasons-for.php \u201cWhy does Mary have So Many Different Titles?\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref> Some titles grew due to geographic and cultural reasons, e.g., through the veneration of specific icons. Others were related to [[Marian apparitions]].\n\nMary's help is sought for a large spectrum of human needs in varied situations. This led to the formulation of many of her titles ([[Our Lady of Good Counsel|good counsel]], Help of the Sick, etc.). Moreover, meditations and devotions on the different aspects of the Virgin Mary's role within the life of Jesus led to additional titles, such as [[Our Lady of Sorrows]].<ref>Tavard, George Henry, ''The thousand faces of the Virgin Mary'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-8146-5914-4}} p. 95</ref> Still further titles have been derived from dogmas and doctrines, such as, the [[Immaculate Conception]].\n\nMary's [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] or \"''devotional cult''\" consolidated in the year 431 when, at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], the ''[[Theotokos]]'', or Mary as bearer (or mother) of God, was declared to be a [[dogma]].  Henceforth Marian devotion\u2014which centered on the subtle and complex relationship between Mary, Jesus, and the Church\u2014would flourish, first in the East and later in the West.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] diminished Mary's role in many parts of Northern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[Council of Trent]] and [[Counter Reformation]] would intensify Marian devotion in the West.  Around the same period, Mary would become an instrument of evangelization in the Americas and parts of Asia and Africa, e.g., via the apparitions at [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], which resulted in a large number of conversions to Christianity in [[Mexico]].\n\nFollowing the Reformation, as of the 17th century, the [[baroque]] literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth, with over 500 pages of [[Mariology|Mariological]] writings during the 17th  century alone.<ref>Roskovany, A., conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873</ref> During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the emphasis on [[scientific progress]] and [[rationalism]] put Catholic [[theology]] and Mariology often on the defensive in the later parts of the 18th century, to the extent that books such as ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'' (by [[Alphonsus Liguori]]) were written in defense of Mariology.\n\n==Dogmatic titles==\n* [[Mother of God]]: The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] decreed in 431 that Mary is ''Theotokos'' because her son Jesus is both God and man: one Divine Person with two natures (divine and human).<ref>by Braaten, Carl E. and Jenson, Robert W., ''Mary, Mother of God'', 2004 {{ISBN|0802822665}} p. 84</ref> This name was translated in the West as \"Mater Dei\" or Mother of God. From this derives the title \"Blessed Mother\".\n* [[Virgin Mary]]: The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary developed early in Christianity and was taught by the early Fathers, such as [[Irenaeus]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] (and others).<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15448a.htm Maas, Anthony. \"Virgin Birth of Christ.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 April 2016</ref> In the fourth century \"ever-virgin\" became a popular title for Mary.<ref>[[Donald Wuerl|Wuerl, Donald W.]] and Stubna, Kris D., [https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&pg=PA100&dq=mary's+perpetual+virginity+dogma&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXn_2o2oXMAhVJOD4KHXeIAaQ4ChDoAQhHMAg#v=onepage&q=mary's%20perpetual%20virginity%20dogma&f=false ''The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults''], Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|9781592760947}}</ref> Variations on this include the \"Virgin Mary\", the \"Blessed Virgin\", the \"Blessed Virgin Mary\", and \"Spouse of the Holy Spirit\". The perpetual virginity of Mary was declared a dogma by the Lateran Council of 649.\n* [[Immaculate Conception]]: The dogma that Mary was conceived without original sin was defined in 1854, by [[Pope Pius IX]]'s apostolic constitution ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]''. This gave rise to the titles of \"Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception\" and \"Queen Conceived Without Original Sin\". The Immaculate Conception is also honored under the titles of [[Our Lady of Caysasay]] (Philippines),<ref>[http://withonespast.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/ermita-nuestra-sra-de-guia/ \"In Honor of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guia\", De Anda (2009-11-22)],</ref> [[Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]] in [[Vilnius]], [[Our Lady of Guidance]], and [[Our Lady of Salambao]], also in the Philippines.\n*[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]: The belief that the Virgin Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven upon completing the course of her earthly life was declared a dogma in 1950 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in the apostolic constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''. The titles \"Our Lady of Assumption\" and \"Queen Assumed Into Heaven\" derive from this. This dogma is also reflected in devotion to [[Ta' Pinu|Our Lady of Ta' Pinu]] on Malta.\n\n==Early titles of Mary==\n\u201cOur Lady\u201d is a common title to give to Mary as a sign of respect and honor.

[[John Bosco|Don Bosco]] promoted devotion to Mary under this title.\n* ''Stella Maris'' or [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]] is an ancient title for the Virgin Mary, used to emphasize her role as a sign of hope and a guiding star for Christians.

Furthermore, she is interested by four different dogmas and a lot of Marian titles. Christians prayers, titles and arts witness her prominent role at the sight of the throne of God for the history of salvation.  \n\nIn the [[Hail Mary]] prayer, she is called \"full of [[divine grace|grace]]\" by the angel of the [[Annunciation#Eastern Christianity|Annunciation]] talking in the name and on behalf of God. In the [[Nicene Creed]], it is told that Jesus was \"incarnate by the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, and was made man\", meaning that the divine grace firstly concerns the Real Presence of the Holy Spirit God into her body, the degree of her participation to the life of the Holy Trinity as well as the amount of [[Gifts of the holy spirit|charisms of the Holy Spirit God]] she continuously receives and that only she is allowed by God to redistribute. \n\nThe Virgin Mother of God was anointed by the Holy Spirit God, summing up the anointings of the Kings, Prophets, Judges and High Priests of Israel, like Jesus Christ God did. For [[Marian apparition|Marian apparitions]] testify to her gift of prophecy, the Virgin Mary is assimilated to the [[anointing#Religion|anointed]] of Israel by her titles of: \n* Advocate of the Church (like the judges of Israel) \n* [[Mediatrix of all graces]]<ref>{{cite web | author = Mark Alessio | url = http://catholicism.org/mary-advocate-church.html | title = Mary, advocate of the Church and Mediatrix of all graces | date = 31 January 2006 | website = catholicism.org | archive-url = http://archive.is/J5Yew/ | archive-date = 9 March 2016 | url-status = live}}</ref> (like a High Priest of Israel),\n* Queen of Angels (like the kings of Israel): the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] paintings represent the [[hierarchy of angels]] of God while starting to serve Mary forever, after she has accepted to become the Mother of God.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic and in the Orthodox Church, the Virgin Mother of God is venerated in a special mode called with the Greek word [[hyperdulia]], that is secondary only to the adoration reserved to the Triune God. She is venerated and honoured in such a way since no other creature -both angelic and human- has a greater power than Mary to [[Intercession of saints#Catholic and Orthodox views|intercede]] the grace of God to His sons.\n\n==Titles associated with devotional images==\n[[File:Pe\u00f1afrancia Original Image.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia]] in [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]], [[Philippines]]]]\n{{See also|Black Madonna}}\n* A \"Black Madonna\" (or ''Vierges Noires'') is a type of statue or painting, generally of the 12th to 15th centuries, in which Mary, and oftentimes the infant [[Jesus]] are depicted with dark features.<ref>Duricy, Michael P., [https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/black-madonnas-origin-history-controversy.php \u201cBlack Madonnas: Origin, History, Controversy,\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref>  There are over 450 Black Madonnas in Europe.

(Note: [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary of Clopas]], and [[Mary Salome]] are different individuals from Mary, mother of Jesus.)\n\nMany of the titles given to Mary are [[dogma]]tic in nature.  Other titles are poetic or allegorical and have lesser or no canonical status, but form part of [[popular piety]], with varying degrees of acceptance by the clergy.  Yet more titles refer to depictions of Mary in the [[history of art]].\n\n==Historical and cultural context==\n{{see also|History of Roman Catholic Mariology}}\n\nThere are several explanations of the significance of the relatively large number of titles given to Mary.<ref>[https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/t/titles-reasons-for.php \u201cWhy does Mary have So Many Different Titles?\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref> Some titles grew due to geographic and cultural reasons, e.g., through the veneration of specific icons. Others were related to [[Marian apparitions]].\n\nMary's help is sought for a large spectrum of human needs in varied situations. This led to the formulation of many of her titles ([[Our Lady of Good Counsel|good counsel]], Help of the Sick, etc.). Moreover, meditations and devotions on the different aspects of the Virgin Mary's role within the life of Jesus led to additional titles, such as [[Our Lady of Sorrows]].<ref>Tavard, George Henry, ''The thousand faces of the Virgin Mary'' 1996 {{ISBN|0-8146-5914-4}} p. 95</ref> Still further titles have been derived from dogmas and doctrines, such as, the [[Immaculate Conception]].\n\nMary's [[Cult (religious practice)|cultus]] or \"''devotional cult''\" consolidated in the year 431 when, at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]], the ''[[Theotokos]]'', or Mary as bearer (or mother) of God, was declared to be a[[dogma]].  Henceforth Marian devotion\u2014which centered on the subtle and complex relationship between Mary, Jesus, and the Church\u2014would flourish, first in the East and later in the West.\n\nThe [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] diminished Mary's role in many parts of Northern Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries. The [[Council of Trent]] and [[Counter Reformation]] would intensify Marian devotion in the West.  Around the same period, Mary would become an instrument of evangelization in the Americas and parts of Asia and Africa, e.g., via the apparitions at [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], which resulted in a large number of conversions to Christianity in [[Mexico]].\n\nFollowing the Reformation, as of the 17th century, the [[baroque]] literature on Mary experienced unforeseen growth, with over 500 pages of [[Mariology|Mariological]] writings during the 17th  century alone.<ref>Roskovany, A., conceptu immacolata ex monumentis omnium seculrorum demonstrate III, Budapest 1873</ref> During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the emphasis on [[scientific progress]] and [[rationalism]] put Catholic [[theology]] and Mariology often on the defensive in the later parts of the 18th century, to the extent that books such as ''[[The Glories of Mary]]'' (by [[Alphonsus Liguori]]) were written in defense of Mariology.\n\n==Dogmatic titles==\n* [[Mother of God]]: The [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] decreed in 431 that Mary is ''Theotokos'' because her son Jesus is both God and man: one Divine Person with two natures (divine and human).<ref>by Braaten, Carl E. and Jenson, Robert W., ''Mary, Mother of God'', 2004 {{ISBN|0802822665}} p. 84</ref> This name was translated in the West as \"Mater Dei\" or Mother of God. From this derives the title \"Blessed Mother\".\n* [[Virgin Mary]]: The doctrine of the perpetual virginity of Mary developed early in Christianity and was taught by the early Fathers, such as [[Irenaeus]] and [[Clement of Alexandria]] (and others).<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15448a.htm Maas, Anthony. \"Virgin Birth of Christ.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 15. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 10 April 2016</ref> In the fourth century \"ever-virgin\" became a popular title for Mary.<ref>[[Donald Wuerl|Wuerl, Donald W.]] and Stubna, Kris D., [https://books.google.com/books?id=IzqDiPALzKEC&pg=PA100&dq=mary's+perpetual+virginity+dogma&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXn_2o2oXMAhVJOD4KHXeIAaQ4ChDoAQhHMAg#v=onepage&q=mary's%20perpetual%20virginity%20dogma&f=false ''The Teaching of Christ: A Catholic Catechism for Adults''], Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2004, {{ISBN|9781592760947}}</ref> Variations on this include the \"Virgin Mary\", the \"Blessed Virgin\", the \"Blessed Virgin Mary\", and \"Spouse of the Holy Spirit\". The perpetual virginity of Mary was declared a dogma by the Lateran Council of 649.\n* [[Immaculate Conception]]: The dogma that Mary was conceived without original sin was defined in 1854, by [[Pope Pius IX]]'s apostolic constitution ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]''. This gave rise to the titles of \"Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception\" and \"Queen Conceived Without Original Sin\". The Immaculate Conception is also honored under the titles of [[Our Lady of Caysasay]] (Philippines),<ref>[http://withonespast.wordpress.com/2009/11/22/ermita-nuestra-sra-de-guia/ \"In Honor of Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Guia\", De Anda (2009-11-22)],</ref> [[Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn]] in [[Vilnius]], [[Our Lady of Guidance]], and [[Our Lady of Salambao]], also in the Philippines.\n*[[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]]: The belief that the Virgin Mary was assumed body and soul into heaven upon completing the course of her earthly life was declared a dogma in 1950 by [[Pope Pius XII]] in the apostolic constitution ''[[Munificentissimus Deus]]''. The titles \"Our Lady of Assumption\" and \"Queen Assumed Into Heaven\" derive from this. This dogma is also reflected in devotion to [[Ta' Pinu|Our Lady of Ta' Pinu]] on Malta.\n\n==Early titles of Mary==\n\u201cOur Lady\u201d is a common title to give to Mary as a sign of respect and honor. In French she is called \"Notre Dame\" and in Spanish she is \"Nuestra Se\u00f1ora\".<ref>[http://www.dolr.org/article/marian-titles-chosen-one-out-four-churches-diocese Hargett, Malea. \"Marian titles chosen for one out of four churches in diocese\", ''Arkansas Catholic'', Diocese of Arkansas, May 20, 2006]</ref>\n\n* Mary was identified as the \"[[Nova Eva|New Eve]]\" as early as the later half of the Second Century. [[Justin Martyr]] (100\u2013165) draws the connection in his ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''. This idea is later expanded by [[Irenaeus]].<ref>Mauriello, Matthew R., [http://www.freifrancisco.com.br/2014/08/mary-new-eve-mariology.html \u201cMary the New Eve,\u201d] ''Frei Francisco''.</ref>\n* [[John Chrysostom]], in 345, was the first person to use the Marian title [[Mary Help of Christians]] as a devotion to the Virgin Mary. [[John Bosco|Don Bosco]] promoted devotion to Mary under this title.\n* ''Stella Maris'' or [[Our Lady, Star of the Sea]] is an ancient title for the Virgin Mary, used to emphasize her role as a sign of hope and a guiding star for Christians. It is attributed to [[Jerome]] and cited by [[Paschasius Radbertus]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=150| English !! width=100| Latin !! width=100| Greek !!

Furthermore, she is interested by four different dogmas and a lot of Marian titles. Christians prayers, titles and arts witness her prominent role at the sight of the throne of God for the history of salvation.  \n\nIn the [[Hail Mary]] prayer, she is called \"full of [[divine grace|grace]]\" by the angel of the [[Annunciation#Eastern Christianity|Annunciation]] talking in the name and on behalf of God. In the [[Nicene Creed]], it is told that Jesus was \"incarnate by the Holy Ghost and of the Virgin Mary, and was made man\", meaning that the divine grace firstly concerns the Real Presence of the Holy Spirit God into her body, the degree of her participation to the life of the Holy Trinity as well as the amount of [[Gifts of the holy spirit|charisms of the Holy Spirit God]] she continuously receives and that only she is allowed by God to redistribute. \n\nThe Virgin Mother of God was anointed by the Holy Spirit God, summing up the anointings of the Kings, Prophets, Judges and High Priests of Israel, like Jesus Christ God did. For [[Marian apparition|Marian apparitions]] testify to her gift of prophecy, the Virgin Mary is assimilated to the [[anointing#Religion|anointed]] of Israel by her titles of: \n* Advocate of the Church (like the judges of Israel) \n* [[Mediatrix of all graces]]<ref>{{cite web | author = Mark Alessio | url = http://catholicism.org/mary-advocate-church.html | title = Mary, advocate of the Church and Mediatrix of all graces | date = 31 January 2006 | website = catholicism.org | archive-url = http://archive.is/J5Yew/ | archive-date = 9 March 2016 | url-status = live}}</ref> (like a High Priest of Israel),\n* Queen of Angels (like the kings of Israel): the [[Coronation of the Virgin]] paintings represent the [[hierarchy of angels]] of God while starting to serve Mary forever, after she has accepted to become the Mother of God.\n\nIn the Roman Catholic and in the Orthodox Church, the Virgin Mother of God is venerated in a special mode called with the Greek word [[hyperdulia]], that is secondary only to the adoration reserved to the Triune God. She is venerated and honoured in such a way since no other creature -both angelic and human- has a greater power than Mary to [[Intercession of saints#Catholic and Orthodox views|intercede]] the grace of God to His sons.\n\n==Titles associated with devotional images==\n[[File:Pe\u00f1afrancia Original Image.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Our Lady of Pe\u00f1afrancia]] in [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga City]], [[Philippines]]]]\n{{See also|Black Madonna}}\n* A \"Black Madonna\" (or ''Vierges Noires'') is a type of statue or painting, generally of the 12th to 15th centuries, in which Mary, and oftentimes the infant [[Jesus]] are depicted with dark features.<ref>Duricy, Michael P., [https://udayton.edu/imri/mary/b/black-madonnas-origin-history-controversy.php \u201cBlack Madonnas: Origin, History, Controversy,\u201d] ''All About Mary'', International Marian Research Institute, University of Dayton.</ref>  There are over 450 Black Madonnas in Europe.
