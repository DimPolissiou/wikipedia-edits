It was the culmination of the [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]], the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]]. England won the final by four [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|wickets]], clinching their third World Cup title and their first outside England. It was the second time that the two teams had met at this stage of a World Cup \u2013 England won their previous final contest in 1993.\n\nBoth teams were unbeaten in the first group stage. In the second, known as the Super Sixes, New Zealand and England finished first and second to qualify directly for the final; New Zealand had only lost to England, while England had already guaranteed their place in the final when they lost their last match to Australia. England were considered the favourites for the final. The New Zealand [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], [[Haidee Tiffen]], won the [[Toss (cricket)|toss]], and opted to [[Batting (cricket)|bat]] first. Her side were [[bowled out]] for 166 [[Run (cricket)|runs]]. The [[all-rounder]] [[Lucy Doolan]], batting at [[Batting order (cricket)|number nine]], was the highest scorer for New Zealand with 48. [[Nicky Shaw]], one of England's bowlers, took a career-best four wickets for 34 runs. In their response, England built an opening [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 74 runs and continued to score steadily. Despite regularly losing wickets, they reached the winning total with 23 [[Delivery (cricket)|balls]] to spare, earning England their first World Cup title for 16 years. Shaw, who had initially not been included in the England team, was named [[Player of the Match awards (cricket)|player of the match]] having replaced the injured [[Jenny Gunn]] just minutes before the game started.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Women's Cricket World Cup}}\nThe [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]] was the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]], and the first to be organised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC).<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802230336/http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |title=Women's Cricket |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) |url=http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |url-status=dead |archivedate=2 August 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>{{efn|The ICC took over administration of the women's game in 2005, when it merged with the [[International Women's Cricket Council]] (IWCC).<ref>{{cite book |title=Routledge Handbook of Global Sport |editor1-last=Nauright |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Zipp |editor2-first=Sarah |year=2020 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] |p=202 |isbn=978-1-138-88723-7}}</ref>}} The first had been [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|held in 1973]], pre-dating the first [[Cricket World Cup|men's Cricket World Cup]] by two years.<ref>{{cite book |title=Skirting the Boundary: A History of Women's Cricket |last=Duncan |first=Isabelle |year=2013 |publisher=[[The Robson Press]] |location=London |isbn=978-1-84954-546-4 |page=139}}</ref> The 2009 tournament included eight teams;

It was the culmination of the [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]], the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]]. England won the final by four [[Wicket#Winning by number of wickets|wickets]], clinching their third World Cup title and their first outside England. It was the second time that the two teams had met at this stage of a World Cup \u2013 England won their previous final contest in 1993.\n\nBoth teams were unbeaten in the first group stage. In the second, known as the Super Sixes, New Zealand and England finished first and second to qualify directly for the final; New Zealand had only lost to England, while England had already guaranteed their place in the final when they lost their last match to Australia. England were considered the favourites for the final. The New Zealand [[Captain (cricket)|captain]], [[Haidee Tiffen]], won the [[Toss (cricket)|toss]], and opted to [[Batting (cricket)|bat]] first. Her side were [[bowled out]] for 166 [[Run (cricket)|runs]]. The [[all-rounder]] [[Lucy Doolan]], batting at [[Batting order (cricket)|number nine]], was the highest scorer for New Zealand with 48. [[Nicky Shaw]], one of England's bowlers, took a career-best four wickets for 34 runs. In their response, England built an opening [[Partnership (cricket)|partnership]] of 74 runs and continued to score steadily. Despite regularly losing wickets, they reached the winning total with 23 [[Delivery (cricket)|balls]] to spare, earning England their first World Cup title for 16 years. Shaw, who had initially not been included in the England team, was named [[Player of the Match awards (cricket)|player of the match]] having replaced the injured [[Jenny Gunn]] just minutes before the game started.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also|Women's Cricket World Cup}}\nThe [[2009 Women's Cricket World Cup]] was the ninth edition of [[Women's Cricket World Cup|the tournament]], and the first to be organised by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC).<ref>{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802230336/http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |title=Women's Cricket |publisher=[[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) |url=http://icc-cricket.yahoo.net/the-icc/pepsi_icc_development_programme/woman_cricket.php |url-status=dead |archivedate=2 August 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2020}}</ref>{{efn|The ICC took over administration of the women's game in 2005, when it merged with the [[International Women's Cricket Council]] (IWCC).<ref>{{cite book |title=Routledge Handbook of Global Sport |editor1-last=Nauright |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Zipp |editor2-first=Sarah |year=2020 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]] |p=202 |isbn=978-1-138-88723-7}}</ref>}} The first had been [[1973 Women's Cricket World Cup|held in 1973]], pre-dating the first [[Cricket World Cup|men's Cricket World Cup]] by two years.<ref>{{cite book |title=Skirting the Boundary: A History of Women's Cricket |last=Duncan |first=Isabelle |year=2013 |publisher=[[The Robson Press]] |location=London |isbn=978-1-84954-546-4 |page=139}}</ref> The 2009 tournament included eight teams;

In 1796, the British doctor [[Edward Jenner]] demonstrated that an infection with the relatively mild [[cowpox]] virus conferred immunity against the deadly [[smallpox]] virus. Cowpox served as a natural vaccine until the modern smallpox vaccine emerged in the 19th century. From 1958 to 1977, the [[World Health Organization]] conducted a global vaccination campaign that [[Smallpox#Eradication|eradicated smallpox]], making it the only human disease to be eradicated. Although routine smallpox vaccination is no longer performed on the general public, the vaccine is still being produced to guard against [[bioterrorism]] and [[biological warfare]].\n\nThe term ''vaccine'' derives from the Latin word for cow, reflecting the origins of smallpox vaccination. However, the exact origin of the smallpox vaccine is unclear. In the 20th century, the smallpox vaccine was identified as a separate viral species known as ''[[vaccinia]]'', which was serologically distinct from cowpox. Whole genome sequencing has shown that ''vaccinia'' is 99.7% identical to horsepox, with cowpox being a close relative.\n\n==Types==\n===Dryvax===\n[[Image:Smallpox vaccine injection.jpg|thumb|right|Smallpox vaccine being administered.

There is a set of old women who make it their business to perform the operation. Every autumn in the month of September, when the great heat is abated, people send to one another to know if any of their family has a mind to have the small-pox. They make parties for this purpose, and when they are met (commonly fifteen or sixteen together) the old woman comes with a nutshell full of the matter of the best sort of small-pox and asks what veins you please to have opened. She immediately rips open that you offer to her with a large needle (which gives you no more pain than a common scratch) and puts into the vein as much venom as can lye upon the head of her needle, and after binds up the little wound with a hollow bit of shell, and in this manner opens four or five veins. . . . The children or young patients play together all the rest of the day and are in perfect health till the eighth. Then the fever begins to seize them and they keep their beds two days, very seldom three. They have very rarely above twenty or thirty in their faces, which never mark, and in eight days time they are as well as before the illness. . . . There is no example of any one that has died in it, and you may believe I am very well satisfied of the safety of the experiment since I intend to try it on my dear little son. I am patriot enough to take pains to bring this useful invention into fashion in England, and I should not fail to write to some of our doctors very particularly about it if I knew any one of them that I thought had virtue enough to destroy such a considerable branch of their revenue for the good of mankind, but that distemper is too beneficial to them not to expose to all their resentment the hardy wight that should undertake to put an end to it.

This confirmed his childhood suspicion, and he studied cowpox further, presenting a paper on it to his local medical society.\n\nPerhaps there was already an informal public understanding of some connection between disease resistance and working with cattle. The \"beautiful [[milkmaid]]\" seems to have been a frequent image in the art and literature of this period. But it is known for certain that in the years following 1770, at least six people in England and Germany (Sevel, Jensen, [[Benjamin Jesty|Jesty]] 1774, Rendall, Plett 1791) tested successfully the possibility of using the cowpox vaccine as an immunization for smallpox in humans.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Hammarsten | first = J.

Jenner took the opportunity to test his theory. He inoculated [[James Phipps]], the eight-year-old son of his gardener, with material taken from the cowpox lesions on Sarah's hand. After a mild fever and the expected local lesion James recovered after a few days. About two months later Jenner inoculated James on both arms with material from a case of smallpox, with no effect; the boy was immune to smallpox.\n\n[[File:Smallpox vaccine.svg|thumb|\nDiagram A: Exposure to the cowpox virus builds immunity to the smallpox virus. 1a.

It is not known how many Jenner vaccinated or challenged by inoculation with smallpox virus; e.g. Case 21 included 'several children and adults'. Crucially all of at least four who Jenner deliberately inoculated with smallpox virus resisted it. These included the first and last patients in a series of arm-to-arm transfers. He concluded that cowpox inoculation was a safe alternative to smallpox inoculation, but rashly claimed that the protective effect was lifelong. This last proved to be incorrect.<ref name=Baxby1999/> Jenner also tried to distinguish between 'True' cowpox which produced the desired result and 'Spurious' cowpox which was ineffective and/or produced severe reaction. Modern research suggests Jenner was trying to distinguish between effects caused by what would now{{when|date=October 2019}} be recognised as noninfectious vaccine, a different virus (e.g. [[paravaccinia virus|paravaccinia]]/milker's nodes), or contaminating bacterial pathogens.

It was organised and co-ordinated by a [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) unit, set up and headed by [[Donald Henderson]]. The last case in the Americas occurred in 1971 (Brazil), south-east Asia (Indonesia) in 1972, and on the Indian subcontinent in 1975 (Bangladesh).

Accelerated by two cases of smallpox in 1978, one fatal ([[Janet Parker]]), caused by an accidental and unexplained containment breach at a laboratory at the [[University of Birmingham Medical School]], the WHO ensured that known stocks of smallpox virus were either destroyed or moved to safer laboratories.

In 1796, the British doctor [[Edward Jenner]] demonstrated that an infection with the relatively mild [[cowpox]] virus conferred immunity against the deadly [[smallpox]] virus. Cowpox served as a natural vaccine until the modern smallpox vaccine emerged in the 19th century. From 1958 to 1977, the [[World Health Organization]] conducted a global vaccination campaign that [[Smallpox#Eradication|eradicated smallpox]], making it the only human disease to be eradicated. Although routine smallpox vaccination is no longer performed on the general public, the vaccine is still being produced to guard against [[bioterrorism]] and [[biological warfare]].\n\nThe term ''vaccine'' derives from the Latin word for cow, reflecting the origins of smallpox vaccination. However, the exact origin of the smallpox vaccine is unclear. In the 20th century, the smallpox vaccine was identified as a separate viral species known as ''[[vaccinia]]'', which was serologically distinct from cowpox. Whole genome sequencing has shown that ''vaccinia'' is 99.7% identical to horsepox, with cowpox being a close relative.\n\n==Types==\n===Dryvax===\n[[Image:Smallpox vaccine injection.jpg|thumb|right|Smallpox vaccine being administered.

There is a set of old women who make it their business to perform the operation. Every autumn in the month of September, when the great heat is abated, people send to one another to know if any of their family has a mind to have the small-pox. They make parties for this purpose, and when they are met (commonly fifteen or sixteen together) the old woman comes with a nutshell full of the matter of the best sort of small-pox and asks what veins you please to have opened. She immediately rips open that you offer to her with a large needle (which gives you no more pain than a common scratch) and puts into the vein as much venom as can lye upon the head of her needle, and after binds up the little wound with a hollow bit of shell, and in this manner opens four or five veins. . . . The children or young patients play together all the rest of the day and are in perfect health till the eighth. Then the fever begins to seize them and they keep their beds two days, very seldom three. They have very rarely above twenty or thirty in their faces, which never mark, and in eight days time they are as well as before the illness. . . . There is no example of any one that has died in it, and you may believe I am very well satisfied of the safety of the experiment since I intend to try it on my dear little son. I am patriot enough to take pains to bring this useful invention into fashion in England, and I should not fail to write to some of our doctors very particularly about it if I knew any one of them that I thought had virtue enough to destroy such a considerable branch of their revenue for the good of mankind, but that distemper is too beneficial to them not to expose to all their resentment the hardy wight that should undertake to put an end to it.

At the age of 13, he was apprenticed to [[apothecary]] Daniel Ludlow and later surgeon George Hardwick in nearby [[Sodbury]]. He observed that people who caught cowpox while working with cattle were known not to catch smallpox. Jenner assumed a causal connection but the idea was not taken up at that time. From 1770 to 1772 Jenner received advanced training in London at St Georges Hospital and as the private pupil of [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]], then returned to set up practice in Berkeley.<ref name=Bailey1996/> When a smallpox epidemic occurred he advised the local cattle workers to be inoculated, but they told him that their previous cowpox infection would prevent smallpox. This confirmed his childhood suspicion, and he studied cowpox further, presenting a paper on it to his local medical society.\n\nPerhaps there was already an informal public understanding of some connection between disease resistance and working with cattle. The \"beautiful [[milkmaid]]\" seems to have been a frequent image in the art and literature of this period. But it is known for certain that in the years following 1770, at least six people in England and Germany (Sevel, Jensen, [[Benjamin Jesty|Jesty]] 1774, Rendall, Plett 1791) tested successfully the possibility of using the cowpox vaccine as an immunization for smallpox in humans.<ref>{{Cite journal | last = Hammarsten | first = J.

Jenner took the opportunity to test his theory. He inoculated [[James Phipps]], the eight-year-old son of his gardener, with material taken from the cowpox lesions on Sarah's hand. After a mild fever and the expected local lesion James recovered after a few days. About two months later Jenner inoculated James on both arms with material from a case of smallpox, with no effect; the boy was immune to smallpox.\n\n[[File:Smallpox vaccine.svg|thumb|\nDiagram A: Exposure to the cowpox virus builds immunity to the smallpox virus. 1a.

Out of 20 cowpox strains that have been sequenced, the cowpox strains found in Great Britain are the ''least'' related to vaccinia.<ref name=\"carroll2011\">{{cite journal |last1=Carroll |first1=Darin S. |last2=Emerson |first2=Ginny L. |last3=Li |first3=Yu |last4=Sammons |first4=Scott |last5=Olson |first5=Victoria |last6=Frace |first6=Michael |last7=Nakazawa |first7=Yoshinori |last8=Czerny |first8=Claus Peter |last9=Tryland |first9=Morten |last10=Kolodziejek |first10=Jolanta |last11=Nowotny |first11=Norbert |last12=Olsen-Rasmussen |first12=Melissa |last13=Khristova |first13=Marina |last14=Govil |first14=Dhwani |last15=Karem |first15=Kevin |last16=Damon |first16=Inger K. |last17=Meyer |first17=Hermann |title=Chasing Jenner's Vaccine: Revisiting Cowpox Virus Classification |journal=PLOS ONE |date=8 August 2011 |volume=6 |issue=8 |pages=e23086 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023086 |url=https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0023086 |language=en |issn=1932-6203|doi-access=free }}</ref> However, the exact origin of vaccinia remains unclear. While rabbitpox is known to be a laboratory strain of vaccinia, the connection between vaccinia and horsepox is still debated. Some researchers believe that the smallpox vaccine was created from cowpox strains found in continental Europe, and horsepox is a laboratory variant of vaccinia that escaped into the wild.<ref name=\"smithson2014\"/> Others believe that horsepox is the ancestral strain that evolved into vaccinia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Schrick |first1=Livia |last2=Tausch |first2=Simon H. |last3=Dabrowski |first3=P.

{"title_page": "Ernesto Tornquist", "text_new": "[[Image:Ernesto_Tornquist_LN-AGN_(cropped).jpg|right|thumb|150px|Ernesto Tornquist.]]\n'''Ernesto Carlos Tornquist''' (31 December 1842 \u2013 17 June 1908) was an [[Argentines|Argentinian]] [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]] and [[Businessperson|businessman]], considered to be one of the most important entrepreneurs in Argentina at the end of the 19th century.  The diversified business empire he created played a key role in helping to link Argentina with the trading and financial systems of the first world.  Amongst many other achievements, he founded the Tornquist Bank, the Plaza Hotel in [[Buenos Aires]], the [[Partidos of Buenos Aires|partido]] of [[Tornquist Partido|Tornquist]] and [[Tornquist, Buenos Aires|Tornquist]] its main city, in the south of [[Buenos Aires Province]].\n\n== Biography ==\nBorn in Buenos Aires in 1842, Ernesto Tornquist was the seventh son of [[George Tornquist|Jorge Pedro Ernesto Tornquist]] (1801-1876), a [[Lutheran]] born in [[Baltimore]], United States and whose parents came from a [[Germany|German]] family in the city of [[Hamburg]] with roots in [[Karlskrona]] in Sweden. The father was consul of the city of [[Bremen]] in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]], and was an importer and property investor in Buenos Aires. His mother, Rosa Camusso Alsina, a [[Catholic]], was born in Buenos Aires in 1805 and died there of [[yellow fever]] in 1871.\n\nTornquist started his schooling at Escuela Evang\u00e9lica Alemana and in 1856 was sent to study in Germany in the city of [[Krefeld]] for two years.  On his return to Argentina he took up a job working for a company directed by his brother-in-law which [[export]]ed [[wool]] and [[leather]] and [[import]]ed [[agricultural machinery]].  In 1872 he married his niece, Rosa Altgelt Tornquist in Buenos Aires, and in 1874 took over the running of his brother-in-law's company which was now renamed, ''Ernesto Tornquist y Cia''.  With the help of Belgium capital the company diversified its activities to include investment in the sugar, meat-salting and cold-storage industries.  The company also invested in railways and acquired land in the provinces of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]] and [[Entre R\u00edos Province|Entre Rios]],  previously occupied by Indians.  In the 1880s he set up a large sugar refinery, ''Refineria Argentina'', in [[Rosario]].  Other initiatives included founding the ''Bieckert'' brewery, the ''Seeber'' [[margarine]] manufacturer and the ''Bianchetti'' [[Weighing scale|scale]] manufacturer.\n[[File:Marriott Plaza Hotel Buenos Aires, Argentina - exterior.JPG|right|thumb|150px|Marriott Plaza Hotel]]\n\nOn 17 April 1883 he founded Tornquist, the main city of Tornquist Partido, in the south of Buenos Aires Province.  From the beginning the town was organized as an agricultural colony for German and [[Volga German]] immigrants.  After the economic crisis of 1890 he took charge of organizing the recovery of the company ''Sansinena'' and its cold-storage plant ''La Negra'' in [[Villa Riachuelo|Riachuelo]] and set up the plant ''Cuartreros'' in [[Bah\u00eda Blanca]].\n\nAmongst other activities the Tornquist group organised the hunting of whales (not controversial in those days) around the [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|South Georgia Islands]] through  the ''Compa\u00f1\u00eda Argentina de Pesca'', oil exploration in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], the exploitation of [[Quebracho tree|quebracho]] in [[Santiago del Estero]] and the construction of the Ferrocarril del Norte de Santa Fe with the help of Belgium capital.\n\nErnesto Tornquist played a crucial role in helping to avoid a war between [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] in 1902 by managing the British mediation in the border dispute, and by strongly opposing the bellicose Foreign Minister [[Estanislao Zeballos]].  He represented the German armaments group [[Krupp]] in Buenos Aires where he organised a strong lobby for the armaments industry, whilst on the other hand he helped to resolve a conflict with Brazil.\n\nIn 1903 he built the [[estancia]], ''Sierra de la Ventana'', in Tornquist, designed by the German immigrant architect [[Carlos Nordmann]] in [[Gothic Architecture|Gothic]] style typical of German castles in the [[Rhine|Rhine Valley]].  The grounds were designed by the French immigrant landscape architect, [[Carlos Thays]].\n\nHe maintained a close friendship with Argentine presidents [[Julio A. Roca]] and [[Carlos Pellegrini]] and tenaciously opposed the militaristic plans of the War Minister Estanislao Zeballos during the presidency of [[Jos\u00e9 Figueroa Alcorta]] (1906-1910).\n\nIn 1909 he built the [[Marriott Plaza Hotel, Buenos Aires|Plaza Hotel]] (today called the Marriott Plaza Hotel), designed by the German architect Alfredo Zucker, in Florida street, overlooking [[Plaza San Mart\u00edn (Buenos Aires)|Plaza San Martin]] in Buenos Aires.\n\nHe died in 1908 in Buenos Aires and since 1980 his remains are buried in the local church in the town of Tornquist.\n\n== References ==\n* ''Ernesto Tornquist'', por Fernando M.

{"title_page": "Henry Burnell", "text_new": "{{for| his grandson, the Irish politician, playwright and landowner|Henry Burnell (author)}}\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n\n'''Henry Burnell''' (c. 1540\u20131614) was an Irish judge and politician; he served briefly as  [[Recorder of Dublin]] and  as a justice of the [[Court of King's Bench (Ireland)|Court of King's Bench]]. Though he was  willing to accept Crown office, he spent much of his career in opposition to  the Government. He was one of the leaders of the protest against the  policies of  the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir [[Henry Sidney]],  in the late 1570s, and as a member of the [[Irish House of Commons]] in the 1580s  he successfully opposed  Sidney's successor, Sir [[John Perrot]]. In the early 1600s he was one of the leaders of the protest against strict enforcement of the [[Penal Laws]]. His professional reputation was gravely  damaged in his later years when he was convicted and fined  for having altered a deed concerning the 11th  Earl of Kildare's estate. He was the grandfather of the playwright Henry Burnell.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born in [[Castleknock]], County [[Dublin]], son of John Burnell.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921'' John Murray London 1926 p.223</ref> The Burnells were a long-established Dublin  family, which had settled at [[Balgriffin]]; they  were descended from Robert Burnell, who was a Baron of the [[Court of Exchequer (Ireland)]] between about 1388 and 1413.<ref>Ball p.223</ref> An earlier [[John Burnell]] was briefly [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]] in the 1490s. The family were staunchly   Roman Catholic and their loyalty to the Crown was sometimes questioned as a result. Henry's father had managed to retain his  estates after his cousin, another  John  Burnell, had been executed for his part in the rebellion of [[Silken Thomas]] in the 1530s; the elder Henry  was still alive, although described as \"very old\", in 1577. Henry was at [[Lincoln's Inn]]  in 1561-2 and was one of a group of  Irish students who compiled a book detailing the maladministration of [[the Pale]]. He returned to Ireland to practice law about 1564.\n\nIn 1573 he was appointed Recorder of Dublin but resigned  little over a year later. His motives are unclear but since he emerged soon after as legal adviser to [[Gerald FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Kildare|the Earl of Kildare]] it is likely that he found private practice more lucrative.<ref name=\"Ball\">Ball, p.223</ref> Even Sir Henry Sidney, a stern critic of Burnell, admitted that there was no doubt of  his  great success at the Bar, which had made him a rich man.<ref>[[Richard Bagwell]]  ''Ireland Under the Tudors''  London Longman Greens  3 Volumes 1885-90  Vol. II p.329</ref>\n\n==Cess controversy==\nThe ''cess'', a tax levied on the landowners   of  [[the Pale]],  supposedly for military purposes, had always been unpopular, and Burnell had denounced it as early as 1562. In 1576 the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], Henry Sidney, announced ambitious plans to reform and extend it. The landowners of the Pale protested that the cost would be ruinous.<ref>Bagwell pp.328-9</ref> Burnell was  one of a deputation of eminent lawyers chosen to petition [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] directly against the cess, the others being [[Richard Netterville]] and [[Barnaby Skurloke or Skurlog|Barnaby Skurlock]]. The mission went badly; Elizabeth took grave  offence at the challenge to her [[royal prerogative]] and at Sidney's urging  she imprisoned the three lawyers in the [[Fleet Prison]]. Given his family's previous  association with [[Silken Thomas]] Burnell was vulnerable to accusations of disloyalty.  Sidney, while grudgingly calling him the most honest of the three lawyers (if only he would stay out of politics), accused him of being a \"perverse Papist\" with  \"a great thirst to rid his country of the English.\"<ref name=\"Bagwell p.329\">Bagwell p.329</ref>  As opposition to Sidney's plans mounted and he began thinking of  asking for his   recall to England, the tension eased and the three lawyers  were freed in return for  making an abject apology.<ref>Nolan, Pierce Laurence \"Richard Netterville\" ''Dictionary of National Biography 1885\u20131900 Vol.40'' pp.237\u20138</ref>\n\n==Parliament of 1585==\nBurnell and Richard Netterville returned to their opposition role in the Irish Parliament of 1585,  to which Burnell had been returned as  a [[knight of the shire]] for [[Dublin County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|County Dublin]]. The new Lord Deputy Sir John Perrot, like Sidney before him,  had an ambitious reform program, but the opposition thwarted him at every opportunity, even insisting on examining his accounts, for which Perrot wished them \"foul scorn\". He imprisoned some of the opposition members,  but was unable to get his  legislative program passed.<ref>Crawford, Jon.G  ''A Star Chamber Court in Ireland -the Court of Castle Chamber 1571\u20131641'' Four Courts Press Dublin 2005 p246</ref>\n\nSomewhat surprisingly Burnell was once more appointed to the Bench in 1590 as third justice of the King's Bench.<ref name=\"Ball\" /> However he served only for a single term, which may suggest  that it was only a temporary office, or that doubts had once more been raised about his loyalty.\n\n==Penal laws==\nBurnell was a staunch [[Roman Catholic]] and strongly objected to the [[Anglican]] settlement; in 1605-6 he was one of the strongest supporters of [[Patrick Barnewall (died 1622)|Patrick Barnewall]] in his protest against the fines imposed for failure to attend [[Anglican]] service and the use of the [[Court of Castle Chamber]] to impose religious conformity. Yet again he was arrested but, probably because of his age,  he was not imprisoned.<ref>Kenny, Colum ''The King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland'' Irish Academic Press Dublin 1992 p.66</ref>\n\n==''Digby v Earl of Kildare''==\nIn his last years his  professional reputation  suffered  greatly from the reopening of the Kildare inheritance dispute which  had begun 20 years earlier. [[Lettice Digby, 1st Baroness Offaly]] was the granddaughter and heir general of Burnell's old client the 11th Earl of Kildare and his wife [[Mabel Browne]].

Though he was  willing to accept Crown office, he spent much of his career in opposition to  the Government. He was one of the leaders of the protest against the  policies of  the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir [[Henry Sidney]],  in the late 1570s, and as a member of the [[Irish House of Commons]] in the 1580s  he successfully opposed  Sidney's successor, Sir [[John Perrot]]. In the early 1600s he was one of the leaders of the protest against strict enforcement of the [[Penal Laws]]. His professional reputation was gravely  damaged in his last years when he was convicted and fined  for having altered a deed concerning the 11th  Earl of Kildare's estate. He was the grandfather of the playwright Henry Burnell.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born in [[Castleknock]], County [[Dublin]], son of John Burnell.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921'' John Murray London 1926 p.223</ref> The Burnells were a long-established Dublin  family, which had settled at [[Balgriffin]]; they  were descended from Robert Burnell, who was a Baron of the [[Court of Exchequer (Ireland)]] between about 1388 and 1413.<ref>Ball p.223</ref> An earlier [[John Burnell]] was briefly [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]] in the 1490s. The family were staunchly   Roman Catholic and their loyalty to the Crown was sometimes questioned as a result. Henry's father had managed to retain his  estates after his cousin, another  John  Burnell, had been executed for his part in the rebellion of [[Silken Thomas]] in the 1530s; the elder Henry  was still alive, although described as \"very old\", in 1577. Henry was at [[Lincoln's Inn]]  in 1561-2 and was one of a group of  Irish students who compiled a book detailing the maladministration of [[the Pale]]. He returned to Ireland to practice law about 1564.\n\nIn 1573 he was appointed Recorder of Dublin but resigned  little over a year later. His motives are unclear but since he emerged soon after as legal adviser to [[Gerald FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Kildare|the Earl of Kildare]] it is likely that he found private practice more lucrative.<ref name=\"Ball\">Ball, p.223</ref> Even Sir Henry Sidney, a stern critic of Burnell, admitted that there was no doubt of  his  great success at the Bar, which had made him a rich man.<ref>[[Richard Bagwell]]  ''Ireland Under the Tudors''  London Longman Greens  3 Volumes 1885-90  Vol. II p.329</ref>\n\n==Cess controversy==\nThe ''cess'', a tax levied on the landowners   of  [[the Pale]],  supposedly for military purposes, had always been unpopular, and Burnell had denounced it as early as 1562. In 1576 the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], Henry Sidney, announced ambitious plans to reform and extend it. The landowners of the Pale protested that the cost would be ruinous.<ref>Bagwell pp.328-9</ref> Burnell was  one of a deputation of eminent lawyers chosen to petition [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] directly against the cess, the others being [[Richard Netterville]] and [[Barnaby Skurloke or Skurlog|Barnaby Skurlock]]. The mission went badly; Elizabeth took grave  offence at the challenge to her [[royal prerogative]] and at Sidney's urging  she imprisoned the three lawyers in the [[Fleet Prison]]. Given his family's previous  association with [[Silken Thomas]] Burnell was vulnerable to accusations of disloyalty.  Sidney, while grudgingly calling him the most honest of the three lawyers (if only he would stay out of politics), accused him of being a \"perverse Papist\" with  \"a great thirst to rid his country of the English.\"<ref name=\"Bagwell p.329\">Bagwell p.329</ref>  As opposition to Sidney's plans mounted and he began thinking of  asking for his   recall to England, the tension eased and the three lawyers  were freed in return for  making an abject apology.<ref>Nolan, Pierce Laurence \"Richard Netterville\" ''Dictionary of National Biography 1885\u20131900 Vol.40'' pp.237\u20138</ref>\n\n==Parliament of 1585==\nBurnell and Richard Netterville returned to their opposition role in the Irish Parliament of 1585,  to which Burnell had been returned as  a [[knight of the shire]] for [[Dublin County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|County Dublin]]. The new Lord Deputy Sir John Perrot, like Sidney before him,  had an ambitious reform program, but the opposition thwarted him at every opportunity, even insisting on examining his accounts, for which Perrot wished them \"foul scorn\". He imprisoned some of the opposition members,  but was unable to get his  legislative program passed.<ref>Crawford, Jon.G  ''A Star Chamber Court in Ireland -the Court of Castle Chamber 1571\u20131641'' Four Courts Press Dublin 2005 p246</ref>\n\nSomewhat surprisingly Burnell was once more appointed to the Bench in 1590 as third justice of the King's Bench.<ref name=\"Ball\" /> However he served only for a single term, which may suggest  that it was only a temporary office, or that doubts had once more been raised about his loyalty.\n\n==Penal laws==\nBurnell was a staunch [[Roman Catholic]] and strongly objected to the [[Anglican]] settlement; in 1605-6 he was one of the strongest supporters of [[Patrick Barnewall (died 1622)|Patrick Barnewall]] in his protest against the fines imposed for failure to attend [[Anglican]] service and the use of the [[Court of Castle Chamber]] to impose religious conformity. Yet again he was arrested but, probably because of his age,  he was not imprisoned.<ref>Kenny, Colum ''The King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland'' Irish Academic Press Dublin 1992 p.66</ref>\n\n==''Digby v Earl of Kildare''==\nIn his last years his  professional reputation  suffered  greatly from the reopening of the Kildare inheritance dispute which  had begun 20 years earlier. [[Lettice Digby, 1st Baroness Offaly]] was the granddaughter and heir general of Burnell's old client the 11th Earl of Kildare and his wife [[Mabel Browne]]. Lettice and her husband deeply resented the fact that the great bulk of the Kildare inheritance had passed first to her uncle and then to her cousin [[Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Kildare]].
