It's the 40th episode overall, first broadcast on April&nbsp;24, 1989.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the [[Starfleet]] crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) | Federation starship Enterprise-D]].  In this episode, Riker must decide whether to accept command of his own starship, and negative feelings surface when his estranged father arrives to brief him on the mission. Wesley Crusher, La Forge and Data attempt to determine why Worf seems more agitated than usual, and discover that he is upset over not participating in a key Klingon ritual.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]]'', under the command of Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]], is en route to Starbase Montgomery to run diagnostics on its engines, Picard receives a message from [[Starfleet]] offering First Officer [[William Riker|Commander William Riker]] a command of his own, the ''Aries'', which is on a potentially dangerous exploration mission in a distant sector. Picard advises Riker that while the ''Enterprise'' is a prestigious assignment, it cannot replace the experience of having one's own command, and gives him 12 hours\u2014the duration of their stop at the starbase\u2014to decide. Riker's decision is complicated by the fact that the civilian adviser Starfleet has sent to brief him on his mission turns out to be his father, Kyle Riker ([[Mitchell Ryan]]), with whom he has an antagonistic relationship.\n\nAfter his father makes several attempts to reconcile, which Will rebuffs, the tension between the two finally boils over, and they agree to a match of anbo-jitsu, a form of martial arts. During the match, the two continue to argue, with Will venting his bitterness over the death of his mother. Will interrupts the match, claiming a move his father used is illegal, and realizes his father had only been able to beat him in his youth by cheating, which his father admits. The two are finally able to talk and reconcile, and Will admits he is glad his father came.\n\nMeanwhile, Acting Ensign [[Wesley Crusher]] notices that Lieutenant [[Worf]] is acting particularly agitated, and enlists the help of Chief Engineer [[Geordi La Forge]] and [[Data (Star Trek)|Commander Data]] to find out why. The trio eventually learn that Worf was coming upon an important anniversary, 10 years since his Age of Ascension, which is normally celebrated with an important [[Klingon]] ritual among other Klingons. They recreate the ritual, which involves a [[running the gauntlet|gauntlet]] of Klingon warriors brandishing pain sticks, on the [[holodeck]] as a surprise for Worf.  While reciting vows of honor, Worf undergoes jolts from the sticks with each step forward, enduring the extreme pain, and finally reaches the end, where he is grateful to his \"family\" aboard the ship for honoring him in this way.\n\n==Notes==\n''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' co-host [[John Tesh]] plays a holographic Klingon in the ritual scene, having enthusiastically volunteered for the part while covering the filming of this episode for his show.\n\n[[Anbo-Jitsu]], the fictitious sport shown in this episode, involves fighting with staffs while blindfolded.

It's the 40th episode overall, first broadcast on April&nbsp;24, 1989.\n\nSet in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the [[Starfleet]] crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D) | Federation starship Enterprise-D]].  In this episode, Riker must decide whether to accept command of his own starship, and negative feelings surface when his estranged father arrives to brief him on the mission. Wesley Crusher, La Forge and Data attempt to determine why Worf seems more agitated than usual, and discover that he is upset over not participating in a key Klingon ritual.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]]'', under the command of Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]], is en route to Starbase Montgomery to run diagnostics on its engines, Picard receives a message from [[Starfleet]] offering First Officer [[William Riker|Commander William Riker]] a command of his own, the ''Aries'', which is on a potentially dangerous exploration mission in a distant sector. Picard advises Riker that while the ''Enterprise'' is a prestigious assignment, it cannot replace the experience of having one's own command, and gives him 12 hours\u2014the duration of their stop at the starbase\u2014to decide. Riker's decision is complicated by the fact that the civilian adviser Starfleet has sent to brief him on his mission turns out to be his father, Kyle Riker ([[Mitchell Ryan]]), with whom he has an antagonistic relationship.\n\nAfter his father makes several attempts to reconcile, which Will rebuffs, the tension between the two finally boils over, and they agree to a match of anbo-jitsu, a form of martial arts. During the match, the two continue to argue, with Will venting his bitterness over the death of his mother. Will interrupts the match, claiming a move his father used is illegal, and realizes his father had only been able to beat him in his youth by cheating, which his father admits. The two are finally able to talk and reconcile, and Will admits he is glad his father came.\n\nMeanwhile, Acting Ensign [[Wesley Crusher]] notices that Lieutenant [[Worf]] is acting particularly agitated, and enlists the help of Chief Engineer [[Geordi La Forge]] and [[Data (Star Trek)|Commander Data]] to find out why. The trio eventually learn that Worf was coming upon an important anniversary, 10 years since his Age of Ascension, which is normally celebrated with an important [[Klingon]] ritual among other Klingons. They recreate the ritual, which involves a [[running the gauntlet|gauntlet]] of Klingon warriors brandishing pain sticks, on the [[holodeck]] as a surprise for Worf.  While reciting vows of honor, Worf undergoes jolts from the sticks with each step forward, enduring the extreme pain, and finally reaches the end, where he is grateful to his \"family\" aboard the ship for honoring him in this way.\n\n==Notes==\n''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' co-host [[John Tesh]] plays a holographic Klingon in the ritual scene, having enthusiastically volunteered for the part while covering the filming of this episode for his show.\n\n[[Anbo-Jitsu]], the fictitious sport shown in this episode, involves fighting with staffs while blindfolded. In Japanese, \"An\" means dark (i.e. blindfolded), \"[[B\u014d|Bo]]\" means staff, and \"Jitsu\" means technique or skill. The banners around the arena are written in Japanese and make reference to various Japanese characters and shows.\n\n== Reception ==\nThis episode was noted for the tensions between Commander Riker and his dad, which culminates in a round of Anbo-jitsu, a fictional martial arts form from the Star Trek future.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tor.com/2011/09/29/star-trek-the-next-generation-qthe-icarus-factorq/|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Rewatch: \u201cThe Icarus Factor\u201d|last=DeCandido|first=Keith R.

[[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 5:48 states, \"Therefore you are to be perfect, as your heavenly [[God the Father|Father]] is perfect.\" [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 6:36 states, \"Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.\" In [[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 5, they are told by [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] to \"Be imitators of God, therefore, as dearly loved children\".

In Catholicism and Orthodoxy, it is integrally related to the concept of ''[[Divinization (Christian)|Divinization/Theosis]]''.\n\nThe general understanding is that a person can become more similar to God over time, a process called ''theosis'' in Greek. This doctrine derives from the biblical mandate to be holy as God is Holy (Lev 20.26). It can be achieved by purification (''[[Catharsis|katharsis]]'') and [[Light (theology)|illumination]] (''[[theoria]]''), the highest point in illumination is the [[Divinization (Christian)|union with God]]. The best imitation of God is not only the man's effort, but it is mainly achieved by the [[Divine grace|grace]] of God. Nevertheless, Eastern Orthodox theology does not usually understand this tri-partite ascent as an attempt to become like God, but as a way to unite with the one God. For most Orthodox theologians imitatio Dei is not the way to salvation, if it is understood as an individual, personal attempt to become god-like.\n\nIn Roman Catholicism the same concepts have been treated under different names (''Via purgativa'', ''via iluminativa'' and ''via unitiva'') by St. [[John of the Cross]] and St. [[Theresa of Avila]]. ''Via purgativa'' is the Roman Catholic equivalent to ''katharsis'', and ''theoria'' is subdivided between illumination and full mystical union.

In this episode, the ''Enterprise'' ferries a deaf ambassador ([[Howie Seago]]) who leads difficult peace talks.\n\n==Plot==\nThe [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] [[starship]] ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|Enterprise]]'', commanded by Captain [[Jean-Luc Picard]] ([[Patrick Stewart]]), is set to take aboard Riva ([[Howie Seago]]), a renowned and successful negotiator, to help resolve a centuries-old war between two tribes on planet Solais V.  Riva is deaf and mute due to a hereditary genetic deficiency, but travels with a \"chorus\" ([[Marnie Mosiman]], [[Randy Oglesby|Thomas Oglesby]], and Leo Damian), an entourage of three people in [[telepathic]] communication with him, who are able to enunciate his thoughts. Riva dismisses the ''Enterprise'' crew's briefing on the history of the conflict, explaining that the dispute has long since become personal, regardless of whatever tangible concerns that may have started it. When Riva, his chorus, and several ''Enterprise'' officers beam down for the meeting, one tribal delegate fires upon them, killing the chorus. The tribe's leader immediately brands him a traitor and executes him, begging for the talks to continue, but the away team has already begun emergency transport back to the ''Enterprise'' amid the chaos.\n\nRiva, frustrated and agitated, struggles to communicate with the crew, so Picard orders [[Data (Star Trek)|Commander Data]] ([[Brent Spiner]]) to find and learn Riva's [[sign language]] in order to act as a translator. Picard offers to take Riva's place at the mediation, but Riva believes the Solaian tribes will only cooperate with him. Riva is prepared to abandon the peace process and return to his home planet, accepting his failure, but [[Deanna Troi|Counselor Troi]] ([[Marina Sirtis]]) inspires him to stay, suggesting that he turn his disadvantage into an advantage, recalling Riva's own negotiating tactic.\n\nRiva returns to the meeting spot on the planet, and to the crew's surprise, tells them that they should leave, and he will signal [[Starfleet]] when the negotiations are complete, as they may take several months. In order for the tribes to work with Riva, they will both be forced to learn sign language from Riva, which will create a shared experience between them. Thus, Riva is turning his disadvantage of being unable to communicate into an advantage. The crew leaves Riva to await the tribe representatives.\n\n==Production==\nHowie Seago, who is deaf, approached the show's producers with the idea of a deaf mediator.  The initial idea came from his wife, who is a fan of ''Star Trek''.  The writers originally wanted Seago's character to learn to speak after his chorus is killed, but Seago was opposed to the idea, as it could perpetuate the practice of forcing deaf children to speak.  The producers were understanding of his concerns and wrote a new draft.<ref>{{cite  news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-01-12/entertainment/ca-330_1_star-trek|title=Stepping Aboard the Starship 'Enterprise'|last=Farley|first=Ellen|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 12, 1989|accessdate=January 8, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nZack Handlen of [[The A.V.
