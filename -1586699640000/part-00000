The [[deputies]] of the Presidium were appointed for the duration of the term of office of the Supreme Soviet. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the [[USSR]] consisted of a [[chairman]], a first vice-chairman (since 1977), his 15 deputies (one from each [[Republics of the Soviet Union|republic]]), a secretary, and 20 members. The Presidium was accountable to the Supreme Soviet of the USSR for all its activities.\n\nFrom 1936 to 1989, the chairman of the Presidium was reckoned as the Soviet Union's ''de jure'' head of state, and was sometimes referred to as the \"president of the Soviet Union\" in non-Soviet sources.\n\n==Constitutional powers==\n===At inception===\nAccording to the 1936 [[Constitution of the USSR]], as in force as enacted originally (and thus, at the establishment of the Presidium), the basic powers of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR were:\n\n*[[promulgation]] of [[decree]]s;\n*[[Judicial interpretation|interpretation]] of current Soviet [[law]]s;\n*dissolution of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR on the basis of Article 47 of the 1936 Constitution of the USSR and scheduling new [[elections]]: implementing a national [[referendum]] on its own initiative or at the request of one of the republics of the Union;\n*[[Wiktionary:abrogation|abrogation]] of decrees, issued by the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers]] and Council of Ministers of the republics of the Union in case there is a discrepancy with the law;\n*relieving the [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Premier]] of the Council of Ministers of his job and appointing Ministers of the USSR (between sessions of the Supreme Soviet) with the subsequent submittal for the Supreme Soviet\u2019s approval;\n*establishment of [[Order (decoration)|order]]s and [[medal]]s of the USSR and implementing the awarding procedures;\n*establishment of honorary [[title]]s of the USSR and their assignment;\n*realization of the right to [[pardon]];\n*appointment and dismissal of the executive command of the [[Soviet Armed Forces]];\n*establishment of [[military rank|military]] and [[diplomatic rank]]s and other special ranks;\n*declaration of the general and partial [[mobilization]];\n*[[declaration of war]] in case of an attack on the USSR or in case when it was necessary to implement [[obligation]]s of international mutual defense treaties;\n*[[ratification]] and [[denunciation]] of international treaties, signed by the USSR;\n*representation of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR (between its sessions) in its relations with [[parliament]]s of foreign countries;\n*appointment and dismissal of Soviet [[Plenipotentiary|plenipotentiaries]] in foreign countries;\n*receiving of [[Letters of Credence]] and [[Letters of Recall]] from foreign diplomatic representatives, accredited in the USSR;\n*declaration of the [[martial law]] in a given region or across the USSR in the interest of defending the USSR or preserving public order and state security.\n\nThe presidium also dealt with questions regarding the acquisition of the Soviet [[citizenship]], its forfeiting or voluntary rejection.\n\n===At abolition===\nAccording to the 1977 [[Constitution of the USSR]], as in force at the union's dissolution (and thus, at the abolition of the Presidium), the basic powers of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR were:\n\n* organization of the work of the Supreme Soviet;\n* preparation of meetings of the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]] and sessions of the Supreme Soviet;\n* coordination of the work of the committees of the Supreme Soviet;\n* organization of nationwide discussion of legislative bills and \"other very important matters of state\".\n\nBy then, most of the Presidium's former powers were reassigned to the whole Supreme Soviet and to the [[President of the USSR]].\n\n== See also

That was also the year that Mohammed Siad Barre, a Somali army commander, seized power in a military coup. Hirsi Magan was descended from the traditional rulers of the [[Darod]], Somalia's second biggest clan. Siad Barre, who hailed from a lesser Darod family, feared and resented Ms Hirsi Ali's father's family, she says. In 1972, Siad Barre had Hirsi Magan put in prison from which he escaped three years later and fled the country.\"</ref> Hirsi Ali's father had studied abroad and was opposed to [[female genital mutilation]], but while he was imprisoned, Hirsi Ali's grandmother had a man perform the procedure on her, when Hirsi Ali was five years old. According to Hirsi Ali, she was fortunate that her grandmother could not find a woman to do the procedure, as the mutilation was \"much milder\" when performed by men.<ref name=\"dangerwoman\" />\n\nAfter her father escaped from prison, he and the family left Somalia in 1977, going to [[Saudi Arabia]] and then to [[Ethiopia]], before settling in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]] by 1980. There he established a comfortable upper-class life for them. Hirsi Ali attended the English-language Muslim Girls' Secondary School. By the time she reached her teens, Saudi Arabia was funding religious education in numerous countries and its religious views were becoming influential among many Muslims. A charismatic religious teacher, trained under this aegis, joined Hirsi Ali's school. She inspired the teenaged Ayaan, as well as some fellow students, to adopt the more rigorous Saudi Arabian interpretations of Islam, as opposed to the more relaxed versions then current in Somalia and Kenya. Hirsi Ali said later that she had long been impressed by the [[Qur'an]] and had lived \"by the Book, for the Book\" throughout her childhood.<ref name=\"smh.com.au\">[https://www.smh.com.au/news/opinion/to-submit-to-the-book-is-to-exist-in-their-hell/2007/06/03/1180809336515.html \"To submit to the Book is to submit to their Hell\"], extract of speech in ''[[Sydney Morning Herald]],'' 4 June 2007.</ref>\n\nShe sympathised with the views of the [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Muslim Brotherhood]], and wore a ''[[hijab]]'' with her school uniform.

One never knows what happens behind the scenes, but that is how it appears to the visitor. The many women in the army are also very visible.\n\n\"I understood that a crucial element of success is the unifying factor among immigrants to Israel.

Their side is dilapidated, for which they blame the Israelis. In private, however, I met a young Palestinian who spoke excellent English. There were no cameras and no notebooks.

It holds Israel to exceptionally high moral standards. The Israelis, however, will always do well, because they themselves set high standards for their actions. The standards for judging the Palestinians, however, are very low. Most outsiders remain silent on all the problems in their territories. That helps the Palestinians become even more corrupt than they already are.

That was also the year that Mohammed Siad Barre, a Somali army commander, seized power in a military coup. Hirsi Magan was descended from the traditional rulers of the [[Darod]], Somalia's second biggest clan.

By the time she reached her teens, Saudi Arabia was funding religious education in numerous countries and its religious views were becoming influential among many Muslims. A charismatic religious teacher, trained under this aegis, joined Hirsi Ali's school. She inspired the teenaged Ayaan, as well as some fellow students, to adopt the more rigorous Saudi Arabian interpretations of Islam, as opposed to the more relaxed versions then current in Somalia and Kenya.

The investigation found that Hirsi Ali had not legitimately received Dutch citizenship, because she had lied about her name and date of birth. However, later inquiries established that she was entitled to use the name Ali because it was her grandfather's name.  Verdonk moved to annul Hirsi Ali's citizenship, an action later overridden at the urging of Parliament.<ref>The controversy over Hirsi Ali's citizenship followed a debate over the deportation of a Bosnian teenager [[Taida Pasi\u0107]], who had lied on her visa application in order to return to the Netherlands to complete high school. According to her memoir, Hirsi Ali claims to have spoken up for Pasic in a private conversation with Verdonk and to have told the minister at the time that she had also lied in her own application.

She also restated her claim of seeking asylum to prevent a forced marriage, stating: \"How often do people who are seeking refuge provide different names? The penalty of stripping me of my Dutch citizenship is disproportional.\" Her stated reason for resigning immediately was the increasing media attention. Owing to the fact that a Dutch court had ruled in April 2006 that she had to leave her house by August 2006, she decided to relocate to the United States in September 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nu.nl/algemeen/733549/hirsi-ali-licht-vertrek-toe-video.html|title=Hirsi Ali licht vertrek toe (video) - NU - Het laatste nieuws het eerst op NU.nl|website=nu.nl}}</ref>\n\nAfter a long and emotional debate in the Dutch Parliament, all major parties supported a [[motion (democracy)|motion]] requesting the Minister to explore the possibility of special circumstances in Hirsi Ali's case.

During the debate, she said that Hirsi Ali still had Dutch citizenship during the period of reexamination. Apparently the \"decision\" she had announced had represented the current position of the Dutch government.

To avoid this situation, she proposes three general principles for a new policy:\n* Admission of immigrants on the basis of their contribution to the economy. The current system \"is designed to attract the highest number of people with truly heartbreaking stories\".\n* Diplomatic, economic and military interventions in countries that cause large migrant flows.\n* Introduction of [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]] programs that acknowledge that \"the basic tenets of Islam are a major obstacle to [[Social integration|integration]]\".\n\nRegarding unemployment, social marginalization and poverty among certain immigrant communities, Hirsi Ali places the burden of responsibility squarely on Islam and migrant culture.<ref name=\"Grewal\">{{cite journal|last1=Grewal|first1=Kiran|title=RECLAIMING THE VOICE OF THE 'THIRD WORLD WOMAN'|journal=Interventions|date=December 2012|volume=14|issue=4|pages=569\u2013590|doi=10.1080/1369801X.2012.730861}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, she opposed the idea of preventing immigrants from traditional Muslim societies from immigrating, claiming that allowing them to immigrate made the U.S. a \"highly moral country.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=126909914|title='Nomad' Ayaan Hirsi Ali On Reclaiming Islam|date=18 May 2010|work=NPR.org|accessdate=22 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nAlso see her 2017 Hoover Institution Press publication \"The Challenge of Dawa, Political Islam as Ideology and Movement and How to Counter It.\n\n===Native Americans===\n\"When I speak of assimilation\",  Ali clarifies, \"I mean assimilation into civilization.

One never knows what happens behind the scenes, but that is how it appears to the visitor. The many women in the army are also very visible.\n\n\"I understood that a crucial element of success is the unifying factor among immigrants to Israel.

Their side is dilapidated, for which they blame the Israelis. In private, however, I met a young Palestinian who spoke excellent English. There were no cameras and no notebooks.

It holds Israel to exceptionally high moral standards. The Israelis, however, will always do well, because they themselves set high standards for their actions. The standards for judging the Palestinians, however, are very low. Most outsiders remain silent on all the problems in their territories.

For a century and a half following the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, Normandy and England were linked by Norman and [[Franks|Frankish]] rulers.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Normandy}}\n[[File:TheatreLillebonne.jpg|thumb|[[Roman theatre (structure)|Roman theatre]] in [[Lillebonne]]]]\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene23 Harold sacramentum fecit Willelmo duci.jpg|thumb|[[Bayeux Tapestry]] (Scene 23): [[Harold Godwinson|Harold II]] swearing oath on holy relics to [[William the Conqueror]]]]\nArchaeological finds, such as [[cave painting]]s, prove that humans were present in the region in [[prehistoric times]].\n\n[[Celts]] (also known as [[Belgae]] and [[Gauls]]) invaded Normandy in successive waves from the 4th to the 3rd century BC. When [[Julius Caesar]] invaded Gaul, there were nine different Celtic tribes living in Normandy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/ridel/histnorm/Gaulois1.htm |title=C\u00e9sar et les Gaulois |publisher=pagesperso-orange.fr |language=fr}}</ref> The [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanisation]] of Normandy was achieved by the usual methods: [[Roman roads]] and a policy of urbanisation. [[Classicist]]s have knowledge of many [[Gallo-Roman]] [[villa]]s in Normandy.\n\nIn the late 3rd century, barbarian raids devastated Normandy. Coastal settlements were raided by [[Saxons|Saxon]] pirates. Christianity also began to enter the area during this period. In 406, [[Germanic tribes]] began invading from the east, while the Saxons subjugated the Norman coast. As early as 487, the area between the [[River Somme]] and the River [[Loire]] came under the control of the [[Franks|Frankish]] lord [[Clovis I|Clovis]].\n\n[[Vikings]] started to raid the [[Seine]] valley during the middle of the 9th century. As early as 841, a Viking fleet appeared at the mouth of the Seine, the principal route by which they entered the kingdom.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Neveux|first1=Francois|title=The Normans: The conquests that changed the face of Europe|isbn=978-0-7624-3371-1|pages=48}}</ref> After attacking and destroying monasteries, including one at [[Jumi\u00e8ges]], they took advantage of the power vacuum created by the disintegration of [[Charlemagne]]'s empire to take northern France. The [[Duchy of Normandy|fiefdom of Normandy]] was created for the Viking leader Hr\u00f3lfr Ragnvaldsson, or Rollo (also known as Robert of Normandy). Rollo had [[Siege of Paris (885\u2013886)|besieged Paris]] but in 911 entered [[vassal]]age to the king of the [[Western Francia|West Franks]], [[Charles the Simple]], through the [[Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte]]. In exchange for his [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and [[fealty]], Rollo legally gained the territory which he and his Viking allies had previously conquered. The name \"Normandy\" reflects Rollo's Viking (i.e. \"[[Norsemen|Norseman]]\") origins. To this day, in Norwegian, the word ''nordmann'' (pron. Norman) denotes a Norwegian person.\n\nThe descendants of Rollo and his followers adopted the local [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance language]] and intermarried with the area's native Gallo-Roman inhabitants. They became the [[Normans]] \u2013 a [[Norman language|Norman French]]-speaking mixture of [[Norsemen]] and indigenous [[Franks]], [[Celts]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].\n\nRollo's descendant [[William the Conqueror|William]] became king of England in 1066 after defeating [[Harold Godwinson]], the last of the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon kings]], at the [[Battle of Hastings]], while retaining the [[fiefdom]] of Normandy for himself and his descendants.\n\n===Norman expansion===\n[[File:Normans possessions 12century-fr.png|thumb|Norman possessions in the 12th century]]\nBesides the [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]] and the subsequent invasions of [[Cambro-Norman|Wales]] and [[Norman Ireland|Ireland]], the Normans expanded into other areas. Norman families, such as that of [[Tancred of Hauteville]], [[Rainulf Drengot]] and [[Guimond de Moulins]] played important parts in the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|conquest of southern Italy]] and the [[Crusades]].\n\nThe [[Drengot family|Drengot]] lineage, de Hauteville's sons [[William Iron Arm]], [[Drogo of Hauteville|Drogo]], and [[Humphrey of Hauteville|Humphrey]], [[Robert Guiscard]] and [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger the Great Count]] progressively claimed territories in southern Italy until founding the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] in 1130. They also carved out a place for themselves and their descendants in the [[Crusader states]] of [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Holy Land]].\n\nThe 14th-century explorer [[Jean de B\u00e9thencourt]] established a [[Kingdom of the Canary Islands|kingdom]] in the [[Canary Islands]] in 1404. He received the title King of the Canary Islands from Pope [[Pope Innocent VII|Innocent VII]] but recognized [[Henry III of Castile]] as his overlord, who had provided him aid during the conquest.\n\n===13th to 17th centuries===\n[[File:Joan of arc burning at stake.jpg|thumb|[[Joan of Arc]] burning at the stake in the city of [[Rouen]], painting by [[Jules Eug\u00e8ne Lenepveu]]]]\nIn 1204, during the reign of [[John, King of England| John of England]], mainland Normandy was taken from England by France under King [[Philip II of France|Philip II]]. Insular Normandy (the Channel Islands) remained however under English control. In 1259, [[Henry III of England]] recognized the legality of French possession of mainland Normandy under the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]]. His successors, however, often fought to regain control of their ancient fiefdom.\n\nThe ''Charte aux Normands'' granted by [[Louis X of France]] in 1315 (and later re-confirmed in 1339) \u2013 like the analogous [[Magna Carta]] granted in England in the aftermath of 1204 \u2013 guaranteed the liberties and privileges of the province of Normandy.\n\nFrench Normandy was occupied by English forces during the [[Hundred Years' War]] in 1345\u20131360 and again in 1415\u20131450. Normandy lost three-quarters of its population during the war.<ref>{{cite book| author = Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie| title = The French Peasantry: 1450-1660| url = https://archive.org/details/frenchpeasantry10000lero| url-access = registration| year = 1987| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 978-0-520-05523-0| page = [https://archive.org/details/frenchpeasantry10000lero/page/32 32] }}</ref> Afterward prosperity returned to Normandy until the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. When many Norman towns ([[Alen\u00e7on]], [[Rouen]], [[Caen]], [[Coutances]], [[Bayeux]]) joined the [[Protestant Reformation]], battles ensued throughout the province. In the Channel Islands, a period of [[Calvinism]] following the Reformation was suppressed when [[Anglicanism]] was imposed following the [[English Civil War]].\n\n[[Samuel de Champlain]] left the port of [[Honfleur]] in 1604 and founded [[Acadia]]. Four years later, he founded [[Quebec City|Qu\u00e9bec City]]. From then onwards, Normans engaged in a policy of expansion in North America. They continued the exploration of the [[New World]]: [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier de La Salle]] travelled in the area of the [[Great Lakes]], then on the [[Mississippi River]]. [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] and his brother [[Lemoyne de Bienville]] founded [[Louisiana]], [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] and [[New Orleans]]. Territories located between [[Quebec|Qu\u00e9bec]] and the [[Mississippi Delta]] were opened up to establish [[Canada (New France)|Canada]] and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. Colonists from Normandy were among the most active in [[New France]], comprising [[Acadia]], [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]].\n\n[[Honfleur]] and [[Le Havre]] were two of the principal [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] ports of France.\n\n===Modern history===\nAlthough agriculture remained important, industries such as weaving, metallurgy, sugar refining, ceramics, and shipbuilding were introduced and developed.\n\nIn the 1780s, the economic crisis and the crisis of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'' struck Normandy as well as other parts of the nation, leading to the [[French Revolution]]. Bad harvests, technical progress and the effects of the [[Eden Agreement]] signed in 1786 affected employment and the economy of the province. Normans laboured under a heavy fiscal burden.\n\nIn 1790 the five departments of Normandy replaced the former province.\n\n13 July 1793, the Norman [[Charlotte Corday]] assassinated [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]].\n\nThe Normans reacted little to the many political upheavals which characterized the 19th century. Overall they warily accepted the changes of r\u00e9gime ([[First French Empire]], [[Bourbon Restoration]], [[July Monarchy]], [[French Second Republic]], [[Second French Empire]], [[French Third Republic]]).\n\nThere was an economic revival (mechanization of textile manufacture, first trains...) after the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1792\u20131815).\n\nAnd new economic activity stimulated the coasts: seaside tourism. The 19th century marks the birth of the first beach resorts.\n\n[[File:NormandySupply edit.jpg|thumb|right|Allied invasion of Normandy, [[D-Day]], 1944]]\nDuring the Second World War, following the [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|armistice of 22 June 1940]], continental Normandy was part of the [[Military Administration in France (Nazi Germany)|German occupied zone of France]]. The Channel Islands were [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|occupied by German forces]] between 30 June 1940 and 9 May 1945. The town of [[Dieppe]] was the site of the unsuccessful [[Dieppe Raid]] by Canadian and British armed forces.\n\n[[Allies of World War II|The Allies]], in this case involving Britain, the United States, Canada and [[Free France]], coordinated a massive build-up of troops and supplies to support a large-scale invasion of Normandy in the [[D-Day landings]] on 6 June 1944 under the code name [[Operation Overlord]]. The Germans were dug into fortified emplacements above the beaches. [[Caen]], [[Cherbourg]], [[Carentan]], [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]] and other Norman towns endured many casualties in the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]], which continued until the closing of the so-called [[Falaise pocket|Falaise gap]] between [[Chambois, Orne|Chambois]] and [[Mont Ormel]]. The liberation of [[Le Havre]] followed. This was a significant turning point in the war and led to the restoration of the French Republic.\n\nThe remainder of Normandy was liberated only on 9 May 1945 at the end of the war, when the [[Liberation of the German-occupied Channel Islands|Channel Island occupation]] effectively ended.\n\nBetween 1956 and 2015 Normandy was divided into two [[Regions of France|administrative regions]]: [[Lower Normandy]] and [[Upper Normandy]]; the regions were merged into one single region on 1 January 2016. [[Upper Normandy]] (''Haute-Normandie'') consisted of the French ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|departments]]'' of [[Seine-Maritime]] and [[Eure]], and [[Lower Normandy]] (''Basse-Normandie'') of the ''[[D\u00e9partement in France|departments]]'' of [[Orne]], [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], and [[Manche]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Mont_Saint_Michel_bordercropped.jpg|thumb|The medieval island of [[Mont-Saint-Michel]], the most visited monument in Normandy]]\n[[File:Falaises Etretat 2012.jpg|thumb|The ''Arche'' and the ''Aiguille'' of the cliffs of [[\u00c9tretat]]]]\n[[File:Jonquerets-de-Livret- batiment du Pressoir.JPG|thumb|A typical Norman [[Thatching|thatched]] building.

The historic three-leopard version (known in the Norman language as ''les treis cats'', \"the three cats\") is used by some associations and individuals, especially those who support reunification of the regions and cultural links with the Channel Islands and England. Jersey and Guernsey use three leopards in their national symbols. The three leopards represents the strength and courage Normandy has towards the neighbouring provinces.\n\nThe unofficial anthem of the region is the song \"[[Ma Normandie]]\".\n\n<gallery heights=\"120\" widths=\"120\" class=\"center bordered-images\">\nFile:Basse-Normandie flag.svg|\"Two-leopard\" version, which is the main one.\nFile:Haute-Normandie flag.svg|\"Three-leopard\" version\nFile:Normandy flag large.png|[[Nordic Cross flag|Nordic Cross]] version\nFile:Pavillon navale Normand.png|Flag used by the sailors of Normandy.\nFile:Falaise.png|Flag used by the hometown of [[William the Conqueror]].\nFile:Flag of Sark.svg|\"Two-leopard\" flag of [[Sark]]\nFile:Arms of William the Conqueror (1066-1087).svg|Coat of arms of the [[Duchy of Normandy]]\nFile:Coat of arms of Guernsey.svg|[[Coat of arms of Guernsey]]\nFile:Jersey arms on Piquet House in St Helier.jpg|[[Coat of arms of Jersey]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Norman language}}\nThe Norman language, a [[languages of France|regional language]], is spoken by a minority of the population on the continent and the islands, with a concentration in the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] in the far west (the [[Cotentinais]] dialect), and in the [[Pays de Caux]] in the East (the [[Cauchois dialect]]). Many place names demonstrate the [[Old Norse language|Norse]] influence in this [[O\u00efl languages|O\u00efl language]]; for example ''-bec'' (stream), ''-fleur'' (river), ''[[-hou]]'' (island), ''-tot'' (homestead), ''-dal'' or ''-dalle'' (valley) and ''-hogue'' (hill, mound).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viking.no/e/france/contribution.html|title=The Vikings in Normandy: The Scandinavian contribution in Normandy|publisher=}}</ref> French is the only [[official language]] in continental Normandy and English is also an official language in the Channel Islands.\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Dauville Hotel Normandie.jpg|thumb|A Norman style construction in [[Deauville]]]]\n{{Main|Architecture of Normandy}}\n\nArchitecturally, Norman cathedrals, abbeys (such as the [[Abbey of Bec]]) and castles characterise the former duchy in a way that mirrors the similar pattern of [[Norman architecture]] in England following the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066.\n\nDomestic architecture in upper Normandy is typified by [[Half-timbered construction|half-timbered]] buildings that also recall vernacular English architecture, although the farm enclosures of the more harshly landscaped Pays de Caux are a more idiosyncratic response to socio-economic and climatic imperatives. Much urban architectural heritage was destroyed during the Battle of Normandy in 1944 \u2013 post-war urban reconstruction, such as in Le Havre and Saint-L\u00f4, could be said to demonstrate both the virtues and vices of [[Modernism|modernist]] and [[Brutalism|brutalist]] trends of the 1950s and 1960s. Le Havre, the city rebuilt by [[Auguste Perret]], was added to Unesco's World Heritage List in 2005.\n\n[[Vernacular architecture]] in lower Normandy takes its form from [[granite]], the predominant local building material. The Channel Islands also share this influence \u2013 [[Chausey]] was for many years a source of quarried granite, including that used for the construction of [[Mont Saint-Michel]].\n\nThe south part of [[Bagnoles-de-l'Orne]] is filled with bourgeois villas in ''[[Belle \u00c9poque]]'' style with polychrome fa\u00e7ades, bow windows and unique roofing. This area, built between 1886 and 1914, has an authentic \u201cBagnolese\u201d style and is typical of high-society country vacation of the time. The Chapel of Saint Germanus (''Chapelle Saint-Germain'') at [[Querqueville]] with its [[trefoil]] floorplan incorporates elements of one of the earliest surviving places of Christian worship in the Cotentin \u2013 perhaps second only to the Gallo-Roman baptistry at [[Port-Bail]]. It is dedicated to [[Germanus of Normandy]].\n\n===Gastronomy===\n[[File:Vachesnormandes.jpg|thumb|[[Normande Cattle|Normande cow]]</center>]]\nParts of Normandy consist of rolling countryside typified by pasture for dairy cattle and apple orchards. A wide range of dairy products are produced and exported. Norman cheeses include [[Camembert (cheese)|Camembert]], [[Livarot cheese|Livarot]], [[Pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque cheese|Pont l'\u00c9v\u00eaque]], [[Brillat-Savarin cheese|Brillat-Savarin]], [[Neufch\u00e2tel (cheese)|Neufch\u00e2tel]], [[Petit suisse (cheese)|Petit Suisse]] and [[Boursin (cheese)|Boursin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fromages.org/fdn/fdn_histoire_en.html |title=Norman cheeses: History |publisher=fromages.org}}</ref> Normandy butter and Normandy cream are lavishly used in gastronomic specialties.\n[[File:Reflets de France Cidre.jpg|thumb|[[Cider]] from Normandy</center>]]\nTurbot and oysters from the Cotentin Peninsula are major delicacies throughout France. Normandy is the chief [[oyster]]-cultivating, scallop-exporting, and mussel-raising region in France.\n\nNormandy is a major [[cider]]-producing region (very little wine is produced). [[Perry]] is also produced, but in less significant quantities. Apple brandy, of which the most famous variety is [[calvados (spirit)|calvados]], is also popular. The mealtime ''trou normand'', or \"Norman hole\", is a pause between meal courses in which diners partake of a glassful of calvados in order to improve the appetite and make room for the next course, and this is still observed in many homes and restaurants. ''[[Pommeau]]'' is an ''[[ap\u00e9ritif]]'' produced by blending unfermented cider and apple brandy. Another aperitif is the ''[[Kir (cocktail)|kir]] normand'', a measure of [[cr\u00e8me de cassis]] topped up with cider. ''[[B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine]]'' is produced in [[F\u00e9camp]].\n\nOther regional specialities include ''[[tripes \u00e0 la mode de Caen]]'', ''[[andouille]]s'' and ''andouillettes'', [[salade cauchoise]], salt meadow (''pr\u00e9 sal\u00e9'') lamb, seafood (mussels, [[scallop]]s, lobsters, mackerel...), and ''[[teurgoule]]'' (spiced rice pudding).\n\nNormandy dishes include duckling ''\u00e0 la rouennaise'', saut\u00e9ed chicken ''yvetois'', and goose ''en daube''. Rabbit is cooked with [[morel]]s, or ''\u00e0 la havraise'' (stuffed with truffled pigs' trotters). Other dishes are sheep's trotters ''\u00e0 la rouennaise'', casseroled veal, larded calf's liver braised with carrots, and veal (or turkey) in cream and mushrooms.\n\nNormandy is also noted for its pastries. Normandy turns out ''douillons'' (pears baked in pastry), ''craquelins'', ''roulettes'' in Rouen, ''fouaces'' in Caen, ''fallues'' in [[Lisieux]], ''sabl\u00e9s'' in Lisieux.  It is the birthplace of [[brioche]]s (especially those from [[\u00c9vreux]] and [[Gisors]]). Confectionery of the region includes [[Rouen]] apple sugar, Isigny caramels, [[Bayeux]] mint chews, Falaise berlingots, [[Le Havre]] marzipans, [[Argentan]] ''croquettes'', and Rouen [[macaroons]].\n\nNormandy is the native land of [[Taillevent]], cook of the kings of France [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] and [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]]. He wrote the earliest French cookery book named ''Le Viandier''. ''[[Confiture de lait]]'' was also made in Normandy around the 14th century.\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:Wace illustration Roman de Rou 1824.jpg|thumb|[[Wace]] presents his ''[[Roman de Rou]]'' to Henry II, Illustration 1824]]\n{{See also|Anglo-Norman literature|Gesta Normannorum Ducum}}\nThe dukes of Normandy commissioned and inspired epic literature to record and legitimise their rule. [[Wace]], [[Orderic Vitalis]] and [[Stephen of Rouen]] were among those who wrote in the service of the dukes. After the division of 1204, French literature provided the model for the development of literature in Normandy. [[Olivier Basselin]] wrote of the Vaux de Vire, the origin of literary ''[[vaudeville]]''. Notable Norman writers include [[Jean Marot]], [[R\u00e9my Belleau]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Octave Mirbeau]], and [[Remy de Gourmont]], and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]. The Corneille brothers, [[Pierre Corneille|Pierre]] and [[Thomas Corneille|Thomas]], born in Rouen, were great figures of French classical literature.\n\nDavid Ferrand (1591\u20131660) in his ''Muse Normande'' established a landmark of Norman language literature. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the workers and merchants of [[Rouen]] established a tradition of polemical and satirical literature in a form of language called the ''parler purin''. At the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century a new movement arose in the Channel Islands, led by writers such as [[George M\u00e9tivier]], which sparked a literary renaissance on the Norman mainland. In exile in Jersey and then Guernsey, [[Victor Hugo]] took an interest in the vernacular literature. ''[[Les Travailleurs de la mer]]'' is a well-known novel by Hugo set in the Channel Islands. The boom in insular literature in the early 19th century encouraged production especially in La Hague and around Cherbourg, where Alfred Rossel, Louis Beuve and [[C\u00f4tis-Capel]] became active. The typical medium for literary expression in Norman has traditionally been newspaper columns and almanacs. The novel ''Zabeth'' by Andr\u00e9 Louis which appeared in 1969 was the first novel published in Norman.\n\n===Painting===\n[[File:Claude Monet - Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son]]'', 1875]]\n\nNormandy has a rich tradition of painting and gave to France some of its most important artists.\n\nIn the 17th century some major French painters were Normans like [[Nicolas Poussin]], born in [[Les Andelys]] and [[Jean Jouvenet]].\n\n[[Romanticism]] drew painters to the Channel coasts of Normandy. [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] crossed the Channel from Great Britain, attracted by the light and landscapes. [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]], a native of Rouen, was a notable figure in the Romantic movement, its famous ''[[Le Radeau de la M\u00e9duse|Radeau de la M\u00e9duse]]'' being considered come the breakthrough of pictorial romanticism in France when it was officially presented at the 1819 Salon. The competing Realist tendency was represented by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]], a native of La Hague. The landscape painter [[Eug\u00e8ne Boudin]], born in Honfleur, was a determining influence on the impressionnists and was highly considered by Monet.\n\n[[File:Robert Antoine Pinchon, Un apr\u00e8s-midi \u00e0 l'Ile aux Cerises, Rouen, oil on canvas, 50 x 61.2 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Antoine Pinchon]], ''Un apr\u00e8s-midi \u00e0 l'Ile aux Cerises, Rouen'', oil on canvas, 50 x 61.2 cm]]\nBreaking away from the more formalised and classical themes of the early part of the 19th century, Impressionist painters preferred to paint outdoors, in natural light, and to concentrate on landscapes, towns and scenes of daily life.\n\nLeader of the movement and father of modern painting, [[Claude Monet]] is one of the best known Impressionists and a major character in Normandy's artistic heritage. His [[Fondation Monet in Giverny|house and gardens]] at [[Giverny]] are one of the region's major tourist sites, much visited for their beauty and their water lilies, as well as for their importance to Monet's artistic inspiration. Normandy was at the heart of his creation, from the paintings of Rouen's cathedral to the famous depictions of the cliffs at [[Etretat]], the beach and port at [[F\u00e9camp]] and the sunrise at [[Le Havre]]. It was ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'', Monet's painting of Le Havre, that led to the movement being dubbed [[Impressionism]]. After Monet, all the main [[avant-garde]] painters of the 1870s and 1880s came to Normandy to paint its landscapes and its changing lights, concentrating along the Seine valley and the Norman coast.\n\nLandscapes and scenes of daily life were also immortalised on canvas by artists such as [[William Turner (artist)|William Turner]], [[Gustave Courbet]], the Honfleur born Eug\u00e8ne Boudin, [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Auguste Renoir]], [[Gustave Caillebotte]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Signac]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. While Monet's work adorns galleries and collections all over the world, a remarkable quantity of Impressionist works can be found in galleries throughout Normandy, such as the [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Rouen|Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Rouen]], the Mus\u00e9e Eug\u00e8ne Boudin in [[Honfleur]] or the [[Mus\u00e9e Malraux|Andr\u00e9 Malraux Museum]] in [[Le Havre]].\n\n[[Maurice Denis]], one of the leaders and theoricists of the [[Les Nabis|Nabis]] movement in the 1890s, was a native of Granville, in the Manche department.\n\nThe ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Normande de Peinture Moderne]]'' was founded in 1909 by [[Pierre Dumont (painter)|Pierre Dumont]], [[Robert Antoine Pinchon]], Yvonne Barbier and Eug\u00e8ne Tirvert. Among members were [[Raoul Dufy]], a native of Le Havre, [[Albert Marquet]], [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Maurice Utrillo]]. Also in this movement were the Duchamp brothers, [[Jacques Villon]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], considered one of the father of modern art, also natives of Normandy. [[Jean Dubuffet]], one of the leading French artist of the 1940s and the 1950s was born in Le Havre.\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Rouen Cathedral as seen from Gros Horloge 140215 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rouen Cathedral]]]]\n\nChristian missionaries implanted [[monastic communities]] in the territory in the 5th and 6th centuries. Some of these missionaries came from across the [[English Channel|Channel]]. The influence of [[Celtic Christianity]] can still be found in the [[Cotentin]]. By the terms of the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, Rollo, a Viking pagan, accepted Christianity and was baptised. The Duchy of Normandy was therefore formally a Christian state from its foundation. The [[cathedral]]s of Normandy have exerted influence down the centuries in matters of both faith and politics. [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] of England, did [[penance]] at the cathedral of [[Avranches Cathedral|Avranches]] on 21 May 1172 and was absolved from the censures incurred by the assassination of [[Thomas Becket]]. [[Mont Saint-Michel]] is a historic [[pilgrimage]] site.\n\nNormandy does not have one generally agreed [[patron saint]], although this title has been ascribed to Saint [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], and to [[Saint Ouen]]. Many saints have been revered in Normandy down the centuries, including:\n* [[St. Aubert|Aubert]] who's remembered as the founder of [[Mont Saint-Michel]]\n* [[Saint Marcouf|Marcouf]] and [[Laud of Coutances|Laud]] who are important saints in Normandy\n* [[Helier]] and [[Samson of Dol]] who are evangelizers of the Channel Islands\n* [[Thomas Becket]], an [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] whose parents were from Rouen, who was the object of a considerable cult in mainland Normandy following his martyrdom\n* [[Joan of Arc]] who was [[martyr]]ed in Rouen, and who is especially remembered in that city\n* [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Lisieux]] whose birthplace in [[Alen\u00e7on]] and later home in Lisieux are a focus for religious pilgrims.\n* [[Germanus of Normandy]]\n\nSince the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]] there is no established church in mainland Normandy. In the [[Channel Islands]], the [[Church of England]] is the [[established church]].\n\n===People===\n:''See [[:Category:People from Normandy]]''\n\n==Image gallery==\n<gallery

Its population of 3,322,757 accounts for around 5% of the population of France. The inhabitants of Normandy are known as [[Normans]],<ref name=\"Denonym\" /> and the region is the historic homeland of the [[Norman language]]. The neighboring regions are [[Hauts-de-France]] and [[\u00cele-de-France|Ile-de-France]] to the east, [[Centre-Val de Loire]] to the southeast, [[Pays de la Loire]] to the south, and [[Brittany]] to the southwest. The capital is [[Rouen]].\n\nThe historical region of Normandy comprised the present-day region of Normandy, as well as small areas now part of the departments of [[Mayenne]] and [[Sarthe]].

For a century and a half following the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, Normandy and England were linked by Norman and [[Franks|Frankish]] rulers.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Normandy}}\n[[File:TheatreLillebonne.jpg|thumb|[[Roman theatre (structure)|Roman theatre]] in [[Lillebonne]]]]\n[[File:Bayeux Tapestry scene23 Harold sacramentum fecit Willelmo duci.jpg|thumb|[[Bayeux Tapestry]] (Scene 23): [[Harold Godwinson|Harold II]] swearing oath on holy relics to [[William the Conqueror]]]]\nArchaeological finds, such as [[cave painting]]s, prove that humans were present in the region in [[prehistoric times]].\n\n[[Celts]] (also known as [[Belgae]] and [[Gauls]]) invaded Normandy in successive waves from the 4th to the 3rd century BC. When [[Julius Caesar]] invaded Gaul, there were nine different Celtic tribes living in Normandy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pagesperso-orange.fr/ridel/histnorm/Gaulois1.htm |title=C\u00e9sar et les Gaulois |publisher=pagesperso-orange.fr |language=fr}}</ref> The [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanisation]] of Normandy was achieved by the usual methods: [[Roman roads]] and a policy of urbanisation. [[Classicist]]s have knowledge of many [[Gallo-Roman]] [[villa]]s in Normandy.\n\nIn the late 3rd century, barbarian raids devastated Normandy. Coastal settlements were raided by [[Saxons|Saxon]] pirates. Christianity also began to enter the area during this period. In 406, [[Germanic tribes]] began invading from the east, while the Saxons subjugated the Norman coast. As early as 487, the area between the [[River Somme]] and the River [[Loire]] came under the control of the [[Franks|Frankish]] lord [[Clovis I|Clovis]].\n\n[[Vikings]] started to raid the [[Seine]] valley during the middle of the 9th century. As early as 841, a Viking fleet appeared at the mouth of the Seine, the principal route by which they entered the kingdom.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Neveux|first1=Francois|title=The Normans: The conquests that changed the face of Europe|isbn=978-0-7624-3371-1|pages=48}}</ref> After attacking and destroying monasteries, including one at [[Jumi\u00e8ges]], they took advantage of the power vacuum created by the disintegration of [[Charlemagne]]'s empire to take northern France. The [[Duchy of Normandy|fiefdom of Normandy]] was created for the Viking leader Hr\u00f3lfr Ragnvaldsson, or Rollo (also known as Robert of Normandy). Rollo had [[Siege of Paris (885\u2013886)|besieged Paris]] but in 911 entered [[vassal]]age to the king of the [[Western Francia|West Franks]], [[Charles the Simple]], through the [[Treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte]]. In exchange for his [[Homage (feudal)|homage]] and [[fealty]], Rollo legally gained the territory which he and his Viking allies had previously conquered. The name \"Normandy\" reflects Rollo's Viking (i.e. \"[[Norsemen|Norseman]]\") origins. To this day, in Norwegian, the word ''nordmann'' (pron. Norman) denotes a Norwegian person.\n\nThe descendants of Rollo and his followers adopted the local [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance language]] and intermarried with the area's native Gallo-Roman inhabitants. They became the [[Normans]] \u2013 a [[Norman language|Norman French]]-speaking mixture of [[Norsemen]] and indigenous [[Franks]], [[Celts]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].\n\nRollo's descendant [[William the Conqueror|William]] became king of England in 1066 after defeating [[Harold Godwinson]], the last of the [[History of Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon kings]], at the [[Battle of Hastings]], while retaining the [[fiefdom]] of Normandy for himself and his descendants.\n\n===Norman expansion===\n[[File:Normans possessions 12century-fr.png|thumb|Norman possessions in the 12th century]]\nBesides the [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]] and the subsequent invasions of [[Cambro-Norman|Wales]] and [[Norman Ireland|Ireland]], the Normans expanded into other areas. Norman families, such as that of [[Tancred of Hauteville]], [[Rainulf Drengot]] and [[Guimond de Moulins]] played important parts in the [[Norman conquest of southern Italy|conquest of southern Italy]] and the [[Crusades]].\n\nThe [[Drengot family|Drengot]] lineage, de Hauteville's sons [[William Iron Arm]], [[Drogo of Hauteville|Drogo]], and [[Humphrey of Hauteville|Humphrey]], [[Robert Guiscard]] and [[Roger I of Sicily|Roger the Great Count]] progressively claimed territories in southern Italy until founding the [[Kingdom of Sicily]] in 1130. They also carved out a place for themselves and their descendants in the [[Crusader states]] of [[Asia Minor]] and the [[Holy Land]].\n\nThe 14th-century explorer [[Jean de B\u00e9thencourt]] established a [[Kingdom of the Canary Islands|kingdom]] in the [[Canary Islands]] in 1404. He received the title King of the Canary Islands from Pope [[Pope Innocent VII|Innocent VII]] but recognized [[Henry III of Castile]] as his overlord, who had provided him aid during the conquest.\n\n===13th to 17th centuries===\n[[File:Joan of arc burning at stake.jpg|thumb|[[Joan of Arc]] burning at the stake in the city of [[Rouen]], painting by [[Jules Eug\u00e8ne Lenepveu]]]]\nIn 1204, during the reign of [[John, King of England| John of England]], mainland Normandy was taken from England by France under King [[Philip II of France|Philip II]]. Insular Normandy (the Channel Islands) remained however under English control. In 1259, [[Henry III of England]] recognized the legality of French possession of mainland Normandy under the [[Treaty of Paris (1259)|Treaty of Paris]]. His successors, however, often fought to regain control of their ancient fiefdom.\n\nThe ''Charte aux Normands'' granted by [[Louis X of France]] in 1315 (and later re-confirmed in 1339) \u2013 like the analogous [[Magna Carta]] granted in England in the aftermath of 1204 \u2013 guaranteed the liberties and privileges of the province of Normandy.\n\nFrench Normandy was occupied by English forces during the [[Hundred Years' War]] in 1345\u20131360 and again in 1415\u20131450. Normandy lost three-quarters of its population during the war.<ref>{{cite book| author = Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie| title = The French Peasantry: 1450-1660| url = https://archive.org/details/frenchpeasantry10000lero| url-access = registration| year = 1987| publisher = University of California Press| isbn = 978-0-520-05523-0| page = [https://archive.org/details/frenchpeasantry10000lero/page/32 32] }}</ref> Afterward prosperity returned to Normandy until the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]]. When many Norman towns ([[Alen\u00e7on]], [[Rouen]], [[Caen]], [[Coutances]], [[Bayeux]]) joined the [[Protestant Reformation]], battles ensued throughout the province. In the Channel Islands, a period of [[Calvinism]] following the Reformation was suppressed when [[Anglicanism]] was imposed following the [[English Civil War]].\n\n[[Samuel de Champlain]] left the port of [[Honfleur]] in 1604 and founded [[Acadia]]. Four years later, he founded [[Quebec City|Qu\u00e9bec City]]. From then onwards, Normans engaged in a policy of expansion in North America. They continued the exploration of the [[New World]]: [[Ren\u00e9-Robert Cavelier de La Salle]] travelled in the area of the [[Great Lakes]], then on the [[Mississippi River]]. [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] and his brother [[Lemoyne de Bienville]] founded [[Louisiana]], [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]], [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]] and [[New Orleans]]. Territories located between [[Quebec|Qu\u00e9bec]] and the [[Mississippi Delta]] were opened up to establish [[Canada (New France)|Canada]] and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]]. Colonists from Normandy were among the most active in [[New France]], comprising [[Acadia]], [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]].\n\n[[Honfleur]] and [[Le Havre]] were two of the principal [[Atlantic slave trade|slave trade]] ports of France.\n\n===Modern history===\nAlthough agriculture remained important, industries such as weaving, metallurgy, sugar refining, ceramics, and shipbuilding were introduced and developed.\n\nIn the 1780s, the economic crisis and the crisis of the ''[[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]'' struck Normandy as well as other parts of the nation, leading to the [[French Revolution]]. Bad harvests, technical progress and the effects of the [[Eden Agreement]] signed in 1786 affected employment and the economy of the province. Normans laboured under a heavy fiscal burden.\n\nIn 1790 the five departments of Normandy replaced the former province.\n\n13 July 1793, the Norman [[Charlotte Corday]] assassinated [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]].\n\nThe Normans reacted little to the many political upheavals which characterized the 19th century. Overall they warily accepted the changes of r\u00e9gime ([[First French Empire]], [[Bourbon Restoration]], [[July Monarchy]], [[French Second Republic]], [[Second French Empire]], [[French Third Republic]]).\n\nThere was an economic revival (mechanization of textile manufacture, first trains...) after the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1792\u20131815).\n\nAnd new economic activity stimulated the coasts: seaside tourism. The 19th century marks the birth of the first beach resorts.\n\n[[File:NormandySupply edit.jpg|thumb|right|Allied invasion of Normandy, [[D-Day]], 1944]]\nDuring the Second World War, following the [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|armistice of 22 June 1940]], continental Normandy was part of the [[Military Administration in France (Nazi Germany)|German occupied zone of France]]. The Channel Islands were [[German occupation of the Channel Islands|occupied by German forces]] between 30 June 1940 and 9 May 1945. The town of [[Dieppe]] was the site of the unsuccessful [[Dieppe Raid]] by Canadian and British armed forces.\n\n[[Allies of World War II|The Allies]], in this case involving Britain, the United States, Canada and [[Free France]], coordinated a massive build-up of troops and supplies to support a large-scale invasion of Normandy in the [[D-Day landings]] on 6 June 1944 under the code name [[Operation Overlord]]. The Germans were dug into fortified emplacements above the beaches. [[Caen]], [[Cherbourg]], [[Carentan]], [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]] and other Norman towns endured many casualties in the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]], which continued until the closing of the so-called [[Falaise pocket|Falaise gap]] between [[Chambois, Orne|Chambois]] and [[Mont Ormel]]. The liberation of [[Le Havre]] followed. This was a significant turning point in the war and led to the restoration of the French Republic.\n\nThe remainder of Normandy was liberated only on 9 May 1945 at the end of the war, when the [[Liberation of the German-occupied Channel Islands|Channel Island occupation]] effectively ended.\n\nBetween 1956 and 2015 Normandy was divided into two [[Regions of France|administrative regions]]: [[Lower Normandy]] and [[Upper Normandy]]; the regions were merged into one single region on 1 January 2016. [[Upper Normandy]] (''Haute-Normandie'') consisted of the French ''[[d\u00e9partement in France|departments]]'' of [[Seine-Maritime]] and [[Eure]], and [[Lower Normandy]] (''Basse-Normandie'') of the ''[[D\u00e9partement in France|departments]]'' of [[Orne]], [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], and [[Manche]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Mont_Saint_Michel_bordercropped.jpg|thumb|The medieval island of [[Mont-Saint-Michel]], the most visited monument in Normandy]]\n[[File:Falaises Etretat 2012.jpg|thumb|The ''Arche'' and the ''Aiguille'' of the cliffs of [[\u00c9tretat]]]]\n[[File:Jonquerets-de-Livret- batiment du Pressoir.JPG|thumb|A typical Norman [[Thatching|thatched]] building.

Areas near the [[Seine]] (the former [[Upper Normandy]] region) contain a higher concentration of industry. Normandy is a significant [[cider]]-producing region, and also produces [[calvados (spirit)|calvados]], a distilled cider or [[apple brandy]]. Other activities of economic importance are dairy produce, [[flax]] (60% of production in France), [[horse breeding]] (including two French national stud farms), fishing, [[seafood]], and tourism.

The historic three-leopard version (known in the Norman language as ''les treis cats'', \"the three cats\") is used by some associations and individuals, especially those who support reunification of the regions and cultural links with the Channel Islands and England. Jersey and Guernsey use three leopards in their national symbols. The three leopards represents the strength and courage Normandy has towards the neighbouring provinces.\n\nThe unofficial anthem of the region is the song \"[[Ma Normandie]]\".\n\n<gallery heights=\"120\" widths=\"120\" class=\"center bordered-images\">\nFile:Basse-Normandie flag.svg|\"Two-leopard\" version, which is the main one.\nFile:Haute-Normandie flag.svg|\"Three-leopard\" version\nFile:Normandy flag large.png|[[Nordic Cross flag|Nordic Cross]] version\nFile:Pavillon navale Normand.png|Flag used by the sailors of the Normandy.\nFile:Falaise.png|Flag used by the hometown of [[William the Conqueror]].\nFile:Flag of Sark.svg|\"Two-leopard\" flag of [[Sark]]\nFile:Arms of William the Conqueror (1066-1087).svg|Coat of arms of the [[Duchy of Normandy]]\nFile:Coat of arms of Guernsey.svg|[[Coat of arms of Guernsey]]\nFile:Jersey arms on Piquet House in St Helier.jpg|[[Coat of arms of Jersey]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Norman language}}\nThe Norman language, a [[languages of France|regional language]], is spoken by a minority of the population on the continent and the islands, with a concentration in the [[Cotentin Peninsula]] in the far west (the [[Cotentinais]] dialect), and in the [[Pays de Caux]] in the East (the [[Cauchois dialect]]). Many place names demonstrate the [[Old Norse language|Norse]] influence in this [[O\u00efl languages|O\u00efl language]]; for example ''-bec'' (stream), ''-fleur'' (river), ''[[-hou]]'' (island), ''-tot'' (homestead), ''-dal'' or ''-dalle'' (valley) and ''-hogue'' (hill, mound).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.viking.no/e/france/contribution.html|title=The Vikings in Normandy: The Scandinavian contribution in Normandy|publisher=}}</ref> French is the only [[official language]] in continental Normandy and English is also an official language in the Channel Islands.\n\n===Architecture===\n[[File:Dauville Hotel Normandie.jpg|thumb|A Norman style construction in [[Deauville]]]]\n{{Main|Architecture of Normandy}}\n\nArchitecturally, Norman cathedrals, abbeys (such as the [[Abbey of Bec]]) and castles characterise the former duchy in a way that mirrors the similar pattern of [[Norman architecture]] in England following the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066.\n\nDomestic architecture in upper Normandy is typified by [[Half-timbered construction|half-timbered]] buildings that also recall vernacular English architecture, although the farm enclosures of the more harshly landscaped Pays de Caux are a more idiosyncratic response to socio-economic and climatic imperatives. Much urban architectural heritage was destroyed during the Battle of Normandy in 1944 \u2013 post-war urban reconstruction, such as in Le Havre and Saint-L\u00f4, could be said to demonstrate both the virtues and vices of [[Modernism|modernist]] and [[Brutalism|brutalist]] trends of the 1950s and 1960s. Le Havre, the city rebuilt by [[Auguste Perret]], was added to Unesco's World Heritage List in 2005.\n\n[[Vernacular architecture]] in lower Normandy takes its form from [[granite]], the predominant local building material. The Channel Islands also share this influence \u2013 [[Chausey]] was for many years a source of quarried granite, including that used for the construction of [[Mont Saint-Michel]].\n\nThe south part of [[Bagnoles-de-l'Orne]] is filled with bourgeois villas in ''[[Belle \u00c9poque]]'' style with polychrome fa\u00e7ades, bow windows and unique roofing. This area, built between 1886 and 1914, has an authentic \u201cBagnolese\u201d style and is typical of high-society country vacation of the time. The Chapel of Saint Germanus (''Chapelle Saint-Germain'') at [[Querqueville]] with its [[trefoil]] floorplan incorporates elements of one of the earliest surviving places of Christian worship in the Cotentin \u2013 perhaps second only to the Gallo-Roman baptistry at [[Port-Bail]]. It is dedicated to [[Germanus of Normandy]].\n\n===Gastronomy===\n[[File:Vachesnormandes.jpg|thumb|[[Normande Cattle|Normande cow]]</center>]]\nParts of Normandy consist of rolling countryside typified by pasture for dairy cattle and apple orchards. A wide range of dairy products are produced and exported. Norman cheeses include [[Camembert (cheese)|Camembert]], [[Livarot cheese|Livarot]], [[Pont-l'\u00c9v\u00eaque cheese|Pont l'\u00c9v\u00eaque]], [[Brillat-Savarin cheese|Brillat-Savarin]], [[Neufch\u00e2tel (cheese)|Neufch\u00e2tel]], [[Petit suisse (cheese)|Petit Suisse]] and [[Boursin (cheese)|Boursin]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fromages.org/fdn/fdn_histoire_en.html |title=Norman cheeses: History |publisher=fromages.org}}</ref> Normandy butter and Normandy cream are lavishly used in gastronomic specialties.\n[[File:Reflets de France Cidre.jpg|thumb|[[Cider]] from Normandy</center>]]\nTurbot and oysters from the Cotentin Peninsula are major delicacies throughout France. Normandy is the chief [[oyster]]-cultivating, scallop-exporting, and mussel-raising region in France.\n\nNormandy is a major [[cider]]-producing region (very little wine is produced). [[Perry]] is also produced, but in less significant quantities. Apple brandy, of which the most famous variety is [[calvados (spirit)|calvados]], is also popular. The mealtime ''trou normand'', or \"Norman hole\", is a pause between meal courses in which diners partake of a glassful of calvados in order to improve the appetite and make room for the next course, and this is still observed in many homes and restaurants. ''[[Pommeau]]'' is an ''[[ap\u00e9ritif]]'' produced by blending unfermented cider and apple brandy. Another aperitif is the ''[[Kir (cocktail)|kir]] normand'', a measure of [[cr\u00e8me de cassis]] topped up with cider. ''[[B\u00e9n\u00e9dictine]]'' is produced in [[F\u00e9camp]].\n\nOther regional specialities include ''[[tripes \u00e0 la mode de Caen]]'', ''[[andouille]]s'' and ''andouillettes'', [[salade cauchoise]], salt meadow (''pr\u00e9 sal\u00e9'') lamb, seafood (mussels, [[scallop]]s, lobsters, mackerel...), and ''[[teurgoule]]'' (spiced rice pudding).\n\nNormandy dishes include duckling ''\u00e0 la rouennaise'', saut\u00e9ed chicken ''yvetois'', and goose ''en daube''. Rabbit is cooked with [[morel]]s, or ''\u00e0 la havraise'' (stuffed with truffled pigs' trotters). Other dishes are sheep's trotters ''\u00e0 la rouennaise'', casseroled veal, larded calf's liver braised with carrots, and veal (or turkey) in cream and mushrooms.\n\nNormandy is also noted for its pastries. Normandy turns out ''douillons'' (pears baked in pastry), ''craquelins'', ''roulettes'' in Rouen, ''fouaces'' in Caen, ''fallues'' in [[Lisieux]], ''sabl\u00e9s'' in Lisieux.  It is the birthplace of [[brioche]]s (especially those from [[\u00c9vreux]] and [[Gisors]]). Confectionery of the region includes [[Rouen]] apple sugar, Isigny caramels, [[Bayeux]] mint chews, Falaise berlingots, [[Le Havre]] marzipans, [[Argentan]] ''croquettes'', and Rouen [[macaroons]].\n\nNormandy is the native land of [[Taillevent]], cook of the kings of France [[Charles V of France|Charles V]] and [[Charles VI of France|Charles VI]]. He wrote the earliest French cookery book named ''Le Viandier''. ''[[Confiture de lait]]'' was also made in Normandy around the 14th century.\n\n===Literature===\n[[File:Wace illustration Roman de Rou 1824.jpg|thumb|[[Wace]] presents his ''[[Roman de Rou]]'' to Henry II, Illustration 1824]]\n{{See also|Anglo-Norman literature|Gesta Normannorum Ducum}}\nThe dukes of Normandy commissioned and inspired epic literature to record and legitimise their rule. [[Wace]], [[Orderic Vitalis]] and [[Stephen of Rouen]] were among those who wrote in the service of the dukes. After the division of 1204, French literature provided the model for the development of literature in Normandy. [[Olivier Basselin]] wrote of the Vaux de Vire, the origin of literary ''[[vaudeville]]''. Notable Norman writers include [[Jean Marot]], [[R\u00e9my Belleau]], [[Guy de Maupassant]], [[Jules Barbey d'Aurevilly]], [[Gustave Flaubert]], [[Octave Mirbeau]], and [[Remy de Gourmont]], and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]]. The Corneille brothers, [[Pierre Corneille|Pierre]] and [[Thomas Corneille|Thomas]], born in Rouen, were great figures of French classical literature.\n\nDavid Ferrand (1591\u20131660) in his ''Muse Normande'' established a landmark of Norman language literature. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the workers and merchants of [[Rouen]] established a tradition of polemical and satirical literature in a form of language called the ''parler purin''. At the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th century a new movement arose in the Channel Islands, led by writers such as [[George M\u00e9tivier]], which sparked a literary renaissance on the Norman mainland. In exile in Jersey and then Guernsey, [[Victor Hugo]] took an interest in the vernacular literature. ''[[Les Travailleurs de la mer]]'' is a well-known novel by Hugo set in the Channel Islands. The boom in insular literature in the early 19th century encouraged production especially in La Hague and around Cherbourg, where Alfred Rossel, Louis Beuve and [[C\u00f4tis-Capel]] became active. The typical medium for literary expression in Norman has traditionally been newspaper columns and almanacs. The novel ''Zabeth'' by Andr\u00e9 Louis which appeared in 1969 was the first novel published in Norman.\n\n===Painting===\n[[File:Claude Monet - Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son]]'', 1875]]\n\nNormandy has a rich tradition of painting and gave to France some of its most important artists.\n\nIn the 17th century some major French painters were Normans like [[Nicolas Poussin]], born in [[Les Andelys]] and [[Jean Jouvenet]].\n\n[[Romanticism]] drew painters to the Channel coasts of Normandy. [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]] crossed the Channel from Great Britain, attracted by the light and landscapes. [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]], a native of Rouen, was a notable figure in the Romantic movement, its famous ''[[Le Radeau de la M\u00e9duse|Radeau de la M\u00e9duse]]'' being considered come the breakthrough of pictorial romanticism in France when it was officially presented at the 1819 Salon. The competing Realist tendency was represented by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet]], a native of La Hague. The landscape painter [[Eug\u00e8ne Boudin]], born in Honfleur, was a determining influence on the impressionnists and was highly considered by Monet.\n\n[[File:Robert Antoine Pinchon, Un apr\u00e8s-midi \u00e0 l'Ile aux Cerises, Rouen, oil on canvas, 50 x 61.2 cm.jpg|thumb|[[Robert Antoine Pinchon]], ''Un apr\u00e8s-midi \u00e0 l'Ile aux Cerises, Rouen'', oil on canvas, 50 x 61.2 cm]]\nBreaking away from the more formalised and classical themes of the early part of the 19th century, Impressionist painters preferred to paint outdoors, in natural light, and to concentrate on landscapes, towns and scenes of daily life.\n\nLeader of the movement and father of modern painting, [[Claude Monet]] is one of the best known Impressionists and a major character in Normandy's artistic heritage. His [[Fondation Monet in Giverny|house and gardens]] at [[Giverny]] are one of the region's major tourist sites, much visited for their beauty and their water lilies, as well as for their importance to Monet's artistic inspiration. Normandy was at the heart of his creation, from the paintings of Rouen's cathedral to the famous depictions of the cliffs at [[Etretat]], the beach and port at [[F\u00e9camp]] and the sunrise at [[Le Havre]]. It was ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'', Monet's painting of Le Havre, that led to the movement being dubbed [[Impressionism]]. After Monet, all the main [[avant-garde]] painters of the 1870s and 1880s came to Normandy to paint its landscapes and its changing lights, concentrating along the Seine valley and the Norman coast.\n\nLandscapes and scenes of daily life were also immortalised on canvas by artists such as [[William Turner (artist)|William Turner]], [[Gustave Courbet]], the Honfleur born Eug\u00e8ne Boudin, [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley]], [[Auguste Renoir]], [[Gustave Caillebotte]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], [[Paul Signac]], [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Georges Braque]] and [[Pablo Picasso]]. While Monet's work adorns galleries and collections all over the world, a remarkable quantity of Impressionist works can be found in galleries throughout Normandy, such as the [[Mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts de Rouen|Museum of Fine Arts]] in [[Rouen]], the Mus\u00e9e Eug\u00e8ne Boudin in [[Honfleur]] or the [[Mus\u00e9e Malraux|Andr\u00e9 Malraux Museum]] in [[Le Havre]].\n\n[[Maurice Denis]], one of the leaders and theoricists of the [[Les Nabis|Nabis]] movement in the 1890s, was a native of Granville, in the Manche department.\n\nThe ''[[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Normande de Peinture Moderne]]'' was founded in 1909 by [[Pierre Dumont (painter)|Pierre Dumont]], [[Robert Antoine Pinchon]], Yvonne Barbier and Eug\u00e8ne Tirvert. Among members were [[Raoul Dufy]], a native of Le Havre, [[Albert Marquet]], [[Francis Picabia]] and [[Maurice Utrillo]]. Also in this movement were the Duchamp brothers, [[Jacques Villon]] and [[Marcel Duchamp]], considered one of the father of modern art, also natives of Normandy. [[Jean Dubuffet]], one of the leading French artist of the 1940s and the 1950s was born in Le Havre.\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Rouen Cathedral as seen from Gros Horloge 140215 4.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rouen Cathedral]]]]\n\nChristian missionaries implanted [[monastic communities]] in the territory in the 5th and 6th centuries. Some of these missionaries came from across the [[English Channel|Channel]]. The influence of [[Celtic Christianity]] can still be found in the [[Cotentin]]. By the terms of the treaty of Saint-Clair-sur-Epte, Rollo, a Viking pagan, accepted Christianity and was baptised. The Duchy of Normandy was therefore formally a Christian state from its foundation. The [[cathedral]]s of Normandy have exerted influence down the centuries in matters of both faith and politics. [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] of England, did [[penance]] at the cathedral of [[Avranches Cathedral|Avranches]] on 21 May 1172 and was absolved from the censures incurred by the assassination of [[Thomas Becket]]. [[Mont Saint-Michel]] is a historic [[pilgrimage]] site.\n\nNormandy does not have one generally agreed [[patron saint]], although this title has been ascribed to Saint [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], and to [[Saint Ouen]]. Many saints have been revered in Normandy down the centuries, including:\n* [[St. Aubert|Aubert]] who's remembered as the founder of [[Mont Saint-Michel]]\n* [[Saint Marcouf|Marcouf]] and [[Laud of Coutances|Laud]] who are important saints in Normandy\n* [[Helier]] and [[Samson of Dol]] who are evangelizers of the Channel Islands\n* [[Thomas Becket]], an [[Anglo-Normans|Anglo-Norman]] whose parents were from Rouen, who was the object of a considerable cult in mainland Normandy following his martyrdom\n* [[Joan of Arc]] who was [[martyr]]ed in Rouen, and who is especially remembered in that city\n* [[Th\u00e9r\u00e8se de Lisieux]] whose birthplace in [[Alen\u00e7on]] and later home in Lisieux are a focus for religious pilgrims.\n* [[Germanus of Normandy]]\n\nSince the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]] there is no established church in mainland Normandy. In the [[Channel Islands]], the [[Church of England]] is the [[established church]].\n\n===People===\n:''See [[:Category:People from Normandy]]''\n\n==Image gallery==\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:MSM sunset 02.JPG|[[Mont Saint-Michel]]\nFile:Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard.jpg|[[Ch\u00e2teau Gaillard]]\nFile:Honfleur vieux bassin.jpg|[[Honfleur]]\nFile:Le Havre (skatepark).jpg|[[Le Havre]]\nFile:Arromanches-les-Bains port artificiel Mulberry.jpg|[[Arromanches]], [[Mulberry Harbour]]\nFile:Port Racine \u00a9E.Tessier.jpg|[[Saint-Germain-des-Vaux|Port Racine]]\nFile:Colombages.jpg|Half-timbered houses in [[Rouen]]\nFile:Saint-Cen\u00e9ri-Le-Gerei.jpg|[[Saint-C\u00e9neri-le-G\u00e9rei]]\nFile:Etelan0706ZF - Basse Def..jpg|[[Ch\u00e2teau d'\u00c9telan]] (1494)\nFile:Honfleur Harbour, June 2012.jpg|Decorated boats in [[Honfleur]] harbour\nFile:RouenCathedral Monet 1894.jpg|[[Rouen Cathedral]] by [[Claude Monet]]\nFile:NormandyCourcelles2JM.jpg|[[World War II]] 15&nbsp;cm TbtsK C/36 German coastal gun.\nFile:Pegasus Bridge, June 1944 B5288.jpg|[[Pegasus Bridge]]\nFile:Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial, June 2012.jpg|The Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial near [[Colleville-sur-Mer]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France}}\n* [[Duchy of Normandy]]\n* [[Duke of Normandy]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Normandie|Normandy}}\n{{NIE Poster|year=1905}}\n* {{in lang|fr}} [http://www.normandie-heritage.com Normandie H\u00e9ritage]\n* [http://www.mondes-normands.caen.fr/angleterre/index.htm The Norman Worlds]\n* [http://www.pbase.com/ericdeparis/normandie Gallery of photos of Normandy]\n\n{{Regions of France|current}}\n{{Historic Provinces of France}}\n\n[[Category:Normandy| ]]\n[[Category:Former provinces of France]]\n[[Category:Divided regions]]\n[[Category:Regions of France]]\n[[Category:Historical regions]]\n", "name_user": "Hilmorel", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFlag", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy"}

Remote Desktop Services sessions run in a single shared-server operating system (e.g. [[Windows Server 2008 R2]] and later) and are accessed using the [[Remote Desktop Protocol]].\n* [[Desktop virtualization]] software technologies improve portability, manageability and compatibility of a personal computer's desktop environment by separating part or all of the desktop environment and associated applications from the physical client device that is used to access it. A common implementation of this approach is to host multiple desktop operating system instances on a server hardware platform running a hypervisor. This is generally referred to as \"virtual desktop infrastructure\" (VDI).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Workspace virtualization]]\n* [[Operating-system-level virtualization]] (\"containerization\")\n* [[Portable application creators]]\n* [[Comparison of application virtual machines]]\n* [[Shim (computing)]]\n* [[Virtual application]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n[[Category:Virtualization software]]\n[[Category:Windows security software]]\n[[Category:MacOS security software]]\n[[Category:Linux emulation software]]\n[[Category:Unix emulation software]]\n", "name_user": "Markalanarice", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added a link which might be useful for the user", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_virtualization"}
