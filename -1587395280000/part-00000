Master masons included Richard of Crundale, Roger of Crundale (probably Richard's brother), Michael of Canterbury, Richard of Stow, John of Battle and Nicholas Dymenge.<ref name=\"colv483_4\"/> Sculptors included [[Alexander of Abingdon]] and William of Ireland, both of whom had worked at Westminster Abbey, who were paid \u00a33 6s. 8d. apiece for the statues; and Ralph of Chichester.<ref>Hastings 1955, pp. 20\u201321.</ref><ref>Powrie 1990, p. 65.</ref><ref>Cockerill 2014, p. 357.</ref><ref>Liversidge 1989.</ref>\n\n===Purpose and parallels===\nEleanor's crosses appear to have been intended in part as expressions of royal power; and in part as [[cenotaph]]s to encourage [[chantry chapel|prayers for her soul]] from travellers.<ref>''Chronicle of St Albans''.</ref><ref>Colvin 1963, p. 485.</ref><ref>Cockerill 2014, pp. 351\u201352.</ref> On the pedestal of each was inscribed the phrase ''Orate pro anima'' (\"Pray for [her] soul\").<ref>Hunter 1842, p. 180.</ref>\n\nIt was not unknown for [[memorial cross]]es to be constructed in the middle ages, although they were normally isolated instances and relatively simple in design. A cross in the [[Strand, London|Strand]], near London, was said to have been erected by [[William II of England|William II]] in memory of his mother, [[Matilda of Flanders|Queen Matilda]] (d. 1083). [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] erected one at [[Merton (parish)|Merton]], Surrey, for his cousin the [[William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey|Earl of Surrey]] (d. 1240). Another was erected at [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] for Edward I's sister [[Beatrice of England|Beatrice]] (d. 1275). Yet another, almost contemporary with the Eleanor crosses, was erected near [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] for Edward's mother, [[Eleanor of Provence]] (d.1291).<ref name=\"colv484_5\">Colvin 1963, pp. 484\u201385.</ref><ref>Parsons 1991, pp. 18, 60.</ref><ref>Parsons 1995, p. 209.</ref>\n\nThe closest precedent for the Eleanor crosses, and almost certainly their model, was the series of nine crosses known as ''montjoies'' erected along the funeral route of King [[Louis IX of France]] in 1271. These were elaborate structures incorporating sculptural representations of the King, and were erected in part to promote his [[canonisation]] (a campaign that in 1297 succeeded). Eleanor's crosses never aspired to this last purpose, but in design were even larger and more ornate than the ''montjoies'', being of at least three rather than two tiers.<ref name=\"evans\">{{cite journal |first=Joan |last=Evans |authorlink=Joan Evans (art historian) |title=A prototype of the Eleanor crosses |journal=[[Burlington Magazine]] |volume=91 |year=1949 |pages=96\u201397 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Branner |authorlink=Robert Branner |chapter=The Montjoies of Saint Louis |editor1-first=Douglas |editor1-last=Fraser |editor2-first=Howard |editor2-last=Hibbard |editor2-link=Howard Hibbard |editor3-first=Milton J. |editor3-last=Lewine |title=Essays in the History of Architecture presented to Rudolf Wittkower |location=London |publisher=Phaidon |year=1967 |pages=13\u201316 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=John |last=Zukowsky |title=Montjoies and Eleanor Crosses reconsidered |journal=[[Gesta (journal)|Gesta]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |year=1974 |pages=39\u201344 }}</ref><ref name=\"colv484_5\"/><ref>Cockerill 2014, p. 351.</ref>\n\n==The twelve crosses==\n===Lincoln===\n[[File:Lincoln 128a.jpg|thumb|upright|The surviving fragment of the Lincoln cross]]\n<small>({{Coord|53|12|51|N|00|32|47|W|}})</small><br/>\nEleanor's viscera were buried in Lincoln Cathedral on 3 December 1290.

The crosses stood at [[Lincoln, England|Lincoln]], [[Grantham]] and [[Stamford, Lincolnshire|Stamford]], all in [[Lincolnshire]]; [[Geddington]] and [[Hardingstone]] in [[Northamptonshire]]; [[Stony Stratford]] in [[Buckinghamshire]]; [[Woburn, Bedfordshire|Woburn]] and [[Dunstable]] in [[Bedfordshire]]; [[St Albans]] and Waltham (now [[Waltham Cross]]) in [[Hertfordshire]]; [[Cheapside]] in London; and Charing (now [[Charing Cross]]) in [[Westminster]].

Their construction is documented in the executors' account rolls, which survive from 1291 to March 1294, but not thereafter.<ref>Botfield and Turner 1841.</ref> By the end of that period, the crosses at Lincoln, Hardingstone, Stony Stratford, Woburn, Dunstable, St Albans and Waltham were complete or nearly so, and those at Cheapside and Charing in progress; but those at Grantham, Stamford and Geddington apparently not yet begun.

Master masons included Richard of Crundale, Roger of Crundale (probably Richard's brother), Michael of Canterbury, Richard of Stow, John of Battle and Nicholas Dymenge.<ref name=\"colv483_4\"/> Sculptors included [[Alexander of Abingdon]] and William of Ireland, both of whom had worked at Westminster Abbey, who were paid \u00a33 6s. 8d. apiece for the statues; and Ralph of Chichester.<ref>Hastings 1955, pp. 20\u201321.</ref><ref>Powrie 1990, p. 65.</ref><ref>Cockerill 2014, p. 357.</ref><ref>Liversidge 1989.</ref>\n\n===Purpose and parallels===\nEleanor's crosses appear to have been intended in part as expressions of royal power; and in part as [[cenotaph]]s to encourage [[chantry chapel|prayers for her soul]] from travellers.<ref>''Chronicle of St Albans''.</ref><ref>Colvin 1963, p. 485.</ref><ref>Cockerill 2014, pp. 351\u201352.</ref> On the pedestal of each was inscribed the phrase ''Orate pro anima'' (\"Pray for [her] soul\").<ref>Hunter 1842, p. 180.</ref>\n\nIt was not unknown for [[memorial cross]]es to be constructed in the middle ages, although they were normally isolated instances and relatively simple in design. A cross in the [[Strand, London|Strand]], near London, was said to have been erected by [[William II of England|William II]] in memory of his mother, [[Matilda of Flanders|Queen Matilda]] (d. 1083). [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] erected one at [[Merton (parish)|Merton]], Surrey, for his cousin the [[William de Warenne, 5th Earl of Surrey|Earl of Surrey]] (d. 1240). Another was erected at [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]] for Edward I's sister [[Beatrice of England|Beatrice]] (d. 1275). Yet another, almost contemporary with the Eleanor crosses, was erected near [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]] for Edward's mother, [[Eleanor of Provence]] (d.1291).<ref name=\"colv484_5\">Colvin 1963, pp. 484\u201385.</ref><ref>Parsons 1991, pp. 18, 60.</ref><ref>Parsons 1995, p. 209.</ref>\n\nThe closest precedent for the Eleanor crosses, and almost certainly their model, was the series of nine crosses known as ''montjoies'' erected along the funeral route of King [[Louis IX of France]] in 1271. These were elaborate structures incorporating sculptural representations of the King, and were erected in part to promote his [[canonisation]] (a campaign that in 1297 succeeded). Eleanor's crosses never aspired to this last purpose, but in design were even larger and more ornate than the ''montjoies'', being of at least three rather than two tiers.<ref name=\"evans\">{{cite journal |first=Joan |last=Evans |authorlink=Joan Evans (art historian) |title=A prototype of the Eleanor crosses |journal=[[Burlington Magazine]] |volume=91 |year=1949 |pages=96\u201397 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Robert |last=Branner |authorlink=Robert Branner |chapter=The Montjoies of Saint Louis |editor1-first=Douglas |editor1-last=Fraser |editor2-first=Howard |editor2-last=Hibbard |editor2-link=Howard Hibbard |editor3-first=Milton J. |editor3-last=Lewine |title=Essays in the History of Architecture presented to Rudolf Wittkower |location=London |publisher=Phaidon |year=1967 |pages=13\u201316 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=John |last=Zukowsky |title=Montjoies and Eleanor Crosses reconsidered |journal=[[Gesta (journal)|Gesta]] |volume=13 |issue=1 |year=1974 |pages=39\u201344 }}</ref><ref name=\"colv484_5\"/><ref>Cockerill 2014, p. 351.</ref>\n\n==The twelve crosses==\n===Lincoln===\n[[File:Lincoln 128a.jpg|thumb|upright|The surviving fragment of the Lincoln cross]]\n<small>({{Coord|53|12|51|N|00|32|47|W|}})</small><br/>\nEleanor's viscera were buried in Lincoln Cathedral on 3 December 1290.

The Center on Public Policy, established in 1966, was a research center and so did not offer degrees. The Center hosted fellows and conferences and published research in the field of public policy, primarily urban studies and urban journalism.<ref>{{cite conference\n | title = What's Wrong With Women's Pages?\n | contribution = The Urban Journalism Fellowship Program\n | series = University of Chicago Center for Policy Studies\n | publisher = Chicago, Illinois\n | date = 1971\n | contribution-url = https://books.google.com/books/about/What_s_wrong_with_women_s_pages.html?id=OvHyAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> The Committee on Public Policy was formed to offer master's degrees to students interested in policy studies. The Committee, formed of professors employed by different academic divisions, began offering classes in 1976 to a small group of one-year Master's students who had applied internally from other graduate divisions within the University of Chicago. The Committee's long term viability was called into question for reasons including the small demand for one year master's degrees in public policy and weak administrative support for such a small program.<ref>{{cite web|title= A Look Back at the Committee on Public Policy Studies |url=https://harris.uchicago.edu/news-events/news/look-back-committee-public-policy-studies|publisher= Harris School of Public Policy|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> Over the next three years the Committee began offering two year degrees, joint BA/MA degrees and PhDs, but it continued to be threatened by weak administrative support and unstable funding.<ref>{{cite conference\n | title = The Irving B.

In addition to [[policy studies]] and [[policy analysis]], the school requires its students to pursue training in [[economics]] and [[statistics]] through preliminary examinations and course requirements.

The Committee, formed of professors employed by different academic divisions, began offering classes in 1976 to a small group of one-year Master's students who had applied internally from other graduate divisions within the University of Chicago. The Committee's long term viability was called into question for reasons including the small demand for one year master's degrees in public policy and weak administrative support for such a small program.<ref>{{cite web|title= A Look Back at the Committee on Public Policy Studies |url=https://harris.uchicago.edu/news-events/news/look-back-committee-public-policy-studies|publisher= Harris School of Public Policy|accessdate=October 19, 2017}}</ref> Over the next three years the Committee began offering two year degrees, joint BA/MA degrees and PhDs, but it continued to be threatened by weak administrative support and unstable funding.<ref>{{cite conference\n | title = The Irving B.

{"title_page": "Midrasha", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=January 2008}}\nA '''''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}''''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{hebrew|\u05de\u05d3\u05e8\u05e9\u05d4}}, pl. ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot/midrashas}}'') refers to an institute of [[Torah study|Jewish studies]] for women. In [[Israel]], it is often an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] institution that caters solely to women, and roughly the equivalent of a [[yeshiva]] for men. An alternative term, and translation, is '[[seminary]]' ({{hebrew|\u05e1\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05e8}}). <ref>[https://www.science.co.il/jewish-studies/Midrashot.php ''Midrashot''], science.co.il</ref>\n\nIn [[Israel]], a midrasha that offers [[academic degree|degree studies]] is sometimes called a ''machon'' (institute). Some ''{{lang|he-Latn|midrashot}}''  accept both men and women, such as the Ein Prat Midrasha<ref>[http://www.bogrim.org/en_index.html Eni Prat Midrasha Bogrim.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071101012427/http://www.bogrim.org/en_index.html |date=2007-11-01 }}</ref> in Israel.\n\nIn the [[United States]], the term has also been used to refer to co-educational Jewish studies programs, where high school students continue their Jewish education post [[bar mitzvah|bar]] / [[bat mitzvah]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n==Etymology==\nThe word \"''{{lang|he-Latn|midrasha}}''\" is based on the term ''[[beit midrash]]'', \"house of study\".  It is [[cognate]] with the [[Arabic]] \"''{{transl|ar|[[madrasa|madrasah]]}}'',\" which also refers to a place of learning.\n\n==Structure==\n''{{lang|he-Latn|Midrashot}}'' vary in curriculum and [[Orthodox Judaism#Social and philosophic differences|philosophy]]. \nAll cover [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), [[Jewish philosophy]], [[Halacha|Jewish law]]  and [[Musar Literature|Ethics (Musar)]] / [[Hasidic philosophy|''Hasidus'']].

The name is notably found in Wexford, where the Normans first landed in [[Ireland]] from [[Pembrokeshire]] in Wales. It is claimed as a variant of ''Devreux'' (which unlike ''Devereux''<ref>http://www.geopatronyme.com/cgi-bin/carte/nomcarte.cgi?nom=devreux</ref> is still encountered in Normandy) meaning \"d'\u00c9vreux\" or \"from [[\u00c9vreux]]\", a town in [[Normandy]], France. Another explanation is that it is equivalent to the name Dyfrig (or Dubricius), a saint originating from south Herefordshire ([[Archenfield]]), where the parish of [[St. Devereux]] is also found.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe similar names [[Devereaux (disambiguation)|Devereaux]] and [[Deveraux]] are alternate spellings of the surname resulting from the various ways of pronouncing it - the placename is pronounced \"Ev-ruh\" ({{IPA-fr|ev\u0281\u00f8}}) and the surname may be pronounced Dever-o, Dever-oo, Dever-ooks, Dev-erah, Dev-rah, Dev-ruh, Dev-rix (Wexford), or Devereux.\n\n==People==\n*[[Count of \u00c9vreux]], title of nobility at the origin of the name\n*[[Dora Devereux]] (born 1884), dressmaker\n*[[Elizabeth Devereux-Rochester]] (born 1917), British female spy\n*[[George Devereux]] (1908-1985), Austro-Hungarian ethnologist and psychoanalyst (born in Lugoj, nowadays part of Romania)\n*[[Helena Devereux]] (1885-1975), American educator and founder of the Devereux Foundation\n*[[James Devereux]] (1903-1988), U.S. Marine Corps General and politician\n*[[Jim Devereux]] (1885\u20131936), Australian rugby league footballer\n*[[John Devereux (disambiguation)]]\n*[[Lillie Devereux Blake]], American feminist\n*[[Marie Devereux]], British actress\n*[[Nicholas Devereux]] (1791-1855), Irish-American banker, trustee, and western New York landowner\n*[[Ricardo Wall|General Ricardo Wall y Devereux]], Spanish General and Prime Minister of the 18th-century\n*[[Richard Devereux]] (born 1938), English cricketer\n*[[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]] (1566-1601), military hero and royal favourite, executed for treason\n*[[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex]] (1591-1646), son of Robert Devereux, courtier and soldier\n*[[Robin Devereux, 19th Viscount Hereford]] (1975-), an English peer and premier viscount\n*[[Sean Devereux]] (1964-1993), English-born educator known for his support of food aid in Liberia and opposition to child soldier conscription, and activist in Somalia.
