He was a backup wide receiver in his first 2 seasons.\n\nHe became a starter as a junior, teaming with [[Tim Barnett (American football)|Tim Barnett]] and becoming the top receiving duo in [[Division I-AA]], while registering 40 receptions (led the team) for 877 yards (21.3-yard average) and 9 [[touchdown]]s. Against [[Southern University]], he made 4 receptions for 184 yards and tied a school record with 3 receiving [[touchdown]]s (70,64 and 37 yards).\n\nIn his final year, he led the team with 43 catches for 801 yards (18.4-yard average) and 3 [[touchdown]]s. He finished his college career with 110 receptions, 2,073 yards and 16 [[touchdown]]s. Against [[Delaware State University]], he set a school record with 10 receptions for 239 yards, including a 71-yard [[touchdown]]. He graduated with a bachelor's degree in business administration.<ref name=\"jimmysmithathletics.com\"/>\n\nIn 2011, he was named to the [[Jackson State University]] All-Century team.\n\n==Professional career==\n\n===Dallas Cowboys===\nSmith was selected by the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in the second round (36th overall) of the [[1992 NFL Draft]]. He missed the first four games after he broke his right [[fibula]] during the Dallas Blue-White Scrimmage on July 19. After missing ample time during the season, he was listed as the fourth wide receiver on the [[1992 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys']] depth chart, behind [[Michael Irvin]], [[Alvin Harper]], and [[Kelvin Martin (American football)|Kelvin Martin]]. On October 11, he made his professional regular season debut during a 27-0 victory over the [[1992 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]]. In a Week 16 matchup against the [[1992 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], Smith had the highlight of his rookie year, tackling [[Deion Sanders]] during a punt return in a 41-17 victory. He played in just seven games as a special teamer, without registering a reception. The Cowboys finished first in the [[NFC East]] with a 13-3 record. On January 10, 1993, he appeared in his first career playoff game during the Cowboys 34-10 win over the [[1992 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], playing on [[special teams]]. Smith earned the first ring of his career as a rookie, after the Cowboys went on to [[Super Bowl XXVII]] and defeated the [[1992 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] 52-17.\n\nIn [[1993 Dallas Cowboys season|1993]], he was leading the team in pre-season (13) and receiving yards (197), while competing for the role as the third wide receiver that was left open with the departure in [[free agency]] of [[Kelvin Martin (American football)|Kelvin Martin]], behind Irvin and Harper. On August 21, Smith began feeling a pain in his abdominal area and brought it to the attention of two trainers and the team doctor, J.D. Zamarano, and was given [[Pepto Bismol]], [[Maalox]], and [[Tagamet]]. He played in the next preseason game and caught a touchdown reception, and was waved back in by a coach after taking himself out from taking a hit to the abdominal area that worsened the pain. Over the next few days he repeatedly brought the pain to the attention of the trainers and wasn't given adequate care or the correct diagnosis. He asked to be directed to a doctor and was told to see the team doctor who gave him a check up and took him to see the team surgeon that finally diagnosed him with [[appendicitis]]. On August 24, 1993, he underwent an emergency [[appendectomy]] surgery. The following day, he was released from the hospital by the surgeon although he had a 102.5 degree fever. On August 27, Smith was readmitted into the hospital after he woke up in severe pain with his stomach bloated and was vomiting, because of a severe post-surgical infection that was nearly fatal. He went into emergency surgery for an [[Ileostomy]], where they dissect and removed his intestine then substituted an external bag to collect his fecal matter, forcing Smith to miss the entire season, including [[Super Bowl XXVIII]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=20000123&id=fjofAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5s8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=2065,2664744&hl=en | title=Detours don't stop Jacksonville's Smith | accessdate=January 7, 2018}}</ref> On October 2, the Cowboys placed him on the non-football illness list and opted not to pay his entire $350,000 salary for the 1993 season, as well as his insurance, pension, and free agent credits, making Smith instead an offer of $100,000 and no credits, which he declined.<ref>{{cite web| title=ANATOMY OF AN NFL GRIEVANCE: JIMMY SMITH VS.

He missed the first four games after he broke his right [[fibula]] during the Dallas Blue-White Scrimmage on July 19. After missing ample time during the season, he was listed as the fourth wide receiver on the [[1992 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys']] depth chart, behind [[Michael Irvin]], [[Alvin Harper]], and [[Kelvin Martin (American football)|Kelvin Martin]]. On October 11, he made his professional regular season debut during a 27-0 victory over the [[1992 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]]. In a Week 16 matchup against the [[1992 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]], Smith had the highlight of his rookie year, tackling [[Deion Sanders]] during a punt return in a 41-17 victory. He played in just seven games as a special teamer, without registering a reception. The Cowboys finished first in the [[NFC East]] with a 13-3 record. On January 10, 1993, he appeared in his first career playoff game during the Cowboys 34-10 win over the [[1992 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], playing on [[special teams]].

On August 21, Smith began feeling a pain in his abdominal area and brought it to the attention of two trainers and the team doctor, J.D. Zamarano, and was given [[Pepto Bismol]], [[Maalox]], and [[Tagamet]]. He played in the next preseason game and caught a touchdown reception, and was waved back in by a coach after taking himself out from taking a hit to the abdominal area that worsened the pain. Over the next few days he repeatedly brought the pain to the attention of the trainers and wasn't given adequate care or the correct diagnosis. He asked to be directed to a doctor and was told to see the team doctor who gave him a check up and took him to see the team surgeon that finally diagnosed him with [[appendicitis]]. On August 24, 1993, he underwent an emergency [[appendectomy]] surgery. The following day, he was released from the hospital by the surgeon although he had a 102.5 degree fever. On August 27, Smith was readmitted into the hospital after he woke up in severe pain with his stomach bloated and was vomiting, because of a severe post-surgical infection that was nearly fatal. He went into emergency surgery for an [[Ileostomy]], where they dissect and removed his intestine then substituted an external bag to collect his fecal matter, forcing Smith to miss the entire season, including [[Super Bowl XXVIII]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1876&dat=20000123&id=fjofAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5s8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=2065,2664744&hl=en | title=Detours don't stop Jacksonville's Smith | accessdate=January 7, 2018}}</ref> On October 2, the Cowboys placed him on the non-football illness list and opted not to pay his entire $350,000 salary for the 1993 season, as well as his insurance, pension, and free agent credits, making Smith instead an offer of $100,000 and no credits, which he declined.<ref>{{cite web| title=ANATOMY OF AN NFL GRIEVANCE: JIMMY SMITH VS.
