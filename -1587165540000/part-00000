In the former, the courts have been divided on the question of whether a state [[law violation]] is necessary for honest services fraud to have occurred. In the latter, the courts have taken differing approaches to determining whether a private individual has committed honest services fraud\u2014a test based on reasonably foreseeable economic harm and a test based on materiality. The statute, which has been a target of criticism, was given a narrow construction by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in the case of ''[[Skilling v. United States]]'' (2010).  In order to avoid finding the statute to be unconstitutionally vague, the Court interpreted the statute to cover only \"fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]] supplied by a third party who ha[s] not been deceived\".<ref>[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1394Reissue.pdf ''Skilling v. United States'', 130 S.Ct. 2896]</ref>\n\n==History and case law==\nSince at least 1941, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, and prior to 1987, the courts had interpreted the mail fraud and wire fraud statutes as criminalizing not only schemes to defraud victims of money and property, but also schemes to defraud victims of intangible rights such as the \"honest services\" of a public official.<ref name=martindale>[http://www.martindale.com/government-law/article_Day-Pitney-LLP_627678.htm Ninth Circuit Joins Other Circuits in Ruling that Honest Services Fraud Conviction of a Public Official Does Not Require a Violation of State Law], Martindale.com</ref> In 1987, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[McNally v.

Federal courts have generally recognized two main areas of public-sector honest service fraud:  [[bribery]] (direct or indirect), where a public official was paid in some way for a particular decision or action, and failure to disclose a [[conflict of interest]], resulting in personal gain.<ref name=abanet />\n\n====Necessity, or lack thereof, of state law violations====\nIn 1997, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] decided in ''United States v. Brumley'' that in order for a state official to have committed honest services fraud, he or she must have violated the state statute defining the services which were owed to the employer (the state). \n<blockquote>We find nothing to suggest that Congress was attempting in \u00a7 1346 to garner to the federal government the right to impose upon states a federal vision of appropriate services&mdash;to establish, in other words, an ethical regime for state employees. Such a taking of power would sorely tax separation of powers and erode our federalist structure. Under the most natural reading of the statute, a federal prosecutor must prove that conduct of a state official breached a duty respecting the provision of services owed to the official's employer under state law. Stated directly, the official must act or fail to act contrary to the requirements of his job under state law. This means that if the official does all that is required under state law, alleging that the services were not otherwise done \"honestly\" does not charge a violation of the mail fraud statute.<ref name=brumley>{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Brumley |vol=116 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=728 |pinpoint= |court=5th Cir. |year=1997 |url=http://www.altlaw.org/v1/cases/1076482 |quote=}}</ref></blockquote>\nHowever, the First, Fourth, [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth]], and Eleventh Circuit Courts have all held that the federal statute does not limit the meaning of \"honest services\" to violations of state law.<ref name=martindale /> As the Ninth Circuit decided in ''United States v. Weyhrauch'' in 2008, \n<blockquote>Because laws governing official conduct differ from state to state, conditioning mail fraud convictions on state law means that conduct in one state might violate the mail fraud statute, whereas identical conduct in a neighboring state would not.

Czubinski'', ruling that a mere [[workplace violation]] does not constitute fraud without evidence of depriving the employer of property in some way. Richard Czubinski was employed in [[Massachusetts]] by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] when, in 1992, he violated IRS rules by carrying out several unauthorized searches of the IRS database and accessing files outside of the course of his official duties.<ref name=\"Insiderthreat\">{{cite book|last=Cole|first=Eric|author2=Sandra Ring|title=Insider Threat: Protecting the Enterprise from Sabotage, Spying, and Theft|publisher=Syngress Publishing, Inc.|location=Rockland, Massachusetts|year=2006|isbn=1-59749-048-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3tOVQwCaKikC&pg=PA152 |accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> In 1995, he was convicted of wire fraud (defrauding the IRS of property and the public of his honest services) and [[computer fraud]]. The appellate court reversed the honest services fraud conviction on the basis that Czubinski's actions did not amount to anything more than a workplace violation, warranting no more than a dismissal:\n<blockquote>Czubinski was not bribed or otherwise influenced in any public decisionmaking capacity. Nor did he embezzle funds. He did not receive, nor can it be found that he intended to receive, any tangible benefit. ... The conclusive consideration is that the government simply did not prove that Czubinski deprived, or intended to deprive, the public or his employer of their right to his honest services. Although he clearly committed wrongdoing in searching confidential information, there is no suggestion that he failed to carry out his official tasks adequately, or intended to do so.<ref name=czubinski>{{cite court |litigants=United States v.

One, the \"reasonably foreseeable economic harm\" test, requires that the defendant intentionally breached his fiduciary duty and \"foresaw or reasonably should have foreseen\" that his actions could cause economic harm to his victim. The other, the \"materiality\" test, requires that the defendant possessed a fraudulent intent and made \"any misrepresentation that has the natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing\" the victim to change his behavior.<ref name=vinyard>{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Vinyard |vol=266 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=320 |pinpoint= |court=4th Cir. |year=2001 |url=http://openjurist.org/266/f3d/320 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n====\"Reasonably foreseeable economic harm\" test====\nIn 1997, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] held in ''United States v. Frost'' that private individuals could be also convicted of honest services fraud. Two professors at the [[University of Tennessee Space Institute]], Walter Frost and Robert Eugene Turner, were also president and vice president, respectively, of FWG Associates, a private [[atmospheric science]] research firm. Frost and Turner gave FWG reports to two of their students, one a doctoral candidate employed by the [[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]] and one a master's degree candidate employed by [[National Aeronautic and Space Administration|NASA]], allowing them to [[plagiarize]] an overwhelming majority of the reports for their respective dissertations. They also allowed another doctoral candidate, employed by NASA, to submit a dissertation which was mostly written by one of their employees at FWG. Their aim was to secure federal contracts with the agencies employing these students. All three students received their degrees, facilitated by Frost and Turner. In addition to many other charges, Frost and Turner were convicted of three counts of mail fraud for defrauding the [[University of Tennessee]] of their honest services as employees. On appeal, Frost and Turner argued that \u00a7 1346 did not apply to them because they were not public servants. The court disagreed, ruling that \"private individuals, such as Frost and Turner, may commit mail fraud by breaching a fiduciary duty and thereby depriving the person or entity to which the duty is owed of the intangible right to the honest services of that individual.\"<ref name=frost>{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Frost |vol=125 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=346 |pinpoint= |court=6th Cir. |year=1997 |url=http://openjurist.org/125/f3d/346 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn 1998, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit]] upheld the wire fraud conviction of [[Sun-Diamond Growers]] of California for defrauding its hired public relations firm of the honest services of one of its agents, James H. Lake, in order to curry favor with the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture]], [[Mike Espy]]. The corporation's vice president for corporate affairs, Richard Douglas, had acted in the scheme in such a manner that potentially could have caused economic harm to the public relations firm (tarnishing its reputation by engaging Lake in illegal activity) &ndash; he and Lake had illegally funneled contributions to a congressional candidate, Espy's brother. Sun-Diamond argued that those actions could not be criminal because there was no intent to do economic harm to the firm. However, the court ruled that an intent to do economic harm was not necessary to have committed wire fraud, affirming a pre-''McNally'' decision in light of the 1988 statute:\n<blockquote>In the private sector context, \u00a7 1346 poses special risks. Every material act of dishonesty by an employee deprives the employer of that worker's \"honest services,\" yet not every such act is converted into a federal crime by the mere use of the mails or interstate phone system. Aware of the risk that federal criminal liability could metastasize, we held in ''Lemire'' that \"not every breach of a fiduciary duty works a criminal fraud.\" ... Rather, \"[t]here must be a failure to disclose something which in the knowledge or contemplation of the employee poses an independent business risk to the employer.\" ... Sun-Diamond appears to confuse the requirement of an intent to defraud...with a requirement of intent to cause economic harm.<ref name=sundiamond>{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Sun-Diamond Growers of California |vol=138 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=961 |pinpoint= |court=D.C. Cir. |year=1998 |url=http://openjurist.org/138/f3d/961 |quote=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1999, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] adopted a similar interpretation in ''United States v. deVegter''. Michael deVegter was a financial advisor hired by [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], to craft a professional recommendation of the best [[underwriter]] for the county to hire. deVegter accepted a payment of about $42,000 from Richard Poirier in exchange for manipulating the report to influence Fulton County into hiring Poirier's investment banking firm for the underwriter job. deVegter and Poirier were both indicted for conspiracy and wire fraud, with the latter including charges under the honest services statute. The district court dismissed the honest services charges for lack of evidence before the trial began; the government appealed. The court agreed with the government that there was sufficient evidence alleged in the indictment for the defendants to be charged with honest services fraud, because the allegations showed a breach of fiduciary duty and an intent to defraud in such a manner that \"reasonably foreseeable economic harm to Fulton County\" was a consequence of the scheme.<ref name=devegter>{{cite court |litigants=United States v. deVegter |vol=198 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1324 |pinpoint= |court=11th Cir. |year=1999 |url=http://openjurist.org/198/f3d/1324 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] recognized that there were two different tests that other circuit courts had generally used to determine whether honest services fraud had been committed; in ''United States v. Vinyard'',<ref name=\"vinyard\"/> it concluded that the \"reasonably foreseeable economic harm\" test was superior (because it was based on employee intent and not employer response) and applied that test to the case at hand. The defendant in the case, Michael Vinyard, had been convicted in the [[United States District Court for the District of South Carolina]] of fourteen counts of mail fraud and twelve counts of money laundering. His brother, James Vinyard, was an employee of the Sunoco Products Corporation who was charged with finding an independent broker to research recycled [[resin]]s for their manufacture of plastic bags. The brothers instead created their own brokerage, \"Charles Stewart Enterprises,\" incorporated in the state of Iowa, and misrepresented it to Sunoco as an legitimate, independent firm that was supplying recycled resins at the lowest possible price. They purchased recycled resins from plastic vendors and, marking up the price, sold them to Sunoco, which eventually yielded $2.8 million in profits. The brothers funneled these profits from CSE to themselves through another entity in order to conceal their involvement with CSE on their tax returns. When the brothers were eventually indicted for mail fraud and money laundering, James Vinyard pleaded guilty and testified against his brother. Michael Vinyard appealed, arguing that his conviction of honest services fraud (defrauding Sunoco of the honest services of his brother, their employee) was wrongful because he did not cause harm nor did he intend to cause economic harm to the victim, Sunoco. Upholding his conviction, the court rejected this argument:\n<blockquote>The reasonably foreseeable harm test is met whenever, at the time of the fraud scheme, the employee could foresee that the scheme potentially might be detrimental to the employer's economic well-being. Furthermore, the concept of \"economic risk\" embraces the idea of risk to future opportunities for savings or profit; the focus on the employer's wellbeing encompasses both the long-term and the short-term health of the business. Whether the risk materializes or not is irrelevant; the point is that the employee has no right to endanger the employer's financial health or jeopardize the employer's long-term prospects through self-dealing. Therefore, so long as the employee could have reasonably foreseen the risk to which he was exposing the employer, the requirements of \u00a7 1346 will have been met.<ref name=vinyard /></blockquote>\n\nIn 2006, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] treated the issue of whether private defendants could be prosecuted under \u00a7 1346 as settled law, citing the numerous other circuits which had affirmed the practice. In the case ''United States v. Williams'', the defendant, John Anthony Williams, was an [[Oregon]] insurance salesman who had sold several annuities to an elderly rancher named Loyd Stubbs. When Stubbs liquidated his annuities, Williams deposited the resulting funds in a joint bank account he had opened in his and Stubbs' names. Williams proceeded to make massive cash withdrawals from the account, depositing the money in his own personal account and spending much of it; he also wired money to personal bank accounts he had in [[Belize]] and [[Louisiana]]. Williams was convicted of four counts of wire fraud, three counts of mail fraud, three counts of money laundering, and one count of foreign transportation of stolen money; the fraud charges stemmed from schemes to defraud Stubbs of money and of Williams' honest services as his financial advisor. On appeal, Williams argued that \u00a7 1346 did not apply to private commerce. The court disagreed, and, citing previous case law, ruled that within a fiduciary relationship the statute applied.<ref name=williams>{{cite court |litigants=United States v. John Anthony Williams |vol=441 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=716 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |year=2006 |url=http://openjurist.org/441/f3d/716/united-states-v-williams |quote=}}</ref>\n\n====\"Materiality\" test====\nIn 1996, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] laid out the \"materiality\" test in its decision in ''United States v. Gray''. Kevin Gray, Gary Thomas, and Troy Drummond were three members of the men's basketball coaching staff at [[Baylor University]] in [[Texas]]. These coaches helped five players, recruited from two-year colleges, to obtain the credits required for eligibility and possibly scholarships by providing these students with written course work or answers to correspondence exams, which were then sent to the sponsoring schools as the students' work. They were convicted of conspiracy, mail fraud, and wire fraud; the fraud charges stemmed from schemes to deprive Baylor University of both property (in the form of scholarships) and the coaches' honest services as Baylor employees. The court upheld the convictions, affirming the honest services fraud convictions on the basis that the coaches made \"material\" misrepresentations:\n<blockquote>A breach of fiduciary duty can constitute illegal fraud...only when there is some detriment to the employer. ... The detriment can be a deprivation of an employee's faithful and honest services if a violation of the employee's duty to disclose material information is involved. ... Materiality exists whenever \"an employee has reason to believe the information would lead a reasonable employer to change its business conduct.\" ... The information withheld, i.e. the \"coaches' cheating scheme\", was material because Baylor did not get the quality student it expected. Further, appellants failure to disclose the scheme to Baylor was material as Baylor might have been able to recruit other qualified, eligible students to play basketball. Instead, once the scheme was suspected, Baylor was forced to institute a costly investigation and the players under suspicion were withheld from competition. It is quite reasonable to believe that Baylor would have changed its business conduct had it known of the \"cheating scheme.\"<ref name=gray>{{cite court |litigants=United States v.

Cochran''. Robert M. Cochran was a bond underwriter in [[Oklahoma]] who was convicted of five counts of wire fraud, two counts of money laundering, and one count of interstate transportation of stolen property. Three of wire fraud counts for which Cochran was convicted were honest services fraud. Cochran's firm, [[Stifel Nicolaus|Stifel, Nicolaus & Company]], served as managing underwriter when the [[SSM Health Care|SSM Healthcare System]], a non-profit corporation operating several hospitals and nursing homes, issued more than $265 million of tax-exempt bonds; Sakura Global Capital bid $400,000 to provide SSM with a [[forward supply contract]]. However, SGC subsequently made a secret payment of $100,000 to Cochran's firm over the course of three wire transmissions; thus, Cochran supposedly deprived SSM and its bondholders of his honest services. The appellate court reversed his conviction, deciding that the government did not provide sufficient evidence that Cochran had actually defrauded SSM or its bondholders of his honest services, applying the \"materiality\" test:\n<blockquote>Though Stifel misrepresented that SGC would not pay an additional fee to Stifel for the forward supply contract, this information resulted in no actual or potential harm to SSM. ... No evidence independent of the alleged scheme suggests in any way that Mr. Cochran sought to harm SSM or its bondholders. Moreover, we know not from this record how SSM would have changed its conduct had the disclosure been made.<ref name=cochran>{{cite court |litigants=United States v.

Circuit's ''Sun-Diamond'' ruling in its decision in ''United States v. Pennington''. Donald B. Pennington was the president of Harvest Foods, a grocery store chain in eastern [[Arkansas]], when that company contracted with a food broker and a consultant, John Oldner, to negotiate deals between it and its suppliers. The broker and consultant both funneled a portion of their money from Harvest Foods and its supplier to Pennington &ndash; through a sham corporation, Capitol City Marketing &ndash; as [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]]. Pennington was convicted of money laundering and mail fraud; in his appeal he contended that there was insufficient evidence to convict him because the government had failed to show that he had an intent to defraud Harvest Foods of his honest services as its president. The court upheld the conviction, stating that there was sufficient evidence that his actions were a breach of his duty as a fiduciary of Harvest Foods to disclose his material interest in their contracts with Oldner and the broker. However, the court also went further and required (and found) intent to economically ''harm'': \n<blockquote>Pennington and Oldner correctly assert that, when dealing with business transactions in the private sector, a mere breach of fiduciary or employee duty may not be sufficient to deprive a client or corporation of \"honest services\" for purposes of \u00a7 1346&mdash;to be guilty of mail fraud, defendants must also cause or intend to cause actual harm or injury, and in most business contexts, that means financial or economic harm. ... However, proof of intent to harm may be inferred from the willful non-disclosure by a fiduciary, such as a corporate officer, of material information he has a duty to disclose.<ref name=pennington>{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Pennington |vol=168 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1060 |pinpoint= |court=8th Cir. |year=1999 |url=http://openjurist.org/168/f3d/1060 |quote=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2003, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], like the Fourth Circuit in ''Vinyard'', noted the existence of the two tests, but unlike the Fourth Circuit, it opted to use the \"materiality\" test (describing it as \"arising out of fundamental principles of the law of fraud\" and critiquing the alternative as \"designed simply to limit the scope\" of the law). It applied this test to the case at hand, ''United States v. Rybicki''. The defendants were two personal injury lawyers, Thomas Rybicki and Fredric Grae, in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]; both were convicted of twenty counts of mail fraud, two counts of wire fraud, and one count of conspiracy. The fraud charges pertained to a scheme to make illegal payments to insurance claims adjusters with the intent of inducing the adjusters to expedite the settlement of certain claims; Rybicki and Grae made such payments in at least twenty cases. As the acceptance of such payments by the adjusters was against the insurance companies' policies, Rybicki and Grae had defrauded those insurance companies of the honest services of their employees. Such was the basis for the successful fraud prosecution. The court affirmed the conviction, determining that all of the necessary elements for the crime of honest services fraud to have occurred were present, including material misrepresentation. The court defined the crime as follows:\n<blockquote>The phrase \"scheme or artifice [to defraud] by depriv[ing] another of the intangible right of honest services,\" in the private sector context, means a scheme or artifice to use the mails or wires to enable an officer or employee of a private entity (or a person in a relationship that gives rise to a duty of loyalty comparable to that owed by employees to employers) purporting to act for and in the interests of his or her employer (or of the other person to whom the duty of loyalty is owed) secretly to act in his or her or the defendant's own interests instead, accompanied by a material misrepresentation made or omission of information disclosed to the employer or other person.<ref name=rybicki>{{cite court |litigants=United States v.

Federal courts have generally recognized two main areas of public-sector honest service fraud:  [[bribery]] (direct or indirect), where a public official was paid in some way for a particular decision or action, and failure to disclose a [[conflict of interest]], resulting in personal gain.<ref name=abanet />\n\n====Necessity, or lack thereof, of state law violations====\nIn 1997, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] decided in ''United States v. Brumley'' that in order for a state official to have committed honest services fraud, he or she must have violated the state statute defining the services which were owed to the employer (the state). \n<blockquote>We find nothing to suggest that Congress was attempting in \u00a7 1346 to garner to the federal government the right to impose upon states a federal vision of appropriate services&mdash;to establish, in other words, an ethical regime for state employees. Such a taking of power would sorely tax separation of powers and erode our federalist structure. Under the most natural reading of the statute, a federal prosecutor must prove that conduct of a state official breached a duty respecting the provision of services owed to the official's employer under state law. Stated directly, the official must act or fail to act contrary to the requirements of his job under state law. This means that if the official does all that is required under state law, alleging that the services were not otherwise done \"honestly\" does not charge a violation of the mail fraud statute.<ref name=brumley>{{cite court |litigants=United States v.

Weyhrauch'' in 2008, \n<blockquote>Because laws governing official conduct differ from state to state, conditioning mail fraud convictions on state law means that conduct in one state might violate the mail fraud statute, whereas identical conduct in a neighboring state would not.

Czubinski'', ruling that a mere [[workplace violation]] does not constitute fraud without evidence of depriving the employer of property in some way. Richard Czubinski was employed in [[Massachusetts]] by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] when, in 1992, he violated IRS rules by carrying out several unauthorized searches of the IRS database and accessing files outside of the course of his official duties.<ref name=\"Insiderthreat\">{{cite book|last=Cole|first=Eric|author2=Sandra Ring|title=Insider Threat: Protecting the Enterprise from Sabotage, Spying, and Theft|publisher=Syngress Publishing, Inc.|location=Rockland, Massachusetts|year=2006|isbn=1-59749-048-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3tOVQwCaKikC&pg=PA152 |accessdate=5 April 2010}}</ref> In 1995, he was convicted of wire fraud (defrauding the IRS of property and the public of his honest services) and [[computer fraud]]. The appellate court reversed the honest services fraud conviction on the basis that Czubinski's actions did not amount to anything more than a workplace violation, warranting no more than a dismissal:\n<blockquote>Czubinski was not bribed or otherwise influenced in any public decisionmaking capacity. Nor did he embezzle funds. He did not receive, nor can it be found that he intended to receive, any tangible benefit. ... The conclusive consideration is that the government simply did not prove that Czubinski deprived, or intended to deprive, the public or his employer of their right to his honest services. Although he clearly committed wrongdoing in searching confidential information, there is no suggestion that he failed to carry out his official tasks adequately, or intended to do so.<ref name=czubinski>{{cite court |litigants=United States v.

One, the \"reasonably foreseeable economic harm\" test, requires that the defendant intentionally breached his fiduciary duty and \"foresaw or reasonably should have foreseen\" that his actions could cause economic harm to his victim. The other, the \"materiality\" test, requires that the defendant possessed a fraudulent intent and made \"any misrepresentation that has the natural tendency to influence or is capable of influencing\" the victim to change his behavior.<ref name=vinyard>{{cite court |litigants=United States v.

Frost'' that private individuals could be also convicted of honest services fraud. Two professors at the [[University of Tennessee Space Institute]], Walter Frost and Robert Eugene Turner, were also president and vice president, respectively, of FWG Associates, a private [[atmospheric science]] research firm. Frost and Turner gave FWG reports to two of their students, one a doctoral candidate employed by the [[United States Department of the Army|Department of the Army]] and one a master's degree candidate employed by [[National Aeronautic and Space Administration|NASA]], allowing them to [[plagiarize]] an overwhelming majority of the reports for their respective dissertations. They also allowed another doctoral candidate, employed by NASA, to submit a dissertation which was mostly written by one of their employees at FWG. Their aim was to secure federal contracts with the agencies employing these students. All three students received their degrees, facilitated by Frost and Turner. In addition to many other charges, Frost and Turner were convicted of three counts of mail fraud for defrauding the [[University of Tennessee]] of their honest services as employees. On appeal, Frost and Turner argued that \u00a7 1346 did not apply to them because they were not public servants. The court disagreed, ruling that \"private individuals, such as Frost and Turner, may commit mail fraud by breaching a fiduciary duty and thereby depriving the person or entity to which the duty is owed of the intangible right to the honest services of that individual.\"<ref name=frost>{{cite court |litigants=United States v.

Circuit]] upheld the wire fraud conviction of [[Sun-Diamond Growers]] of California for defrauding its hired public relations firm of the honest services of one of its agents, James H. Lake, in order to curry favor with the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture]], [[Mike Espy]]. The corporation's vice president for corporate affairs, Richard Douglas, had acted in the scheme in such a manner that potentially could have caused economic harm to the public relations firm (tarnishing its reputation by engaging Lake in illegal activity) &ndash; he and Lake had illegally funneled contributions to a congressional candidate, Espy's brother. Sun-Diamond argued that those actions could not be criminal because there was no intent to do economic harm to the firm. However, the court ruled that an intent to do economic harm was not necessary to have committed wire fraud, affirming a pre-''McNally'' decision in light of the 1988 statute:\n<blockquote>In the private sector context, \u00a7 1346 poses special risks. Every material act of dishonesty by an employee deprives the employer of that worker's \"honest services,\" yet not every such act is converted into a federal crime by the mere use of the mails or interstate phone system. Aware of the risk that federal criminal liability could metastasize, we held in ''Lemire'' that \"not every breach of a fiduciary duty works a criminal fraud.\" ... Rather, \"[t]here must be a failure to disclose something which in the knowledge or contemplation of the employee poses an independent business risk to the employer.\" ... Sun-Diamond appears to confuse the requirement of an intent to defraud...with a requirement of intent to cause economic harm.<ref name=sundiamond>{{cite court |litigants=United States v.

Michael deVegter was a financial advisor hired by [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], to craft a professional recommendation of the best [[underwriter]] for the county to hire. deVegter accepted a payment of about $42,000 from Richard Poirier in exchange for manipulating the report to influence Fulton County into hiring Poirier's investment banking firm for the underwriter job. deVegter and Poirier were both indicted for conspiracy and wire fraud, with the latter including charges under the honest services statute. The district court dismissed the honest services charges for lack of evidence before the trial began; the government appealed. The court agreed with the government that there was sufficient evidence alleged in the indictment for the defendants to be charged with honest services fraud, because the allegations showed a breach of fiduciary duty and an intent to defraud in such a manner that \"reasonably foreseeable economic harm to Fulton County\" was a consequence of the scheme.<ref name=devegter>{{cite court |litigants=United States v. deVegter |vol=198 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1324 |pinpoint= |court=11th Cir. |year=1999 |url=http://openjurist.org/198/f3d/1324 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] recognized that there were two different tests that other circuit courts had generally used to determine whether honest services fraud had been committed; in ''United States v. Vinyard'',<ref name=\"vinyard\"/> it concluded that the \"reasonably foreseeable economic harm\" test was superior (because it was based on employee intent and not employer response) and applied that test to the case at hand. The defendant in the case, Michael Vinyard, had been convicted in the [[United States District Court for the District of South Carolina]] of fourteen counts of mail fraud and twelve counts of money laundering. His brother, James Vinyard, was an employee of the Sunoco Products Corporation who was charged with finding an independent broker to research recycled [[resin]]s for their manufacture of plastic bags. The brothers instead created their own brokerage, \"Charles Stewart Enterprises,\" incorporated in the state of Iowa, and misrepresented it to Sunoco as an legitimate, independent firm that was supplying recycled resins at the lowest possible price. They purchased recycled resins from plastic vendors and, marking up the price, sold them to Sunoco, which eventually yielded $2.8 million in profits. The brothers funneled these profits from CSE to themselves through another entity in order to conceal their involvement with CSE on their tax returns. When the brothers were eventually indicted for mail fraud and money laundering, James Vinyard pleaded guilty and testified against his brother. Michael Vinyard appealed, arguing that his conviction of honest services fraud (defrauding Sunoco of the honest services of his brother, their employee) was wrongful because he did not cause harm nor did he intend to cause economic harm to the victim, Sunoco. Upholding his conviction, the court rejected this argument:\n<blockquote>The reasonably foreseeable harm test is met whenever, at the time of the fraud scheme, the employee could foresee that the scheme potentially might be detrimental to the employer's economic well-being. Furthermore, the concept of \"economic risk\" embraces the idea of risk to future opportunities for savings or profit; the focus on the employer's wellbeing encompasses both the long-term and the short-term health of the business. Whether the risk materializes or not is irrelevant; the point is that the employee has no right to endanger the employer's financial health or jeopardize the employer's long-term prospects through self-dealing. Therefore, so long as the employee could have reasonably foreseen the risk to which he was exposing the employer, the requirements of \u00a7 1346 will have been met.<ref name=vinyard /></blockquote>\n\nIn 2006, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] treated the issue of whether private defendants could be prosecuted under \u00a7 1346 as settled law, citing the numerous other circuits which had affirmed the practice. In the case ''United States v. Williams'', the defendant, John Anthony Williams, was an [[Oregon]] insurance salesman who had sold several annuities to an elderly rancher named Loyd Stubbs. When Stubbs liquidated his annuities, Williams deposited the resulting funds in a joint bank account he had opened in his and Stubbs' names. Williams proceeded to make massive cash withdrawals from the account, depositing the money in his own personal account and spending much of it; he also wired money to personal bank accounts he had in [[Belize]] and [[Louisiana]]. Williams was convicted of four counts of wire fraud, three counts of mail fraud, three counts of money laundering, and one count of foreign transportation of stolen money; the fraud charges stemmed from schemes to defraud Stubbs of money and of Williams' honest services as his financial advisor. On appeal, Williams argued that \u00a7 1346 did not apply to private commerce. The court disagreed, and, citing previous case law, ruled that within a fiduciary relationship the statute applied.<ref name=williams>{{cite court |litigants=United States v. John Anthony Williams |vol=441 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=716 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |year=2006 |url=http://openjurist.org/441/f3d/716/united-states-v-williams |quote=}}</ref>\n\n====\"Materiality\" test====\nIn 1996, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit]] laid out the \"materiality\" test in its decision in ''United States v. Gray''. Kevin Gray, Gary Thomas, and Troy Drummond were three members of the men's basketball coaching staff at [[Baylor University]] in [[Texas]]. These coaches helped five players, recruited from two-year colleges, to obtain the credits required for eligibility and possibly scholarships by providing these students with written course work or answers to correspondence exams, which were then sent to the sponsoring schools as the students' work. They were convicted of conspiracy, mail fraud, and wire fraud; the fraud charges stemmed from schemes to deprive Baylor University of both property (in the form of scholarships) and the coaches' honest services as Baylor employees. The court upheld the convictions, affirming the honest services fraud convictions on the basis that the coaches made \"material\" misrepresentations:\n<blockquote>A breach of fiduciary duty can constitute illegal fraud...only when there is some detriment to the employer. ... The detriment can be a deprivation of an employee's faithful and honest services if a violation of the employee's duty to disclose material information is involved. ... Materiality exists whenever \"an employee has reason to believe the information would lead a reasonable employer to change its business conduct.\" ... The information withheld, i.e. the \"coaches' cheating scheme\", was material because Baylor did not get the quality student it expected. Further, appellants failure to disclose the scheme to Baylor was material as Baylor might have been able to recruit other qualified, eligible students to play basketball. Instead, once the scheme was suspected, Baylor was forced to institute a costly investigation and the players under suspicion were withheld from competition. It is quite reasonable to believe that Baylor would have changed its business conduct had it known of the \"cheating scheme.\"<ref name=gray>{{cite court |litigants=United States v.

Cochran''. Robert M. Cochran was a bond underwriter in [[Oklahoma]] who was convicted of five counts of wire fraud, two counts of money laundering, and one count of interstate transportation of stolen property. Three of wire fraud counts for which Cochran was convicted were honest services fraud. Cochran's firm, [[Stifel Nicolaus|Stifel, Nicolaus & Company]], served as managing underwriter when the [[SSM Health Care|SSM Healthcare System]], a non-profit corporation operating several hospitals and nursing homes, issued more than $265 million of tax-exempt bonds; Sakura Global Capital bid $400,000 to provide SSM with a [[forward supply contract]]. However, SGC subsequently made a secret payment of $100,000 to Cochran's firm over the course of three wire transmissions; thus, Cochran supposedly deprived SSM and its bondholders of his honest services. The appellate court reversed his conviction, deciding that the government did not provide sufficient evidence that Cochran had actually defrauded SSM or its bondholders of his honest services, applying the \"materiality\" test:\n<blockquote>Though Stifel misrepresented that SGC would not pay an additional fee to Stifel for the forward supply contract, this information resulted in no actual or potential harm to SSM. ... No evidence independent of the alleged scheme suggests in any way that Mr. Cochran sought to harm SSM or its bondholders. Moreover, we know not from this record how SSM would have changed its conduct had the disclosure been made.<ref name=cochran>{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Cochran |vol=109 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=660 |pinpoint= |court=10th Cir. |year=1997 |url=http://openjurist.org/109/f3d/660 |quote=}}\n</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1999, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]] diverged from the D.C. Circuit's ''Sun-Diamond'' ruling in its decision in ''United States v. Pennington''. Donald B. Pennington was the president of Harvest Foods, a grocery store chain in eastern [[Arkansas]], when that company contracted with a food broker and a consultant, John Oldner, to negotiate deals between it and its suppliers. The broker and consultant both funneled a portion of their money from Harvest Foods and its supplier to Pennington &ndash; through a sham corporation, Capitol City Marketing &ndash; as [[Kickback (bribery)|kickbacks]]. Pennington was convicted of money laundering and mail fraud; in his appeal he contended that there was insufficient evidence to convict him because the government had failed to show that he had an intent to defraud Harvest Foods of his honest services as its president. The court upheld the conviction, stating that there was sufficient evidence that his actions were a breach of his duty as a fiduciary of Harvest Foods to disclose his material interest in their contracts with Oldner and the broker. However, the court also went further and required (and found) intent to economically ''harm'': \n<blockquote>Pennington and Oldner correctly assert that, when dealing with business transactions in the private sector, a mere breach of fiduciary or employee duty may not be sufficient to deprive a client or corporation of \"honest services\" for purposes of \u00a7 1346&mdash;to be guilty of mail fraud, defendants must also cause or intend to cause actual harm or injury, and in most business contexts, that means financial or economic harm. ... However, proof of intent to harm may be inferred from the willful non-disclosure by a fiduciary, such as a corporate officer, of material information he has a duty to disclose.<ref name=pennington>{{cite court |litigants=United States v. Pennington |vol=168 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1060 |pinpoint= |court=8th Cir. |year=1999 |url=http://openjurist.org/168/f3d/1060 |quote=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2003, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]], like the Fourth Circuit in ''Vinyard'', noted the existence of the two tests, but unlike the Fourth Circuit, it opted to use the \"materiality\" test (describing it as \"arising out of fundamental principles of the law of fraud\" and critiquing the alternative as \"designed simply to limit the scope\" of the law). It applied this test to the case at hand, ''United States v. Rybicki''. The defendants were two personal injury lawyers, Thomas Rybicki and Fredric Grae, in the state of [[New York (state)|New York]]; both were convicted of twenty counts of mail fraud, two counts of wire fraud, and one count of conspiracy. The fraud charges pertained to a scheme to make illegal payments to insurance claims adjusters with the intent of inducing the adjusters to expedite the settlement of certain claims; Rybicki and Grae made such payments in at least twenty cases. As the acceptance of such payments by the adjusters was against the insurance companies' policies, Rybicki and Grae had defrauded those insurance companies of the honest services of their employees. Such was the basis for the successful fraud prosecution. The court affirmed the conviction, determining that all of the necessary elements for the crime of honest services fraud to have occurred were present, including material misrepresentation. The court defined the crime as follows:\n<blockquote>The phrase \"scheme or artifice [to defraud] by depriv[ing] another of the intangible right of honest services,\" in the private sector context, means a scheme or artifice to use the mails or wires to enable an officer or employee of a private entity (or a person in a relationship that gives rise to a duty of loyalty comparable to that owed by employees to employers) purporting to act for and in the interests of his or her employer (or of the other person to whom the duty of loyalty is owed) secretly to act in his or her or the defendant's own interests instead, accompanied by a material misrepresentation made or omission of information disclosed to the employer or other person.<ref name=rybicki>{{cite court |litigants=United States v.

It is located in the [[Jura mountains]] at an altitude of 1000 m, a few kilometers south of the French border. After [[Geneva]], [[Lausanne]] and [[Fribourg]], it is the fourth largest city located in the [[Romandie]], the French-speaking part of the country, with a population ({{as of|{{Swiss populations YM|CH-NE}}|lc=on}}) of {{Swiss populations|CH-NE|6421}}.{{Swiss populations ref|CH-NE}}\n\nThe city was founded in 1656. Its growth and prosperity is mainly bound up with the watch-making industry. It is the most important centre of the watch making industry in the area known as the [[Watch Valley]]. Partially destroyed by a fire in 1794, La Chaux-de-Fonds was rebuilt following a grid street plan, which was and is still original among Swiss cities, the only exception being the easternmost section of the city, which was spared of fire. This creates an interesting and obvious transition from the old section to the newer section. The roads in the original section are very narrow and winding, which then opens up to the grid pattern near the town square. The famous architect [[Le Corbusier]], the writer [[Blaise Cendrars]] and the car maker [[Louis Chevrolet]] were born there. La Chaux-de-Fonds is a renowned centre of [[Art nouveau]].\n\nIn 2009, La Chaux-de-Fonds and [[Le Locle]], its sister city, were jointly awarded [[UNESCO World Heritage status]] for their exceptional universal value.\n\n== UNESCO World Heritage Sites ==\nThe watch-making cities of La Chaux-de-Fonds and [[Le Locle]] have jointly received recognition from UNESCO for their exceptional universal value.\n\nThe Site's planning consists of two small cities located close to each other in the mountainous environment of the Swiss Jura. Due to the altitude ({{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=x| [|]}}) and the lack of water (porous sandstone underground), the land is ill-suited to farming. Planning and buildings reflect the watch-making artisans need for rational organization. Rebuilt in the early 19th century, after extensive fires, both towns owe their survival to the [[manufacturing]] and [[export]]s of [[watch]]es, to which, in the 20th century, was added the minute [[Microtechnology|micromechanic]]al [[industry]].\n\nAlong an open-ended scheme of parallel strips on which residential housing and workshops intermingle, the town's planned lay-out reflects the needs of the local watch-making culture that dates back to the 17th century, and which is still alive today. Both agglomerations present outstanding examples of mono-industrial manufacturing-towns, which are still well-preserved and active. The urban planning has accommodated the transition from the artisans\u2019 production of a [[cottage industry]] to the more concentrated [[factory]]  production of the late 19th and 20th centuries.\nIn 1867 [[Karl Marx]] was already describing La Chaux-de-Fonds as a \u201chuge factory-town\u201d in ''[[Das Kapital]]'', where he analyzed the [[division of labour]] in the watch-making industry of the Jura.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1302 UNESCO world heritage site]</ref>\n\nIt is the tenth Swiss Site to be awarded World Heritage status, joining others such as the [[Old City of Bern]], the [[Rhaetian Railway]] and the [[Abbey of Saint Gall|Abbey and Convent of St. Gallen]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:La chaux de fond1-ag.jpg|thumb|left|City of La Chaux-de-Fonds in winter]]\nThe region was first inhabited around 10,000 years ago ([[Mesolithic]]). A skull and other traces have been found in [[caves]] nearby.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nIn the middle of the 14th century, the region was colonized from the southern Val-de-Ruz.  La Chaux-de-Fonds is first mentioned in 1350 as ''la Chaz de Fonz''.  In 1378 it was mentioned as ''Chault de Font''.<ref name=HDS>{{HDS|2837|La Chaux-de-Fonds}}</ref>\n\nThe region was under the authority of the lords of Valangin.  In the 15th and 16th centuries, a second wave of colonization came from the so-called ''Clos de la Franchise'' (the valleys of Le Locle and La Sagne).  Agriculture was the main activity but the village remained small.  In 1531 there were only about 35 people living there. The first church was built in 1528. By 1530,  La Chaux-de-Fonds, like the rest of the Valangin lands, converted to the new [[Protestant Reformation|Reformed]] faith.  The  Lord of Valanginian, Ren\u00e9 de Challant, fixed the boundaries of the parish in 1550. The church and parish provided a political structure and a small community of Valanginian citizens, free farmers and peasants grew up around the church.  By 1615 there were 355 people living in the village.  In 1616, the [[High, middle and low justice|low and middle jurisdiction]] over La Chaux-de-Fonds moved to Le Locle and La Sagne, while the high court remained in Valanginian.  The agriculture, supplemented by mills on the banks of the Doubs, continued to dominate. However, at the end of the 16th century, the city became an important crossroad between [[Neuch\u00e2tel]], [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]] and the [[Bishopric of Basel]].<ref name=HDS/>\n\nThe community grew during the [[Thirty Years' War]], mainly because of its strategic position for trade. Economic activity accelerated in the 18th century with the development of the city's [[lace]] and [[watch]]making industries. [[Pierre Jacquet-Droz]], best known for his [[automata]], was a particularly prominent watchmaker of this era.\n\nIn 1794, the city was devastated by fire. Charles-Henri Junod created the new city's plan in 1835, and the city is now known for its \"modern,\" grid-like plan, in comparison with most European cities' meandering streets.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nmXS12Lo0xMC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0 The Le Corbusier Guide], Google Books</ref><ref>[http://www.myswitzerland.com/en.cfm/home/citytrips/offer-Destinations_Resorts-Short%20City%20Breaks-306145.html La Chaux-de-Fonds et le Locle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205065756/http://www.myswitzerland.com/en.cfm/home/citytrips/offer-Destinations%5FResorts-Short%20City%20Breaks-306145.html |date=5 December 2008 }}, Swiss Tourism Site</ref> The central avenue is named the Avenue [[Louis L\u00e9opold Robert|L\u00e9opold Robert]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Chaux-de-Fonds Umgebung.jpg|thumb|La Chaux-de-Fonds and surroundings]]\nLa Chaux-de-Fonds has an area, {{as of|2009|lc=on}}, of {{convert|55.7|km2|mi2|sp=us}}.

It is located in the [[Jura mountains]] at an altitude of 1000 m, a few kilometers south of the French border. After [[Geneva]], [[Lausanne]] and [[Fribourg]], it is the fourth largest city located in the [[Romandie]], the French-speaking part of the country, with a population ({{as of|{{Swiss populations YM|CH-NE}}|lc=on}}) of {{Swiss populations|CH-NE|6421}}.{{Swiss populations ref|CH-NE}}\n\nThe city was founded in 1656. Its growth and prosperity is mainly bound up with the watch-making industry. It is the most important centre of the watch making industry in the area known as the [[Watch Valley]]. Partially destroyed by a fire in 1794, La Chaux-de-Fonds was rebuilt following a grid street plan, which was and is still original among Swiss cities, the only exception being the easternmost section of the city, which was spared of fire. This creates an interesting and obvious transition from the old section to the newer section. The roads in the original section are very narrow and winding, which then opens up to the grid pattern near the town square. The famous architect [[Le Corbusier]], the writer [[Blaise Cendrars]] and the car maker [[Louis Chevrolet]] were born there. La Chaux-de-Fonds is a renowned centre of [[Art nouveau]].\n\nIn 2009, La Chaux-de-Fonds and [[Le Locle]], its sister city, were jointly awarded [[UNESCO World Heritage status]] for their exceptional universal value.\n\n== UNESCO World Heritage Sites ==\nThe watch-making cities of La Chaux-de-Fonds and [[Le Locle]] have jointly received recognition from UNESCO for their exceptional universal value.\n\nThe Site's planning consists of two small cities located close to each other in the mountainous environment of the Swiss Jura. Due to the altitude ({{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=x| [|]}}) and the lack of water (porous sandstone underground), the land is ill-suited to farming. Planning and buildings reflect the watch-making artisans need for rational organization. Rebuilt in the early 19th century, after extensive fires, both towns owe their survival to the [[manufacturing]] and [[export]]s of [[watch]]es, to which, in the 20th century, was added the minute [[Microtechnology|micromechanic]]al [[industry]].\n\nAlong an open-ended scheme of parallel strips on which residential housing and workshops intermingle, the town's planned lay-out reflects the needs of the local watch-making culture that dates back to the 17th century, and which is still alive today. Both agglomerations present outstanding examples of mono-industrial manufacturing-towns, which are still well-preserved and active. The urban planning has accommodated the transition from the artisans\u2019 production of a [[cottage industry]] to the more concentrated [[factory]]  production of the late 19th and 20th centuries.\nIn 1867 [[Karl Marx]] was already describing La Chaux-de-Fonds as a \u201chuge factory-town\u201d in ''[[Das Kapital]]'', where he analyzed the [[division of labour]] in the watch-making industry of the Jura.<ref>[https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1302 UNESCO world heritage site]</ref>\n\nIt is the tenth Swiss Site to be awarded World Heritage status, joining others such as the [[Old City of Bern]], the [[Rhaetian Railway]] and the [[Abbey of Saint Gall|Abbey and Convent of St. Gallen]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:La chaux de fond1-ag.jpg|thumb|left|City of La Chaux-de-Fonds in winter]]\nThe region was first inhabited around 10,000 years ago ([[Mesolithic]]). A skull and other traces have been found in [[caves]] nearby.<ref name=HDS/>\n\nIn the middle of the 14th century, the region was colonized from the southern Val-de-Ruz.  La Chaux-de-Fonds is first mentioned in 1350 as ''la Chaz de Fonz''.  In 1378 it was mentioned as ''Chault de Font''.<ref name=HDS>{{HDS|2837|La Chaux-de-Fonds}}</ref>\n\nThe region was under the authority of the lords of Valangin.  In the 15th and 16th centuries, a second wave of colonization came from the so-called ''Clos de la Franchise'' (the valleys of Le Locle and La Sagne).  Agriculture was the main activity but the village remained small.  In 1531 there were only about 35 people living there. The first church was built in 1528. By 1530,  La Chaux-de-Fonds, like the rest of the Valangin lands, converted to the new [[Protestant Reformation|Reformed]] faith.  The  Lord of Valanginian, Ren\u00e9 de Challant, fixed the boundaries of the parish in 1550. The church and parish provided a political structure and a small community of Valanginian citizens, free farmers and peasants grew up around the church.  By 1615 there were 355 people living in the village.  In 1616, the [[High, middle and low justice|low and middle jurisdiction]] over La Chaux-de-Fonds moved to Le Locle and La Sagne, while the high court remained in Valanginian.  The agriculture, supplemented by mills on the banks of the Doubs, continued to dominate. However, at the end of the 16th century, the city became an important crossroad between [[Neuch\u00e2tel]], [[Franche-Comt\u00e9]] and the [[Bishopric of Basel]].<ref name=HDS/>\n\nThe community grew during the [[Thirty Years' War]], mainly because of its strategic position for trade. Economic activity accelerated in the 18th century with the development of the city's [[lace]] and [[watch]]making industries. [[Pierre Jacquet-Droz]], best known for his [[automata]], was a particularly prominent watchmaker of this era.\n\nIn 1794, the city was devastated by fire. Charles-Henri Junod created the new city's plan in 1835, and the city is now known for its \"modern,\" grid-like plan, in comparison with most European cities' meandering streets.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nmXS12Lo0xMC&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0 The Le Corbusier Guide], Google Books</ref><ref>[http://www.myswitzerland.com/en.cfm/home/citytrips/offer-Destinations_Resorts-Short%20City%20Breaks-306145.html La Chaux-de-Fonds et le Locle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205065756/http://www.myswitzerland.com/en.cfm/home/citytrips/offer-Destinations%5FResorts-Short%20City%20Breaks-306145.html |date=5 December 2008 }}, Swiss Tourism Site</ref> The central avenue is named the Avenue [[Louis L\u00e9opold Robert|L\u00e9opold Robert]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Chaux-de-Fonds Umgebung.jpg|thumb|La Chaux-de-Fonds and surroundings]]\nLa Chaux-de-Fonds has an area, {{as of|2009|lc=on}}, of {{convert|55.7|km2|mi2|sp=us}}.

The [[Abbasid caliph]], [[Harun al-Rashid]] ({{reign|786|809}}), who sought to promote himself as a champion of ''[[jihad]]'', decided to lead in person a retaliatory attack with the objective of punishing the Byzantines and impressing Abassid might upon their emperor.\n\nHarun assembled his army at [[Raqqa]] in northern Syria. Medieval historians record numbers to be as high as 135,000 or even 300,000 men. While these are clearly exaggerated, it is clear that the Abbasid force assembled for the invasion was far larger than anything seen before. The Abbasid army set out from Raqqa on 11 June 806, crossed the coastal region of [[Cilicia]], and the [[Taurus Mountains]]; invaded the Byzantine province of [[Cappadocia]]. The Abbasids met no opposition and raided at will, capturing several towns and fortresses. Celebrated in Arab histories was the siege, fall, and sack of the city of [[Heraclea Cybistra|Herakleia]]; its name was later given to a victory monument erected by the Caliph near Raqqa. The Byzantine losses forced Nikephoros to seek peace terms in which he offered a resumption of tribute payments in exchange for the Abbasids' withdrawal. However, this time Harun exacted an additional [[jizya|personal tax]] levied on the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], as a token of their submission to the Caliph.\n\nAlmost immediately following Harun's departure, Nikephoros violated the peace terms by refortifying the sacked frontier forts and stopping tribute payments. However, Harun's preoccupation with a rebellion in [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], and his death three years later, prevented a reprisal on a similar scale to 806. Smaller-scale raids continued on both sides, but the [[Fourth Fitna|Abbasid civil war]], which began after 809, and the Byzantine preoccupation with the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] contributed to a cessation of large-scale [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars|Arab\u2013Byzantine conflict]] for the next two decades.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]] of Byzantine empress [[Irene of Athens]] in October 802 and the accession of [[Nikephoros I]] in her place marked the start of a more violent phase in the long history of the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]. Following a series of destructive annual raids into Byzantine [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], Irene apparently secured a truce with Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 798 in exchange for the annual payment of [[tribute]], repeating the terms agreed for a three-year truce after Harun's [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (782)|first large-scale campaign]] into Asia Minor in 782.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=113}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1. Historical background}} Nikephoros, on the other hand, was more warlike\u2014a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] source records that when he learned of Nikephoros's accession, a [[Elpidius (rebel)|Byzantine renegade]] warned the Abbasid governor of [[Upper Mesopotamia]] to \"throw away his [[silk]] and put on his armour\".

In the summer of the same year, he launched the first Byzantine raid in two decades against the Arab frontier districts or [[al-Awasim|''thugh\u016br'']] in Cilicia. The Byzantine army raided the territory surrounding the fortresses of [[Mopsuestia]] and [[Anazarbus]] and took prisoners as it went. The garrison of Mopsuestia attacked the Byzantine force and recovered most of the prisoners and spoils, but the Byzantines marched on to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], which had been refortified and repopulated on Harun's orders in 786 to strengthen the Muslim hold on Cilicia.

As the historian [[Warren Treadgold]] writes, if the Byzantines had been successful in this endeavour, \"garrisoning Tarsus and Melitene would have partly blocked the main Arab invasion routes across the Taurus into the Byzantine heartland, to the Byzantines' great benefit\". On the other hand, Nikephoros was certainly aware of the huge superiority of the Caliphate in men and resources, and it is more likely that he intended this campaign simply as a show of strength and a test of his enemy's resolve.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=139}}\n\n==Campaign==\nHaving settled matters in Khurasan by confirming Ibn Mahan in his governorship,{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=253\u2013254}} Harun returned to the west in November 805 and prepared a huge retaliatory expedition for 806, drawing men from [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Medieval Persia|Persia]], and [[Medieval Egypt|Egypt]].

The city was plundered and razed, and its inhabitants enslaved and deported to the Caliphate.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=661}} The fall of Herakleia was considered by the Arab chroniclers the most significant achievement of Harun's expeditions against the Byzantines,{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=356}} and is the central event in the narratives of Harun's retaliatory campaign against Nikephoros. As the historian [[Marius Canard]] remarks, \"for the Arabs the capture of Herakleia had an impact as profound as the [[Sack of Amorium]] in 838\", which is completely at odds with the city's actual importance. Indeed, the Byzantine sources do not place any particular emphasis on the fall of Herakleia compared to the other fortresses captured during Harun's 806 campaign.{{efn|name=fn2|There is at least some indication in the Arab sources that a different course was suggested to the Caliph: Harun is said to have asked two leaders from the frontier region on whether he should attack Herakleia. The first replied that it was the strongest fortress, and that if it fell, no-one would be able to oppose them, but the second replied that the city would yield little booty, and that he should attack a more important city. However, during the course of the siege he is said to have changed his mind and encouraged Harun to persist with the siege, when the Caliph was thinking of abandoning it.{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=364}}}}{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=378}}\n\nAt the same time, on Cyprus, Humayd ravaged the island and took some 16,000 Cypriots, including the [[Archbishop of Cyprus|local archbishop]], captive to Syria, where they were sold as slaves.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=662}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=145}}\n\nNikephoros, outnumbered and threatened by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] in his rear, could not resist the Abbasid onslaught.

In the end, with the harrowing possibility of the Arabs wintering on Byzantine soil in Tyana, he sent three [[cleric]]s as ambassadors: [[Michael of Synnada|Michael]], the bishop of [[Synnada]], [[Peter of Goulaion|Peter]], the abbot of the [[monastery]] of Goulaion, and Gregory, the steward of the metropolis of [[Amastris (city)|Amastris]]. Harun agreed to peace in exchange for the payment of an annual tribute (30,000 [[gold]] ''[[solidus (coin)|nomismata]]'', according to Theophanes, 50,000 according to al-Tabari), but the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], were to pay a humiliating personal poll-tax (''[[jizya]]'') of three gold coins each to the Caliph (four and two respectively, in Tabari's version), thereby acknowledging themselves as the Caliph's subjects. In addition, Nikephoros promised not to rebuild the dismantled forts. Harun then recalled his forces from their various sieges and evacuated Byzantine territory.{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

The Byzantines raided the region of [[Marash]] in return, while in late summer Humayd launched a major naval raid, which pillaged [[Rhodes]] and reached as far as the [[Peloponnese]], where it may have fomented a [[Siege of Patras (805 or 807)|rebellion]] among the local [[Slavs]].

In general terms, they were content with the territorial limits achieved, and whatever external campaigns they waged were retaliatory or pre-emptive, meant to preserve their frontier and impress Abbasid might upon their neighbours.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|p=302}} At the same time, the campaigns against Byzantium in particular were important for domestic consumption. The annual raids were a symbol of the continuing ''[[jihad]]'' of the early Muslim state and were the only external expeditions where the Caliph or his sons participated in person. They were closely paralleled in official [[propaganda]] by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (''[[hajj]]'') to [[Mecca]], highlighting the dynasty's leading role in the religious life of the Muslim community.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|pp=278\u2013279}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=105\u2013106}} Harun al-Rashid in particular actively strove to embody this duty: he was said to have alternated between leading the ''hajj'' one year and attacking Byzantium the next.{{sfn|El-Cheikh|2004|pp=89\u201390}} The hitherto unseen extent of his personal involvement in the ''jihad'' converted it into a central tenet of his conception of the caliphate, leading modern historians to consider Harun as the creator of a new type of model ruler, the \"''ghazi''-caliph\".{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=xvii}}{{sfn|Bonner|1996|pp=99\u2013106}}{{sfn|Haug|2011|pp=637\u2013638}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144, 146}} In that regard, the Abbasid campaign was certainly a success: after 806, the Byzantine ruler abandoned whatever expansionist plans he may have had for the eastern border and focused his energy on his fiscal reforms, the recovery of the [[Balkans]], and his wars there against the Bulgars, which would end with his death in the disastrous [[Battle of Pliska]] in 811.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=168\u2013174}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=146, 157\u2013174}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 3.

Shaban]] considers the campaign a \"limited success\" at best, and criticizes Harun's \"single-minded\" attention to the Byzantines as a \"totally misguided effort\". According to Shaban, not only did the Byzantines have no real ability (or intention) to seriously threaten the Caliphate, but Harun's recruitment drive led to the influx of eastern soldiers from Khurasan, which antagonized the traditional Syrian\u2013Iraqi military elites and created rifts that contributed to the [[Fourth Fitna]], the Abbasid civil war that broke out after Harun's death.{{sfn|Shaban|1976|pp=32, 38\u201339}} This conflict, between Harun's sons [[al-Amin]] ({{reign|809|813}}) and [[al-Ma'mun]] ({{reign|813|833}}), meant that the Abbasid Caliphate was not able to exploit the Byzantine reversals in the Balkans. Indeed, the 806 campaign and the ineffectual raids of 807 mark the last major, centrally organized, Abbasid expeditions against Byzantium for over twenty years.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=157}} Isolated raids and counter-raids continued at land as well as at sea, and, independently of the Abbasids, local Muslim leaders [[Emirate of Crete|conquered Crete]] and launched the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|conquest of Sicily]] in the 820s.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=127\u2013128}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=183, 219\u2013220, 248\u2013257}} Nevertheless, large-scale operations over the land border in eastern Anatolia between the two empires resumed only after the accession of Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] ({{reign|829|842}}), whose confrontations with the caliphs al-Ma'mun and [[al-Mu'tasim]] ({{reign|833|842}}) culminated in the great invasions by al-Ma'mun in 830\u2013833, and the Sack of Amorium by al-Mu'tasim in 838.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=128\u2013131}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=272\u2013275, 278\u2013281, 292\u2013305}}\n\n[[File:Heraqla,SE.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Photo of a mound of ruins in a barren field|View of the remnants of ''Hiraqla'', a victory monument erected by Harun after the campaign of 806]]\nThe longest-lasting impact of Harun's campaign is found in literature. Among the Arabs, several legends or anecdotes, related by sources such as [[al-Masudi]] and the ''[[Kitab al-Aghani]]'', were associated with it, emphasizing the city's strong fortifications, describing a single combat between a Byzantine and an Arab champion which was decided when the Arab captured the Byzantine by using a [[lasso]], or the terror inspired among the defenders by the Abbasid army's use of large catapults throwing [[Greek fire]]-like substances.{{sfn|Canard|1962|pp=363\u2013372}} The [[Ottoman Turks]] also placed great importance on Harun's battles with the Byzantines. The account of the 17th-century Ottoman traveller [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] mixes the events of Harun's 782 campaign, when the Arab army had reached the [[Bosporus]], with those of 806, as well as introducing clearly fictional elements such as the manner of Nikephoros' death. According to Evliya, Harun besieged Constantinople twice. The first time the Caliph withdrew, after securing as much land as an oxhide could cover and building a fortress there, in an imitation of the ancient tale of [[Dido|Queen Dido]]. The second time, Harun marched on Constantinople to avenge the massacre of Muslims living there, and ordered Nikephoros executed by hanging at the [[Hagia Sophia]].{{sfn|Canard|1926|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nTo commemorate his successful campaign, Harun built a victory monument about {{convert|8|km|mi|sigfig=1}} west of Raqqa, his principal residence.

The expedition took place in southeastern and central [[Asia Minor]], where the Abbasid and Byzantine empires shared a long land border.\n\nUpon coming to the throne, the [[Byzantine emperor]] [[Nikephoros I]] ({{reign|802|811}}) ceased paying the [[tribute]] agreed to by his predecessors with the Caliphate, and launched attacks on the Abbasid [[al-Awasim|frontier regions]]. The [[Abbasid caliph]], [[Harun al-Rashid]] ({{reign|786|809}}), who sought to promote himself as a champion of ''[[jihad]]'', decided to lead in person a retaliatory attack with the objective of punishing the Byzantines and impressing Abassid might upon their emperor.\n\nHarun assembled his army at [[Raqqa]] in northern Syria. Medieval historians record numbers to be as high as 135,000 or even 300,000 men. While these are clearly exaggerated, it is clear that the Abbasid force assembled for the invasion was far larger than anything seen before. The Abbasid army set out from Raqqa on 11 June 806, crossed the coastal region of [[Cilicia]], and the [[Taurus Mountains]]; invaded the Byzantine province of [[Cappadocia]]. The Abbasids met no opposition and raided at will, capturing several towns and fortresses. Celebrated in Arab histories was the siege, fall, and sack of the city of [[Heraclea Cybistra|Herakleia]]; its name was later given to a victory monument erected by the Caliph near Raqqa. The Byzantine losses forced Nikephoros to seek peace terms in which he offered a resumption of tribute payments in exchange for the Abbasids' withdrawal. However, this time Harun exacted an additional [[jizya|personal tax]] levied on the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], as a token of their submission to the Caliph.\n\nAlmost immediately following Harun's departure, Nikephoros violated the peace terms by refortifying the sacked frontier forts and stopping tribute payments. However, Harun's preoccupation with a rebellion in [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasan]], and his death three years later, prevented a reprisal on a similar scale to 806. Smaller-scale raids continued on both sides, but the [[Fourth Fitna|Abbasid civil war]], which began after 809, and the Byzantine preoccupation with the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] contributed to a cessation of large-scale [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars|Arab\u2013Byzantine conflict]] for the next two decades.\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Deposition (politics)|deposition]] of Byzantine empress [[Irene of Athens]] in October 802 and the accession of [[Nikephoros I]] in her place marked the start of a more violent phase in the long history of the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]]. Following a series of destructive annual raids into Byzantine [[Asia Minor]] by the [[Abbasid Caliphate]], Irene apparently secured a truce with Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] in 798 in exchange for the annual payment of [[tribute]], repeating the terms agreed for a three-year truce after Harun's [[Abbasid invasion of Asia Minor (782)|first large-scale campaign]] into Asia Minor in 782.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=113}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1. Historical background}} Nikephoros, on the other hand, was more warlike\u2014a [[Syriac language|Syriac]] source records that when he learned of Nikephoros's accession, a [[Elpidius (rebel)|Byzantine renegade]] warned the Abbasid governor of [[Upper Mesopotamia]] to \"throw away his [[silk]] and put on his armour\". In addition, the new emperor was determined to refill the treasury by, among other measures, ceasing the tribute.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=127, 130}}\n\n[[File:Solidus-Nicephorus I and Staraucius-sb1604.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Obverse and reverse of a medieval gold coin, showing the busts of a bearded crowned man and of a younger crowned man|Gold ''[[solidus (coin)|nomisma]]'' of Emperor [[Nikephoros I]] (left) and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]] (right)]]\nIn retaliation for the cessation of tribute and the violation of the peace agreement concluded with Irene, Harun launched a raid under his son [[al-Qasim ibn Harun al-Rashid|al-Qasim]] in spring 803.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=238\u2013239}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=131}} Nikephoros could not respond to this, as he faced a large-scale revolt of the Byzantine army of Asia Minor under its commander-in-chief, [[Bardanes Tourkos]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=131\u2013133}} After disposing of Bardanes, Nikephoros assembled his army and marched out to meet a second, larger invasion under the Caliph in person. After Harun raided the frontier region, the two armies faced one another for two months in central Asia Minor, but it did not come to a battle: Nikephoros and Harun exchanged letters,{{efn|[[Al-Tabari]] and other Muslim sources record the texts, supposedly of Nikephoros' letter demanding the return of the tribute paid until then, and Harun's brief reply to Nikephoros, calling him \"the dog of the Byzantines\" (''kalb [[R\u00fbm|al-Rum]]''): \"O son of an infidel woman, I have read your letter, and the reply is what you will see, without you having to hear it.

Nikephoros set out to confront the Arabs, but was surprised and heavily defeated at the [[Battle of Krasos]], where he barely escaped with his life.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 1.

In the summer of the same year, he launched the first Byzantine raid in two decades against the Arab frontier districts or [[al-Awasim|''thugh\u016br'']] in Cilicia. The Byzantine army raided the territory surrounding the fortresses of [[Mopsuestia]] and [[Anazarbus]] and took prisoners as it went. The garrison of Mopsuestia attacked the Byzantine force and recovered most of the prisoners and spoils, but the Byzantines marched on to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]], which had been refortified and repopulated on Harun's orders in 786 to strengthen the Muslim hold on Cilicia. The city fell and the entire garrison was taken captive.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=126}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=261\u2013262}}\n\nAt the same time, another Byzantine force raided the [[Upper Mesopotamia]]n ''thugh\u016br'' and unsuccessfully besieged the fortress of [[Melitene]], while a Byzantine-instigated rebellion against the local Arab garrison began in [[Cyprus]], which for over a century had been an Arab\u2013Byzantine [[condominium (international law)|condominium]].{{efn|In 688, Emperor [[Justinian II]] and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad caliph]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] concluded an agreement whereby Cyprus became a neutral territory, its tax revenue shared between Byzantium and the Caliphate, and its ports open to both powers, including for military purposes against one another. Apart from a brief Byzantine reoccupation under [[Basil I]], this status lasted until 965, when the island was reincorporated into the Byzantine Empire.{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Cyprus\" (T. E. Gregory), pp. 567\u2013569}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=135, 138\u2013139}}\n\nThis sudden resumption of Byzantine offensive activity greatly alarmed Harun, especially as he received reports that Nikephoros was planning similar attacks for the next year, which this time would aim at the full reoccupation of these frontier territories. As the historian [[Warren Treadgold]] writes, if the Byzantines had been successful in this endeavour, \"garrisoning Tarsus and Melitene would have partly blocked the main Arab invasion routes across the Taurus into the Byzantine heartland, to the Byzantines' great benefit\". On the other hand, Nikephoros was certainly aware of the huge superiority of the Caliphate in men and resources, and it is more likely that he intended this campaign simply as a show of strength and a test of his enemy's resolve.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=139}}\n\n==Campaign==\nHaving settled matters in Khurasan by confirming Ibn Mahan in his governorship,{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=253\u2013254}} Harun returned to the west in November 805 and prepared a huge retaliatory expedition for 806, drawing men from [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]], [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], [[Medieval Persia|Persia]], and [[Medieval Egypt|Egypt]]. According to [[al-Tabari]], his army numbered 135,000 regular troops and additional volunteers and [[Filibuster (military)|freebooters]].{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=99, 106}} These numbers are easily the largest ever recorded for the entire Abbasid era,{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=99, 106}} and about half as many as the estimated strength of the entire [[Byzantine army]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=144}} Although they\u2014and the even more fantastic claims of the Byzantine chronicler [[Theophanes the Confessor]] of 300,000 men\u2014are certainly exaggerated, they are nevertheless indicative of the size of the Abbasid force.{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=99, 106}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|pp=661, 662 (note 5)}}  At the same time, a naval force under his admiral [[Humayd ibn Ma'yuf al-Hajuri]] was prepared to raid Cyprus.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=144}}\n\n[[File:Arab-Byzantine frontier zone.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Geophysical map of eastern Anatolia and northern Syria, showing the main fortresses during the Arab\u2013Byzantine frontier wars|Map of the Byzantine\u2013Arab frontier zone in southeastern [[Asia Minor]], where the Abbasid campaign of 806 took place]]\nThe huge invasion army departed Harun's residence of [[Raqqa]] in northern Syria on 11 June 806, with the Caliph at its head. Al-Tabari reports that Harun put on a cap with the inscription \"Warrior for the Faith and Pilgrim\" (in Arabic, \"''[[Ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]]'', ''[[hajj]]''\"). The Abbasids crossed Cilicia, where Harun ordered Tarsus to be rebuilt, and entered Byzantine [[Cappadocia]] through the [[Cilician Gates]]. Harun marched to [[Tyana]], which at the time seems to have been abandoned. There, he began to establish his base of operations, ordering [[Uqbah ibn Ja'far al-Khuza'i]] to refortify the town and erect a [[mosque]].{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144\u2013145}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=262\u2013263}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

The city was plundered and razed, and its inhabitants enslaved and deported to the Caliphate.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=661}} The fall of Herakleia was considered by the Arab chroniclers the most significant achievement of Harun's expeditions against the Byzantines,{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=356}} and is the central event in the narratives of Harun's retaliatory campaign against Nikephoros. As the historian [[Marius Canard]] remarks, \"for the Arabs the capture of Herakleia had an impact as profound as the [[Sack of Amorium]] in 838\", which is completely at odds with the city's actual importance. Indeed, the Byzantine sources do not place any particular emphasis on the fall of Herakleia compared to the other fortresses captured during Harun's 806 campaign.{{efn|name=fn2|There is at least some indication in the Arab sources that a different course was suggested to the Caliph: Harun is said to have asked two leaders from the frontier region on whether he should attack Herakleia. The first replied that it was the strongest fortress, and that if it fell, no-one would be able to oppose them, but the second replied that the city would yield little booty, and that he should attack a more important city. However, during the course of the siege he is said to have changed his mind and encouraged Harun to persist with the siege, when the Caliph was thinking of abandoning it.{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=364}}}}{{sfn|Canard|1962|p=378}}\n\nAt the same time, on Cyprus, Humayd ravaged the island and took some 16,000 Cypriots, including the [[Archbishop of Cyprus|local archbishop]], captive to Syria, where they were sold as slaves.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=262}}{{sfn|Mango|Scott|1997|p=662}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=145}}\n\nNikephoros, outnumbered and threatened by the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgars]] in his rear, could not resist the Abbasid onslaught. He campaigned himself at the head of his army and seemingly won a few minor engagements against isolated detachments, but stayed well clear of the main Abbasid forces. In the end, with the harrowing possibility of the Arabs wintering on Byzantine soil in Tyana, he sent three [[cleric]]s as ambassadors: [[Michael of Synnada|Michael]], the bishop of [[Synnada]], [[Peter of Goulaion|Peter]], the abbot of the [[monastery]] of Goulaion, and Gregory, the steward of the metropolis of [[Amastris (city)|Amastris]]. Harun agreed to peace in exchange for the payment of an annual tribute (30,000 [[gold]] ''[[solidus (coin)|nomismata]]'', according to Theophanes, 50,000 according to al-Tabari), but the Emperor and his son and heir, [[Staurakios]], were to pay a humiliating personal poll-tax (''[[jizya]]'') of three gold coins each to the Caliph (four and two respectively, in Tabari's version), thereby acknowledging themselves as the Caliph's subjects. In addition, Nikephoros promised not to rebuild the dismantled forts. Harun then recalled his forces from their various sieges and evacuated Byzantine territory.{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 2.

According to al-Tabari,\n{{quote|[Harun] ordered the slave girl to be sought out; she was brought back, adorned with finery and installed on a seat in the tent in which he himself was lodging. The slave girl and the tent, together with its contents, vessels and fittings, were handed over to Nikephoros's envoy. He also sent to Nikephoros the perfume which he had requested, and he further sent to him dates, dishes of jellied sweets, raisins and healing drugs.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=264}}}}\n\nNikephoros returned the favour by dispatching a horse laden with 50,000 silver coins, 100 [[satin]] garments, 200 garments of fine [[brocade]], 12 [[falcon]]s, four hunting dogs, and three more horses.{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=264}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=146}} But as soon as the Arabs had withdrawn, the Emperor again restored the frontier forts and thereafter ceased the payment of tribute.

The larger summer raid under [[Harthama ibn A'yan]] was met by Nikephoros in person, and after an indecisive battle both sides retreated. The Byzantines raided the region of [[Marash]] in return, while in late summer Humayd launched a major naval raid, which pillaged [[Rhodes]] and reached as far as the [[Peloponnese]], where it may have fomented a [[Siege of Patras (805 or 807)|rebellion]] among the local [[Slavs]]. On his return, however, Humayd lost several ships to a storm, and on the Peloponnese, the Slavic revolt was put down after failing to capture the city of [[Patras]] during the siege of 805.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=147\u2013148}}{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|pp=267\u2013268}} The failure of the year's Abbasid efforts were compounded by the outbreak of [[Rafi ibn al-Layth]]'s rebellion in Khurasan, which forced Harun to depart again for the East. The Caliph concluded a new truce, and another prisoner exchange was held at the Lamos in 808. Nikephoros was thus left with his gains, both the restored frontier fortifications and the cessation of tribute, intact.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=155}}\n\n==Impact==\n[[File:Arabische Eroberung 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Multi-color map of the Mediterranean and the Middle East, showing the phases of Muslim expansion to the 10th century|Map of the [[spread of Islam]] during the 7th and 8th centuries and of the [[Muslim world]] under the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] and early [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] caliphates, from the {{Interlanguage link|Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas|de|lt=''Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas''}} of [[Johann Gustav Droysen]] (1886)]]\n\nHarun's massive expedition achieved remarkably little in material terms. Despite the sack of Herakleia, and its prominent treatment in Arab sources, no permanent result was achieved, as Nikephoros was quick to violate the terms of the truce.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=146}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 3. Consequences}} According to the historian Warren Treadgold, if Harun had taken the advice offered by one of his lieutenants to proceed further west and sack a major city, he might have inflicted more long-lasting damage on Byzantium,{{efn|name=fn2}} but the Caliph's objectives were more limited: Harun was content with a show of force that would intimidate Nikephoros and prevent him from repeating the offensive of 805, and which bolstered his credentials as a champion of Islam.{{efn|name=fn1|In contrast with their Umayyad predecessors, the Abbasid caliphs pursued a conservative foreign policy. In general terms, they were content with the territorial limits achieved, and whatever external campaigns they waged were retaliatory or pre-emptive, meant to preserve their frontier and impress Abbasid might upon their neighbours.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|p=302}} At the same time, the campaigns against Byzantium in particular were important for domestic consumption. The annual raids were a symbol of the continuing ''[[jihad]]'' of the early Muslim state and were the only external expeditions where the Caliph or his sons participated in person. They were closely paralleled in official [[propaganda]] by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (''[[hajj]]'') to [[Mecca]], highlighting the dynasty's leading role in the religious life of the Muslim community.{{sfn|El-Hibri|2010|pp=278\u2013279}}{{sfn|Kennedy|2001|pp=105\u2013106}} Harun al-Rashid in particular actively strove to embody this duty: he was said to have alternated between leading the ''hajj'' one year and attacking Byzantium the next.{{sfn|El-Cheikh|2004|pp=89\u201390}} The hitherto unseen extent of his personal involvement in the ''jihad'' converted it into a central tenet of his conception of the caliphate, leading modern historians to consider Harun as the creator of a new type of model ruler, the \"''ghazi''-caliph\".{{sfn|Bosworth|1989|p=xvii}}{{sfn|Bonner|1996|pp=99\u2013106}}{{sfn|Haug|2011|pp=637\u2013638}}}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=144, 146}} In that regard, the Abbasid campaign was certainly a success: after 806, the Byzantine ruler abandoned whatever expansionist plans he may have had for the eastern border and focused his energy on his fiscal reforms, the recovery of the [[Balkans]], and his wars there against the Bulgars, which would end with his death in the disastrous [[Battle of Pliska]] in 811.{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=168\u2013174}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=146, 157\u2013174}}{{sfn|Kiapidou|2002|loc=\u00a7 3. Consequences}}\n\nOn the other hand, the historian [[M. A. Shaban]] considers the campaign a \"limited success\" at best, and criticizes Harun's \"single-minded\" attention to the Byzantines as a \"totally misguided effort\". According to Shaban, not only did the Byzantines have no real ability (or intention) to seriously threaten the Caliphate, but Harun's recruitment drive led to the influx of eastern soldiers from Khurasan, which antagonized the traditional Syrian\u2013Iraqi military elites and created rifts that contributed to the [[Fourth Fitna]], the Abbasid civil war that broke out after Harun's death.{{sfn|Shaban|1976|pp=32, 38\u201339}} This conflict, between Harun's sons [[al-Amin]] ({{reign|809|813}}) and [[al-Ma'mun]] ({{reign|813|833}}), meant that the Abbasid Caliphate was not able to exploit the Byzantine reversals in the Balkans. Indeed, the 806 campaign and the ineffectual raids of 807 mark the last major, centrally organized, Abbasid expeditions against Byzantium for over twenty years.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|p=127}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|p=157}} Isolated raids and counter-raids continued at land as well as at sea, and, independently of the Abbasids, local Muslim leaders [[Emirate of Crete|conquered Crete]] and launched the [[Muslim conquest of Sicily|conquest of Sicily]] in the 820s.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=127\u2013128}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=183, 219\u2013220, 248\u2013257}} Nevertheless, large-scale operations over the land border in eastern Anatolia between the two empires resumed only after the accession of Emperor [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] ({{reign|829|842}}), whose confrontations with the caliphs al-Ma'mun and [[al-Mu'tasim]] ({{reign|833|842}}) culminated in the great invasions by al-Ma'mun in 830\u2013833, and the Sack of Amorium by al-Mu'tasim in 838.{{sfn|Brooks|1923|pp=128\u2013131}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1988|pp=272\u2013275, 278\u2013281, 292\u2013305}}\n\n[[File:Heraqla,SE.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|alt=Photo of a mound of ruins in a barren field|View of the remnants of ''Hiraqla'', a victory monument erected by Harun after the campaign of 806]]\nThe longest-lasting impact of Harun's campaign is found in literature. Among the Arabs, several legends or anecdotes, related by sources such as [[al-Masudi]] and the ''[[Kitab al-Aghani]]'', were associated with it, emphasizing the city's strong fortifications, describing a single combat between a Byzantine and an Arab champion which was decided when the Arab captured the Byzantine by using a [[lasso]], or the terror inspired among the defenders by the Abbasid army's use of large catapults throwing [[Greek fire]]-like substances.{{sfn|Canard|1962|pp=363\u2013372}} The [[Ottoman Turks]] also placed great importance on Harun's battles with the Byzantines. The account of the 17th-century Ottoman traveller [[Evliya \u00c7elebi]] mixes the events of Harun's 782 campaign, when the Arab army had reached the [[Bosporus]], with those of 806, as well as introducing clearly fictional elements such as the manner of Nikephoros' death. According to Evliya, Harun besieged Constantinople twice. The first time the Caliph withdrew, after securing as much land as an oxhide could cover and building a fortress there, in an imitation of the ancient tale of [[Dido|Queen Dido]]. The second time, Harun marched on Constantinople to avenge the massacre of Muslims living there, and ordered Nikephoros executed by hanging at the [[Hagia Sophia]].{{sfn|Canard|1926|pp=103\u2013104}}\n\nTo commemorate his successful campaign, Harun built a victory monument about {{convert|8|km|mi|sigfig=1}} west of Raqqa, his principal residence. Known as ''{{ill|Hiraqla|de|Heraqla}}'' in local tradition, apparently after Herakleia, it comprises a square structure with sides {{convert|100|m|ft}} long, surrounded by a circular wall about {{convert|500|m|ft}} in diameter, pierced by four gates in the cardinal directions. The main structure, built from stone taken from churches demolished on Harun's orders in 806\u2013807, has four vaulted halls on the ground floor, and ramps leading to an upper storey, which was left incomplete on Harun's departure for Khurasan and subsequent death.{{sfn|Meinecke|1995|p=412}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{The History of al-Tabari | volume = 30 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wqf1gwM9O58C}}\n* {{cite book | last = Bonner | first = Michael | title = Aristocratic Violence and Holy War: Studies in the Jihad and the Arab\u2013Byzantine Frontier | year = 1996 | publisher = American Oriental Society | location = New Haven, Connecticut | isbn = 0-940490-11-0  | ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book | last=Brooks | first=E.
