in his first season, he helped the senior side win the title and earn promotion to [[Serie A]], establishing himself as a promising prospect in the number 10 role. After struggling to break into the starting line-up however, he spent successful stints on loan with Italian clubs [[Empoli F.C.|Empoli]] and [[Parma F.C.|Parma]], where he matured as a player, before earning a move back to Juventus in 2012. Upon his return to the Turin club, he won two consecutive league titles, but once again struggled to maintain a spot in the team's starting eleven. This resulted in a high-profile move to [[Toronto FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]] in early [[2015 Major League Soccer season|2015]], in a deal which made him the league's highest paid player.\n\nAfter joining the Canadian club, Giovinco soon established himself as one of the best players in MLS. During his first year with the club, he broke several league records, including the record for most combined goals and assists in a single season, also helping Toronto FC to qualify for the [[MLS Cup Playoffs]] for the first time in the club's history, and winning himself the [[MLS Golden Boot]], the [[MLS Newcomer of the Year Award]], and the [[Landon Donovan MVP Award|MLS MVP Award]]. In 2016, he won his first title with Toronto FC, the [[2016 Canadian Championship]], and became the club's [[List of Toronto FC records and statistics#Goalscorers|all-time top goalscorer]], helping the club to qualify for the Playoffs once again, reaching the [[MLS Cup 2016|MLS Cup Final]]. In 2017, he won his second Canadian Championship, winning the [[George Gross Memorial Trophy]] for the best player of the competition, captured the [[Supporters' Shield]], and also won the [[2017 MLS Cup]] with Toronto FC \u2013 for a [[domestic treble]]. In 2018, Giovinco helped Toronto FC reach the final of the [[2018 CONCACAF Champions League|CONCACAF Champions League]], and was awarded the [[2018 CONCACAF Champions League#Awards|Golden Ball]] as the tournament's best player, also capturing his third consecutive Canadian Championship with the club, although Toronto FC failed to qualify for the Playoffs. In 2019, he joined Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, where he won the [[AFC Champions League]] in his first year with the team.\n\nAt international level, Giovinco has represented Italy at all levels since first being called up by the [[Italy national under-16 football team|under-16 side]] in 2003; at youth level, he took part at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2008 Summer Olympics]] with the Italian under-23 side, and later helped the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy under-21]] side to the semi-finals of the [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]]. He made his debut with the Italy senior side in 2011, and has since collected over 20 caps; he later also took part at [[UEFA Euro 2012]] (winning a runners-up medal) and at the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]] (winning a bronze medal), and scored his first international goal during the latter tournament.\n\n==Early life==\nGiovinco was born in [[Turin]] to a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] father, Giovanni, originally from [[Bisacquino]] in the [[province of Palermo]], and a [[Calabria]]n mother, Elvira, originally from [[Catanzaro]], who moved from [[Mezzogiorno|Southern Italy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.j1897.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=81175&pid=2972035&st=0&#entry2972035|publisher=J1897.com|accessdate=15 September 2007|title=Sebastian Giovinco Complete Interview|date=1 April 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106230636/http://www.j1897.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=81175&pid=2972035&st=0&#entry2972035|archivedate=6 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He grew up in [[Beinasco]], a ''[[comune]]'' southwest of the city, in a family of [[A.C.

first team after his success with the club's youth squad; in his first season, he helped the senior side win the title and earn promotion to [[Serie A]], establishing himself as a promising prospect in the number 10 role. After struggling to break into the starting line-up however, he spent successful stints on loan with Italian clubs [[Empoli F.C.|Empoli]] and [[Parma F.C.|Parma]], where he matured as a player, before earning a move back to Juventus in 2012. Upon his return to the Turin club, he won two consecutive league titles, but once again struggled to maintain a spot in the team's starting eleven. This resulted in a high-profile move to [[Toronto FC]] of [[Major League Soccer]] in early [[2015 Major League Soccer season|2015]], in a deal which made him the league's highest paid player.\n\nAfter joining the Canadian club, Giovinco soon established himself as one of the best players in MLS. During his first year with the club, he broke several league records, including the record for most combined goals and assists in a single season, also helping Toronto FC to qualify for the [[MLS Cup Playoffs]] for the first time in the club's history, and winning himself the [[MLS Golden Boot]], the [[MLS Newcomer of the Year Award]], and the [[Landon Donovan MVP Award|MLS MVP Award]]. In 2016, he won his first title with Toronto FC, the [[2016 Canadian Championship]], and became the club's [[List of Toronto FC records and statistics#Goalscorers|all-time top goalscorer]], helping the club to qualify for the Playoffs once again, reaching the [[MLS Cup 2016|MLS Cup Final]]. In 2017, he won his second Canadian Championship, winning the [[George Gross Memorial Trophy]] for the best player of the competition, captured the [[Supporters' Shield]], and also won the [[2017 MLS Cup]] with Toronto FC \u2013 for a [[domestic treble]]. In 2018, Giovinco helped Toronto FC reach the final of the [[2018 CONCACAF Champions League|CONCACAF Champions League]], and was awarded the [[2018 CONCACAF Champions League#Awards|Golden Ball]] as the tournament's best player, also capturing his third consecutive Canadian Championship with the club, although Toronto FC failed to qualify for the Playoffs. In 2019, he joined Saudi Arabian club Al Hilal, where he won the [[AFC Champions League]] in his first year with the team.\n\nAt international level, Giovinco has represented Italy at all levels since first being called up by the [[Italy national under-16 football team|under-16 side]] in 2003; at youth level, he took part at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2008 Summer Olympics]] with the Italian under-23 side, and later helped the [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy under-21]] side to the semi-finals of the [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]]. He made his debut with the Italy senior side in 2011, and has since collected over 20 caps; he later also took part at [[UEFA Euro 2012]] (winning a runners-up medal) and at the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]] (winning a bronze medal), and scored his first international goal during the latter tournament.\n\n==Early life==\nGiovinco was born in [[Turin]] to a [[Sicily|Sicilian]] father, Giovanni, originally from [[Bisacquino]] in the [[province of Palermo]], and a [[Calabria]]n mother, Elvira, originally from [[Catanzaro]], who moved from [[Mezzogiorno|Southern Italy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.j1897.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=81175&pid=2972035&st=0&#entry2972035|publisher=J1897.com|accessdate=15 September 2007|title=Sebastian Giovinco Complete Interview|date=1 April 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106230636/http://www.j1897.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=81175&pid=2972035&st=0&#entry2972035|archivedate=6 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He grew up in [[Beinasco]], a ''[[comune]]'' southwest of the city, in a family of [[A.C.

I have done everything to help him but the reality is that he plays in a league [the MLS] that doesn't count for much, and the number of goals he scores is less important because with the quality he has got, he is bound to make a difference in that league. The problem is that if you play in that type of league, and you get used to playing in that type of league, it becomes a problem of mentality.

It took place in the middle of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s second term in office. All 435 seats of the House were up for election. Those elected served in the [[110th United States Congress]] from January 3, 2007, until January 3, 2009. The incumbent majority party, the Republicans, had won majorities in the House consecutively since [[1994 United States House elections|1994]], and were defeated by the Democrats who won a majority in the chamber, ending 12 years of Republican control in the House.\n\nThe [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] had won a 232-seat majority in 2004. By the time of the 2006 election, they held 229 seats, while the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] held 201, plus [[Bernie Sanders|1]] [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] who caucused with the Democrats. There were also four vacancies. Republicans held a 28-seat advantage, and Democrats needed to pick up 15 seats to take control of the House, which had had a Republican majority since January 1995. The public's perception of [[George W. Bush]], the handling of the war in Iraq, and a series of political scandals involving mostly congressional Republicans took their toll on the party at the ballot box.<ref name=\"TM030614\">{{cite news\n | title = So Why Did the Democrats Win?\n | work = [[Time Magazine]]\n | date = November 15, 2006\n | url = http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1559793,00.html\n | accessdate = March 6, 2014\n}}</ref>\n\nThe final result was a 31-seat pickup for the Democrats, including the pickup of the Vermont at-large seat, previously held by Independent [[Bernie Sanders]] (who [[2006 United States Senate election in Vermont|ran]] instead for U.S. Senate), who caucused with the Democrats.

an independent was picked up by a Democrat. No Democratic seats were picked up by Republicans.\n\n* '''{{ushr|Arizona|5|}}''': Early in the cycle, incumbent [[J. D. Hayworth]] (R) appeared on his way to an easy reelection. However, his seat may have become more competitive after the [[Mark Foley scandal|Congressional Page scandal]] broke. Democrats fielded a locally well-known candidate in State Senator [[Harry Mitchell]], a former Mayor of [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]]. Mitchell has been a political force in his home town, one of the largest communities in the district, and Democrats became enthusiastic about his candidacy. The 5th leans Republican, but not overwhelmingly. The district includes, in addition to Tempe, [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], the prime real estate of the Phoenix area. On election night, Mitchell defeated Hayworth, 50% to 46%.\n\n[[File:Arizona 8th district campaign signs 2006 election.jpg|right|thumb|Campaign signs including for Graf (R), Giffords (D) and Quick (I)]]\n\n* '''{{ushr|Arizona|8|}}''': Incumbent [[Jim Kolbe]] (R) announced on November 23, 2005, that he would not seek re-election in 2006.{{citation needed | date=January 2014}} His district, located in Southeastern Arizona and based in the suburbs of [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], is Republican-leaning, but competitive: President Bush won the district with 53% of the vote in 2004 (although only 50% in 2000). The Democratic primary in September was won by former State Senator [[Gabrielle Giffords]], who resigned from the [[Arizona Legislature]] on December 1, 2005, in preparation for the campaign. [[Randy Graf]], a former state Representative who lost to Kolbe in the 2004 primary, won the September 2006 Republican primary. He defeated current state Representative Steve Huffman, whom both Kolbe and the National Republican Congressional Committee supported. The NRCC reportedly became concerned that Graf (a supporter of the [[Minuteman Project]], and a sponsor of an unsuccessful bill that would let patrons carry guns into bars and restaurants), was too conservative to win the district. The NRCC committed $122,000 for a television ad in support of Huffman, which ran the week before the primary. The Democratic party shared that assessment \u2014 prior to the primary, it spent nearly $200,000, \"a large part of that for advertisements critical of Mr. Huffman in an effort to help Mr. Graf's candidacy.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/11/us/politics/11arizona.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=In Cost and Vitriol, Race in Arizona Draws Notice | first=Randal C. | last=Archibold | date=September 11, 2006 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref> In late September, the national GOP canceled about $1 million in advertising support.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/0922graf0922.html | title=GOP cancels $1 mil in Graf ad support | first=Jon | last=Kamman | website=The Arizona Republic | date=September 22, 2006}}</ref> [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] [[David Nolan (Libertarian Party)|David Nolan]] and independent Jay Quick also ran for the seat.

However, Pombo became associated with the ethical and legal scandals revolving around Jack Abramoff and became the subject of an investigation, which eroded his popular support. In addition, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' listed him as one of the ten worst congressmen. The Democratic candidate who garnered the 39% in 2004, [[Jerry McNerney]], joined that race as a write-in candidate two weeks before the primary election. In 2006, McNerney was challenged in the primary by [[Steve Filson]]. Filson was backed by the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] but was upset by McNerney in the primary.

His retirement to make an unsuccessful run for [[Governor of Colorado]] made this seat highly competitive. The 7th District is located in the northern and eastern [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] suburbs. State education chairman Rick O'Donnell was unopposed for the Republican nomination, while State Senator [[Ed Perlmutter]] won a three-way Democratic primary. On election night, Perlmutter won Beauprez's old seat as expected, 55% to 42%. (For details, see [[2006 Colorado's 7th congressional district election]].)\n* '''{{ushr|Connecticut|2|}}''': Incumbent [[Rob Simmons]] (R), a [[Vietnam War]] veteran and former [[CIA]] agent, won reelection by 54% to 46% in 2004, in a Democratic-leaning district encompassing eastern Connecticut, including [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]] and [[New London, Connecticut|New London]]. The 2002 nominee, former state Representative [[Joe Courtney (politician)|Joe Courtney]], decided to make another run. Even though in the past Simmons had been able to win elections in the Democratic-leaning district by painting himself as a moderate, the seat is perennially competitive. The results were so close on election night that the race was not settled until a week later. A recount was completed on November 14, 2006, with the final results giving Joe Courtney an 83-vote victory over Rob Simmons.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nbc30.com/politics/10318760/detail.html | title=Recount Gives Courtney Win In 2nd District | work=[[NBC Connecticut]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927180058/http://www.nbc30.com/politics/10318760/detail.html | archivedate=September 27, 2007}}</ref> It was the closest house race of 2006.\n* '''{{ushr|Connecticut|5|}}''': Although incumbent [[Nancy Johnson (politician)|Nancy Johnson]] (R) won with at least 60% of the vote in 2004 and faced a difficult challenge (running against a fellow incumbent in a redrawn district) in 2002, winning with just 54%, she was still a Republican in a swing district. While the 5th is Connecticut's most conservative region, John Kerry won the district by about 1100 votes in [[U.S. presidential election, 2004 presidential election|2004]] and [[Al Gore]] won it when Johnson represented it as the 6th District in [[U.S. presidential election, 2000 presidential election|2000]]. The district is located in Northwestern Connecticut and includes a large portion of [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], the wealthy western suburbs of [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], and small rural towns. Johnson faced a credible challenge from state Senator [[Chris Murphy (Connecticut politician)|Chris Murphy]]. She was popular in the district, but with Bush's rating in New England at rock bottom, a Democratic victory was possible. Early in the cycle, this race was considered the least competitive of the three Republican-held seats in Connecticut, but Murphy defeated Johnson on election night, winning 56% to 44%.\n* '''{{ushr|Florida|16|}}''': This Republican-leaning South Florida district, which includes [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]] and [[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]] on the state's east coast, and [[Port Charlotte, Florida|Port Charlotte]] on the west coast, was represented by [[Mark Foley]], head of the Missing and Exploited Children's Caucus. However, Foley resigned September 29, 2006, due to revelations of inappropriate contacts of a sexual nature with underage male congressional pages. The scandal immediately ballooned to include the Republican leadership's involvement in a possible cover-up, and it soon brought down Republicans nationwide. Florida law bars state parties from replacing candidates on the ballot. Within the district, the scandal created strong backlash against any Republican replacement due to Foley's name remaining on the ballot, and, by extension, made the race, which had earlier been written off by most as a \"safe\" Republican seat, highly competitive. Businessman [[Tim Mahoney]], a surprisingly well-funded challenger in a seemingly uncompetitive race, quickly became favored to win. The Republican replacement, businessman [[Joe Negron]], ran an effective \"Punch Foley for Negron\" campaign, but lost in a closer than expected race, with 48% to Mahoney's 49%.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/states/FL/H/16/index.html | title=U.S. House of Representatives / Florida 16 | work=America Votes 2006 | publisher=[[CNN]]}}<br/>[http://election.dos.state.fl.us/elections/resultsarchive/Index.asp?ElectionDate=11/7/2006&DATAMODE= Official results] from Florida Secretary of State</ref>\n* '''{{ushr|Florida|22|}}''': Republican [[E. Clay Shaw Jr.|E. Clay Shaw]] had been in Congress since 1981, and had represented the 22nd District since 1993. The district voted for John Kerry over George Bush in 2004, but re-elected Shaw with 63% against a last minute replacement Democrat. In 2000, Shaw won a close race by 599 votes in a district that Al Gore won by 4%, but in 2002, he was redistricted into a slightly less Democratic district and scored an easy victory. The district includes wealthy areas of [[Palm Beach County]] and [[Broward County]] including [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]] and parts of [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] The revelation that Shaw was being treated for a second time for lung cancer may have affected his re-election chances. This year, Shaw faced a challenge from well-funded state senator [[Ron Klein]]. Klein won on election day 51% to 47%.\n* '''{{ushr|Indiana|2|}}''': [[Chris Chocola]] (R) was first elected in 2002 by a 50% to 46% margin. Democrat [[Joe Donnelly]], who lost to Chocola 54% to 45% in 2004, ran again in 2006. Democrats blamed Donnelly's 2004 loss on a lack of funding from the national party that allowed Chocola to outspend Donnelly by a two-to-one margin. President Bush visited the [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]]-centered district seven times between 2000 and 2006, suggesting that Chocola was vulnerable. Chocola's popularity was also affected by the unpopularity of GOP Governor [[Mitch Daniels]]; among other things, Daniels decided to lease a toll road that runs through the district to a foreign corporation. Daniels also pushed to move the entire state to [[daylight saving time]], which was opposed by local residents. In the campaign, Chocola attacked Donnelly for being delinquent in paying property taxes. On election night, Donnelly defeated Chocola 54% to 46%.\n* '''{{ushr|Indiana|8|}}''': [[John Hostettler]] (R), who had only a 34% approval rating, was challenged by [[Vanderburgh County, Indiana|Vanderburgh County]] Sheriff [[Brad Ellsworth]] in this swing district that includes [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]] and [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]]. Hostettler had a history of winning tough reelections, but Ellsworth was considered to be his strongest opponent. The district has been nicknamed \"The Bloody Eighth\" due to its frequent ousting of incumbent congressmen, which has occurred in 1958, 1966, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1994, and 2006. Despite the competitive nature of the district, Hostettler was traditionally slow to raise money and lagged far behind his opponent in fundraising totals throughout the election. Rumors circulated in September that Hostettler had essentially given up on his campaign when he failed to hold any events on [[Labor Day]] weekend, the traditional kickoff of the campaign season. In the end, Ellsworth defeated Hostettler by a 61%\u201339% margin, the most lopsided loss for a House incumbent since 1994.\n* '''{{ushr|Indiana|9|}}''': In 2004, incumbent [[Mike Sodrel]] (R) defeated then-incumbent [[Baron Hill (politician)|Baron Hill]] by only 1,425 votes, the smallest winning percentage in any congressional race that year.<ref name=\"15059501.htm\">{{cite news | last=Lee | first=Mara | date=July 2, 2006 | url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2006/jul/02/candidates-cash-in-on-celebrities/?print=1 | title=Candidates cash in on celebrities | newspaper=[[Evansville Courier & Press]]}}</ref> Hill ran in 2006 to reclaim his seat in this Southeast Indiana district that includes [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] and [[New Albany, Indiana|New Albany]]. He defeated anti-war challenger [[Gretchen Clearwater]] in the May 2 primary. Factors cited in the race included Sodrel being a self-described staunch Republican Party loyalist in an evenly divided district, Hill lacking the advantages of incumbency in 2006, and (according to Democrats) Hill's superior constituent service compared to Sodrel's. Hill defeated Sodrel 50% to 46%.\n* '''{{ushr|Iowa|1|}}''': Incumbent [[Jim Nussle]] (R) left his seat in Congress to run for governor. This district is Democratic-leaning, and of the open seats was one of the most likely to change hands. It contains most of northeastern [[Iowa]] including large cities such as [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]], the [[Quad Cities]] and [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]]. Nussle had been reelected in 2000 and 2004 with 55% of the vote but Al Gore and John Kerry won the district in those same years. In 2006, businessman Mike Whalen won the Republican nomination while attorney [[Bruce Braley]] was the Democratic nominee. Braley defeated Whalen 55 percent to 43 percent. (For details, see [[2006 Iowa's 1st congressional district election]].)\n* '''{{ushr|Iowa|2|}}''': Incumbent [[Jim Leach]] (R) received 59% of the vote in 2004. Before the election, this was the most Democratic seat held by a Republican, as measured by presidential candidates' performances in the district. However, Leach had consistently won here since 1976, helped by his reputation for strong integrity. Also helping him was his status as one of the most liberal Republicans in the House. As a result, Leach traditionally won large numbers of crossover votes from Democrats and was expected to do so again. The Democrats nominated [[David Loebsack]], a political science professor at small [[Cornell College]] in [[Mount Vernon, Iowa]]. Despite Leach's appeal and seniority, Loebsack prevailed on election night by a 51% to 49% margin. Leach's defeat made him the most senior House member to lose re-election in 2006 and the most senior member to lose re-election since 36-year incumbent [[Phil Crane]] lost in 2004 in an upset to [[Melissa Bean]].\n* '''{{ushr|Kansas|2|}}''': Incumbent [[Jim Ryun]] (R), a leading conservative, won re-election by 56% to 41% in 2004 and had held his seat for five terms. This year, Ryun faced a rematch with Democrat [[Nancy Boyda]], who also ran against him in 2004. The district is home to [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Manhattan, Kansas|Manhattan]] (location of [[Kansas State University]]), [[Leavenworth, Kansas|Leavenworth]], [[Pittsburg, Kansas|Pittsburg]], and half of the liberal college town of [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], home of the [[University of Kansas]]. Despite being held by Ryun, the seat had a history of electing Democrats and before 1994, Democrats held the seat for 20 out of 24 years. However, [[gerrymandering]] had made the seat tilt more Republican, and Ryun was thought to be secure. However, Ryun faced controversy over a Washington, D.C. real estate purchase, and in the wake of scandals that rocked Washington, D.C., this had a major effect on local voters, far more than had been expected. Boyda was also helped by the reelection of popular Democratic Governor [[Kathleen Sebelius]]. Boyda defeated the incumbent Ryun 51% to 47%, in one of the most shocking results of the night.\n* '''{{ushr|Kentucky|3|}}''': Incumbent [[Anne Northup]] (R) had been a target for the Democrats since her election in 1996; in 2004 and 2000, John Kerry and Al Gore both won her [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]-centered congressional district by two percent, and [[Bill Clinton]] won the district by double-digit margins during the 1990s. While Northup had generally run close races, she won 60% of the vote in the 2004 election. [[Redistricting]] after the 2000 census added a few more suburban Republicans to the district, according to ''[[Congressional Quarterly]]''. The Democratic candidate was [[John Yarmuth]], the founder of local free publication [[Louisville Eccentric Observer|LEO]]. In spite of Northup's electoral success, excellent constituent services, and popularity among blue-collar voters in southern Louisville, Democrats saw this race as winnable, calling attention to Northup's 91% lockstep voting record with an unpopular President Bush. Northup led in most polls until October, when Yarmuth began to gain. By election night, the race had become highly competitive. House Majority Leader [[John Boehner]] referred to Northup as the Republicans' \"canary in the coal mine\", meaning that her fortunes would portend the outcome of House elections nationwide. This proved to be a correct assessment, as on election night, Yarmuth defeated Northup 51% to 48% and Republicans lost control of the House.\n* '''{{ushr|Minnesota|1|}}''': Incumbent [[Gil Gutknecht]] (R) was reelected in his Southern Minnesota district with 60% of the vote in 2004. A member of the 1994 [[Republican Revolution]], Gutknecht had promised not to run for a seventh term when first elected. Though not expected to be significant, the broken promise proved to be a factor in his defeat. Geography teacher [[Tim Walz]] was the Democratic nominee and ran a much stronger campaign than expected, helped by the massive decline in President George W. Bush's popularity in Minnesota. Walz defeated Gutknecht 53%\u201347%.<ref>{{cite news | title=U.S. House of Representatives / Minnesota 01 | url=http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/states/MN/H/01/index.html | work=America Votes 2006 | publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref>\n* '''{{ushr|New Hampshire|1|}}''': Republican incumbent [[Jeb Bradley]] was seeking a third term. Rochester Democratic chair [[Carol Shea-Porter]] won the nomination in a major upset against better funded and party-favored state House Democratic Leader [[Jim Craig (New Hampshire)|Jim Craig]]. Although this was the one house district in [[New England]] Bush carried in 2004, and Bradley had won it handily in the past, the President was highly unpopular throughout New England, which gave Democrats an opening. Still, most thought that Bradley was the strong favorite to win. Shea-Porter defeated Bradley 52% to 48% in the most shocking upset of the night, along with the victories of [[David Loebsack]] and [[Nancy Boyda]].\n* '''{{ushr|New Hampshire|2|}}''': Incumbent [[Charles Bass]] (R) won reelection in 2004 with 58% percent of the vote, even as his district was won by John Kerry 52% to 47%. Bass, a political moderate, easily defeated primary challenges from [[Berlin, New Hampshire|Berlin]] Mayor [[Bob Danderson]] and [[Mary Maxwell (New Hampshire)|Mary Maxwell]]. The Democratic nominee, [[Paul Hodes]], an attorney, was also the 2004 Democratic nominee. In late September, a top Bass staffer resigned after news stories that a U.S. Government computer in Bass's DC office had been used to post anonymous [[concern troll]] messages to NH blogs. In these messages, \"IndyNH\" claimed to be a supporter of Paul Hodes who was discouraged by Bass's unbeatable lead. Hodes defeated Bass on election day, 53% to 46%.\n* '''{{ushr|New York|19|}}''': Incumbent [[Sue Kelly]] (R) had rarely faced stiff competition since her initial election in 1994, but the Democratic primary attracted six contenders in 2006, two of whom dropped out before the primary. Former Ulster County Legislator [[John Hall (New York)|John Hall]], who was once a member of the popular rock band, [[Orleans (band)|Orleans]], won the Democratic nomination with 49% of the vote in a multi-candidate primary. An October 26 Majority-Watch poll had him leading 49% to 47%.<ref>[http://constituentdynamics.com/mw/race-summary]</ref> Several factors played into Kelly's defeat, including the extremely weak GOP showing in the senatorial and gubernatorial races, her reluctance to answer questions about the Mark Foley Page Scandal (notoriously, she literally ran away from television cameras at one point), and Hall's quirky campaign style, which included an appearance on the satirical [[Comedy Central]] program [[The Colbert Report]]. Hall defeated Kelly 51% to 49%. Following Hall's election, [[Stephen Colbert]] took credit for the victory and attributed it entirely to Hall's appearance on the show. Hall appeared several days later to satirically thank the host for his seat in Congress.\n* '''{{ushr|New York|20|}}''': Incumbent [[John E. Sweeney]] (R) had never faced a particularly competitive election until 2006. His competitive district fueled a strong challenge from attorney [[Kirsten Gillibrand]]. In April 2006, Sweeney was allegedly sighted intoxicated at a fraternity party.<ref>{{cite news | last=Tomlin | first=John | title=Congressman Socializes with Students | newspaper=[[Concordiensis]] | date=April 27, 2006 | url=http://www.concordy.com/media/storage/paper858/news/2006/04/27/News/Congressman.Sweeney.Socializes.With.Students-1881202.shtml?norewrite200612211806&sourcedomain=www.concordy.com | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430181206/http://media.www.concordy.com/media/storage/paper858/news/2006/04/27/News/Congressman.Sweeney.Socializes.With.Students-1881202.shtml?norewrite200604301906&sourcedomain=www.concordy.com | archivedate=April 30, 2008}}</ref> On October 31, a week before the election, police report surfaced that documented a 911 call from his wife asking for help because her husband was \"knocking her around the room\".

(For details, see [[2006 New York's 20th congressional district election]].)\n* '''{{ushr|New York|24|}}''': Incumbent [[Sherwood Boehlert]] (R) announced his retirement after 24 years, making this a seat of considerable focus for the Democrats in the run up to the mid terms. Boehlert is considered a moderate Republican, and the district is considered to be competitive. George Bush won by 53% in the 2004 election, but by only 3,000 votes in the 2000 presidential election. The Republican nominee was state Senator [[Ray Meier]], while the Democratic nominee was [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] District Attorney [[Mike Arcuri]]. Both were locally popular and proven vote-getters and the race was a toss-up. Arcuri defeated Meier 54% to 45%.\n* '''{{ushr|North Carolina|11|}}''': [[Charles H. Taylor]] (R) won with 55% in 2004, far behind George W. Bush in the area. The district consists of the [[North Carolina Panhandle]] around [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]]. Dogged by ethics-related scandals, Taylor faced tougher competition from former [[National Football League|professional quarterback]] [[Heath Shuler]] (D) in 2006. A July 10 poll by [[Public Policy Polling]] showed that Shuler led Taylor by 51% to 45% .<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/web_PPP_Survey_071106.pdf | title=Shuler keeps lead for US House | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715070659/http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/web_PPP_Survey_071106.pdf | archivedate=July 15, 2006 | publisher=[[Public Policy Polling]]}}</ref> Shuler defeated Taylor 54%\u201346%.\n\n{{See also|2006 Ohio's 2nd congressional district election|2006 Ohio's 13th congressional district election}}\n\n* '''{{ushr|Ohio|18|}}''': [[Bob Ney]] (R), the incumbent since 1995, part of the [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal]], withdrew from the race in early August 2006,<ref>{{cite news | last=Stout | first=David | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/07/washington/07cnd-ney.html | title=Ohio Congressman Will Not Seek Re-election | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=August 7, 2006}}</ref> before pleading guilty a month later to criminal charges.

His Democratic opponent in 2006 was retired Captain [[Patrick Murphy (Pennsylvania politician)|Patrick Murphy]], an [[Iraq War]] veteran of the [[United States Army|Army]]'s [[82nd Airborne]]. The Iraq War was the major issue of the campaign. In 2005, Murphy proposed a plan for phased withdrawal; Fitzpatrick stood by President Bush's stay-the-course policy through most of the campaign, before calling for a new plan. Ultimately, Murphy defeated Fitzpatrick by 1,518 votes.\n* '''{{ushr|Pennsylvania|10|}}''': [[Don Sherwood]] (R) had strong backing as a result of redistricting in this heavy GOP district. The Democrats didn't even field a candidate to run against him in 2002 and 2004. But in 2005 details were made public regarding a five-year affair between Sherwood and [[Cynthia Ore]], who sued Sherwood for $5.5 million alleging physical abuse. On November 8, 2005, the two settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. Sherwood was expected to win the Republican primary easily over teacher Kathy Scott, as she had very little money or campaign staff, but she polled a surprising 44% of the vote against him. His Democratic opponent was professor and [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] officer [[Chris Carney]]. Carney led in the polls for most of the fall. Carney defeated Sherwood 53% to 47%.

Bush carried the suburban Houston district with 64% of the vote. Democrats sued to keep DeLay as the Republican nominee when he withdrew, citing a lack of proof of residence outside the district, since Texas law does not allow a party to replace its nominee unless the candidate cannot run due to extraordinary circumstances or if he or she moves away. The Democrats won the suit, and DeLay was forced to remain on the ballot or leave his party without a nominee. Republicans quickly rallied around [[Shelley Sekula-Gibbs]] to run a write-in campaign to defeat [[Nick Lampson]] the Democratic nominee. Lampson defeated Sekula-Gibbs 52%\u201342%.\n* '''{{ushr|Texas|23|}}''': In 2004, incumbent [[Henry Bonilla]] (R) received nearly 70% of the vote. However, his district, which includes several heavily Republican suburbs of San Antonio, as well as [[Big Bend National Park]] and much of Texas' border with Mexico, had to be changed after a mid-2006 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling that the redistricting efforts of the Texas Legislature violated [[Voting Rights Act]] protection of minorities \u2014 largely Hispanic [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] was in the 23rd District until the redistricting. On August 4, a federal court redrew the district and removed the portion of Webb County that was in the district, eliminating the possibility of a rematch with Cuellar, and added a heavily Democratic portion of San Antonio, the home base of liberal former congressman [[Ciro Rodriguez]]. Rodriguez ran against Bonilla in the all-candidate primary on November 7.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060813091253/http://www.cqpolitics.com/2006/08/rodriguez_to_mount_comeback_bi.html]</ref> The winner of the now somewhat irrelevant Democratic primary, [[Vietnam War]] [[combat veteran]] [[Rick Bolanos]], also ran in the November 7 election. The realigned district is less Republican than the previous version, but Bonilla was still favored against the crowded field of six Democrats, including Rodriguez and Bolanos, and one Independent candidate. A majority was required in this special election to avoid a runoff between the top two contenders. Bonilla won the November 7 election with 49% of the vote, but failed to get the needed 50% of the vote to avoid the runoff. In that runoff, he faced Rodriguez, who got 20% of the special election vote. Bonilla was seen as being the favorite. He ignored Rodriguez until the final days, then ran TV ads portraying him as politically aligned with some Islamic terror supporters, which backfired. In the special election however, Rodriguez was able to portray himself as part of an incoming majority, which would help retain federal funding for programs in the district. Rodriguez defeated Bonilla in the runoff 54% to 46%.\n* '''{{ushr|Vermont|AL|}}''': Incumbent [[Bernie Sanders]] (I), a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] who represented the entire state of [[Vermont]], ran for the Senate seat being vacated by Senator [[Jim Jeffords]]. Vermont state Senate President Pro Tempore [[Peter Welch]] (D-[[Windsor County, Vermont|Windsor County]]), the Democratic nominee, faced former Vermont Adjutant General [[Martha Rainville]], Major General, USANG (ret.), the Republican nominee. Welch was helped when state Representative [[David Zuckerman (politician)|David Zuckerman]] decided not to wage a third-party campaign. Keith Stern, a businessman and zoning board member from Springfield, ran as an Independent; Jane Newton, a retired nurse, ran on the socialist Liberty Union line; and Jerry Trudell<ref>[http://www.vote-usa.org/Intro.aspx?Id=VTTrudellJerry]</ref> ran as an Independent. Welch defeated Rainville 53% to 45%.\n* '''{{ushr|Wisconsin|8|}}''': Incumbent [[Mark Andrew Green|Mark Green]] (R) \u2014 Green ran for governor, and his seat, in northeastern [[Wisconsin]], was Republican-leaning, although it has elected a Democratic congressman as recently as [[1996 United States House election|1996]] and is centered around the cities of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] and [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]]. State Assembly Speaker [[John Gard]] won the September 12 Republican primary as expected, in which he faced state Assemblywoman [[Terri McCormick]]. The Democratic nominee, [[Steve Kagen]] M.D., defeated business consultant [[Jamie Wall]] and former [[De Pere]] Mayor and [[Brown County, Wisconsin|Brown County]] Executive [[Nancy Nusbaum]] after a very competitive primary. Kagen defeated Gard 51% to 49%.

7, 2006, to elect members to the [[United States House of Representatives]]. It took place in the middle of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s second term in office. All 435 seats of the House were up for election. Those elected served in the [[110th United States Congress]] from January 3, 2007, until January 3, 2009. The incumbent majority party, the Republicans, had won majorities in the House consecutively since [[1994 United States House elections|1994]], and were defeated by the Democrats who won a majority in the chamber, ending 12 years of Republican control in the House.\n\nThe [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] had won a 232-seat majority in 2004. By the time of the 2006 election, they held 229 seats, while the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] held 201, plus [[Bernie Sanders|1]] [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] who caucused with the Democrats. There were also four vacancies. Republicans held a 28-seat advantage, and Democrats needed to pick up 15 seats to take control of the House, which had had a Republican majority since January 1995. The public's perception of [[George W. Bush]], the handling of the war in Iraq, and a series of political scandals involving mostly congressional Republicans took their toll on the party at the ballot box.<ref name=\"TM030614\">{{cite news\n | title = So Why Did the Democrats Win?\n | work = [[Time Magazine]]\n | date = November 15, 2006\n | url = http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1559793,00.html\n | accessdate = March 6, 2014\n}}</ref>\n\nThe final result was a 31-seat pickup for the Democrats, including the pickup of the Vermont at-large seat, previously held by Independent [[Bernie Sanders]] (who [[2006 United States Senate election in Vermont|ran]] instead for U.S. Senate), who caucused with the Democrats.

However, his seat may have become more competitive after the [[Mark Foley scandal|Congressional Page scandal]] broke. Democrats fielded a locally well-known candidate in State Senator [[Harry Mitchell]], a former Mayor of [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]]. Mitchell has been a political force in his home town, one of the largest communities in the district, and Democrats became enthusiastic about his candidacy. The 5th leans Republican, but not overwhelmingly. The district includes, in addition to Tempe, [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], the prime real estate of the Phoenix area. On election night, Mitchell defeated Hayworth, 50% to 46%.\n\n[[File:Arizona 8th district campaign signs 2006 election.jpg|right|thumb|Campaign signs including for Graf (R), Giffords (D) and Quick (I)]]\n\n* '''{{ushr|Arizona|8|}}''': Incumbent [[Jim Kolbe]] (R) announced on November 23, 2005, that he would not seek re-election in 2006.{{citation needed | date=January 2014}} His district, located in Southeastern Arizona and based in the suburbs of [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], is Republican-leaning, but competitive: President Bush won the district with 53% of the vote in 2004 (although only 50% in 2000). The Democratic primary in September was won by former State Senator [[Gabrielle Giffords]], who resigned from the [[Arizona Legislature]] on December 1, 2005, in preparation for the campaign. [[Randy Graf]], a former state Representative who lost to Kolbe in the 2004 primary, won the September 2006 Republican primary. He defeated current state Representative Steve Huffman, whom both Kolbe and the National Republican Congressional Committee supported. The NRCC reportedly became concerned that Graf (a supporter of the [[Minuteman Project]], and a sponsor of an unsuccessful bill that would let patrons carry guns into bars and restaurants), was too conservative to win the district. The NRCC committed $122,000 for a television ad in support of Huffman, which ran the week before the primary. The Democratic party shared that assessment \u2014 prior to the primary, it spent nearly $200,000, \"a large part of that for advertisements critical of Mr. Huffman in an effort to help Mr. Graf's candidacy.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/11/us/politics/11arizona.html | work=[[The New York Times]] | title=In Cost and Vitriol, Race in Arizona Draws Notice | first=Randal C. | last=Archibold | date=September 11, 2006 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}</ref> In late September, the national GOP canceled about $1 million in advertising support.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.azcentral.com/arizonarepublic/local/articles/0922graf0922.html | title=GOP cancels $1 mil in Graf ad support | first=Jon | last=Kamman | website=The Arizona Republic | date=September 22, 2006}}</ref> [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] [[David Nolan (Libertarian Party)|David Nolan]] and independent Jay Quick also ran for the seat.

However, Pombo became associated with the ethical and legal scandals revolving around Jack Abramoff and became the subject of an investigation, which eroded his popular support. In addition, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' listed him as one of the ten worst congressmen. The Democratic candidate who garnered the 39% in 2004, [[Jerry McNerney]], joined that race as a write-in candidate two weeks before the primary election. In 2006, McNerney was challenged in the primary by [[Steve Filson]]. Filson was backed by the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] but was upset by McNerney in the primary.

His retirement to make an unsuccessful run for [[Governor of Colorado]] made this seat highly competitive. The 7th District is located in the northern and eastern [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] suburbs. State education chairman Rick O'Donnell was unopposed for the Republican nomination, while State Senator [[Ed Perlmutter]] won a three-way Democratic primary. On election night, Perlmutter won Beauprez's old seat as expected, 55% to 42%. (For details, see [[2006 Colorado's 7th congressional district election]].)\n* '''{{ushr|Connecticut|2|}}''': Incumbent [[Rob Simmons]] (R), a [[Vietnam War]] veteran and former [[CIA]] agent, won reelection by 54% to 46% in 2004, in a Democratic-leaning district encompassing eastern Connecticut, including [[Norwich, Connecticut|Norwich]] and [[New London, Connecticut|New London]]. The 2002 nominee, former state Representative [[Joe Courtney (politician)|Joe Courtney]], decided to make another run. Even though in the past Simmons had been able to win elections in the Democratic-leaning district by painting himself as a moderate, the seat is perennially competitive. The results were so close on election night that the race was not settled until a week later. A recount was completed on November 14, 2006, with the final results giving Joe Courtney an 83-vote victory over Rob Simmons.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nbc30.com/politics/10318760/detail.html | title=Recount Gives Courtney Win In 2nd District | work=[[NBC Connecticut]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927180058/http://www.nbc30.com/politics/10318760/detail.html | archivedate=September 27, 2007}}</ref> It was the closest house race of 2006.\n* '''{{ushr|Connecticut|5|}}''': Although incumbent [[Nancy Johnson (politician)|Nancy Johnson]] (R) won with at least 60% of the vote in 2004 and faced a difficult challenge (running against a fellow incumbent in a redrawn district) in 2002, winning with just 54%, she was still a Republican in a swing district. While the 5th is Connecticut's most conservative region, John Kerry won the district by about 1100 votes in [[U.S. presidential election, 2004 presidential election|2004]] and [[Al Gore]] won it when Johnson represented it as the 6th District in [[U.S. presidential election, 2000 presidential election|2000]]. The district is located in Northwestern Connecticut and includes a large portion of [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], the wealthy western suburbs of [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], and small rural towns. Johnson faced a credible challenge from state Senator [[Chris Murphy (Connecticut politician)|Chris Murphy]]. She was popular in the district, but with Bush's rating in New England at rock bottom, a Democratic victory was possible. Early in the cycle, this race was considered the least competitive of the three Republican-held seats in Connecticut, but Murphy defeated Johnson on election night, winning 56% to 44%.\n* '''{{ushr|Florida|16|}}''': This Republican-leaning South Florida district, which includes [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]] and [[Port St. Lucie, Florida|Port St. Lucie]] on the state's east coast, and [[Port Charlotte, Florida|Port Charlotte]] on the west coast, was represented by [[Mark Foley]], head of the Missing and Exploited Children's Caucus. However, Foley resigned September 29, 2006, due to revelations of inappropriate contacts of a sexual nature with underage male congressional pages. The scandal immediately ballooned to include the Republican leadership's involvement in a possible cover-up, and it soon brought down Republicans nationwide. Florida law bars state parties from replacing candidates on the ballot. Within the district, the scandal created strong backlash against any Republican replacement due to Foley's name remaining on the ballot, and, by extension, made the race, which had earlier been written off by most as a \"safe\" Republican seat, highly competitive. Businessman [[Tim Mahoney]], a surprisingly well-funded challenger in a seemingly uncompetitive race, quickly became favored to win. The Republican replacement, businessman [[Joe Negron]], ran an effective \"Punch Foley for Negron\" campaign, but lost in a closer than expected race, with 48% to Mahoney's 49%.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/states/FL/H/16/index.html | title=U.S. House of Representatives / Florida 16 | work=America Votes 2006 | publisher=[[CNN]]}}<br/>[http://election.dos.state.fl.us/elections/resultsarchive/Index.asp?ElectionDate=11/7/2006&DATAMODE= Official results] from Florida Secretary of State</ref>\n* '''{{ushr|Florida|22|}}''': Republican [[E. Clay Shaw Jr.|E. Clay Shaw]] had been in Congress since 1981, and had represented the 22nd District since 1993. The district voted for John Kerry over George Bush in 2004, but re-elected Shaw with 63% against a last minute replacement Democrat. In 2000, Shaw won a close race by 599 votes in a district that Al Gore won by 4%, but in 2002, he was redistricted into a slightly less Democratic district and scored an easy victory. The district includes wealthy areas of [[Palm Beach County]] and [[Broward County]] including [[Boca Raton, Florida|Boca Raton]] and parts of [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]] The revelation that Shaw was being treated for a second time for lung cancer may have affected his re-election chances. This year, Shaw faced a challenge from well-funded state senator [[Ron Klein]]. Klein won on election day 51% to 47%.\n* '''{{ushr|Indiana|2|}}''': [[Chris Chocola]] (R) was first elected in 2002 by a 50% to 46% margin. Democrat [[Joe Donnelly]], who lost to Chocola 54% to 45% in 2004, ran again in 2006. Democrats blamed Donnelly's 2004 loss on a lack of funding from the national party that allowed Chocola to outspend Donnelly by a two-to-one margin. President Bush visited the [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]]-centered district seven times between 2000 and 2006, suggesting that Chocola was vulnerable. Chocola's popularity was also affected by the unpopularity of GOP Governor [[Mitch Daniels]]; among other things, Daniels decided to lease a toll road that runs through the district to a foreign corporation. Daniels also pushed to move the entire state to [[daylight saving time]], which was opposed by local residents. In the campaign, Chocola attacked Donnelly for being delinquent in paying property taxes. On election night, Donnelly defeated Chocola 54% to 46%.\n* '''{{ushr|Indiana|8|}}''': [[John Hostettler]] (R), who had only a 34% approval rating, was challenged by [[Vanderburgh County, Indiana|Vanderburgh County]] Sheriff [[Brad Ellsworth]] in this swing district that includes [[Evansville, Indiana|Evansville]] and [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]]. Hostettler had a history of winning tough reelections, but Ellsworth was considered to be his strongest opponent. The district has been nicknamed \"The Bloody Eighth\" due to its frequent ousting of incumbent congressmen, which has occurred in 1958, 1966, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1994, and 2006. Despite the competitive nature of the district, Hostettler was traditionally slow to raise money and lagged far behind his opponent in fundraising totals throughout the election. Rumors circulated in September that Hostettler had essentially given up on his campaign when he failed to hold any events on [[Labor Day]] weekend, the traditional kickoff of the campaign season. In the end, Ellsworth defeated Hostettler by a 61%\u201339% margin, the most lopsided loss for a House incumbent since 1994.\n* '''{{ushr|Indiana|9|}}''': In 2004, incumbent [[Mike Sodrel]] (R) defeated then-incumbent [[Baron Hill (politician)|Baron Hill]] by only 1,425 votes, the smallest winning percentage in any congressional race that year.<ref name=\"15059501.htm\">{{cite news | last=Lee | first=Mara | date=July 2, 2006 | url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2006/jul/02/candidates-cash-in-on-celebrities/?print=1 | title=Candidates cash in on celebrities | newspaper=[[Evansville Courier & Press]]}}</ref> Hill ran in 2006 to reclaim his seat in this Southeast Indiana district that includes [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] and [[New Albany, Indiana|New Albany]]. He defeated anti-war challenger [[Gretchen Clearwater]] in the May 2 primary. Factors cited in the race included Sodrel being a self-described staunch Republican Party loyalist in an evenly divided district, Hill lacking the advantages of incumbency in 2006, and (according to Democrats) Hill's superior constituent service compared to Sodrel's. Hill defeated Sodrel 50% to 46%.\n* '''{{ushr|Iowa|1|}}''': Incumbent [[Jim Nussle]] (R) left his seat in Congress to run for governor. This district is Democratic-leaning, and of the open seats was one of the most likely to change hands. It contains most of northeastern [[Iowa]] including large cities such as [[Dubuque, Iowa|Dubuque]], the [[Quad Cities]] and [[Waterloo, Iowa|Waterloo]]. Nussle had been reelected in 2000 and 2004 with 55% of the vote but Al Gore and John Kerry won the district in those same years. In 2006, businessman Mike Whalen won the Republican nomination while attorney [[Bruce Braley]] was the Democratic nominee. Braley defeated Whalen 55 percent to 43 percent. (For details, see [[2006 Iowa's 1st congressional district election]].)\n* '''{{ushr|Iowa|2|}}''': Incumbent [[Jim Leach]] (R) received 59% of the vote in 2004. Before the election, this was the most Democratic seat held by a Republican, as measured by presidential candidates' performances in the district. However, Leach had consistently won here since 1976, helped by his reputation for strong integrity. Also helping him was his status as one of the most liberal Republicans in the House. As a result, Leach traditionally won large numbers of crossover votes from Democrats and was expected to do so again. The Democrats nominated [[David Loebsack]], a political science professor at small [[Cornell College]] in [[Mount Vernon, Iowa]]. Despite Leach's appeal and seniority, Loebsack prevailed on election night by a 51% to 49% margin. Leach's defeat made him the most senior House member to lose re-election in 2006 and the most senior member to lose re-election since 36-year incumbent [[Phil Crane]] lost in 2004 in an upset to [[Melissa Bean]].\n* '''{{ushr|Kansas|2|}}''': Incumbent [[Jim Ryun]] (R), a leading conservative, won re-election by 56% to 41% in 2004 and had held his seat for five terms. This year, Ryun faced a rematch with Democrat [[Nancy Boyda]], who also ran against him in 2004. The district is home to [[Topeka, Kansas|Topeka]], [[Manhattan, Kansas|Manhattan]] (location of [[Kansas State University]]), [[Leavenworth, Kansas|Leavenworth]], [[Pittsburg, Kansas|Pittsburg]], and half of the liberal college town of [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], home of the [[University of Kansas]]. Despite being held by Ryun, the seat had a history of electing Democrats and before 1994, Democrats held the seat for 20 out of 24 years. However, [[gerrymandering]] had made the seat tilt more Republican, and Ryun was thought to be secure. However, Ryun faced controversy over a Washington, D.C. real estate purchase, and in the wake of scandals that rocked Washington, D.C., this had a major effect on local voters, far more than had been expected. Boyda was also helped by the reelection of popular Democratic Governor [[Kathleen Sebelius]]. Boyda defeated the incumbent Ryun 51% to 47%, in one of the most shocking results of the night.\n* '''{{ushr|Kentucky|3|}}''': Incumbent [[Anne Northup]] (R) had been a target for the Democrats since her election in 1996; in 2004 and 2000, John Kerry and Al Gore both won her [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]]-centered congressional district by two percent, and [[Bill Clinton]] won the district by double-digit margins during the 1990s. While Northup had generally run close races, she won 60% of the vote in the 2004 election. [[Redistricting]] after the 2000 census added a few more suburban Republicans to the district, according to ''[[Congressional Quarterly]]''. The Democratic candidate was [[John Yarmuth]], the founder of local free publication [[Louisville Eccentric Observer|LEO]]. In spite of Northup's electoral success, excellent constituent services, and popularity among blue-collar voters in southern Louisville, Democrats saw this race as winnable, calling attention to Northup's 91% lockstep voting record with an unpopular President Bush. Northup led in most polls until October, when Yarmuth began to gain. By election night, the race had become highly competitive. House Majority Leader [[John Boehner]] referred to Northup as the Republicans' \"canary in the coal mine\", meaning that her fortunes would portend the outcome of House elections nationwide. This proved to be a correct assessment, as on election night, Yarmuth defeated Northup 51% to 48% and Republicans lost control of the House.\n* '''{{ushr|Minnesota|1|}}''': Incumbent [[Gil Gutknecht]] (R) was reelected in his Southern Minnesota district with 60% of the vote in 2004. A member of the 1994 [[Republican Revolution]], Gutknecht had promised not to run for a seventh term when first elected. Though not expected to be significant, the broken promise proved to be a factor in his defeat. Geography teacher [[Tim Walz]] was the Democratic nominee and ran a much stronger campaign than expected, helped by the massive decline in President George W. Bush's popularity in Minnesota. Walz defeated Gutknecht 53%\u201347%.<ref>{{cite news | title=U.S. House of Representatives / Minnesota 01 | url=http://edition.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006/pages/results/states/MN/H/01/index.html | work=America Votes 2006 | publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref>\n* '''{{ushr|New Hampshire|1|}}''': Republican incumbent [[Jeb Bradley]] was seeking a third term. Rochester Democratic chair [[Carol Shea-Porter]] won the nomination in a major upset against better funded and party-favored state House Democratic Leader [[Jim Craig (New Hampshire)|Jim Craig]]. Although this was the one house district in [[New England]] Bush carried in 2004, and Bradley had won it handily in the past, the President was highly unpopular throughout New England, which gave Democrats an opening. Still, most thought that Bradley was the strong favorite to win. Shea-Porter defeated Bradley 52% to 48% in the most shocking upset of the night, along with the victories of [[David Loebsack]] and [[Nancy Boyda]].\n* '''{{ushr|New Hampshire|2|}}''': Incumbent [[Charles Bass]] (R) won reelection in 2004 with 58% percent of the vote, even as his district was won by John Kerry 52% to 47%. Bass, a political moderate, easily defeated primary challenges from [[Berlin, New Hampshire|Berlin]] Mayor [[Bob Danderson]] and [[Mary Maxwell (New Hampshire)|Mary Maxwell]]. The Democratic nominee, [[Paul Hodes]], an attorney, was also the 2004 Democratic nominee. In late September, a top Bass staffer resigned after news stories that a U.S. Government computer in Bass's DC office had been used to post anonymous [[concern troll]] messages to NH blogs. In these messages, \"IndyNH\" claimed to be a supporter of Paul Hodes who was discouraged by Bass's unbeatable lead. Hodes defeated Bass on election day, 53% to 46%.\n* '''{{ushr|New York|19|}}''': Incumbent [[Sue Kelly]] (R) had rarely faced stiff competition since her initial election in 1994, but the Democratic primary attracted six contenders in 2006, two of whom dropped out before the primary. Former Ulster County Legislator [[John Hall (New York)|John Hall]], who was once a member of the popular rock band, [[Orleans (band)|Orleans]], won the Democratic nomination with 49% of the vote in a multi-candidate primary. An October 26 Majority-Watch poll had him leading 49% to 47%.<ref>[http://constituentdynamics.com/mw/race-summary]</ref> Several factors played into Kelly's defeat, including the extremely weak GOP showing in the senatorial and gubernatorial races, her reluctance to answer questions about the Mark Foley Page Scandal (notoriously, she literally ran away from television cameras at one point), and Hall's quirky campaign style, which included an appearance on the satirical [[Comedy Central]] program [[The Colbert Report]]. Hall defeated Kelly 51% to 49%. Following Hall's election, [[Stephen Colbert]] took credit for the victory and attributed it entirely to Hall's appearance on the show. Hall appeared several days later to satirically thank the host for his seat in Congress.\n* '''{{ushr|New York|20|}}''': Incumbent [[John E. Sweeney]] (R) had never faced a particularly competitive election until 2006. His competitive district fueled a strong challenge from attorney [[Kirsten Gillibrand]]. In April 2006, Sweeney was allegedly sighted intoxicated at a fraternity party.<ref>{{cite news | last=Tomlin | first=John | title=Congressman Socializes with Students | newspaper=[[Concordiensis]] | date=April 27, 2006 | url=http://www.concordy.com/media/storage/paper858/news/2006/04/27/News/Congressman.Sweeney.Socializes.With.Students-1881202.shtml?norewrite200612211806&sourcedomain=www.concordy.com | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080430181206/http://media.www.concordy.com/media/storage/paper858/news/2006/04/27/News/Congressman.Sweeney.Socializes.With.Students-1881202.shtml?norewrite200604301906&sourcedomain=www.concordy.com | archivedate=April 30, 2008}}</ref> On October 31, a week before the election, police report surfaced that documented a 911 call from his wife asking for help because her husband was \"knocking her around the room\". Despite denials from both Sweeney and his wife, the report proved to be a turning point and Gillibrand was victorious on election night, 53% to 47%. (For details, see [[2006 New York's 20th congressional district election]].)\n* '''{{ushr|New York|24|}}''': Incumbent [[Sherwood Boehlert]] (R) announced his retirement after 24 years, making this a seat of considerable focus for the Democrats in the run up to the mid terms. Boehlert is considered a moderate Republican, and the district is considered to be competitive. George Bush won by 53% in the 2004 election, but by only 3,000 votes in the 2000 presidential election. The Republican nominee was state Senator [[Ray Meier]], while the Democratic nominee was [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]] District Attorney [[Mike Arcuri]]. Both were locally popular and proven vote-getters and the race was a toss-up. Arcuri defeated Meier 54% to 45%.\n* '''{{ushr|North Carolina|11|}}''': [[Charles H. Taylor]] (R) won with 55% in 2004, far behind George W. Bush in the area. The district consists of the [[North Carolina Panhandle]] around [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]]. Dogged by ethics-related scandals, Taylor faced tougher competition from former [[National Football League|professional quarterback]] [[Heath Shuler]] (D) in 2006. A July 10 poll by [[Public Policy Polling]] showed that Shuler led Taylor by 51% to 45% .<ref>{{cite press release | url=http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/web_PPP_Survey_071106.pdf | title=Shuler keeps lead for US House | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060715070659/http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/web_PPP_Survey_071106.pdf | archivedate=July 15, 2006 | publisher=[[Public Policy Polling]]}}</ref> Shuler defeated Taylor 54%\u201346%.\n\n{{See also|2006 Ohio's 2nd congressional district election|2006 Ohio's 13th congressional district election}}\n\n* '''{{ushr|Ohio|18|}}''': [[Bob Ney]] (R), the incumbent since 1995, part of the [[Jack Abramoff Indian lobbying scandal]], withdrew from the race in early August 2006,<ref>{{cite news | last=Stout | first=David | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/07/washington/07cnd-ney.html | title=Ohio Congressman Will Not Seek Re-election | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=August 7, 2006}}</ref> before pleading guilty a month later to criminal charges. [[Zack Space]], the law director of the city of [[Dover, Ohio|Dover]], was the surprise winner of the Democratic nomination. Ney's formal withdrawal on August 14 resulted in a special election to choose his replacement; Ohio state Senator [[Joy Padgett]] won with about 65% of the vote.

His Democratic opponent in 2006 was retired Captain [[Patrick Murphy (Pennsylvania politician)|Patrick Murphy]], an [[Iraq War]] veteran of the [[United States Army|Army]]'s [[82nd Airborne]]. The Iraq War was the major issue of the campaign. In 2005, Murphy proposed a plan for phased withdrawal; Fitzpatrick stood by President Bush's stay-the-course policy through most of the campaign, before calling for a new plan. Ultimately, Murphy defeated Fitzpatrick by 1,518 votes.\n* '''{{ushr|Pennsylvania|10|}}''': [[Don Sherwood]] (R) had strong backing as a result of redistricting in this heavy GOP district. The Democrats didn't even field a candidate to run against him in 2002 and 2004. But in 2005 details were made public regarding a five-year affair between Sherwood and [[Cynthia Ore]], who sued Sherwood for $5.5 million alleging physical abuse. On November 8, 2005, the two settled out of court for an undisclosed amount. Sherwood was expected to win the Republican primary easily over teacher Kathy Scott, as she had very little money or campaign staff, but she polled a surprising 44% of the vote against him. His Democratic opponent was professor and [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] officer [[Chris Carney]]. Carney led in the polls for most of the fall. Carney defeated Sherwood 53% to 47%. For details, see [[2006 Pennsylvania's 10th congressional district election]].\n* '''{{ushr|Texas|22|}}''': Incumbent former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R) won the primary, then retired, leaving his seat vacant, and dropped out of the re-election race. These events followed a number of corruption charges that made DeLay the focus of a September 28, 2005, indictment by a grand jury in [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] (which includes [[Austin, Texas|Austin]]) over his campaign finances related to [[Texans for a Republican Majority]] (TRMPAC) and another political action committee, [[Americans for a Republican Majority|ARMPAC]]. In 2004, DeLay won 55% of the vote against a relatively unknown Democrat, environmental lawyer [[Richard Morrison (politician)|Richard Morrison]], even though George W. Bush carried the suburban Houston district with 64% of the vote. Democrats sued to keep DeLay as the Republican nominee when he withdrew, citing a lack of proof of residence outside the district, since Texas law does not allow a party to replace its nominee unless the candidate cannot run due to extraordinary circumstances or if he or she moves away. The Democrats won the suit, and DeLay was forced to remain on the ballot or leave his party without a nominee. Republicans quickly rallied around [[Shelley Sekula-Gibbs]] to run a write-in campaign to defeat [[Nick Lampson]] the Democratic nominee. Lampson defeated Sekula-Gibbs 52%\u201342%.\n* '''{{ushr|Texas|23|}}''': In 2004, incumbent [[Henry Bonilla]] (R) received nearly 70% of the vote. However, his district, which includes several heavily Republican suburbs of San Antonio, as well as [[Big Bend National Park]] and much of Texas' border with Mexico, had to be changed after a mid-2006 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling that the redistricting efforts of the Texas Legislature violated [[Voting Rights Act]] protection of minorities \u2014 largely Hispanic [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] was in the 23rd District until the redistricting. On August 4, a federal court redrew the district and removed the portion of Webb County that was in the district, eliminating the possibility of a rematch with Cuellar, and added a heavily Democratic portion of San Antonio, the home base of liberal former congressman [[Ciro Rodriguez]]. Rodriguez ran against Bonilla in the all-candidate primary on November 7.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20060813091253/http://www.cqpolitics.com/2006/08/rodriguez_to_mount_comeback_bi.html]</ref> The winner of the now somewhat irrelevant Democratic primary, [[Vietnam War]] [[combat veteran]] [[Rick Bolanos]], also ran in the November 7 election. The realigned district is less Republican than the previous version, but Bonilla was still favored against the crowded field of six Democrats, including Rodriguez and Bolanos, and one Independent candidate. A majority was required in this special election to avoid a runoff between the top two contenders. Bonilla won the November 7 election with 49% of the vote, but failed to get the needed 50% of the vote to avoid the runoff. In that runoff, he faced Rodriguez, who got 20% of the special election vote. Bonilla was seen as being the favorite. He ignored Rodriguez until the final days, then ran TV ads portraying him as politically aligned with some Islamic terror supporters, which backfired. In the special election however, Rodriguez was able to portray himself as part of an incoming majority, which would help retain federal funding for programs in the district. Rodriguez defeated Bonilla in the runoff 54% to 46%.\n* '''{{ushr|Vermont|AL|}}''': Incumbent [[Bernie Sanders]] (I), a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] who represented the entire state of [[Vermont]], ran for the Senate seat being vacated by Senator [[Jim Jeffords]]. Vermont state Senate President Pro Tempore [[Peter Welch]] (D-[[Windsor County, Vermont|Windsor County]]), the Democratic nominee, faced former Vermont Adjutant General [[Martha Rainville]], Major General, USANG (ret.), the Republican nominee. Welch was helped when state Representative [[David Zuckerman (politician)|David Zuckerman]] decided not to wage a third-party campaign. Keith Stern, a businessman and zoning board member from Springfield, ran as an Independent; Jane Newton, a retired nurse, ran on the socialist Liberty Union line; and Jerry Trudell<ref>[http://www.vote-usa.org/Intro.aspx?Id=VTTrudellJerry]</ref> ran as an Independent. Welch defeated Rainville 53% to 45%.\n* '''{{ushr|Wisconsin|8|}}''': Incumbent [[Mark Andrew Green|Mark Green]] (R) \u2014 Green ran for governor, and his seat, in northeastern [[Wisconsin]], was Republican-leaning, although it has elected a Democratic congressman as recently as [[1996 United States House election|1996]] and is centered around the cities of [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]] and [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]]. State Assembly Speaker [[John Gard]] won the September 12 Republican primary as expected, in which he faced state Assemblywoman [[Terri McCormick]]. The Democratic nominee, [[Steve Kagen]] M.D., defeated business consultant [[Jamie Wall]] and former [[De Pere]] Mayor and [[Brown County, Wisconsin|Brown County]] Executive [[Nancy Nusbaum]] after a very competitive primary. Kagen defeated Gard 51% to 49%.
