It is the shortest and most sexually explicit of Fleming's novels, as well as a clear departure from previous Bond novels in that the story is told in the [[First person narrative|first person]] by a young Canadian woman, Vivienne Michel. Bond himself does not appear until two-thirds of the way through the book. Fleming wrote a prologue to the novel giving Michel credit as a co-author.\n\nDue to the reactions by critics and fans, Fleming was not happy with the book and attempted to suppress elements of it where he could: he blocked a paperback edition in the United Kingdom and only gave permission for the title to be used when he sold the film rights to [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert R. Broccoli]], rather than any aspects of the plots. However, the character of [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]] is loosely based on one of the characters in the book and a British paperback edition was published after his death.\n\nA heavily adapted version of ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' appeared in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper in daily comic strip format in 1967\u20131968. In 1977 the title was used for [[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|the tenth film]] in the [[Eon Productions]] series. It was the third to star [[Roger Moore]] as Bond and used no plot elements from the novel.\n\n==Plot summary==\n{{Quote box\n |title =\n |quote = I found what follows lying on my desk one morning. As you will see, it appears to be the first person story of a young woman, evidently beautiful and not unskilled in the arts of love. According to her story, she appears to have been involved, both perilously and romantically, with the same James Bond whose secret service exploits I myself have written from time to time. With the manuscript was a note signed 'Vivienne Michel' assuring me that what she had written was 'purest truth and from the depths of her heart'. I was interested in this view of James Bond, through the wrong end of the telescope so to speak, and after obtaining clearance for certain minor infringements of the Official Secrets Act I have much pleasure in sponsoring its publication. |source = Ian Fleming, ''The Spy Who Loved Me'', Prologue |align = right|width = 50% |bgcolor = #CFECEC|salign = right}}\n\nFleming structured the novel in three sections \u2013\"Me\", \"Them\" and \"Him\" \u2013 to describe the phases of the story. It is told from the first-person perspective of Vivienne \"Viv\" Michel, a young Canadian woman.\n\n;Me\nViv details her upbringing in Canada and London and her first two love affairs. The first was with Derek Mallaby, a young Englishman who took her virginity in a field after the couple were thrown out of a cinema for [[indecent exposure]]. Their physical relationship ended that night, and Viv was subsequently rejected when Mallaby sent her a letter from [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] saying he was forcibly engaged to someone else by his parents. Viv's second love affair was with her German boss, Kurt Rainer, by whom she eventually became pregnant. When she told Rainer, he coldly ended their affair and paid for her to have an abortion in Switzerland. After the procedure, Viv returned to her native Canada and began traveling through North America, stopping at a motel in the [[Adirondack Mountains]] and working there as a receptionist for the final two weeks of the vacation season.\n\n;Them\nOn the last day of the season, the motel managers entrust Viv with looking after it for the night before the owner, Mr. Sanguinetti, can arrive to take inventory and close it up for the winter. Two mobsters, \"Sluggsy\" Morant and Sol \"Horror\" Horowitz, both of whom work for Sanguinetti, arrive and say they are there to look over the motel for insurance purposes. Viv tries to escape into the woods, but Sluggsy follows and brings her back. He and Horror assault her and are about to rape her, but are interrupted by the front door buzzer.\n\n;Him\nBritish secret service agent James Bond appears at the door asking for a room, having had a flat tyre while passing through the area. Bond quickly realises that Horror and Sluggsy are mobsters and that Viv is in danger. Pressuring the two men, he eventually gets them to agree to provide him a room. Bond tells Viv that he is in America in the wake of Operation [[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]] and was detailed to protect a Russian nuclear expert who defected to the West and who now lives in [[Toronto]], as part of his quest to ferret out [[SPECTRE]]. That night Sluggsy and Horror set fire to the motel and attempt to kill Bond and Viv. A gun battle ensues; the mobsters try to escape by car, but it crashes into a lake after Bond kills Horror. Bond and Viv take shelter in an undamaged cabin, and Bond explains that the mobsters had been hired by Sanguinetti to burn down the motel so he could collect the insurance; Viv was meant to die in the fire and take the blame. Bond and Viv retire to bed, but Sluggsy breaks into the cabin and tries to kill them, having escaped from the sinking car. Bond shoots and kills him.\n\nViv wakes the next morning to find Bond gone, leaving a note in which he promises to send her police assistance and urges her not to dwell too much on the ugly events through which she has just lived. As Viv finishes reading the note, a large police detachment arrives. After taking her statement, the officer in charge of the detail reiterates Bond's advice, but also warns Viv that ''all'' men involved in violent crime and espionage, regardless of which side they are on\u2014including Bond himself\u2014are dangerous and that Viv should avoid them. Viv reflects on this as she motors off, continuing her tour of America, but cherishes the memory of her time with Bond despite the officer's caution.\n\n==Characters and themes==\nContinuation Bond author [[Raymond Benson]] sees Vivienne Michel as the best realised female characterisation undertaken by Fleming, partly because the story is told in the [[first person narrative]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=129}} Academic [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] notes that Michel is the closest Fleming gets to [[kitchen sink realism]] in the Bond canon:{{sfn|Black|2005|p=71}} she has been a victim of life in the past,{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=129}} but is wilful and tough, too.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=130}}\n\nThe other characters in the novel are given less attention and Vivienne's second lover, Kurt, is a caricature of a cruel German, who forces her to have an abortion before finishing their affair.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=73}} According to Black, the two thugs, Sluggsy and Horror, are \"comic-book villains with comic-book names\".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=74}} Their characters are not given the same status as other villains in Bond stories, but are second-rate professional killers, which makes them more believable in the story.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=130}}\n\nAs with [[Casino Royale (novel)|''Casino Royale'']], the question of morality between Bond and the villains is brought up, again by Bond, but also by the police officer involved.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=129}} Benson argues that this runs counter to another theme in the novel, which had also appeared in a number of other Bond books including [[Goldfinger (novel)|''Goldfinger'']]: the concept of Bond as [[Saint George]] against the dragon.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=129}} In this Black agrees, who sees ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' as being \"an account of the vulnerable under challenge, of the manipulative nature of individuals and of the possibility of being trapped by evil\".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=72}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:GoldeneyeEstate.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Goldeneye, where Fleming wrote all the Bond novels, including ''The Spy Who Loved Me''.]]\n''The Spy Who Loved Me'' was written in Jamaica at Fleming's [[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye estate]] in January and February 1961 and was the shortest manuscript Fleming had produced for a novel, being only 113 pages long.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=21}} Fleming found the book the easiest for him to write and apologised to his editor at Jonathan Cape for the ease.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=381}} ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' has been described by Fleming biographer [[Andrew Lycett]] as Fleming's \"most sleazy and violent story ever\", which may have been indicative of his state of mind at the time.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=381}}\n\nFleming borrowed from his surroundings, as he had done with all his writing up to that point, to include places he had seen. One such location was a motel in the Adirondacks in upstate New York, which Fleming would drive past on the way to Ivar Bryce's Black Hollow Farm; this became the Dreamy Pines Motel.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=186}} Similarly, he took incidents from his own life and used them in the novel: Vivienne Michel's seduction in a box in the Royalty Kinema,<!--Correct spelling with a K - please do not change-->{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=31}} Windsor, mirrors Fleming's loss of virginity in the same establishment.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=11}} A colleague at ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', [[Robert Harling (typographer)|Robert Harling]], gave his name to a printer in the story{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=113}} while another minor character, Frank Donaldson, was named after Jack Donaldson, a friend of Fleming's wife.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=382}} One of Fleming's neighbours in Jamaica was Vivienne Stuart, whose first name Fleming purloined for the novel's heroine.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=382}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{Rquote|right|...&nbsp;the experiment has obviously gone very much awry\n|Ian Fleming|in letter to his editor{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=187}}}}\n''The Spy Who Loved Me'' was published in the UK on 16 April 1962 as a hardcover edition by publishers [[Jonathan Cape]]; it was 221 pages long and cost 15 [[shilling]]s.<ref name=\"Times (1962)\"/> Artist [[Richard Chopping]] once again undertook the cover art, and raised his fee from the 200 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] he had charged for [[Thunderball (novel)|''Thunderball'']], to 250 guineas.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=390}} The artwork included a [[Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife|commando knife]] which was borrowed from Fleming's editor, Michael Howard at Jonathan Cape.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|pp=390\u2013391}} ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' was published in the US by [[Viking Press|Viking Books]] on 11 April 1962<ref>{{cite news|title=Books \u2013 Authors|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=29 March 1962|page=30|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/03/29/archives/books-authors.html}} {{subscription}}</ref> with 211 pages and costing $3.95.<ref name=\"Time (1962)\"/>\n\nThe reception to the novel was so bad that Fleming wrote to Michael Howard at Jonathan Cape, to explain why he wrote the book: \"I had become increasingly surprised to find my thrillers, which were designed for an adult audience, being read in schools, and that young people were making a hero out of James Bond&nbsp;... So it crossed my mind to write a cautionary tale about Bond, to put the record straight in the minds particularly of younger readers&nbsp;... the experiment has obviously gone very much awry\".{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=187}}\n\nFleming subsequently requested that there should be no reprints or paperback version of the book,{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=402}} and for the British market no paperback version appeared until after Fleming's death.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=446}} Because of the heightened sexual writing in the novel, it was banned in a number of countries.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=23}} In the US the story was also published in [[Stag (magazine)|''Stag'']] magazine, with the title changed to ''Motel Nymph''.{{sfn|Simpson|2002|p=43}}\n\n===Reviews===\nBroadly the critics did not welcome Fleming's experiment with the Bond formula. The academic Christoph Linder points out that ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' received the worst reception of all the Bond books.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=72}} ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', for example, wrote \"Oh Dear Oh Dear Oh Dear! And to think of the books Mr Fleming once wrote!\"{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=187}} while [[The Herald (Glasgow)|''The Glasgow Herald'']] thought Fleming was finished: \"His ability to invent a plot has deserted him almost entirely and he has had to substitute for a fast-moving story the sorry misadventures of an upper-class tramp, told in dreary detail.\"{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=187}} Writing in ''[[The Observer]]'', [[Maurice Richardson]] described the tale as \"a new and regrettable if not altogether unreadable variation\",<ref name=\"Richardson (1962)\">{{cite news|last=Richardson|first=Maurice|authorlink=Maurice Richardson|title=Crime Ration|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=15 April 1962|page=28}}</ref> going on to hope that \"this doesn't spell the total eclipse of Bond in a blaze of cornography\".<ref name=\"Richardson (1962)\"/> Richardson ended his piece by berating Fleming, asking: \"why can't this cunning author write up a bit instead of down?\"<ref name=\"Richardson (1962)\"/> The critic for ''[[The Times]]'' was not dismissive of Bond, who they describe as \"less a person than a cult\"<ref name=\"Times (1962)\">{{cite news|title=New Fiction|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=19 April 1962|page=15}}</ref> who is \"ruthlessly, fashionably efficient in both love and war\".<ref name=\"Times (1962)\"/> Rather, the critic dismisses the experiment, writing that \"the novel lacks Mr. Fleming's usual careful construction and must be written off as a disappointment.\"<ref name=\"Times (1962)\"/> John Fletcher thought that it was \"as if [[Mickey Spillane]] had tried to gatecrash his way into the Romantic Novelists' Association\".{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=187}}\n\nPhilip Stead, writing in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' considered the novel to be \"a morbid version of that of Beauty and the Beast\".<ref name=\"Stead (1962)\">{{cite news|last=Stead|first=Philip John|title=Bond's New Girl|newspaper=The Times Literary Supplement|date=20 April 1962|page=261}}</ref> The review noted that once Bond arrives on the scene to find Michel threatened by the two thugs, he \"solves [the problem] in his usual way.

It is the shortest and most sexually explicit of Fleming's novels, as well as a clear departure from previous Bond novels in that the story is told in the [[First person narrative|first person]] by a young Canadian woman, Vivienne Michel. Bond himself does not appear until two-thirds of the way through the book. Fleming wrote a prologue to the novel giving Michel credit as a co-author.\n\nDue to the reactions by critics and fans, Fleming was not happy with the book and attempted to suppress elements of it where he could: he blocked a paperback edition in the United Kingdom and only gave permission for the title to be used when he sold the film rights to [[Harry Saltzman]] and [[Albert R. Broccoli]], rather than any aspects of the plots. However, the character of [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]] is loosely based on one of the characters in the book and a British paperback edition was published after his death.\n\nA heavily adapted version of ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' appeared in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' newspaper in daily comic strip format in 1967\u20131968. In 1977 the title was used for [[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|the tenth film]] in the [[Eon Productions]] series. It was the third to star [[Roger Moore]] as Bond and used no plot elements from the novel.\n\n==Plot summary==\n{{Quote box\n |title =\n |quote = I found what follows lying on my desk one morning. As you will see, it appears to be the first person story of a young woman, evidently beautiful and not unskilled in the arts of love. According to her story, she appears to have been involved, both perilously and romantically, with the same James Bond whose secret service exploits I myself have written from time to time. With the manuscript was a note signed 'Vivienne Michel' assuring me that what she had written was 'purest truth and from the depths of her heart'. I was interested in this view of James Bond, through the wrong end of the telescope so to speak, and after obtaining clearance for certain minor infringements of the Official Secrets Act I have much pleasure in sponsoring its publication. |source = Ian Fleming, ''The Spy Who Loved Me'', Prologue |align = right|width = 50% |bgcolor = #CFECEC|salign = right}}\n\nFleming structured the novel in three sections \u2013\"Me\", \"Them\" and \"Him\" \u2013 to describe the phases of the story. It is told from the first-person perspective of Vivienne \"Viv\" Michel, a young Canadian woman.\n\n;Me\nViv details her upbringing in Canada and London and her first two love affairs. The first was with with Derek Mallaby, a young Englishman who took her virginity in a field after the couple were thrown out of a cinema for [[indecent exposure]]. Their physical relationship ended that night, and Viv was subsequently rejected when Mallaby sent her a letter from [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] saying he was forcibly engaged to someone else by his parents. Viv's second love affair was with her German boss, Kurt Rainer, by whom she eventually became pregnant. When she told Rainer, he coldly ended their affair and paid for her to have an abortion in Switzerland. After the procedure, Viv returned to her native Canada and began traveling through North America, stopping at a motel in the [[Adirondack Mountains]] and working there as a receptionist for the final two weeks of the vacation season.\n\n;Them\nOn the last day of the season, the motel managers entrust Viv with looking after it for the night before the owner, Mr. Sanguinetti, can arrive to take inventory and close it up for the winter. Two mobsters, \"Sluggsy\" Morant and Sol \"Horror\" Horowitz, both of whom work for Sanguinetti, arrive and say they are there to look over the motel for insurance purposes. Viv tries to escape into the woods, but Sluggsy follows and brings her back. He and Horror assault her and are about to rape her, but are interrupted by the front door buzzer.\n\n;Him\nBritish secret service agent James Bond appears at the door asking for a room, having had a flat tyre while passing through the area. Bond quickly realises that Horror and Sluggsy are mobsters and that Viv is in danger. Pressuring the two men, he eventually gets them to agree to provide him a room. Bond tells Viv that he is in America in the wake of Operation [[Thunderball (novel)|Thunderball]] and was detailed to protect a Russian nuclear expert who defected to the West and who now lives in [[Toronto]], as part of his quest to ferret out [[SPECTRE]]. That night Sluggsy and Horror set fire to the motel and attempt to kill Bond and Viv. A gun battle ensues; the mobsters try to escape by car, but it crashes into a lake after Bond kills Horror. Bond and Viv take shelter in an undamaged cabin, and Bond explains that the mobsters had been hired by Sanguinetti to burn down the motel so he could collect the insurance; Viv was meant to die in the fire and take the blame. Bond and Viv retire to bed, but Sluggsy breaks into the cabin and tries to kill them, having escaped from the sinking car. Bond shoots and kills him.\n\nViv wakes the next morning to find Bond gone, leaving a note in which he promises to send her police assistance and urges her not to dwell too much on the ugly events through which she has just lived. As Viv finishes reading the note, a large police detachment arrives. After taking her statement, the officer in charge of the detail reiterates Bond's advice, but also warns Viv that ''all'' men involved in violent crime and espionage, regardless of which side they are on\u2014including Bond himself\u2014are dangerous and that Viv should avoid them. Viv reflects on this as she motors off, continuing her tour of America, but cherishes the memory of her time with Bond despite the officer's caution.\n\n==Characters and themes==\nContinuation Bond author [[Raymond Benson]] sees Vivienne Michel as the best realised female characterisation undertaken by Fleming, partly because the story is told in the [[first person narrative]].{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=129}} Academic [[Jeremy Black (historian)|Jeremy Black]] notes that Michel is the closest Fleming gets to [[kitchen sink realism]] in the Bond canon:{{sfn|Black|2005|p=71}} she has been a victim of life in the past,{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=129}} but is wilful and tough, too.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=130}}\n\nThe other characters in the novel are given less attention and Vivienne's second lover, Kurt, is a caricature of a cruel German, who forces her to have an abortion before finishing their affair.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=73}} According to Black, the two thugs, Sluggsy and Horror, are \"comic-book villains with comic-book names\".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=74}} Their characters are not given the same status as other villains in Bond stories, but are second-rate professional killers, which makes them more believable in the story.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=130}}\n\nAs with [[Casino Royale (novel)|''Casino Royale'']], the question of morality between Bond and the villains is brought up, again by Bond, but also by the police officer involved.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=129}} Benson argues that this runs counter to another theme in the novel, which had also appeared in a number of other Bond books including [[Goldfinger (novel)|''Goldfinger'']]: the concept of Bond as [[Saint George]] against the dragon.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=129}} In this Black agrees, who sees ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' as being \"an account of the vulnerable under challenge, of the manipulative nature of individuals and of the possibility of being trapped by evil\".{{sfn|Black|2005|p=72}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:GoldeneyeEstate.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Goldeneye, where Fleming wrote all the Bond novels, including ''The Spy Who Loved Me''.]]\n''The Spy Who Loved Me'' was written in Jamaica at Fleming's [[Goldeneye (estate)|Goldeneye estate]] in January and February 1961 and was the shortest manuscript Fleming had produced for a novel, being only 113 pages long.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=21}} Fleming found the book the easiest for him to write and apologised to his editor at Jonathan Cape for the ease.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=381}} ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' has been described by Fleming biographer [[Andrew Lycett]] as Fleming's \"most sleazy and violent story ever\", which may have been indicative of his state of mind at the time.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=381}}\n\nFleming borrowed from his surroundings, as he had done with all his writing up to that point, to include places he had seen. One such location was a motel in the Adirondacks in upstate New York, which Fleming would drive past on the way to Ivar Bryce's Black Hollow Farm; this became the Dreamy Pines Motel.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=186}} Similarly, he took incidents from his own life and used them in the novel: Vivienne Michel's seduction in a box in the Royalty Kinema,<!--Correct spelling with a K - please do not change-->{{sfn|Macintyre|2008|p=31}} Windsor, mirrors Fleming's loss of virginity in the same establishment.{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=11}} A colleague at ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', [[Robert Harling (typographer)|Robert Harling]], gave his name to a printer in the story{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=113}} while another minor character, Frank Donaldson, was named after Jack Donaldson, a friend of Fleming's wife.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=382}} One of Fleming's neighbours in Jamaica was Vivienne Stuart, whose first name Fleming purloined for the novel's heroine.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=382}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n{{Rquote|right|...&nbsp;the experiment has obviously gone very much awry\n|Ian Fleming|in letter to his editor{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=187}}}}\n''The Spy Who Loved Me'' was published in the UK on 16 April 1962 as a hardcover edition by publishers [[Jonathan Cape]]; it was 221 pages long and cost 15 [[shilling]]s.<ref name=\"Times (1962)\"/> Artist [[Richard Chopping]] once again undertook the cover art, and raised his fee from the 200 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] he had charged for [[Thunderball (novel)|''Thunderball'']], to 250 guineas.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=390}} The artwork included a [[Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife|commando knife]] which was borrowed from Fleming's editor, Michael Howard at Jonathan Cape.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|pp=390\u2013391}} ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' was published in the US by [[Viking Press|Viking Books]] on 11 April 1962<ref>{{cite news|title=Books \u2013 Authors|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=29 March 1962|page=30|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1962/03/29/archives/books-authors.html}} {{subscription}}</ref> with 211 pages and costing $3.95.<ref name=\"Time (1962)\"/>\n\nThe reception to the novel was so bad that Fleming wrote to Michael Howard at Jonathan Cape, to explain why he wrote the book: \"I had become increasingly surprised to find my thrillers, which were designed for an adult audience, being read in schools, and that young people were making a hero out of James Bond&nbsp;... So it crossed my mind to write a cautionary tale about Bond, to put the record straight in the minds particularly of younger readers&nbsp;... the experiment has obviously gone very much awry\".{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=187}}\n\nFleming subsequently requested that there should be no reprints or paperback version of the book,{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=402}} and for the British market no paperback version appeared until after Fleming's death.{{sfn|Lycett|1996|p=446}} Because of the heightened sexual writing in the novel, it was banned in a number of countries.{{sfn|Benson|1988|p=23}} In the US the story was also published in [[Stag (magazine)|''Stag'']] magazine, with the title changed to ''Motel Nymph''.{{sfn|Simpson|2002|p=43}}\n\n===Reviews===\nBroadly the critics did not welcome Fleming's experiment with the Bond formula. The academic Christoph Linder points out that ''The Spy Who Loved Me'' received the worst reception of all the Bond books.{{sfn|Black|2005|p=72}} ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', for example, wrote \"Oh Dear Oh Dear Oh Dear! And to think of the books Mr Fleming once wrote!\"{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=187}} while [[The Herald (Glasgow)|''The Glasgow Herald'']] thought Fleming was finished: \"His ability to invent a plot has deserted him almost entirely and he has had to substitute for a fast-moving story the sorry misadventures of an upper-class tramp, told in dreary detail.\"{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=187}} Writing in ''[[The Observer]]'', [[Maurice Richardson]] described the tale as \"a new and regrettable if not altogether unreadable variation\",<ref name=\"Richardson (1962)\">{{cite news|last=Richardson|first=Maurice|authorlink=Maurice Richardson|title=Crime Ration|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=15 April 1962|page=28}}</ref> going on to hope that \"this doesn't spell the total eclipse of Bond in a blaze of cornography\".<ref name=\"Richardson (1962)\"/> Richardson ended his piece by berating Fleming, asking: \"why can't this cunning author write up a bit instead of down?\"<ref name=\"Richardson (1962)\"/> The critic for ''[[The Times]]'' was not dismissive of Bond, who they describe as \"less a person than a cult\"<ref name=\"Times (1962)\">{{cite news|title=New Fiction|newspaper=[[The Times]]|date=19 April 1962|page=15}}</ref> who is \"ruthlessly, fashionably efficient in both love and war\".<ref name=\"Times (1962)\"/> Rather, the critic dismisses the experiment, writing that \"the novel lacks Mr. Fleming's usual careful construction and must be written off as a disappointment.\"<ref name=\"Times (1962)\"/> John Fletcher thought that it was \"as if [[Mickey Spillane]] had tried to gatecrash his way into the Romantic Novelists' Association\".{{sfn|Chancellor|2005|p=187}}\n\nPhilip Stead, writing in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' considered the novel to be \"a morbid version of that of Beauty and the Beast\".<ref name=\"Stead (1962)\">{{cite news|last=Stead|first=Philip John|title=Bond's New Girl|newspaper=The Times Literary Supplement|date=20 April 1962|page=261}}</ref> The review noted that once Bond arrives on the scene to find Michel threatened by the two thugs, he \"solves [the problem] in his usual way.

Fought on 17 February 1782 near present-day [[Kalpakkam]], the battle was tactically indecisive, but the British fleet suffered the most damage. Under Suffren's protection, French troop transports were able to land at [[Parangipettai|Porto Novo]].\n\n==Background==\nFrance had entered the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1778, and Britain declared war on the [[Dutch Republic]] in late 1780 after the Dutch refused to stop trading with the French and the Americans. The British had rapidly gained control over most French and Dutch outposts in India when news of these events reached India, spawning the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]] in the process.\n\nThe French admiral Bailli de Suffren was dispatched for military assistance to French colonies in India, leading a fleet of five ships of the line, seven transports, and a corvette to escort transports from [[Brest, France|Brest]] in March 1781. Suffren was involved in a [[Battle of Porto Praya|happenstance battle]] with a British fleet at [[Porto Praya]] in the [[Cape Verde Islands]] in April. In October, he left reinforcement troops at the Dutch-controlled [[Cape of Good Hope]] to assist with colonial defense. Suffren added some ships to his fleet and sailed on to [[Mauritius|\u00cele de France]], arriving at [[Port Louis, Mauritius|Port Louis]] in December.\n\nAfter further additions at Port Louis, Suffren's fleet sailed for India under the command of the elderly Navy Brigadier General Thomas d'Orves, accompanying transports carrying nearly 3,000 men under the command of the Comte du Chemin.  D'Orves died in February 1782, shortly before the fleet arrived off the Indian coast, and Suffren once again took command.\n\nSuffren first sailed for [[Chennai, India|Madras]], hoping to surprise the British stronghold there. Encountering the fleet of Hughes anchored in Madras on 15 February 1782, Suffren turned south. He intended to land troops at Porto Novo, march up the coast and recapture French and Dutch holdings on the way.  Hughes raised anchor and sailed after Suffren.\n\n==Battle==\nSuffren was hampered with protecting his troop convoys from Hughes, whose goal he presumed was to prevent the troops from landing. Detaching one corvette to protect the convoy and detailing another to watch the British fleet, Suffren attempted to draw Hughes away.  However, under cover of night Hughes managed to slip between Suffren's squadron and the convoys. The signal was raised on the morning of 17 February, and Suffren gave chase to force battle.\n\n[[File:BailliDeSuffrenByBatoni.jpg|left|thumb|upright|French Admiral the Bailli de Suffren]]\nWhen the fleets closed for action around 15:30, some of Suffren's ships had not properly formed the line of battle. Only five of the French ships engaged at first. Of the remaining six, only two joined the action later, with the other four apparently violating Suffren's orders and hanging back.  Suffren, leading in ''H\u00e9ros'', exchanged a broadside with ''Exeter'' before targeting Hughes' flagship ''Superb''. The battle lasted for over three hours, with ''Exeter'' sustaining the worst damage.  She was very nearly sunk, but two French ships were recalled (for reasons unknown) before they could finish her off.  ''Superb'' also suffered significant damage. The battle came to end with the onset of night.\n\n==Aftermath==\nSuffren summoned his captains for council and chastised those that had chosen to stay out of the battle before following the troop convoy to Porto Novo.  There the French army had landed, and Suffren met with the [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysorean]] ruler [[Hyder Ali]] to plan strategy.  After making repairs, Suffren set off to find Hughes again.  The French and Mysorean forces captured [[Cuddalore]], just north of Porto Novo, on 4 April.\n\nHughes sailed for [[Trincomalee]], where he made repairs.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n{|

In the [[Ryder Cup]], Garc\u00eda competed in nine of the ten matches playing during his professional career cumulatively earning a record 25.5 points during those plays.\n\n==Early career==\nGarc\u00eda began playing this sport at the age of three and was taught by his father, Victor, who is a club professional. Garc\u00eda won his club championship at age 12. Four years later, he set a record as the youngest player to make the cut at a European Tour event, the 1995 Turespa\u00f1a Open Mediterranea. This record was broken by amateur Jason Hak in November 2008 at the [[UBS Hong Kong Open]], beating Garc\u00eda's record by 107 days. In 1995, Garc\u00eda became the youngest player to win the [[European Amateur]]. He followed that with a win in the [[Boys Amateur Championship]] in 1997. He won a professional tournament, the 1997 Catalan Open as an amateur. In 1998, he won [[The Amateur Championship]] and reached the semi-finals of the [[U.S. Amateur]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/aug/30/sports/sp-18078 |title=McKnight Bests Garcia to Reach Amateur Final |agency=Associated Press |date=30 August 1998 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> and finished second in the 1998 [[Argentine Open]], being the low amateur and winning the Pereira Iraola Cup.\n\n==Professional career==\nGarc\u00eda turned professional in 2020 after shooting the lowest amateur score in the [[1999 Masters Tournament]].

He was the youngest Tour winner since Tiger Woods in 1996 at age 20. In [[2002 PGA Tour|2002]], Garc\u00eda won the [[Mercedes Championships]] in early January, and in [[2004 PGA Tour|2004]], he won the [[EDS Byron Nelson Championship]] and the Buick Classic for the second time. His sixth PGA Tour victory came at the 2005 [[Booz Allen Classic]]. As of September 2019, he has ten PGA Tour victories, including the 2017 [[Masters Tournament]].

On day two, he paired up with Olaz\u00e1bal again, who won both their matches against [[Phil Mickelson]] and [[Chris DiMarco]] in both the foursomes and fourballs. Going into the final day in the singles, Garc\u00eda was heavily tipped to be the second person to win all their matches in one Ryder Cup; however, [[Stewart Cink]] beat him 4 and 3. Europe won the cup again, with 18\u00bd points to the United States' 9\u00bd points.\n\n===2007: Near-miss at The Open Championship===\nIn April 2014, Garc\u00eda received criticism for a spitting incident at the [[WGC-CA Championship]].

He held the lead after each one of the first three rounds and carried a three-shot lead over [[Steve Stricker]] and a six-shot lead over the rest of the field into the start of the fourth day.\n\nAt an early stage of the last round, Garc\u00eda had extended his lead to four shots, but bogeys at the 5th, 7th, and 8th holes brought him back to the field. On the final challenging hole, he needed a par to win, but failed to get up and down from the greenside bunker. The last putt on the 18th hole on Sunday, from about {{convert|8|ft}}, would have given him his first professional major.

His slump continued into 2010, and after missing the cut at the US [[PGA Championship]], Garc\u00eda announced he was taking a break from golf and would miss the [[2010 Ryder Cup]]. He also dropped out of the top 50 of the [[Official World Golf Rankings]]. Struggles with the putter were the primary cause of his slump, since his ballstriking remained among the best in the world.

Garc\u00eda led the tournament after the 11th hole of the final round with a stunning stretch of holes, which saw him produce three birdies and two eagles in six holes, from holes six to eleven. However his charge to the finish was derailed by four bogeys in five holes, leaving him needing a birdie at the last to make the playoff. In the playoff, both players made consecutive birdies at the first two extra holes (both par 5s) before parring holes three and four (both par 3s). At the fifth extra hole, Garc\u00eda had a {{convert|30|ft|0|adj=on}} eagle putt for the victory, but ran the effort four feet (1.3 m) past the hole.

Garc\u00eda went on to finish tied for 9th place at the Open Championship, his best finish for four years. He continued the run at the 2011 [[PGA Championship]] where he finished in a tie for 12th place, extending his streak to 50 consecutive majors played, the longest streak among active players. In October 2011, Garc\u00eda ended a three-year title drought with back-to-back wins in his home country at the [[Castell\u00f3 Masters]] and the [[Andaluc\u00eda Masters]]. Garc\u00eda won the Castell\u00f3 Masters in dominant fashion, with a final score of 27-under-par, 11 strokes ahead of the field.

Both players hit their approach shots close on the 18th green, but Rose burnt the lip with his birdie putt. Garc\u00eda had a five-foot putt to win the tournament in regulation play but pushed it right resulting in a playoff as both players finished level on 9-under-par after 72 holes.\n\nPlaying the 18th hole again, Rose hit his tee shot into the pine straw, meaning his second shot was blocked off by trees, so could only advance his ball 50 yards or so. He played his third to a similar area of the green he had during regulation play. Garc\u00eda fired his approach to within twelve feet.

Garc\u00eda went after his putt and gave it a quick-rake, and the ball lipped out. Due to the Spaniard's swiftness, Kuchar did not have a chance to concede the putt. As such, Garc\u00eda lost the hole. Kuchar told the official he wanted to give Garc\u00eda the putt, but that cannot be done retroactively. Garc\u00eda eventually lost 2 up to Kuchar, who went on to play in the finals of the event.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbssports.com/golf/news/2019-wgc-match-play-sergio-garcia-wanted-matt-kuchar-to-concede-a-hole-after-botched-putt/ |work=CBS Sports |date=31 March 2019 |access-date=31 March 2019 |title=2019 WGC-Match Play: Sergio Garcia wanted Matt Kuchar to concede a hole after botched putt}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2019, Garc\u00eda missed the cut at the Masters after shooting 73-75, which was won by [[Tiger Woods]], and the missed cut was his 6th straight in a major championship, the longest such streak in his career.\n\nIn July 2019, Garc\u00eda was again mired in controversy after throwing his driver at his caddie at the final round of the [[2019 Open Championship]] after a poor drive at the fifth hole at [[Royal Portrush Golf Club|Royal Portrush]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.golf.com/news/2019/07/24/sergio-garcia-throws-driver-caddie-open/amp/ |date=24 July 2019 |access-date=29 July 2019 |first=Kevin |last=Cunningham |work=Golf.com |title=Sergio Garcia throws driver at caddie Sunday at Portrush in resurfaced video}}</ref> Later that month, footage emerged of Garc\u00eda gouging the [[Teeing ground|teebox]] after a poor drive on the 16th hole, while competing at the [[2019 WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational|WGC-FedEx St. Jude Invitational]] event in Memphis.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/golf/2019/07/29/players-want-sergio-garcia-banned-latest-tantrum/ |title=Players want Sergio Garcia banned after latest tantrum |last=Corrigan |first=James |date=29 July 2019|newspaper=The Telegraph |access-date=30 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2019, Garc\u00eda won the [[KLM Open]] in [[Amsterdam]] with a one-shot win over teenage Danish golfer [[Nicolai H\u00f8jgaard]].

Garc\u00eda won his club championship at age 12. Four years later, he set a record as the youngest player to make the cut at a European Tour event, the 1995 Turespa\u00f1a Open Mediterranea.

He held the lead after each one of the first three rounds and carried a three-shot lead over [[Steve Stricker]] and a six-shot lead over the rest of the field into the start of the fourth day.\n\nAt an early stage of the last round, Garc\u00eda had extended his lead to four shots, but bogeys at the 5th, 7th, and 8th holes brought him back to the field. On the final challenging hole, he needed a par to win, but failed to get up and down from the greenside bunker. The last putt on the 18th hole on Sunday, from about {{convert|8|ft}}, would have given him his first professional major. He missed it by a fraction and faced a four-hole playoff with [[P\u00e1draig Harrington]] that he eventually lost by one stroke.\n\nIn his post-round news conference, Garc\u00eda seemed to suggest that bad breaks had cost him the Open championship. During the playoff, on the long par-3 16th hole, his tee shot hit the flagstick but then bounced {{convert|20|ft|0}} from the pin, off the green, and Garc\u00eda could not convert for birdie. \"It's not the first time, unfortunately,\" he stated. \"I don't know...

Garc\u00eda finished two strokes back for his second runner-up finish at the [[PGA Championship]]. His most serious mistake during the final round was misjudging his second shot on the 16th, playing into a strong wind, which found the water in front of the par-4 hole's green, costing him sole ownership of the lead.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/pgachampionship08/news/story?id=3528657 |title=Harrington catches Garcia, rallies to win second straight major |publisher=ESPN  |date=11 August 2008 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=19 June 2011}}</ref> Regarding another near-miss in a major championship, Garc\u00eda stated, \"I felt like I responded well, and he was obviously very good on the back nine, and things just happened his way.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/11/sports/golf/11golf.html |title=At P.G.A., Harrington Foils Garc\u00eda (Again) |last=Dorman |first=Larry |date=10 August 2008 |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=23 April 2017 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 October 2008, he won his first European Tour title in over three years, at the first playing of the [[Castell\u00f3 Masters Costa Azahar]] at his home course, the [[Club de Campo del Mediterr\u00e1neo]] in Castell\u00f3n, Spain.

This win notched him up to a career high second in the [[Official World Golf Rankings]], replacing [[Phil Mickelson]] in that spot, who had coincidentally won the [[HSBC Champions]] in 2007.

He had more success on the [[European Tour]] where he finished tenth in the inaugural [[Race to Dubai]]. His slump continued into 2010, and after missing the cut at the US [[PGA Championship]], Garc\u00eda announced he was taking a break from golf and would miss the [[2010 Ryder Cup]]. He also dropped out of the top 50 of the [[Official World Golf Rankings]]. Struggles with the putter were the primary cause of his slump, since his ballstriking remained among the best in the world. On 29 August 2010, European captain [[Colin Montgomerie]] announced that Garc\u00eda would be his fourth vice captain for the [[2010 Ryder Cup]] at Celtic Manor.\n\n===2011\u20132012: Return to form===\nGarc\u00eda returned to competitive play in late 2010 with a new putting grip and this produced better results for him on the greens during tournaments in 2011.

He had originally planned against qualifying for the [[2011 U.S. Open (golf)|2011 U.S. Open]], where he was outside the top-50 in the OWGR and was not guaranteed automatic entry. He eventually earned a spot in the U.S. Open after being one of the top four at a qualifying tournament near [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].

Garc\u00eda led the tournament after the 11th hole of the final round with a stunning stretch of holes, which saw him produce three birdies and two eagles in six holes, from holes six to eleven. However his charge to the finish was derailed by four bogeys in five holes, leaving him needing a birdie at the last to make the playoff. In the playoff, both players made consecutive birdies at the first two extra holes (both par 5s) before parring holes three and four (both par 3s). At the fifth extra hole, Garc\u00eda had a {{convert|30|ft|0|adj=on}} eagle putt for the victory, but ran the effort four feet (1.3 m) past the hole.

Garc\u00eda went on to finish tied for 9th place at the Open Championship, his best finish for four years. He continued the run at the 2011 [[PGA Championship]] where he finished in a tie for 12th place, extending his streak to 50 consecutive majors played, the longest streak among active players. In October 2011, Garc\u00eda ended a three-year title drought with back-to-back wins in his home country at the [[Castell\u00f3 Masters]] and the [[Andaluc\u00eda Masters]].

The victory also came on what would have been Ballesteros' 60th birthday.\n\nGarc\u00eda shot rounds of 71-69-70 over the first three rounds to enter the final round at six-under par and in the co-lead with Rose, who played together in the final group. This represented Garc\u00eda's second career 54-hole lead/co-lead at a major championship, after the 2007 Open Championship. Garc\u00eda began the final round strongly, with two birdies on his opening three holes and he forged a three shot lead early on. Rose came back though and following bogeys on the 10th and 11th for Garc\u00eda, Rose opened up a two shot lead.\n\nThe 13th hole was then pivotal, as Garc\u00eda scrambled a par and Rose missed a short birdie putt to keep the gap at two shots. Garc\u00eda would then birdie the next hole and eagle the par five 15th to tie Rose with three holes remaining. They then both hit their tee shots at the 16th close, but only Rose converted, to again lead by one. Rose however would make a mistake at the 17th, leading to a dropped shot and meaning both players were tied going up the 72nd hole. Both players hit their approach shots close on the 18th green, but Rose burnt the lip with his birdie putt. Garc\u00eda had a five-foot putt to win the tournament in regulation play but pushed it right resulting in a playoff as both players finished level on 9-under-par after 72 holes.\n\nPlaying the 18th hole again, Rose hit his tee shot into the pine straw, meaning his second shot was blocked off by trees, so could only advance his ball 50 yards or so. He played his third to a similar area of the green he had during regulation play. Garc\u00eda fired his approach to within twelve feet. Rose's putt for par then missed on the left side of the hole, leaving Garc\u00eda with two putts for the win. He only needed one, as he holed his birdie putt for his first major championship.\n\n====Rest of 2017====\nOn 9 October 2017, it was announced that Garc\u00eda had parted ways with [[TaylorMade]] after 15 years with the equipment brand.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.bunkered.co.uk/golf-news/sergio-garcia-announces-shock-split-from-taylormade |title=Sergio Garcia announces shock split from TaylorMade |date=9 October 2017 |magazine=bunkered |first=Martin |last=Inglis}}</ref>\n\nTwo weeks later, he won the [[Andaluc\u00eda Valderrama Masters]].

One year later, he was promoted as sporting director. In March 2010, he was appointed manager of Nice, alongside of a coach holding the professional trainer diploma, which Roy didn't. In addition to his function as sports director, Roy would receive a salary over 13 months of [[Euro|\u20ac]]17,500 in addition to bonuses.<ref name=ft>[http://www.avosports.fr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=535:le-licenciement-de-lancien-directeur-sportif-de-logc-nice-etait-abusif&catid=36:actualitesjurisprudentielle&Itemid=53 Le licenciement de l'ancien directeur sportif de l'OGC Nice \u00e9tait abusif], avosports.fr, 16 June 2014</ref> He stepped down from the position in November 2011 by mutual agreement while retaining his duties as sports director.\n\n====Sacking and prosecution====\nAfter a phone call in May 2012 for a prior interview, he was officially dismissed for serious misconduct on 11 June 2012. At the end of the dismissal letter, Roy was accused of having made a 12-day trip to Argentina with an unlicensed agent despite opposition from management and without prior preparation.<ref name=ft/> Contesting the reasons for his dismissal, the employee applied to the Nice Labor Court, which by judgment in June 2013, said that the dismissal had no real and serious cause and condemned the employer for payment of the sums of \u20ac22,159 in addition to paid leave relating thereto as a reminder of salary, \u20ac97,500 in addition to paid vacation relating thereto as compensation in lieu of notice, \u20ac113,750 in severance pay, \u20ac37,573 in addition to paid vacation relating to it match and classification bonuses, \u20ac90,000 in addition to paid holidays relating thereto as maintenance bonus, \u20ac300,000 as damages for unfair dismissal, \u20ac3,000 on the basis of the provisions of article 700 of the code of civil procedure besides whole costs.<ref name=ft/>\n\nOGC Nice appealed against that judgment, arguing, first, that Roy should not have received his second remuneration as supervisor from November 2011 to the extent that it was agreed that he would give up, from this date, the daily management of the first team to occupy only its function of sports director. Nice considered, secondly, that the dismissal was perfectly regular, even in the absence of prior referral to the Legal Commission of the Professional Football League, and this insofar as its employee was not covered by the charter professional football, but the collective agreement for administrative and similar football staff (CCPAAF).

At the end of the dismissal letter, Roy was accused of having made a 12-day trip to Argentina with an unlicensed agent despite opposition from management and without prior preparation.<ref name=ft/> Contesting the reasons for his dismissal, the employee applied to the Nice Labor Court, which by judgment in June 2013, said that the dismissal had no real and serious cause and condemned the employer for payment of the sums of \u20ac22,159 in addition to paid leave relating thereto as a reminder of salary, \u20ac97,500 in addition to paid vacation relating thereto as compensation in lieu of notice, \u20ac113,750 in severance pay, \u20ac37,573 in addition to paid vacation relating to it match and classification bonuses, \u20ac90,000 in addition to paid holidays relating thereto as maintenance bonus, \u20ac300,000 as damages for unfair dismissal, \u20ac3,000 on the basis of the provisions of article 700 of the code of civil procedure besides whole costs.<ref name=ft/>\n\nOGC Nice appealed against that judgment, arguing, first, that Roy should not have received his second remuneration as supervisor from November 2011 to the extent that it was agreed that he would give up, from this date, the daily management of the first team to occupy only its function of sports director. Nice considered, secondly, that the dismissal was perfectly regular, even in the absence of prior referral to the Legal Commission of the Professional Football League, and this insofar as its employee was not covered by the charter professional football, but the collective agreement for administrative and similar football staff (CCPAAF). Thirdly, the Club considered that the dismissal of Roy was perfectly justified in view of his insubordination and his lack of loyalty.\n\nThe case ended with Nice paying Roy nearly \u20ac300,000 for a wrongful dismissal.<ref>[https://www.lemonde.fr/sport/article/2013/06/18/l1-nice-condamne-a-verser-689-000-euros-a-eric-roy_3432320_3242.html L1 : Nice condamn\u00e9 \u00e0 verser 689 000 euros \u00e0 Eric Roy, son ex-entra\u00eeneur], lemonde.fr, 18 June 2013</ref>\n\n===Lens===\nOn 30 September 2017, he was appointed sporting director of [[RC Lens]].<ref>[https://www.lavoixdunord.fr/226170/article/2017-09-30/eric-roy-nomme-manager-sportif-de-lens RC LENS \u00c9ric Roy nomm\u00e9 manager sportif de Lens], lavoixdunord.fr, 30 September 2017</ref> He left the position in April 2019.<ref>[https://www.goal.com/fr/news/officiel-eric-roy-quitte-le-rc-lens/yy6l73lub9001dgdc4v3afcrv OFFICIEL - Eric Roy quitte le RC Lens], goal.com, 10 April 2019</ref>\n\n===Watford===\nIn December 2019, Roy took the role of sporting director at [[Premier League]] club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.watfordfc.com/teams/first-team/news-sporting-director-appointment-confirmed|title=News: Sporting Director Appointment Confirmed|website=WatfordFC|language=en|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==TV==\nIn 2012, he became a consultant for the sports channel [[beIN Sports]] where he was a consultant in the program Le Club from Monday to Thursday at 7 p.m. and Friday during the pre-match and the post-match of the Ligue 1 games with Florian Genton.

On a long and intense argument, Annalise accuses Sam of killing Lila and provokes him to do the same to herself \u2013hence the episode title\u2013 and she leaves the house in anger to find comfort on [[List of How to Get Away with Murder characters#Nate Lahey|Nate]].\n\nOn the midst of the Bonfire night celebration, Wes, Connor, and Laurel hurry to the Keating's household to stop Rebecca from hurting her own case. Wes finds out that Rebecca spoke with Nate, and he adviced her to steal phone information from Sam's laptop in an attempt to prove he killed Lila. Wes confesses to the others that he and Rebecca believe Sam killed Lila and had been hiding this knowledge from the group all along.\n\nMichaela, having stolen the trophy from Asher, visits Annalise's house to turn the trophy in and get herself excused from the upcoming exam. Inside, Michaela encounters Sam, who tries to get her to leave, but she insists on staying to give Annalise the trophy. Michaela notices Rebecca breaking in and calls Sam's attention to her, but Sam, thinking the two are involved a joint scheme, becomes hostile. Rebecca tells Michaela to call Wes before running upstairs to Sam's room. Rebecca locks herself in and begins uploading the data evidence from Sam's computer onto Nate's flash drive while Sam shouts and bangs on the door. At the same time, Michaela contacts Wes and explains the situation, begging him and the others to defuse the conflict.\n\nWes and company arrive at Annalise's house just as Rebecca has finished transferring all the evidence onto Nate's flash drive. Rebecca returns Sam's laptop to him and claims having found nothing with which to incriminate him. Sam, knowing this to be a lie, tackles Rebecca and a scuffle for the flash drive ensues. Rebecca passes the drive to Laurel who then flees the room. Sam attempts to chase her but he is shoved by Michaela and accidentally thrown over the stairs. Sam falls down two stories face-first and is motionless; the Keating 4 think he's dead.\n\nAs they all panic and start discussing their options, Sam starts silently choking Rebecca on the living room. Once Wes realizes that, he takes the trophy and hits Sam on the back of his head with it, instantly killing him. Still on shock, Wes cleans up Rebecca upstairs; Laurel cleans the trophy; and both Michaela and Connor freak out on the house about what just happened. Wes tells his friends he's gonna take Rebecca somewhere safe, and asks them to meet him at the woods in an hour.\n\nIn the meantime, after being fired by Annalise, Bonnie almost sleeps with a man on a hotel, but she ends up backing up at the last minute. She decides to call Asher instead, since they will not be working together anymore. Asher celebrates and prepares for spending time with Bonnie.\n\nAs seen on previous flashforwards, the Keating 4 decide to flip a coin and they end up going back into the house to take the body with them. They go on the Middleton woods and are almost caught a couple of times. Wes, Connor and Michaela notice that Frank called Laurel, which results on her telling them that she cheated on her boyfriend with Frank, but she also asks them to judge her while they carry the body through the woods.\n\nLater that night, the group burns Sam's body and then bag his remains for destruction at an incinerator. Michaela loses her engagement ring and attempts to find it in the ashes but is forced by the group to relinquish her search. With Michaela emotionally unable to return the Justice trophy and thus an alibi for the murder weapon, Laurel volunteers herself for the task. Losing control of the situation, Wes cannot convince the group to move forward with the incineration and the party discards Sam's bagged remains into a public dumpster. The group parts ways.\n\nMeanwhile, Annalise confides in Nate her suspicion that Sam murdered Lila and regrets her past efforts to protect Sam's reputation and their marriage. She apologizes for having gotten Nate fired and confesses her feelings for him. Annalise and Nate make love, overwhelmed by the weight of their failing marriages. Asher and Bonnie also have sex on his house, and Bonnie later receives a call from Annalise, telling her that something bad happened and Sam's gone missing.\n\nConnor, on the verge of a nervous breakdown, visits Oliver and spends the night with him. In the morning, he tells Oliver that he has a drug addiction, and that's the reason he had a nervous breakdown last night. Michaela signs a pre-nup deal with her mother-in-law, wearing gloves to prevent her from noticing her ring's missing. Laurel gives Frank the trophy, and asks him to return him, saying that she stole it and she now regrets it. Wes, on the other hand, spends the night with Rebecca on a motel. All of the students get a text message from Annalise that same morning, asking them to come by her house. Once they're all in there, she tells them Sam is missing, and asks them to cooperate with the police investigating into his disappearance since he is now a suspect on Lila Stangard's murder. \n\nIn the final minutes of the episode, a flashback shows that Wes came back to the Keating Household before meeting with his classmates. While looking at Sam's dead body, he says \"I'm so sorry\", but a voice in the background surprises him: Annalise, telling him: \"Don't be\". It is then implied that Wes explained everything to Annalise, and she guided him through the night after they accidentally killed the professor's husband.\n\n== Featured Music ==\n*\"Walk with the Noise\" - [[IAMX]]\n*\"Black Out Days\" - [[Phantogram]]\n*\"Vision\" - [[M83 (band)|M83]]\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Viewers ===\nIn its original American broadcast, the How to Get Away with Murder's \"Kill Me, Kill Me, Kill Me\" was seen by an estimated 9.82 million household viewers and gained a 3.1/10 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349, according to Nielsen Media Research. <ref name=\"1.09\">{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/11/21/thursday-final-ratings-the-big-bang-theory-adjusted-up-gracepoint-reign-parenthood-bad-judge-mom-two-and-a-half-men-the-biggest-loser-a-to-z-adjusted-down/330218/|title=Thursday Final Ratings: 'The Big Bang Theory' Adjusted Up; 'Gracepoint', 'Reign', 'Parenthood', 'Bad Judge', 'Mom', 'Two and a Half Men' 'The Biggest Loser' & 'A to Z' Adjusted Down|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 21, 2014|accessdate=November 21, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123164454/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/11/21/thursday-final-ratings-the-big-bang-theory-adjusted-up-gracepoint-reign-parenthood-bad-judge-mom-two-and-a-half-men-the-biggest-loser-a-to-z-adjusted-down/330218/|archivedate=November 23, 2014}}</ref> This means that 3.1 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 10 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it.

Inside, Michaela encounters Sam, who tries to get her to leave, but she insists on staying to give Annalise the trophy. Michaela notices Rebecca breaking in and calls Sam's attention to her, but Sam, thinking the two are involved a joint scheme, becomes hostile. Rebecca tells Michaela to call Wes before running upstairs to Sam's room. Rebecca locks herself in and begins uploading the data evidence from Sam's computer onto Nate's flash drive while Sam shouts and bangs on the door. At the same time, Michaela contacts Wes and explains the situation, begging him and the others to defuse the conflict.\n\nWes and company arrive at Annalise's house just as Rebecca has finished transferring all the evidence onto Nate's flash drive. Rebecca returns Sam's laptop to him and claims having found nothing with which to incriminate him. Sam, knowing this to be a lie, tackles Rebecca and a scuffle for the flash drive ensues. Rebecca passes the drive to Laurel who then flees the room. Sam attempts to chase her but he is shoved by Michaela and accidentally thrown over the stairs. Sam falls down two stories face-first and is motionless; the Keating 4 think he's dead.\n\nAs they all panic and start discussing their options, Sam starts silently choking Rebecca on the living room. Once Wes realizes that, he takes the trophy and hits Sam on the back of his head with it, instantly killing him. Still on shock, Wes cleans up Rebecca upstairs; Laurel cleans the trophy; and both Michaela and Connor freak out on the house about what just happened. Wes tells his friends he's gonna take Rebecca somewhere safe, and asks them to meet him at the woods in an hour.\n\nIn the meantime, after being fired by Annalise, Bonnie almost sleeps with a man on a hotel, but she ends up backing up at the last minute. She decides to call Asher instead, since they will not be working together anymore. Asher celebrates and prepares for spending time with Bonnie.\n\nAs seen on previous flashforwards, the Keating 4 decide to flip a coin and they end up going back into the house to take the body with them. They go on the Middleton woods and are almost caught a couple of times. Wes, Connor and Michaela notice that Frank called Laurel, which results on her telling them that she cheated on her boyfriend with Frank, but she also asks them to judge her while they carry the body through the woods.\n\nLater that night, the group burns Sam's body and then bag his remains for destruction at an incinerator. Michaela loses her engagement ring and attempts to find it in the ashes but is forced by the group to relinquish her search. With Michaela emotionally unable to return the Justice trophy and thus an alibi for the murder weapon, Laurel volunteers herself for the task. Losing control of the situation, Wes cannot convince the group to move forward with the incineration and the party discards Sam's bagged remains into a public dumpster. The group parts ways.\n\nMeanwhile, Annalise confides in Nate her suspicion that Sam murdered Lila and regrets her past efforts to protect Sam's reputation and their marriage. She apologizes for having gotten Nate fired and confesses her feelings for him. Annalise and Nate make love, overwhelmed by the weight of their failing marriages. Asher and Bonnie also have sex on his house, and Bonnie later receives a call from Annalise, telling her that something bad happened and Sam's gone missing.\n\nConnor, on the verge of a nervous breakdown, visits Oliver and spends the night with him. In the morning, he tells Oliver that he has a drug addiction, and that's the reason he had a nervous breakdown last night. Michaela signs a pre-nup deal with her mother-in-law, wearing gloves to prevent her from noticing her ring's missing. Laurel gives Frank the trophy, and asks him to return him, saying that she stole it and she now regrets it. Wes, on the other hand, spends the night with Rebecca on a motel. All of the students get a text message from Annalise that same morning, asking them to come by her house. Once they're all in there, she tells them Sam is missing, and asks them to cooperate with the police investigating into his disappearance since he is now a suspect on Lila Stangard's murder. \n\nIn the final minutes of the episode, a flashback shows that Wes came back to the Keating Household before meeting with his classmates. While looking at Sam's dead body, he says \"I'm so sorry\", but a voice in the background surprises him: Annalise, telling him: \"Don't be\". It is then implied that Wes explained everything to Annalise, and she guided him through the night after they accidentally killed the professor's husband.\n\n== Featured Music ==\n*\"Walk with the Noise\" - [[IAMX]]\n*\"Black Out Days\" - [[Phantogram]]\n*\"Vision\" - [[M83]]\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Viewers ===\nIn its original American broadcast, the How to Get Away with Murder's \"Kill Me, Kill Me, Kill Me\" was seen by an estimated 9.82 million household viewers and gained a 3.1/10 ratings share among adults aged 18\u201349, according to Nielsen Media Research. <ref name=\"1.09\">{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/11/21/thursday-final-ratings-the-big-bang-theory-adjusted-up-gracepoint-reign-parenthood-bad-judge-mom-two-and-a-half-men-the-biggest-loser-a-to-z-adjusted-down/330218/|title=Thursday Final Ratings: 'The Big Bang Theory' Adjusted Up; 'Gracepoint', 'Reign', 'Parenthood', 'Bad Judge', 'Mom', 'Two and a Half Men' 'The Biggest Loser' & 'A to Z' Adjusted Down|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|work=TV by the Numbers|date=November 21, 2014|accessdate=November 21, 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141123164454/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/11/21/thursday-final-ratings-the-big-bang-theory-adjusted-up-gracepoint-reign-parenthood-bad-judge-mom-two-and-a-half-men-the-biggest-loser-a-to-z-adjusted-down/330218/|archivedate=November 23, 2014}}</ref> This means that 3.1 percent of all households with televisions watched the episode, while 10 percent of all households watching television at that time watched it.

Its first products included [[agricultural]] machinery and two strokes' moped engines based on Zundapp ones. By 1967 it was producing complete motorcycles, the first one being a scooter, the S170 Carina - a copy of the Zundapp R50 - with a 50cc and 4 speed engine. Shortly after it rolled out its first mopeds, the K160, K161, K162 and K163 with two speeds, and the K181 with four speeds. Although most of its production were mopeds, it also produced 125cc bikes, namely the K260, K270 and K276 all, and it had an advanced plan for a 250cc, the K280. Its range included some 30 or more models, with automatic engines, 2 speed, 4 speed, 5 speed and 6 speed engines Even though its main market was, by far, the domestic market, it also exported some 10% of its production, mostly to the UK, Netherlands, Denmark and Sweden. It also had a promising joint venture with Solo of Germany under which some models were sold in the German market under the Solo brand. Car production was also planned, but not realised. As the increased purchasing power in their home country Portugal, their most important market, slowed down the sales of mopeds, bankruptcy was a fact in February 2000.

It is presented by [[Tyler Mathisen]], [[Melissa Lee (journalist)|Melissa Lee]], and [[Kelly Evans]].\n\n==History==\nBill Griffeth anchored the program alone from 1996 to 2002. Caruso-Cabrera joined as Griffeth's original co-presenter from February 4, 2002 to December 5, 2003, before being replaced by [[Sue Herera]], who debuted three days later. Caruso-Cabrera and Dennis Kneale appeared regularly in their respective analyst capacities until both became full co-presenters in 2009. Mathisen joined the program on December 14, 2009, after Griffeth's leave of absence began.\n\n''Power Lunch'' originally aired for two hours (noon to 2 ET) until June 7, 2010, when it moved to 1 ET, with its run-time cut to 1 hour, making room for ''[[The Strategy Session]]'' at noon ET and the ''[[Fast Money (CNBC)|Fast Money Halftime Report]]'' at 12:30 ET. The show became a 2-hour program once again on February 9, 2015, with run-time then from 1-3 p.m. ET, replacing ''[[Street Signs (TV series)|Street Signs]]'' (which aired its final edition three days prior). Sullivan and [[Amanda Drury]], both of whom previously co-anchored ''Street Signs'', joined the program the same day, along with current ''[[Fast Money (CNBC)|Fast Money]]'' and ''[[Options Action]]'' host Melissa Lee.  They replaced Herera, who left three days earlier.  Caruso-Cabrera rejoined the program for her third stint as co-presenter on January 19, 2016 after Amanda Drury's departure from CNBC US (in the case of the latter, she rejoined [[CNBC Asia]] as a [[Sydney]]-based correspondent that July). On March 12, 2018, Sara Eisen (previously co-anchor of ''[[Worldwide Exchange]]'' and currently co-anchor of ''[[Squawk on the Street]]'') and Brian Sullivan swapped their respective anchor roles, with Eisen moving to ''Power Lunch'' and Sullivan moving to ''Worldwide Exchange''.  On November 30, 2018, Eisen and [[Kelly Evans]] swapped their respective anchor roles, with the former moving to ''[[Closing Bell]]'' and Evans moving to ''Power Lunch''. On January 7, 2019 ''Power Lunch'' was halved in length due to the launch of a new program, ''[[The Exchange (CNBC)|The Exchange]]'', presented by Kelly Evans. Consequently, ''Power Lunch'' is once again a 60-minute program, running between 2 pm and 3 pm ET.\n\nOn October 13, 2014, ''Power Lunch'' was launched in full 1080i high-definition as part of CNBC's network-wide switch to a full 16:9 letterbox format.\n\n==Overview==\nThis program examines the businesses, people, and trends that influence [[Wall Street]], in addition to real-time market coverage at roughly the midway point of the U.S. trading day.\n\n==Present segments==\n*'''CNBC 101:''' [[Bob Pisani]] presents the \"CNBC 101\" segment on Thursdays.\n*'''News Update:''' News headlines from outside the world of business, broadcast at 2.30pm ET.\n*'''Econo Smackdown:''' Seen during the first hour with [[Steve Liesman]] (in studio) and [[Rick Santelli]] (in [[Chicago]]).\n*'''Trader Triple Play:''' Seen on Fridays during the second hour as three Wall Street traders join the program (either via satellite or in-studio) to talk about the three key economic diaries in which investors and viewers need to know for the coming week.\n*'''Markets Minute By Minute:''' A guest (or two guests) join the program to tell viewers and the show's anchors what is moving the markets.\n*'''Around the Watercooler:''' This is a segment in which the anchors talk about the day's biggest topics (inside and outside the business world) from behind their respective desks.\n\n==Past segments==\n*'''Dow Jones Halftime Report:''' Presented by [[Bob O'Brien]] and [[Ray Hennessey]] (both [[Dow Jones Newswires]] employees at the time), highlighting winning or losing sectors of the trading day.\n*'''Making Money Now:''' Seen during the second hour of the program from April to August 2005, ending with the \"Lightning Round\" (which was unrelated to the most popular segment on ''[[Mad Money]]'') in which the stock pickers had 15 seconds to decide if the stock given by the anchors are a buy, sell, or a hold.

It is presented by [[Tyler Mathisen]], [[Melissa Lee (journalist)|Melissa Lee]] and [[Kelly Evans]].\n\n==History==\nBill Griffeth anchored the program alone from 1996 to 2002. Caruso-Cabrera joined as Griffeth's original co-presenter from February 4, 2002 to December 5, 2003, before being replaced by [[Sue Herera]], who debuted three days later. Caruso-Cabrera and Dennis Kneale appeared regularly in their respective analyst capacities until both became full co-presenters in 2009. Mathisen joined the program on December 14, 2009, after Griffeth's leave of absence began.\n\n''Power Lunch'' originally aired for two hours (noon to 2 ET) until June 7, 2010, when it moved to 1 ET, with its run-time cut to 1 hour, making room for ''[[The Strategy Session]]'' at noon ET and the ''[[Fast Money (CNBC)|Fast Money Halftime Report]]'' at 12:30 ET. The show became a 2-hour program once again on February 9, 2015, with run-time then from 1-3 p.m. ET, replacing ''[[Street Signs (TV series)|Street Signs]]'' (which aired its final edition three days prior). Sullivan and [[Amanda Drury]], both of whom previously co-anchored ''Street Signs'', joined the program the same day, along with current ''[[Fast Money (CNBC)|Fast Money]]'' and ''[[Options Action]]'' host Melissa Lee.  They replaced Herera, who left three days earlier.  Caruso-Cabrera rejoined the program for her third stint as co-presenter on January 19, 2016 after Amanda Drury's departure from CNBC US (in the case of the latter, she rejoined [[CNBC Asia]] as a [[Sydney]]-based correspondent that July). On March 12, 2018, Sara Eisen (previously co-anchor of ''[[Worldwide Exchange]]'' and currently co-anchor of ''[[Squawk on the Street]]'') and Brian Sullivan swapped their respective anchor roles, with Eisen moving to ''Power Lunch'' and Sullivan moving to ''Worldwide Exchange''.  On November 30, 2018, Eisen and [[Kelly Evans]] swapped their respective anchor roles, with the former moving to ''[[Closing Bell]]'' and Evans moving to ''Power Lunch''. On January 7, 2019 ''Power Lunch'' was halved in length due to the launch of a new program, ''[[The Exchange (CNBC)|The Exchange]]'', presented by Kelly Evans. Consequently, ''Power Lunch'' is once again a 60-minute program, running between 2 pm and 3 pm ET.\n\nOn October 13, 2014, ''Power Lunch'' was launched in full 1080i high-definition as part of CNBC's network-wide switch to a full 16:9 letterbox format.\n\n==Overview==\nThis program examines the businesses, people, and trends that influence [[Wall Street]], in addition to real-time market coverage at roughly the midway point of the U.S. trading day.\n\n==Present segments==\n*'''CNBC 101:''' [[Bob Pisani]] presents the \"CNBC 101\" segment on Thursdays.\n*'''News Update:''' News headlines from outside the world of business, broadcast at 2.30pm ET.\n*'''Econo Smackdown:''' Seen during the first hour with [[Steve Liesman]] (in studio) and [[Rick Santelli]] (in [[Chicago]]).\n*'''Trader Triple Play:''' Seen on Fridays during the second hour as three Wall Street traders join the program (either via satellite or in-studio) to talk about the three key economic diaries in which investors and viewers need to know for the coming week.\n*'''Markets Minute By Minute:''' A guest (or two guests) join the program to tell viewers and the show's anchors what is moving the markets.\n*'''Around the Watercooler:''' This is a segment in which the anchors talk about the day's biggest topics (inside and outside the business world) from behind their respective desks.\n\n==Past segments==\n*'''Dow Jones Halftime Report:''' Presented by [[Bob O'Brien]] and [[Ray Hennessey]] (both [[Dow Jones Newswires]] employees at the time), highlighting winning or losing sectors of the trading day.\n*'''Making Money Now:''' Seen during the second hour of the program from April to August 2005, ending with the \"Lightning Round\" (which was unrelated to the most popular segment on ''[[Mad Money]]'') in which the stock pickers had 15 seconds to decide if the stock given by the anchors are a buy, sell, or a hold.  This segment was discontinued as of September 2005.\n*'''Power Poll:''' Moved to the ''[[Closing Bell]]'' in April 2005, and was renamed the ''Closing Bell Poll''.

The second type of Blount's disease is found mostly in older children and in teenagers, sometimes in one leg and sometimes in both; the patient's age determines how severe the diagnosis is.<ref>{{cite web |last=Shriner's |first=Hospital for Children \u2013 Houston, TX |title=Blount's Disease |url=http://www.shrinershospitalsforchildren.org/en/Hospitals/Locations/Houston/Orthopaedics/Blounts.aspx |accessdate=October 28, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126055643/http://www.shrinershospitalsforchildren.org/en/Hospitals/Locations/Houston/Orthopaedics/Blounts.aspx |archivedate=November 26, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Osteochondrodysplasia=== \n[[Osteochondrodysplasia]] are a diverse group of genetic bone diseases or genetic skeletal dysplasias that manifest in generalized bone deformities involving the extremities and the spine.

The black line is the mechanical axis. This process may be done to correct a [[varus deformity]].]]\nGenerally, no treatment is required for idiopathic presentation as it is a normal anatomical variant in young children. Treatment is indicated when it persists beyond 3 and a half years old. In the case of unilateral presentation or progressive worsening of the curvature, when caused by [[rickets]], the most important thing is to treat the constitutional [[disease]], at the same time instructing the care-giver never to place the child on its feet. In many cases this is quite sufficient in itself to effect a cure, but matters can be hastened somewhat by applying [[splint (medicine)|splints]]. When the deformity arises in older patients, either from [[physical trauma|trauma]] or occupation, the only permanent treatment is [[surgery]], but [[orthopaedic]] bracing can provide relief.\n\n===Rickets===\n[[Rickets]] usually causes bone deformities in all four extremities. Genu varum may resolve spontaneously with modification of life style activities or after receiving medical treatment. Some deformities do not correct spontaneously and need surgical intervention especially if they are severe and causing gait difficulties. The main surgical modality used to treat genu varum arising from [[rickets]] is guided growth surgery, also known as growth modulation surgery.<ref name=JAAOSGlobal></ref> \n\n===Blount's disease===\nTreatment for children with Blount's disease is typically braces but surgery may also be necessary. In children guided growth surgery is used to gradually correct/straighten the bow legs.<ref name=Orthop2019>{{cite journal|last1= Journeau|first1=P| title= Update on guided growth concepts around the knee in children.|journal= Orthop Traumatol Surg Res|volume=S1877-0568|issue=19|pages=S171\u2013S180|doi=10.1016/j.otsr.2019.04.025|pmid=31669550|year=2020}}</ref>  For teenagers osteotomy or bone cutting is often used to correct the bone deformity. The operation consists of removing a piece of tibia, breaking the fibula and straightening out the bone; there is also a choice of elongating the legs. If not treated early enough, the condition worsens quickly.<ref>{{cite web|last=PubMed|first=Health|title=Blount's Disease|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0002551/|accessdate=October 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Osteochondrodysplasia===                        \nGuided growth surgery in children is widely used to achieve gradual correction of knee deformities arising from [[Osteochondrodysplasia]] including genu varum.
