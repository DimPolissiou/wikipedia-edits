The upperclassmen ordered the freshmen to find a way to keep the women entertained.  Several freshmen sneaked into a maintenance closet and changed into white coveralls.

These vessels were used primarily for training and for coastal patrol duties. The 3rd Fleet came under the aegis of the [[Combined Fleet]] for the duration of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] from March 1904. Although initially derided as a \"dinosaur fleet\",<ref>Jukes, ''The Russo-Japanese War''</ref> the 3rd fleet proved invaluable at the [[Battle of Tsushima]] and the Invasion of [[Sakhalin]]. It was disbanded on 20 December 1905.\n\n==South China Fleet==\nThe 3rd Fleet was revived on 24 December 1908 as an expeditionary force during the [[Xinhai Revolution|Chinese Republican Revolution]], to safeguard Japanese interests (civilians and property) on the [[China|Chinese mainland]] and (if necessary) to conduct emergency evacuation. It was nicknamed the \"[[South China Fleet]]\" after its chief area of envisioned activity was the South China Sea. Its [[cruiser]]s patrolled the [[Yangtze River]] and other large rivers in China, and its headquarters was in the Japanese concession in [[Shanghai]]. It was disbanded on 25 December 1915.\n\n==World War I==\nThe 3rd Fleet was reconstituted on the same day as the dissolution of the \"South China Fleet\", initially to act as a training force to supplement Japan's contribution to the World War I under the terms of the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]]. When the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] was proclaimed by the [[communist]] forces in Russia, the mission of the 3rd Fleet was changed to that of patrols of the Russian sea coast for the [[Siberian Intervention]] by Japanese ground forces in support of anti-[[Bolshevik]] forces. The 3rd Fleet was disbanded on 1 December 1922, and many of its vessels were scrapped almost immediately under the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]].\n\n==First China Expeditionary Fleet==\nThe 3rd Fleet was again raised on 2 February 1938 as part of Japan's emergency buildup of forces after the [[January 28 Incident|Shanghai Incident]]. The buildup took the form of three separate expeditionary fleets, consisting primarily of cruisers and gunboats to patrol the Chinese coast and major riverways and to support the landings of Japanese ground forces. With the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937, the 3rd Fleet came under the aegis of the [[China Area Fleet]]. It was disbanded on 15 November 1939; however, some of the organizational and command structures for ground forces under the [[First China Expeditionary Fleet]] remained in place until August 1943.\n\n==Southern Expeditionary Fleet==\nThe 3rd Fleet was recreated once again on 10 April 1941 with the additional designation \"Southern Expeditionary Fleet\" for the specific task of invading the [[Philippine islands]].

It was centered on the new aircraft carriers {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh\u014dkaku||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}}. It played an important role during the [[Pyrrhic victory]] at the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|Battle of Santa Cruz]], in which the American aircraft carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}} was sunk, but at the cost of many of the best air crews in the Japanese Navy.\n\nAfter March 1944, the 3rd Fleet was basically merged with the [[2nd Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|2nd Fleet]], and suffered through the disastrous [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], losing 3 of its aircraft carriers, including the newly commissioned {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Taih\u014d||2}} and over 350 carrier planes.\n\nIn October 1944, the 3rd Fleet was designated the \"Northern Force\" in a three-force plan to defeat the [[Battle of Leyte|Allied invasion]] of the Japanese-held Philippines. The 3rd Fleet carriers were divested of all but 108 aircraft and sent to lure the American-led fleet away from protecting the troop landing ships.

(IJN), which was created, and subsequently disbanded on six separate occasions and revived on five separate occasions.\n\n=History=\n==Russo-Japanese War==\nFirst established on 28 December 1903, the 3rd Fleet was created by the [[Imperial General Headquarters]] as an administrative unit to manage vessels considered obsolete for front-line combat service. These vessels were used primarily for training and for coastal patrol duties. The 3rd Fleet came under the aegis of the [[Combined Fleet]] for the duration of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] from March 1904. Although initially derided as a \"dinosaur fleet\",<ref>Jukes, ''The Russo-Japanese War''</ref> the 3rd fleet proved invaluable at the [[Battle of Tsushima]] and the Invasion of [[Sakhalin]]. It was disbanded on 20 December 1905.\n\n==South China Fleet==\nThe 3rd Fleet was revived on 24 December 1908 as an expeditionary force during the [[Xinhai Revolution|Chinese Republican Revolution]], to safeguard Japanese interests (civilians and property) on the [[China|Chinese mainland]] and (if necessary) to conduct emergency evacuation. It was nicknamed the \"[[South China Fleet]]\" after its chief area of envisioned activity was the South China Sea. Its [[cruiser]]s patrolled the [[Yangtze River]] and other large rivers in China, and its headquarters was in the Japanese concession in [[Shanghai]]. It was disbanded on 25 December 1915.\n\n==World War I==\nThe 3rd Fleet was reconstituted on the same day as the dissolution of the \"South China Fleet\", initially to act as a training force to supplement Japan's contribution to the World War I under the terms of the [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance]]. When the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] was proclaimed by the [[communist]] forces in Russia, the mission of the 3rd Fleet was changed to that of patrols of the Russian sea coast for the [[Siberian Intervention]] by Japanese ground forces in support of anti-[[Bolshevik]] forces. The 3rd Fleet was disbanded on 1 December 1922, and many of its vessels were scrapped almost immediately under the terms of the [[Washington Naval Treaty]].\n\n==First China Expeditionary Fleet==\nThe 3rd Fleet was again raised on 2 February 1938 as part of Japan's emergency buildup of forces after the [[January 28 Incident|Shanghai Incident]]. The buildup took the form of three separate expeditionary fleets, consisting primarily of cruisers and gunboats to patrol the Chinese coast and major riverways and to support the landings of Japanese ground forces. With the outbreak of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] in 1937, the 3rd Fleet came under the aegis of the [[China Area Fleet]]. It was disbanded on 15 November 1939; however, some of the organizational and command structures for ground forces under the [[First China Expeditionary Fleet]] remained in place until August 1943.\n\n==Southern Expeditionary Fleet==\nThe 3rd Fleet was recreated once again on 10 April 1941 with the additional designation \"Southern Expeditionary Fleet\" for the specific task of invading the [[Philippine islands]]. At the time of the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], its headquarters was in [[Palau]] and its mission expanded to include the invasions of [[Java]], [[Borneo]] and other islands of the [[Netherlands East Indies]]. It was superseded by the [[Southern Expeditionary Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)#2nd Southern Expeditionary Fleet|2nd Southern Expeditionary Fleet]] under the aegis of the [[Southwest Area Fleet]] on 10 March 1942.\n\n===Order of Battle at time of Pearl Harbor===\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n:Based at Takao, Formosa<ref>{{Cite web|first1=Leo  |last1=Niehorster |first2=Al |last2=Alsleben |first3=Tadashi  |last3=Yoda  |title= Administrative Order of Battle -

It was centered on the new aircraft carriers {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Sh\u014dkaku||2}} and {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Zuikaku||2}}. It played an important role during the [[Pyrrhic victory]] at the [[Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands|Battle of Santa Cruz]], in which the American aircraft carrier {{USS|Hornet|CV-8|2}} was sunk, but at the cost of many of the best air crews in the Japanese Navy.\n\nAfter March 1944, the 3rd Fleet was basically merged with the [[2nd Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|2nd Fleet]], and suffered through the disastrous [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]], losing 3 of its aircraft carriers, including the newly commissioned {{ship|Japanese aircraft carrier|Taih\u014d||2}} and over 350 carrier planes.\n\nIn October 1944, the 3rd Fleet was designated the \"Northern Force\" in a three-force plan to defeat the [[Battle of Leyte|Allied invasion]] of the Japanese-held Philippines. The 3rd Fleet carriers were divested of all but 108 aircraft and sent to lure the American-led fleet away from protecting the troop landing ships.

Please do not add sub-genres without discussion there.--> adapted, produced, and directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]], based on [[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. It employs disturbing, violent images to comment on [[psychiatry]], [[juvenile delinquency]], youth gangs, and other social, political, and economic subjects in a dystopian near-future Britain.\n\n[[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]] ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), the central character, is a charismatic, antisocial delinquent <!-- See section below #Differences_between_the_film_and_the_novel for discussion about last name -->whose interests include [[classical music]] (especially [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]), committing rape, theft and what is termed \"ultra-violence\". He leads a small gang of thugs, Pete ([[Michael Tarn]]), Georgie ([[James Marcus (English actor)|James Marcus]]), and Dim ([[Warren Clarke]]), whom he calls his ''droogs'' (from the [[Russian language|Russian]] word \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433, \"friend\", \"buddy\"). The film chronicles the horrific crime spree of his gang, his capture, and attempted rehabilitation via an experimental psychological conditioning technique (the \"Ludovico Technique\") promoted by the Minister of the Interior ([[Anthony Sharp]]). Alex narrates most of the film in [[Nadsat]], a fractured adolescent slang composed of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] (especially Russian), English, and [[Cockney rhyming slang]].\n\n[[A Clockwork Orange (soundtrack)|The soundtrack to ''A Clockwork Orange'']] features mostly classical music selections and [[Moog synthesizer]] compositions by [[Wendy Carlos]]. The artwork for the poster of ''A Clockwork Orange'' was created by [[Philip Castle]] with the layout by designer [[Bill Gold]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per Film project guidelines, please keep this plot section between 400 and 700 words long. -->\nIn a futuristic Britain, Alex DeLarge is the leader of a gang of \"droogs\": Georgie, Dim and Pete. One night, after getting intoxicated on drug-laden \"milk-plus\", they engage in an evening of \"ultra-violence\", which includes a fight with a rival gang. They drive to the country home of writer F. Alexander and beat him to the point of crippling him for life. Alex then rapes Alexander's wife while singing [[Singin' in the Rain (song)|\"Singin' in the Rain\"]]. The next day, while truant from school, Alex is approached by his probation officer P. R. Deltoid, who is aware of Alex's activities and cautions him.\n\nAlex's droogs express discontent with petty crime and want more equality and high-yield thefts, but Alex asserts his authority by attacking them. Later, Alex invades the home of a wealthy \"cat-lady\" and bludgeons her with a phallic sculpture while his droogs remain outside. On hearing sirens, Alex tries to flee but Dim smashes a bottle in his face, stunning him and leaving him to be arrested. With Alex in custody, Deltoid gloats that the cat-lady died, making Alex a murderer. He is sentenced to fourteen years in prison.\n\nTwo years into the sentence, Alex eagerly takes up an offer to be a test subject for the Minister of the Interior's new Ludovico technique, an experimental [[aversion therapy]] for rehabilitating criminals within two weeks. Alex is strapped to a chair, his eyes are clamped open and he is injected with drugs. He is then forced to watch films of sex and violence, some of which are accompanied by the music of his favourite composer, Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex becomes nauseated by the films and, fearing the technique will make him sick upon hearing Beethoven, begs for an end to the treatment.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Minister demonstrates Alex's rehabilitation to a gathering of officials. Alex is unable to fight back against an actor who taunts and attacks him and becomes ill wanting sex with a topless woman. The prison chaplain complains that Alex has been robbed of his free will; the Minister asserts that the Ludovico technique will cut crime and alleviate crowding in prisons.\n\nAlex is let out as a free man, only to find that the police have sold his possessions as compensation to his victims and his parents have let out his room. Alex encounters an elderly vagrant whom he attacked years earlier, and the vagrant and his friends attack him. Alex is saved by two policemen but is shocked to find they are his former droogs Dim and Georgie. They drive him to the countryside, beat him up, and nearly drown him before abandoning him. Alex barely makes it to the doorstep of a nearby home before collapsing.\n\nAlex wakes up to find himself in the home of Alexander, where he is being cared for by Alexander's manservant, Julian. Alexander does not recognise Alex from the previous attack but knows of Alex and the Ludovico technique from the newspapers. He sees Alex as a political weapon and prepares to present him to his colleagues. While bathing, Alex breaks into \"Singin' in the Rain\", causing Alexander to realise that Alex was the person who assaulted him and his wife. With help from his colleagues, Alexander drugs Alex and locks him in an upstairs bedroom. He then plays Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] loudly from the floor below. Unable to withstand the sickening pain, Alex attempts suicide by throwing himself out the window.\n\nAlex wakes up in a hospital with broken bones. While being given a series of psychological tests, he finds that he no longer has aversions to violence and sex. The Minister arrives and apologises to Alex. He offers to take care of Alex and get him a job in return for his co-operation with his election campaign and public relations counter-offensive. As a sign of good will, the Minister brings in a stereo system playing Beethoven's Ninth. Alex then contemplates violence and has vivid thoughts of having sex with a woman in front of an approving crowd, and thinks to himself, \"I was cured, all right!\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Malcolm McDowell Clockwork Orange.png|thumb|Malcolm McDowell as Alex DeLarge.]]\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as [[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex DeLarge]]\n* [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]] as Mr Frank Alexander\n* [[Michael Bates (actor)|Michael Bates]] as Chief Guard Barnes\n* [[Warren Clarke]] as Dim\n* [[John Clive]] as Stage Actor\n* [[Adrienne Corri]] as Mrs Mary Alexander\n* [[Carl Duering]] as Dr Brodsky\n* [[Paul Farrell]] as Tramp\n* [[Clive Francis]] as Joe the Lodger\n* [[Michael Gover]] as Prison Governor\n* [[Miriam Karlin]] as Catlady\n* [[James Marcus (English actor)|James Marcus]] as Georgie\n* [[Aubrey Morris]] as P.

It is, at the same time, a running lecture on free-will.}}\nAfter aversion therapy, Alex behaves like a good member of society, though not through choice. His goodness is involuntary; he has become the titular clockwork orange\u2014organic on the outside, mechanical on the inside. After Alex has undergone the Ludovico technique, the chaplain criticises his new attitude as false, arguing that true goodness ''must'' come from within.

Mr Alexander fears the new government; in a telephone conversation, he says:\n{{Cquote|Recruiting brutal young roughs into the police; proposing debilitating and will-sapping techniques of conditioning. Oh, we've seen it all before in other countries; the thin end of the wedge! Before we know where we are, we shall have the full apparatus of [[totalitarianism]].}}\n\nOn the other side, the Minister of the Interior (the Government) jails Mr Alexander (the Dissident Intellectual) on the excuse of his endangering Alex (the People), rather than the government's totalitarian regime (described by Mr Alexander). It is unclear whether or not he has been harmed; however, the Minister tells Alex that the writer has been denied the ability to write and produce \"subversive\" material that is critical of the incumbent government and meant to provoke political unrest.\n\n===Psychology===\n[[File:LudovicoMalcolmMcDowellAClockworkOrangetrailer.png|thumb|Ludovico technique apparatus]]\nAnother target of criticism is the [[behaviourism]] or \"behavioural psychology\" propounded by psychologists [[John B. Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner]]. Burgess disapproved of behaviourism, calling Skinner's book ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]]'' (1971) \"one of the most dangerous books ever written\". Although behaviourism's limitations were conceded by its principal founder, Watson, Skinner argued that [[behaviour modification]]\u2014specifically, [[operant conditioning]] (learned behaviours via systematic reward-and-punishment techniques) rather than the [[Classical conditioning|\"classical\" Watsonian conditioning]]\u2014is the key to an ideal society. The film's Ludovico technique is widely perceived as a parody of [[aversion therapy]], which is a form of classical conditioning.<ref>{{cite web |author=Theodore Dalrymple |title=A Prophetic and Violent Masterpiece |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_1_oh_to_be.html |work=City Journal |date=1 January 2006 |accessdate=13 March 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201170544/http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_1_oh_to_be.html | archive-date=1 February 2011 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Paul Duncan said of Alex: \"Alex is the narrator so we see everything from his point of view, including his mental images.

Sound: 225,880 feet printed from 288 1/4\" reel to reel tapes.\n\n===Adaptation===\nThe cinematic adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'' (1962) was not initially planned. [[Screenwriter|Screenplay writer]] [[Terry Southern]] gave Kubrick a copy of the novel, but, as he was developing a [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]-related project, Kubrick put it aside. Kubrick's wife, in an interview, stated she then gave him the novel after having read it. It had an immediate impact. Of his enthusiasm for it, Kubrick said, \"I was excited by everything about it: the plot, the ideas, the characters, and, of course, the language. The story functions, of course, on several levels: political, sociological, philosophical, and, what's most important, on a dreamlike psychological-symbolic level.\" Kubrick wrote a screenplay faithful to the novel, saying, \"I think whatever Burgess had to say about the story was said in the book, but I did invent a few useful narrative ideas and reshape some of the scenes.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0012.html |title=The Kubrick Site: The ACO Controversy in the UK |website=Visual-memory.co.uk |date= |accessdate=13 March 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BTHAmrtn?url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0012.html |archive-date=17 October 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Kubrick based the script on the shortened US edition of the book, which omitted the final chapter.\n\n====Novelist's response====\nBurgess had mixed feelings about the film adaptation of his novel, publicly saying he loved [[Malcolm McDowell]] and [[Michael Bates (actor)|Michael Bates]], and the use of music; he praised it as \"brilliant\", even so brilliant that it might be dangerous. Despite this enthusiasm, he was concerned that it lacked the novel's [[A Clockwork Orange (novel)#Omission of the final chapter|redemptive final chapter]], an absence he blamed upon his American publisher and not Kubrick. All US editions of the novel prior to 1986 omitted the final chapter.\n\nBurgess reports in his autobiography ''You've Had Your Time''&nbsp;(1990) that he and Kubrick at first enjoyed a good relationship, each holding similar philosophical and political views and each very interested in literature, cinema, music, and Napoleon Bonaparte. Burgess's novel ''[[Napoleon Symphony]]'' (1974) was dedicated to Kubrick. Their relationship soured when Kubrick left Burgess to defend the film from accusations of glorifying violence. A [[lapsed Catholic]], Burgess tried many times to explain the Christian moral points of the story to outraged Christian organisations and to defend it against newspaper accusations that it supported fascist dogma. He also went to receive awards given to Kubrick on his behalf. Despite the benefits Burgess made from the film, he was in no way involved in the production of the book's adaptation. The only profit he made directly from the film was the initial $500 that was given to him for the rights to the adaptation.\n\n===Direction===\nKubrick was a perfectionist who researched meticulously, with thousands of photographs taken of potential locations, as well as many scene takes; however, per Malcolm McDowell, he usually \"got it right\" early on, so there were few takes. So meticulous was Kubrick that McDowell stated \"If Kubrick hadn't been a film director he'd have been a General Chief of Staff of the US Forces. No matter what it is\u2014even if it's a question of buying a shampoo it goes through him. He just likes total control.\"{{sfn|Baxter|1997|pp=6-7}} Filming took place between September 1970 and April 1971, making ''A Clockwork Orange'' the quickest film shoot in his career.

The teenage slang has a heavily Russian influence, as in the novel; Burgess explains the slang as being, in part, intended to draw a reader into the world of the book's characters and to prevent the book from becoming outdated. There is some evidence to suggest that the society is a socialist one, or perhaps a society evolving from a failed socialism into a fully authoritarian society. In the novel, streets have paintings of working men in the style of Russian socialist art, and in the film, there is a mural of socialist artwork with obscenities drawn on it. As Malcolm McDowell points out on the DVD commentary, Alex's residence was shot on failed municipal architecture, and the name \"Municipal Flat Block 18A, Linear North\" alludes to socialist-style housing.<ref name=\"Ciment1982Clockwork \">[[#Ciment1982Clockwork|Ciment 1982.]] Online at: [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html Kubrick on A Clockwork Orange: An interview with Michel Ciment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417145347/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html |date=17 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\nLater in the film, when the new right-wing government takes power, the atmosphere is certainly more authoritarian than the anarchist air of the beginning. Kubrick's response to Ciment's question remained ambiguous as to exactly what kind of society it is. Kubrick asserted that the film held comparisons between both the left and right end of the political spectrum and that there is little difference between the two. Kubrick stated, \"The Minister, played by Anthony Sharp, is clearly a figure of the Right. The writer, Patrick Magee, is a lunatic of the Left... They differ only in their dogma. Their means and ends are hardly distinguishable.\"<ref name=\"Ciment1982Clockwork \"/>\n\n===Locations===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}\n[[File:Thamesmead Housing Estate 01.jpg|thumb|Thamesmead South Housing Estate where Alex knocks his rebellious droogs into the lake in a sudden surprise attack]]\n''A Clockwork Orange'' was photographed mostly [[Filming location|on location]] in metropolitan London and within quick access of Kubrick's then home in Barnet Lane, [[Elstree]].\n\nShooting began on 7 September 1970 with call sheet no. 1 at the Duke Of New York pub: an unused scene and the first of many unused locations. A few days later, shooting commenced in Alex's Ludovico treatment bedroom and the [[CRM 114 (fictional device)|Serum 114]] injection by Dr Branom.\n\nNew Year's Eve started with rehearsals at the Korova Milk Bar and shooting finished after four continuous days on 8 January.\n\nThe last scenes were shot in February 1971, ending with call sheet no. 113. The last main scene to be filmed was Alex's fight with Billy Boy's gang, which took six days to cover. Shooting encompassed a total of around 113 days over six months of fairly continuous shooting. As is normal practice, there was no attempt to shoot the script in chronological order.\n\nThe few scenes not shot on location were the Korova Milk Bar, the prison check-in area, Alex having a bath at F. Alexander's house, and two corresponding scenes in the hallway. These sets were built at an old factory on Bullhead Road, [[Borehamwood]], which also served as the production office. Seven call sheets are missing from the Stanley Kubrick Archive, so some locations, such as the hallway, cannot be confirmed.\n\nOtherwise, locations used in the film include:\n* The attack on the tramp was filmed at the (since renovated) pedestrian underpass under York Road Roundabout at the southern end of [[Wandsworth Bridge]], [[Wandsworth|Wandsworth, London]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.sprachcaffe.com/english/magazine-article/in-the-presence-of-stars-famous-filming-locations-near-sprachcaffe-schools-2017-03-31.htm |title=In the presence of stars: Famous filming locations near Sprachcaffe schools |last=Zicari |first=Greta |last2=MacPherson |first2=Tom |date=31 March 2017 |website=|access-date=15 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615111056/https://www.sprachcaffe.com/english/magazine-article/in-the-presence-of-stars-famous-filming-locations-near-sprachcaffe-schools-2017-03-31.htm|archive-date=15 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* The unused scene of the attack on the professor was shot in [[Friars Square]] shopping centre in [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire, (then open, since covered) but dropped due to the actor dying.

Driving under the lorry trailer was shot by [[Colney Heath]] on Bullens Green Lane at the crossroads of Fellowes Lane, Hertfordshire. \n* The home of the writer, site of the rape and beating, was filmed at three different locations: the arrival in the \"Durango 95\" by the \"HOME\" sign was shot on the lane leading to Munden House, which is off School Lane, [[Bricket Wood]]; the house's exterior and garden with the footbridge over the pond is Milton Grundy's Japanese garden in [[Shipton-under-Wychwood]], Oxfordshire; and the interior is Skybreak House in The Warren, [[Radlett]], [[Hertfordshire]].\n* Alex throws Dim and Georgie into Southmere Lake, which is adjacent to Binsey Walk at [[Thamesmead|Thamesmead South Housing Estate]], London. This is 200 yards north of Tavy Bridge precinct, where Alex walks home at night through an elevated plaza whistling and kicking rubbish. \n* The \"Duke Of New York\" pub is the since-demolished \"The Bottle and Dragon\" pub (formerly \"The Old Leather Bottle\") in [[Stonegrove estate|Stonegrove]], Edgware, London.\n* The Cat Lady house where Alex is caught by police is [[Manor Lodge School|Shenley Lodge]], Rectory Lane, Shenley, Hertfordshire.\n* The prison's exterior is [[HMP Wandsworth]], its interior is the [[Royal Artillery Barracks|Woolwich Barracks]]' since-demolished prison wing, Woolwich, London.\n* The chapel in which Alex scrolls the lyrics as the prisoners sing is a since-demolished lecture room at St. Edward's College, Totteridge Lane, North London. The library where he reads, fantasizes and then discusses the Ludovico Treatment with the priest was underneath the lecture room. The prison governor's office, where Alex signs consent for the Ludovico treatment, is on the same site (still standing).\n* The two biblical fantasy scenes (Christ and the fight scene) were filmed at Dashwood Mausoleum, [[West Wycombe]], Buckinghamshire.\n* The check-in at Ludovico Medical Clinic, the brain-washing film theatre, Alex's apartment block lobby with the broken elevator, Alex's hospital bedroom and police interrogation/beating room (since demolished) are all at [[Brunel University London|Brunel University]], Uxbridge, Middlesex.\n* The Minister's presentation to the media of Alex's \"cure\" takes place at the Nettlefold Hall inside West Norwood Library, [[West Norwood]], London.\n* Alex is attacked by vagrants underneath the north side of the [[Albert Bridge, London|Albert Bridge]], Chelsea, London.\n* The scene where Dim and Georgie take Alex down the country lane in the police [[Land Rover]] and subsequent water trough beating is School Lane, Bricket Wood, Hertfordshire.\n* Alex's suicide bid leap and corresponding billiard room were at the old Edgwarebury Country Club, Barnet Lane, [[Elstree]], Hertfordshire.\n* The hospital in which Alex recovers is [[Princess Alexandra Hospital, Harlow|Princess Alexandra Hospital]], in [[Harlow]], Essex.\n* The final sexual fantasy was shot at the since-demolished [[Handley Page]] Ltd's hangars, [[Radlett]], Hertfordshire.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|A Clockwork Orange (soundtrack)}}\n\nDespite Alex's obsession with Beethoven, the soundtrack contains more music by [[Rossini]] than by Beethoven. The fast-motion sex scene with the two girls, the slow-motion fight between Alex and his Droogs, the fight with Billy Boy's gang, the drive to the writer's home (\"playing 'hogs of the road'\"), the invasion of the Cat Lady's home, and the scene where Alex looks into the river and contemplates suicide before being approached by the beggar are all accompanied by Rossini's music.<ref>''Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange''\n edited by Stuart Y.

While the film ends with Alex being offered an open-ended government job, implying he remains a sociopath at heart, the novel ends with Alex's positive change in character. This plot discrepancy occurred because Kubrick based his screenplay on the novel's American edition, in which the final chapter had been deleted on the insistence of its American publisher.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html#slot21 |title=The Kubrick FAQ Part 2 |website=Visual-memory.co.uk| access-date=1 May 2006| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818015944/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html#slot21| archive-date=18 August 2008| url-status=live}}</ref> He claimed not to have read the complete, original version of the novel until he had almost finished writing the screenplay, and that he never considered using it. The introduction to the 1996 edition of ''A Clockwork Orange'' says that Kubrick found the end of the original edition too blandly optimistic and unrealistic.\n* In the novel, Alex's last name was never revealed, while in the film, his surname is 'DeLarge', due to Alex's calling himself \"Alexander the Large\" in the novel.\n* At the beginning of the novel, Alex is a 15-year-old juvenile delinquent. In the film, to lessen the controversy, Alex is portrayed as somewhat older, around 17 or 18.\n* Critic Randy Rasmussen has argued that the government in the film is in a shambolic state of desperation, whereas the government in the novel is quite strong and self-confident. The former reflects Kubrick's preoccupation with the theme of acts of self-interest masked as simply following procedure.<ref>Kubrick: Seven Films Analyzed by Randy Rasmussen, p. 112</ref><br />One example of this would be differences in the portrayal of P. R. Deltoid, Alex's \"post-corrective advisor\". In the novel, P. R. Deltoid appears to have some [[moral authority]] (although not enough to prevent Alex from lying to him or engaging in crime, despite his protests). In the film, Deltoid is slightly sadistic and seems to have a sexual interest in Alex, interviewing him in his parents' bedroom and smacking him in the crotch.\n* In the film, Alex has a pet snake. There is no mention of this in the novel.<ref>Stanley Kubrick by John Baxter, p. 255</ref>\n* In the novel, F. Alexander recognises Alex through a number of careless references to the previous attack (e.g., his wife then claiming they did not have a telephone). In the film, Alex is recognised when singing the song 'Singing in the Rain' in the bath, which he had hauntingly done while attacking F. Alexander's wife. The song does not appear at all in the book, as it was an improvisation by actor Malcolm McDowell when Kubrick complained that the rape scene was too \"stiff\".<ref>Stanley Kubrick by Vincent LoBrutto pp. 365\u20136 and Stanley Kubrick, director by Alexander Walker, Sybil Taylor, Ulrich Ruchti, p. 204</ref>\n* In the novel, Alex is offered up for treatment after killing a fellow inmate who was sexually harassing him. In the film, this scene was cut out and, instead of Alex practically volunteering for the procedure, he was simply selected by the Interior Minister for speaking up during a ministerial inspection of the prison.\n* Alex's prison number in the novel is 6655321. His prison number in the film is 655321.\n* In the novel, Alex drugs and rapes two 10-year-old girls. In the film, the girls are young adults who seem to have consensual, playful sex with him, with no suggestion of using any drugs and without any violence.\n* In the novel, the writer was working on a manuscript called ''A Clockwork Orange'' when Alex and his gang are breaking into his house. In the movie, the title of the manuscript is not visible, leaving no literal reference to the title of the movie. Some explanations of the title are offered in the [[A Clockwork Orange (novel)#Title|Analysis]] section of the novel.\n* Early in both the novel and the film, Alex and his droogs brutally attack a drunk, homeless man. Later, when Alex is returned to society, he is recognised by the same man. The homeless man gathers several other homeless men to beat Alex, who is unable to defend himself. These later scenes do not appear in the book. After Alex is returned to society, he decides he wants to kill himself and goes to a library to find a book on how to do it. There, he is recognised by the man he had beaten and is attacked by him and a gang of other old library patrons.\n* Alex is beaten nearly to death by the police after his rehabilitation. In the film, the policemen are two of his former droogs, Dim and Georgie. In the book, instead of Georgie, who was said to have been killed, the second officer is Billyboy, the leader of the opposing gang whom Alex and his droogs fought earlier, both in the film and the book.\n* The film concludes with Alex recovering from his suicide attempt in hospital. In the novel, Alex leaves the hospital and forms a new band of droogs, but is unsatisfied by the violent activities which once entertained him. He encounters Peter (one of his former droogs) in a caf\u00e9, and is fascinated by the seemingly nonviolent life he now leads. The story closes with Alex suggesting that he might try to pursue a similar, peaceful lifestyle.\n* In the novel, Alex is accidentally conditioned against all music, but in the film he is only conditioned against [[Beethoven's 9th Symphony]].\n\n==Home media==\nIn 2000, the film was released on VHS and [[DVD]], both individually and as part of ''The Stanley Kubrick Collection'' DVD set. Due to negative comments from fans, Warner Bros re-released the film, its image digitally restored and its soundtrack remastered. A limited-edition collector's set with a soundtrack disc, film poster, booklet and film strip followed, but later was discontinued. In 2005, a British re-release, packaged as an \"Iconic Film\" in a limited-edition slipcase was published, identical to the remastered DVD set, except for different package cover art. In 2006, Warner Bros announced the September publication of a two-disc special edition featuring a Malcolm McDowell commentary, and the releases of other two-disc sets of Stanley Kubrick films. Several British retailers had set the release date as 6 November 2006; the release was delayed and re-announced for 2007 Holiday Season.\n\nAn [[HD DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]], and DVD re-release version of the film was released on 23 October 2007. The release accompanies four other Kubrick classics. 1080p video transfers and remixed Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (for HD DVD) and uncompressed 5.1 PCM (for Blu-ray) audio tracks are on both the Blu-ray and HD DVD editions. Unlike the previous version, the DVD re-release edition is anamorphically enhanced.

Please do not add sub-genres without discussion there.--> adapted, produced, and directed by [[Stanley Kubrick]], based on [[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. It employs disturbing, violent images to comment on [[psychiatry]], [[juvenile delinquency]], youth gangs, and other social, political, and economic subjects in a dystopian near-future Britain.\n\n[[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]] ([[Malcolm McDowell]]), the central character, is a charismatic, antisocial delinquent <!-- See section below #Differences_between_the_film_and_the_novel for discussion about last name -->whose interests include [[classical music]] (especially [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]), committing rape, theft and what is termed \"ultra-violence\". He leads a small gang of thugs, Pete ([[Michael Tarn]]), Georgie ([[James Marcus (English actor)|James Marcus]]), and Dim ([[Warren Clarke]]), whom he calls his ''droogs'' (from the [[Russian language|Russian]] word \u0434\u0440\u0443\u0433, \"friend\", \"buddy\"). The film chronicles the horrific crime spree of his gang, his capture, and attempted rehabilitation via an experimental psychological conditioning technique (the \"Ludovico Technique\") promoted by the Minister of the Interior ([[Anthony Sharp]]). Alex narrates most of the film in [[Nadsat]], a fractured adolescent slang composed of [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] (especially Russian), English, and [[Cockney rhyming slang]].\n\n[[A Clockwork Orange (soundtrack)|The soundtrack to ''A Clockwork Orange'']] features mostly classical music selections and [[Moog synthesizer]] compositions by [[Wendy Carlos]]. The artwork for the poster of ''A Clockwork Orange'' was created by [[Philip Castle]] with the layout by designer [[Bill Gold]].\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per Film project guidelines, please keep this plot section between 400 and 700 words long. -->\nIn a futuristic Britain, Alex DeLarge is the leader of a gang of \"droogs\": Georgie, Dim and Pete. One night, after getting intoxicated on drug-laden \"milk-plus\", they engage in an evening of \"ultra-violence\", which includes a fight with a rival gang. They drive to the country home of writer F. Alexander and beat him to the point of crippling him for life. Alex then rapes Alexander's wife while singing [[Singin' in the Rain (song)|\"Singin' in the Rain\"]]. The next day, while truant from school, Alex is approached by his probation officer P. R. Deltoid, who is aware of Alex's activities and cautions him.\n\nAlex's droogs express discontent with petty crime and want more equality and high-yield thefts, but Alex asserts his authority by attacking them. Later, Alex invades the home of a wealthy \"cat-lady\" and bludgeons her with a phallic sculpture while his droogs remain outside. On hearing sirens, Alex tries to flee but Dim smashes a bottle in his face, stunning him and leaving him to be arrested. With Alex in custody, Deltoid gloats that the cat-lady died, making Alex a murderer. He is sentenced to fourteen years in prison.\n\nTwo years into the sentence, Alex eagerly takes up an offer to be a test subject for the Minister of the Interior's new Ludovico technique, an experimental [[aversion therapy]] for rehabilitating criminals within two weeks. Alex is strapped to a chair, his eyes are clamped open and he is injected with drugs. He is then forced to watch films of sex and violence, some of which are accompanied by the music of his favourite composer, Ludwig van Beethoven. Alex becomes nauseated by the films and, fearing the technique will make him sick upon hearing Beethoven, begs for an end to the treatment.\n\nTwo weeks later, the Minister demonstrates Alex's rehabilitation to a gathering of officials. Alex is unable to fight back against an actor who taunts and attacks him and becomes ill wanting sex with a topless woman. The prison chaplain complains that Alex has been robbed of his free will; the Minister asserts that the Ludovico technique will cut crime and alleviate crowding in prisons.\n\nAlex is let out as a free man, only to find that the police have sold his possessions as compensation to his victims and his parents have let out his room. Alex encounters an elderly vagrant whom he attacked years earlier, and the vagrant and his friends attack him. Alex is saved by two policemen but is shocked to find they are his former droogs Dim and Georgie. They drive him to the countryside, beat him up, and nearly drown him before abandoning him. Alex barely makes it to the doorstep of a nearby home before collapsing.\n\nAlex wakes up to find himself in the home of Alexander, where he is being cared for by Alexander's manservant, Julian. Alexander does not recognise Alex from the previous attack but knows of Alex and the Ludovico technique from the newspapers. He sees Alex as a political weapon and prepares to present him to his colleagues. While bathing, Alex breaks into \"Singin' in the Rain\", causing Alexander to realise that Alex was the person who assaulted him and his wife. With help from his colleagues, Alexander drugs Alex and locks him in an upstairs bedroom. He then plays Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] loudly from the floor below. Unable to withstand the sickening pain, Alex attempts suicide by throwing himself out the window.\n\nAlex wakes up in a hospital with broken bones. While being given a series of psychological tests, he finds that he no longer has aversions to violence and sex. The Minister arrives and apologises to Alex. He offers to take care of Alex and get him a job in return for his co-operation with his election campaign and public relations counter-offensive. As a sign of good will, the Minister brings in a stereo system playing Beethoven's Ninth. Alex then contemplates violence and has vivid thoughts of having sex with a woman in front of an approving crowd, and thinks to himself, \"I was cured, all right!\"\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Malcolm McDowell Clockwork Orange.png|thumb|Malcolm McDowell as Alex DeLarge.]]\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Malcolm McDowell]] as [[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex DeLarge]]\n* [[Patrick Magee (actor)|Patrick Magee]] as Mr Frank Alexander\n* [[Michael Bates (actor)|Michael Bates]] as Chief Guard Barnes\n* [[Warren Clarke]] as Dim\n* [[John Clive]] as Stage Actor\n* [[Adrienne Corri]] as Mrs Mary Alexander\n* [[Carl Duering]] as Dr Brodsky\n* [[Paul Farrell]] as Tramp\n* [[Clive Francis]] as Joe the Lodger\n* [[Michael Gover]] as Prison Governor\n* [[Miriam Karlin]] as Catlady\n* [[James Marcus (English actor)|James Marcus]] as Georgie\n* [[Aubrey Morris]] as P.

It is, at the same time, a running lecture on free-will.}}\nAfter aversion therapy, Alex behaves like a good member of society, though not through choice. His goodness is involuntary; he has become the titular clockwork orange\u2014organic on the outside, mechanical on the inside. After Alex has undergone the Ludovico technique, the chaplain criticises his new attitude as false, arguing that true goodness ''must'' come from within. This leads to the theme of abusing liberties\u2014personal, governmental, civil\u2014by Alex, with two conflicting political forces, the Government and the Dissidents, both manipulating Alex purely for their own political ends.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Books of The Times |date=19 March 1963 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/30/home/burgess-orange.html|access-date=4 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202042027/http://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/30/home/burgess-orange.html|archive-date=2 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The story portrays the \"conservative\" and \"liberal\" parties as equally worthy of criticism: the writer Frank Alexander, a victim of Alex and his gang, wants revenge against Alex ''and'' sees him as a means of definitively turning the populace against the incumbent government and its new regime. Mr Alexander fears the new government; in a telephone conversation, he says:\n{{Cquote|Recruiting brutal young roughs into the police; proposing debilitating and will-sapping techniques of conditioning. Oh, we've seen it all before in other countries; the thin end of the wedge! Before we know where we are, we shall have the full apparatus of [[totalitarianism]].}}\n\nOn the other side, the Minister of the Interior (the Government) jails Mr Alexander (the Dissident Intellectual) on the excuse of his endangering Alex (the People), rather than the government's totalitarian regime (described by Mr Alexander). It is unclear whether or not he has been harmed; however, the Minister tells Alex that the writer has been denied the ability to write and produce \"subversive\" material that is critical of the incumbent government and meant to provoke political unrest.\n\n===Psychology===\n[[File:LudovicoMalcolmMcDowellAClockworkOrangetrailer.png|thumb|Ludovico technique apparatus]]\nAnother target of criticism is the [[behaviourism]] or \"behavioural psychology\" propounded by psychologists [[John B. Watson]] and [[B. F. Skinner]]. Burgess disapproved of behaviourism, calling Skinner's book ''[[Beyond Freedom and Dignity]]'' (1971) \"one of the most dangerous books ever written\". Although behaviourism's limitations were conceded by its principal founder, Watson, Skinner argued that [[behaviour modification]]\u2014specifically, [[operant conditioning]] (learned behaviours via systematic reward-and-punishment techniques) rather than the [[Classical conditioning|\"classical\" Watsonian conditioning]]\u2014is the key to an ideal society. The film's Ludovico technique is widely perceived as a parody of [[aversion therapy]], which is a form of classical conditioning.<ref>{{cite web |author=Theodore Dalrymple |title=A Prophetic and Violent Masterpiece |url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_1_oh_to_be.html |work=City Journal |date=1 January 2006 |accessdate=13 March 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201170544/http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_1_oh_to_be.html | archive-date=1 February 2011 | url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAuthor Paul Duncan said of Alex: \"Alex is the narrator so we see everything from his point of view, including his mental images. The implication is that all of the images, both real and imagined, are part of Alex's fantasies\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=142}} Psychiatrist Aaron Stern, the former head of the MPAA rating board, believed that Alex represents man in his natural state, the unconscious mind. Alex becomes \"civilised\" after receiving his Ludovico \"cure\" and the sickness in the aftermath Stern considered to be the \"neurosis imposed by society\".{{sfn|Duncan|2003|p=128}} Kubrick told film critics Philip Strick and [[Penelope Houston (film critic)|Penelope Houston]] that he believed Alex \"makes no attempt to deceive himself or the audience as to his total corruption or wickedness. He is the very personification of evil.

Sound: 225,880 feet printed from 288 1/4\" reel to reel tapes.\n\n===Adaptation===\nThe cinematic adaptation of ''A Clockwork Orange'' (1962) was not initially planned. [[Screenwriter|Screenplay writer]] [[Terry Southern]] gave Kubrick a copy of the novel, but, as he was developing a [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]-related project, Kubrick put it aside. Kubrick's wife, in an interview, stated she then gave him the novel after having read it. It had an immediate impact. Of his enthusiasm for it, Kubrick said, \"I was excited by everything about it: the plot, the ideas, the characters, and, of course, the language. The story functions, of course, on several levels: political, sociological, philosophical, and, what's most important, on a dreamlike psychological-symbolic level.\" Kubrick wrote a screenplay faithful to the novel, saying, \"I think whatever Burgess had to say about the story was said in the book, but I did invent a few useful narrative ideas and reshape some of the scenes.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0012.html |title=The Kubrick Site: The ACO Controversy in the UK |website=Visual-memory.co.uk |date= |accessdate=13 March 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6BTHAmrtn?url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/0012.html |archive-date=17 October 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Kubrick based the script on the shortened US edition of the book, which omitted the final chapter.\n\n====Novelist's response====\nBurgess had mixed feelings about the film adaptation of his novel, publicly saying he loved [[Malcolm McDowell]] and [[Michael Bates (actor)|Michael Bates]], and the use of music; he praised it as \"brilliant\", even so brilliant that it might be dangerous. Despite this enthusiasm, he was concerned that it lacked the novel's [[A Clockwork Orange (novel)#Omission of the final chapter|redemptive final chapter]], an absence he blamed upon his American publisher and not Kubrick. All US editions of the novel prior to 1986 omitted the final chapter.\n\nBurgess reports in his autobiography ''You've Had Your Time''&nbsp;(1990) that he and Kubrick at first enjoyed a good relationship, each holding similar philosophical and political views and each very interested in literature, cinema, music, and Napoleon Bonaparte. Burgess's novel ''[[Napoleon Symphony]]'' (1974) was dedicated to Kubrick. Their relationship soured when Kubrick left Burgess to defend the film from accusations of glorifying violence. A [[lapsed Catholic]], Burgess tried many times to explain the Christian moral points of the story to outraged Christian organisations and to defend it against newspaper accusations that it supported fascist dogma. He also went to receive awards given to Kubrick on his behalf. Despite the benefits Burgess made from the film, he was in no way involved in the production of the book's adaptation. The only profit he made directly from the film was the initial $500 that was given to him for the rights to the adaptation.\n\n===Direction===\nKubrick was a perfectionist who researched meticulously, with thousands of photographs taken of potential locations, as well as many scene takes; however, per Malcolm McDowell, he usually \"got it right\" early on, so there were few takes. So meticulous was Kubrick that McDowell stated \"If Kubrick hadn't been a film director he'd have been a General Chief of Staff of the US Forces. No matter what it is\u2014even if it's a question of buying a shampoo it goes through him. He just likes total control.\"{{sfn|Baxter|1997|pp=6-7}} Filming took place between September 1970 and April 1971, making ''A Clockwork Orange'' the quickest film shoot in his career.

The teenage slang has a heavily Russian influence, as in the novel; Burgess explains the slang as being, in part, intended to draw a reader into the world of the book's characters and to prevent the book from becoming outdated. There is some evidence to suggest that the society is a socialist one, or perhaps a society evolving from a failed socialism into a fully authoritarian society. In the novel, streets have paintings of working men in the style of Russian socialist art, and in the film, there is a mural of socialist artwork with obscenities drawn on it. As Malcolm McDowell points out on the DVD commentary, Alex's residence was shot on failed municipal architecture, and the name \"Municipal Flat Block 18A, Linear North\" alludes to socialist-style housing.<ref name=\"Ciment1982Clockwork \">[[#Ciment1982Clockwork|Ciment 1982.]] Online at: [http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html Kubrick on A Clockwork Orange: An interview with Michel Ciment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417145347/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/amk/doc/interview.aco.html |date=17 April 2019 }}</ref>\n\nLater in the film, when the new right-wing government takes power, the atmosphere is certainly more authoritarian than the anarchist air of the beginning. Kubrick's response to Ciment's question remained ambiguous as to exactly what kind of society it is. Kubrick asserted that the film held comparisons between both the left and right end of the political spectrum and that there is little difference between the two. Kubrick stated, \"The Minister, played by Anthony Sharp, is clearly a figure of the Right. The writer, Patrick Magee, is a lunatic of the Left... They differ only in their dogma. Their means and ends are hardly distinguishable.\"<ref name=\"Ciment1982Clockwork \"/>\n\n===Locations===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=April 2018}}\n[[File:Thamesmead Housing Estate 01.jpg|thumb|Thamesmead South Housing Estate where Alex knocks his rebellious droogs into the lake in a sudden surprise attack]]\n''A Clockwork Orange'' was photographed mostly [[Filming location|on location]] in metropolitan London and within quick access of Kubrick's then home in Barnet Lane, [[Elstree]].\n\nShooting began on 7 September 1970 with call sheet no. 1 at the Duke Of New York pub: an unused scene and the first of many unused locations. A few days later, shooting commenced in Alex's Ludovico treatment bedroom and the [[CRM 114 (fictional device)|Serum 114]] injection by Dr Branom.\n\nNew Year's Eve started with rehearsals at the Korova Milk Bar and shooting finished after four continuous days on 8 January.\n\nThe last scenes were shot in February 1971, ending with call sheet no. 113. The last main scene to be filmed was Alex's fight with Billy Boy's gang, which took six days to cover. Shooting encompassed a total of around 113 days over six months of fairly continuous shooting. As is normal practice, there was no attempt to shoot the script in chronological order.\n\nThe few scenes not shot on location were the Korova Milk Bar, the prison check-in area, Alex having a bath at F. Alexander's house, and two corresponding scenes in the hallway. These sets were built at an old factory on Bullhead Road, [[Borehamwood]], which also served as the production office. Seven call sheets are missing from the Stanley Kubrick Archive, so some locations, such as the hallway, cannot be confirmed.\n\nOtherwise, locations used in the film include:\n* The attack on the tramp was filmed at the (since renovated) pedestrian underpass under York Road Roundabout at the southern end of [[Wandsworth Bridge]], [[Wandsworth|Wandsworth, London]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.sprachcaffe.com/english/magazine-article/in-the-presence-of-stars-famous-filming-locations-near-sprachcaffe-schools-2017-03-31.htm |title=In the presence of stars: Famous filming locations near Sprachcaffe schools |last=Zicari |first=Greta |last2=MacPherson |first2=Tom |date=31 March 2017 |website=|access-date=15 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615111056/https://www.sprachcaffe.com/english/magazine-article/in-the-presence-of-stars-famous-filming-locations-near-sprachcaffe-schools-2017-03-31.htm|archive-date=15 June 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* The unused scene of the attack on the professor was shot in [[Friars Square]] shopping centre in [[Aylesbury]], Buckinghamshire, (then open, since covered) but dropped due to the actor dying.

An exterior blue plaque and mosaic at ground level commemorate the film's location.[[File:The Chelsea Drugstore.jpg|thumb|The Chelsea Drugstore in west London]]\n* The record shop where Alex picks up the two young women was in the basement of the former [[Chelsea Drugstore]], located on the corner of Royal Avenue and [[King's Road]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n* The 'Menacing Car scene' where the [[Probe 16|Durango '95]] forces the VW Beetle, motorcycle and Transit van off the road, were shot on Rectory Lane just south of Shenley Lodge. Driving under the lorry trailer was shot by [[Colney Heath]] on Bullens Green Lane at the crossroads of Fellowes Lane, Hertfordshire. \n* The home of the writer, site of the rape and beating, was filmed at three different locations: the arrival in the \"Durango 95\" by the \"HOME\" sign was shot on the lane leading to Munden House, which is off School Lane, [[Bricket Wood]], the house's exterior and garden with the footbridge over the pond is Milton Grundy's Japanese garden in [[Shipton-under-Wychwood]], Oxfordshire and the interior is Skybreak House in The Warren, [[Radlett]], [[Hertfordshire]].\n* Alex throws Dim and Georgie into Southmere Lake, which is adjacent to Binsey Walk at [[Thamesmead|Thamesmead South Housing Estate]], London. This is 200 yards north of Tavy Bridge precinct, where Alex walks home at night through an elevated plaza whistling and kicking rubbish. \n* The \"Duke Of New York\" pub is the since-demolished \"The Bottle and Dragon\" pub (formerly \"The Old Leather Bottle\") in [[Stonegrove estate|Stonegrove]], Edgware, London.\n* The Cat Lady house where Alex is caught by police is [[Manor Lodge School|Shenley Lodge]], Rectory Lane, Shenley, Hertfordshire.\n* The prison's exterior is [[HMP Wandsworth]], its interior is the [[Royal Artillery Barracks|Woolwich Barracks]]' since-demolished prison wing, Woolwich, London.\n* The chapel in which Alex scrolls the lyrics as the prisoners sing is a since-demolished lecture room at St. Edward's College, Totteridge Lane, North London. The library where he reads, fantasizes and then discusses the Ludovico Treatment with the priest was underneath the lecture room. The prison governor's office, where Alex signs consent for the Ludovico treatment, is on the same site (still standing).\n* The two biblical fantasy scenes (Christ and the fight scene) were filmed at Dashwood Mausoleum, [[West Wycombe]], Buckinghamshire.\n* The check-in at Ludovico Medical Clinic, the brain-washing film theatre, Alex's apartment block lobby with the broken elevator, Alex's hospital bedroom and police interrogation/beating room (since demolished) are all at [[Brunel University London|Brunel University]], Uxbridge, Middlesex.\n* The Minister's presentation to the media of Alex's \"cure\" takes place at the Nettlefold Hall inside West Norwood Library, [[West Norwood]], London.\n* Alex is attacked by vagrants underneath the north side of the [[Albert Bridge, London|Albert Bridge]], Chelsea, London.\n* The scene where Dim and Georgie take Alex down the country lane in the police [[Land Rover]] and subsequent water trough beating is School Lane, Bricket Wood, Hertfordshire.\n* Alex's suicide bid leap and corresponding billiard room were at the old Edgwarebury Country Club, Barnet Lane, [[Elstree]], Hertfordshire.\n* The hospital in which Alex recovers is [[Princess Alexandra Hospital, Harlow|Princess Alexandra Hospital]], in [[Harlow]], Essex.\n* The final sexual fantasy was shot at the since-demolished [[Handley Page]] Ltd's hangars, [[Radlett]], Hertfordshire.\n\n===Music===\n{{main|A Clockwork Orange (soundtrack)}}\n\nDespite Alex's obsession with Beethoven, the soundtrack contains more music by [[Rossini]] than by Beethoven. The fast-motion sex scene with the two girls, the slow-motion fight between Alex and his Droogs, the fight with Billy Boy's gang, the drive to the writer's home (\"playing 'hogs of the road'\"), the invasion of the Cat Lady's home, and the scene where Alex looks into the river and contemplates suicide before being approached by the beggar are all accompanied by Rossini's music.<ref>''Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange''\n edited by Stuart Y.

While the film ends with Alex being offered an open-ended government job, implying he remains a sociopath at heart, the novel ends with Alex's positive change in character. This plot discrepancy occurred because Kubrick based his screenplay on the novel's American edition, in which the final chapter had been deleted on the insistence of its American publisher.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html#slot21 |title=The Kubrick FAQ Part 2 |website=Visual-memory.co.uk| access-date=1 May 2006| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080818015944/http://www.visual-memory.co.uk/faq/index2.html#slot21| archive-date=18 August 2008| url-status=live}}</ref> He claimed not to have read the complete, original version of the novel until he had almost finished writing the screenplay, and that he never considered using it. The introduction to the 1996 edition of ''A Clockwork Orange'' says that Kubrick found the end of the original edition too blandly optimistic and unrealistic.\n* In the novel, Alex's last name was never revealed, while in the film, his surname is 'DeLarge', due to Alex's calling himself \"Alexander the Large\" in the novel.\n* At the beginning of the novel, Alex is a 15-year-old juvenile delinquent. In the film, to lessen the controversy, Alex is portrayed as somewhat older, around 17 or 18.\n* Critic Randy Rasmussen has argued that the government in the film is in a shambolic state of desperation, whereas the government in the novel is quite strong and self-confident. The former reflects Kubrick's preoccupation with the theme of acts of self-interest masked as simply following procedure.<ref>Kubrick: Seven Films Analyzed by Randy Rasmussen, p. 112</ref><br />One example of this would be differences in the portrayal of P. R. Deltoid, Alex's \"post-corrective advisor\". In the novel, P. R. Deltoid appears to have some [[moral authority]] (although not enough to prevent Alex from lying to him or engaging in crime, despite his protests). In the film, Deltoid is slightly sadistic and seems to have a sexual interest in Alex, interviewing him in his parents' bedroom and smacking him in the crotch.\n* In the film, Alex has a pet snake. There is no mention of this in the novel.<ref>Stanley Kubrick by John Baxter, p. 255</ref>\n* In the novel, F. Alexander recognises Alex through a number of careless references to the previous attack (e.g., his wife then claiming they did not have a telephone). In the film, Alex is recognised when singing the song 'Singing in the Rain' in the bath, which he had hauntingly done while attacking F. Alexander's wife. The song does not appear at all in the book, as it was an improvisation by actor Malcolm McDowell when Kubrick complained that the rape scene was too \"stiff\".<ref>Stanley Kubrick by Vincent LoBrutto pp. 365\u20136 and Stanley Kubrick, director by Alexander Walker, Sybil Taylor, Ulrich Ruchti, p. 204</ref>\n* In the novel, Alex is offered up for treatment after killing a fellow inmate who was sexually harassing him. In the film, this scene was cut out and, instead of Alex practically volunteering for the procedure, he was simply selected by the Interior Minister for speaking up during a ministerial inspection of the prison.\n* Alex's prison number in the novel is 6655321. His prison number in the film is 655321.\n* In the novel, Alex drugs and rapes two 10-year-old girls. In the film, the girls are young adults who seem to have consensual, playful sex with him, with no suggestion of using any drugs and without any violence.\n* In the novel, the writer was working on a manuscript called ''A Clockwork Orange'' when Alex and his gang are breaking into his house. In the movie, the title of the manuscript is not visible, leaving no literal reference to the title of the movie. Some explanations of the title are offered in the [[A Clockwork Orange (novel)#Title|Analysis]] section of the novel.\n* Early in both the novel and the film, Alex and his droogs brutally attack a drunk, homeless man. Later, when Alex is returned to society, he is recognised by the same man. The homeless man gathers several other homeless men to beat Alex, who is unable to defend himself. These later scenes do not appear in the book. After Alex is returned to society, he decides he wants to kill himself and goes to a library to find a book on how to do it. There, he is recognised by the man he had beaten and is attacked by him and a gang of other old library patrons.\n* Alex is beaten nearly to death by the police after his rehabilitation. In the film, the policemen are two of his former droogs, Dim and Georgie. In the book, instead of Georgie, who was said to have been killed, the second officer is Billyboy, the leader of the opposing gang whom Alex and his droogs fought earlier, both in the film and the book.\n* The film concludes with Alex recovering from his suicide attempt in hospital. In the novel, Alex leaves the hospital and forms a new band of droogs, but is unsatisfied by the violent activities which once entertained him. He encounters Peter (one of his former droogs) in a caf\u00e9, and is fascinated by the seemingly nonviolent life he now leads. The story closes with Alex suggesting that he might try to pursue a similar, peaceful lifestyle.\n* In the novel, Alex is accidentally conditioned against all music, but in the film he is only conditioned against [[Beethoven's 9th Symphony]].\n\n==Home media==\nIn 2000, the film was released on VHS and [[DVD]], both individually and as part of ''The Stanley Kubrick Collection'' DVD set. Due to negative comments from fans, Warner Bros re-released the film, its image digitally restored and its soundtrack remastered. A limited-edition collector's set with a soundtrack disc, film poster, booklet and film strip followed, but later was discontinued. In 2005, a British re-release, packaged as an \"Iconic Film\" in a limited-edition slipcase was published, identical to the remastered DVD set, except for different package cover art. In 2006, Warner Bros announced the September publication of a two-disc special edition featuring a Malcolm McDowell commentary, and the releases of other two-disc sets of Stanley Kubrick films. Several British retailers had set the release date as 6 November 2006; the release was delayed and re-announced for 2007 Holiday Season.\n\nAn [[HD DVD]], [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]], and DVD re-release version of the film was released on 23 October 2007. The release accompanies four other Kubrick classics. 1080p video transfers and remixed Dolby TrueHD 5.1 (for HD DVD) and uncompressed 5.1 PCM (for Blu-ray) audio tracks are on both the Blu-ray and HD DVD editions. Unlike the previous version, the DVD re-release edition is anamorphically enhanced. The Blu-ray was reissued for the 40th anniversary of the film's release, identical to the previously released Blu-ray, apart from adding a Digibook and the ''[[Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures]]'' documentary as a bonus feature.\n\n==Legacy==\nAlong with ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967), ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968), ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969), ''[[Soldier Blue]]'' (1970), ''[[Dirty Harry]]'' (1971), and ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'' (1971), the film is considered a landmark in the relaxation of control on violence in the cinema.<ref>Ian MacDonald, ''Revolution in the Head'', Pimlico, p.235</ref>\n\n''A Clockwork Orange'' remains an influential work in cinema and other media.

It is part of the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area|Baltimore\u2013Washington Metropolitan Area]]. Frederick has long been an important crossroads, located at the intersection of a major north\u2013south Indian trail and east\u2013west routes to the [[Chesapeake Bay]], both at [[Baltimore]] and what became [[Washington, D.C.]] and across the [[Appalachian mountains]] to the [[Ohio River]] watershed. It is a part of the [[Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which is part of a greater [[Washington-Baltimore-Arlington, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA Combined Statistical Area]]. The city's population was 65,239 people at the [[2010 United States Census]], making it the second-largest incorporated city in Maryland, behind [[Baltimore]]. Frederick is home to [[Frederick Municipal Airport (Maryland)|Frederick Municipal Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association airport code|IATA]]: FDK), which accommodates [[general aviation]], and to the county's largest employer [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]'s [[Fort Detrick]] bioscience/communications research installation.<ref>{{cite book | url=http://www.cityoffrederick.com/DocumentView.aspx?DID=939| title=Comprehensive Annual Financial Report|author=Department of Finance|publisher=City of Frederick, Maryland|page=87|accessdate=September 24, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Catoctin Mountain view near Frederick, MD IMG 4656.JPG|200px|right|thumb|A view of [[Catoctin Mountain]] from the south of Frederick]]\n\n===Prehistory===\nLocated where [[Catoctin Mountain]] (the easternmost ridge of the [[Blue Ridge mountains]]) meets the rolling hills of the Piedmont region, the Frederick area became a crossroads even before European explorers and traders arrived. Native American hunters possibly including the [[Susquehannock]]s, the Algonquian-speaking [[Shawnee]], or the [[Seneca people|Seneca]] or [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] or other members of the [[Iroquois Confederation]]) followed the [[Monocacy River]] from the [[Susquehanna River]] watershed in Pennsylvania to the [[Potomac River]] watershed and the lands of the more agrarian and maritime [[Algonquian peoples]], particularly the [[Lenape]] of the Delaware valley or the [[Piscataway tribe|Piscataway]] and [[Powhatan]] of the lower Potomac watershed and Chesapeake Bay. This became known as the Monocacy Trail or even the [[Great Indian Warpath]], with some travelers continuing southward through the \"[[Great Appalachian Valley]]\" ([[Shenandoah Valley]], etc.) to the western [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] in [[North Carolina]], or traveling down other watersheds in Virginia toward the [[Chesapeake Bay]], such as those of the [[Rappahannock River|Rappahannock]], [[James River|James]] and [[York River (Virginia)|York River]]s.\n\n===Colonial era===\nThe earliest European settlement was slightly north of Frederick in [[Monocacy, Maryland]]. Founded before 1730, when the Indian trail became a wagon road, Monocacy was abandoned before the [[American Revolutionary War]], perhaps due to the river's periodic flooding or hostilities predating the [[French and Indian War]], or simply Frederick's better location with easier access to the Potomac River near its confluence with the Monocacy.\n\n[[Daniel Dulany the Elder|Daniel Dulany]]\u2014a land speculator\u2014laid out \"Frederick Town\" by 1745.<ref>See for example the ''Overall history of Frederick'', pp. 2\u20136</ref><ref>NRIS F-03-039 at section 8 p.2 available at http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/stagsere/se1/se5/010000/010400/010482/pdf/msa_se5_10482.pdf</ref> Three years earlier, [[All Saints Church (Frederick, Maryland)|All Saints Church]] had been founded on a hilltop near a warehouse/trading post.<ref>Herb Wolf III, Houses of Worship in Frederick, Maryland: a 250 Year History 1745-1995 (Baltimore: Gateway Press, Inc., 1995) p. 3</ref> Sources disagree as to which Frederick the town was named for, but the likeliest candidates are [[Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore]] (one of the proprietors of Maryland<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/ftfrederickhistory.html|title=Fort Frederick State Park History|publisher=[[Maryland Department of Natural Resources]]|accessdate=October 7, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005164303/http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/ftfrederickhistory.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=October 5, 2007}}</ref>), [[Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mdmunicipal.org/cities/index.cfm?townname=Frederick&page=home|title=Frederick, Maryland|publisher=Maryland Municipal League|accessdate=October 9, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021105716/http://mdmunicipal.org/cities/index.cfm?townname=Frederick&page=home|archivedate=October 21, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick \"The Great\" of Prussia]].\n[[File:Evangelical Lutheran on East Church Street - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Evangelical Lutheran Church (Frederick, Maryland)]] (1752)]]\nIn 1748, Frederick County was formed by carving a section off of Prince George's County. Frederick Town (now Frederick) was made the county seat of [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]].<ref>Louis B. O'Donoghue, Gazetter of Old, Odd & Obscure Place Names of Frederick County, Maryland (Historical Society of Frederick County, Inc., 2008) p. 85</ref> The county originally extended to the Appalachian mountains (areas further west being disputed between the colonies of Virginia and Pennsylvania until 1789). The current town's first house was built by a young [[Calvinist|German Reformed]] schoolmaster from the [[Palatinate (region)|Rhineland Palatinate]] named [[Johann Thomas Schley]] (died 1790), who led a party of immigrants (including his wife, Maria Von Winz) to the Maryland colony. The Palatinate settlers bought land from Dulany on the banks of [[Carroll Creek (Maryland)|Carroll Creek]], and Schley's house stood at the northwest corner of Middle Alley and East Patrick Street into the 20th century. Schley's settlers also founded a German [[Reformed Church]] (today known as Evangelical Reformed Church, and part of the [[United Church of Christ|UCC]]). Probably the oldest house still standing in Frederick today is [[Schifferstadt (Frederick, Maryland)|Schifferstadt]], built in 1756 by German settler Joseph Brunner and now the Schifferstadt Architectural Museum.\n\nSchley's group was among the many [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] (ethnic Germans) (as well as Scots-Irish and French and later Irish) who migrated south and westward in the late-18th century. Frederick was an important stop along the migration route that became known as the [[Great Wagon Road]], which came down from [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]] and [[Emmitsburg, Maryland]] and continued south following the [[Great Appalachian Valley]] through [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]] and [[Roanoke, Virginia]]. Another important route continued along the Potomac River from near Frederick, to [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]], where it split. One branch crossed the Potomac River near [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]] and continued down into the Shenandoah valley. The other continued west to [[Cumberland, Maryland]] and ultimately crossed the [[Appalachian Mountains]] into the watershed of the [[Ohio River]]. Thus, British [[Edward Braddock|General Edward Braddock]] marched his troops (including the youthful [[George Washington]]) west in 1755 through Frederick on the way to their fateful ambush near [[Fort Duquesne]] (later [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]], then [[Pittsburgh]]) during the [[French and Indian War]]. However, the British after the [[Proclamation of 1763]] restricted that westward migration route until after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Other westward migrants continued south from Frederick to Roanoke along the Great Wagon Road, crossing the Appalachians into [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]] at the [[Cumberland Gap]] near the Virginia/North Carolina border.\n\nOther German settlers in Frederick were [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|Evangelical Lutherans]], led by Rev. [[Henry Muhlenberg]]. They moved their mission church from Monocacy to what became a large complex a few blocks further down Church Street from the Anglicans and the German Reformed Church. Methodist missionary [[Robert Strawbridge]] accepted an invitation to preach at Frederick town in 1770, and [[Francis Asbury]] arrived two years later, both helping to found a congregation which became Calvary Methodist Church, worshiping in a log building from 1792 (although superseded by larger buildings in 1841, 1865, 1910 and 1930).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.calvaryumc.org/about-us/our-building |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715074906/http://www.calvaryumc.org/about-us/our-building/ |archivedate=July 15, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Frederick also had a Catholic mission, to which Rev. [[John Dubois|Jean DuBois]] was assigned in 1792, which became [[St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church (Frederick, Maryland)|St. John the Evangelist Church]] (built in 1800).\n\nTo control this crossroads during the [[American Revolution]], the British garrisoned a German [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] regiment in the town; {{as of |2011 |alt=the war (the stone, L-shaped \"[[Hessian Barracks]]\" still stand).}}\n\n===Early 19th century===\n[[File:Old All Saints Episcopal Church in Frederick.jpg|thumb|left|All Saints Church, erected 1813, Principal Parish Church until 1855]]As the county seat for Western Maryland, Frederick not only was an important market town, but also the seat of justice. Although [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] and [[Washington County, Maryland|Washington County]] were split off from Frederick County in 1776, Frederick remained the seat of the smaller (though still large) county. Important lawyers who practiced in Frederick included [[John Hanson]], [[Francis Scott Key]] and [[Roger B. Taney]].\n\n[[File:All saints and ucc spires Frederick.jpg|thumb|Church Street with All Saints and Reformed Church spires, Frederick]]Frederick was also known during the nineteenth century for its religious pluralism, with one of its main thoroughfares, Church Street, hosting about a half dozen major churches. In 1793, All Saints Church hosted the first confirmation of an American citizen, by the newly consecrated Episcopal Bishop [[Thomas Claggett]]. That original colonial building was replaced in 1814 by a brick classical revival structure. It still stands today, although the principal worship space has become an even larger brick gothic church joining it at the back and facing Frederick's City Hall (so the parish remains the oldest Episcopal Church in western Maryland).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allsaintsmd.org/history.php|title=All Saints' Episcopal Church|publisher=}}</ref> The main Catholic church, dedicated to St. John the Evangelist, was built in 1800, then rebuilt in 1837 (across the street) one block north of Church Street on East Second Street, where it still stands along with a school and convent established by the [[Visitation Sisters]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohn-frederick.org/aboutus.asp|title=St. John the Evangelist, Roman Catholic Church \u2013 Frederick, Maryland|accessdate=December 16, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212013640/http://www.stjohn-frederick.org/aboutus.asp|archivedate=December 12, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The stone Evangelical Lutheran Church of 1752 was also rebuilt and enlarged in 1825, then replaced by the current twin-spired structure in 1852.<ref>tablet inscription on wall</ref>\n\nThe oldest African-American church in the town is Asbury United Methodist Church, founded as the Old Hill Church, a mixed congregation in 1818. It became an African-American congregation in 1864, renamed Asbury Methodist Episcopal Church in 1870, and built its current building on All Saints Street in 1921.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asburyumcfmd.org/about-us/who-we-are/|title=Asbury United Methodist Church \u00bb Who We Are|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nTogether, these churches dominated the town, set against the backdrop of the first ridge of the Appalachians, [[Catoctin Mountain]]. The abolitionist poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] later immortalized this view of Frederick in his poem to [[Barbara Fritchie]]: \"The clustered spires of Frederick stand / Green-walled by the hills of Maryland.\"<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/householdbookpo00unkngoog|quote=the clustered spires of frederick stand.|title=The Household Book of Poetry|last=Dana|first=Charles Anderson, ed.|publisher=D.

(This later became [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|U.S. Route 40]].) Frederick's [[Jacob Engelbrecht]] corresponded with Jefferson in 1824 (receiving a transcribed psalm in return), and kept a diary from 1819-1878 which remains an important first-hand account of 19th century life from its viewpoint on the National Road.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/founders/default.xqy?keys=FOEA-print-04-02-02-4075|title=From Thomas Jefferson to Jacob Engelbrecht, 25 February 1824|publisher=}}</ref><ref>http://www.hsfcinfo.org/bookstore/frederick.htm</ref> An important house remaining from this era is the [[spite house|Tyler Spite House]], built in 1814 at 112 W.

It exported gold, copper, limestone, marble, iron and other minerals. As early as the American Revolution, [[Catoctin Furnace]] near [[Thurmont, Maryland|Thurmont]] became important for iron production.<ref>[[John Thomas Scharf|J. Thomas Scharf]], ''History of Western Maryland'', Vol. I. Philadelphia: Louis H.

Also in 1831, the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) completed its [[Frederick Branch (Baltimore and Ohio Railroad)|Frederick Branch]] line from the Frederick (or Monocacy) Junction off the main Western Line from Baltimore to [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]], and the [[Ohio River]].

President Lincoln arrested several members, and the assembly was unable to convene a quorum to vote on secession.\n\nAs a major crossroads, Frederick, like [[Winchester, Virginia]], and [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]], saw considerable action during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwartrails.org|title=Civil War Trails: Maryland, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia|publisher=}}</ref> [[Slaves]] also escaped from or through Frederick (since Maryland was still a \"slave state\" although an unseceded border state) to join the Union forces, work against the Confederacy and seek freedom. During the [[Maryland Campaign|Maryland campaigns]], both [[Union Army|Union]] and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] troops marched through the city. Frederick also hosted several hospitals to nurse the wounded from those battles, as is related in the [[National Museum of Civil War Medicine]] on East Patrick Street.\n\n[[File:Barbara Frietchie (poem).jpg|thumb|1896 print illustrating the legend of [[Barbara Fritchie]].]]\nA legend related by [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] claimed that Frederick's Pennsylvania Dutch women (including [[Barbara Fritchie]] who reportedly waved a flag) booed the Confederates in September 1862, as General [[Stonewall Jackson]] led his light infantry division through Frederick on his way to the battles of [[Battle of South Mountain|Crampton's, Fox's and Turner's Gaps]] on [[South Mountain (Maryland and Pennsylvania)|South Mountain]] and [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]] near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]]. Union Major General [[Jesse L. Reno]]'s IX Corps followed Jackson's men through the city a few days later on the way to the [[Battle of South Mountain]], where Reno died. The sites of the battles are due west of the city along the [[National Road]], west of [[Burkittsville, Maryland|Burkittsville]]. Confederate troops under Jackson and Walker unsuccessfully attempted to halt the Federal army's westward advance into the [[Cumberland Valley]] and towards [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]].  [[Gathland State Park]] has the War Correspondents' Memorial stone arch erected by reporter/editor [[George Alfred Townsend]] (1841\u20131914). The 1889 memorial commemorating Major General Reno and the Union soldiers of his IX Corps is on Reno Monument Road west of [[Middletown, Maryland|Middletown]], just below the summit of [[Fox's Gap]], as is a 1993 memorial to slain Confederate Brig. Gen. [[Samuel Garland Jr.]], and the [[North Carolina]] troops who held the line.\n\nPresident [[Abraham Lincoln]], on his way to visit Gen. [[George McClellan]] after the [[Battle of South Mountain]] and the [[Battle of Antietam]], delivered a short speech at what was then the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B. & O. Railroad]] depot at the current intersection of East All Saints and South Market Streets. A plaque commemorates the speech (at what is today the Frederick Community Action Agency, a Social Services office).\n\nAt the [[Prospect Hall (Frederick, Maryland)|Prospect Hall]] mansion off Jefferson Street to Buckeystown Pike near what is now Butterfly Lane, in the early morning hours of June 28, 1863, a messenger arrived from President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and General-in-Chief [[Henry Halleck]], informing General [[George Meade]] that he would be replacing General [[Joseph Hooker]] after the latter's disastrous performance at [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] in May. The [[Army of the Potomac]] camped around the Prospect Hall property for the several days as skirmishers pursued [[Robert E. Lee|Lee's]] Confederate [[Army of Northern Virginia]] prior to [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]]. A large granite rectangular monument made from one of the boulders at the \"Devil's Den\" in Gettysburg to the east along the driveway commemorates the midnight change-of-command.\n\nIn July 1864, in the third Southern invasion, Confederate troops led by Lieutenant General Jubal Early occupied Frederick and extorted $200,000 (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|200000|1864}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) from citizens for not razing the city on their way to Washington D.C.<ref>Frederic Historic District inventory, NRIS F-3-039, section 8 p. 2 available at http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/stagsere/se1/se5/010000/010400/010482/pdf/msa_se5_10482.pdf</ref> Union troops under Major General [[Lew Wallace]] fought a successful delaying action, in what became the last significant Confederate advance at the [[Battle of Monocacy]], also known as the \"Battle that saved Washington.\" The [[Monocacy National Battlefield]] lies just southeast of the city limits, along the [[Monocacy River]] at the B. & O. Railroad junction where two bridges cross the stream - an iron-truss bridge for the railroad and a covered wooden bridge for the Frederick-Urbana-Georgetown Pike, which was the site of the main battle of July 1864.  Some skirmishing occurred further northeast of town at the stone-arched \"Jug Bridge\" where the [[National Road]] crossed the Monocacy; and an artillery bombardment occurred along the National Road west of town near Red Man's Hill and [[Prospect Hall (Frederick, Maryland)|Prospect Hall]] mansion as the Union troops retreated eastward.  [[Antietam National Battlefield]] and [[South Mountain State Park|South Mountain State Battlefield Park]] which commemorates the 1862 battles are located 23 miles and 35 miles respectively to the west-northwest. While [[Gettysburg National Battlefield]] of 1863 lies approximately {{convert|35|mi}} to the north-northeast.\n\nThe reconstructed home of [[Barbara Fritchie]] stands on West Patrick Street, just past Carroll Creek linear park. Fritchie, a significant figure in Maryland history in her own right, is buried in Frederick's [[Mount Olivet Cemetery (Frederick)|Mount Olivet Cemetery]]. British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] quoted Whittier's poem to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] when they stopped here in 1941 on a car trip to the presidential retreat, then called \"Shangra-La\" (now \"[[Camp David]]\") within the [[Catoctin Mountains]] near Thurmont.\n\n===Late 19th century===\nAdmiral [[Winfield Scott Schley]] (1839\u20131911) was born at \"Richfields\", the mansion home of his father. He became an important naval commander of the American fleet on board his flagship and heavy cruiser [[USS Baltimore (C-3)|USS ''Baltimore'']] along with Admiral [[William T. Sampson]] in the [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]] off the shores of the Spanish island colony of [[Cuba]] in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1898. Major Henry Schley's son, Dr. Fairfax Schley, was instrumental in setting up the Frederick County Agricultural Society and the Great Frederick Fair.<ref>[[J. Thomas Scharf|Scharf, J. Thomas]].

However, it defaulted on its interest payments in 1874 and acquired by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] in 1875, which formed a new division to operate the rail line. In the spring of 1896, the Frederick and Pennsylvania Line railroad was liquidated in a judicial sale to the Pennsylvania Railroad for $150,000. The railroad survived through mergers and the Penn-Central bankruptcy. However, the State of Maryland acquired the Frederick and Pennsylvania Line in 1982. As of 2013, all but two miles ({{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=output only|1}}) at the southern terminus at Frederick still exist, operated by either the [[Walkersville Southern Railroad|Walkersville Southern]], or the [[Maryland Midland Railway|Maryland Midland Railway (MMID)]] railroads.\n\n[[Jewish]] pioneers Henry Lazarus and Levy Cohan settled in Frederick in the 1740s as merchants. Mostly German Jewish immigrants organized a community in the mid-19th century, creating the [[Frederick Hebrew Congregation]] in 1858. Later the congregation lapsed, but was reorganized in 1917 as a cooperative effort between the older settlers and more recently arrived Eastern European Jews under the name [[Beth Sholom Congregation (Frederick, Maryland)|Beth Sholom Congregation]].\n\nIn 1905, Rev. E. B. Hatcher started the First [[Baptist]] Church of Frederick.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the Maryland legislature established racially segregated public facilities by the end of the 19th century, re-imposing white supremacy. Black institutions were typically underfunded in the state, and it was not until 1921 that Frederick established a public high school for [[African Americans]]. First located at 170 West All Saints Street, it moved to 250 Madison Street, where it eventually was adapted as [[South Frederick Elementary]]. The building presently houses the [[Lincoln Elementary School (Frederick, Maryland)|Lincoln Elementary School]]. The [[Laboring Sons Memorial Grounds]], a cemetery for [[free negro|free blacks]], was founded in 1851.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:2008 03 28 - Frederick - Carroll Creek at MD 355 (N Bentz St) 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Carroll Creek (Maryland)|Carroll Creek]] running through Baker Park, with the Joseph Dill Baker Carillon in the background]]\nFrederick is located in [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]] in the northern part of the state of Maryland.

It is part of the [[Baltimore\u2013Washington metropolitan area|Baltimore\u2013Washington Metropolitan Area]]. Frederick has long been an important crossroads, located at the intersection of a major north\u2013south Indian trail and east\u2013west routes to the [[Chesapeake Bay]], both at [[Baltimore]] and what became [[Washington, D.C.]] and across the [[Appalachian mountains]] to the [[Ohio River]] watershed. It is a part of the [[Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV Metropolitan Statistical Area]], which is part of a greater [[Washington-Baltimore-Arlington, DC-MD-VA-WV-PA Combined Statistical Area]]. The city's population was 65,239 people at the [[2010 United States Census]], making it the second-largest incorporated city in Maryland, behind [[Baltimore]].

Native American hunters possibly including the [[Susquehannock]]s, the Algonquian-speaking [[Shawnee]], or the [[Seneca people|Seneca]] or [[Tuscarora people|Tuscarora]] or other members of the [[Iroquois Confederation]]) followed the [[Monocacy River]] from the [[Susquehanna River]] watershed in Pennsylvania to the [[Potomac River]] watershed and the lands of the more agrarian and maritime [[Algonquian peoples]], particularly the [[Lenape]] of the Delaware valley or the [[Piscataway tribe|Piscataway]] and [[Powhatan]] of the lower Potomac watershed and Chesapeake Bay. This became known as the Monocacy Trail or even the [[Great Indian Warpath]], with some travelers continuing southward through the \"[[Great Appalachian Valley]]\" ([[Shenandoah Valley]], etc.) to the western [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] in [[North Carolina]], or traveling down other watersheds in Virginia toward the [[Chesapeake Bay]], such as those of the [[Rappahannock River|Rappahannock]], [[James River|James]] and [[York River (Virginia)|York River]]s.\n\n===Colonial era===\nThe earliest European settlement was slightly north of Frederick in [[Monocacy, Maryland]]. Founded before 1730, when the Indian trail became a wagon road, Monocacy was abandoned before the [[American Revolutionary War]], perhaps due to the river's periodic flooding or hostilities predating the [[French and Indian War]], or simply Frederick's better location with easier access to the Potomac River near its confluence with the Monocacy.\n\n[[Daniel Dulany the Elder|Daniel Dulany]]\u2014a land speculator\u2014laid out \"Frederick Town\" by 1745.<ref>See for example the ''Overall history of Frederick'', pp. 2\u20136</ref><ref>NRIS F-03-039 at section 8 p.2 available at http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/stagsere/se1/se5/010000/010400/010482/pdf/msa_se5_10482.pdf</ref> Three years earlier, [[All Saints Church (Frederick, Maryland)|All Saints Church]] had been founded on a hilltop near a warehouse/trading post.<ref>Herb Wolf III, Houses of Worship in Frederick, Maryland: a 250 Year History 1745-1995 (Baltimore: Gateway Press, Inc., 1995) p. 3</ref> Sources disagree as to which Frederick the town was named for, but the likeliest candidates are [[Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore]] (one of the proprietors of Maryland<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/ftfrederickhistory.html|title=Fort Frederick State Park History|publisher=[[Maryland Department of Natural Resources]]|accessdate=October 7, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005164303/http://www.dnr.state.md.us/publiclands/ftfrederickhistory.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate=October 5, 2007}}</ref>), [[Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mdmunicipal.org/cities/index.cfm?townname=Frederick&page=home|title=Frederick, Maryland|publisher=Maryland Municipal League|accessdate=October 9, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021105716/http://mdmunicipal.org/cities/index.cfm?townname=Frederick&page=home|archivedate=October 21, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick \"The Great\" of Prussia]].\n[[File:Evangelical Lutheran on East Church Street - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Evangelical Lutheran Church (Frederick, Maryland)]] (1752)]]\nIn 1748, Frederick County was formed by carving a section off of Prince George's County.

Probably the oldest house still standing in Frederick today is [[Schifferstadt (Frederick, Maryland)|Schifferstadt]], built in 1756 by German settler Joseph Brunner and now the Schifferstadt Architectural Museum.\n\nSchley's group was among the many [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] (ethnic Germans) (as well as Scots-Irish and French and later Irish) who migrated south and westward in the late-18th century. Frederick was an important stop along the migration route that became known as the [[Great Wagon Road]], which came down from [[Gettysburg, Pennsylvania]] and [[Emmitsburg, Maryland]] and continued south following the [[Great Appalachian Valley]] through [[Winchester, Virginia|Winchester]] and [[Roanoke, Virginia]]. Another important route continued along the Potomac River from near Frederick, to [[Hagerstown, Maryland|Hagerstown]], where it split. One branch crossed the Potomac River near [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]] and continued down into the Shenandoah valley. The other continued west to [[Cumberland, Maryland]] and ultimately crossed the [[Appalachian Mountains]] into the watershed of the [[Ohio River]]. Thus, British [[Edward Braddock|General Edward Braddock]] marched his troops (including the youthful [[George Washington]]) west in 1755 through Frederick on the way to their fateful ambush near [[Fort Duquesne]] (later [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]], then [[Pittsburgh]]) during the [[French and Indian War]]. However, the British after the [[Proclamation of 1763]] restricted that westward migration route until after the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Other westward migrants continued south from Frederick to Roanoke along the Great Wagon Road, crossing the Appalachians into [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]] at the [[Cumberland Gap]] near the Virginia/North Carolina border.\n\nOther German settlers in Frederick were [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America|Evangelical Lutherans]], led by Rev. [[Henry Muhlenberg]]. They moved their mission church from Monocacy to what became a large complex a few blocks further down Church Street from the Anglicans and the German Reformed Church. Methodist missionary [[Robert Strawbridge]] accepted an invitation to preach at Frederick town in 1770, and [[Francis Asbury]] arrived two years later, both helping to found a congregation which became Calvary Methodist Church, worshiping in a log building from 1792 (although superseded by larger buildings in 1841, 1865, 1910 and 1930).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.calvaryumc.org/about-us/our-building |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-06-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715074906/http://www.calvaryumc.org/about-us/our-building/ |archivedate=July 15, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Frederick also had a Catholic mission, to which Rev. [[John Dubois|Jean DuBois]] was assigned in 1792, which became [[St. John the Evangelist Catholic Church (Frederick, Maryland)|St. John the Evangelist Church]] (built in 1800).\n\nTo control this crossroads during the [[American Revolution]], the British garrisoned a German [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian]] regiment in the town; {{as of |2011 |alt=the war (the stone, L-shaped \"[[Hessian Barracks]]\" still stand).}}\n\n===Early 19th century===\n[[File:Old All Saints Episcopal Church in Frederick.jpg|thumb|left|All Saints Church, erected 1813, Principal Parish Church until 1855]]As the county seat for Western Maryland, Frederick not only was an important market town, but also the seat of justice. Although [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] and [[Washington County, Maryland|Washington County]] were split off from Frederick County in 1776, Frederick remained the seat of the smaller (though still large) county. Important lawyers who practiced in Frederick included [[John Hanson]], [[Francis Scott Key]] and [[Roger B. Taney]].\n\n[[File:All saints and ucc spires Frederick.jpg|thumb|Church Street with All Saints and Reformed Church spires, Frederick]]Frederick was also known during the nineteenth century for its religious pluralism, with one of its main thoroughfares, Church Street, hosting about a half dozen major churches. In 1793, All Saints Church hosted the first confirmation of an American citizen, by the newly consecrated Episcopal Bishop [[Thomas Claggett]]. That original colonial building was replaced in 1814 by a brick classical revival structure. It still stands today, although the principal worship space has become an even larger brick gothic church joining it at the back and facing Frederick's City Hall (so the parish remains the oldest Episcopal Church in western Maryland).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allsaintsmd.org/history.php|title=All Saints' Episcopal Church|publisher=}}</ref> The main Catholic church, dedicated to St. John the Evangelist, was built in 1800, then rebuilt in 1837 (across the street) one block north of Church Street on East Second Street, where it still stands along with a school and convent established by the [[Visitation Sisters]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stjohn-frederick.org/aboutus.asp|title=St. John the Evangelist, Roman Catholic Church \u2013 Frederick, Maryland|accessdate=December 16, 2007|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212013640/http://www.stjohn-frederick.org/aboutus.asp|archivedate=December 12, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The stone Evangelical Lutheran Church of 1752 was also rebuilt and enlarged in 1825, then replaced by the current twin-spired structure in 1852.<ref>tablet inscription on wall</ref>\n\nThe oldest African-American church in the town is Asbury United Methodist Church, founded as the Old Hill Church, a mixed congregation in 1818.

(This later became [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|U.S. Route 40]].) Frederick's [[Jacob Engelbrecht]] corresponded with Jefferson in 1824 (receiving a transcribed psalm in return), and kept a diary from 1819-1878 which remains an important first-hand account of 19th century life from its viewpoint on the National Road.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rotunda.upress.virginia.edu/founders/default.xqy?keys=FOEA-print-04-02-02-4075|title=From Thomas Jefferson to Jacob Engelbrecht, 25 February 1824|publisher=}}</ref><ref>http://www.hsfcinfo.org/bookstore/frederick.htm</ref> An important house remaining from this era is the [[spite house|Tyler Spite House]], built in 1814 at 112 W.

It exported gold, copper, limestone, marble, iron and other minerals. As early as the American Revolution, [[Catoctin Furnace]] near [[Thurmont, Maryland|Thurmont]] became important for iron production.<ref>[[John Thomas Scharf|J.

Also in 1831, the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) completed its [[Frederick Branch (Baltimore and Ohio Railroad)|Frederick Branch]] line from the Frederick (or Monocacy) Junction off the main Western Line from Baltimore to [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]], [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]], and the [[Ohio River]].

President Lincoln arrested several members, and the assembly was unable to convene a quorum to vote on secession.\n\nAs a major crossroads, Frederick, like [[Winchester, Virginia]], and [[Martinsburg, West Virginia]], saw considerable action during the [[American Civil War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civilwartrails.org|title=Civil War Trails: Maryland, North Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia|publisher=}}</ref> [[Slaves]] also escaped from or through Frederick (since Maryland was still a \"slave state\" although an unseceded border state) to join the Union forces, work against the Confederacy and seek freedom. During the [[Maryland Campaign|Maryland campaigns]], both [[Union Army|Union]] and [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] troops marched through the city. Frederick also hosted several hospitals to nurse the wounded from those battles, as is related in the [[National Museum of Civil War Medicine]] on East Patrick Street.\n\n[[File:Barbara Frietchie (poem).jpg|thumb|1896 print illustrating the legend of [[Barbara Fritchie]].]]\nA legend related by [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] claimed that Frederick's Pennsylvania Dutch women (including [[Barbara Fritchie]] who reportedly waved a flag) booed the Confederates in September 1862, as General [[Stonewall Jackson]] led his light infantry division through Frederick on his way to the battles of [[Battle of South Mountain|Crampton's, Fox's and Turner's Gaps]] on [[South Mountain (Maryland and Pennsylvania)|South Mountain]] and [[Battle of Antietam|Antietam]] near [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]]. Union Major General [[Jesse L. Reno]]'s IX Corps followed Jackson's men through the city a few days later on the way to the [[Battle of South Mountain]], where Reno died. The sites of the battles are due west of the city along the [[National Road]], west of [[Burkittsville, Maryland|Burkittsville]]. Confederate troops under Jackson and Walker unsuccessfully attempted to halt the Federal army's westward advance into the [[Cumberland Valley]] and towards [[Sharpsburg, Maryland|Sharpsburg]].  [[Gathland State Park]] has the War Correspondents' Memorial stone arch erected by reporter/editor [[George Alfred Townsend]] (1841\u20131914). The 1889 memorial commemorating Major General Reno and the Union soldiers of his IX Corps is on Reno Monument Road west of [[Middletown, Maryland|Middletown]], just below the summit of [[Fox's Gap]], as is a 1993 memorial to slain Confederate Brig. Gen. [[Samuel Garland Jr.]], and the [[North Carolina]] troops who held the line.\n\nPresident [[Abraham Lincoln]], on his way to visit Gen. [[George McClellan]] after the [[Battle of South Mountain]] and the [[Battle of Antietam]], delivered a short speech at what was then the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad|B. & O. Railroad]] depot at the current intersection of East All Saints and South Market Streets. A plaque commemorates the speech (at what is today the Frederick Community Action Agency, a Social Services office).\n\nAt the [[Prospect Hall (Frederick, Maryland)|Prospect Hall]] mansion off Jefferson Street to Buckeystown Pike near what is now Butterfly Lane, in the early morning hours of June 28, 1863, a messenger arrived from President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and General-in-Chief [[Henry Halleck]], informing General [[George Meade]] that he would be replacing General [[Joseph Hooker]] after the latter's disastrous performance at [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] in May. The [[Army of the Potomac]] camped around the Prospect Hall property for the several days as skirmishers pursued [[Robert E. Lee|Lee's]] Confederate [[Army of Northern Virginia]] prior to [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]]. A large granite rectangular monument made from one of the boulders at the \"Devil's Den\" in Gettysburg to the east along the driveway commemorates the midnight change-of-command.\n\nIn July 1864, in the third Southern invasion, Confederate troops led by Lieutenant General Jubal Early occupied Frederick and extorted $200,000 (${{formatprice|{{Inflation|US|200000|1864}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) from citizens for not razing the city on their way to Washington D.C.<ref>Frederic Historic District inventory, NRIS F-3-039, section 8 p. 2 available at http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/stagsere/se1/se5/010000/010400/010482/pdf/msa_se5_10482.pdf</ref> Union troops under Major General [[Lew Wallace]] fought a successful delaying action, in what became the last significant Confederate advance at the [[Battle of Monocacy]], also known as the \"Battle that saved Washington.\" The [[Monocacy National Battlefield]] lies just southeast of the city limits, along the [[Monocacy River]] at the B. & O. Railroad junction where two bridges cross the stream - an iron-truss bridge for the railroad and a covered wooden bridge for the Frederick-Urbana-Georgetown Pike, which was the site of the main battle of July 1864.  Some skirmishing occurred further northeast of town at the stone-arched \"Jug Bridge\" where the [[National Road]] crossed the Monocacy; and an artillery bombardment occurred along the National Road west of town near Red Man's Hill and [[Prospect Hall (Frederick, Maryland)|Prospect Hall]] mansion as the Union troops retreated eastward.  [[Antietam National Battlefield]] and [[South Mountain State Park|South Mountain State Battlefield Park]] which commemorates the 1862 battles are located 23 miles and 35 miles respectively to the west-northwest. While [[Gettysburg National Battlefield]] of 1863 lies approximately {{convert|35|mi}} to the north-northeast.\n\nThe reconstructed home of [[Barbara Fritchie]] stands on West Patrick Street, just past Carroll Creek linear park. Fritchie, a significant figure in Maryland history in her own right, is buried in Frederick's [[Mount Olivet Cemetery (Frederick)|Mount Olivet Cemetery]]. British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] quoted Whittier's poem to President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] when they stopped here in 1941 on a car trip to the presidential retreat, then called \"Shangra-La\" (now \"[[Camp David]]\") within the [[Catoctin Mountains]] near Thurmont.\n\n===Late 19th century===\nAdmiral [[Winfield Scott Schley]] (1839\u20131911) was born at \"Richfields\", the mansion home of his father. He became an important naval commander of the American fleet on board his flagship and heavy cruiser [[USS Baltimore (C-3)|USS ''Baltimore'']] along with Admiral [[William T. Sampson]] in the [[Battle of Santiago de Cuba]] off the shores of the Spanish island colony of [[Cuba]] in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]] in 1898. Major Henry Schley's son, Dr. Fairfax Schley, was instrumental in setting up the Frederick County Agricultural Society and the Great Frederick Fair.<ref>[[J. Thomas Scharf|Scharf, J. Thomas]].

However, it defaulted on its interest payments in 1874 and acquired by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] in 1875, which formed a new division to operate the rail line. In the spring of 1896, the Frederick and Pennsylvania Line railroad was liquidated in a judicial sale to the Pennsylvania Railroad for $150,000. The railroad survived through mergers and the Penn-Central bankruptcy. However, the State of Maryland acquired the Frederick and Pennsylvania Line in 1982. As of 2013, all but two miles ({{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=on|disp=output only|1}}) at the southern terminus at Frederick still exist, operated by either the [[Walkersville Southern Railroad|Walkersville Southern]], or the [[Maryland Midland Railway|Maryland Midland Railway (MMID)]] railroads.\n\n[[Jewish]] pioneers Henry Lazarus and Levy Cohan settled in Frederick in the 1740s as merchants. Mostly German Jewish immigrants organized a community in the mid-19th century, creating the [[Frederick Hebrew Congregation]] in 1858. Later the congregation lapsed, but was reorganized in 1917 as a cooperative effort between the older settlers and more recently arrived Eastern European Jews under the name [[Beth Sholom Congregation (Frederick, Maryland)|Beth Sholom Congregation]].\n\nIn 1905, Rev. E. B. Hatcher started the First [[Baptist]] Church of Frederick.\n\nAfter the Civil War, the Maryland legislature established racially segregated public facilities by the end of the 19th century, re-imposing white supremacy. Black institutions were typically underfunded in the state, and it was not until 1921 that Frederick established a public high school for [[African Americans]]. First located at 170 West All Saints Street, it moved to 250 Madison Street, where it eventually was adapted as [[South Frederick Elementary]]. The building presently houses the [[Lincoln Elementary School (Frederick, Maryland)|Lincoln Elementary School]]. The [[Laboring Sons Memorial Grounds]], a cemetery for [[free negro|free blacks]], was founded in 1851.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:2008 03 28 - Frederick - Carroll Creek at MD 355 (N Bentz St) 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Carroll Creek (Maryland)|Carroll Creek]] running through Baker Park, with the Joseph Dill Baker Carillon in the background]]\nFrederick is located in [[Frederick County, Maryland|Frederick County]] in the northern part of the state of Maryland.

It is, along with the [[Kansas Army National Guard]], an element of the [[Kansas National Guard]]. \n\nAs state militia units, the units in the Kansas Air National Guard are not in the normal [[United States Air Force]] [[command hierarchy|chain of command]].

The Kansas Air National Guard is headquartered in Topeka, and its commander is {{As of|2012|alt=currently}} Brigadier General Bradley S. Link.\n\n==Overview==\nUnder the \"Total Force\" concept, Kansas Air National Guard units are considered to be Air Reserve Components (ARC) of the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF).   Kansas ANG units are trained and equipped by the Air Force and are operationally gained by a [[Major Command of the USAF]] if federalized.  In addition, the Kansas Air National Guard forces are assigned to Air Expeditionary Forces and are subject to deployment tasking orders along with their active duty and Air Force Reserve counterparts in their assigned cycle deployment window.\n\nAlong with their federal reserve obligations, as state militia units the elements of the Kansas ANG are subject to being activated by order of the Governor to provide protection of life and property, and preserve peace, order and public safety. State missions include disaster relief in times of earthquakes, hurricanes, floods and forest fires, search and rescue, protection of vital public services, and support to civil defense.\n\n==Components==\nThe Kansas Air National Guard consists of the following major units:\n* [[190th Air Refueling Wing]]\n: Established 23 February 1957 (as: [[117th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]]); operates: [[KC-135R Stratotanker]]\n: Stationed at: [[Forbes Field Air National Guard Base]], Topeka\n: Gained by: [[Air Mobility Command]]\n: The 190th ARW provides worldwide air refueling support to major commands of the United States Air Force, as well as other U.S. military forces and the military forces of allied nations flying the KC-135 Stratotanker.<ref>[http://www.190arw.ang.af.mil 190th Air Refueling Wing website]</ref>\n\n* [[184th Intelligence Wing]]\n: Established 4 Aug 1941 (as: [[127th Observation Squadron]])\n: Stationed at: [[McConnell Air Force Base]], Wichita\n: Gained by: [[Air Force Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Agency]]\n: The 184th IW  provides wartime support in the form of collecting and analyzing intelligence. Some unit members deploy overseas to augment active duty forces.<ref>[http://www.184iw.ang.af.mil 184th Intelligence Wing website]</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Militia Act of 1903]] established the present National Guard system, units raised by the states but paid for by the Federal Government, liable for immediate state service. If [[Federalization of the National Guard|federalized]] by Presidential order, they fall under the regular military chain of command.

According to the [[South African National Census of 2011|2011 census,]] it has a population of 27,539.<ref name=census2011 />\n\nMoreleta Park is a suburban area with the majority of people commuting to work elsewhere; e.g. Johannesburg. It has a broad mixture of properties including office parks, retail shopping centers, hospitals, churches, upmarket single stand housing, gated security complexes, as well as typically smaller and higher density residential units built within an outer wall that forms a security barrier. There is also an informal settlement called \"Plastic View\" within the borders of the suburb. This poverty stricken settlement does not receive much noted support from the local council. Some local charities are reaching out to these residents from time to time.\n\nThe Moreleta Kloof Nature Reserve contains African wild life; zebras, springbok and other small antelope and ostriches may be observed.

According to the [[South African National Census of 2011|2011 census,]] it has a population of 27,539.<ref name=census2011 />\n\nMoreleta Park is a suburban area with the majority of people commuting to work elsewhere; e.g. Johannesburg. It has a broad mixture of properties including office parks, retail shopping centers, hospitals, churches, upmarket single stand housing, gated security complexes, as well as typically smaller and higher density residential units built within an outer wall that forms a security barrier. There is also an informal settlement called \"Plastic View\" within the borders of the suburb. This poverty stricken settlement does not receive much noted support from the local council. Some local charities are reaching out to these residents from time to time.\n\nThe Moreleta Kloof Nature Reserve contains African wild life; zebras, springbok and other small antelope and ostriches may be observed. Entrance is free of charge and it is the best place for Sunday Morning Walk.\n\nMoreleta Park falls under the [[City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality]].\n\n===Name and History===\nMoreleta is situated on and was eventually a sub-division of one of the the first farms in Pretoria, owned by Daniel Erasmus.
