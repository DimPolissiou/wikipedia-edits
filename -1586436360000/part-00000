The biggest per case rise in crime was in property, with an increase of 96,786 cases.<ref name=\":0\" /> During this decade, although murder cases were the lowest of crimes reported under violent crimes, they had the highest percentage of arrests.

The majority of crimes were related to property, with a total figure of 62,072 which is approximately 2.1% of the population. The next biggest category was larceny-theft with 43,657 cases.

The increase in population was by 555,955 people. Violent crime increased nearly 470%, rising to 7,546 cases.

However, after several years of lackluster trading with the French, Red Shoes decided to offer an invitation to trade to the British. The British were willing to sell guns and other goods to the Choctaw at lower prices than the French were, and soon Red Shoes (who was affiliated with the western division) was able to further increase his political power.

However, when some of Red Shoe's former followers began to renege on his choice to open trade to the British, the dead chief's loyal supporters began to attack them.
