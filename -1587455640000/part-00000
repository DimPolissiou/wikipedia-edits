The name is probably from Bulgarian ''shuma'' '(deciduous forest).'<ref>E.M.

The [[eleventh edition of the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] lists it as ''Shumla'',<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Shumla |volume=24 |page=1023}}</ref> similar to the way it lists [[Pleven]] as Plevna.\n\n==History==\n=== Antiquity and the Middle Ages ===\n[[File:Shumen Fortress Main Tower.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Restored wall fragments and tower of the Shumen fortress, with ruins in the foreground.]]\nEarliest reports for [[Shumen fortress]] date back to the early [[Iron Age]]. From the 12th century BC is the first fort, surrounding accessible parts of the area. Archaeological surveys, conducted in 1957, 1961 to 1987, determined the chronological periods, the lifestyle and the livelihood of the inhabitants of the fortress. It had a wall thickness of about two meters, built of rough stones. In the 5th century BC a second wall was built in front of the former.\n\nIn the 2nd century the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] built a military fortress on the ruins of the [[Thracians|Thracian]] fortifications. The construction of the wall is already bonded to [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]]; a tower was constructed above the gate; square tower was built to the west and semicircular to the south. In the 4-5th centuries the entire hill was fortified with a new wall with nine towers. Between the 8th and the 10th century the fort was renovated, for the purpose the Roman wall and towers were used and to the northeast was built a new wall with two towers.\n\nIn 681 khan [[Asparukh]] incorporated the territory into the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. In 811 Shumen was burned by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Nikephoros I|Nicephorus]]. He was killed at the [[Battle of Pliska]]. Khan [[Krum of Bulgaria]] encased Nicephorus's skull in silver and used it as a cup for wine drinking. The Bulgarian fortification of the 7-10th centuries developed into a feudal city with a castle with surrounding inner and outer defensive zones, in which can be counted 28 towers and bastions, three gates and five small porticoes, and many churches and workshops (12th to 14th century). During the golden age of Bulgarian culture under [[Simeon the Great]] (893-927), Shumen was a centre of cultural and religious activity, and may have borne the name ''Simeonis''.\n\nDuring the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], Shumen was a significant military, administrative and economic center, displacing the old Bulgarian capital [[Preslav]] and developing outside the fortress. In the medieval city of Shumen the main religion was the [[Orthodox Christianity]], evidence of which were the found in the outline of the walls, seven churches, commemorative coins with the image of crosses, angels, and numerous findings of Orthodox crosses separately, as well as their image on rings and on other artefacts, found in the graves and the homes. Change occurs only after the Ottoman conquest of the city in the 15th century, when [[Islam]] was introduced.\n\n=== Ottoman Empire ===\nIn 1388 the sultan [[Murad I]] forced it to surrender to the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name=EB1911/> After [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Warne\u0144czyk]]'s unsuccessful crusade in 1444, the city was destroyed by the Ottomans and moved to its present location. In the 18th century it was enlarged and fortified.<ref name=EB1911/> Three times (1774, 1810 and 1828) it was unsuccessfully attacked by Russian armies.<ref name=EB1911/> The Turks consequently gave it the name of ''Gazi'' (\"Victorious\").<ref name=EB1911/> In 1854 it was the headquarters of [[Omar Pasha]] and the point at which the Turkish army concentrated (see [[Crimean War]]).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==== Bulgarian National Revival ====\n[[File:BASA-1735K-1-345-17-Postcard from Shumen, Bulgaria, 1912.jpg|thumb|250px|Postcard from Shumen, 1912]]\nDuring the 19th century, Shumen was an important centre of the [[Bulgarian National Revival]], with the first celebration of [[Cyril and Methodius]] in the Bulgarian lands taking place on 11 May 1813 and the first theatre performance. A girls' religious school was established in 1828; a class school for girls and a ''[[chitalishte]]'' (community centre) followed in 1856. The first Bulgarian symphony orchestra was founded in the city in 1850. In the same year, influential [[Hungary|Hungarian]] politician and revolutionary leader [[Lajos Kossuth]] spent a part of his exile in the then-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] town of Shumen. The house he lived in is preserved as a museum.\n\n=== Kingdom of Bulgaria ===\nOn 22 June 1878 Shumen finally capitulated to the Russians and became part of the newly independent [[Bulgaria]]. In 1882 the [[Shumensko|Shumen Brewery]], the first brewery in Bulgaria, was founded.\n\n=== People's Republic of Bulgaria ===\nIn the period 1950\u20131965 the city was called ''Kolarovgrad'', after the name of the communist leader [[Vasil Kolarov]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:\u0428\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d, \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \u041f\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u044a\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0434\u044a\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430 OKT 1993 1300 years monument,Shumen, Bulgaria.jpg|thumb|View of the city from the [[Monument to 1300 Years of Bulgaria]]]]\nThe city lies {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Varna]] and is built within a cluster of hills, northern outliers of the eastern Balkans, which curve around it on the west and south in the shape of a horseshoe.<ref name=EB1911/> A rugged ravine intersects the ground longitudinally in the horseshoe ridge.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nFrom Shumen roads radiate northwards to the [[Danube|Danubian]] cities of [[Rousse]] and [[Silistra]] and to [[Dobruja]], southwards to the passes of the [[Balkan Mountains|Balkans]], and eastwards to Varna and [[Balchik]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Population==\nIn January 2012, Shumen was inhabited by 80 511 people in the city limits, while the [[Shumen Municipality]] with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 93 160 inhabitants.<ref name=\"cities 2012\">{{in lang|bg}}[http://www.nsi.bg/otrasal.php?otr=19&a1=376&a2=377&a3=378 National Statistical Institute - 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113220442/http://www.nsi.bg/otrasal.php?otr=19&a1=376&a2=377&a3=378 |date=13 November 2012 }}</ref> The following table presents the change of the population after 1887.

From the 12th century BC is the first fort, surrounding accessible parts of the area. Archaeological surveys, conducted in 1957, 1961 to 1987, determined the chronological periods, the lifestyle and the livelihood of the inhabitants of the fortress. It had a wall thickness of about two meters, built of rough stones. In the 5th century BC a second wall was built in front of the former.\n\nIn the 2nd century the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] built a military fortress on the ruins of the [[Thracians|Thracian]] fortifications. The construction of the wall is already bonded to [[mortar (masonry)|mortar]]; a tower was constructed above the gate; square tower was built to the west and semicircular to the south. In the 4-5th centuries the entire hill was fortified with a new wall with nine towers. Between the 8th and the 10th century the fort was renovated, for the purpose the Roman wall and towers were used and to the northeast was built a new wall with two towers.\n\nIn 681 khan [[Asparukh]] incorporated the territory into the [[First Bulgarian Empire]]. In 811 Shumen was burned by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor [[Nikephoros I|Nicephorus]]. He was killed at the [[Battle of Pliska]]. Khan [[Krum of Bulgaria]] encased Nicephorus's skull in silver and used it as a cup for wine drinking. The Bulgarian fortification of the 7-10th centuries developed into a feudal city with a castle with surrounding inner and outer defensive zones, in which can be counted 28 towers and bastions, three gates and five small porticoes, and many churches and workshops (12th to 14th century). During the golden age of Bulgarian culture under [[Simeon the Great]] (893-927), Shumen was a centre of cultural and religious activity, and may have borne the name ''Simeonis''.\n\nDuring the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]], Shumen was a significant military, administrative and economic center, displacing the old Bulgarian capital [[Preslav]] and developing outside the fortress. In the medieval city of Shumen the main religion was the [[Orthodox Christianity]], evidence of which were the found in the outline of the walls, seven churches, commemorative coins with the image of crosses, angels, and numerous findings of Orthodox crosses separately, as well as their image on rings and on other artefacts, found in the graves and the homes. Change occurs only after the Ottoman conquest of the city in the 15th century, when [[Islam]] was introduced.\n\n=== Ottoman Empire ===\nIn 1388 the sultan [[Murad I]] forced it to surrender to the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name=EB1911/> After [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Warne\u0144czyk]]'s unsuccessful crusade in 1444, the city was destroyed by the Ottomans and moved to its present location. In the 18th century it was enlarged and fortified.<ref name=EB1911/> Three times (1774, 1810 and 1828) it was unsuccessfully attacked by Russian armies.<ref name=EB1911/> The Turks consequently gave it the name of ''Gazi'' (\"Victorious\").<ref name=EB1911/> In 1854 it was the headquarters of [[Omar Pasha]] and the point at which the Turkish army concentrated (see [[Crimean War]]).<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==== Bulgarian National Revival ====\n[[File:BASA-1735K-1-345-17-Postcard from Shumen, Bulgaria, 1912.jpg|thumb|250px|Postcard from Shumen, 1912]]\nDuring the 19th century, Shumen was an important centre of the [[Bulgarian National Revival]], with the first celebration of [[Cyril and Methodius]] in the Bulgarian lands taking place on 11 May 1813 and the first theatre performance. A girls' religious school was established in 1828; a class school for girls and a ''[[chitalishte]]'' (community centre) followed in 1856. The first Bulgarian symphony orchestra was founded in the city in 1850. In the same year, influential [[Hungary|Hungarian]] politician and revolutionary leader [[Lajos Kossuth]] spent a part of his exile in the then-[[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] town of Shumen. The house he lived in is preserved as a museum.\n\n=== Kingdom of Bulgaria ===\nOn 22 June 1878 Shumen finally capitulated to the Russians and became part of the newly independent [[Bulgaria]]. In 1882 the [[Shumensko|Shumen Brewery]], the first brewery in Bulgaria, was founded.\n\n=== People's Republic of Bulgaria ===\nIn the period 1950\u20131965 the city was called ''Kolarovgrad'', after the name of the communist leader [[Vasil Kolarov]].\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:\u0428\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d, \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f \u041f\u0430\u043c\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u044a\u0437\u0434\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0434\u044a\u0440\u0436\u0430\u0432\u0430 OKT 1993 1300 years monument,Shumen, Bulgaria.jpg|thumb|View of the city from the [[Monument to 1300 Years of Bulgaria]]]]\nThe city lies {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=off}} west of [[Varna]] and is built within a cluster of hills, northern outliers of the eastern Balkans, which curve around it on the west and south in the shape of a horseshoe.<ref name=EB1911/> A rugged ravine intersects the ground longitudinally in the horseshoe ridge.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nFrom Shumen roads radiate northwards to the [[Danube|Danubian]] cities of [[Rousse]] and [[Silistra]] and to [[Dobruja]], southwards to the passes of the [[Balkan Mountains|Balkans]], and eastwards to Varna and [[Balchik]].<ref name=EB1911/>\n\n==Population==\nIn January 2012, Shumen was inhabited by 80 511 people in the city limits, while the [[Shumen Municipality]] with the legally affiliated adjacent villages had 93 160 inhabitants.<ref name=\"cities 2012\">{{in lang|bg}}[http://www.nsi.bg/otrasal.php?otr=19&a1=376&a2=377&a3=378 National Statistical Institute - 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113220442/http://www.nsi.bg/otrasal.php?otr=19&a1=376&a2=377&a3=378 |date=13 November 2012 }}</ref> The following table presents the change of the population after 1887.

Despite socialising with the likes of [[Nick Cave]] from [[The Birthday Party (band)#The Boys Next Door|The Boys Next Door]] they remained outsiders to this scene (most of which consisted of people from middle-class backgrounds with private-school educations), and in 1978 moved to [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]].\n\nIn Fitzroy, they settled on a four-piece lineup for recording and found like-minded friends, such as [[Ollie Olsen]] and [[John Murphy (musician)|John Murphy]] of [[Whirlywirld]]. They drew influence from [[proto-punk]] acts like [[The Godz (NYC band)|The Godz]] and [[The Velvet Underground]], Texan 1960s psychedelic punk, [[James Brown]], and [[The Silver Apples]], as well as Australian bands like [[Billy Thorpe and the Aztecs]].\n\nThe band were instrumental in organising a series of gigs named \"[[little band scene|Little Band]] nights\", where hastily formed bands would play for 15 minutes each; this led to the recording of a compilation [[Extended play|EP]]. They became known for their use of a screeching [[Mosrite]] Ventures model guitar, primitive [[synthesizer]]s (a Wasp and Roland SH2), an electronic organ played through effects pedals and an extra fast drum machine ([[Roland CR-78]]).\n\nThe Primitive Calculators played their last gig in March 1980, though their self-titled live album came out in the early 1980s. The band reformed briefly in 1986 to perform a live version of their song \"Pumping Ugly Muscle\" in the [[Richard Lowenstein]] film ''[[Dogs In Space]]'' (they later appeared in Lowenstein's 2009 documentary \"We're Livin' on Dog Food\").<ref name=\"Pat\" />\n\n===Second era===\nIn 2001, a 1979 live recording of \"Pumping Ugly Muscle\" was included in \"Can't Stop It\", a compilation of Australian post-punk bands from 1978 to 1982, released by [[Chapter Music]]. The title of the [[CD]] was taken from the Calculators' only studio recording, made in December 1979, which was a 7\" single of the songs \"I Can't Stop It\" and \"Do That Dance\". This led to a renewed interest in the band that led to the 2003 release of the ''Glitter Kids'' EP, which featured three live recordings from 1979, by Meeuw Muzik in the [[Netherlands]].\n\nThe Primitive Calculators' album was reissued on CD by Chapter Music in 2004, with the inclusion of extra tracks from related projects (their first band The Moths from 1978 and other live recordings from 1979). In March 2007, [[Chapter Music]] released \"Primitive Calculators and Friends, 1979 to 1982\", a CD that contained the only studio recordings of the band (the 7\" single from 1979), the \"Little Band\" single, also from 1979, and live tracks from Little Band nights. It also contained other recordings from bands the members formed after 1980, such as a song called \"Zye Ye Ye\" (recorded in London in 1981 with Olsen and Murphy), and bands formed after the return of some of the band members to Australia from Europe, in 1982.\n\nIn January 2009, the band reformed for the inaugural Australian [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] music festival, curated by [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]] and held at [[Mount Buller, Victoria|Mount Buller]] in Victoria.<ref name=\"Pat\" /> The band subsequently commenced the recording of a new album, called ''The World Is Fucked'', released in 2013. Stuart Grant explained the album title in a December 2013 interview:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe album is called The World is F---ed because that's what we believe. The world's not any better now \u2013 in fact, it's worse. I can remember when the hippopotamus and rhinoceros weren't endangered species. I can remember when there was opposition, and when Chicago School economics wasn't a naturalised reality of life. And the anger in our music is because it doesn't need to be like that \u2013 and we don't need to be this nasty society.<ref name=\"Pat\" /></blockquote>\n\nGrant revealed that the band intends to record another album and stated: \"I want to make a psychedelic-space-folk record about taking hallucinogenic drugs.\"<ref name=\"Pat\" />\n\nMidway through recording their third LP Primitive Calculators were invited by [[Genjing Records]] and [[Split Works]] to play Jue Festival 2015 in Beijing and Shanghai. The band toured China also playing Xi\u2019an, Yiwu and Wuhan and released a tour edition split 7\" with activist noise artist Torturing Nurse. \n\nIn 2016, it Records released 'On Drugs', a single from Primitive Calculators forthcoming album by the same name. On Drugs, a boogie-rock soul inspired track, focused around the central character, Stuart Grant, signalled a change in the band's direction. The album is set for release in 2018.\n\n==Personal lives==\nGrant stated in 2013 that he enjoys reading, drinking coffee and tea, and \"being of use in other people's lives\".<ref name=\"Pat\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{cite book |last= McFarlane |first= Ian |title=  The encyclopedia of Australian rock and pop |url= https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofau00mcfa |url-access= registration |year= 1999 |publisher= Allen & Unwin |location=  St Leonards, N.S.W }}\n\n{{cite book |last= Spencer |first= Chris |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=  Who\u2019s who of Australian rock |year= 1989 |publisher= Five Mile Press|location= Fitzroy, Vic. }}\n\n{{cite book |last= Walker |first= Clinton |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=  [[Stranded: The Secret History of Australian Independent Music 1977\u20131991]] |year= 1996  |publisher= Pan Macmillan |location= Sydney }}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://primitivecalculators.com/ Official web site]\n*[http://illseeyoupigsinhell.wordpress.com/2008/11/07/interview-with-the-primitive-calculators/ Interview with Primitive Calculators on 3RRR FM]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsAlnH0wuEQ Interview with Richard Lowenstein on Lateline for \"We're Livin' On Dog Food\" documentary]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Victoria (Australia) musical groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1978]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=December 2013}}\n{{Infobox musical artist  <!-- See Wikipedia:WikiProject Musicians -->\n| name                = Primitive Calculators\n| image                 = \n| caption            = \n| image_size            = <!-- Only for images narrower than 220 pixels -->\n| background          = group_or_band\n| origin              = [[Melbourne, Australia]]\n| genre               = [[Post-punk]], [[synth punk]], [[noise rock]]\n| years_active        = 1978\u20131980, 2009 to present\n| label               = [[Chapter Music]]\n| associated_acts     = Numerous [[little band scene|Little Bands]], Dee Rays, The Egg, Use No Hooks, The Bum Steers, Mr. Bum and Ruby.\n}}\nThe '''Primitive Calculators''' are an Australian [[post-punk]] band, formed in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1978.

The band reformed briefly in 1986 to perform a live version of their song \"Pumping Ugly Muscle\" in the [[Richard Lowenstein]] film ''[[Dogs In Space]]'' (they later appeared in Lowenstein's 2009 documentary \"We're Livin' on Dog Food\").<ref name=\"Pat\" />\n\n===Second era===\nIn 2001, a 1979 live recording of \"Pumping Ugly Muscle\" was included in \"Can't Stop It\", a compilation of Australian post-punk bands from 1978 to 1982, released by [[Chapter Music]]. The title of the [[CD]] was taken from the Calculators' only studio recording, made in December 1979, which was a 7\" single of the songs \"I Can't Stop It\" and \"Do That Dance\". This led to a renewed interest in the band that led to the 2003 release of the ''Glitter Kids'' EP, which featured three live recordings from 1979, by Meeuw Muzik in the [[Netherlands]].\n\nThe Primitive Calculators' album was reissued on CD by Chapter Music in 2004, with the inclusion of extra tracks from related projects (their first band The Moths from 1978 and other live recordings from 1979). In March 2007, [[Chapter Music]] released \"Primitive Calculators and Friends, 1979 to 1982\", a CD that contained the only studio recordings of the band (the 7\" single from 1979), the \"Little Band\" single, also from 1979, and live tracks from Little Band nights. It also contained other recordings from bands the members formed after 1980, such as a song called \"Zye Ye Ye\" (recorded in London in 1981 with Olsen and Murphy), and bands formed after the return of some of the band members to Australia from Europe, in 1982.\n\nIn January 2009, the band reformed for the inaugural Australian [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] music festival, curated by [[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]] and held at [[Mount Buller, Victoria|Mount Buller]] in Victoria.<ref name=\"Pat\" /> The band subsequently commenced the recording of a new album, called ''The World Is Fucked', that was released in 2013. Lead singer Stuart Grant explained the album title in a December 2013 interview:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe album is called The World is F---ed because that's what we believe. The world's not any better now \u2013 in fact, it's worse. I can remember when the hippopotamus and rhinoceros weren't endangered species. I can remember when there was opposition, and when Chicago School economics wasn't a naturalised reality of life. And the anger in our music is because it doesn't need to be like that \u2013 and we don't need to be this nasty society.<ref name=\"Pat\" /></blockquote>\n\nGrant revealed that the band intends to record another album and stated: \"I want to make a psychedelic-space-folk record about taking hallucinogenic drugs.\"<ref name=\"Pat\" />\n\nMidway through recording their third LP Primitive Calculators were invited by [[Genjing Records]] and [[Split Works]] to play Jue Festival 2015 in Beijing and Shanghai. The band toured China also playing Xi\u2019an, Yiwu and Wuhan and released a tour edition split 7\" with activist noise artist Torturing Nurse. \n\nIn 2016, it Records released 'On Drugs', a single from Primitive Calculators forthcoming album by the same name. On Drugs, a boogie-rock soul inspired track, focused around the central character, Stuart Grant, signalled a change in the band's direction. The album is set for release in 2018.\n\n==Personal lives==\nGrant stated in 2013 that he enjoys reading, drinking coffee and tea, and \"being of use in other people's lives\".<ref name=\"Pat\" />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Citations==\n{{cite book |last= McFarlane |first= Ian |title=  The encyclopedia of Australian rock and pop |url= https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofau00mcfa |url-access= registration |year= 1999 |publisher= Allen & Unwin |location=  St Leonards, N.S.W }}\n\n{{cite book |last= Spencer |first= Chris |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=  Who\u2019s who of Australian rock |year= 1989 |publisher= Five Mile Press|location= Fitzroy, Vic. }}\n\n{{cite book |last= Walker |first= Clinton |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=  [[Stranded: The Secret History of Australian Independent Music 1977\u20131991]] |year= 1996  |publisher= Pan Macmillan |location= Sydney }}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://primitivecalculators.com/ Official web site]\n*[http://illseeyoupigsinhell.wordpress.com/2008/11/07/interview-with-the-primitive-calculators/ Interview with Primitive Calculators on 3RRR FM]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DsAlnH0wuEQ Interview with Richard Lowenstein on Lateline for \"We're Livin' On Dog Food\" documentary]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Victoria (Australia) musical groups]]\n[[Category:Musical groups established in 1978]]\n", "name_user": "Davidnicholsknowsbest", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSecond era", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_Calculators"}

Fortunately, Lili degenerated to the point where it was no longer a threat, so the crew was able to remain the full five days.<ref name=\"four\"/><ref name=\"history\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/history.html|title=NEEMO History|accessdate=November 16, 2011|work=NASA|date=March 21, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008171834/http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/NEEMO/history.html|archivedate=October 8, 2006}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of NEEMO 4, Meir was leaning toward pursuing a [[PhD]] in a field related to [[evolutionary biology]] and/or life in [[extreme environment]]s ([[astrobiology]]).

The novels are related from the [[first-person narrative|first-person]] perspective by Ellie Linton, a teenage girl, who is part of a small band of teenagers waging a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] war on the enemy soldiers in the region around their fictional home town of Wirrawee. The name of the series is derived from the title of the first book, ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began]]''.\n\nThe books in the series were originally published from 1993\u201399, by [[Pan Macmillan]] and have been reprinted sixteen times. A sequel series, ''The Ellie Chronicles'', was later published from 2003\u201306. The follow-up series concerns itself largely with the attempts of society and the protagonist to regain a normal level of functioning in the face of the psychological damage sustained during the war.\n\nIn the original series (1993\u201399) the identity of the invading force is never specified, which is most likely by explicit intent of the author. In the sequel series (2003\u201306) the invading force is specified as a coalition of highly populous South Asian nations, who see the vast underdeveloped spaces and natural resources of Australia as a way to tackle their [[human overpopulation]] problem, and the series features multinational colonies of enemy civilians being set up in conquered territory. Few parts of the war outside Ellie's immediate perspective are covered; the reader is not informed exactly how much of the country is under enemy control, though a radio broadcast early in the series confirms that several major costal cities, and much of the inland area has been seized by the invading forces. Furthermore, how well the war is going for the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian military]] is not covered, however, it's strongly inferred that they suffer heavy losses. \n\n''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' and its sequels are one of the most popular and critically acclaimed series of novels aimed at young readers in Australian literature history.<ref name=\"publishersweekly.com\">6 August 2008 [http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6341932.html Tomorrow Series Relaunched for Today's Readers] Publishersweekly.com</ref> It has sold over 3 million copies in Australia and has been translated into five languages.<ref name=\"publishersweekly.com\"/><ref name=\"sf\">[http://www.sfsite.com/12b/tom47.htm Bibliographer Researches Australian Children's Books] [http://www.nla.gov.au/ National Library of Australia] {{ISSN|1039-3498}}, no. 58, August 2002</ref>\n\n==Books==\n* ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[The Dead of the Night]]'' (1994)\n* ''The Third Day, the Frost'' (1995) <small> (published in the U.S. and Canada as ''A Killing Frost'')</small>\n* ''Darkness, Be My Friend'' (1996)\n* ''Burning for Revenge'' (1997)\n* ''The Night is for Hunting'' (1998)\n* ''The Other Side of Dawn'' (1999)\n\n==Plot summary==\nEllie goes out camping in [[the bush]] for a week with her friends Homer, Lee, Kevin, Corrie, Robyn, and Fiona. They find a way into a large, vegetated sinkhole in a remote area of bush the locals call \"Hell\", and camp there for the week. During this time they see large numbers of planes flying through the night without lights, and though it is mentioned in conversation the following morning, they think little of it.\n\nWhen they return home they find that all the people are missing and their pets and livestock are dead or dying. They come to realise that Australia has been invaded and their family and friends have been taken prisoner. Avoiding capture by enemy soldiers, as well as retrieving Robyn and Lee who were stuck in the town and picking up one of their school friends Chris, the group return to Hell. After short period of recovery they start making plans to fight back.\n\nOver the course of the first three books in the series, the group succeeds in destroying a bridge that leads into Wirrawee, an enemy convoy, several houses that are being used by the enemy as a center of operations, and a nearby strategic harbour. After the harbour raid, the surviving members of the group are eventually captured and placed in a maximum security prison in Stratton. During an air-raid by the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] the group escapes but loses yet another member while doing so. They encounter a downed RNZAF pilot and arrange to be evacuated to New Zealand.\n\nBook four, ''Darkness, Be My Friend'', takes place several months later. The group is trying to live a normal life in New Zealand with other refugees, but are haunted by their memories of the war (which is still ongoing). They are approached by the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], who are seeking Australian guerrillas to act as guides for saboteur units that are being dropped into occupied Australian territory. The group returns to Wirrawee, their hometown, accompanied by a platoon of New Zealand troops. However the New Zealanders go missing while on a mission to destroy Wirrawee Airfield (which is being used as a major military airbase). Alone behind enemy lines once more, the group decides to attack the Airfield themselves but a combination of poor planning and bad luck causes them to fail. They return, depressed, to Hell.\n\nSoon after, through sheer luck, the group find themselves perfectly positioned to attempt another attack on the Airfield. This time they succeed and manage to destroy a majority of planes on the airfield. After the attack, the group find their way to the nearby city of Stratton. There they encounter a tribe of feral (and hostile) children, who have been living on the streets and hiding from enemy troops since the war began. The group rescue five of the children who have been captured by an enemy patrol and escape back to Hell. For a time the group looks after the children. During this time strained relationships are mended and the soul-destroying effects of the war are tempered by a chance to do something positive. However, this period does not last. A patrol ambushes the group near their base and after defeating their attackers in a prolonged firefight the group realises that they are no longer safe in Hell and make contact with New Zealand immediately.\n\nThey discover that the war is entering its final days and that groups of [[partisan (military)|partisan]]s like themselves are being asked to cause as much chaos behind enemy lines as possible while New Zealand and its allies launch an all-out offensive. The group arranges for the feral children to be evacuated to New Zealand and are provided with [[plastic explosives]] to carry out their task.\n\nThe group attacks a service station frequented by enemy convoys and are separated in the aftermath. Ellie is shot in the leg and taken prisoner. While interned, she discovers the location of her mother and father. She escapes and is reunited with her mother whom she stays with until news breaks that the war is over \u2013 Australia signs a [[peace treaty]] with the occupying power, resulting in the formation of a new nation on the continent for the invading forces and settlers.\n\nIt transpires that Wirrawee is on the Australian side of the border. Ellie, her mother and her father return to their farm and, like all the other survivors of the war, begin picking up the pieces of their lives.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The group===\n;Ellie Linton: The main protagonist and narrator of the series. Ellie was born and raised on a cattle and sheep farm not far from the edge of the country town of Wirrawee. She is loyal to her friends, to her family, she loves the Australian bush and the life on the land. Ellie prides herself on being the strongest member (and therefore one of the leaders) of the group. Nevertheless, she is often scared and uncertain of her actions and tries to hide what she perceives to be these moments of weakness from her friends.\n\n;Corrie Mackenzie: Ellie's best friend since childhood. It was Corrie who first suggested going on a camping trip into Hell. Corrie was shot and mortally wounded at the end of the first book. Corrie's death affects the group deeply, especially Ellie who eventually comes to terms with the loss in book four, ''Darkness, Be My Friend''.\n\n;Homer Yannos: Ellie's neighbour and close friend. Homer is forceful and domineering and has trouble dealing with other strong personalities. Prior to the war Homer appeared to be a wild and irresponsible boy. The war reveals him to be a strong leader. However, on occasions where he is not in control Homer reverts to his immature ways. As the war progresses he gradually relies on Ellie to get the group to safety.\n\n;Fiona Maxwell: Commonly referred to as 'Fi' by the group, she had a sheltered upbringing before the war. Fi was shown early on to be the least physically capable of the group. Despite this Fi manages to find the courage within herself to complete the tasks she has been set, though she rarely takes an active role in planning the group's attacks. Fi becomes Ellie's confidante after Corrie's departure and acts as the most rational member of the group after Robyn. She develops a slow romance with the wild Homer.\n\n;Lee Takkam: Prior to the war Lee was a studious, somewhat lonely boy. During the war Lee demonstrates an aptitude for violence, a tendency to act impulsively and a strong desire for vengeance, especially after finding out his parents were killed. He develops a relationship with Ellie.\n\n;Robyn Mathers: A friend of Ellie and Corrie's with really strong held religious beliefs. Robyn is calm under pressure and is a capable leader. She regards herself as a [[pacifist]] and refuses to participate in any activities where she will be required to directly take a life. Despite this she is convinced that what the group is doing is right and enjoys the adrenaline rush that being in dangerous situations gives her. She eventually is killed in an act of heroism in book three, ''Third Day, The Frost'', where she blows herself up in order to kill Major Harvey once and for all.\n\n;Kevin Holmes: Corrie's boyfriend, Kevin fancies himself a tough guy but is shown to have difficulty handling high pressure situations. Kevin is separated from the group at the end of book one, ''Tomorrow, When the War Began''. When he is reunited with them again near the beginning of book three, ''Third Day, The Frost'', he is shocked to see how brutal the war has made his friends. His knowledge of explosives enables the group to successfully attack the Cobbler's Bay harbor.\n\n;Chris Lang: Prior to the war Chris was an introverted, but well liked boy. Chris was one of the few not taken prisoner when enemy forces seized Wirrawee. The group encounter him soon after returning from Hell and he decides to join with them. Although regarded as a genius by all of his friends, Chris is unable to apply that genius to the group's current situation. As the war wears on he withdraws more and more into his own head, into his world of illicit substances, depression and poetry.\n\n===Others===\n;Major Harvey:A former school deputy principal who was once in the [[Australian Army Reserve|Army Reserve]], Harvey is introduced as the leader of Harvey's Heroes, a group of adult partisans. It is later revealed that Harvey was working with the invaders and that the Harvey's Heroes organisation was established to deliver would-be resistance fighters into the hands of the invaders. As such he plays as a primary antagonist to the group.\n\n;Colonel Finley:An officer of the [[New Zealand Army]]'s [[New Zealand Intelligence Corps|Intelligence Corps]]. Finley supervised the group's recovery and well-being during their time in New Zealand, and later becomes their ''de facto'' commanding officer when the group returned to Wirrawee.\n\n;Gavin: A young deaf boy who was part of a gang of war orphans, led by a dictatorial boy called Aldo, living in Stratton since the war began. Of the children the group rescue, only Gavin had occupied a position amongst Aldo's inner circle. Being used to a position of power, Gavin immediately establishes himself as the leader of the children. He initially doesn't trust Ellie and her friends but soon comes to feel affection and respect for them.\n\n==Themes==\nIn his book ''John Marsden: Darkness, Shadow, and Light'' John Noell Moore, associate professor of English at [[The College of William & Mary]], identifies several significant themes of the series; the transition from innocence to experience; the power of the Australian landscape; understanding the past as a way of dealing with the present and preparing for the future; and writing and storytelling and how they shape identity.<ref name=DarkShadow>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=John Noell|title=John Marsden; Darkness, Shadow and Light|year=2010|publisher=Scarcrow Press|location=Blue Ridge Summit, PA, USA|isbn=9780810877436|pages=199}}</ref>\n\nThe transition from innocence to experience is shown in transformations in Ellie's thinking and her changing notions towards leadership and courage as the series progresses.<ref name=DarkShadow /> Ellie's reasons for chronicling her experiences also develop throughout the series. She starts out recording for the group who don't want to die unnoticed and forgotten and continues writing for herself to better understand her own thoughts and feelings. Later on she writes to recreate the past which has become a lost world to her and preserve the lessons that she has learnt from it.<ref name=DarkShadow /> The Australian bush becomes \"a symbol of stability in a world that seems to be disintegrating\". Its presence gives hope to the characters throughout the series.<ref name=DarkShadow />\n\nOther notable themes in the series are the role of family and friendship; sexual maturation and the conflicting worldviews of teenagers and adults.<ref name=DarkShadow />\n\n==Inspiration==\nJohn Marsden was inspired to write ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' while watching an [[ANZAC Day]] march.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  A large number of teenagers were in attendance, paying respect to the sacrifices made by the past generations. He wondered how they might react if they were placed in the same position that their grandparents were at their age. He felt that the popular media's view of the average young person as \"illiterate, drug crazed, suicidal, alcoholic, criminal, promiscuous, a dole [[wiktionary:bludger#Noun|bludger]], or all of the above\" was wrong.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=70}} It seemed to him that like the generations before them modern teenagers would \"dig deep and find reserves of initiative, maturity, responsibility and even heroism\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=70}}\n\nWith ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' and its sequels Marsden set out to write an \"old fashioned adventure story\". To do this Marsden looked to the authors he had read most avidly as a teenager, thriller writers such as [[Ian Fleming]], [[Desmond Bagley]], [[John Buchan]], [[Hammond Innes]] and [[Alistair MacLean]]. He sought to emulate their approaches to timing, pacing and building tension and suspense and combine them with \"the new teenage genres, where feelings, relationships and character development were all-important.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Wardle|first=Lisa|title=John Marsden \u2013 Author Interview Series|url=http://lisa-wardle.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/john-marsden-author-interview-series.html|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Marsden|first=John|title=Write of Passage|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/write-of-passage-20100820-138mu.html#ixzz21ERVL160|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe inspiration for the rural setting of the series was what Marsden saw as the disappearance of the bush tales that he had enjoyed growing up. He had noticed that many novels for young people published in recent decades were about issues arising for families and children living in the suburbs.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  In ''Marsden on Marsden'' he writes:\n\n:\"I\u2019ve written some of these novels myself, and I know and appreciate the need for them, but I thought it was a pity that we had gotten so far away from the bush and country novels that were popular in earlier generations, and I quite consciously set out to revive that genre.\"{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=74}}\n\nMarsden cites the works of Australian Children's Author [[Mary Grant Bruce]] as major influence on the series. In his introduction to the ''John Marsden Presents: Australian Children's Classics'' imprint of Bruce's 1940 novel ''Peter and Co'' Marsden notes the book's similarities to his series. Both are stories about groups of young people battling enemy forces intent on the invasion of Australia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant Bruce|first=Mary|title=Peter and Co (John Marsden Presents: Australian Children's Classics)|year=2001|publisher=Pan Australia}}</ref> Marsden states that while he didn't intentionally set out to emulate ''Peter and Co'' when he wrote ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' he does see many of his memories of the novel reflected in his work.\n\nEllie, the Tomorrow series central protagonist was modelled after the \"courageous and resourceful\" farm girl Norah from Mary Grant Bruce's Billabong series of novels.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=74}} The series follows the fortunes of the Linton family, the owners of a large cattle station in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], during first half of the 20th century. In the Tomorrow Series it is implied that Ellie is the great-granddaughter of Norah's brother Jim.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=100}} The character was also inspired by Charlotte Austin, a student who Marsden had taught and admired for her resourcefulness, honesty and \"gutsy approach to life\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=73}}\n\nThe character of Homer was based on a number of students from rural backgrounds that Marsden had taught. He noticed that many of these students, who at home drove cars, ploughed fields, harvested crops, worked as shearers and more, had trouble adjusting to an environment where they \"were not trusted to change a light globe or put a Band-Aid on a cut\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=76}} These students became frustrated and angry and their immature behaviour was the result.\n\nRobyn was modelled after Marsden's own sister, a deeply committed Christian. Marsden was inspired to write the character when he noticed that while many teenagers identified themselves as Christians this group was not represented at all in fiction written for them.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  Chris was an approximation of Marsden himself as a teen. Though unlike Chris, Marsden never used drugs.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}\n\nWhen asked why young people related to the characters in his books, Ellie in particular, Marsden speculated that, like himself, they found their strength and self-reliance inspirational.<ref name=RollerC>{{cite web|title=''Interviews, John Marsden'' |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rollercoaster/therap/interviews/s1532838.htm|work=Rollercoaster|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> In an interview with [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s Rollercoaster website he explained what inspired him to highlight these virtues in his work:\n\n:\"I've always been attracted to strong people in real life and in fiction. As a kid I read a lot of books like ''[[The Naked Island (book)|The Naked Island]]'' about [[Russell Braddon]] and his experiences on the [[Burma-Thai railway|Burma-Thai Railway]] and ''[[The Cattle King]]'', which is the biography of [[Sidney Kidman]], and they had a profound impact on me and I read those books many times. So I think the idea of people overcoming adversity by using their own resources was strongly imprinted in me by those books, because those guys had nothing except their own strength and their own mind power. There's something noble about that.\"<ref name=RollerC />\n\n==Similarities to other John Marsden novels==\n* In Marsden's 1988 novel ''The Journey'' the main character finds a hut belonging to a dead hermit. A similar sequence occurs in ''Tomorrow, When the War Began''.\n* In ''Out of Time'' (1990) the protagonist's country, implied to be Australia, is at war with an unspecified enemy. The protagonist has a sister called Ellie.\n* An Australia type nation is invaded in John Marsden and [[Shaun Tan|Shaun Tan's]] picture book ''The Rabbits'' (1998)\n* ''Home and Away'' (2008), a picture book by John Marsden and Matt Ottley, tells the story of a family fleeing from a war-torn Australia. Their story is similar to the story of how Lee's mother came to Australia as a refugee.\n\n==Reception==\nUpon publication, the series was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews. Critics praised the series for its insightful look at a wide range of issues and suspense filled narrative. ''[[The Age]]'' proclaimed the series \"the best series for Australian teens of all time...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tomorrow-series.eu/en/books/07-the-other-side-of-dawn|title=The Tomorrow Series \u2013 Your source for everything about John Marsden's series, Tomorrow, When the War Began and the upcoming Tomorrow movies.

(2003), ''Incurable'' (2005), and ''Circle of Flight'' (2006).

Ellie finds herself running the family farm after the murder of her parents, and dealing with Gavin, the deaf boy she rescued during the war. Shortly after the death of her parents, Ellie faces bankruptcy and turns to Homer's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Yannos, for help.

The novels are related from the [[first-person narrative|first-person]] perspective by Ellie Linton, a teenage girl, who is part of a small band of teenagers waging a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] war on the enemy soldiers in the region around their fictional home town of Wirrawee. The name of the series is derived from the title of the first book, ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began]]''.\n\nThe books in the series were originally published from 1993\u201399, by [[Pan Macmillan]] and have been reprinted sixteen times. A sequel series, ''The Ellie Chronicles'', was later published from 2003\u201306. The follow-up series concerns itself largely with the attempts of society and the protagonist to regain a normal level of functioning in the face of the psychological damage sustained during the war.\n\nIn the original series (1993\u201399) the identity of the invading force is never specified, which is most likely by explicit intent of the author. In the sequel series (2003\u201306) the invading force is specified as a coalition of highly populous South Asian nations, who see the vast underdeveloped spaces and natural resources of Australia as a way to tackle their [[human overpopulation]] problem, and the series features multinational colonies of enemy civilians being set up in conquered territory. Few parts of the war outside Ellie's immediate perspective are covered; the reader is not informed exactly how much of the country is under enemy control, though a radio broadcast early in the series confirms that several major costal cities, and much of the inland area has been seized by the invading forces. Furthermore, how well the war is going for the [[Australian Defence Force|Australian military]] is not covered, however, it's strongly inferred that they suffer heavy losses. \n\n''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' and its sequels are one of the most popular and critically acclaimed series of novels aimed at young readers in Australian literature history.<ref name=\"publishersweekly.com\">6 August 2008 [http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6341932.html Tomorrow Series Relaunched for Today's Readers] Publishersweekly.com</ref> It has sold over 3 million copies in Australia and has been translated into five languages.<ref name=\"publishersweekly.com\"/><ref name=\"sf\">[http://www.sfsite.com/12b/tom47.htm Bibliographer Researches Australian Children's Books] [http://www.nla.gov.au/ National Library of Australia] {{ISSN|1039-3498}}, no. 58, August 2002</ref>\n\n==Books==\n* ''[[Tomorrow, When the War Began]]'' (1993)\n* ''[[The Dead of the Night]]'' (1994)\n* ''The Third Day, the Frost'' (1995) <small> (published in the U.S. and Canada as ''A Killing Frost'')</small>\n* ''Darkness, Be My Friend'' (1996)\n* ''Burning for Revenge'' (1997)\n* ''The Night is for Hunting'' (1998)\n* ''The Other Side of Dawn'' (1999)\n\n==Plot summary==\nEllie goes out camping in [[the bush]] for a week with her friends Homer, Lee, Kevin, Corrie, Robyn, and Fiona. They find a way into a large, vegetated sinkhole in a remote area of bush the locals call \"Hell\", and camp there for the week. During this time they see large numbers of planes flying through the night without lights, and though it is mentioned in conversation the following morning, they think little of it.\n\nWhen they return home they find that all the people are missing and their pets and livestock are dead or dying. They come to realise that Australia has been invaded and their family and friends have been taken prisoner. Avoiding capture by enemy soldiers, as well as retrieving Robyn and Lee who were stuck in the town and picking up one of their school friends Chris, the group return to Hell. After short period of recovery they start making plans to fight back.\n\nOver the course of the first three books in the series, the group succeeds in destroying a bridge that leads into Wirrawee, an enemy convoy, several houses that are being used by the enemy as a center of operations, and a nearby strategic harbour. After the harbour raid, the surviving members of the group are eventually captured and placed in a maximum security prison in Stratton. During an air-raid by the [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] the group escapes but loses yet another member while doing so. They encounter a downed RNZAF pilot and arrange to be evacuated to New Zealand.\n\nBook four, ''Darkness, Be My Friend'', takes place several months later. The group is trying to live a normal life in New Zealand with other refugees, but are haunted by their memories of the war (which is still ongoing). They are approached by the [[New Zealand Defence Force]], who are seeking Australian guerrillas to act as guides for saboteur units that are being dropped into occupied Australian territory. The group returns to Wirrawee, their hometown, accompanied by a platoon of New Zealand troops. However the New Zealanders go missing while on a mission to destroy Wirrawee Airfield (which is being used as a major military airbase). Alone behind enemy lines once more, the group decides to attack the Airfield themselves but a combination of poor planning and bad luck causes them to fail. They return, depressed, to Hell.\n\nSoon after, through sheer luck, the group find themselves perfectly positioned to attempt another attack on the Airfield. This time they succeed and manage to destroy a majority of planes on the airfield. After the attack, the group find their way to the nearby city of Stratton. There they encounter a tribe of feral (and hostile) children, who have been living on the streets and hiding from enemy troops since the war began. The group rescue five of the children who have been captured by an enemy patrol and escape back to Hell. For a time the group looks after the children. During this time strained relationships are mended and the soul-destroying effects of the war are tempered by a chance to do something positive. However, this period does not last. A patrol ambushes the group near their base and after defeating their attackers in a prolonged firefight the group realises that they are no longer safe in Hell and make contact with New Zealand immediately.\n\nThey discover that the war is entering its final days and that groups of [[partisan (military)|partisan]]s like themselves are being asked to cause as much chaos behind enemy lines as possible while New Zealand and its allies launch an all-out offensive. The group arranges for the feral children to be evacuated to New Zealand and are provided with [[plastic explosives]] to carry out their task.\n\nThe group attacks a service station frequented by enemy convoys and are separated in the aftermath. Ellie is shot in the leg and taken prisoner. While interned, she discovers the location of her mother and father. She escapes and is reunited with her mother whom she stays with until news breaks that the war is over \u2013 Australia signs a [[peace treaty]] with the occupying power, resulting in the formation of a new nation on the continent for the invading forces and settlers.\n\nIt transpires that Wirrawee is on the Australian side of the border. Ellie, her mother and her father return to their farm and, like all the other survivors of the war, begin picking up the pieces of their lives.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===The group===\n;Ellie Linton: The main protagonist and narrator of the series. Ellie was born and raised on a cattle and sheep farm not far from the edge of the country town of Wirrawee. She is loyal to her friends, to her family, she loves the Australian bush and the life on the land. Ellie prides herself on being the strongest member (and therefore one of the leaders) of the group. Nevertheless, she is often scared and uncertain of her actions and tries to hide what she perceives to be these moments of weakness from her friends.\n\n;Corrie Mackenzie: Ellie's best friend since childhood. It was Corrie who first suggested going on a camping trip into Hell. Corrie was shot and mortally wounded at the end of the first book. Corrie's death affects the group deeply, especially Ellie who eventually comes to terms with the loss in book four, ''Darkness, Be My Friend''.\n\n;Homer Yannos: Ellie's neighbour and close friend. Homer is forceful and domineering and has trouble dealing with other strong personalities. Prior to the war Homer appeared to be a wild and irresponsible boy. The war reveals him to be a strong leader. However, on occasions where he is not in control Homer reverts to his immature ways. As the war progresses he gradually relies on Ellie to get the group to safety.\n\n;Fiona Maxwell: Commonly referred to as 'Fi' by the group, she had a sheltered upbringing before the war. Fi was shown early on to be the least physically capable of the group. Despite this Fi manages to find the courage within herself to complete the tasks she has been set, though she rarely takes an active role in planning the group's attacks. Fi becomes Ellie's confidante after Corrie's departure and acts as the most rational member of the group after Robyn. She develops a slow romance with the wild Homer.\n\n;Lee Takkam: Prior to the war Lee was a studious, somewhat lonely boy. During the war Lee demonstrates an aptitude for violence, a tendency to act impulsively and a strong desire for vengeance, especially after finding out his parents were killed. He develops a relationship with Ellie.\n\n;Robyn Mathers: A friend of Ellie and Corrie's with really strong held religious beliefs. Robyn is calm under pressure and is a capable leader. She regards herself as a [[pacifist]] and refuses to participate in any activities where she will be required to directly take a life. Despite this she is convinced that what the group is doing is right and enjoys the adrenaline rush that being in dangerous situations gives her. She eventually is killed in an act of heroism in book three, ''Third Day, The Frost'', where she blows herself up in order to kill Major Harvey once and for all.\n\n;Kevin Holmes: Corrie's boyfriend, Kevin fancies himself a tough guy but is shown to have difficulty handling high pressure situations. Kevin is separated from the group at the end of book one, ''Tomorrow, When the War Began''. When he is reunited with them again near the beginning of book three, ''Third Day, The Frost'', he is shocked to see how brutal the war has made his friends. His knowledge of explosives enables the group to successfully attack the Cobbler's Bay harbor.\n\n;Chris Lang: Prior to the war Chris was an introverted, but well liked boy. Chris was one of the few not taken prisoner when enemy forces seized Wirrawee. The group encounter him soon after returning from Hell and he decides to join with them. Although regarded as a genius by all of his friends, Chris is unable to apply that genius to the group's current situation. As the war wears on he withdraws more and more into his own head, into his world of illicit substances, depression and poetry.\n\n===Others===\n;Major Harvey:A former school deputy principal who was once in the [[Australian Army Reserve|Army Reserve]], Harvey is introduced as the leader of Harvey's Heroes, a group of adult partisans. It is later revealed that Harvey was working with the invaders and that the Harvey's Heroes organisation was established to deliver would-be resistance fighters into the hands of the invaders. As such he plays as a primary antagonist to the group.\n\n;Colonel Finley:An officer of the [[New Zealand Army]]'s [[New Zealand Intelligence Corps|Intelligence Corps]]. Finley supervised the group's recovery and well-being during their time in New Zealand, and later becomes their ''de facto'' commanding officer when the group returned to Wirrawee.\n\n;Gavin: A young deaf boy who was part of a gang of war orphans, led by a dictatorial boy called Aldo, living in Stratton since the war began. Of the children the group rescue, only Gavin had occupied a position amongst Aldo's inner circle. Being used to a position of power, Gavin immediately establishes himself as the leader of the children. He initially doesn't trust Ellie and her friends but soon comes to feel affection and respect for them.\n\n==Themes==\nIn his book ''John Marsden: Darkness, Shadow, and Light'' John Noell Moore, associate professor of English at [[The College of William & Mary]], identifies several significant themes of the series; the transition from innocence to experience; the power of the Australian landscape; understanding the past as a way of dealing with the present and preparing for the future; and writing and storytelling and how they shape identity.<ref name=DarkShadow>{{cite book|last=Moore|first=John Noell|title=John Marsden; Darkness, Shadow and Light|year=2010|publisher=Scarcrow Press|location=Blue Ridge Summit, PA, USA|isbn=9780810877436|pages=199}}</ref>\n\nThe transition from innocence to experience is shown in transformations in Ellie's thinking and her changing notions towards leadership and courage as the series progresses.<ref name=DarkShadow /> Ellie's reasons for chronicling her experiences also develop throughout the series. She starts out recording for the group who don't want to die unnoticed and forgotten and continues writing for herself to better understand her own thoughts and feelings. Later on she writes to recreate the past which has become a lost world to her and preserve the lessons that she has learnt from it.<ref name=DarkShadow /> The Australian bush becomes \"a symbol of stability in a world that seems to be disintegrating\". Its presence gives hope to the characters throughout the series.<ref name=DarkShadow />\n\nOther notable themes in the series are the role of family and friendship; sexual maturation and the conflicting worldviews of teenagers and adults.<ref name=DarkShadow />\n\n==Inspiration==\nJohn Marsden was inspired to write ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' while watching an [[ANZAC Day]] march.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  A large number of teenagers were in attendance, paying respect to the sacrifices made by the past generations. He wondered how they might react if they were placed in the same position that their grandparents were at their age. He felt that the popular media's view of the average young person as \"illiterate, drug crazed, suicidal, alcoholic, criminal, promiscuous, a dole [[wiktionary:bludger#Noun|bludger]], or all of the above\" was wrong.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=70}} It seemed to him that like the generations before them modern teenagers would \"dig deep and find reserves of initiative, maturity, responsibility and even heroism\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=70}}\n\nWith ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' and its sequels Marsden set out to write an \"old fashioned adventure story\". To do this Marsden looked to the authors he had read most avidly as a teenager, thriller writers such as [[Ian Fleming]], [[Desmond Bagley]], [[John Buchan]], [[Hammond Innes]] and [[Alistair MacLean]]. He sought to emulate their approaches to timing, pacing and building tension and suspense and combine them with \"the new teenage genres, where feelings, relationships and character development were all-important.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Wardle|first=Lisa|title=John Marsden \u2013 Author Interview Series|url=http://lisa-wardle.blogspot.com.au/2011/06/john-marsden-author-interview-series.html|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Marsden|first=John|title=Write of Passage|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/movies/write-of-passage-20100820-138mu.html#ixzz21ERVL160|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=22 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe inspiration for the rural setting of the series was what Marsden saw as the disappearance of the bush tales that he had enjoyed growing up. He had noticed that many novels for young people published in recent decades were about issues arising for families and children living in the suburbs.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  In ''Marsden on Marsden'' he writes:\n\n:\"I\u2019ve written some of these novels myself, and I know and appreciate the need for them, but I thought it was a pity that we had gotten so far away from the bush and country novels that were popular in earlier generations, and I quite consciously set out to revive that genre.\"{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=74}}\n\nMarsden cites the works of Australian Children's Author [[Mary Grant Bruce]] as major influence on the series. In his introduction to the ''John Marsden Presents: Australian Children's Classics'' imprint of Bruce's 1940 novel ''Peter and Co'' Marsden notes the book's similarities to his series. Both are stories about groups of young people battling enemy forces intent on the invasion of Australia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Grant Bruce|first=Mary|title=Peter and Co (John Marsden Presents: Australian Children's Classics)|year=2001|publisher=Pan Australia}}</ref> Marsden states that while he didn't intentionally set out to emulate ''Peter and Co'' when he wrote ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'' he does see many of his memories of the novel reflected in his work.\n\nEllie, the Tomorrow series central protagonist was modelled after the \"courageous and resourceful\" farm girl Norah from Mary Grant Bruce's Billabong series of novels.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=74}} The series follows the fortunes of the Linton family, the owners of a large cattle station in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], during first half of the 20th century. In the Tomorrow Series it is implied that Ellie is the great-granddaughter of Norah's brother Jim.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=100}} The character was also inspired by Charlotte Austin, a student who Marsden had taught and admired for her resourcefulness, honesty and \"gutsy approach to life\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=73}}\n\nThe character of Homer was based on a number of students from rural backgrounds that Marsden had taught. He noticed that many of these students, who at home drove cars, ploughed fields, harvested crops, worked as shearers and more, had trouble adjusting to an environment where they \"were not trusted to change a light globe or put a Band-Aid on a cut\".{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=76}} These students became frustrated and angry and their immature behaviour was the result.\n\nRobyn was modelled after Marsden's own sister, a deeply committed Christian. Marsden was inspired to write the character when he noticed that while many teenagers identified themselves as Christians this group was not represented at all in fiction written for them.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}  Chris was an approximation of Marsden himself as a teen. Though unlike Chris, Marsden never used drugs.{{sfn|Marsden|2000|p=}}\n\nWhen asked why young people related to the characters in his books, Ellie in particular, Marsden speculated that, like himself, they found their strength and self-reliance inspirational.<ref name=RollerC>{{cite web|title=''Interviews, John Marsden'' |url=http://www.abc.net.au/rollercoaster/therap/interviews/s1532838.htm|work=Rollercoaster|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> In an interview with [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s Rollercoaster website he explained what inspired him to highlight these virtues in his work:\n\n:\"I've always been attracted to strong people in real life and in fiction. As a kid I read a lot of books like ''[[The Naked Island (book)|The Naked Island]]'' about [[Russell Braddon]] and his experiences on the [[Burma-Thai railway|Burma-Thai Railway]] and ''[[The Cattle King]]'', which is the biography of [[Sidney Kidman]], and they had a profound impact on me and I read those books many times. So I think the idea of people overcoming adversity by using their own resources was strongly imprinted in me by those books, because those guys had nothing except their own strength and their own mind power. There's something noble about that.\"<ref name=RollerC />\n\n==Similarities to other John Marsden novels==\n* In Marsden's 1988 novel ''The Journey'' the main character finds a hut belonging to a dead hermit. A similar sequence occurs in ''Tomorrow, When the War Began''.\n* In ''Out of Time'' (1990) the protagonist's country, implied to be Australia, is at war with an unspecified enemy. The protagonist has a sister called Ellie.\n* An Australia type nation is invaded in John Marsden and [[Shaun Tan|Shaun Tan's]] picture book ''The Rabbits'' (1998)\n* ''Home and Away'' (2008), a picture book by John Marsden and Matt Ottley, tells the story of a family fleeing from a war-torn Australia. Their story is similar to the story of how Lee's mother came to Australia as a refugee.\n\n==Reception==\nUpon publication, the series was met with overwhelmingly positive reviews. Critics praised the series for its insightful look at a wide range of issues and suspense filled narrative.

(2003), ''Incurable'' (2005), and ''Circle of Flight'' (2006). The three books detail Ellie's struggles in post-war life in Wirrawee. Ellie finds herself running the family farm after the murder of her parents, and dealing with Gavin, the deaf boy she rescued during the war. Shortly after the death of her parents, Ellie faces bankruptcy and turns to Homer's parents, Mr. and Mrs. Yannos, for help. In addition, a group called \"Liberation\", headed by the mysterious \"Scarlet Pimple\" (a play of words on \"[[The Scarlet Pimpernel]]\"), are conducting secret border raids against the new nation.\n\n==Adaptations==\n===Film===\n{{Main|Tomorrow, When the War Began (film)}}\nIn June 2009, [[Screen Australia]] announced that it would fund the development of the feature film ''Tomorrow, When the War Began'', written and directed by screenwriter [[Stuart Beattie]] (''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]], [[Collateral (film)|Collateral]], [[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]''), and produced by Andrew Mason for Ambience Entertainment, reportedly to begin production in late 2009.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=840471|title=John Marsden book to be made into film|work=[[Nine News]]|date=22 July 2009|accessdate=28 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912012709/http://news.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=840471|archivedate=12 September 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3iecfa450e38f03b772d4e458e999c8f5c |title=Stuart Beattie looks to 'Tomorrow' |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=15 June 2009 |accessdate=28 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619081417/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3iecfa450e38f03b772d4e458e999c8f5c |archivedate=19 June 2009 }}</ref><ref name=screenaustralia>{{Cite news|url=http://www.screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2009/mr_090616_approvals.asp|title=Screen Australia announces funding for five features including ''Wog Boy 2: Kings of Mykonos'' and ''Tomorrow When the War Began''|work=[[Screen Australia]]|date=16 June 2009|accessdate=28 October 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028193357/http://screenaustralia.gov.au/news_and_events/2009/mr_090616_approvals.asp|archivedate=28 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Raymond Terrace]] in the [[Hunter Region]] of [[New South Wales]], was chosen as a major location for producing the film.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.portstephensexaminer.com.au/news/local/news/general/terrace-on-centre-stage/1618590.aspx|title=Terrace on centre stage|work=Port Stephens Examiner|date=9 September 2009|accessdate=16 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013115504/http://www.portstephensexaminer.com.au/news/local/news/general/terrace-on-centre-stage/1618590.aspx|archive-date=13 October 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The film was released in Australian cinemas on 2 September 2010.
