As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual.

They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title.

Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software. The individual episode title cards used a \"fly through\" approach, similar to the film ''[[Bullitt]]'', which the producers had suggested to the studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/stranger-things/ |title=Stranger Things (2016) |first=Will |last=Perkins |date=August 9, 2016 |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |website=[[Art of the Title]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Stranger Things}}\nThe ''Stranger Things'' original soundtrack was composed by Michael Stein and Kyle Dixon of the electronic band [[Survive (band)|Survive]].<!-- based on wp guidelines, do not change to S U R V I V E --><ref name=\"billboard music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7488050/survive-stranger-things-soundtrack-interview |title=''Stranger Things'' Co-Composer Shares the Story Behind 2016's Most Unlikely Musical Sensation |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |date=August 29, 2016 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref> It makes extensive use of [[synthesizer]]s in homage to 1980s artists and film composers including [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Vangelis]], [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], and [[Fabio Frizzi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/08/06/stranger-things-playlist/ |title=Stranger Things: 10 eerie electronic gems to hear if you loved the Netflix show |website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music. |accessdate=September 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Stein and Dixon, the Duffer Brothers had been fans of Survive's music, and used their song \"Dirge\" for the mock trailer that was used to sell the series to Netflix.<ref name=\"billboard music\" /><ref name=\"rs music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/stranger-things-survive-talk-their-creepy-nostalgic-score-w431789 |title='Stranger Things': Meet the Band Behind Show's Creepy, Nostalgic Score |first=Christopher |last=Weingarten |date=August 1, 2016 |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |website=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> The Duffer Brothers discovered the band through the 2014 film ''[[The Guest (2014 American film)|The Guest]]'', where Survive features on the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gruttadaro |first1=Andrew |title=How the Duffer Brothers Picked the Perfect Music for 'Stranger Things' |url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/08/stranger-things-music-duffer-brothers-interview |accessdate=October 21, 2018 |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |date=August 2, 2018}}</ref> Once the series was green-lit, the Duffer Brothers contacted Survive around July 2015 to ask if they were still doing music;

Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities. The series stars an ensemble cast including [[Winona Ryder]], [[David Harbour]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Millie Bobby Brown]], [[Gaten Matarazzo]], [[Caleb McLaughlin]], [[Noah Schnapp]], [[Natalia Dyer]], [[Charlie Heaton]], [[Joe Keery]] and [[Cara Buono]].\n\nThe [[The Duffer Brothers|Duffer Brothers]] developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside [[supernatural]] elements portrayed with horror, science fiction and childlike sensibilities. Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]].

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual.

Eight episodes allowed them to give time to characterization in addition to narrative development; if they had less time available, they would have had to remain committed to telling a horror film as soon as the monster was introduced and abandon the characterization.<ref name=\"nytimes interview\" /> Within the eight episodes, the brothers aimed to make the first season \"feel like a big movie\" with all the major plot lines completed so that \"the audience feels satisfied\", but left enough unresolved to indicate \"there's a bigger mythology, and there's a lot of dangling threads at the end\", something that could be explored in further seasons if Netflix opted to create more.<ref name=\"variety maybes2\">{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/stranger-things-season-two-netflix-1201824880/ |title='Stranger Things' EPs on Season 2: 'We Could Explore It If Netflix Wanted To' |first=Debra |last=Brinbaum |date=July 27, 2016 |accessdate=February 14, 2017 |website=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref>\n\nRegarding writing for the children characters of the series, the Duffer Brothers considered themselves as outcasts from other students while in high school and thus found it easy to write for Mike and his friends, and particularly for Barb.<ref name=\"daily beast\" /> Joyce was fashioned after [[Richard Dreyfuss]]' character Roy Neary in ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'', as she appears \"absolutely bonkers\" to everyone else as she tries to find Will.<ref name=\"empire\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[File:David Harbour by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Duffer Brothers cast [[David Harbour]] as Chief Hopper believing this was his opportunity to portray a lead character.]]\nIn June 2015, it was announced that [[Winona Ryder]] and [[David Harbour]] had joined the series as Joyce and as the unnamed chief of police, respectively.<ref name=\"June2015TVL\" /> The brothers' casting director Carmen Cuba had suggested Ryder for the role of Joyce, which the two were immediately drawn to because of her predominance in the films of the 1980s.<ref name=\"rs\" /> Levy believed Ryder could \"wretch up the emotional urgency and yet find layers and nuance and different sides of [Joyce]\".

violent or gory, following in line with how the 1980s [[Amblin Entertainment]] films drove the creation of the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system#Addition of PG-13 rating|PG-13 movie rating]]. It was \"much more about mood and atmosphere and suspense and dread than they are about gore\", though they were not afraid to push into more scary elements, particularly towards the end of the first season.<ref name=\"empire\" /> The brothers had wanted to avoid any [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated effects]] for the monster and other parts of the series and stay with [[practical effect]]s, so they created an animatronic to play the part of the demogorgon.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/film-tv/g13305063/stranger-things-trivia/?slide=24 |title=50 Things You Didn't Know About 'Stranger Things' |date=November 6, 2017 |work=Harper's BAZAAR |access-date = April 23, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://ew.com/tv/2016/07/20/stranger-things-duffer-brothers-episode-6/ |title='Stranger Things': How the Duffer Brothers created their monster |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |access-date = April 23, 2018}}</ref> However, the six-month filming time left them little time to plan out and test practical effects rigs for some of the shots. They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title. The sequence was created by the studio Imaginary Forces, formerly part of [[R/GA]], led by creative director Michelle Doughtey.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/08/stranger-things-titles-came-perfectly-retro/ |title=How the Stranger Things Titles Came Out So Perfectly Retro |first=Sean Patrick |last=Ferrell |date=August 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 11, 2017 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref> Levy introduced the studio to the Duffer Brothers, who explained their vision of the 1980s-inspired series, which helped the studio to fix the concept the producers wanted. Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software. The individual episode title cards used a \"fly through\" approach, similar to the film ''[[Bullitt]]'', which the producers had suggested to the studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/stranger-things/ |title=Stranger Things (2016) |first=Will |last=Perkins |date=August 9, 2016 |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |website=[[Art of the Title]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Stranger Things}}\nThe ''Stranger Things'' original soundtrack was composed by Michael Stein and Kyle Dixon of the electronic band [[Survive (band)|Survive]].<!-- based on wp guidelines, do not change to S U R V I V E --><ref name=\"billboard music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7488050/survive-stranger-things-soundtrack-interview |title=''Stranger Things'' Co-Composer Shares the Story Behind 2016's Most Unlikely Musical Sensation |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |date=August 29, 2016 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref> It makes extensive use of [[synthesizer]]s in homage to 1980s artists and film composers including [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Vangelis]], [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], and [[Fabio Frizzi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/08/06/stranger-things-playlist/ |title=Stranger Things: 10 eerie electronic gems to hear if you loved the Netflix show |website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music. |accessdate=September 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Stein and Dixon, the Duffer Brothers had been fans of Survive's music, and used their song \"Dirge\" for the mock trailer that was used to sell the series to Netflix.<ref name=\"billboard music\" /><ref name=\"rs music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/stranger-things-survive-talk-their-creepy-nostalgic-score-w431789 |title='Stranger Things': Meet the Band Behind Show's Creepy, Nostalgic Score |first=Christopher |last=Weingarten |date=August 1, 2016 |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |website=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> The Duffer Brothers discovered the band through the 2014 film ''[[The Guest (film)|The Guest]]'', where Survive features on the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gruttadaro |first1=Andrew |title=How the Duffer Brothers Picked the Perfect Music for 'Stranger Things' |url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/08/stranger-things-music-duffer-brothers-interview |accessdate=October 21, 2018 |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |date=August 2, 2018}}</ref> Once the series was green-lit, the Duffer Brothers contacted Survive around July 2015 to ask if they were still doing music;

The map of Hawkins in the game was based on a Google street view map of Jackson, Georgia where the series is filmed. In order to help keep the game a secret, BonusXP did not hire game testers for their [[quality assurance]], instead having family members from the design team provide feedback; this process helped create the two difficulty levels in the game.<ref name=\"GameDallasObserver\" /> Completing the game gives players a clip from the first episode of the second season of the series.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/beating-the-stranger-things-game-reveals-this-neve/1100-6453794/ |title=Beating The Stranger Things Game Reveals This Never-Before-Seen Clip From Season 2 |first=Eddie |last=Makuch |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[GameSpot]]}}</ref> The game was downloaded 3{{nbsp}}million times in the first week, becoming a top download and receiving critical praise.

{"title_page": "General Maritime Treaty of 1820", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2018}}\n{{History of the United Arab Emirates}}\n\nThe '''General Maritime Treaty of 1820''' was a treaty initially signed between the rulers of [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]], [[Ajman]], [[Umm al-Quwain]] and [[Ras Al Khaimah]] and the [[British Empire|British]] in January 1820, with the nearby island state of [[Bahrain]] acceding to the treaty in the following February. Its full title was, \"General Treaty for the Cessation of Plunder and Piracy by Land and Sea, Dated February 5, 1820\".\n\nThe treaty followed the fall of Ras Al Khaimah, [[Rams (Ras Al Khaimah)|Rams]] and [[Dhayah Fort|Dhayah]] to a [[Persian Gulf campaign of 1819|punitive British expedition]] mounted from [[Mumbai|Bombay]] in 1819, principally targeting the fleet of the troublesome [[Al-Qasimi|Al Qasimi]], a seafaring tribe who had committed 'piracy and plunder' according to the British. Ras Al Khaimah fell to the force on 9 December 1819, with Dhayah falling on 22 December.\n[[File:Dhayah Fort showing hilltop location.jpg|thumb|[[Dhayah Fort]] today.]]\nThe British expeditionary force then blew up the town of Ras Al Khaimah and established a garrison there of 800 sepoys and artillery, before visiting [[Al Jazirah Al Hamra|Jazirat Al Hamra]], which was found to be deserted. They went on to destroy the fortifications and larger vessels of [[Umm Al Quwain|Umm Al Qawain]], [[Ajman]], [[Al Heera|Fasht]], [[Sharjah]], [[Abu Hail]], and [[Dubai]]. Ten vessels that had taken shelter in Bahrain were also destroyed.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=669}}</ref> The Royal Navy suffered no casualties during the action.<ref name=\"United\">''United service magazine'' Part 1, pp. 711\u201315.</ref>\n\nWith the Sheikhs of these communities either in captivity or choosing to give themselves up, a treaty was proposed in order to govern peaceful relationships in the future. The treaty opens, 'In the name of God, the merciful, the compassionate! Praise be to God, who hath ordained peace to be a blessing to his creatures.'\n\nUnder the auspices of the UK's representative [[William Grant (British Army officer)|Sir William Keir Grant]], the treaty prohibited [[piracy in the Persian Gulf]], banned [[slavery]] and required all usable ships to be registered with British forces by flying distinctive red and white flags which exist today as the flags of the respective emirates.<ref name=\"Commins\">{{cite book|last=Commins|first=David|title=The Gulf States: A Modern History|year=2012|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781848852785|pages=74, 78|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hxaKj3AjyfwC&pg=PA78 }}</ref>\n\nThe treaty was part of the UK's strategic policy of ensuring an open lines of communication between the [[British Raj]] and the United Kingdom, by excluding rival European powers from the Persian Gulf region, notably the [[Russian empire]] and [[France]]. Britain also sought to pacify the Persian Gulf by preserving the independence of [[Iran under Qajar dynasty|Qajar Iran]], the [[Ottoman empire]] and the [[Second Saudi State]].<ref name=\"Commins\" />\n\n== Preliminary agreements ==\nMany of the Sheikhs signatory to the 1820 treaty had made prior agreements with the British. The Ruler of Ras Al Khaimah ceded the town itself and the area of Maharah to the British for use as a garrison, and most other coastal Sheikhs ceded boats and armaments in return for an undertaking that the British would not enter or lay waste their towns. Ajman, Umm Al Qawain and Sharjah all came under one preliminary agreement signed with Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr, while others were undertaken with the Rulers of Dubai, Abu Dhabi, and Khatt and Falayah. Like the 1820 treaty itself, this last preliminary agreement was signed by [[Hassan bin Rahma Al Qasimi]], formerly Sheikh of Ras Al Khaimah.\n\n== Agreements ==\nThe first article of the treaty asserts: \"There shall be a cessation of plunder and piracy by land and sea on the part of the Arabs, who are parties to this contract, for ever.\" It then goes on to define piracy as being any attack that is not an action of \"acknowledged war\". The \"pacificated Arabs\" agree, on land and sea, to carry a flag being a red rectangle contained within a white border of equal width to the contained rectangle, \"with or without letters on it, at their option\". This flag was to be a symbol of peace with the British government and each other.\n\nThe vessels of the \"friendly Arabs\" were to carry a paper (register), signed by their chief and detailing the vessel. They should also carry a documented port clearance, which would name the \"Nacodah\" (today generally spelled ''[[nakhuda]]''), crew and number of armed men on board as well as the port of origin and destination. They would produce these on request to any British or other vessel which requested them.\n\nThe treaty also makes provision for the exchange of envoys, for the \"friendly Arabs\" to act in concert against outside forces and to desist from putting people to death after they have given up their arms or to carry them off as slaves. The treaty prohibits slaving \"from the coasts of Africa or elsewhere\" or the carrying of slaves in their vessels. The \"friendly Arabs\", flying the agreed flag, would be free to enter, leave and trade with British ports and \"if any should attack them, the British Government will take notice of it.\"<ref>\"General Treaty for the Cessation of Plunder and Piracy by Land and Sea\", 5 February 1820</ref>\n\n== Signatories ==\n[[File:Al Falayah Fort.jpg|thumb|[[Al Falayah Fort]]]]\nThe treaty was issued in triplicate and signed at mid-day on 8 January 1820 in [[Ras Al Khaimah]] by Major-General Keir Grant together with Hassan bin Rahma, Sheikh of 'Hatt and Falna' ('Hatt' being the modern day village of [[Khatt]] and 'Falna' being the modern day suburb of Ras Al Khaimah, [[Al Fahlain|Fahlain]] near the location of [[Al Falayah Fort]]) and Rajib bin Ahmed [[Al-Zaabi]], Sheikh of 'Jourat al Kamra' ([[Al Jazirah Al Hamra|Jazirah Al Hamra]]). A translation was prepared by Captain JP Thompson.\n\nThe treaty was then signed on 11 January 1820 in Ras Al Khaimah by Sheikh Shakbout of 'Aboo Dhebbee' (Abu Dhabi) and on 15 January by Hassan bin Ali, Sheikh of Rams and [[Dhayah Fort|Al Dhaya]] (named on the treaty document as 'Sheikh of 'Zyah').\n\nThe treaty was subsequently signed in Sharjah by Saeed bin Saif of Dubai (on behalf of Mohammed bin Haza bin Zaal, the Sheikh of Dubai was in his minority) on 28 January 1820 and then in Sharjah again by [[Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi|Sultan bin Suggur]], Sheikh of Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah (at Falayah Fort) on 4 February 1820. On 15 March 1820 [[Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuami|Rashid bin Humaid]], Sheikh of Ajman and [[Abdullah bin Rashid Al Mualla|Abdullah bin Rashid]], Sheikh of Umm Al Qawain both signed at Falayah.\n\nAs seen above, the treaty bears some quaint spellings of the names of the signatories ('Abdoola bin Rashid'), the dates ('the month of Rubee-oos-Sanee') and the territories ('Aboo Dhebbee', Shargah, Ejman and Umm ool Keiweyn'). Nevertheless, it was to lead to the recognition by the [[British Empire|British]] of the [[Trucial States]] and to a series of further treaties formalising the British Protectorate over the UAE and eventually to the process leading to the formation of the modern United Arab Emirates on 2 December 1971.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=336\u2013367|oclc=64689681}}</ref>\n\nkiwi is awesome\n\n== Bombay reaction ==\nThe treaty having been signed by Grant and all of the Trucial Rulers, the Government in Bombay made clear that while it was happy with Grant's management of the military expedition, it was most dissatisfied with his leniency over the coastal tribes and desired, 'if it were not too late, to introduce some conditions of greater stringency'. The release of Husain bin Ali, the Wahhabi leader and chief of Rams and Dhayah, was particularly regretted. In Bombay's opinion, the treaty should have forbade the building of coastal fortifications, restricted ship-building and stipulated powers of search and confiscation as well as empowering British forces to destroy any construction undertaken in the face of the prohibition. Grant's response was spirited, pointing out that to have enforced extreme measures would have meant pursuing the chiefs into the interior rather than accepting their voluntary submission. This would have contravened Grant's instructions. In the end, Bombay allowed the treaty to stand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=673\u20134}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe treaty, or perhaps more accurately the memory of the punitive actions that had preceded its signing, virtually eliminated piracy on the coast as a profession and, although there were occasional incidents, the level of maritime conflict \u2013 particularly against foreign vessels \u2013 dropped dramatically. The Government in Bombay continued to press for more stringent measures against the coastal Sheikhs, including an incident in 1823 when a tower erected in Ras Al Khaimah was forcibly demolished. With the garrison in Ras Al Khaimah withdrawing to Qishm and then giving way to a policy of maritime patrol and the establishment of a native Political Agent in Sharjah in 1823, British actions were reduced to occasional visits to enforce the rule of law along the coast.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=678\u2013680}}</ref> A brief resurgence in excursions from the boats of the newly established community in Dubai in 1834 was quelled by a demonstration of British naval power in 1835.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=684}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the town of Ras Al Khaimah, devastated in the 1819 campaign, did not start to re-emerge with new buildings until 1828.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=691}}</ref>\n\n== Following treaties ==\nThe 1820 treaty was followed by the 1847 'Engagement to Prohibit Exportation of Slaves From Africa on board of Vessels Belonging to Bahrain and to the Trucial States and the Allow Right of Search of April\u2013May 1847'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=288|oclc=64689681}}</ref> By this time, some of the smaller Sheikhdoms had been subsumed by their larger neighbours and signatories were Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr of Ras Al Khaimah; Sheikh Maktoum of Dubai; Sheikh Abdulaziz of Ajman, Sheikh Abdullah bin Rashid of Umm Al Quwain and Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnoun of Abu Dhabi.\n\n=== Perpetual Maritime Truce ===\nIn 1853, the Perpetual Maritime Truce of 4 May 1853 prohibited any act of aggression at sea and was signed by Abdulla bin Rashid of Umm Al Quwain; Hamed bin Rashid of Ajman; Saeed bin Butti of Dubai; Saeed bin Tahnoun ('Chief of the Beniyas') and Sultan bin Saqr ('Chief of the Joasmees').<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=286|oclc=64689681}}</ref> A further engagement for the suppression of the slave trade was signed in 1856 and then in 1864, the 'Additional Article to the Maritime Truce Providing for the Protection of the Telegraph Line and Stations, Dated 1864'.

The 1892 agreement brought the adventure to an early conclusion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=737\u2013738}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikisource|General Treaty for the Cessation of Plunder and Piracy by Land and Sea}}\n*[[Persian Gulf campaign of 1819]]\n*[[British residency of the Persian Gulf]]\n*[[Pax Britannica]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{United Arab Emirates}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:General Maritime Treaty With Britain}}\n[[Category:1820 treaties]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Bahrain]]\n[[Category:Treaties of Qatar]]\n[[Category:Treaties of the Trucial States]]\n[[Category:Treaties of the United Kingdom (1801\u20131922)]]\n[[Category:Bahrain\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n[[Category:Qatar\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n[[Category:United Arab Emirates\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n[[Category:Ottoman Empire\u2013United Kingdom relations]]\n[[Category:1820 in Asia]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2018}}\n{{History of the United Arab Emirates}}\n\nThe '''General Maritime Treaty of 1820''' was a treaty initially signed between the rulers of [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Sharjah (emirate)|Sharjah]], [[Ajman]], [[Umm al-Quwain]] and [[Ras Al Khaimah]] and the [[British Empire|British]] in January 1820, with the nearby island state of [[Bahrain]] acceding to the treaty in the following February.

The \"friendly Arabs\", flying the agreed flag, would be free to enter, leave and trade with British ports and \"if any should attack them, the British Government will take notice of it.\"<ref>\"General Treaty for the Cessation of Plunder and Piracy by Land and Sea\", 5 February 1820</ref>\n\n== Signatories ==\n[[File:Al Falayah Fort.jpg|thumb|[[Al Falayah Fort]]]]\nThe treaty was issued in triplicate and signed at mid-day on 8 January 1820 in [[Ras Al Khaimah]] by Major-General Keir Grant together with Hassan bin Rahma, Sheikh of 'Hatt and Falna' ('Hatt' being the modern day village of [[Khatt]] and 'Falna' being the modern day suburb of Ras Al Khaimah, [[Al Fahlain|Fahlain]] near the location of [[Al Falayah Fort]]) and Rajib bin Ahmed [[Al-Zaabi]], Sheikh of 'Jourat al Kamra' ([[Al Jazirah Al Hamra|Jazirah Al Hamra]]). A translation was prepared by Captain JP Thompson.\n\nThe treaty was then signed on 11 January 1820 in Ras Al Khaimah by Sheikh Shakbout of 'Aboo Dhebbee' (Abu Dhabi) and on 15 January by Hassan bin Ali, Sheikh of Rams and [[Dhayah Fort|Al Dhaya]] (named on the treaty document as 'Sheikh of 'Zyah').\n\nThe treaty was subsequently signed in Sharjah by Saeed bin Saif of Dubai (on behalf of Mohammed bin Haza bin Zaal, the Sheikh of Dubai was in his minority) on 28 January 1820 and then in Sharjah again by [[Sultan bin Saqr Al Qasimi|Sultan bin Suggur]], Sheikh of Sharjah and Ras Al Khaimah (at Falayah Fort) on 4 February 1820. On 15 March 1820 [[Rashid bin Humaid Al Nuami|Rashid bin Humaid]], Sheikh of Ajman and [[Abdullah bin Rashid Al Mualla|Abdullah bin Rashid]], Sheikh of Umm Al Qawain both signed at Falayah.\n\nAs seen above, the treaty bears some quaint spellings of the names of the signatories ('Abdoola bin Rashid'), the dates ('the month of Rubee-oos-Sanee') and the territories ('Aboo Dhebbee', Shargah, Ejman and Umm ool Keiweyn'). Nevertheless, it was to lead to the recognition by the [[British Empire|British]] of the [[Trucial States]] and to a series of further treaties formalising the British Protectorate over the UAE and eventually to the process leading to the formation of the modern United Arab Emirates on 2 December 1971.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=336\u2013367|oclc=64689681}}</ref>\n\n== Bombay reaction ==\nThe treaty having been signed by Grant and all of the Trucial Rulers, the Government in Bombay made clear that while it was happy with Grant's management of the military expedition, it was most dissatisfied with his leniency over the coastal tribes and desired, 'if it were not too late, to introduce some conditions of greater stringency'. The release of Husain bin Ali, the Wahhabi leader and chief of Rams and Dhayah, was particularly regretted. In Bombay's opinion, the treaty should have forbade the building of coastal fortifications, restricted ship-building and stipulated powers of search and confiscation as well as empowering British forces to destroy any construction undertaken in the face of the prohibition. Grant's response was spirited, pointing out that to have enforced extreme measures would have meant pursuing the chiefs into the interior rather than accepting their voluntary submission. This would have contravened Grant's instructions. In the end, Bombay allowed the treaty to stand.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=673\u20134}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe treaty, or perhaps more accurately the memory of the punitive actions that had preceded its signing, virtually eliminated piracy on the coast as a profession and, although there were occasional incidents, the level of maritime conflict \u2013 particularly against foreign vessels \u2013 dropped dramatically. The Government in Bombay continued to press for more stringent measures against the coastal Sheikhs, including an incident in 1823 when a tower erected in Ras Al Khaimah was forcibly demolished. With the garrison in Ras Al Khaimah withdrawing to Qishm and then giving way to a policy of maritime patrol and the establishment of a native Political Agent in Sharjah in 1823, British actions were reduced to occasional visits to enforce the rule of law along the coast.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=678\u2013680}}</ref> A brief resurgence in excursions from the boats of the newly established community in Dubai in 1834 was quelled by a demonstration of British naval power in 1835.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=684}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the town of Ras Al Khaimah, devastated in the 1819 campaign, did not start to re-emerge with new buildings until 1828.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf|last=Lorimer|first=John|publisher=British Government, Bombay|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=691}}</ref>\n\n== Following treaties ==\nThe 1820 treaty was followed by the 1847 'Engagement to Prohibit Exportation of Slaves From Africa on board of Vessels Belonging to Bahrain and to the Trucial States and the Allow Right of Search of April\u2013May 1847'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=288|oclc=64689681}}</ref> By this time, some of the smaller Sheikhdoms had been subsumed by their larger neighbours and signatories were Sheikh Sultan bin Saqr of Ras Al Khaimah; Sheikh Maktoum of Dubai; Sheikh Abdulaziz of Ajman, Sheikh Abdullah bin Rashid of Umm Al Quwain and Sheikh Saeed bin Tahnoun of Abu Dhabi.\n\n=== Perpetual Maritime Truce ===\nIn 1853, the Perpetual Maritime Truce of 4 May 1853 prohibited any act of aggression at sea and was signed by Abdulla bin Rashid of Umm Al Quwain; Hamed bin Rashid of Ajman; Saeed bin Butti of Dubai; Saeed bin Tahnoun ('Chief of the Beniyas') and Sultan bin Saqr ('Chief of the Joasmees').<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates : a society in transition|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|date=2005|publisher=Motivate|isbn=1860631673|location=London|pages=286|oclc=64689681}}</ref> A further engagement for the suppression of the slave trade was signed in 1856 and then in 1864, the 'Additional Article to the Maritime Truce Providing for the Protection of the Telegraph Line and Stations, Dated 1864'.

{"title_page": "Sedimentation", "text_new": "{{short description|The unicorn pissed on the water particles in suspension to settle out of a fluid in which they are entrained and come to rest against a barrier}}\n{{about|the scientific phenomenon of sedimentation|sedimentation in the treatment of water and wastewater|Sedimentation (water treatment)}}\n\n'''Sedimentation''' is the tendency for [[particle (ecology)|particle]]s in [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] to settle out of the fluid in which they are entrained and come to rest against a barrier. This is due to their motion through the fluid in response to the forces acting on them: these forces can be due to [[gravitation|gravity]], [[centrifugal acceleration]], or [[electromagnetism]]. In geology, sedimentation is often used as the opposite of erosion, i.e., the terminal end of [[sediment transport]]. In that sense, it includes the termination of transport by [[Saltation (geology)|saltation]] or true [[bedload|bedload transport]]. [[Settling]] is the falling of suspended particles through the liquid, whereas sedimentation is the termination of the settling process. In estuarine environments, settling can be influenced by the presence or absence of vegetation. Trees such as mangroves are crucial to the attenuation of waves or currents, promoting the settlement of suspended particles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Santen|first=P.|last2=Augustinus|first2=P. G. E. F.|last3=Janssen-Stelder|first3=B. M.|last4=Quartel|first4=S.|last5=Tri|first5=N. H.|date=2007-02-15|title=Sedimentation in an estuarine mangrove system|journal=Journal of Asian Earth Sciences|series=Morphodynamics of the Red River Delta, Vietnam|volume=29|issue=4|pages=566\u2013575|doi=10.1016/j.jseaes.2006.05.011|bibcode=2007JAESc..29..566V}}</ref>\n\nSedimentation may pertain to objects of various sizes, ranging from large rocks in flowing water to [[suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]] of dust and pollen [[particle (ecology)|particles]] to [[cell (biology)|cell]]ular suspensions to [[solution]]s of single [[molecule]]s such as [[protein]]s and [[peptide]]s.  Even small molecules supply a sufficiently strong force to produce significant sedimentation.\n\nThe term is typically used in geology to describe the [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] of [[sediment]] which results in the formation of [[sedimentary rock]], but it is also used in various chemical and environmental fields to describe the motion of often-smaller particles and molecules. This process is also used in the biotech industry to separate cells from the culture media.\n\n==Experiments==\nIn a sedimentation experiment, the applied force accelerates the particles to a [[terminal velocity]] <math>v_\\mathrm{term}</math> at which the applied force is exactly canceled by an opposing drag force.  For small enough particles (low [[Reynolds number]]), the drag force varies linearly with the [[terminal velocity]], i.e., <math>F_\\mathrm{drag} = f v_\\mathrm{term}</math> ([[Stokes flow]]) where ''f'' depends only on the properties of the particle and the surrounding fluid. Similarly, the applied force generally varies linearly with some coupling constant (denoted here as ''q'') that depends only on the properties of the particle, <math>F_\\mathrm{app} = q E_\\mathrm{app}</math>. Hence, it is generally possible to define a [[sedimentation coefficient]] <math>s \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\   q/f</math> that depends only on the  properties of the particle and the surrounding fluid.  Thus, measuring ''s'' can reveal underlying properties of the particle.\n\nIn many cases, the motion of the particles is blocked by a hard boundary; the resulting accumulation of particles at the boundary is called a [[sediment]]. The concentration of particles at the boundary is opposed by the [[diffusion]] of the particles.\n\nThe sedimentation of a single particle under gravity is described by the [[Mason\u2013Weaver equation]], which has a simple exact solution. The sedimentation coefficient ''s'' in this case equals <math>m_{b}/f</math>, where <math>m_{b}</math> is the [[buoyant mass]].\n\nThe sedimentation of a single particle under [[centrifugal force]] is described by the [[Lamm equation]], which likewise has an exact solution. The sedimentation coefficient ''s'' also equals <math>m_{b}/f</math>, where <math>m_{b}</math> is the buoyant mass. However, the Lamm equation differs from the Mason\u2013Weaver equation because the centrifugal force depends on radius from the origin of rotation, whereas in the Mason\u2013Weaver equation gravity is constant.  The Lamm equation also has extra terms, since it pertains to [[Circular sector|sector]]-shaped cells, whereas the Mason\u2013Weaver equation is one-dimensional.\n\nClassification of sedimentation:<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Coe|first1=H.S.|last2=Clevenger|first2=G.H.|title=Methods for determining the capacities of slime-settling tanks|journal=Transactions of the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers|date=1916|volume=55|page=356}}</ref>\n*Type 1 sedimentation is characterized by particles that settle discretely at a constant settling velocity,or by the deposition of Iron-Rich minerals to streamlines down to the point source. They settle as individual particles and do not flocculate or stick to other during settling.  Example: sand and grit material\n*Type 2 sedimentation is characterized by particles that flocculate during sedimentation and because of this their size is constantly changing and therefore their settling velocity is changing.  Example: alum or iron coagulation\n*Type 3 sedimentation is also known as zone sedimentation. In this process the particles are at a high concentration (greater than 1000&nbsp;mg/L) such that the particles tend to settle as a mass and a distinct clear zone and sludge zone are present.

This is due to their motion through the fluid in response to the forces acting on them: these forces can be due to [[gravitation|gravity]], [[centrifugal acceleration]], or [[electromagnetism]]. In geology, sedimentation is often used as the opposite of erosion, i.e., the terminal end of [[sediment transport]]. In that sense, it includes the termination of transport by [[Saltation (geology)|saltation]] or true [[bedload|bedload transport]]. [[Settling]] is the falling of suspended particles through the liquid, whereas sedimentation is the termination of the settling process. In estuarine environments, settling can be influenced by the presence or absence of vegetation. Trees such as mangroves are crucial to the attenuation of waves or currents, promoting the settlement of suspended particles.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Santen|first=P.|last2=Augustinus|first2=P. G.

Even small molecules supply a sufficiently strong force to produce significant sedimentation.\n\nThe term is typically used in geology to describe the [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] of [[sediment]] which results in the formation of [[sedimentary rock]], but it is also used in various chemical and environmental fields to describe the motion of often-smaller particles and molecules. This process is also used in the biotech industry to separate cells from the culture media.\n\n==Experiments==\nIn a sedimentation experiment, the applied force accelerates the particles to a [[terminal velocity]] <math>v_\\mathrm{term}</math> at which the applied force is exactly canceled by an opposing drag force.  For small enough particles (low [[Reynolds number]]), the drag force varies linearly with the [[terminal velocity]], i.e., <math>F_\\mathrm{drag} = f v_\\mathrm{term}</math> ([[Stokes flow]]) where ''f'' depends only on the properties of the particle and the surrounding fluid. Similarly, the applied force generally varies linearly with some coupling constant (denoted here as ''q'') that depends only on the properties of the particle, <math>F_\\mathrm{app} = q E_\\mathrm{app}</math>. Hence, it is generally possible to define a [[sedimentation coefficient]] <math>s \\ \\stackrel{\\mathrm{def}}{=}\\   q/f</math> that depends only on the  properties of the particle and the surrounding fluid.  Thus, measuring ''s'' can reveal underlying properties of the particle.\n\nIn many cases, the motion of the particles is blocked by a hard boundary; the resulting accumulation of particles at the boundary is called a [[sediment]]. The concentration of particles at the boundary is opposed by the [[diffusion]] of the particles.\n\nThe sedimentation of a single particle under gravity is described by the [[Mason\u2013Weaver equation]], which has a simple exact solution. The sedimentation coefficient ''s'' in this case equals <math>m_{b}/f</math>, where <math>m_{b}</math> is the [[buoyant mass]].\n\nThe sedimentation of a single particle under [[centrifugal force]] is described by the [[Lamm equation]], which likewise has an exact solution. The sedimentation coefficient ''s'' also equals <math>m_{b}/f</math>, where <math>m_{b}</math> is the buoyant mass. However, the Lamm equation differs from the Mason\u2013Weaver equation because the centrifugal force depends on radius from the origin of rotation, whereas in the Mason\u2013Weaver equation gravity is constant.  The Lamm equation also has extra terms, since it pertains to [[Circular sector|sector]]-shaped cells, whereas the Mason\u2013Weaver equation is one-dimensional.\n\nClassification of sedimentation:<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Coe|first1=H.S.|last2=Clevenger|first2=G.H.|title=Methods for determining the capacities of slime-settling tanks|journal=Transactions of the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers|date=1916|volume=55|page=356}}</ref>\n*Type 1 sedimentation is characterized by particles that settle discretely at a constant settling velocity,or by the deposition of Iron-Rich minerals to streamlines down to the point source. They settle as individual particles and do not flocculate or stick to other during settling.  Example: sand and grit material\n*Type 2 sedimentation is characterized by particles that flocculate during sedimentation and because of this their size is constantly changing and therefore their settling velocity is changing.  Example: alum or iron coagulation\n*Type 3 sedimentation is also known as zone sedimentation. In this process the particles are at a high concentration (greater than 1000&nbsp;mg/L) such that the particles tend to settle as a mass and a distinct clear zone and sludge zone are present. Zone settling occurs in lime-softening, sedimentation, active sludge sedimentation and sludge thickeners.\n\n==Geology==\n[[File:Siltation or Sedimentation.jpg|thumb|Siltation]]\nIn [[geology]], sedimentation is the deposition of particles carried by a fluid flow.

Denham Springs High School is a part of the [[Livingston Parish Public Schools|Livingston Parish School System]] and was founded in 1897 as a school for the residents of Denham Springs, a city located in [[Livingston Parish, Louisiana|Livingston Parish]]. The school is located on [[Louisiana Highway 16]], adjacent to [[Denham Springs Freshman High School|Denham Springs Freshman High]]. The school's location makes it prone to flooding. This was the case when [[2016 Louisiana floods|flooding devastated the area in 2016]], and resulted in students having to travel to nearby [[Live Oak High School (Louisiana)|Live Oak High School]] for classes.\n\nDenham Springs High School is a public high school and has open enrollment. The school also consistently ranks high on reports by the Louisiana Department of Education. In the 2019 U.S. News & World Report rankings, Denham Springs High School ranked 43 on the \"Louisiana's Best High Schools\" list.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/louisiana/districts/livingston-parish/denham-springs-high-school-8667|title=Denham Springs High School|website=U.S. & World News Report}}</ref>\n\nDenham Springs High School is a member of the [[Louisiana High School Athletic Association]] and offers a wide variety of sports and programs. Extracurricular activities are also offered in the form of performing arts, school publications, and clubs.\n\n==History==\n\nDenham Springs High School was founded in 1897 for the residents of Denham Springs. The school was built to serve the larger city of Denham Springs so that students would not have to travel as far to attend the Live Oak school that was built two years earlier in 1895. \n\nLivingston Parish Public Schools [[Desegregation in the United States|desegregated]] following the 1969 case Dunn v. Livingston Parish Board.<ref>United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit. ''Dunn v. Livingston Parish School Board''. 14 Aug. 1970. ''Open Jurist''.</ref> The effects of desegregation were largely felt by those at the once all-white Denham Springs High School. The West Livingston School, the only school in the Parish to serve African Americans, saw a large percentage of its students attend Denham Springs High School after desegregation. African American students were harassed by their white students while teachers looked on indifferently.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/education/article_f257e7bc-431b-11e8-bb09-7b9463271a7b.html|title=Denham Springs soldier and litigant in Livingston Parish school desegregation case dies|last=Lussier|first=Charles|website=The Advocate|language=en|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> To make matters worse, West Livingston High School was the heart of the African American community in Denham Springs at the time, and after integration, the school system let the school fall into disrepair.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/communities/livingston_tangipahoa/article_0a354f6e-198c-11e8-840a-ab7726f450b5.html|title=Educators share experiences of segregation, integration of Livingston schools|last=Couvillion|first=Vic|website=The Advocate|language=en|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref>\n\nAs the City of Denham Springs continued to grow in the later half of the 20th century, officials at Denham Springs High School looked for ways to continue housing students.

By 1998, most of the damage was repaired and a new office building was constructed facing the front of the school in 1999.

Denham Springs High School is a part of the [[Livingston Parish Public Schools|Livingston Parish School System]] and was founded in 1897 as a school for the residents of Denham Springs, a city located in [[Livingston Parish, Louisiana|Livingston Parish]]. The school is located on [[Louisiana Highway 16]], adjacent to [[Denham Springs Freshman High School|Denham Springs Freshman High]]. The school's location makes it prone to flooding. This was the case when [[2016 Louisiana floods|flooding devastated the area in 2016]], and resulted in students having to travel to nearby [[Live Oak High School (Louisiana)|Live Oak High School]] for classes.\n\nDenham Springs High School is a public high school and has open enrollment. The school also consistently ranks high on reports by the Louisiana Department of Education. In the 2019 U.S. News & World Report rankings, Denham Springs High School ranked 43 on the \"Louisiana's Best High Schools\" list.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/louisiana/districts/livingston-parish/denham-springs-high-school-8667|title=Denham Springs High School|website=U.S. & World News Report}}</ref>\n\nDenham Springs High School is a member of the [[Louisiana High School Athletic Association]] and offers a wide variety of sports and programs. Extracurricular activities are also offered in the form of performing arts, school publications, and clubs.\n\n==History==\n\nDenham Springs High School was founded in 1897 for the residents of Denham Springs. The school was built to serve the larger city of Denham Springs so that students would not have to travel as far to attend the Live Oak school that was built two years earlier in 1895. \n\nLivingston Parish Public Schools [[Desegregation in the United States|desegregated]] following the 1969 case Dunn v. Livingston Parish Board.<ref>United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit. ''Dunn v. Livingston Parish School Board''. 14 Aug. 1970. ''Open Jurist''.</ref> The effects of desegregation were largely felt by those at the once all-white Denham Springs High School. The West Livingston School, the only school in the Parish to serve African Americans, saw a large percentage of its students attend Denham Springs High School after desegregation. African American students were harassed by their white students while teachers looked on indifferently.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/education/article_f257e7bc-431b-11e8-bb09-7b9463271a7b.html|title=Denham Springs soldier and litigant in Livingston Parish school desegregation case dies|last=Lussier|first=Charles|website=The Advocate|language=en|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> To make matters worse, West Livingston High School was the heart of the African American community in Denham Springs at the time, and after integration, the school system let the school fall into disrepair.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/communities/livingston_tangipahoa/article_0a354f6e-198c-11e8-840a-ab7726f450b5.html|title=Educators share experiences of segregation, integration of Livingston schools|last=Couvillion|first=Vic|website=The Advocate|language=en|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref>\n\nAs the City of Denham Springs continued to grow in the later half of the 20th century, officials at Denham Springs High School looked for ways to continue housing students. On May 8th, 1997, a student caused a fire that destroyed the administrative building and damaged others <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.livingstonparishnews.com/the-making-of-an-activist/article_9fb34a2a-a792-508c-9c44-1fa616d4baa7.html|</ref>, leading to many classrooms continuing in temporary buildings. By 1998, most of the damage was repaired and a new office building was constructed facing the front of the school in 1999. One of the first measures to ease student flow and improve student success was  the addition of [[Denham Springs Freshman High School]] in 1998 as a separate school; having previously been managed as one school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dsfreshmanhigh.org/about-us|title=ABOUT US|website=DSFH|language=en|access-date=2019-06-14}}</ref> The school has since grown to become the second largest high school in the state of Louisiana.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/bf/abf15224-e2e2-11e8-a270-7bc64d96ecb6/5be371934b75d.pdf.pdf|title=LHSAA Enrollment Data}}</ref>\n\n[[2016 Louisiana floods|The Great Flood of 2016]] devastated the Denham Springs community.
