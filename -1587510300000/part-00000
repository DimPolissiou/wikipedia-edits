The season premiered on June 22, 2016 on [[CBS]] with a two-hour season premiere and ended with a 90-minute season finale on September 21, 2016. [[Julie Chen]] returned as host. On September 21, 2016, [[Nicole Franzel]] won the game in a 5-4 vote against [[Paul Abrahamian]]. The season lasted for 99 days making it the longest running season in the show's 16-year history.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS's Summer Show Lineup Is Back And Better Than Ever!!|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/news/1005114/cbs-s-summer-show-lineup-is-back-and-better-than-ever-/|website=CBS|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Big Brother Renewed|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/news/1003191/big-brother-renewed-two-more-seasons-to-look-forward-to/|website=CBS}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Fall TV Show Premiere Dates|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/cbs-fall-tv-show-premiere-date-2016-2017-big-bang-theory-ncis-1201800377/|website=Variety.com}}</ref>\n\n==Season development==\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\nOn September 24, 2014, [[CBS]] announced that it had renewed ''[[Big Brother (American TV series)|Big Brother]]'' for its 17th and 18th editions for broadcast in summer 2015 and 2016, respectively. The series would continue to be hosted by [[Julie Chen]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Big Brother Renewed: Two More Seasons To Look Forward To |url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/news/1003191/big-brother-renewed-two-more-seasons-to-look-forward-to/|website=CBS}}</ref>\n\n== Twists ==\n\n=== Teams ===\nSimilar to the cliques twist in ''[[Big Brother 11 (U.S.)|Big Brother 11]],'' the HouseGuests initially competed in teams, which were selected by school-yard pick before the first competition. When a HouseGuest wins Head of Household, their entire team earns immunity from nominations, while the team with the worst performance in each Head of Household competition became the Have-Nots for the week. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Team Name\n!Members\n|-\n|Category 4\n|Frank, Michelle, Paulie, Bridgette\n|-\n|Big Sister\n|Da'Vonne, Paul, Zakiyah, Jozea\n|-\n|Team Unicorn\n|James, Natalie, Victor, Bronte\n|-\n|Freakazoids\n|Nicole, Corey, Tiffany, Glenn\n|}\n\n=== BB Roadkill ===\nFollowing the nomination ceremony, the HouseGuests competed in the BB Roadkill competition, with the winner earning the power to privately nominate a third HouseGuest for eviction. For each Roadkill competition, an [[RV]] is placed in the backyard; one at a time, HouseGuests enter the RV to complete the task. Following the competition, the HouseGuests are privately informed if they won or lost the challenge, with no obligation to ever reveal their result; the winner then names a third nominee in the Diary Room. Unlike the Head of Household, the Roadkill winner could nominate a member of his or her own team, provided their intended nominee is not immune. If the Roadkill nominee is saved by the Power of Veto, the Roadkill winner has to privately name a replacement nominee. The power to privately name a third nominee and replacement was previously seen in ''[[Big Brother 15 (U.S.)|Big Brother 15]]'' with the MVP, who earned the power through public vote. On Day 37, the BB Roadkill competition was officially cancelled.\n\n=== Battle Back ===\nInstead of permanent eviction, the first five evicted HouseGuests received a chance to return to the game. The first two evictees faced off in a duel, with the winner advancing to face the next evicted HouseGuest, permanently eliminating the losers; the remaining evictee will re-enter the house, following four duels. All four duels aired in a special episode on July 22; Jozea defeated Glenn in the first competition, but Victor defeated Jozea, Bronte, and Tiffany in the subsequent competitions to return to the house.<ref>{{cite web|title=\"BIG BROTHER\" ANNOUNCES THE FIRST EVER \"BATTLE BACK\" COMPETITION|url=http://cbspressexpress.com/cbs-entertainment/shows/big-brother/releases/view?id=45609|website=CBS}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! {{nowrap|Round #}}\n!

To find it, HouseGuests deciphered a series of clues hidden on decorations throughout the house to uncover a five-digit code, and then dialed the code into a phone booth in the house to reveal a tunnel to the room; only one HouseGuest was allowed to enter the room at a time. Inside the room was 12 envelopes, and each HouseGuest could only claim one envelope. Inside one of the envelopes was a \"Round Trip Ticket,\" which would allow the HouseGuest who picked it to re-enter the house immediately following eviction. Envelopes could only be opened by a HouseGuest following their eviction; If a HouseGuest opened their envelope prior to their eviction, their card would be voided. Once all remaining HouseGuests entered the room and picked tickets, they were free to enter the room with no restrictions. The tickets were valid until Day 65; Paul had the Round Trip Ticket, but was not evicted while the tickets were still valid.\n\n=== America's Care Package ===\nAfter Frank's eviction, Julie announced that for the next five weeks, beginning in Week 6, viewers would be able to give one HouseGuest per week a special power\u2014or \"care package\"\u2014as determined by a public vote. All five powers were revealed to the public upon the twist's introduction. The HouseGuests were made aware of this twist, though the weekly rewards were left unspecified until the package was dropped in the backyard for public unboxing. Once a HouseGuest receives a care package, they are no longer eligible to win future packages.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! {{nowrap|Week #}}\n! Name\n! Description\n! Winner\n!

Then, Julie Chen told them about the first twist: four HGs from previous seasons would join them. During the introductions, Paulie revealed his secret of being ''[[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|Big Brother 16]]'' runner-up [[Cody Calafiore]]'s brother. Tiffany decided to hold out about her sister, ''[[Big Brother 17 (U.S.)|Big Brother 17]]'' HouseGuest [[Vanessa Rousso]], although Da'Vonne already knew Tiffany's secret and planned to use it to her advantage. Some of the new HGs set on sticking together and running the returnees out of the house; at the same time, the returnees knew they needed some of the newbies on their side to stand any chance of surviving.\n\nLater on, the HGs went outside to form four teams, each headed by a returnee. Julie Chen told the teams about a second twist: they would compete in four competitions. The winning team of each game would be safe and exempt from the next one. The last team remaining would then have to compete against each other as individuals. The loser of the final part would be evicted from the House. The remaining three would then decide among themselves which of their own would be the first Head of Household (HoH).\n\n* '''Immunity Competition (\"Ride the Rocket\"):''' Each team must climb onto their rocket and stay on for as long as possible. The team that will be eliminated first will land in \"Notburg\" and be Have-Nots for the week. The second team to fall will go to \"Mystery Land\" and receive a mystery punishment. The third team will land in \"Cash City\" and be given $10,000 to split. The last team will land in \"Safeville,\" guaranteeing their safety for the next two evictions.\n\nBig Sister became Have-Nots, Category 4 went to Mystery Land, and the Freakazoids received $10,000. Team Unicorn received immunity for two evictions. The three remaining teams then battled in a three-part competition called Hit the Road (HtR).\n\n* '''Hit The Road, Part 1:''' Three members of each team will hold on to three ropes tied to a ring that supports a beam. The free members will dig in the sand for a block, place it on the shaft, and switch out with a teammate. If a block falls, they must start over. The first team to stack a fifteen-block castle on their beam and hit their buzzer will win.\n\nCategory 4 won the competition and were therefore immune from eviction and exempted from the succeeding parts. \n \n* '''Hit The Road, Part 2:''' Teams must complete a three-dimensional, multi-tiered sandcastle puzzle. The first team to finish their sandcastle and step in a designated area will win.\n\nBig Sister won the competition. They were therefore immune from eviction and exempted from the final part in which the Freakazoids would then go head-to-head.\n\n* '''Hit The Road, Part 3:''' Each member of the team will stand on a tilting island-like platform. Each will climb his or her palm tree, grab a coconut, and place it in one of the designated holes that spell out \"SOS.\" The last member to fill the holes and grab the flag will be evicted from the House.\n\nNicole finished first, with Tiffany finishing second and Corey barely edging out Glenn when the latter displaced some of his coconuts upon grabbing his flag. Glenn lost and was evicted immediately. The remaining members of the Freakazoids decided Nicole should be HoH, much to the dismay of the other newbies, who originally planned of getting rid of the returnees early in the game. As HoH, Nicole considered Da'Vonne's advice and targeted Jozea, whom Da'Vonne felt was leading the returnee revolt. She nominated Jozea and Paulie for eviction, with Paulie agreeing as a pawn. To gain the numbers, the returnees pulled in newbies Zakiyah, Michelle, Corey, and Tiffany to form the \"8 Pack\" alliance. Julie then informed the HGs of a new twist called the \"BB Roadkill\" competition.\n\n* '''Roadkill (\"Take It Off\"):''' Each of the HGs must strip off their designated track suit (similar to all HGs) while holding down three buttons in the driver's seat of the RV. If a button is released, their timer will go 30 times faster; if two, 60 times faster; and if all three, 120 times faster. The HG with the shortest recorded time upon hitting the buzzer will win.\n\nFrank was the winner. Natalie, Bronte, and Bridgette formed the \"Spy Girls\" alliance; they did so, however, in full view of Tiffany, who then informed the 8 Pack of this alliance. As a punishment for landing in \"Mystery Land,\" Category 4 had to wear \"pixelated\" costumes for the entire week. At the Roadkill ceremony, Frank secretly nominated Paul. Corey and Da'Vonne were selected to join Nicole, Jozea, Paulie, and Paul for the Power of Veto (PoV) competition. \n \n* '''Power of Veto (\"Dizzy Dog\"):''' Wearing dog costumes, the HGs must spin on their stand 15 times to earn 45 seconds, which would also cause them to briefly become dizzy from the spins. They will then use this time frame to crawl along obstacles and stack dog treats on top of their doghouse. If they fail to return to their stand and respin before their 45 seconds is up, they will be eliminated. The first HG to stack all forty treats and hit their button will win.\n\nPaul was the winner and at the Veto ceremony, took himself off the block, forcing Frank to name Bridgette secretly as the replacement nominee. Jozea, confident he had the votes to stay, was evicted by a 7-4 vote, with Team Unicorn, except for James, and Paul voting to evict Paulie. Julie then informed Jozea about the \"Battle Back\" competition and that he would compete against the next evicted HG.\n|-\n!'''Week 2'''\n|-\n|Following Jozea's eviction, the HGs participated in a new HoH competition.\n\n* '''Head of Household (\"Berry Balanced\"):''' Each team must send one member across one of two log courses: a longer but easier one, and a shorter but more difficult one. That member must then grab a red berry and return it to their team station to fill four columns with a total of 40 red berries. One column should be filled with ten red berries to lock in before proceeding to the next one. However, if a member falls along the course while a column is not yet locked in, that column will lose its berries and he or she will be eliminated from their team. The first team to retrieve the blue berry after filling their columns will win, with the retrieving member becoming the new HoH.\n\nCategory 4 won the competition, giving them immunity from this week's eviction, and Paulie became the new HoH. Paulie targeted Team Unicorn for voting to evict him, with a plan to backdoor Victor for being a physical threat. He then proceeded to nominate Bronte and Paul, who offered himself as a pawn to gain the trust of the House.\n\n* '''Roadkill (\"18 Dollas\"):''' Each of the HGs must look at a set of ten items with different prices. They must then put tags on six items that add up to exactly $18. The HG who correctly tags the six items and hits the buzzer in the fastest time will win.\n\nVictor won the competition. He revealed his win to Paulie, who then disclosed it to other HGs. At the Roadkill ceremony, Victor secretly nominated Tiffany for lack of association with him. With Paul aware of the plan to backdoor his closest ally, Victor, he advised him not to be too trusting of and tell too much information to everyone, but the latter disagreed. Tiffany became emotional and paranoid about being the target but Paulie and her allies assured her she was safe. They, however, thought she was starting to play like her sister Vanessa and considered voting her out instead. Da'Vonne and Zakiyah were selected to join Paulie, Bronte, Paul, and Tiffany for the PoV competition. \n \n* '''Power of Veto (\"Toe-zarks\"):''' The HGs will have 12 minutes to collect letters with corresponding point values from big toes scattered in a pond. They must take the letters back to their board, one at a time, and spell the best word possible. The HG who correctly spells a word with the highest total point value will win.\n\nPaulie was the winner. Da'Vonne told Paulie and her allies about Tiffany's attempt to win the competition despite their wishes for her to throw it to prevent Victor from nominating someone from their alliance. This attempt reinforced their suspicions on her gameplay. At the Veto ceremony, however, Paulie pushed through with his plan, taking Paul off the block and naming Victor as the replacement nominee. Victor was evicted by a 9-1 vote, with Paul voting to evict Bronte. During this week, Jozea and Glenn also faced off in the Battle Back competition.\n\n* '''Battle Back, Round 1 (\"Berry Balanced\"):''' The two evictees will face off in a competition inspired by this week's HoH competition. However, there will only be two columns, and an addition of a \"poison berry,\" which if retrieved by an evictee, will get rid of the berries in the other evictee's column that is not yet locked in. The first evictee to lock in both columns will win.\n\nJozea was the winner and will face off against next week's evictee.

The member with the lowest score in each round will be eliminated. The teams will then rotate members and bounce again. In case of a tie, all tied HGs will be eliminated, unless all four players got the same score, in which case they will serve again. The last HG standing will be the new HoH.\nBridgette was the winner, thereby making her Category 4 teammates also immune from this week's eviction. The other HouseGuests felt that her HoH would be more of Frank's HoH because they were close allies and she trusted him well. With Frank's advice, Bridgette nominated Paul and Tiffany for eviction, with Tiffany as the target for being a loose cannon. Despite being in the 8 Pack, Frank and Tiffany also did not get along well. \n* '''Roadkill (\"Horn Star\"):''' Each of the HouseGuests must press a set of five horns and listen to their respective honks. They then had to listen to a sequence of eight honks and repeat the sequence by pressing the correct horns. If they press the wrong horn, they will hear must try again. The Houseguest who repeats the sequence in the fastest time will win.\nFrank was the winner, and at the Roadkill ceremony, secretly nominated Bronte for eviction.

If they pour the wrong ingredient, their pot will explode and they will be eliminated. The last HG standing will win PoV, in addition to a dinner from Outback Steakhouse for their team and another team of their choice. Host was Da'Vonne.\nBridgette was the winner and chose Big Sister to join Category 4 for the reward dinner. At the Veto ceremony, Bridgette kept her nominations the same. Frank was confident that Tiffany would be evicted. Da'Vonne, still having issues with Frank, rallied the rest of the 8 Pack to flip the vote against Bronte, knowing that Tiffany would go after Frank. On eviction night, Frank and Bridgette were blindsided when Bronte was evicted by a 5-4 vote. During this week, Jozea and Victor also faced off in the Battle Back competition. It was also based on Saved By the Smell, a science-like veto competition (BB17) and Boom goes the Bomb, a Looney Tunes-like veto competition. (BB16)\n* '''Battle Back, Round 2 (\"Kiss My Ace\"):''' The two evictees will face off in a competition inspired by this week's HoH competition. They will have three balls and must bounce them off, one at a time, on a big racket in an attempt to hit one of the five smaller, propped-up rackets with their opponent's face on them on the other side of the court. If they run out of balls, they must retrieve them and bounce again. The first evictee to hit all five rackets will win.\nVictor was the winner and will face off against next week's evictee. Jozea became permanently eliminated from the game.\n|-\n!Week 4\n|-\n|Following Bronte's eviction, the HGs participated in the new HoH competition. Earlier they watched several caricatured photos of the first three evicted HGs on a European trip on the Memory Wall.\n* '''Head of Household (\"Euro Trippin\"):''' Julie will read statements about the said photos, and the HGs will respond whether the comments are TRUE or FALSE. An incorrect answer will result in elimination. The last HG standing will be the new HoH.\nPaulie was the winner, thereby making his Category 4 teammates also immune from this week's eviction and, much to the dismay of the 8 Pack, postponing their plan of evicting Frank. Despite being enemies the previous week, Tiffany, Frank, and Bridgette aligned after being outcasts in the House. They planned on targeting Paulie's alliance with Zakiyah, Nicole, and Corey for running the House in the past weeks. Paulie proceeded to nominate Natalie and Tiffany for eviction, shifting the target back on Tiffany.\n* '''Roadkill (\"Gasping for Air\"):''' Each of the HGs must hang air fresheners on colored lines. If an air freshener falls on the floor, it is out of play. The HG who hangs the most air fresheners in the shortest amount of time will win.\nTiffany was the winner, and at the Roadkill ceremony, secretly named her teammate and Paulie's closest ally, Corey, for eviction in hopes of shifting the power in the House. She told Da'Vonne she was the Roadkill winner but Da'Vonne decided not to reveal this information to the 8 Pack to avoid further tension with Tiffany. Da'Vonne and Paul were selected to join Paulie, Natalie, Tiffany, and Corey for the PoV competition. \n* '''Power of Veto (\"Scooper Star\"):''' HGs will compete in head-to-head matches. They must look at a set of ice-cream cones on a monitor, and replicate those cones by transferring one ice-cream scoop at a time, not setting any scoops on the ground, and only having three scoops on a cone. They must then press their buzzer and if correct, will win that round and eliminate their competitor. The last HG standing will win. Host was Zakiyah.\nCorey was the winner, but considered not using the Veto on himself for fear of Nicole being nominated in his place. Shortly after the competition Da'Vonne started getting paranoid, which made Tiffany suspicious. At the Roadkill ceremony, Corey removed himself from the block, and Tiffany secretly nominated Da'Vonne in his place, hoping the House would see the latter as a bigger threat. Despite Tiffany campaigning hard to stay in the House, she was still evicted by an 8-0-0 vote. During this week, Victor and Bronte also faced off in the Battle Back competition.\n* '''Battle Back, Round 3 (\"Euro Trippin\"):''' \nVictor was the winner and will face off against next week's evictee. Bronte was permanently eliminated from the game. \n|-\n!Week 5\n|-\n|Following Tiffany's eviction, \nJulie revealed to the HouseGuests that both the team and Roadkill twists were dissolved. Julie also announced to the HouseGuests that the first five evicted HouseGuests competed in the Battle Back competition. Victor was revealed to be the champion of the Battle Back duels and he returned to the House. Julie then revealed a twist to the viewers that would be in play for the next five weeks\u2014in the House, there are secret clues to discover a secret room. Any HouseGuest who discovers this secret room will have the opportunity to claim an envelope. One envelope will hold a round trip ticket. Once a HouseGuest gets evicted, their envelope will be opened.

Julie also revealed another twist to the viewers-- \"America's Care Package\"\u2014where for the next five weeks, America had the opportunity to vote to send a care package to a HouseGuest. Once a HouseGuest receives a care package, they may not receive a future one.\n|-\n!Week 6\n|-\n|Following Frank's eviction,\n* '''Head of Household (\"Perfect Shot\"):''' Each HouseGuest had a lane with slots numbered 1-21. They must roll their ball down their lane to try and make the highest score. They had the opportunity to practice by rolling their yellow ball down their lane as often as they wanted. Whenever they decided to take their best shot, they must roll the red ball. Whatever slot the red ball lands in will be their official score. The HouseGuest with the highest score will be the new Head of Household. \nPaul was the winner. For being the bottom four performers in the Head of Household competition, Corey, Natalie, Paulie, and Zakiyah became Have-Nots for the week. However, Natalie received America's Care Package, which contained a Never-Not Pass, rendering her immune from being a Have-Not for the rest of the season.

The HouseGuest who hides their veto card the best will win the Power of Veto. \nPaulie won the Power of Veto, but on Day 55, decided not to use the Power of Veto.

On Day 58, Zakiyah was evicted by a 3-2 vote, with Nicole and Paulie voting to evict Michelle. Zakiyah was revealed not to have the round trip ticket, and she became the second member of the jury. \nImmediately after Zakiyah's eviction, \n* '''Head of Household (\"Statcathalon\"):'''The HouseGuests received numerical questions. HouseGuests were required to state whether the real number was more or less than the number mentioned in the question. An incorrect answer resulted in elimination.

Teams competed in the first two rounds; Category 4 and Big Sister won, earning safety. The remaining team, Freakazoids, competed in the third round individually. Glenn lost the competition and became automatically evicted. The team then had to choose one of their remaining teammates to become the first Head of Household; they chose Nicole.\n* {{note|3|Note 3}}: {{Color box|#FDD5B1|border=darkgray}} During the team phase of the game, the Head of Household's teammates earned immunity from eviction for the week. The team phase ended after week 4.\n* {{note|4|Note 4}}: The winner of the Roadkill competition earned the power to nominate one HouseGuest for eviction. The Roadkill competition winner makes their nomination privately, and the HouseGuest is not obligated to reveal their identity. If the veto is used to save the Roadkill-nominated HouseGuest, the Roadkill winner also privately nominates the replacement. Their nominations become shown in '''bold.''' The final Roadkill competition was in week 4.\n* {{note|5|Note 5}}: Instead of permanent eviction, the first five evicted HouseGuests received a chance to return to the game through the \"Battle Back\" competition. The first two evictees faced off in a duel, in which the winner advanced to face the next evicted HouseGuest, and the loser became permanently eliminated; following four duels, Victor was the last evictee standing and re-entered the house on Day 37.\n* {{note|6|Note 6}}: {{Color box|#ccc|border=darkgray}} For winning the \"Eliminate Two Eviction Votes\" Care Package, James was awarded the power to block two HouseGuests from voting in that week's eviction; he chose Corey and Paul.\n* {{note|7|Note 7}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following the first eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games\u2014including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n* {{note|8|Note 8}}: {{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} For winning the \"Super Safety\" Care Package, Nicole was awarded immunity for the week.\n* {{note|9|Note 9}}: {{Color box|#ccf|border=darkgray}} For winning the \"Co-HoH\" Care Package, Michelle was named Co-Head of Household, earning the right to make one of the nominations and replacement, if necessary. Michelle's nominations are shown in '''bold'''.\n* {{note|10|Note 10}}: During the Head of Household competition in Week 10, the first five jurors \u2014 Da'Vonne, Zakiyah, Bridgette, Paulie, and Victor \u2014 competed for an opportunity to come back into the game. The juror who lasted the longest would return to the game to win and be eligible to become Head of Household if that juror finished first amongst the other HouseGuests in the competition. Victor outlasted the other jurors and re-entered the house.\n* {{note|11|Note 11}}: {{Color box|#FFFACD|border=darkgray}} For winning the \"BB Bribe\" Care Package, Corey earned $5000 to give to another HouseGuest; accepting the bribe would force that HouseGuest into completing the task. Corey bribed Victor in exchange for voting against Michelle.\n* {{note|12|Note 12}}: As Head of Household, Nicole was forced to break the tie on Day 79.\n* {{note|13|Note 13}}: During the finale, the jury members voted for which finalist should win ''Big Brother''.\n</small>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Viewing figures===\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | #\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Air Date\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"unsortable\" | United States\n! rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Source\n|-\n! 18\u201349<br />(rating/share)\n!

The season lasted for 99 days making it the longest running season in the show's 16-year history.<ref>{{cite web|title=CBS's Summer Show Lineup Is Back And Better Than Ever!!|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/news/1005114/cbs-s-summer-show-lineup-is-back-and-better-than-ever-/|website=CBS|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=26 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Big Brother Renewed|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/news/1003191/big-brother-renewed-two-more-seasons-to-look-forward-to/|website=CBS}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=CBS Fall TV Show Premiere Dates|url=https://variety.com/2016/tv/news/cbs-fall-tv-show-premiere-date-2016-2017-big-bang-theory-ncis-1201800377/|website=Variety.com}}</ref>\n\n==Season development==\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\nOn September 24, 2014, [[CBS]] announced that it had renewed ''[[Big Brother (American TV series)|Big Brother]]'' for its 17th and 18th editions for broadcast in summer 2015 and 2016, respectively. The series would continue to be hosted by [[Julie Chen]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Big Brother Renewed: Two More Seasons To Look Forward To |url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_brother/news/1003191/big-brother-renewed-two-more-seasons-to-look-forward-to/|website=CBS}}</ref>\n\n== Twists ==\n\n=== Teams ===\nSimilar to the cliques twist in ''[[Big Brother 11 (U.S.)|Big Brother 11]],'' the HouseGuests initially competed in teams, which were selected by school-yard pick before the first competition. When a HouseGuest wins Head of Household, their entire team earns immunity from nominations, while the team with the worst performance in each Head of Household competition became the Have-Nots for the week. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Team Name\n!Members\n|-\n|Category 4\n|Frank, Michelle, Paulie, Bridgette\n|-\n|Big Sister\n|Da'Vonne, Paul, Zakiyah, Jozea\n|-\n|Team Unicorn\n|James, Natalie, Victor, Bronte\n|-\n|Freakazoids\n|Nicole, Corey, Tiffany, Glenn\n|}\n\n=== BB Roadkill ===\nFollowing the nomination ceremony, the HouseGuests competed in the BB Roadkill competition, with the winner earning the power to privately nominate a third HouseGuest for eviction. For each Roadkill competition, an [[RV]] is placed in the backyard; one at a time, HouseGuests enter the RV to complete the task. Following the competition, the HouseGuests are privately informed if they won or lost the challenge, with no obligation to ever reveal their result; the winner then names a third nominee in the Diary Room. Unlike the Head of Household, the Roadkill winner could nominate a member of his or her own team, provided their intended nominee is not immune. If the Roadkill nominee is saved by the Power of Veto, the Roadkill winner has to privately name a replacement nominee. The power to privately name a third nominee and replacement was previously seen in ''[[Big Brother 15 (U.S.)|Big Brother 15]]'' with the MVP, who earned the power through public vote. On Day 37, the BB Roadkill competition was officially cancelled.\n\n=== Battle Back ===\nInstead of permanent eviction, the first five evicted HouseGuests received a chance to return to the game. The first two evictees faced off in a duel, with the winner advancing to face the next evicted HouseGuest, permanently eliminating the losers; the remaining evictee will re-enter the house, following four duels. All four duels aired in a special episode on July 22; Jozea defeated Glenn in the first competition, but Victor defeated Jozea, Bronte, and Tiffany in the subsequent competitions to return to the house.<ref>{{cite web|title=\"BIG BROTHER\" ANNOUNCES THE FIRST EVER \"BATTLE BACK\" COMPETITION|url=http://cbspressexpress.com/cbs-entertainment/shows/big-brother/releases/view?id=45609|website=CBS}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! {{nowrap|Round #}}\n!

To find it, HouseGuests deciphered a series of clues hidden on decorations throughout the house to uncover a five-digit code, and then dialed the code into a phone booth in the house to reveal a tunnel to the room; only one HouseGuest was allowed to enter the room at a time. Inside the room was 12 envelopes, and each HouseGuest could only claim one envelope. Inside one of the envelopes was a \"Round Trip Ticket,\" which would allow the HouseGuest who picked it to re-enter the house immediately following eviction. Envelopes could only be opened by a HouseGuest following their eviction; If a HouseGuest opened their envelope prior to their eviction, their card would be voided. Once all remaining HouseGuests entered the room and picked tickets, they were free to enter the room with no restrictions. The tickets were valid until Day 65; Paul had the Round Trip Ticket, but was not evicted while the tickets were still valid.\n\n=== America's Care Package ===\nAfter Frank's eviction, Julie announced that for the next five weeks, beginning in Week 6, viewers would be able to give one HouseGuest per week a special power\u2014or \"care package\"\u2014as determined by a public vote. All five powers were revealed to the public upon the twist's introduction. The HouseGuests were made aware of this twist, though the weekly rewards were left unspecified until the package was dropped in the backyard for public unboxing. Once a HouseGuest receives a care package, they are no longer eligible to win future packages.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! {{nowrap|Week #}}\n! Name\n! Description\n! Winner\n!

Paul Abrahamian returned for ''[[Big Brother 19 (U.S.)|Big Brother 19]]'' as a HouseGuest and made a [[cameo appearance]] in the series premiere of ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (American TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]'' during the first HoH competition of the season, while Nicole Franzel returned to host the first HoH Competition of season 19. Abrahamian once again finished in 2nd place, becoming the 2nd houseguest in Big Brother history to reach the final two twice. \n\nPaulie Calafiore appeared on the [[Ex on the Beach (American season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Ex on the Beach (American TV series)|Ex on the Beach]]'', while Corey and Jozea appeared on the ''[[Ex on the Beach (American season 2)|second season]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/pictures/ex-on-the-beach-season-2-cast-farrah-abraham-and-more/|title=Farrah Abraham, Chad Johnson Join 'Ex on the Beach' Season 2: Meet the Cast|date=15 November 2018|website=usmagazine.com|accessdate=21 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118163417/https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/pictures/ex-on-the-beach-season-2-cast-farrah-abraham-and-more/#|archive-date=2018-11-18|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ew.com/tv/2018/03/15/ex-on-the-beach-us-cast/ |title=MTV's 'Ex on the Beach' cast to feature 'Bachelor,' 'Vanderpump Rules,' 'AYTO' alumni |last=Kinane |first=Ruth |date=March 15, 2018 |website=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |language=en |access-date=March 15, 2018}}</ref> Paulie Calafiore, Natalie Negrotti, Victor Arroyo, Da'Vonne Rogers, and Jozea Flores have all appeared on ''[[The Challenge (TV series)|The Challenge]]''.<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.mtvpress.com/press-releases/2019/01/16/mtvs-the-challenge-war-of-the-worlds-returns-on-wednesday-february-6th|title=About the Series|publisher=MTV|date=January 16, 2019|accessdate=September 2, 2019|archivedate=July 13, 2019|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20190713183002/https://www.mtvpress.com/series/the-challenge-war-of-the-worlds|url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.mtvpress.com/press-releases/2019/08/09/mtvs-the-challenge-war-of-the-worlds-2-premieres-wednesday-august-28-at-800pm-et-pt-with-expanded-90-minute-episodes|title=MTV's 'The Challenge: War of the Worlds 2' premieres Wednesday, August 28 at 8:00PM ET/PT with expanded 90-minute episodes|publisher=MTV|date=August 9, 2019|accessdate=September 2, 2019|archivedate=September 2, 2019|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20190902184506/http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2019/08/09/mtvs-the-challenge-war-of-the-worlds-2-premieres-wednesday-august-28-at-800pm-et-pt-with-expanded-90-minute-episodes-243113/20190809mtv01/|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAbrahamian, Franzel, and Victor Arroyo appeared on ''[[Big Brother 20 (American season)|Big Brother 20]]'' to celebrate Franzel and Victor Arroyo's engagement which aired on the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/recap/big-brother-20-recap-surprise-engagement/|title=Big Brother 20 recap: A surprise engagement brings the houseguests closer to reality|author=jibrilgagale|date=September 9, 2018|accessdate=September 10, 2018|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, Franzel & Arroyo competed as a team in the [[The Amazing Race 31|31st season]] of ''[[The Amazing Race (American TV series)|The Amazing Race]]'', they placed 4th.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://ew.com/tv/amazing-race-cast-season-31-big-brother-survivor/ | title = Meet the Amazing Race season 31 reality all-star teams | first= Dalton | last =Ross |date = April 5, 2019 | accessdate = April 5, 2019 | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] }}</ref>\n\n==Summary==\n{{long plot|date=November 2016}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Week 1\n|-\n|The twelve new HouseGuests (HGs) entered the House. Then, Julie Chen told them about the first twist: four HGs from previous seasons would join them. During the introductions, Paulie revealed his secret of being ''[[Big Brother 16 (U.S.)|Big Brother 16]]'' runner-up [[Cody Calafiore]]'s brother. Tiffany decided to hold out about her sister, ''[[Big Brother 17 (U.S.)|Big Brother 17]]'' HouseGuest [[Vanessa Rousso]], although Da'Vonne already knew Tiffany's secret and planned to use it to her advantage. Some of the new HGs set on sticking together and running the returnees out of the house; at the same time, the returnees knew they needed some of the newbies on their side to stand any chance of surviving.\n\nLater on, the HGs went outside to form four teams, each headed by a returnee. Julie Chen told the teams about a second twist: they would compete in four competitions. The winning team of each game would be safe and exempt from the next one. The last team remaining would then have to compete against each other as individuals. The loser of the final part would be evicted from the House. The remaining three would then decide among themselves which of their own would be the first Head of Household (HoH).\n\n* '''Immunity Competition (\"Ride the Rocket\"):''' Each team must climb onto their rocket and stay on for as long as possible. The team that will be eliminated first will land in \"Notburg\" and be Have-Nots for the week. The second team to fall will go to \"Mystery Land\" and receive a mystery punishment. The third team will land in \"Cash City\" and be given $10,000 to split. The last team will land in \"Safeville,\" guaranteeing their safety for the next two evictions.\n\nBig Sister became Have-Nots, Category 4 went to Mystery Land, and the Freakazoids received $10,000. Team Unicorn received immunity for two evictions. The three remaining teams then battled in a three-part competition called Hit the Road (HtR).\n\n* '''Hit The Road, Part 1:''' Three members of each team will hold on to three ropes tied to a ring that supports a beam. The free members will dig in the sand for a block, place it on the shaft, and switch out with a teammate. If a block falls, they must start over. The first team to stack a fifteen-block castle on their beam and hit their buzzer will win.\n\nCategory 4 won the competition and were therefore immune from eviction and exempted from the succeeding parts. \n \n* '''Hit The Road, Part 2:''' Teams must complete a three-dimensional, multi-tiered sandcastle puzzle. The first team to finish their sandcastle and step in a designated area will win.\n\nBig Sister won the competition. They were therefore immune from eviction and exempted from the final part in which the Freakazoids would then go head-to-head.\n\n* '''Hit The Road, Part 3:''' Each member of the team will stand on a tilting island-like platform. Each will climb his or her palm tree, grab a coconut, and place it in one of the designated holes that spell out \"SOS.\" The last member to fill the holes and grab the flag will be evicted from the House.\n\nNicole finished first, with Tiffany finishing second and Corey barely edging out Glenn when the latter displaced some of his coconuts upon grabbing his flag. Glenn lost and was evicted immediately. The remaining members of the Freakazoids decided Nicole should be HoH, much to the dismay of the other newbies, who originally planned of getting rid of the returnees early in the game. As HoH, Nicole considered Da'Vonne's advice and targeted Jozea, whom Da'Vonne felt was leading the returnee revolt. She nominated Jozea and Paulie for eviction, with Paulie agreeing as a pawn. To gain the numbers, the returnees pulled in newbies Zakiyah, Michelle, Corey, and Tiffany to form the \"8 Pack\" alliance. Julie then informed the HGs of a new twist called the \"BB Roadkill\" competition.\n\n* '''Roadkill (\"Take It Off\"):''' Each of the HGs must strip off their designated track suit (similar to all HGs) while holding down three buttons in the driver's seat of the RV. If a button is released, their timer will go 30 times faster; if two, 60 times faster; and if all three, 120 times faster. The HG with the shortest recorded time upon hitting the buzzer will win.\n\nFrank was the winner. Natalie, Bronte, and Bridgette formed the \"Spy Girls\" alliance; they did so, however, in full view of Tiffany, who then informed the 8 Pack of this alliance. As a punishment for landing in \"Mystery Land,\" Category 4 had to wear \"pixelated\" costumes for the entire week. At the Roadkill ceremony, Frank secretly nominated Paul. Corey and Da'Vonne were selected to join Nicole, Jozea, Paulie, and Paul for the Power of Veto (PoV) competition. \n \n* '''Power of Veto (\"Dizzy Dog\"):''' Wearing dog costumes, the HGs must spin on their stand 15 times to earn 45 seconds, which would also cause them to briefly become dizzy from the spins. They will then use this time frame to crawl along obstacles and stack dog treats on top of their doghouse. If they fail to return to their stand and respin before their 45 seconds is up, they will be eliminated. The first HG to stack all forty treats and hit their button will win.\n\nPaul was the winner and at the Veto ceremony, took himself off the block, forcing Frank to name Bridgette secretly as the replacement nominee. Jozea, confident he had the votes to stay, was evicted by a 7-4 vote, with Team Unicorn, except for James, and Paul voting to evict Paulie. Julie then informed Jozea about the \"Battle Back\" competition and that he would compete against the next evicted HG.\n|-\n!'''Week 2'''\n|-\n|Following Jozea's eviction, the HGs participated in a new HoH competition.\n\n* '''Head of Household (\"Berry Balanced\"):''' Each team must send one member across one of two log courses: a longer but easier one, and a shorter but more difficult one. That member must then grab a red berry and return it to their team station to fill four columns with a total of 40 red berries. One column should be filled with ten red berries to lock in before proceeding to the next one. However, if a member falls along the course while a column is not yet locked in, that column will lose its berries and he or she will be eliminated from their team. The first team to retrieve the blue berry after filling their columns will win, with the retrieving member becoming the new HoH.\n\nCategory 4 won the competition, giving them immunity from this week's eviction, and Paulie became the new HoH. Paulie targeted Team Unicorn for voting to evict him, with a plan to backdoor Victor for being a physical threat. He then proceeded to nominate Bronte and Paul, who offered himself as a pawn to gain the trust of the House.\n\n* '''Roadkill (\"18 Dollas\"):''' Each of the HGs must look at a set of ten items with different prices. They must then put tags on six items that add up to exactly $18. The HG who correctly tags the six items and hits the buzzer in the fastest time will win.\n\nVictor won the competition. He revealed his win to Paulie, who then disclosed it to other HGs. At the Roadkill ceremony, Victor secretly nominated Tiffany for lack of association with him. With Paul aware of the plan to backdoor his closest ally, Victor, he advised him not to be too trusting of and tell too much information to everyone, but the latter disagreed. Tiffany became emotional and paranoid about being the target but Paulie and her allies assured her she was safe. They, however, thought she was starting to play like her sister Vanessa and considered voting her out instead. Da'Vonne and Zakiyah were selected to join Paulie, Bronte, Paul, and Tiffany for the PoV competition. \n \n* '''Power of Veto (\"Toe-zarks\"):''' The HGs will have 12 minutes to collect letters with corresponding point values from big toes scattered in a pond. They must take the letters back to their board, one at a time, and spell the best word possible. The HG who correctly spells a word with the highest total point value will win.\n\nPaulie was the winner. Da'Vonne told Paulie and her allies about Tiffany's attempt to win the competition despite their wishes for her to throw it to prevent Victor from nominating someone from their alliance. This attempt reinforced their suspicions on her gameplay. At the Veto ceremony, however, Paulie pushed through with his plan, taking Paul off the block and naming Victor as the replacement nominee. Victor was evicted by a 9-1 vote, with Paul voting to evict Bronte. During this week, Jozea and Glenn also faced off in the Battle Back competition.\n\n* '''Battle Back, Round 1 (\"Berry Balanced\"):''' The two evictees will face off in a competition inspired by this week's HoH competition. However, there will only be two columns, and an addition of a \"poison berry,\" which if retrieved by an evictee, will get rid of the berries in the other evictee's column that is not yet locked in. The first evictee to lock in both columns will win.\n\nJozea was the winner and will face off against next week's evictee. Glenn was permanently eliminated from the game.\n|-\n!Week 3\n|-\n|Following Victor's eviction, the HGs participated in the new HoH competition.\n\n* '''Head of Household (\"Kiss My Ace\"):''' One member from each team must bounce a ball on a big tennis racket with bouncy strings in an attempt to land it in the highest-scored slot possible on their side of court. The member with the lowest score in each round will be eliminated. The teams will then rotate members and bounce again. In case of a tie, all tied HGs will be eliminated, unless all four players got the same score, in which case they will serve again. The last HG standing will be the new HoH.\nBridgette was the winner, thereby making her Category 4 teammates also immune from this week's eviction. The other HouseGuests felt that her HoH would be more of Frank's HoH because they were close allies and she trusted him well. With Frank's advice, Bridgette nominated Paul and Tiffany for eviction, with Tiffany as the target for being a loose cannon. Despite being in the 8 Pack, Frank and Tiffany also did not get along well. \n* '''Roadkill (\"Horn Star\"):''' Each of the HouseGuests must press a set of five horns and listen to their respective honks. They then had to listen to a sequence of eight honks and repeat the sequence by pressing the correct horns. If they press the wrong horn, they will hear must try again. The Houseguest who repeats the sequence in the fastest time will win.\nFrank was the winner, and at the Roadkill ceremony, secretly nominated Bronte for eviction. Bridgette was upset that her Spy Girls ally was nominated again, not knowing ironically that it was her closest ally Frank who did it. Natalie and Paulie were selected to join Bridgette, Bronte, Paul, and Tiffany for the PoV competition.\n* '''Power of Veto (\"Vetolicious\"):''' The HouseGuests must look at a sequence of colored ingredients labeled with respective tastes that will be flashed on a monitor. Each ingredient is contained in a beaker. Julie will then ask a question about the sequence and the Houseguests must pour in their pot the ingredient that corresponds to their answer. If they pour the wrong ingredient, their pot will explode and they will be eliminated. The last HG standing will win PoV, in addition to a dinner from Outback Steakhouse for their team and another team of their choice. Host was Da'Vonne.\nBridgette was the winner and chose Big Sister to join Category 4 for the reward dinner. At the Veto ceremony, Bridgette kept her nominations the same. Frank was confident that Tiffany would be evicted. Da'Vonne, still having issues with Frank, rallied the rest of the 8 Pack to flip the vote against Bronte, knowing that Tiffany would go after Frank. On eviction night, Frank and Bridgette were blindsided when Bronte was evicted by a 5-4 vote. During this week, Jozea and Victor also faced off in the Battle Back competition. It was also based on Saved By the Smell, a science-like veto competition (BB17) and Boom goes the Bomb, a Looney Tunes-like veto competition. (BB16)\n* '''Battle Back, Round 2 (\"Kiss My Ace\"):''' The two evictees will face off in a competition inspired by this week's HoH competition. They will have three balls and must bounce them off, one at a time, on a big racket in an attempt to hit one of the five smaller, propped-up rackets with their opponent's face on them on the other side of the court. If they run out of balls, they must retrieve them and bounce again. The first evictee to hit all five rackets will win.\nVictor was the winner and will face off against next week's evictee. Jozea became permanently eliminated from the game.\n|-\n!Week 4\n|-\n|Following Bronte's eviction, the HGs participated in the new HoH competition. Earlier they watched several caricatured photos of the first three evicted HGs on a European trip on the Memory Wall.\n* '''Head of Household (\"Euro Trippin\"):''' Julie will read statements about the said photos, and the HGs will respond whether the comments are TRUE or FALSE. An incorrect answer will result in elimination. The last HG standing will be the new HoH.\nPaulie was the winner, thereby making his Category 4 teammates also immune from this week's eviction and, much to the dismay of the 8 Pack, postponing their plan of evicting Frank. Despite being enemies the previous week, Tiffany, Frank, and Bridgette aligned after being outcasts in the House. They planned on targeting Paulie's alliance with Zakiyah, Nicole, and Corey for running the House in the past weeks. Paulie proceeded to nominate Natalie and Tiffany for eviction, shifting the target back on Tiffany.\n* '''Roadkill (\"Gasping for Air\"):''' Each of the HGs must hang air fresheners on colored lines. If an air freshener falls on the floor, it is out of play. The HG who hangs the most air fresheners in the shortest amount of time will win.\nTiffany was the winner, and at the Roadkill ceremony, secretly named her teammate and Paulie's closest ally, Corey, for eviction in hopes of shifting the power in the House. She told Da'Vonne she was the Roadkill winner but Da'Vonne decided not to reveal this information to the 8 Pack to avoid further tension with Tiffany. Da'Vonne and Paul were selected to join Paulie, Natalie, Tiffany, and Corey for the PoV competition. \n* '''Power of Veto (\"Scooper Star\"):''' HGs will compete in head-to-head matches. They must look at a set of ice-cream cones on a monitor, and replicate those cones by transferring one ice-cream scoop at a time, not setting any scoops on the ground, and only having three scoops on a cone. They must then press their buzzer and if correct, will win that round and eliminate their competitor. The last HG standing will win. Host was Zakiyah.\nCorey was the winner, but considered not using the Veto on himself for fear of Nicole being nominated in his place. Shortly after the competition Da'Vonne started getting paranoid, which made Tiffany suspicious. At the Roadkill ceremony, Corey removed himself from the block, and Tiffany secretly nominated Da'Vonne in his place, hoping the House would see the latter as a bigger threat. Despite Tiffany campaigning hard to stay in the House, she was still evicted by an 8-0-0 vote. During this week, Victor and Bronte also faced off in the Battle Back competition.\n* '''Battle Back, Round 3 (\"Euro Trippin\"):''' \nVictor was the winner and will face off against next week's evictee. Bronte was permanently eliminated from the game. \n|-\n!Week 5\n|-\n|Following Tiffany's eviction, \nJulie revealed to the HouseGuests that both the team and Roadkill twists were dissolved. Julie also announced to the HouseGuests that the first five evicted HouseGuests competed in the Battle Back competition. Victor was revealed to be the champion of the Battle Back duels and he returned to the House. Julie then revealed a twist to the viewers that would be in play for the next five weeks\u2014in the House, there are secret clues to discover a secret room. Any HouseGuest who discovers this secret room will have the opportunity to claim an envelope. One envelope will hold a round trip ticket. Once a HouseGuest gets evicted, their envelope will be opened.

They must keep their hand above their head while stepping over the light bars that shuffle by their feet. If they drop their hand, their confetti box will open, eliminating them from the competition. The last HouseGuest standing will be the new Head of Household. James was the winner. +\nOn Day 38, James nominated Bridgette and Frank for eviction, with Frank as the target. On Day 39, James, Bridgette and Frank, as well as Michelle, Da'Vonne and Nicole, competed in the veto competition.\n* '''Power of Veto (\"OTEV the Dope DJ\"):''' In this competition, OTEV asked the HouseGuests a riddle about a competition. They then had to find a record with the name of the competition described in the riddle. The last HouseGuest to return the correct record to OTEV will be eliminated. The last HouseGuest standing will win the Power of Veto. \nMichelle won the Power of Veto. On Day 41, Michelle decided not to use the Power of Veto. On Day 42, all the HouseGuests solved the clues and discovered the secret room. On Day 44, Frank was evicted by a unanimous 9-0 vote. Frank was revealed not to have the round trip ticket. Julie also revealed another twist to the viewers-- \"America's Care Package\"\u2014where for the next five weeks, America had the opportunity to vote to send a care package to a HouseGuest. Once a HouseGuest receives a care package, they may not receive a future one.\n|-\n!Week 6\n|-\n|Following Frank's eviction,\n* '''Head of Household (\"Perfect Shot\"):''' Each HouseGuest had a lane with slots numbered 1-21. They must roll their ball down their lane to try and make the highest score. They had the opportunity to practice by rolling their yellow ball down their lane as often as they wanted. Whenever they decided to take their best shot, they must roll the red ball. Whatever slot the red ball lands in will be their official score. The HouseGuest with the highest score will be the new Head of Household. \nPaul was the winner. For being the bottom four performers in the Head of Household competition, Corey, Natalie, Paulie, and Zakiyah became Have-Nots for the week. However, Natalie received America's Care Package, which contained a Never-Not Pass, rendering her immune from being a Have-Not for the rest of the season. On Day 45, Paul nominated Bridgette and Paulie for eviction. On Day 46, Paul, Bridgette, and Paulie, as well as Corey, Victor and Natalie competed in the veto competition.\n* '''Power of Veto (\"Ready, Set, Whoa\"):'''  In this competition, HouseGuests had to hold down two buttons in their starting lane. At the end of their lanes, a monitor will cycle through the words \"ready, set, go.\" If a HouseGuest releases a button before the word \"go,\" they will be eliminated. Once they see the word \"go,\" they must run to the end of their lane and hit one of the five buttons. The last person to hit a button will become eliminated. Once a HouseGuest uses a button, it is out of play for future rounds. The last HouseGuest standing will win the Power of Veto.\nPaulie was the winner. On Day 48, Paulie took himself off the block, and Paul named Da'Vonne as the replacement nominee. On Day 51, Da'Vonne was evicted by a 6-2 vote, with Michelle and Zakiyah voting to evict Bridgette. Da'Vonne was revealed not to have the round trip ticket, and she became the first member of the jury.\n|-\n!Week 7\n|-\n|Following Da'Vonne's eviction, \n* '''Head of Household (\"Harsh Hashtags\"):''' In this competition, HouseGuests stood on a small disc suspended by a hanging rope. As the competition continued, they spun into insult punching bags. If a HouseGuest falls off their disc, they will become eliminated. The last HouseGuest standing will be the new Head of Household. \nVictor was the winner. For being the first three HouseGuests to fall in the Head of Household competition, Bridgette, Corey, and James became Have-Nots for the week. James received America's Care Package, which contained the power to prevent two HouseGuests from voting at the next eviction. On Day 52, Victor nominated Michelle and Zakiyah for eviction. On Day 53, Victor, Michelle and Zakiyah chose Paulie, James, and Nicole for the POV competition.\n* '''Power of Veto (\"Hide and Go Veto\"):''' HouseGuests had three minutes to hide their locked veto card in the House individually. Then, one at a time, HouseGuests entered the House and had one minute to attempt to find a veto card. If a HouseGuest's veto card becomes revealed, they will become eliminated, though the owner of the veto cards will not become revealed until the end of the competition. The HouseGuest who hides their veto card the best will win the Power of Veto. \nPaulie won the Power of Veto, but on Day 55, decided not to use the Power of Veto. At the live eviction, Julie informed the HouseGuests of the Double Eviction. Just before the first live vote, James used his America's Care Package to prevent Corey and Paul from voting. On Day 58, Zakiyah was evicted by a 3-2 vote, with Nicole and Paulie voting to evict Michelle. Zakiyah was revealed not to have the round trip ticket, and she became the second member of the jury. \nImmediately after Zakiyah's eviction, \n* '''Head of Household (\"Statcathalon\"):'''The HouseGuests received numerical questions. HouseGuests were required to state whether the real number was more or less than the number mentioned in the question. An incorrect answer resulted in elimination. The last HouseGuest standing will be the new Head of Household. \nCorey was the winner and immediately nominated Bridgette and Michelle for eviction, putting the plan to evict Bridgette in motion. Corey, Bridgette, and Michelle, as well as Paul, Nicole and James, later competed in the POV competition.\n* '''Power of Veto (\"Veto Time\"):'''In this competition, HouseGuests had to run across their lane into their ball pit at the end. They must search through the balls to find three clocks. They must return their clocks to their stand one at a time.

The first HouseGuest to hit their button will win the Power of Veto.\nCorey was the winner but decided not to use the Power of Veto. On Day 58, Bridgette was evicted by a 5-1 vote, with Natalie voting to evict Michelle. Bridgette was revealed not to have the round trip ticket, and she became the third member of the jury.\n|-\n!Week 8\n|-\n|Following Zakiyah and Bridgette's eviction,\n* '''Head of Household (\"Hollywood Squirrels\"):''' In this competition, HouseGuests competed in one-on-one matches. In each round, HouseGuests were asked a question based on a grid of Benny the BB Comp Squirrels. If a HouseGuest buzzes in with the correct answer, they will move on and eliminate their opponent. If they are incorrect, they will be eliminated. The HouseGuest who survives in each round must pick the next two HouseGuests to face off. The last HouseGuest standing will be the new Head of Household. \nVictor was the winner. For being the first two HouseGuests eliminated in the Head of Household competition, Michelle and Nicole became Have-Nots for the week.

On Day 60, Zingbot made an appearance and hosted Victor, Corey, Paulie, Paul, Nicole and James in the POV competition, with Natalie moderating.\n* '''Power of Veto (\"Zingbot for President\"):''' In each round, HouseGuests launched a beanbag at a map to claim votes for Zingbot. Once a spot has been landed in, any future tosses into that spot will have a score of zero. The HouseGuest who gets the fewest votes in each round will be eliminated from the competition. After each HouseGuest has been eliminated, they will claim a campaign gift. HouseGuests eliminated in future rounds have the option of keeping their gift or claiming a gift already revealed. The HouseGuest with the Power of Veto at the end of the game will win the Power of Veto.

Teams competed in the first two rounds; Category 4 and Big Sister won, earning safety. The remaining team, Freakazoids, competed in the third round individually. Glenn lost the competition and became automatically evicted. The team then had to choose one of their remaining teammates to become the first Head of Household; they chose Nicole.\n* {{note|3|Note 3}}: {{Color box|#FDD5B1|border=darkgray}} During the team phase of the game, the Head of Household's teammates earned immunity from eviction for the week. The team phase ended after week 4.\n* {{note|4|Note 4}}: The winner of the Roadkill competition earned the power to nominate one HouseGuest for eviction. The Roadkill competition winner makes their nomination privately, and the HouseGuest is not obligated to reveal their identity. If the veto is used to save the Roadkill-nominated HouseGuest, the Roadkill winner also privately nominates the replacement. Their nominations become shown in '''bold.''' The final Roadkill competition was in week 4.\n* {{note|5|Note 5}}: Instead of permanent eviction, the first five evicted HouseGuests received a chance to return to the game through the \"Battle Back\" competition. The first two evictees faced off in a duel, in which the winner advanced to face the next evicted HouseGuest, and the loser became permanently eliminated; following four duels, Victor was the last evictee standing and re-entered the house on Day 37.\n* {{note|6|Note 6}}: {{Color box|#ccc|border=darkgray}} For winning the \"Eliminate Two Eviction Votes\" Care Package, James was awarded the power to block two HouseGuests from voting in that week's eviction; he chose Corey and Paul.\n* {{note|7|Note 7}}: This week was a double eviction week. Following the first eviction, the remaining HouseGuests played a week's worth of games\u2014including HoH and Veto competitions and Nomination, Veto and Eviction ceremonies\u2014during the remainder of the live show, culminating in a second eviction for the week.\n* {{note|8|Note 8}}: {{Color box|#FBF373|border=darkgray}} For winning the \"Super Safety\" Care Package, Nicole was awarded immunity for the week.\n* {{note|9|Note 9}}: {{Color box|#ccf|border=darkgray}} For winning the \"Co-HoH\" Care Package, Michelle was named Co-Head of Household, earning the right to make one of the nominations and replacement, if necessary. Michelle's nominations are shown in '''bold'''.\n* {{note|10|Note 10}}: During the Head of Household competition in Week 10, the first five jurors \u2014 Da'Vonne, Zakiyah, Bridgette, Paulie, and Victor \u2014 competed for an opportunity to come back into the game. The juror who lasted the longest would return to the game to win and be eligible to become Head of Household if that juror finished first amongst the other HouseGuests in the competition. Victor outlasted the other jurors and re-entered the house.\n* {{note|11|Note 11}}: {{Color box|#FFFACD|border=darkgray}} For winning the \"BB Bribe\" Care Package, Corey earned $5000 to give to another HouseGuest; accepting the bribe would force that HouseGuest into completing the task. Corey bribed Victor in exchange for voting against Michelle.\n* {{note|12|Note 12}}: As Head of Household, Nicole was forced to break the tie on Day 79.\n* {{note|13|Note 13}}: During the finale, the jury members voted for which finalist should win ''Big Brother''.\n</small>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Viewing figures===\n<!--Before you save your edit, please preview to make sure it does not cause interference with formatting.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | #\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Air Date\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center\" class=\"unsortable\" | United States\n! rowspan=\"2\" class=\"unsortable\" | Source\n|-\n! 18\u201349<br />(rating/share)\n!

The men run into each other on a bus bound for [[Ooty]], where Raveena lives, and soon realise that they have a common goal. The two then fail at various attempts to woo the woman.\n\nMeanwhile, they decide to insinuate themselves in her house. Amar pretends to be a man who has lost his memory after getting hit by Raveena, while Prem pretends to be a doctor. The boys do not know that Raveena's secretary Karishma is the real Raveena and Raveena's actual name is Karishma. Raveena switched her identity because she wanted to find a boy who will love her, not her money.\n\nNobody is aware that Ram Gopal has a twin brother called Shyam Gopal Bajaj, alias Teja. Teja is a criminal who has taken lots of money from Crime Master Gogo. Teja hopes to land the riches himself by kidnapping his brother and posing as Ram. He has also planted his cronies Robert and Bhalla in the household.\n\nRam arrives in India, and Teja plans to steal Ram's money converted in diamonds. Ram sees through the real nature of Amar and Prem, thus declining Raveena's marriage to either of them. The duo plan to fake a kidnapping where they will heroically \"rescue\" Ram. Unknown to them, Teja has also planned to kidnap Ram.\n\nTeja succeeds in having Ram kidnapped. Amar and Prem go to rescue Ram, but Teja makes them believe that he is Ram and enters Ram's household. Initially, nobody suspects a thing, but the girls soon smell a rat. The boys have discovered the real identities of the girls. Prem has fallen for the real Raveena, while Amar has fallen for the real Karishma.\n\nThe girls tell their suspicions to the boys. The boys tail Teja and soon find out the truth. Here, Ram tricks Teja and escapes the prison. However, the boys mistake him for Teja, resulting in Ram being imprisoned again \u2013 with Amar and Prem. However, Amar and Prem succeed in convincing Robert and Bhalla that Ram is Teja.\n\nThe boys, along with Robert and Bhalla, stop Teja. However, Ram is kidnapped along with Raveena and Karishma. At Gogo's lair, the boys try to control the situation along with Ram. In a comic standoff, the real motive of each villain is revealed. However, due to the smartness of the boys, police raid Gogo's lair, thus rounding up all the criminals. Ram finally decides to let Karishma and Raveena marry Prem and Amar.\n\n==Cast and crew==\n\n===Cast===\n* [[Aamir Khan]] as ''Amar Manohar''\n* [[Salman Khan]] as ''Prem Bhopali''\n* [[Raveena Tandon]] as ''Raveena'' (fake) / ''Karishma''\n* [[Karisma Kapoor]] as ''Karishma'' (fake) / ''Raveena Bajaj''\n* [[Paresh Rawal]] as ''Shyam Gopal'' \"Teja\" ''Bajaj and Ram Gopal Bajaj''\n* [[Shakti Kapoor]] as ''Crime Master Gogo''\n* [[Viju Khote]] as ''Robert''\n* [[Shehzad Khan]] as ''Vinod Bhalla''\n* [[Jagdeep]] as ''Bankelal Bhopali'' (Prem's dad)\n* [[Deven Verma]] as ''Murli Manohar'' (Amar's dad)\n* [[Mehmood (actor)|Mehmood]] as ''Johnny'' from Wah-Wah Productions\n* [[Javed Khan Amrohi|Javed Khan]] as ''Anand Akela''\n* [[Tiku Talsania]] as ''Inspector Pandey''\n* [[Harish Patel]] as ''SevaRam ji'' Lodge Owner\n* [[Juhi Chawla]] as ''herself (Guest appearance)''\n* [[Govinda (actor)|Govinda]] as ''himself (Guest appearance)''\n\nIn 2013, there were rumours that former United Nations diplomat and member of Parliament [[Shashi Tharoor]] made a guest appearance in the film.

The men run into each other on a bus bound for [[Ooty]], where Raveena lives, and soon realise that they have a common goal. The two then fail at various attempts to woo the woman.\n\nMeanwhile, they decide to insinuate themselves in her house. Amar pretends to be a man who has lost his memory after getting hit by Raveena, while Prem pretends to be a doctor. The boys do not know that Raveena's secretary Karishma is the real Raveena and Raveena's actual name is Karishma. Raveena switched her identity because she wanted to find a boy who will love her, not her money.\n\nNobody is aware that Ram Gopal has a twin brother called Shyam Gopal Bajaj, alias Teja. Teja is a criminal who has taken lots of money from Crime Master Gogo. Teja hopes to land the riches himself by kidnapping his brother and posing as Ram. He has also planted his cronies Robert and Bhalla in the household.\n\nRam arrives in India, and Teja plans to steal Ram's money converted in diamonds. Ram sees through the real nature of Amar and Prem, thus declining Raveena's marriage to either of them. The duo plan to fake a kidnapping where they will heroically \"rescue\" Ram. Unknown to them, Teja has also planned to kidnap Ram.\n\nTeja succeeds in having Ram kidnapped. Amar and Prem go to rescue Ram, but Teja makes them believe that he is Ram and enters Ram's household. Initially, nobody suspects a thing, but the girls soon smell a rat. The boys have discovered the real identities of the girls. Prem has fallen for the real Raveena, while Amar has fallen for the real Karishma.\n\nThe girls tell their suspicions to the boys. The boys tail Teja and soon find out the truth. Here, Ram tricks Teja and escapes the prison. However, the boys mistake him for Teja, resulting in Ram being imprisoned again \u2013 with Amar and Prem. However, Amar and Prem succeed in convincing Robert and Bhalla that Ram is Teja.\n\nThe boys, along with Robert and Bhalla, stop Teja. However, Ram is kidnapped along with Raveena and Karishma. At Gogo's lair, the boys try to control the situation along with Ram. In a comic standoff, the real motive of each villain is revealed. However, due to the smartness of the boys, police raid Gogo's lair, thus rounding up all the criminals. Ram finally decides to let Karishma and Raveena marry Prem and Amar.\n\n==Cast and crew==\n\n===Cast===\n* [[Aamir Khan]] as ''Amar Manohar''\n* [[Salman Khan]] as ''Prem Bhopali''\n* [[Raveena Tandon]] as ''Raveena'' (fake) / ''Karishma''\n* [[Karisma Kapoor]] as ''Karishma'' (fake) / ''Raveena Bajaj''\n* [[Paresh Rawal]] as ''Shyam Gopal'' \"Teja\" ''Bajaj and Ram Gopal Bajaj''\n* [[Shakti Kapoor]] as ''Crime Master Gogo''\n* [[Viju Khote]] as ''Robert''\n* [[Shehzad Khan]] as ''Vinod Bhalla''\n* [[Jagdeep]] as ''Bankelal Bhopali'' (Prem's dad)\n* [[Deven Verma]] as ''Murli Manohar'' (Amar's dad)\n* [[Mehmood (actor)|Mehmood]] as ''Johnny'' from Wah-Wah Productions\n* [[Javed Khan Amrohi|Javed Khan]] as ''Anand Akela''\n* [[Tiku Talsania]] as ''Inspector Pandey''\n* [[Harish Patel]] as ''SevaRam ji'' Lodge Owner\n* [[Juhi Chawla]] as ''herself (Guest appearance)''\n* [[Govinda (actor)|Govinda]] as ''himself (Guest appearance)''\n\nIn 2013, there were rumours that former United Nations diplomat and member of Parliament [[Shashi Tharoor]] made a guest appearance in the film.
