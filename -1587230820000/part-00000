[[John Barwell Cator]] and his family began the leasing and selling of land for the building of villas which led to a rapid increase in population, between 1850 and 1900, from 2,000 to 26,000. Housing and population growth has continued at a lesser pace since 1900.\n\nThe town, directly west of [[Bromley]], has areas of commerce and industry, principally around the curved network of streets featuring its high street and is served in transport by three main railway stations &mdash; nine within the post town &mdash; plus towards its western periphery two [[Tramlink]] stations. In common with the rest of Bromley, the largest borough of London by area, Beckenham has several pockets of recreational land which are a mixture of sports grounds, fishing ponds and parks.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe place-name 'Beckenham' is first attested in a Saxon charter of 862 as ''Biohhahema mearc''.<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p.33.</ref>\nThe settlement is referred to as ''Bacheham'' in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, and in the ''[[Textus Roffensis]]'' as ''Becceham''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53788|title=Parishes: Beckenham|work=british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> The name is thought to derive from ''Beohha'''s homestead (Beohha + ham in [[Old English]]).<ref name=Brewer>Brewer's Britain and Ireland, compiled by John Ayto and Ian Crofton, [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]], 2005, {{ISBN|0-304-35385-X}}.</ref> The name of the small stream here \u2013 the River Beck \u2013 is most likely to have been named after the village.

A [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] camp was sited here, and a [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman road]], the [[London to Lewes Way (Roman road)|London to Lewes Way]] passed through the district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckenhamhistory.co.uk/beckenhamearlyhistory.html|title=Search|work=beckenhamhistory.co.uk}}</ref><ref>http://www.beckenhamplaceparkfriends.org.uk/index.html</ref>\n\nWith the arrival of the [[Normans]], the Manor of Beckenham took on added importance, and controlled much of what is modern Beckenham. St George's Church was built in the 12th century. In the Middle Ages, the manor lands were divided: The other estates of Foxgrove Manor, Kelsey and Langley form the bulk of Beckenham. Beckenham still remained a small village until well into the 19th century. The beginning of its growth began after 1825 When the estates of John Cator and Peter Burrell, Baron Gwydir began to be developed. In 1760, (source: Peter Collinson, Cator's father in law, in his <ref>Hortus Collinsonianus</ref>) [[John Cator]] built Beckenham Place and became Lord of the Manor in 1773 after purchasing the Manor of Beckenham from Frederick St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke. After he died in 1806, his heirs (Joseph Cator's sons) soon became aware that the area in such close proximity to London was ripe for development, especially once the railway had arrived in 1857; and large villas began to be built around the new station. Wide roads and large gardens epitomised these properties often built by developers who acquired land from the Cators.(sources: Bromley Historic Collections catalogue; Cator)\nPeter Burrell, Baron Gwydir died in 1820 and his estates were purchased by the Hoare banking family and the Goodharts who purchased Langley. These estates were subsequently split up and developed. \nBetween then and the early 20th century, further growth of Beckenham took place: the [[Shortlands]] area in 1863; Clock House in the 1890s; [[Elmers End]] in 1911 (where smaller suburban houses were built); Park Langley in 1908; and Eden Park in 1926.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/bromley/beckenham.htm |title=Ideal Homes: Suburbia in Focus |access-date=4 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921071901/http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/bromley/beckenham.htm |archive-date=21 September 2008 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Manor of Foxgrove was also broken up at some point: its name is commemorated in a local road.\n\nBeckenham is a [[suburb]] and a town in its own right with a non-bypassed non-pedestrianised [[high street]] on a route between the rest of the borough and [[South London]] and has spread about its centre on 15 pre-1850 houses which are [[listed building]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckenham.towntalk.co.uk/about/index.php|title=About Beckenham Town Centre & Historical Information  - Beckenham TownTalk|work=towntalk.co.uk|access-date=4 November 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023142937/http://www.beckenham.towntalk.co.uk/about/index.php|archive-date=23 October 2009|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1261534|accessdate=3 February 2015}} 1-3 Kelsey Square</ref><ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1261549|accessdate=3 February 2015}} 4-7 Kelsey Square</ref>\n\n{{See also|Municipal Borough of Beckenham}}\n\n==Governance==\nThe [[Municipal Borough of Beckenham]] came into being in 1935.

Around it were the great manorial estates: Beckenham, Foxgrove, Kelsey and Langley [[manor|Halls and Parks]].\n\nThe [[River Ravensbourne]] flows northwards at the eastern side of the town, towards its confluence with the [[River Thames]]. A small stream, the River Beck (sometimes referred to as the Hawkesbrook), passes through the town before joining the Ravensbourne via the Pool River further north.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53788&strquery=Beckenham|title=Parishes: Beckenham|work=british-history.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nThe area is part of an outcrop of [[London Clay]] and consists of many small hills.<ref>''The Rural Landscape of Kent'' S.G.McRae & C.P.Burnham, published by Wye College, 1973</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Shops, Beckenham Road, Beckenham - geograph.org.uk - 1581947.jpg|thumb|left|Victorian commercial buildings along Beckenham Road]]\nDespite its leafy image, its close proximity to Central London and nine railway stations within the post town (Beckenham Junction, Clock House, Birkbeck, New Beckenham, Ravensbourne, Kent House, Elmers End, Eden Park and Beckenham Hill), make Beckenham a good business location. The town's busy high street contains many restaurants and upmarket chains, as well as family-run independents, and the area has a good selection of well performing schools. Beckenham is the headquarters to [[Capita]] Registrars Limited who provide share registration services for more than half of the UK's quoted companies, [[Proper Records]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/10089363.stm|title=How to sell music the Proper way|work=BBC News}}</ref> the UK's biggest independent music distributor and [[Vizual]], a leading HR software developer.\n\n==Landmarks==\nOne of the interesting landmarks in Beckenham is the [[Chinese Garage]], now a listed building. It is built in an unusual Japanese pagoda style and formerly operated as a car dealership selling [[Peugeot]] and [[Kia Motors|Kia]] cars. Its future is currently being decided. There is also [[St George's Church, Beckenham|St George's Church]], dating back to 1100 but mostly rebuilt at the end of the 19th century. The [[lych gate]] dates from the 13th century, and is one of the oldest in England; the almshouses date back to 1694. There are two old pubs, Ye Olde George Inn (1662), and the Three Tuns (now a branch of [[Zizzi]] restaurants).\n\n[[Kelsey Park]] is another landmark. It was part of the Kelsey Estate, but the mansion no longer remains. The only surviving buildings are the two [[Listed building|Grade II]] listed lodge cottages at the entrance, which are over 200 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-358444-two-lodges-to-beckenham-place-bromley|title=Two Lodges to Beckenham Place - Bromley - Greater London - England - British Listed Buildings|author=Good Stuff|work=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk}}</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Beckenham Junction stn main entrance.jpg|thumb|[[Beckenham Junction railway station|Beckenham Junction]] main entrance]]\n\n===Rail===\nBeckenham is served by nine rail stations - [[Beckenham Junction railway station|Beckenham Junction]], [[Clock House railway station|Clock House]], [[Birkbeck railway station|Birkbeck]], [[New Beckenham railway station|New Beckenham]], [[Ravensbourne railway station|Ravensbourne]], [[Kent House railway station|Kent House]], [[Elmers End railway station|Elmers End]], [[Eden Park railway station|Eden Park]] and [[Beckenham Hill railway station|Beckenham Hill]].\n\nBeckenham Junction and Kent House have services into central London every 15 minutes, taking 13 minutes to [[Brixton railway station|Brixton]] and 21 minutes to [[London Victoria railway station|London Victoria]].\n\nBeckenham Junction also provides services into [[London Bridge railway station|London Bridge]] every 30 minutes, taking 35 minutes, and to [[Orpington railway station|Orpington]] every 15 minutes, taking 7 minutes to [[Bromley South railway station|Bromley South]] and 17 minutes to Orpington.\n\nRavensbourne station and Beckenham Hill provide direct access to central London and the City every 30 minutes - [[Peckham Rye railway station|Peckham Rye]] in 12 minutes, [[Elephant & Castle railway station|Elephant & Castle]] in 23 minutes, [[Blackfriars railway station|London Blackfriars]] in 27 minutes, [[City Thameslink railway station|City Thameslink]] in 29 minutes, [[Farringdon railway station|Farringdon]] in 33 minutes and [[St Pancras railway station|London St Pancras]] in 37 minutes.\n\nNew Beckenham, Clock House, Elmers End and Eden Park have services to [[Charing Cross railway station|London Charing Cross]], London Bridge, [[Waterloo East railway station|Waterloo East]], [[Cannon Street railway station|London Cannon Street]] and to [[Hayes railway station|Hayes]].\n\n===Tram===\n[[Tramlink]] serves Beckenham with services from Beckenham Junction and Elmers End to [[Wimbledon tram stop|Wimbledon]] via [[East Croydon tram stop|East Croydon]].\n\nBirkbeck station serves both the tram and rail services, the stop of Elmer's or Elmers End which is associated with Beckenham and shares its Clockhouse ward.\n\n===Buses===\nBeckenham is served by several [[Transport for London]] buses that link the town with other areas including [[Bromley]], [[Catford]], [[Chislehurst]], [[Croydon]], [[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]], [[Eltham]], [[Lewisham]], [[Orpington]], [[Penge]], [[West Wickham]] and [[Woolwich]].\n\n==Nearest places==\n\n===Neighbourhoods===\n*[[Shortlands]]\n*'''New Beckenham'''\n\n===Current (electoral) [[wards of the United Kingdom]]===\n*Copers Cope\n*Shortlands\n*Kelsey and Eden Park\n*Clock House (all within [[post town]] and suburban to Beckenham)\n\n===Surrounding districts===\n*[[Bellingham, London|Bellingham]] \n*[[Bromley]] \n*[[Hayes, Bromley]]\n*<small>across [[Park Langley|Langley Park]]:</small>[[West Wickham]]\n*[[Eden Park, Bromley|Eden Park, Upper Elmers End and Monks Orchard]]\n*[[Elmers End]] \n*[[Penge]] \n*[[Crystal Palace, London|Crystal Palace]]\n*<small>across Beckenham Place Park:</small>[[Downham]] \n*[[Sydenham, London|Sydenham]]\n*[[Catford]]\n*[[Dulwich]]\n\n==Religious sites==\n[[File:Christ Church, Beckenham - geograph.org.uk - 35351.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Christ Church, Beckenham]]\nThe town has a number of places of worship.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bccn.org.uk/churches.html |title=Beckenham churches |access-date=4 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028210239/http://www.bccn.org.uk/churches.html |archive-date=28 October 2008 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[St George's Church, Beckenham|St. George's Church]] is the principal parish church, and is in the centre of Beckenham.<ref>[http://www.stgb.net/St George's Beckenham]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It was extensively rebuilt, at the end of the 19th century, but an earlier building dates back to 1100.

[[John Barwell Cator]] and his family began the leasing and selling of land for the building of villas which led to a rapid increase in population, between 1850 and 1900, from 2,000 to 26,000. Housing and population growth has continued at a lesser pace since 1900.\n\nThe town, directly west of [[Bromley]], has areas of commerce and industry, principally around the curved network of streets featuring its high street and is served in transport by three main railway stations &mdash; nine within the post town &mdash; plus towards its western periphery two [[Tramlink]] stations. In common with the rest of Bromley, the largest borough of London by area, Beckenham has several pockets of recreational land which are a mixture of sports grounds, fishing ponds and parks.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe place-name 'Beckenham' is first attested in a Saxon charter of 862 as ''Biohhahema mearc''.<ref>[[Eilert Ekwall]], ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-names'', p.33.</ref>\nThe settlement is referred to as ''Bacheham'' in the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, and in the ''[[Textus Roffensis]]'' as ''Becceham''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=53788|title=Parishes: Beckenham|work=british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> The name is thought to derive from ''Beohha'''s homestead (Beohha + ham in [[Old English]]).<ref name=Brewer>Brewer's Britain and Ireland, compiled by John Ayto and Ian Crofton, [[Weidenfeld & Nicolson]], 2005, {{ISBN|0-304-35385-X}}.</ref> The name of the small stream here \u2013 the River Beck \u2013 is most likely to have been named after the village. Other variants of the  name Beckingham (can be confused with a place in Lincolnshire) or Beghenham. (sources: British History Online, The National Archive).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Beckenham2.jpg|thumb|left|Central Beckenham, flooded in 1878.]]\n\nAlthough early written history tells little of the area, archaeological evidence at Holwood Park, where [[Stone Age]] and [[Bronze Age]] artifacts have been found, reveals some evidence of early settlers. A [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] camp was sited here, and a [[Roman roads in Britain|Roman road]], the [[London to Lewes Way (Roman road)|London to Lewes Way]] passed through the district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckenhamhistory.co.uk/beckenhamearlyhistory.html|title=Search|work=beckenhamhistory.co.uk}}</ref><ref>http://www.beckenhamplaceparkfriends.org.uk/index.html</ref>\n\nWith the arrival of the [[Normans]], the Manor of Beckenham took on added importance, and controlled much of what is modern Beckenham. St George's Church was built in the 12th century. In the Middle Ages, the manor lands were divided: The other estates of Foxgrove Manor, Kelsey and Langley form the bulk of Beckenham. Beckenham still remained a small village until well into the 19th century. The beginning of its growth began after 1825 When the estates of John Cator and Peter Burrell, Baron Gwydir began to be developed. In 1760, (source: Peter Collinson, Cator's father in law, in his <ref>Hortus Collinsonianus</ref>) [[John Cator]] built Beckenham Place and became Lord of the Manor in 1773 after purchasing the Manor of Beckenham from Frederick St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke. After he died in 1806, his heirs (Joseph Cator's sons) soon became aware that the area in such close proximity to London was ripe for development, especially once the railway had arrived in 1857; and large villas began to be built around the new station. Wide roads and large gardens epitomised these properties often built by developers who acquired land from the Cators.(sources: Bromley Historic Collections catalogue; Cator)\nPeter Burrell, Baron Gwydir died in 1820 and his estates were purchased by the Hoare banking family and the Goodharts who purchased Langley. These estates were subsequently split up and developed. \nBetween then and the early 20th century, further growth of Beckenham took place: the [[Shortlands]] area in 1863; Clock House in the 1890s; [[Elmers End]] in 1911 (where smaller suburban houses were built); Park Langley in 1908; and Eden Park in 1926.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/bromley/beckenham.htm |title=Ideal Homes: Suburbia in Focus |access-date=4 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921071901/http://www.ideal-homes.org.uk/bromley/beckenham.htm |archive-date=21 September 2008 |url-status = dead|df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Manor of Foxgrove was also broken up at some point: its name is commemorated in a local road.\n\nBeckenham is a [[suburb]] and a town in its own right with a non-bypassed non-pedestrianised [[high street]] on a route between the rest of the borough and [[South London]] and has spread about its centre on 15 pre-1850 houses which are [[listed building]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.beckenham.towntalk.co.uk/about/index.php|title=About Beckenham Town Centre & Historical Information  - Beckenham TownTalk|work=towntalk.co.uk|access-date=4 November 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023142937/http://www.beckenham.towntalk.co.uk/about/index.php|archive-date=23 October 2009|url-status = dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1261534|accessdate=3 February 2015}} 1-3 Kelsey Square</ref><ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1261549|accessdate=3 February 2015}} 4-7 Kelsey Square</ref>\n\n{{See also|Municipal Borough of Beckenham}}\n\n==Governance==\nThe [[Municipal Borough of Beckenham]] came into being in 1935. It took over from what had been, since 1894, Beckenham [[Urban District Council]] and included parts of [[Hayes, Kent|Hayes]] and [[West Wickham]], previously part of Bromley [[Rural District Council]]. The new Borough status reflected the growth of Beckenham in less than fifty years.<ref>In 1861 its population was 2,100; by 1921 this had increased to 33,300, and to 77,300 by 1961.
