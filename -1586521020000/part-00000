After a defeat at the [[Battle of Dara]], the Sasanians moved to invade [[Roman Syria|Syria]] in an attempt to turn the tide of the war. Belisarius' rapid response foiled the plan, and his troops pushed the Persians to the edge of Syria through maneuvering before forcing a battle in which the Sasanians proved to be the pyrrhic victors.\n\n== Prelude ==\nIn April 531 CE, the Persian king [[Kavadh I]] sent an army under ''[[spahbod]]'' [[Azarethes|\u0100z\u0101rethes]], consisting of a cavalry force numbering about 15,000 [[Aswaran]] with an additional group of 5,000 [[Lakhmid]] Arab cavalry<ref name=\"Greatrex\" /> under Al-Mundhir, to start a campaign, this time not through the heavily fortified frontier cities of [[Roman Mesopotamia|Mesopotamia]], but through the less conventional but also less defended route in [[Commagene]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Belisarius : the last Roman general|last=Hughes, Ian (Historian)|isbn=9781473822979|location=Barnsley|oclc=903161296}}</ref> in order to capture Syrian cities like [[Antioch]].\n\nThe Persian army crossed the frontier at [[Circesium]] on the [[Euphrates]] and marched north. As they neared [[Raqqa|Callinicum]], Belisarius, who commanded the Byzantine army, set out to follow them as they advanced westwards. Belisarius' forces consisted of about 5,000 men and another 3,000 [[Ghassanid]] Arab allies, for the remainder of his army had been left to secure [[Dara (Mesopotamia)|Dara]]. The Byzantines finally blocked the Persian advance at [[Chalcis, Syria|Chalcis]], where reinforcements under [[Hermogenes (magister officiorum)|Hermogenes]] also arrived, bringing the Byzantine force to some 20,000 men. The Persians were forced to withdraw, and the Byzantines followed them east.\n\nInitially, Belisarius only wanted to drive off the Persians, without a risky battle. The Byzantine troops, however, were restless and anxious, and had become over-confident after their recent victories at Dara and Stala, and clamoured for battle. After failing to convince his men, and realizing they would not fight, and possibly mutiny unless he agreed,<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Generalship Of Belisarius|last=Brogna|first=Anthony|publisher=Hauraki Publishing|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> Belisarius prepared his force for battle.\n\n== Deployment ==\n\nThe two armies met outside Callinicum on 19 April 531 CE. Both armies formed up differently, Belisarius again choosing an \"odd\" formation that confused his opposing general. In this case he anchored his left flank on the bank of the river with heavy Byzantine infantry, to their right the army's centre, all of the Byzantine cavalry, many of which were [[cataphract]]s under the command of Ascan. Linking the centre to the Byzantine right was a detachment of Lycaonian infantry (under Stephanacius and Longinus), positioned such that their right was anchored on a rising slope occupied by the army's right wing, which consisted of the 5,000 Ghassanid allies. Belisarius himself took up position in the centre of his deployment.\n\n[[Azarethes|\u0100z\u0101rethes]], who was an \"exceptionally able warrior\" according to Byzantine historian and chronicler Procopius, chose a much more conventional deployment by dividing his army into three equal parts with the Lakhmid allies under Al-Mundhir's command constituting the left wing such that they corresponded to the Ghassanid section of the Byzantine army. It is possible that he also held an elite tactical reserve behind his divisions of Persian Sav\u0101r\u0101n.\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:Callinicumin taistelu 1.svg|thumb|300px|Azarethes reinforces his left wing and the Byzantine right wing is beaten back.]]\n[[File:Callinicumin taistelu 2.svg|thumb|300px|The Byzantine cavalry is routed. Infantry led by Petrus manages to delay the Persian advance until the defenders can complete their retreat.]]\n\nFor much of the day, the battle was a stalemate, with the Persian [[Asv\u0101r\u0101n|Sav\u0101r\u0101n]] skirmishing with the Byzantine light and missile troops, with the Persians gaining the upper hand due to a combination of expertise and wind-direction. Meanwhile, however, [[Azarethes|\u0100z\u0101rethes]] redeployed some of his cavalry to his left wing. This manoeuvre, which went unnoticed by Belisarius, carried calamitous results for the Byzantines later on. After \"two thirds of the day\" had elapsed, mostly spent by skirmishing by smaller units, the Persian left came forth and led a devastating and sudden charge in the lead of the Lakhmid contingent under Al-Mundhir. Such was the impact of the charge that the Ghassanids were routed off the field with such ease as to later inspire accusations of treachery. This exposed the right flank of the Lycaonian infantry as well as Ascon's heavy cavalry in the centre.\n\nAt this juncture the elite Persian cavalry and their Lakhmid allies were placed upon the rising ground looking down on the unprepared right flank of the Byzantine cavalry of Belisarius' centre. Despite valiant efforts by Ascon to rectify the crisis on his right his cataphracts were crushed, causing the Lycaonian infantry to lose morale and retreat, effectively ridding the Byzantine army of its centre also. With his right flank and centre mauled and driven off the field of battle, Belisarius was forced to retreat in an effort to re-form his line, but the retreat was followed and soon the Byzantines found themselves pressed against the river. Here Belisarius scrambled to form a right angle with whatever remnants and reserves he had left to him in order to brace for the coming onslaught. This proved relatively successful as repeated charges by the Persian cavalry did not result in much more than mounting casualties on both sides. Unfortunately for Belisarius, his men could not hold in such a precarious condition indefinitely.\n\n[[Zacharias of Mytilene]] said of the battle: \"''[The Romans] turned and fled before the Persian attack. Many fell into the Euphrates and were drowned, and others were killed.''\"<ref>''Historia'' IX.4,95.4-95.26</ref> However, it is unknown what stage of the battle Zachariah was referring to.\n\nAccording to [[Malalas]], Belisarius fled by boat after the fall of the cavalry commander Ascan and let the army to continue the fighting under Sunicas and Simmas.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kiBL4va4B14C&lpg=PA157&pg=PA158 |title = Procopius and the Sixth Century|isbn = 9780520055179|last1 = Cameron|first1 = Averil|date = January 1985}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nThe strategic outcome of the battle was something of a stalemate; the Byzantine army had lost many soldiers and would not be in fighting condition for months, but the Persian army had taken such heavy losses that it was useless as to its original purpose, the invasion of Syria.\n\nEmperor [[Kavadh I]] removed General \u0100z\u0101rethes from command and stripped him of his honors, as the casualties were high and the Persian army failed to actually capture any Roman fortress as initially intended.\n\nThis mutual disaster was the first of Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian's]] series of (relatively) unsuccessful wars against Sassanids, which led Byzantium to pay heavy tributes in exchange for a peace treaty and the remaining Byzantine land still in Persian hands.\n\nCallinicum ended the first of Belisarius' Persian campaigns, returning all of the land lost to them to Byzantine rule under [[Justinian I]] in the [[Eternal Peace (532)|Eternal Peace]] agreement signed in summer 532 CE.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Zhayedan]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Sources ==\n* {{citation |title=The Roman Eastern Frontier and the Persian Wars (Part II, 363\u2013630 AD) |last=Greatrex |first=Geoffrey | last2=Lieu | first2=Samuel N.

The outraged authorities immediately suppressed the collection, and only a few copies survived, three of which found their way into the college library over the years, and one into the [[Bodleian Library]]. Verses of this form are now known as [[Balliol rhyme]]s.\n\nThe best known of these rhymes is the one on [[Benjamin Jowett]]. This has been widely quoted and reprinted in virtually every book about Jowett and about Balliol ever since.\n{{quote|<poem>\nFirst come I.\nMy name is J-W-TT.\nThere's no knowledge but I know it.\nI am Master of this College,\nWhat I don't know isn't knowledge.</poem>}}\n\nThis and 18 others are attributed to [[Henry Charles Beeching]]. The other quatrains are much less well known.\n\n[[William Tuckwell]] included 18 of these quatrains in his ''Reminiscences'' in 1900, but they all came out only in 1939, thanks to Walter George Hiscock, an Oxford librarian, who issued them personally then and in a second edition in 1955.<ref>\"The Balliol rhymes\" by Walter George Hiscock</ref>\n\n===Balliol\u2013Trinity rivalry===\n[[File:Balliol College from Broad Street looking west.jpg|thumb|The frontage of Balliol College as seen from [[Broad Street, Oxford|Broad Street]], looking west]]\nFor many years, there has been a traditional and fierce [[college rivalry|rivalry]] shown between the students of Balliol and those of its immediate neighbour to the east, [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]].<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Clare |last1=Hopkins |first2=Bryan |last2=Ward-Perkins |title=The Trinity/Balliol Feud |journal=Trinity College Oxford Report |date=1989\u201390 |pages=45\u201366 }}</ref> It has manifested itself on the sports field and the river; in the form of songs (of varying degrees of offensiveness) sung over the dividing walls; and in the form of \"raids\" on the other college. The rivalry reflects that which also exists between [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and Balliol's sister college, [[St John's College, Cambridge]].\n\nIn college [[folklore]], the rivalry goes back to the late 17th century, when [[Ralph Bathurst]], President of Trinity, was supposedly observed throwing stones at Balliol's windows.<ref>Hopkins and Ward-Perkins, \"Trinity/Balliol Feud\", p. 45.</ref> In fact, in its modern form, the rivalry appears to date from the late 1890s, when the chant or song known as a \"Gordouli\" began to be sung from the Balliol side.<ref>For the Gordouli, see {{cite journal |first=G. Norman |last=Knight |title=The Quest for Gordouli |journal=Balliol College Record |year=1969 }}; reprinted in ''Trinity College Oxford Report'', 1984\u201385.</ref>\n\nThe traditional words run:<ref>\"Gordoulis\" was a popular brand of Egyptian cigarette. As \"Gordouli\", it became a nickname applied by Balliol men to a Trinity undergraduate, Arthur Galletti. [[Robert Johnson (civil servant)|Bobby Johnson]], later Deputy Master and Controller of the [[Royal Mint]], was an undergraduate at [[New College, Oxford|New College]]. See Knight, \"Quest for Gordouli\".</ref>\n{{quote|<poem>\nGordouli\nFace like a ham,\n[[Robert Johnson (civil servant)|Bobby Johnson]] says so\nAnd he should know.</poem>}}\n\nThe shouting of chants over the wall is still known as \"a Gordouli\", and the tradition continues as the students gather to sing following boat club dinners and other events. The traditional Gordouli is said to have been sung by Balliol and Trinity men in the trenches of [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]] in the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref>Knight, \"Quest for Gordouli\".</ref>\n\nBalliol became known for its radicalism and political activism in the 20th century, and saw an abortive coup in the 1960s in which students took over the college and declared it \"the People's Republic of Balliol\".<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Chris |editor-last=Baraniuk |title=The Oxford University Alternative Prospectus |date=December 2010 |page=34 }}</ref> The contrast between the [[Left-wing politics|radical]] tendencies of many Balliol students and the traditional conservatism and social exclusivity of Trinity gave the rivalry an extra edge. The fact that Balliol (in contrast to Trinity) had admitted a number of Indian and Asiatic students also gave many of the taunts from the Trinity side a distinctly [[Racism|racist]] tone: Balliol students, for example, were sometime referred to as \"[[Sotho people|Basutos]]\".<ref>Hopkins and Ward-Perkins, \"Trinity/Balliol Feud\", pp. 54\u201360.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Five Red Herrings]]'' (1931), a [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] novel by [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville]] alumna [[Dorothy L.

[[New College, Oxford|New College]] had in 1964 resolved to admit women, but had been prevented from doing so without the approval of the university, which argued that this would be detrimental to the existing women's colleges. On 2 June 1971 a consilium at Balliol voted 26-2 to admit women, and at the next college meeting on 6 December 1971 it was resolved 30-8 to admit women 'as soon as the change in its Statutes permitting this was approved by the Privy Council'. Permission was granted by the university on 8 March 1977.  With the appointment of Carol Clark to a Tutorial Fellowship in Modern Languages in 1973, Balliol became the first ancient all-male college to appoint a female fellow.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/news/2015/july/obituary-for-carol-clark|title=Obituary for Carol Clark - Balliol College, University of Oxford|website=Balliol.ox.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nBefore the full admission of women as undergraduates, the college had decided to establish a co-educational graduate institution. The decision was made on 16 March 1964, and the senior tutor approached  [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's College]] shortly after this. The creation of the Balliol\u2013St Anne's Graduate Institution with St Anne's in 1967 led to the coeducation of men and women on the [[Holywell Manor]] site. Following the arrival of women at Balliol and men at St Anne's in 1979, the joint Graduate Institution was terminated in 1984 by the consent of both colleges. Holywell Manor is now solely a part of Balliol College.\n\nIn 1979, along with many other previously all-male colleges, Balliol accepted its first cohort of female students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/about-balliol/remarkable-alumni/balliol-women-some-alumnae-of-the-college|title=Balliol Women: Some Alumnae of the College {{!}} Balliol College, University of Oxford|website=Balliol.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}</ref> The first woman undergraduate to reside at Balliol was Elena Ceva-Valla, who arrived on 16 September 1979.

The ground floor is the Old Senior Common Room. Balliol's second library pre-dates the publication of printed books in Europe. There is a possibility that the original Master's Chamber, south west side, adorned with a fine oriel window, is earlier than these; it is now the Master's Dining Room.\n\nThe Chapel is the third (perhaps fourth) on the site and was designed by [[William Butterfield]] in 1857.\n\n[[Alfred Waterhouse]] designed the main [[Broad Street, Oxford|Broad Street]] frontage of the college (1867\u201368), along with gateway and tower, known as the Brackenbury Buildings after philanthropist and donor [[Hannah Brackenbury]], replacing earlier structures (Staircases I\u2013VII). The first staircase next to the Chapel contains the Organ Scholar's lodgings.\n\n===Garden Quadrangle===\nSouth-side is the front part of the Master's Lodgings on Broad Street from the Waterhouse improvements of the 1860s of the front quad. The neighbour to this is the Fisher Building of 1759 (Stc X) The undistinguished looking Stc XI, south west side, is in fact the oldest structure in this quadrangle, 1720, originally intended as accommodation for scholars from Bristol, hence its name. Continuing the west-side Stc XII\u2013XIV dates from 1826, by [[George Basevi]], and marks the beginnings of the college's academic renaissance being required for the increasing number of Commoners applying for places. Stc XV by Warren of 1912 filled in the last gap of the quadrangle; the ground floor and basement is the principal Junior Common Room. This unfortunately obscures the lines of the Salvin designed Stc XVI\u2013XIX with Tower of 1853. As does the 1968 building by Beard Stc XX, replacing a Victorian structure. This completely hides a formal gateway similar to that at the Broad Street main entrance, this can be viewed outside from Little Magdalen Street, through the gap marked XIX one finds the small function room \"Massey Room\". At north side, of Stc XX is the \"Back Gate\" which is part of the 1906 Warren building, west and north side, Stc XXI. 1 St Giles' is its neighbour which is part of the college and houses the [[Oxford Internet Institute]]. Beard's Stc XXII replaces Victorian rooms, which were provided from the Vivian Bulkeley-Johnson benefaction. Beard's Stc XX and XXII are connected by the Snell Bridge accommodation at third floor level, which was provided from Glasgow University's Snell Benefaction.\n\nThe college's dining hall was built in 1877, replacing an older hall in the front quadrangle, which had become too small for the college's population.<ref name=\"ArchitectWeekly\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wgQV3SmmwMsC&pg=PA247 |p=247 |title=The Architect: A Weekly Illustrated Journal of Art, Civil Engineering and Building |volume=18 |publisher=Gilbert Wood & Company, Limited |year=1877}}</ref> Designed by Alfred Waterhouse,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.balliol.ox.ac.uk/Modern%20Papers/pugin.asp |work=Balliol College |title=Drawings of Balliol by Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-1852) |accessdate=27 October 2018}}</ref> the hall is built in geometric style, using [[Bath stone]] and Tisbury stone, with roof and woodwork made of oak.<ref name=\"ArchitectWeekly\"/> The hall features a [[Henry Willis & Sons|Willis]] organ, again instituted by Benjamin Jowett.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.balliol.ox.ac.uk/Modern%20Papers/Jowett/jowett-index1.asp |work=Balliol College |title=Jowett Papers - Biographical Index |accessdate=27 October 2018}}</ref> The old hall became part of the library.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/balliol-library/library-history |work=Balliol College |title=Library History |accessdate=27 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe ground floor contains the college bar and shop, known as \"The Buttery\" (west side) and the Senior Common Room lunch room (east side). The 1966 new Senior Common Room range (Stc XXIII) (northern and eastern sides) was a benefaction of the [[Bernard Sunley|Bernard Sunley Foundation]] and contains some smaller rooms and the principal SCR lounge, replacing Victorian facilities. Below this is a Lecture Room (\"LR XXIII\").\n\nThe east side of the quad is a neighbouring wall with Trinity College, at the southern end is the Master's Garden, in front of the Chapel, and the Fellows' Garden in front of the \"Old\" (Senior) Common Room. The Tower forming the corner between the \"Old Hall\" and \"Old Library\" is also by Salvin, of 1853 and balances that at Stc XVI\u2013XIX.\n\nUnderneath part of the Garden Quad and extending into Trinity were the [[Balliol-Trinity Laboratories]], the most prominent Oxford physical and chemical laboratories in late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in which physical chemist [[Henry Moseley]] (originator of the [[atomic number]]) and [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel Laureate]] [[Cyril Hinshelwood]] worked. These are now disused, following the construction of the university [[Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory (Oxford)|Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory]] on [[South Parks Road]].\n\nThe Garden Quad at Balliol is the scene of the well-known limerick that parodies the [[immaterialist]] philosophy of [[Bishop Berkeley]]:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nThere was a young man who said, God\nMust think it exceedingly odd\nIf he finds that this tree\nStill continues to be\nWhen there's no one about in the Quad.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nand also of the response, by the Balliol-educated Catholic theologian and Bible translator [[Ronald Knox]], which more accurately reflects Berkeley's own beliefs:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nDear Sir, your astonishment's odd:\nI am ''always'' about in the Quad.\nAnd that's why the tree\nWill continue to be,\nSince observed by, Yours faithfully, GOD.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\n===Holywell Manor, Manor Road and Jowett Walk===\nThe majority of research and post-graduate students are housed in the [[Holywell Manor, Oxford|Holywell Manor]] complex, a Grade II listed building acquired by Balliol in 1932 under the direction of [[Kenneth Norman Bell]]. It hosts a collection of artworks by alumni of the college, including a mural by [[Gilbert Spencer]] depicting the college's founding, and hosts a biennial Holywell Manor Festival,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/news/2018/april/holywell-manor-festival-2018|title=Holywell Manor Festival 2018 - Balliol College, University of Oxford|website=Balliol.ox.ac.uk}}</ref> Garden Party, and Garden Play.

Ox.ac.uk. Retrieved on 10 August 2018.</ref> and the Manor forms the centre of this community, providing facilities such as the Middle Common Room (MCR) itself, an extensive garden, TV and computer rooms, music practice rooms, a 'Cockpit' leisure room, and the graduate-student-run 'Megaron' bar. The Manor from 1967 until the full admission of women at Balliol in 1979 was host to the Balliol-St Anne's Graduate Institution, including students from [[St Anne's College, Oxford]]. Former residents include [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Masako, Crown Princess of Japan]].\n\n[[File:Cricket at Balliol 2005-06.jpg|thumb|left|Cricket on the Master's Field with the Jowett Walk buildings in the background]]\nThe 20th century saw several further additions to the college's accommodation, the Martin Building of 1966 ('Holywell ''Minor''', a reference to Holywell Manor, across the road) and the Dellal Building (1986) for graduates on Manor Road.\n\nMany undergraduates and some graduates live in buildings on [[Jowett Walk]] a phased development 1996\u20132004 (Phase 1 completed September 1996, Phase 2 completed July 2004),<ref>{{cite web |title=Jowett Walk project description |publisher=MJP Architects |url=http://www.mjparchitects.co.uk/Jowett_Walk.php |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827004720/http://www.mjparchitects.co.uk/Jowett_Walk.php |archivedate=2009-08-27 }}</ref> containing a small theatre facility, five minutes' walking distance from the main college site; these two developments are on the outskirts of the Master's Field, the sports ground and pavilion facilities of the college. Jowett Walk has also provided accommodation for some non-Balliol undergraduates, as part of an arrangement with [[Wadham College, Oxford]].\n\nFrom 2010 [[St Cross Church, Oxford|St Cross Church]], next to the Manor, has been the college's Historic Collections Centre, an extension to the library's services. The church dates from the 11th or 12th century and is a [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade I listed building]]. This is the third time an Oxford college has incorporated a redundant church as a Library (see [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]] and [[St. Edmund Hall]]).<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1369450 |desc=Church of St Cross  |access-date=9 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017 the college entered into a specialised financial arrangement which enabled it to project a new 200 plus 'study-bedsits' accommodation range at the Master's Field/ Jowett Walk/ St Cross Road site which would also replace the Eastman Professor's House, Martin and Dellal buildings there. This would mean a net increase of approximately 140 rooms fulfilling the college's long-term intention of providing accommodation to all its undergraduates for all their Degree terms and also some rooms for Dons.\n\nThe project includes ten new buildings and a new sports pavilion, including a space for dining, events, spectators and squash courts in the basement. The first building opened in spring 2019 and the completion and occupation of the rest is due by January 2021. In the first phase, work began on the south of the site, at the corner of Jowett Walk and St Cross Road, to provide the accommodation for undergraduates and the new pavilion.\n\n[[File:Oxford StCrossChurch Southwest.jpg|thumb|[[St Cross Church, Oxford|St Cross Church]]]]\n\n==Oxford Internet Institute==\nBalliol College, and its previous Master [[Andrew Graham (academic)|Andrew Graham]], played a major role in 2000\u201301 in setting up the [[Oxford Internet Institute]]. This was the first multidisciplinary research and policy centre in a European university devoted to examining the impact on society of the Internet. It is a department within the [[Social Sciences Division, University of Oxford|Social Sciences Division]] of [[Oxford University]], but is physically located within the grounds of Balliol, and its previous Director ([[William H. Dutton]]) was a Professorial Fellow of Balliol.\n\n==Student life==\n[[File:Balliol 1st VII Headship 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Balliol College rowing to Head of the River in [[Summer Eights]] 2008]]\n\n===Facilities===\nThe college provides its students with facilities including accommodation, the Hall (refectory), a [[library]], two bars, and separate common rooms for the fellows, the [[graduate school|graduates]] and [[undergraduates]]. The JCR provides many services from laundry facilities, one of the few entirely student-run bars left in Oxford (the Manager, Lord/Lady Lindsay, is elected each year by students in the JCR) to a student-run cafeteria known as Pantry. There is a garden quadrangle and a nearby sports ground (the Master's Field) and boathouse. The sports ground is mainly used for [[cricket]], [[tennis]], [[field hockey|hockey]] and [[association football|football]]. [[Croquet]] may be played in the Master's Field or, in the summer term, in the garden quadrangle.\n\nThe majority of undergraduates are housed within the main college or in the modern annexes (Jowett Walk buildings) around the sports ground.  The graduates are housed mainly within [[Holywell Manor, Oxford|Holywell Manor]] which has its own bar, gardens, common room, gym and computing facilities.\n[[File:Balliol College Dining Hall, Oxford - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|Balliol College Dining Hall]]\n\n===Traditions and customs===\n[[File:Balliol College Feb 2005.jpg|thumb|The front of the college in [[Broad Street, Oxford|Broad Street]]]]\n[[File:Balliol College, Oxford building.jpg|thumb|Balliol College Garden]]\n\nAlong with many of the ancient colleges, Balliol has evolved its own traditions and customs over the centuries, many of which occupy a regular calendar slot.\n\nThe [[patron saint]] of the college is [[Saint Catherine of Alexandria]]. On her feast day (25 November), a formal dinner is held for all final year students within Balliol. This festival was well established by 1550. Another important feast is the Snell Dinner. This dinner is held in memory of [[John Snell]], whose benefaction established exhibitions for students from the [[University of Glasgow]] to study at Balliol (the first exhibitioners were matriculated in 1699) one of whom was [[Adam Smith]]. The feast is attended by fellows of Balliol College, the current Snell Exhibitioners, and representatives from Glasgow University and [[St John's College, Cambridge]].\n\nThe MCR has one black-tie dinner each term: the Christmas Dinner in Michaelmas, [[Burns Night]] in Hilary, and the May Dinner in Trinity Term.\n\nBy far the most eccentric event is The Nepotists carol-singing event organised by the college's Arnold and Brackenbury Society. This event happens on the last Friday of [[Michaelmas]] term each year. On this occasion, Balliol students congregate in the college hall to enjoy [[mulled wine]] and the singing of carols. The evening historically ended with a rendition of \"The Gordouli\" (see [[#Balliol\u2013Trinity rivalry|Balliol\u2013Trinity rivalry]] below) on Broad Street, outside the gates of [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]], although in recent years the song has been sung from within the college walls.\n\nA college society which no longer survives is the [[Hysteron Proteron Club]], which aimed to live one day of each term backwards.<ref>John Hely-Hutchinson, ''Carol Symphony: the life and times of Victor Hely-Hutchinson'', [http://www.musicforthemillions.co.za/04-interlude.pdf pp. 39-40]</ref>\n\n===Tortoises===\nBalliol also takes pride in its college tortoises. The original tortoise, who resided at the college for at least 43 years, was known as Rosa, named after the notable [[Germany|German]] [[Marxist]] [[Rosa Luxemburg]]. Each June, pet tortoises from various Oxford colleges are brought to [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]] where they participate in a very slow race; Balliol's own Rosa competed and won many times. Rosa disappeared in the Spring of 2004, and while numerous conspiracy theories have abounded, none is officially recognised by the college. However, on 29 April 2007, [[Chris Skidmore]], a graduate of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] working at the House of Commons, donated a pair of tortoises - one to his own college, and one to Balliol, where he had attended an open day in 1999. The new tortoise, Matilda, died in April 2009. Taking care of the resident tortoise is one of the many tasks assigned to Balliol students each year. This position, known as \"Comrade Tortoise\", has been filled by a student every year.\n\n==People associated with Balliol==\n\n===Notable people===\n{{main|List of Balliol College, Oxford people}}\nBalliol has produced a wide range of graduates in the fields of [[economics]], [[history]], [[law]], [[physiology]], [[medicine]], [[management]], [[humanities]], [[mathematics]], [[science]], [[technology]], [[Mass media|media]], [[philosophy]], [[poetry]], [[politics]], and [[religion]] who have contributed significantly to public life. Balliol people were, for example, prominent in establishing the [[International Baccalaureate]], the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]], the [[Workers Educational Association]], the [[Sir William Beveridge|welfare state]], the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] and [[Amnesty International]].<ref>Near-complete lists of Fellows and students can be found in the published ''Balliol College Register''; the [https://archive.org/details/balliolcollegere01balluoft 1st edition] (1914, covering matriculations 1832\u20131914), [https://www.flickr.com/photos/balliolarchivist/sets/72157625215890252/ 2nd edition] (1934, covering matriculations 1833\u20131933) and [https://www.flickr.com/photos/balliolarchivist/sets/72157625267353054/ 3rd edition] (1953, covering matriculations 1900\u20131950).</ref>\n\nBalliol has produced numerous Nobel Laureates. Five Nobel Laureates were students at Balliol: [[Cyril Norman Hinshelwood]] (Chemistry, 1956), [[John Hicks]] (Economics, 1972), [[Baruch S. Blumberg]] (Physiology or Medicine, 1976), [[Anthony J. Leggett]] (Physics, 2003) and [[Oliver Smithies]] (Physiology or Medicine, 2007). Seven more have been fellows of the college: [[George Beadle]] (Physiology or Medicine, 1958), [[Norman Ramsey]] (Physics, 1989), [[Robert Solow]] (Economics, 1987), [[John Van Vleck]] (Physics, 1977), [[Gunnar Myrdal]] (Economics, 1974), [[Linus Pauling]] (both Peace, 1962, and Chemistry, 1954), and [[William D. Phillips]] (Physics, 1997).\n\nBalliol played an important role in early modern science. The early Newtonian [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]] became [[Savilian Professor of Astronomy]] and a fellow of Balliol in 1692; the mathematician [[James Stirling (mathematician)|James Stirling]], best remembered for [[Stirling's approximation]] for factorials, was an undergraduate at Balliol, a Snell and Warner exhibitioner expelled in 1715 for his correspondence with Jacobites; and the astronomer [[James Bradley]], best known for discovering the [[aberration of light]] and therefore conclusively demonstrating that the speed of light is finite, was a student at Balliol (1711\u20131714), and was appointed [[Savilian Professor of Astronomy]] in 1721 and became the third [[Astronomer Royal]] in 1742.<ref>Jones 2005, pp.&nbsp;148\u2013149.</ref>\n\n[[evolutionary biology|Evolutionary biologist]] [[Richard Dawkins]] was a student there from 1959 to 1962.\n\n[[Andrew Copson]], Chief Executive of [[Humanists UK]] and President of the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]] graduated in 2004.\n\nIn politics, Balliol has produced four [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|British Prime Ministers]]: [[H.

Asquith]], [[Harold Macmillan]],  [[Edward Heath]] and [[Boris Johnson]] as well as politicians with senior leadership positions in the three major political parties, including [[Jo Grimond]], [[Denis Healey]] and [[Roy Jenkins]]. [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] MP, former cabinet minister and [[2015 Labour Party leadership election (UK)|2015 Labour leadership candidate]] [[Yvette Cooper]] and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] MP and government minister [[Rory Stewart]] are current politically prominent alumni. [[Richard von Weizs\u00e4cker]], President of Germany from 1984 to 1994, also studied at Balliol. Royal alumni include [[Empress Masako]] of Japan and [[Harald V of Norway]], after whose donation the JCR is named the Norway Room.\n<!-- \n[[Shoghi Effendi]], one of the appointed leaders of the [[Baha'i Faith]] from 1921 until his death in 1957, studied [[Economics]] and [[Social Sciences]]. -->\n\nIn [[journalism]], the ''[[New Statesman]]'''s political editor [[Stephen Bush]], the ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'''s chief arts writer [[Charlotte Higgins]], and columnist and [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] communications specialist [[Seumas Milne]] are alumni of the college.\n\nIn the law, [[Thomas Bingham]] was the Senior [[Law Lord]] of the [[United Kingdom]], while [[Brian Hutton, Baron Hutton|Brian Hutton]] and [[Alan Rodger, Baron Rodger of Earlsferry|Alan Rodger]] held equivalent positions in [[Northern Ireland]] and [[Scotland]], at one point, all three simultaneously. [[Cressida Dick]] is the current [[Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Commissioner]] of the London [[Metropolitan Police Service]], the first woman to hold this role.\n\nLiterary figures include [[John Minford]], [[Robert Southey]], [[David Aaronovitch]], [[Christopher Hitchens]], [[Matthew Arnold]], [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]], [[Arthur Hugh Clough]], [[Hilaire Belloc]], [[Ronald Knox]], [[Graham Greene]], [[Joseph Macleod]], [[G.

In a speech entitled \"Captain Hook at Eton\" in 1927, [[James M. Barrie]] indicated that [[Captain Hook]] attended Balliol. Among other fictional detectives from Balliol is Dr Gideon Fell, the creation of [[John Dickson Carr]]. Balliol's many crime writers include [[W. J. Burley]], [[Robert Barnard]], [[Tim Heald]] and [[Martin Edwards (author)|Martin Edwards]]. -->\n\nNotable Balliol philosophers include [[Adam Smith]] ([[Snell Exhibitioner]]), [[T. H. Green]], [[J.

Pataudi]] and his son [[Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi|Tiger Pataudi]], both [[India national cricket team|India]] cricket captains and the 8th and 9th [[Nawab of Pataudi|Nawabs of Pataudi]] respectively, were both Balliol graduates who played for the University. US Olympian rower [[Caryn Davies]] received her MBA at Balliol.\n\nBalliol members have predominated as holders of the office of [[List of Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Chancellor]] of the University from the 20th century  to the present; [[George Nathaniel Curzon]], [[Harold Macmillan]], [[Roy Jenkins]] and [[Chris Patten]], the last two being opposed in their election by [[Edward Heath]] and [[Lord Bingham of Cornhill]] respectively. Members of the college have been elected to masterships not only at Balliol but also at other colleges, and include the current Master of [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], [[Jane Stapleton]], a former fellow of Balliol.  \n\n[[Howard Marks]], a convicted drug dealer and later author, attended Balliol between 1964 and 1967 to study physics and then again between 1968 and 1969 to study History and Philosophy of Science.\n\nThe first person documented to brew coffee in England, [[Nathaniel Canopius]], was a Cretan student at Balliol from 1637 to 1648.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Horan |first1=David |title=Oxford: A Cultural and Literary Companion |date=1999 |publisher=Signal Books |isbn=978-1-902669-05-2 |page=67 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wR8nb-LYHBMC&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=oxford+coffee+nathaniel&source=bl&ots=Gbs5DiutVJ&sig=ACfU3U2e5_tOMyxo08cuGXxmbn0jlbV98Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjJmOmH5aHoAhUDU98KHeRLAu4Q6AEwAXoECAwQAQ#v=onepage&q=oxford%20coffee%20nathaniel&f=false |accessdate=17 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n<!--[[Denys Irving (Musician, Filmmaker)|Denys Irving]] attended Balliol reading [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics|PPE]] (1962\u201366).

The college statutes provide for various categories of Fellows and these include both tutorial fellows and professorial fellows. Professorial fellows are those [[professor]]s and [[Reader (academic rank)|readers]] of the university who are allocated to the college by the university. One of these professorships is the [[Beit Professor of Commonwealth History]], which is currently held by [[James Belich (historian)|James Belich]]. The Professorship of Internet Studies is currently held by political scientist [[Philip N. Howard]]. Other professorships include the [[Boden Professor of Sanskrit]] and the [[Montague Burton Professor of International Relations]]. Official Fellows are those who hold tutorial or administrative appointments in the college. There are also senior and junior research fellows. The college can also elect \"distinguished persons\" to honorary fellowships.\n\nThe fellows are supplemented by [[academics]] on short-term contracts. In addition, there are visiting international academics who come to Oxford for periods of up to a year, an example of this is the George Eastman Visiting Professorial Fellowship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/official/staff/senmem/index.asp |title=Balliol Website (Archived) |accessdate=November 5, 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041206190450/http://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/official/staff/senmem/index.asp |archivedate=December 6, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n===Masters===\n[[File:Balliol College Hall and SCR (from Fellows' Garden), Oxford.jpg|thumb|Balliol College Hall and SCR (from Fellows' Garden), Oxford]]\n{{main|List of Masters of Balliol College, Oxford}}\nBalliol College is run by the master and fellows of the college.

The outraged authorities immediately suppressed the collection, and only a few copies survived, three of which found their way into the college library over the years, and one into the [[Bodleian Library]]. Verses of this form are now known as [[Balliol rhyme]]s.\n\nThe best known of these rhymes is the one on [[Benjamin Jowett]]. This has been widely quoted and reprinted in virtually every book about Jowett and about Balliol ever since.\n{{quote|<poem>\nFirst come I.\nMy name is J-W-TT.\nThere's no knowledge but I know it.\nI am Master of this College,\nWhat I don't know isn't knowledge.</poem>}}\n\nThis and 18 others are attributed to [[Henry Charles Beeching]]. The other quatrains are much less well known.\n\n[[William Tuckwell]] included 18 of these quatrains in his ''Reminiscences'' in 1900, but they all came out only in 1939, thanks to Walter George Hiscock, an Oxford librarian, who issued them personally then and in a second edition in 1955.<ref>\"The Balliol rhymes\" by Walter George Hiscock</ref>\n\n===Balliol\u2013Trinity rivalry===\n[[File:Balliol College from Broad Street looking west.jpg|thumb|The frontage of Balliol College as seen from [[Broad Street, Oxford|Broad Street]], looking west]]\nFor many years, there has been a traditional and fierce [[college rivalry|rivalry]] shown between the students of Balliol and those of its immediate neighbour to the east, [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]].<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Clare |last1=Hopkins |first2=Bryan |last2=Ward-Perkins |title=The Trinity/Balliol Feud |journal=Trinity College Oxford Report |date=1989\u201390 |pages=45\u201366 }}</ref> It has manifested itself on the sports field and the river; in the form of songs (of varying degrees of offensiveness) sung over the dividing walls; and in the form of \"raids\" on the other college. The rivalry reflects that which also exists between [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] and Balliol's sister college, [[St John's College, Cambridge]].\n\nIn college [[folklore]], the rivalry goes back to the late 17th century, when [[Ralph Bathurst]], President of Trinity, was supposedly observed throwing stones at Balliol's windows.<ref>Hopkins and Ward-Perkins, \"Trinity/Balliol Feud\", p. 45.</ref> In fact, in its modern form, the rivalry appears to date from the late 1890s, when the chant or song known as a \"Gordouli\" began to be sung from the Balliol side.<ref>For the Gordouli, see {{cite journal |first=G.

The traditional Gordouli is said to have been sung by Balliol and Trinity men in the trenches of [[Mesopotamian campaign|Mesopotamia]] in the [[World War I|First World War]].<ref>Knight, \"Quest for Gordouli\".</ref>\n\nBalliol became known for its radicalism and political activism in the 20th century, and saw an abortive coup in the 1960s in which students took over the college and declared it \"the People's Republic of Balliol\".<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Chris |editor-last=Baraniuk |title=The Oxford University Alternative Prospectus |date=December 2010 |page=34 }}</ref> The contrast between the [[Left-wing politics|radical]] tendencies of many Balliol students and the traditional conservatism and social exclusivity of Trinity gave the rivalry an extra edge. The fact that Balliol (in contrast to Trinity) had admitted a number of Indian and Asiatic students also gave many of the taunts from the Trinity side a distinctly [[Racism|racist]] tone: Balliol students, for example, were sometime referred to as \"[[Sotho people|Basutos]]\".<ref>Hopkins and Ward-Perkins, \"Trinity/Balliol Feud\", pp. 54\u201360.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Five Red Herrings]]'' (1931), a [[Lord Peter Wimsey]] novel by [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville]] alumna [[Dorothy L.

[[New College, Oxford|New College]] had in 1964 resolved to admit women, but had been prevented from doing so without the approval of the university, which argued that this would be detrimental to the existing women's colleges. On 2 June 1971 a consilium at Balliol voted 26-2 to admit women, and at the next college meeting on 6 December 1971 it was resolved 30-8 to admit women 'as soon as the change in its Statutes permitting this was approved by the Privy Council'. Permission was granted by the university on 8 March 1977.  With the appointment of Carol Clark to a Tutorial Fellowship in Modern Languages in 1973, Balliol became the first ancient all-male college to appoint a female fellow.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/news/2015/july/obituary-for-carol-clark|title=Obituary for Carol Clark - Balliol College, University of Oxford|website=Balliol.ox.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\nBefore the full admission of women as undergraduates, the college had decided to establish a co-educational graduate institution. The decision was made on 16 March 1964, and the senior tutor approached  [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's College]] shortly after this. The creation of the Balliol\u2013St Anne's Graduate Institution with St Anne's in 1967 led to the coeducation of men and women on the [[Holywell Manor]] site. Following the arrival of women at Balliol and men at St Anne's in 1979, the joint Graduate Institution was terminated in 1984 by the consent of both colleges. Holywell Manor is now solely a part of Balliol College.\n\nIn 1979, along with many other previously all-male colleges, Balliol accepted its first cohort of female students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/about-balliol/remarkable-alumni/balliol-women-some-alumnae-of-the-college|title=Balliol Women: Some Alumnae of the College {{!}} Balliol College, University of Oxford|website=Balliol.ox.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-04}}</ref> The first woman undergraduate to reside at Balliol was Elena Ceva-Valla, who arrived on 16 September 1979.

The ground floor is the Old Senior Common Room. Balliol's second library pre-dates the publication of printed books in Europe. There is a possibility that the original Master's Chamber, south west side, adorned with a fine oriel window, is earlier than these; it is now the Master's Dining Room.\n\nThe Chapel is the third (perhaps fourth) on the site and was designed by [[William Butterfield]] in 1857.\n\n[[Alfred Waterhouse]] designed the main [[Broad Street, Oxford|Broad Street]] frontage of the college (1867\u201368), along with gateway and tower, known as the Brackenbury Buildings after philanthropist and donor [[Hannah Brackenbury]], replacing earlier structures (Staircases I\u2013VII). The first staircase next to the Chapel contains the Organ Scholar's lodgings.\n\n===Garden Quadrangle===\nSouth-side is the front part of the Master's Lodgings on Broad Street from the Waterhouse improvements of the 1860s of the front quad. The neighbour to this is the Fisher Building of 1759 (Stc X) The undistinguished looking Stc XI, south west side, is in fact the oldest structure in this quadrangle, 1720, originally intended as accommodation for scholars from Bristol, hence its name. Continuing the west-side Stc XII\u2013XIV dates from 1826, by [[George Basevi]], and marks the beginnings of the college's academic renaissance being required for the increasing number of Commoners applying for places. Stc XV by Warren of 1912 filled in the last gap of the quadrangle; the ground floor and basement is the principal Junior Common Room. This unfortunately obscures the lines of the Salvin designed Stc XVI\u2013XIX with Tower of 1853. As does the 1968 building by Beard Stc XX, replacing a Victorian structure. This completely hides a formal gateway similar to that at the Broad Street main entrance, this can be viewed outside from Little Magdalen Street, through the gap marked XIX one finds the small function room \"Massey Room\". At north side, of Stc XX is the \"Back Gate\" which is part of the 1906 Warren building, west and north side, Stc XXI. 1 St Giles' is its neighbour which is part of the college and houses the [[Oxford Internet Institute]]. Beard's Stc XXII replaces Victorian rooms, which were provided from the Vivian Bulkeley-Johnson benefaction. Beard's Stc XX and XXII are connected by the Snell Bridge accommodation at third floor level, which was provided from Glasgow University's Snell Benefaction.\n\nThe college's dining hall was built in 1877, replacing an older hall in the front quadrangle, which had become too small for the college's population.<ref name=\"ArchitectWeekly\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wgQV3SmmwMsC&pg=PA247 |p=247 |title=The Architect: A Weekly Illustrated Journal of Art, Civil Engineering and Building |volume=18 |publisher=Gilbert Wood & Company, Limited |year=1877}}</ref> Designed by Alfred Waterhouse,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.balliol.ox.ac.uk/Modern%20Papers/pugin.asp |work=Balliol College |title=Drawings of Balliol by Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin (1812-1852) |accessdate=27 October 2018}}</ref> the hall is built in geometric style, using [[Bath stone]] and Tisbury stone, with roof and woodwork made of oak.<ref name=\"ArchitectWeekly\"/> The hall features a [[Henry Willis & Sons|Willis]] organ, again instituted by Benjamin Jowett.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archives.balliol.ox.ac.uk/Modern%20Papers/Jowett/jowett-index1.asp |work=Balliol College |title=Jowett Papers - Biographical Index |accessdate=27 October 2018}}</ref> The old hall became part of the library.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/balliol-library/library-history |work=Balliol College |title=Library History |accessdate=27 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe ground floor contains the college bar and shop, known as \"The Buttery\" (west side) and the Senior Common Room lunch room (east side). The 1966 new Senior Common Room range (Stc XXIII) (northern and eastern sides) was a benefaction of the [[Bernard Sunley|Bernard Sunley Foundation]] and contains some smaller rooms and the principal SCR lounge, replacing Victorian facilities. Below this is a Lecture Room (\"LR XXIII\").\n\nThe east side of the quad is a neighbouring wall with Trinity College, at the southern end is the Master's Garden, in front of the Chapel, and the Fellows' Garden in front of the \"Old\" (Senior) Common Room. The Tower forming the corner between the \"Old Hall\" and \"Old Library\" is also by Salvin, of 1853 and balances that at Stc XVI\u2013XIX.\n\nUnderneath part of the Garden Quad and extending into Trinity were the [[Balliol-Trinity Laboratories]], the most prominent Oxford physical and chemical laboratories in late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, in which physical chemist [[Henry Moseley]] (originator of the [[atomic number]]) and [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel Laureate]] [[Cyril Hinshelwood]] worked. These are now disused, following the construction of the university [[Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory (Oxford)|Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory]] on [[South Parks Road]].\n\nThe Garden Quad at Balliol is the scene of the well-known limerick that parodies the [[immaterialist]] philosophy of [[Bishop Berkeley]]:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nThere was a young man who said, God\nMust think it exceedingly odd\nIf he finds that this tree\nStill continues to be\nWhen there's no one about in the Quad.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\nand also of the response, by the Balliol-educated Catholic theologian and Bible translator [[Ronald Knox]], which more accurately reflects Berkeley's own beliefs:\n\n<blockquote><poem>\nDear Sir, your astonishment's odd:\nI am ''always'' about in the Quad.\nAnd that's why the tree\nWill continue to be,\nSince observed by, Yours faithfully, GOD.\n</poem></blockquote>\n\n===Holywell Manor, Manor Road and Jowett Walk===\nThe majority of research and post-graduate students are housed in the [[Holywell Manor, Oxford|Holywell Manor]] complex, a Grade II listed building acquired by Balliol in 1932 under the direction of [[Kenneth Norman Bell]]. It hosts a collection of artworks by alumni of the college, including a mural by [[Gilbert Spencer]] depicting the college's founding, and hosts a biennial Holywell Manor Festival,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/news/2018/april/holywell-manor-festival-2018|title=Holywell Manor Festival 2018 - Balliol College, University of Oxford|website=Balliol.ox.ac.uk}}</ref> Garden Party, and Garden Play.

The Manor from 1967 until the full admission of women at Balliol in 1979 was host to the Balliol-St Anne's Graduate Institution, including students from [[St Anne's College, Oxford]].

Jowett Walk has also provided accommodation for some non-Balliol undergraduates, as part of an arrangement with [[Wadham College, Oxford]].\n\nFrom 2010 [[St Cross Church, Oxford|St Cross Church]], next to the Manor, has been the college's Historic Collections Centre, an extension to the library's services. The church dates from the 11th or 12th century and is a [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade I listed building]]. This is the third time an Oxford college has incorporated a redundant church as a Library (see [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]] and [[St. Edmund Hall]]).<ref>{{National Heritage List for England |num=1369450 |desc=Church of St Cross  |access-date=9 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017 the college entered into a specialised financial arrangement which enabled it to project a new 200 plus 'study-bedsits' accommodation range at the Master's Field/ Jowett Walk/ St Cross Road site which would also replace the Eastman Professor's House, Martin and Dellal buildings there. This would mean a net increase of approximately 140 rooms fulfilling the college's long-term intention of providing accommodation to all its undergraduates for all their Degree terms and also some rooms for Dons.\n\nThe project includes ten new buildings and a new sports pavilion, including a space for dining, events, spectators and squash courts in the basement. The first building opened in spring 2019 and the completion and occupation of the rest is due by January 2021. In the first phase, work began on the south of the site, at the corner of Jowett Walk and St Cross Road, to provide the accommodation for undergraduates and the new pavilion.\n\n[[File:Oxford StCrossChurch Southwest.jpg|thumb|[[St Cross Church, Oxford|St Cross Church]]]]\n\n==Oxford Internet Institute==\nBalliol College, and its previous Master [[Andrew Graham (academic)|Andrew Graham]], played a major role in 2000\u201301 in setting up the [[Oxford Internet Institute]]. This was the first multidisciplinary research and policy centre in a European university devoted to examining the impact on society of the Internet. It is a department within the [[Social Sciences Division, University of Oxford|Social Sciences Division]] of [[Oxford University]], but is physically located within the grounds of Balliol, and its previous Director ([[William H.

The JCR provides many services from laundry facilities, one of the few entirely student-run bars left in Oxford (the Manager, Lord/Lady Lindsay, is elected each year by students in the JCR) to a student-run cafeteria known as Pantry. There is a garden quadrangle and a nearby sports ground (the Master's Field) and boathouse. The sports ground is mainly used for [[cricket]], [[tennis]], [[field hockey|hockey]] and [[association football|football]]. [[Croquet]] may be played in the Master's Field or, in the summer term, in the garden quadrangle.\n\nThe majority of undergraduates are housed within the main college or in the modern annexes (Jowett Walk buildings) around the sports ground.  The graduates are housed mainly within [[Holywell Manor, Oxford|Holywell Manor]] which has its own bar, gardens, common room, gym and computing facilities.\n[[File:Balliol College Dining Hall, Oxford - Diliff.jpg|thumb|right|Balliol College Dining Hall]]\n\n===Traditions and customs===\n[[File:Balliol College Feb 2005.jpg|thumb|The front of the college in [[Broad Street, Oxford|Broad Street]]]]\n[[File:Balliol College, Oxford building.jpg|thumb|Balliol College Garden]]\n\nAlong with many of the ancient colleges, Balliol has evolved its own traditions and customs over the centuries, many of which occupy a regular calendar slot.\n\nThe [[patron saint]] of the college is [[Saint Catherine of Alexandria]]. On her feast day (25 November), a formal dinner is held for all final year students within Balliol. This festival was well established by 1550. Another important feast is the Snell Dinner. This dinner is held in memory of [[John Snell]], whose benefaction established exhibitions for students from the [[University of Glasgow]] to study at Balliol (the first exhibitioners were matriculated in 1699) one of whom was [[Adam Smith]]. The feast is attended by fellows of Balliol College, the current Snell Exhibitioners, and representatives from Glasgow University and [[St John's College, Cambridge]].\n\nThe MCR has one black-tie dinner each term: the Christmas Dinner in Michaelmas, [[Burns Night]] in Hilary, and the May Dinner in Trinity Term.\n\nBy far the most eccentric event is The Nepotists carol-singing event organised by the college's Arnold and Brackenbury Society. This event happens on the last Friday of [[Michaelmas]] term each year. On this occasion, Balliol students congregate in the college hall to enjoy [[mulled wine]] and the singing of carols. The evening historically ended with a rendition of \"The Gordouli\" (see [[#Balliol\u2013Trinity rivalry|Balliol\u2013Trinity rivalry]] below) on Broad Street, outside the gates of [[Trinity College, Oxford|Trinity College]], although in recent years the song has been sung from within the college walls.\n\nA college society which no longer survives is the [[Hysteron Proteron Club]], which aimed to live one day of each term backwards.<ref>John Hely-Hutchinson, ''Carol Symphony: the life and times of Victor Hely-Hutchinson'', [http://www.musicforthemillions.co.za/04-interlude.pdf pp. 39-40]</ref>\n\n===Tortoises===\nBalliol also takes pride in its college tortoises. The original tortoise, who resided at the college for at least 43 years, was known as Rosa, named after the notable [[Germany|German]] [[Marxist]] [[Rosa Luxemburg]]. Each June, pet tortoises from various Oxford colleges are brought to [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford|Corpus Christi College]] where they participate in a very slow race; Balliol's own Rosa competed and won many times. Rosa disappeared in the Spring of 2004, and while numerous conspiracy theories have abounded, none is officially recognised by the college. However, on 29 April 2007, [[Chris Skidmore]], a graduate of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] working at the House of Commons, donated a pair of tortoises - one to his own college, and one to Balliol, where he had attended an open day in 1999. The new tortoise, Matilda, died in April 2009. Taking care of the resident tortoise is one of the many tasks assigned to Balliol students each year. This position, known as \"Comrade Tortoise\", has been filled by a student every year.\n\n==People associated with Balliol==\n\n===Notable people===\n{{main|List of Balliol College, Oxford people}}\nBalliol has produced a wide range of graduates in the fields of [[economics]], [[history]], [[law]], [[physiology]], [[medicine]], [[management]], [[humanities]], [[mathematics]], [[science]], [[technology]], [[Mass media|media]], [[philosophy]], [[poetry]], [[politics]], and [[religion]] who have contributed significantly to public life.

In a speech entitled \"Captain Hook at Eton\" in 1927, [[James M. Barrie]] indicated that [[Captain Hook]] attended Balliol. Among other fictional detectives from Balliol is Dr Gideon Fell, the creation of [[John Dickson Carr]]. Balliol's many crime writers include [[W. J.

Pataudi]] and his son [[Mansoor Ali Khan Pataudi|Tiger Pataudi]], both [[India national cricket team|India]] cricket captains and the 8th and 9th [[Nawab of Pataudi|Nawabs of Pataudi]] respectively, were both Balliol graduates who played for the University. US Olympian rower [[Caryn Davies]] received her MBA at Balliol.\n\nBalliol members have predominated as holders of the office of [[List of Chancellors of the University of Oxford|Chancellor]] of the University from the 20th century  to the present; [[George Nathaniel Curzon]], [[Harold Macmillan]], [[Roy Jenkins]] and [[Chris Patten]], the last two being opposed in their election by [[Edward Heath]] and [[Lord Bingham of Cornhill]] respectively. Members of the college have been elected to masterships not only at Balliol but also at other colleges, and include the current Master of [[Christ's College, Cambridge]], [[Jane Stapleton]], a former fellow of Balliol.  \n\n[[Howard Marks]], a convicted drug dealer and later author, attended Balliol between 1964 and 1967 to study physics and then again between 1968 and 1969 to study History and Philosophy of Science.\n\nThe first person documented to brew coffee in England, [[Nathaniel Canopius]], was a Cretan student at Balliol from 1637-1648.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Horan |first1=David |title=Oxford: A Cultural and Literary Companion |date=1999 |publisher=Signal Books |isbn=978-1-902669-05-2 |page=67 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wR8nb-LYHBMC&pg=PA67&lpg=PA67&dq=oxford+coffee+nathaniel&source=bl&ots=Gbs5DiutVJ&sig=ACfU3U2e5_tOMyxo08cuGXxmbn0jlbV98Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjJmOmH5aHoAhUDU98KHeRLAu4Q6AEwAXoECAwQAQ#v=onepage&q=oxford%20coffee%20nathaniel&f=false |accessdate=17 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n<!--[[Denys Irving (Musician, Filmmaker)|Denys Irving]] attended Balliol reading [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics|PPE]] (1962\u201366).

The college statutes provide for various categories of Fellows and these include both tutorial fellows and professorial fellows. Professorial fellows are those [[professor]]s and [[Reader (academic rank)|readers]] of the university who are allocated to the college by the university. One of these professorships is the [[Beit Professor of Commonwealth History]], which is currently held by [[James Belich (historian)|James Belich]]. The Professorship of Internet Studies is currently held by political scientist [[Philip N. Howard]]. Other professorships include the [[Boden Professor of Sanskrit]] and the [[Montague Burton Professor of International Relations]]. Official Fellows are those who hold tutorial or administrative appointments in the college. There are also senior and junior research fellows. The college can also elect \"distinguished persons\" to honorary fellowships.\n\nThe fellows are supplemented by [[academics]] on short-term contracts. In addition, there are visiting international academics who come to Oxford for periods of up to a year, an example of this is the George Eastman Visiting Professorial Fellowship.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/official/staff/senmem/index.asp |title=Balliol Website (Archived) |accessdate=November 5, 2004 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041206190450/http://www.balliol.ox.ac.uk/official/staff/senmem/index.asp |archivedate=December 6, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n===Masters===\n[[File:Balliol College Hall and SCR (from Fellows' Garden), Oxford.jpg|thumb|Balliol College Hall and SCR (from Fellows' Garden), Oxford]]\n{{main|List of Masters of Balliol College, Oxford}}\nBalliol College is run by the master and fellows of the college.
