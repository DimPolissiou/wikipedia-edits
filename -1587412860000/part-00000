In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', [[Collector (comics)|the Collector]] explains that the Infinity Stones are the remnants of six singularities that existed before the [[Big Bang]], which were compressed into Stones by cosmic entities after the universe began and were dispersed throughout the cosmos. In ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', it is further explained by [[Wong (comics)|Wong]] and [[Doctor Strange]] that each stone embodies and controls an essential aspect of existence. Throughout the series, the Mad Titan Thanos seeks to collect them all and use them to wipe out half of all life in the universe, believing that his plan will save it from extinction. Having completed this goal in ''Infinity War'', Thanos then uses the Stones' power to destroy them so that his actions cannot be undone. Despite this, in ''Endgame'', the Avengers use the quantum realm to travel back in time to the years 1970, 2012, 2013, and 2014 and retrieve past versions of the Stones, allowing them to restore the half of all life in the universe Thanos killed. However, a past version of the Mad Titan is able to follow them to the present and, believing that his plan only failed because the survivors were unable to 'move on' from the losses, attempts to use the Past Infinity Stones to destroy and recreate the universe. During the resulting full-scale battle between the Avengers and Thanos, Tony Stark claims the Past Infinity Stones and uses them to destroy Thanos and his fleet, although this act costs Stark his life. Steve Rogers subsequently returns the Past Infinity Stones and Past Mjolnir (which Thor had acquired from 2013) to the points in time the Avengers had taken them from to keep any alternate timelines from forming. \n\nIn order of introduction, they are:\n\n* '''Space Stone''' (Blue):<br />Housed in a cube-like object called the '''[[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]]''', the Space Stone first appears briefly in the [[post-credits scene]] of ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', with [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] showing the object to [[Erik Selvig]], not knowing that Loki was there as well. In ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', the [[Red Skull]] steals the Tesseract from a church and uses it to power [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]'s weaponry during WWII. Amidst Captain America's final fight with the Red Skull, the Tesseract transported the latter to another location (later revealed to be the planet Vormir in ''Avengers: Infinity War'') before falling into the Arctic Ocean where it was later recovered by [[Howard Stark]] and taken to a secret base. ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' revealed that [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Dr. Wendy Lawson]] tried to use the Tesseract in 1989 to unlock light-speed travel in order to help the [[Skrulls]] find a new home, but was unsuccessful, although her experiments resulted in [[Carol Danvers]] being granted with superhuman strength, flight, and the ability to generate energy blasts.

Immediately afterwards, the Avengers are besieged by a past version of Thanos and his army, with the Mad Titan now intending to use the Past Infinity Stones to destroy the universe and build it anew once he erases all memory of the original out of revenge for them attempting to undo his work.

In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', [[Collector (comics)|the Collector]] explains that the Infinity Stones are the remnants of six singularities that existed before the [[Big Bang]], which were compressed into Stones by cosmic entities after the universe began and were dispersed throughout the cosmos. In ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'', it is further explained by [[Wong (comics)|Wong]] and [[Doctor Strange]] that each stone embodies and controls an essential aspect of existence. Throughout the series, the Mad Titan Thanos seeks to collect them all and use them to wipe out half of all life in the universe, believing that his plan will save it from extinction. Having completed this goal in ''Infinity War'', Thanos then uses the Stones' power to destroy them so that his actions cannot be undone. Despite this, in ''Endgame'', the Avengers use the quantum realm to travel back in time to the years 1970, 2012, 2013, and 2014 and retrieve past versions of the Stones, allowing them to restore the half of all life in the universe Thanos killed. However, a past version of the Mad Titan is able to follow them to the present and, believing that his plan only failed because the survivors were unable to 'move on' from the losses, attempts to use the Past Infinity Stones to destroy and recreate the universe. During the resulting full-scale battle between the Avengers and Thanos, Tony Stark claims the Past Infinity Stones and uses them to destroy Thanos and his fleet, although this act costs Stark his life. Steve Rogers subsequently returns the Past Infinity Stones and Past Mjolnir (which Thor had acquired from 2013) to the points in time the Avengers had taken them from to keep any alternate timelines from forming. \n\nIn order of introduction, they are:\n\n* '''Space Stone''' (Blue):<br />Housed in a cube-like object called the '''[[Cosmic Cube|Tesseract]]''', the Space Stone first appears briefly in the [[post-credits scene]] of ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'', with [[Nick Fury (Ultimate Marvel character)|Nick Fury]] showing the object to [[Erik Selvig]], not knowing that Loki was there as well. In ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'', the [[Red Skull]] steals the Tesseract from a church and uses it to power [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]'s weaponry during WWII. Amidst Captain America's final fight with the Red Skull, the Tesseract transported the latter to another location (later revealed to be the planet Vormir in ''Avengers: Infinity War'') before falling into the Arctic Ocean where it was later recovered by [[Howard Stark]] and taken to a secret base. ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'' revealed that [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Dr. Wendy Lawson]] tried to use the Tesseract in 1989 to unlock light-speed travel in order to help the [[Skrulls]] find a new home, but was unsuccessful, although her experiments resulted in [[Carol Danvers]] being granted with superhuman strength, flight, and the ability to generate energy blasts. Danvers eventually recovers the Tesseract and hands the object over to [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]], although it was temporally swallowed by Goose (a Flerken disguised as a cat), who later vomits it out on Nick Fury's desk. In ''The Avengers'', the Tesseract is shown to be capable of generating [[wormhole]]s after [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] steals it from S.H.I.E.L.D. and uses it to transport the [[Chitauri]] army to New York City in an attempt to conquer Earth. After the Avengers repel the invasion, Thor returns it to [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]] for safekeeping in [[Odin (comics)|Odin]]'s Vault and it is used to repair the Bifrost Bridge, which had been destroyed during the events of ''Thor''.<ref name=\"StoneDescriptions\">{{cite web |url=http://screenrant.com/doctor-strange-infinity-stone/2/ |title=Will Marvel's Doctor Strange Introduce Another Infinity Stone? |last=Keyes |first=Rob |website=Screen Rant |date=December 31, 2015 |accessdate=February 22, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103015144/http://screenrant.com/doctor-strange-infinity-stone/2/ |archivedate=January 3, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Loki later steals the Tesseract once more before Asgard's destruction during ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ew.com/movies/avengers-infinity-war-exclusive-photos/loki-pays-a-debt |title=Avengers: Infinity War unleashes 8 exclusive new photos \u2013 Loki Pays a Debt |last=Breznican |first=Anthony |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=March 8, 2018 |accessdate=March 8, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309120323/http://ew.com/movies/avengers-infinity-war-exclusive-photos/loki-pays-a-debt/ |archivedate=March 9, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> and gives the object to [[Thanos]] in ''Avengers: Infinity War'' to save Thor's life.

In ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'', [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Tony Stark]], [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Steve Rogers]], [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] and [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] time travel to the Battle of New York during the events of ''The Avengers'' in 2012, where Stark and Lang attempt to steal the 2012 version of the Tesseract before it can be returned to Asgard in the aftermath of the battle, but 2012 Hulk accidentally knocks Stark down and the 2012 Tesseract slides over to 2012 Loki, who uses it to open a wormhole and escape. Stark and Rogers then travel to 1970 and steal the 1970 version of the Tesseract from a S.H.I.E.L.D. base in New Jersey (also retrieving new samples of Pym Particles to travel back) and use a stolen briefcase to sneak it out. The 1970 Space Stone is then brought back to the present time and (having been removed from the 1970 Tesseract) used to undo Thanos' actions and to disintegrate 2014 Thanos and his forces from existence. Rogers later returns the 1970 Space Stone to 1970 New Jersey.\n* '''Mind Stone''' (Yellow):<br />Housed in a scepter, the Mind Stone was first seen in ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' when Thanos and the Other give Loki said scepter to help locate the Tesseract and conquer Earth with its ability to control people's minds and project energy blasts.<ref name=\"MindStone\">{{cite web |url=http://comicbook.com/2016/11/02/marvel-cinematic-universe-infinity-stones-power-space-mind-time-/ |title=Marvel Cinematic Universe Infinity Stones: What They Do and Where They Are \u2013 The Mind Stone (Spoilers) |last=Outlaw |first=Kofi |website=Comicbook.com |date=November 2, 2016 |accessdate=November 17, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170919203524/http://comicbook.com/2016/11/02/marvel-cinematic-universe-infinity-stones-power-space-mind-time-/4|archive-date=September 19, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> After Loki's defeat, the scepter fell into the hands of Hydra leader Baron [[Baron Strucker|Wolfgang von Strucker]], who is shown in the mid-credits scene of ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' to have been using it to experiment on humans. ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' revealed that the only surviving subjects of Strucker's experiments are the siblings [[Quicksilver (comics)|Pietro]] and [[Wanda Maximoff (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Wanda Maximoff]], in whom superhuman abilities were unlocked before Strucker's base was attacked by the Avengers, who took back the scepter. The scepter is later revealed to contain the Mind Stone, which itself contains an artificial intelligence that grants sentience to the computer program [[Ultron]], who steals the scepter and removes the Mind Stone to create a newly upgraded body. The Avengers steal the Mind Stone-infused body from Ultron and upload the A.I.

In ''Avengers: Endgame'', after Thanos wipes out half of all life in the universe with the Infinity Stones \u2013 in the event that is now known as \"The Blip\" \u2013 and destroys them to prevent his work from being undone, the Avengers use nanotechnology to create a third, right-handed gauntlet in order to use the Infinity Stones they had acquired from the past. Bruce Banner in his \"Professor Hulk\" form, due to being the most immune to the gamma radiation the Infinity Stones' combined powers emit, uses the gauntlet to reverse the Blip (though not without strain also caused by the combined powers). Immediately afterwards, the Avengers are besieged by a past version of Thanos and his army, with the Mad Titan now intending to use the Past Infinity Stones to destroy the universe and build it anew once he erases all memory of the original out of revenge for them attempting to undo his work. In the ensuing battle, Tony Stark sacrifices himself by using the Past Infinity Stones\u2014having incorporated them into his armor\u2014to disintegrate Past Thanos and his forces; removing them from the timeline altogether. After Stark's funeral, Steve Rogers returns the Past Infinity Stones (without the Tesseract, scepter, orb, and with the Past Reality Stone remaining in its solid form) and a past version of Mjolnir that Thor took from 2013 to the times and places they'd come from to prevent alternate timelines from forming.\n\n===Video games===\n* The Infinity Gems are featured in some games developed by [[Capcom]]:\n** The gems are featured in ''[[Marvel Super Heroes In War of the Gems]]'' (based on the \"[[The Infinity Gauntlet|Infinity Gauntlet]]\" saga) and ''[[Marvel Super Heroes (arcade game)|Marvel Super Heroes]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://psx.ign.com/reviews/160.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000413054935/http://psx.ign.com/reviews/160.html |title=Marvel Super Heroes Review |website=IGN |date=1997-09-30 |archivedate=2000-04-13 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=mmygind |url=http://lasttokengaming.com/retro-review-marvel-super-heroes-war-of-the-gems-1996-capcom-super-nintendo/ |title=Retro Review: 'Marvel Super Heroes: War of the Gems' (1996, Capcom, Super Nintendo) |website=Last Token Gaming |date=2015-06-08 |accessdate=2016-12-15}}</ref>\n** The Infinity Gems are seen in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]'' when Thanos uses Power, Soul, Reality, and Space for his Supers.\n** The Infinity Stones play a major role in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite]]''.

Within natural forest areas, they tend to use areas with higher elevation, lower annual rainfall, farther from forest edge, and closer to forest centres. They prefer forest with dense understory cover and steep slope, and they strongly avoid forest areas with high human influence in the forms of encroachment and settlement. In acacia plantations, they tend to use areas closer to water, and prefer areas with older plants, more leaf litter, and thicker subcanopy cover. Tiger records in oil palm plantations and in [[rubber plantation]]s are scarce. The availability of adequate vegetation cover at the ground level serves as an environmental condition fundamentally needed by tigers regardless of the location. Without adequate understory cover, tigers are even more vulnerable to persecution by humans. Human disturbance-related variables negatively affect tiger occupancy and habitat use. Variables with strong impacts include settlement and encroachment within forest areas, [[logging]], and the intensity of maintenance in acacia plantations.<ref name=Sunarto2012>{{cite journal|author=Sunarto |author2=Kelly, M.

Within natural forest areas, they tend to use areas with higher elevation, lower annual rainfall, farther from forest edge, and closer to forest centres. They prefer forest with dense understory cover and steep slope, and they strongly avoid forest areas with high human influence in the forms of encroachment and settlement. In acacia plantations, they tend to use areas closer to water, and prefer areas with older plants, more leaf litter, and thicker subcanopy cover. Tiger records in oil palm plantations and in [[rubber plantation]]s are scarce. The availability of adequate vegetation cover at the ground level serves as an environmental condition fundamentally needed by tigers regardless of the location. Without adequate understory cover, tigers are even more vulnerable to persecution by humans. Human disturbance-related variables negatively affect tiger occupancy and habitat use. Variables with strong impacts include settlement and encroachment within forest areas, [[logging]], and the intensity of maintenance in acacia plantations.<ref name=Sunarto2012>{{cite journal|author=Sunarto |author2=Kelly, M.

Donahue's face was on the cover and the inside fashion editorial of countless fashion magazines including [[Vogue (magazine)|American ''Vogue'']], [[Vogue Paris|French ''Vogue'']], ''[[Vogue Italia]]'', [[Vogue (British magazine)|British ''Vogue'']], ''[[Italian Bazaar]]'', ''Mademoiselle'', ''[[Self (magazine)|Self]]'', ''[[Redbook]]'', ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' and the ''[[New York Times]]'' and, more recently, ''[[More!]]'' magazine. Donahue was the face for [[Helena Rubenstein]]'s beauty campaign in the UK and [[Virginia Slims]] in the USA.\n\nDonahue often did the Paris collections for American Vogue along with Gia Carangi, [[Joan Severance]] and [[Kelly Le Brock]]. She also did some runway work in her early career for [[Calvin Klein]], [[Ralph Lauren]], [[Donna Karan]] and [[Perry Ellis]] in New York and [[Hong Kong]]. Donahue also did countless catalogs for [[Lord and Taylor]], [[Neiman Marcus]] and [[Bloomingdale's]]. She has worked with numerous photographers including [[Francesco Scavullo]], [[Irving Penn]], [[Steve Landis]], [[Arthur Elgort]], [[Denis Piel]] and [[Patrick Demarchelier]].\n\nNancy co-authored ONE on ONE with her former husband, the fashion model, [[Jeff Aquilon]], published by [[Simon & Schuster]], a best-selling book about two people giving to each other physically and emotionally.\n\nDonahue was the Pastry Chef at Bianco's Catering Company in [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts]] for the ten years where she won numerous awards for her pastry at different events.\n\n== Model mismanagement ==\n\nDonahue hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons in 1995 when the head of Elite Model Management, John Casablancas, blamed her for recommending David Weil to her as an experienced money manager. Casablancas claimed that the recommendation from Donahue was so good that he never investigated Weil further, nor did he search into the background of his business partner, Peter Bucchieri. The two operated a firm, Star Capital, within Elite's offices and managed many of the model's financial portfolios. They were subsequently accused of mismanaging the funds. On September 21, 1997, Bucchieri, pleaded guilty to conspiring with Weil to sell fictitious Colorado real estate investments to the models. Bucchieri was sentenced to 33 months in prison.  It was subsequently discovered that they had transferred many of the model's funds to their own bank accounts and used it to pay personal bills and make purchases, including a new Porsche.

Donahue's face was on the cover and the inside fashion editorial of countless fashion magazines including [[Vogue (magazine)|American ''Vogue'']], [[Vogue Paris|French ''Vogue'']], ''[[Vogue Italia]]'', [[Vogue (British magazine)|British ''Vogue'']], ''[[Italian Bazaar]]'', ''Mademoiselle'', ''[[Self (magazine)|Self]]'', ''[[Redbook]]'', ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'' and the ''[[New York Times]]'' and, more recently, ''[[More!]]'' magazine. Donahue was the face for [[Helena Rubenstein]]'s beauty campaign in the UK and [[Virginia Slims]] in the USA.\n\nDonahue often did the Paris collections for American Vogue along with Gia Carangi, [[Joan Severance]] and [[Kelly Le Brock]]. She also did some runway work in her early career for [[Calvin Klein]], [[Ralph Lauren]], [[Donna Karan]] and [[Perry Ellis]] in New York and [[Hong Kong]]. Donahue also did countless catalogs for [[Lord and Taylor]], [[Neiman Marcus]] and [[Bloomingdale's]]. She has worked with numerous photographers including [[Francesco Scavullo]], [[Irving Penn]], [[Steve Landis]], [[Arthur Elgort]], [[Denis Piel]] and [[Patrick Demarchelier]].\n\nNancy co-authored ONE on ONE with her former husband, the fashion model, [[Jeff Aquilon]], published by [[Simon & Schuster]], a best-selling book about two people giving to each other physically and emotionally.\n\nDonahue was the Pastry Chef at Bianco's Catering Company in [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts]] for the ten years where she won numerous awards for her pastry at different events.\n\n== Model mismanagement ==\n\nDonahue hit the headlines for all the wrong reasons in 1995 when the head of Elite Model Management, John Casablancas, blamed her for recommending David Weil to her as an experienced money manager. Casablancas claimed that the recommendation from Donahue was so good that he never investigated Weil further, nor did he search into the background of his business partner, Peter Bucchieri. The two operated a firm, Star Capital, within Elite's offices and managed many of the model's financial portfolios. They were subsequently accused of mismanaging the funds. On September 21, 1997, Bucchieri, pleaded guilty to conspiring with Weil to sell fictitious Colorado real estate investments to the models. Bucchieri was sentenced to 33 months in prison.  It was subsequently discovered that they had transferred many of the model's funds to their own bank accounts and used it to pay personal bills and make purchases, including a new Porsche. Donahue accepted no blame for the incident and claims that she also lost a considerable amount of money to Bucchieri and Weil.<ref>Vegas Swindler gets 33 months, ''Rocky Mountain News'', 21 September 1997</ref><ref>Model Mismanagement, ''New York'' Magazine, Jul 17, 1995</ref><ref>Two Men Accused of Bilking Models, ''New York Times'', December 19, 1995</ref>\n\n== Acting ==\n* ''Exposed'', with Natashia Kinski, 1983<ref>{{IMDb title|0085513|Exposed}}</ref>\n* ''Portfolio'', with Kelly Emberg, Julie Wolfe and Paulina Porizkova, 1983<ref>{{IMDb title|0086130|Portfolio}}</ref>\n* ''[[The Self-Destruction of Gia]]'', with Francesco Scavullo, Diane von F\u00fcrstenberg, and Janice Dickinson, 2002\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nDonahue resides in her hometown of Lowell, Massachusetts, with her third husband, local businessman, Steven Joncas.
