Appearing in only 99 games the following season, Comorosky also saw his batting average dip to, down 70 points to .243. While he rebounded the next two season, he could not duplicate the success he had in 1930. After the 1933 season was over, the Pirates traded Comorosky to the [[Cincinnati Reds]] along with infielder [[Tony Piet]] in exchange for pitcher [[Red Lucas]] and outfielder [[Wally Roettger]]. Comorosky played for the Reds the next two seasons before drawing his release from the big league club at the conclusion of the 1935 season, ending his time in the major leagues.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/comorad01.shtml</ref> It was back to the minors and playing in cities like Toronto and Wilkes-Barre before retiring at the end of the 1938 season.

professional [[baseball]] player. He played in [[Major League Baseball]] as a [[right fielder]] from 1973 to 1991. A seven-time [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] player, Parker is notable for winning two National League batting titles and, for being named the 1978 National League [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]]. He was a member of two world championship winning teams with the Pittsburgh Pirates in {{wsy|1979}} and, with the Oakland Athletics in {{wsy|1989}}.\n\nParker was the first professional athlete to earn an average of $1 million per year, having signed a five-year, $5 million contract in January 1979. Parker's career achievements include 2,712 hits, 339 [[home run]]s, 1,493 runs batted in and a lifetime [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] of .290. Parker was also known as a solid defensive outfielder during the first half of his career, with a powerful arm, winning three consecutive [[Gold Glove]]s during his prime. From 1975 to 1979, he threw out 72 runners, including 26 in 1977.\n\n==Early life==\nParker grew up in Cincinnati near [[Crosley Field]], where he learned to play baseball on the stadium's parking lots. His father, Dick Parker, was a shipping clerk in a foundry.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19780201&id=NYMqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=e1oEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3299,109912 | title=The Pittsburgh Press - Google News Archive Search}}</ref> Dave Parker attended Courter Tech High School.

At some point, the family moved about four miles away to Arcadia. Leaping Mike went on to play baseball from 1914 to 1930. He played for the Pittsburgh Rebels, [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]], and the [[Boston Red Sox]]. He replaced [[Babe Ruth]] in left field after Babe Ruth was sold to the [[New York Yankees]], beginning what was referred to as \"the curse\" in [[Boston]].<ref name=\"The Indiana Gazette\"/>\n\nGlen Campbell, the first coal town in Indiana County, was founded in 1889. It was named for Cornelius Campbell, the first superintendent of the Glenwood Coal Company, the enterprise which initiated mining operations in the area. The town experienced immediate growth and soon a number of coal companies were operating in and around the community. In 1894, just five years after its inception, Glen Campbell was incorporated as a borough. The town quickly became the service, business, and shopping center for a number of smaller mining communities that sprang up in northern Indiana County.\n\nBy 1900 Glen Campbell was the third largest town in Indiana County. It also had the distinction of being the county's fastest-growing community. In fact, residents of the community felt it was plausible that the county seat would someday be moved to Glen Campbell.\n\nThe town was serviced by both the [[Pennsylvania Railroad|Pennsylvania]] and [[New York Central]] railroads. In addition to [[coal mining]], there were a number of lumber mills. In 1905 the Giant Electric Light, Heat, and Power Company opened operations in Glen Campbell.

He replaced [[Babe Ruth]] in left field after Babe Ruth was sold to the [[New York Yankees]], beginning what was referred to as \"the curse\" in [[Boston]].<ref name=\"The Indiana Gazette\"/>\n\nGlen Campbell, the first coal town in Indiana County, was founded in 1889. It was named for Cornelius Campbell, the first superintendent of the Glenwood Coal Company, the enterprise which initiated mining operations in the area. The town experienced immediate growth and soon a number of coal companies were operating in and around the community. In 1894, just five years after its inception, Glen Campbell was incorporated as a borough. The town quickly became the service, business, and shopping center for a number of smaller mining communities that sprang up in northern Indiana County.\n\nBy 1900 Glen Campbell was the third largest town in Indiana County. It also had the distinction of being the county's fastest-growing community. In fact, residents of the community felt it was plausible that the county seat would someday be moved to Glen Campbell.\n\nThe town was serviced by both the [[Pennsylvania Railroad|Pennsylvania]] and [[New York Central]] railroads. In addition to [[coal mining]], there were a number of lumber mills. In 1905 the Giant Electric Light, Heat, and Power Company opened operations in Glen Campbell. The company provided electricity to communities in northern Indiana and southern Clearfield counties.\n\nOther industries included a brickyard which was established on the Cush Creek, a stream that flows through the community, and a cooper's shop which manufactured barrels. Later a battery factory was opened. There also were plans for the construction of a foundry and a furniture factory.\n\nAt its height of prosperity, the town had approximately sixty businesses. There was an [[opera]] house and a [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]]. The community boasted its own school system, which included a high school. There were a number of dentists and doctors. One doctor even operated an infirmary for the miners.\n\nThe borough had its own bank, the First National Bank of Glen Campbell.

The factory came to be known as \u201cthe Glass House\u201d. Other industries soon followed. The area was originally laid out in a plot plan by the Glassport Land Co., a subsidiary of the United States Glass Co.\n\nGlassport was named after the Glassport Land Company.\n\nThe United States Glass Company was located near the Monongahela River on Seventh Street. The company specialized in \"pressed glass,\" tableware, and other glass products made from molds. \nUnfortunately, in 1963 the United States Glass Company was damaged by a tornado, and their 80-foot water tower collapsed through the building's roof. The furnaces shut down and the liquid glass cooled and hardened.

In 1902, it became a separate municipality, comprising 1.52 square miles.\n\nThe town was built around a mill called The United States Glass Co., built in 1894. The factory came to be known as \u201cthe Glass House\u201d. Other industries soon followed. The area was originally laid out in a plot plan by the Glassport Land Co., a subsidiary of the United States Glass Co.\n\nGlassport was named after the Glassport Land Company.\n\nThe United States Glass Company was located near the Monongahela River on Seventh Street. The company specialized in \"pressed glass,\" tableware, and other glass products made from molds. \nUnfortunately, in 1963 the United States Glass Company was damaged by a tornado, and their 80-foot water tower collapsed through the building's roof. The furnaces shut down and the liquid glass cooled and hardened. Afterwards there was left a 250-ton block of solid glass, making any plans to rebuild too costly.\n\nFormer pro football player [[George Hays (American football)]] was born in Glassport.\nJesse James of the Detroit Lions is from Glassport.

A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a four-year term of office. The Borough Council consists of six members elected to serve three-year terms on a staggered basis, with two seats coming up for election each year in a three-year cycle.<ref name=DataBook>''2012 New Jersey Legislative District Data Book'', [[Rutgers University]] [[Edward J.

{"title_page": "Roman assemblies", "text_new": "{{Roman government}}\nThe '''Roman Assemblies''' were institutions in [[ancient Rome]]. They functioned as the poopoopant54  of the Roman legislative branch, and thus (theoretically at least) passed all legislation. Since the assemblies operated on the basis of [[direct democracy]], ordinary citizens, and not elected representatives, would cast all ballots. The assemblies were subject to strong checks on their power by the executive branch and by the [[Roman Senate]]. Laws were passed (and magistrates elected) by [[Curia]] (in the [[Curiate Assembly]]), Tribes (in the [[Tribal Assembly]]), and [[Centuria|Centuries]] (in the [[Centuriate Assembly]]).\n\nWhen the city of Rome was founded (traditionally dated at 753 BC), a senate and an assembly, the [[Curiate Assembly]], were both created. The Curiate Assembly was the principal legislative assembly during the era of the [[Roman Kingdom]]. While its primary purpose was to elect new kings, it also possessed rudimentary legislative powers. Shortly after the founding of the [[Roman Republic]] (traditionally dated to 509 BC), the principal legislative authority shifted to two new assemblies, the Tribal Assembly (\"Citizen's Assembly\") and the Centuriate Assembly.  Eventually, most legislative powers were transferred to another assembly, the [[Plebeian Council]] (\"Assembly of the Commoners\"). Ultimately, it was the Plebeian Council that disrupted the balance between the senate, the legislative branch, and the executive branch{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. This led to the collapse of the republic, and the founding of the [[Roman Empire]] in 27 BC. Under the empire, the powers that had been held by the assemblies were transferred to the senate. While the assemblies eventually lost their last semblance of political power, citizens continued to gather into them for organizational purposes. Eventually, however, the assemblies were abandoned.\n\n==Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Kingdom==\n{{main|Constitution of the Roman Kingdom|Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Kingdom}}\nThe Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Kingdom were political institutions in the ancient [[Roman Kingdom]]. While one assembly, the [[Curiate Assembly]], had some legislative powers,<ref name=\"Abbott, 18\">Abbott, 18</ref> these powers involved nothing more than a right to symbolically ratify decrees issued by the [[Roman King]]. The functions of the other assembly, the [[Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Kingdom|Calate Assembly]], were purely [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious]hii]. During the years of the kingdom, the [[spqr|People of Rome]] were organized on the basis of units called [[Curia]].<ref name=\"Abbott, 18\"/> All of the People of Rome were divided amongst a total of thirty Curiae.<ref name=\"Abbott, 18\"/> These Curiae were the basic units of division in the two popular assemblies.<ref name=\"Byrd, 33\">Byrd, 33</ref> The members in each Curia would vote, and the majority in each Curia would determine how that Curia voted before the assembly. Thus, a majority of the Curiae (sixteen out of the thirty total Curiae) were needed during any vote before either the Curiate Assembly or the Calculate Assembly.They functioned as the roman legislative branch.   \n[[Image:Platner - Ancient Rome city growth.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Growth of the city region during the kingdom]]\n\nThe Curiate Assembly was a popular assembly during the period of the Roman Kingdom,<ref name=\"Abbott, 18\"/> and was organized on the basis of the thirty Curiae.<ref name=\"Abbott, 19\">Abbott, 19</ref> The king presided over the assembly, and submitted decrees to it for ratification.<ref name=\"Abbott, 19\"/> After a king died, the [[Interrex]] selected a candidate to replace the king.<ref name=\"Abbott, 14\">Abbott, 14</ref> After the nominee received the approval of the [[Senate of the Roman Kingdom|Roman Senate]], the Interrex held the formal election before the Curiate Assembly. After the Curiate Assembly elected the new king, and the senate ratified that election, the Interrex then presided over the assembly as it voted on the law which granted the king his legal powers (the ''[[lex curiata de imperio]]'').<ref name=\"Abbott, 14\"/> On the ''[[calends]]'' (the first day of the month), and the ''[[nones (calendar)|nones]]'' (around the fifth day of the month), this assembly met to hear announcements.<ref name=\"Abbott, 19\"/> Appeals heard by this assembly often had to deal with questions concerning Roman family law.<ref name=\"Abbott, 15\">Abbott, 15</ref> During two fixed days in the spring, the assembly was to always meet to witness wills and adoptions.<ref name=\"Abbott, 19\"/> The assembly also had jurisdiction over the admission of new families to a Curia, the transfer of families between two Curiae, and the transfer of individuals from [[plebeian]] (commoner) to [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] (aristocratic) status (or vice versa).<ref name=\"Abbott, 19\"/>\n\n==Legislative assemblies of the Roman Republic==\n{{main|Constitution of the Roman Republic|Legislative assemblies of the Roman Republic|Plebeian Council}}\nThe Legislative Assemblies of the Roman Republic were political institutions in the ancient [[Roman Republic]]. There were two types of Roman assembly. The first was the ''comitia'',<ref name=\"Lintott, 42\">Lintott, 42</ref> which was an assembly of Roman citizens.<ref name=\"Abbott, 251\">Abbott, 251</ref> Here, Roman citizens gathered to enact laws, elect magistrates, and try judicial cases. The second type of assembly was the council (''concilium''), which was an assembly of a specific group of citizens.<ref name=\"Abbott, 251\"/> For example, the \"[[Plebeian Council]]\" was an assembly where Plebeians gathered to elect Plebeian magistrates, pass laws that applied only to Plebeians, and try judicial cases concerning Plebeians.<ref name=\"Lintott, 43\">Lintott, 43</ref> A convention (''conventio''), in contrast, was an unofficial forum for communication, where citizens gathered to debate bills, campaign for office, and decide judicial cases.<ref name=\"Lintott, 42\"/> The voters first assembled into conventions to deliberate, and then they assembled into committees or councils to actually vote.<ref name=\"Taylor, 2\">Taylor, 2</ref> In addition to the curiae (familial groupings), Roman citizens were also organized into centuries (for military purposes) and tribes (for civil purposes). Each gathered into an assembly for legislative, electoral, and judicial purposes. The [[Centuriate Assembly]] was the assembly of the Centuries, while the [[Tribal Assembly]] was the assembly of the Tribes. Only a block of voters (Century, Tribe or Curia), and not the individual electors, cast the formal vote (one vote per block) before the assembly.<ref name=\"Taylor, 40\">Taylor, 40</ref> The majority of votes in any Century, Tribe, or Curia decided how that Century, Tribe, or Curia voted.\n\nThe Centuriate Assembly was divided into 193 (later 373) Centuries, with each Century belonging to one of three classes: the officer class, the infantry, and the unarmed adjuncts.<ref name=\"Taylor, 85\">Taylor, 85</ref><ref name=\"Cicero, 226\">Cicero, 226</ref> During a vote, the Centuries voted, one at a time, by order of seniority. The president of the Centuriate Assembly was usually a [[Roman Consul]] (the chief magistrate of the republic).<ref name=\"Polybius, 132\">Polybius, 132</ref> Only the Centuriate Assembly could elect Consuls, [[Praetors]] and [[Roman censor|Censors]], only it could [[Declaration of war|declare war]],<ref name=\"Abbott, 257\">Abbott, 257</ref> and only it could ratify the results of a census.<ref name=\"Taylor, 3, 4\">Taylor, 3, 4</ref> While it had the power to pass ordinary laws (''leges''), it rarely did so.\n[[Image:Gaius Gracchus Tribune of the People.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Gaius Gracchus]], tribune of the people, presiding over the Plebeian Council]]\n\nThe organization of the Tribal Assembly was much simpler than was that of the Centuriate Assembly, in contrast, since its organization was based on only thirty-five Tribes. The Tribes were not ethnic or kinship groups, but rather geographical divisions (similar to modern [[U.S. Congress|U.S. Congressional]] districts or Commonwealth Parliamentary constituencies).<ref name=\"Lintott, 51\">Lintott, 51</ref> The president of the Tribal Assembly was usually a Consul,<ref name=\"Polybius, 132\"/> and under his presidency, the assembly elected [[Quaestors]], [[aedile|Curule Aediles]], and [[tribune|Military Tribunes]].<ref name=\"Taylor, 7\">Taylor, 7</ref> While it had the power to pass ordinary laws (''leges''), it rarely did so. The assembly known as the [[Plebeian Council]] was identical to the Tribal Assembly with one key exception: only [[plebeian]]s (the commoners) had the power to vote before it. Members of the aristocratic [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] class were excluded from this assembly. In contrast, both classes were entitled to a vote in the Tribal Assembly. Under the presidency of a [[tribune|Plebeian Tribune]] (the chief representative of the people), the Plebeian Council elected Plebeian Tribunes and [[aedile|Plebeian Aediles]] (the Plebeian Tribune's assistant), enacted laws called [[plebiscite]]s, and presided over judicial cases involving Plebeians. Originally, laws passed by the Plebeian Council only applied to Plebeians.<ref name=\"Byrd, 31\">Byrd, 31</ref> However, by 287 BC, laws passed by the Plebeian Council had acquired the full force of law, and from that point on, most legislation came from the council.\n\n==Legislative assemblies of the Roman Empire==\n{{see also|Constitution of the Roman Empire|Legislative assemblies of the Roman Empire}}\n\nThe legislative assemblies of the Roman Empire were political institutions in the ancient [[Roman Empire]]. During the reign of the second [[Roman Emperor]], [[Tiberius]], the powers that had been held by the Roman assemblies were transferred to the [[Roman senate|senate]]. The neutering of the assemblies had become inevitable for reasons beyond the fact that they were composed of the rabble of Rome. The electors were, in general, ignorant as to the merits of the important questions that were laid before them,<ref name=\"Abbott, 278\">Abbott, 278</ref> and often willing to sell their votes to the highest bidder. After the founding of the [[Roman Empire]], the People of Rome continued to organize by Centuries and by Tribes, but by this point, these divisions had lost most of their relevance.<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\">Abbott, 397</ref>\n\nWhile the machinery of the [[Centuriate Assembly]] continued to exist well into the life of the empire,<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/> the assembly lost all of its practical relevance. Under the empire, all gatherings of the Centuriate Assembly were in the form of an unsorted convention. Legislation was never submitted to the imperial Centuriate Assembly, and the one major legislative power that this assembly had held under the republic, the right to declare war, was now held exclusively by the emperor.<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/> All judicial powers that had been held by the republican Centuriate Assembly were transferred to independent jury courts, and under the emperor [[Tiberius]], all of its former electoral powers were transferred to the senate.<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/> After it had lost all of these powers, it had no remaining authority. Its only remaining function was, after the senate had 'elected' the magistrates, to hear the ''renuntiatio'',<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/> The ''renuntiatio'' had no legal purpose, but instead was a ceremony in which the results of the election were read to the electors. This allowed the emperor to claim that the magistrates had been \"elected\" by a sovereign people.\n\nAfter the founding of the empire, the tribal divisions of citizens and freedmen continued, but the only political purpose of the tribal divisions was such that they better enabled the senate to maintain a list of citizens.<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/> Tribal divisions also simplified the process by which grain was distributed.<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/> Eventually, most ''freedmen'' belonged to one of the four urban Tribes, while most ''freemen'' belonged to one of the thirty-one rural Tribes.<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/> Under the emperor Tiberius, the electoral powers of the [[Tribal Assembly]] were transferred to the senate. Each year, after the senate had elected the annual magistrates, the Tribal Assembly also heard the ''renuntiatio''.<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/> Any legislation that the emperor submitted to the assemblies for ratification were submitted to the Tribal Assembly.<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/> The assembly ratified imperial decrees, starting with the emperor [[Augustus]], and continuing until the emperor [[Domitian]]. The ratification of legislation by the assembly, however, had no legal importance as the emperor could make any decree into law, even without the acquiescence of the assemblies. Thus, under the empire, the chief executive again became the chief lawgiver, which was a power he had not held since the days of the early republic.<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/> The [[Plebeian Council]] also survived the fall of the republic,<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/> and it also lost its legislative, judicial and electoral powers to the senate. By virtue of his [[tribune|tribunician powers]], the emperor had absolute control over the council.<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{columns\n|col1 =\n* [[Roman Kingdom]]\n* [[Roman Republic]]\n* [[Roman Empire]]\n* [[Roman Law]]\n* [[Plebeian Council]]\n* [[Centuria]]\n|col2 =\n* [[Curia]]\n* [[Roman consul]]\n* [[Praetor]]\n* [[Roman censor]]\n* [[Quaestor]]\n* [[Aedile]]\n|col3 =\n* [[Roman Dictator]]\n* [[Master of the Horse]]\n* [[Roman Senate]]\n* [[Cursus honorum]]\n* [[Byzantine Senate]]\n* [[Pontifex Maximus]]\n|col4 =\n* [[Princeps senatus]]\n* [[Interrex]]\n* [[Promagistrate]]\n* [[Acta Senatus]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\n* Abbott, Frank Frost (1901).

This allowed the emperor to claim that the magistrates had been \"elected\" by a sovereign people.\n\nAfter the founding of the empire, the tribal divisions of citizens and freedmen continued, but the only political purpose of the tribal divisions was such that they better enabled the senate to maintain a list of citizens.<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/> Tribal divisions also simplified the process by which grain was distributed.<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/> Eventually, most ''freedmen'' belonged to one of the four urban Tribes, while most ''freemen'' belonged to one of the thirty-one rural Tribes.<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/> Under the emperor Tiberius, the electoral powers of the [[Tribal Assembly]] were transferred to the senate. Each year, after the senate had elected the annual magistrates, the Tribal Assembly also heard the ''renuntiatio''.<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/> Any legislation that the emperor submitted to the assemblies for ratification were submitted to the Tribal Assembly.<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/> The assembly ratified imperial decrees, starting with the emperor [[Augustus]], and continuing until the emperor [[Domitian]]. The ratification of legislation by the assembly, however, had no legal importance as the emperor could make any decree into law, even without the acquiescence of the assemblies. Thus, under the empire, the chief executive again became the chief lawgiver, which was a power he had not held since the days of the early republic.<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/> The [[Plebeian Council]] also survived the fall of the republic,<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/> and it also lost its legislative, judicial and electoral powers to the senate. By virtue of his [[tribune|tribunician powers]], the emperor had absolute control over the council.<ref name=\"Abbott, 397\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{columns\n|col1 =\n* [[Roman Kingdom]]\n* [[Roman Republic]]\n* [[Roman Empire]]\n* [[Roman Law]]\n* [[Plebeian Council]]\n* [[Centuria]]\n|col2 =\n* [[Curia]]\n* [[Roman consul]]\n* [[Praetor]]\n* [[Roman censor]]\n* [[Quaestor]]\n* [[Aedile]]\n|col3 =\n* [[Roman Dictator]]\n* [[Master of the Horse]]\n* [[Roman Senate]]\n* [[Cursus honorum]]\n* [[Byzantine Senate]]\n* [[Pontifex Maximus]]\n|col4 =\n* [[Princeps senatus]]\n* [[Interrex]]\n* [[Promagistrate]]\n* [[Acta Senatus]]\n}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n\n* Abbott, Frank Frost (1901).
