Severe winters restrict the northern limits of their range while favorable weather conditions lead to a northward extension of their breeding range. Their preferred habitat is in dense cover in forest, farm edges and suburban areas. This wren is the [[List of U.S. state birds|state bird]] of [[South Carolina]].\n\nThere are seven recognized subspecies across the range of these wrens and they differ slightly in song and appearance. The birds are generally inconspicuous, avoiding the open for extended periods of time. When out in the open, they investigate their surroundings and are rarely stationary. After finding a mate, pairs maintain a [[territory (animal)|territory]] and stay together for several years. Both sexes give out alarm calls, but only males sing to advertise territory. Carolina wrens raise multiple broods during the summer breeding season, but can fall victim to [[brood parasitism]] by [[brown-headed cowbird]]s, among other species. Some populations have been affected by mercury contamination.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe Carolina wren was first described under the name of ''Sylvia ludoviciana'' by [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]] in 1790.<ref name=\"Brewer15\"/>{{#tag:ref|Johann Friedrich Gmelin wrongly associated the Carolina wren with the European wrens under the name ''Motacilla troglodytes'' (originally coined by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in [[Systema Naturae]])<ref>{{cite book|last=Linnaeus|first=C.|authorlink=Carl Linnaeus|title=Systema Naturae per Regna Tria Naturae, Secundum Classes, Ordines, Genera, Species, cum Characteribus, Differentiis, Synonymis, Locis.

The secondary coverts are rich brown with a darker brown barring on both webs; the bars on the primaries are on the outerwebs only, but darker and more noticeable. The [[flight feathers|rectrices]] are brown with 18 to 20 bars that span across the tail. The white [[supercilium|supercilious streak]] borders thinly with a black above and below, and extends above and beyond its shoulders. The ear coverts are speckled gray and grayish-black. Its chin and throat are grey that becomes buff on its chest, flank and belly, though the latter two are of a warmer color. The underwing coverts sport a grayish buff color.

The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use. Age and life experience are not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle. Due to the large size of male wrens and the male's vigor in defending its territory, intrasexual selection was given as a possible explanation for the sexual dimorphism.<ref name=\"Haggerty\"/>\n\n===Territorial and predator defense===\nBoth sexes are involved in defending the territory. One aspect of territorial defense involves identifying the proximity of the threat based on the loudness of bird song as well as the level of degradation of the calls. In experiments involving playback, the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs, as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions, and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories, such as songs under foliage.<ref name=\"Naguib95\">{{cite journal|author=Naguib, Marc|year=1995|title=Ranging by Song in Carolina Wrens (''Thryothorus ludovicianus''): Effects of Environmental Acoustics and Strength of Song Degradation|journal=Behaviour|volume=133|issue=7|pages=541\u2013559|url=http://www.unc.edu/home/rhwiley/pdfs/EnvironAcousticsCW.pdf|doi=10.1163/156853996x00206}}</ref> Song degradation can also be used to determine the proximity of potential intruders.

Males alone produce the ''cheer'' call, which can sound indistinct. In southern regions of their range, the sound males use in alarm disputes is a ringing ''pink'' or ''p'dink'' sound. Females are the only ones that can perform the paired ''dit-dit'' or chatter sounds. The former can be used in territorial disputes with predators, and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males ''cheer'' chant. The chatter is used exclusively with territorial encounters with male song, and the song can either follow or overlap her mate's song.<ref name=\"Nealen00\"/><ref name=\"Elliott\">{{cite book|last=Elliott|first=Lang|title=Know Your Bird Sounds: Songs and calls of yard, garden, and city birds|publisher=Stackpole Books|year=2004|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChyiBZr6GU8C&pg=PA28|isbn=978-0811729635}}</ref>\n\n===Feeding===\nCarolina wrens spend the majority of their time on or near the ground searching for food, or in tangles of vegetation and vines.

Severe winters restrict the northern limits of their range while favorable weather conditions lead to a northward extension of their breeding range. Their preferred habitat is in dense cover in forests, farm edges and suburban areas. This wren is the [[List of U.S. state birds|state bird]] of [[South Carolina]].\n\nThere are seven recognized subspecies across the range of these wrens and they differ slightly in song and appearance. The birds are generally inconspicuous, avoiding the open for extended periods of time. When out in the open, they investigate their surroundings and are rarely stationary. After finding a mate, pairs maintain a [[territory (animal)|territory]] and stay together for several years. Both sexes give out alarm calls, but only males sing to advertise territory. Carolina wrens raise multiple broods during the summer breeding season, but can fall victim to [[brood parasitism]] by [[brown-headed cowbird]]s, among other species. Some populations have been affected by mercury contamination.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe Carolina wren was first described under the name of ''Sylvia ludoviciana'' by [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]] in 1790.<ref name=\"Brewer15\"/>{{#tag:ref|Johann Friedrich Gmelin wrongly associated the Carolina wren with the European wrens under the name ''Motacilla troglodytes'' (originally coined by [[Carl Linnaeus]] in [[Systema Naturae]])<ref>{{cite book|last=Linnaeus|first=C.|authorlink=Carl Linnaeus|title=Systema Naturae per Regna Tria Naturae, Secundum Classes, Ordines, Genera, Species, cum Characteribus, Differentiis, Synonymis, Locis.

For ''T. l. ludovicianus'', the [[crown (anatomy)|crown]] is rich brown that appears more chestnut-colored on its [[rump (animal)|rump]] and uppertail-coverts. Shoulders and greater [[covert feathers|coverts]] are a rich brown, with a series of small white dots on the lesser primary coverts. The secondary coverts are rich brown with a darker brown barring on both webs; the bars on the primaries are on the outerwebs only, but darker and more noticeable. The [[flight feathers|rectrices]] are brown with 18 to 20 bars that span across the tail. The white [[supercilium|supercilious streak]] borders thinly with a black above and below, and extends above and beyond its shoulders. The ear coverts are speckled gray and grayish-black. Its chin and throat are grey that becomes buff on its chest, flank and belly, though the latter two are of a warmer color. The underwing coverts sport a grayish buff color. Its [[iris (anatomy)|iris]] is reddish-brown, the [[upper mandible]] is lemon-colored and paler at the base and [[lower mandible]]. The legs are flesh-colored.<ref name=\"Brewer15\"/>\n\nAs for the other subspecies in contrast to ''T. l. ludovicianus'', ''T. l. berlandieri'' is of a slightly smaller build, but possesses a larger bill, the upperparts are duller brown with deeper colored underparts, ''T. l. lomitensis'' is of a duller color (than either ''ludovicianus'' or ''berlandieri'') with its underparts either pale or almost white, ''T. l. miamensis'' contains darker rusty chestnut upperparts and deeper colored below. ''T. l. burleighi'' is duller and sootier with less distinct tail markings, ''T. l. mesophilus'' has paler underparts and a whiter supercilium, and ''T. l. tropicalis'' is darker than all races, and contains heavier bars than ''T. l. berlandieri''.<ref name=\"Brewer15\"/>\n\n===Plumage===\nThe juvenile ''T.l. ludovicianus'' is similar in appearance, but the plumage is generally paler with a softer texture with buff-tipped wing coverts, a superciliary streak is less white, a fluffy vent and crissum (the undertail [[Covert feather|coverts]] surrounding the [[cloaca]]) without bars.<ref name=\"Brewer15\"/><ref name=\"Bent\"/> In August and September, the partial plumage molt for the post-juvenile wrens is darker in color and affects the contour plumage, wing coverts, tail and develops a whiter superciliary stripe.

The courting and antagonistic encounters that involve the tail fanning and wing drooping was suggested to be a possible signaling use. Age and life experience are not thought of as significant for potential mates due to their relatively short lifespan and sedentary lifestyle. Due to the large size of male wrens and the male's vigor in defending its territory, intrasexual selection was given as a possible explanation for the sexual dimorphism.<ref name=\"Haggerty\"/>\n\n===Territorial and predator defense===\nBoth sexes are involved in defending the territory. One aspect of territorial defense involves identifying the proximity of the threat based on the loudness of bird song as well as the level of degradation of the calls. In experiments involving playback, the wrens are capable of discriminating between degraded and undegraded songs, as well as degraded songs in the same acoustic conditions, and can detect changes of acoustic properties within their territories, such as songs under foliage.<ref name=\"Naguib95\">{{cite journal|author=Naguib, Marc|year=1995|title=Ranging by Song in Carolina Wrens (''Thryothorus ludovicianus''): Effects of Environmental Acoustics and Strength of Song Degradation|journal=Behaviour|volume=133|issue=7|pages=541\u2013559|url=http://www.unc.edu/home/rhwiley/pdfs/EnvironAcousticsCW.pdf|doi=10.1163/156853996x00206}}</ref> Song degradation can also be used to determine the proximity of potential intruders.

Males alone produce the ''cheer'' call, which can sound indistinct. In southern regions of their range, the sound males use in alarm disputes is a ringing ''pink'' or ''p'dink'' sound. Females are the only ones that can perform the paired ''dit-dit'' or chatter sounds. The former can be used in territorial disputes with predators, and with at least northern populations the songs are used in alternation with the males ''cheer'' chant. The chatter is used exclusively with territorial encounters with male song, and the song can either follow or overlap her mate's song.<ref name=\"Nealen00\"/><ref name=\"Elliott\">{{cite book|last=Elliott|first=Lang|title=Know Your Bird Sounds: Songs and calls of yard, garden, and city birds|publisher=Stackpole Books|year=2004|page=29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ChyiBZr6GU8C&pg=PA28|isbn=978-0811729635}}</ref>\n\n===Feeding===\nCarolina wrens spend the majority of their time on or near the ground searching for food, or in tangles of vegetation and vines.

Andre Norton. New York: Chelsea House, 2010, p. 16.</ref>  Her parents were Adalbert Freely Norton, who owned a rug company, and Bertha Stemm Norton. Alice began writing at Collinwood High School in Cleveland, under the tutelage of Sylvia Cochrane. She was the editor of a literary page in the school's paper,''The Collinwood Spotlight'', for which she wrote short stories. During this time, she wrote her first book, ''Ralestone Luck'', which was eventually published as her second novel in 1938.\n\nAfter graduating from high school in 1930, Norton planned to become a teacher, and began studying at Flora Stone Mather College of [[Case Western Reserve University|Western Reserve University]]. However, in 1932 she had to leave because of the Depression, and began working for the [[Cleveland Public Library|Cleveland Library System]],<ref name=\"Mclellan\" /> where she remained for 18 years, latterly in the children's section of the Nottingham Branch Library in Cleveland. In 1934, she legally changed her name to Andre Alice Norton, a pen name she had adopted for her first book, published later that year, to increase her marketability, since boys were the main audience for fantasy.<ref name=\"Mclellan\" />\n\nDuring 1940\u20131941, she worked as a special librarian in the cataloging department of the [[Library of Congress]].<ref>Bankston, John.

However, for this legislative failure it has been known to posterity as the '''Addled Parliament'''.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604\u20131610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. The spreading of this rumour, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been generally attributed to the scheming of the [[crypto-Catholic]] [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though this allegation has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. [[House of Commons of England|The Commons]] were pitted against [[House of Lords of England|the Lords]], culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 [[MP (UK)|MP]]s sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James devised new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. [[Historiographically]], historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20131625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]];{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} as his slogan went: \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the Blessed Parliament, was called in 1604; it took seven years, with proceeding through five sessions, before James dissolved it,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, in hopes of assuaging outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, proposals for unification faced such criticism from MPs that the idea was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the [[Gunpowder Plot]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3-year delay between sessions due to [[Bubonic plague|plague]], the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|The feudal duty of impositions were an invaluable source of extra-parliamentary income for James, bringing the Crown \u00a370,000 a year. This sum would only increase with the growth of trade in England;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} by the 1630s, they brought the king \u00a3218,000 a year.{{sfn|Russell|1990|p=39}}}} Parliament did give the king an immediate subsidy, but the proposed \u00a3600,000 was reduced to a mere \u00a3100,000. By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source. Parliament was outraged, and the Contract was abandoned three days later. Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hopes of securing any more financial support from Parliament, James grew impatient. On 31 December 1610, James publicly proclaimed the dissolution of the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} James's first parliament had ended on a bitter note; \"your greatest error\", he chastised Salisbury, \"hath been that ye ever expected to draw honey out of gall.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=80}}\n\nAfter this, James was not keen to call another Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} However, without Parliament to raise taxes, the treasury was forced to find new ways to raise money.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In 1611, the City of London loaned the Crown \u00a3100,000; \u00a360,000 was extracted from [[Louis XIII of France|the King of France]] over debts accumulated in the reign of [[Henry IV of France|Henry IV]]; [[Honour#Awards|honours]] were sold to wealthy gentlemen, raising \u00a390,000; a forced loan was levied on nearly 10,000 people.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|pp=148\u2013149}} Yet, after the death of Treasurer Salisbury in 1612, England's finances still remained destitute, with a debt of \u00a3500,000 and annual [[Deficit spending|deficit]] of \u00a3160,000.{{sfn|Dietz|1964|p=149}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=10}} However, James's principal fiscal expedient was to be the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales|Henry, Prince of Wales]], for which he expected a sizeable [[dowry]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} not to mention a foreign ally.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=84}} James went into talks with several Catholic countries but, in late 1612, aged 18, Henry contracted [[typhoid]] and abruptly died;{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=85}} [[Charles I of England|Prince Charles]], newly heir-apparent at age 12, took his place in the negotiations. Negotiations were going most promisingly in France, where a marriage of Prince Charles to the 6-year-old Princess [[Christine of France]] promised a healthy sum of \u00a3240,000, almost halving James's debt.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} However, by early 1614, France's internal religious strife had intensified to such a point that civil war seemed imminent, so negotiations stalled on the French side; James grew impatient.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James's financial insecurity had only worsened in this time, the debt now at \u00a3680,000 and the deficit, \u00a3200,000.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=7}} [[Conspicuous consumption]] had raised yearly expenditure to an unsustainable \u00a3522,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|pp=98\u201399}} A group of advisors, led by the [[Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk|Earls of Suffolk]] and [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|Pembroke]], encouraged the king to call a Parliament to raise funds, convincing James \"that\"\u2014as he later put it\u2014\"my subjects did not hate me, which I know I had not deserved.\"{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Northampton stringently opposed this summoning,{{sfn|Cramsie|2002|p=135}} but, in 1614, James reluctantly summoned another parliament. [[Writs of election]] were issued on 19 February that year.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n==Parliament==\n\n===Preparations===\n[[File:Randolph Crewe by Peter Lely.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ranulph Crewe]], [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker]] for the Addled Parliament. Crewe was a surprising choice for Speaker, a last minute pick with little previous experience.]]\n\nThe Privy Council as a whole was not optimistic about the upcoming parliament. Two of the king's closest advisors were unavailable, the Earls of Salisbury was dead and Northampton was ill.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} Even Suffolk and Pembroke were clueless of any way to prevent Parliament from bringing up thorny issues such as impositions again.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} However, two Councillors were to provide advice to the king over his new parliament, which would prove significant.{{sfn|Stewart|2011|p=251}} [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] [[Sir Francis Bacon]], who had been among the most vocal in favour of calling Parliament, blamed Salisbury entirely for the failure of the previous Parliament, privately holding the treasurer had undermine his early career. He asserted that Salisbury's deal-making had been the king's downfall, and that the king should approach Parliament as a king, rather than a merchant, and request subsidies on the basis of the Commons' good will.{{sfn|Willson|1967|pp=344\u2013345}}{{sfn|Stewart|2011|pp=251\u2013252}} Bacon added to this that the king should employ patronage to win over the men of Parliament to his side.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=489}} [[Sir Henry Neville (died 1615)|Sir Henry Neville]] offered advice to the king on how to warm relations with Parliament, which he accepted amiably.{{sfn|Thrush|2010c}} But Neville's more portentous offer was that of an \"undertaking\", whereby Neville and a group of \"patriots\" would arrange to manage the Parliament in James's favour, in return for the office of Secretary of State.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} James rejected the undertaking derisively, and no such conspiracy was ever arranged,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}} but rumours of its actual occurrence spread quickly in the lead up to Parliament.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}}\n\nMPs later accused James of trying to [[wikt:pack#Verb|pack]] the Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=52}} Indeed, Bacon had plainly advised the king on the \"placing of persons well-affected and discreet\" in Parliament,{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=481}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=221\u2013222}} and James had unapologetically packed the Irish Parliament the previous year.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93}}{{efn|James attempted to pack the Irish Parliament of 1613 with Protestants by adding a 84 new seats to the former 148 that election: 38 represented tiny or as-yet nonexistent settlements in the Protestant [[Ulster plantation]]. The election came out with a Protestant majority of 32. James insisted he was within his royal right in doing this and mocked the Parliament's anger at this.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=93, 148}}}} An atypically large number of Crown officials found themselves in this Parliament;{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} four Privy Councillors had seats in the Commons, alongside plenty of Crown lawyers.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|pp=222\u2013223}} Though there is no evidence that the Crown sought to pack Parliament with easily controlled and pacified MPs, James certainly promoted the election of those sympathetic to the Crown's ambitions.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=53}} The [[Privy Council]], in actuality, seemed more apathetic with regards to appointing useful Parliamentary officials. Few of the expected preparations were made.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}} After some Byzantine wrangling in which another better-qualified candidate was dropped, [[Ranulph Crewe]], judge and MP for the [[rotten borough|government-controlled borough]] of [[Saltash (UK Parliament constituency)|Saltash]], was chosen at the last minute to be the [[Speaker of the House of Commons (United Kingdom)|Speaker of the House of Commons]].{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=41\u201342}} This was a surprising choice: Crewe's previous experience in Parliament was limited to a short stint as an MP in [[9th Parliament of Queen Elizabeth I|1597\u201398]] and an appearance on two minor legal counsels; his legal career was no more impressive.{{sfn|Hunneyball|2010}} Crewe's inexperience at dealing with rowdy MPs was no doubt among the factors that allowed Parliament to descend into disorder, as it rapidly did.{{sfn|Smith|1973|p=169}} James's most senior representative in the House of Commons, [[Ralph Winwood]], [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]], was announced similarly late. Though a spirited official and zealous Puritan, Winwood had no parliamentary experience at all and was a terse, unlikable figure.{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=92}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=345}} The new House of Commons as a whole was not especially inexperienced,{{efn|61% (281 out of 464) of the members had never sat in Parliament before, a little above the Elizabethan average of 50%, but perfectly reasonable given the decade interval between elections.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}}} but it was the inexperience of his most important officials and advisors that was to damage the king.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=55}}\n\n===Opening and conspiracy===\n[[File:Henry Neville 1599.jpg|right|thumb|The first six weeks of Parliament were marked by the suspicion of an \"undertaking\", headed by Sir [[Henry Neville (died 1615)|Henry Neville]].]]\nParliament opened on 5 April 1614.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} James opened the Parliament with the wish that it would come to be known as the \"Parliament of Love\", and that king and Parliament would go on in harmony and understanding.{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} His opening speech was divided into three sections: the first ({{lang|la|bona animi}}), decrying the growth of Catholicism and imploring the harsher enforcement of existing laws;{{efn|According to Thomas L. Moir, this aspect of James's speech \"displayed one of those flashes of visions which occasionally revealed his intellectual capacity.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}} Rather than demand the institution of new anti-Catholic legislature, James contended that persecution only aided the Catholic cause, and that, as Protestantism was correct, it could reject Catholicism for its own fallacies. Such an ostensibly tolerant doctrine was a novelty in James's time.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=81}}}} the second ({{lang|la|bona corporis}}), assuring parliament of the security of the [[Stuart dynasty]]; and the third ({{lang|la|bona fortunae}}), stating his financial necessity, and his aim not to bargain with Parliament any longer, but ask of their good will.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=226}}{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=80\u201382}} All but the religious aspect of this speech bore the unmistakable stamp of Bacon's influence.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=82}} Notably missing from the speech was any promise of compromise or reformation from the king.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=346}} In the same speech, he stringently denied any sanction of Neville's undertaking,{{sfn|Mondi|2007|p=153}} but speculation on the conspiracy was already widespread.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Neville's plan had, by now, been twisted into a far-reaching conspiracy of the king's court.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=346}} English diplomat Sir [[Thomas Roe]] was the first to allege that the rumours were promulgated by the Earl of Northampton's crypto-Catholic faction, who wanted the king to instead look for funds in a [[marital alliance]] with the Catholic Spain, thus favouring parliament's failure.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=491}} The idea that Northampton masterminded many of the factors in the failure of this Parliament has been accepted by most later historians,{{sfn|Peck|1981|loc=p. 533: \"Northampton was accused by some contemporaries and most later historians of engineering the abrupt dissolution of the Addled Parliament in 1614\"}} but has met with the notable rejection of Northampton's biographer, [[Linda Levy Peck]].{{sfn|Peck|1981|loc=p. 535: \"Secondly, the one thing that every schoolboy knows about Northampton - that he destroyed the Addled Parliament of 1614 - might be questioned\"}}\n\nSuspicions only compounded as Parliament proceeded, with the revelation that the king had corresponded with influential subjects in the hopes of securing the election of the sympathetic.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=346}} The House of Commons was divided between those who accepted the conspiracy and those who rejected it.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Commons thus immediately set about investigating the preceding elections for signs of misconduct.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} Though little more was established, it was found that [[Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster]], Sir [[Thomas Parry (ambassador)|Thomas Parry]] had swayed the election in [[Stockbridge (UK Parliament constituency)|Stockbridge]]. For a brief period, this investigation dominated the Commons: Parry was suspended from the House and, passingly, from his Chancellorship. For many in parliament, this seemed evidence enough that the king's officials had attempted to pack Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}}{{sfn|Seddon|2008}} Simultaneously, a [[Parliamentary committees of the United Kingdom|committee]] to inquire into the alleged undertaking was launched, though this proved less fruitful. The committee's chairman returned on 2 May; he spoke confusingly, but concluded against the existence of any undertaking. However, Parliamentary provocateur [[John Hoskins (poet)|John Hoskins]] demanded further investigation, which the House accepted.{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} On 14 May, the inquiry ended; after six weeks of Parliament, rumours of an undertaking had conclusively been dismissed.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Duncan|Roberts|1978|p=492}} However, by the end, resentment against the undertakers had evaporated. Neville was never suspended for his part, but rather met with commendation of Parliament after some time, seeing him as helping the king to remedy their grievances. The packers, on the other hand, never gained the sympathy of Parliament, with their efforts invariably seen as attempts to undermine the Parliamentary process.{{sfn|Roberts|1985|p=29}}\n\n===Controversy over impositions===\n{{quotebox\n|text=My Lords, I think it a dangerous thing for us to confer with them about the point of impositions.

After five days of debate, the Lords returned with their formal refusal of such a conference, meeting with the astonishment of many.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} The Lords had voted 39 to 30 against it, carried by the near unanimity of the Bishops against this conference.{{efn|Out of the 17 [[prelates]] who voted, all but one opposed the conference, namely the old-fashioned [[Archbishop of York]], [[Tobias Matthew]].{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}}}}{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=227}} [[Lord Spiritual]] [[Richard Neile]], who was one of the most vocal opponents of the conference,{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=116\u2013117}} added insult to injury with a sharp speech condemning the petitioners.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=347}} The remarks made in this speech, known as the \"{{lang|la|Noli me tangere}} speech\", have been described by one historian as \"the most dangerous words used in the reign [of James I] by any politician.\"{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=228}} The Commons refused to conduct any more business until Neile had been punished for this affront.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} Though the Commons received a tearful apology and retraction from the Bishop on 30 May, they were unsatisfied, and doubled down on their demands of disciplinary action.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=130\u2013131}} By the end of May, as Moir put it, \"the temper of the Commons had reached a fever pitch\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=132}} and leadership had broken down in this intractable atmosphere.{{sfn|Moir|1958|pp=132\u2013133}} No punishment for Neile, however, ever materialised, and the king was growing impatient with Parliament.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\n===James grows impatient===\n[[File:Henry Howard Earl of Northampton circle of Gheeraerts.JPG|right|thumb|[[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton]]'s wishes were finally fulfilled on his deathbed, as James dissolved Parliament and looked for Spanish support.]]\n\nParliament was adjourned on 1 June for [[Ascension Day]], reconvening again on 3 June.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} When the Commons met on this day, they received an ultimatum from the king: unless Parliament agreed to grant him a financial supply soon, he would dissolve Parliament on 9 June.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=136}} James expected this to shock the Commons into pursuing his aims, but instead it only entrenched the opposition further into its obstinacy. Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was still deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially its Scottish members, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Possibly encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]]. Gardiner alleges he was not the most historically learned member, and likely misunderstood the insinuation of the reference. Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}} Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament. Shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support. James dissolved Parliament on 7 June 1614. Northampton's goals were finally fulfilled, seeing the end of the Addled Parliament little more than a week before he died.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} The Parliament had elapsed without any bill being passed with [[royal assent]], and thus was not constitutionally a Parliament.

Lasting only two months and two days, it saw no bills pass and was not even regarded as a Parliament by its contemporaries. However, for this legislative failure it has been known to posterity as the '''Addled Parliament'''.\n\nJames had struggled with debt ever since he came to the English throne. The failure of the [[Blessed Parliament]] of 1604\u20131610 to, in its six-year sitting, rescue the king from his mounting debt or allow James to unite his two kingdoms, had left him bitter with the body. The four-year hiatus between Parliaments saw the royal debt and deficit grow further, despite the best efforts of [[Lord High Treasurer|Treasurer]] [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]]. The failure of the last and most lucrative financial expedient of this period, a foreign [[dowry]] from the marriage of his [[heir-apparent]], finally convinced James to recall Parliament in early 1614.\n\nThe Parliament got off to a bad start, with poor choices made for the king's representatives in Parliament. Rumours of conspiracy to manage (the \"undertaking\") or pack the Parliament for the king, though not based in fact, spread quickly. The spreading of this rumour, and the ultimate failure of Parliament, has been generally attributed to the scheming of the [[crypto-Catholic]] [[Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton|Earl of Northampton]], though this allegation has met with some recent skepticism. Parliament opened on 5 April and, despite the king's wishes it would be a \"Parliament of Love\", flung itself immediately into the controversy over the conspiracies, splitting parliament and leading to the exclusion of one alleged packer. However, by late April, Parliament had moved on to a familiar controversy, that of [[impositions]]. [[House of Commons of England|The Commons]] were pitted against [[House of Lords of England|the Lords]], culminating in a controversy over an unrestrained speech by one prelate.\n\nJames grew impatient with the Parliamentary proceedings. He issued an ultimatum to Parliament, but they treated it irreverently. Insult was added to injury by belligerent, and supposedly threatening, attacks on him from the Commons. On the advice of Northampton, James dissolved Parliament on 7 June, and had 4 [[MP (UK)|MP]]s sent to the [[Tower of London]]. James devised new financial expedients to settle his still-growing debt, to little success. [[Historiographically]], historians are divided between the [[Whig history|Whiggish]] view of the Parliament as anticipating the constitutional disputes of future Parliaments, and the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] view of it as a conflict primarily concerned with James's finances.\n\n==Background==\n{{main|James VI and I|Blessed Parliament}}\n[[File:King James I of England and VI of Scotland in Parliament by Renold or Reginold Elstrack (Elstracke).jpg|left|thumb|King James I at the [[Blessed Parliament]] on 5 November 1605.]]\nJames VI and I (1566\u20131625) ascended to the [[List of Scottish monarchs|Scottish throne]] on 24 July 1567, and subsequently to the [[List of English monarchs|English and Irish throne]] on 24 March 1603, becoming [[Union of the Crowns|the first king of to reign over both kingdoms]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} James inherited, with the latter throne, a national debt to the amount of \u00a3300,000, a sum that only increased during his reign. By 1608, it stood at \u00a31 million. During his predecessor [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]'s reign, the inward revenue of the crown had steadily fallen; taxes from customs and land were consistently undervalued and the parliamentary subsidies steadily shrank.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It did not help that James reigned as \"one of the most extravagant kings\" in English history.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} In peace, Elizabeth's yearly expenditure never rose above \u00a3300,000; almost immediately after James took the throne, it was at \u00a3400,000.{{sfn|Russell|1973|p=98}} James had instituted various extra-parliamentary plans to recuperate this lost income, but these drew controversy from Parliament, and James still wanted for money.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} Moreover, James was keen to not be \"a husband to two wives\" as king, and to unite his crowns as one kingdom of [[Great Britain]];{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} as his slogan went: \"one king, one people, and one law\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}{{efn|In James's original Latinism: \"{{lang|la|Unus Rex}} [...] {{lang|la|Unus Grex}} and {{lang|la|Una Lex}}\".{{sfn|Croft|2003|p=59}}}} The first parliament of his reign, also known as the Blessed Parliament, was called in 1604; it took seven years, with proceeding through five sessions, before James dissolved it,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} ending unsatisfactorily for both king and Parliament.{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=221}} In the first session, many members feared James's unification would lead to the dissolution of the English [[Common Law]] system. Though many prominent politicians publicly praised the idea of unification and MPs accepted a commission to investigate the union early in Parliament, James's proposed title of the \"king of Great Britain\" was rejected outright.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} Between the first and second sessions, in October 1604, James assumed the title of king of Great Britain by proclamation, controversially circumventing parliament. Unification was not brought up at the second session, in hopes of assuaging outrage,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but by the end of the third session, proposals for unification faced such criticism from MPs that the idea was practically dead.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} It was quietly dropped from discussion in the fourth and fifth sessions.{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}\n\n[[File:John de Critz Robert Cecil Earl of Salisbury c 1608.png||thumb|[[Robert Cecil, Earl of Salisbury]] depicted with the white staff of a [[Lord High Treasurer]]. Though a skilled treasurer, Salisbury was unable to significantly reduce the Crown's crippling debt before his death.]]\n\nDuring the Blessed Parliament, Parliament's own aims saw similar disappointment; James rebuffed the proposed institution of Puritan ecclesiastical reforms,{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} and failed to address two unpopular royal rights, [[purveyance]] and [[wardship]].{{sfn|Wormald|2014}}{{efn|According to Andrew Thrush of [[The History of Parliament]]: \"Purveyance was the right of the Crown to take up provisions for the royal household at below the market rate, while wardship was the right of the Crown to manage the estates of minors whose lands were held of the king.\"{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}}}} In the second session, Parliament granted the king a subsidy of \u00a3400,000, keen to exhibit royal support in the wake of the [[Gunpowder Plot]],{{sfn|Thrush|2010a}} but thanks to the reduction of these subsidies under Elizabeth, this was rather less than the king desired.{{sfn|Wormald|2014}} After a 3-year delay between sessions due to [[Bubonic plague|plague]], the fourth session was called in February 1610, and was dominated by financial discussion. [[Lord High Treasurer]], [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]] proposed the [[Great Contract]]: a financial plan wherein Parliament would grant the Crown \u00a3600,000 immediately (to pay off its debts) and an annual stipend of \u00a3200,000 thereafter; in return, the king was to abolish ten feudal dues, among them, purveyance. After much haggling, in which wardship was added to the abolished dues, the session adjourned on a supportive note. However, when the next session began, support had cooled. Parliament refused to give an annual stipend unless James abolished [[impositions]] as well.{{efn|The feudal duty of impositions were an invaluable source of extra-parliamentary income for James, bringing the Crown \u00a370,000 a year.

By 6 November 1610, James demanded the other \u00a3500,000 and conditioned that, if impositions were to be abolished, Parliament would have to supply him with another equally lucrative income source. Parliament was outraged, and the Contract was abandoned three days later. Though both Salisbury and James made conciliatory gestures in hopes of securing any more financial support from Parliament, James grew impatient.

Many felt this demand was a bluff; the king was stil deeply in debt, and Parliamentary subsidies still seemed his only way out. Instead of effecting any subsidies, the Commons attacked the king mercilessly. His Court, especially the Scots, were accused of extravagance, suggesting the king would have no need for impositions or subsidies if not for these subjects.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} As one member memorably pronounced, James's courtiers were \"spaniels to the king and wolves to the people\".{{sfn|Mathew|1967|p=229}} Possibly encouraged by Northampton,{{efn|According to Moir, Hoskins here \"seems to have been simply the tool of the pro-Spanish [i.e. Northampton's] interests.\"{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} The provocative historical reference was submitted by two of Northampton's lackeys: [[Lionel Sharpe]], [[Sir Charles Cornwallis (diplomat)|Sir Charles Cornwallis]].

Either way, Hoskins was promised the protection of Northampton (and possibly Somerset) and was perhaps given a \u00a320 bribe.{{sfn|Moir|1958|p=140}} This interpretation has been questioned by Peck, who asserts that Hoskyns' misunderstanding of the allusion was \"unlikely\" given his educational background, and Hoskyns was a known opponent of Scottish influence. Thus, in her view: \"it seems more reasonable to view Hoskyns not as the innocent tool or victim of the pro-Spanish interests, but as a member of the Commons who agreed with the idea of sending home the Scots\".{{sfn|Peck|1981|p=550}}}}           Hoskins grimly hinted that the lives of these Scottish courtiers were in danger, alluding to the ethnic massacre of the [[Anjou|Angevins]] in the [[Sicilian Vespers]]; this was communicated to the king as a threat to the life of himself and his closest friends, such that he likely feared himself in danger of assassination.{{sfn|Willson|1967|p=348}} One MP, Sir Thomas Roe, was more prescient, if somewhat melodramatic, in his judgement that the impending dissolution would be \"the ending, not only of this, but of all Parliaments\".{{sfn|Thrush|2014}} The Commons issued their own ultimatum to James: if he abolished impositions, \"wherewith the whole kingdom doth groan\", they would give him financial support.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}}\n\nHowever, James was in no position to give up such a source of income.{{sfn|Thrush|2010b}} While the anti-Northampton faction pleaded with the king to [[Prorogation in the United Kingdom|prorogue]] rather than dissolve Parliament, the king visited Northampton on his deathbed. Northampton persuaded the desperate king to dissolve Parliament, and shortly after James contacted the Spanish Ambassador, [[Diego Sarmiento de Acu\u00f1a, 1st Count of Gondomar|the Count of Gondomar]], to be assured of Spain's support.

Though he was  willing to accept Crown office, he spent much of his career in opposition to  the Government. He was one of the leaders of the protest against the  policies of  the Lord Deputy of Ireland, Sir [[Henry Sidney]],  in the late 1570s, and as a member of the [[Irish House of Commons]] in the 1580s  he successfully opposed  Sidney's successor, Sir [[John Perrot]]. In the early 1600s he was one of the leaders of the protest against strict enforcement of the [[Penal Laws]]. His professional reputation was gravely  damaged in his later years when he was convicted and fined  for having altered a deed concerning the proper disposition of the  11th  Earl of Kildare's estate. He was the grandfather of the playwright Henry Burnell.\n\n==Early life==\nHe was born in [[Castleknock]], County [[Dublin]], son of John Burnell.<ref>Ball, F. Elrington ''The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921'' John Murray London 1926 p.223</ref> The Burnells were a long-established Dublin  family, which had settled at [[Balgriffin]]; they  were descended from Robert Burnell, who was a Baron of the [[Court of Exchequer (Ireland)]] between about 1388 and 1413.<ref>Ball p.223</ref> An earlier [[John Burnell]] was briefly [[Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer]] in the 1490s. The family were staunchly   Roman Catholic and their loyalty to the Crown was sometimes questioned as a result. Henry's father had managed to retain his  estates after his cousin, another  John  Burnell, had been executed for his part in the rebellion of [[Silken Thomas]] in the 1530s. The  elder Henry  was still alive, although described as \"very old\", in 1577. Henry was at [[Lincoln's Inn]]  in 1561-2 and was one of a group of  Irish students who compiled a book detailing the maladministration of [[the Pale]]. He returned to Ireland to practice law about 1564.\n\nIn 1573 he was appointed Recorder of Dublin but resigned  little over a year later. His motives are unclear but since he emerged soon after as legal adviser to [[Gerald FitzGerald, 11th Earl of Kildare|the Earl of Kildare]] it is likely that he found private practice more lucrative.<ref name=\"Ball\">Ball, p.223</ref> Even Sir Henry Sidney, a stern critic of Burnell, admitted that there was no doubt of  his  great success at the Bar, which  made him a rich man.<ref>[[Richard Bagwell]]  ''Ireland Under the Tudors''  London Longman Greens  3 Volumes 1885-90  Vol. II p.329</ref>\n\n==Cess controversy==\nThe ''cess'', a tax levied on the landowners   of  [[the Pale]],  supposedly for military purposes, had always been unpopular, and Burnell had denounced it as early as 1562. In 1576 the [[Lord Deputy of Ireland]], Henry Sidney, announced ambitious plans to reform and extend it. The landowners of the Pale protested that the cost would be ruinous.<ref>Bagwell pp.328-9</ref> Burnell was  one of a deputation of three  eminent lawyers chosen to petition [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] directly against the cess, the others being [[Richard Netterville]] and [[Barnaby Skurloke or Skurlog|Barnaby Skurlock]]. The mission went badly; Elizabeth took grave  offence at the challenge to her [[royal prerogative]] and at Sidney's urging  she imprisoned the three lawyers in the [[Fleet Prison]]. Given his family's previous  association with [[Silken Thomas]] Burnell was vulnerable to accusations of disloyalty.  Sidney, while grudgingly calling him the most honest of the three lawyers (if only he would stay out of politics), accused him of being a \"perverse Papist\" with  \"a great thirst to rid his country of the English.\"<ref name=\"Bagwell p.329\">Bagwell p.329</ref>  As opposition to Sidney's plans mounted and he began thinking of  asking for his   recall to England, the tension eased and the three lawyers  were freed in return for  making an abject apology.<ref>Nolan, Pierce Laurence \"Richard Netterville\" ''Dictionary of National Biography 1885\u20131900 Vol.40'' pp.237\u20138</ref>\n\n==Parliament of 1585==\nBurnell and Richard Netterville returned to their opposition role in the Irish Parliament of 1585,  to which Burnell had been returned as  a [[knight of the shire]] for [[Dublin County (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|County Dublin]]. The new Lord Deputy Sir John Perrot, like Sidney before him,  had an ambitious reform program, but the opposition thwarted him at every opportunity, even insisting on examining his accounts, for which Perrot wished them \"foul scorn\". He imprisoned some of the opposition members,  but was unable to get his  legislative program passed.<ref>Crawford, Jon.G  ''A Star Chamber Court in Ireland -the Court of Castle Chamber 1571\u20131641'' Four Courts Press Dublin 2005 p246</ref>\n\nSomewhat surprisingly Burnell was once more appointed to the Bench in 1590 as third justice of the King's Bench.<ref name=\"Ball\" /> However he served only for a single term, which may suggest  that it was only a temporary office, or that doubts had once more been raised about his loyalty.\n\n==Penal laws==\nBurnell was a staunch [[Roman Catholic]] and strongly objected to the [[Anglican]] settlement; in 1605-6 he was one of the strongest supporters of [[Patrick Barnewall (died 1622)|Patrick Barnewall]] in his protest against the fines imposed for failure to attend [[Anglican]] service and the use of the [[Court of Castle Chamber]] to impose religious conformity.

[[Lettice Digby, 1st Baroness Offaly]] was the granddaughter and heir general of Burnell's old client the 11th Earl of Kildare and his wife [[Mabel Browne]]. Lettice and her husband deeply resented the fact that the great bulk of the Kildare inheritance had passed first to her uncle and then to her cousin [[Gerald FitzGerald, 14th Earl of Kildare]]. By 1602 she had learned that a crucial [[deed]] supposedly executed by her grandfather, who died in 1585, might have been forged or tampered with by his widow. She and her husband [[Robert Digby (courtier)|Sir Robert Digby]] then sued both the  present Earl and the aged Dowager Countess. The case went on for over a decade and involved numerous hearings in several different courts.<ref>Crawford, p.493</ref>\n\nIn 1608 the [[Court of Castle Chamber]], the  Irish equivalent of [[Star Chamber]],  began an inquiry into the [[forgery]] allegation, which transformed a private lawsuit into a matter concerning the Crown.<ref>Something the Court came to regret, since the case was so complex that for two law terms it was unable to deal with any other business: Crawford pp.293-5</ref> The old Countess admitted that she had consulted Burnell in 1585 about the deed, fearing that it did not  adequately protect her [[jointure]], and that Burnell had advised that it did not give adequate protection but that he would make the necessary alterations.<ref>Crawford pp.494\u20135</ref> Burnell himself admitted to having advised on making some alterations \"but without offence\" (presumably he meant without criminal intent). The Chamber acquitted the Countess of any crime, but found Burnell guilty of [[forgery]], a \"grave offence deserving severe punishment\". He was subjected to a heavy fine and to be imprisoned at the Crown's pleasure, although it does not seem the latter penalty was carried out.<ref>Crawford p.496</ref>\n\nJon Crawford  in his detailed analysis  of the trial cautions against placing too much reliance on evidence from witnesses who were describing the events of more than 20 years past.<ref>Crawford p.151</ref> Nonetheless Burnell did admit to having advised that the deed could be altered.  Such behaviour from an eminent lawyer, whom even his critics admitted  an honest man, seems extraordinary, but the Kildares were his most important clients and he may have wished to retain the Countess' business by obliging her in the matter of the deed.\n\n==Family==\nBurnell married into the O'Reilly family of [[Cavan]]; his wife died in 1605. Of their children only one  son Christopher reached adulthood.

The matches were organised to celebrate the ''Victory'' of the Allied Powers in both wars. The term specifically refers to those matches played after the conflicts were over, making them distinct from the wartime internationals which were played during the course of the wars.\n\nAmong the games regarded as Victory Internationals were those played as part of the [[1945\u201346 British Victory Home Championship]]. The 1945\u201346 season also saw England play Victory internationals against [[France national football team|France]], [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. Scotland also played the latter two national teams. The status of these internationals is open to debate. England, Ireland and Wales do not recognize any of these games as full internationals. Scotland, however, does list the games against Belgium and Switzerland as full internationals. Similarly, Belgium, Switzerland and France all regard their Victory Internationals as full internationals.<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/eng-warvic-intres.html     England \u2013 War-Time/Victory

 refers to two series of international [[association football|football]] matches played by the national football teams of [[England national football team|England]], [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Ireland national football team (1882\u20131950)|Ireland]] and [[Wales national football team|Wales]] at end of both the [[First World War|First]] and  [[Second World War]]s. The matches were organised to celebrate the ''Victory'' of the Allied Powers in both wars. The term specifically refers to those matches played after the conflicts were over, making them distinct from the wartime internationals which were played during the course of the wars.\n\nAmong the games regarded as Victory Internationals were those played as part of the [[1945\u201346 British Victory Home Championship]]. The 1945\u201346 season also saw England play Victory internationals against [[France national football team|France]], [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] and [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]]. Scotland also played the latter two national teams. The status of these internationals is open to debate. England, Ireland and Wales do not recognize any of these games as full internationals. Scotland, however, does list the games against Belgium and Switzerland as full internationals.  Similarly Belgium, Switzerland and France all regard their Victory Internationals as full internationals. \n<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablese/eng-warvic-intres.html     England - War-Time/Victory Internationals]</ref>\n<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesf/fran-intres.html    France - List of International Matches]</ref>\n<ref>[http://www.rsssf.com/tabless/scot-intres1950.html   Scotland - International Matches 1946-1950]</ref>\n<ref>[http://nifootball.blogspot.co.uk/2008/02/ireland-victory-internationals-1919.html    Northern Ireland\u2019s Footballing Greats]</ref>\n\n==1918\u201319==\n{{football box |\n | date = 22 March 1919\n | team1 = {{fb-rt|SCO}}\n | score = 2\u20131\n | team2 = {{fb|IRE}}\n | goals1 =  [[Andrew Wilson (footballer born 1896)|Andrew Wilson]] 2\n | goals2 = [[Billy Halligan]]\n | stadium = [[Ibrox Park]] }}\n----\n{{football box |\n | date = 19 April  1919\n | team1 = {{fb-rt|IRE}}\n | score = 0\u20130\n | team2 = {{fb|SCO}}\n | goals1 =  \n | goals2 = \n | stadium = [[Windsor Park]], [[Belfast]] }}\n----\n{{football box |\n | date = 26 April 1919\n | team1 = {{fb|ENG}}\n | score = 2\u20132\n | team2 = {{fb-rt|SCO}}\n | goals1 = [[Robert Turnbull (footballer)|Robert Turnbull]]<br>[[Sydney Puddefoot]]\n | goals2 = J Wright<br> [[James Bowie (footballer)|James Bowie]]\n | stadium = [[Goodison Park]] }}\n----\n{{football box |\n | date = 3 May 1919\n | team1 = {{fb|SCO}}\n | score = 3\u20134\n | team2 = {{fb-rt|ENG}}\n | goals1 = [[Andrew Wilson (footballer born 1896)|Andrew Wilson]] 2<br>[[Alan Morton]]\n | goals2 = [[Arthur Grimsdell]] 2<br> [[Sydney Puddefoot]] 2\n | stadium = [[Hampden Park]] }}\n\n== 1919\u201320==\n{{football box |\n | date = 11 October  1919\n | team1 = {{fb-rt|WAL}}\n | score = 2\u2013 1\n | team2 = {{fb|ENG}}\n | goals1 = [[Billy Meredith]]<br>[[George Wynn]]\n | goals2 = [[Sydney Puddefoot]]\n | stadium = [[Ninian Park]], [[Cardiff]] }}\n----\n{{football box |\n | date = 19 October  1919\n | team1 = {{fb-rt|ENG}}\n | score = 2\u20130\n | team2 = {{fb|WAL}}\n | goals1 = [[Bob Whittingham]]<br>[[Joe Smith (football forward born 1889)|Joe Smith]]\n | goals2 = \n | stadium = [[Victoria Ground]] }}\n\n==1945\u201346==\n{{see also|1945\u201346 British Victory Home Championship}}\n\n{{football box |\n | date = 15 September 1945\n | team1 = {{fb|IRE}}\n | score = 0 \u2013 1\n | team2 = {{fb-rt|ENG}}\n | goals1 = &nbsp;\n | goals2 = [[Stan Mortensen]]\n | stadium = [[Windsor Park]], [[Belfast]] }}\n----\n{{football box |\n | date = 20 October 1945\n | team1 = {{fb|ENG}}\n | score = 0 \u2013 1\n | team2 = {{fb-rt|WAL}}\n | goals1 = &nbsp;
