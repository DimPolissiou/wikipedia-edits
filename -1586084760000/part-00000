Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the Federal Security Service Employee Day in December 2001, Tkachenko said that the gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a hunting cartridge that would not be able to detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{in lang|ru}} [http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm Today is the Federal Security Service Employee Day: Satisfied with the year summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |date=31 January 2011 }}, [[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]], 20 December 2001, [https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&tl=en&u=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244%26m=8.htm computer translation]</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, the Russian newspaper ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' reported the account of Private Alexei Pinyayev of the 137th Regiment, who guarded a military facility near the city of Ryazan.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

It was a major battle of the [[Wars of the Roses]]. The opposing forces were an army led by nobles loyal to the captive King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] of the [[House of Lancaster]] and his Queen [[Margaret of Anjou]] on one side, and the army of [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], the rival claimant to the throne, on the other.\n\nFor several years before the battle, the Duke of York had become increasingly opposed to the weak King Henry's court. After Henry became his prisoner, he laid claim to the throne, but lacked sufficient support. Instead, in an agreement known as the [[Act of Accord]], he was made Henry's heir to the throne, displacing from the succession Henry's and Margaret's 7-year-old son [[Edward of Westminster|Edward, Prince of Wales]]. Margaret of Anjou and several prominent nobles were irreconcilably opposed to this accord, and massed their armies in the north. Richard of York marched north to deal with them, but found he was outnumbered.\n\nAlthough he occupied [[Sandal Castle]], York sortied from the castle on 30 December. His reasons for doing so have been variously ascribed to deception by the Lancastrian armies, or treachery by some nobles and Lancastrian officers who York thought were his allies, or simple rashness or miscalculation by York. The Duke of York was killed and his army was destroyed. Many of the prominent Yorkist leaders and their family members died in the battle or were captured and executed.\n\n==Background==\nKing Henry VI ascended the throne in 1422, when he was only nine months old. He grew up to be an ineffective king, and prone to spells of mental illness. There were increasingly bitter divisions among the officials and councillors who governed in Henry's name, mainly over the conduct of the [[Hundred Years' War]] with France. By the early 1450s, the most important rivalry was that between [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], and [[Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset]]. York argued for a more vigorous prosecution of the war, to recover territories recently lost to the French,<ref>Clark (2016), p. 45</ref> while Somerset belonged to the party which tried to secure peace by making concessions.<ref>Rowse, pp. 111, 112</ref> York had been Lieutenant in France for several years and resented being supplanted in that office by Somerset, who had then failed to defend [[Normandy]] against French armies.<ref>Rowse, pp. 112, 119</ref>\n\nYork was not only the wealthiest magnate in the land,<ref>Rowse, p. 109</ref> but was also descended through both his parents from  [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]], leading to calls that he be recognised as successor to the childless King Henry.<ref>Seward, p. 35</ref> His rival, Somerset, belonged to the [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort family]], who were distant cousins of King Henry. Originally illegitimate, the Beauforts had been made legitimate by an Act of Parliament but were supposedly barred from the line of succession to the throne.<ref>Goodwin (2012), p. 76</ref> However, there was always the possibility that this could be circumvented and the Beaufort line eventually produced King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and the [[Tudor dynasty]].\n\nYork was appointed [[Chief governor of Ireland|Lieutenant of Ireland]], effectively exiling him from court, while Somerset increased his influence over the King. In 1452, York marched on London in an attempt to force Henry to dismiss Somerset from the government, but at this stage he lacked support and was forced to swear not to take arms against the King at [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]].<ref>Seward, p. 38</ref> Then in 1453, Henry VI suffered a complete mental breakdown. The [[Magnum Concilium|Great Council]] of peers appointed York [[Lord Protector]] and he governed the country responsibly, but Henry recovered his sanity after eighteen months and restored Somerset to favour. During Henry's madness his Queen, [[Margaret of Anjou]], had given birth to a son, which dashed York's hopes of becoming king if Henry died.<ref>Weir (2015), p.177</ref>\n\nFearing arrest for treason, York and his most prominent allies, the Nevilles (York's brother in law, the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]] and his son, the [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], later known as the \"Kingmaker\"), finally resorted to armed force in 1455. At the [[First Battle of St Albans]], many of York's and Salisbury's rivals and enemies were killed, including Somerset, the [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] (whose family, the Percys, had been involved in a [[Percy-Neville feud|long-running feud]] with the Nevilles) and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford|Lord Clifford]].<ref>Rowse, p. 136</ref>\n\nAfter the battle, York reaffirmed his loyalty to King Henry, who had been found abandoned in a shop in the town. He was reappointed Lord Protector and Lieutenant of Ireland. Margaret of Anjou nevertheless suspected York of wishing to supplant her infant son, Edward, as Henry's successor, and the heirs of the Lancastrian nobles who were killed at St Albans remained at deadly [[feud]] with York.<ref name=Rose143>Rowse, p. 143</ref>\n\n==Events of the year preceding Wakefield==\nAfter an uneasy peace during which attempts at reconciliation failed, hostilities broke out again in 1459. Richard of York once again feared indictment for rebellion by a Great Council dominated by his opponents.<ref>Goodwin (2012), p. 116</ref> He and the Nevilles concentrated their forces near York's stronghold at [[Ludlow Castle]] in the [[Welsh Marches]] but at the confrontation with the royal army which became known as the [[Battle of Ludford]], some of Warwick's contingent from the garrison of [[Calais]], led by experienced captain [[Andrew Trollope]], defected overnight. York and the Nevilles promptly abandoned their troops and fled. The next day, the outnumbered and leaderless Yorkist army surrendered.<ref>Weir (2015), p. 230</ref>\n\nYork went to Ireland, where he had unchallenged support, while Salisbury, Warwick and York's eldest son [[Edward IV of England|Edward, Earl of March]] made their way to Calais, where Warwick was [[Constable of Calais|Constable]]. They narrowly forestalled the new [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]] who, with Trollope, had been sent to regain it.<ref>Weir, pp. 232\u2013233</ref> Lancastrian attempts to reassert their authority over Ireland and Calais failed, but York and his supporters were declared traitors and [[attainder|attainted]]. The victorious Lancastrians became reviled for the manner in which their army had looted the town of Ludlow after the Yorkist surrender at Ludford Bridge, and the repressive acts of a compliant [[Parliament of Devils]] which caused many uncommitted peers to fear for their own property and titles.<ref>Seward, pp. 71\u201372</ref> The country remained in disorder.\n\nIn 1460, the Nevilles invaded England through a foothold they had already established at [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]] and rapidly secured London and the South of England where Warwick had popular support. They then advanced north to engage Henry's army in the Midlands. At the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]], part of the Lancastrian army defected and the rest were decisively defeated.<ref>Hicks, Michael. ''The Wars of the Roses'', (Yale University Press, 2010), 153.</ref> Henry was captured on the battlefield for the second time. He was taken to London, and confined in the [[Bishop of London]]'s palace.<ref>Rowse, p. 141</ref> [[George Neville (bishop)|George Neville]], Bishop of Exeter, was appointed Chancellor of England and [[Henry Bourchier, 1st Earl of Essex|Viscount Bourchier]] (York's brother in law) was appointed Treasurer.<ref>Ross, Charles. ''Edward IV'', (University of California Press, 1974), p. 27</ref>\n\nThe Duke of York landed in [[Chester]] some weeks later and made his way to London with much pomp. Entering [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], he attempted to claim the throne, but was met with stunned silence. Even his close allies were not prepared to support such a drastic step.<ref>Seward, p. 82</ref> Instead, after the [[House of Lords]] had considered his claim, they passed the [[Act of Accord]], by which Henry would remain king, but York would govern the country as Lord Protector. Henry's son was disinherited, and York or his heirs would become king on Henry's death.<ref>Rowse, p. 142</ref> The powerless and frightened Henry was forced to assent.\n\n===Lancastrian moves===\nWhen the Battle of Northampton was fought, Queen Margaret and her seven-year-old son Edward had been at [[Eccleshall Castle]] near [[Coventry]]. After many adventures with brigands and outlaws<ref name=Rowse143>Rowse, p.143</ref> they fled via [[Cheshire]] to [[Harlech Castle]] in North Wales, where they joined Lancastrian nobles (including Henry's half-brother [[Jasper Tudor]] and the [[Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter|Duke of Exeter]]) who were recruiting armies in Wales and the [[West Country]]. They later proceeded by ship to [[Scotland]], where Margaret gained troops and other aid for the Lancastrian cause from the Queen and Regent, [[Mary of Guelders]], in return for the surrender of the town and castle of [[Berwick upon Tweed]].<ref name=Rowse144>Rowse, p. 144</ref>\n\nAt the same time, other Lancastrians were rallying in [[Northern England]]. Many of them, including the [[Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] and Lords [[John Clifford, 9th Baron de Clifford|Clifford]] and [[Thomas de Ros, 9th Baron de Ros|Ros]], had estates and influence in the north. They were later joined by the [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]]{{#tag:ref|Somerset had been besieging Calais, but was outwardly reconciled to Warwick on 8 August 1460 and allowed to return to England<ref>Clark (2016), p. 224</ref>|group=nb}} and the [[Thomas Courtenay, 14th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], who brought their forces from the West Country.<ref name=Rowse143/> Northumberland, Clifford and Somerset were the sons of York's and Salisbury's rivals who had been killed at St. Albans. The Lancastrian forces mustered near [[Kingston upon Hull]], and were said (in ''Gregory's Chronicle'', a near-contemporary account) to number 15,000. A substantial part of these forces encamped at [[Pontefract]] began pillaging York's and Salisbury's estates nearby.<ref name=Rowse143/>\n\n===York's response===\nFaced with these challenges to his authority as Protector, York despatched his eldest son Edward to the Welsh Marches to contain the Lancastrians in Wales and left the Earl of Warwick in charge in London. He himself marched to the north of England on 9 December, accompanied by his second son [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]], and the Earl of Salisbury. He tried to bring a train of artillery under \"one called Lovelace, a gentleman of Kent\"<ref>Clark (2016), p. 229</ref> but bad weather forced the artillery to return to London.\n\nYork's and Salisbury's army was said by some to number 8,000 to 9,000 men, but by others to be only a few hundred strong, as York intended to recruit local forces with a [[Commission of Array]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.richardiii.net/downloads/Ricardian/essay_wakefield.pdf| format=PDF| title=Richard III.net| accessdate=30 June 2009|author=Dockray, Keith| page=8}}</ref> He had probably underestimated both the numbers of the Lancastrian army in the north and the degree of opposition he had provoked by his attempt to seize the throne. On an earlier expedition to the north during his first protectorship in 1454, he and the Nevilles had easily subdued a rebellion by the Percys and the Duke of Exeter.<ref>Clark (2016), pp.120\u2013125</ref> In 1460, not only had almost every other northern peer joined the Lancastian army, but York's nominal supporters were also divided. The Nevilles were one of the wealthiest and most influential families in the North and in addition to controlling large estates, the Earl of Salisbury had held the office of [[Lord Warden of the Marches#Warden of the Eastern March|Warden of the Eastern March]] for several years. However, in the [[Neville-Neville feud]], the cadet branch of the family headed by Salisbury had largely disinherited and eclipsed the senior branch under his great nephew, the [[Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland|Earl of Westmoreland]]. Westmoreland had spent several years trying to recover his lands.<ref>Clark (2016), p. 50</ref> He had since become too ill, perhaps with some mental disorder, to play any active part. His younger brother, [[John Neville, Baron Neville|John Neville of Raby]], had much to gain by York's and Salisbury's destruction.<ref name=Goodwin145>Goodwin (2012), pp. 145\u2013146</ref>\n\nThe Lancastrians were still being reinforced. On 16 December, at the [[Battle of Worksop]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], York's vanguard clashed with Somerset's contingent from the West Country moving north to join the Lancastrian army, and was defeated.<ref name=Warner49>Warner, p. 49</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:SandalCastleMotte.jpg|right|thumb|The remains of the [[motte-and-bailey|motte]] of Sandal Castle]]\nOn 21 December, York reached his own fortress of [[Sandal Castle]] near Wakefield. He sent probes towards the Lancastrian camp at Pontefract {{convert|9|mi|km}} to the east, but these were repulsed. York sent for help to his son Edward, but before any reinforcements could arrive, he sortied from the castle on 30 December.<ref>Weir (2015), p. 253</ref>\n\nIt is not known for certain why York did so. One theory was later recounted in ''[[Edward Hall]]'s chronicle'', written a few decades after the event, but partly from first-hand sources, and the contemporary [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] ''[[Jean de Waurin]]'s'' chronicle. In a stratagem possibly devised by the veteran Andrew Trollope (who by Waurin's account had also sent messages to York via feigned deserters that he was prepared to change sides once again)<ref>Seward (2007), p. 83</ref> half the Lancastrian army under Somerset and Clifford advanced openly towards Sandal Castle, over the open space known as \"Wakefield Green\" between the castle and the [[River Calder, West Yorkshire|River Calder]], while the remainder under Ros and the [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|Earl of Wiltshire]] were concealed in the woods surrounding the area.<ref name=Dockray10>{{cite web| url=http://www.richardiii.net/downloads/Ricardian/essay_wakefield.pdf| format=PDF| title=Richard III.net| accessdate=30 June 2009| author=Dockray, Keith| pages=9\u201310}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|However, Wiltshire was almost certainly not present. He had fled to the continent shortly before the Nevilles landed at Sandwich<ref>Clark (2016), p. 217</ref> and landed in South Wales with a force of Breton, French and Irish mercenaries in the early weeks of 1461.<ref>Clark (2016), p. 234</ref>|group=nb}} York was probably short of provisions in the castle and, seeing that the enemy were apparently no stronger than his own army, seized the opportunity to engage them in the open rather than withstand a siege while waiting for reinforcements.<ref name=Warner50>Warner, p. 50</ref>\n\nOther accounts suggested that, possibly in addition to Trollope's deception, York was fooled by some of John Neville of Raby's forces displaying false colours into thinking that reinforcements sent by Warwick had arrived. By another contemporary account, [[William Worcester]]'s ''Annales Rerum Anglicorum'', John Neville himself obtained a Commission of Array from Richard of York to raise 8,000 men to fight on York's side under the Earl of Westmoreland.<ref name=Goodwin145/> Having gathered this force and enticed York to leave the castle to rendezvous with him, John Neville then defected to the Lancastrians.<ref name=Dockray10/>\n\nAnother suggestion was that York and Somerset had agreed a truce during Christmas until 6 January, the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of Epiphany]], but the Lancastrians had no intention of honouring the truce. On three successive days, they sent heralds to provoke York into premature action with insulting messages<ref>Weir (1995), p. 255</ref> and when York moved into the open the Lancastrians treacherously attacked earlier than had been agreed, catching York at a disadvantage while many of his men were absent foraging for supplies.<ref>Ross, Charles. ''Edward IV'', (University of California Press, 1974), p. 30</ref>\n\nThe simplest suggestion was that York acted rashly.<ref name=Rowse143/> For example, historian [[John Sadler (historian)|John Sadler]] states that there was no Lancastrian deception or ambush; York led his men from the castle on a foraging expedition (or by popular belief, to rescue some of his foragers who were under attack)<ref>Clark (2016), p. 230</ref> and as successive Lancastrian contingents joined the battle (the last being Clifford's division, encamped south and east of Sandal Magna), York's army was outnumbered, surrounded and overwhelmed.<ref name=Sadler60>Sadler (2011), p. 60</ref>\n\nThe Yorkists marched out of Sandal Castle down the present-day Manygates Lane towards the Lancastrians located to the north of the castle. It is generally accepted that, as York engaged the Lancastrians to his front, others attacked him from the flank and rear, cutting him off from the castle. In Edward Hall's words:\n\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;but when he was in the plain ground between his castle and the town of Wakefield, he was environed on every side, like a fish in a net, or a deer in a buckstall; so that he manfully fighting was within half an hour slain and dead, and his whole army discomfited.<ref name=Dockray12>{{cite web| url=http://www.richardiii.net/downloads/Ricardian/essay_wakefield.pdf| format=PDF| title=Richard III.net| accessdate=30 June 2009| author=Dockray, Keith| page=12}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Casualties===\nOne near-contemporary source (''Gregory's Chronicle'') claimed that 2,500 Yorkists and 200 Lancastrians were killed, but other sources give wildly differing figures, from 2,200 to only 700 Yorkist dead.\n\nThe Duke of York was either killed in the battle or captured and immediately executed. Some later works support the folklore that he suffered a crippling wound to the knee and was unhorsed, and he and his closest followers then fought to the death at that spot;<ref name=Sadler60/> others relate the account that he was taken prisoner (by one Sir James Luttrell of Devonshire), mocked by his captors and beheaded.<ref>{{cite book| last=Jones| first=Dan| title=The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses and the Rise of the Tudors| publisher=Faber & Faber| year=2014| isbn=9780571288090| page=187}}</ref>\n\nHis son [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]] attempted to escape over Wakefield Bridge, but was overtaken and killed, possibly by Clifford in revenge for his father's death at St Albans. Salisbury's second son [[Thomas Neville (died 1460)|Sir Thomas Neville]] also died in the battle.<ref name=Rowse144/> Salisbury's son in law [[William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington|William, Lord Harington]] and Harington's father, William Bonville, were captured and executed immediately after the battle. (The Bonvilles had been engaged in a [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|feud]] with the Earl of Devon and the Courtenay family in Devon and Cornwall.) Salisbury himself escaped the battlefield but was captured during the night, and was taken to the Lancastrian camp. Although the Lancastrian nobles might have been prepared to allow Salisbury to ransom himself, he was dragged out of Pontefract Castle and beheaded by local commoners, to whom he had been a harsh overlord.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.richardiii.net/downloads/Ricardian/essay_wakefield.pdf| format=PDF| title=Richard III.net| accessdate=30 June 2009| author=Dockray, Keith| page=14}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Richard of York Memorial Inscription - geograph.org.uk - 858006.jpg|right|thumb|Monument to Richard of York]]\nAfter the battle the heads of York, Rutland and Salisbury were displayed over [[York city walls#Micklegate Bar|Micklegate Bar]], the south-western gate through the [[York city walls]], the Duke wearing a paper crown and a sign saying \"Let York overlook the town of York\".<ref>Weir (2015), p.257</ref>\n\nThe death of Richard of York did not end the wars, or the [[House of York]]'s claim to the throne. The northern Lancastrian army which had been victorious at Wakefield was reinforced by Scots and borderers eager for plunder, and marched south. They defeated Warwick's army at the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] and recaptured the feeble-minded King Henry, who had been abandoned on the battlefield for the third time, but were refused entry to London<ref>Charles Ross, ''Edward IV'', (University of California Press, 1974), 32.</ref> and failed to occupy the city. Warwick and Edward of March reoccupied London, and within a few weeks, Edward of March was proclaimed King Edward IV.\n\nAt the first Battle of St Albans, York had been content with the death of his rivals for power. At Wakefield and in every battle in the Wars of the Roses thereafter, the victors would eliminate not only any opposing leaders but also their family members and supporters, making the struggle more bitter and revenge driven.<ref>{{cite book| last=Hicks| first=Michael| title=The Wars of the Roses| publisher=Yale University Press| year=2012| page=160}}</ref>\n\nA monument erected on the spot where the Duke of York is supposed to have perished is positioned slightly south of the more likely spot where an older monument once stood, but which was destroyed during the [[English Civil War]]. A cross in memory of York's son, Rutland, was erected at the Park Street end of Kirkgate in Wakefield.<ref>Weir (2015), p. 256</ref> Archaeologist Rachel Askew suggests that the memorial cross to the Duke of York may be fictional as the late 16th and early 17th century antiquarian John Camden did not mention it in his description of the location.<ref>Askew (2016), p. 54</ref>\n\n==In literature and folklore==\nMany people are familiar with [[William Shakespeare]]'s melodramatic version of events in ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'', notably the murder of Edmund of Rutland, although Edmund is depicted as a small child, and following his unnecessary slaughter by Clifford, Margaret torments his father, York, before murdering him also. In fact, Rutland, at seventeen, was more than old enough to be an active participant in the fighting.

It was a major battle of the [[Wars of the Roses]]. The opposing forces were an army led by nobles loyal to the captive King [[Henry VI of England|Henry VI]] of the [[House of Lancaster]] and his Queen [[Margaret of Anjou]] on one side, and the army of [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], the rival claimant to the throne, on the other.\n\nFor several years before the battle, the Duke of York had become increasingly opposed to the weak King Henry's court. After Henry became his prisoner, he laid claim to the throne, but lacked sufficient support. Instead, in an agreement known as the [[Act of Accord]], he was made Henry's heir to the throne, displacing from the succession Henry's and Margaret's 7-year-old son [[Edward of Westminster|Edward, Prince of Wales]]. Margaret of Anjou and several prominent nobles were irreconcilably opposed to this accord, and massed their armies in the north. Richard of York marched north to deal with them, but found he was outnumbered.\n\nAlthough he occupied [[Sandal Castle]], York sortied from the castle on 30 December. His reasons for doing so have been variously ascribed to deception by the Lancastrian armies, or treachery by some nobles and Lancastrian officers who York thought were his allies, or simple rashness or miscalculation by York. The Duke of York was killed and his army was destroyed. Many of the prominent Yorkist leaders and their family members died in the battle or were captured and executed.\n\n==Background==\nKing Henry VI ascended the throne in 1422, when he was only nine months old. He grew up to be an ineffective king, and prone to spells of mental illness. There were increasingly bitter divisions among the officials and councillors who governed in Henry's name, mainly over the conduct of the [[Hundred Years' War]] with France. By the early 1450s, the most important rivalry was that between [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], and [[Edmund Beaufort, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edmund Beaufort, Duke of Somerset]]. York argued for a more vigorous prosecution of the war, to recover territories recently lost to the French,<ref>Clark (2016), p. 45</ref> while Somerset belonged to the party which tried to secure peace by making concessions.<ref>Rowse, pp. 111, 112</ref> York had been Lieutenant in France for several years and resented being supplanted in that office by Somerset, who had then failed to defend [[Normandy]] against French armies.<ref>Rowse, pp. 112, 119</ref>\n\nYork was not only the wealthiest magnate in the land,<ref>Rowse, p. 109</ref> but was also descended through both his parents from  [[Edward III of England|King Edward III]], leading to calls that he be recognised as successor to the childless King Henry.<ref>Seward, p. 35</ref> His rival, Somerset, belonged to the [[House of Beaufort|Beaufort family]], who were distant cousins of King Henry. Originally illegitimate, the Beauforts had been made legitimate by an Act of Parliament but were supposedly barred from the line of succession to the throne.<ref>Goodwin (2012), p. 76</ref> However, there was always the possibility that this could be circumvented and the Beaufort line eventually produced King [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] and the [[Tudor dynasty]].\n\nYork was appointed [[Chief governor of Ireland|Lieutenant of Ireland]], effectively exiling him from court, while Somerset increased his influence over the King. In 1452, York marched on London in an attempt to force Henry to dismiss Somerset from the government, but at this stage he lacked support and was forced to swear not to take arms against the King at [[Old St Paul's Cathedral]].<ref>Seward, p. 38</ref> Then in 1453, Henry VI suffered a complete mental breakdown. The [[Magnum Concilium|Great Council]] of peers appointed York [[Lord Protector]] and he governed the country responsibly, but Henry recovered his sanity after eighteen months and restored Somerset to favour. During Henry's madness his Queen, [[Margaret of Anjou]], had given birth to a son, which dashed York's hopes of becoming king if Henry died.<ref>Weir (2015), p.177</ref>\n\nFearing arrest for treason, York and his most prominent allies, the Nevilles (York's brother in law, the [[Richard Neville, 5th Earl of Salisbury|Earl of Salisbury]] and his son, the [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], later known as the \"Kingmaker\"), finally resorted to armed force in 1455. At the [[First Battle of St Albans]], many of York's and Salisbury's rivals and enemies were killed, including Somerset, the [[Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] (whose family, the Percys, had been involved in a [[Percy-Neville feud|long-running feud]] with the Nevilles) and [[Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford|Lord Clifford]].<ref>Rowse, p. 136</ref>\n\nAfter the battle, York reaffirmed his loyalty to King Henry, who had been found abandoned in a shop in the town. He was reappointed Lord Protector and Lieutenant of Ireland. Margaret of Anjou nevertheless suspected York of wishing to supplant her infant son, Edward, as Henry's successor, and the heirs of the Lancastrian nobles who were killed at St Albans remained at deadly [[feud]] with York.<ref name=Rose143>Rowse, p. 143</ref>\n\n==Events of the year preceding Wakefield==\nAfter an uneasy peace during which attempts at reconciliation failed, hostilities broke out again in 1459. Richard of York once again feared indictment for rebellion by a Great Council dominated by his opponents.<ref>Goodwin (2012), p. 116</ref> He and the Nevilles concentrated their forces near York's stronghold at [[Ludlow Castle]] in the [[Welsh Marches]] but at the confrontation with the royal army which became known as the [[Battle of Ludford]], some of Warwick's contingent from the garrison of [[Calais]], led by experienced captain [[Andrew Trollope]], defected overnight. York and the Nevilles promptly abandoned their troops and fled. The next day, the outnumbered and leaderless Yorkist army surrendered.<ref>Weir (2015), p. 230</ref>\n\nYork went to Ireland, where he had unchallenged support, while Salisbury, Warwick and York's eldest son [[Edward IV of England|Edward, Earl of March]] made their way to Calais, where Warwick was [[Constable of Calais|Constable]]. They narrowly forestalled the new [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]] who, with Trollope, had been sent to regain it.<ref>Weir, pp. 232\u2013233</ref> Lancastrian attempts to reassert their authority over Ireland and Calais failed, but York and his supporters were declared traitors and [[attainder|attainted]]. The victorious Lancastrians became reviled for the manner in which their army had looted the town of Ludlow after the Yorkist surrender at Ludford Bridge, and the repressive acts of a compliant [[Parliament of Devils]] which caused many uncommitted peers to fear for their own property and titles.<ref>Seward, pp. 71\u201372</ref> The country remained in disorder.\n\nIn 1460, the Nevilles invaded England through a foothold they had already established at [[Sandwich, Kent|Sandwich]] and rapidly secured London and the South of England where Warwick had popular support. They then advanced north to engage Henry's army in the Midlands. At the [[Battle of Northampton (1460)|Battle of Northampton]], part of the Lancastrian army defected and the rest were decisively defeated.<ref>Hicks, Michael. ''The Wars of the Roses'', (Yale University Press, 2010), 153.</ref> Henry was captured on the battlefield for the second time. He was taken to London, and confined in the [[Bishop of London]]'s palace.<ref>Rowse, p. 141</ref> [[George Neville (bishop)|George Neville]], Bishop of Exeter, was appointed Chancellor of England and [[Henry Bourchier, 1st Earl of Essex|Viscount Bourchier]] (York's brother in law) was appointed Treasurer.<ref>Ross, Charles. ''Edward IV'', (University of California Press, 1974), p. 27</ref>\n\nThe Duke of York landed in [[Chester]] some weeks later and made his way to London with much pomp. Entering [[Parliament of England|Parliament]], he attempted to claim the throne, but was met with stunned silence. Even his close allies were not prepared to support such a drastic step.<ref>Seward, p. 82</ref> Instead, after the [[House of Lords]] had considered his claim, they passed the [[Act of Accord]], by which Henry would remain king, but York would govern the country as Lord Protector. Henry's son was disinherited, and York or his heirs would become king on Henry's death.<ref>Rowse, p. 142</ref> The powerless and frightened Henry was forced to assent.\n\n===Lancastrian moves===\nWhen the Battle of Northampton was fought, Queen Margaret and her seven-year-old son Edward had been at [[Eccleshall Castle]] near [[Coventry]]. After many adventures with brigands and outlaws<ref name=Rowse143>Rowse, p.143</ref> they fled via [[Cheshire]] to [[Harlech Castle]] in North Wales, where they joined Lancastrian nobles (including Henry's half-brother [[Jasper Tudor]] and the [[Henry Holland, 3rd Duke of Exeter|Duke of Exeter]]) who were recruiting armies in Wales and the [[West Country]]. They later proceeded by ship to [[Scotland]], where Margaret gained troops and other aid for the Lancastrian cause from the Queen and Regent, [[Mary of Guelders]], in return for the surrender of the town and castle of [[Berwick upon Tweed]].<ref name=Rowse144>Rowse, p. 144</ref>\n\nAt the same time, other Lancastrians were rallying in [[Northern England]]. Many of them, including the [[Henry Percy, 3rd Earl of Northumberland|Earl of Northumberland]] and Lords [[John Clifford, 9th Baron de Clifford|Clifford]] and [[Thomas de Ros, 9th Baron de Ros|Ros]], had estates and influence in the north. They were later joined by the [[Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]]{{#tag:ref|Somerset had been besieging Calais, but was outwardly reconciled to Warwick on 8 August 1460 and allowed to return to England<ref>Clark (2016), p. 224</ref>|group=nb}} and the [[Thomas Courtenay, 14th Earl of Devon|Earl of Devon]], who brought their forces from the West Country.<ref name=Rowse143/> Northumberland, Clifford and Somerset were the sons of York's and Salisbury's rivals who had been killed at St. Albans. The Lancastrian forces mustered near [[Kingston upon Hull]], and were said (in ''Gregory's Chronicle'', a near-contemporary account) to number 15,000. A substantial part of these forces encamped at [[Pontefract]] began pillaging York's and Salisbury's estates nearby.<ref name=Rowse143/>\n\n===York's response===\nFaced with these challenges to his authority as Protector, York despatched his eldest son Edward to the Welsh Marches to contain the Lancastrians in Wales and left the Earl of Warwick in charge in London. He himself marched to the north of England on 9 December, accompanied by his second son [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]], and the Earl of Salisbury. He tried to bring a train of artillery under \"one called Lovelace, a gentleman of Kent\"<ref>Clark (2016), p. 229</ref> but bad weather forced the artillery to return to London.\n\nYork's and Salisbury's army was said by some to number 8,000 to 9,000 men, but by others to be only a few hundred strong, as York intended to recruit local forces with a [[Commission of Array]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.richardiii.net/downloads/Ricardian/essay_wakefield.pdf| format=PDF| title=Richard III.net| accessdate=30 June 2009|author=Dockray, Keith| page=8}}</ref> He had probably underestimated both the numbers of the Lancastrian army in the north and the degree of opposition he had provoked by his attempt to seize the throne. On an earlier expedition to the north during his first protectorship in 1454, he and the Nevilles had easily subdued a rebellion by the Percys and the Duke of Exeter.<ref>Clark (2016), pp.120\u2013125</ref> In 1460, not only had almost every other northern peer joined the Lancastian army, but York's nominal supporters were also divided. The Nevilles were one of the wealthiest and most influential families in the North and in addition to controlling large estates, the Earl of Salisbury had held the office of [[Lord Warden of the Marches#Warden of the Eastern March|Warden of the Eastern March]] for several years. However, in the [[Neville-Neville feud]], the cadet branch of the family headed by Salisbury had largely disinherited and eclipsed the senior branch under his great nephew, the [[Ralph Neville, 2nd Earl of Westmorland|Earl of Westmoreland]]. Westmoreland had spent several years trying to recover his lands.<ref>Clark (2016), p. 50</ref> He had since become too ill, perhaps with some mental disorder, to play any active part. His younger brother, [[John Neville, Baron Neville|John Neville of Raby]], had much to gain by York's and Salisbury's destruction.<ref name=Goodwin145>Goodwin (2012), pp. 145\u2013146</ref>\n\nThe Lancastrians were still being reinforced. On 16 December, at the [[Battle of Worksop]] in [[Nottinghamshire]], York's vanguard clashed with Somerset's contingent from the West Country moving north to join the Lancastrian army, and was defeated.<ref name=Warner49>Warner, p. 49</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:SandalCastleMotte.jpg|right|thumb|The remains of the [[motte-and-bailey|motte]] of Sandal Castle]]\nOn 21 December, York reached his own fortress of [[Sandal Castle]] near Wakefield. He sent probes towards the Lancastrian camp at Pontefract {{convert|9|mi|km}} to the east, but these were repulsed. York sent for help to his son Edward, but before any reinforcements could arrive, he sortied from the castle on 30 December.<ref>Weir (2015), p. 253</ref>\n\nIt is not known for certain why York did so. One theory was later recounted in ''[[Edward Hall]]'s chronicle'', written a few decades after the event, but partly from first-hand sources, and the contemporary [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian]] ''[[Jean de Waurin]]'s'' chronicle. In a stratagem possibly devised by the veteran Andrew Trollope (who by Waurin's account had also sent messages to York via feigned deserters that he was prepared to change sides once again)<ref>Seward (2007), p. 83</ref> half the Lancastrian army under Somerset and Clifford advanced openly towards Sandal Castle, over the open space known as \"Wakefield Green\" between the castle and the [[River Calder, West Yorkshire|River Calder]], while the remainder under Ros and the [[James Butler, 5th Earl of Ormond|Earl of Wiltshire]] were concealed in the woods surrounding the area.<ref name=Dockray10>{{cite web| url=http://www.richardiii.net/downloads/Ricardian/essay_wakefield.pdf| format=PDF| title=Richard III.net| accessdate=30 June 2009| author=Dockray, Keith| pages=9\u201310}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|However, Wiltshire was almost certainly not present. He had fled to the continent shortly before the Nevilles landed at Sandwich<ref>Clark (2016), p. 217</ref> and landed in South Wales with a force of Breton, French and Irish mercenaries in the early weeks of 1461.<ref>Clark (2016), p. 234</ref>|group=nb}} York was probably short of provisions in the castle and, seeing that the enemy were apparently no stronger than his own army, seized the opportunity to engage them in the open rather than withstand a siege while waiting for reinforcements.<ref name=Warner50>Warner, p. 50</ref>\n\nOther accounts suggested that, possibly in addition to Trollope's deception, York was fooled by some of John Neville of Raby's forces displaying false colours into thinking that reinforcements sent by Warwick had arrived. By another contemporary account, [[William Worcester]]'s ''Annales Rerum Anglicorum'', John Neville himself obtained a Commission of Array from Richard of York to raise 8,000 men to fight on York's side under the Earl of Westmoreland.<ref name=Goodwin145/> Having gathered this force and enticed York to leave the castle to rendezvous with him, John Neville then defected to the Lancastrians.<ref name=Dockray10/>\n\nAnother suggestion was that York and Somerset had agreed a truce during Christmas until 6 January, the [[Epiphany (holiday)|Feast of Epiphany]], but the Lancastrians had no intention of honouring the truce. On three successive days, they sent heralds to provoke York into premature action with insulting messages<ref>Weir (1995), p. 255</ref> and when York moved into the open the Lancastrians treacherously attacked earlier than had been agreed, catching York at a disadvantage while many of his men were absent foraging for supplies.<ref>Ross, Charles. ''Edward IV'', (University of California Press, 1974), p. 30</ref>\n\nThe simplest suggestion was that York acted rashly.<ref name=Rowse143/> For example, historian [[John Sadler (historian)|John Sadler]] states that there was no Lancastrian deception or ambush; York led his men from the castle on a foraging expedition (or by popular belief, to rescue some of his foragers who were under attack)<ref>Clark (2016), p. 230</ref> and as successive Lancastrian contingents joined the battle (the last being Clifford's division, encamped south and east of Sandal Magna), York's army was outnumbered, surrounded and overwhelmed.<ref name=Sadler60>Sadler (2011), p. 60</ref>\n\nThe Yorkists marched out of Sandal Castle down the present-day Manygates Lane towards the Lancastrians located to the north of the castle. It is generally accepted that, as York engaged the Lancastrians to his front, others attacked him from the flank and rear, cutting him off from the castle. In Edward Hall's words:\n\n<blockquote>...&nbsp;but when he was in the plain ground between his castle and the town of Wakefield, he was environed on every side, like a fish in a net, or a deer in a buckstall; so that he manfully fighting was within half an hour slain and dead, and his whole army discomfited.<ref name=Dockray12>{{cite web| url=http://www.richardiii.net/downloads/Ricardian/essay_wakefield.pdf| format=PDF| title=Richard III.net| accessdate=30 June 2009| author=Dockray, Keith| page=12}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Casualties===\nOne near-contemporary source (''Gregory's Chronicle'') claimed that 2,500 Yorkists and 200 Lancastrians were killed, but other sources give wildly differing figures, from 2,200 to only 700 Yorkist dead.\n\nThe Duke of York was either killed in the battle or captured and immediately executed. Some later works support the folklore that he suffered a crippling wound to the knee and was unhorsed, and he and his closest followers then fought to the death at that spot;<ref name=Sadler60/> others relate the account that he was taken prisoner (by one Sir James Luttrell of Devonshire), mocked by his captors and beheaded.<ref>{{cite book| last=Jones| first=Dan| title=The Hollow Crown: The Wars of the Roses and the Rise of the Tudors| publisher=Faber & Faber| year=2014| isbn=9780571288090| page=187}}</ref>\n\nHis son [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]] attempted to escape over Wakefield Bridge, but was overtaken and killed, possibly by Clifford in revenge for his father's death at St Albans. Salisbury's second son [[Thomas Neville (died 1460)|Sir Thomas Neville]] also died in the battle.<ref name=Rowse144/> Salisbury's son in law [[William Bonville, 6th Baron Harington|William, Lord Harington]] and Harington's father, William Bonville, were captured and executed immediately after the battle. (The Bonvilles had been engaged in a [[Bonville\u2013Courtenay feud|feud]] with the Earl of Devon and the Courtenay family in Devon and Cornwall.) Salisbury himself escaped the battlefield but was captured during the night, and was taken to the Lancastrian camp. Although the Lancastrian nobles might have been prepared to allow Salisbury to ransom himself, he was dragged out of Pontefract Castle and beheaded by local commoners, to whom he had been a harsh overlord.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.richardiii.net/downloads/Ricardian/essay_wakefield.pdf| format=PDF| title=Richard III.net| accessdate=30 June 2009| author=Dockray, Keith| page=14}}</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n[[File:Richard of York Memorial Inscription - geograph.org.uk - 858006.jpg|right|thumb|Monument to Richard of York]]\nAfter the battle the heads of York, Rutland and Salisbury were displayed over [[York city walls#Micklegate Bar|Micklegate Bar]], the south-western gate through the [[York city walls]], the Duke wearing a paper crown and a sign saying \"Let York overlook the town of York\".<ref>Weir (2015), p.257</ref>\n\nThe death of Richard of York did not end the wars, or the [[House of York]]'s claim to the throne. The northern Lancastrian army which had been victorious at Wakefield was reinforced by Scots and borderers eager for plunder, and marched south. They defeated Warwick's army at the [[Second Battle of St Albans]] and recaptured the feeble-minded King Henry, who had been abandoned on the battlefield for the third time, but were refused entry to London<ref>Charles Ross, ''Edward IV'', (University of California Press, 1974), 32.</ref> and failed to occupy the city. Warwick and Edward of March reoccupied London, and within a few weeks, Edward of March was proclaimed King Edward IV.\n\nAt the first Battle of St Albans, York had been content with the death of his rivals for power. At Wakefield and in every battle in the Wars of the Roses thereafter, the victors would eliminate not only any opposing leaders but also their family members and supporters, making the struggle more bitter and revenge driven.<ref>{{cite book| last=Hicks| first=Michael| title=The Wars of the Roses| publisher=Yale University Press| year=2012| page=160}}</ref>\n\nA monument erected on the spot where the Duke of York is supposed to have perished is positioned slightly south of the more likely spot where an older monument once stood, but which was destroyed during the [[English Civil War]].

In fact, Rutland, at seventeen, was more than old enough to be an active participant in the fighting. Margaret was almost certainly still in Scotland at the time.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.susanhigginbotham.com/blog/posts/the-death-of-edmund-earl-of-rutland/ | title=The Death of Edmund, Earl of Rutland | date=17 February 2010 | first=Susan | last=Higginbotham | authorlink=Susan Higginbotham | accessdate=28 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe battle is said by some to be the source for the mnemonic for remembering the traditional colours of the [[rainbow]], [[ROYGBIV|Richard of York Gave Battle in Vain]],<ref name=\"Surdhar2013\">{{cite book|last=Surdhar|first=Christina|title=Bloody British History: York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BxATDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT56|accessdate=29 December 2017|date=2 September 2013|publisher=History Press|isbn=9780750951593|page=56}}</ref> and also the mocking [[nursery rhyme]], \"[[The Grand Old Duke of York]]\",<ref>J.

She befriends [[Gail Robinson (Neighbours)|Gail Robinson]] ([[Fiona Corke]]) and invites her to give a talk at the conference when Gail mentions she is married to her boss. Nina is surprised to learn that Gail's husband is Paul Robinson, who she once dated while they worked for the same airline. Gail invites Nina to dinner with her and Paul, but Nina declines the invitation. Paul seeks her out and asks about her life. She explains that she started her own business, fell pregnant with Amy and will be getting married soon. Paul soon works out that Amy is his daughter. Nina tells him that she did not know she was pregnant until after their break up. She also tells him that her fianc\u00e9 Bruce already thinks of Amy as his own and she is leaving that day. Paul asks to be a part of Amy's life, but Nina refuses. Gail tells Nina that Amy might be the only child Paul has. Before she leaves, Nina visits Paul to tells him that she will send him photos of Amy, as well as allowing him to set up a trust fund for Amy's education. Several years later, when Nina and Bruce go through marital problems, Nina sends Amy to live with Paul in Erinsborough for a few months after he visits her in [[New Zealand]].\n\nOver twenty years later, Nina, now calling herself Nene, returns to Erinsborough in the middle of a massive heatwave. She meets her grandson, Jimmy Williams and goes for walk with him, but collapses due to the extreme heat. Karl Kennedy finds Nene and gets her safely to hospital. Amy visits Nene and wants to know what she is doing in town. Nene tells her she has quit her nursing job in Mount Merrion and moved to Erinsborough for a fresh start. Nene develops feelings for Karl, who she assumes is single, but he tells her he is married. Nene is discharged from hospital and stays with Amy and Jimmy at Number 26, along with Amy's boyfriend [[Kyle Canning]] ([[Chris Milligan]]) and his family. Amy asks Karl if there are any nursing jobs available at the hospital and Karl agrees to meet with Nene. Nene discloses that she left her previous job because she had an affair with a doctor who blamed her for a mistake after they split. When the arranged interview falls through, Karl arranges for Nene to be Alzheimer's sufferer Doug Willis' carer.\n\nIn her new position, Nene manipulates situations to spend more time with Karl by lying about Doug's mood swings and calls Karl during a birthday lunch much to the irritation of his wife, [[Susan Kennedy]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]). She also begins confusing Doug by claiming she is his wife [[Pam Willis]] ([[Sue Jones (actress)|Sue Jones]]), uses Karl's laptop to delete an email from a former colleague, and tracks correspondence between Kyle and his former wife, [[Georgia Brooks]] ([[Saskia Hampele]]). However, Doug is able to see through her act and tells the Kennedys, who confront Nene about her erratic behaviour. Nene admits that she has not been taking her anti-depressant medication. Doug agrees not to report Nene, as he knows what it is like to lose control of his own mind. Following this, Nene turns to Paul for support and falls for him again. When she tries to kiss him, Paul rebuffs Nene and lets her down gently. When an explosion occurs at Lassiter's hotel, Nene puts on a nurse's uniform and attempts to treat a comatose [[Jack Callahan (Neighbours)|Jack Callaghan]] ([[Andrew Morley]]), but Doug's granddaughter, [[Paige Smith]] ([[Olympia Valance]]) recognises her and she flees.

She befriends [[Gail Robinson (Neighbours)|Gail Robinson]] ([[Fiona Corke]]) and invites her to give a talk at the conference when Gail mentions she is married to her boss. Nina is surprised to learn that Gail's husband is Paul Robinson, who she once dated while they worked for the same airline. Gail invites Nina to dinner with her and Paul, but Nina declines the invitation. Paul seeks her out and asks about her life. She explains that she started her own business, fell pregnant with Amy and will be getting married soon. Paul soon works out that Amy is his daughter. Nina tells him that she did not know she was pregnant until after their break up. She also tells him that her fianc\u00e9 Bruce already thinks of Amy as his own and she is leaving that day. Paul asks to be a part of Amy's life, but Nina refuses. Gail tells Nina that Amy might be the only child Paul has. Before she leaves, Nina visits Paul to tells him that she will send him photos of Amy, as well as allowing him to set up a trust fund for Amy's education. Several years later, when Nina and Bruce go through marital problems, Nina sends Amy to live with Paul in Erinsborough for a few months after he visits her in [[New Zealand]].\n\nOver twenty years later, Nina, now calling herself Nene, returns to Erinsborough in the middle of a massive heatwave. She meets her grandson, Jimmy Williams and goes for walk with him, but collapses due to the extreme heat. Karl Kennedy finds Nene and gets her safely to hospital. Amy visits Nene and wants to know what she is doing in town. Nene tells her she has quit her nursing job in Mount Merrion and moved to Erinsborough for a fresh start. Nene develops feelings for Karl, who she assumes is single, but he tells her he is married. Nene is discharged from hospital and stays with Amy and Jimmy at Number 26, along with Amy's boyfriend [[Kyle Canning]] ([[Chris Milligan]]) and his family. Amy asks Karl if there are any nursing jobs available at the hospital and Karl agrees to meet with Nene. Nene discloses that she left her previous job because she had an affair with a doctor who blamed her for a mistake after they split. When the arranged interview falls through, Karl arranges for Nene to be Alzheimer's sufferer Doug Willis' carer.\n\nIn her new position, Nene manipulates situations to spend more time with Karl by lying about Doug's mood swings and calls Karl during a birthday lunch much to the irritation of his wife, [[Susan Kennedy]] ([[Jackie Woodburne]]). She also begins confusing Doug by claiming she is his wife [[Pam Willis]] ([[Sue Jones (actress)|Sue Jones]]), uses Karl's laptop to delete an email from a former colleague, and tracks correspondence between Kyle and his former wife, [[Georgia Brooks]] ([[Saskia Hampele]]). However, Doug is able to see through her act and tells the Kennedys, who confront Nene about her erratic behaviour. Nene admits that she has not been taking her anti-depressant medication. Doug agrees not to report Nene, as he knows what it is like to lose control of his own mind. Following this, Nene turns to Paul for support and falls for him again. When she tries to kiss him, Paul rebuffs Nene and lets her down gently. When an explosion occurs at Lassiter's hotel, Nene puts on a nurse's uniform and attempts to treat a comatose [[Jack Callahan (Neighbours)|Jack Callaghan]] ([[Andrew Morley]]), but Doug's granddaughter, [[Paige Smith]] ([[Olympia Valance]]) recognises her and she flees.

The legislature of the colony would authorize a certain force level for the season's campaign and set recruitment quotas for each local militia. In theory, militia members could be drafted by lot if there were inadequate forces for the Provincial Regulars; however, the draft was rarely resorted to because provincial regulars were highly paid (more highly paid than their regular British Army counterparts) and rarely engaged in combat.\n\nIn September 1755, [[George Washington]], then [[adjutant-general]] of the Virginia militia, upon a frustrating and futile attempt to call up the militia to respond to a frontier Indian attack:<ref name = \"sparks70\">Sparks, Jared: ''\"The Life of George Washington\"'', page 70.

The privates were to choose their captains and subalterns, and these officers were to form the companies into battalions, and chose the field-officers to command the same. Hence the minute-men became a body distinct from the rest of the militia, and, by being more devoted to military exercises, they acquired skill in the use of arms. More attention than formerly was likewise bestowed on the training and drilling of militia.<ref name=\"sparks134\"/>''</blockquote>\n\n===American Revolutionary War (1775\u20131783)===\n''See article: [[List of United States militia units in the American Revolutionary War]]''\n\n[[File:Battle of Lexington Detail.jpg|thumb|225px|right|[[Battles of Lexington and Concord|The Battle of Lexington]], April 19th, 1775.

On April 19, 1775, a British force 800 strong marched out of Boston to Concord intending to destroy patriot arms and ammunition. At 5:00 in the morning at Lexington, they met about 70 armed militiamen whom they ordered to disperse, but the militiamen refused. Firing ensued; it is not clear which side opened fire. This became known as \"the shot heard round the world\". Eight militiamen were killed and ten wounded, whereupon the remainder took flight.  The British continued on to Concord and were unable to find most of the arms and ammunition of the patriots. As the British marched back toward Boston, patriot militiamen assembled along the route, taking cover behind stone walls, and sniped at the British. At Meriam's Corner in Concord, the British columns had to close in to cross a narrow bridge, exposing themselves to concentrated, deadly fire. The British retreat became a rout. It was only with the help of an additional detachment of 900 troops that the British force managed to return to Boston.<ref>Shepherd, William (1834). ''A History of the American Revolution'' Page 67.

Andrews, 1853.</ref>\n\nIn 1777, the Second [[Continental Congress]] adopted the [[Articles of Confederation]], which contained a provision for raising a confederal militia that consent would be required from nine of the 13 States.  Article VI of the Articles of Confederation states,\n\n<blockquote> ...&nbsp;every State shall always keep up a well-regulated and disciplined militia, sufficiently armed and accoutered, and shall provide and constantly have ready for use, in public stores, a due number of field pieces and tents, and a proper quantity of arms, ammunition and camp equipage.</blockquote>\n\nSome militia units appeared without adequate arms, as evidenced in this letter from John Adams to his wife, dated August 26, 1777:\n\n<blockquote>The militia are turning out with great alacrity both in Maryland and Pennsylvania. They are distressed for want of arms. Many have none, we shall rake and scrape enough to do [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Howe's]] business, by favor of the Heaven.<ref>Adams, John: ''Letters of John Adams, Addressed to His Wife, page 257. C.C. Little and J. Brown, 1841.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe initial enthusiasm of Patriot militiamen in the beginning days of the war soon waned. The historian Garry Wills explains,\n\n<blockquote>The fervor of the early days in the reorganized militias wore off in the long grind of an eight-year war. Now the right to elect their own officers was used to demand that the men not serve away from their state. Men evaded service, bought substitutes to go for them as in the old days, and had to be bribed with higher and higher bounties to join the effort \u2013 which is why Jefferson and Samuel Adams called them so expensive. As wartime inflation devalued the currency, other pledges had to be offered, including land grants and the promise of \"a healthy slave\" at the end of the war. Some men would take a bounty and not show up. Or they would show up for a while, desert, and then, when they felt the need for another bounty, sign up again in a different place. ... This practice was common enough to have its own technical term \u2013 \"bounty jumping\".<ref>Wills, Garry (1999). ''A Necessary Evil: A History of American Distrust of Government'', Page 35. New York, NY; Simon & Schuster</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe burden of waging war passed to a large extent to the standing army, the [[Continental Army]]. The stay-at-home militia tended then to perform the important role of the internal police to keep order. British forces sought to disrupt American communities by instigating slave rebellions and Indian raids. The militia fended off these threats. Militias also spied on Loyalists in the American communities. In Albany County, New York, the militia established a [[Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War#Counterintelligence|Committee for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies]] to look out for and investigate people with suspicious allegiances.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wills |first=Garry |year=1999 |title=A Necessary Evil: A History of American Distrust of Government |page= 36 |location=New York, NY |publisher= Simon & Schuster }} (rebuttal of [https://www.scribd.com/doc/18942955/Review-of-Gary-Wills-A-Necessary-Evil Wills book \u2013 page 16.])</ref>\n\n===Confederation period (1783\u20131787)===\n\nPolitically, the militia was highly popular during the postwar period, though to some extent, based more on pride of victory in the recent war than on the realities.<ref name=\"spitzer\"/> This skepticism of the actual value of relying upon the militia for national defense, versus a trained regular army was expressed by [[Gouverneur Morris]]:\n\n<blockquote>An overweening vanity leads the fond many, each man against the conviction of his own heart, to believe or affect to believe, that militia can beat veteran troops in the open field and even play of battle. This idle notion, fed by vaunting demagogues, alarmed us for our country, when in the course of that time and chance, which happen to all, she should be at war with a great power.<ref>Sparks, Jared: ''The Life of Gouverneur Morris, with Selections from His Correspondence and Miscellaneous Papers''. Boston, 1832.</ref></blockquote>\n\nRobert Spitzer, citing Daniel Boorstin, describes this political dichotomy of the public popularity of the militia versus the military value:<ref name=\"spitzer\"/>\n\n<blockquote>While the reliance upon militias was politically satisfying, it proved to be an administrative and military nightmare. State detachments could not be easily combined into larger fighting units; soldiers could not be relied on to serve for extended periods, and desertions were common; officers were elected, based on popularity rather than experience or training; discipline and uniformity were almost nonexistent.</blockquote>\n\nGeneral George Washington defended the militia in public, but in correspondence with Congress expressed his opinion of the militia quite to the contrary:\n\n<blockquote>To place any dependence on the Militia, is, assuredly, resting upon a broken staff. Men just dragged from the tender Scenes of domestic life; unaccustomed to the din of Arms; totally unacquainted with every kind of military skill, which being followed by a want of confidence in themselves, when opposed to Troops regularly trained, disciplined, and appointed, superior in knowledge and superior in Arms, makes them timid, and ready to fly from their own shadows ... if I was called upon to declare upon Oath, whether the Militia have been most serviceable or hurtful upon the whole, I should subscribe to the latter.<ref>Weatherup, Roy G.: ''Standing Armies and the Armed Citizens: An Historical Analysis of the Second Amendment''. Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly (Fall 1975), 973</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn [[Shays' Rebellion]], a Massachusetts militia that had been raised as a [[private army]] defeated the main Shays site force on February 3, 1787. There was a lack of an institutional response to the uprising, which energized calls to reevaluate the Articles of Confederation and gave strong impetus to the Constitutional Convention which began in May 1787.\n\nAt the end of the Revolutionary War, a political atmosphere developed at the local level where the militia was seen with fondness, despite their spotty record on the battlefield. Typically, when the militia did act well was when the battle came into the locale of the militia, and local inhabitants tended to exaggerate the performance of the local militia versus the performance of the Continental Army. The Continental Army was seen as the protector of the States, though it also was viewed as a dominating force over the local communities. [[Joseph Reed (jurist)|Joseph Reed]], president of Pennsylvania viewed this jealousy between the militia forces and the standing army as similar to the prior frictions between the militia and the British Regular Army a generation before during the [[French and Indian War]]. Tensions came to a head at the end of the war when the Continental Army officers demanded pensions and set up the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] to honor their own wartime deeds. The local communities did not want to pay national taxes to cover the Army pensions, when the local militiamen received none.<ref>Wills, Garry (1999).

New York, NY; Simon & Schuster</ref>\n\n===Constitution and Bill of Rights (1787\u20131789)===\n\nThe delegates of the Constitutional Convention (the founding fathers/framers of the [[United States Constitution]]) under Article 1; section 8, clauses 15 and 16 of the federal constitution, granted Congress the power to \"provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the Militia\", as well as, and in distinction to, the power to raise an army and a navy. The US Congress is granted the power to use the militia of the United States for three specific missions, as described in Article 1, section 8, clause 15: \"To provide for the calling of the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.\" The [[Militia Act of 1792]]<ref>[[:s:Militia Act of 1792|Militia Act of 1792]]</ref> clarified whom the militia consists of:\n\n{{quote| Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That each and every free able-bodied white male citizen of the respective States, resident therein, who is or shall be of age of eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five years (except as is herein after excepted) shall severally and respectively be enrolled in the militia, by the Captain or Commanding Officer of the company, within whose bounds such citizen shall reside, and that within twelve months after the passing of this Act.}}\n\n====Civilian control of a peacetime army====\n\nAt the time of the drafting of the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, a political sentiment existed in the newly formed United States involving suspicion of peacetime armies not under civilian control. This political belief has been identified as stemming from the memory of the abuses of the standing army of [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[James II of England|King James II]], in Great Britain in the prior century, which led to the [[Glorious Revolution]] and resulted in placing the standing army under the control of Parliament.<ref>[[Garry Wills|Wills, Garry]] (1999).

They can declare who are those religiously scrupulous, and prevent them from bearing arms. What, sir, is the use of a militia? It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty. Now it must be evident, that under this provision, together with their other powers, congress could take such measures with respect to a militia, as make a standing army necessary. Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order to raise an army upon their ruins.}}\n\nThe \"religiously scrupulous\" clause was ultimately stricken from the final draft of second amendment to the Federal Constitution though the militia clause was retained. The Supreme Court of the United States has upheld a right to conscientious objection to military service.<ref>Robert Paul Churchill, \"Conscientious Objection\", in Donald K.

The fears of the more conservative opponents centered upon the possible phasing out of the general militia in favor of a smaller, more readily corrupted, select militia. Proposals for such a select militia already had been advanced by individuals such as [[Baron Von Steuben]], Washington's Inspector General, who proposed supplementing the general militia with a force of 21,000 men given government- issued arms and special training. [120] An article in the Connecticut Journal expressed the fear that the proposed constitution might allow Congress to create such select militias: \"[T]his looks too much like Baron Steuben's militia, by which a standing army was meant and intended.\" [121] In Pennsylvania, John Smiley told the ratifying convention that \"Congress may give us a select militia which will in fact be a standing army\", and worried that, [p.34] with this force in hand, \"the people in general may be disarmed\". [122] Similar concerns were raised by Richard Henry Lee in Virginia. In his widely-read pamphlet, Letters from the Federal Farmer to the Republican, Lee warned that liberties might be undermined by the creation of a select militia that \"[would] answer to all the purposes of an army\", and concluded that \"the Constitution ought to secure a genuine and guard against a select militia by providing that the militia shall always be kept well organized, armed, and disciplined, and include, according to the past and general usage of the states, all men capable of bearing arms.</blockquote>\n\nNote: In Federalist Paper 29 Hamilton argued the inability to train the whole Militia made select corps inevitable and, like Madison, paid it no concern.\n\n===Federalist period (1789\u20131801)===\n\nIn 1794, a militia numbering approximately 13,000 was raised and personally led by President George Washington to quell the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] in Pennsylvania. From this experience, a major weakness of a States-based citizen militia system was found to be the lack of systematic army organization, and a lack of training for engineers and officers. George Washington repeatedly warned of these shortcomings up until his death in 1799. Two days before his death, in a letter to General Alexander Hamilton, George Washington wrote: \"The establishment of a Military Academy upon a respectable and extensive basis has ever been considered by me as an object of primary importance to this country; and while I was in the chair of government, I omitted no proper opportunity of recommending it in my public speeches, and otherwise to the attention of the legislature.\"<ref name=\"cullum\">Cullum, George and Wood, Eleazer:''Campaigns of the War of 1812\u20131815, Against Great Britain: Sketched and Criticized.''.

The groups of [[Company (military unit)|company]] size were usually uniformed and armed through their own contributions.

It has been a source of general corruptions to the community, and formed habits of idleness, dissipation and profligacy ... musterfields have generally been scenes or occasions of gambling, licentiousness, and almost every vice. ...

How it is practicable to keep the people duly armed without some organization, it is difficult to see. There is certainly no small danger, that indifference may lead to disgust, and disgust to contempt; and thus gradually undermine all the protection intended by this clause of our National Bill of Rights.<ref>Story, Joseph.

State militia regiments were of uneven quality, and none had anything resembling combat training. The typical militia drilling at the time amounted to, at best, parade-ground marching. The militia units, from local communities, had never drilled together as a larger regiment, and thus lacked the extremely important skill, critically necessary for the war style of the time, of maneuvering from a marching line into a fighting line.

This can lead to problems for states that also face internal emergencies while the Guard is deployed overseas. To address such issues, many of the states, such as [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Maryland]] also have organized state \"militia\" forces or state guards which are under the control of the governor of a state; however, many of these \"militia\" also act as a reserve for the National Guard and are thus a part of it (this varies from state to state depending on individual state statutory laws). New York and Ohio also have active [[naval militia]]s, and a few other states have on-call or proposed ones. In 1990, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the case of ''Perpich v.

They were created to assist, support and augment National Guard forces during peacetime conditions. Also during the call up of National Guard forces for wartime deployments, state defense forces can be used to assume the full military responsibilities of the state. Their mission includes the defense of the state and the enforcement of military orders when ordered by their Governor.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, state defense forces were used in every major war. New York Guard Soldiers patrolled and secured the water aqueduct of New York, mass transit areas, and were even deployed to France to assist in logistical operations in World War I. The Texas State Guard's soldiers suppressed a riot and maintained peace and order in Texas throughout World War II.\n\nToday state defense forces continue to assist, support and augment the National Guard of the state. They provide logistical, administration, medical, transportation, security, and ceremonial assistance. Some states have provided additional support such as the New York State Defense Force (New York Guard) providing its Soldiers to help support and augment the National Guard CERFP Team{{technical statement|date=November 2015}}. The California State Military Reserve provides the National Guard with Soldiers to assist with military police training and the Alaska State Defense Force constantly provides armed military police troops to assist with the security of Alaska. One of the major roles of the Mississippi State Guard is providing operational support during natural disasters such as hurricanes relief operations.\n\n=== <small>Militias Modeled After State Defense Forces</small> ===\n\nOne militia in the United States has modeled themselves after the state defense forces on a national level. They are known as the United States National Defense Corps.<ref>[http://www.usndcorps.com/index.php UNITED STATES NATIONAL DEFENSE CORPS] The US National Defense Corps is a militia para-military organization and corporation. The mission of the USNDC CORPORATION is to provide emergency support services, in the best interest of the community or upon request, to recognized outside agencies in the event of both manmade and natural disasters and to provide activities to honor and support our veterans and their families.</ref>\n\n=== Reserve militia ===\nAll able bodied men, 17 to 45 of age, are ultimately eligible to be called up into military service and belong to the class known as the reserve militia, also known as the unorganized militia (10 USC). Able bodied men who are not eligible for inclusion in the reserve militia pool are those aliens not having declared their intent to become citizens of the United States (10 USC 246) and former regular component veterans of the armed forces who have reached the age of 64 (32 USC 313). All female citizens who are members of National Guard units are also included in the reserve militia pool ({{USC|10|246}}).\n\nOther persons who are exempt from call to duty ({{USC|10|247}}) and are not therefore in the reserve militia pool include:\n*The Vice President (also constitutionally the President of the Senate, that body which confirms the appointment of senior armed forces officers made by the Commander in Chief).\n*The judicial and executive officers of the United States, the several States and Territories, and Puerto Rico.\n*Members of the armed forces, except members who are not on active duty.\n*Customhouse clerks.\n*Persons employed by the United States in the transmission of mail.\n*Workmen employed in armories, arsenals, and naval shipyards of the United States.\n*Pilots on navigable waters.\n*Mariners in the sea service of a citizen of, or a merchant in, the United States.\n\nMany individual states have additional statutes describing their residents as part of the state militia; for example [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] law specifies all able-bodied citizens or intended citizens over the age of eighteen as members of the state militia, as explicitly distinct from the National Guard and Washington State Guard.<ref>Revised Code of Washington 38.04.030.

The privates were to choose their captains and subalterns, and these officers were to form the companies into battalions, and chose the field-officers to command the same. Hence the minute-men became a body distinct from the rest of the militia, and, by being more devoted to military exercises, they acquired skill in the use of arms.

On April 19, 1775, a British force 800 strong marched out of Boston to Concord intending to destroy patriot arms and ammunition. At 5:00 in the morning at Lexington, they met about 70 armed militiamen whom they ordered to disperse, but the militiamen refused. Firing ensued; it is not clear which side opened fire. This became known as \"the shot heard round the world\". Eight militiamen were killed and ten wounded, whereupon the remainder took flight.  The British continued on to Concord and were unable to find most of the arms and ammunition of the patriots. As the British marched back toward Boston, patriot militiamen assembled along the route, taking cover behind stone walls, and sniped at the British. At Meriam's Corner in Concord, the British columns had to close in to cross a narrow bridge, exposing themselves to concentrated, deadly fire. The British retreat became a rout. It was only with the help of an additional detachment of 900 troops that the British force managed to return to Boston.<ref>Shepherd, William (1834). ''A History of the American Revolution'' Page 67.

F. Andrews, 1853.</ref>\n\nIn 1777, the Second [[Continental Congress]] adopted the [[Articles of Confederation]], which contained a provision for raising a confederal militia that consent would be required from nine of the 13 States.  Article VI of the Articles of Confederation states,\n\n<blockquote> ...&nbsp;every State shall always keep up a well-regulated and disciplined militia, sufficiently armed and accoutered, and shall provide and constantly have ready for use, in public stores, a due number of field pieces and tents, and a proper quantity of arms, ammunition and camp equipage.</blockquote>\n\nSome militia units appeared without adequate arms, as evidenced in this letter from John Adams to his wife, dated August 26, 1777:\n\n<blockquote>The militia are turning out with great alacrity both in Maryland and Pennsylvania. They are distressed for want of arms. Many have none, we shall rake and scrape enough to do [[William Howe, 5th Viscount Howe|Howe's]] business, by favor of the Heaven.<ref>Adams, John: ''Letters of John Adams, Addressed to His Wife, page 257. C.C. Little and J. Brown, 1841.</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe initial enthusiasm of Patriot militiamen in the beginning days of the war soon waned. The historian Garry Wills explains,\n\n<blockquote>The fervor of the early days in the reorganized militias wore off in the long grind of an eight-year war. Now the right to elect their own officers was used to demand that the men not serve away from their state. Men evaded service, bought substitutes to go for them as in the old days, and had to be bribed with higher and higher bounties to join the effort \u2013 which is why Jefferson and Samuel Adams called them so expensive. As wartime inflation devalued the currency, other pledges had to be offered, including land grants and the promise of \"a healthy slave\" at the end of the war. Some men would take a bounty and not show up. Or they would show up for a while, desert, and then, when they felt the need for another bounty, sign up again in a different place. ... This practice was common enough to have its own technical term \u2013 \"bounty jumping\".<ref>Wills, Garry (1999). ''A Necessary Evil: A History of American Distrust of Government'', Page 35.

The stay-at-home militia tended then to perform the important role of the internal police to keep order. British forces sought to disrupt American communities by instigating slave rebellions and Indian raids. The militia fended off these threats. Militias also spied on Loyalists in the American communities. In Albany County, New York, the militia established a [[Intelligence operations in the American Revolutionary War#Counterintelligence|Committee for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies]] to look out for and investigate people with suspicious allegiances.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wills |first=Garry |year=1999 |title=A Necessary Evil: A History of American Distrust of Government |page= 36 |location=New York, NY |publisher= Simon & Schuster }} (rebuttal of [https://www.scribd.com/doc/18942955/Review-of-Gary-Wills-A-Necessary-Evil Wills book \u2013 page 16.])</ref>\n\n===Confederation period (1783\u20131787)===\n\nPolitically, the militia was highly popular during the postwar period, though to some extent, based more on pride of victory in the recent war than on the realities.<ref name=\"spitzer\"/> This skepticism of the actual value of relying upon the militia for national defense, versus a trained regular army was expressed by [[Gouverneur Morris]]:\n\n<blockquote>An overweening vanity leads the fond many, each man against the conviction of his own heart, to believe or affect to believe, that militia can beat veteran troops in the open field and even play of battle. This idle notion, fed by vaunting demagogues, alarmed us for our country, when in the course of that time and chance, which happen to all, she should be at war with a great power.<ref>Sparks, Jared: ''The Life of Gouverneur Morris, with Selections from His Correspondence and Miscellaneous Papers''. Boston, 1832.</ref></blockquote>\n\nRobert Spitzer, citing Daniel Boorstin, describes this political dichotomy of the public popularity of the militia versus the military value:<ref name=\"spitzer\"/>\n\n<blockquote>While the reliance upon militias was politically satisfying, it proved to be an administrative and military nightmare. State detachments could not be easily combined into larger fighting units; soldiers could not be relied on to serve for extended periods, and desertions were common; officers were elected, based on popularity rather than experience or training; discipline and uniformity were almost nonexistent.</blockquote>\n\nGeneral George Washington defended the militia in public, but in correspondence with Congress expressed his opinion of the militia quite to the contrary:\n\n<blockquote>To place any dependence on the Militia, is, assuredly, resting upon a broken staff. Men just dragged from the tender Scenes of domestic life; unaccustomed to the din of Arms; totally unacquainted with every kind of military skill, which being followed by a want of confidence in themselves, when opposed to Troops regularly trained, disciplined, and appointed, superior in knowledge and superior in Arms, makes them timid, and ready to fly from their own shadows ... if I was called upon to declare upon Oath, whether the Militia have been most serviceable or hurtful upon the whole, I should subscribe to the latter.<ref>Weatherup, Roy G.: ''Standing Armies and the Armed Citizens: An Historical Analysis of the Second Amendment''. Hastings Constitutional Law Quarterly (Fall 1975), 973</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn [[Shays' Rebellion]], a Massachusetts militia that had been raised as a [[private army]] defeated the main Shays site force on February 3, 1787. There was a lack of an institutional response to the uprising, which energized calls to reevaluate the Articles of Confederation and gave strong impetus to the Constitutional Convention which began in May 1787.\n\nAt the end of the Revolutionary War, a political atmosphere developed at the local level where the militia was seen with fondness, despite their spotty record on the battlefield. Typically, when the militia did act well was when the battle came into the locale of the militia, and local inhabitants tended to exaggerate the performance of the local militia versus the performance of the Continental Army. The Continental Army was seen as the protector of the States, though it also was viewed as a dominating force over the local communities. [[Joseph Reed (jurist)|Joseph Reed]], president of Pennsylvania viewed this jealousy between the militia forces and the standing army as similar to the prior frictions between the militia and the British Regular Army a generation before during the [[French and Indian War]]. Tensions came to a head at the end of the war when the Continental Army officers demanded pensions and set up the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] to honor their own wartime deeds. The local communities did not want to pay national taxes to cover the Army pensions, when the local militiamen received none.<ref>Wills, Garry (1999).

The US Congress is granted the power to use the militia of the United States for three specific missions, as described in Article 1, section 8, clause 15: \"To provide for the calling of the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.\" The [[Militia Act of 1792]]<ref>[[:s:Militia Act of 1792|Militia Act of 1792]]</ref> clarified whom the militia consists of:\n\n{{quote| Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, That each and every free able-bodied white male citizen of the respective States, resident therein, who is or shall be of age of eighteen years, and under the age of forty-five years (except as is herein after excepted) shall severally and respectively be enrolled in the militia, by the Captain or Commanding Officer of the company, within whose bounds such citizen shall reside, and that within twelve months after the passing of this Act.}}\n\n====Civilian control of a peacetime army====\n\nAt the time of the drafting of the Constitution, and the Bill of Rights, a political sentiment existed in the newly formed United States involving suspicion of peacetime armies not under civilian control. This political belief has been identified as stemming from the memory of the abuses of the standing army of [[Oliver Cromwell]] and [[James II of England|King James II]], in Great Britain in the prior century, which led to the [[Glorious Revolution]] and resulted in placing the standing army under the control of Parliament.<ref>[[Garry Wills|Wills, Garry]] (1999).

They can declare who are those religiously scrupulous, and prevent them from bearing arms. What, sir, is the use of a militia? It is to prevent the establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty. Now it must be evident, that under this provision, together with their other powers, congress could take such measures with respect to a militia, as make a standing army necessary. Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order to raise an army upon their ruins.}}\n\nThe \"religiously scrupulous\" clause was ultimately stricken from the final draft of second amendment to the Federal Constitution though the militia clause was retained. The Supreme Court of the United States has upheld a right to conscientious objection to military service.<ref>Robert Paul Churchill, \"Conscientious Objection\", in Donald K.

The fears of the more conservative opponents centered upon the possible phasing out of the general militia in favor of a smaller, more readily corrupted, select militia. Proposals for such a select militia already had been advanced by individuals such as [[Baron Von Steuben]], Washington's Inspector General, who proposed supplementing the general militia with a force of 21,000 men given government- issued arms and special training. [120] An article in the Connecticut Journal expressed the fear that the proposed constitution might allow Congress to create such select militias: \"[T]his looks too much like Baron Steuben's militia, by which a standing army was meant and intended.\" [121] In Pennsylvania, John Smiley told the ratifying convention that \"Congress may give us a select militia which will in fact be a standing army\", and worried that, [p.34] with this force in hand, \"the people in general may be disarmed\". [122] Similar concerns were raised by Richard Henry Lee in Virginia. In his widely-read pamphlet, Letters from the Federal Farmer to the Republican, Lee warned that liberties might be undermined by the creation of a select militia that \"[would] answer to all the purposes of an army\", and concluded that \"the Constitution ought to secure a genuine and guard against a select militia by providing that the militia shall always be kept well organized, armed, and disciplined, and include, according to the past and general usage of the states, all men capable of bearing arms.</blockquote>\n\nNote: In Federalist Paper 29 Hamilton argued the inability to train the whole Militia made select corps inevitable and, like Madison, paid it no concern.\n\n===Federalist period (1789\u20131801)===\n\nIn 1794, a militia numbering approximately 13,000 was raised and personally led by President George Washington to quell the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] in Pennsylvania. From this experience, a major weakness of a States-based citizen militia system was found to be the lack of systematic army organization, and a lack of training for engineers and officers. George Washington repeatedly warned of these shortcomings up until his death in 1799. Two days before his death, in a letter to General Alexander Hamilton, George Washington wrote: \"The establishment of a Military Academy upon a respectable and extensive basis has ever been considered by me as an object of primary importance to this country; and while I was in the chair of government, I omitted no proper opportunity of recommending it in my public speeches, and otherwise to the attention of the legislature.\"<ref name=\"cullum\">Cullum, George and Wood, Eleazer:''Campaigns of the War of 1812\u20131815, Against Great Britain: Sketched and Criticized.''.

How it is practicable to keep the people duly armed without some organization, it is difficult to see.

State militia regiments were of uneven quality, and none had anything resembling combat training. The typical militia drilling at the time amounted to, at best, parade-ground marching. The militia units, from local communities, had never drilled together as a larger regiment, and thus lacked the extremely important skill, critically necessary for the war style of the time, of maneuvering from a marching line into a fighting line.

This was the case in the race riot of [[Clinton, Mississippi]] in September 1875, and the following month in [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. An eyewitness account:\n\n<blockquote>I found the town in great excitement; un-uniformed militia were parading the streets, both white and colored.

Under federal control, the National Guard of the United States can be called up for active duty by the [[President of the United States]].

This can lead to problems for states that also face internal emergencies while the Guard is deployed overseas. To address such issues, many of the states, such as [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Maryland]] also have organized state \"militia\" forces or state guards which are under the control of the governor of a state; however, many of these \"militia\" also act as a reserve for the National Guard and are thus a part of it (this varies from state to state depending on individual state statutory laws). New York and Ohio also have active [[naval militia]]s, and a few other states have on-call or proposed ones. In 1990, the United States Supreme Court ruled in the case of ''Perpich v. Department of Defense'' that the federal government has plenary power over the National Guard, greatly reducing (to the point of nonexistence) the state government's ability to withhold consent to federal deployments and training missions of the National Guard.<ref>[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=496&invol=334 FindLaw for Legal Professionals \u2013 Case Law, Federal and State Resources, Forms, and Code<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n====State defense forces====\nSince the Militia Act of 1903, many states have created and maintained a reserve military force known as [[state defense force]]s (Some states refer to them as state military reserve, state guard, or foot guard). They were created to assist, support and augment National Guard forces during peacetime conditions. Also during the call up of National Guard forces for wartime deployments, state defense forces can be used to assume the full military responsibilities of the state. Their mission includes the defense of the state and the enforcement of military orders when ordered by their Governor.\n\nThroughout the 20th century, state defense forces were used in every major war. New York Guard Soldiers patrolled and secured the water aqueduct of New York, mass transit areas, and were even deployed to France to assist in logistical operations in World War I. The Texas State Guard's soldiers suppressed a riot and maintained peace and order in Texas throughout World War II.\n\nToday state defense forces continue to assist, support and augment the National Guard of the state. They provide logistical, administration, medical, transportation, security, and ceremonial assistance. Some states have provided additional support such as the New York State Defense Force (New York Guard) providing its Soldiers to help support and augment the National Guard CERFP Team{{technical statement|date=November 2015}}. The California State Military Reserve provides the National Guard with Soldiers to assist with military police training and the Alaska State Defense Force constantly provides armed military police troops to assist with the security of Alaska. One of the major roles of the Mississippi State Guard is providing operational support during natural disasters such as hurricanes relief operations.\n\n=== <small>Militias Modeled After State Defense Forces</small> ===\n\nOne militia in the United States has modeled themselves after the state defense forces on a national level. They are known as the United States National Defense Corps.<ref>[http://www.usndcorps.com/index.php UNITED STATES NATIONAL DEFENSE CORPS] The US National Defense Corps is a militia para-military organization and corporation. The mission of the USNDC CORPORATION is to provide emergency support services, in the best interest of the community or upon request, to recognized outside agencies in the event of both manmade and natural disasters and to provide activities to honor and support our veterans and their families.</ref>\n\n=== Reserve militia ===\nAll able bodied men, 17 to 45 of age, are ultimately eligible to be called up into military service and belong to the class known as the reserve militia, also known as the unorganized militia (10 USC). Able bodied men who are not eligible for inclusion in the reserve militia pool are those aliens not having declared their intent to become citizens of the United States (10 USC 246) and former regular component veterans of the armed forces who have reached the age of 64 (32 USC 313). All female citizens who are members of National Guard units are also included in the reserve militia pool ({{USC|10|246}}).\n\nOther persons who are exempt from call to duty ({{USC|10|247}}) and are not therefore in the reserve militia pool include:\n*The Vice President (also constitutionally the President of the Senate, that body which confirms the appointment of senior armed forces officers made by the Commander in Chief).\n*The judicial and executive officers of the United States, the several States and Territories, and Puerto Rico.\n*Members of the armed forces, except members who are not on active duty.\n*Customhouse clerks.\n*Persons employed by the United States in the transmission of mail.\n*Workmen employed in armories, arsenals, and naval shipyards of the United States.\n*Pilots on navigable waters.\n*Mariners in the sea service of a citizen of, or a merchant in, the United States.\n\nMany individual states have additional statutes describing their residents as part of the state militia; for example [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] law specifies all able-bodied citizens or intended citizens over the age of eighteen as members of the state militia, as explicitly distinct from the National Guard and Washington State Guard.<ref>Revised Code of Washington 38.04.030.

He made his debut as Kane the Undertaker at a taping of ''[[WWF Superstars of Wrestling|Superstars]]'' on November 19, 1990. The original Deadman character depicted him as a [[Western (genre)|Western]] [[Funeral director|mortician]] dressed in a [[trench coat]], gray-striped tie and gray-ringed, black [[stetson hat]] with gray gloves and [[Spats (footwear)|boot spats]]. He was portrayed as impervious to pain, something accomplished by Calaway [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#No-sell|not selling]] his opponents' attacks. Calaway made his official on-camera debut on November 22 at [[Survivor Series (1990)|Survivor Series]] as a villainous character when he was the mystery partner of Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Team.<ref name=pwi89>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\", p. 88\u201389.</ref> Approximately one minute into the match, The Undertaker eliminated [[Koko B.

During the match, Calaway was referred to as The Undertaker, omitting the name 'Kane', which was dropped shortly after the event (and seven years later was given to another wrestler who eventually became Undertaker's [[Kane (wrestler)|younger brother]] of the same name). At the same time, The Undertaker switched [[Manager (professional wrestling)|managers]] from Brother Love to [[Paul Bearer]] \u2013 a [[Histrionic personality disorder|histrionic]], [[ghost]]ly character, almost always seen bearing an [[urn]], which he used to revive The Undertaker's strength whenever Undertaker fell victim to his opponents.

The turn was solidified on the February 29 episode of ''Superstars'', when Roberts confronted The Undertaker on the ''Funeral Parlor'' set over that incident (aired on ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event XXX]]''). After demanding to know whose side The Undertaker was on and getting the reply \"Not yours!\", Roberts attacked both Bearer and The Undertaker, only for Undertaker to stand his ground and run Roberts off. The Undertaker defeated Roberts at [[WrestleMania VIII]].<ref name=legacy /> He then feuded extensively with wrestlers managed by [[Harvey Wippleman]] throughout 1992 and 1993, such as [[Kamala (wrestler)|Kamala]] and [[Jorge Gonz\u00e1lez (wrestler)|Giant Gonz\u00e1lez]].

The Undertaker defeated the impostor after three ''Tombstone Piledrivers''.<ref name=pwi92 /> At [[Survivor Series (1994)|Survivor Series]], The Undertaker defeated Yokozuna in a casket match rematch.

For the next few months, Mankind ambushed and cost The Undertaker several matches.<ref name=pwi95 /> The feud intensified and they began taking their battles into crowds, backstage areas and in the boiler rooms of different arenas. Mankind cost The Undertaker the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Championship]] at [[In Your House 8: Beware of Dog]], assisting champion [[Goldust]] to victory. As a result, the first-ever [[Professional wrestling match types#Location-based variations|Boiler Room Brawl]] was booked between the two at [[SummerSlam (1996)|SummerSlam]].

In this then-new form, he took on a Gothic, brash and [[Rebellion|rebelling]] persona (perhaps to better fit in with the then-budding, more adult-oriented Attitude Era). In this form, he proclaimed himself as \"The Lord of Darkness\".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Following Survivor Series, The Undertaker briefly turned his attention to The Executioner, who had been interfering in his matches since his arrival.

Bearer accused The Undertaker of having burned down the family [[funeral home]] business when he was a child, killing his parents and ostensibly his younger half-brother as well. The Undertaker denied all this; however, Bearer claimed to have proof in the form of The Undertaker's alive and well half-brother Kane, who had survived though scarred and burned. Bearer raised Kane after the fire, having him institutionalized from the date of the fire into adulthood. Ever since the fire, Kane had been awaiting to exact vengeance on his older half-brother. In defense, Undertaker responded that Kane, a pyromaniac, had been the one to set the fire and could not have possibly even survived. Also during the period, Bearer had unintentionally admitted to Undertaker's mother having an affair with him. As a result, it was revealed to The Undertaker that Kane was his half-brother. Until that point, Undertaker spent his life (the entirety of the father's life) under the impression that Kane was fully related to him and his family.

During this match, The Undertaker's storyline half-brother Kane finally made his debut under the control of Paul Bearer, ripping off the door to the cell and giving The Undertaker a ''Tombstone Piledriver'', Undertaker's trademark finisher, allowing Michaels to pin him.<ref name=pwi98 /> As the storyline progressed through Bearer, Kane challenged The Undertaker, but Undertaker consistently refused to fight his half-brother. The Undertaker's final encounter with Michaels was in a casket match at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]]. The week before on ''Raw'', Kane had seemed to ally with his brother against Michaels' [[D-Generation X]]; however, at the event, Kane trapped him in the coffin, padlocking the casket lid and setting it ablaze which again gave Michaels the victory.

During the match, The Undertaker threw Mankind off the roof of the {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} cell onto a broadcast table below, in what was a preplanned move. He later performed a chokeslam on Mankind through the roof of the cell into the ring which legitimately knocked Mankind unconscious.

Shortly before SummerSlam, however, The Undertaker revealed that he and Kane were working together as brothers. Despite this revelation, The Undertaker told Kane that he did not want him to interfere in the match with Austin and even though The Undertaker lost the match, he handed Austin his [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|championship belt]] back after the match in a show of respect.<ref name=pwi100 /> In September, the storyline continued and The Undertaker began to show some villainous characteristics when he and Kane revealed the fact that they were in cahoots to rid Austin of his title for Mr. McMahon. At [[Breakdown: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Kane were booked in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] with Austin for the WWF Championship, in which McMahon stated that the brothers were not allowed to pin each other. The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin simultaneously after a [[Chokeslam#Double chokeslam|double chokeslam]], so the title was vacated by McMahon.<ref name=pwi100 /> This event led to a match at [[Judgment Day: In Your House]] between The Undertaker and Kane for the title, with Austin as the special guest referee. Near the end of the match, Paul Bearer seemed about to assist Kane by handing him a steel chair to hit The Undertaker with, but as Kane had his back turned, both Bearer and The Undertaker hit Kane with the chair. The Undertaker went for the pin, but Austin refused to count the fall, attacked The Undertaker and counted out both of them.<ref name=pwi100 /> Finally, The Undertaker became a villain the next night on ''Raw'' for the first time in over six years, reconciling with Bearer and claiming that he and Bearer would unleash their \"[[The Ministry of Darkness|Ministry of Darkness]]\" on the World Wrestling Federation. As part of this new storyline, he admitted that he had indeed set the fire that killed his parents, for which he had previously blamed Kane.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Ministry of Darkness (1998\u20131999) ====\n{{Main|Ministry of Darkness}}\nAfter [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], The Undertaker returned his attention to his previous feud with Austin for costing him the title at Judgment Day, hitting Austin in the head with a shovel during a title match with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], returning the favor for what happened a month earlier. With this twist in the storyline, Mr. McMahon scheduled a Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Austin at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]. In the weeks leading up to Rock Bottom, The Undertaker attempted to embalm Austin alive, tried to have Kane committed to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] and had his druids chain Austin to his symbol, raising it high into the arena.{{cn|date=December 2019}} However, The Undertaker lost the match after Kane interfered.<ref name=pwi102>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\" (p. 102).</ref>\n\nAfter building up to his second villainous run in the latter part of 1998, The Undertaker introduced an updated version of his Deadman identity by January 1999 \u2013 the dark priest who in the initial period of this persona reigned over a stable known as The Ministry of Darkness. In this form, he took on a wicked, demonic presence, much more so than ever before. He often claimed to be invoking and taking orders from a \"Higher Power\". Moreover, he often appeared in a hooded black robe and sat on a throne that was specially designed into his character symbol. With the help of his minions, he often performed sacrifices on select WWF wrestlers, using various [[incantation]]s and [[magic word]]s with intent to extract out the dark side of the wrestlers in question to recruit them into his Ministry. The completed Ministry of Darkness consisted of [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] ([[Christian Cage|Christian]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]]), [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]] (Bradshaw and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]), [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]] and [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]]. Calaway himself did not wrestle for a period having undergone a hip replacement. As part of the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]], Undertaker expressed a desire to take control of the World Wrestling Federation, displacing its owner, Mr. McMahon. These ambitions culminated into a rivalry between The Ministry and [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], ultimately resulting in a match between Undertaker and Corporation enforcer, [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]].

After their victory at [[SummerSlam (1999)|SummerSlam]], The Undertaker suffered a groin tear and was seen [[limp]]ing in several matches. He avoided competing in wrestling matches in the following weeks, instead tyrannically ordering Big Show to fight all his battles and oblige all his many wishes. He also began to transition away to the biker character he would play in 2000. Per an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to enter World Championship Wrestling with a non-trademarked persona. Had he entered WCW, it would have been as Mark Calaway.

After signing for [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in 1989, he enjoyed a brief stint as a mid-card performer named \"Mean Mark\" Callous, before joining the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE) in 1990.\n\nIn the WWF, Calaway was rebranded as \"The Undertaker\" and gained significant mainstream popularity as a [[Horror film|horror]]-themed, [[macabre]] entity who employed [[Fear mongering|scare tactics]] and held links to the [[supernatural]]. The Undertaker became one of the most prominent figures of the [[Attitude Era]], featuring in various pivotal storylines and matches as WWF sustained a boom period in business in the late 1990s. His character transitioned into a biker in the early 2000s, before returning to a refined version of his previous gimmick in 2004. The Undertaker is known for [[The Streak (wrestling)|The Streak]], a series of 21 straight victories at WWE's flagship annual event, [[WrestleMania]].\n\nCalaway has held 17 [[Professional wrestling championship|championships]].

He was portrayed as impervious to pain, something accomplished by Calaway [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#No-sell|not selling]] his opponents' attacks. Calaway made his official on-camera debut on November 22 at [[Survivor Series (1990)|Survivor Series]] as a villainous character when he was the mystery partner of Ted DiBiase's Million Dollar Team.<ref name=pwi89>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\", p. 88\u201389.</ref> Approximately one minute into the match, The Undertaker eliminated [[Koko B.

He also eliminated [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] before being [[Professional wrestling#Countout|counted out]]; however, his team won the match with DiBiase being the sole survivor. During the match, Calaway was referred to as The Undertaker, omitting the name 'Kane', which was dropped shortly after the event (and seven years later was given to another wrestler who eventually became Undertaker's [[Kane (wrestler)|younger brother]] of the same name).

In this form, he proclaimed himself as \"The Lord of Darkness\".{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Following Survivor Series, The Undertaker briefly turned his attention to The Executioner, who had been interfering in his matches since his arrival.

Bearer accused The Undertaker of having burned down the family [[funeral home]] business when he was a child, killing his parents and ostensibly his younger half-brother as well. The Undertaker denied all this; however, Bearer claimed to have proof in the form of The Undertaker's alive and well half-brother Kane, who had survived though scarred and burned. Bearer raised Kane after the fire, having him institutionalized from the date of the fire into adulthood. Ever since the fire, Kane had been awaiting to exact vengeance on his older half-brother. In defense, Undertaker responded that Kane, a pyromaniac, had been the one to set the fire and could not have possibly even survived. Also during the period, Bearer had unintentionally admitted to Undertaker's mother having an affair with him. As a result, it was revealed to The Undertaker that Kane was his half-brother. Until that point, Undertaker spent his life (the entirety of the father's life) under the impression that Kane was fully related to him and his family.

The Undertaker's final encounter with Michaels was in a casket match at the [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]]. The week before on ''Raw'', Kane had seemed to ally with his brother against Michaels' [[D-Generation X]]; however, at the event, Kane trapped him in the coffin, padlocking the casket lid and setting it ablaze which again gave Michaels the victory.

During the match, The Undertaker threw Mankind off the roof of the {{convert|16|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=flip}} cell onto a broadcast table below, in what was a preplanned move. He later performed a chokeslam on Mankind through the roof of the cell into the ring which legitimately knocked Mankind unconscious. Mankind also used thumbtacks in the match and was hit by a [[Professional wrestling throws#Back body drop|back body drop]] and another chokeslam onto them before Undertaker won the match with the ''Tombstone Piledriver''.<ref name=pwi100 /> At [[Fully Loaded: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin defeated Kane and Mankind to win the WWF World Tag Team Championship.<ref name=pwi100 /> The Undertaker and Austin's reign as [[World tag team championship|tag team champions]] lasted for only two weeks, as Kane and Mankind regained the titles on the August 10 episode of ''Raw''.{{cn|date=December 2019}} The Undertaker then became the number one contender for the renamed WWF Championship at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]], now held by Austin. Shortly before SummerSlam, however, The Undertaker revealed that he and Kane were working together as brothers. Despite this revelation, The Undertaker told Kane that he did not want him to interfere in the match with Austin and even though The Undertaker lost the match, he handed Austin his [[Championship belt#Professional wrestling|championship belt]] back after the match in a show of respect.<ref name=pwi100 /> In September, the storyline continued and The Undertaker began to show some villainous characteristics when he and Kane revealed the fact that they were in cahoots to rid Austin of his title for Mr. McMahon. At [[Breakdown: In Your House]], The Undertaker and Kane were booked in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Basic non-elimination matches|triple threat match]] with Austin for the WWF Championship, in which McMahon stated that the brothers were not allowed to pin each other. The Undertaker and Kane pinned Austin simultaneously after a [[Chokeslam#Double chokeslam|double chokeslam]], so the title was vacated by McMahon.<ref name=pwi100 /> This event led to a match at [[Judgment Day: In Your House]] between The Undertaker and Kane for the title, with Austin as the special guest referee. Near the end of the match, Paul Bearer seemed about to assist Kane by handing him a steel chair to hit The Undertaker with, but as Kane had his back turned, both Bearer and The Undertaker hit Kane with the chair. The Undertaker went for the pin, but Austin refused to count the fall, attacked The Undertaker and counted out both of them.<ref name=pwi100 /> Finally, The Undertaker became a villain the next night on ''Raw'' for the first time in over six years, reconciling with Bearer and claiming that he and Bearer would unleash their \"[[The Ministry of Darkness|Ministry of Darkness]]\" on the World Wrestling Federation. As part of this new storyline, he admitted that he had indeed set the fire that killed his parents, for which he had previously blamed Kane.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\n==== Ministry of Darkness (1998\u20131999) ====\n{{Main|Ministry of Darkness}}\nAfter [[Survivor Series (1998)|Survivor Series]], The Undertaker returned his attention to his previous feud with Austin for costing him the title at Judgment Day, hitting Austin in the head with a shovel during a title match with [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]], returning the favor for what happened a month earlier. With this twist in the storyline, Mr. McMahon scheduled a Buried Alive match between The Undertaker and Austin at [[Rock Bottom: In Your House]]. In the weeks leading up to Rock Bottom, The Undertaker attempted to embalm Austin alive, tried to have Kane committed to a [[Psychiatric hospital|mental asylum]] and had his druids chain Austin to his symbol, raising it high into the arena.{{cn|date=December 2019}} However, The Undertaker lost the match after Kane interfered.<ref name=pwi102>2007 Wrestling almanac & book of facts. \"Wrestling's historical cards\" (p. 102).</ref>\n\nAfter building up to his second villainous run in the latter part of 1998, The Undertaker introduced an updated version of his Deadman identity by January 1999 \u2013 the dark priest who in the initial period of this persona reigned over a stable known as The Ministry of Darkness. In this form, he took on a wicked, demonic presence, much more so than ever before. He often claimed to be invoking and taking orders from a \"Higher Power\". Moreover, he often appeared in a hooded black robe and sat on a throne that was specially designed into his character symbol. With the help of his minions, he often performed sacrifices on select WWF wrestlers, using various [[incantation]]s and [[magic word]]s with intent to extract out the dark side of the wrestlers in question to recruit them into his Ministry. The completed Ministry of Darkness consisted of [[The Brood (professional wrestling)|The Brood]] ([[Christian Cage|Christian]], [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] and [[Gangrel (wrestler)|Gangrel]]), [[Acolytes Protection Agency|The Acolytes]] (Bradshaw and [[Ron Simmons|Faarooq]]), [[Dennis Knight|Mideon]] and [[Viscera (wrestler)|Viscera]]. Calaway himself did not wrestle for a period having undergone a hip replacement. As part of the [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Angle|angle]], Undertaker expressed a desire to take control of the World Wrestling Federation, displacing its owner, Mr. McMahon. These ambitions culminated into a rivalry between The Ministry and [[The Corporation (professional wrestling)|The Corporation]], ultimately resulting in a match between Undertaker and Corporation enforcer, [[Big Boss Man (wrestler)|Big Boss Man]].

He avoided competing in wrestling matches in the following weeks, instead tyrannically ordering Big Show to fight all his battles and oblige all his many wishes. He also began to transition away to the biker character he would play in 2000. Per an interview with Kevin Nash, this was a move to allow Calaway to enter World Championship Wrestling with a non-trademarked persona. Had he entered WCW, it would have been as Mark Calaway.
