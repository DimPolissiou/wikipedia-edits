Stacey struggled to cope with her mother's suicidal and erratic behaviour, resulting from her illness. For a long time, she was Jean's sole carer as her older brother, [[Sean Slater|Sean]] ([[Robert Kazinsky]]), had disappeared, unable to cope with Jean's condition.\n\nStacey, age 15,<ref>{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/eastenders/monday-8th-november-372450/ |title=EastEnders \u2013 Season 19, Episode 175: Monday 8th November |publisher=TV.com |date=8 November 2004 |accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a16497/stacey-celebrates-her-birthday.html |title=Stacey celebrates her birthday |publisher=Digital Spy |date= 22 October 2004|accessdate=6 April 2014}}</ref> arrives in [[Walford]] in November  2004, to live with her great-uncle [[Charlie Slater|Charlie]] ([[Derek Martin]]) and adoptive grandmother [[Mo Harris|Mo]] ([[Laila Morse]]) after being thrown out by her mother, Jean. She causes trouble through her promiscuous and immoral behaviour, and is sent back home to Jean. However, she then returns to the Slaters, eventually beginning to settle down when joined by her mother and older brother, Sean. It is revealed that Stacey had a troubled childhood, due to Jean's [[bipolar disorder]] and the death of her father when she was 11, after which Sean abandoned the family and left Stacey as Jean's sole carer. In 2005, Stacey befriends [[Ruby Allen]] ([[Louisa Lytton]]) and they later become best friends, despite falling out a few times. Their friendship ends completely in 2006, when Ruby encourages Sean to move away from his family and Walford for good, upsetting Stacey and Jean. Stacey also becomes heavily involved in the murder of [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) when she gives her cousin [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]) a false alibi for his murder, landing an innocent [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Kim Medcalf]]) in prison. Sam's family and Den's adoptive daughter [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) pressure her into telling the truth, and eventually Den's wife [[Chrissie Watts]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman]]) is arrested for the murder.\n\nDespite being unimpressed by Walford newcomer [[Bradley Branning]] ([[Charlie Clements]]), the pair grow to love one another but the relationship deteriorates when Stacey discovers she has been impregnated by Bradley. When he uncovers the truth, Bradley constantly urges Stacey to have an abortion. After hours of pleading with Bradley, she finally gives up and after doing so, their romance sours. Bradley calls time on his relationship with Stacey when she embarrasses him at a work party. She confides in his father [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) and they end up having sex. Subsequently, they begin an affair and Max agrees to divorce his wife, [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]). However, he has this on a halt as he learns that Tanya is pregnant with their son. He leaves Stacey and she reunites with Bradley, later marrying. Max propositions Stacey after the wedding ceremony and their brief kiss is recorded on Max's eldest daughter [[Lauren Branning|Lauren]]'s ([[Madeline Duggan]]) hidden video camera. Lauren gives a DVD of the recording to Bradley as a Christmas present, revealing the fling as he plays it to the family. Devastated, Tanya slaps Stacey and Bradley ends their marriage again for six months. He eventually decides to give their marriage another chance, suggesting that they start a family. Stacey is uncertain and secretly continues having birth control pills. She seduces [[Callum Monks]] ([[Elliott Jordan]]). She immediately regrets cheating on Bradley. Although she attempts to reignite the spark in her marriage, Stacey divorces Bradley. She has a [[one-night stand]] with Callum, which leads to them dating. They split, however, over his harsh treatment of her mother.\n\nFollowing the death of her friend [[Danielle Jones (EastEnders)|Danielle Jones]] ([[Lauren Crace]]), Stacey begins behaving erratically. She steals money from her family, sleeps with various men on the go and becomes a heavy drinker. She is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but is non-compliant with her medication and becomes paranoid, experiencing hallucinations. Stacey starts sleeping with [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]) and is raped by [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb]]). She believes that they are both planning to kill her. After attacking Archie with a broken glass and accusing her friends and family of planning to hurt her, Stacey is [[Involuntary commitment|involuntarily committed]] to hospital, where she befriends [[Becca Swanson (EastEnders)|Becca Swanson]] ([[Simone James]]).\n\nUpon her release, Bradley confesses his feelings for Stacey and they reconcile. Then Stacey discovers she is 3 months pregnant, so Bradley could not be the father. She tells Bradley that Archie raped her and must be the father. Archie is murdered that night by an unknown assailant. Stacey and Bradley agree to pretend the baby is theirs, and remarry on 18 February 2010. A jealous Becca reveals the rape to Archie's eldest daughter [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]), who tells Stacey that Archie was infertile following cancer treatment. Becca informs the police that Bradley had a motive to kill Archie. He and Stacey attempt to flee Walford, but Bradley is caught by the police and falls to his death while trying to escape. A distraught Stacey confesses to Max that she killed Archie while her world falls apart.\n\nStacey decides not to tell Ryan that he must be the father of her baby. He exhibits a romantic interest in her, which is later revealed to be part of a bet with his girlfriend [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]). Upset by this revelation, Stacey's waters break. Ryan stays with her as she gives birth to a daughter, whom she names [[Lily Branning|Lily]]. When Ryan later rescues them from a fire at [[The Queen Victoria]] pub, Stacey admits that he is Lily's father. Ryan initially refuses to act as a parent to her, but bonds with her when Stacey and a jealous Janine are arrested for fighting during a night out. Janine's jealousy escalates to kidnapping Lily, but Ryan convinces her to return her. Stacey and Ryan grow closer, spending time together, and they passionately kiss. During this time, Lauren (now [[Jacqueline Jossa]]) discovers Stacey's guilt in Archie's murder and records a confession on her phone. Stacey attempts to flee to [[Palma de Mallorca|Palma, Majorca]], but Ryan stops her, telling her he has feelings for her and wants to date her. They start an affair, but, unbeknownst to them, Janine finds out and poisons Ryan in revenge. Ryan is hospitalised and on his return, he convinces Janine he loves her but publicly declares his love for Stacey in The Queen Vic. Janine walks in as they are in a passionate embrace. She concedes defeat until Lauren, who still believes Max is emotionally involved with Stacey, gives Janine the recorded confession. The next day, Janine attempts to play the recording in front of customers in The Queen Vic, but it has been recorded over because Lauren warned Max. Janine says that Stacey killed Archie but no one believes her. Stacey leaves the pub in tears, followed by Ryan. She then breaks down and tells Ryan that Janine said the truth.\n\nThe next day, Christmas Day, Stacey tells Jean she killed Archie, so Jean takes Lily away from her. Ryan convinces Stacey to leave with him as Janine will call the police. Stacey lets Janine in and she attempts to set Stacey up by grabbing a knife, placing it into Stacey's hand and stabbing herself. Stacey runs out of the house and Janine convinces Jean to call the police. Stacey contemplates suicide but Max stops her and says he will help her to escape. Stacey convinces Jean that Janine has framed her. Ryan plans to run away with Stacey, but Stacey states that events have happened rapidly, and she is not sure whether she loves him. Stacey ends their romance. Ronnie and Roxy confront her, and Stacey confesses that she did kill Archie. Ronnie tells her to go, and Max drives her to the airport as the police arrive on the Square. At the airport, Max says he loves her and offers to leave with her, but she tells him she only ever loved Bradley. She and Lily then board a flight and leave the country. The next day, [[Kat Slater|Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) receives a phone call from Stacey, saying that her and Lily are safe and well in [[Mexico]].\n\n===2014\u2013===\nKat sees Stacey walking into a salon, from the top deck of a bus in [[London]]. Kat finds out where she lives and visits, where she meets Lily (Aine Garvey) and Stacey's boyfriend, [[Luke Riley]] ([[Matt Willis]]). Luke believes that Stacey's name is \"Jenny Smith\" and is unaware of her criminal history. Stacey sees Kat leaving and confronts her in Albert Square. Kat later tells Luke \"Jenny\" is really Stacey so he ends the relationship. Stacey and Lily spend the night at Kat and Alfie's house and the following day, Kat visits Janine in prison to ask her to withdraw the statement she made accusing Stacey of stabbing her. Janine agrees so Stacey returns to Albert Square. Luke visits Stacey, but leaves, after discovering that she killed Archie. After listening to what Luke said, Stacey decides to clear Bradley's name and calls the police, telling them that she killed Archie. She is arrested and later sentenced to five years in prison. After realising how much Lily is missing her, she decides to appeal her sentence on grounds of diminished responsibility because of her bipolar disorder and is successful. Stacey returns to Walford, moving in with Kat and Alfie. Alfie commits arson, destroying the home and everything that belonged to Bradley. Stacey works for [[Dean Wicks]] ([[Matt Di Angelo]]) at his salon, Blades, and they start dating. She and Lily move into Dean's flat and Stacey discovers that Alfie caused the fire. Stacey discovers that Dean raped [[Linda Carter]] ([[Kellie Bright]]), so ends the relationship and forces him to move out.\n\nStacey talks to Sean over video chat, and he tells her to look after a key. Stacey is worried about Kat and Alfie leaving, following their lottery win. She is roughed up by Dean, who asks her about his daughter with [[Shabnam Masood]] ([[Rakhee Thakrar]]). Shabnam's on-off boyfriend [[Kush Kazemi]] ([[Davood Ghadami]]) rescues her; they kiss and she tells him that Shabnam had a daughter she abandoned. Kush's friend, [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin Fowler]] ([[James Bye (actor)|James Bye]]) becomes her flatmate. Martin and Stacey date briefly before she realises she has feelings for Kush, despite his engagement to Shabnam. They kiss for a second time but they regret it. Stacey is jealous when Shabnam reveals she is pregnant, and Stacey reconciles with Martin. Jean returns and reveals that she is marrying [[Ollie Walters]] ([[Tony O'Callaghan]]) the next day. Jean sees the key and becomes angry, so Stacey is curious and tries to find what the key is for, to no avail; Jean pretends to flush the key down the toilet. Stacey discovers she is pregnant, but Martin asks her to get a termination, claiming that it is too soon in their relationship. She decides to keep the baby after a talk with Shabnam. Martin decides to stand by her.\n\nStacey is spooked when a man she does not know begins to follow her. Unbeknownst to Stacey, the man, [[Kyle Slater|Kyle]] ([[Riley Carter Millington]]), also has a key like hers. When Stacey finds out Martin is planning to propose, she says she does not want to marry again. He later proposes that she become his \"not-wife\", so they are committed but not married, and she agrees. When [[Lee Carter (EastEnders)|Lee Carter]] ([[Danny-Boy Hatchard]]) fails to correctly fix a faulty electric socket, Stacey is electrocuted. She and her baby are fine, and she finds out she is having a boy. She forgives Lee, and tells Shabnam that she saw her dead father Brian when she was electrocuted. When Shabnam finds the baby scan Stacey is hiding, Stacey throws her out of the flat and tears up the scan photo. When Shabnam asks why Stacey is hiding the photo from Martin, Stacey admits he is not the father but the real father was a one-night stand before getting together with him. When Kush confronts her, she tells him that she thinks he could be the father. Kush's mother [[Carmel Kazemi]] ([[Bonnie Langford]]) notices Kush and Stacey talking, and realises that he could be the father of Stacey's baby. Kush and Stacey convince Carmel not to tell Shabnam or Martin. When Stacey later attends a church service and prays for her father, she sees Kyle, who then leaves suddenly without telling her who he is, causing her to become more suspicious.\n\nStacey tells Martin she has a stalker, and when Jean and Ollie visit, she tells them too. Stacey realises that Jean knows who it is, and when she asks, Jean produces the key. Jean reveals the key is for Brian's safety deposit box in a bank. Stacey opens the box but it is empty, so when she confronts Jean, Jean reveals that Brian had another family with another woman, saying they planned to give Stacey the key when she turned 21 but after Brian's death, Sean stole it. Jean reveals that Kyle has been trying to contact her and Stacey through letters, making Stacey realise that Kyle is her half-brother. Kush tells Stacey that they must tell the truth to Shabnam and Martin about the paternity of Stacey's baby. Stacey gives birth at Lily's nativity play and Martin names the baby [[Arthur Fowler (2015 character)|Arthur Fowler]], after his father.

Santer promised \"fascinating\" stories for Stacey and Max, saying that the two-hander will explore Stacey's motives for killing Archie, and will be a test for Max as the murder led to his son's death. Santer explained that the murder was not a function of Stacey's bipolar disorder as she was lucid at the time, and she had several sound reasons to be angry with him \u2013 he took advantage of her, ruined her second chance with Bradley, caused a chain of events leading to the death of Stacey's best friend Danielle and drove her brother Sean out of Walford.

Lacey's one of the BBC soap's finest actresses and to be handed a story with scenes as powerful as those in last Tuesday's episode must be nothing short of a privilege. The subject matter, however, may be difficult and the portrayal of the condition quite probably more so.

She causes trouble through her promiscuous and immoral behaviour, and is sent back home to Jean. However, she then returns to the Slaters, eventually beginning to settle down when joined by her mother and older brother, Sean. It is revealed that Stacey had a troubled childhood, due to Jean's [[bipolar disorder]] and the death of her father when she was 11, after which Sean abandoned the family and left Stacey as Jean's sole carer. In 2005, Stacey befriends [[Ruby Allen]] ([[Louisa Lytton]]) and they later become best friends, despite falling out a few times. Their friendship ends completely in 2006, when Ruby encourages Sean to move away from his family and Walford for good, upsetting Stacey and Jean. Stacey also becomes heavily involved in the murder of [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]) when she gives her cousin [[Zoe Slater]] ([[Michelle Ryan]]) a false alibi for his murder, landing an innocent [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Kim Medcalf]]) in prison. Sam's family and Den's adoptive daughter [[Sharon Watts]] ([[Letitia Dean]]) pressure her into telling the truth, and eventually Den's wife [[Chrissie Watts]] ([[Tracy Ann Oberman]]) is arrested for the murder.\n\nDespite being unimpressed by Walford newcomer [[Bradley Branning]] ([[Charlie Clements]]), the pair grow to love one another but the relationship deteriorates when Stacey discovers she has been impregnated by Bradley. When he uncovers the truth, Bradley constantly urges Stacey to have an abortion. After hours of pleading with Bradley, she finally gives up and after doing so, their romance sours. Bradley calls time on his relationship with Stacey when she embarrasses him at a work party. She confides in his father [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) and they end up having sex. Subsequently, they begin an affair and Max agrees to divorce his wife, [[Tanya Branning]] ([[Jo Joyner]]). However, he has this on a halt as he learns that Tanya is pregnant with their son. He leaves Stacey and she reunites with Bradley, later marrying. Max propositions Stacey after the wedding ceremony and their brief kiss is recorded on Max's eldest daughter [[Lauren Branning|Lauren]]'s ([[Madeline Duggan]]) hidden video camera. Lauren gives a DVD of the recording to Bradley as a Christmas present, revealing the fling as he plays it to the family. Devastated, Tanya slaps Stacey and Bradley ends their marriage again for six months. He eventually decides to give their marriage another chance, suggesting that they start a family. Stacey is uncertain and secretly continues having birth control pills. She seduces [[Callum Monks]] ([[Elliott Jordan]]). She immediately regrets cheating on Bradley. Although she attempts to reignite the spark in her marriage, Stacey divorces Bradley. She has a [[one-night stand]] with Callum, which leads to them dating. They split, however, over his harsh treatment of her mother.\n\nFollowing the death of her friend [[Danielle Jones (EastEnders)|Danielle Jones]] ([[Lauren Crace]]), Stacey begins behaving erratically. She steals money from her family, sleeps with various men on the go and becomes a heavy drinker. She is diagnosed with bipolar disorder, but is non-compliant with her medication and becomes paranoid, experiencing hallucinations. Stacey starts sleeping with [[Ryan Malloy]] ([[Neil McDermott]]) and is raped by [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb]]). She believes that they are both planning to kill her. After attacking Archie with a broken glass and accusing her friends and family of planning to hurt her, Stacey is [[Involuntary commitment|involuntarily committed]] to hospital, where she befriends [[Becca Swanson (EastEnders)|Becca Swanson]] ([[Simone James]]).\n\nUpon her release, Bradley confesses his feelings for Stacey and they reconcile. Then Stacey discovers she is 3 months pregnant, so Bradley could not be the father. She tells Bradley that Archie raped her and must be the father. Archie is murdered that night by an unknown assailant. Stacey and Bradley agree to pretend the baby is theirs, and remarry on 18 February 2010. A jealous Becca reveals the rape to Archie's eldest daughter [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]), who tells Stacey that Archie was infertile following cancer treatment. Becca informs the police that Bradley had a motive to kill Archie. He and Stacey attempt to flee Walford, but Bradley is caught by the police and falls to his death while trying to escape. A distraught Stacey confesses to Max that she killed Archie while her world falls apart.\n\nStacey decides not to tell Ryan that he must be the father of her baby. He exhibits a romantic interest in her, which is later revealed to be part of a bet with his girlfriend [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]). Upset by this revelation, Stacey's waters break. Ryan stays with her as she gives birth to a daughter, whom she names [[Lily Branning|Lily]]. When Ryan later rescues them from a fire at [[The Queen Victoria]] pub, Stacey admits that he is Lily's father.

Following this, a [[list of EastEnders two-hander episodes|two-hander episode]] was announced for Stacey and Max, who became the only person to know Stacey was the killer. Santer promised \"fascinating\" stories for Stacey and Max, saying that the two-hander will explore Stacey's motives for killing Archie, and will be a test for Max as the murder led to his son's death. Santer explained that the murder was not a function of Stacey's bipolar disorder as she was lucid at the time, and she had several sound reasons to be angry with him \u2013 he took advantage of her, ruined her second chance with Bradley, caused a chain of events leading to the death of Stacey's best friend Danielle and drove her brother Sean out of Walford.

During the 1940s and 1950s, Graziani was the most photographed woman in France and the undisputed queen of couture, while Fonssagrives appeared on over 200 ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' covers; her name recognition led to the importance of ''Vogue'' in shaping the careers of fashion models.

Throughout Europe, secretarial services acted as models' agents charging them weekly rates for their messages and bookings. For the most part, models were responsible for their own billing. In Germany, agents were not allowed to work for a percentage of a person's earnings, so referred to themselves as secretaries. With the exception of a few models travelling to Paris or New York, travelling was relatively unheard of for a model. Most models only worked in one market due to different labor laws governing modelling in various countries. In the 1960s, Italy had many fashion houses and [[fashion magazines]] but was in dire need of models. Italian agencies would often coerce models to return to Italy without work visas by withholding their pay.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708041838/http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|url=http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|archive-date=8 July 2008|date=January 2007|title=A Brief History Of Modelling|author=Peter Marlowe|website=The Peter Marlowe Model Composite Archives}}</ref> They would also pay their models in cash, which models would have to hide from [[customs]] agents. It was not uncommon for models staying in hotels such as La Louisiana in [[Paris]] or the Arena in [[Milan]] to have their hotel rooms raided by the police looking for their work visas. It was rumoured that competing agencies were behind the raids. This led many agencies to form worldwide chains; for example, the [[Marilyn Agency]] has branches in Paris and New York.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBy the late 1960s, [[London]] was considered the best market in Europe due to its more organised and innovative approach to modelling. It was during this period that models began to become household names. Models such as [[Jean Shrimpton]], [[Tania Mallet]], [[Celia Hammond]], [[Twiggy]], [[Penelope Tree]], and dominated the London fashion scene and were well paid, unlike their predecessors.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |title=David Bailey's favourite model Jean Shrimpton was the Shrimp who sparked the Sixties \u2013 Telegraph |publisher=Fashion.telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=2012-09-19 |location=London |first=Lisa |last=Armstrong |date=2012-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827035540/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |archive-date=2012-08-27 |url-status=live }}</ref> Twiggy became The Face of '66 at the age of 16.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030211153058/http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-02-11 |title=Twiggy \u2013 The Official Site |publisher=Twiggylawson.co.uk |date=1966-02-23 |accessdate=2012-09-19 }}</ref> At this time, model agencies were not as restrictive about the models they represented, although it was uncommon for them to sign shorter models. Twiggy, who stood at {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm}} with a 32\" bust and had a boy's haircut, is credited with changing model ideals. At that time, she earned \u00a380 an hour, while the average wage was \u00a315 a week.[[File:Jean Shrimpton (1965).jpg|thumb|[[Jean Shrimpton]] in 1965|298x298px]]In 1967, seven of the top model agents in London formed the Association of London Model Agents. The formation of this association helped legitimize modelling and changed the fashion industry. Even with a more professional attitude towards modelling, models were still expected to have their hair and makeup done before they arrived at a shoot. Meanwhile, agencies took responsibility for a model's promotional materials and branding. That same year, former top fashion model [[Wilhelmina Cooper]] opened up her own fashion agency with her husband called [[Wilhelmina Models]].

With the popularity of lingerie retailer [[Victoria's Secret]], and the ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'', there was a need for healthier-looking{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} supermodels such as [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Heidi Klum]] to meet commercial modelling demand.

As fashion changed to a more youthful [[Demography|demographic]], the models who rose to fame had to be sexier for the digital age. Following [[Gisele Bundchen]]'s breakthrough, a wave of [[Brazil]]ian models including [[Adriana Lima]] and [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] rose to fame on runways and became popular in commercial modelling throughout the 2000s.

Therefore, plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines.

With the recognition Versaillies had given, black presence in the modeling world carried out into the 1980s and the 1990s. The models were now known by name and the publicity that came with the designers they were modeling for.

However, some extremely popular glamour models transition into commercial print modelling, appearing in [[swimwear]], [[bikini]] and [[lingerie]] campaigns.\n\nIt is widely considered{{By whom|date=March 2015}} that England created the market for glamour modelling when ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' established [[Page Three|Page 3]] in 1969,<ref name=\"bbc3651850\">{{cite news |last=Braid |first=Mary |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |title=UK &#124; Magazine &#124; Page Three girls \u2013 the naked truth |work=BBC News |date=2004-09-14 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904054436/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |archive-date=2012-09-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> a section in their newspaper which featured sexually suggestive images of ''Penthouse'' and ''Playboy'' models. From 1970 models appeared topless. In the 1980s, ''The Sun''{{'s}} competitors followed suit and produced their own Page 3 sections.<ref name=\"bbc3651850\"/> It was during this time that glamour models first came to prominence with the likes of [[Samantha Fox]]. As a result, the United Kingdom has a very large glamour market and has numerous glamour modelling agencies to this day.\n\nIt was not until the 1990s that modern glamour modelling was established. During this time, the fashion industry was promoting models with waif bodies and androgynous looking women, which left a void. Several fashion models, who were deemed too commercial, and too curvaceous, were frustrated with industry standards, and took a different approach. Models such as [[Victoria Silvstedt]] left the fashion world and began modelling for men's magazines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |title=Biography |publisher=Victoriasilvstedt.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918175550/http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |archive-date=2012-09-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the previous decades, posing nude for ''Playboy''  resulted in models losing their agencies and endorsements.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey |title=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey: Bebe Buell, Victor Bockris: 9780312266943: Amazon.com: Books |df= |isbn=0312266944 |date=2001-08-13 |url=https://archive.org/details/rebelheart00bebe }}</ref> ''Playboy'' was a stepping stone which catapulted the careers of Victoria Silvstedt, [[Pamela Anderson]], and [[Anna Nicole Smith]]. Pamela Anderson became so popular from her ''Playboy'' spreads that she was able to land roles on ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' and ''[[Baywatch]]''.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, a series of men's magazines were established such as ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'', ''[[FHM]]'', and ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]''. At the same time, magazines including Sweden's ''[[Slitz]]'' re-branded themselves as men's magazines. Pre-internet, these magazines were popular among men in their late teens and early twenties because they were considered to be more tasteful than their predecessors. With the glamour market growing, fashion moved away from the waifs and onto Brazilian bombshells. The glamour market, which consisted mostly of commercial fashion models and commercial print models, became its own genre due to its popularity. Even in a large market like the United Kingdom, however, glamour models are not usually signed exclusively to one agency as they can not rely financially on one agency to provide them with enough work. It was, and still is, a common practice for glamour models to partake in kiss-and-tell interviews about their dalliances with famous men.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The notoriety of their alleged bed-hopping often propels their popularity and they are often promoted by their current or former fling.<ref>{{cite web |author=Gente |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |title='Intervi\u00fa' desnuda a Nereida Gallardo, la novia de Cristiano Ronaldo |publisher=20minutos.es |date=2008-04-26 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221153140/http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |archive-date=2011-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> With Page 3 models becoming fixtures in the British tabloids, glamour models such as Jordan, now known as [[Katie Price]], became household names.

Petite models typically work more often in commercial, and print modeling (rather than runway modeling)\n\nThe height of models is typically above {{convert|5|ft|9|in}} for women, and above {{convert|6|ft|2|in}} for men. Models who are of heights such as {{convert|5|ft|5|in}} fall under the category of petite models.\n\nPetite models typically model shoes because their feet are of more common sizes compared to the average fashion model.\n\n===Fitness models===\n{{See also|Fitness and figure competition}}\n[[File:Fitness Model Britt 2007.JPG|thumb|upright|Fitness model posing with [[dumbbell]]]]\nFitness modelling focuses on displaying a healthy, toned physique. Fitness models usually have defined muscle groups. The model's body weight is greater due to muscle weighing more than fat; however, they have a lower body fat percentage because the muscles are toned and sculpted. Fitness models are often used in magazine advertising; they can also in some cases be certified personal fitness trainers. However, other fitness models are also athletes and compete as professionals in [[fitness and figure competition]]s. There are several agencies in large markets such as New York, London, and Germany that have fitness modelling agencies. While there is a large market for these models, most of these agencies are a secondary agency promoting models who typically earn their primary income as commercial models. There are also magazines that gear towards specifically fitness modelling or getting fit and in shape.\n\n===Gravure idols===\n\n{{see also|List of Japanese gravure idols}}\n\nIn Japan, a {{nihongo4|gravure idol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb|gurabia aidoru}}, often abbreviated to {{nihongo4|gradol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30c9\u30eb|guradoru}}, is a female model who primarily models for magazines, especially men's magazines, photobooks or DVDs. {{nihongo4|\"Gurabia\"|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2}} is a [[Wasei-eigo]] term derived from \"[[rotogravure]]\", which is a type of [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] [[printing]] process that was once a staple of newspaper photo features. The rotogravure process is still used for commercial printing of magazines, [[postcard]]s, and [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]] product packaging.<ref name=\"kelana\">{{cite news|last1=Jimi Okelana|title=Japan 101: Guide to Gravure Idols|url=http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|accessdate=2 August 2016|work=Axiom Magazine|date=March 10, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728194637/http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|archivedate=28 July 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\t \nGravure idols appear in a wide range of photographic styles and genres. Their photos are largely aimed at male audiences with poses or activities intended to be provocative or suggestive, generally accentuated by an air of playfulness and innocence rather than aggressive sexuality. Although gravure idols may sometimes wear clothing that exposes most of their body, they seldom appear fully nude. Gravure idols may be as young as pre-teen age up to their early thirties. In addition to appearing in mainstream magazines, gravure idols often release their own professional photobooks and DVDs for their fans. Many popular [[Japanese idol|female idols in Japan]] launched their careers by starting out as gravure idols.<ref name=\"kelana\"/><ref name=\"Springer\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Galbraith |editor1-first=P.

Commercial print models can earn up to $250 an hour. Commercial print models are usually non-exclusive, and primarily work in one location.\n\nThere are several large fashion agencies that have commercial print divisions, including Ford Models in the United States.\n\n===Promotional models===\n{{Main|Promotional model}}\n[[File:IZIBA2004 056 (1924606).jpg|thumb|Two models with the logo of [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]], a cigarette brand they are promoting, printed on the backside of their shorts in [[Ibiza]], 2004]]\nA promotional model is a model hired to drive [[consumer demand]] for a product, service, brand, or concept by directly interacting with potential consumers. The vast majority of promotional models tend to be attractive in physical appearance. They serve to provide information about the product or service and make it appealing to consumers. While the length of interaction may be short, the promotional model delivers a live experience that reflects on the product or service he or she is representing.  This form of marketing touches fewer consumers for the cost than traditional [[advertising media]] (such as print, radio, and television); however, the consumer's perception of a brand, product, service, or company is often more profoundly affected by a live person-to-person experience.\n\n[[Marketing campaign]]s that make use of promotional models may take place in [[Retailing|stores]] or [[shopping mall]]s, at [[tradeshow]]s, special promotional events, clubs, or even at outdoor public spaces. Promotional models may also be used as TV host/anchor for interviewing celebrities such as at film awards, sports events, etc. They are often held at high traffic locations to reach as many consumers as possible, or at venues at which a particular type of target consumer is expected to be present.\n\n====Spokesmodels====\n{{main|Spokesmodel}}\n\"Spokesmodel\" is a term used for a model who is employed to be associated with a specific [[brand]] in [[advertisement]]s. A spokesmodel may be a celebrity used only in advertisements (in contrast to a brand ambassador who is also expected to represent the company at various events), but more often the term refers to a model who is not a celebrity in their own right. A classic example of the spokesmodel are the models hired to be the [[Marlboro Man]] between 1954 and 1999.\n\n====Trade show models====\n[[Trade show]] models work a trade show floorspace or booth, and represent a company to attendees. Trade show models are typically not regular employees of the company, but are [[freelancer]]s hired by the company renting the booth space. They are hired for several reasons: trade show models can make a company's booth more visibly distinguishable from the hundreds of other booths with which it competes for attendee attention. They are articulate and quickly learn and explain or disseminate information on the company and its product(s) and service(s). And they can assist a company in handling a large number of attendees which the company might otherwise not have enough employees to accommodate, possibly increasing the number of sales or leads resulting from participation in the show.\n\n====Atmosphere models====\n[[File:Atmosphere Models 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Atmosphere models at a sexy costume party]]\n'''Atmosphere models''' are hired by the producers of themed events to enhance the atmosphere or ambience of their event. They are usually dressed in costumes exemplifying the theme of the event and are often placed strategically in various locations around the venue. It is common for event guests to have their picture taken with atmosphere models. For example, if someone is throwing a \"Brazilian Day\" celebration, they would hire models dressed in samba costumes and headdresses to stand or walk around the party{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.\n\n====Podium models====\n[[File:Podium Model 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Podium model modeling a dress by [[Sue Wong]]]]\n'''Podium models''' differ from runway models in that they don't walk down a runway, but rather just stand on an elevated platform. They are kind of like live mannequins placed in various places throughout an event. Attendees can walk up to the models and inspect and even feel the clothing.  Podium Modeling is a practical alternative way of presenting a fashion show when space is too limited to have a full runway fashion show.\n\n===Art models===\n{{Main|Model (art)}}\n[[File:2009-08-31-akt-muehle-099.jpg|thumb|left|Art school model]]\n'''Art models''' pose for any [[visual artist]] as part of the [[creative process]]. Art models are often paid [[professionals]] who provide a reference or inspiration for a [[work of art]] that includes the human figure. The most common types of art created using models are [[figure drawing]], [[figure painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[photography]], but almost any medium may be used. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in [[illustration]], its artwork commonly employs models. Models are most frequently employed for [[art school|art classes]] or by informal groups of experienced artists that gather to share the expense of a model.\n\n===Instagram models===\n'''Instagram models''' have become popular due to the widespread use of [[social media]]. They are models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on [[Instagram]] and other social media. They should not be confused with established models such as [[Cara Delevingne]] and [[Gigi Hadid]], who use Instagram to promote their traditional modelling careers,<ref name=ABC/> although some models, such as [[Playboy]] model [[Lindsey Pelas]], begin their modelling careers conventionally and subsequently become Instagram models. Some models use Instagram success to develop their careers, such as [[Rosie Roff]] who worked as a fashion model before being discovered via Instagram and gaining work as a [[ring girl]] in American boxing. In some cases, Instagram provides unsigned models with a platform to attract the attention of agencies and talent scouts.<ref name=Saul>{{cite newspaper|title=Instafamous: Meet the social media influencers redefining celebrity|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|date=27 March 2016|author=Heather Saul|newspaper=Independent|access-date=2017-09-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901063025/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|archive-date=2017-09-01|url-status=live}}</ref> American model [[Matthew Noszka]] entered the profession as a result of being discovered on Instagram by [[Wilhelmina Models]].<ref name=ABC>{{cite news|title=From Construction to High Fashion: How Instagram Helped This Male Model Get Discovered|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|date=26 February 2015|author1=Mara Schiavocampo|author2=Claire Pedersen|author3=Timor Balaish|author4=Lauren Effron|publisher=ABC News|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229052246/http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|archive-date=2017-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Instagram model concept originated in the late 2000s, when the boyfriends of fashion bloggers such as [[Rumi Neely]] and [[Chiara Ferragni]] began photographing their girlfriends in various outfits.<ref name=Spinks>{{cite web|title=What It's Actually Like to Be an Instagram Model|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/what-instagram-models-actually-do|work=Vice|author=Rosie Spinks|date=7 August 2016}}</ref> Instagram models often attempt to become social media influencers and engage in [[influencer marketing]],<ref name=Saul/> promoting products such as fashion brands and detox teas.<ref name=Spinks/> High-profile influencers are able to earn thousands of US dollars for promoting commercial brands.

Although the difference between modelling and performing is not always clear, appearing in a film or a play is not generally considered to be \"modelling\".\n\nTypes of modelling include: fashion, glamour, fitness, bikini, fine art, body-part, promotional, and commercial print models. Models are featured in a variety of media formats including: books, magazines, films, newspapers, [[Internet modelling|internet]] and television.

Eventually, this became common practice for [[French fashion#Final 19th, the Belle \u00e9poque and early 20th century|Parisian fashion houses]]. There were no standard physical measurement requirements for a model, and most designers would use women of varying sizes to demonstrate variety in their [[Fashion design|designs]].\n\nWith the development of [[fashion photography]], the modelling profession expanded to photo modelling. Models remained fairly anonymous, and relatively poorly paid, until the late 1940s, when the world's first three supermodels, [[Barbara Goalen]], [[Bettina Graziani]] and [[Lisa Fonssagrives]] began commanding very large sums. During the 1940s and 1950s, Graziani was the most photographed woman in France and the undisputed queen of couture, while Fonssagrives appeared on over 200 ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' covers; her name recognition led to the importance of ''Vogue'' in shaping the careers of fashion models. One of the most popular models during the 1940s was [[Jinx Falkenburg]] who was paid $25 per hour, a large sum at the time; <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/Fashion_1940s_Modeling |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401102507/http://www.oldmagazinearticles.com/Fashion_1940s_Modeling |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-04-01 |title=fashion models 1940s, fashion modeling in 1940, Forties Fashion modeling agencies, first fashion modeling agency in New York, 1940s fashion models, John Powers modeling agency, girls of the John Roberts Powers modeling agency, Powers Girls Photographs, popular 1 |publisher=Oldmagazinearticles.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 }}</ref> through the 1950s, [[Wilhelmina Cooper]], [[Jean Patchett]], [[Dovima]], [[Dorian Leigh]], [[Suzy Parker]], [[Evelyn Tripp]], and [[Carmen Dell'Orefice]] also dominated fashion.<ref>{{cite newspaper |author=Cathy Horyn|date=4 February 2002 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/04/nyregion/jean-patchett-75-a-model-who-helped-define-the-50-s.html |title=Jean Patchett, 75, a Model Who Helped Define the 50s |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=19 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829054807/http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/04/nyregion/jean-patchett-75-a-model-who-helped-define-the-50-s.html |archive-date=29 August 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Dorothea Church]] was among the first black models in the industry to gain recognition in Paris.

Throughout Europe, secretarial services acted as models' agents charging them weekly rates for their messages and bookings. For the most part, models were responsible for their own billing. In Germany, agents were not allowed to work for a percentage of a person's earnings, so referred to themselves as secretaries. With the exception of a few models travelling to Paris or New York, travelling was relatively unheard of for a model. Most models only worked in one market due to different labor laws governing modelling in various countries. In the 1960s, Italy had many fashion houses and [[fashion magazines]] but was in dire need of models. Italian agencies would often coerce models to return to Italy without work visas by withholding their pay.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708041838/http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|url=http://www.modelscomposites.com/history.htm|archive-date=8 July 2008|date=January 2007|title=A Brief History Of Modelling|author=Peter Marlowe|website=The Peter Marlowe Model Composite Archives}}</ref> They would also pay their models in cash, which models would have to hide from [[customs]] agents. It was not uncommon for models staying in hotels such as La Louisiana in [[Paris]] or the Arena in [[Milan]] to have their hotel rooms raided by the police looking for their work visas. It was rumoured that competing agencies were behind the raids. This led many agencies to form worldwide chains; for example, the [[Marilyn Agency]] has branches in Paris and New York.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nBy the late 1960s, [[London]] was considered the best market in Europe due to its more organised and innovative approach to modelling. It was during this period that models began to become household names. Models such as [[Jean Shrimpton]], [[Tania Mallet]], [[Celia Hammond]], [[Twiggy]], [[Penelope Tree]], and dominated the London fashion scene and were well paid, unlike their predecessors.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |title=David Bailey's favourite model Jean Shrimpton was the Shrimp who sparked the Sixties \u2013 Telegraph |publisher=Fashion.telegraph.co.uk |accessdate=2012-09-19 |location=London |first=Lisa |last=Armstrong |date=2012-01-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120827035540/http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/article/TMG9013918/David-Baileys-favourite-model-Jean-Shrimpton-was-the-Shrimp-who-sparked-the-Sixties.html |archive-date=2012-08-27 |url-status=live }}</ref> Twiggy became The Face of '66 at the age of 16.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030211153058/http://www.twiggylawson.co.uk/fashion.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2003-02-11 |title=Twiggy \u2013 The Official Site |publisher=Twiggylawson.co.uk |date=1966-02-23 |accessdate=2012-09-19 }}</ref> At this time, model agencies were not as restrictive about the models they represented, although it was uncommon for them to sign shorter models. Twiggy, who stood at {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm}} with a 32\" bust and had a boy's haircut, is credited with changing model ideals. At that time, she earned \u00a380 an hour, while the average wage was \u00a315 a week.[[File:Jean Shrimpton (1965).jpg|thumb|[[Jean Shrimpton]] in 1965|298x298px]]In 1967, seven of the top model agents in London formed the Association of London Model Agents. The formation of this association helped legitimize modelling and changed the fashion industry. Even with a more professional attitude towards modelling, models were still expected to have their hair and makeup done before they arrived at a shoot. Meanwhile, agencies took responsibility for a model's promotional materials and branding. That same year, former top fashion model [[Wilhelmina Cooper]] opened up her own fashion agency with her husband called [[Wilhelmina Models]]. By 1968, FM Agency and [[Models&nbsp;1]] were established and represented models in a similar way that agencies do today.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.models1.co.uk/contact.aspx?nav=23 |title=Europe's Leading Model Agency |publisher=Models 1 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020130053/http://www.models1.co.uk/contact.aspx?nav=23 |archivedate=2012-10-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fmmodelagency.com/contact.aspx?nav=2 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928133313/http://www.fmmodelagency.com/contact.aspx?nav=2 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-09-28 |title=FM Agency \u2013 London \u2013 Contact |publisher=Fmmodelagency.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 }}</ref> By the late 1960s, models were treated better and were making better wages.

This was the precursor to the [[Ford Models Supermodel of the World]] competition which was established in 1980. Ford also focused their attentions on Brazil which had a wide array of seemingly \"exotic\" models, which eventually led to establishment of Ford Models Brazil.

[[Kate Moss]] became its poster child through her ads for [[Calvin Klein]]. In spite of the heroin chic movement, model [[Claudia Schiffer]] earned $12&nbsp;million. With the popularity of lingerie retailer [[Victoria's Secret]], and the ''[[Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue]]'', there was a need for healthier-looking{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} supermodels such as [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Heidi Klum]] to meet commercial modelling demand. The mid\u20111990s also saw many Asian countries establishing modelling agencies.\n\nBy the late 1990s, the heroin chic era had run its course. Teen-inspired clothing infiltrated mainstream fashion, teen [[pop music]] was on the rise, and artists such as [[Britney Spears]], [[Aaliyah]] and [[Christina Aguilera]] popularized [[Artificial leather|pleather]] and bare midriffs. As fashion changed to a more youthful [[Demography|demographic]], the models who rose to fame had to be sexier for the digital age. Following [[Gisele Bundchen]]'s breakthrough, a wave of [[Brazil]]ian models including [[Adriana Lima]] and [[Alessandra Ambrosio]] rose to fame on runways and became popular in commercial modelling throughout the 2000s. Some have tied this increase in Brazilian models to the trend of magazines featuring celebrities instead of models on their covers.<ref name=\"um\">''Death of the Supermodels'' by C. L.

Plus-size models are also engaged in work that is not strictly related to selling large-sized clothing, e.g., [[stock photography]] and advertising photography for cosmetics, household and pharmaceutical products and sunglasses, footwear and watches. Therefore, plus-size models do not exclusively wear garments marketed as plus-size clothing. This is especially true when participating in fashion editorials for mainstream fashion magazines. Some plus-size models have appeared in runway shows and campaigns for mainstream retailers and designers such as Gucci, Guess, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Levi's and Versace Jeans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwd.com/media-news/advertising/qa-paul-marciano-on-30-years-of-guess-campaigns-5882940 |title=Q&A: Paul Marciano on 30 Years of Guess Campaigns |author=Tran, Khan T.L. |date=1 May 2012 |work=wwd.com |publisher=Women's Wear Daily |accessdate=12 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120706050948/http://www.wwd.com/media-news/advertising/qa-paul-marciano-on-30-years-of-guess-campaigns-5882940 |archive-date=2012-07-06 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fashion%27s+new+Dahling%3B+ALL+WOMAN%3A+SOPHIE+MAKES+A+COMEBACK+WITH+THREE...-a063096063 |title=Fashion's new Dahling; All Woman: Sophie Makes A Comeback with Three New Contracts and a Sexy, Slimmer Look. |author=Brown, Annie |date=3 July 2000 |newspaper=The Daily Record |accessdate=15 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019124720/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Fashion%27s+new+Dahling%3B+ALL+WOMAN%3A+SOPHIE+MAKES+A+COMEBACK+WITH+THREE...-a063096063 |archive-date=2013-10-19 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Serpe, Gina\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/292057/anna-nicole-smith-s-death-five-years-on-timeline-of-a-tragedy |title=Anna Nicole Smith's Death Five Years On: Timeline of a Tragedy |author=Serpe, Gina |date=8 February 2012 |work=people.com |publisher=People Magazine |accessdate=13 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012182511/http://www.eonline.com/news/292057/anna-nicole-smith-s-death-five-years-on-timeline-of-a-tragedy |archive-date=2012-10-12 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://models.com/work/levis-boyfriend-collection-fw10/60882 |title=Levi's Boyfriend Collection F/W 10 |work=models.com |accessdate=20 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513085352/http://models.com/work/levis-boyfriend-collection-fw10/60882 |archive-date=2012-05-13 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==== Normal-size ====\n[[File:Camille_Kostek_in_New_York,_July_2017_1.png|alt=|left|thumb|196x196px|[[Camille Kostek]] is a normal-size or \"middle model\" at size 4/6]]\nAlso known as the \"in-between\" and \"middle models\",<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/fashion/people/not-middle-sized-models-fashion/|title=Why aren't there more 'middle' sized models in fashion?|last=Holt|first=Bethan|date=2018-11-10|work=The Telegraph|access-date=2019-08-15|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> they are neither considered catalogue size (0\u20132) nor plus-size (10 up).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brit.co/why-middle-models-left-out-of-traditional-fashion-industry/|title=Why the Average American Woman Is Being Left Out of the Traditional Fashion Industry|website=Brit + Co|language=en|access-date=2019-08-15|date=2018-05-30}}</ref> Actress [[Mindy Kaling]] has described this body type in her 2011 book ''Is Everybody Hanging out With Me'' writing, \"Since I am not model-skinny, but also not super-fat...

It began most notably from the need of advertisers and a rise of African American photography magazines. The women who advanced in such careers were those in a middle-class system that emphasized the conservative value of marriage, motherhood, and domesticity. Originally titled the \u201cBrownskin\u201d model, African American women refined the social, sexual, and racial realities confined in the gender expectations of the modeling world. There was a profound need for black women to partake in the advertising process for the new \u201cNegro Market\u201d.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Haidarali|first=Laila|date=2005|title=Polishing Brown Diamonds: African American Women, Popular Magazines, and the Advent of Modeling in Early Postwar America|journal=Journal of Women's History|language=en|volume=17|issue=1|pages=10\u201337|doi=10.1353/jowh.2005.0007|issn=1527-2036}}</ref> With the help of Branford Models, the first African American agency, 1946 was the beginning of the black modeling era. Branford Models\u2019 was able to \u201coverturn the barriers facing African American in the early postwar period\u201d especially by lifting at least one economic freedom.<ref name=\":0\" /> In this postwar America, the demand for such presence in magazines advanced \u201cas a stage for models to display consumer goods\u201d while assisting \u201cin constructing a new visual discourse of urban middle-class African America\u201d.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhile they represented diversity, a major gap in the fashion industry, it was only until the 1970s that black models had a substantial presence in the modeling world. Known as the \u201cBlack is Beautiful\u201d movement, the 1970s became the era of the black model. With growing disenfranchisement and racial in-equality, the United States recognized the urgency of opening the \u201cdoors of social access and visibility to black Americans\u201d.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Newman|first=Scarlett L.|date=2017|title=Black Models Matter: Challenging the Racism of Aesthetics and the Facade of Inclusion in the Fashion Industry|url=https://academicworks.cuny.edu/gc_etds/2143|journal=CUNY Academic Works|volume=|pages=|via=Academic Works}}</ref> The world of fashion was the gateway for social change. \u201cThe world of fashion was similarly looked to as a place where the culture could find signs of racial progress. Expressions of beauty and glamour mattered. Good race relations required taking note of who was selling women lipsticks and mini skirts, which meant that advertisers began looking for black models\u201d<ref name=\":1\" /> Black models were looked to as the vehicle of social change. They were given the opportunity to balance out the lack of presence of black individuals in the mainstream culture. Agencies were beginning to scout black models and focus on the social change they were contributing too. [[Life (magazine)|Life Magazine]] in October 1969, covered their issue with [[Naomi Sims|Noami Sims]], one of the most influential black models in the industry. Her rise to fame lead her to international magazine jobs and individual projects with designers across the globe.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/news/naomi-campbell-famous-black-models|title=Naomi Campbell and 10 Black Models Who Owned the Runway|last=Haynes|first=Clarence|date=June 24, 2019|website=Biography|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 11, 2019}}</ref> In the Life Magazine issue, Black Beauty, a new agency that represented black models, had a spread in the magazine that showcased 39 black models. Each one of the models had their own unique features, allowing black expression to progress through this historic magazine spread.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nWith the movement's presence both in magazines and the runway, designers began to realize the need to include black models on their runways and advertisements. The battle of Versallies was one of the most notable moments in fashion history that put black models on the map. [[Eleanor Lambert]], creator of Fashion Week and a major \u201c[controller] of the narrative of American fashion\u201d, set up a dinner and a fundraiser to both increase American fashion visibility and restore the palace of Versailles.<ref name=\":1\" /> Five French designers and five American designers battled it out on the runway, showing off the fashion, and for the Americans, black models as well. [[Oscar de la Renta]] stated \u201cit was the black models that had made the difference.\u201d [[Pat Cleveland]], [[Bethann Hardison|Bethann Hardiason]], [[Billie Blair]], Jennifer Brice, Alva Chinn, and [[The Battle of Versailles Fashion Show|Ramona Saunders,]] were among the many black models that helped Team America win and stun the French competition. This competition made the black model a worldwide phenomenon. The French were beginning to welcome diversity on the runway and in their advertising. With the recognition Versaillies had given, black presence in the modeling world carried out into the 1980s and the 1990s. The models were now known by name and the publicity that came with the designers they were modeling for. With the rise of the \u201csupermodel\u201d, models like [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]] and [[Tyra Banks]] paved the way for black success.<ref name=\":1\" /> [[Naomi Campbell|Noami Campbell]], born in London, was the first black model to cover [[Vogue (magazine)|American Vogue]], [[Time (magazine)|TIME magazine]], Russian Vogue, and the first British black model to cover British vogue. She, till this day, is one of the most iconic and distinguished models to work in the industry. Brands like [[Chanel]], [[Louis Vuitton|Louis Vitton]], [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]], [[Prada]], and more have all featured Campbell in their campaigns. She used her remarkable success to achieve more than fashion excelience.\n[[File:Tyra Banks 1995.jpg|thumb|Tyra Banks (1995)]]\nBy the mid-1990s, black presence in the modeling world had dramatically decreased. Designers began to favor a consistent aesthetic and elected for skinner white models. This reality was paved by models like [[Kate Moss]] and [[Stella Tennant]] who provided a more consistent look for the runway. At this time, \u201cthe number of working black models in high-profile runway presentation...became so dire that stories began appearing in the mainstream media about the whitewashing of the runway\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecut.com/2013/09/givhan-confronting-the-lack-of-black-models.html|title=Robin Givhan: Confronting the Lack of Black Models on the Runway|last=Givhan|first=Robin|date=September 6, 2013|website=The Cut|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref> In response, models like Campbell, Iman, and Bethann Hardison, joined forces throughout the \u201cDiversity Coalition\u201d in an attempt to \u201ccall out and accuse prominent fashion houses for snubbing Black and Asian models on the catwalk, editorial spreads, and campaigns\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> The lack of representation was, in part, due to the belief that \u201cblack girls don\u2019t push products,\u201d which \u201cencouraged people who work directly and indirectly in the industry to speak out on the injustices that go on within it\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> In the 1990s, it was quite clear that the top designers simply preferred a new aesthetic that excluded models of color, which resulted in only 6% of runway models to be women of color.<ref name=\":1\" /> Campbell's Diversity Coalition's main mission was to \u201cexpedite inclusion on the runway by deliberately calling out designers who have executed acts of racism on the runway\u201d.<ref name=\":1\" /> According to Campbell, it was their choice to not include black models on the runway and desire a uniformed runway that resulted in a racist act. Although such a dramatic effort to exclude black presence from the fashion world, models like [[Tyra Banks]] and [[Veronica Webb]] persisted. Banks not only dominated the runway as a teen, she took over countless pop culture platforms. Being the first black model to cover [[Sports Illustrated]], Banks was one of the most prominent models in the early 2000s. Covering [[Sports Illustrated]], Elle, [[Essence (magazine)|Essence]], [[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]], and walking for [[Chanel]], [[Christian Dior (fashion house)|Chrisitan Dior]], and Claude Motnanta, Banks was truly dominating the fashion world. In addition, she acted in ''French Prince of Bel Air'' and created her own reality competition show called [[America's Next Top Model]].<ref name=\":2\" /> In conversation with Trebay of Los the New York Times, Banks stated that her first cover on Sport Illustrated \u201cchanged [her] life overnight.. You have to think back to remember what that did for an appreciation of black beauty to have a black girl, a girl next door type, on the cover of one of the most mass mainstream magazines of our lives.

Glamour models can be any size or shape. There is no industry standard for glamour modelling and it varies greatly by country. For the most part, glamour models are limited to modelling in [[calendar]]s, [[men's magazine]]s, such as ''[[Playboy]]'', [[bikini]] modelling, [[lingerie]] modelling, fetish modelling, music videos, and extra work in films. However, some extremely popular glamour models transition into commercial print modelling, appearing in [[swimwear]], [[bikini]] and [[lingerie]] campaigns.\n\nIt is widely considered{{By whom|date=March 2015}} that England created the market for glamour modelling when ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' established [[Page Three|Page 3]] in 1969,<ref name=\"bbc3651850\">{{cite news |last=Braid |first=Mary |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |title=UK &#124; Magazine &#124; Page Three girls \u2013 the naked truth |work=BBC News |date=2004-09-14 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904054436/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3651850.stm |archive-date=2012-09-04 |url-status=live }}</ref> a section in their newspaper which featured sexually suggestive images of ''Penthouse'' and ''Playboy'' models.

In the 1980s, ''The Sun''{{'s}} competitors followed suit and produced their own Page 3 sections.<ref name=\"bbc3651850\"/> It was during this time that glamour models first came to prominence with the likes of [[Samantha Fox]]. As a result, the United Kingdom has a very large glamour market and has numerous glamour modelling agencies to this day.\n\nIt was not until the 1990s that modern glamour modelling was established. During this time, the fashion industry was promoting models with waif bodies and androgynous looking women, which left a void. Several fashion models, who were deemed too commercial, and too curvaceous, were frustrated with industry standards, and took a different approach. Models such as [[Victoria Silvstedt]] left the fashion world and began modelling for men's magazines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |title=Biography |publisher=Victoriasilvstedt.com |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918175550/http://victoriasilvstedt.com/Biography/tabid/53/Default.aspx |archive-date=2012-09-18 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the previous decades, posing nude for ''Playboy''  resulted in models losing their agencies and endorsements.<ref>{{cite book |author=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey |title=Rebel Heart: An American Rock 'n' Roll Journey: Bebe Buell, Victor Bockris: 9780312266943: Amazon.com: Books |df= |isbn=0312266944 |date=2001-08-13 |url=https://archive.org/details/rebelheart00bebe }}</ref> ''Playboy'' was a stepping stone which catapulted the careers of Victoria Silvstedt, [[Pamela Anderson]], and [[Anna Nicole Smith]]. Pamela Anderson became so popular from her ''Playboy'' spreads that she was able to land roles on ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' and ''[[Baywatch]]''.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, a series of men's magazines were established such as ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'', ''[[FHM]]'', and ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]''. At the same time, magazines including Sweden's ''[[Slitz]]'' re-branded themselves as men's magazines. Pre-internet, these magazines were popular among men in their late teens and early twenties because they were considered to be more tasteful than their predecessors. With the glamour market growing, fashion moved away from the waifs and onto Brazilian bombshells. The glamour market, which consisted mostly of commercial fashion models and commercial print models, became its own genre due to its popularity. Even in a large market like the United Kingdom, however, glamour models are not usually signed exclusively to one agency as they can not rely financially on one agency to provide them with enough work. It was, and still is, a common practice for glamour models to partake in kiss-and-tell interviews about their dalliances with famous men.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} The notoriety of their alleged bed-hopping often propels their popularity and they are often promoted by their current or former fling.<ref>{{cite web |author=Gente |url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |title='Intervi\u00fa' desnuda a Nereida Gallardo, la novia de Cristiano Ronaldo |publisher=20minutos.es |date=2008-04-26 |accessdate=2012-09-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221153140/http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/373321/0/novia/cristiano/desnuda/ |archive-date=2011-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> With Page 3 models becoming fixtures in the British tabloids, glamour models such as Jordan, now known as [[Katie Price]], became household names.

Petite models typically work more often in commercial, and print modeling (rather than runway modeling)\n\nThe height of models is typically above {{convert|5|ft|9|in}} for women, and above {{convert|6|ft|2|in}} for men. Models who are of heights such as {{convert|5|ft|5|in}} fall under the category of petite models.\n\nPetite models typically model shoes because their feet are of more common sizes compared to the average fashion model.\n\n===Fitness models===\n{{See also|Fitness and figure competition}}\n[[File:Fitness Model Britt 2007.JPG|thumb|upright|Fitness model posing with [[dumbbell]]]]\nFitness modelling focuses on displaying a healthy, toned physique. Fitness models usually have defined muscle groups. The model's body weight is greater due to muscle weighing more than fat; however, they have a lower body fat percentage because the muscles are toned and sculpted. Fitness models are often used in magazine advertising; they can also in some cases be certified personal fitness trainers. However, other fitness models are also athletes and compete as professionals in [[fitness and figure competition]]s. There are several agencies in large markets such as New York, London, and Germany that have fitness modelling agencies. While there is a large market for these models, most of these agencies are a secondary agency promoting models who typically earn their primary income as commercial models. There are also magazines that gear towards specifically fitness modelling or getting fit and in shape.\n\n===Gravure idols===\n\n{{see also|List of Japanese gravure idols}}\n\nIn Japan, a {{nihongo4|gravure idol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2\u30a2\u30a4\u30c9\u30eb|gurabia aidoru}}, often abbreviated to {{nihongo4|gradol|\u30b0\u30e9\u30c9\u30eb|guradoru}}, is a female model who primarily models for magazines, especially men's magazines, photobooks or DVDs. {{nihongo4|\"Gurabia\"|\u30b0\u30e9\u30d3\u30a2}} is a [[Wasei-eigo]] term derived from \"[[rotogravure]]\", which is a type of [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] [[printing]] process that was once a staple of newspaper photo features. The rotogravure process is still used for commercial printing of magazines, [[postcard]]s, and [[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]] product packaging.<ref name=\"kelana\">{{cite news|last1=Jimi Okelana|title=Japan 101: Guide to Gravure Idols|url=http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|accessdate=2 August 2016|work=Axiom Magazine|date=March 10, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160728194637/http://www.axiommagazine.jp/2012/03/10/japanese-gravure-idols-101/|archivedate=28 July 2016|df=}}</ref>\n\t \nGravure idols appear in a wide range of photographic styles and genres. Their photos are largely aimed at male audiences with poses or activities intended to be provocative or suggestive, generally accentuated by an air of playfulness and innocence rather than aggressive sexuality. Although gravure idols may sometimes wear clothing that exposes most of their body, they seldom appear fully nude. Gravure idols may be as young as pre-teen age up to their early thirties. In addition to appearing in mainstream magazines, gravure idols often release their own professional photobooks and DVDs for their fans. Many popular [[Japanese idol|female idols in Japan]] launched their careers by starting out as gravure idols.<ref name=\"kelana\"/><ref name=\"Springer\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Galbraith |editor1-first=P.

Many famous AV idols started out as gravure idols.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.tokyokinky.com/akb48-idols-nude-models-porn-careers/ |title = Former AKB48 idols who have \"graduated\" to porn careers |website=Tokyo Kinky |author=Tadashi Anahori |date=3 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Commercial print and on-camera models===\nCommercial print models generally appear in print ads for non-fashion products, and in television commercials. Commercial print models can earn up to $250 an hour. Commercial print models are usually non-exclusive, and primarily work in one location.\n\nThere are several large fashion agencies that have commercial print divisions, including Ford Models in the United States.\n\n===Promotional models===\n{{Main|Promotional model}}\n[[File:IZIBA2004 056 (1924606).jpg|thumb|Two models with the logo of [[Camel (cigarette)|Camel]], a cigarette brand they are promoting, printed on the backside of their shorts in [[Ibiza]], 2004]]\nA promotional model is a model hired to drive [[consumer demand]] for a product, service, brand, or concept by directly interacting with potential consumers. The vast majority of promotional models tend to be attractive in physical appearance. They serve to provide information about the product or service and make it appealing to consumers. While the length of interaction may be short, the promotional model delivers a live experience that reflects on the product or service he or she is representing.  This form of marketing touches fewer consumers for the cost than traditional [[advertising media]] (such as print, radio, and television); however, the consumer's perception of a brand, product, service, or company is often more profoundly affected by a live person-to-person experience.\n\n[[Marketing campaign]]s that make use of promotional models may take place in [[Retailing|stores]] or [[shopping mall]]s, at [[tradeshow]]s, special promotional events, clubs, or even at outdoor public spaces. Promotional models may also be used as TV host/anchor for interviewing celebrities such as at film awards, sports events, etc. They are often held at high traffic locations to reach as many consumers as possible, or at venues at which a particular type of target consumer is expected to be present.\n\n====Spokesmodels====\n{{main|Spokesmodel}}\n\"Spokesmodel\" is a term used for a model who is employed to be associated with a specific [[brand]] in [[advertisement]]s. A spokesmodel may be a celebrity used only in advertisements (in contrast to a brand ambassador who is also expected to represent the company at various events), but more often the term refers to a model who is not a celebrity in their own right. A classic example of the spokesmodel are the models hired to be the [[Marlboro Man]] between 1954 and 1999.\n\n====Trade show models====\n[[Trade show]] models work a trade show floorspace or booth, and represent a company to attendees. Trade show models are typically not regular employees of the company, but are [[freelancer]]s hired by the company renting the booth space. They are hired for several reasons: trade show models can make a company's booth more visibly distinguishable from the hundreds of other booths with which it competes for attendee attention. They are articulate and quickly learn and explain or disseminate information on the company and its product(s) and service(s). And they can assist a company in handling a large number of attendees which the company might otherwise not have enough employees to accommodate, possibly increasing the number of sales or leads resulting from participation in the show.\n\n====Atmosphere models====\n[[File:Atmosphere Models 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|Atmosphere models at a sexy costume party]]\n'''Atmosphere models''' are hired by the producers of themed events to enhance the atmosphere or ambience of their event. They are usually dressed in costumes exemplifying the theme of the event and are often placed strategically in various locations around the venue. It is common for event guests to have their picture taken with atmosphere models. For example, if someone is throwing a \"Brazilian Day\" celebration, they would hire models dressed in samba costumes and headdresses to stand or walk around the party{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}.\n\n====Podium models====\n[[File:Podium Model 2016.jpg|thumb|upright|Podium model modeling a dress by [[Sue Wong]]]]\n'''Podium models''' differ from runway models in that they don't walk down a runway, but rather just stand on an elevated platform. They are kind of like live mannequins placed in various places throughout an event. Attendees can walk up to the models and inspect and even feel the clothing.  Podium Modeling is a practical alternative way of presenting a fashion show when space is too limited to have a full runway fashion show.\n\n===Art models===\n{{Main|Model (art)}}\n[[File:2009-08-31-akt-muehle-099.jpg|thumb|left|Art school model]]\n'''Art models''' pose for any [[visual artist]] as part of the [[creative process]]. Art models are often paid [[professionals]] who provide a reference or inspiration for a [[work of art]] that includes the human figure. The most common types of art created using models are [[figure drawing]], [[figure painting]], [[sculpture]] and [[photography]], but almost any medium may be used. Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in [[illustration]], its artwork commonly employs models. Models are most frequently employed for [[art school|art classes]] or by informal groups of experienced artists that gather to share the expense of a model.\n\n===Instagram models===\n'''Instagram models''' have become popular due to the widespread use of [[social media]]. They are models who gain their success as a result of the large number of followers they have on [[Instagram]] and other social media. They should not be confused with established models such as [[Cara Delevingne]] and [[Gigi Hadid]], who use Instagram to promote their traditional modelling careers,<ref name=ABC/> although some models, such as [[Playboy]] model [[Lindsey Pelas]], begin their modelling careers conventionally and subsequently become Instagram models. Some models use Instagram success to develop their careers, such as [[Rosie Roff]] who worked as a fashion model before being discovered via Instagram and gaining work as a [[ring girl]] in American boxing. In some cases, Instagram provides unsigned models with a platform to attract the attention of agencies and talent scouts.<ref name=Saul>{{cite newspaper|title=Instafamous: Meet the social media influencers redefining celebrity|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|date=27 March 2016|author=Heather Saul|newspaper=Independent|access-date=2017-09-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170901063025/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/instagram-model-natasha-oakley-iskra-lawrence-kayla-itsines-kendall-jenner-jordyn-woods-a6907551.html|archive-date=2017-09-01|url-status=live}}</ref> American model [[Matthew Noszka]] entered the profession as a result of being discovered on Instagram by [[Wilhelmina Models]].<ref name=ABC>{{cite news|title=From Construction to High Fashion: How Instagram Helped This Male Model Get Discovered|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|date=26 February 2015|author1=Mara Schiavocampo|author2=Claire Pedersen|author3=Timor Balaish|author4=Lauren Effron|publisher=ABC News|access-date=2017-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171229052246/http://abcnews.go.com/Lifestyle/construction-high-fashion-instagram-helped-male-model-discovered/story?id=29253900|archive-date=2017-12-29|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Instagram model concept originated in the late 2000s, when the boyfriends of fashion bloggers such as [[Rumi Neely]] and [[Chiara Ferragni]] began photographing their girlfriends in various outfits.<ref name=Spinks>{{cite web|title=What It's Actually Like to Be an Instagram Model|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/what-instagram-models-actually-do|work=Vice|author=Rosie Spinks|date=7 August 2016}}</ref> Instagram models often attempt to become social media influencers and engage in [[influencer marketing]],<ref name=Saul/> promoting products such as fashion brands and detox teas.<ref name=Spinks/> High-profile influencers are able to earn thousands of US dollars for promoting commercial brands. When choosing whom to employ, brands have become less concerned with the number of followers an influencer has and more focussed on their [[engagement marketing]] strategy.

It is geographically adjacent to [[Sangre Grande]] and [[Arouca, Trinidad and Tobago|Arouca]] at the southcentral foothills of the [[Northern Range]]. To the south is the [[Caroni\u2013Arena Dam]]. Coterminous with '''Town of Arima''' since 1888, the borough of Arima is the fourth-largest municipality in population in the country (after [[Port of Spain]], [[Chaguanas]] and [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]]). The census estimated it had 33,606 residents in 2011.<ref name=\"2011census\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/sites/default/files/story/2011_DemographicReport.pdf|title=Trinidad and Tobago 2011 Census|publisher=Ministry of Planning and Sustainable Development|date=30 November 2012|access-date=15 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924042445/http://www.guardian.co.tt/sites/default/files/story/2011_DemographicReport.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nIn 1887, the town petitioned [[Queen Victoria]] for municipal status as part of her [[Golden Jubilee]] celebration. This was granted in the following year, and Arima became a Royal Borough on 1 August 1888.  Historically the third-largest town of Trinidad and Tobago, Arima is fourth since [[Chaguanas]] became the largest town in the country.\n\n==Geography==\n=== Climate ===\nThe borough has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Af''), bordering on a [[tropical monsoon climate]], characterised with little seasonal variations due to its close proximity to the [[Northern Range]]. Temperatures typically range from 19 to 33 degrees. The wet season lasts from June to November, and although there is no true dry season, there is a noticeably drier stretch from January to April.<ref>[https://en.climate-data.org/north-america/trinidad-and-tobago/arima/arima-46245/], Climate Arima, Climate-Data.org</ref> Hail has occurred in the town but is rare.\n\n==Culture and entertainment==\n[[File:ArimaDial.png|thumbnail|right|alt=Broadway, Arima.]] \nArima hosts an annual Borough Day anniversary celebration in August. The celebration incorporates Carnival-style street parades and usually coincides with the staging of the Santa Rosa Carib Community annual festival. The annual Arima Carnival includes street parades of masqueraders on Carnival Tuesday, J'ouvert bands on Carnival Monday, as well as a local calypso competition.\n\n==Demographics==\n===Ancestry===\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Trinidad and Tobago\n|align       = right\n|width       = 20%;\n|state       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    =\n|1980 |24112\n|1990 |26528\n|2000 |28310\n|2011 |33606\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|+ '''Borough of Arima racial breakdown'''\n|-\n!

Among other important routes are the Arima Bypass, Cocorite Street, Tumpuna Road and O'Meara Road which links neighbourhoods around the town to the Town Center.\n\n===Transit===\nArima plays an important role for north-eastern Trinidad as a multi-modal transportation hub for many of the towns and neighbourhoods on the eastern side of the island. A bus terminal provides service by the [[Public Transport Service Corporation|PTSC Bus]] network to [[Sangre Grande]], Mundo Nuevo, [[Blanchisseuse]], Carapo, [[Malabar, Trinidad and Tobago|Malabar]], Morne La Croix, [[La Horquetta]], Brasso Seco and to the capital [[Port of Spain]]. \n\n[[Maxi taxi]]s (private, owner-operated minibuses) operate throughout [[Trinidad and Tobago]] as a kind of semi-public transport. They operate along fixed routes, have fixed fares and meeting points, but do not operate under a fixed schedule. These [[maxi taxi]]s  provide services from the town center to [[Port of Spain]] via the [[Priority Bus Route]] and [[Churchill-Roosevelt Highway]], making stops along the [[East\u2013West Corridor]]. They also provide transport to [[Sangre Grande]].\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe major national super-league team, FC Santa Rosa and Arima Football League, which is based at the [[Arima Velodrome]].\n\nAbilene Wildcats Athletic Club, Trinity College East Athletics Club, Silver Bullets Athletic Club, D'Abadie Progressive Athletic Club, and Spartans High Speed Performance Athletic Club are also based in Arima.\n\nMost suburbs, communities and neighbourhoods around the Borough have their own sporting complexes and community swimming pools.\n\nThe three (3) major sporting arenas in Arima are:\n\n*[[Larry Gomes Stadium|The Larry Gomes Stadium]]\n*[[Arima Velodrome]]\n*Santa Rosa Race Track                                                                                                                                                                  Sunil Narine is the only West Indies cricket player to be born in Arima.\n\n== Attractions ==\n*[[Asa Wright Nature Centre]], located in Arima Valley, it has a nature walk and swimming at a freshwater pond.\n\n*[[Santa Rosa First Peoples Community|Santa Rosa Carib]] Centre, located on Paul Mitchell Road, off De Gannes Street in Arima, it contains items from Arima's native Carib history. It also has displays about Carib descendants in Arima. Native items are also available for purchase.\n\n*Cleaver Woods, it has nature walks and [[Amerindian]] exhibits.\n\n===Utilities===\n\nElectric generation is handled by [[Powergen]], while electrical distribution is handled by the [[Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission]] (T&TEC). Powergen has natural gas fired generation plants at Point Lisas, Penal, and Wrightson Road in Port of Spain. Additional power can be supplied from power generation facilities controlled by Inncogen at Point Lisas.\n\nTelecommunications are regulated by the Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (TATT). It has been working to break up the monopoly, granting several new licences in 2005 to new companies in the market. Fixed-line telephone service is a monopoly controlled by Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago (TSTT). Licenses have been granted for competition in this area, but start-up is a while away. Wireless telephony is controlled by TSTT and bmobile, as well as [[Digicel]], which came later. Licenses have been granted for a private company, Laqtel, to offer wireless service in competition with TSTT and Digicel. However, Laqtel had its licence revoked, and is undergoing severe financial difficulties.\n\nDigital cable television is provided by Flow. High-speed internet service of up to 100Mbit/s and digital landline telephone service are all available in Arima.\n\nWater and sewerage are under the purview of the Water and Sewerage Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (WASA).\n\n==Education==\nThere are several primary (private and public) and secondary educational institutions in Arima, and some post-secondary level technical training institutes. St. Joseph's Convent in Arima was closed many years ago and the building now houses a retreat centre called Emmaus Centre.\n\n'''Schools'''\n\n''Primary''\n*Arima Hindu Primary School\n*Arima Boys' Government Primary School\n*Arima Boys' R.C.

<!-- Infobox ends -->\n\n'''Arima''', officially '''The Royal Chartered Borough of Arima''' is the easternmost and second largest in area of the three boroughs of [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. It is geographically adjacent to [[Sangre Grande]] and [[Arouca, Trinidad and Tobago|Arouca]] at the southcentral foothills of the [[Northern Range]]. To the south is the [[Caroni\u2013Arena Dam]]. Coterminous with '''Town of Arima''' since 1888, the borough of Arima is the fourth-largest municipality in population in the country (after [[Port of Spain]], [[Chaguanas]] and [[San Fernando, Trinidad and Tobago|San Fernando]]). The census estimated it had 33,606 residents in 2011.<ref name=\"2011census\">{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.tt/sites/default/files/story/2011_DemographicReport.pdf|title=Trinidad and Tobago 2011 Census|publisher=Ministry of Planning and Sustainable Development|date=30 November 2012|access-date=15 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924042445/http://www.guardian.co.tt/sites/default/files/story/2011_DemographicReport.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nIn 1887, the town petitioned [[Queen Victoria]] for municipal status as part of her [[Golden Jubilee]] celebration. This was granted in the following year, and Arima became a Royal Borough on 1 August 1888.  Historically the third-largest town of Trinidad and Tobago, Arima is fourth since [[Chaguanas]] became the largest town in the country.\n\n==Geography==\n=== Climate ===\nThe borough has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Af''), bordering on a [[tropical monsoon climate]], characterised with little seasonal variations due to its close proximity to the [[Northern Range]]. Temperatures typically range from 19 to 33 degrees. The wet season lasts from June to November, and although there is no true dry season, there is a noticeably drier stretch from January to April.<ref>[https://en.climate-data.org/north-america/trinidad-and-tobago/arima/arima-46245/], Climate Baracoa, Climate-Data.org</ref> Hail has occurred in the town but is rare.\n\n==Culture and entertainment==\n[[File:ArimaDial.png|thumbnail|right|alt=Broadway, Arima.]] \nArima hosts an annual Borough Day anniversary celebration in August. The celebration incorporates Carnival-style street parades and usually coincides with the staging of the Santa Rosa Carib Community annual festival. The annual Arima Carnival includes street parades of masqueraders on Carnival Tuesday, J'ouvert bands on Carnival Monday, as well as a local calypso competition.\n\n==Demographics==\n===Ancestry===\n{{Historical populations\n|title       = Historical populations\n|type        = Trinidad and Tobago\n|align       = right\n|width       = 20%;\n|state       = \n|shading     = \n|percentages = \n|footnote    =\n|1980 |24112\n|1990 |26528\n|2000 |28310\n|2011 |33606\n}}\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable collapsible\" style=\"font-size: 90%;\"\n|+ '''Borough of Arima racial breakdown'''\n|-\n!

Among other important routes are the Arima Bypass, Cocorite Street, Tumpuna Road and O'Meara Road which links neighbourhoods around the town to the Town Center.\n\n===Transit===\nArima plays an important role for north-eastern Trinidad as a multi-modal transportation hub for many of the towns and neighbourhoods on the eastern side of the island. A bus terminal provides service by the [[Public Transport Service Corporation|PTSC Bus]] network to [[Sangre Grande]], Mundo Nuevo, [[Blanchisseuse]], Carapo, [[Malabar, Trinidad and Tobago|Malabar]], Morne La Croix, [[La Horquetta]], Brasso Seco and to the capital [[Port of Spain]]. \n\n[[Maxi taxi]]s (private, owner-operated minibuses) operate throughout [[Trinidad and Tobago]] as a kind of semi-public transport. They operate along fixed routes, have fixed fares and meeting points, but do not operate under a fixed schedule. These [[maxi taxi]]s  provide services from the town center to [[Port of Spain]] via the [[Priority Bus Route]] and [[Churchill-Roosevelt Highway]], making stops along the [[East\u2013West Corridor]]. They also provide transport to [[Sangre Grande]].\n\n== Sports ==\n\nThe major national super-league team, FC Santa Rosa and Arima Football League, which is based at the [[Arima Velodrome]].\n\nAbilene Wildcats Athletic Club, Trinity College East Athletics Club, Silver Bullets Athletic Club, D'Abadie Progressive Athletic Club, and Spartans High Speed Performance Athletic Club are also based in Arima.\n\nMost suburbs, communities and neighbourhoods around the Borough have their own sporting complexes and community swimming pools.\n\nThe three (3) major sporting arenas in Arima are:\n\n*[[Larry Gomes Stadium|The Larry Gomes Stadium]]\n*[[Arima Velodrome]]\n*Santa Rosa Race Track                                                                                                                                                                  Sunil Narine is the only West Indies cricket player to be born in Arima.\n\n== Attractions ==\n*[[Asa Wright Nature Centre]], located in Arima Valley, it has a nature walk and swimming at a freshwater pond.\n\n*[[Santa Rosa First Peoples Community|Santa Rosa Carib]] Centre, located on Paul Mitchell Road, off De Gannes Street in Arima, it contains items from Arima's native Carib history. It also has displays about Carib descendants in Arima. Native items are also available for purchase.\n\n*Cleaver Woods, it has nature walks and [[Amerindian]] exhibits.\n\n===Utilities===\n\nElectric generation is handled by [[Powergen]], while electrical distribution is handled by the [[Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission]] (T&TEC). Powergen has natural gas fired generation plants at Point Lisas, Penal, and Wrightson Road in Port of Spain. Additional power can be supplied from power generation facilities controlled by Inncogen at Point Lisas.\n\nTelecommunications are regulated by the Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (TATT). It has been working to break up the monopoly, granting several new licences in 2005 to new companies in the market. Fixed-line telephone service is a monopoly controlled by Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago (TSTT). Licenses have been granted for competition in this area, but start-up is a while away. Wireless telephony is controlled by TSTT and bmobile, as well as [[Digicel]], which came later. Licenses have been granted for a private company, Laqtel, to offer wireless service in competition with TSTT and Digicel. However, Laqtel had its licence revoked, and is undergoing severe financial difficulties.\n\nDigital cable television is provided by Flow. High-speed internet service of up to 100Mbit/s and digital landline telephone service are all available in Arima.\n\nWater and sewerage are under the purview of the Water and Sewerage Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (WASA).\n\n==Education==\nThere are several primary (private and public) and secondary educational institutions in Arima, and some post-secondary level technical training institutes. St. Joseph's Convent in Arima was closed many years ago and the building now houses a retreat centre called Emmaus Centre.\n\n'''Schools'''\n\n''Primary''\n*Arima Hindu Primary School\n*Arima Boys' Government Primary School\n*Arima Boys' R.C.

[[rights]], including the right to participate in [[political process]]es, and the right to employment in the [[civil service]] and [[private sector]]. The majority of them were born or lived almost their entire lives in Latvia. Non-citizens also have restrictions on [[property]] [[ownership]].<ref name=\"amnesty2009\">{{cite web |url=http://report2009.amnesty.org/en/regions/europe-central-asia/latvia |title=Amnesty International Report 2009 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-06-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610075623/http://report2009.amnesty.org/en/regions/europe-central-asia/latvia |archivedate=2009-06-10 }}</ref>\n\nAmnesty International reported racially motivated attacks against [[Romani people]]. Latvia lacks of comprehensive national [[legislation]] dealing with all forms of [[discrimination]].

There were reported allegations of deliberate physical [[ill-treatment]] of [[detainee]]s by [[prison]] staff.<ref name=\"amnesty2009\"/>\n\n===Human Rights Watch===\n[[Human Rights Watch]] reported in 2006 the attacks on peaceful lesbian and gay pride activists in Riga on July 28.

Also [[political rights]] are in a high level, though the country suffered high-profile corruption scandals during 2007. The government generally respects [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of press]], and [[freedom of religion]]. [[Academic freedom]] is respected in law and in practice. [[Freedom of assembly]] and [[Freedom of association|association]] are protected by law and in practice.<ref name=\"freedomhouse1\"/> The highly competitive Latvian mass media are proving to be reliable sources of information and watchdogs against governmental [[abuses of power]].<ref name=\"freedomhouse2\"/>\n\nWhile the constitutional guarantee of [[judicial independence]] is generally respected, corruption in the judicial and [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] systems continues to be a problem. Pretrial detentions are long, police use [[excessive force]] against detainees, and prisons suffer from overcrowding and inadequate medical care. Women enjoy the same legal rights as men, but they often face employment discrimination.<ref name=\"freedomhouse1\"/>\n\nAlleged discrimination suffered by the Russian-speaking community continues to be debated. Parliament has appointed an [[ombudsman]] responsible for protecting the rights of individuals in relation to the government. Two men were sentenced to prison terms in January 2007 for attacking a [[Rwanda]]n citizen. The case marked the first sentencing under a law prohibiting instigation of racial hatred.<ref name=\"freedomhouse1\"/>\n\n===United States Department of State===\nAccording to Human Right Report of [[United States Department of State]], Latvia generally respects the human rights of citizens and the large resident noncitizen community. However, there were problems with serious police abuse of detainees and arrestees, poor conditions at police [[detention facilities]], poor prison conditions and overcrowding, [[judicial corruption]], obstacles to [[due process]], official pressure to limit [[freedom of speech]], [[violence against women]], [[child abuse]], [[human trafficking|trafficking]] in persons, incidents of violence against ethnic minorities, and [[societal]] violence and incidents of government discrimination against homosexuals.<ref name=\"departmentofstate1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eur/119087.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226175739/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eur/119087.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-02-26 |title=2008 Human Rights Report: Latvia |publisher= [[United States Department of State]] |date=2009-02-25 |accessdate=2009-06-09}}</ref>\n\n==Specific issues of Latvia==\n{{Main|Non-citizens (Latvia)|Language policy in Latvia}}\nAfter restoration of independence in 1991, many residents of Latvia weren't acknowledged to be its citizens. As at January 2011, so-called non-citizens (more than by 99%\u2014representatives of the ethnic minorities, mostly Russians) exceed 14% of the population. Russian language, being native for more than 37% of residents according to 2000 census, is considered to be foreign language in the Official Language Law; the possibilities to use it in communication with authorities and in public education were significantly reduced after 1991.\n\nLike in many post-socialist countries, a restitution of real estate has taken place in Latvia. Therefore, a considerable part of former tenants of public housing found themselves in private housing, with higher rent. [[Rent control]] for such dwellings was, after multiple extensions, phased out in 2007.\n\nSince 2003, conflicts concerning freedom of assembly are often: on various occasions, gatherings of LGBT<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.apollo.lv/portal/news/articles/78494 |title=Neat\u013cauj r\u012bkot g\u0101jienu \u00abR\u012bgas praids 2006\u00bb |access-date=2009-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717113043/http://www.apollo.lv/portal/news/articles/78494 |archive-date=2011-07-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and counter-meetings,<ref>[http://www.delna.lv/index.php?q=ful&sec=140&story=1320 Jaunupu sauc pie atbild\u012bbas, Ulmi \u2013 ne]</ref> commemorations of Latvian Legion of SS soldiers<ref>[http://www.humanrights.org.lv/upload_file/Parskats2004_lv.pdf Cilv\u0113kties\u012bbas Latvij\u0101 2004. g.]\u2014R\u012bga: LCESC, 2005. {{ISBN|9984-9707-7-9}}.\u201435. lpp. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117221424/http://www.humanrights.org.lv/upload_file/Parskats2004_lv.pdf |date=January 17, 2009 }}</ref> and counter-meetings,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.d-pils.lv/news/2/296464 |title=\u0410\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0444\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0430\u0442 \u0432\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438 |access-date=2009-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720015536/http://www.d-pils.lv/news/2/296464 |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> meetings of the [[Russian School Defense Staff]]<ref>[http://www.humanrights.org.lv/upload_file/Parskats2004_lv.pdf Cilv\u0113kties\u012bbas Latvij\u0101 2004. g.]\u2014R\u012bga: LCESC, 2005. {{ISBN|9984-9707-7-9}}.\u201434.\u201435. lpp. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117221424/http://www.humanrights.org.lv/upload_file/Parskats2004_lv.pdf |date=January 17, 2009 }}</ref> were banned or limited.\n\nLimitations to eligibility and their enforcement were in the focus of several ECtHR judgments in cases against Latvia (''[[\u0100damsons v.

[[rights]], including the right to participate in [[political process]]es, and the right to employment in the [[civil service]] and [[private sector]]. The majority of them were born or lived almost their entire lives in Latvia. Non-citizens also have restrictions on [[property]] [[ownership]].<ref name=\"amnesty2009\">{{cite web |url=http://report2009.amnesty.org/en/regions/europe-central-asia/latvia |title=Amnesty International Report 2009 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-06-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610075623/http://report2009.amnesty.org/en/regions/europe-central-asia/latvia |archivedate=2009-06-10 }}</ref>\n\nAmnesty International reported racially motivated attacks against [[Romani people]].

Also [[political rights]] are in a high level, though the country suffered high-profile corruption scandals during 2007. The government generally respects [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of press]], and [[freedom of religion]]. [[Academic freedom]] is respected in law and in practice. [[Freedom of assembly]] and [[Freedom of association|association]] are protected by law and in practice.<ref name=\"freedomhouse1\"/> The highly competitive Latvian mass media are proving to be reliable sources of information and watchdogs against governmental [[abuses of power]].<ref name=\"freedomhouse2\"/>\n\nWhile the constitutional guarantee of [[judicial independence]] is generally respected, corruption in the judicial and [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] systems continues to be a problem. Pretrial detentions are long, police use [[excessive force]] against detainees, and prisons suffer from overcrowding and inadequate medical care. Women enjoy the same legal rights as men, but they often face employment discrimination.<ref name=\"freedomhouse1\"/>\n\nAlleged discrimination suffered by the Russian-speaking community continues to be debated. Parliament has appointed an [[ombudsman]] responsible for protecting the rights of individuals in relation to the government. Two men were sentenced to prison terms in January 2007 for attacking a [[Rwanda]]n citizen. The case marked the first sentencing under a law prohibiting instigation of racial hatred.<ref name=\"freedomhouse1\"/>\n\n===United States Department of State===\nAccording to Human Right Report of [[United States Department of State]], Latvia generally respects the human rights of citizens and the large resident noncitizen community. However, there were problems with serious police abuse of detainees and arrestees, poor conditions at police [[detention facilities]], poor prison conditions and overcrowding, [[judicial corruption]], obstacles to [[due process]], official pressure to limit [[freedom of speech]], [[violence against women]], [[child abuse]], [[human trafficking|trafficking]] in persons, incidents of violence against ethnic minorities, and [[societal]] violence and incidents of government discrimination against homosexuals.<ref name=\"departmentofstate1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eur/119087.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226175739/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eur/119087.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-02-26 |title=2008 Human Rights Report: Latvia |publisher= [[United States Department of State]] |date=2009-02-25 |accessdate=2009-06-09}}</ref>\n\n==Specific issues of Latvia==\n{{Main|Non-citizens (Latvia)|Language policy in Latvia}}\nAfter restoration of independence in 1991, many residents of Latvia weren't acknowledged to be its citizens. As at January 2011, so-called non-citizens (more than by 99%\u2014representatives of the ethnic minorities, mostly Russians) exceed 14% of the population. Russian language, being native for more than 37% of residents according to 2000 census, is considered to be foreign language in the Official Language Law; the possibilities to use it in communication with authorities and in public education were significantly reduced after 1991.\n\nLike in many post-socialist countries, a restitution of real estate has taken place in Latvia. Therefore, a considerable part of former tenants of public housing found themselves in private housing, with higher rent. [[Rent control]] for such dwellings was, after multiple extensions, phased out in 2007.\n\nSince 2003, conflicts concerning freedom of assembly are often: on various occasions, gatherings of LGBT<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.apollo.lv/portal/news/articles/78494 |title=Neat\u013cauj r\u012bkot g\u0101jienu \u00abR\u012bgas praids 2006\u00bb |access-date=2009-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717113043/http://www.apollo.lv/portal/news/articles/78494 |archive-date=2011-07-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and counter-meetings,<ref>[http://www.delna.lv/index.php?q=ful&sec=140&story=1320 Jaunupu sauc pie atbild\u012bbas, Ulmi \u2013 ne]</ref> commemorations of Latvian Legion of SS soldiers<ref>[http://www.humanrights.org.lv/upload_file/Parskats2004_lv.pdf Cilv\u0113kties\u012bbas Latvij\u0101 2004. g.]\u2014R\u012bga: LCESC, 2005. {{ISBN|9984-9707-7-9}}.\u201435. lpp. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117221424/http://www.humanrights.org.lv/upload_file/Parskats2004_lv.pdf |date=January 17, 2009 }}</ref> and counter-meetings,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.d-pils.lv/news/2/296464 |title=\u0410\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0444\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0430\u0442 \u0432\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438 |access-date=2009-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720015536/http://www.d-pils.lv/news/2/296464 |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> meetings of the [[Russian School Defense Staff]]<ref>[http://www.humanrights.org.lv/upload_file/Parskats2004_lv.pdf Cilv\u0113kties\u012bbas Latvij\u0101 2004. g.]\u2014R\u012bga: LCESC, 2005. {{ISBN|9984-9707-7-9}}.\u201434.\u201435. lpp. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117221424/http://www.humanrights.org.lv/upload_file/Parskats2004_lv.pdf |date=January 17, 2009 }}</ref> were banned or limited.\n\nLimitations to eligibility and their enforcement were in the focus of several ECtHR judgments in cases against Latvia (''[[\u0100damsons v.

Some countries use a quota system, whereby a certain percentage of government jobs, political positions, and school vacancies must be reserved for members of a certain group; an example of this is the [[Reservation in India|reservation system in India]].\n\nIn some other regions where quotas are not used, minority group members are given preference or special consideration in selection processes. In the United States, affirmative action in employment and education has been the subject of legal and political controversy. In 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], in ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]],'' held that the [[University of Michigan Law School]] could consider race as a plus-factor when evaluating applicants holistically and maintained the prohibition on the use of quotas.<ref name=\"Supct.law.cornell.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://supct.law.cornell.edu/supct/03highlts.html#2 |title=Highlights of the 2002\u20132003 Supreme Court Term |publisher=Supct.law.cornell.edu |accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref><ref>Melvin  I Urofsky,   ''The Affirmative Action Puzzle: A Living History From Reconstruction to Today'' (2020)</ref>\n\nIn the UK, hiring someone simply because of their protected group status, without regard to their performance, is illegal.<ref name=\"cre\" /><ref name=\"govuk\">{{cite web|title=Types of discrimination'|url=https://www.gov.uk/discrimination-your-rights/types-of-discrimination|work=Discrimination: your rights|publisher=GOV.UK|accessdate=7 April 2013|author=GOV.UK|authorlink=Gov.uk|date=4 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"personneltoday.com\">Personneltoday.com [http://www.personneltoday.com/Articles/2006/01/17/33430/is-there-a-case-for-positive-discrimination.html \"Is there a case for positive discrimination?\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105095039/http://www.personneltoday.com/Articles/2006/01/17/33430/is-there-a-case-for-positive-discrimination.html |date=5 January 2008 }}</ref> However, the law in the UK does allow for membership in a protected and disadvantaged group to be considered in hiring and promotion in the event that that group is under-represented in a given area and if the candidates are of equal merit.

Kurtulus (2012) in her review of affirmative action and the occupational advancement of minorities and women during 1973\u20132003 showed that the effect of affirmative action on advancing black, Hispanic, and white women into management, professional, and technical occupations occurred primarily during the 1970s and early 1980s. During this period, contractors grew their shares of these groups more rapidly than noncontractors because of the implementation of affirmative action. But the positive effect of affirmative action vanished entirely in the late 1980s, which Kurtulus says may be due to the slowdown into advanced occupation for women and minorities because of the political shift of affirmative action that started by President Reagan. Becoming a federal contractor increased white women's share of professional occupations by 0.183 percentage points, or 7.3 percent, on average during these three decades, and increased black women's share by 0.052 percentage points (or by 3.9 percent). Becoming a federal contractor also increased Hispanic women's and black men's share of technical occupations on average by 0.058 percent and 0.109 percentage points respectively (or by 7.7 and 4.2 percent). These represent a substantial contribution of affirmative action to overall trends in the occupational advancement of women and minorities over the three decades under the study.<ref>Fidan Ana Kurtulus, \"Affirmative Action and the Occupational Advancement of Minorities and Women During 1973\u20132003,\" ''Industrial Relations: A Journal of Economy and Society'' (2012) 51#2 pp 213\u2013246.

Caste-based quotas are used in India for [[Reservation in India|reservation]]. However, they are illegal in the United States, where no employer, university, or other entity may create a set number required for each race.\n\nIn 2012, the [[European Union]] Commission approved a plan for women to constitute 40% of non-executive board directorships in large listed companies in Europe by 2020.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The EU's Boardroom Quota Battle Is Over, But Women Cannot Yet Rest |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insead/2012/11/19/the-eus-boardroom-quota-battle-is-over-but-women-cannot-yet-rest/ |magazine=Forbes.com}}</ref> In Sweden, the Supreme Court has ruled that \"affirmative action\" ethnic quotas in universities are discrimination and hence unlawful. It said that the requirements for the intake should be the same for all. The justice minister said that the decision left no room for uncertainty.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.se/20061221/5871 |title=Uppsala discriminated against Swedes |website= The Local |date= 21 December 2006}}</ref>\n\n==National approaches==\n{{See also|Reserved political positions}}\n\nIn some countries that have laws on racial equality, affirmative action is rendered illegal because it does not treat all races equally. This approach of equal treatment is sometimes described as being \"[[Color blindness (race)|color blind]]\", in hopes that it is effective against discrimination without engaging in [[reverse discrimination]].\n\nIn such countries, the focus tends to be on ensuring equal opportunity and, for example, targeted advertising campaigns to encourage ethnic minority candidates to join the police force.

This act was passed to promote the constitutional right of equality and exercise true democracy. This idea was to eliminate unfair discrimination in employment, to ensure the implementation of employment equity to redress the effects of discrimination, to achieve a diverse workforce broadly representative of our people, to promote economic development and efficiency in the workforce and to give effects to the obligations of the Republic as a member of the International Labour Organisation.<ref name=prob/><ref name=aff>{{cite journal |last=Bergmann |first=B. |year=1999 |title=The continuing need for affirmative action.

The act eliminates unfair discrimination in certain sectors of the national labour market by imposing similar constraints on another.<ref name=prob/>\n\nWith the introduction of Affirmative Action, Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) rose additionally in South Africa. The BEE was not a moral initiative to redress the wrongs of the past but to promote growth and strategies that aim to realize a country's full potential. The idea was targeting the weakest link in economics, which was inequality and which would help develop the economy. This is evident in the statement by the Department of Trade and Industry, \"As such, this strategy stresses a BEE process that is associated with growth, development and enterprise development, and not merely the redistribution of existing wealth\".<ref name=info>{{cite web |title=Black economic empowerment.

In the negotiation for status as worthy peers, emphasizing gender signals that a woman is an \"imposter\", someone who does not rightfully belong in the position she is claiming to fill.\" And once affirmative action for women is fulfilled, and then affirmative action shares the element, as Izraeli put it, the \"group equality discourse,\" making it easier for other groups to claim for a fairer distribution of resources.

Successive governments cultivated a historical myth after the colonial powers had left that the British had practised [[communal]] favouritism towards Christians and the minority [[Tamil people|Tamil community]] for the entire 200 years they had controlled [[Sri Lanka]]. However, the Sinhalese in fact benefitted from trade and plantation cultivations over the rest of the other groups and their language and culture as well as the religion of Buddhism was fostered and made into mediums for schools over the Tamil language, which did not have the same treatment and Tamils learned English instead as there was no medium for Tamil until near independence. Tamils' knowledge of English and education came from the very American missionary activity by overseas Christians that the British were concerned will anger the Sinhalese and destroy their trading relationships, so they sent them to the Tamil areas instead to teach, thinking it would have no consequences and due to their small numbers. The British sending the missionaries to the north and east was for the protection of the Sinhalese and in fact showed favouritism to the majority group instead of the minorities to maintain trading relationships and benefits from them. The Tamils, out of this random benefit from learning English and basic education excelled and flourished and were able to take many civil service jobs to the chagrin of the Sinhalese. The myth of Divide and Rule is untrue. The 'policy of standardisation' was typical of affirmative action policies, in that it required drastically lower standards for Sinhalese students than for the more academic Tamils who had to get about ten more marks to enter into universities. The policy, were it not implemented would have prevented the civil wars ahead as the policies had no basis and in fact is an example of discrimination against the Tamil ethnic group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sangam.org/british-divide-rule-ceylon/ |title=Did the British Divide & Rule Ceylon? &#124; Ilankai Tamil Sangam |publisher=Sangam.org |accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Taiwan====\nA 2004 legislation requires that, for a firm with 100 employees or more wishing to compete for government contracts, at least 1 per cent of its employees must be [[Taiwanese aborigines]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://minorityrights.org/minorities/indigenous-peoples-7/|title=Taiwan: Indigenous peoples |website = Minority Rights Group International}}</ref> Ministry of Education and [[Council of Indigenous Peoples|Council of Aboriginal Affairs]] announced in 2002 that Taiwanese Aboriginal students would have their high-school or undergraduate entrance exams boosted by 33% for demonstrating some knowledge of their tribal language and culture.<ref name=\"HolsingerJacob2009\">{{cite book|author1=Donald B.

diversity, and redressing apparent past wrongs, harms, or hindrances.\n\nThe nature of affirmative action policies varies from region to region and exists on a spectrum from a hard quota to merely targeting encouragement for increased participation. Some countries use a quota system, whereby a certain percentage of government jobs, political positions, and school vacancies must be reserved for members of a certain group; an example of this is the [[Reservation in India|reservation system in India]].\n\nIn some other regions where quotas are not used, minority group members are given preference or special consideration in selection processes.

Kurtulus (2012) in her review of affirmative action and the occupational advancement of minorities and women during 1973\u20132003 showed that the effect of affirmative action on advancing black, Hispanic, and white women into management, professional, and technical occupations occurred primarily during the 1970s and early 1980s. During this period, contractors grew their shares of these groups more rapidly than noncontractors because of the implementation of affirmative action. But the positive effect of affirmative action vanished entirely in the late 1980s, which Kurtulus says may be due to the slowdown into advanced occupation for women and minorities because of the political shift of affirmative action that started by President Reagan. Becoming a federal contractor increased white women's share of professional occupations by 0.183 percentage points, or 7.3 percent, on average during these three decades, and increased black women's share by 0.052 percentage points (or by 3.9 percent). Becoming a federal contractor also increased Hispanic women's and black men's share of technical occupations on average by 0.058 percent and 0.109 percentage points respectively (or by 7.7 and 4.2 percent). These represent a substantial contribution of affirmative action to overall trends in the occupational advancement of women and minorities over the three decades under the study.<ref>Fidan Ana Kurtulus, \"Affirmative Action and the Occupational Advancement of Minorities and Women During 1973\u20132003,\" ''Industrial Relations: A Journal of Economy and Society'' (2012) 51#2 pp 213\u2013246.

Caste-based quotas are used in India for [[Reservation in India|reservation]]. However, they are illegal in the United States, where no employer, university, or other entity may create a set number required for each race.\n\nIn 2012, the [[European Union]] Commission approved a plan for women to constitute 40% of non-executive board directorships in large listed companies in Europe by 2020.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The EU's Boardroom Quota Battle Is Over, But Women Cannot Yet Rest |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insead/2012/11/19/the-eus-boardroom-quota-battle-is-over-but-women-cannot-yet-rest/ |magazine=Forbes.com}}</ref> In Sweden, the Supreme Court has ruled that \"affirmative action\" ethnic quotas in universities are discrimination and hence unlawful.

This approach of equal treatment is sometimes described as being \"[[Color blindness (race)|color blind]]\", in hopes that it is effective against discrimination without engaging in [[reverse discrimination]].\n\nIn such countries, the focus tends to be on ensuring equal opportunity and, for example, targeted advertising campaigns to encourage ethnic minority candidates to join the police force.

The designated groups who are to be advanced include all people of colour, women (including white women) and [[people with disabilities]] (including white people).

This act was passed to promote the constitutional right of equality and exercise true democracy.

The BEE was not a moral initiative to redress the wrongs of the past but to promote growth and strategies that aim to realize a country's full potential. The idea was targeting the weakest link in economics, which was inequality and which would help develop the economy. This is evident in the statement by the Department of Trade and Industry, \"As such, this strategy stresses a BEE process that is associated with growth, development and enterprise development, and not merely the redistribution of existing wealth\".<ref name=info>{{cite web |title=Black economic empowerment.

Successive governments cultivated a historical myth after the colonial powers had left that the British had practised [[communal]] favouritism towards Christians and the minority [[Tamil people|Tamil community]] for the entire 200 years they had controlled [[Sri Lanka]]. However, the Sinhalese in fact benefitted from trade and plantation cultivations over the rest of the other groups and their language and culture as well as the religion of Buddhism was fostered and made into mediums for schools over the Tamil language, which did not have the same treatment and Tamils learned English instead as there was no medium for Tamil until near independence. Tamils' knowledge of English and education came from the very American missionary activity by overseas Christians that the British were concerned will anger the Sinhalese and destroy their trading relationships, so they sent them to the Tamil areas instead to teach, thinking it would have no consequences and due to their small numbers. The British sending the missionaries to the north and east was for the protection of the Sinhalese and in fact showed favouritism to the majority group instead of the minorities to maintain trading relationships and benefits from them. The Tamils, out of this random benefit from learning English and basic education excelled and flourished and were able to take many civil service jobs to the chagrin of the Sinhalese. The myth of Divide and Rule is untrue. The 'policy of standardisation' was typical of affirmative action policies, in that it required drastically lower standards for Sinhalese students than for the more academic Tamils who had to get about ten more marks to enter into universities. The policy, were it not implemented would have prevented the civil wars ahead as the policies had no basis and in fact is an example of discrimination against the Tamil ethnic group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sangam.org/british-divide-rule-ceylon/ |title=Did the British Divide & Rule Ceylon? &#124; Ilankai Tamil Sangam |publisher=Sangam.org |accessdate=1 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Taiwan====\nA 2004 legislation requires that, for a firm with 100 employees or more wishing to compete for government contracts, at least 1 per cent of its employees must be [[Taiwanese aborigines]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://minorityrights.org/minorities/indigenous-peoples-7/|title=Taiwan: Indigenous peoples |website = Minority Rights Group International}}</ref> Ministry of Education and [[Council of Indigenous Peoples|Council of Aboriginal Affairs]] announced in 2002 that Taiwanese Aboriginal students would have their high-school or undergraduate entrance exams boosted by 33% for demonstrating some knowledge of their tribal language and culture.<ref name=\"HolsingerJacob2009\">{{cite book|author1=Donald B.
