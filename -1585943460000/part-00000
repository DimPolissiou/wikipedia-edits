The number of experience gained is based on various factors including the number of opponents destroyed, killstreak and the amount of XP earned throughout the match. The amount of XP players gain has its own set of rewards. Players gain new ranks at particular XP milestones which publicly represent their level of skill, dedication, and time playing the game.\n\nPlayers can also buy X Crystals. X Crystals are a premium currency, which is bought with real world money, and unlocks special skins, graffiti, special shell colors for turret ammo, paints for tanks and containers for module blueprints. X crystals can also be earned by completing missions and entering certain promo codes.\n\n=== Ranked Battles ===\nThe ranked battle system is a ranking ladder which organizes players using RP (reputation points), which are rewarded or lost at the end of a completed battle. These points place players within a certain league, depending on how much RP they have. From lowest to highest, there are 5 leagues: Training, Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Masters. Upon entering a league for the first time, the game will grant players with the paint and 5 containers for the corresponding league. Every 2 months, the league system enters a new season. At that time, the game will award players with crystals, x crystals, and league containers for the league they ended the season in.

The town's name was known as Danlog, taken from the name of a local river.  The change of name to [[Barcelona]] was recommended by a Spanish official who saw some similarities with Barcelona, [[Catalonia]] (Spain).  On April 16, 1886, it became a pueblo civil.  Until 1868, it was part of the parish of St. James the Great of Bulusan.  After 1868, it took St. Joseph as its patron saint and celebrates their town fiesta on May 19.<ref>Page 407 (Cristina D.

The town's name was known as Danlog, taken from the name of a local river.  The change of name to [[Barcelona]] was recommended by a Spanish official who saw some similarities with Barcelona, [[Catalonia]] (Spain).  On April 16, 1886, it became a pueblo civil.  Until 1868, it was part of the parish of St. James the Great of Bulusan.  After 1868, it took St. Joseph as its patron saint and celebrates their town fiesta on May 19.<ref>Page 407 (Cristina D.

This system increases reliability, because if one shuttle system fails or is closed for maintenance, the other system may continue to operate.<ref name=\"configurations\"/> This configuration is designed for system lengths up to 3&nbsp;km (1.8&nbsp;mi) and may have several intermediate stations.<ref name=\"configurations\"/>\n\nThe frequency and passenger capacity of both shuttle systems depends largely on the length of the system, and the number of intermediate stations. The passenger capacity additionally depends on the capacity of the train.\n\n=== Bypass system ===\n[[File:MA guideway01.jpg|thumb|The underside of a train]]\nIn this system, only one guideway enters each end station, but movable switches direct trains onto dual tracks between stations so they can pass one another en route.<ref name=\"configurations\"/> The bypass must be located approximately in the middle of two terminal end stations, and can form part of an intermediate station. This configuration is comparable to the Double Shuttle system in terms of capacity and frequency (headway). Either each train has its own haul rope or both trains are attached to the same haul rope depending on the application requirements (station configuration, system length, etc.).<ref name=\"configurations\"/>\n\n=== Pinched Loop system ===\nThis system creates a circular train flow  where more than one train moves in the same direction. The principle of this system is based on several rope loops which adjoin and overlap each other in the stations. Every haul rope loop is supplied with its own drive and return machinery.<ref name=\"configurations\"/> In every station each vehicle of the train has to be disconnected from the current haul rope to the next haul rope in order to continue the circular and synchronized train flow. The haul rope loop change may occur only when all the trains are positioned at the standard stop position in the stations and are standstill and will be carried out during boarding/alighting of the passengers.<ref name=\"configurations\"/> Switches installed at the end stations will guide the train from one lane of the double lane track over to a single guideway in the end stations. During the station stop the switch will be repositioned that the train can leave the station at the other lane of the double lane track. For the functionality of the Pinched Loop concept the stations spans have to be approximately equidistant from each other.<ref name=\"configurations\"/>\n\n== Installations ==\n[[File:Hamad International Airport Suttle 1.jpg|thumb|Hamad International Airport Shuttle]]\n* [[Mandalay Bay Tram]] system installed in Las Vegas\n* [[CityCenter Tram]] installed in Las Vegas\n* [[LINK Train]] system installed in [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]]\n* [[AirRail Link]] system at Birmingham International Airport\n* [[Aerotren]] system at Mexico International Airport\n* [[People Mover (Venice)|People Mover]] in Venice\n* [[Cabletren Bolivariano]] system installed in Caracas\n* [[Coliseum\u2013Oakland International Airport line|BART to OAK Airport]], connecting the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] system to [[Oakland International Airport]]\n* [[Automated Passenger Transportation System (Sheremetyevo)|Automated Passenger Transportation System]] (APTS) at [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]]<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Doppelmayr Cable Liner at Moscow airport serves the World Cup |url= http://newsroom.doppelmayr.com/en/doppelmayr/press/doppelmayr-cable-liner-at-moscow-airport-serves-the-world-cup/ |publisher=Doppelmayr Group |date=2018-06-25 |access-date=2018-07-22}} </ref>\n* [[Hamad International Airport]] Suttle installed in [[Doha]]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cable car (railway)]]\n*[[Funicular]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=note}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.dcc.at DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car]\n\n[[Category:Cable Liner people movers| Cable Liner]]\n", "text_old": "{{Advert|date=August 2010}}\n[[File:Oakland Airport Connector cable car crossing Airport Access Road, March 2018.JPG|thumb|right|The system at Oakland International Airport]]\n{{multiple image\n|direction=horizontal\n|total_width=230\n|image1=Birmingham airport people mover.jpg\n|image2=Bham3.jpg\n|footer=The Birmingham Airport system, showing how it is built on the old Maglev guideway\n}}\nThe '''Cable Liner''' and '''Cable Liner Shuttle''' is a range of [[automated people mover]] products designed by [[Doppelmayr Cable Car]] for use at [[airports]], in [[city center]]s, [[intermodal passenger transport]] connections, [[park and ride]] facilities, campuses, resorts and [[amusement parks]].\n\nThe design is notable for superseding the [[maglev]] transport system at [[Birmingham International Airport (United Kingdom)|Birmingham International Airport]] which was, at the time, the world\u2019s only commercial maglev system.

It distributes [[electricity]] to around 738,000 customers across Queensland, excluding [[South East Queensland]] through a distribution network regulated by the Australian Energy Regulator (AER) who set the prices that Ergon is allowed to charge for distribution.\n\nErgon Energy became a subsidiary of EQL on 1 July 2016. Ergon was formed in 1999 by the Queensland Government, from the then six regional Queensland electricity distributors and their subsidiary retailers. In 2007 the Queensland Government sold approximately 50,000 contestable electricity customers and retailer trading activities to [[AGL Energy|AGL]]. Smaller electricity customers which are not economic continue to be billed by Ergon Energy and the electricity distribution network remains in public ownership.\n\nToday the principal operating companies are Ergon Energy Corporation Limited, as the electricity distributor, and its subsidiary Ergon Energy Queensland Pty Ltd, the electricity retailer. Ergon Energy\u2019s retailer is only permitted, by legislation, to sell electricity at the Queensland Government\u2019s Notified Prices (overseen by the Australia Energy Regulator (AER)), enabling Queenslanders to access the same uniform electricity tariffs.\n\nThe electricity generation and distribution network consists of approximately 207,000 kilometres of powerlines and one million power poles, along with associated infrastructure such as major substations and power transformers. Ergon Energy also owns and operates 33 stand-alone power stations that provide supply to communities across Queensland which are not connected to the main electricity grid.

Kimba was born in 1926 in [[Katanga Province]], [[Belgian Congo]]. Following the completion of his studies he worked as a journalist and became editor-in-chief of the ''Essor du Congo''. In 1958 he and a group of Katangese concerned about domination of their province by people from the neighbouring [[Kasa\u00ef region]] founded the [[CONAKAT|Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des associations tribales du Katanga]] (CONAKAT), a regionalist political party. In 1960 the Congo became independent and shortly thereafter [[Moise Tshombe]] declared the secession of the [[State of Katanga]]. Kimba played an active role in the separatist state's government as its Minister of Foreign Affairs and participated in numerous talks with the central government aimed at political reconciliation. Following the collapse of the secession in early 1963, Kimba had a falling out with Tshombe and took up several ministerial posts in the new province of South Katanga.\n\nTshombe was later made Prime Minister of the Congo while Kimba joined the [[Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga]] (BALUBAKAT) party. On 13 October 1965 [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]] [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] dismissed Tshombe and appointed Kimba Prime Minister. Kimba formed a [[government of national unity]] and spent the following weeks attempting to achieve [[rapprochement]] between the Congo and other African states. However, his government failed to obtain a [[vote of confidence]] from [[Parliament of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Parliament]], though Kasa-Vubu reappointed Kimba to the premiership in the face of determined opposition from Tshombe's supporters. On 25 November Army Commander-in-Chief [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]] launched a coup removing both him and Kasa-Vubu from power and assumed control of the presidency. In May 1966 Mobutu's government accused Kimba of plotting with three other former government ministers to launch a coup. He was executed on 2 June for treason.\n\n==Early life==\n\u00c9variste Kimba was born on 16 July 1926 in the village of Nsaka, [[Bukama Territory]], [[Katanga Province]], [[Belgian Congo]].<ref name= nyt/>{{sfn|Gerard-Libois|Verhaegen|2015|p=353}} Ethnically, he was a member of [[Luba people|Luba]] tribe.<ref name= link>{{cite news| title = Congo: Kasavubu Acts| newspaper = Link| volume = 8| page = 28| date = 1965| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CDZWAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> His father was a railway worker.

and [[Prime Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Prime Minister]] of the [[Republic of the Congo (L\u00e9opoldville)|Democratic Republic of the Congo]] from 13 October to 25 November 1965. Kimba was born in 1926 in [[Katanga Province]], [[Belgian Congo]]. Following the completion of his studies he worked as a journalist and became editor-in-chief of the ''Essor du Congo''. In 1958 he and a group of Katangese concerned about domination of their province by people from the neighbouring [[Kasa\u00ef region]] founded the [[CONAKAT|Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration des associations tribales du Katanga]] (CONAKAT), a regionalist political party. In 1960 the Congo became independent and shortly thereafter [[Moise Tshombe]] declared the secession of the [[State of Katanga]]. Kimba played an active role in the separatist state's government as its Minister of Foreign Affairs and participated in numerous talks with the central government aimed at political reconciliation. Following the collapse of the secession in early 1963, Kimba had a falling out with Tshombe and took up several ministerial posts in the new province of South Katanga.\n\nTshombe was later made Prime Minister of the Congo while Kimba joined the Association G\u00e9n\u00e9rale des Baluba du Katanga (BALUBAKAT) party. On 13 October 1965 [[President of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|President]] [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] dismissed Tshombe and appointed Kimba Prime Minister. Kimba formed a [[government of national unity]] and spent the following weeks attempting to achieve [[rapprochement]] between the Congo and other African states. However, his government failed to obtain a [[vote of confidence]] from [[Parliament of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Parliament]], though Kasa-Vubu reappointed Kimba to the premiership in the face of determined opposition from Tshombe's supporters. On 25 November Army Commander-in-Chief [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]] launched a coup removing both him and Kasa-Vubu from power and assumed control of the presidency. In May 1966 Mobutu's government accused Kimba of plotting with three other former government ministers to launch a coup. He was executed on 2 June for treason.\n\n==Early life==\n\u00c9variste Kimba was born on 16 July 1926 in the village of Nsaka, [[Bukama Territory]], [[Katanga Province]], [[Belgian Congo]].<ref name= nyt/>{{sfn|Gerard-Libois|Verhaegen|2015|p=353}} Ethnically, he was a member of [[Luba people|Luba]] tribe.<ref name= link>{{cite news| title = Congo: Kasavubu Acts| newspaper = Link| volume = 8| page = 28| date = 1965| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CDZWAAAAYAAJ}}</ref> His father was a railway worker.

Kasa-Vubu also hoped that by appointing another Katangese to the post, he would avoid aggravating persisting secessionist sentiment in Katanga.<ref name= link/> Kimba's government was installed on 18 October,<ref>{{cite news| title = Kasavubu Installs New Congo Regime| newspaper = The New York Times| page = 12| date = 19 October 1965}}</ref> representing 16 of the 39 political parties with members in Parliament.{{sfn|Young|Turner|1985|p=51}}\n\nKimba's government was markedly less amicable towards Belgian interests than Tshombe's administration and more nationalistic,{{sfn|Gibbs|1991|p=162}} and aimed to curb Western influence in Congolese affairs.<ref name =AfricanWorld/> The new cabinet sought to improve the Congo's relations with active countries in the [[Organisation of African Unity]] including Ethiopia and Ghana, and to distance itself from the members of the [[African and Malagasy Union|African and Malagasy Common Organisation]].<ref name =AfricanWorld>{{cite news| title = Congo's \"National Unity\" Government: Mr. Tshombe a Likely Candidate for the Presidency| newspaper = African World| page = 15| date = December 1965| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=H4kXAQAAMAAJ}}</ref> The government opened negotiations with [[Republic of the Congo|Congo-Brazzaville]], and on 5 November Kimba announced that in its first step towards rehabilitating the Congo's ties with African states his government was renewing cross-river ferry traffic between Brazzaville and L\u00e9opoldville, which had been suspended for two years.<ref>{{cite news| title = Leopoldville Reopening Ferry to Brazzaville| newspaper = The New York Times| page = 2| date = 6 November 1965}}</ref> The following day he formally reestablished diplomatic relations with Congo-Brazzaville.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=90}}<ref>{{cite news| title = 2 Congos Resumes Ties After 2 Years| newspaper = The New York Times| page = 55| agency = United Press International| date = 7 November 1965}}</ref> He also reopened the Congo-Uganda border, which had been closed since February.{{sfn|O'Ballance|1999|p=90}} Kimba revised the composition of his government on 8 November.{{sfn|Omasombo Tshonda|2018|p=541}}\n\nTshombe's removal from power angered his supporters, and in the following weeks they competed with anti-Tshombe partisans for dominance in Parliament. On 14 November the Kimba Government was presented to the legislature for a formal [[vote of confidence]]. It was defeated, 72 to 76 in the Chamber of Deputies and 49 to 58 in the Senate.{{sfn|Young|Turner|1985|pp=50\u201351}} The next day Kasa-Vubu renominated Kimba as Prime Minister, resulting in a political deadlock.{{sfn|Young|Turner|1985|p=51}} On 25 November, Army Commander-in-Chief [[Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu]], who had previously supported Kimba, launched a coup removing both him and Kasa-Vubu from power and assumed control of the presidency.{{sfn|Young|Turner|1985|p=52}} Colonel [[L\u00e9onard Mulamba]] was appointed to replace Kimba.{{sfn|Omasombo Tshonda|2018|p=542}}\n\n==Arrest and death==\nIn May 1966 Kimba and former government ministers [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Anany]], [[Emmanuel Bamba]], and [[Alexandre Mahamba]] were arrested by Mobutu's security forces while attending a meeting with military officials. They were taken to a military camp and tortured. Mobutu's regime accused them of plotting to assassinate Mobutu and Prime Minister Mulamba and overthrow the government. On 30 May the four men were tried before a [[military tribunal]]. The trial lasted an hour and a half and the accused were allowed no legal counsel.{{sfn|Ikambana|2006|p=56}} They pleaded innocence, claiming that they had been working at the behest of officers in the army. After deliberating for seven minutes, the three military judges found the four men guilty of treason and sentenced them to death.<ref>{{cite news| title = Death Sentence Given 4 Congo Ex-Officials:
