In the first game of the tournament, Bresnan played a limited role, not being required to bat and only bowling 1 over for 7 runs. In the second match of huge tournament he bowled two overs against Ireland, conceding only 5 runs. He was expensive against Pakistan, bowling four overs for 36 runs, but came back well against South Africa, conceding just 14 runs in the three overs he bowled.\n\nHe only took 3 wickets at 52.67, the least of England's front-line bowlers.

In the first two games he took 0\u201349 and in the second 0\u201344. His only wicket came in the fourth match where he took figures of 1\u201352. However, he scored vital runs in England's three victories \u2013 26 in the first game, 12 not out in the second and 14 not out in the third game which England won by just 1 wicket. His top score of the series came when he hit 34 in the fifth ODI.\n\nHe was included in the Ashes squad to tour Australia in 2010\u20132011, making his first appearance in the series in the fourth Test at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] in Melbourne. He bowled economically, taking 2/25 off 13 overs in the first innings as Australia were bowled out for just 98. In the second innings, he took the top-order wickets of [[Ricky Ponting]], [[Shane Watson]] and [[Michael Hussey]] before taking the final wicket of [[Ben Hilfenhaus]]. That final wicket saw England win by an innings and 157 runs, take a 2\u20131 lead in the series and therefore retain the Ashes. He continued his capable performance in the final Test in [[Sydney Cricket Ground|Sydney]], ably supporting [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]] and [[Chris Tremlett]] as England clinched a 3\u20131 series win in dominating fashion.\n\nSpinner [[Graeme Swann]] was injured during the ODI series that followed the Ashes, and Anderson was rested for the first three matches.

On 12 October 1926, Chile made the first corner-kick goal in Copa Am\u00e9rica history in a match against [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]].

He followed through on this threat, despite Segovia's election being annulled, and resigned in February 2011. [[Claudio Borghi (football manager)|Claudio Borghi]] then became Chile's manager in March 2011.\n\nAfter a string of bad performances and harsh criticisms, [[Claudio Borghi (football manager)|Claudio Borghi]] stepped down as Chile's manager in November 2012. A new manager, [[Jorge Sampaoli]], was appointed in December 2012.

Together with Argentina, Brazil, and Uruguay, the four competed in the first South American Championship, later to be renamed the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]], in 1916. On 12 October 1926, Chile made the first corner-kick goal in Copa Am\u00e9rica history in a match against [[Bolivia national football team|Bolivia]].

He followed through on this threat, despite Segovia's election being annulled, and resigned in February 2011. [[Claudio Borghi (football manager)|Claudio Borghi]] then became Chile's manager in March 2011.\n\nAfter a string of bad performances and harsh criticisms, [[Claudio Borghi (football manager)|Claudio Borghi]] stepped down as Chile's manager in November 2012. A new manager, [[Jorge Sampaoli]], was appointed in December 2012.

Otherwise you are going to start to allow the bowlers to go round the wicket, over the wicket, and keep swapping during their run-ups.\" Former fast-bowler [[Michael Holding]] argued \"if the batsman can change from being right-handed to left-handed, there shouldn't be a problem with a bowler changing from being right-handed to left-handed, either, without having to tell the umpire, nor should he have to tell the umpire if he is going over or round the wicket.\"<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/355276.html The shots that rang around the world], 2008-06-16, Cricinfo.

[[Ian Healy]] seconded this by saying \"It just should be outlawed straightaway.

Otherwise you are going to start to allow the bowlers to go round the wicket, over the wicket, and keep swapping during their run-ups.\" Former fast-bowler [[Michael Holding]] argued \"if the batsman can change from being right-handed to left-handed, there shouldn't be a problem with a bowler changing from being right-handed to left-handed, either, without having to tell the umpire, nor should he have to tell the umpire if he is going over or round the wicket.\"<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/355276.html The shots that rang around the world], 2008-06-16, Cricinfo.

The win came through the [[Duckworth-Lewis method]] as the Kings were ahead of the par score by 8 runs when returning rain forced to abandon the already 13-over match.<ref>{{cite web|title=Babar, spinners put Karachi on board|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-super-league-2016-17/content/story/1083064.html|website=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=18 February 2017}}</ref> In their final game of the Sharjah leg, the Kings continued their winning streak to get past Peshawar Zalmi in a thrilling contest. Setting up a target of 175, the Kings had the Zalmis reduced to 69-6 before [[Shahid Afridi]] and [[Darren Sammy]] combined in a 70-run partnership that almost won the game for the Zalmis. However, the King's bowling prevailed in the end to give their team a 9-run victory.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mir repels Afridi heroics to secure win for Karachi|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-super-league-2016-17/content/story/1083396.html|website=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=20 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nAs the tournament moved back to [[Dubai]], the Kings couldn't continue their winning streak and lost to table-toppers, Quetta Gladiators, by 6 wickets. Batting first, the Kings set a target of 155 runs, which they were unable to defend despite a 3-wicket-over from pacer [[Sohail Khan (cricketer, born 1984)|Sohail Khan]]. This loss pushed the Karachi Kings to the bottom of the table once again.<ref>{{cite web|title=Clinical Quetta clinch playoff berth with victory|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-super-league-2016-17/content/story/1084045.html|website=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=24 February 2017}}</ref> However, in the next game, which had become a must-win for both participating teams, the Kings managed to prevail over the rivals Lahore Qalandars in a thrilling last-ball finish. Chasing 156, the team required 10 runs from the last two balls, which [[Kieron Pollard]] surpassed with back-to-back sixes to keep his team alive in the tournament.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pollard last-ball six keeps Karachi alive|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-super-league-2016-17/content/story/1084434.html|website=ESPN Cricinfo|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref>\n\nKarachi then had to protect their net run rate in the very next league match, against Islamabad United, to qualify for the eliminator. In a rain-marred game, restricted to 15-overs-a-side, they were set a target of 124 by Islamabad and they had to score at least 111 runs to qualify for the eliminator. Gayle set the tempo through his blitzing knock of 44 off a mere 17 balls. The game was superbly finished by none other than Pollard himself on the second last ball of the match via a boundary. Gayle's knock and Pollard's finishing helped Karachi win this encounter against Islamabad.\n\nConsequently, Karachi again faced Islamabad in the eliminator. In what proved to be a thrilling game, Karachi, batting first, scored a measly 126 getting all out in the process. Islamabad was set to win and qualify for the second play off. However, that was not the case as the second innings proved. The Karachi bowlers outshone the Islamabad bowlers with Muhammad Amir, Imad Wasim and [[Usama Mir]] each picking up three wickets. Islamabad were all out for a mere 82 runs, their lowest in the tournament and the second-lowest in the tournament's history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.espncricinfo.com/pakistan-super-league-2016-17/engine/records/team/lowest_innings_totals.html?id=205;type=trophy|title=Records/Lowest totals/Pakistan Super League|publisher=ESPN cricinfo|accessdate=1 March 2017}}</ref> Hence, the defending champions were knocked out and Karachi lived another day in the tournament and qualified for the second play-off.<ref>{{cite web|title=Islamabad knocked out,Karachi stays in|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/1342968/live-islamabad-opt-bowl-first-karachi-eliminator/|accessdate=1 March 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== 2018 season ===\n\n{{See also|Karachi Kings in 2018}}\n\n[[File:Shahid Afridi at the County Ground, Taunton, during Pakistan's 2010 tour of England - 20100902.jpg|20'0px|thumb|Shahid Afridi joined the team as president and player for 2018.]]\nOn 7 April 2017 [[Shahid Afridi]] joined the team as president and player, and left [[Peshawar Zalmi]].<ref name=ci7apr2017>[http://www.pakistankakhudahafiz.com/news/leaving-zalmi-shahid-afridi-joins-karachi-kings/|title=Leaving Zalmi Shahid Afridi joins Karachi Kings as president], PKKH, 2017-4-6.

There was speculation in the press that he would not be included in the Test team, but when [[Michael Vaughan]] was injured before the first Test, Bell got another opportunity. He took it, scoring a century and two half-centuries in the three-match series, and becoming England's top scorer in the series with 313 runs at an average of 52.16.

He could not maintain this form into the Test series where, in 6 innings, he only scored 131 runs at an average of just under 22.\n\n=== 2006: Sri Lanka and Pakistan ===\nAfter returning from India, Bell had an average start to the season with Warwickshire. He was named in the squad of 13 for the first home Test of the summer, against [[Sri Lanka cricket team|Sri Lanka]], but with the return of [[Marcus Trescothick]], coupled with the good form of [[Paul Collingwood]] and the emergence of [[Alastair Cook]], Bell was dropped from the starting 11. Bell was selected in the squad for the 5 match ODI series against Sri Lanka, and was one of only a couple of players to come through the series with any credit.\n\nAs a result of this, and the injury to [[Andrew Flintoff]], Bell was recalled to the Test team for the first Test against [[Pakistani Cricket Team|Pakistan]]. After spending most of his career batting in the top four, he was asked to bat at number six. He scored a century in each of the first three Tests, becoming the first Englishman since [[Graham Gooch]] to score a century in three successive Test matches, but missed his chance to make it four in a row after scoring only 9 in the first innings and being 9 not out when the fourth Test unexpectedly finished a day early after the Pakistan ball tampering row. He finished the series with an average of 93.75, but surprisingly was not awarded the man-of-the-series award for England, with the honour going to [[Andrew Strauss]] who averaged 63.42. This run of form (100*, 28, 106*, 119, 4, 9, 9*) gave him an overall Test average of almost 48. Given his average against Australia was only 17, his average against all other sides was around 68. He also played in the ODI series against Pakistan, achieving his two highest scores at the time: 88 at [[SWALEC Stadium|Sophia Gardens]] and 86* at [[Trent Bridge]], the latter earning him the man-of-the-match award following England's victory.\n\n=== 2006: Champions Trophy ===\nIn September 2006 Bell was named in the squad for the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy]] in India and also in the squad to tour Australia to attempt to retain the Ashes. In the absence of [[Marcus Trescothick]] he was promoted to open the batting for the one-day side. In England's three matches he scored 97 runs, at an average of 32.33. England lost their first two games (to India and Australia) and crashed out of the tournament despite a final group-stage win over eventual runners-up, West Indies.\n\n=== 2006/07: The Ashes ===\n\n{{Main|English cricket team in Australia in 2006-07}}\n\nComing into [[the Ashes]] series, with [[Andrew Flintoff]] named as captain for the tour and reclaiming his place at number six in the batting order, Bell was viewed as competing with [[Alastair Cook]] and [[Paul Collingwood]] for two places in the starting eleven. However, because [[Marcus Trescothick]] returned to England prior to the first Test, Bell, Cook and Collingwood played in the team throughout the series. Scoring a total of 331 runs, including four half centuries, Bell averaged 33.10 for the series. He failed to convert good starts into big scores, and England suffered a 0 \u2013 5 Test series whitewash. This poor run of results continued into the one-day series: England lost the [[Twenty20 International|Twenty20]] game and the first of the ODI's. However, England squeaked through into the final of the Commonwealth Bank Series, and dispatched Australia in the finals in two straight games, with Bell scoring 65 in the first of them.\n\n=== World Cup 2007 ===\n{{Main|2007 Cricket World Cup}}\n\nBell was selected as part of England's 15-man squad for the world cup in the West Indies. England had a largely disappointing tournament and Bell's performances were typical of the team as a whole. At the start of the tournament he was selected to bat at number three, as England lost to [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] and stuttered to wins over [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]], [[Canadian cricket team|Canada]] and [[Irish cricket team|Ireland]]. Bell suffered an average run of form in these matches, scoring 5, 28, 16 and 31. After defeat to eventual runners up, [[Sri Lankan Cricket Team|Sri Lanka]], a game in which Bell scored 47, England dropped [[Ed Joyce]] from the top of the order and Bell was promoted to open with captain [[Michael Vaughan]]. The change in position initially worked well as Bell scored 77 as England lost to Australia, but in the next two games, against [[Bangladeshi Cricket Team|Bangladesh]] and [[South African cricket team|South Africa]], he only managed scores of 0 and 7, and was dropped for England's final match against the West Indies, a game which England won. England finished fifth in the Super 8 stage of the tournament and failed to qualify for the semi-finals.\n\n=== 2007: West Indies and India ===\nIan Bell scored the fourth of England's hundreds against the West Indies in the first Test at [[Lord's]] in May. Along with [[Alastair Cook]], [[Paul Collingwood]] and [[Matt Prior]], they became the first four batsmen for England since 1938 to each score a century in the same Test match.{{fact|date=August 2019}} Bell's innings came at number 6 in the batting order and after England declared he had the impressive record at that position of 484 runs at 121.00.{{fact|date=August 2019}}\n\nOn 21 August 2007, Bell scored his maiden [[One Day International|ODI]] century in the first of seven one-day matches against [[India national cricket team|India]], scoring 126 runs off 118 balls (a strike rate of 106.8). Bell went on to score two more fifties in the next two games, including a player-of-the-match 79 at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] as England took a 2\u20131 lead in the series. Bell eventually averaged 70.33 for the seven games as England claimed the series 4\u20133, with a convincing 7 wicket win in the deciding match at [[Lord's]], and Bell was named Man of the Series.<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/engvind/engine/current/match/258477.html 7th ODI vs India (Scorecard & Awards)] ESPN Cricinfo, 8 September 2007; Retrieved 9 September 2007</ref>\n\n=== 2007/08: Sri Lanka ===\nTravelling with the team to [[Sri Lanka]] in late September 2007, Bell at first continued his impressive one-day form, scoring 131 from only 121 deliveries, in England's only warm-up match against a [[Sri Lanka Cricket|Sri Lanka Cricket Board XI]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/shared/fds/hi/statistics/cricket/scorecards/2007/9/14133/html/scorecard.stm ''Tour Match: Sri Lanka Cricket XI v England''] BBC Sport; 28 September 2007; Retrieved 28 September 2007</ref> However, Bell struggled with the bat in the subsequent 5-game ODI series, scoring just 70 runs at an average of 14.00.{{fact|date=August 2019}}\n\nBell recovered form in the first Test match, scoring 83 and 74, in vain, as England fell to an 88-run defeat.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/latest_scorecard/default.stm ''Sri Lanka vs England First Test''] BBC Sport; Retrieved 5 December 2007</ref> Sri Lanka won the Test series 1\u20130, after the second and third matches were drawn, and Bell finished the series with a batting average of 43.50.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/averages/default.stm ''Test series in Sri Lanka, averages'']{{failed verification|date=August 2019}} BBC Sport, Retrieved 22 December 2007</ref>\n\n=== 2007/08: New Zealand ===\nBell initially struggled for form as England opened its five-game ODI series against [[New Zealand Cricket Team|New Zealand]] with two heavy defeats, scoring just 5 and 0.{{fact|date=August 2019}} However, under pressure for his place in the side, Bell top-scored in England's win in [[Eden Park|Auckland]] in the third game of the series with 73 runs,{{fact|date=August 2019}} and then made 43 runs from 41 balls{{fact|date=August 2019}} as England tied the fourth match, in [[McLean Park|Napier]].

There was speculation in the press that he would not be included in the Test team, but when [[Michael Vaughan]] was injured before the first Test, Bell got another opportunity. He took it, scoring a century and two half-centuries in the three-match series, and becoming England's top scorer in the series with 313 runs at an average of 52.16.

He could not maintain this form into the Test series where, in 6 innings, he only scored 131 runs at an average of just under 22.\n\n=== 2006: Sri Lanka and Pakistan ===\nAfter returning from India, Bell had an average start to the season with Warwickshire. He was named in the squad of 13 for the first home Test of the summer, against [[Sri Lanka cricket team|Sri Lanka]], but with the return of [[Marcus Trescothick]], coupled with the good form of [[Paul Collingwood]] and the emergence of [[Alastair Cook]], Bell was dropped from the starting 11. Bell was selected in the squad for the 5 match ODI series against Sri Lanka, and was one of only a couple of players to come through the series with any credit.\n\nAs a result of this, and the injury to [[Andrew Flintoff]], Bell was recalled to the Test team for the first Test against [[Pakistani Cricket Team|Pakistan]]. After spending most of his career batting in the top four, he was asked to bat at number six. He scored a century in each of the first three Tests, becoming the first Englishman since [[Graham Gooch]] to score a century in three successive Test matches, but missed his chance to make it four in a row after scoring only 9 in the first innings and being 9 not out when the fourth Test unexpectedly finished a day early after the Pakistan ball tampering row. He finished the series with an average of 93.75, but surprisingly was not awarded the man-of-the-series award for England, with the honour going to [[Andrew Strauss]] who averaged 63.42. This run of form (100*, 28, 106*, 119, 4, 9, 9*) gave him an overall Test average of almost 48. Given his average against Australia was only 17, his average against all other sides was around 68. He also played in the ODI series against Pakistan, achieving his two highest scores at the time: 88 at [[SWALEC Stadium|Sophia Gardens]] and 86* at [[Trent Bridge]], the latter earning him the man-of-the-match award following England's victory.\n\n=== 2006: Champions Trophy ===\nIn September 2006 Bell was named in the squad for the [[2006 ICC Champions Trophy|Champions Trophy]] in India and also in the squad to tour Australia to attempt to retain the Ashes. In the absence of [[Marcus Trescothick]] he was promoted to open the batting for the one-day side. In England's three matches he scored 97 runs, at an average of 32.33. England lost their first two games (to India and Australia) and crashed out of the tournament despite a final group-stage win over eventual runners-up, West Indies.\n\n=== 2006/07: The Ashes ===\n\n{{Main|English cricket team in Australia in 2006-07}}\n\nComing into [[the Ashes]] series, with [[Andrew Flintoff]] named as captain for the tour and reclaiming his place at number six in the batting order, Bell was viewed as competing with [[Alastair Cook]] and [[Paul Collingwood]] for two places in the starting eleven. However, because [[Marcus Trescothick]] returned to England prior to the first Test, Bell, Cook and Collingwood played in the team throughout the series. Scoring a total of 331 runs, including four half centuries, Bell averaged 33.10 for the series. He failed to convert good starts into big scores, and England suffered a 0 \u2013 5 Test series whitewash. This poor run of results continued into the one-day series: England lost the [[Twenty20 International|Twenty20]] game and the first of the ODI's. However, England squeaked through into the final of the Commonwealth Bank Series, and dispatched Australia in the finals in two straight games, with Bell scoring 65 in the first of them.\n\n=== World Cup 2007 ===\n{{Main|2007 Cricket World Cup}}\n\nBell was selected as part of England's 15-man squad for the world cup in the West Indies. England had a largely disappointing tournament and Bell's performances were typical of the team as a whole. At the start of the tournament he was selected to bat at number three, as England lost to [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]] and stuttered to wins over [[Kenyan cricket team|Kenya]], [[Canadian cricket team|Canada]] and [[Irish cricket team|Ireland]]. Bell suffered an average run of form in these matches, scoring 5, 28, 16 and 31. After defeat to eventual runners up, [[Sri Lankan Cricket Team|Sri Lanka]], a game in which Bell scored 47, England dropped [[Ed Joyce]] from the top of the order and Bell was promoted to open with captain [[Michael Vaughan]]. The change in position initially worked well as Bell scored 77 as England lost to Australia, but in the next two games, against [[Bangladeshi Cricket Team|Bangladesh]] and [[South African cricket team|South Africa]], he only managed scores of 0 and 7, and was dropped for England's final match against the West Indies, a game which England won. England finished fifth in the Super 8 stage of the tournament and failed to qualify for the semi-finals.\n\n=== 2007: West Indies and India ===\nIan Bell scored the fourth of England's hundreds against the West Indies in the first Test at [[Lord's]] in May. Along with [[Alastair Cook]], [[Paul Collingwood]] and [[Matt Prior]], they became the first four batsmen for England since 1938 to each score a century in the same Test match.{{fact|date=August 2019}} Bell's innings came at number 6 in the batting order and after England declared he had the impressive record at that position of 484 runs at 121.00.{{fact|date=August 2019}}\n\nOn 21 August 2007, Bell scored his maiden [[One Day International|ODI]] century in the first of seven one-day matches against [[India national cricket team|India]], scoring 126 runs off 118 balls (a strike rate of 106.8). Bell went on to score two more fifties in the next two games, including a player-of-the-match 79 at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] as England took a 2\u20131 lead in the series. Bell eventually averaged 70.33 for the seven games as England claimed the series 4\u20133, with a convincing 7 wicket win in the deciding match at [[Lord's]], and Bell was named Man of the Series.<ref>[http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/engvind/engine/current/match/258477.html 7th ODI vs India (Scorecard & Awards)] ESPN Cricinfo, 8 September 2007; Retrieved 9 September 2007</ref>\n\n=== 2007/08: Sri Lanka ===\nTravelling with the team to [[Sri Lanka]] in late September 2007, Bell at first continued his impressive one-day form, scoring 131 from only 121 deliveries, in England's only warm-up match against a [[Sri Lanka Cricket|Sri Lanka Cricket Board XI]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/shared/fds/hi/statistics/cricket/scorecards/2007/9/14133/html/scorecard.stm ''Tour Match: Sri Lanka Cricket XI v England''] BBC Sport; 28 September 2007; Retrieved 28 September 2007</ref> However, Bell struggled with the bat in the subsequent 5-game ODI series, scoring just 70 runs at an average of 14.00.{{fact|date=August 2019}}\n\nBell recovered form in the first Test match, scoring 83 and 74, in vain, as England fell to an 88-run defeat.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/latest_scorecard/default.stm ''Sri Lanka vs England First Test''] BBC Sport; Retrieved 5 December 2007</ref> Sri Lanka won the Test series 1\u20130, after the second and third matches were drawn, and Bell finished the series with a batting average of 43.50.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/cricket/england/averages/default.stm ''Test series in Sri Lanka, averages'']{{failed verification|date=August 2019}} BBC Sport, Retrieved 22 December 2007</ref>\n\n=== 2007/08: New Zealand ===\nBell initially struggled for form as England opened its five-game ODI series against [[New Zealand Cricket Team|New Zealand]] with two heavy defeats, scoring just 5 and 0.{{fact|date=August 2019}} However, under pressure for his place in the side, Bell top-scored in England's win in [[Eden Park|Auckland]] in the third game of the series with 73 runs,{{fact|date=August 2019}} and then made 43 runs from 41 balls{{fact|date=August 2019}} as England tied the fourth match, in [[McLean Park|Napier]].

Australia also won the 1902 series, which was memorable for exciting cricket, including [[Gilbert Jessop]] scoring a Test century in just 70 minutes. England regained the Ashes in 1904 under the captaincy of [[Pelham Warner]]. [[R. E. Foster]] scored 287 on his debut and [[Wilfred Rhodes]] took 15 wickets in a match. In 1905\u201306, England lost 4\u20131 against South Africa. England avenged the defeat in 1907, when they won the series 1\u20130 under the captaincy of Foster. However, they lost the 1909 Ashes series against Australia, suing 25 players in the process. England also lost to South Africa, with [[Jack Hobbs]] scoring his first of 15 centuries on the tour.\n\n===1910s===\nEngland toured Australia in 1911\u201312 and beat their opponents 4\u20131. The team included the likes of Rhodes, Hobbs, [[Frank Woolley]] and [[Sydney Barnes]]. England lost the first match of the series but bounced back and won the next four Tests. This proved to be the last Ashes series before the war.\n\nThe 1912 season saw England take part in a unique experiment. A nine-Test triangular tournament involving England, South Africa and Australia was set up. The series was hampered by a very wet summer and player disputes however and the tournament was considered a failure with the ''Daily Telegraph'' stating:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ausveng/content/story/260677.html|title=England v Australia 1890&nbsp;\u2013 1914|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=5 February 2008|date=27 September 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008035811/http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ausveng/content/story/260677.html|archive-date=8 October 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Nine Tests provide a surfeit of cricket, and contests between Australia and South Africa are not a great attraction to the British public.}}\n\nWith Australia sending a weakened team and the South African bowlers being ineffective England dominated the tournament winning four of their six matches.

Still feeling the effects of the war England went down to a series of crushing defeats and suffered their first whitewash losing the series 5\u20130. Six Australians scored hundreds while Mailey spun out 36 English batsmen. Things were no better in the next few Ashes series losing the 1921 Ashes series 3\u20130 and the 1924\u201325 Ashes 4\u20131. England's fortunes were to change in 1926 as they regained the Ashes and were a formidable team during this period dispatching Australia 4\u20131 in the 1928\u201329 Ashes tour.\n\nOn the same year the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] became the fourth nation to be granted [[Test cricket#Test status|Test status]] and played their first game against England. England won each of these three Tests by an innings, and a view was expressed in the press that their elevation had proved a mistake although [[Learie Constantine]] did [[Double (cricket)|the double]] on the tour. In the 1929\u201330 season England went on two concurrent tours with one team going to New Zealand (who were granted Test status earlier that year) and the other to the West Indies. Despite sending two separate teams England won both tours beating New Zealand 1\u20130 and the West Indies 2\u20131.\n\n===1930s===\n[[File:4th Test Woodfull.jpg|left|thumb|[[Bill Woodfull]] evades a Bodyline ball. Note the number of leg-side fielders.]]\nThe 1930 Ashes series saw a young [[Don Bradman]] dominate the tour, scoring 974 runs in his seven Test innings. He scored 254 at Lord's, 334 at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] and 232 at [[The Oval]]. Australia regained the Ashes winning the series 3\u20131. As a result of Bradman's prolific run-scoring the England captain [[Douglas Jardine]] chose to develop the already existing [[leg theory]] into fast leg theory, or bodyline, as a tactic to stop Bradman. Fast leg theory involved bowling fast balls directly at the batsman's body. The batsman would need to defend himself, and if he touched the ball with the bat, he risked being caught by one of a large number of fielders placed on the leg side.\n\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 233112 English cricket team at the test match held in Brisbane, 1928.jpg|right|thumb|English cricket team at the Test match held at the [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]]. England won the match by a record margin of 675 runs.]]\nUsing Jardine's fast leg theory, England won the next Ashes series 4\u20131, but complaints about the Bodyline tactic caused crowd disruption on the tour, and threats of diplomatic action from the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Cricket Board]], which during the tour sent the following cable to the MCC in London:\n\n{{quote|Bodyline bowling assumed such proportions as to menace best interests of game, making protection of body by batsmen the main consideration. Causing intensely bitter feeling between players as well as injury. In our opinion is unsportsmanlike. Unless stopped at once likely to upset friendly relations existing between Australia and England.}}\n\nLater, Jardine was removed from the captaincy and the [[Laws of Cricket]] changed so that no more than one fast ball aimed at the body was permitted per over, and having more than two fielders behind square leg was banned.\n\nEngland's following tour of India in the 1933\u201334 season was the first Test match to be staged in the subcontinent. The series was also notable for [[Stan Nichols]] and [[Nobby Clark (cricketer)|Nobby Clark]] bowling so many bouncers that the Indian batsman wore solar toup\u00e9es instead of caps to protect themselves.\n\nAustralia won the 1934 Ashes series 2\u20131 and kept the urn for the following 19 years. Many of the wickets of the time were friendly to batsmen resulting in a large proportion of matches ending in high scoring draws and many batting records being set.\n\nEngland drew the 1938 Ashes, meaning Australia retained the urn. England went into the final match of the series at The Oval 1\u20130 down, but won the final game by an innings and 579 runs. [[Len Hutton]] made the highest ever Test score by an Englishman, making 364 in England first innings to help them reach 903, their highest ever score against Australia.\n\nThe 1938\u201339 tour of South Africa saw another experiment with the deciding Test being a [[timeless Test]] that was played to a finish. England lead 1\u20130 going into the final timeless match at Durban. Despite the final Test being 'timeless', the game ended in a draw after 10 days as England had to catch the train to catch the boat home. A record 1,981 runs were scored, and the concept of timeless Tests was abandoned. England went on one final tour of the West Indies in 1939 before the [[World War II|Second World War]], although a team for an MCC tour of India was selected more in hope than expectation of the matches being played.\n\n===1940s===\nTest cricket resumed after the war in 1946, and England won their first match back against India. However, they struggled in the 1946\u201347 Ashes series, losing 3\u20130 in Australia under [[Wally Hammond]]'s captaincy. England beat South Africa 3\u20130 in 1947 with [[Denis Compton]] scoring 1,187 runs in the series.\n\nThe 1947\u201348 series against the West Indies was another disappointment for England, with the side losing 2\u20130 following injuries to several key players. England suffered further humiliation against Bradman's invincible side in the 1948 Ashes series. Hutton was controversially dropped for the third Test, and England were bowled out for just 52 at The Oval. The series proved to be Bradman's final Ashes series.\n\nIn 1948\u201349, England beat South Africa 2\u20130 under the captaincy of George Mann. The series included a record breaking stand of 359 between Hutton and [[Cyril Washbrook]]. The decade ended with England drawing the Test series against New Zealand, with every match ending in a draw.\n\n===1950s===\nTheir fortunes changed on the 1953 Ashes tour as they won the series 1\u20130. England did not lose a series between their 1950\u201351 and 1958\u201359 tours of Australia and secured famous victory in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1954\u201355|1954\u201355]] under the captaincy of [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]], thanks to [[Frank Tyson]] whose 6/85 at Sydney and 7/27 at Melbourne are remembered as the fastest bowling ever seen in Australia. The 1956 series was remembered for the bowling of [[Jim Laker]] who took 46 wickets at an average of 9.62, including figures of 19/90 at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]]. After drawing to South Africa, England defeated the West Indies and New Zealand comfortably.\n\nThe England team then left for Australia in the 1958\u201359 season with a team that had been hailed as the strongest ever to leave on an Ashes tour but lost the series 4\u20130 as [[Richie Benaud]]'s revitalised Australians were too strong, with England struggling with the bat throughout the series.\n\nOn 24 August 1959, England inflicted its only 5\u20130 whitewash over [[India national cricket team|India]]. All out for 194 at The Oval, India lost the last test by an innings. England's batsman [[Ken Barrington]] and [[Colin Cowdrey]] both had an excellent series with the bat, with Barrington scoring 357 runs across the series and Cowdrey scoring 344.\n\n===1960s===\nThe early and middle 1960s were poor periods for English cricket. Despite England's strength on paper, Australia held the Ashes and the West Indies dominated England in the early part of the decade. May stood down as captain in 1961 following the 1961 Ashes defeat.\n\n[[Ted Dexter]] succeeded him as captain but England continued to suffer indifferent results. In 1961\u201362, they beat Pakistan, but also lost to India. The following year saw England and Australia tie the 1962\u201363 Ashes series 1\u20131, meaning Australia retained the urn. Despite beating New Zealand 3\u20130, England went on to lose to the West Indies, and again failed in the 1964 Ashes, losing the home series 1\u20130, which marked the end of Dexter's captaincy.\n\nHowever, from 1968 to 1971 they played 27 consecutive Test matches without defeat, winning 9 and drawing 18 (including the abandoned Test at Melbourne in 1970\u201371). The sequence began when they drew with Australia at Lord's in the Second Test of the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1968|1968 Ashes series]] and ended in 1971 when [[Indian cricket team in England in 1971|India]] won the Third Test at The Oval by four wickets. They played 13 Tests with only one defeat immediately beforehand and so played a total of 40 consecutive Tests with only one defeat, dating from their innings victory over the West Indies at The Oval in 1966. During this period they beat New Zealand, India, the West Indies, and Pakistan, and under [[Ray Illingworth]]'s leadership, regained [[The Ashes]] from Australia in 1970\u201371.\n\n===1970s===\nThe 1970s, for the England team, can be largely split into three parts. Early in the decade, Illingworth's side dominated world cricket, winning the Ashes away in 1971 and then retaining them at home in 1972. The same side beat Pakistan at home in 1971 and played by far the better cricket against India that season. However, England were largely helped by the rain to sneak the Pakistan series 1\u20130 but the same rain saved India twice and one England collapse saw them lose to India. This was, however, one of (if not the) strongest England team ever with the likes of Illingworth, [[Geoffrey Boycott]], [[John Edrich]], [[Basil D'Oliveira]], [[Dennis Amiss]], [[Alan Knott]], [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]] and [[Derek Underwood]] at its core.\n\nThe mid-1970s were more turbulent. Illingworth and several others had refused to tour India in 1972\u201373 which led to a clamour for Illingworth's job by the end of that summer&nbsp;\u2013 England had just been beaten 2\u20130 by a flamboyant West Indies side&nbsp;\u2013 with several England players well over 35. [[Mike Denness]] was the surprising choice but only lasted 18 months; his results against poor opposition were good, but England were badly exposed as ageing and lacking in good fast bowling against the 1974\u201375 Australians, losing that series 4\u20131 to lose the Ashes.\n\nDenness was replaced in 1975 by [[Tony Greig]]. While he managed to avoid losing to Australia, his side were largely thrashed the following year by the young and very much upcoming West Indies for whom Greig's infamous \"grovel\" remark acted as motivation. Greig's finest hour was probably the 1976\u201377 win over India in India. When Greig was discovered as being instrumental in World Series Cricket, he was sacked, and replaced by [[Mike Brearley]].\n\nBrearley's side showed again the hyperbole that is often spoken when one side dominates in cricket. While his side of 1977\u201380 contained some young players who went on to become England greats, most notably future captains [[Ian Botham]], [[David Gower]] and [[Graham Gooch]], their opponents were often very much weakened by the absence of their World Series players, especially in 1978, when England beat New Zealand 3\u20130 and Pakistan 2\u20130 before thrashing what was effectively Australia's 2nd XI 5\u20131 in 1978\u201379.\n\n===1980s===\nThe England team, with Brearley's exit in 1980, was never truly settled throughout the 1980s, which will probably be remembered as a low point for the team. While some of the great players like Botham, Gooch and Gower had fine careers, the team seldom succeeded in beating good opposition throughout the decade and did not score a home Test victory (except against minnows Sri Lanka) between September 1985 and July 1990.\n\nBotham took over the captaincy in 1980 and they put up a good fight against the West Indies, losing a five match Test series 1\u20130, although England were humbled in the return series. After scoring a pair in the first Test against Australia, Botham lost the captaincy due to his poor form, and was replaced by Brearley. Botham returned to form and played exceptionally in the remainder of the series, being named man of the match in the third, fourth and fifth Tests. The series became known as Botham's Ashes as England recorded a 3\u20131 victory.\n\n[[Keith Fletcher]] took over as captain in 1981, but England lost his first series in charge against India. [[Bob Willis]] took over as captain in 1982 and enjoyed victories over India and Pakistan, but lost the Ashes after Australia clinched the series 2\u20131. England hosted the World Cup in 1983 and reached the semi-finals, but their Test form remained poor, as they suffered defeats against New Zealand, Pakistan and the West Indies.\n\nGower took over as skipper in 1984 and led the team to a 2\u20131 victory over India. They went on to win the 1985 Ashes 3\u20131, although after this came a poor run of form. Defeat to the West Indies dented the team's confidence, and they went on to lose to India 2\u20130. In 1986, [[Micky Stewart]] was appointed the first full-time England coach. England beat New Zealand, but there was little hope of them retaining the Ashes in 1986\u201387. However, despite being described as a team that 'can't bat, can't bowl and can't field', they went on to win the series 2\u20131.\n\nAfter losing consecutive series against Pakistan, England drew a three match Test series against New Zealand 0\u20130. They reached the final of the 1987 World Cup, but lost by seven runs against Australia. After losing 4\u20130 to the West Indies, England lost the Ashes to a resurgent Australia led by Allan Border. With the likes of Gooch banned following a rebel tour to South Africa, a new look England side suffered defeat again against the West Indies, although this time by a margin of 2\u20131.\n\n===1990s===\nIf the 1980s were a low point for English Test cricket, then the 1990s were only a slight improvement. The arrival of Gooch as captain in 1990 forced a move toward more professionalism and especially fitness though it took some time for old habits to die. Even in 2011, one or two successful county players have been shown up as physically unfit for international cricket. Creditable performances against India and New Zealand in 1990 were followed by a hard-fought draw against the 1991 West Indies and a strong performance in the [[1992 Cricket World Cup]] in which the England team finished as runners-up for the second consecutive World Cup, but landmark losses against Australia in 1990\u201391 and especially Pakistan in 1992 showed England up badly in terms of bowling. So bad was England's bowling in 1993 that [[Rod Marsh]] described England's pace attack at one point as \"pie throwers\". Having lost three of the first four Tests played in England in 1993, Gooch resigned to be replaced by [[Michael Atherton]].\n\nMore selectorial problems abounded during Atherton's reign as new chairman of selectors and coach Ray Illingworth (then into his 60s) assumed almost sole responsibility for the team off the field. The youth policy which had seen England emerge from the West Indies tour of 1993\u201394 with some credit (though losing to a seasoned Windies team) was abandoned and players such as Gatting and Gooch were persisted with when well into their 30s and 40s. England continued to do well at home against weaker opponents such as India, New Zealand and a West Indies side beginning to fade but struggled badly against improving sides like Pakistan and South Africa. Atherton had offered his resignation after losing the 1997 Ashes series 3\u20132 having been 1\u20130 up after two matches&nbsp;\u2013 eventually to resign one series later in early 1998. England, looking for talent, went through a whole raft of new players during this period, such as [[Ronnie Irani]], [[Adam Hollioake]], [[Craig White]], [[Graeme Hick]] and [[Mark Ramprakash]]. At this time, there were two main problems:\n* The lack of a genuine all-rounder to bat at 6, Botham having left a huge gap in the batting order when he retired from Tests in 1992.\n* [[Alec Stewart]], a sound wicket-keeper and an excellent player of quick bowling, could not open and keep wicket, hence his batting down the order, where he was often exposed to spin which he did not play as well.\n\nStewart took the reins as captain in 1998, but another losing Ashes series and early World Cup exit cost him Test and ODI captaincy in 1999. This should not detract from the 1998 home Test series where England showed great fortitude to beat a powerful South African side 2\u20131.\n\nAnother reason for their poor performances were the demands of [[County Championship|County Cricket]] teams on their players, meaning that England could rarely field a full-strength team on their tours. This eventually led to the [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]] taking over from the MCC as the governing body of England and the implementation of central contracts. 1992 also saw Scotland sever ties with the England and Wales team, and begin to compete as the [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland national team]].\n\nBy 1999, with coach David Lloyd resigning after the World Cup exit and new captain [[Nasser Hussain]] just appointed, England hit rock bottom (literally ranked as the lowest-rated Test nation) after losing 2\u20131 to New Zealand in shambolic fashion. Hussain was booed on the Oval balcony as the crowd jeered \"We've got the worst team in the world\" to the tune of \"[[He's Got the Whole World in His Hands]]\".\n\n===2000s===\nCentral contracts were installed \u2013 reducing players workloads \u2013 and following the arrival of Zimbabwean coach [[Duncan Fletcher]], England thrashed the fallen West Indies [[West Indian cricket team in England in 2000|3\u20131]]. England's results in Asia improved that winter with series wins against both [[History of cricket in Pakistan from 2001#England 2000\u201301|Pakistan]] and [[English cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2000\u201301|Sri Lanka]]. Hussain's side had a far harder edge to it, avoiding the anticipated \"Greenwash\" in the [[Australian cricket team in England in 2001|2001 Ashes series]] against the all-powerful Australian team. The nucleus the side was slowly coming together as players such as Hussain himself, [[Graham Thorpe]], [[Darren Gough]] and [[Ashley Giles]] began to be regularly selected. By 2003 though, having endured [[English cricket team in Australia in 2002\u201303|another Ashes drubbing]] as well as another first-round exit from the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|World Cup]], Hussain resigned as captain after one Test against [[South African cricket team in England in 2003|South Africa]].\n\n[[Michael Vaughan]] took over, with players encouraged to express themselves. England won five consecutive Test series prior to facing Australia in the [[2005 Ashes series]], [[International cricket in 2005#ICC Championship tables in May 2005|taking the team to second place]] in the [[ICC Test Championship]] table. During this period England defeated the West Indies [[West Indian cricket team in England in 2004|home]] and [[English cricket team in West Indies in 2003\u201304|away]], [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 2004|New Zealand]], and [[Bangladeshi cricket team in England in 2005|Bangladesh]] at home, and [[English cricket team in South Africa in 2004\u201305|South Africa]] in South Africa. In June 2005, England played its first ever [[Twenty20 International|T20 international match]], [[Australian cricket team in England in 2005#England v Australia (13 June)|defeating Australia by 100 runs]]. Later that year, England defeated Australia 2\u20131 in a thrilling series to regain the Ashes for the first time in 16 years, having lost them in 1989. Following the 2005 Ashes win, the team suffered from a spate of serious injuries to key players such as Vaughan, Giles, [[Andrew Flintoff]] and [[Simon Jones (cricketer)|Simon Jones]]. As a result, the team underwent an enforced period of transition. A [[English cricket team in Pakistan in 2005\u201306|2\u20130 defeat in Pakistan]] was followed by two drawn away series with [[English cricket team in India in 2005\u201306|India]] and [[Sri Lankan cricket team in England in 2006|Sri Lanka]].\n\nIn the [[Pakistani cricket team in England in 2006|home Test series victory against Pakistan]] in July and August 2006, several promising new players emerged. Most notable were the left-arm orthodox spin bowler [[Monty Panesar]], the first [[Sikh]] to play Test cricket for England, and left-handed opening batsman [[Alastair Cook]]. The [[2006\u201307 Ashes series]] was keenly anticipated and was expected to provide a level of competition comparable to the 2005 series. In the event, England, captained by Flintoff who was deputising for the injured Vaughan, lost all five Tests to concede the first Ashes whitewash in 86 years.\n\nIn the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]], England lost to most of the Test playing nations they faced, beating only the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] and [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]], although they also avoided defeat by any of the non-Test playing nations. Even so, the unimpressive nature of most of their victories in the tournament, combined with heavy defeats by New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, left many commentators criticising the manner in which the England team approached the one-day game. Coach Duncan Fletcher resigned after eight years in the job as a result and was succeeded by former [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] coach [[Peter Moores (cricketer)|Peter Moores]].\n\nIn 2007\u201308, England toured [[English cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2007\u201308|Sri Lanka]] and [[English cricket team in New Zealand in 2007\u201308|New Zealand]], losing the first series 1\u20130 and winning the second 2\u20131. These series were followed up at home in May 2008 with a [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 2008|2\u20130 home series win against New Zealand]], with the results easing pressure on Moores \u2013 who was not at ease with his team, particularly star batsman [[Kevin Pietersen]]. Pietersen succeeded Vaughan as captain in June 2008, after England had been well beaten by [[South African cricket team in England in 2008|South Africa at home]]. The poor relationship between the two came to a head on the [[English cricket team in India in 2008\u201309|2008\u201309 tour to India]]. England lost the series 1\u20130 and both men resigned their positions, although Pietersen remained a member of the England team. Moores was replaced as coach by Zimbabwean [[Andy Flower]]. Against this background, England toured the [[English cricket team in West Indies in 2008\u201309|West Indies]] under the captaincy of [[Andrew Strauss]] and, in a disappointing performance, lost the Test series 1\u20130.\n\nThe [[2009 Ashes series]] featured the first Test match played in Wales, at [[Sophia Gardens (cricket ground)|Sophia Gardens]], Cardiff. England drew the match thanks to a last-wicket stand by bowlers [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]] and Panesar. A victory for each team followed before the series was decided at The Oval. Thanks to fine bowling by [[Stuart Broad]] and [[Graeme Swann]] and a debut century by [[Jonathan Trott]], England regained the Ashes.\n\n===2010s===\nAfter a drawn [[English cricket team in South Africa in 2009\u201310|Test series in South Africa]], England won their first ever ICC world championship, the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20|2010 World Twenty20]], with a seven-wicket win over Australia in Barbados. The following winter in the [[2010\u201311 Ashes series|2010\u201311 Ashes]], they beat Australia 3\u20131 to retain the urn and record their first series win in Australia for 24 years. Furthermore, all three of their wins were by an innings \u2013 the first time a touring side had ever recorded three innings victories in a single Test series. Cook earned Man of the Series with 766 runs.\n\nEngland struggled to match their Test form in the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]]. Despite beating South Africa and tying with eventual winners India, England suffered shock losses to Ireland and Bangladesh before losing in the quarter-finals to Sri Lanka.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka vs England, 4th quarter-final ICC World Cup 2011|url=http://iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com/2011/03/4th-quarter-final-sri-lanka-vs-england.html|date=26 March 2011|access-date=26 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818070122/http://iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com/2011/03/4th-quarter-final-sri-lanka-vs-england.html|archive-date=18 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> However the team's excellent form in the Test match arena continued and on 13 August 2011, they became the world's top-ranked Test team after [[Indian cricket team in England in 2011|comfortably whitewashing India 4\u20130]], their sixth consecutive series victory and eighth in the past nine series. However, this status only lasted a year \u2013 having [[England cricket team against Pakistan in the UAE in 2011\u201312|lost 3\u20130 to Pakistan]] over the winter, England were [[South African cricket team in England in 2012|beaten 2\u20130 by South Africa]], who replaced them at the top of the rankings. It was their first home series loss since 2008, against the same opposition.\n\nThis loss saw the resignation of Strauss as captain (and his retirement from cricket). Cook, who was already in charge of the ODI side, replaced Strauss and led England to a [[English cricket team in India in 2012\u201313|2\u20131 victory in India]] \u2013 their first in the country since 1984\u201385. In doing so, he became the first captain to score centuries in his first five Tests as captain and became England's leading century-maker with 23 centuries to his name.\n[[File:The England Cricket Team Ashes 2015.jpg|thumbnail|right|The England team celebrate victory over Australia in the [[2015 Ashes series]]]]\nAfter finishing as runners-up in the [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy|ICC Champions Trophy]], England faced Australia in back-to-back Ashes series. A [[2013 Ashes series|3\u20130 home win]] secured England the urn for the fourth time in five series. However, in [[2013\u201314 Ashes series|the return series]], they found themselves utterly demolished in a 5\u20130 defeat, their second Ashes whitewash in under a decade. Their misery was compounded by batsman Jonathan Trott leaving the tour early due to a stress-related illness and the mid-series retirement of spinner Graeme Swann. Following the tour, head coach Flower resigned his post while Pietersen was dropped indefinitely from the England team.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/26040475 |title=Kevin Pietersen: Batsman's England career over |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 February 2014 |accessdate=4 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606010906/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/26040475 |archive-date=6 June 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Flower was replaced by his predecessor, Moores, but he was sacked for a second time after a string of disappointing results including failing to advance from the group stage at the [[2015 Cricket World Cup|2015 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/moores-leaves-role-england-head-coach |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105175138/http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/moores-leaves-role-england-head-coach |archivedate=5 November 2015 }}</ref> He was replaced by Australian [[Trevor Bayliss]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/ecb-names-trevor-bayliss-englands-new-head-coach |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129101453/http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/ecb-names-trevor-bayliss-englands-new-head-coach |archivedate=29 January 2016 }}</ref> who oversaw an upturn of form in the ODI side, including series victories against [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 2015#ODI series|New Zealand]] and [[English cricket team against Pakistan in the UAE in 2015\u201316#ODI series|Pakistan]].

Apart from in Test matches, when touring abroad, the England team officially played as [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] up to and including the 1976\u201377 tour of Australia, reflecting the time when MCC had been responsible for selecting the touring party.

In addition, [[Chris Jordan (cricketer)|Chris Jordan]], [[Ben Stokes]] and Tom Curran have British citizenship, having lived in England since their youth, while [[Eoin Morgan]] also holds Irish citizenship. Curran's younger brother, Sam, was born in the UK, so did not have to have to undergo a qualification period. Jofra Archer, though born in Barbados to a Barbadian mother, qualifies through his English father.\n\nICC regulations also allow cricketers who represent [[List of International Cricket Council members#Top Associate/Affiliate Members|associate]] (i.e. non-Test-playing) nations to switch to a Test-playing nation, provided nationality requirements are fulfilled.

The match, starting on 15 March 1877 at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] came to be regarded as the inaugural Test match. The combined Australian XI won this Test match by 45 runs with [[Charles Bannerman]] of Australia scoring the first Test century.

Australia also won the 1902 series, which was memorable for exciting cricket, including [[Gilbert Jessop]] scoring a Test century in just 70 minutes. England regained the Ashes in 1904 under the captaincy of [[Pelham Warner]]. [[R. E. Foster]] scored 287 on his debut and [[Wilfred Rhodes]] took 15 wickets in a match. In 1905\u201306, England lost 4\u20131 against South Africa. England avenged the defeat in 1907, when they won the series 1\u20130 under the captaincy of Foster. However, they lost the 1909 Ashes series against Australia, suing 25 players in the process. England also lost to South Africa, with [[Jack Hobbs]] scoring his first of 15 centuries on the tour.\n\n===1910s===\nEngland toured Australia in 1911\u201312 and beat their opponents 4\u20131. The team included the likes of Rhodes, Hobbs, [[Frank Woolley]] and [[Sydney Barnes]]. England lost the first match of the series but bounced back and won the next four Tests. This proved to be the last Ashes series before the war.\n\nThe 1912 season saw England take part in a unique experiment. A nine-Test triangular tournament involving England, South Africa and Australia was set up. The series was hampered by a very wet summer and player disputes however and the tournament was considered a failure with the ''Daily Telegraph'' stating:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ausveng/content/story/260677.html|title=England v Australia 1890&nbsp;\u2013 1914|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=5 February 2008|date=27 September 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008035811/http://content-uk.cricinfo.com/ausveng/content/story/260677.html|archive-date=8 October 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|Nine Tests provide a surfeit of cricket, and contests between Australia and South Africa are not a great attraction to the British public.}}\n\nWith Australia sending a weakened team and the South African bowlers being ineffective England dominated the tournament winning four of their six matches.

Still feeling the effects of the war England went down to a series of crushing defeats and suffered their first whitewash losing the series 5\u20130. Six Australians scored hundreds while Mailey spun out 36 English batsmen. Things were no better in the next few Ashes series losing the 1921 Ashes series 3\u20130 and the 1924\u201325 Ashes 4\u20131. England's fortunes were to change in 1926 as they regained the Ashes and were a formidable team during this period dispatching Australia 4\u20131 in the 1928\u201329 Ashes tour.\n\nOn the same year the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] became the fourth nation to be granted [[Test cricket#Test status|Test status]] and played their first game against England. England won each of these three Tests by an innings, and a view was expressed in the press that their elevation had proved a mistake although [[Learie Constantine]] did [[Double (cricket)|the double]] on the tour. In the 1929\u201330 season England went on two concurrent tours with one team going to New Zealand (who were granted Test status earlier that year) and the other to the West Indies. Despite sending two separate teams England won both tours beating New Zealand 1\u20130 and the West Indies 2\u20131.\n\n===1930s===\n[[File:4th Test Woodfull.jpg|left|thumb|[[Bill Woodfull]] evades a Bodyline ball. Note the number of leg-side fielders.]]\nThe 1930 Ashes series saw a young [[Don Bradman]] dominate the tour, scoring 974 runs in his seven Test innings. He scored 254 at Lord's, 334 at [[Headingley Cricket Ground|Headingley]] and 232 at [[The Oval]]. Australia regained the Ashes winning the series 3\u20131. As a result of Bradman's prolific run-scoring the England captain [[Douglas Jardine]] chose to develop the already existing [[leg theory]] into fast leg theory, or bodyline, as a tactic to stop Bradman. Fast leg theory involved bowling fast balls directly at the batsman's body. The batsman would need to defend himself, and if he touched the ball with the bat, he risked being caught by one of a large number of fielders placed on the leg side.\n\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 233112 English cricket team at the test match held in Brisbane, 1928.jpg|right|thumb|English cricket team at the Test match held at the [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]]. England won the match by a record margin of 675 runs.]]\nUsing Jardine's fast leg theory, England won the next Ashes series 4\u20131, but complaints about the Bodyline tactic caused crowd disruption on the tour, and threats of diplomatic action from the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Cricket Board]], which during the tour sent the following cable to the MCC in London:\n\n{{quote|Bodyline bowling assumed such proportions as to menace best interests of game, making protection of body by batsmen the main consideration. Causing intensely bitter feeling between players as well as injury. In our opinion is unsportsmanlike. Unless stopped at once likely to upset friendly relations existing between Australia and England.}}\n\nLater, Jardine was removed from the captaincy and the [[Laws of Cricket]] changed so that no more than one fast ball aimed at the body was permitted per over, and having more than two fielders behind square leg was banned.\n\nEngland's following tour of India in the 1933\u201334 season was the first Test match to be staged in the subcontinent. The series was also notable for [[Stan Nichols]] and [[Nobby Clark (cricketer)|Nobby Clark]] bowling so many bouncers that the Indian batsman wore solar toup\u00e9es instead of caps to protect themselves.\n\nAustralia won the 1934 Ashes series 2\u20131 and kept the urn for the following 19 years. Many of the wickets of the time were friendly to batsmen resulting in a large proportion of matches ending in high scoring draws and many batting records being set.\n\nEngland drew the 1938 Ashes, meaning Australia retained the urn. England went into the final match of the series at The Oval 1\u20130 down, but won the final game by an innings and 579 runs. [[Len Hutton]] made the highest ever Test score by an Englishman, making 364 in England first innings to help them reach 903, their highest ever score against Australia.\n\nThe 1938\u201339 tour of South Africa saw another experiment with the deciding Test being a [[timeless Test]] that was played to a finish. England lead 1\u20130 going into the final timeless match at Durban. Despite the final Test being 'timeless', the game ended in a draw after 10 days as England had to catch the train to catch the boat home. A record 1,981 runs were scored, and the concept of timeless Tests was abandoned. England went on one final tour of the West Indies in 1939 before the [[World War II|Second World War]], although a team for an MCC tour of India was selected more in hope than expectation of the matches being played.\n\n===1940s===\nTest cricket resumed after the war in 1946, and England won their first match back against India. However, they struggled in the 1946\u201347 Ashes series, losing 3\u20130 in Australia under [[Wally Hammond]]'s captaincy. England beat South Africa 3\u20130 in 1947 with [[Denis Compton]] scoring 1,187 runs in the series.\n\nThe 1947\u201348 series against the West Indies was another disappointment for England, with the side losing 2\u20130 following injuries to several key players. England suffered further humiliation against Bradman's invincible side in the 1948 Ashes series. Hutton was controversially dropped for the third Test, and England were bowled out for just 52 at The Oval. The series proved to be Bradman's final Ashes series.\n\nIn 1948\u201349, England beat South Africa 2\u20130 under the captaincy of George Mann. The series included a record breaking stand of 359 between Hutton and [[Cyril Washbrook]]. The decade ended with England drawing the Test series against New Zealand, with every match ending in a draw.\n\n===1950s===\nTheir fortunes changed on the 1953 Ashes tour as they won the series 1\u20130. England did not lose a series between their 1950\u201351 and 1958\u201359 tours of Australia and secured famous victory in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1954\u201355|1954\u201355]] under the captaincy of [[Peter May (cricketer)|Peter May]], thanks to [[Frank Tyson]] whose 6/85 at Sydney and 7/27 at Melbourne are remembered as the fastest bowling ever seen in Australia. The 1956 series was remembered for the bowling of [[Jim Laker]] who took 46 wickets at an average of 9.62, including figures of 19/90 at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]]. After drawing to South Africa, England defeated the West Indies and New Zealand comfortably.\n\nThe England team then left for Australia in the 1958\u201359 season with a team that had been hailed as the strongest ever to leave on an Ashes tour but lost the series 4\u20130 as [[Richie Benaud]]'s revitalised Australians were too strong, with England struggling with the bat throughout the series.\n\nOn 24 August 1959, England inflicted its only 5\u20130 whitewash over [[India national cricket team|India]]. All out for 194 at The Oval, India lost the last test by an innings. England's batsman [[Ken Barrington]] and [[Colin Cowdrey]] both had an excellent series with the bat, with Barrington scoring 357 runs across the series and Cowdrey scoring 344.\n\n===1960s===\nThe early and middle 1960s were poor periods for English cricket. Despite England's strength on paper, Australia held the Ashes and the West Indies dominated England in the early part of the decade. May stood down as captain in 1961 following the 1961 Ashes defeat.\n\n[[Ted Dexter]] succeeded him as captain but England continued to suffer indifferent results. In 1961\u201362, they beat Pakistan, but also lost to India. The following year saw England and Australia tie the 1962\u201363 Ashes series 1\u20131, meaning Australia retained the urn. Despite beating New Zealand 3\u20130, England went on to lose to the West Indies, and again failed in the 1964 Ashes, losing the home series 1\u20130, which marked the end of Dexter's captaincy.\n\nHowever, from 1968 to 1971 they played 27 consecutive Test matches without defeat, winning 9 and drawing 18 (including the abandoned Test at Melbourne in 1970\u201371). The sequence began when they drew with Australia at Lord's in the Second Test of the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1968|1968 Ashes series]] and ended in 1971 when [[Indian cricket team in England in 1971|India]] won the Third Test at The Oval by four wickets. They played 13 Tests with only one defeat immediately beforehand and so played a total of 40 consecutive Tests with only one defeat, dating from their innings victory over the West Indies at The Oval in 1966. During this period they beat New Zealand, India, the West Indies, and Pakistan, and under [[Ray Illingworth]]'s leadership, regained [[The Ashes]] from Australia in 1970\u201371.\n\n===1970s===\nThe 1970s, for the England team, can be largely split into three parts. Early in the decade, Illingworth's side dominated world cricket, winning the Ashes away in 1971 and then retaining them at home in 1972. The same side beat Pakistan at home in 1971 and played by far the better cricket against India that season. However, England were largely helped by the rain to sneak the Pakistan series 1\u20130 but the same rain saved India twice and one England collapse saw them lose to India. This was, however, one of (if not the) strongest England team ever with the likes of Illingworth, [[Geoffrey Boycott]], [[John Edrich]], [[Basil D'Oliveira]], [[Dennis Amiss]], [[Alan Knott]], [[John Snow (cricketer)|John Snow]] and [[Derek Underwood]] at its core.\n\nThe mid-1970s were more turbulent. Illingworth and several others had refused to tour India in 1972\u201373 which led to a clamour for Illingworth's job by the end of that summer&nbsp;\u2013 England had just been beaten 2\u20130 by a flamboyant West Indies side&nbsp;\u2013 with several England players well over 35. [[Mike Denness]] was the surprising choice but only lasted 18 months; his results against poor opposition were good, but England were badly exposed as ageing and lacking in good fast bowling against the 1974\u201375 Australians, losing that series 4\u20131 to lose the Ashes.\n\nDenness was replaced in 1975 by [[Tony Greig]]. While he managed to avoid losing to Australia, his side were largely thrashed the following year by the young and very much upcoming West Indies for whom Greig's infamous \"grovel\" remark acted as motivation. Greig's finest hour was probably the 1976\u201377 win over India in India. When Greig was discovered as being instrumental in World Series Cricket, he was sacked, and replaced by [[Mike Brearley]].\n\nBrearley's side showed again the hyperbole that is often spoken when one side dominates in cricket. While his side of 1977\u201380 contained some young players who went on to become England greats, most notably future captains [[Ian Botham]], [[David Gower]] and [[Graham Gooch]], their opponents were often very much weakened by the absence of their World Series players, especially in 1978, when England beat New Zealand 3\u20130 and Pakistan 2\u20130 before thrashing what was effectively Australia's 2nd XI 5\u20131 in 1978\u201379.\n\n===1980s===\nThe England team, with Brearley's exit in 1980, was never truly settled throughout the 1980s, which will probably be remembered as a low point for the team. While some of the great players like Botham, Gooch and Gower had fine careers, the team seldom succeeded in beating good opposition throughout the decade and did not score a home Test victory (except against minnows Sri Lanka) between September 1985 and July 1990.\n\nBotham took over the captaincy in 1980 and they put up a good fight against the West Indies, losing a five match Test series 1\u20130, although England were humbled in the return series. After scoring a pair in the first Test against Australia, Botham lost the captaincy due to his poor form, and was replaced by Brearley. Botham returned to form and played exceptionally in the remainder of the series, being named man of the match in the third, fourth and fifth Tests. The series became known as Botham's Ashes as England recorded a 3\u20131 victory.\n\n[[Keith Fletcher]] took over as captain in 1981, but England lost his first series in charge against India. [[Bob Willis]] took over as captain in 1982 and enjoyed victories over India and Pakistan, but lost the Ashes after Australia clinched the series 2\u20131. England hosted the World Cup in 1983 and reached the semi-finals, but their Test form remained poor, as they suffered defeats against New Zealand, Pakistan and the West Indies.\n\nGower took over as skipper in 1984 and led the team to a 2\u20131 victory over India. They went on to win the 1985 Ashes 3\u20131, although after this came a poor run of form. Defeat to the West Indies dented the team's confidence, and they went on to lose to India 2\u20130. In 1986, [[Micky Stewart]] was appointed the first full-time England coach. England beat New Zealand, but there was little hope of them retaining the Ashes in 1986\u201387. However, despite being described as a team that 'can't bat, can't bowl and can't field', they went on to win the series 2\u20131.\n\nAfter losing consecutive series against Pakistan, England drew a three match Test series against New Zealand 0\u20130. They reached the final of the 1987 World Cup, but lost by seven runs against Australia. After losing 4\u20130 to the West Indies, England lost the Ashes to a resurgent Australia led by Allan Border. With the likes of Gooch banned following a rebel tour to South Africa, a new look England side suffered defeat again against the West Indies, although this time by a margin of 2\u20131.\n\n===1990s===\nIf the 1980s were a low point for English Test cricket, then the 1990s were only a slight improvement. The arrival of Gooch as captain in 1990 forced a move toward more professionalism and especially fitness though it took some time for old habits to die. Even in 2011, one or two successful county players have been shown up as physically unfit for international cricket. Creditable performances against India and New Zealand in 1990 were followed by a hard-fought draw against the 1991 West Indies and a strong performance in the [[1992 Cricket World Cup]] in which the England team finished as runners-up for the second consecutive World Cup, but landmark losses against Australia in 1990\u201391 and especially Pakistan in 1992 showed England up badly in terms of bowling. So bad was England's bowling in 1993 that [[Rod Marsh]] described England's pace attack at one point as \"pie throwers\". Having lost three of the first four Tests played in England in 1993, Gooch resigned to be replaced by [[Michael Atherton]].\n\nMore selectorial problems abounded during Atherton's reign as new chairman of selectors and coach Ray Illingworth (then into his 60s) assumed almost sole responsibility for the team off the field. The youth policy which had seen England emerge from the West Indies tour of 1993\u201394 with some credit (though losing to a seasoned Windies team) was abandoned and players such as Gatting and Gooch were persisted with when well into their 30s and 40s. England continued to do well at home against weaker opponents such as India, New Zealand and a West Indies side beginning to fade but struggled badly against improving sides like Pakistan and South Africa. Atherton had offered his resignation after losing the 1997 Ashes series 3\u20132 having been 1\u20130 up after two matches&nbsp;\u2013 eventually to resign one series later in early 1998. England, looking for talent, went through a whole raft of new players during this period, such as [[Ronnie Irani]], [[Adam Hollioake]], [[Craig White]], [[Graeme Hick]] and [[Mark Ramprakash]]. At this time, there were two main problems:\n* The lack of a genuine all-rounder to bat at 6, Botham having left a huge gap in the batting order when he retired from Tests in 1992.\n* [[Alec Stewart]], a sound wicket-keeper and an excellent player of quick bowling, could not open and keep wicket, hence his batting down the order, where he was often exposed to spin which he did not play as well.\n\nStewart took the reins as captain in 1998, but another losing Ashes series and early World Cup exit cost him Test and ODI captaincy in 1999. This should not detract from the 1998 home Test series where England showed great fortitude to beat a powerful South African side 2\u20131.\n\nAnother reason for their poor performances were the demands of [[County Championship|County Cricket]] teams on their players, meaning that England could rarely field a full-strength team on their tours. This eventually led to the [[England and Wales Cricket Board|ECB]] taking over from the MCC as the governing body of England and the implementation of central contracts. 1992 also saw Scotland sever ties with the England and Wales team, and begin to compete as the [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland national team]].\n\nBy 1999, with coach David Lloyd resigning after the World Cup exit and new captain [[Nasser Hussain]] just appointed, England hit rock bottom (literally ranked as the lowest-rated Test nation) after losing 2\u20131 to New Zealand in shambolic fashion. Hussain was booed on the Oval balcony as the crowd jeered \"We've got the worst team in the world\" to the tune of \"[[He's Got the Whole World in His Hands]]\".\n\n===2000s===\nCentral contracts were installed \u2013 reducing players workloads \u2013 and following the arrival of Zimbabwean coach [[Duncan Fletcher]], England thrashed the fallen West Indies [[West Indian cricket team in England in 2000|3\u20131]]. England's results in Asia improved that winter with series wins against both [[History of cricket in Pakistan from 2001#England 2000\u201301|Pakistan]] and [[English cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2000\u201301|Sri Lanka]]. Hussain's side had a far harder edge to it, avoiding the anticipated \"Greenwash\" in the [[Australian cricket team in England in 2001|2001 Ashes series]] against the all-powerful Australian team. The nucleus the side was slowly coming together as players such as Hussain himself, [[Graham Thorpe]], [[Darren Gough]] and [[Ashley Giles]] began to be regularly selected. By 2003 though, having endured [[English cricket team in Australia in 2002\u201303|another Ashes drubbing]] as well as another first-round exit from the [[2003 Cricket World Cup|World Cup]], Hussain resigned as captain after one Test against [[South African cricket team in England in 2003|South Africa]].\n\n[[Michael Vaughan]] took over, with players encouraged to express themselves. England won five consecutive Test series prior to facing Australia in the [[2005 Ashes series]], [[International cricket in 2005#ICC Championship tables in May 2005|taking the team to second place]] in the [[ICC Test Championship]] table. During this period England defeated the West Indies [[West Indian cricket team in England in 2004|home]] and [[English cricket team in West Indies in 2003\u201304|away]], [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 2004|New Zealand]], and [[Bangladeshi cricket team in England in 2005|Bangladesh]] at home, and [[English cricket team in South Africa in 2004\u201305|South Africa]] in South Africa. In June 2005, England played its first ever [[Twenty20 International|T20 international match]], [[Australian cricket team in England in 2005#England v Australia (13 June)|defeating Australia by 100 runs]]. Later that year, England defeated Australia 2\u20131 in a thrilling series to regain the Ashes for the first time in 16 years, having lost them in 1989. Following the 2005 Ashes win, the team suffered from a spate of serious injuries to key players such as Vaughan, Giles, [[Andrew Flintoff]] and [[Simon Jones (cricketer)|Simon Jones]]. As a result, the team underwent an enforced period of transition. A [[English cricket team in Pakistan in 2005\u201306|2\u20130 defeat in Pakistan]] was followed by two drawn away series with [[English cricket team in India in 2005\u201306|India]] and [[Sri Lankan cricket team in England in 2006|Sri Lanka]].\n\nIn the [[Pakistani cricket team in England in 2006|home Test series victory against Pakistan]] in July and August 2006, several promising new players emerged. Most notable were the left-arm orthodox spin bowler [[Monty Panesar]], the first [[Sikh]] to play Test cricket for England, and left-handed opening batsman [[Alastair Cook]]. The [[2006\u201307 Ashes series]] was keenly anticipated and was expected to provide a level of competition comparable to the 2005 series. In the event, England, captained by Flintoff who was deputising for the injured Vaughan, lost all five Tests to concede the first Ashes whitewash in 86 years.\n\nIn the [[2007 Cricket World Cup]], England lost to most of the Test playing nations they faced, beating only the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] and [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]], although they also avoided defeat by any of the non-Test playing nations. Even so, the unimpressive nature of most of their victories in the tournament, combined with heavy defeats by New Zealand, Australia and South Africa, left many commentators criticising the manner in which the England team approached the one-day game. Coach Duncan Fletcher resigned after eight years in the job as a result and was succeeded by former [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] coach [[Peter Moores (cricketer)|Peter Moores]].\n\nIn 2007\u201308, England toured [[English cricket team in Sri Lanka in 2007\u201308|Sri Lanka]] and [[English cricket team in New Zealand in 2007\u201308|New Zealand]], losing the first series 1\u20130 and winning the second 2\u20131. These series were followed up at home in May 2008 with a [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 2008|2\u20130 home series win against New Zealand]], with the results easing pressure on Moores \u2013 who was not at ease with his team, particularly star batsman [[Kevin Pietersen]]. Pietersen succeeded Vaughan as captain in June 2008, after England had been well beaten by [[South African cricket team in England in 2008|South Africa at home]]. The poor relationship between the two came to a head on the [[English cricket team in India in 2008\u201309|2008\u201309 tour to India]]. England lost the series 1\u20130 and both men resigned their positions, although Pietersen remained a member of the England team. Moores was replaced as coach by Zimbabwean [[Andy Flower]]. Against this background, England toured the [[English cricket team in West Indies in 2008\u201309|West Indies]] under the captaincy of [[Andrew Strauss]] and, in a disappointing performance, lost the Test series 1\u20130.\n\nThe [[2009 Ashes series]] featured the first Test match played in Wales, at [[Sophia Gardens (cricket ground)|Sophia Gardens]], Cardiff. England drew the match thanks to a last-wicket stand by bowlers [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]] and Panesar. A victory for each team followed before the series was decided at The Oval. Thanks to fine bowling by [[Stuart Broad]] and [[Graeme Swann]] and a debut century by [[Jonathan Trott]], England regained the Ashes.\n\n===2010s===\nAfter a drawn [[English cricket team in South Africa in 2009\u201310|Test series in South Africa]], England won their first ever ICC world championship, the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20|2010 World Twenty20]], with a seven-wicket win over Australia in Barbados. The following winter in the [[2010\u201311 Ashes series|2010\u201311 Ashes]], they beat Australia 3\u20131 to retain the urn and record their first series win in Australia for 24 years. Furthermore, all three of their wins were by an innings \u2013 the first time a touring side had ever recorded three innings victories in a single Test series. Cook earned Man of the Series with 766 runs.\n\nEngland struggled to match their Test form in the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]]. Despite beating South Africa and tying with eventual winners India, England suffered shock losses to Ireland and Bangladesh before losing in the quarter-finals to Sri Lanka.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sri Lanka vs England, 4th quarter-final ICC World Cup 2011|url=http://iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com/2011/03/4th-quarter-final-sri-lanka-vs-england.html|date=26 March 2011|access-date=26 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818070122/http://iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com/2011/03/4th-quarter-final-sri-lanka-vs-england.html|archive-date=18 August 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> However the team's excellent form in the Test match arena continued and on 13 August 2011, they became the world's top-ranked Test team after [[Indian cricket team in England in 2011|comfortably whitewashing India 4\u20130]], their sixth consecutive series victory and eighth in the past nine series. However, this status only lasted a year \u2013 having [[England cricket team against Pakistan in the UAE in 2011\u201312|lost 3\u20130 to Pakistan]] over the winter, England were [[South African cricket team in England in 2012|beaten 2\u20130 by South Africa]], who replaced them at the top of the rankings. It was their first home series loss since 2008, against the same opposition.\n\nThis loss saw the resignation of Strauss as captain (and his retirement from cricket). Cook, who was already in charge of the ODI side, replaced Strauss and led England to a [[English cricket team in India in 2012\u201313|2\u20131 victory in India]] \u2013 their first in the country since 1984\u201385. In doing so, he became the first captain to score centuries in his first five Tests as captain and became England's leading century-maker with 23 centuries to his name.\n[[File:The England Cricket Team Ashes 2015.jpg|thumbnail|right|The England team celebrate victory over Australia in the [[2015 Ashes series]]]]\nAfter finishing as runners-up in the [[2013 ICC Champions Trophy|ICC Champions Trophy]], England faced Australia in back-to-back Ashes series. A [[2013 Ashes series|3\u20130 home win]] secured England the urn for the fourth time in five series. However, in [[2013\u201314 Ashes series|the return series]], they found themselves utterly demolished in a 5\u20130 defeat, their second Ashes whitewash in under a decade. Their misery was compounded by batsman Jonathan Trott leaving the tour early due to a stress-related illness and the mid-series retirement of spinner Graeme Swann. Following the tour, head coach Flower resigned his post while Pietersen was dropped indefinitely from the England team.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/26040475 |title=Kevin Pietersen: Batsman's England career over |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 February 2014 |accessdate=4 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140606010906/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/cricket/26040475 |archive-date=6 June 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Flower was replaced by his predecessor, Moores, but he was sacked for a second time after a string of disappointing results including failing to advance from the group stage at the [[2015 Cricket World Cup|2015 World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/moores-leaves-role-england-head-coach |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105175138/http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/moores-leaves-role-england-head-coach |archivedate=5 November 2015 }}</ref> He was replaced by Australian [[Trevor Bayliss]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/ecb-names-trevor-bayliss-englands-new-head-coach |title=Archived copy |accessdate=4 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129101453/http://www.ecb.co.uk/news/articles/ecb-names-trevor-bayliss-englands-new-head-coach |archivedate=29 January 2016 }}</ref> who oversaw an upturn of form in the ODI side, including series victories against [[New Zealand cricket team in England in 2015#ODI series|New Zealand]] and [[English cricket team against Pakistan in the UAE in 2015\u201316#ODI series|Pakistan]].

In addition, [[Chris Jordan (cricketer)|Chris Jordan]], [[Ben Stokes]] and Tom Curran have British citizenship, having lived in England since their youth, while [[Eoin Morgan]] also holds Irish citizenship. Curran's younger brother, Sam, was born in the UK, so did not have to have to undergo a qualification period. Jofra Archer, though born in Barbados to a Barbadian mother, qualifies through his English father.\n\nICC regulations also allow cricketers who represent [[List of International Cricket Council members#Top Associate/Affiliate Members|associate]] (i.e. non-Test-playing) nations to switch to a Test-playing nation, provided nationality requirements are fulfilled. In recent years, this has seen Irish internationals [[Ed Joyce]], [[Boyd Rankin]] and Eoin Morgan switch to represent England, whilst [[Gavin Hamilton (cricketer)|Gavin Hamilton]] previously played for Scotland&nbsp;\u2013 though Joyce, Rankin and Hamilton were later able to re-qualify for and represent the countries of their birth.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal bar|Cricket}}\n* [[List of England cricket captains]]\n* [[List of England cricket team coaches]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |last=Waghorn|first=H.

In the second innings, however, he reached a century from 226 deliveries, his slowest but his first since August 2006, going on to make his highest score in Test cricket, 177. This innings seemed to help Strauss re-find his spark as in the first part of the English domestic season that followed he scored runs prolifically for Middlesex, smashing a 163 off 130 balls against Surrey in a domestic one day match.\n\n====New Zealand and South Africa tour England====\nAfter his 177, Strauss's place in the side was guaranteed for the following series against the same opposition. While still ignored for the One Day International team he was given back his position of Test opener alongside Alastair Cook, Michael Vaughan going back down to number 3. In the first rain affected match at Lords he carried on his form with a slow but steady 63 in the only England innings of the match. In the second Test Strauss made another 60 before getting out giving England a decent start following a big first innings total. He then went on to make 106, chasing 294, in the second innings on a now difficult batting wicket which set England up to win by 6 wickets to take a 1\u20130 lead in the three match series. This was Strauss's second Test match century at Old Trafford (the first coming against Australia in 2005, when he also scored 106). In the third and final Test at Trent Bridge he made 37 in England's first and only innings as England went on to win the series 2\u20130. He was named England's man of the series for his 266 runs at an average of 66.50.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7420284.stm ''Strauss ton inspires England win''] from [[BBC News]] retrieved 26 May 2008</ref>\n\nHis form now impressing the selectors, Strauss was allowed to keep his place for the tour against South Africa. He started on an average note being dismissed for 44 in England's only innings of the first match. He suffered in the second Test at Headlingly, however, making just 27 runs in the first innings and a duck in the second. A pair of 20s resulted as Strauss continued to struggle against the pace bowling of South Africa in the third Test. With England 2\u20130 down going into the last Test, a win was needed to restore pride. Strauss failed in the first innings, being dismissed for six. With the bowlers having got England into a match winning position, Strauss then came good, sharing a century opening stand with Cook and eventually being dismissed for 58. Nevertheless, his place remained under pressure again.\n\n====2008 Tour of India====\nStrauss managed to keep his place for the India tour and immediately rewarded the selectors by making 123 in the first innings of the first Test match with the rest of the batting lagging behind. He followed it up by holding the batting order together after a collapse that saw England 43\u20133 and shared a 200 run partnership with Paul Collingwood in which Strauss and Collingwood both made 108. He became just the 10th Englishman to make two hundreds in the same Test match, with Marcus Trescothick being the last in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/282951.html|title=  Records / Test matches / Batting records / Hundred in each innings of a match |publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=22 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Captaincy====\nStrauss was appointed captain on 7 January 2009 after a rift between previous captain [[Kevin Pietersen]] and Peter Moores became public.

On his domestic home ground, Strauss batted through the entire first day of the match for 161 runs, sharing an opening partnership of 196 with [[Alastair Cook]] (95). Though Strauss was bowled by [[Ben Hilfenhaus]]'s second ball the following day without adding to his overnight score, his innings was the highest individual score made by either side during the series, and set up a 210-run first-innings lead. Strauss contributed 32 to England's second innings, as Australia were set a target of 522 to win, a record if achieved. Though Michael Clarke (136), [[Brad Haddin]] (80) and [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]] (63) briefly made the target seem attainable, [[Andrew Flintoff]] (5\u201392) and [[Graeme Swann]] (4\u201387) bowled England to a comfortable 115-run victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/345971.html |title=England v Australia at Lord's, 2nd Test, 2009 |publisher=Cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the third Test at [[Edgbaston cricket ground|Edgbaston]], Strauss responded to Australia's first innings of 263 by ending the second day 64 not out; he was removed by [[Ben Hilfenhaus]] the following morning for 69, before England's powerful lower-middle order propelled the side to a 113-run first-innings lead.

Strauss contributed 55 to England's first innings of 332, before [[Stuart Broad]] (5\u201337) and [[Graeme Swann]] (4\u201338) unexpectedly combined to bowl Australia out for 160. In the second innings Strauss scored 75, sharing a 128-run partnership with debutant [[Jonathan Trott]] (119) to set Australia a target of 546. On the final day of the series, Strauss produced a sharp piece of fielding from leg slip to [[run out]] Michael Clarke for a duck, and also contributed a catch, as Australia were bowled out for 348 to hand England a 197-run victory in the match, a 2\u20131 victory in the series, and the Ashes.\n\nStrauss was named England's man of the series by Australian coach [[Tim Nielsen]]; he finished the series with an aggregate of 474 runs (the highest aggregate by either side; no other England player managed more than 261), at an average of 52.66 (no other England player barring [[Jonathan Trott]], who only played in one match, averaged more than 40).

They beat Sri Lanka and South Africa to unexpectedly reach the semi-finals, however Strauss only managed a top-score of 25. He did not fare much better in the ODI series [[English cricket team in South Africa in 2009\u201310|against South Africa]], which England won 2\u20131. England drew the Test series 1\u20131, however Strauss passed 50 just once.\n\nAfter the tour to South Africa, Strauss was controversially rested for the subsequent [[English cricket team in Bangladesh in 2009\u201310|tour of Bangladesh]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/bdeshveng2010/content/story/444883.html|title=Cook to captain in Bangladesh Tests|publisher=CricInfo.co.uk|date=18 January 2010 }}</ref> In his stead, [[Alastair Cook]] was named captain and [[Michael Carberry]] selected as a replacement opener (though [[Jonathan Trott]] was promoted to opener for the second Test, replacing Carberry). England then won the [[2010 ICC World Twenty20]] in the West Indies under the leadership of Paul Collingwood.\n\nStrauss returned to the Test team in the [[Bangladeshi cricket team in England in 2010|home series against Bangladesh]]. He made two half-centuries as England won the two match series. Between the Tests and the ODI series, England played Australia in a [[Australian cricket team in England in 2010|five match ODI series]] (this was due to Bangladesh's participation in the [[2010 Asia Cup]] during June). England won the series, with Strauss making half-centuries in the second and third games. When Bangladesh returned for the ODI series, Strauss scored a half-century in the first game and a career-best 154 in the third, in which he shared a stand of 250 with [[Jonathan Trott]] who also made a century. England won the three-match series 2\u20131, and Strauss was named Player of the Series. In the accompanying ODI Series Strauss made 126 in the 2nd match of a 5 match series.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/8991947.stm|title=Strauss makes 5th Career ODI Century against Pakistan |work=BBC Sport  |date=18 January 2010 | first=Jamie | last=Lillywhite}}</ref>\n\nA [[2010 Pakistan cricket spot-fixing controversy|controversial]] series [[Pakistani cricket team in England in 2010|against Pakistan]] followed. Strauss struggled for form in the Test series, with just one half-century, as England won 3\u20131, bowling Pakistan out for three sub-100 scores. He found form in the five-match ODI series though, with a century and two fifties as England won 3\u20132 in their final series before the [[2010-11 Ashes series]].\n\n====The Ashes (2010\u201311)====\nStrauss headed to the [[2010\u201311 Ashes series]] hoping to join [[Mike Brearley]] and [[Len Hutton]] as the only England captains to win the Ashes both home and away, and the first to win an Ashes series in Australia since [[Mike Gatting]] in 1986-7. \nStrauss won the toss on the opening morning at [[the Gabba]] ([[Brisbane]]) and elected to bat, however was caught at gully for a third-ball duck. England's first innings total of 260 was not enough, and Australia built a 221-run first innings lead. Despite the large deficit, England fought back; Strauss and Cook scored 188 for the first wicket. Strauss made his 19th Test hundred, eventually out for 110; stumped for the first time in his Test career. Fellow-opener Cook scored an unbeaten 235 and [[Jonathan Trott]] 135, also unbeaten, as England declared at 517\u20131. Australia scored 107\u20131 in their second innings before a draw was declared.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/the-ashes-2010-11/content/story/489584.html |title=Australia v England, 1st Test, Brisbane, 5th day: England break records in high-scoring draw|publisher=ESPN Cricinfo|date=|accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the second test match at the Adelaide Oval, Ricky Ponting won the toss and chose to bat but Strauss' bowlers skittled the Aussies for 245, thanks to James Anderson's 4\u201351 . England then made 620\u20135 before declaring but Strauss was out for 1 in that innings. England then bowled Australia out again for 304, with Graeme Swann taking 5\u201391 and England winning by an innings and 71 runs.\n\nIn the third test match at Perth, Strauss won the toss and chose to bowl first. England bowled Australia out for 268 on day one and Strauss scored 12* to guide England to 29\u20130 at stumps. Strauss started well and guided England to 78\u20130 within the first hour of the day's play but a batting collapse saw England bowled out for 187, thanks to Mitchell Johnson's 6\u201338. England struck back and took three Aussie wickets but Australia got to stumps on day two on 119\u20133. Strauss' team then bowled the Aussies out for 309, meaning England required 391 to win but batted poorly to be bowled out for just 123, with Ryan Harris taking 6\u201349 and England losing by 267 runs.\n\nStrauss won the toss at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] and elected to bowl on the Boxing Day Test. The decision was an inspired one as England bowled Australia out for 98. In reply, Strauss and Cook had made a 159-run opening stand with Strauss passing 6,000 Test runs before being caught for 69. After England made 513, they bowled Australia out for 258 to win by an innings and 157 runs, therefore retaining the Ashes.\n\nIn the fifth and final Test at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]] in Sydney, Strauss lost the toss and [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]], Australian captain in the absence of the injured Ponting, elected to bat. England bowled Australia out for 280. In reply, Strauss made 60 from just 58 balls before being bowled by [[Ben Hilfenhaus]]. England continued to make a score of 644 their highest score on Australian soil, thanks to centuries from [[Alastair Cook]], [[Ian Bell]] and [[Matt Prior]]. Australia fell for 281 in their second innings, handing England a third win by an innings in the series, and an overall 3\u20131 Ashes victory.\n\n====2011 World Cup====\n[[File:Strauss Somerset.jpg|thumb|upright|Strauss batting for Somerset against the touring Indians in July 2011]]\nIn England's opening match of the ICC World cup 2011 against Netherlands, Andrew Strauss hit a better than run-a-ball 88 to get England off to a good start and help them clinch a 6 wicket victory.

The English bowlers derailed the strong Proteas batting lineup, which collapsed from 63 for no loss and lost all their wickets for 102 runs. However, the group stage ended in another shock defeat, this time to Bangladesh, and although England qualified for the quarter-finals, they were comprehensively beaten by Sri Lanka.

In late 2007, Strauss was not included in the Test squad for the tour of Sri Lanka, and [[Michael Vaughan]] was selected to take his position as opening batsman. Strauss then announced that he was going to take a break from cricket after what he described as a \"long, tiring and immensely frustrating 12 months.\" He was, however, able to travel to India as part of the backup squad if he so wished.<ref name=rest/>\n\nStrauss was thus omitted from England cricket fixtures over the winter.

In the second innings, however, he reached a century from 226 deliveries, his slowest but his first since August 2006, going on to make his highest score in Test cricket, 177. This innings seemed to help Strauss re-find his spark as in the first part of the English domestic season that followed he scored runs prolifically for Middlesex, smashing a 163 off 130 balls against Surrey in a domestic one day match.\n\n====New Zealand and South Africa tour England====\nAfter his 177, Strauss's place in the side was guaranteed for the following series against the same opposition. While still ignored for the One Day International team he was given back his position of Test opener alongside Alastair Cook, Michael Vaughan going back down to number 3. In the first rain affected match at Lords he carried on his form with a slow but steady 63 in the only England innings of the match. In the second Test Strauss made another 60 before getting out giving England a decent start following a big first innings total. He then went on to make 106, chasing 294, in the second innings on a now difficult batting wicket which set England up to win by 6 wickets to take a 1\u20130 lead in the three match series. This was Strauss's second Test match century at Old Trafford (the first coming against Australia in 2005, when he also scored 106). In the third and final Test at Trent Bridge he made 37 in England's first and only innings as England went on to win the series 2\u20130. He was named England's man of the series for his 266 runs at an average of 66.50.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/7420284.stm ''Strauss ton inspires England win''] from [[BBC News]] retrieved 26 May 2008</ref>\n\nHis form now impressing the selectors, Strauss was allowed to keep his place for the tour against South Africa. He started on an average note being dismissed for 44 in England's only innings of the first match. He suffered in the second Test at Headlingly, however, making just 27 runs in the first innings and a duck in the second. A pair of 20s resulted as Strauss continued to struggle against the pace bowling of South Africa in the third Test. With England 2\u20130 down going into the last Test, a win was needed to restore pride. Strauss failed in the first innings, being dismissed for six. With the bowlers having got England into a match winning position, Strauss then came good, sharing a century opening stand with Cook and eventually being dismissed for 58. Nevertheless, his place remained under pressure again.\n\n====2008 Tour of India====\nStrauss managed to keep his place for the India tour and immediately rewarded the selectors by making 123 in the first innings of the first Test match with the rest of the batting lagging behind. He followed it up by holding the batting order together after a collapse that saw England 43\u20133 and shared a 200 run partnership with Paul Collingwood in which Strauss and Collingwood both made 108. He became just the 10th Englishman to make two hundreds in the same Test match, with Marcus Trescothick being the last in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/282951.html|title=  Records / Test matches / Batting records / Hundred in each innings of a match |publisher=CricInfo|accessdate=22 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Captaincy====\nStrauss was appointed captain on 7 January 2009 after a rift between previous captain [[Kevin Pietersen]] and Peter Moores became public.

Strauss contributed 32 to England's second innings, as Australia were set a target of 522 to win, a record if achieved. Though Michael Clarke (136), [[Brad Haddin]] (80) and [[Mitchell Johnson (cricketer)|Mitchell Johnson]] (63) briefly made the target seem attainable, [[Andrew Flintoff]] (5\u201392) and [[Graeme Swann]] (4\u201387) bowled England to a comfortable 115-run victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/345971.html |title=England v Australia at Lord's, 2nd Test, 2009 |publisher=Cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the third Test at [[Edgbaston cricket ground|Edgbaston]], Strauss responded to Australia's first innings of 263 by ending the second day 64 not out; he was removed by [[Ben Hilfenhaus]] the following morning for 69, before England's powerful lower-middle order propelled the side to a 113-run first-innings lead.

Strauss contributed 55 to England's first innings of 332, before [[Stuart Broad]] (5\u201337) and [[Graeme Swann]] (4\u201338) unexpectedly combined to bowl Australia out for 160. In the second innings Strauss scored 75, sharing a 128-run partnership with debutant [[Jonathan Trott]] (119) to set Australia a target of 546. On the final day of the series, Strauss produced a sharp piece of fielding from leg slip to [[run out]] Michael Clarke for a duck, and also contributed a catch, as Australia were bowled out for 348 to hand England a 197-run victory in the match, a 2\u20131 victory in the series, and the Ashes.\n\nStrauss was named England's man of the series by Australian coach [[Tim Nielsen]]; he finished the series with an aggregate of 474 runs (the highest aggregate by either side; no other England player managed more than 261), at an average of 52.66 (no other England player barring [[Jonathan Trott]], who only played in one match, averaged more than 40).

Strauss' team then bowled the Aussies out for 309, meaning England required 391 to win but batted poorly to be bowled out for just 123, with Ryan Harris taking 6\u201349 and England losing by 267 runs.\n\nStrauss won the toss at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]] and elected to bowl on the Boxing Day Test. The decision was an inspired one as England bowled Australia out for 98. In reply, Strauss and Cook had made a 159-run opening stand with Strauss passing 6,000 Test runs before being caught for 69. After England made 513, they bowled Australia out for 258 to win by an innings and 157 runs, therefore retaining the Ashes.\n\nIn the fifth and final Test at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]] in Sydney, Strauss lost the toss and [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]], Australian captain in the absence of the injured Ponting, elected to bat. England bowled Australia out for 280. In reply, Strauss made 60 from just 58 balls before being bowled by [[Ben Hilfenhaus]]. England continued to make a score of 644 their highest score on Australian soil, thanks to centuries from [[Alastair Cook]], [[Ian Bell]] and [[Matt Prior]]. Australia fell for 281 in their second innings, handing England a third win by an innings in the series, and an overall 3\u20131 Ashes victory.\n\n====2011 World Cup====\n[[File:Strauss Somerset.jpg|thumb|upright|Strauss batting for Somerset against the touring Indians in July 2011]]\nIn England's opening match of the ICC World cup 2011 against Netherlands, Andrew Strauss hit a better than run-a-ball 88 to get England off to a good start and help them clinch a 6 wicket victory. He maintained this good form the next game, scoring an impressive 158 off 145 chasing an imposing 339 which hosts India had set them. The match ended in a thrilling tie.<ref>{{cite web|last=Amla |first=Hashim |url=http://iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com/2011/02/england-vs-india-bangalore-27th.html |title=Cricket Matches: England vs India (Bangalore) (27th February) |publisher=Iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com |date=27 February 2011 |accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref>\nThe third game saw Strauss score 34 off 37 balls as scored 327 against Ireland, but England nonetheless suffered a shock defeat, thanks to a 50-ball 100 by Kevin O'Brien and a 162-run partnership for the 6th wicket.<ref>{{cite web|last=Amla |first=Hashim |url=http://iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com/2011/03/england-vs-ireland-bangalore-2nd-march.html |title=Cricket Matches: England vs Ireland (Bangalore) (2nd March) |publisher=Iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com |date=2 March 2011 |accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref>\nEngland then won a thrilling match against South Africa on 6 March, bowling their opponents out for 165 in Chennai to defend a low score of 171, with Stuart Broad claiming 4 vital wickets. The English bowlers derailed the strong Proteas batting lineup, which collapsed from 63 for no loss and lost all their wickets for 102 runs. However, the group stage ended in another shock defeat, this time to Bangladesh, and although England qualified for the quarter-finals, they were comprehensively beaten by Sri Lanka. Strauss duly stepped down from the ODI captaincy and retired from One Day International Cricket.<ref>{{cite web|last=Amla |first=Hashim |url=http://iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com/2011/03/england-vs-south-africa-chennai-6th.html |title=Cricket Matches: England vs South Africa (Chennai) (6th March) |publisher=Iccworld-cup2011.blogspot.com |date=6 March 2011 |accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref>\n\n====Retirement====\nStrauss announced his retirement from cricket on 29 August 2012 after 100 test appearances. As a token of appreciation, his teammates bought him 100 bottles of wine, of which he said \"I think that will furnish me nicely into retirement!\" [[Alastair Cook]], his vice-captain and opening partner, was named as his successor.

I want to have a smile on my face when I'm playing cricket, and, if I'd have kept going, I'm not sure that would have been the case.\"<ref>[http://www.cricketworld.com/michael-vaughan-stands-down-as-england-test-captain/16684.htm Michael Vaughan Stands Down As England Test Captain], Cricket World.

More important, however, was his form in the longest version of the game, in which he had attained something like a peak. Going into the 2009 Ashes, indeed, he was relishing his best-ever run in the Test side, having hoarded three centuries in his last twelve innings.<ref>Hoult, Nick. \"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/cricket/international/theashes/5601764/Ashes-2009-England-squad-form-guide.html Ashes 2009: England squad form guide.\"] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. 22 June 2009.

On a flat wicket, however, this was put into context by the Australians, who amassed 674 for 6 declared, with four centurions; Collingwood bowled nine overs, and claimed the wicket of [[Brad Haddin]] caught at deep midwicket. In reply, England slid to 70 for 5 and seemed certain to succumb to an innings defeat. In response, Collingwood stayed at the crease for 5\u00be hours (nearly the whole of the final day) and top-scored for England with 74 runs from 245 balls. He was ninth man out, edging [[Peter Siddle]] to gully, but final pair [[James Anderson (cricketer)|James Anderson]] and [[Monty Panesar]] blocked out the final 11\u00bd overs of the match to secure an improbable draw.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cricinfo.com/engvaus2009/engine/current/match/345970.html |title=England v Australia at Cardiff, 2009 |publisher=Cricinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the second Test at [[Lord's]] Collingwood succumbed to a loose first-innings dismissal, chipping part-time spinner [[Michael Clarke (cricketer)|Michael Clarke]] to mid-on for 16 (and earning the ire of his captain [[Andrew Strauss]], who went on to score 161); England, poised at 302 for 3 before Collingwood's dismissal, subsided to 425 all out. Nonetheless, England's seamers bowled Australia out for 215, and in the second innings Collingwood scored a measured 54, acting as foil to the aggressive strokeplay of [[Matt Prior]] (their partnership adding 86 in twelve overs) and [[Andrew Flintoff]] (51 in eight overs).
