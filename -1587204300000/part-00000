When the riders find Ryker, he tells them that Viggo is setting them up and he can give them the Dragon Eye as the Berserkers are attacked by the Shell Fire, a giant sea dragon equipped with Hunter weaponry.

The Shell Fire is freed and Ryker is consumed with the fleet by the Submaripper, while Viggo turns on Hiccup threatening to kill Astrid in exchange for the Dragon Eye, but Hiccup throws the Eye into the volcano and Viggo rushes to the edge chasing after it.

The first season included 60 episodes and concluded its initial airing on May 23, 1994.

Together they continue to foil Rita's plans along with her henchmen Goldar (Sakamoto), her second in command, Squatt and Baboo (Watanabe, Kusaka) the bumbling duo, and Finster (Iiboshi), the maker of most of their monsters.

The fictional series follows events in the lives of five, later six, teenagers with superpowers, who were chosen by the wise sage [[Zordon]] to become Power Rangers in order to stop the evil [[Rita Repulsa]] from taking over the planet Earth. The first season included 60 episodes and concluded its initial airing on May 23, 1994. The first season of MMPR uses footage and elements from the [[Super Sentai]] series ''[[Ky\u014dry\u016b Sentai Zyuranger]].''\n\n==Synopsis==\nThe season's stories focus on five teenagers: [[Jason Lee Scott]] ([[Austin St. John]]), [[Trini Kwan]] ([[Thuy Trang]]), [[Zack Taylor]] ([[Walter Emanuel Jones]]), [[Kimberly Hart]] ([[Amy Jo Johnson]]), and [[Billy Cranston]] ([[David Yost]]), who are given the ability to morph into \"Power Rangers\" by Zordon (David Fielding) in order to put a stop to Rita Repulsa's ([[Machiko Soga]], voice of [[Barbara Goodson]]) evil schemes. Later during the season, [[Tommy Oliver]] ([[Jason David Frank]]) is introduced as a villain, but later becomes the sixth member of the team. Together they continue to foil Rita's plans along with her henchmen Goldar (Sakamoto), her second in command, Squatt and Baboo (Watanabe, Kusaka) the bumbling duo, and Finster (Iiboshi), the maker of most of their monsters. Meanwhile, [[Bulk and Skull]] ([[Paul Schrier]], [[Jason Narvy]]) act as comic relief, at Angel Grove High, where the Rangers attend high school.\n\n==Episodes==\n<!--The correct order is not by airdates or production code.

The heads are usually agreeable, but can have difficulty flying when their riders disagree, and sometimes quarrel as a result.\n\n===Notable inhabitants of Berk===\n* Stoick the Vast (voiced by [[Nolan North]]<ref>{{cite news|title=Dragons of Berk will retain most of the movie cast, Nolan North takes over for Gerard Butler & Chris Edgerly replaces Craig Ferguson.|url=https://twitter.com/JEFFBM/status/223496320479014912|accessdate=July 13, 2012|newspaper=Twitter|date=July 12, 2012|author=JEFF B}}</ref>) \u2013 The [[Tribal chief|Chief]] of Berk and father to Hiccup; immensely strong, fearless, fierce, and possessed of shrewd judgement and compassion.

She rides a Gronckle as part of the A-team.\n* Mildew (voiced by [[Stephen Root]]) \u2013 Mildew is a cantankerous, spiteful, aged and generally disliked Berk local. He is a [[cabbage]] farmer and retains a strong hatred of [[dragon]]s.\n* Bucket (voiced by [[Thomas F.

Prior to ''Dragons: Race to the Edge'' Season 5, he was thought to be an ally of the Dragon Riders. However, in the finale of Season 5, it is revealed that he has been undercover and is secretly working with Krogan to find and control a Bewilderbeast. He meets his end in \"King of Dragons, Part 2\", when the Bewilderbeast uses its ice to freeze him to death.\n* Krogan (voiced by [[Hakeem Kae-Kazim]]) \u2013 The leader of the Dragon Flyers who works for Drago Bludvist.

When he fails to retrieve a Bewilderbeast for his master in \u201cKing of Dragons, Part 2\u201d, Drago has him executed.\n* Viggo Grimborn (voiced by [[Alfred Molina]]) \u2013 The leader of the Dragon Hunters and is usually accompanied by his older brother, Ryker Grimborn. Viggo is less strong than his brother, but for what he lacks in build he makes up for in intellect, frequently tricking and outsmarting the Dragon Riders. In \"Triple Cross\", he is betrayed by Johann and Krogan and has a change of heart before sacrificing himself to allow Hiccup and Toothless to escape.\n* Ryker Grimborn (voiced by [[JB Blanc]]) \u2013 The second-in-command of the Dragon Hunters and the elder brother of Viggo Grimborn.

He later becomes an ally of Berk at the end of Season 2.\n* Heather (voiced by [[Mae Whitman]]) \u2013 A mysterious teenage girl found by the Viking youths. Although she was at first introduced for actions against Berk, her true motive, to rescue her parents from Alvin the Treacherous, proved her loyalty. She returns in Season 3, bonding with a Razorwhip dragon named Windshear. She is later revealed to be Dagur's long-lost sister and pretends to be in league with him in order to get close to him and the newly unveiled dragon hunters. She leaves to parts unknown after her plot is uncovered by Viggo. She soon returns, showing romantic feelings for Fishlegs and joins the Dragon Riders. After being with the Dragon Riders for a while, she decides to leave for Berserker Island with her brother, Dagur.\n* Dagur the Deranged<ref>{{cite news|last=del Carmen|first=Louie|title=It's Dagur the Deranged, not Dagus|url=https://twitter.com/LouiedelCarmen/status/298138367881785344|accessdate=February 5, 2013|newspaper=Twitter|date=February 3, 2013}}</ref> (voiced by [[David Faustino]]<ref name=ComicCon />) \u2013 A villain-turned-ally and leader of the [[Berserker]] Tribe.

Later, Dagur becomes a Dragon Rider with a Gronckle he named Shattermaster, and later on, Sleuther, a Triple Stryke that the Dragon Riders had previously rescued. In Season 6, he falls in love with and eventually marries Mala.\n* Defenders of the Wing \u2013 A tribe of warriors who first appear in the episode \"Defenders of the Wing: Part 1\". They worship dragons as holy beings and are led by Queen Mala (voiced by [[Adelaide Kane]]). They are at war with the Dragon Hunters and are therefore extremely distrusting of outsiders. Prior to encountering the Dragon Riders, they know nothing of riding or training dragons, as their culture forbids it. They live on a volcanic island home to an enormous dragon called the Eruptodon. They worship and protect the Eruptodon at all cost, as it feeds on the volcano's lava and prevents their village from being destroyed. Mala later falls in love with and marries Dagur the Deranged.\n* Wingmaidens \u2013 An exclusively female warrior tribe led by their chieftess Atali (voiced by [[Rose McIver]]) who first appear in the episode \"Snotlout\u2019s Angels\". They care for baby Razorwhips who become their wings until they are old enough to fend for themselves because the adult males of the species would devour the infants and could drive the species to extinction.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of DreamWorks Dragons episodes}}\n{{:List of DreamWorks Dragons episodes}}\n<!-- To edit the content in this section you need to edit the \"List of DreamWorks Dragons episodes\" page -->\n\n==Production==\nOn October 12, 2010, it was announced that [[Cartoon Network]] had acquired worldwide broadcast rights to a weekly animated series based on the movie.<ref name=\"Wire\"/> According to [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim Johnson]], executive producer for ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'', the series was planned to be much darker and deeper than [[DreamWorks Animation]]'s previous television series spin-offs, with a similar tone to the movie, and would follow after the events of the first movie.

Toothless also has the unique ability to navigate in dark places using [[animal echolocation|echolocation]].\n* Astrid Hofferson (voiced by [[America Ferrera]]<ref name=Reuters />) \u2013 Hiccup's close friend and partner; and the unofficial second-in-command of the dragon training academy.

During Season 5 of ''Race to the Edge'', Hiccup gives Astrid a betrothal necklace, making them officially engaged to be married.\n:* Stormfly \u2013 A blue, female Deadly Nadder befriended by Astrid. Like Hiccup and Toothless, Astrid and Stormfly display exceptional teamwork. Stormfly and Toothless share a friendly rivalry in most of the competitions Hiccup and Astrid devise.

Because of her husky size and short wingspan, she lacks the aerobatic maneuverability and speed of the other dragons. She and Fishlegs have a very close, nurturing relationship. She also can eat a particular combination of iron ore and rocks and regurgitate a valuable metal known as \"Gronckle iron\".\n* Snotlout Jorgenson (voiced by [[Zack Pearlman]]) \u2013  One of Hiccup's friends; reckless, quarrelsome, and often seen mocking or annoying the other riders. He has a complicated relationship with his dragon, Hookfang.\n:* Hookfang \u2013 A red, male Monstrous Nightmare, ridden by Snotlout. Hookfang has a habit of attacking Snotlout or abandoning him when Snotlout tries to assert dominance, and does not always pay attention to Snotlout. In battle, Hookfang covers his skin with his flammable saliva and sets it on fire, without harming himself; this ability is almost never used when Snotlout is riding him.\n* Tuffnut Thorston (voiced by [[T.

She rides a Gronckle as part of the A-team.\n* Mildew (voiced by [[Stephen Root]]) \u2013 Mildew is a cantankerous, spiteful, aged and generally disliked Berk local. He is a [[cabbage]] farmer and retains a strong hatred of [[dragon]]s.\n* Bucket (voiced by [[Thomas F. Wilson]]) \u2013 A mentally impaired Viking, named for the bucket he wears on his head, allegedly to conceal a missing part of his brain.

Prior to ''Dragons: Race to the Edge'' Season 5, he was thought to be an ally of the Dragon Riders. However, in the finale of Season 5, it is revealed that he has been undercover and is secretly working with Krogan to find and control a Bewilderbeast. He meets his end in \"King of Dragons, Part 2\", when the Bewilderbeast uses its ice to freeze him to death.\n* Krogan (voiced by [[Hakeem Kae-Kazim]]) \u2013 The leader of the Dragon Flyers who works for Drago Bludvist. His overconfidence often clashes with Viggo's patience. When he fails to retrieve a Bewilderbeast for his master in \u201cKing of Dragons, Part 2\u201d, Drago has him executed.\n* Viggo Grimborn (voiced by [[Alfred Molina]]) \u2013 The leader of the Dragon Hunters and is usually accompanied by his older brother, Ryker Grimborn. Viggo is less strong than his brother, but for what he lacks in build he makes up for in intellect, frequently tricking and outsmarting the Dragon Riders. In \"Triple Cross\", he is betrayed by Johann and Krogan and has a change of heart before sacrificing himself to allow Hiccup and Toothless to escape.\n* Ryker Grimborn (voiced by [[JB Blanc]]) \u2013 The second-in-command of the Dragon Hunters and the elder brother of Viggo Grimborn.

He later becomes an ally of Berk at the end of Season 2.\n* Heather (voiced by [[Mae Whitman]]) \u2013 A mysterious teenage girl found by the Viking youths. Although she was at first introduced for actions against Berk, her true motive, to rescue her parents from Alvin the Treacherous, proved her loyalty. She returns in Season 3, bonding with a Razorwhip dragon named Windshear. She is later revealed to be Dagur's long-lost sister and pretends to be in league with him in order to get close to him and the newly unveiled dragon hunters. She leaves to parts unknown after her plot is uncovered by Viggo. She soon returns, showing romantic feelings for Fishlegs and joins the Dragon Riders. After being with the Dragon Riders for a while, she decides to leave for Berserker Island with her brother, Dagur.\n* Dagur the Deranged<ref>{{cite news|last=del Carmen|first=Louie|title=It's Dagur the Deranged, not Dagus|url=https://twitter.com/LouiedelCarmen/status/298138367881785344|accessdate=February 5, 2013|newspaper=Twitter|date=February 3, 2013}}</ref> (voiced by [[David Faustino]]<ref name=ComicCon />) \u2013 A villain-turned-ally and leader of the [[Berserker]] Tribe. He becomes obsessed with plotting to hunt and capture Toothless. He is later revealed to be the long-lost brother of Heather. After ''Dragons: Race to the Edge'' Season Two, he begins to acknowledge the aims of the Dragon Riders and starts to help them, along with his sister, Heather. Later, Dagur becomes a Dragon Rider with a Gronckle he named Shattermaster, and later on, Sleuther, a Triple Stryke that the Dragon Riders had previously rescued. In Season 6, he falls in love with and eventually marries Mala.\n* Defenders of the Wing \u2013 A tribe of warriors who first appear in the episode \"Defenders of the Wing: Part 1\". They worship dragons as holy beings and are led by Queen Mala (voiced by [[Adelaide Kane]]). They are at war with the Dragon Hunters and are therefore extremely distrusting of outsiders. Prior to encountering the Dragon Riders, they know nothing of riding or training dragons, as their culture forbids it. They live on a volcanic island home to an enormous dragon called the Eruptodon. They worship and protect the Eruptodon at all cost, as it feeds on the volcano's lava and prevents their village from being destroyed. Mala later falls in love with and marries Dagur the Deranged.\n* Wingmaidens \u2013 An exclusively female warrior tribe led by their chieftess Atali (voiced by [[Rose McIver]]) who first appear in the episode \"Snotlout\u2019s Angels\". They care for baby Razorwhips who become their wings until they are old enough to fend for themselves because the adult males of the species would devour the infants and could drive the species to extinction.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of DreamWorks Dragons episodes}}\n{{:List of DreamWorks Dragons episodes}}\n<!-- To edit the content in this section you need to edit the \"List of DreamWorks Dragons episodes\" page -->\n\n==Production==\nOn October 12, 2010, it was announced that [[Cartoon Network]] had acquired worldwide broadcast rights to a weekly animated series based on the movie.<ref name=\"Wire\"/> According to [[Tim Johnson (film director)|Tim Johnson]], executive producer for ''[[How to Train Your Dragon (film)|How to Train Your Dragon]]'', the series was planned to be much darker and deeper than [[DreamWorks Animation]]'s previous television series spin-offs, with a similar tone to the movie, and would follow after the events of the first movie.

His mother, Hamidah, was a former slave from either [[Berber people|Berbery]] or [[Andalusia]]. Al-Kadhim was brought up in a large family, with nine sisters and six brothers. According to [[Twelver]] Shiites, his oldest brother [[Isma'il ibn Jafar|Ismail]] predeceased his father Ja'far al-Sadiq, who held the position of Imam and Musa was chosen by divine order and decree of his father as the next Imam.<ref name=\"Donaldson\"/>\n\nAccording to some sources, al-Kadhim was religiously minded as a child. [[Muhammad Baqir Majlisi]] relates an incident where [[Ab\u016b \u1e24an\u012bfa]] called on [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] to ask his advice. While there, he encountered al-Kadhim, who was then five years old. Hanifa asked al-Kadhim the question meant for his father, saying: \"Boy, from whom does disobedience (issue)? Does it issue from Allah or from the servant?\" Al-Kadhim answered, saying: \"Either it issues from God and not from the servant at all, so God does not punish the servant for what he does not do; or it issues from the servant and God, and God is a stronger partner. Therefore, the stronger partner has no right to punish the weak for a sin in which they are equal; or it issues from the servant and not from God. So if He wills to pardon (him), (He will pardon him), and if He wills to punish (him), (He will punish him); and God is He whose help is sought.\" Upon hearing this, Hanifa left, saying that the answer had been good enough for him.{{efn|See Al-Murteda, Amali, vol. 1, pp. 105-106, and Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 4, p. 1049}}<ref>{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi2|2000|p=69}}</ref>\n[[File:Al-Kadhimiya Mosque, Kadhmain Shrine.jpg|300px|thumbnail|[[Al-Kadhimiya Mosque]], in Kadhimiya]] \nIn another incident, [[Ab\u016b \u1e24an\u012bfa]] complained to al-Sadiq, saying: \"I have seen your son, Musa, pray while the people were passing (walking) before him. He did not prevent them from that.\"{{efn|Muslims are instructed to say their prayer toward a point called [[Qibla]], a point that symbolizes the unity of God. So it is not appropriate traditionally to walk in front of someone who is directing his face toward Qibla.}} The Imam ordered his son to be brought before him, and asked him whether it was true. Al-Khadhim replied \"Yes, father, the [[God in Islam|One]] to Whom I pray is nearer to me than them;{{efn|Meaning \"people walking before me does not prevent me from facing God, as God is not at [[Qibla]] or in [[Kaaba]] as people might imagine, but He is with me\".}} [[God in Islam|Allah]], the Great and Almighty, says: ''[[God in Islam|We]] are nearer to him than the jugular vein.''\"{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#50:16 Quran, 50:16]}} On hearing this response, the Imam rose, hugged his son, and said; \"May my father and mother be your ransom, O he in whom secrets have been deposited!\"<ref>{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi2|2000|p=198}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Dungersi |first1=Mohamed Raza |title=A Brief Biography of Imam Musa bin Jafar (a.s.): al-Kadhim |publisher=Bilal Muslim Mission of Tanzania, 1996 |isbn=9789976956931 |page=4-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/A_Brief_Biography_of_Imam_Musa_bin_Jafar.html?id=uYlkAwAAQBAJ}}</ref>\n\n==Imamate==\n\nMusa al-Kadhim was said to be a gentle and tolerant man.

He approached him, but the man shouted at him not to walk on his plants. The Imam paid no attention and when he reached him, sat beside him and treated him kindly, asking how much had the man paid to sow his land. \"One hundred dinars,\" said the man. \"How much do you hope to acquire from it?\" asked the Imam. \"I do not know the unknown,\" said the man. \"I only asked you about what you hope it would bring you,\" insisted the Imam.

When Jafar al-Sadiq was poisoned, the Caliph [[Al-Mansur]] wanted to end the [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|imamah]], and so he wrote to the governor of [[Medina]] to behead the person that al-Sadiq had named as his successor in his last testament. When he read the testament, however, the governor of Medina saw that the Imam had chosen four people rather than one: the [[caliph]] himself, the governor of Medina, the Imam's older son [[Abdullah al-Aftah]], and Musa, his younger son. As a result, Mansur was unable to end the imamate. However, unlike his father who had been able to teach freely in Medina, Musa al-Kadhim lived with tight restrictions set by Abbasid caliphs, such as al-Mansur and Harun al-Rashid.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brief History of Fourteen Infallibles |url=https://www.al-islam.org/brief-history-fourteen-infallibles/eighth-infallible-sixth-imam |publisher=World Organization for Islamic Services (WOFIS)}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Tabatabai|1975|pp=180\u2013181}}</ref>  Musa al-Kadhim never accepted Harun's government, because he believed al- Rashid sought to destroy Islam by erasing the truth and effacing justice.

Finally, another group considered Ja'far al-Sadiq to be the last Imam. After the death of Musa al-Kadhim, the majority followed his son, [[Ali al-Ridha]], while the rest believed that al-Kadhim was the last Imam.

The Imam replied, asking \"If the Prophet was raised from the dead and proposed to your daughter, would you respond to him?\" \"Rather I would through that pride myself on the Arabs, the non-Arabs, and [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]],\" answered al-Rashid. \"But he would not propose (to my daughter) and I would not marry (her) to him,\" said the Imam, \"because he begot me and did not beget you.\" Al-Rashid, however, was not satisfied with this answer, insisting that \"the progeny belongs to the male and not to the female\", and that the Imams were Muhammad's daughter's children.{{efn|The argument here is whether women count when reckoning ancestry.}}<ref name=\"Sharif al-Qarashi2 200-202\">{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi2|2000|pp=200\u2013202}}</ref>\n\nThe Imam quoted from the Quran, stating that in the Quran, God had said: \"and of his descendants, David and Solomon, [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]], [[Joseph]], [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]]; and thus do We reward those who do good. And [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] and [[John the Baptist]], and [[Jesus]] and [[Elijah|Elias]]: All in the company of the righteous\"{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#6:84 Quran, 6:84,85]}} \"Who is Jesus's father, O Commander of the faithful?\" asked the Imam. \"Jesus had no father,\" said al-Rashid. The Imam argued that God had ascribed Jesus to the descendants of the prophets through [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]; \"similarly, we have been ascribed to the descendants of the Prophet through our mother [[Fatimah]],\" said the Imam.<ref name=\"Sharif al-Qarashi2 200-202\"/> Nevertheless, al-Rashid asked the Imam to give him more evidence and proof, so he put forward another quote from the Quran, reciting the verse: \"But whoever disputes with you in this matter after what has come to you of knowledge, then say: Come, let us call our sons and your sons and our women and your women and ourselves and yourselves, then let us be earnest in prayer, and pray for the curse of Allah on the liars.\"{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#3:61 Quran, 3:61]}} Then he said: \"None claims that the Prophet made someone enter under [[Ahl al-Kisa|the cloak]] when he challenged the Christians to a contest of prayer to God ([[Event of Mubahala|mubahala]]) except [[Ali]], [[Fatimah]], [[Hasan ibn Ali|al-Hasan]], and [[Husayn ibn Ali|al-Husayn]]. Therefore the explanation of the verse is: Our sons are al-Hasan and al-Husayn; our women is [[Fatimah]]; ourselves is [[Ali]].\"{{efn|For more information see the [[Event of Mubahala]]}}<ref name=\"Sharif al-Qarashi2 200-202\"/>\n\n===With Bishr al-Hafi===\nAnother incident concerns [[Bishr the Barefoot|Bishr al-Hafi]], who led a [[Bacchic]] life. Once in the midst of the noise, music, alcoholic drink and frivolity, Musa al-Kadhim happened to pass by his house in Baghdad. Al-Kadhim saw a slave girl coming out of the house carrying some sweepings. He turned to the slave and asked her: \"Is the owner of this house free or a servant?\" \"He is free,\" she replied. \"You are right,\" responded Musa al-Kadhim, \"if he was a servant, he would fear his Lord.\"<ref name=\"Sharif al-Qarashi130\"/> The slave girl came into the house while al-Hafi was still at the wine table: \"What delayed you?\" asked al-Hafi. She informed him of what had happened between her and the Imam. It is said that al-Hafi rushed to the door barefooted but the Imam had already left, so he left in search of the Imam, and when he found him, asked him to repeat his words. Al-Hafi was so taken aback by the Imam's words that he fell on the ground and began to cry. \"No, I am a slave, I am a slave.\" From then on, he would walk without shoes and people would call him Bishr al-Hafi (The barefooted one). When asked why he did not wear shoes, he would say that he was guided while he was barefoot, so he would remain in that condition till death.<ref name=\"Sharif al-Qarashi130\">{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi2|2000|p=130}}</ref>\n\n===With a monk===\nA final incident concerned Al-Abbas (born Hilal al-Shami), who said to Musa al-Kadhim that people admired those who ate simple food, wore coarse clothes, and showed reverence. For that reason, the Imam reminded him of [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]], who had been a prophet; however, Joseph had worn silk mantles decorated with gold, and sat on the thrones of the Pharaohs. \"The people were in no need of his clothes, but they were in need of his justice,\" said the Imam. \"An [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imam]] is required to be just and fair; when he says something, he says the truth; when he promises something, he fulfills his promise; when he passes a judgement, he judges equitably. Allah has not forbidden wearing a particular type of clothes or eating a particular type of food earned through a lawful way; rather He has forbidden the unlawful, little or much.\" Then he recited the verse: \"Say: Who has forbidden the beautiful (gifts) of Allah which He has produced for His servants, and the agreeable things of the sustenance.\"{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#7:32 Quran, 7:32]}}<ref>{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi2|2000|p=214}}</ref>\n\n==Imprisonments and death==\n\n===First imprisonment===\nMusa al-Kadhim was imprisoned multiple times during his lifetime. The first time, Caliph [[al-Mahdi]] had him arrested and brought to [[Baghdad]]. According to [[Ibn Khallikan]], \"This Caliph had a dream in which [[Ali ibn Abu Talib]] appeared to him and said, 'O Muhammad, were ye ready therefore, if ye had been put in authority, to commit evil in the earth, and to violate the ties of blood?{{'\"}}{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#47:22 Quran, 47:22]}} [[Al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi']] says: \"He sent for me at night and that put me in great dread. I went to him and found him chanting the above verse and no man had a finer voice than he. He said to me, 'Bring me Musa ibn Ja'far.' I did so and he embraced him, seated him by his side and said to him, 'Abul-Hasan, I have just seen in a dream the Commander of the Faithful, Ali ibn Abu Talib, and he has recited to me such and such a verse; give me the assurance that you will not revolt against me or against any of my children.' He answered, 'By Allah, I am incapable of revolting.' 'You say the truth!' replied the Caliph, 'give him three thousand pieces of gold and restore him to his family in [[Medina]].' I arranged the affair of his departure that very night, lest some obstacle might turn up, and before morning the man was on his journey.\"{{efn|[[Ibn Khallikan]], ''Deaths of Eminent Men'', trans. de Slane}}<ref name=\"Donaldson\"/>\n\n===Second imprisonment===\nAl-Kadhim's second imprisonment was a result of his argument with al-Rashid over descent from Muhammad. Al-Khuzai, the head of the palace guards, narrated a dream the Caliph supposedly had, which made him release the Imam: \"A messenger came to me from al-Rashid,\" he said, \"at an hour in which I never before received his visits; he pulled me from the place where I was and would not even allow me to change my clothes. This put me in great fear. When I arrived at the palace, I found the Caliph sitting up in his bed. I saluted him, but he kept silent for some time; so my mind was much troubled and my fears greatly augmented. At length he said, 'Do you know why I sent for you at such an hour?' I answered, 'By Allah, I do not, [[Amir al-Mu'minin|Commander of the Faithful]].' 'Know,' said he, 'that I just had a dream in which it seemed to me as if an [[Habesha people|Abyssinian]] came to me with a javelin in his hand and said to me: \"Let Musa ibn Ja'far be set at liberty this very hour, otherwise I shall slay thee with this javelin.\" Do you therefore go and get him set free.' I replied, 'Commander of the Faithful, shall I then liberate Musa the son of Ja'far?' 'Yes,' said he, 'go and set Musa ibn Ja'far at liberty. Give him thirty thousand [[dirhem]]s and say to him in my name, if you would like to remain with us you will obtain from me whatever you desire, but if you prefer going to [[Medina]] you have permission to do so.' I went to the prison and found the Imam waiting for me. 'Whilst I was asleep,' he said, 'behold the Apostle of God came to me and said, O Musa, thou hast been imprisoned unjustly; so recite the words I am going to repeat to thee, for assuredly thou shalt not pass all this night in prison.{{'\"}}{{efn|This narration continues as follows:I replied, \"For\nthee I should give up father and mother, what must I say?\" \n\"Repeat these words,\" said he: \n\"o thou who hearest every voice! \no thou who lettest no opportunity escape! \no thou who clothest the bones with flesh \nand who wilt raise them up after death! \nI invoke thee by thy holy name, and by that \ngreat and awful name which is treasured up \nand closely hidden, by that name which no \ncreated thing shall ever know I \no thou who art so mild and whose patience \nis never equalled! \no thou whose favours never cease and can \nnot be numbered, set me free!\" \nSo you see what happened.<ref name=\"Donaldson\"/>}}{{efn|See [[Al-Masudi]], [[The Meadows of Gold|Muruju'l-Dhahab]], vi, p. 308; and [[Ibn Khallikan]], ''Deaths of Eminent Men'', trans. de Slane}}<ref name=\"Donaldson\"/>\n\n===Final imprisonment===\n[[File:Wooden box of the shrine of Imam Musa al-Kadhim, made 6th century AH, Iraq Museum in Baghdad.jpg|thumb|Wooden box of the shrine of Imam Musa al-Kadhim, made 6th century AH, Iraq Museum in Baghdad]]\nAl-Fakhri states the reason for his final imprisonment was that \"there were some of the relatives of Musa ibn Ja'far who were envious of him and carried false reports about him to al-Rashid, saying, 'The people are paying him the [[Khums]], or one-fifth of their property, on accepting the [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imamah]], and he is about to come forth against you.' They brought this report to al-Rashid so frequently that it made him anxious and agitated. In that year al-Rashid went on the pilgrimage, and when he arrived in Medina, he arrested Musa ibn Ja'far, and brought him to Baghdad in a litter, and imprisoned him under the care of al-Sindi ibn Sha'hik.\"{{efn|See Al-Fakhri (Ibnu'l-Tiktil'ni), in the Adab al-Sultaniyya, Chrestomathie Arabe, Silvestre de Sacy, i, text, p. 7, and translation, p. 6.}}<ref name=\"Donaldson\"/>\n \nAl-Fakhri adds \"Al-Rashid was at [[Rakka Eyalet|Rakka]] when he sent orders that the Imam should be put to death. They then brought a number of reputable men to [[Karkh]] to act as coroners and to testify publicly that he had died a natural death. He, then, was buried in the cemetery of Quraish on the south side of Baghdad.\" The implication made by the Shi'a is that he was poisoned. It was narrated that he was tortured for many years during each stay in prison. The most severe imprisonment was under Sindhi. It was narrated that he used to put him in a grave-like jail, where it would be difficult to distinguish night from day. It is narrated that Imam Musa Kadhim used to put his nose near the door in hopes of breathing but Sindhi would slam the door violently, injuring him severely. He was then eventually poisoned by dates and was forced to eat them by Sindhi. The place he was buried was a cemetery, but soon this place became the focus of pilgrimage to the grave of the Imam. A town grew around the graveyard. The name of the town became [[Kadhimiya]] (the town of the Imam Kadhim). A reputed school of theology was founded in this town; the school is still a source of learning for many students from all over the world.<ref name=\"Tabatabai\"/><ref name=\"Donaldson\"/>\n\n==Selected sayings==\n* \"Allah has two proofs over men: outward proof and inward one.

His mother, Hamidah, was a former slave from either [[Berber people|Berbery]] or [[Andalusia]]. Al-Kadhim was brought up in a large family, with nine sisters and six brothers. According to [[Twelver]] Shiites, his oldest brother [[Isma'il ibn Jafar|Ismail]] predeceased his father Ja'far al-Sadiq, who held the position of Imam and Musa was chosen by divine order and decree of his father as the next Imam.<ref name=\"Donaldson\"/>\n\nAccording to some sources, al-Kadhim was religiously minded as a child. [[Muhammad Baqir Majlisi]] relates an incident where [[Ab\u016b \u1e24an\u012bfa]] called on [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] to ask his advice. While there, he encountered al-Kadhim, who was then five years old. Hanifa asked al-Kadhim the question meant for his father, saying: \"Boy, from whom does disobedience (issue)? Does it issue from Allah or from the servant?\" Al-Kadhim answered, saying: \"Either it issues from God and not from the servant at all, so God does not punish the servant for what he does not do; or it issues from the servant and God, and God is a stronger partner. Therefore, the stronger partner has no right to punish the weak for a sin in which they are equal; or it issues from the servant and not from God. So if He wills to pardon (him), (He will pardon him), and if He wills to punish (him), (He will punish him); and God is He whose help is sought.\" Upon hearing this, Hanifa left, saying that the answer had been good enough for him.{{efn|See Al-Murteda, Amali, vol. 1, pp. 105-106, and Bihar al-Anwar, vol. 4, p. 1049}}<ref>{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi2|2000|p=69}}</ref>\n[[File:Al-Kadhimiya Mosque, Kadhmain Shrine.jpg|300px|thumbnail|[[Al-Kadhimiya Mosque]], in Kadhimiya]] \nIn another incident, [[Ab\u016b \u1e24an\u012bfa]] complained to al-Sadiq, saying: \"I have seen your son, Musa, pray while the people were passing (walking) before him. He did not prevent them from that.\"{{efn|Muslims are instructed to say their prayer toward a point called [[Qibla]], a point that symbolizes the unity of God.

He approached him, but the man shouted at him not to walk on his plants. The Imam paid no attention and when he reached him, sat beside him and treated him kindly, asking how much had the man paid to sow his land. \"One hundred dinars,\" said the man. \"How much do you hope to acquire from it?\" asked the Imam. \"I do not know the unknown,\" said the man. \"I only asked you about what you hope it would bring you,\" insisted the Imam.

When Jafar al-Sadiq was poisoned, the Caliph [[Al-Mansur]] wanted to end the [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|imamah]], and so he wrote to the governor of [[Medina]] to behead the person that al-Sadiq had named as his successor in his last testament. When he read the testament, however, the governor of Medina saw that the Imam had chosen four people rather than one: the [[caliph]] himself, the governor of Medina, the Imam's older son [[Abdullah al-Aftah]], and Musa, his younger son. As a result, Mansur was unable to end the imamate. However, unlike his father who had been able to teach freely in Medina, Musa al-Kadhim lived with tight restrictions set by Abbasid caliphs, such as al-Mansur and Harun al-Rashid.<ref>{{cite web |title=Brief History of Fourteen Infallibles |url=https://www.al-islam.org/brief-history-fourteen-infallibles/eighth-infallible-sixth-imam |publisher=World Organization for Islamic Services (WOFIS)}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Tabatabai|1975|pp=180\u2013181}}</ref>  Musa al-Kadhim never accepted Harun's government, because he believed al- Rashid sought to destroy Islam by erasing the truth and effacing justice.

This latter group became known as the [[Waqifite Shia|Waqifiyah]].{{efn|Among the sects which separated from the majority of Shiites only [[Zaidiyyah]] and [[Ismaili]] continue to exist till now.<ref name=\"Tabatabai 1975 68\u201369\">{{harvnb|Tabatabai|1975|pp=68\u201369}}</ref> }}<ref name=\"Tabatabai 1975 68\u201369\"/><ref name=\"Corbin 2001\">{{cite book |last1=Corbin |first1=Henry |title=History Of Islamic Philosophy |publisher=Kegan Paul International, 1993 |isbn=9780710304162 |page=31 |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/History_of_Islamic_Philosophy.html?id=DH8EAQAAIAAJ}}</ref>\n\n==Theological disputes==\n\n===With Harun al-Rashid ===\nOne of the stories about the Imam concerns an incident where [[Harun al-Rashid]] and the Imam were together before the tomb of [[Muhammad]] in [[Medina]], when, to show his family ties to Muhammad, al-Rashid had said, \"Salutation unto thee, O Prophet of God, unto thee who art my cousin!\" In response, the Imam said, \"Salutation unto thee, o my dear father!\" which made al-Rashid furious. \"Abul-Hasan, such glory as thine is truly to be vaunted of\" said al-Rashid.<ref name=\"Donaldson\"/> Later, al-Rashid found the opportunity to question him, asking why he had permitted people to ascribe him to Muhammad and to call him: \"O Sons of [[Muhammad|Allah's Apostle]]\", while he was actually the son of [[Ali]], and that one is ascribed to his father, and that [[Fatimah]], his mother, was a container, and that Muhammad was his grandfather on the side of his mother. The Imam replied, asking \"If the Prophet was raised from the dead and proposed to your daughter, would you respond to him?\" \"Rather I would through that pride myself on the Arabs, the non-Arabs, and [[Quraysh tribe|Quraysh]],\" answered al-Rashid. \"But he would not propose (to my daughter) and I would not marry (her) to him,\" said the Imam, \"because he begot me and did not beget you.\" Al-Rashid, however, was not satisfied with this answer, insisting that \"the progeny belongs to the male and not to the female\", and that the Imams were Muhammad's daughter's children.{{efn|The argument here is whether women count when reckoning ancestry.}}<ref name=\"Sharif al-Qarashi2 200-202\">{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi2|2000|pp=200\u2013202}}</ref>\n\nThe Imam quoted from the Quran, stating that in the Quran, God had said: \"and of his descendants, David and Solomon, [[Job (biblical figure)|Job]], [[Joseph]], [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]]; and thus do We reward those who do good. And [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] and [[John the Baptist]], and [[Jesus]] and [[Elijah|Elias]]: All in the company of the righteous\"{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#6:84 Quran, 6:84,85]}} \"Who is Jesus's father, O Commander of the faithful?\" asked the Imam. \"Jesus had no father,\" said al-Rashid. The Imam argued that God had ascribed Jesus to the descendants of the prophets through [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]; \"similarly, we have been ascribed to the descendants of the Prophet through our mother [[Fatimah]],\" said the Imam.<ref name=\"Sharif al-Qarashi2 200-202\"/> Nevertheless, al-Rashid asked the Imam to give him more evidence and proof, so he put forward another quote from the Quran, reciting the verse: \"But whoever disputes with you in this matter after what has come to you of knowledge, then say: Come, let us call our sons and your sons and our women and your women and ourselves and yourselves, then let us be earnest in prayer, and pray for the curse of Allah on the liars.\"{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#3:61 Quran, 3:61]}} Then he said: \"None claims that the Prophet made someone enter under [[Ahl al-Kisa|the cloak]] when he challenged the Christians to a contest of prayer to God ([[Event of Mubahala|mubahala]]) except [[Ali]], [[Fatimah]], [[Hasan ibn Ali|al-Hasan]], and [[Husayn ibn Ali|al-Husayn]]. Therefore the explanation of the verse is: Our sons are al-Hasan and al-Husayn; our women is [[Fatimah]]; ourselves is [[Ali]].\"{{efn|For more information see the [[Event of Mubahala]]}}<ref name=\"Sharif al-Qarashi2 200-202\"/>\n\n===With Bishr al-Hafi===\nAnother incident concerns [[Bishr the Barefoot|Bishr al-Hafi]], who led a [[Bacchic]] life. Once in the midst of the noise, music, alcoholic drink and frivolity, Musa al-Kadhim happened to pass by his house in Baghdad. Al-Kadhim saw a slave girl coming out of the house carrying some sweepings. He turned to the slave and asked her: \"Is the owner of this house free or a servant?\" \"He is free,\" she replied. \"You are right,\" responded Musa al-Kadhim, \"if he was a servant, he would fear his Lord.\"<ref name=\"Sharif al-Qarashi130\"/> The slave girl came into the house while al-Hafi was still at the wine table: \"What delayed you?\" asked al-Hafi. She informed him of what had happened between her and the Imam. It is said that al-Hafi rushed to the door barefooted but the Imam had already left, so he left in search of the Imam, and when he found him, asked him to repeat his words. Al-Hafi was so taken aback by the Imam's words that he fell on the ground and began to cry. \"No, I am a slave, I am a slave.\" From then on, he would walk without shoes and people would call him Bishr al-Hafi (The barefooted one). When asked why he did not wear shoes, he would say that he was guided while he was barefoot, so he would remain in that condition till death.<ref name=\"Sharif al-Qarashi130\">{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi2|2000|p=130}}</ref>\n\n===With a monk===\nA final incident concerned Al-Abbas (born Hilal al-Shami), who said to Musa al-Kadhim that people admired those who ate simple food, wore coarse clothes, and showed reverence. For that reason, the Imam reminded him of [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]], who had been a prophet; however, Joseph had worn silk mantles decorated with gold, and sat on the thrones of the Pharaohs. \"The people were in no need of his clothes, but they were in need of his justice,\" said the Imam. \"An [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imam]] is required to be just and fair; when he says something, he says the truth; when he promises something, he fulfills his promise; when he passes a judgement, he judges equitably. Allah has not forbidden wearing a particular type of clothes or eating a particular type of food earned through a lawful way; rather He has forbidden the unlawful, little or much.\" Then he recited the verse: \"Say: Who has forbidden the beautiful (gifts) of Allah which He has produced for His servants, and the agreeable things of the sustenance.\"{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#7:32 Quran, 7:32]}}<ref>{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi2|2000|p=214}}</ref>\n\n==Imprisonments and death==\n\n===First imprisonment===\nMusa al-Kadhim was imprisoned multiple times during his lifetime. The first time, Caliph [[al-Mahdi]] had him arrested and brought to [[Baghdad]]. According to [[Ibn Khallikan]], \"This Caliph had a dream in which [[Ali ibn Abu Talib]] appeared to him and said, 'O Muhammad, were ye ready therefore, if ye had been put in authority, to commit evil in the earth, and to violate the ties of blood?{{'\"}}{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#47:22 Quran, 47:22]}} [[Al-Fadl ibn al-Rabi']] says: \"He sent for me at night and that put me in great dread. I went to him and found him chanting the above verse and no man had a finer voice than he. He said to me, 'Bring me Musa ibn Ja'far.' I did so and he embraced him, seated him by his side and said to him, 'Abul-Hasan, I have just seen in a dream the Commander of the Faithful, Ali ibn Abu Talib, and he has recited to me such and such a verse; give me the assurance that you will not revolt against me or against any of my children.' He answered, 'By Allah, I am incapable of revolting.' 'You say the truth!' replied the Caliph, 'give him three thousand pieces of gold and restore him to his family in [[Medina]].' I arranged the affair of his departure that very night, lest some obstacle might turn up, and before morning the man was on his journey.\"{{efn|[[Ibn Khallikan]], ''Deaths of Eminent Men'', trans. de Slane}}<ref name=\"Donaldson\"/>\n\n===Second imprisonment===\nAl-Kadhim's second imprisonment was a result of his argument with al-Rashid over descent from Muhammad. Al-Khuzai, the head of the palace guards, narrated a dream the Caliph supposedly had, which made him release the Imam: \"A messenger came to me from al-Rashid,\" he said, \"at an hour in which I never before received his visits; he pulled me from the place where I was and would not even allow me to change my clothes. This put me in great fear. When I arrived at the palace, I found the Caliph sitting up in his bed. I saluted him, but he kept silent for some time; so my mind was much troubled and my fears greatly augmented. At length he said, 'Do you know why I sent for you at such an hour?' I answered, 'By Allah, I do not, [[Amir al-Mu'minin|Commander of the Faithful]].' 'Know,' said he, 'that I just had a dream in which it seemed to me as if an [[Habesha people|Abyssinian]] came to me with a javelin in his hand and said to me: \"Let Musa ibn Ja'far be set at liberty this very hour, otherwise I shall slay thee with this javelin.\" Do you therefore go and get him set free.' I replied, 'Commander of the Faithful, shall I then liberate Musa the son of Ja'far?' 'Yes,' said he, 'go and set Musa ibn Ja'far at liberty. Give him thirty thousand [[dirhem]]s and say to him in my name, if you would like to remain with us you will obtain from me whatever you desire, but if you prefer going to [[Medina]] you have permission to do so.' I went to the prison and found the Imam waiting for me. 'Whilst I was asleep,' he said, 'behold the Apostle of God came to me and said, O Musa, thou hast been imprisoned unjustly; so recite the words I am going to repeat to thee, for assuredly thou shalt not pass all this night in prison.{{'\"}}{{efn|This narration continues as follows:I replied, \"For\nthee I should give up father and mother, what must I say?\" \n\"Repeat these words,\" said he: \n\"o thou who hearest every voice! \no thou who lettest no opportunity escape! \no thou who clothest the bones with flesh \nand who wilt raise them up after death! \nI invoke thee by thy holy name, and by that \ngreat and awful name which is treasured up \nand closely hidden, by that name which no \ncreated thing shall ever know I \no thou who art so mild and whose patience \nis never equalled! \no thou whose favours never cease and can \nnot be numbered, set me free!\" \nSo you see what happened.<ref name=\"Donaldson\"/>}}{{efn|See [[Al-Masudi]], [[The Meadows of Gold|Muruju'l-Dhahab]], vi, p. 308; and [[Ibn Khallikan]], ''Deaths of Eminent Men'', trans. de Slane}}<ref name=\"Donaldson\"/>\n\n===Final imprisonment===\n[[File:Wooden box of the shrine of Imam Musa al-Kadhim, made 6th century AH, Iraq Museum in Baghdad.jpg|thumb|Wooden box of the shrine of Imam Musa al-Kadhim, made 6th century AH, Iraq Museum in Baghdad]]\nAl-Fakhri states the reason for his final imprisonment was that \"there were some of the relatives of Musa ibn Ja'far who were envious of him and carried false reports about him to al-Rashid, saying, 'The people are paying him the [[Khums]], or one-fifth of their property, on accepting the [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imamah]], and he is about to come forth against you.' They brought this report to al-Rashid so frequently that it made him anxious and agitated. In that year al-Rashid went on the pilgrimage, and when he arrived in Medina, he arrested Musa ibn Ja'far, and brought him to Baghdad in a litter, and imprisoned him under the care of al-Sindi ibn Sha'hik.\"{{efn|See Al-Fakhri (Ibnu'l-Tiktil'ni), in the Adab al-Sultaniyya, Chrestomathie Arabe, Silvestre de Sacy, i, text, p. 7, and translation, p. 6.}}<ref name=\"Donaldson\"/>\n \nAl-Fakhri adds \"Al-Rashid was at [[Rakka Eyalet|Rakka]] when he sent orders that the Imam should be put to death. They then brought a number of reputable men to [[Karkh]] to act as coroners and to testify publicly that he had died a natural death. He, then, was buried in the cemetery of Quraish on the south side of Baghdad.\" The implication made by the Shi'a is that he was poisoned. It was narrated that he was tortured for many years during each stay in prison. The most severe imprisonment was under Sindhi. It was narrated that he used to put him in a grave-like jail, where it would be difficult to distinguish night from day. It is narrated that Imam Musa Kadhim used to put his nose near the door in hopes of breathing but Sindhi would slam the door violently, injuring him severely. He was then eventually poisoned by dates and was forced to eat them by Sindhi. The place he was buried was a cemetery, but soon this place became the focus of pilgrimage to the grave of the Imam. A town grew around the graveyard. The name of the town became [[Kadhimiya]] (the town of the Imam Kadhim). A reputed school of theology was founded in this town; the school is still a source of learning for many students from all over the world.<ref name=\"Tabatabai\"/><ref name=\"Donaldson\"/>\n\n==Selected sayings==\n* \"Allah has two proofs over men: outward proof and inward one.

Sara Olson of [[Kalamazoo, Michigan|Kalamazoo]], [[Michigan]] is an obsessive fan of Christopher Wilde who seeks to use her family's trip to [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], [[California]] to visit her widowed grandmother as an opportunity to meet him for spring break. Christopher, meanwhile, is on the brink of landing a movie deal and has agreed to remain out of the [[supermarket tabloid|tabloids]] in order to prove that he is serious about landing the role.\n\nOnce in California, Sara convinces her younger sister Jessica, to accompany her to a [[nightclub]] where he is rumored to be delivering a surprise performance for his pseudo-girlfriend Alexis Bender. Sara leaves Jessica outside the club to watch the car while she goes inside in a futile attempt to meet Christopher.\n\nFed up with waiting, Jessica leaves the car in search for Sara and meets Christopher when he hits her in the head while opening a door. Eager to avoid being caught by the [[paparazzi]], Christopher takes Jessica to a hospital to be examined, then brings her to his house so that he can make an appearance for the film director. He then brings Jessica home, and Jessica allows him to stay in her grandmother's garage for the night when he learns the paparazzi have followed him.\n\nThe next day Sara brings Jessica to [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] in the hopes of running into Christopher there. Sara goes off to sit down on the beach, but Jessica recognizes Christopher's disguise and sits down with him. The two are forced to make a quick exit from the beach when the paparazzi arrive; once they get away, Christopher shows Jessica around [[Los Angeles]].\n\nWhile attempting to return to Malibu, they are again spotted by the paparazzi, but manage to elude them by driving off the main road, losing Jessica's grandmother's car in a mud pool [[quicksand]] in the process. While walking back to Malibu, they get into a heated argument, with Jessica calling Christopher's life \"fake\". He tries to convince her his life is real. Christopher drags Jessica into a river and they forget their argument. Eventually, Christopher confides that he enjoyed hanging out with Jessica because she was not actually asking for anything from him. She agrees that it was fun having him alone.\n\nWhen they return to the beach they almost kiss, but are interrupted when Christopher panics about being recognized. Christopher tells Jessica that no one can know what happened between them that day, telling her that the paparazzi would ruin her life as well as his. Heartbroken and angry, Jessica returns home to Kalamazoo with her family, but not before the paparazzi establish a connection between her and Christopher.\n\nBack in Kalamazoo, Jessica watches Christopher tell a talk show host that he had never met her. Angry with the way the paparazzi forced Christopher to lie and hide himself from the real world, she confronts the paparazzi camped outside her house, and tells them that they destroyed him and that she \"never met the Christopher that they were all so obsessed with\". Christopher's best friend, Stubby convinces Christopher to make his own choices. Alexis finds out that Christopher has been with someone who is not famous, and she breaks up with him. Christopher realizes that he is free to pursue Jessica. Christopher then proceeds to fire his parents as his managers and turn down the movie role that made him lie and lose himself in the tabloids.\n\nAfter Sara's equally Christopher-obsessed friend A.J. viciously insults Jessica for what she said on television, Sara kicks A.J. out of the house and offers to take Jessica to the school dance with her. Jessica accepts, and Sara helps her get ready for the dance. At the dance, Christopher makes an appearance and apologizes to Jessica through a song. She wants more than just his apology though.\n\nWhen the paparazzi appear at the dance, he tells them that he was the one that lied and says he is crazy about Jessica. She smiles and accepts his apology, and he becomes her boyfriend. He gives her a pair of \"Christopher Wilde\" sunglasses.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Sterling Knight]] as  Christopher Wilde\n* [[Danielle Campbell]] as Jessica Olson\n* [[Brandon Mychal Smith]] as Albert Joshua \"Stubby\" Stubbins\n* [[Chelsea Kane]] as Alexis Bender\n* [[Maggie Castle]] as Sara Olson\n* [[Matt Winston]]  as Alan Smith\n* [[Toni Trucks]]   as Libby Lam\n* [[Beth Littleford]] as Barbara Olson\n* [[Dan O'Connor (actor)|Dan O'Connor]] as Dean Olson\n* [[Lauren Bowles]] as Sheri Wilde\n* [[Ron Pearson]] as  Daniel Wilde\n* [[Abbie Cobb]] as AJ\n\n==Production==\nThe film was shot in 2009 on location in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].\n\n==Reception==\nThe movie premiere generated 6.0 million viewers, the first to debut on a Sunday night, becoming the channel's most-watched February original movie premiere in Total Viewers, Kids 7-11 and Teenagers.<ref name=\"TVBythenumbers\">{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2010/02/15/disneys-starstruck-shines-in-debut-with-6-0-million-viewers/ |title=Disney's \"Starstruck\" Shines in Debut With 6.0 Million Viewers |work=[[TV by the Numbers]] |date=February 15, 2010}}</ref> [[Disney Channel]]'s highest numbers ever in the time period among teens (2.3 million), and second-highest on record in Total Viewers (6.0 million) and Kids 7\u201311 (2.4 million), behind only the August 19, 2007 encore of ''[[High School Musical 2]]''.<ref name=\"TVBythenumbers\" /> There were 987,000 viewers when it premiered in the [[UK]] and [[Ireland]] on May 14, 2010.<ref name=\"barb\">[[BARB]], via [http://www.barb.co.uk/viewing/weekly-top-10?]</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n{{Infobox album\n| name       = Starstruck Soundtrack\n| type       = [[Soundtrack]]\n| artist     = Various artists\n| cover      =\n| caption    ={{deletable image-caption|Friday, 24 January 2020|PROD}} \n| alt        =\n| released   = February 9, 2010\n| recorded   = 2009\n| venue      =\n| studio     =\n| genre      = [[Teen pop]]\n| length     = 37:43\n| label      = [[Walt Disney Records]]\n| producer   = Various artists\n| prev_title =\n| prev_year  =\n| next_title =\n| next_year  =\n| misc       = {{Singles\n | name        = Starstruck Soundtrack\n | type        = soundtrack\n | single1     = Starstruck\n | single1date = January 27, 2010\n | single2     = Hero\n | single2date = February 12, 2010\n}}\n}}\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[Allmusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{rating|2.5|5}}<ref name=\"Starstruck\"/>\n}}\nThe soundtrack was released on February 9, 2010 by [[Walt Disney Records]].<ref name=\"amazon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002YICNCY |title=Starstruck: Various Artists: Music |date= |accessdate=2012-03-10}}</ref> The soundtrack peaked at number 23 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

The series follows a group of teenagers chosen by the wise sage [[Zordon]] to become \"Power Rangers\" in order to stop the forces of evil from taking over the planet Earth. ''Zeo'' comprises 50 episodes and concluded its initial airing November 27, 1996. ''Zeo'' uses footage and elements from the [[Super Sentai]] series ''[[Ch\u014driki Sentai Ohranger]]'' and is the first series in Power Rangers that is part of the annual Ranger suit change to match the annual change of the Super Sentai series. Regular cast members during ''Zeo'' include [[Catherine Sutherland]], [[Nakia Burrise]], [[Steve Cardenas]], [[Johnny Yong Bosch]], [[Jason David Frank]], [[David Yost]], [[Paul Schrier]], [[Jason Narvy]], [[Richard Genelle]], Gregg Bullock.

The Rangers are given their new Zeo powers to combat the [[Machine Empire]] who kick [[Rita Repulsa]] and [[Lord Zedd]] out of their palace on the moon and become the primary villains the Rangers must face. Meanwhile, while facing the Machine Empire, the Rangers must also discover the [[Power Rangers Zeo#Identity of the Gold Ranger|secret identity of an unknown Gold Ranger]] who also seems to have the power of the Zeo Crystal. [[Bulk and Skull|Bulk (Schrier) and Skull (Narvy)]] continue on as police officers, until they get Lt. Stone (Bullock) fired and join him in founding a detective agency.\n\n==Episodes==\n<!-- Episodes are listed by production. -->\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#F5F506|overall=4 |season=4 |title=19 |director=14 |writer=17 |airdate=13 |prodcode=6 |episodes=\n\n{{Episode list/sublist|List of Power Rangers Zeo episodes\n |EpisodeNumber = 156\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = A Zeo Beginning, Part I\n |DirectedBy = [[Isaac Florentine]]\n |WrittenBy = Douglas Sloan\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|1996|04|20}}\n\n |ShortSummary = The teens can hardly believe what they've seen-the Command Center, for years their sanctuary from the devious Rita Repulsa and Lord Zedd, lies in ruins before them, the fate of their friends [[Alpha 5 (Power Rangers)|Alpha 5]] and their mentor Zordon uncertain.

The Rangers take Jason to the command center and Zordon tells them that Jason will lose his Powers and life if the Gold Ranger's Powers are not transferred back to the Treys, which can only happen when the Earth, Aquitar and Triforia are aligned just so.

Pursued by Rita, Lord Zedd, and the Machine Empire who are all greedy for his powers, he finds himself helpless against them. But when Zedd and Rita get into a fight with Mondo, he is able to make a narrow escape, and he teleports to Angel Grove and collapses at the juice bar. The Rangers take Jason to the command center and Zordon tells them that Jason will lose his Powers and life if the Gold Ranger's Powers are not transferred back to the Treys, which can only happen when the Earth, Aquitar and Triforia are aligned just so. [[Alpha 5 (Power Rangers)|Alpha 5]] gives the Rangers a map with which they find the place for the power transfer. King Mondo furiously orders Cogs to prevent it. As the Rangers get to the place for the transfer, they are attacked by Cogs. They fight them, and ship into action as Rocky comes just in time as the Gold Ranger's powers transfer back to the Treys. Trey helps, but when King Mondo arrives super-sized with allies, the Rangers are forced to grow to giant size too by Trey's magical powers. Meanwhile, Zedd and Rita decide to try to trick King Mondo or set him up. They go to the scene, watch the fray from a safe distance, and have plans for both enemies no matter who wins. In the end, the rangers win, but King Mondo's allies and he are not destroyed. Instead, they retreat, to Zedd and Rita's delight. On the Moon, King Mondo quickly confronts them for not assisting him against the Rangers. Zedd and Rita pretend they have given up and offers a gift to the Machine Empire as a peace offering. They quickly leave in their base, which Prince Sprocket opens the present and there's an explosion. While driving away laughing, Zedd proudly proclaims \"We're back\" and King Mondo swears revenge against him and Rita. In the end, Jason takes his leave alongside his girlfriend Emily as Tommy heads out with Kat by his side.\n |ProdCode = 430 |LineColor = F5F506\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n<!-- Episodes are listed by production. -->\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0115319/ Power Rangers Zeo] on the [[Internet Movie Database]]\n\n{{Power Rangers}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Power Rangers Zeo Episodes}}\n[[Category:Power Rangers episodes|Zeo]]\n[[Category:Lists of American science fiction television series episodes]]\n[[Category:Power Rangers Zeo|Episodes]]\n[[Category:Television episodes about alien invasion]]\n", "name_user": "Jo-Jo Eumerus", "label": "safe", "comment": "Removing link(s):Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Douglas Sloan (television producer)closed as delete (XFDcloser)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Power_Rangers_Zeo_episodes"}

The screenplay was written by Art Edler Brown and Josh Nick. It was filmed in [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada, taking 2 years to complete.\n\n==Plot==\nJordan Sands ([[Victoria Justice]]) is an awkward and nerdy 17-year-old girl with a bad case of allergies, who just became the woman of the house after the recent death of her mother. Her father David ([[Matt Winston]]) is struggling to make ends meet, while her 14-year-old brother Hunter ([[Chase Ellison]]) drives the family crazy with gory pranks. They inherit their deceased mother's Great-Uncle Dragomir's castle in Wolfsberg, [[Romania]] after getting a package in the mail. After arriving in Wolfsberg, they meet the strange and steely castle [[Housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]], Madame Varcolac ([[Brooke Shields]]).\n\nVarcolac discourages David from selling the property, but he ends up going on dates with and falling for the real estate agent Paulina von Eckberg. One day while snooping around Dragomir's lab, Jordan steps on a vial of strange liquid. Hunter manages to pull the pieces out from her foot, but Jordan's behavior changes, such as her allergies disappearing, seeing without glasses, and smelling things very far away. Hunter's friends explain that Jordan's behaviors are akin to those of a werewolf's, and that she is one either because of a bloodline curse, a bite from an infected person, or from getting blood of a werewolf. In Jordan's case, it was revealed to have been LB-217, which is short for \"Lycanthrope Blood\".\n\nJordan continues to succumb to the changes, having behavioral changes. After her date with Goran, the young [[butcher]], Jordan turns into a werewolf, which Hunter witnesses. She flees and Hunter contacts his friends for help. They reveal that there is no cure they know of other than shooting a werewolf dead with silver. Hunter refuses to do this to his sister. His friends warn that if Jordan is not cured by the next sunrise, she will always be a werewolf, cursed to shift every night until the end of her life.\n\nThey find Varcolac, who reveals that Dragomir was also a werewolf and was the \"Wolfsberg Beast\"; protector of the castle and Wolfsberg itself. Vampires have attempted to take over the castle, but Dragomir stopped them before he was ultimately killed. Before his death, Dragomir was working on a possible cure to lycanthropy. However, it will take time to gather the ingredients. Paulina offers the siblings a ride home, but Jordan struggles in trying to resist her transformation. The car breaks down and the Vampires come out, along with Paulina, who is a Vampire. As it turns out, she killed Dragomir to get the manor and will now kill Jordan. Jordan and Hunter are locked in the trunk and brought to her hideout, where Jordan succumbs to the change and is restrained. Hunter leads David to the hideout as they witness Paulina attempting to kill Jordan.\n\nHunter suddenly turns into a werewolf himself; he is a part of the bloodline. The werewolves attack the Vampires before witnessing the rising sun. They use this to their advantage and kill them with the sunlight, with Jordan defeating Paulina in a final showdown. Jordan and Hunter return to the manor, where Hunter's blood is used in the antidote, which successfully subside Jordan\u2019s werewolf\u2019s side since she took the antidote after her first full moon, becoming half-human and half-werewolf. Varcolac is allowed to continue working there, and gives the Sands the money they inherited from Dragomir. Hunter also becomes the Wolfsberg Beast to take Dragomir's place.\n\nThe family returns to California where Jordan demonstrates a new confidence and power at school, and Goran transfers to be with her. David also finds a new love interest. In a twist, it turns out that Paulina was not killed by Jordan after all, and has moved to their neighborhood.\n\nThe movie ends as the cast sings [[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]] on karaoke.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Victoria Justice]] as Jordan Sands\n* [[Chase Ellison]] as Hunter Sands\n* [[Matt Winston]] as David Sands\n* [[Erica Carroll]] as Francine Sands\n* [[Brooke Shields]] as Madame Olga Varcolac\n* [[Brooke D'Orsay]] as Paulina Von Eckberg\n* [[Gabriella Isabel Pierogi]] as Werewolf 2\n* Steven Grayham as Goran\n* [[Valerie Tian]] as Debbie\n* [[Ben Cotton]] as the Cab Driver\n* [[Cainan Wiebe]] as Rob Wright\n* [[Andrea Brooks]] as Ashley Edwards\n* [[Christie Laing]] as Tiffany Whit\n* [[Patrick Sabongui]] as Monster Fan Dude\n* [[Kerry James (actor)|Kerry James]] as Cort Mc Cann\n* [[Alex Diakun]] as Igor Van Helman Stanisklavsky\n* [[Anna Galvin]] as Ms. Carlsberg\n* Marci T.

The series follows a group of teenagers chosen by the wise sage [[Zordon]] to become \"Power Rangers\" in order to stop evil from taking over the planet Earth. ''Turbo'' comprises 45 episodes and concluded its initial airing November 24, 1997. ''Turbo'' uses footage and elements from the [[Super Sentai]] series ''[[Gekisou Sentai Carranger]]'' and follows the annual Ranger suit change (started in ''Zeo'') to match the annual change of the Super Sentai series. Regular cast members during ''Turbo'' include [[Johnny Yong Bosch]], [[Nakia Burrise]], [[Blake Foster]], [[Jason David Frank]], [[Catherine Sutherland]], Carol Hoyt, and Gregg Bullock. Part way through the season, [[Jason Narvy]] and [[Paul Schrier]] re-join the main cast, Bosch, Burrise, Frank, and Sutherland are replaced by [[Roger Velasco]], [[Tracy Lynn Cruz]], [[Selwyn Ward]], and [[Patricia Ja Lee]] respectively. The four play new characters, but take on the previous characters' respective colors and powers. Hoyt continues to play [[Dimitria]], but is later replaced by [[Hilary Shepard Turner]] for the role of [[Divatox]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Turbo'' picks up some time after the events of ''[[Power Rangers Zeo]]'', with Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa now taking some time out from fighting the Power Rangers, having last been seen blowing up King Mondo's Machine Empire at the end of ''Zeo''. ''Turbo'' begins with the feature film ''[[Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie]]'', with a new Blue Ranger Justin ([[Blake Foster]]), and with the Queen of Space Pirates, Divatox ([[Hilary Shepard|Hilary Shephard Turner]] in the movie and episodes 26-45, Carol Hoyt in episodes 1-25), becoming the new main villain the Rangers must face, along with her evil colleagues [[Villains in Power Rangers Turbo#Rygog|Rygog]], [[Villains in Power Rangers Turbo#Porto|Porto]] and Divatox's nephew [[Villains in Power Rangers Turbo#Elgar|Elgar]]. There are a few character similarities with older villains from the ''Mighty Morphin'' era with Divatox/Rita, Rygog/Goldar, Porto/Finster and Elgar/Rito. Zordon and [[Alpha 5 (Power Rangers)|Alpha 5]] return to their home planets of Eltar and Edenoi respectively in episode 3, which then sees the introduction of Dimitria and [[Alpha 6 (Power Rangers)|Alpha 6]] to aid the Rangers. In the episode ''The Millennium Message'', an intergalactic policeman named the [[Blue Senturion]] comes to Earth bearing a message that in the year 2000, Divatox, [[Lord Zedd]], [[Rita Repulsa]], and the newly built and now loyal [[Machine Empire]] will join forces with Dark Specter in the United Alliance of Evil to take over the universe, with only one force standing in their way. [[Tommy Oliver|Tommy]] ([[Jason David Frank]]), [[Adam Park|Adam]] ([[Johnny Yong Bosch]]), Katherine ([[Catherine Sutherland]]), and Tanya ([[Nakia Burrise]]) are relieved of their duties as Power Rangers at the end of episode 19 before they move to college, and they choose their replacements respectively as [[Theodore Jay Jarvis Johnson|T. J. Johnson]] (Selwyn Ward), [[Carlos Vallerte]] (Roger Velasco), [[Cassie Chan]] ([[Patricia Ja Lee]]), and [[Ashley Hammond]]  (Tracy Lynn Cruz). [[Bulk and Skull|Bulk (Paul Schrier) and Skull (Jason Narvy)]] are turned into monkeys by [[Villains in Power Rangers Turbo#Elgar|Elgar]] in episode 1 and stay that way until the end of episode 17, and then they spend the next three episodes as invisible human beings, before returning to their normal visible human selves at the end of episode 20, with Bulk and Skull then spending the rest of the season trying to hold down a job.\n\n==Film==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; background: #FFFFFF;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCC\"\n!

The series follows a group of teenagers chosen by the wise sage [[Zordon]] to become \"Power Rangers\" in order to stop evil from taking over the planet Earth. ''Turbo'' comprises 45 episodes and concluded its initial airing November 24, 1997. ''Turbo'' uses footage and elements from the [[Super Sentai]] series ''[[Gekisou Sentai Carranger]]'' and follows the annual Ranger suit change (started in ''Zeo'') to match the annual change of the Super Sentai series. Regular cast members during ''Turbo'' include [[Johnny Yong Bosch]], [[Nakia Burrise]], [[Blake Foster]], [[Jason David Frank]], [[Catherine Sutherland]], Carol Hoyt, and Gregg Bullock. Part way through the season, [[Jason Narvy]] and [[Paul Schrier]] re-join the main cast, Bosch, Burrise, Frank, and Sutherland are replaced by [[Roger Velasco]], [[Tracy Lynn Cruz]], [[Selwyn Ward]], and [[Patricia Ja Lee]] respectively. The four play new characters, but take on the previous characters' respective colors and powers. Hoyt continues to play [[Dimitria]], but is later replaced by [[Hilary Shepard Turner]] for the role of [[Divatox]].\n\n==Synopsis==\n''Turbo'' picks up some time after the events of ''[[Power Rangers Zeo]]'', with Lord Zedd and Rita Repulsa now taking some time out from fighting the Power Rangers, having last been seen blowing up King Mondo's Machine Empire at the end of ''Zeo''. ''Turbo'' begins with the feature film ''[[Turbo: A Power Rangers Movie]]'', with a new Blue Ranger Justin ([[Blake Foster]]), and with the Queen of Space Pirates, Divatox ([[Hilary Shepard|Hilary Shephard Turner]] in the movie and episodes 26-45, Carol Hoyt in episodes 1-25), becoming the new main villain the Rangers must face, along with her evil colleagues [[Villains in Power Rangers Turbo#Rygog|Rygog]], [[Villains in Power Rangers Turbo#Porto|Porto]] and Divatox's nephew [[Villains in Power Rangers Turbo#Elgar|Elgar]]. There are a few character similarities with older villains from the ''Mighty Morphin'' era with Divatox/Rita, Rygog/Goldar, Porto/Finster and Elgar/Rito. Zordon and [[Alpha 5 (Power Rangers)|Alpha 5]] return to their home planets of Eltar and Edenoi respectively in episode 3, which then sees the introduction of Dimitria and [[Alpha 6 (Power Rangers)|Alpha 6]] to aid the Rangers. In the episode ''The Millennium Message'', an intergalactic policeman named the [[Blue Senturion]] comes to Earth bearing a message that in the year 2000, Divatox, [[Lord Zedd]], [[Rita Repulsa]], and the newly built and now loyal [[Machine Empire]] will join forces with Dark Specter in the United Alliance of Evil to take over the universe, with only one force standing in their way. [[Tommy Oliver|Tommy]] ([[Jason David Frank]]), [[Adam Park|Adam]] ([[Johnny Yong Bosch]]), Katherine ([[Catherine Sutherland]]), and Tanya ([[Nakia Burrise]]) are relieved of their duties as Power Rangers at the end of episode 19 before they move to college, and they choose their replacements respectively as [[Theodore Jay Jarvis Johnson|T. J. Johnson]] (Selwyn Ward), [[Carlos Vallerte]] (Roger Velasco), [[Cassie Chan]] ([[Patricia Ja Lee]]), and [[Ashley Hammond]]  (Tracy Lynn Cruz). [[Bulk and Skull|Bulk (Paul Schrier) and Skull (Jason Narvy)]] are turned into monkeys by [[Villains in Power Rangers Turbo#Elgar|Elgar]] in episode 1 and stay that way until the end of episode 17, and then they spend the next three episodes as invisible human beings, before returning to their normal visible human selves at the end of episode 20, with Bulk and Skull then spending the rest of the season trying to hold down a job.\n\n==Film==\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; background: #FFFFFF;\"\n|- bgcolor=\"#CCCCC\"\n!
