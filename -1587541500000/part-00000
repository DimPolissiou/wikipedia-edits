He was ranked as one of the Top-2 recruits in the nation his senior season along with [[Kobe Bryant]] whom almost joined him at Villanova after the two both played in the 1996 High School McDonald's All-American game and the All-Star [[Roundball Classic|Magic Johnson Roundball Classic]] game which they dominated together.

A national sensation in high school and outstanding collegian at Villanova University, the athletic 6'10\" 240lb talent played in the [[National_Basketball_Association|National Basketball Association]] (NBA) from 1997 to 2007.\n\n==High school and college career==\nA versatile 6'10\" forward with a soft shooting touch, Thomas was tabbed as a future NBA star when he was still in high school, and was selected to the [[McDonald's All-American]] team after averaging 25.3 points and 14.5 rebounds per game as a senior at [[Paterson Catholic High School]]. He was ranked as the #2 recruit in the nation behind only [[Kobe Bryant]] whom almost joined him at Villanova after the two both played in the 1996 High School McDonald's All-American game and the All-Star [[Roundball Classic|Magic Johnson Roundball Classic]] game which they dominated together.\n\n==NCAA career==\nThomas made his mark in his one season in college at Villanova University. Joining a future NBA talent-laden team with [[Alvin Williams#Basketball career|Alvin Williams]], Jason Lawson, John Celestand and Malik Allen, he filled the void of former Big East Player of the Year [[Kerry Kittles#Career highlights|Kerry Kittles]] from the year before and helped lead the Wildcats to a BIG EAST Regular Season Championship under coach Steve Lappas.  Villanova would place 2nd in the Big East tournament but Thomas would be named to both ALL-BIG EAST and ALL-BIG EAST Tournament teams as well as win BIG EAST ROOKIE OF THE YEAR while sporting a 17PPG and 6Reb avg.  Villanova would make the NCAA Tourney but lose in round 2 to a U of California team that featured future NFL All-Pro, [[Tony Gonzalez]].\n\n==NBA career==\nFollowing his freshman year at [[Villanova Wildcats basketball|Villanova University]], he was drafted seventh overall by the [[New Jersey Nets]] in the [[1997 NBA draft]] and was immediately traded to the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in exchange for the Sixers' draft pick ([[Keith Van Horn]]).\n\n===Philadelphia 76ers===\nThomas enjoyed a solid rookie season, averaging 11.0 points per game, and was named to the NBA's ALL-ROOKIE 2nd Team. The Sixers would grow impatient with a [[sophomore slump]] from Thomas, though, and in 1999 he and [[Scott Williams (basketball)|Scott Williams]] were traded to the [[Milwaukee Bucks]] for [[Jerald Honeycutt]] and [[Tyrone Hill]].\n\n===Milwaukee Bucks===\nMilwaukee was enamored with Thomas's raw talent and versatility, and hoped he could blossom into a star with more seasoning.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/vault/2002/10/28/8118866/6-milwaukee-bucks-with-glenn-robinson-gone-tim-thomas-has-a-chance-to-prove-that-hes-worth-his-big-contractand-that-he-can-fetch-more-wins-than-big-dog|title=6 Milwaukee Bucks With Glenn Robinson gone, Tim Thomas has a chance to prove that he's worth his big contract--and that he can fetch more wins than Big Dog|last=Burns|first=Marty|website=Vault|language=en|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref> It looked like things were coming together for Thomas during the [[2000\u201301 NBA season|2000\u201301 season]], when he averaged a career-high 13.4 ppg for the Bucks.

In the Western Conference Finals, Phoenix fell to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in six games. In game five of that series, Thomas \"blew a kiss\" to Maverick [[Dirk Nowitzki]], who then proceeded to score a total of 50 points for the game. Thomas expressed an interest in re-signing with Phoenix,<ref>https://www.azcentral.com/sports/suns/articles/0627suns0627.html</ref> though the Suns were over the salary cap and expected Stoudemire to return as their starter.<ref>https://www.azcentral.com/sports/suns/articles/0630suns0630.html</ref>\n\n===Los Angeles Clippers===\nOn July 13, 2006, Thomas signed a four-year, $24 million contract with the [[Los Angeles Clippers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2518352|title=Tim Thomas joining Clippers|date=2006-07-13|website=ESPN.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref> He frequently started in place of [[Elton Brand]] and [[Chris Kaman]], though Thomas himself also battled injuries.\n\n===Second stint with New York===\nOn November 21, 2008, Thomas and [[Cuttino Mobley]] were traded to the New York Knicks, in exchange for [[Zach Randolph]] and [[Mardy Collins]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nba.com/2008/news/features/11/21/aldridge.reax/|title=NBA.com: Knicks not done dealing, pull off trade with Clippers|website=www.nba.com|access-date=2019-03-14}}</ref> In his return to the Knicks, Thomas was reunited with [[Mike D'Antoni]], who was his coach in Phoenix.\n\n===Second stint with Chicago===\nOn February 19, 2009, Thomas was traded again to the Bulls along with center [[Jerome James]] and guard [[Anthony Roberson]] in exchange for guard [[Larry Hughes]] just before the trade deadline.<ref name=\"Thomas back to Bulls\">{{cite web\n|url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3919012\n|title = Sources: Knicks trade for Bulls' Hughes\n|first =\n|last = \n|accessdate = February 19, 2009}}</ref> His second stint in Chicago was more successful than his first, as he provided veteran leadership to the young team, helping the Bulls make a late-season push to qualify for the playoffs. Though entering the playoffs as the seventh seed, they were able to push their first-round series against the defending-champion Boston Celtics to a full seven games.\n\nOn July 14, 2009, the Bulls negotiated a buyout of Thomas's $6.5 million contract.<ref>[http://blogs.chicagosports.chicagotribune.com/fullcourtpress/2009/07/bulls-buy-out-thomas.html Bulls buy out Thomas?]</ref>\n\n===Dallas Mavericks===\nOn July 28, 2009, the [[Dallas Mavericks]] signed free agent Thomas. In late January, however, he left the team temporarily to take care of his wife, who had an undisclosed illness.\n\nIn August 2010 Thomas agreed to a one-year deal with the Mavericks worth the veteran minimum. In September of that year, however, he told the club that he would not report to the team so that he could care for his sick wife.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/dallas/nba/news/story?id=5573456&campaign=rss&source=NBAHeadlines Tim Thomas won't play for Mavericks].
