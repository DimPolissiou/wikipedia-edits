Pools can be built into the ground (in-ground pools) or built above ground (as a freestanding construction or as part of a building or other larger structure), and are also a common feature aboard ocean-liners and cruise ships. In-ground pools are most commonly constructed from materials such as [[concrete]], natural stone, metal, plastic, or [[fiberglass]], and can be of a custom size and shape or built to a standardized size, the largest of which is the [[Olympic-size swimming pool]].\n\nMany [[health club]]s, [[fitness center]]s, and private clubs have pools used mostly for exercise or recreation. Many towns and cities provide public pools. Many hotels have pools available for their guests to use at their own leisure. Educational facilities such as high schools and universities sometimes have pools for physical education classes, recreational activities, leisure, and competitive athletics such as swimming teams. [[Hot tub]]s and [[spa]]s are pools filled with hot water, used for [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]] or [[hydrotherapy]]. They are common in hotels and health clubs, and can also be found in many private homes. Special swimming pools are also used for [[Diving (sport)|diving]], specialized water sports, and [[physical therapy]], as well as for the training of [[lifeguard]]s and [[astronaut]]s. Swimming pools may be heated or unheated.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== History ==\n{{seealso|History of water supply and sanitation}}\n[[Image:Roman Baths in Bath Spa, England - July 2006.jpg|thumb|Ancient Roman baths in [[Roman Baths (Bath)|Bath]], England]]\nThe \"[[Great Bath, Mohenjo-daro|Great Bath]]\" at the site of [[Mohenjo-Daro]] in modern-day Pakistan was most likely the first swimming pool, dug during the 3rd millennium BC.

It was formed in 1844, in response to concerns over drownings in the [[River Medway]], especially since would-be rescuers would often drown because they themselves could not swim to safety. The club used to swim in the River Medway, and would hold races, diving competitions and [[water polo]] matches. ''The South East Gazette'' July 1844 reported an aquatic breakfast party: coffee and biscuits were served on a floating raft in the river. The coffee was kept hot over a fire; club members had to tread water and drink coffee at the same time.  The last swimmers managed to overturn the raft, to the amusement of 150 spectators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maidstoneswimmingclub.net/index.php/about-us/our-history|title=Historical Titbits|publisher=Maidstone Swimming Club|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Amateur Swimming Association]] was founded in 1869 in England,{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} and the Oxford Swimming Club in 1909.<ref>The City of Oxford Swimming Club, [http://oxfordswim.com/about/history/ History]</ref> The presence of indoor baths in the cobbled area of [[Merton Street]] might have persuaded the less hardy of the aquatic brigade to join.

In 1939, [[Oxford]] created its first major public indoor pool at Temple Cowley.\n\nThe modern [[Olympic Games]] started in 1896 and included swimming races, after which the popularity of swimming pools began to spread. In the US, the [[Racquet Club of Philadelphia]] clubhouse (1907) boasts one of the world's first modern above-ground swimming pools.

Standards improved and training became essential. Home swimming pools became popular in the United States after [[World War II]] and the publicity given to swimming sports by Hollywood films such as [[Esther Williams]]' ''[[Million Dollar Mermaid]]'' made a home pool a desirable status symbol. More than 50 years later, the home or residential swimming pool is a common sight. Some small nations enjoy a thriving swimming pool industry (e.g., New Zealand pop. 4,116,900 [Source NZ Census 7 March 2006] \u2013 holds the record in pools per capita with 65,000 home swimming pools and 125,000 spa pools).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nA two-storey, white concrete swimming pool building composed of horizontal cubic volumes built in 1959 at the [[Royal Roads Military College]] is on the Registry of Historic Places of Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/visit-visite/affichage-display.aspx?id=2845|title=HistoricPlaces.ca - Recherche|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n=== World records ===\n{{Further|List of largest swimming pools}}\n[[Image:Schwimmbad Moskwa.jpg|thumb|[[Moskva Pool]], at one time the largest swimming pool in the world (1980)]]\nAccording to the [[Guinness World Records]], the largest swimming pool in the world is [[San Alfonso del Mar]] Seawater pool in [[Algarrobo, Chile|Algarrobo]], [[Chile]].

In the UK most pools are calibrated in metres, but older pools measured in yards still exist. In the US, pools tend to either be 25 yards ('''SCY'''-[[short course]] yards), 25 metres ('''SCM'''-short course metres) or 50 metres ([[long course]]). US high schools and the [[NCAA]] conduct short course (25 yards) competition. There are also many pools 33\u2153&nbsp;m long, so that 3 lengths = 100&nbsp;m. This pool dimension is commonly used to accommodate water polo.{{Cn|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[USA Swimming]] (USA-S) swims in both metric and non-metric pools. However, the international standard is metres, and world records are only recognized when swum in 50&nbsp;m pools (or 25 m for short course) but 25-yard pools are very common in the US. <!-- 50 m \u00b1 what?--> <!-- \u20130 +0.03 m at all points 0.3\u20130.8 m below waterline.--> In general, the shorter the pool, the faster the time for the same distance, since the swimmer gains speed from pushing off the wall after each turn at the end of the pool.\n\n'''Width:''' Most European pools are between 10 m and 50 m wide.{{Cn|date=November 2016}}\n\n'''Depth:''' The depth of a swimming pool depends on the purpose of the pool, and whether it is open to the public or strictly for private use. If it is a private casual, relaxing pool, it may go from {{convert|1.0|to|2.0|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} deep. If it is a public pool designed for diving, it may slope from {{convert|3.0|to|5.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the deep end. A children's play pool may be from {{convert|0.3|to|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} deep. Most public pools have differing depths to accommodate different swimmer requirements. In many jurisdictions, it is a requirement to show the water depth with clearly marked depths affixed to the pool walls.{{Cn|date=November 2016}}\n\n== Types ==\n[[Image:Girls playing in a small pool.jpg|thumb|right|Children playing in an above-ground pool]]\nPools can be either indoors or outdoors. They can be of any size and shape, and inground or above ground.

The main types of in-ground pools are gunite [[shotcrete]], concrete, [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]]-lined, and one-piece fiberglass shells.\n\nMany countries now have strict [[pool fence|pool fencing]] requirements for private swimming pools, which require pool areas to be isolated so that unauthorized children younger than six years cannot enter. Many countries require a similar level of protection for the children residing in or visiting the house, although many pool owners prefer the visual aspect of the pool in close proximity to their living areas, and will not provide this level of protection. There is no consensus between states or countries on the requirements to fence private swimming pools, and in many places they are not required at all, particularly in rural settings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swimmingpool.com/safety/pool-safety-guidelines|title=Pool Safety Guidelines|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== Children's pools ====\nInexpensive temporary [[polyvinyl chloride]] pools can be bought in supermarkets and taken down after summer. They are used mostly outdoors in yards, are typically shallow, and often their sides are inflated with air to stay rigid. When finished, the water and air can be let out and this type of pool can be folded up for convenient storage. They are regarded in the swimming pool industry as \"splasher\" pools intended for cooling off and amusing toddlers and children, not for swimming, hence the alternate name of \"kiddie\" pools.{{cn|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[Toy]]s are available for children and other people to play with in pool water. They are often blown up with air so they are soft but still reasonably rugged, and can float in water.\n\n=== Public pools ===\n[[Image:Tooting Bec Lido 20080724.JPG|right|thumb|[[Tooting Bec Lido]], in South London]]\n\nPublic pools are often part of a larger leisure centre or recreational complex. These centres often have more than one pool, such as an indoor heated pool, an outdoor ([[Water chlorination|chlorinated]], [[Salt water chlorination|saltwater]] or [[ozonated]]) pool which may be heated or unheated, a shallower children's pool, and a paddling pool for toddlers and infants. There may also be a [[sauna]] and one or more [[hot tub]]s or [[spa]] pools (\"[[jacuzzi]]s\").\n\nMany upscale hotels and holiday resorts have a swimming pool for use by their guests. If a pool is in a separate building, the building may be called a [[natatorium]]. The building may sometimes also have facilities for related activities, such as a diving tank. Larger pools sometimes have a [[Springboard|diving board]] affixed at one edge above the water.\n\nMany public swimming pools are [[rectangle]]s 25&nbsp;m or 50&nbsp;m long, but they can be any size and shape. There are also elaborate pools with [[artificial waterfall]]s, fountains, [[splash pad]]s, wave machines, varying depths of water, bridges, and island bars.\n\nSome swimming facilities have [[locker]]s for clothing and other belongings. The lockers can require a coin to be inserted in a slot, either as deposit or payment. There are usually showers - sometimes mandatory - before and/or after swimming. There are often also lifeguards to ensure the safety of users.\n\nWading or paddling pools are shallow bodies of water intended for use by small children, usually in parks. Concrete wading pools come in many shapes, traditionally rectangle, square or circle. Some are filled and drained daily due to lack of a filter system. Staff chlorinate the water to ensure health and safety standards.{{cn|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== Competition pools ===\n[[File:UofMinnesotaNatatorium.jpg|thumb|right|Racing pool at the [[University of Minnesota]]]]\n[[Image:Swimming pool 50m 2008.svg|thumb|400px|A simplified diagram of the [[FINA]] long course swimming pool standard, used at the World Championships and [[Summer Olympics]] ]]\n:''See: [[#Dimensions]] (above) and [[Swimming (sport)#Competition pools]]''\n\nThe [[FINA|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de la Natation]] (FINA, International Swimming Federation) sets standards for competition pools: {{convert|25|or|50|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} long and at least {{convert|1.35|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep. Competition pools are generally indoors and heated to enable their use all year round, and to more easily comply with the regulations regarding temperature, lighting, and automatic officiating equipment.\n\nAn [[Olympic-size swimming pool]] (first used at the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]]) is a pool that meets FINA's additional standards for the Olympic Games and for world championship events. It must be {{convert|50|by|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, divided into eight lanes of {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} each, plus two areas of {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} at each side of the pool. Depth must be at least {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"fr3\">{{Cite web|title=FR 3 swimming pools for Olympic Games and world championships|url=http://www.fina.org/content/fr-3-swimming-pools-olympic-games-and-world-championships|publisher=[[Federation Internationale de la Natation]]|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe water must be kept at {{convert|25|\u2013|28|C|F}} and the lighting level at greater than 1500 [[lux]]. There are also regulations for color of lane rope, positioning of [[backstroke flag]]s (5 metres from each wall), and so on.<ref name=\"fr3\"/> Pools claimed to be \"Olympic pools\" do not always meet these regulations, as FINA cannot police use of the term. [[Aquatic timing system|Touchpads]] are mounted on both walls for long course meets and each end for short course.\n\nA pool may be referred to as fast or slow, depending on its physical layout.<ref>\"[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2002/zesiger-pool-1009.html Zesiger pool design]\", [[Zesiger sports and fitness center]], [[MIT]], accessed 4 February 2007</ref>\nSome design considerations allow the reduction of swimming [[Drag (physics)|resistance]] making the pool faster: namely, proper pool depth, elimination of currents, increased lane width, energy absorbing racing lane lines and gutters, and the use of other innovative hydraulic, acoustic and illumination designs.\n\n=== Exercise pools ===\nIn the last two decades, a new style of pool has gained popularity. These consist of a small vessel (usually about 2.5 \u00d7 5 m) in which the swimmer swims in place, either against the push of an artificially generated water current or against the pull of restraining devices. These pools have several names, such as ''swim spas'', ''[[swimming machine]]s'', or ''swim systems''. They are all examples of different modes of [[resistance swimming]].\n\n=== Hot tubs and spa pools ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Home-spa.jpg|thumb|right|A home spa]]\n[[File:Hot tub IMG 9519.jpg|thumb|left|A boy relaxing in a hot tub]]\n\nHot tubs and spa pools are common heated pools used for relaxation and sometimes for therapy. Commercial spas are common in the swimming pool area or sauna area of a [[health club]] or fitness centre, in men's clubs, women's clubs, motels and exclusive five-star hotel suites. Spa clubs may have very large pools, some segmented into increasing temperatures. In Japan, men's clubs with many spas of different size and temperature are common. Commercial spas are generally made of concrete, with a [[mosaic]] tiled interior. More recently with the innovation of the pre-form composite method where mosaic tiles are bonded to the shell this enables commercial spas to be completely factory manufactured to specification and delivered in one piece. Hot tubs are typically made somewhat like a [[wine barrel]] with straight sides, from wood such as [[Californian redwood]] held in place by metal hoops. Immersion of the head is not recommended in spas or hot tubs due to a potential risk of underwater entrapment from the pump suction forces. However, commercial installations in many countries must comply with various safety standards which reduce this risk considerably.\n\nHome spas are a worldwide retail item in western countries since the 1980s, and are sold in dedicated spa stores, pool shops, [[department store]]s, the Internet, and catalog sales books. They are almost always made from heat-extruded [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]] sheet [[Perspex]], often colored in [[marble]] look-alike patterns. They rarely exceed {{convert|6|m2|abbr=on}} and are typically {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}} deep, restricted by the availability of the raw sheet sizes (typically manufactured in Japan). There is often a mid-depth seating or lounging system, and contoured lounger style reclining seats are common. Upmarket spas include various jet nozzles (massage, pulsating, etc.), a drinks tray, lights, [[LCD]] flat-screen TV sets and other features that make the pool a recreation center. Due to their family-oriented nature, home spas are normally operated from {{convert|36|to|39|C|F}}. Many pools are incorporated in a [[Coast Redwood|redwood]] or simulated wood surround, and are termed \"portable\" as they may be placed on a [[patio]] rather than sunken into a permanent location. Some portable spas are shallow and narrow enough to fit sideways through a standard door and be used inside a room. Low power electric immersion heaters are common with home spas.\n\nWhirlpool tubs first became popular in America during the 1960s and 1970s. A spa is also called a \"jacuzzi\" in USA since the word became a generic after plumbing component manufacturer [[Jacuzzi]] introduced the \"spa whirlpool\" in 1968. Air bubbles may be introduced into the [[nozzle]]s via an air-bleed [[venturi pump]] that combines cooler air with the incoming heated water to cool the pool if the temperature rises uncomfortably high. Some spas have a constant stream of bubbles fed via the seating area of the pool, or a footwell area. This is more common as a temperature control device where the heated water comes from a natural (uncontrolled heat) [[geothermal]] source, rather than artificially heated. Water temperature is usually very warm to hot \u2014 {{convert|38|to|42|C|F}}, so bathers usually stay in for only 20 to 30 minutes. [[Bromine]] or [[mineral sanitizer]]s are often recommended as sanitizers for spas because [[chlorine]] dissipates at a high temperature thereby heightening its strong chemical smell. [[Ozone]] is an effective bactericide and is commonly included in the circulation system with cartridge filtration, but not with sand media filtration due to clogging problems with turbid body fats.\n\n=== Ocean pools ===\n[[Image:SydneyRockPool.jpg|thumb|right|An ocean pool at [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee]] in Sydney, Australia]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, especially in Australia, [[Ocean pools in Australia|ocean pools]] were built, typically on headlands by enclosing part of the rock shelf, with water circulated through the pools by flooding from tidal tanks or by regular flooding over the side of the pools at high tide. This continued a pre-European tradition of bathing in rockpools with many of the current sites being expanded from sites used by [[Aboriginal Australians]] or early European settlers. Bathing in these pools provided security against both rough surf and sea life. There were often separate pools for women and men, or the pool was open to the sexes at different times with a break for bathers to climb in without fear of observation by the other sex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/northcoast/stories/s1519973.htm|title=Stories from the Yamba ocean pool|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=1 December 2005|accessdate=28 December 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530222326/http://www.abc.net.au/northcoast/stories/s1519973.htm|archivedate=30 May 2006}}</ref>\nThese were the forerunners of modern \"Olympic\" pools. A variation was the later development of sea- or harbour-side pools that circulated sea water using pumps. A pool of this type was the training ground for Australian Olympian [[Dawn Fraser]].\n\nThere are currently about 100 ocean baths in [[New South Wales]], which can range from small pools roughly 25 metres long and \"Olympic Sized\" (50m)  to the very large, such as the 50 \u00d7 100 m baths in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]. While most are free, a number charge fees, such as the [[Bondi Icebergs Club]] pool at [[Bondi Beach]]. Despite the development of chlorinated and heated pools, ocean baths remain a popular form of recreation in New South Wales.\n\nA semi-natural ocean pool exists on the central coast of [[New South Wales]]; it is called The [[Bogey Hole]].<!--Undue emphasis on one state in one country.-->\n\n=== Infinity pools ===\n[[File:2013-01-15 Sangri-La Cebu Infinity pool pano.jpeg|Infinity pool|thumb|right|300px]]\nAn [[infinity edge pool]] (also named ''negative edge'' or ''vanishing edge pool'') is a swimming pool which produces a visual effect of water extending to the horizon, vanishing, or extending to \"infinity\". Often, the water appears to fall into an ocean, lake, bay, or other similar body of water. The illusion is most effective whenever there is a significant change in elevation, though having a natural body of water on the horizon is not a limiting factor.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n=== Natural pools and ponds ===\n[[Natural pool]]s were developed in central and western Europe in the early and mid-1980s by designers and landscape architects with environmental concerns. They have recently been growing in popularity as an alternative to traditional swimming pools.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/05/garden/05pools.html|title=From Europe, a No-Chlorine Backyard Pool|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=5 April 2007|accessdate=22 May 2009 | first=Steven | last=Kurutz}}</ref> Natural pools are constructed bodies of water in which no chemicals or devices that disinfect or sterilize water are used, and all the cleaning of the pool is achieved purely with the motion of the water through biological filters and plants rooted hydroponically in the system. In essence, natural pools seek to recreate swimming holes and swimmable lakes, the environment where people feel safe swimming in a non-polluted, healthy, and ecologically balanced body of water.\n\nWater in natural pools has many desirable characteristics. For example, red eyes, dried-out skin and hair, and bleached bathing suits associated with overly chlorinated water are naturally absent in natural pools.{{citation_needed|date=March 2013}} Natural pools, by requiring a water garden to be a part of the system, offer different aesthetic options and can support amphibious wildlife such as snails, frogs, and salamanders, and even small fish if desired.\n\n=== Zero-entry swimming pools ===\nA ''zero-entry swimming pool'', also called a ''beach entry swimming pool'', has an edge or entry that gradually slopes from the deck into the water, becoming deeper with each step, in the manner of a natural beach. As there are no stairs or ladders to navigate, this type of entry assists older people, young children and people with [[Disability|accessibility]] problems (e.g., people with a physical disability) where gradual entry is useful.\n\n=== Indoor pools ===\n[[File:Indoor Swimming Pool.JPG|thumb|Indoor Swimming Pool]]\n\nIndoor pools are located inside, under a roof and insulated by at least three walls. Built for the purpose of year-round swimming or training, they are found in all climate types. Since the pool room is insulated, it is less likely the heat will escape; making it less expensive to heat than an outdoor pool where the heat will escape.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thespruce.com/swimming-pool-types-designs-and-styles-2737104|title=Get Inspired: Swimming Pools: Types, Designs, and Styles|work=The Spruce|access-date=25 August 2017}}</ref> Architecturally, the indoor pool may look like the rest of the house, but in terms of [[engineering]], variables such as heating and ventilation are required to ensure comfortable humidity levels. In addition to drainage and automatic pool covers, there are a number of ways to remove humidity in the air that is present with any wet indoor environment. Efficient dehumidification in the indoor pool environment prevents structural damage, lowers energy costs in addition to improving the room's climate to make it a comfortable swimming environment.\n\n== Other uses ==\n[[Image:NASA Swimming Pool.jpg|right|thumb|An astronaut prepares to descend into a swimming pool as part of a training exercise.]]\nSwimming pools are also used for events such as [[synchronised swimming|synchronized swimming]], [[water polo]], [[canoe polo]] and [[underwater sports]] such as [[underwater hockey]], [[underwater rugby]], [[finswimming]] and [[sport diving (sport)|sport diving]] as well as for teaching [[Diving (sport)|diving]], [[Lifeguards|lifesaving]] and [[scuba diving]] techniques. They have also been used for specialist tasks such as teaching water-[[ditching]] survival techniques for aircraft and submarine crews and [[astronaut]] training. Round-cornered, irregular swimming pools, such as the [[Nude Bowl]], were drained of water and used for vertical [[skateboarding]].\n\n== Sanitation ==\n{{Main|Swimming pool sanitation}}\nLevels of bacteria and viruses in swimming pool water must be kept low to prevent the spread of diseases and pathogens. Bacteria, [[algae]] and insect [[larva]]e can enter the pool if water is not properly sanitized. Pumps, mechanical [[sand filter]]s, and disinfectants are often used to sanitise the water.\n\nChemical disinfectants, such as [[chlorine]] (usually as a [[hypochlorite]] salt, such as [[calcium hypochlorite]]) and [[bromine]], are commonly used to kill pathogens. If not properly maintained, chemical sanitation can produce high levels of [[disinfection byproduct]]s. Sanitized swimming pool water can theoretically appear green if a certain amount of iron salts or [[copper chloride]] are present in the water.<ref>sahatchaiw.com. \"[http://sahatchaiw.com/page1/files/Swimmingpool.pdf The theory of colors of water in the swimming pool]\" (PDF) by Sahatchai Wanawongsawad</ref>\n\n[[Acesulfame potassium]] has been used to estimate how much urine is discharged by swimmers into a pool.<ref name=estl2017>{{cite journal|title=Sweetened Swimming Pools and Hot Tubs|journal=Environmental Science & Technology Letters|volume=4|issue=4|pages=149|date=1 March 2017|first=Lindsay K.|last=Jmaiff Blackstock|first2=Wei|last2=Wang|first3=Sai|last3=Vemula|first4=Benjamin T.|last4=Jaeger|first5=Xing-Fang|last5=Li|doi=10.1021/acs.estlett.7b00043|lay-url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/mar/01/how-much-pee-is-in-our-swimming-pools-new-urine-test-reveals-the-truth |laydate=1 March 2017 }} {{open access}}</ref> In  a Canadian study it was estimated that swimmers had released 75 litres of urine into a large pool that had about 830,000 litres of water and was a third of the size of an [[olympic pool]]. [[Hot tub]]s were found to have higher readings of the marker. While urine itself is sterile, its degradation products may  lead to asthma.<ref name=estl2017/>\n\n== Covers ==\nSwimming pool heating costs can be significantly reduced by using a pool cover. Use of a pool cover also can help reduce the amount of chemicals (chlorine, etc.) required by the pool. Outdoor pools gain heat from the sun, absorbing 75\u201385% of the solar energy striking the pool surface. Though a cover decreases the total amount of solar heat absorbed by the pool, the cover eliminates heat loss due to evaporation and reduces heat loss at night through its insulating properties. Most swimming pool heat loss is through evaporation.<ref>[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy00osti/28038.pdf Department of Energy: Conserving Energy and Heating your Swimming Pool with Solar Energy (PDF)]</ref>\n\nThe heating effectiveness of a cover depends on type. A transparent bubble cover is the most effective, as it allows the largest amount of solar flux into the pool itself. Thermal bubble covers are lightweight [[Ultraviolet|UV]]-stabilized floating covers designed to minimize heat loss on heated swimming pools. Typically they are only fitted in spring and fall (autumn) when the temperature difference between pool water and air temperature is greatest. When used consistently they can raise average pool temperatures of an outdoor pool by around 18 \u00b0Fahrenheit (11 \u00b0Celsius) when combined with a well sized solar pool heating system, or about 11\u00b0 Fahrenheit (6 \u00b0Celsius) without a solar heater but with full sun exposure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecoonline.com.au/do-solar-pool-blankets-work/|title=Solar Pool Bubble Blankets - Will They Warm My Pool}}{{Better source|date=February 2019}}</ref> Bubble covers are typically applied and removed by being rolled up on a device fitted to one side of the pool (see illustration). Covers fall apart after four or five years due to sun exposure, overheating in the sun while off the pool, and chlorine attacking the plastic. Bubble covers should be removed during super chlorination.\n\nA vinyl cover absorbs more sunlight directly, allowing temperature to rise faster, but ultimately prevents the pool from reaching as high a temperature as a clear cover.<ref name=EERE>{{cite web|title=EERE Consumer's Guide: Swimming Pool Covers|publisher=Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=13140|accessdate=20 October 2007}}</ref> Vinyl covers consist of a heavier material and have a longer life expectancy than bubble covers. Insulated vinyl covers are also available with a thin layer of flexible insulation sandwiched between two layers of vinyl.<ref name=\"EERE\"/> These covers are mandatory{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} to be fitted to all pools in areas of [[Australia]] that have experienced drought since 2006. This is an effort to conserve water, as much water evaporates and transpires.\n\nAn alternative to a continuous sheet of pool covering is multiple floating disks which are deployed and removed disk by disk. They cover most of the surface of the pool and offer evaporation reduction similar to continuous covers. Various types are available, for example opaque (for UV resistance and possible reduced algal growth), transparent (for esthetics), heavy and solid (for wind resistance), light and inflatable (for ease of handling).\n\n;Liquid covers\nLiquid covers are also an option. They use a microscopically thin layer of liquid (such as [[cetyl alcohol]]) that sits on the water surface and reduces evaporation, which is one of the major sources of heat loss as well as water loss. Unlike other covers, the pool can be used while the liquid cover is in place, and the nontoxic material is safe for people as well as pumping / filtering systems. The liquid must be replenished regularly (monthly or more), and may not be effective in windy areas (since the wind will disperse the thin layer).\n\n;Safety covers\nThese covers are typically attached all winter, by hooked bungee cords or hooked springs connected to the pool deck, and are usually made in a variety of materials including coated or laminated vinyl or polypropylene mesh. They are custom designed to stop leaf debris from entering the pool but more importantly they also provide safety for animals and small children when designed and installed properly. The custom safety cover was invented in 1957 by Fred Meyer Jr. of Meyco Pool Covers when he found a dead animal in his pool. Today covers are made to meet [[ASTM International|ASTM]] safety barrier standards and have kept animals, people and even large vehicles out of the pool. They are not popular in warmer climates, due to the five to ten minutes it takes to fit/remove them, making them inconvenient for repeated application and removal.\n\n=== Pool cover automation ===\n[[Image:PCS pool cover.jpg|thumb|right|Automatic pool cover]]\n\nA pool cover can be either manually, semi-automatically, or automatically operated. Manual covers can be folded and stored in an off site location. Pool cover reels can also be used to help manually roll up the pool cover. The reel, usually on wheels, can be rolled in or out of place.\n\nSemi-automatic covers use a motor-driven reel system. They use electrical power to roll and unroll the cover, but usually require someone to pull on the cover when unrolling, or guide the cover onto the reel when rolling up the cover. Semi-automatic covers can be built into the pool deck surrounding the pool, or can use reels on carts.\n\nAutomatic covers have permanently mounted reels that automatically cover and uncover the pool at the push of a button. They are the most expensive option, but are also the most convenient. These reels can be run from either an external motor requiring a pit to be dug beside the pool or using an internal motor that spins the reel.\n\nSome pool covers fit into tracks along the sides of the pool. This prevents anything or anybody from getting into the pool. They even support the weight of several people. They can be run manually, semi-automatically, or automatically. Safety covers may be required by inspectors for public pools.<ref name=EERE/>\n\n== Winterization ==\nIn areas which reach freezing temperature, it is important to close a pool properly. This varies greatly between in-ground and above-ground pools. By taking steps to properly secure the pool, it lessens the likelihood that the superstructure will be damaged or compromised by freezing water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swimmingpool.com/maintenance/maintenance-guides/closing-your-pool|title=Closing Your Pool|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015|archiveurl=https://poolbuyerguide.com|archivedate=24 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Closing vinyl and fibreglass pools ===\n[[Image:Poolcover.jpg|thumb|A rolled up Thermal Bubble pool cover, used to reduce water loss from evaporation and heat loss from the pool]]\n\nIn preparation for freezing temperatures, an in-ground swimming pool's pipes must be emptied. An above-ground pool should also be closed, so that ice does not drag down the pool wall, collapsing its structure. The plumbing is sealed with air, typically with rubber plugs, to prevent cracking from freezing water. The pool is typically covered to prevent leaves and other debris from falling in. The cover is attached to the pool typically using a stretch cord, similar to a [[bungee cord]] and hooks fitted into the pool surround. The skimmer is closed off or a floating device is placed into it to prevent it from completely freezing and cracking. Floating objects such as life rings or [[basketball]]s can be placed in the pool to avoid its freezing under the cover. Sand or DE filters must be backwashed, with the main drain plug removed and all water drained out. Drain plugs on the [[Filter (water)|pool filter]] are removed after the filter has been cleaned. The pool pump motor is taken under cover. Winter chemicals are added to keep the pool clean. The innovation of a composite construction of fibreglass, with an epoxy coating and porcelain ceramic tiles has led to the Pre-form, Composite-type with significant advantages over older methods; however, it also has increased sensitivity to metal staining.\n\nIn climates where there is no risk of freezing, closing down the pool for winter is not so important. Typically, the thermal cover is removed and stored. Winter sunlight can create an algae mess when a cover that has been left on all winter is removed. The pool is correctly [[pH]]-balanced and super-chlorinated. One part algaecide for every 50,000 parts of pool water should be added, and topped up each month. The pool should be filtered for one to two hours daily to keep the automated chlorination system active.{{Cn|date=November 2016}}\n\n== Safety ==\nPools pose a risk of [[drowning]], which may be significant for swimmers who are inexperienced, suffer from [[seizure]]s, or are susceptible to a heart or respiratory condition. [[Lifeguards]] are employed at most pools to execute water rescues and administer [[first aid]] as needed in order to reduce this risk.\n\nDiving in shallow areas of a pool may also lead to significant head and neck injuries; diving, especially head-first diving, should be done in the deepest point of the pool, minimally {{convert|2.4|m|abbr=on}}, but desirably {{convert|3.7|m|abbr=on}}, deeper if the distance between the water and the board is great.\n\nPools also present a risk of death due to drowning, particularly in young children. In regions where residential pools are common, drowning is a major cause of childhood death. As a precaution, many jurisdictions require that residential pools be enclosed with [[Pool fence|fencing]] to restrict unauthorized access. Many products exist, such as removable baby fences. The evidence for floating alarms and window/door alarms to reduce the risk of drowning is poor.<ref name=AFP2016>{{cite journal |last1=Mott |first1=TF |last2=Latimer |first2=KM |title=Prevention and Treatment of Drowning |journal=American Family Physician |date=1 April 2016 |volume=93 |issue=7 |pages=576\u201382 |pmid=27035042}}</ref> Some pools are equipped with computer-aided [[pool safety camera|drowning prevention]] or other forms of electronic safety and security systems.\n\nSuspended ceilings in indoor swimming pools are safety-relevant components. The selection of materials under tension should be done with care. Especially the selection of unsuitable stainless steels can cause problems with [[stress corrosion cracking]].<ref>M. Faller and P. Richner: \"Material selection of safety-relevant components in indoor swimming pools\", ''Materials and Corrosion'' 54 (2003) pp. 331\u2013338.

For example, in countries where women can be topless on the beach, this is often not allowed in a swimming pool, and a swimsuit must be worn. For men, wearing ordinary shorts and a tee shirt to go in the water at a beach may be considered acceptable, but pools usually require real swim suits or other dedicated water wear. Swimming with regular clothes on is not only unhygienic,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} but can potentially weigh a swimmer down should he or she need to be rescued. In France and some other European countries, [[board shorts]] are usually not allowed for hygienic reasons. In [[Nordic countries]] and in particular [[Iceland]], rules about clothing and hygiene are especially strict.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitreykjavik.is/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-17/12_view-51/ |title=Visit Reykjav\u00edk - The official tourist website of Reykjavik |accessdate=24 December 2009 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201141454/http://www.visitreykjavik.is/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-17/12_view-51/ |archivedate=1 December 2010  }}, accessed 24 December 2009</ref> When diving from a high board, swim suits are sometimes worn doubled up (one brief inside another) in case the outer suit tears on impact with the water.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Automated pool cleaner]] {{nb10}}\n* [[Bather load]]\n* [[Lido]]\n* [[List of water games]]\n* [[Neutral buoyancy pool]]\n* [[Pool fence]]\n* [[Pool noodle]]\n* [[Respiratory risks of indoor swimming pools]]\n* [[Swimming pool service technician]]\n* [[Uniform Swimming Pool, Spa and Hot Tub Code]]\n* [[Urine-indicator dye]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Swimming pools}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{room}}\n{{Pond}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Swimming Pool}}\n[[Category:Swimming pools| ]]\n[[Category:Garden features]]\n[[Category:Sports venues by type]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{short description|Artificial container filled with water intended for swimming}}\n{{pp-pc1|small=yes}}\n{{Redirect|Swimming pools|the Kendrick Lamar song|Swimming Pools (Drank)}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2019}}\n[[Image:backyardpool.jpg|thumb|[[Backyard]] swimming pool]]\n[[Image:Olympic Swimming Pool - Fast Lane.JPG|thumb|Olympic-sized swimming pool and starting blocks used for the [[2006 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia]]\n\nA '''swimming pool''', '''swimming bath''', '''wading pool''', '''paddling pool''', or simply '''pool''' is a structure designed to hold water to enable [[Human swimming|swimming]] or other leisure activities. Pools can be built into the ground (in-ground pools) or built above ground (as a freestanding construction or as part of a building or other larger structure), and are also a common feature aboard ocean-liners and cruise ships. In-ground pools are most commonly constructed from materials such as [[concrete]], natural stone, metal, plastic, or [[fiberglass]], and can be of a custom size and shape or built to a standardized size, the largest of which is the [[Olympic-size swimming pool]].\n\nMany [[health club]]s, [[fitness center]]s, and private clubs have pools used mostly for exercise or recreation. Many towns and cities provide public pools. Many hotels have pools available for their guests to use at their own leisure. Educational facilities such as high schools and universities sometimes have pools for physical education classes, recreational activities, leisure, and competitive athletics such as swimming teams. [[Hot tub]]s and [[spa]]s are pools filled with hot water, used for [[Relaxation (psychology)|relaxation]] or [[hydrotherapy]]. They are common in hotels and health clubs, and can also be found in many private homes. Special swimming pools are also used for [[Diving (sport)|diving]], specialized water sports, and [[physical therapy]], as well as for the training of [[lifeguard]]s and [[astronaut]]s.

It was formed in 1844, in response to concerns over drownings in the [[River Medway]], especially since would-be rescuers would often drown because they themselves could not swim to safety. The club used to swim in the River Medway, and would hold races, diving competitions and [[water polo]] matches. ''The South East Gazette'' July 1844 reported an aquatic breakfast party: coffee and biscuits were served on a floating raft in the river. The coffee was kept hot over a fire; club members had to tread water and drink coffee at the same time.  The last swimmers managed to overturn the raft, to the amusement of 150 spectators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maidstoneswimmingclub.net/index.php/about-us/our-history|title=Historical Titbits|publisher=Maidstone Swimming Club|accessdate=26 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Amateur Swimming Association]] was founded in 1869 in England,{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} and the Oxford Swimming Club in 1909.<ref>The City of Oxford Swimming Club, [http://oxfordswim.com/about/history/ History]</ref> The presence of indoor baths in the cobbled area of [[Merton Street]] might have persuaded the less hardy of the aquatic brigade to join.

In the UK most pools are calibrated in metres, but older pools measured in yards still exist. In the US, pools tend to either be 25 yards ('''SCY'''-[[short course]] yards), 25 metres ('''SCM'''-short course metres) or 50 metres ([[long course]]). US high schools and the [[NCAA]] conduct short course (25 yards) competition. There are also many pools 33\u2153&nbsp;m long, so that 3 lengths = 100&nbsp;m. This pool dimension is commonly used to accommodate water polo.{{Cn|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[USA Swimming]] (USA-S) swims in both metric and non-metric pools. However, the international standard is metres, and world records are only recognized when swum in 50&nbsp;m pools (or 25 m for short course) but 25-yard pools are very common in the US. <!-- 50 m \u00b1 what?--> <!-- \u20130 +0.03 m at all points 0.3\u20130.8 m below waterline.--> In general, the shorter the pool, the faster the time for the same distance, since the swimmer gains speed from pushing off the wall after each turn at the end of the pool.\n\n'''Width:''' Most European pools are between 10 m and 50 m wide.{{Cn|date=November 2016}}\n\n'''Depth:''' The depth of a swimming pool depends on the purpose of the pool, and whether it is open to the public or strictly for private use. If it is a private casual, relaxing pool, it may go from {{convert|1.0|to|2.0|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} deep. If it is a public pool designed for diving, it may slope from {{convert|3.0|to|5.5|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in the deep end. A children's play pool may be from {{convert|0.3|to|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} deep. Most public pools have differing depths to accommodate different swimmer requirements. In many jurisdictions, it is a requirement to show the water depth with clearly marked depths affixed to the pool walls.{{Cn|date=November 2016}}\n\n== Types ==\n[[Image:Girls playing in a small pool.jpg|thumb|right|Children playing in an above-ground pool]]\nPools can be either indoors or outdoors. They can be of any size and shape, and inground or above ground. Most pools are permanent fixtures, while others are temporary, collapsible structures.\n\n=== Private pools ===\nPrivate pools are usually smaller than public pools, on average {{convert|12|x|24|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} to {{convert|20|x|40|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}} whereas public pools usually start at {{convert|80|ft|m|abbr=on|order=flip}}.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Home pools can be permanently built-in, or be assembled above ground and disassembled after summer.

The main types of in-ground pools are gunite [[shotcrete]], concrete, [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]]-lined, and one-piece fiberglass shells.\n\nMany countries now have strict [[pool fence|pool fencing]] requirements for private swimming pools, which require pool areas to be isolated so that unauthorized children younger than six years cannot enter. Many countries require a similar level of protection for the children residing in or visiting the house, although many pool owners prefer the visual aspect of the pool in close proximity to their living areas, and will not provide this level of protection. There is no consensus between states or countries on the requirements to fence private swimming pools, and in many places they are not required at all, particularly in rural settings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swimmingpool.com/safety/pool-safety-guidelines|title=Pool Safety Guidelines|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== Children's pools ====\nInexpensive temporary [[polyvinyl chloride]] pools can be bought in supermarkets and taken down after summer. They are used mostly outdoors in yards, are typically shallow, and often their sides are inflated with air to stay rigid. When finished, the water and air can be let out and this type of pool can be folded up for convenient storage. They are regarded in the swimming pool industry as \"splasher\" pools intended for cooling off and amusing toddlers and children, not for swimming, hence the alternate name of \"kiddie\" pools.{{cn|date=November 2016}}\n\n[[Toy]]s are available for children and other people to play with in pool water. They are often blown up with air so they are soft but still reasonably rugged, and can float in water.\n\n=== Public pools ===\n[[Image:Tooting Bec Lido 20080724.JPG|right|thumb|[[Tooting Bec Lido]], in South London]]\n\nPublic pools are often part of a larger leisure centre or recreational complex. These centres often have more than one pool, such as an indoor heated pool, an outdoor ([[Water chlorination|chlorinated]], [[Salt water chlorination|saltwater]] or [[ozonated]]) pool which may be heated or unheated, a shallower children's pool, and a paddling pool for toddlers and infants. There may also be a [[sauna]] and one or more [[hot tub]]s or [[spa]] pools (\"[[jacuzzi]]s\").\n\nMany upscale hotels and holiday resorts have a swimming pool for use by their guests. If a pool is in a separate building, the building may be called a [[natatorium]]. The building may sometimes also have facilities for related activities, such as a diving tank. Larger pools sometimes have a [[Springboard|diving board]] affixed at one edge above the water.\n\nMany public swimming pools are [[rectangle]]s 25&nbsp;m or 50&nbsp;m long, but they can be any size and shape. There are also elaborate pools with [[artificial waterfall]]s, fountains, [[splash pad]]s, wave machines, varying depths of water, bridges, and island bars.\n\nSome swimming facilities have [[locker]]s for clothing and other belongings. The lockers can require a coin to be inserted in a slot, either as deposit or payment. There are usually showers - sometimes mandatory - before and/or after swimming. There are often also lifeguards to ensure the safety of users.\n\nWading or paddling pools are shallow bodies of water intended for use by small children, usually in parks. Concrete wading pools come in many shapes, traditionally rectangle, square or circle. Some are filled and drained daily due to lack of a filter system. Staff chlorinate the water to ensure health and safety standards.{{cn|date=November 2016}}\n\n=== Competition pools ===\n[[File:UofMinnesotaNatatorium.jpg|thumb|right|Racing pool at the [[University of Minnesota]]]]\n[[Image:Swimming pool 50m 2008.svg|thumb|400px|A simplified diagram of the [[FINA]] long course swimming pool standard, used at the World Championships and [[Summer Olympics]] ]]\n:''See: [[#Dimensions]] (above) and [[Swimming (sport)#Competition pools]]''\n\nThe [[FINA|F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de la Natation]] (FINA, International Swimming Federation) sets standards for competition pools: {{convert|25|or|50|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} long and at least {{convert|1.35|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep. Competition pools are generally indoors and heated to enable their use all year round, and to more easily comply with the regulations regarding temperature, lighting, and automatic officiating equipment.\n\nAn [[Olympic-size swimming pool]] (first used at the [[1924 Summer Olympics|1924 Olympics]]) is a pool that meets FINA's additional standards for the Olympic Games and for world championship events. It must be {{convert|50|by|25|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide, divided into eight lanes of {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} each, plus two areas of {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} at each side of the pool.

There are also regulations for color of lane rope, positioning of [[backstroke flag]]s (5 metres from each wall), and so on.<ref name=\"fr3\"/> Pools claimed to be \"Olympic pools\" do not always meet these regulations, as FINA cannot police use of the term. [[Aquatic timing system|Touchpads]] are mounted on both walls for long course meets and each end for short course.\n\nA pool may be referred to as fast or slow, depending on its physical layout.<ref>\"[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2002/zesiger-pool-1009.html Zesiger pool design]\", [[Zesiger sports and fitness center]], [[MIT]], accessed 4 February 2007</ref>\nSome design considerations allow the reduction of swimming [[Drag (physics)|resistance]] making the pool faster: namely, proper pool depth, elimination of currents, increased lane width, energy absorbing racing lane lines and gutters, and the use of other innovative hydraulic, acoustic and illumination designs.\n\n=== Exercise pools ===\nIn the last two decades, a new style of pool has gained popularity. These consist of a small vessel (usually about 2.5 \u00d7 5 m) in which the swimmer swims in place, either against the push of an artificially generated water current or against the pull of restraining devices. These pools have several names, such as ''swim spas'', ''[[swimming machine]]s'', or ''swim systems''. They are all examples of different modes of [[resistance swimming]].\n\n=== Hot tubs and spa pools ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}\n[[File:Home-spa.jpg|thumb|right|A home spa]]\n[[File:Hot tub IMG 9519.jpg|thumb|left|A boy relaxing in a hot tub]]\n\nHot tubs and spa pools are common heated pools used for relaxation and sometimes for therapy. Commercial spas are common in the swimming pool area or sauna area of a [[health club]] or fitness centre, in men's clubs, women's clubs, motels and exclusive five-star hotel suites. Spa clubs may have very large pools, some segmented into increasing temperatures. In Japan, men's clubs with many spas of different size and temperature are common. Commercial spas are generally made of concrete, with a [[mosaic]] tiled interior. More recently with the innovation of the pre-form composite method where mosaic tiles are bonded to the shell this enables commercial spas to be completely factory manufactured to specification and delivered in one piece. Hot tubs are typically made somewhat like a [[wine barrel]] with straight sides, from wood such as [[Californian redwood]] held in place by metal hoops. Immersion of the head is not recommended in spas or hot tubs due to a potential risk of underwater entrapment from the pump suction forces. However, commercial installations in many countries must comply with various safety standards which reduce this risk considerably.\n\nHome spas are a worldwide retail item in western countries since the 1980s, and are sold in dedicated spa stores, pool shops, [[department store]]s, the Internet, and catalog sales books. They are almost always made from heat-extruded [[Polymethyl methacrylate|acrylic]] sheet [[Perspex]], often colored in [[marble]] look-alike patterns. They rarely exceed {{convert|6|m2|abbr=on}} and are typically {{convert|1|m|abbr=on}} deep, restricted by the availability of the raw sheet sizes (typically manufactured in Japan). There is often a mid-depth seating or lounging system, and contoured lounger style reclining seats are common. Upmarket spas include various jet nozzles (massage, pulsating, etc.), a drinks tray, lights, [[LCD]] flat-screen TV sets and other features that make the pool a recreation center. Due to their family-oriented nature, home spas are normally operated from {{convert|36|to|39|C|F}}. Many pools are incorporated in a [[Coast Redwood|redwood]] or simulated wood surround, and are termed \"portable\" as they may be placed on a [[patio]] rather than sunken into a permanent location. Some portable spas are shallow and narrow enough to fit sideways through a standard door and be used inside a room. Low power electric immersion heaters are common with home spas.\n\nWhirlpool tubs first became popular in America during the 1960s and 1970s. A spa is also called a \"jacuzzi\" in USA since the word became a generic after plumbing component manufacturer [[Jacuzzi]] introduced the \"spa whirlpool\" in 1968. Air bubbles may be introduced into the [[nozzle]]s via an air-bleed [[venturi pump]] that combines cooler air with the incoming heated water to cool the pool if the temperature rises uncomfortably high. Some spas have a constant stream of bubbles fed via the seating area of the pool, or a footwell area. This is more common as a temperature control device where the heated water comes from a natural (uncontrolled heat) [[geothermal]] source, rather than artificially heated. Water temperature is usually very warm to hot \u2014 {{convert|38|to|42|C|F}}, so bathers usually stay in for only 20 to 30 minutes. [[Bromine]] or [[mineral sanitizer]]s are often recommended as sanitizers for spas because [[chlorine]] dissipates at a high temperature thereby heightening its strong chemical smell. [[Ozone]] is an effective bactericide and is commonly included in the circulation system with cartridge filtration, but not with sand media filtration due to clogging problems with turbid body fats.\n\n=== Ocean pools ===\n[[Image:SydneyRockPool.jpg|thumb|right|An ocean pool at [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee]] in Sydney, Australia]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, especially in Australia, [[Ocean pools in Australia|ocean pools]] were built, typically on headlands by enclosing part of the rock shelf, with water circulated through the pools by flooding from tidal tanks or by regular flooding over the side of the pools at high tide. This continued a pre-European tradition of bathing in rockpools with many of the current sites being expanded from sites used by [[Aboriginal Australians]] or early European settlers. Bathing in these pools provided security against both rough surf and sea life. There were often separate pools for women and men, or the pool was open to the sexes at different times with a break for bathers to climb in without fear of observation by the other sex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/northcoast/stories/s1519973.htm|title=Stories from the Yamba ocean pool|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|date=1 December 2005|accessdate=28 December 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060530222326/http://www.abc.net.au/northcoast/stories/s1519973.htm|archivedate=30 May 2006}}</ref>\nThese were the forerunners of modern \"Olympic\" pools. A variation was the later development of sea- or harbour-side pools that circulated sea water using pumps. A pool of this type was the training ground for Australian Olympian [[Dawn Fraser]].\n\nThere are currently about 100 ocean baths in [[New South Wales]], which can range from small pools roughly 25 metres long and \"Olympic Sized\" (50m)  to the very large, such as the 50 \u00d7 100 m baths in [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]. While most are free, a number charge fees, such as the [[Bondi Icebergs Club]] pool at [[Bondi Beach]]. Despite the development of chlorinated and heated pools, ocean baths remain a popular form of recreation in New South Wales.\n\nA semi-natural ocean pool exists on the central coast of [[New South Wales]]; it is called The [[Bogey Hole]].<!--Undue emphasis on one state in one country.-->\n\n=== Infinity pools ===\n[[File:2013-01-15 Sangri-La Cebu Infinity pool pano.jpeg|Infinity pool|thumb|right|300px]]\nAn [[infinity edge pool]] (also named ''negative edge'' or ''vanishing edge pool'') is a swimming pool which produces a visual effect of water extending to the horizon, vanishing, or extending to \"infinity\". Often, the water appears to fall into an ocean, lake, bay, or other similar body of water. The illusion is most effective whenever there is a significant change in elevation, though having a natural body of water on the horizon is not a limiting factor.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n=== Natural pools and ponds ===\n[[Natural pool]]s were developed in central and western Europe in the early and mid-1980s by designers and landscape architects with environmental concerns. They have recently been growing in popularity as an alternative to traditional swimming pools.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/05/garden/05pools.html|title=From Europe, a No-Chlorine Backyard Pool|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=5 April 2007|accessdate=22 May 2009 | first=Steven | last=Kurutz}}</ref> Natural pools are constructed bodies of water in which no chemicals or devices that disinfect or sterilize water are used, and all the cleaning of the pool is achieved purely with the motion of the water through biological filters and plants rooted hydroponically in the system. In essence, natural pools seek to recreate swimming holes and swimmable lakes, the environment where people feel safe swimming in a non-polluted, healthy, and ecologically balanced body of water.\n\nWater in natural pools has many desirable characteristics. For example, red eyes, dried-out skin and hair, and bleached bathing suits associated with overly chlorinated water are naturally absent in natural pools.{{citation_needed|date=March 2013}} Natural pools, by requiring a water garden to be a part of the system, offer different aesthetic options and can support amphibious wildlife such as snails, frogs, and salamanders, and even small fish if desired.\n\n=== Zero-entry swimming pools ===\nA ''zero-entry swimming pool'', also called a ''beach entry swimming pool'', has an edge or entry that gradually slopes from the deck into the water, becoming deeper with each step, in the manner of a natural beach. As there are no stairs or ladders to navigate, this type of entry assists older people, young children and people with [[Disability|accessibility]] problems (e.g., people with a physical disability) where gradual entry is useful.\n\n=== Indoor pools ===\n[[File:Indoor Swimming Pool.JPG|thumb|Indoor Swimming Pool]]\n\nIndoor pools are located inside, under a roof and insulated by at least three walls. Built for the purpose of year-round swimming or training, they are found in all climate types. Since the pool room is insulated, it is less likely the heat will escape; making it less expensive to heat than an outdoor pool where the heat will escape.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thespruce.com/swimming-pool-types-designs-and-styles-2737104|title=Get Inspired: Swimming Pools: Types, Designs, and Styles|work=The Spruce|access-date=25 August 2017}}</ref> Architecturally, the indoor pool may look like the rest of the house, but in terms of [[engineering]], variables such as heating and ventilation are required to ensure comfortable humidity levels. In addition to drainage and automatic pool covers, there are a number of ways to remove humidity in the air that is present with any wet indoor environment. Efficient dehumidification in the indoor pool environment prevents structural damage, lowers energy costs in addition to improving the room's climate to make it a comfortable swimming environment.\n\n== Other uses ==\n[[Image:NASA Swimming Pool.jpg|right|thumb|An astronaut prepares to descend into a swimming pool as part of a training exercise.]]\nSwimming pools are also used for events such as [[synchronised swimming|synchronized swimming]], [[water polo]], [[canoe polo]] and [[underwater sports]] such as [[underwater hockey]], [[underwater rugby]], [[finswimming]] and [[sport diving (sport)|sport diving]] as well as for teaching [[Diving (sport)|diving]], [[Lifeguards|lifesaving]] and [[scuba diving]] techniques. They have also been used for specialist tasks such as teaching water-[[ditching]] survival techniques for aircraft and submarine crews and [[astronaut]] training. Round-cornered, irregular swimming pools, such as the [[Nude Bowl]], were drained of water and used for vertical [[skateboarding]].\n\n== Sanitation ==\n{{Main|Swimming pool sanitation}}\nLevels of bacteria and viruses in swimming pool water must be kept low to prevent the spread of diseases and pathogens. Bacteria, [[algae]] and insect [[larva]]e can enter the pool if water is not properly sanitized. Pumps, mechanical [[sand filter]]s, and disinfectants are often used to sanitise the water.\n\nChemical disinfectants, such as [[chlorine]] (usually as a [[hypochlorite]] salt, such as [[calcium hypochlorite]]) and [[bromine]], are commonly used to kill pathogens. If not properly maintained, chemical sanitation can produce high levels of [[disinfection byproduct]]s. Sanitized swimming pool water can theoretically appear green if a certain amount of iron salts or [[copper chloride]] are present in the water.<ref>sahatchaiw.com. \"[http://sahatchaiw.com/page1/files/Swimmingpool.pdf The theory of colors of water in the swimming pool]\" (PDF) by Sahatchai Wanawongsawad</ref>\n\n[[Acesulfame potassium]] has been used to estimate how much urine is discharged by swimmers into a pool.<ref name=estl2017>{{cite journal|title=Sweetened Swimming Pools and Hot Tubs|journal=Environmental Science & Technology Letters|volume=4|issue=4|pages=149|date=1 March 2017|first=Lindsay K.|last=Jmaiff Blackstock|first2=Wei|last2=Wang|first3=Sai|last3=Vemula|first4=Benjamin T.|last4=Jaeger|first5=Xing-Fang|last5=Li|doi=10.1021/acs.estlett.7b00043|lay-url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/mar/01/how-much-pee-is-in-our-swimming-pools-new-urine-test-reveals-the-truth |laydate=1 March 2017 }} {{open access}}</ref> In  a Canadian study it was estimated that swimmers had released 75 litres of urine into a large pool that had about 830,000 litres of water and was a third of the size of an [[olympic pool]]. [[Hot tub]]s were found to have higher readings of the marker. While urine itself is sterile, its degradation products may  lead to asthma.<ref name=estl2017/>\n\n== Covers ==\nSwimming pool heating costs can be significantly reduced by using a pool cover. Use of a pool cover also can help reduce the amount of chemicals (chlorine, etc.) required by the pool. Outdoor pools gain heat from the sun, absorbing 75\u201385% of the solar energy striking the pool surface. Though a cover decreases the total amount of solar heat absorbed by the pool, the cover eliminates heat loss due to evaporation and reduces heat loss at night through its insulating properties. Most swimming pool heat loss is through evaporation.<ref>[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy00osti/28038.pdf Department of Energy: Conserving Energy and Heating your Swimming Pool with Solar Energy (PDF)]</ref>\n\nThe heating effectiveness of a cover depends on type. A transparent bubble cover is the most effective, as it allows the largest amount of solar flux into the pool itself. Thermal bubble covers are lightweight [[Ultraviolet|UV]]-stabilized floating covers designed to minimize heat loss on heated swimming pools. Typically they are only fitted in spring and fall (autumn) when the temperature difference between pool water and air temperature is greatest. When used consistently they can raise average pool temperatures of an outdoor pool by around 18 \u00b0Fahrenheit (11 \u00b0Celsius) when combined with a well sized solar pool heating system, or about 11\u00b0 Fahrenheit (6 \u00b0Celsius) without a solar heater but with full sun exposure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecoonline.com.au/do-solar-pool-blankets-work/|title=Solar Pool Bubble Blankets - Will They Warm My Pool}}{{Better source|date=February 2019}}</ref> Bubble covers are typically applied and removed by being rolled up on a device fitted to one side of the pool (see illustration). Covers fall apart after four or five years due to sun exposure, overheating in the sun while off the pool, and chlorine attacking the plastic. Bubble covers should be removed during super chlorination.\n\nA vinyl cover absorbs more sunlight directly, allowing temperature to rise faster, but ultimately prevents the pool from reaching as high a temperature as a clear cover.<ref name=EERE>{{cite web|title=EERE Consumer's Guide: Swimming Pool Covers|publisher=Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy|url=http://www.eere.energy.gov/consumer/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=13140|accessdate=20 October 2007}}</ref> Vinyl covers consist of a heavier material and have a longer life expectancy than bubble covers. Insulated vinyl covers are also available with a thin layer of flexible insulation sandwiched between two layers of vinyl.<ref name=\"EERE\"/> These covers are mandatory{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} to be fitted to all pools in areas of [[Australia]] that have experienced drought since 2006. This is an effort to conserve water, as much water evaporates and transpires.\n\nAn alternative to a continuous sheet of pool covering is multiple floating disks which are deployed and removed disk by disk. They cover most of the surface of the pool and offer evaporation reduction similar to continuous covers. Various types are available, for example opaque (for UV resistance and possible reduced algal growth), transparent (for esthetics), heavy and solid (for wind resistance), light and inflatable (for ease of handling).\n\n;Liquid covers\nLiquid covers are also an option. They use a microscopically thin layer of liquid (such as [[cetyl alcohol]]) that sits on the water surface and reduces evaporation, which is one of the major sources of heat loss as well as water loss. Unlike other covers, the pool can be used while the liquid cover is in place, and the nontoxic material is safe for people as well as pumping / filtering systems. The liquid must be replenished regularly (monthly or more), and may not be effective in windy areas (since the wind will disperse the thin layer).\n\n;Safety covers\nThese covers are typically attached all winter, by hooked bungee cords or hooked springs connected to the pool deck, and are usually made in a variety of materials including coated or laminated vinyl or polypropylene mesh. They are custom designed to stop leaf debris from entering the pool but more importantly they also provide safety for animals and small children when designed and installed properly. The custom safety cover was invented in 1957 by Fred Meyer Jr. of Meyco Pool Covers when he found a dead animal in his pool. Today covers are made to meet [[ASTM International|ASTM]] safety barrier standards and have kept animals, people and even large vehicles out of the pool. They are not popular in warmer climates, due to the five to ten minutes it takes to fit/remove them, making them inconvenient for repeated application and removal.\n\n=== Pool cover automation ===\n[[Image:PCS pool cover.jpg|thumb|right|Automatic pool cover]]\n\nA pool cover can be either manually, semi-automatically, or automatically operated. Manual covers can be folded and stored in an off site location. Pool cover reels can also be used to help manually roll up the pool cover. The reel, usually on wheels, can be rolled in or out of place.\n\nSemi-automatic covers use a motor-driven reel system. They use electrical power to roll and unroll the cover, but usually require someone to pull on the cover when unrolling, or guide the cover onto the reel when rolling up the cover. Semi-automatic covers can be built into the pool deck surrounding the pool, or can use reels on carts.\n\nAutomatic covers have permanently mounted reels that automatically cover and uncover the pool at the push of a button. They are the most expensive option, but are also the most convenient. These reels can be run from either an external motor requiring a pit to be dug beside the pool or using an internal motor that spins the reel.\n\nSome pool covers fit into tracks along the sides of the pool. This prevents anything or anybody from getting into the pool. They even support the weight of several people. They can be run manually, semi-automatically, or automatically. Safety covers may be required by inspectors for public pools.<ref name=EERE/>\n\n== Winterization ==\nIn areas which reach freezing temperature, it is important to close a pool properly. This varies greatly between in-ground and above-ground pools. By taking steps to properly secure the pool, it lessens the likelihood that the superstructure will be damaged or compromised by freezing water.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swimmingpool.com/maintenance/maintenance-guides/closing-your-pool|title=Closing Your Pool|publisher=|accessdate=19 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924025830/http://www.swimmingpool.com/maintenance/maintenance-guides/closing-your-pool|archivedate=24 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Closing vinyl and fibreglass pools ===\n[[Image:Poolcover.jpg|thumb|A rolled up Thermal Bubble pool cover, used to reduce water loss from evaporation and heat loss from the pool]]\n\nIn preparation for freezing temperatures, an in-ground swimming pool's pipes must be emptied. An above-ground pool should also be closed, so that ice does not drag down the pool wall, collapsing its structure. The plumbing is sealed with air, typically with rubber plugs, to prevent cracking from freezing water. The pool is typically covered to prevent leaves and other debris from falling in. The cover is attached to the pool typically using a stretch cord, similar to a [[bungee cord]] and hooks fitted into the pool surround. The skimmer is closed off or a floating device is placed into it to prevent it from completely freezing and cracking. Floating objects such as life rings or [[basketball]]s can be placed in the pool to avoid its freezing under the cover. Sand or DE filters must be backwashed, with the main drain plug removed and all water drained out. Drain plugs on the [[Filter (water)|pool filter]] are removed after the filter has been cleaned. The pool pump motor is taken under cover. Winter chemicals are added to keep the pool clean. The innovation of a composite construction of fibreglass, with an epoxy coating and porcelain ceramic tiles has led to the Pre-form, Composite-type with significant advantages over older methods; however, it also has increased sensitivity to metal staining.\n\nIn climates where there is no risk of freezing, closing down the pool for winter is not so important. Typically, the thermal cover is removed and stored. Winter sunlight can create an algae mess when a cover that has been left on all winter is removed. The pool is correctly [[pH]]-balanced and super-chlorinated. One part algaecide for every 50,000 parts of pool water should be added, and topped up each month. The pool should be filtered for one to two hours daily to keep the automated chlorination system active.{{Cn|date=November 2016}}\n\n== Safety ==\nPools pose a risk of [[drowning]], which may be significant for swimmers who are inexperienced, suffer from [[seizure]]s, or are susceptible to a heart or respiratory condition. [[Lifeguards]] are employed at most pools to execute water rescues and administer [[first aid]] as needed in order to reduce this risk.\n\nDiving in shallow areas of a pool may also lead to significant head and neck injuries; diving, especially head-first diving, should be done in the deepest point of the pool, minimally {{convert|2.4|m|abbr=on}}, but desirably {{convert|3.7|m|abbr=on}}, deeper if the distance between the water and the board is great.\n\nPools also present a risk of death due to drowning, particularly in young children. In regions where residential pools are common, drowning is a major cause of childhood death. As a precaution, many jurisdictions require that residential pools be enclosed with [[Pool fence|fencing]] to restrict unauthorized access. Many products exist, such as removable baby fences. The evidence for floating alarms and window/door alarms to reduce the risk of drowning is poor.<ref name=AFP2016>{{cite journal |last1=Mott |first1=TF |last2=Latimer |first2=KM |title=Prevention and Treatment of Drowning |journal=American Family Physician |date=1 April 2016 |volume=93 |issue=7 |pages=576\u201382 |pmid=27035042}}</ref> Some pools are equipped with computer-aided [[pool safety camera|drowning prevention]] or other forms of electronic safety and security systems.\n\nSuspended ceilings in indoor swimming pools are safety-relevant components. The selection of materials under tension should be done with care. Especially the selection of unsuitable stainless steels can cause problems with [[stress corrosion cracking]].<ref>M. Faller and P. Richner: \"Material selection of safety-relevant components in indoor swimming pools\", ''Materials and Corrosion'' 54 (2003) pp. 331\u2013338.

For example, in countries where women can be topless on the beach, this is often not allowed in a swimming pool, and a swimsuit must be worn. For men, wearing ordinary shorts and a tee shirt to go in the water at a beach may be considered acceptable, but pools usually require real swim suits or other dedicated water wear. Swimming with regular clothes on is not only unhygienic,{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} but can potentially weigh a swimmer down should he or she need to be rescued. In France and some other European countries, [[board shorts]] are usually not allowed for hygienic reasons. In [[Nordic countries]] and in particular [[Iceland]], rules about clothing and hygiene are especially strict.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitreykjavik.is/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-17/12_view-51/ |title=Visit Reykjav\u00edk - The official tourist website of Reykjavik |accessdate=24 December 2009 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201141454/http://www.visitreykjavik.is/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-17/12_view-51/ |archivedate=1 December 2010  }}, accessed 24 December 2009</ref> When diving from a high board, swim suits are sometimes worn doubled up (one brief inside another) in case the outer suit tears on impact with the water.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Automated pool cleaner]] {{nb10}}\n* [[Bather load]]\n* [[Lido]]\n* [[List of water games]]\n* [[Neutral buoyancy pool]]\n* [[Pool fence]]\n* [[Pool noodle]]\n* [[Respiratory risks of indoor swimming pools]]\n* [[Swimming pool service technician]]\n* [[Uniform Swimming Pool, Spa and Hot Tub Code]]\n* [[Urine-indicator dye]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Commons category|Swimming pools}}\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{room}}\n{{Pond}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Swimming Pool}}\n[[Category:Swimming pools| ]]\n[[Category:Garden features]]\n[[Category:Sports venues by type]]\n[[Category:Bodies of water]]\n", "name_user": "2605:a601:ac47:3800:f478:ecaf:a663:bb93", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_pool"}

It stars [[Ethan Hawke]] and [[Uma Thurman]], with [[Jude Law]], [[Loren Dean]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Gore Vidal]], and [[Alan Arkin]] appearing in supporting roles.<ref name=challenging/> The film presents a [[biopunk]] vision of a future society driven by [[eugenics]] where potential children are conceived through genetic selection to ensure they possess the best hereditary traits of their parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://neuroethics.upenn.edu/resources/narrative-perspectives-neuroethics-in-books-and-film/ |title=NEUROETHICS &#124; The Narrative Perspectives |publisher=Neuroethics.upenn.edu |accessdate=2018-02-22}}</ref> The film centers on Vincent Freeman, played by Hawke, who was conceived outside the eugenics program and struggles to overcome [[genetic discrimination]] to realize his dream of going into space.\n\nThe film draws on concerns over [[reproductive technologies]] that facilitate eugenics, and the possible consequences of such technological developments for society. It also explores the idea of [[destiny]] and the ways in which it can and does govern lives. Characters in ''Gattaca'' continually battle both with society and with themselves to find their place in the world and who they are destined to be according to their genes.\n\nThe film's title is based on the letters G, A, T, and C, which stand for [[guanine]], [[adenine]], [[thymine]], and [[cytosine]], the four [[nucleobases]] of [[DNA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/11/science/11gene.html |title=Now: The Rest of the Genome |first=Carl |last=Zimmer |date=November 10, 2008 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> It was a 1997 nominee for the [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Art Direction]] and the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]].\n\n==Plot==\nIn the future, [[eugenics]] is common. A genetic registry database uses [[biometrics]] to classify those so created as \"valids\" while those conceived by traditional means and more susceptible to genetic disorders are known as \"in-valids\". [[Genetic discrimination]] is illegal, but in practice [[genotype]] profiling is used to identify valids to qualify for professional employment while in-valids are relegated to menial jobs.\n\nVincent Freeman is conceived without the aid of genetic selection; his genetic profile indicates a high probability of several disorders and an estimated lifespan of 30.2 years. His parents, regretting their decision, use genetic selection in conceiving their next child, Anton. Growing up, the two brothers often play a game of \"[[Chicken (game)|chicken]]\" by swimming out to sea as far as they can, with the first one returning to shore considered the loser. Vincent always loses. Vincent dreams of a career in space travel but is reminded of his genetic inferiority. One day, Vincent challenges Anton to a game of chicken and beats him. Anton starts to drown and is saved by Vincent. Shortly after, Vincent leaves home.\n\nYears later, Vincent works as an in-valid, cleaning office spaces including that of Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, a spaceflight conglomerate. He gets a chance to pose as a valid by using hair, skin, blood and urine samples from a donor, Jerome Eugene Morrow, who is a former swimming star paralyzed due to a car accident. With Jerome's genetic makeup, Vincent gains employment at Gattaca, and is assigned to be navigator for an upcoming trip to Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. To keep his identity hidden, Vincent must meticulously groom and scrub down daily to remove his own genetic material and pass daily DNA scanning and urine tests using Jerome's samples.\n\nGattaca becomes embroiled in controversy when one of its administrators is murdered a week before the flight. The police find a fallen eyelash of Vincent's at the scene. An investigation is launched to find the murderer, Vincent being the top suspect. Through this, Vincent becomes close to a co-worker, Irene Cassini, and falls in love with her. Though a valid, Irene has a higher risk of heart failure that will prevent her from joining any deep space Gattaca mission. Vincent also learns that Jerome's paralysis is by his own hand; after coming in second place in a swim meet, Jerome threw himself in front of a car. Jerome maintains that he was designed to be the best, yet wasn't, and that is the source of his suffering.\n\nVincent repeatedly evades the grasp of the investigation. Finally, it is revealed that Gattaca's mission director was the killer, with the administrator's threats to cancel the mission as a motive. Vincent learns that the detective who closed the case was his brother Anton, who in turn has become aware of Vincent's presence. The brothers meet, and Anton warns Vincent that what he is doing is illegal, but Vincent asserts that he has gotten to this position on his own merits. Anton challenges Vincent to one more game of chicken. As the two swim out in the dead of night, Anton expresses surprise at Vincent's stamina, so Vincent reveals that his strategy for winning was not to save energy for the swim back. Anton turns back and begins to drown, but Vincent rescues him and swims them both back to shore using [[celestial navigation]].\n\nOn the day of the launch, Jerome reveals that he has stored enough DNA samples for Vincent to last two lifetimes upon his return, and gives him an envelope to open once in flight. After saying goodbye to Irene, Vincent prepares to board but discovers there is a final genetic test, and he currently lacks any of Jerome's samples. He is surprised when Dr. Lamar, the person in charge of background checks, reveals that he knows Vincent has been posing as a valid. Lamar admits that his son looks up to Vincent and wonders whether his son, genetically selected but \"not all that they promised\", could break the limits just as Vincent has. He passes Vincent as a valid. As the rocket launches, Jerome dons his swimming medal and [[Self-immolation|immolates]] himself in his home's incinerator; Vincent opens the note from Jerome to find only a lock of Jerome's hair attached to it. Vincent muses on this, stating \"For someone who was never meant for this world, I must confess, I'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it. Of course, they say every atom in our bodies was once a part of a star. Maybe I'm not leaving; maybe I'm going home.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth = 25em}}\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Vincent Freeman, impersonating Jerome Eugene Morrow\n** [[Mason Gamble]] as young Vincent\n** Chad Christ as teenage Vincent\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as Irene Cassini\n* [[Jude Law]] as Jerome Eugene Morrow\n* [[Loren Dean]] as Anton Freeman\n** Vincent Nielson as young Anton\n** [[William Lee Scott]] as teenage Anton\n* [[Gore Vidal]] as Director Josef\n* [[Xander Berkeley]] as Dr. Lamar\n* [[Jayne Brook]] as Marie Freeman\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as Antonio Freeman\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Delivery nurse\n* [[Blair Underwood]] as Geneticist\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Caesar\n* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as German\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Detective Hugo\n* [[Dean Norris]] as Cop on the Beat\n* [[Ken Marino]] as Sequencing technician\n* Cynthia Martells as Cavendish\n* [[Gabrielle Reece]] as Gattaca Trainer\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2013}}\n[[File:CLA building complex.JPG|thumb|right|[[CLA Building]] complex]]\n[[File:Marin Civic Center interior.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marin County Civic Center]]]]\n\n===Filming===\nThe exteriors (including the roof scene) and some of the interior shots of the Gattaca complex were filmed at [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s 1960 [[Marin County Civic Center]] in [[San Rafael, California]].<ref name=sfgate/> The speakers in the complex broadcast announcements both in [[Esperanto]] language and English; Miko Sloper from the [[Esperanto-USA|Esperanto League of North America]] went to the recording studio to handle the Esperanto part.<ref>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tRJF2EhWtz0</ref> The parking lot scenes were shot at the [[Otis College of Art and Design]], distinguished by its punch card-like windows, located near [[Los Angeles International Airport]].

It stars [[Ethan Hawke]] and [[Uma Thurman]], with [[Jude Law]], [[Loren Dean]], [[Ernest Borgnine]], [[Gore Vidal]], and [[Alan Arkin]] appearing in supporting roles.<ref name=challenging/> The film presents a [[biopunk]] vision of a future society driven by [[eugenics]] where potential children are conceived through genetic selection to ensure they possess the best hereditary traits of their parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://neuroethics.upenn.edu/resources/narrative-perspectives-neuroethics-in-books-and-film/ |title=NEUROETHICS &#124; The Narrative Perspectives |publisher=Neuroethics.upenn.edu |accessdate=2018-02-22}}</ref> The film centers on Vincent Freeman, played by Hawke, who was conceived outside the eugenics program and struggles to overcome [[genetic discrimination]] to realize his dream of going into space.\n\nThe film draws on concerns over [[reproductive technologies]] that facilitate eugenics, and the possible consequences of such technological developments for society. It also explores the idea of [[destiny]] and the ways in which it can and does govern lives.

A genetic registry database uses [[biometrics]] to classify those so created as \"valids\" while those conceived by traditional means and more susceptible to genetic disorders are known as \"in-valids\". [[Genetic discrimination]] is illegal, but in practice [[genotype]] profiling is used to identify valids to qualify for professional employment while in-valids are relegated to menial jobs.\n\nVincent Freeman is conceived without the aid of genetic selection; his genetic profile indicates a high probability of several disorders and an estimated lifespan of 30.2 years. His parents, regretting their decision, use genetic selection in conceiving their next child, Anton. Growing up, the two brothers often play a game of \"[[Chicken (game)|chicken]]\" by swimming out to sea as far as they can, with the first one returning to shore considered the loser. Vincent always loses. Vincent dreams of a career in space travel but is reminded of his genetic inferiority. One day, Vincent challenges Anton to a game of chicken and beats him. Anton starts to drown and is saved by Vincent. Shortly after, Vincent leaves home.\n\nYears later, Vincent works as an in-valid, cleaning office spaces including that of Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, a spaceflight conglomerate. He gets a chance to pose as a valid by using hair, skin, blood and urine samples from a donor, Jerome Eugene Morrow, who is a former swimming star paralyzed due to a car accident. With Jerome's genetic makeup, Vincent gains employment at Gattaca, and is assigned to be navigator for an upcoming trip to Saturn's moon [[Titan (moon)|Titan]]. To keep his identity hidden, Vincent must meticulously groom and scrub down daily to remove his own genetic material and pass daily DNA scanning and urine tests using Jerome's samples.\n\nGattaca becomes embroiled in controversy when one of its administrators is murdered a week before the flight. The police find a fallen eyelash of Vincent's at the scene. An investigation is launched to find the murderer, Vincent being the top suspect. Through this, Vincent becomes close to a co-worker, Irene Cassini, and falls in love with her. Though a valid, Irene has a higher risk of heart failure that will prevent her from joining any deep space Gattaca mission. Vincent also learns that Jerome's paralysis is by his own hand; after coming in second place in a swim meet, Jerome threw himself in front of a car. Jerome maintains that he was designed to be the best, yet wasn't, and that is the source of his suffering.\n\nVincent repeatedly evades the grasp of the investigation. Finally, it is revealed that Gattaca's mission director was the killer, with the administrator's threats to cancel the mission as a motive. Vincent learns that the detective who closed the case was his brother Anton, who in turn has become aware of Vincent's presence. The brothers meet, and Anton warns Vincent that what he is doing is illegal, but Vincent asserts that he has gotten to this position on his own merits. Anton challenges Vincent to one more game of chicken. As the two swim out in the dead of night, Anton expresses surprise at Vincent's stamina, so Vincent reveals that his strategy for winning was not to save energy for the swim back. Anton turns back and begins to drown, but Vincent rescues him and swims them both back to shore using [[celestial navigation]].\n\nOn the day of the launch, Jerome reveals that he has stored enough DNA samples for Vincent to last two lifetimes upon his return, and gives him an envelope to open once in flight. After saying goodbye to Irene, Vincent prepares to board but discovers there is a final genetic test, and he currently lacks any of Jerome's samples. He is surprised when Dr. Lamar, the person in charge of background checks, reveals that he knows Vincent has been posing as a valid. Lamar admits that his son looks up to Vincent and wonders whether his son, genetically selected but \"not all that they promised\", could break the limits just as Vincent has. He passes Vincent as a valid. As the rocket launches, Jerome dons his swimming medal and [[Self-immolation|immolates]] himself in his home's incinerator; Vincent opens the note from Jerome to find only a lock of Jerome's hair attached to it. Vincent muses on this, stating \"For someone who was never meant for this world, I must confess, I'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it. Of course, they say every atom in our bodies was once a part of a star. Maybe I'm not leaving; maybe I'm going home.\"\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth = 25em}}\n* [[Ethan Hawke]] as Vincent Freeman, impersonating Jerome Eugene Morrow\n** [[Mason Gamble]] as young Vincent\n** Chad Christ as teenage Vincent\n* [[Uma Thurman]] as Irene Cassini\n* [[Jude Law]] as Jerome Eugene Morrow\n* [[Loren Dean]] as Anton Freeman\n** Vincent Nielson as young Anton\n** [[William Lee Scott]] as teenage Anton\n* [[Gore Vidal]] as Director Josef\n* [[Xander Berkeley]] as Dr. Lamar\n* [[Jayne Brook]] as Marie Freeman\n* [[Elias Koteas]] as Antonio Freeman\n* [[Maya Rudolph]] as Delivery nurse\n* [[Blair Underwood]] as Geneticist\n* [[Ernest Borgnine]] as Caesar\n* [[Tony Shalhoub]] as German\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Detective Hugo\n* [[Dean Norris]] as Cop on the Beat\n* [[Ken Marino]] as Sequencing technician\n* Cynthia Martells as Cavendish\n* [[Gabrielle Reece]] as Gattaca Trainer\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n{{more citations needed section|date=November 2013}}\n[[File:CLA building complex.JPG|thumb|right|[[CLA Building]] complex]]\n[[File:Marin Civic Center interior.jpg|thumb|right|[[Marin County Civic Center]]]]\n\n===Filming===\nThe exteriors (including the roof scene) and some of the interior shots of the Gattaca complex were filmed at [[Frank Lloyd Wright]]'s 1960 [[Marin County Civic Center]] in [[San Rafael, California]].<ref name=sfgate/> The speakers in the complex broadcast announcements both in [[Esperanto]] language and English; Miko Sloper from the [[Esperanto-USA|Esperanto League of North America]] went to the recording studio to handle the Esperanto part.<ref>https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=tRJF2EhWtz0</ref> The parking lot scenes were shot at the [[Otis College of Art and Design]], distinguished by its punch card-like windows, located near [[Los Angeles International Airport]].

The solar power plant mirrors sequence was filmed at the [[Solar Energy Generating Systems#Kramer Junction|Kramer Junction Solar Electric Generating Station]].\n\n===Design===\nThe movie uses a swimming treadmill in the opening minutes to punctuate the swimming and futuristic themes.<ref name=endless/> The futuristic electric cars<ref>https://www.theavanti.com/gattaca.html</ref> are based on 1960s car models like [[Rover P6]], [[Citro\u00ebn DS19]] and [[Studebaker Avanti]],<ref name=turbinecars/> and futuristic buildings represent [[modern architecture]] of the 1950s.\n\n===Title===\nThe film was shot under the working title ''The Eighth Day'', a reference to the seven days of creation in the Bible. However, by the time its release was scheduled for the fall of 1997, the Belgian film {{lang|fr|Le huiti\u00e8me jour|italic=yes}} had already been released in the US under the title ''[[The Eighth Day (1996 film)|The Eighth Day]]''. As a result, the film was retitled ''Gattaca''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/gattaca-on-hulu/|title=Gattaca on Hulu|work=Slashfilm}}</ref>\n\n=== Title sequence ===\nThe opening title sequence was created by Michael Riley of Shine design studio. It features closeups of body matter (fingernails and hair) hitting the floor accompanied by loud sounds as the objects strike the ground. We later learn that these are the result of Vincent's daily bodily scourings. According to Riley they created oversize models of the fingernails and hair to create the effect.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://watchthetitles.com/articles/00114-Gattaca|title=Gattaca title sequence - Watch the Titles|last=Vlaanderen|first=Remco|website=watchthetitles.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-11}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n\n===Box office===\n''Gattaca'' was released in theaters on October 24, 1997, and opened at number 5 at the box office; trailing ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]'', ''[[The Devil's Advocate (1997 film)|The Devil's Advocate]]'', ''[[Kiss the Girls (1997 film)|Kiss the Girls]]'', and ''[[Seven Years in Tibet (1997 film)|Seven Years in Tibet]]''.<ref name=thenumbersweekend/> Over the first weekend the film brought in $4.3 million.

On review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film received an approval rating of 81% based on 59 reviews, with a rating average of 7.08/10. The site's critical consensus states that \"Intelligent and scientifically provocative, ''Gattaca'' is an absorbing sci-fi drama that poses important interesting ethical questions about the nature of science.\"<ref name=rt/> On [[Metacritic]], the film received \"generally favorable reviews\" with a score of 64 out of 100, based on 20 reviews.<ref name=\"metacritic\"/> [[Roger Ebert]] stated, \"This is one of the smartest and most provocative of science fiction films, a thriller with ideas.\"<ref name=ebert/> [[James Berardinelli]] praised it for \"energy and tautness\" and its \"thought-provoking script and thematic richness.\"<ref name=reelviews/>\n\nAlthough critically acclaimed, ''Gattaca'' was not a box office success, but it is said to have crystallized the debate over the controversial topic of [[human genetic engineering]].<ref name=\"Jabr\" /><ref name=\"darnovsky\" /><ref name=popemcroberts/> The film's [[dystopia]]n depiction of \"[[genoism]]\" has been cited by many [[bioethicist]]s and laypeople in support of their hesitancy about, or opposition to, eugenics and the societal acceptance of the [[genetic determinism|genetic-determinist]] ideology that may frame it.<ref name=\"kirby\" /> In a 1997 review of the film for the journal ''Nature Genetics'', molecular biologist [[Lee M. Silver]] stated that \"''Gattaca'' is a film that all geneticists should see if for no other reason than to understand the perception of our trade held by so many of the public-at-large\".<ref name=\"silver\" />\n\nIn 2004, [[Bioethics|bioethicist]] [[James Hughes (sociologist)|James Hughes]] criticized the premise and influence of the film,<ref name=\"hughes\" /> arguing that:\n# Astronaut-training programs are entirely justified in attempting to screen out people with heart problems for safety reasons;\n# In the United States, people are already screened by insurance companies on the basis of their propensities to disease, for actuarial purposes;\n# Rather than banning genetic testing or genetic enhancement, society should develop [[genetic information privacy]] [[privacy law|laws]] such as the U.S. [[Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act]] signed into law on May 21, 2008 that allow justified forms of genetic testing and data aggregation, but forbid those that are judged to result in genetic discrimination. Citizens should then be able to make a complaint to the appropriate authority if they believe they have been discriminated against because of their genotype.\n\n===Accolades===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The album was primarily composed of recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs \"On the Way Home\" and \"I Am a Child\", singing lead on the latter. In 1997, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; Young did not appear at the ceremony. The three surviving members, Furay, Stills, and Young, appeared together as Buffalo Springfield at Young's annual Bridge School Benefit on October 23\u201324, 2010, and at Bonnaroo in the summer of 2011.

Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group \u2013 winners of the 1969 \"Best New Artist\" [[Grammy Award]] \u2013 was renamed [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]].{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=313}} The quartet debuted in Chicago on August 16, 1969, and later performed at the famous [[Woodstock Festival]], during which Young skipped the majority of the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: \"One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar\".{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=318\u2013320}} During the making of their first album, ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'' (March 11, 1970), the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. Stills continued throughout their lifelong relationship to criticize Young, saying that he \"wanted to play folk music in a rock band.\"{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=324}} Despite the tension, Young's tenure with CSN&Y coincided with the band's most creative and successful period, and greatly contributed to his subsequent success as a solo artist.\n\nYoung wrote \"[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]\" following the [[Kent State massacre]] on May 4, 1970. The song was quickly recorded by CSN&Y and immediately released as a single, even though CSN&Y's \"Teach Your Children\" was still climbing the singles charts.\n\n===''After the Gold Rush'', acoustic tour and ''Harvest'' (1970\u20131972)===\nLater in the year, Young released his third solo album, ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' (August 31, 1970), which featured, among others, [[Nils Lofgren]], [[Stephen Stills]], and CSNY bassist [[Greg Reeves]]. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. The eventual recording was less amplified than ''Everybody Knows This is Nowhere'', with a wider range of sounds. Young's newfound fame with CSNY made the album his commercial breakthrough as a solo artist, and it contains some of his best known work, including \"[[Tell Me Why (Neil Young song)|Tell Me Why]]\" and \"[[Don't Let It Bring You Down]]\", the country-influenced singles \"[[Only Love Can Break Your Heart]]\" and \"[[When You Dance I Can Really Love]]\", and the title track, \"[[After the Gold Rush (song)|After the Gold Rush]]\", played on piano, with dream-like lyrics that ran a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to [[environmentalism|environmental concerns]]. Young's bitter condemnation of racism in the heavy blues-rock song \"[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]\" (along with a later song entitled \"Alabama\") was also controversial with southerners in an era of desegregation, prompting [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] to decry Young by name in the lyrics to their hit \"[[Sweet Home Alabama (song)|Sweet Home Alabama]].\" However, Young said he was a fan of Skynyrd's music, and the band's front man [[Ronnie Van Zant]] was later photographed wearing a ''Tonight's the Night'' T-shirt [[Street Survivors|on the cover of an album]].\n\n[[File:Neil Young-early promo.jpg|thumb|Young in the 1970s]]\nIn the autumn of 1970, Young began a solo acoustic tour of North America, during which he played a variety of his Buffalo Springfield and CSNY songs on guitar and piano, along with material from his solo albums and a number of new songs. Some songs premiered by Young on the tour, like \"Journey through the Past\", would never find a home on a studio album, while other songs, like \"See the Sky About to Rain\", would only be released in coming years. With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young's tour, now entitled \"Journey Through the Past\", continued into early 1971, and its focus shifted more to newer songs he had been writing; he famously remarked that having written so many, he could not think of anything to do but play them. Many gigs were sold out, including concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]] and a pair of acclaimed hometown shows at Toronto's [[Massey Hall]], which were taped for a planned live album. The shows became legendary among Young fans, and the recordings were officially released nearly 40 years later as an official bootleg in Young's Archive series.\n\nNear the end of his tour, Young performed one of the new acoustic songs on the ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|Johnny Cash]]'' TV show. \"[[The Needle and the Damage Done]]\", a somber lament on the pain caused by [[heroin addiction]], had been inspired in part by Crazy Horse member [[Danny Whitten]], who eventually died while battling his drug problems.{{sfn|Williamson|2002|p=42}}{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=279}} While in Nashville for the Cash taping, Young accepted the invitation of [[Quadrafonic Sound Studios]] owner [[Elliot Mazer]] to record tracks there with a group of country-music session musicians who were pulled together at the last minute. Making a connection with them, he christened them [[The Stray Gators]], and began playing with them. Befitting the immediacy of the project, [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[James Taylor]] were brought in from the Cash taping to do background vocals.

The only remnant left of the original live concept was the album's live acoustic performance of \"Needle and the Damage Done.\"\n\nAfter his success with CSNY, Young purchased a ranch in the rural hills above Woodside and Redwood City in Northern California (\"Broken Arrow Ranch\", where he lived until his divorce in 2014.<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/inside-neil-youngs-nature-themed-opus-20160705|title=Inside Neil Young's Nature-Themed Opus|website=Rollingstone.com|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}</ref>). He wrote the song \"[[Old Man (song)|Old Man]]\" in honor of the land's longtime caretaker, Louis Avila. The song \"[[A Man Needs a Maid (song)|A Man Needs a Maid]]\" was inspired by his relationship with actress [[Carrie Snodgress]]. \"[[Heart of Gold (Neil Young song)|Heart of Gold]]\" was released as the first single from ''Harvest'', the only No.&nbsp;1 hit in his career. \"Old Man\" was also popular.\n\nThe album's recording had been almost accidental. Its mainstream success caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the ''[[Decade (Neil Young album)|Decade]]'' (1977) compilation, Young chose to include his greatest hits from the period, but his handwritten liner notes famously described \"Heart of Gold\" as the song that \"put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.\"\n\n===The \"Ditch\" Trilogy and personal struggles (1972\u20131974)===\nAlthough a new tour with The Stray Gators (now augmented by Danny Whitten) had been planned to follow up on the success of ''Harvest'', it became apparent during rehearsals that Whitten could not function due to drug abuse. On November 18, 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an apparent [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]/[[diazepam]] overdose. Young described the incident to ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s [[Cameron Crowe]] in 1975:<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/profile/story/9102786/neil_young_the_rs_interview|title=Neil Young: The RS Interview|magazine=Rollingstone.com|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref> \"[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd OD'd. That blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and ... insecure.\"\n\nOn the tour, Young struggled with his voice and the performance of drummer [[Kenny Buttrey]], a noted Nashville session musician who was unaccustomed to performing in the [[hard rock]] milieu; Buttrey was eventually replaced by former CSNY drummer [[Johnny Barbata]], while [[David Crosby]] and [[Graham Nash]] contributed rhythm guitar and backing vocals to the final dates of the tour. The album assembled in the aftermath of this incident, ''[[Time Fades Away]]'' (October 15, 1973), has often been described by Young as \"[his] least favorite record\", and was not officially released on CD until 2017 (as part of Young's [[Neil Young Archives#Official Release Series 05:|Official Release Series]]). Nevertheless, Young and his band tried several new musical approaches in this period. ''Time Fades Away'', for instance, was recorded live, although it was an album of new material, an approach Young would repeat with more success later on. ''Time'' was the first of three consecutive commercial failures which would later become known collectively to fans as the \"Ditch Trilogy\", as contrasted with the more middle-of-the-road pop of ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (1972).<ref name=\"UnCut\">{{cite news|last=Pinnock|first=Tom|title=Neil Young's 'Time Fades Away': 'Harvest's unlikely follow-up|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/neil-young/neil-young-s-time-fades-away-harvests-unlikely-follow-up-feature|accessdate=January 3, 2014|newspaper=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=May 2010|issue=156}}</ref> These subsequent albums were seen as more challenging expressions of Young's inner conflicts on achieving success, expressing both the specific struggles of his friends and himself, and the decaying idealism of his generation in America at the time.\n\n[[File:Neil Young in Austin, 1976.jpg|thumb|Young in [[Austin, Texas]], on November 9, 1976]]\n\nIn the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by [[Nils Lofgren]] on guitar and piano and ''Harvest''/''Time Fades Away'' veteran [[Ben Keith]] on pedal steel guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and [[roadie]] [[Bruce Berry]], Young recorded an album specifically inspired by the incidents, ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'' (June 20, 1975). The album's dark tone and rawness led Reprise to delay its release and Young had to pressure them for two years before they would do so.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=430}} While his record company was stalling, Young recorded another album, ''[[On the Beach (Neil Young album)|On the Beach]]'' (July 16, 1974), which presented a more melodic, acoustic sound at times, including a recording of the older song \"See the Sky About to Rain\", but dealt with similarly dark themes such as the collapse of 1960s folk ideals, the downside of success and the underbelly of the Californian lifestyle. Like ''Time Fades Away'', it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favorite, presenting some of Young's most original work. A review of the 2003 re-release on CD of ''On the Beach'' described the music as \"mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary\".<ref name=\"sven\">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.com/a&e/soundfury904.htm |title=Neil Young \u2013 On the Beach (Reprise) |newspaper=The Santa Barbara Independent |date=March 18, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040421143346/http://www.independent.com/a%26e/soundfury904.htm |archivedate=April 21, 2004 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter completing ''On the Beach'', Young reunited with ''Harvest'' producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album, ''[[Homegrown (Neil Young album)|Homegrown]]''. Most of the songs were written after Young's break-up with Carrie Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though ''Homegrown'' was reportedly entirely complete, Young decided, not for the first or last time in his career, to drop it and release something else instead, in this case, ''Tonight's the Night'', at the suggestion of [[The Band|Band]] bassist [[Rick Danko]].{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=469}} Young further explained his move by saying: \"It was a little too personal ... it scared me\".{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=469}} Most of the songs from ''Homegrown'' were later incorporated into other Young albums, but the original album never surfaced. ''Tonight's the Night'' when finally released in 1975, sold poorly, as had the previous albums of the \"ditch\" trilogy, and received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album. In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=433}}\n\n===Reunions, retrospectives and ''Rust Never Sleeps'' (1974\u20131979)===\nYoung reunited with [[Crosby, Stills, and Nash]] after a four-year hiatus in the summer of 1974 for a concert tour which was recorded and released in 2014 as [[CSNY 1974]]. It was one of the first ever stadium tours, and the largest tour in which Young has participated to date.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=452}}\n\nIn 1975, Young reformed Crazy Horse with [[Frank Sampedro]] on guitar as his backup band for his eighth album, ''[[Zuma (album)|Zuma]]'' (November 10, 1975). Many of the songs dealt with the theme of failed relationships; \"[[Cortez the Killer]]\", a retelling of the [[Spanish conquest]] of Mexico from the viewpoint of the [[Aztec]]s, may also be heard as an allegory of love lost. ''Zuma''{{'}}s closing track, \"Through My Sails\", was the only released fragment from aborted sessions with Crosby, Stills and Nash for another group album.\n\nIn 1976, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album ''[[Long May You Run]]'' (September 20, 1976), credited to [[The Stills-Young Band]]; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a [[telegram]] that read: \"Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way.

Performers on the record included [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Emmylou Harris]] and Young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Nicolette Larson]] along with Crazy Horse. In 1977, Young also released the compilation ''[[Decade (Neil Young album)|Decade]]'', a personally selected set of songs spanning every aspect of his work, including a handful of previously unreleased songs. The record included less commercial album tracks alongside radio hits.\n\n''[[Comes a Time]]'' (October 2, 1978), Young's first entirely new solo recording since the mid-1970s, also featured Larson and Crazy Horse.  The album became Young's most commercially accessible album in quite some time and marked a return to his folk roots, including a cover of [[Ian Tyson]]'s \"[[Four Strong Winds]]\", a song Young associated with his childhood in Canada.  Another of the album's songs, \"[[Lotta Love]]\", was also recorded by Larson, with her version reaching number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1979.  In 1978, much of the filming was done for Young's film ''[[Human Highway]]'', which took its name from a song featured on ''Comes a Time''. Over four years, Young would spend [[United States dollar|$]]3,000,000 of his own money on production (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3000000|1978}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). This also marked the beginning of his brief collaboration with the post-punk band [[Devo]], whose members appeared in the film.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=575\u2013577}}\n\nYoung set out in 1978 on the lengthy \"Rust Never Sleeps\" tour, in which he played a wealth of new material. Each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. The electric sets, featuring an abrasive style of playing, were influenced by the punk rock [[zeitgeist]] of the late 1970s and, provided a stark contrast from Young's previous, folk-inspired album ''Comes a Time''.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=529\u2013537}} Two new songs, the acoustic \"[[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)]]\" and electric \"[[Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)]]\" were the centerpiece of the new material. Young had collaborated with the [[art punk]] band [[Devo]] on a cacophonous version of Hey Hey, My My at the [[Different Fur]] studio in San Francisco and, would later introduce the song to Crazy Horse.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531\u2013532}} The lyrics, \"It's better to burn out than to fade away.\" were widely quoted by his peers and by critics.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531\u2013532}} The album has also widely been considered a precursor of grunge music and many grunge artists have said they were inspired by Young's distorted guitars on the B side to this album. Young also compared the rise of [[Johnny Rotten]] with that of the recently deceased \"King\" [[Elvis Presley]], who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an [[Pop icon|icon]]. Rotten returned the favour by playing one of Young's songs, \"Revolution Blues\" from ''[[On the Beach (Neil Young album)|On the Beach]]'', on a London radio show, an early sign of Young's eventual embrace by a number of punk-influenced alternative musicians.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schneider|first1=Martin|title=DJ Johnny Rotten plays music from his own record collection on the radio, 1977|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/dj_johnny_rotten_plays_music_from_his_own_record_collection_on_the_radio_19|website=Dangerousminds.net|accessdate=April 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nYoung's two accompanying albums ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (July 2, 1979; new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and ''[[Live Rust]]'' (November 19, 1979) (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B.  A movie version of the concerts, also called ''Rust Never Sleeps'' (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym \"Bernard Shakey\". Young worked with rock artist [[Jim Evans (artist)|Jim Evans]] to create the poster art for the film, using the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Jawas]] as a theme. Young's work since ''Harvest'' (1972) had alternated between being rejected by mass audiences and being seen as backward-looking by critics, sometimes both at once, and now he was suddenly viewed as relevant by a new generation, who began to discover his earlier work. Readers and critics of ''Rolling Stone'' voted him Artist of the Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' as Album of the Year, and voted him Male Vocalist of the Year as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/rolling.htm#1979 |title=Albums Of The Year And End Of Year Critic Lists |publisher=Rocklist.net |accessdate=5 February 2020 }}</ref> ''[[The Village Voice]]'' named ''Rust Never Sleeps'' as the year's winner in the [[Pazz & Jop]] Poll, a survey of nationwide critics, and honored Young as the Artist of the Decade.

Young was backed by the Shocking Pinks for the supporting US tour. ''Trans'' (1982) had already drawn the ire of label head [[David Geffen]] for its lack of commercial appeal, and with ''Everybody's Rockin''{{'}} following only seven months later, Geffen Records sued Young for making music \"unrepresentative\" of himself.<ref>{{cite book|title=A fiction of the past: the sixties in American history|last=Cavallo|first=Dominick|year=1999|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-21930-7|oclc=39981636|url=https://archive.org/details/fictionofpastsix00cava}}</ref> The album was also notable as the first for which Young made commercial music videos \u2013 [[Tim Pope]] directed the videos for \"Wonderin'\" and \"Cry, Cry, Cry\".

Young's lack of productivity was largely due to the ongoing legal battle with Geffen, although he was also frustrated that the label had rejected his 1982 country album ''[[Old Ways]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22521|pure_url=yes}}|title=Old Ways album review|website=allmusic|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}</ref> It was also the year when Young's third child was born, a girl named Amber Jean.

Young also appeared at that year's [[Live Aid]] concert in [[Philadelphia]], collaborating with Crosby, Stills and Nash for the quartet's first performance for a paying audience in over ten years.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}\n\nYoung's last two albums for Geffen were more conventional in the genre, although they incorporated production techniques like synthesizers and echoing drums that were previously uncommon in Young's music. Young recorded 1986's ''[[Landing on Water]]'' without Crazy Horse but reunited with the band for the subsequent year-long tour and final Geffen album, ''[[Life (1987 album)|Life]]'', which emerged in 1987. Young's album sales dwindled steadily throughout the eighties; today ''Life'' remains his all-time-least successful studio album, with an estimated four hundred thousand sales worldwide.<ref>As of June 2008 {{cite web|title=Neil Young Worldwide Album Sales Estimates|url=http://www.chartsinfrance.net/communaute/index.php?showtopic=6523&st=1365&gopid=969589&#entry969589|date=June 14, 2008|accessdate=April 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nSwitching back to his old label Reprise Records, Young continued to tour relentlessly, assembling a new blues band called The Bluenotes in mid-1987 (a legal dispute with musician [[Harold Melvin]] forced the eventual rechristening of the band as Ten Men Working midway through the tour). The addition of a [[brass instruments|brass]] section provided a new [[jazz]]ier sound, and the title track of 1988's ''[[This Note's For You]]'' became Young's first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video that parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising, and [[Michael Jackson]], the song was initially unofficially banned by MTV for mentioning the brand names of some of their sponsors. Young wrote an open letter, \"What does the M in MTV stand for: music or money?\" Despite this, the video was eventually named [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year|best video of the year]] by the network in 1989.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=24\u201332}} By comparison, the major music cable network of Young's home nation, [[Muchmusic]], ran the video immediately.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}\n\nYoung reunited with Crosby, Stills, and Nash to record the 1988 album ''[[American Dream (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|American Dream]]'' and play two benefit concerts late in the year, but the group did not embark upon a full tour.

The album's lyrics were often overtly political; \"Rockin' in the Free World\" deals with homelessness, terrorism, and environmental degradation, implicitly criticizing the government policies of President [[George H.W. Bush]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Neil Young Lyrics Analysis: Rockin' in the Free World|url=http://www.thrasherswheat.org/fot/ritfw.htm|website=Thrasherswheat.org|accessdate=April 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe use of heavy [[feedback]] and distortion on several ''Freedom'' tracks was reminiscent of the ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (1979) album and foreshadowed the imminent rise of [[grunge]].

The title track was a minor hit and the record was well received by critics, winning the [[Juno Award for Album of the Year]] in 1994. Young also contributed to [[Randy Bachman]]'s nostalgic 1992 tune \"Prairie Town\", and garnered a 1993 [[Academy Award for Best Song|Academy Award]] nomination for his song \"Philadelphia\", from the soundtrack of the [[Jonathan Demme]] movie [[Philadelphia (movie)|of the same name]]. An ''[[Unplugged (Neil Young album)|MTV Unplugged]]'' performance and album emerged in 1993. Later that year, Young collaborated with [[Booker T. and the M.G.s]] for a summer tour of Europe and North America, with [[Blues Traveler]], [[Soundgarden]], and [[Pearl Jam]] also on the bill. Some European shows ended with a rendition of \"Rockin' in the Free World\" played with [[Pearl Jam]], foreshadowing their eventual full-scale collaboration two years later.\n\n[[File:Neil Young, Heart of Gold.jpg|thumb|Young on stage in [[Barcelona]]]]\n\nIn 1994 Young again collaborated with Crazy Horse for ''[[Sleeps with Angels]]'', a record whose dark, somber mood was influenced by [[Kurt Cobain]]'s death earlier that year: the title track in particular dealt with Cobain's life and death, without mentioning him by name.

A Jarmusch-directed concert film and live album of the tour, ''[[Year of the Horse]]'', emerged in 1997. From 1996\u201397 Young and Crazy Horse toured extensively throughout Europe and North America, including a stint as part of the [[H.O.R.D.E.]] Festival's sixth annual tour.\n\nIn 1998, Young renewed his collaboration with the rock band [[Phish]], sharing the stage at the annual [[Farm Aid]] concert and then at Young's Bridge School Benefit, where he joined headliners Phish for renditions of \"[[Helpless (song)|Helpless]]\" and \"[[I Shall Be Released]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperrust.org/Bridge/Bridge12.html|title=Bridge Benefit XII|publisher=Hyperrust|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref> Phish declined Young's later invitation to be his backing band on his 1999 North American tour.\n\nThe decade ended with the release in late 1999 of ''[[Looking Forward]]'', another reunion with Crosby, Stills, and Nash.

While doing errands on a visit to his daughter, Young had seen a newspaper photo of wounded U.S. veterans on a transport plane to Germany, and noticing that the same paper devoted little actual coverage to the story, he was unable to get the image out of his head, realizing the suffering caused to families by the war had not truly registered to him and most Americans who were not directly affected by it. Young cried, and immediately got his guitar out and began to write multiple songs at once. Within a few days he had completed work and assembled a band. He later said he had restrained himself for a long time from writing any [[protest song]]s, waiting for someone younger, with a different perspective, but no one seemed to be saying anything.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}\n\nMost of the album's songs rebuked the Bush administration's policy of war by examining its human costs to soldiers, their loved ones, and civilians, but Young also included a few songs on other themes, and an outright protest titled, \"[[Let's Impeach the President]]\",<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Living With War Review|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/10149965/review/10191400/livingwithwar|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=May 1, 2006|accessdate=March 31, 2009}}</ref> in which he stated that Bush had lied to lead the country into war. Young's lyrics in another song named Illinois Senator [[Barack Obama]], who had not declared any intention to run for president at the time and was widely unexpected to be able to win either the Democratic Party nomination or a general election, as potentially a replacement for Bush. That summer, [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]] reunited for the supporting \"Freedom of Speech Tour '06\", in which they played Young's new protest songs alongside the group's older material, meeting with both enthusiasm and anger from different fans, some of whom were supportive of Bush politically.

They include:\n* 1953 [[Gibson Les Paul]] Goldtop. Nicknamed \"[[Old Black]]\", this is Young's primary electric guitar and is featured on ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (1979) and other albums. Old Black got its name from an amateur paintjob applied to the originally gold body of the instrument, some time before Young acquired the guitar in the late 1960s. In 1972, a mini [[humbucker]] pick-up from a [[Gibson Firebird]] was installed in the lead/treble position. This pick-up, severely [[microphonic]], is considered a crucial component of Young's sound. A [[Bigsby vibrato tailpiece]] was installed as early as 1969, and can be heard during the opening of \"Cowgirl in the Sand\" from ''[[Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere]]''. {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Martin D-45]].

It was one of four instruments bought by Stephen Stills for himself and his bandmates in CSNY to celebrate their first full concert at the Greek Theater in 1969.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* Martin D-28. Nicknamed \"Hank\" after its previous owner, [[Hank Williams]]. [[Hank Williams, Jr.]], had traded it for some shotguns; it went through a succession of other owners until it was located by Young's longtime friend Grant Boatwright. The guitar was purchased by Young from [[Tut Taylor]]. Young has toured with it for over 30 years. A story about the guitar and the song it inspired, \"This Old Guitar\", can be seen about 50 minutes into the film ''[[Neil Young: Heart of Gold]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* Vintage Martin D-18: Young used an old D-18 throughout his early days performing in coffee houses in Canada and on some early [[Buffalo Springfield]] work, before he received the D-45 from Stills.

Before Young bought Old Black, this was his primary electric guitar during his [[Buffalo Springfield]] days.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Gretsch White Falcon]]. Young purchased a late 1950s model near the end of the [[Buffalo Springfield]] era; in 1969 he bought a stereo version of the same vintage guitar from Stephen Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young's early 1970s period, and can be heard on tracks like \"[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]\", \"[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]\", \"Alabama\", \"Words (Between the Lines of Age)\", and \"L.A.\". It was Young's primary electric guitar during the ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (1972) era, since Young's deteriorating back condition (eventually fixed with surgery) made playing the much heavier Les Paul difficult.<ref>David Simons, \"Recording Harvest: The Making of Neil Young's Classic 1972 Album.\" ''Acoustic Guitar'' 103 (July 2001): 38\u201340.</ref> This particular White Falcon is the stereo 6137, in which the signal from the three bass strings is separated from the signal from the three treble strings. Young typically plays this guitar in this stereo mode, sending the separate signals to two different amps, a Fender Deluxe and either a Fender Tremolux or a low-powered Tweed Fender Twin. The separation of the signals is most prominently heard on the ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (1972) song \"Words\".{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Gibson Flying V]], on the ''[[Time Fades Away]]'' tour.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Fender Broadcaster]], on the ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'' (1975) album and tour.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* Guild M-20, seen in the film ''[[Neil Young Journeys]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Harmonicas===\nYoung plays Hohner Marine Band harmonicas and is often seen using a harmonica holder{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hohnerusa.com/index.php?6 |title=Hohner Musikinstrumente GmbH & Co.

The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a most unusual manner: the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometer and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on \"See the Sky About to Rain\". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young by Rick Davis, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. This device is connected to footswitches operable by Young onstage in the manner of an [[effects pedal]]. Tom Wheeler's book Soul of Tone highlights the device on page 182/183.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/musictv/neilyoung/video/randybachman|title=BBC documentary Neil Young: Don't Be Denied \u2013 Randy Bachmann interviews|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=April 23, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n{{Main|Neil Young discography and filmography}}\n{{see also|Crazy Horse (band)#Discography|Buffalo Springfield#Discography|Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young discography}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n*''[[Neil Young (album)|Neil Young]]'' (1968)\n*''[[Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere]]'' {{small|with Crazy Horse}} (1969)\n*''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' (1970)\n*''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (1972)\n*''[[Time Fades Away]]'' {{small|live album}} (1973)\n*''[[On the Beach (Neil Young album)|On the Beach]]'' (1974)\n*''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'' (1975)\n*''[[Zuma (album)|Zuma]]'' {{small|with Crazy Horse}} (1975)\n*''[[Long May You Run]]'' {{small|with Stephen Stills}} (1976)\n*''[[American Stars 'n Bars]]'' (1977)\n*''[[Comes a Time]]'' (1978)\n*''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' {{small|with Crazy Horse}} (1979)\n*''[[Hawks & Doves]]'' (1980)\n*''[[Re\u00b7ac\u00b7tor]]'' {{small|with Crazy Horse}} (1981)\n*''[[Trans (album)|Trans]]'' (1982)\n*''[[Everybody's Rockin']]'' {{small|with the Shocking Pinks}} (1983)\n*''[[Old Ways]]'' (1985)\n*''[[Landing on Water]]'' (1986)\n*''[[Life (Neil Young & Crazy Horse album)|Life]]'' {{small|with Crazy Horse}} (1987)\n*''[[This Note's for You]]'' {{small|with The Bluenotes}} (1989)\n*''[[Freedom (Neil Young album)|Freedom]]'' (1989)'''''\n*''[[Ragged Glory]]'' {{small|with Crazy Horse}} (1990)\n*''[[Harvest Moon (album)|Harvest Moon]]'' (1992)\n*''[[Sleeps with Angels]]'' {{small|with Crazy Horse}} (1994)\n*''[[Mirror Ball (Neil Young album)|Mirror Ball]]'' {{small|with Pearl Jam}} (1995)\n*''[[Broken Arrow (album)|Broken Arrow]]'' {{small|with Crazy Horse}} (1996)\n*''[[Silver & Gold (Neil Young album)|Silver & Gold]]'' (2000)\n*''[[Are You Passionate?]]'' {{small|with Booker T. & the M.G.'s}} (2002)\n*''[[Greendale (album)|Greendale]]'' {{small|with Crazy Horse}} (2003)'''\n*''[[Prairie Wind]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Living with War]]'' (2006)\n*''[[Living with War: \"In the Beginning\"]]'' (2006)\n*''[[Chrome Dreams II]]'' (2007)\n*''[[Fork in the Road]]'' (2009)\n*''[[Le Noise]]'' (2010)\n*''[[Americana (Neil Young & Crazy Horse album)|Americana]]'' {{small|with Crazy Horse}} (2012)\n*''[[Psychedelic Pill]]'' {{small|with Crazy Horse}} (2012)\n*''[[A Letter Home]]'' (2014)\n*''[[Storytone]]'' (2014)\n*''[[The Monsanto Years]]'' {{small|with Promise of the Real}} (2015)\n*''[[Peace Trail (Neil Young album)|Peace Trail]]'' (2016)\n*''[[Hitchhiker (Neil Young album)|Hitchhiker]]'' {{small|recorded 1976}} (2017)\n*''[[The Visitor (Neil Young & Promise of the Real album)|The Visitor]]'' {{small|with Promise of the Real}} (2017)\n*''[[Colorado (Neil Young album)|Colorado]]'' {{small|with Crazy Horse}} (2019)\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Legacy and awards==\n[[File:Neil Young Star cropped.jpg|thumb|Young's Star on [[Canada's Walk of Fame]]]]As one of the original founders of [[Farm Aid]] (1985\u2013), he remains an active member of the board of directors.

Young's involvement stemmed at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have [[cerebral palsy]] and his daughter, like Young himself, has [[epilepsy]].\n\nYoung was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 1994 for his song \"Philadelphia\" from the film ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]''. Bruce Springsteen won the award for his song \"[[Streets of Philadelphia]]\" from the same film. In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that \"the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee's song\". That same night, [[Tom Hanks]], when accepting the Oscar for Best Actor, gave credit for his inspiration to Young's song.\n\nYoung has twice received honorary doctorates. He received an honorary doctorate of music from [[Lakehead University]] in [[Thunder Bay]], Ontario, in 1992, and an honorary doctorate of humane letters from [[San Francisco State University]] in 2006. The latter honour was shared with his wife Pegi for their creation of the Bridge School. In 2006, Young was given Manitoba's highest civilian honour when he was appointed to the [[Order of Manitoba]]. In 2009, he was appointed to Canada's second highest civilian order, the [[Order of Canada]].\n\n''Rolling Stone'' magazine in 2000, ranked Young thirty-fourth in its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time,<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/neil-young-19691231|title=100 Greatest Artists of All Time|journal=Rolling Stone|accessdate=January 27, 2011}}</ref> and in 2003, included five of his albums in its list of [[500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time/|title=Greatest Albums of All Time &#124; Rolling Stone Music &#124; Lists|magazine=Rollingstone.com|accessdate=June 30, 2010}}</ref> In 2000, Young was inducted into [[Canada's Walk of Fame]].<ref name=\"cwof\">{{cite web|url=http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductees/00_neil_young.xml.htm|title=Neil Young \u2013 2000 Inductee|publisher=Canada's Walk of Fame|accessdate=November 13, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604203513/http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductees/00_neil_young.xml.htm|archivedate=June 4, 2008}}</ref>\nIn 2006, when ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine compiled a \"Greatest Living Songwriters\" list, Young was ranked second behind [[Bob Dylan]]. (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together or played on each other's records.) He ranked thirty-ninth on ''[[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock'' that same year. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame explained that while Young has \"avoided sticking to one style for very long, the unifying factors throughout Young's peripatetic musical journey have been his unmistakable voice, his raw and expressive guitar playing, and his consummate songwriting skill.\"<ref name=\"rockhall.com\"/>\n\nYoung's political outspokenness and social awareness influenced artists such as [[Blind Melon]], [[Phish]], [[Pearl Jam]], and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. Young is referred to as \"the Godfather of [[Grunge]]\" because of the influence he had on [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Eddie Vedder]] and the entire grunge movement. Vedder inducted Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. Young is cited as being a significant influence on the [[experimental rock]] group [[Sonic Youth]], and [[Thom Yorke]] of [[Radiohead]]. Yorke recounted of first hearing Young after sending a demo tape into a magazine when he was 16, who favourably compared his singing voice to Young's. Unaware of Young at that time, he bought ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' (1970), and \"immediately fell in love\" with his work, calling it \"extraordinary\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/musictv/neilyoung/video/thomyorke/|title=BBC - Neil Young: Don't be denied. - Video - Thom Yorke|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Yorke later covered the title track in concert. [[Dave Matthews]] lists Young as one of his favourite songwriters and most important inspirations and covers his songs on occasion. The British indie band [[The Bluetones]] named their number one [[Expecting to Fly (album)|debut album]] after the song \"[[Expecting to Fly (song)|Expecting to Fly]]\" (written by Young when still with Buffalo Springfield) and have covered the song while touring. Young also inspired the singer-songwriter [[Noel Gallagher]] of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], who covered \"[[Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)]]\" on the live album ''[[Familiar to Millions]]'' (2000).\n\nThe Australian rock group [[Powderfinger]] named themselves after Young's song \"[[Powderfinger (song)|Powderfinger]]\" from ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (1979). The members of the [[Constantines]] have occasionally played Neil Young tribute shows under the name Horsey Craze.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jason Crock |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/31309-interview-the-constantines |title=Interviews: The Constantines |date=October 16, 2005 |website=Pitchfork.com |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105084641/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/31309-interview-the-constantines |archive-date=January 5, 2009}}</ref> While in Winnipeg on November 2, 2008, during the Canadian leg of his tour, Bob Dylan visited Young's former home in River Heights, where Young spent his teenage years.

Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group \u2013 winners of the 1969 \"Best New Artist\" [[Grammy Award]] \u2013 was renamed [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]].{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=313}} The quartet debuted in Chicago on August 16, 1969, and later performed at the famous [[Woodstock Festival]], during which Young skipped the majority of the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: \"One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar\".{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=318\u2013320}} During the making of their first album, ''[[D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|D\u00e9j\u00e0 Vu]]'' (March 11, 1970), the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. Stills continued throughout their lifelong relationship to criticize Young, saying that he \"wanted to play folk music in a rock band.\"{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=324}} Despite the tension, Young's tenure with CSN&Y coincided with the band's most creative and successful period, and greatly contributed to his subsequent success as a solo artist.\n\nYoung wrote \"[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]\" following the [[Kent State massacre]] on May 4, 1970. The song was quickly recorded by CSN&Y and immediately released as a single, even though CSN&Y's \"Teach Your Children\" was still climbing the singles charts.\n\n===''After the Gold Rush'', acoustic tour and ''Harvest'' (1970\u20131972)===\nLater in the year, Young released his third solo album, ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' (August 31, 1970), which featured, among others, [[Nils Lofgren]], [[Stephen Stills]], and CSNY bassist [[Greg Reeves]]. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. The eventual recording was less amplified than ''Everybody Knows This is Nowhere'', with a wider range of sounds. Young's newfound fame with CSNY made the album his commercial breakthrough as a solo artist, and it contains some of his best known work, including \"[[Tell Me Why (Neil Young song)|Tell Me Why]]\" and \"[[Don't Let It Bring You Down]]\", the country-influenced singles \"[[Only Love Can Break Your Heart]]\" and \"[[When You Dance I Can Really Love]]\", and the title track, \"[[After the Gold Rush (song)|After the Gold Rush]]\", played on piano, with dream-like lyrics that ran a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to [[environmentalism|environmental concerns]]. Young's bitter condemnation of racism in the heavy blues-rock song \"[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]\" (along with a later song entitled \"Alabama\") was also controversial with southerners in an era of desegregation, prompting [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] to decry Young by name in the lyrics to their hit \"[[Sweet Home Alabama (song)|Sweet Home Alabama]].\" However, Young said he was a fan of Skynyrd's music, and the band's front man [[Ronnie Van Zant]] was later photographed wearing a ''Tonight's the Night'' T-shirt [[Street Survivors|on the cover of an album]].\n\n[[File:Neil Young-early promo.jpg|thumb|Young in the 1970s]]\nIn the autumn of 1970, Young began a solo acoustic tour of North America, during which he played a variety of his Buffalo Springfield and CSNY songs on guitar and piano, along with material from his solo albums and a number of new songs. Some songs premiered by Young on the tour, like \"Journey through the Past\", would never find a home on a studio album, while other songs, like \"See the Sky About to Rain\", would only be released in coming years. With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young's tour, now entitled \"Journey Through the Past\", continued into early 1971, and its focus shifted more to newer songs he had been writing; he famously remarked that having written so many, he could not think of anything to do but play them. Many gigs were sold out, including concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]] and a pair of acclaimed hometown shows at Toronto's [[Massey Hall]], which were taped for a planned live album. The shows became legendary among Young fans, and the recordings were officially released nearly 40 years later as an official bootleg in Young's Archive series.\n\nNear the end of his tour, Young performed one of the new acoustic songs on the ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|Johnny Cash]]'' TV show. \"[[The Needle and the Damage Done]]\", a somber lament on the pain caused by [[heroin addiction]], had been inspired in part by Crazy Horse member [[Danny Whitten]], who eventually died while battling his drug problems.{{sfn|Williamson|2002|p=42}}{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=279}} While in Nashville for the Cash taping, Young accepted the invitation of [[Quadrafonic Sound Studios]] owner [[Elliot Mazer]] to record tracks there with a group of country-music session musicians who were pulled together at the last minute. Making a connection with them, he christened them [[The Stray Gators]], and began playing with them. Befitting the immediacy of the project, [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[James Taylor]] were brought in from the Cash taping to do background vocals. Against the advice of his producer [[David Briggs (producer)|David Briggs]], he scrapped plans for the imminent release<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bad-news-beat.org/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1889 |title=Neil comments on massey hall release :: Bad News Beat :: on Neil Young |website=Bad-news-beat.org |accessdate=July 11, 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010740/http://www.bad-news-beat.org/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1889 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}</ref> of the live acoustic recording in favour of a studio album consisting of the Nashville sessions, electric-guitar oriented sessions recorded later in his barn, and two recordings made with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at Barking (credited as Barking Town Hall and now the [[The Broadway (theatre)|Broadway Theatre]]) during March 1971.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.longlivevinyl.net/classic-album-neil-young-harvest/ |title=Classic Album: Neil Young - Harvest|date=June 2, 2017 |work=Long Live Vinyl |access-date=October 10, 2017 |language=en-GB}}</ref> The result was Young's fourth album, ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (February 14, 1972). The only remnant left of the original live concept was the album's live acoustic performance of \"Needle and the Damage Done.\"\n\nAfter his success with CSNY, Young purchased a ranch in the rural hills above Woodside and Redwood City in Northern California (\"Broken Arrow Ranch\", where he lived until his divorce in 2014.<ref name=\"rollingstone.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/inside-neil-youngs-nature-themed-opus-20160705|title=Inside Neil Young's Nature-Themed Opus|website=Rollingstone.com|accessdate=July 11, 2017}}</ref>). He wrote the song \"[[Old Man (song)|Old Man]]\" in honor of the land's longtime caretaker, Louis Avila. The song \"[[A Man Needs a Maid (song)|A Man Needs a Maid]]\" was inspired by his relationship with actress [[Carrie Snodgress]]. \"[[Heart of Gold (Neil Young song)|Heart of Gold]]\" was released as the first single from ''Harvest'', the only No.&nbsp;1 hit in his career. \"Old Man\" was also popular.\n\nThe album's recording had been almost accidental. Its mainstream success caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the ''[[Decade (Neil Young album)|Decade]]'' (1977) compilation, Young chose to include his greatest hits from the period, but his handwritten liner notes famously described \"Heart of Gold\" as the song that \"put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there.\"\n\n===The \"Ditch\" Trilogy and personal struggles (1972\u20131974)===\nAlthough a new tour with The Stray Gators (now augmented by Danny Whitten) had been planned to follow up on the success of ''Harvest'', it became apparent during rehearsals that Whitten could not function due to drug abuse. On November 18, 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an apparent [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]/[[diazepam]] overdose. Young described the incident to ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s [[Cameron Crowe]] in 1975:<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/profile/story/9102786/neil_young_the_rs_interview|title=Neil Young: The RS Interview|magazine=Rollingstone.com|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}</ref> \"[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd OD'd. That blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and ... insecure.\"\n\nOn the tour, Young struggled with his voice and the performance of drummer [[Kenny Buttrey]], a noted Nashville session musician who was unaccustomed to performing in the [[hard rock]] milieu; Buttrey was eventually replaced by former CSNY drummer [[Johnny Barbata]], while [[David Crosby]] and [[Graham Nash]] contributed rhythm guitar and backing vocals to the final dates of the tour. The album assembled in the aftermath of this incident, ''[[Time Fades Away]]'' (October 15, 1973), has often been described by Young as \"[his] least favorite record\", and was not officially released on CD until 2017 (as part of Young's [[Neil Young Archives#Official Release Series 05:|Official Release Series]]). Nevertheless, Young and his band tried several new musical approaches in this period. ''Time Fades Away'', for instance, was recorded live, although it was an album of new material, an approach Young would repeat with more success later on. ''Time'' was the first of three consecutive commercial failures which would later become known collectively to fans as the \"Ditch Trilogy\", as contrasted with the more middle-of-the-road pop of ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (1972).<ref name=\"UnCut\">{{cite news|last=Pinnock|first=Tom|title=Neil Young's 'Time Fades Away': 'Harvest's unlikely follow-up|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/neil-young/neil-young-s-time-fades-away-harvests-unlikely-follow-up-feature|accessdate=January 3, 2014|newspaper=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=May 2010|issue=156}}</ref> These subsequent albums were seen as more challenging expressions of Young's inner conflicts on achieving success, expressing both the specific struggles of his friends and himself, and the decaying idealism of his generation in America at the time.\n\n[[File:Neil Young in Austin, 1976.jpg|thumb|Young in [[Austin, Texas]], on November 9, 1976]]\n\nIn the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by [[Nils Lofgren]] on guitar and piano and ''Harvest''/''Time Fades Away'' veteran [[Ben Keith]] on pedal steel guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and [[roadie]] [[Bruce Berry]], Young recorded an album specifically inspired by the incidents, ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'' (June 20, 1975). The album's dark tone and rawness led Reprise to delay its release and Young had to pressure them for two years before they would do so.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=430}} While his record company was stalling, Young recorded another album, ''[[On the Beach (Neil Young album)|On the Beach]]'' (July 16, 1974), which presented a more melodic, acoustic sound at times, including a recording of the older song \"See the Sky About to Rain\", but dealt with similarly dark themes such as the collapse of 1960s folk ideals, the downside of success and the underbelly of the Californian lifestyle. Like ''Time Fades Away'', it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favorite, presenting some of Young's most original work. A review of the 2003 re-release on CD of ''On the Beach'' described the music as \"mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary\".<ref name=\"sven\">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.com/a&e/soundfury904.htm |title=Neil Young \u2013 On the Beach (Reprise) |newspaper=The Santa Barbara Independent |date=March 18, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040421143346/http://www.independent.com/a%26e/soundfury904.htm |archivedate=April 21, 2004 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter completing ''On the Beach'', Young reunited with ''Harvest'' producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album, ''[[Homegrown (Neil Young album)|Homegrown]]''. Most of the songs were written after Young's break-up with Carrie Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though ''Homegrown'' was reportedly entirely complete, Young decided, not for the first or last time in his career, to drop it and release something else instead, in this case, ''Tonight's the Night'', at the suggestion of [[The Band|Band]] bassist [[Rick Danko]].{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=469}} Young further explained his move by saying: \"It was a little too personal ... it scared me\".{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=469}} Most of the songs from ''Homegrown'' were later incorporated into other Young albums, but the original album never surfaced. ''Tonight's the Night'' when finally released in 1975, sold poorly, as had the previous albums of the \"ditch\" trilogy, and received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album. In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=433}}\n\n===Reunions, retrospectives and ''Rust Never Sleeps'' (1974\u20131979)===\nYoung reunited with [[Crosby, Stills, and Nash]] after a four-year hiatus in the summer of 1974 for a concert tour which was recorded and released in 2014 as [[CSNY 1974]]. It was one of the first ever stadium tours, and the largest tour in which Young has participated to date.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=452}}\n\nIn 1975, Young reformed Crazy Horse with [[Frank Sampedro]] on guitar as his backup band for his eighth album, ''[[Zuma (album)|Zuma]]'' (November 10, 1975). Many of the songs dealt with the theme of failed relationships; \"[[Cortez the Killer]]\", a retelling of the [[Spanish conquest]] of Mexico from the viewpoint of the [[Aztec]]s, may also be heard as an allegory of love lost. ''Zuma''{{'}}s closing track, \"Through My Sails\", was the only released fragment from aborted sessions with Crosby, Stills and Nash for another group album.\n\nIn 1976, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album ''[[Long May You Run]]'' (September 20, 1976), credited to [[The Stills-Young Band]]; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a [[telegram]] that read: \"Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way.

Performers on the record included [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Emmylou Harris]] and Young prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Nicolette Larson]] along with Crazy Horse. In 1977, Young also released the compilation ''[[Decade (Neil Young album)|Decade]]'', a personally selected set of songs spanning every aspect of his work, including a handful of previously unreleased songs. The record included less commercial album tracks alongside radio hits.\n\n''[[Comes a Time]]'' (October 2, 1978), Young's first entirely new solo recording since the mid-1970s, also featured Larson and Crazy Horse.  The album became Young's most commercially accessible album in quite some time and marked a return to his folk roots, including a cover of [[Ian Tyson]]'s \"[[Four Strong Winds]]\", a song Young associated with his childhood in Canada.  Another of the album's songs, \"[[Lotta Love]]\", was also recorded by Larson, with her version reaching number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1979.  In 1978, much of the filming was done for Young's film ''[[Human Highway]]'', which took its name from a song featured on ''Comes a Time''. Over four years, Young would spend [[United States dollar|$]]3,000,000 of his own money on production (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3000000|1978}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). This also marked the beginning of his brief collaboration with the post-punk band [[Devo]], whose members appeared in the film.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=575\u2013577}}\n\nYoung set out in 1978 on the lengthy \"Rust Never Sleeps\" tour, in which he played a wealth of new material. Each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. The electric sets, featuring an abrasive style of playing, were influenced by the punk rock [[zeitgeist]] of the late 1970s and, provided a stark contrast from Young's previous, folk-inspired album ''Comes a Time''.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=529\u2013537}} Two new songs, the acoustic \"[[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)]]\" and electric \"[[Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)]]\" were the centerpiece of the new material. Young had collaborated with the [[art punk]] band [[Devo]] on a cacophonous version of Hey Hey, My My at the [[Different Fur]] studio in San Francisco and, would later introduce the song to Crazy Horse.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531\u2013532}} The lyrics, \"It's better to burn out than to fade away.\" were widely quoted by his peers and by critics.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531\u2013532}} The album has also widely been considered a precursor of grunge music and many grunge artists have said they were inspired by Young's distorted guitars on the B side to this album. Young also compared the rise of [[Johnny Rotten]] with that of the recently deceased \"King\" [[Elvis Presley]], who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an [[Pop icon|icon]]. Rotten returned the favour by playing one of Young's songs, \"Revolution Blues\" from ''[[On the Beach (Neil Young album)|On the Beach]]'', on a London radio show, an early sign of Young's eventual embrace by a number of punk-influenced alternative musicians.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schneider|first1=Martin|title=DJ Johnny Rotten plays music from his own record collection on the radio, 1977|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/dj_johnny_rotten_plays_music_from_his_own_record_collection_on_the_radio_19|website=Dangerousminds.net|accessdate=April 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\nYoung's two accompanying albums ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (July 2, 1979; new material, culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and ''[[Live Rust]]'' (November 19, 1979) (a mixture of old and new, and a genuine concert recording) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B.  A movie version of the concerts, also called ''Rust Never Sleeps'' (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym \"Bernard Shakey\". Young worked with rock artist [[Jim Evans (artist)|Jim Evans]] to create the poster art for the film, using the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Jawas]] as a theme. Young's work since ''Harvest'' (1972) had alternated between being rejected by mass audiences and being seen as backward-looking by critics, sometimes both at once, and now he was suddenly viewed as relevant by a new generation, who began to discover his earlier work. Readers and critics of ''Rolling Stone'' voted him Artist of the Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' as Album of the Year, and voted him Male Vocalist of the Year as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/rolling.htm#1979 |title=Albums Of The Year And End Of Year Critic Lists |publisher=Rocklist.net |accessdate=5 February 2020 }}</ref> ''[[The Village Voice]]'' named ''Rust Never Sleeps'' as the year's winner in the [[Pazz & Jop]] Poll, a survey of nationwide critics, and honored Young as the Artist of the Decade.

''Trans'' (1982) had already drawn the ire of label head [[David Geffen]] for its lack of commercial appeal, and with ''Everybody's Rockin''{{'}} following only seven months later, Geffen Records sued Young for making music \"unrepresentative\" of himself.<ref>{{cite book|title=A fiction of the past: the sixties in American history|last=Cavallo|first=Dominick|year=1999|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-21930-7|oclc=39981636|url=https://archive.org/details/fictionofpastsix00cava}}</ref> The album was also notable as the first for which Young made commercial music videos \u2013 [[Tim Pope]] directed the videos for \"Wonderin'\" and \"Cry, Cry, Cry\".

Young's lack of productivity was largely due to the ongoing legal battle with Geffen, although he was also frustrated that the label had rejected his 1982 country album ''[[Old Ways]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r22521|pure_url=yes}}|title=Old Ways album review|website=allmusic|accessdate=April 7, 2009}}</ref> It was also the year when Young's third child was born, a girl named Amber Jean.

Young recorded 1986's ''[[Landing on Water]]'' without Crazy Horse but reunited with the band for the subsequent year-long tour and final Geffen album, ''[[Life (1987 album)|Life]]'', which emerged in 1987.

The addition of a [[brass instruments|brass]] section provided a new [[jazz]]ier sound, and the title track of 1988's ''[[This Note's For You]]'' became Young's first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video that parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising, and [[Michael Jackson]], the song was initially unofficially banned by MTV for mentioning the brand names of some of their sponsors. Young wrote an open letter, \"What does the M in MTV stand for: music or money?\" Despite this, the video was eventually named [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year|best video of the year]] by the network in 1989.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=24\u201332}} By comparison, the major music cable network of Young's home nation, [[Muchmusic]], ran the video immediately.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}\n\nYoung reunited with Crosby, Stills, and Nash to record the 1988 album ''[[American Dream (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|American Dream]]'' and play two benefit concerts late in the year, but the group did not embark upon a full tour.

Bush]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Neil Young Lyrics Analysis: Rockin' in the Free World|url=http://www.thrasherswheat.org/fot/ritfw.htm|website=Thrasherswheat.org|accessdate=April 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe use of heavy [[feedback]] and distortion on several ''Freedom'' tracks was reminiscent of the ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (1979) album and foreshadowed the imminent rise of [[grunge]]. The rising stars of the genre, including [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Pearl Jam]]'s [[Eddie Vedder]], frequently cited Young as a major influence, contributing to his popular revival. A tribute album called ''[[The Bridge: A Tribute to Neil Young]]'' was released in 1989, featuring covers by alternative and grunge acts including [[Sonic Youth]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Soul Asylum]], [[Dinosaur Jr]], and the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]].\n\nYoung's 1990 album ''[[Ragged Glory]]'', recorded with Crazy Horse in a barn on his [[Northern California]] ranch, continued this distortion-heavy esthetic. Young toured for the album with Orange County, California country-punk band [[Social Distortion]] and [[alternative rock]] pioneers [[Sonic Youth]] as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans.<ref name=\"sonic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thrasherswheat.org/jammin/sonic_youth.htm|title=Sonic Youth and Neil Young|publisher=Thrasher's Wheat \u2013 A Neil Young Archives|accessdate=April 1, 2009}}</ref> ''[[Weld (album)|Weld]]'', a two-disc live album documenting the tour, was released in 1991.<ref name=\"sonic\" /> Sonic Youth's influence was most evident on ''[[Arc (Neil Young & Crazy Horse album)|Arc]]'', a 35-minute collage of feedback and distortion spliced together at the suggestion of Sonic Youth's [[Thurston Moore]] and originally packaged with some versions of ''Weld''.<ref name=\"sonic\" />\n\n1992's ''[[Harvest Moon (album)|Harvest Moon]]'' marked an abrupt return to the country and folk-rock stylings of ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (1972) and reunited him with some of the musicians from that album, including singers [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[James Taylor]]. The title track was a minor hit and the record was well received by critics, winning the [[Juno Award for Album of the Year]] in 1994. Young also contributed to [[Randy Bachman]]'s nostalgic 1992 tune \"Prairie Town\", and garnered a 1993 [[Academy Award for Best Song|Academy Award]] nomination for his song \"Philadelphia\", from the soundtrack of the [[Jonathan Demme]] movie [[Philadelphia (movie)|of the same name]]. An ''[[Unplugged (Neil Young album)|MTV Unplugged]]'' performance and album emerged in 1993. Later that year, Young collaborated with [[Booker T. and the M.G.s]] for a summer tour of Europe and North America, with [[Blues Traveler]], [[Soundgarden]], and [[Pearl Jam]] also on the bill. Some European shows ended with a rendition of \"Rockin' in the Free World\" played with [[Pearl Jam]], foreshadowing their eventual full-scale collaboration two years later.\n\n[[File:Neil Young, Heart of Gold.jpg|thumb|Young on stage in [[Barcelona]]]]\n\nIn 1994 Young again collaborated with Crazy Horse for ''[[Sleeps with Angels]]'', a record whose dark, somber mood was influenced by [[Kurt Cobain]]'s death earlier that year: the title track in particular dealt with Cobain's life and death, without mentioning him by name. Cobain had quoted Young's lyric \"It's better to burn out than fade away\" (a line from \"[[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)|My My, Hey Hey]]\") in [[Death of Kurt Cobain#Suicide note|his suicide note]].

A Jarmusch-directed concert film and live album of the tour, ''[[Year of the Horse]]'', emerged in 1997.

While doing errands on a visit to his daughter, Young had seen a newspaper photo of wounded U.S. veterans on a transport plane to Germany, and noticing that the same paper devoted little actual coverage to the story, he was unable to get the image out of his head, realizing the suffering caused to families by the war had not truly registered to him and most Americans who were not directly affected by it. Young cried, and immediately got his guitar out and began to write multiple songs at once. Within a few days he had completed work and assembled a band. He later said he had restrained himself for a long time from writing any [[protest song]]s, waiting for someone younger, with a different perspective, but no one seemed to be saying anything.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}\n\nMost of the album's songs rebuked the Bush administration's policy of war by examining its human costs to soldiers, their loved ones, and civilians, but Young also included a few songs on other themes, and an outright protest titled, \"[[Let's Impeach the President]]\",<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Living With War Review|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/10149965/review/10191400/livingwithwar|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=May 1, 2006|accessdate=March 31, 2009}}</ref> in which he stated that Bush had lied to lead the country into war. Young's lyrics in another song named Illinois Senator [[Barack Obama]], who had not declared any intention to run for president at the time and was widely unexpected to be able to win either the Democratic Party nomination or a general election, as potentially a replacement for Bush. That summer, [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]] reunited for the supporting \"Freedom of Speech Tour '06\", in which they played Young's new protest songs alongside the group's older material, meeting with both enthusiasm and anger from different fans, some of whom were supportive of Bush politically.

They include:\n* 1953 [[Gibson Les Paul]] Goldtop. Nicknamed \"[[Old Black]]\", this is Young's primary electric guitar and is featured on ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (1979) and other albums. Old Black got its name from an amateur paintjob applied to the originally gold body of the instrument, some time before Young acquired the guitar in the late 1960s. In 1972, a mini [[humbucker]] pick-up from a [[Gibson Firebird]] was installed in the lead/treble position. This pick-up, severely [[microphonic]], is considered a crucial component of Young's sound. A [[Bigsby vibrato tailpiece]] was installed as early as 1969, and can be heard during the opening of \"Cowgirl in the Sand\" from ''[[Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere]]''. {{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Martin D-45]].

It was one of four instruments bought by Stephen Stills for himself and his bandmates in CSNY to celebrate their first full concert at the Greek Theater in 1969.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* Martin D-28. Nicknamed \"Hank\" after its previous owner, [[Hank Williams]]. [[Hank Williams, Jr.]], had traded it for some shotguns; it went through a succession of other owners until it was located by Young's longtime friend Grant Boatwright. The guitar was purchased by Young from [[Tut Taylor]]. Young has toured with it for over 30 years. A story about the guitar and the song it inspired, \"This Old Guitar\", can be seen about 50 minutes into the film ''[[Neil Young: Heart of Gold]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* Vintage Martin D-18: Young used an old D-18 throughout his early days performing in coffee houses in Canada and on some early [[Buffalo Springfield]] work, before he received the D-45 from Stills.

Before Young bought Old Black, this was his primary electric guitar during his [[Buffalo Springfield]] days.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Gretsch White Falcon]]. Young purchased a late 1950s model near the end of the [[Buffalo Springfield]] era; in 1969 he bought a stereo version of the same vintage guitar from Stephen Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young's early 1970s period, and can be heard on tracks like \"[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]\", \"[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]\", \"Alabama\", \"Words (Between the Lines of Age)\", and \"L.A.\". It was Young's primary electric guitar during the ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (1972) era, since Young's deteriorating back condition (eventually fixed with surgery) made playing the much heavier Les Paul difficult.<ref>David Simons, \"Recording Harvest: The Making of Neil Young's Classic 1972 Album.\" ''Acoustic Guitar'' 103 (July 2001): 38\u201340.</ref> This particular White Falcon is the stereo 6137, in which the signal from the three bass strings is separated from the signal from the three treble strings. Young typically plays this guitar in this stereo mode, sending the separate signals to two different amps, a Fender Deluxe and either a Fender Tremolux or a low-powered Tweed Fender Twin. The separation of the signals is most prominently heard on the ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (1972) song \"Words\".{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Gibson Flying V]], on the ''[[Time Fades Away]]'' tour.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* [[Fender Broadcaster]], on the ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'' (1975) album and tour.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n* Guild M-20, seen in the film ''[[Neil Young Journeys]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Harmonicas===\nYoung plays Hohner Marine Band harmonicas and is often seen using a harmonica holder{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hohnerusa.com/index.php?6 |title=Hohner Musikinstrumente GmbH & Co.

The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a most unusual manner: the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometer and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on \"See the Sky About to Rain\". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young by Rick Davis, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations.

For one weekend each October, in [[Mountain View, California]], Young and his ex-wife have hosted the [[Bridge School Benefit|Bridge School Concerts]], which have been drawing international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades with some of the biggest names in rock having performed at the event including [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[David Bowie]], [[The Who]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Trent Reznor]] of [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Thom Yorke]] of [[Radiohead]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Foo Fighters]], [[Metallica]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Paul McCartney]] and [[Dave Matthews]]. He announced in June 2017, however, that he would no longer host the concerts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bridgeschool.org/2017/06/no-bridge-school-benefit-concert-in-2017/|title=No Bridge School Benefit Concert in 2017|date=June 21, 2017|accessdate=July 9, 2017}}</ref>  The concerts are a benefit for the Bridge School, which develops and uses advanced technologies to aid in the instruction of children with disabilities. Young's involvement stemmed at least partially from the fact that both of his sons have [[cerebral palsy]] and his daughter, like Young himself, has [[epilepsy]].\n\nYoung was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 1994 for his song \"Philadelphia\" from the film ''[[Philadelphia (film)|Philadelphia]]''. Bruce Springsteen won the award for his song \"[[Streets of Philadelphia]]\" from the same film. In his acceptance speech, Springsteen said that \"the award really deserved to be shared by the other nominee's song\". That same night, [[Tom Hanks]], when accepting the Oscar for Best Actor, gave credit for his inspiration to Young's song.\n\nYoung has twice received honorary doctorates. He received an honorary doctorate of music from [[Lakehead University]] in [[Thunder Bay]], Ontario, in 1992, and an honorary doctorate of humane letters from [[San Francisco State University]] in 2006. The latter honour was shared with his wife Pegi for their creation of the Bridge School. In 2006, Young was given Manitoba's highest civilian honour when he was appointed to the [[Order of Manitoba]]. In 2009, he was appointed to Canada's second highest civilian order, the [[Order of Canada]].\n\n''Rolling Stone'' magazine in 2000, ranked Young thirty-fourth in its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time,<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/neil-young-19691231|title=100 Greatest Artists of All Time|journal=Rolling Stone|accessdate=January 27, 2011}}</ref> and in 2003, included five of his albums in its list of [[500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time/|title=Greatest Albums of All Time &#124; Rolling Stone Music &#124; Lists|magazine=Rollingstone.com|accessdate=June 30, 2010}}</ref> In 2000, Young was inducted into [[Canada's Walk of Fame]].<ref name=\"cwof\">{{cite web|url=http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductees/00_neil_young.xml.htm|title=Neil Young \u2013 2000 Inductee|publisher=Canada's Walk of Fame|accessdate=November 13, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604203513/http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductees/00_neil_young.xml.htm|archivedate=June 4, 2008}}</ref>\nIn 2006, when ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine compiled a \"Greatest Living Songwriters\" list, Young was ranked second behind [[Bob Dylan]]. (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together or played on each other's records.) He ranked thirty-ninth on ''[[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock'' that same year. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame explained that while Young has \"avoided sticking to one style for very long, the unifying factors throughout Young's peripatetic musical journey have been his unmistakable voice, his raw and expressive guitar playing, and his consummate songwriting skill.\"<ref name=\"rockhall.com\"/>\n\nYoung's political outspokenness and social awareness influenced artists such as [[Blind Melon]], [[Phish]], [[Pearl Jam]], and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. Young is referred to as \"the Godfather of [[Grunge]]\" because of the influence he had on [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Eddie Vedder]] and the entire grunge movement. Vedder inducted Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. Young is cited as being a significant influence on the [[experimental rock]] group [[Sonic Youth]], and [[Thom Yorke]] of [[Radiohead]]. Yorke recounted of first hearing Young after sending a demo tape into a magazine when he was 16, who favourably compared his singing voice to Young's. Unaware of Young at that time, he bought ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' (1970), and \"immediately fell in love\" with his work, calling it \"extraordinary\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/musictv/neilyoung/video/thomyorke/|title=BBC - Neil Young: Don't be denied. - Video - Thom Yorke|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Yorke later covered the title track in concert. [[Dave Matthews]] lists Young as one of his favourite songwriters and most important inspirations and covers his songs on occasion. The British indie band [[The Bluetones]] named their number one [[Expecting to Fly (album)|debut album]] after the song \"[[Expecting to Fly (song)|Expecting to Fly]]\" (written by Young when still with Buffalo Springfield) and have covered the song while touring. Young also inspired the singer-songwriter [[Noel Gallagher]] of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], who covered \"[[Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)]]\" on the live album ''[[Familiar to Millions]]'' (2000).\n\nThe Australian rock group [[Powderfinger]] named themselves after Young's song \"[[Powderfinger (song)|Powderfinger]]\" from ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (1979). The members of the [[Constantines]] have occasionally played Neil Young tribute shows under the name Horsey Craze.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jason Crock |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/31309-interview-the-constantines |title=Interviews: The Constantines |date=October 16, 2005 |website=Pitchfork.com |accessdate=June 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105084641/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/31309-interview-the-constantines |archive-date=January 5, 2009}}</ref> While in Winnipeg on November 2, 2008, during the Canadian leg of his tour, Bob Dylan visited Young's former home in River Heights, where Young spent his teenage years.

Construction began in 1784; its completion was delayed by conflicts with area [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and the house was completed in 1796. It is listed with the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and is open to the public. It is one of the Tennessee Historical Commission's State-Owned Historic Sites and is operated by the Friends of Rock Castle in partnership with the [[Tennessee Historical Commission]].\n\n==Daniel Smith==\n[[File:Daniel Smith Surveyor.jpg|thumbnail|left|Picture of Daniel Smith Donelson, Daniel Smith's grandson]]\nDaniel Smith served as a captain in [[Lord Dunmore's War]], a colonel in the [[American Revolution]], and a Brigadier General of the militia in the Metro District. He was a member of the committee to frame the [[U.S. Bill of Rights]], a Territorial Secretary of State, and a [[U.S. Senator]]. He also surveyed land boundaries in [[Middle Tennessee]].\n\nDaniel Smith was born in Stafford County, [[Virginia]] in 1748 as a twin.<ref>Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the 105th Congress, Second Session, Vol. 144 (October 15, 1998.)</ref> He was baptized in Elbo Warren Baptist Church October 24, which was five days before his twin sister, Sarah, died.<ref>Bill Glidden, in Funeral of Daniel Smith: Historic Rock Castle, Hendersonville, TN. (Hendersonvill: Historic Productions, 2011)</ref> Smith lived in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] before he moved into the home of Dr. Thomas Walker. At Walker's, Smith studied medicine and surveying. Dr. Walker was famous for being the legal guardian of [[Thomas Jefferson]]. While they were not close in age, Jefferson and Smith did know each other, but Congressional records prove that they met. In these records, Jefferson praises Smith \"For intelligence, well-cultivated talents, integrity, and usefulness, in soundness of judgment in the practice of virtue and in shunning violence unequaled by few men, and in the purity of excelled by none.\" <ref>Thomas Jefferson, quoted in Bill Frist, U.S. Senator, Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the 105th Congress, Second Session, Vol. 144 (October 15, 1998.)</ref> Later, Smith studied at the [[College of William and Mary]], Jefferson's alma matter.<ref>Congressional Record.</ref>[[File:Picture of Gravestone Marker.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Grave Marker of Daniel Smith]]\n\nSmith served in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He was a Captain and was appointed a Justice of the Peace by [[Patrick Henry]]. He was promoted to Major of the [[Washington County, Tennessee]] Militia. In 1778, Daniel Smith was appointed commissioner to locate roads. In 1779, along with Dr. Walker, he was appointed to extend the line between Virginia and [[North Carolina]].<ref name=\"Berry\">Sarah Crosby Berry. \"Application for the Membership to the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution: Washington D.C.\" (1911) Historic Rock Castle Collection, Hendersonville, Tennessee.</ref> This later became the divisional lines of [[Kentucky]] and Tennessee. Afterward, in April 1778, Major Smith was recommended to become the Sheriff of Washington County. He was appointed Commissioner of Tax in the same year. Later that same year, Smith was appointed Examiner of the Bills of Credit.<ref name=\"Berry\"/> President [[George Washington]] appointed Smith as Secretary of the Territory South of the Ohio, [[Southwest Territory]] in 1790.<ref name=\"bioguide\">\"Smith, Daniel, (1748-1818)\", \"Biographical Directory of the United States Congress: 1774-Present.\" United States Congress. Bioguide.congress.gov. (accessed April 25, 2013).</ref>\n\nLater Smith became Indian negotiator, where he negotiated most of the treaties with the [[Cherokee]] Indians in Tennessee. Smith, as mapmaker, created maps of Tennessee and Kentucky. He is the man that named the state \"Tennasee\" or \"Tanasi\", pronounced \\ten-'ah-see\\. The name was chosen for a Cherokee settlement in the eastern part of the state. Smith drafted the State Constitution of Tennessee and was one of the men who drafted a constitution for the [[Continental Congress]] in 1796.<ref name=\"bioguide\"/> While his draft was not chosen as the Federal Constitution, his work was chosen for the State of Tennessee. Smith became one of the earliest [[United States Senate|Senators]] for Tennessee, and served two terms. Daniel Smith also surveyed the area that would become [[Nashville]], the Tennessee state capital.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn 1773, Smith married Sarah Michie.<ref name=\"Gaines\">Melinda Gaines, \"Sarah Michie Smith, 1755-1831\" in A Modest History of Rock Castle. (Hendersonville: Friends of Rock Castle, 1994), 3.</ref> In 1783 Major Smith moved to the area that would become Tennessee with his wife and two young children to take up land that was given to him by the State of Virginia for his services in the Revolutionary War.<ref name=\"Delaney_2\">Joseph Delaney, \"A Historical Study of Rock Castle.\" (Master's Thesis, Vanderbilt University, 1972-3), 2.</ref> He moved into a small [[log cabin]]. The Smith family lived in this for only a short time before the local [[Indigenous people of the Americas|American Indians]] burned it down in one of many isolated raids.<ref name=\"Delaney_2\"/>\n\nHis best friend and neighbor was [[Andrew Jackson]]. Jackson's original log cabin was a two-story structure  in Hunter's Hill, down the river from Smith's home.<ref name=\"McArdle\">Dave McArdle, Andrew Jackson impersonator and Scholar. Personal Communication with author, 2013.{{reliable source|date=April 2015}}</ref> Smith filled the vacancy in the Senate that was left open by Jackson's resignation.<ref>\"Smith, Daniel, (1748-1818)\"</ref> Smith was also an in-law of Jackson's.\n\n==Sarah Michie Smith==\n[[File:Marker of Sarah Michie Smith.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|Marker of Sarah Smith]]\nSarah was born in 1755 to William Michie, the man that that built the [[Michie Tavern]] near [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]. Her father, a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]], was sentenced to [[Penal transportation|transportation]] for his ideology. He and his family, including the very young Sarah, were brought to the American colonies for a mandatory period of seven years. After the allotted time had passed, William bought a tract of land from [[Major John Henry]] and built a permanent family home. His land was so close to a very well-traveled road that soon after finishing the house, travelers would stop in regularly. Eventually, William decided to open a proper tavern in his home to accommodate his frequent guests. \n\nSarah grew up a socialite. She would have been in the same circles as founding fathers such as Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry. This is how she met Dr. Thomas Walker, who ended up introducing Sarah to Daniel and is credited with setting up their romantic relationship. In 1773, Daniel and Sarah were wed.<ref name=\"Durham_11\">Durham, 11.</ref> \n\nAfter Sarah married Daniel, they moved to the Virginian frontier. Here is where she gave birth to their two children, George and Mary Ann (nicknamed Polly). All four moved to [[Sumner County, Tennessee]] in 1783.<ref>Ruth Witman, \"Tamsen Donner: A Woman's Journey\". Historic Rock Castle Collection, Hendersonville, Tennessee.</ref> They \"arrived in October, and spent at least the first winter in a log cabin. Isolated\u2026 under very real danger from Indian attack.\" <ref name=\"Gaines\" /> Because of her husband's jobs, she found herself alone with her children most of the time. The family described her as having \"uncommon strength and courage with a strong sense of humor.\"<ref>Whitman</ref> Her outgoing and strong nature can also be found in the opening line of a letter she wrote to her husband after a long period of his absence which reads, \"Dear Husband, I still find myself under the disagreeable necessity of conversing with you on paper or not at all.\"<ref>Sarah Michie Smith, letter to her husband, Daniel Smith. N.d. Historic Rock Castle Collection, Hendersonville, Tennessee.</ref>\n\nSarah's social life was impacted greatly when she moved to isolated Sumner county, but she quickly found friendship with [[Rachel Jackson]]. Rachel was not an outgoing person to begin with, but after the scandal surrounding her marriage to two men at once broke, she became a complete recluse. However, she knew she had a close friend in Sarah and found herself at the Smith's home often.<ref name=\"McArdle\"/> \n\n== George Smith ==\nGeorge Smith was the son of Daniel and Sarah Smith. He was born in Virginia in 1775 and moved with his family to Sumner County when he was about eight years old. George would grow up to inherit the home. As an adult, he incurred a large amount of debt as a result of his struggles with both drinking and gambling. George's son, who was a surveyor and a soldier like his grandfather, would end up having to bail his father out of debt to maintain the house. \n\n==Mary Anne \"Polly\" Smith Donelson Saunders==\nPolly was the daughter of Daniel and Sarah Smith. She was raised almost entirely on the frontier of the United States, having been born in 1781 and having moved to nearly unsettled land in 1783 at the age of two. At the age of fifteen, her father decided to send her to a boarding school in [[Philadelphia]] where she would be expected to become a proper young woman in the eyes of the Smith's society. However, Polly did not want to leave because she had fallen in love with 22-year-old Samuel Donelson, Rachel Jackson's brother and Andrew Jackson's partner in law. Polly's father did not want the two to be married, so Andrew and Samuel came up with a plan. They rode over to the Smith's home, where Jackson assisted Polly down a ladder placed against her bedroom window. Andrew Jackson, Samuel Donelson, and Polly Smith traversed down the river to the Jackson's home where a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] was waiting. The two married immediately.<ref>Durham, 202.</ref> After learning of the marriage, Daniel became enraged and essentially disowned his daughter. A year later he welcomed her back into the family after she delivered his first grandchild. Polly would go on to have three children with Samuel, all boys.\n\nTen years into their marriage, Samuel died of pneumonia. Polly remarried with James Saunders, a member of the Saunders family that ran ferries up and down the Cumberland river in the late 1700s. He was also a widower. When they married, the Saunders's had nine children, and over the course of their marriage they had nine more. As a result of their stepfather's abuse, Polly and Samuel's three sons would soon leave the family home. Her oldest joined the military and passed away in service, while her younger two, Andrew Jackson Donelson and [[Daniel Smith Donelson]], were adopted by Andrew and Rachel Jackson.[[File:Mary \"Polly\" Smith Donelson.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Polly Smith Donelson]]\n\n==Slaves at Rock Castle==\nFew records survive regarding the history of enslaved people at Rock Castle. However, two enslaved people are frequently named in surviving documents. A woman named Easter, who worked in the house as a maid or nanny, lived in a loft above the dining room with her husband Alfred. The Smith family referred to this man as \"Uncle Alfred,\" a common occurrence between slaveholding families and the enslaved people who most personally and closely served the family. A newspaper from 1910 also tells the story of an unnamed enslaved man who worked as a foreman on the farm being abducted from the site by Native Americans and taken east. When Smith was a Senator, the enslaved man contacted him to plead for a bounty so that he could be set free from his most recent captivity. Smith offered $900 to the Native people who abducted the unnamed enslaved man, and his captivity was transferred from the abductors to captivity on the plantation landscape of Rock Castle. The man was quoted as saying that he was \"anxious to return to his old master and home.\"<ref>Sumner County News (1910) in Durham, 172</ref> However, seeing as this story was written at a time when black people's experiences in bondage were simplified to appease and appeal to white audience. Thus, it is uncertain if any of this account is accurate or based in any truth at all. More reliable records show that by 1860, the Smiths owned 98 slaves.<ref>Kathleen Gallagher Kemper, \"Life at Rock Castle During the Civil War\" in A Modest History of Rock Castle.</ref> There are two letters of [[bill of sale]] that name the following slaves being sold from George Smith to Harry Smith in 1833:\n\nIsaac, Martin, Charles, Cheshire, Larkin, Ina, Toby, Wilson, David, Henry, Sarah, Rachel, Judy (or Juda), Baty, Mitchel, Daniel, Jeffrey, Patricia, and Patricia's two children, Henrietta and Silva (or Silvia).<ref>George Smith. Bills of Sale to Henry Smith. (May, 1833), (October 1833), Historic Rock Castle Collection, Hendersonville, Tennessee.</ref>\n\n==Mansion and grounds==\nIn 1788, [[Daniel Smith (surveyor)]] acquired {{convert|4722|acre}} of land in [[Sumner County, Tennessee]] along the [[Cumberland River]] and Drake's Creek.<ref>Delaney, 5.</ref> This was added to his land grant from [[North Carolina]] for his services to the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].<ref>State of North Carolina. \"No. 56.

No. 56\" on \"Map of the Lands of Horatio Berry and Wife Nannie Berry.\" (Nashville: Nashville Title Company, 1835), 472. Historic Rock Castle Collection, Hendersonville, Tennessee.</ref> Polly, Daniel and Sarah's daughter, received {{convert|151|acre}} at the death of her father. Sarah received the land below this, in the amount of {{convert|1510|acre}}. The rest of the land, including the mansion went to the son, George Smith.<ref>Daniel Smith, \"Last Will and Testament\" (1818), 1-2. Historic Rock Castle Collection, Hendersonville, Tennessee.</ref> Over time, land was sold off for newer housing. Now, {{convert|18|acre}} adjoin the mansion.\n\nThe mansion was originally located near a stream that no longer flows. There were many slave cabins, a [[springhouse]], and a [[smoke house]]. When [[Old Hickory Lake]] was created in 1954, the flood submerged most of the area behind the house. The smokehouse was razed to accommodate dirt brought in to prevent the house from flooding. {{cn|date=September 2018}} Other buildings included the [[carriage house]] and barns.\n[[File:Front of Historic Rock Castle in Hendersonville, Tennessee.jpg|thumbnail|left|Front of Mansion]][[File:Back of mansion of Rock Castle.jpg|thumbnail|View from the Smokehouse looking toward the back of the mansion showing all three styles of masonry]][[File:Masonry of Rock Castle.jpg|thumbnail|Flemish Style Masonry of Rock Castle]]\nThe [[mansion]] was built in three sections over ten to twelve years. The mansion was built from rocks quarried on site. The first house built was three stories: a kitchen, a bedroom, and an attic. The stone construction inspired the myth that the house was a fireproof \"[[castle]]\" and that the rock protected the family from fires caused by cooking and set by Native Americans defending their right to the land. Later, a three-story addition was added including a basement, a dining room, and a third room that originally had four dormers that were removed later.  The mantle over and around the fireplace is black-maple harvested from Rock Castle's grounds. The last and third edition to the house was added to the front of the house, the most formal portion of the house. Thought this area is currently interpreted as the downstairs master bedroom, it may have been originally used as a withdrawing or retiring room. The third addition also houses Daniel Smith's office. The walls in the space are decorated with faux painting. The upstairs houses George Smith's bedroom and room of unknown use. Rock Castle is the earliest known version of Federal Style architecture in Tennessee. The Greek revival facade with columns and porch may have been added by George Smith or his son Harry. Originally, the house consisted of nine rooms total. {{cn|date=September 2018}}<ref>Melinda Gaines, Friends of Rock Castle Board President and scholar. Personal Interview with author. 2013.{{reliable source|date=April 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs with any historic Middle Tennessee house of this era, construction items could be made on site, purchased from a local merchant, or ordered from exporters located farther east. Window glass could be shipped in cases, as were hinges, English locks, and barrels of cut nails. Enslaved workers with masonry skill mixed cement mortar from lime and sand binding the wall stones together in a \"length-wise and width-wise alternately\u2026 [[Flemish bond]] pattern.\"<ref>Delaney, 16, 18.</ref> This pattern requires planning, skill, and an good understanding of mathematics. Originally the roof was probably clad in pine shingles. A wooden fence painted with lime wash is said to be original to the house.\n\nSmith Hansborough, who is thought to be Daniel Smith's nephew, may have commanded a group of enslaved workers as the project's overseer. In one of his letters to Daniel Smith Hansborough discusses the progress of the house's construction. <ref>Delaney, 17.</ref> \n\n[[File:Rock Castle smokehouse.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Smoke House - original plus top layer of bricks from when the lake was added]]\n[[File:Herb garden and lake.jpg|thumbnail|Herb Garden on the side of  mansion, showing Old Hickory Lake]]\nThere was also an [[herb garden]] and peach [[orchard]] on the grounds. The Smiths were locally famous for their [[peach brandy]], which was sold at five shillings per gallon. Since Daniel Smith had training in the medical field, his gardens may have produced plants used for medicine including [[rosemary]] and [[Mentha|mint]], which helps in [[digestion]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].<ref>\"Medicinal Uses of Rosemary\" Gardens Ablaze. N.d. http://www.gardensablaze.com/HerbRosemaryMed.htm</ref>.<ref name=\"Delaney_21\">Delaney, 21.</ref> The main agricultural enterprise of Rock Castle's plantation landscape was wheat and cotton.<ref name=\"Delaney_21\"/>\n\n==Family cemetery==\nThere are over fifty family members buried within the small family [[cemetery]] on site. The two largest markers are for the founding members, Daniel and Sarah Michie Smith and their son Colonel George Smith. They both have a table-like marker that apparently covers the entire grave. Senator Smith's is breaking down more, but can still be read. There are other small markers, as well as obelisk style markers and pediment style markers within. A stone fence with an iron gate surrounds the cemetery. The stones were quarried using the same stone as the mansion.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n[[File:Rock Castle Family Cemetery.jpg|thumbnail|left|Family Cemetery at Rock Castle]]\n[[File:Inside Family Cemetery at Rock Castle.jpg|thumbnail|View from family cemetery entrance]]\n[[File:Smith Table-like markers.jpg|thumbnail|left|Daniel and Sarah's Grave Markers]]\n[[File:Another Close-up of Daniel Smith's Marker.jpg|thumbnail|Close-up of the top of Daniel's grave marker]]\n\n==Museum==\n[[File:Entering Rock Castle.jpg|thumbnail|left|Entrance sign]]\nThere are four original items within the mansion that belonged to the first Smiths. They are the sugar chest, the blanket chest, Senator Smith's desk and the original land grant from the State of North Carolina. One hundred of Daniel Smith's books are in the museum archives. George's [[sideboard]] and a later generation's grandfather clock is also within the mansion.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe State of Tennessee owns the property and the buildings at Rock Castle. The Tennessee Historical Commission provides a partial annual operating grant to the site and is responsible for major maintenance at the property. The Friends of Rock Castle, Inc. owns all of the artifacts. \n\nThe Friends of Rock Castle was formed in 1969 when the mansion and grounds were sold to the state from a Smith descendant. Board members take pride in the fact that Smith relatives have only owned the house. Sarah Crosby Berry was one of the founding members of the board. Each board member serves a three-year term. Most board members are very active with the site.\n[[File:Visitors Center.jpg|thumbnail|The Visitor's Center at Rock Castle]]\nAt the time of museum creation, the State of Tennessee removed years of updates to the mansion. One update was the removal of a concrete floor in a bathroom, which turned out to be the [[kitchen]]. Sarah Berry assisted with the selection of the stones for the flooring based on her memory from when she was a child. [[Dormers]] were removed from the central portion of the house with the assumption that they were added later. However, they were actually original to that edition of the mansion, but are too expensive to restore at this point.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nMost rooms are currently being interpreted from the late eighteenth century to the early nineteenth century [[Regency era]]. The room off the dining room is being interpreted as the master [[bedroom]] because it is known that later in life, the Smiths did sleep in this room. However, there is no proof that it was built and utilized as such originally. The room immediately above is being used as an exhibit room because there is no proof of use. The room where the dormers had been is extremely dark. In total, visitors are able to view all nine rooms in the house today.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|24em}}\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.historicrockcastle.com/ Official Historic Rock Castle website]\n* ''Sumner County Fact Book 2007-2008''.

Construction began in 1784; its completion was delayed by conflicts with area [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and the house was completed in 1796. It is listed with the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and is open to the public. It is one of the Tennessee Historical Commission's State-Owned Historic Sites and is operated by the Friends of Rock Castle in partnership with the [[Tennessee Historical Commission]].\n\n==Daniel Smith==\n[[File:Daniel Smith Surveyor.jpg|thumbnail|left|Picture of Daniel Smith Donelson, Daniel Smith's grandson]]\nDaniel Smith served as a captain in [[Lord Dunmore's War]], a colonel in the [[American Revolution]], and a Brigadier General of the militia in the Metro District. He was a member of the committee to frame the [[U.S. Bill of Rights]], a Territorial Secretary of State, and a [[U.S. Senator]]. He also surveyed land boundaries in [[Middle Tennessee]].\n\nDaniel Smith was born in Stafford County, [[Virginia]] in 1748 as a twin.<ref>Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the 105th Congress, Second Session, Vol. 144 (October 15, 1998.)</ref> He was baptized in Elbo Warren Baptist Church October 24, which was five days before his twin sister, Sarah, died.<ref>Bill Glidden, in Funeral of Daniel Smith: Historic Rock Castle, Hendersonville, TN. (Hendersonvill: Historic Productions, 2011)</ref> Smith lived in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]] before he moved into the home of Dr. Thomas Walker. At Walker's, Smith studied medicine and surveying. Dr. Walker was famous for being the legal guardian of [[Thomas Jefferson]]. While they were not close in age, Jefferson and Smith did know each other, but Congressional records prove that they met. In these records, Jefferson praises Smith \"For intelligence, well-cultivated talents, integrity, and usefulness, in soundness of judgment in the practice of virtue and in shunning violence unequaled by few men, and in the purity of excelled by none.\" <ref>Thomas Jefferson, quoted in Bill Frist, U.S. Senator, Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the 105th Congress, Second Session, Vol. 144 (October 15, 1998.)</ref> Later, Smith studied at the [[College of William and Mary]], Jefferson's alma matter.<ref>Congressional Record.</ref>[[File:Picture of Gravestone Marker.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Grave Marker of Daniel Smith]]\n\nSmith served in the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He was a Captain and was appointed a Justice of the Peace by [[Patrick Henry]]. He was promoted to Major of the [[Washington County, Tennessee]] Militia. In 1778, Daniel Smith was appointed commissioner to locate roads. In 1779, along with Dr. Walker, he was appointed to extend the line between Virginia and [[North Carolina]].<ref name=\"Berry\">Sarah Crosby Berry. \"Application for the Membership to the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution: Washington D.C.\" (1911) Historic Rock Castle Collection, Hendersonville, Tennessee.</ref> This later became the divisional lines of [[Kentucky]] and Tennessee. Afterward, in April 1778, Major Smith was recommended to become the Sheriff of Washington County. He was appointed Commissioner of Tax in the same year. Later that same year, Smith was appointed Examiner of the Bills of Credit.<ref name=\"Berry\"/> President [[George Washington]] appointed Smith as Secretary of the Territory South of the Ohio, [[Southwest Territory]] in 1790.<ref name=\"bioguide\">\"Smith, Daniel, (1748-1818)\", \"Biographical Directory of the United States Congress: 1774-Present.\" United States Congress. Bioguide.congress.gov. (accessed April 25, 2013).</ref>\n\nLater Smith became Indian negotiator, where he negotiated most of the treaties with the [[Cherokee]] Indians in Tennessee. Smith, as mapmaker, created maps of Tennessee and Kentucky. He is the man that named the state \"Tennasee\" or \"Tanasi\", pronounced \\ten-'ah-see\\. The name was chosen for a Cherokee settlement in the eastern part of the state. Smith drafted the State Constitution of Tennessee and was one of the men who drafted a constitution for the [[Continental Congress]] in 1796.<ref name=\"bioguide\"/> While his draft was not chosen as the Federal Constitution, his work was chosen for the State of Tennessee. Smith became one of the earliest [[United States Senate|Senators]] for Tennessee, and served two terms. Daniel Smith also surveyed the area that would become [[Nashville]], the Tennessee state capital.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn 1773, Smith married Sarah Michie.<ref name=\"Gaines\">Melinda Gaines, \"Sarah Michie Smith, 1755-1831\" in A Modest History of Rock Castle. (Hendersonville: Friends of Rock Castle, 1994), 3.</ref> In 1783 Major Smith moved to the area that would become Tennessee with his wife and two young children to take up land that was given to him by the State of Virginia for his services in the Revolutionary War.<ref name=\"Delaney_2\">Joseph Delaney, \"A Historical Study of Rock Castle.\" (Master's Thesis, Vanderbilt University, 1972-3), 2.</ref> He moved into a small [[log cabin]]. The Smith family lived in this for only a short time before the local [[Indigenous people of the Americas|American Indians]] burned it down in one of many isolated raids.<ref name=\"Delaney_2\"/>\n\nHis best friend and neighbor was [[Andrew Jackson]]. Jackson's original log cabin was a two-story structure  in Hunter's Hill, down the river from Smith's home.<ref name=\"McArdle\">Dave McArdle, Andrew Jackson impersonator and Scholar. Personal Communication with author, 2013.{{reliable source|date=April 2015}}</ref> Smith filled the vacancy in the Senate that was left open by Jackson's resignation.<ref>\"Smith, Daniel, (1748-1818)\"</ref> Smith was also an in-law of Jackson's.\n\n==Sarah Michie Smith==\n[[File:Marker of Sarah Michie Smith.jpg|thumbnail|left|upright|Marker of Sarah Smith]]\nSarah was born in 1755 to William Michie, the man that that built the [[Michie Tavern]] near [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]. Her father, a [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]], was sentenced to [[Penal transportation|transportation]] for his ideology. He and his family, including the very young Sarah, were brought to the American colonies for a mandatory period of seven years. After the allotted time had passed, William bought a tract of land from [[Major John Henry]] and built a permanent family home. His land was so close to a very well-traveled road that soon after finishing the house, travelers would stop in regularly. Eventually, William decided to open a proper tavern in his home to accommodate his frequent guests. \n\nSarah grew up a socialite. She would have been in the same circles as founding fathers such as Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry. This is how she met Dr. Thomas Walker, who ended up introducing Sarah to Daniel and is credited with setting up their romantic relationship. In 1773, Daniel and Sarah were wed.<ref name=\"Durham_11\">Durham, 11.</ref> \n\nAfter Sarah married Daniel, they moved to the Virginian frontier. Here is where she gave birth to their two children, George and Mary Ann (nicknamed Polly). All four moved to [[Sumner County, Tennessee]] in 1783.<ref>Ruth Witman, \"Tamsen Donner: A Woman's Journey\". Historic Rock Castle Collection, Hendersonville, Tennessee.</ref> They \"arrived in October, and spent at least the first winter in a log cabin. Isolated\u2026 under very real danger from Indian attack.\" <ref name=\"Gaines\" /> Because of her husband's jobs, she found herself alone with her children most of the time. The family described her as having \"uncommon strength and courage with a strong sense of humor.\"<ref>Whitman</ref> Her outgoing and strong nature can also be found in the opening line of a letter she wrote to her husband after a long period of his absence which reads, \"Dear Husband, I still find myself under the disagreeable necessity of conversing with you on paper or not at all.\"<ref>Sarah Michie Smith, letter to her husband, Daniel Smith. N.d. Historic Rock Castle Collection, Hendersonville, Tennessee.</ref>\n\nSarah's social life was impacted greatly when she moved to isolated Sumner county, but she quickly found friendship with [[Rachel Jackson]]. Rachel was not an outgoing person to begin with, but after the scandal surrounding her marriage to two men at once broke, she became a complete recluse. However, she knew she had a close friend in Sarah and found herself at the Smith's home often.<ref name=\"McArdle\"/> \n\n== George Smith ==\nGeorge Smith was the son of Daniel and Sarah Smith. He was born in Virginia in 1775 and moved with his family to Sumner County when he was about eight years old. George would grow up to inherit the home. As an adult, he incurred a large amount of debt as a result of his struggles with both drinking and gambling. George's son, who was a surveyor and a soldier like his grandfather, would end up having to bail his father out of debt to maintain the house. \n\n==Mary Anne \"Polly\" Smith Donelson Saunders==\nPolly was the daughter of Daniel and Sarah Smith. She was raised almost entirely on the frontier of the United States, having been born in 1781 and having moved to nearly unsettled land in 1783 at the age of two. At the age of fifteen, her father decided to send her to a boarding school in [[Philadelphia]] where she would be expected to become a proper young woman in the eyes of the Smith's society. However, Polly did not want to leave because she had fallen in love with 22-year-old Samuel Donelson, Rachel Jackson's brother and Andrew Jackson's partner in law. Polly's father did not want the two to be married, so Andrew and Samuel came up with a plan. They rode over to the Smith's home, where Jackson assisted Polly down a ladder placed against her bedroom window. Andrew Jackson, Samuel Donelson, and Polly Smith traversed down the river to the Jackson's home where a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] was waiting. The two married immediately.<ref>Durham, 202.</ref> After learning of the marriage, Daniel became enraged and essentially disowned his daughter. A year later he welcomed her back into the family after she delivered his first grandchild. Polly would go on to have three children with Samuel, all boys.\n\nTen years into their marriage, Samuel died of pneumonia. Polly remarried with James Saunders, a member of the Saunders family that ran ferries up and down the Cumberland river in the late 1700s. He was also a widower. When they married, the Saunders's had nine children, and over the course of their marriage they had nine more. As a result of their stepfather's abuse, Polly and Samuel's three sons would soon leave the family home. Her oldest joined the military and passed away in service, while her younger two, Andrew Jackson Donelson and [[Daniel Smith Donelson]], were adopted by Andrew and Rachel Jackson.[[File:Mary \"Polly\" Smith Donelson.jpg|thumbnail|upright|Polly Smith Donelson]]\n\n==Slaves at Rock Castle==\nFew records survive regarding the history of enslaved people at Rock Castle. However, two enslaved people are frequently named in surviving documents. A woman named Easter, who worked in the house as a maid or nanny, lived in a loft above the dining room with her husband Alfred. The Smith family referred to this man as \"Uncle Alfred,\" a common occurrence between slaveholding families and the enslaved people who most personally and closely served the family. A newspaper from 1910 also tells the story of an unnamed enslaved man who worked as a foreman on the farm being abducted from the site by Native Americans and taken east. When Smith was a Senator, the enslaved man contacted him to plead for a bounty so that he could be set free from his most recent captivity. Smith offered $900 to the Native people who abducted the unnamed enslaved man, and his captivity was transferred from the abductors to captivity on the plantation landscape of Rock Castle. The man was quoted as saying that he was \"anxious to return to his old master and home.\"<ref>Sumner County News (1910) in Durham, 172</ref> However, seeing as this story was written at a time when black people's experiences in bondage were simplified to appease and appeal to white audience. Thus, it is uncertain if any of this account is accurate or based in any truth at all. More reliable records show that by 1860, the Smiths owned 98 slaves.<ref>Kathleen Gallagher Kemper, \"Life at Rock Castle During the Civil War\" in A Modest History of Rock Castle.</ref> There are two letters of [[bill of sale]] that name the following slaves being sold from George Smith to Harry Smith in 1833:\n\nIsaac, Martin, Charles, Cheshire, Larkin, Ina, Toby, Wilson, David, Henry, Sarah, Rachel, Judy (or Juda), Baty, Mitchel, Daniel, Jeffrey, Patricia, and Patricia's two children, Henrietta and Silva (or Silvia).<ref>George Smith.

Historic Rock Castle Collection, Hendersonville, Tennessee.</ref> Polly, Daniel and Sarah's daughter, received {{convert|151|acre}} at the death of her father. Sarah received the land below this, in the amount of {{convert|1510|acre}}. The rest of the land, including the mansion went to the son, George Smith.<ref>Daniel Smith, \"Last Will and Testament\" (1818), 1-2. Historic Rock Castle Collection, Hendersonville, Tennessee.</ref> Over time, land was sold off for newer housing. Now, {{convert|18|acre}} adjoin the mansion.\n\nThe mansion was originally located near a stream that no longer flows. There were many slave cabins, a [[springhouse]], and a [[smoke house]]. When [[Old Hickory Lake]] was created in 1954, the flood submerged most of the area behind the house. The smokehouse was razed to accommodate dirt brought in to prevent the house from flooding. {{cn|date=September 2018}} Other buildings included the [[carriage house]] and barns.\n[[File:Front of Historic Rock Castle in Hendersonville, Tennessee.jpg|thumbnail|left|Front of Mansion]][[File:Back of mansion of Rock Castle.jpg|thumbnail|View from the Smokehouse looking toward the back of the mansion showing all three styles of masonry]][[File:Masonry of Rock Castle.jpg|thumbnail|Flemish Style Masonry of Rock Castle]]\nThe [[mansion]] was built in three sections over ten to twelve years. The mansion was built from rocks quarried on site. The first house built was three stories: a kitchen, a bedroom, and an attic. The stone construction inspired the myth that the house was a fireproof \"[[castle]]\" and that the rock protected the family from fires caused by cooking and set by Native Americans defending their right to the land. Later, a three-story addition was added including a basement, a dining room, and a third room that originally had four dormers that were removed later.  The mantle over and around the fireplace is black-maple harvested from Rock Castle's grounds. The last and third edition to the house was added to the front of the house, the most formal portion of the house. Thought this area is currently interpreted as the downstairs master bedroom, it may have been originally used as a withdrawing or retiring room. The third addition also houses Daniel Smith's office. The walls in the space are decorated with faux painting. The upstairs houses George Smith's bedroom and room of unknown use. Rock Castle is the earliest known version of Federal Style architecture in Tennessee. The Greek revival facade with columns and porch may have been added by George Smith or his son Harry. Originally, the house consisted of nine rooms total. {{cn|date=September 2018}}<ref>Melinda Gaines, Friends of Rock Castle Board President and scholar. Personal Interview with author. 2013.{{reliable source|date=April 2015}}</ref>\n\nAs with any historic Middle Tennessee house of this era, construction items could be made on site, purchased from a local merchant, or ordered from exporters located farther east. Window glass could be shipped in cases, as were hinges, English locks, and barrels of cut nails. Enslaved workers with masonry skill mixed cement mortar from lime and sand binding the wall stones together in a \"length-wise and width-wise alternately\u2026 [[Flemish bond]] pattern.\"<ref>Delaney, 16, 18.</ref> This pattern requires planning, skill, and an good understanding of mathematics. Originally the roof was probably clad in pine shingles. A wooden fence painted with lime wash is said to be original to the house.\n\nSmith Hansborough, who is thought to be Daniel Smith's nephew, may have commanded a group of enslaved workers as the project's overseer. In one of his letters to Daniel Smith Hansborough discusses the progress of the house's construction. <ref>Delaney, 17.</ref> \n\n[[File:Rock Castle smokehouse.jpg|thumbnail|left|The Smoke House - original plus top layer of bricks from when the lake was added]]\n[[File:Herb garden and lake.jpg|thumbnail|Herb Garden on the side of  mansion, showing Old Hickory Lake]]\nThere was also an [[herb garden]] and peach [[orchard]] on the grounds. The Smith's were locally famous for their [[peach brandy]], which was sold at five shillings per gallon. Since Daniel Smith had training in the medical field, his gardens may have produced plants used for medicine including [[rosemary]] and [[Mentha|mint]], which helps in [[digestion]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]].<ref>\"Medicinal Uses of Rosemary\" Gardens Ablaze. N.d. http://www.gardensablaze.com/HerbRosemaryMed.htm</ref>.<ref name=\"Delaney_21\">Delaney, 21.</ref> The main agricultural enterprise of Rock Castle's plantation landscape was wheat and cotton.<ref name=\"Delaney_21\"/>\n\n==Family cemetery==\nThere are over fifty family members buried within the small family [[cemetery]] on site. The two largest markers are for the founding members, Daniel and Sarah Michie Smith and their son Colonel George Smith. They both have a table-like marker that apparently covers the entire grave. Senator Smith's is breaking down more, but can still be read. There are other small markers, as well as obelisk style markers and pediment style markers within. A stone fence with an iron gate surrounds the cemetery. The stones were quarried using the same stone as the mansion.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n[[File:Rock Castle Family Cemetery.jpg|thumbnail|left|Family Cemetery at Rock Castle]]\n[[File:Inside Family Cemetery at Rock Castle.jpg|thumbnail|View from family cemetery entrance]]\n[[File:Smith Table-like markers.jpg|thumbnail|left|Daniel and Sarah's Grave Markers]]\n[[File:Another Close-up of Daniel Smith's Marker.jpg|thumbnail|Close-up of the top of Daniel's grave marker]]\n\n==Museum==\n[[File:Entering Rock Castle.jpg|thumbnail|left|Entrance sign]]\nThere are four original items within the mansion that belonged to the first Smiths. They are the sugar chest, the blanket chest, Senator Smith's desk and the original land grant from the State of North Carolina. One hundred of Daniel Smith's books are in the museum archives. George's [[sideboard]] and a later generation's grandfather clock is also within the mansion.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe State of Tennessee owns the property and the buildings at Rock Castle. The Tennessee Historical Commission provides a partial annual operating grant to the site and is responsible for major maintenance at the property. The Friends of Rock Castle, Inc. owns all of the artifacts. \n\nThe Friends of Rock Castle was formed in 1969 when the mansion and grounds were sold to the state from a Smith descendant. Board members take pride in the fact that Smith relatives have only owned the house. Sarah Crosby Berry was one of the founding members of the board. Each board member serves a three-year term. Most board members are very active with the site.\n[[File:Visitors Center.jpg|thumbnail|The Visitor's Center at Rock Castle]]\nAt the time of museum creation, the State of Tennessee removed years of updates to the mansion. One update was the removal of a concrete floor in a bathroom, which turned out to be the [[kitchen]]. Sarah Berry assisted with the selection of the stones for the flooring based on her memory from when she was a child. [[Dormers]] were removed from the central portion of the house with the assumption that they were added later. However, they were actually original to that edition of the mansion, but are too expensive to restore at this point.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\nMost rooms are currently being interpreted from the late eighteenth century to the early nineteenth century [[Regency era]]. The room off the dining room is being interpreted as the master [[bedroom]] because it is known that later in life, the Smiths did sleep in this room. However, there is no proof that it was built and utilized as such originally. The room immediately above is being used as an exhibit room because there is no proof of use. The room where the dormers had been is extremely dark. In total, visitors are able to view all nine rooms in the house today.{{cn|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|24em}}\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.historicrockcastle.com/ Official Historic Rock Castle website]\n* ''Sumner County Fact Book 2007-2008''.
