The Rising was launched by [[Irish republicanism|Irish republicans]] to end British rule in Ireland and establish an independent [[Irish Republic]] while the United Kingdom was fighting the [[First World War]]. It was the most significant [[List of Irish uprisings|uprising in Ireland]] since the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion of 1798]] and the first armed action of the [[Irish revolutionary period]]. Sixteen of the Rising's leaders were executed in May 1916, but the insurrection, the nature of the executions, and subsequent political developments ultimately contributed to an increase in popular support for Irish independence.\n\nOrganised by a seven-man Military Council of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]], the Rising began on Easter Monday, 24 April 1916 and lasted for six days.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_RhCAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22military+council%22+irb&q=%22military+council%22+&pgis=1#search_anchor ''Leaders and Men of the Easter Rising: Dublin 1916''] Francis X. Martin 1967 p105</ref> Members of the [[Irish Volunteers]], led by schoolmaster and Irish language activist [[Patrick Pearse]], joined by the smaller [[Irish Citizen Army]] of [[James Connolly]] and 200 women of [[Cumann na mBan]], seized strategically important buildings in [[Dublin]] and [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|proclaimed an Irish Republic]]. The [[British Army]] brought in thousands of reinforcements as well as artillery and a gunboat. There was street fighting on the routes into the city centre, where the rebels slowed the British advance and inflicted many casualties. Elsewhere in Dublin, the fighting mainly consisted of sniping and long-range gun battles. The main rebel positions were gradually surrounded and bombarded with artillery. There were isolated actions in other parts of Ireland; Volunteer leader [[Eoin MacNeill]] had issued a countermand in a bid to halt the Rising, which greatly reduced the number of rebels who mobilised.\n\nWith much greater numbers and heavier weapons, the British Army suppressed the Rising. Pearse agreed to an unconditional surrender on Saturday 29 April, although sporadic fighting continued briefly. After the surrender the country remained under [[martial law]]. About 3,500 people were taken prisoner by the British and 1,800 of them were sent to internment camps or prisons in Britain. Most of the leaders of the Rising were executed following courts-martial. The Rising brought [[Physical force Irish republicanism|physical force republicanism]] back to the forefront of Irish politics, which for nearly fifty years had been dominated by constitutional nationalism. Opposition to the British reaction to the Rising contributed to changes in public opinion and the move toward independence, as shown in the [[1918 Irish general election|December 1918 election]] which was won by the [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] party, which convened the [[First D\u00e1il]] and declared independence.\n\nOf the 485 people killed in the Easter Rising: 54 percent were civilians, 30 percent were British military and police and 16 percent were Irish rebels. More than 2,600 were wounded. Many of the civilians were killed or wounded by British artillery and machine guns or were mistaken for rebels. Others were caught in the crossfire in the crowded city. The shelling and resulting fires left parts of central Dublin in ruins.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Irish Citizen Army Group Liberty Hall Dublin 1914.jpg|thumb|Members of the Irish Citizen Army outside [[Liberty Hall]], under the slogan \"We serve neither [[George V|King]] nor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser]], but Ireland\"]]\nThe [[Acts of Union 1800]] united the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] as the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], abolishing the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] and giving Ireland representation in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]]. From early on, many [[Irish nationalist]]s opposed the union and the ensuing exploitation and impoverishment of the island, which led to a high level of depopulation.<ref>MacDonagh, pp. 14\u201317</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Behrendt|first1=Stephen C.|title=British Women Poets and the Romantic Writing Community|date=2010|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0801895081|pages=244\u20135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Zxrkbg2hQAC&pg=PA244#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref> Opposition took various forms: constitutional (the [[Repeal Association]]; the [[Home Rule League]]), social ([[Irish Church Act 1869|disestablishment of the Church of Ireland]]; the [[Irish National Land League|Land League]]) and revolutionary ([[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848|Rebellion of 1848]]; [[Fenian Rising]]).<ref>[[Mansergh, Nicholas]], ''The Irish Question 1840\u20131921'', George Allen & Unwin, 1978, {{ISBN|0-04-901022-0}} p. 244</ref> The [[Irish Home Rule movement]] sought to achieve self-government for Ireland, within the United Kingdom. In 1886, the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP) under [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] succeeded in having the [[Irish Government Bill 1886|First Home Rule Bill]] introduced in the British parliament, but it was defeated. The [[Irish Government Bill 1893|Second Home Rule Bill]] of 1893 was passed by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] but rejected by the [[House of Lords]].\n\nAfter the fall of Parnell, younger and more radical nationalists became disillusioned with parliamentary politics and turned toward more extreme forms of separatism. The [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], the [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] and the [[Gaelic revival|cultural revival]] under [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Lady Augusta Gregory]], together with the new political thinking of [[Arthur Griffith]] expressed in his newspaper ''[[Sinn F\u00e9in Printing & Publishing Company|Sinn F\u00e9in]]'' and organisations such as the National Council and the Sinn F\u00e9in League, led many Irish people to identify with the idea of an independent [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Ireland.<ref>MacDonagh, Oliver, pp. 72\u201374</ref><ref>Feeney, p. 22</ref> This was sometimes referred to by the generic term ''Sinn F\u00e9in''.<ref>Feeney, p. 37</ref>\n\nThe [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]] was introduced by British Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] in 1912. [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]], who were Protestant, opposed it, as they did not want to be ruled by a Catholic-dominated Irish government. Led by [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]] and [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], they formed the [[Ulster Volunteers]] (UVF) in January 1913.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nli.ie/1916/exhibition/en/content/stagesetters/index.pdf|title=Those who set the stage|work=The 1916 Rising: Personalities and Perspectives|publisher=National Library of Ireland|accessdate=7 December 2009}}</ref> In response, Irish nationalists formed a rival paramilitary group, the [[Irish Volunteers]], in November 1913. The [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] (IRB) was a driving force behind the Irish Volunteers and attempted to control it. Its leader was [[Eoin MacNeill]], who was not an IRB member.<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 7\u20138</ref> The Irish Volunteers' stated goal was \"to secure and to maintain the rights and liberties common to all the people of Ireland\". It included people with a range of political views, and was open to \"all able-bodied Irishmen without distinction of creed, politics or social group\".<ref>Macardle, pp. 90\u201392</ref> Another militant group, the [[Irish Citizen Army]], was formed by trade unionists as a result of the [[Dublin Lock-out]] of that year.<ref>Townshend, p. 49</ref> When the Irish Volunteers [[Howth gun-running|smuggled rifles into Dublin]], the British Army attempted to stop them and fired into a crowd of civilians. British Army officers then [[Curragh incident|threatened to resign]] if they were ordered to take action against the UVF. By 1914, Ireland seemed to be on the brink of a civil war.<ref>Collins, M.E.. ''Sovereignty and partition, 1912\u20131949''.

The Home Rule Bill was enacted, but its implementation was postponed by a [[Suspensory Act 1914|suspensory act]] until the end of the war.\n\n==Planning the Rising==\n[[File:Casement Roger.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Roger Casement]], who attempted to smuggle weapons from Germany for the Rising]]\nThe Supreme Council of the IRB met on 5 September 1914, just over a month after the British government had declared war on [[German Empire|Germany]]. At this meeting, they decided to stage an uprising before the war ended and to secure help from Germany.<ref>Caulfield, Max, p. 18</ref> Responsibility for the planning of the rising was given to [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]] and [[Se\u00e1n Mac Diarmada|Se\u00e1n MacDermott (''Mac Diarmada'')]].<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 16</ref> The Irish Volunteers\u2014the smaller of the two forces resulting from the September 1914 split over support for the British war effort<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 13</ref>\u2014set up a \"headquarters staff\" that included [[Patrick Pearse]]<ref>Sean Farrell Moran, ''Patrick Pearse and the Politics of Redemption: The Mind of the Easter Rising'', (1994), Ruth Dudley Edwards, ''Patrick Pearse and the Triumph of Failure'', (1977), Joost Augustin, ''Patrick Pearse', (2009)</ref> as Director of Military Organisation, [[Joseph Plunkett]] as Director of Military Operations and [[Thomas MacDonagh]] as Director of Training. [[\u00c9amonn Ceannt]] was later added as Director of Communications.<ref>Townshend, p. 92</ref>\n\nIn May 1915, Clarke and MacDermott established a Military Committee or Military Council within the IRB, consisting of Pearse, Plunkett and Ceannt, to draw up plans for a rising.<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 16, 19</ref> Clarke and MacDermott joined it shortly after. The Military Council was able to promote its own policies and personnel independently of both the Volunteer Executive and the IRB Executive. Although the Volunteer and IRB leaders were not against a rising in principle, they were of the opinion that it was not opportune at that moment.<ref>McGarry, p. 116</ref> Volunteer Chief-of-Staff [[Eoin MacNeill]] supported a rising only if the British government attempted to suppress the Volunteers or introduce conscription, and if such a rising had some chance of success. IRB President [[Denis McCullough]] and prominent IRB member [[Bulmer Hobson]] held similar views.<ref>Townshend, p. 94</ref> The Military Council kept its plans secret, so as to prevent the British authorities learning of the plans, and to thwart those within the organisation who might try to stop the rising. IRB members held officer rank in the Volunteers throughout the country and took their orders from the Military Council, not from MacNeill.<ref>Macardle, p. 119</ref>\n\nShortly after the outbreak of World War I, [[Roger Casement]] and [[Clan na Gael]] leader [[John Devoy]] met the German ambassador to the United States, [[Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff]], to discuss German backing for an uprising. Casement went to Germany and began negotiations with the German government and military. He persuaded the Germans to announce their support for Irish independence in November 1914.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 25</ref> Casement also attempted to recruit an [[Irish Brigade (World War I)|Irish Brigade]], made up of Irish [[World War I prisoners of war in Germany|prisoners of war]], which would be armed and sent to Ireland to join the uprising.<ref>Townshend, p. 104</ref><ref>Foy and Barton, p. 105</ref> However, only 56 men volunteered. Plunkett joined Casement in Germany the following year. Together, Plunkett and Casement presented a plan (the 'Ireland Report') in which a German [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] would land on the west coast of Ireland, while a rising in Dublin diverted the British forces so that the Germans, with the help of local Volunteers, could secure the line of the [[River Shannon]], before advancing on the capital.<ref>McNally and Dennis, p. 30</ref> The German military rejected the plan, but agreed to ship arms and ammunition to the Volunteers.<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 25\u201328</ref>\n\n[[James Connolly]]\u2014head of the [[Irish Citizen Army]] (ICA), a group of armed socialist trade union men and women\u2014was unaware of the IRB's plans, and threatened to start a rebellion on his own if other parties failed to act. If they had done it alone, the IRB and the Volunteers would possibly have come to their aid;<ref>[[Eoin Neeson]], ''Myths from Easter 1916'', p. ?</ref> however, the IRB leaders met with Connolly in January 1916 and convinced him to join forces with them. They agreed that they would launch a rising together at Easter and made Connolly the sixth member of the Military Council. [[Thomas MacDonagh]] would later become the seventh and final member.\n\nThe death of the old [[Fenian]] leader [[Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa]] in [[New York City|New York]] in August 1915 was an opportunity to mount a spectacular demonstration. His body was sent to Ireland for burial in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]], with the Volunteers in charge of arrangements. Huge crowds lined the route and gathered at the graveside. Pearse made a dramatic funeral oration, a rallying call to republicans, which ended with the words \"[[Ireland unfree shall never be at peace]]\".<ref>Kennedy, pp. 199\u2013200</ref>\n\n==Build-up to Easter Week==\n[[File:Signatories of the Proclamation of the Republic.png|thumb|The signatories of the Proclamation: Tom Clarke, Se\u00e1n MacDiarmada, Thomas MacDonagh, Patrick Pearse, \u00c9amonn Ceannt, James Connolly, Joseph Plunkett]]\nIn early April, Pearse issued orders to the Irish Volunteers for three days of \"parades and manoeuvres\" beginning on Easter Sunday. He had the authority to do this, as the Volunteers' Director of Organisation. The idea was that IRB members within the organisation would know these were orders to begin the rising, while men such as MacNeill and the British authorities would take it at face value.\n\nOn 9 April, the [[Imperial German Navy|German Navy]] dispatched the [[SS Libau]] for [[County Kerry]], disguised as the Norwegian ship ''Aud''.<ref>Caulfield, Max, p. 29</ref> It was loaded with 20,000 rifles, one million rounds of ammunition, and explosives. Casement also left for Ireland aboard the German submarine ''[[SM U-19 (Germany)|U-19]]''. He was disappointed with the level of support offered by the Germans and he intended to stop or at least postpone the rising.<ref>Foy and Barton, p.56</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday 19 April, Alderman [[Thomas Kelly (Sinn F\u00e9in politician)|Tom Kelly]], a Sinn F\u00e9in member of Dublin Corporation, read out at a meeting of the Corporation a document purportedly leaked from Dublin Castle, detailing plans by the British authorities to shortly arrest leaders of the Irish Volunteers, Sinn F\u00e9in and the Gaelic League, and occupy their premises.<ref>Townshend, pp. 131\u2013132</ref> Although the British authorities said the \"Castle Document\" was fake, MacNeill ordered the Volunteers to prepare to resist.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 47</ref> Unbeknownst to MacNeill, the document had been [[Forgery|forged]] by the Military Council to persuade moderates of the need for their planned uprising. It was an edited version of a real document outlining British plans in the event of conscription.<ref>McGarry, p. 117</ref> That same day, the Military Council informed senior Volunteer officers that the rising would begin on Easter Sunday. However, it chose not to inform the rank-and-file, or moderates such as MacNeill, until the last minute.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 48</ref>\n\nThe following day, MacNeill got wind that a rising was about to be launched and threatened to do everything he could to prevent it, short of informing the British.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 52</ref> MacNeill was briefly persuaded to go along with some sort of action when Mac Diarmada revealed to him that a German arms shipment was about to land in [[County Kerry]]. MacNeill believed that when the British learned of the shipment they would immediately suppress the Volunteers, thus the Volunteers would be justified in taking defensive action, including the planned manoeuvres.<ref>Michael Tierney, ''Eoin MacNeill'', pp. 199, 214</ref>\n\nThe ''Aud'' and the ''U-19'' reached the coast of Kerry on Good Friday, 21 April. This was earlier than the Volunteers expected and so none were there to meet the vessels. The [[Royal Navy]] had known about the arms shipment and intercepted the ''Aud'', prompting the captain to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] the ship. Furthermore, Casement was captured shortly after he landed at [[Banna Strand]].<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 57\u201358</ref>\n\nWhen MacNeill learned from Vol. [[Patrick Whelan]] that the arms shipment had been lost, he reverted to his original position. With the support of other leaders of like mind, notably Bulmer Hobson and [[The O'Rahilly]], he issued a countermand to all Volunteers, cancelling all actions for Sunday. This countermanding order was relayed to Volunteer officers and printed in the Sunday morning newspapers. It succeeded only in delaying the rising for a day, although it greatly reduced the number of Volunteers who turned out.\n\n[[Naval Intelligence Division|British Naval Intelligence]] had been aware of the arms shipment, Casement's return, and the Easter date for the rising through radio messages between Germany and its embassy in the United States that were intercepted by the Royal Navy and deciphered in [[Room 40]] of the Admiralty.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, p. 138</ref> The information was passed to the [[Under-Secretary for Ireland]], Sir [[Matthew Nathan]], on 17 April, but without revealing its source, and Nathan was doubtful about its accuracy.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, p. 79</ref> When news reached Dublin of the capture of the ''Aud'' and the arrest of Casement, Nathan conferred with the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], [[Ivor Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne|Lord Wimborne]]. Nathan proposed to raid [[Liberty Hall]], headquarters of the Citizen Army, and Volunteer properties at Father Matthew Park and at [[Kimmage]], but Wimborne insisted on wholesale arrests of the leaders. It was decided to postpone action until after Easter Monday, and in the meantime Nathan telegraphed the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland|Chief Secretary]], [[Augustine Birrell]], in London seeking his approval.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, pp. 81\u201387</ref> By the time Birrell cabled his reply authorising the action, at noon on Monday 24 April 1916, the Rising had already begun.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, p. 88</ref>\n\nOn the morning of Easter Sunday, 23 April, the Military Council met at Liberty Hall to discuss what to do in light of MacNeill's countermanding order. They decided that the Rising would go ahead the following day, Easter Monday, and that the Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army would go into action as the 'Army of the Irish Republic'. They elected Pearse as president of the Irish Republic, and also as Commander-in-Chief of the army; Connolly became Commandant of the Dublin Brigade.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 66</ref> Messengers were then sent to all units informing them of the new orders.<ref name=\"rte-timeline\">[http://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/index.php/articles/chronology-of-the-easter-rising Chronology of the Easter Rising].

This was due to MacNeill's countermanding order, and the fact that the new orders had been sent so soon beforehand. However, several hundred Volunteers joined the Rising after it began.<ref name=\"McGarry, p. 129\">McGarry, p. 129</ref>\n\nShortly before midday, the rebels began to seize important sites in central Dublin. The rebels' plan was to hold Dublin city centre. This was a large, oval-shaped area bounded by two canals: the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand]] to the south and the [[Royal Canal|Royal]] to the north, with the [[River Liffey]] running through the middle. On the southern and western edges of this district were five British Army barracks. Most of the rebels' positions had been chosen to defend against counter-attacks from these barracks.<ref>Dorney, John. ''The Story of the Easter Rising, 1916''. Green Lamp, 2010. p. 33</ref> The rebels took the positions with ease. Civilians were evacuated and policemen were ejected or taken prisoner.<ref>McGarry, p. 133</ref> Windows and doors were barricaded, food and supplies were secured, and first aid posts were set up. Barricades were erected on the streets to hinder British Army movement.<ref>McGarry, p. 135</ref>\n\nA joint force of about 400 Volunteers and Citizen Army gathered at Liberty Hall under the command of Commandant James Connolly. This was the headquarters battalion, and it also included Commander-in-Chief Patrick Pearse, as well as [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]], [[Se\u00e1n Mac Diarmada|Se\u00e1n MacDermott]] and [[Joseph Mary Plunkett|Joseph Plunkett]].<ref>McNally and Dennis, p. 41</ref> They marched to the [[General Post Office, Dublin|General Post Office]] (GPO) on [[O'Connell Street]], Dublin's main thoroughfare, occupied the building and hoisted two republican flags.

Volunteers from the GPO also occupied other buildings on the street, including buildings overlooking [[O'Connell Bridge]]. They took over a [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless telegraph]] station and sent out a [[Radio broadcasting|radio broadcast]] in [[Morse code]], announcing that an Irish Republic had been declared. This was the first radio broadcast in Ireland.<ref>McGee, John.

The 1st battalion, under [[Edward Daly (Irish revolutionary)|Edward 'Ned' Daly]], occupied the [[Four Courts]] and surrounding buildings, while a company under [[Se\u00e1n Heuston]] occupied the [[Mendicity Institution]], across the River Liffey from the Four Courts. The 2nd battalion, under [[Thomas MacDonagh]], occupied [[Jacob's]] biscuit factory. The 3rd battalion, under [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], occupied [[Boland's Mill]] and surrounding buildings. The 4th battalion, under [[\u00c9amonn Ceannt]], occupied the [[House of Industry (Dublin)|South Dublin Union]] and the distillery on [[Marrowbone Lane]]. From each of these garrisons, small units of rebels established [[Outpost (military)|outposts]] in the surrounding area.<ref>McNally and Dennis, pp. 39\u201340</ref>\n\nThe rebels also attempted to cut transport and communication links. As well as erecting roadblocks, they took control of various bridges and cut telephone and telegraph wires. [[Dublin Pearse railway station|Westland Row]] and [[Harcourt Street railway station|Harcourt Street]] railway stations were occupied, though the latter only briefly. The railway line was cut at [[Fairview, Dublin|Fairview]] and the line was damaged by bombs at [[Dublin Connolly railway station|Amiens Street]], [[Dublin Broadstone railway station|Broadstone]], [[Dublin Heuston railway station|Kingsbridge]] and [[Lansdowne Road railway station|Lansdowne Road]].<ref>McKenna, Joseph.

The goal was to seize weapons and blow up the ammunition store to signal that the Rising had begun. They seized weapons and planted explosives, but the blast was not big enough to be heard across the city.<ref>Caulfield, Max, pp. 48\u201350</ref> The 23-year-old son of the fort's commander was fatally shot when he ran to raise the alarm.<ref>[http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/children-of-the-revolution/ \"Children of the Revolution\"].

As they approached the gate a lone and unarmed police sentry, James O'Brien, attempted to stop them and was shot dead by Connolly. According to some accounts, he was the first casualty of the Rising. The rebels overpowered the soldiers in the guardroom, but failed to press further. The British Army's chief intelligence officer, Major Ivon Price, fired on the rebels while the [[Under-Secretary for Ireland]], Sir [[Matthew Nathan]], helped shut the castle gates.

The British commander, Lowe, worked slowly, unsure of the size of the force he was up against, and with only 1,269 troops in the city when he arrived from the [[Curragh Camp]] in the early hours of Tuesday 25 April.

In the northeast, British troops left Amiens Street railway station in an armoured train, to secure and repair a section of damaged tracks. They were attacked by rebels who had taken up position at [[Annesley Bridge]]. After a two-hour battle, the British were forced to retreat and several soldiers were captured.<ref name=caulfield145>Caulfield, pp. 145\u2013146</ref> At [[Phibsborough]], in the northwest, rebels had occupied buildings and erected barricades at junctions on the North Circular Road.

As a result, during the following week, the British were able to bring in thousands of reinforcements from Britain and from their garrisons at [[the Curragh]] and [[Belfast]]. By the end of the week, British strength stood at over 16,000 men.<ref name=\"Townshend p191\"/><ref>McGarry, pp. 167\u2013169</ref> Their firepower was provided by field artillery which they positioned on the [[Northside, Dublin|Northside]] of the city at Phibsborough and at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], and by the patrol vessel ''[[Irish patrol vessel Muirch\u00fa|Helga]]'', which sailed up the [[River Liffey|Liffey]], having been summoned from the port at Kingstown.

One Volunteer in the GPO recalled, \"we did practically no shooting as there was no target\".<ref>McGarry, p. 175</ref> However, where the insurgents dominated the routes by which the British tried to funnel reinforcements into the city, there was fierce fighting.\n\nAt 5:25PM Volunteers [[Eamon Martin (Irish Republican)|Eamon Martin]], Garry Holohan, Robert Beggs, Sean Cody, Dinny O'Callaghan, Charles Shelley, Peadar Breslin and five others attempted to occupy Broadstone railway station on Church Street, the attack was unsuccessful and Martin was injured.<ref name=\"rte-timeline\"/><ref>Witness Statement by Eamon Martin to Bureau of Military History, 1951</ref><ref>Witness Statement of Sean Cody to Bureau of Military History, 1954</ref><ref>Witness Statement of Nicholas Kaftan to Bureau of Military History</ref><ref>Witness Statement of Charles Shelley to Bureau of Military History, 1953</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday morning, hundreds of British troops encircled the Mendicity Institute, which was occupied by 26 Volunteers under Se\u00e1n Heuston. British troops advanced on the building, supported by snipers and machine gun fire, but the Volunteers put up stiff resistance. Eventually, the troops got close enough to hurl grenades into the building, some of which the rebels threw back. Exhausted and almost out of ammunition, Heuston's men became the first rebel position to surrender. Heuston had been ordered to hold his position for a few hours, to delay the British, but had held on for three days.<ref>O'Brien, Paul.

Heavy fighting occurred at the rebel-held positions around the [[Grand Canal of Ireland|Grand Canal]] as these troops advanced towards Dublin. More than 1,000 [[Sherwood Foresters]] were repeatedly caught in a cross-fire trying to cross the canal at Mount Street Bridge.

The South Dublin Union was a large complex of buildings and there was vicious fighting around and inside the buildings. [[Cathal Brugha]], a rebel officer, distinguished himself in this action and was badly wounded. By the end of the week, the British had taken some of the buildings in the Union, but others remained in rebel hands.<ref>Caulfield, pp. 225\u2013228</ref> British troops also took casualties in unsuccessful frontal assaults on the Marrowbone Lane Distillery.<ref>Ryan, pp. 128\u2013133</ref>\n\n[[File:Birth of the Irish Republic.jpg|thumb|''Birth of the Irish Republic'' by [[Walter Paget]], depicting the GPO during the shelling]]\nThe third major scene of fighting during the week was in the area of North King Street, north of the Four Courts. The rebels had established strong outposts in the area, occupying numerous small buildings and barricading the streets. From Thursday to Saturday, the British made repeated attempts to take the area, in what was some of the fiercest fighting of the Rising. As the troops moved in, the rebels continually opened fire from windows and behind chimneys and barricades. At one point, a platoon led by Major Sheppard made a [[Charge (warfare)|bayonet charge]] on one of the barricades, but was cut down by rebel fire. The British employed machine guns and attempted to avoid direct fire by using makeshift armoured trucks, and by [[mouse-holing]] through the inside walls of terraced houses to get near the rebel positions.<ref>Dorney, John.

The president of the courts-martial was [[Charles Blackader]]. Controversially, Maxwell decided that the courts-martial would be held in secret and without a defence, which Crown law officers later ruled to have been illegal.<ref name=foy294/> Some of those who conducted the trials had commanded British troops involved in suppressing the Rising, a conflict of interest that the Military Manual prohibited.<ref name=foy294/> Only one of those tried by courts-martial was a woman, [[Constance Markievicz]], who was also the only woman to be kept in solitary confinement.<ref name=foy294/> Ninety were sentenced to death. Fifteen of those (including all seven signatories of the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|Proclamation]]) had their sentences confirmed by Maxwell and fourteen were [[Execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] at [[Kilmainham Gaol]] between 3 and 12 May. Among them was the seriously wounded Connolly, who was shot while tied to a chair because of his shattered ankle. Maxwell stated that only the \"ringleaders\" and those proven to have committed \"coldblooded murder\" would be executed. However, the evidence presented was weak, and some of those executed were not leaders and did not kill anyone: [[Willie Pearse]] described himself as \"a personal attach\u00e9 to my brother, Patrick Pearse\"; [[John MacBride]] had not even been aware of the Rising until it began, but had fought against the British in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] fifteen years before; [[Thomas Kent]] did not come out at all\u2014he was executed for the killing of a police officer during the raid on his house the week after the Rising. The most prominent leader to escape execution was [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], Commandant of the 3rd Battalion, who did so partly because of his American birth.<ref name=\"Oxford\">{{Cite book |title=Oxford Companion to Irish History |author=S.

After the first three executions, [[John Redmond]], leader of the moderate [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], said in the British Parliament that the rising \"happily, seems to be over.

He said \"it is not murderers who are being executed; it is insurgents who have fought a clean fight, a brave fight, however misguided\".

Although they did not receive as much attention as the executions, they sparked outrage among the Irish public and were raised by Irish MPs in Parliament.\n\nOne incident was the 'Portobello killings'. On Tuesday 25 April, Dubliner [[Francis Sheehy-Skeffington]], a pacifist nationalist activist, had been arrested by British soldiers. Captain John Bowen-Colthurst then took him with a British raiding party as a hostage and [[human shield]]. On Rathmines Road he stopped a boy named James Coade, whom he shot dead. His troops then destroyed a tobacconist's shop with grenades and seized journalists Thomas Dickson and Patrick MacIntyre. The next morning, Colthurst had Skeffington and the two journalists shot by firing squad in [[Cathal Brugha Barracks|Portobello Barracks]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bacon|first1=Bryan|title=A Terrible Duty: the Madness of Captain Bowen-Colthurst|date=2015|publisher=Thena Press}}</ref> The bodies were then buried there. Later that day he shot a Labour Party councillor, [[Richard O'Carroll]]. When Major Sir [[Francis Vane]] learned of the killings he telephoned his superiors in Dublin Castle, but no action was taken. Vane informed [[Herbert Kitchener]], who told General [[John Maxwell (British Army officer)|Maxwell]] to arrest Colthurst, but Maxwell refused. Colthurst was eventually arrested and court-martialled in June. He was found guilty of murder but insane, and detained for twenty months at [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor]]. Public and political pressure led to a public inquiry, which reached similar conclusions. Major Vane was discharged \"owing to his action in the Skeffington murder case\".<ref>McGarry, p. 186</ref><ref>Townshend, p. 193</ref><ref>Caulfield, Max, p. 187</ref><ref>Yeates, P\u00e1draig.

On the night of 28\u201329 April, British soldiers of the [[South Staffordshire Regiment]], under Colonel Henry Taylor, had burst into houses on North King Street and killed 15 male civilians whom they accused of being rebels. The soldiers shot or bayoneted the victims, then secretly buried some of them in cellars or back yards after robbing them. The area saw some of the fiercest fighting of the Rising and the British had taken heavy casualties for little gain. General Maxwell attempted to excuse the killings and argued that the rebels were ultimately responsible. He claimed that \"the rebels wore no uniform\" and that the people of North King Street were rebel sympathisers. Maxwell concluded that such incidents \"are absolutely unavoidable in such a business as this\" and that \"under the circumstance the troops [...] behaved with the greatest restraint\". A private brief, prepared for the Prime Minister, said the soldiers \"had orders not to take any prisoners\" but took it to mean they were to shoot any suspected rebel. The City Coroner's inquest found that soldiers had killed \"unarmed and unoffending\" residents. The military court of inquiry ruled that no specific soldiers could be held responsible, and no action was taken.<ref>McGarry, p. 187</ref><ref>Caulfield, pp. 338\u2013340</ref><ref>Coogan {{which|date=September 2016}}, pp. 152\u2013155</ref><ref>Townshend, pp. 293\u2013294</ref><ref>Dorney, John.

Historian [[Keith Jeffery]] noted that most of the opposition came from people whose relatives were in the British Army and who depended on their army allowances.<ref>Kennedy, p. 286</ref> Those most openly hostile to the Volunteers were the \"separation women\" (so-called because they were paid \"separation money\" by the British government), whose husbands and sons were fighting in the British Army in the First World War. There was also hostility from [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]].<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 203\u2013209</ref> Supporters of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] also felt the rebellion was a betrayal of their party.<ref>\"The loyalists spoke with an air of contempt, 'the troops will settle the matter in an hour or two, these pro-Germans will run away...' The Redmondites were more bitter, 'I hope they'll all be hanged' ... 'Shooting's too good for them.

The Volunteers shot and clubbed a number of civilians who assaulted them or tried to dismantle their barricades.<ref>Fearghal McGarry, ''The Rising: Ireland Easter 1916'', p. 143</ref>\n\nThat the Rising resulted in a great deal of death and destruction, as well as disrupting food supplies, also contributed to the antagonism toward the rebels. After the surrender, the Volunteers were hissed at, pelted with refuse, and denounced as \"murderers\" and \"starvers of the people\".<ref>McGarry, p. 252</ref> Volunteer Robert Holland for example remembered being \"subjected to very ugly remarks and cat-calls from the poorer classes\" as they marched to surrender. He also reported being abused by people he knew as he was marched through the [[Kilmainham]] area into captivity and said the British troops saved them from being manhandled by the crowd.<ref>Ryan, p. 135</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0280.pdf|title = Witness statement of Robert Holland|website = Bureau of Military History|accessdate= 14 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Waiting on Westland Row (8505718647).jpg|thumb|Crowds in Dublin waiting to welcome republican prisoners released in 1917]]\nHowever, some Dubliners expressed support for the rebels.<ref name=\"mcgarry252-256\">McGarry, pp. 252\u2013256</ref> Canadian journalist and writer Frederick Arthur McKenzie wrote that in poorer areas, \"there was a vast amount of sympathy with the rebels, particularly after the rebels were defeated\".<ref>Ellis, pp. 196\u2013197</ref> He wrote of crowds cheering a column of rebel prisoners as it passed, with one woman remarking \"Shure, we cheer them.

Dublin businessman and [[Quaker]] [[James G. Douglas]], for example, hitherto a Home Ruler, wrote that his political outlook changed radically during the course of the Rising because of the British military occupation of the city and that he became convinced that parliamentary methods would not be enough to remove the British presence.<ref>{{cite book|editor=J.

He would also go on to write ''lament for [[Thomas MacDonagh]]'' for his fallen friend and fellow Irish Volunteer. A few months after the Easter Rising, [[W. B. Yeats]] commemorated some of the fallen figures of the Irish Republican movement, as well as his torn emotions regarding these events, in the poem ''[[Easter, 1916]]''.\n\nSome of the survivors of the Rising went on to become leaders of the independent Irish state. Those who were executed were venerated by many as [[Martyr (politics)|martyrs]]; their graves in Dublin's former military prison of [[Arbour Hill Prison|Arbour Hill]] became a national monument and the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|Proclamation]] text was taught in schools. An annual commemorative military parade was held each year on Easter Sunday. In 1935, [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] unveiled a statue of the mythical Irish hero [[C\u00fa Chulainn]], sculpted by [[Oliver Sheppard]], at the [[General Post Office, Dublin|General Post Office]] as part of the Rising commemorations that year \u2013 it is often seen to be an important symbol of martyrdom in remembrance of the 1916 rebels. Memorials to the heroes of the Rising are to be found in other Irish cities, such as [[1916 Memorial, Limerick|Limerick]].\n\nThe parades culminated in a huge national celebration on the 50th anniversary of the Rising in 1966.<ref>{{cite web| place=IE|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/ll/ll_t06_other_a.html|website=RT\u00c9|year=1966|title=News Items Relating to the 1916 Easter Rising Commemorations}}</ref> Medals were issued by the government to survivors who took part in the rising at the event.

It was valued at [[Ten shilling coin|10 shillings]], therefore having the highest denomination of any pre-decimal coin issued by the country. The coin featured a bust of [[Patrick Pearse]] on the obverse and an image of the statue of [[C\u00fa Chulainn]] in the [[General Post Office, Dublin|GPO]] on the reverse. Its edge inscription reads, \"\u00c9ir\u00ed Amach na C\u00e1sca 1916\", which translates to, \"1916 Easter Rising\".

The [[Government of the 20th D\u00e1il|coalition government]] of 1973\u201377, in particular the [[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs]], [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]], began to promote the view that the violence of 1916 was essentially no different from the violence then taking place in the streets of Belfast and Derry. O'Brien and others asserted that the Rising was doomed to military defeat from the outset, and that it failed to account for the determination of [[Unionism in Ireland|Ulster Unionists]] to remain in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book|last=O\u2019Brien|first=Conor Cruise|title=States of Ireland |publisher=Hutchinson |year=1972 |isbn=0-09-113100-6 |pages=88, 99{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>\n\nIrish republicans continue to venerate the Rising and its leaders with murals in republican areas of Belfast and other towns celebrating the actions of Pearse and his comrades, and annual parades in remembrance of the Rising. The Irish government, however, discontinued its annual parade in Dublin in the early 1970s, and in 1976 it took the unprecedented step of proscribing (under the [[Offences against the State Acts 1939\u20131998|Offences against the State Act]]) a 1916 commemoration ceremony at the GPO organised by Sinn F\u00e9in and the Republican Commemoration Committee.<ref>Irish Times, 22 April 1976</ref> A [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]], [[David Thornley]], embarrassed the government (of which Labour was a member) by appearing on the platform at the ceremony, along with [[M\u00e1ire Comerford]], who had fought in the Rising, and [[Fiona Plunkett]], sister of Joseph Plunkett.<ref>Irish Times, 26 April 1976</ref>\n\nWith the advent of a [[Provisional IRA]] ceasefire and the beginning of what became known as the [[Northern Ireland peace process|Peace Process]] during the 1990s, the government's view of the Rising grew more positive and in 1996 an 80th anniversary commemoration at the [[Garden of Remembrance (Dublin)|Garden of Remembrance]] in Dublin was attended by the [[Taoiseach]] and leader of [[Fine Gael]], [[John Bruton]].<ref>[http://www.village.ie/Ireland/Feature/Reconstructing_the_Easter_Rising/ Reconstructing the Easter Rising], Colin Murphy, ''The Village'', 16 February 2006</ref> In 2005, the Taoiseach, [[Bertie Ahern]], announced the government's intention to resume the military parade past the GPO from Easter 2006, and to form a committee to plan centenary celebrations in 2016.<ref>Irish Times, 22 October 2005</ref> The 90th anniversary was celebrated with a military parade in Dublin on Easter Sunday, 2006, attended by the President of Ireland, the Taoiseach and the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/4914362.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|title=In pictures: Easter Rising commemorations|date=16 April 2006|accessdate=29 March 2010}}</ref> There is now an annual ceremony at Easter attended by relatives of those who fought, by the President, the Taoiseach, ministers, senators and TDs, and by usually large and respectful crowds.\n\nThe Rising continues to attract debate and analysis.

as the '''Easter Rebellion''', was an armed [[Rebellion|insurrection]] in [[Ireland]] during [[Easter Week]], April 1916. The Rising was launched by [[Irish republicanism|Irish republicans]] to end British rule in Ireland and establish an independent [[Irish Republic]] while the United Kingdom was fighting the [[First World War]]. It was the most significant [[List of Irish uprisings|uprising in Ireland]] since the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion of 1798]] and the first armed action of the [[Irish revolutionary period]]. Sixteen of the Rising's leaders were executed in May 1916, but the insurrection, the nature of the executions, and subsequent political developments ultimately contributed to an increase in popular support for Irish independence.\n\nOrganised by a seven-man Military Council of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]], the Rising began on Easter Monday, 24 April 1916 and lasted for six days.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=_RhCAAAAIAAJ&dq=%22military+council%22+irb&q=%22military+council%22+&pgis=1#search_anchor ''Leaders and Men of the Easter Rising: Dublin 1916''] Francis X. Martin 1967 p105</ref> Members of the [[Irish Volunteers]], led by schoolmaster and Irish language activist [[Patrick Pearse]], joined by the smaller [[Irish Citizen Army]] of [[James Connolly]] and 200 women of [[Cumann na mBan]], seized strategically important buildings in [[Dublin]] and [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|proclaimed an Irish Republic]]. The [[British Army]] brought in thousands of reinforcements as well as artillery and a gunboat. There was street fighting on the routes into the city centre, where the rebels slowed the British advance and inflicted many casualties. Elsewhere in Dublin, the fighting mainly consisted of sniping and long-range gun battles. The main rebel positions were gradually surrounded and bombarded with artillery. There were isolated actions in other parts of Ireland; Volunteer leader [[Eoin MacNeill]] had issued a countermand in a bid to halt the Rising, which greatly reduced the number of rebels who mobilised.\n\nWith much greater numbers and heavier weapons, the British Army suppressed the Rising. Pearse agreed to an unconditional surrender on Saturday 29 April, although sporadic fighting continued briefly. After the surrender the country remained under [[martial law]]. About 3,500 people were taken prisoner by the British and 1,800 of them were sent to internment camps or prisons in Britain. Most of the leaders of the Rising were executed following courts-martial. The Rising brought [[Physical force Irish republicanism|physical force republicanism]] back to the forefront of Irish politics, which for nearly fifty years had been dominated by constitutional nationalism. Opposition to the British reaction to the Rising contributed to changes in public opinion and the move toward independence, as shown in the [[1918 Irish general election|December 1918 election]] which was won by the [[Sinn F\u00e9in]] party, which convened the [[First D\u00e1il]] and declared independence.\n\nOf the 485 people killed in the Easter Rising: 54 percent were civilians, 30 percent were British military and police and 16 percent were Irish rebels. More than 2,600 were wounded. Many of the civilians were killed or wounded by British artillery and machine guns or were mistaken for rebels. Others were caught in the crossfire in the crowded city. The shelling and resulting fires left parts of central Dublin in ruins.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Irish Citizen Army Group Liberty Hall Dublin 1914.jpg|thumb|Members of the Irish Citizen Army outside [[Liberty Hall]], under the slogan \"We serve neither [[George V|King]] nor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser]], but Ireland\"]]\nThe [[Acts of Union 1800]] united the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] as the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], abolishing the [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] and giving Ireland representation in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]].

In 1886, the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP) under [[Charles Stewart Parnell]] succeeded in having the [[Irish Government Bill 1886|First Home Rule Bill]] introduced in the British parliament, but it was defeated. The [[Irish Government Bill 1893|Second Home Rule Bill]] of 1893 was passed by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] but rejected by the [[House of Lords]].\n\nAfter the fall of Parnell, younger and more radical nationalists became disillusioned with parliamentary politics and turned toward more extreme forms of separatism. The [[Gaelic Athletic Association]], the [[Conradh na Gaeilge|Gaelic League]] and the [[Gaelic revival|cultural revival]] under [[W. B. Yeats]] and [[Lady Augusta Gregory]], together with the new political thinking of [[Arthur Griffith]] expressed in his newspaper ''[[Sinn F\u00e9in Printing & Publishing Company|Sinn F\u00e9in]]'' and organisations such as the National Council and the Sinn F\u00e9in League, led many Irish people to identify with the idea of an independent [[Gaels|Gaelic]] Ireland.<ref>MacDonagh, Oliver, pp. 72\u201374</ref><ref>Feeney, p. 22</ref> This was sometimes referred to by the generic term ''Sinn F\u00e9in''.<ref>Feeney, p. 37</ref>\n\nThe [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|Third Home Rule Bill]] was introduced by British Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] in 1912. [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionists]], who were Protestant, opposed it, as they did not want to be ruled by a Catholic-dominated Irish government. Led by [[Edward Carson, Baron Carson|Sir Edward Carson]] and [[James Craig, 1st Viscount Craigavon|James Craig]], they formed the [[Ulster Volunteers]] (UVF) in January 1913.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nli.ie/1916/exhibition/en/content/stagesetters/index.pdf|title=Those who set the stage|work=The 1916 Rising: Personalities and Perspectives|publisher=National Library of Ireland|accessdate=7 December 2009}}</ref> In response, Irish nationalists formed a rival paramilitary group, the [[Irish Volunteers]], in November 1913. The [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] (IRB) was a driving force behind the Irish Volunteers and attempted to control it. Its leader was [[Eoin MacNeill]], who was not an IRB member.<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 7\u20138</ref> The Irish Volunteers' stated goal was \"to secure and to maintain the rights and liberties common to all the people of Ireland\". It included people with a range of political views, and was open to \"all able-bodied Irishmen without distinction of creed, politics or social group\".<ref>Macardle, pp. 90\u201392</ref> Another militant group, the [[Irish Citizen Army]], was formed by trade unionists as a result of the [[Dublin Lock-out]] of that year.<ref>Townshend, p. 49</ref> When the Irish Volunteers [[Howth gun-running|smuggled rifles into Dublin]], the British Army attempted to stop them and fired into a crowd of civilians. British Army officers then [[Curragh incident|threatened to resign]] if they were ordered to take action against the UVF. By 1914, Ireland seemed to be on the brink of a civil war.<ref>Collins, M.E.. ''Sovereignty and partition, 1912\u20131949''. Edco Publishing, 2004. pp. 32\u201333</ref> The crisis was ended in August that year by the outbreak of World War I<ref>Townshend, pp. 59\u201360</ref> and [[Ireland and World War I|Ireland's involvement]] in it. The Home Rule Bill was enacted, but its implementation was postponed by a [[Suspensory Act 1914|suspensory act]] until the end of the war.\n\n==Planning the Rising==\n[[File:Casement Roger.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Roger Casement]], who attempted to smuggle weapons from Germany for the Rising]]\nThe Supreme Council of the IRB met on 5 September 1914, just over a month after the British government had declared war on [[German Empire|Germany]]. At this meeting, they decided to stage an uprising before the war ended and to secure help from Germany.<ref>Caulfield, Max, p. 18</ref> Responsibility for the planning of the rising was given to [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]] and [[Se\u00e1n Mac Diarmada|Se\u00e1n MacDermott (''Mac Diarmada'')]].<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 16</ref> The Irish Volunteers\u2014the smaller of the two forces resulting from the September 1914 split over support for the British war effort<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 13</ref>\u2014set up a \"headquarters staff\" that included [[Patrick Pearse]]<ref>Sean Farrell Moran, ''Patrick Pearse and the Politics of Redemption: The Mind of the Easter Rising'', (1994), Ruth Dudley Edwards, ''Patrick Pearse and the Triumph of Failure'', (1977), Joost Augustin, ''Patrick Pearse', (2009)</ref> as Director of Military Organisation, [[Joseph Plunkett]] as Director of Military Operations and [[Thomas MacDonagh]] as Director of Training. [[\u00c9amonn Ceannt]] was later added as Director of Communications.<ref>Townshend, p. 92</ref>\n\nIn May 1915, Clarke and MacDermott established a Military Committee or Military Council within the IRB, consisting of Pearse, Plunkett and Ceannt, to draw up plans for a rising.<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 16, 19</ref> Clarke and MacDermott joined it shortly after. The Military Council was able to promote its own policies and personnel independently of both the Volunteer Executive and the IRB Executive. Although the Volunteer and IRB leaders were not against a rising in principle, they were of the opinion that it was not opportune at that moment.<ref>McGarry, p. 116</ref> Volunteer Chief-of-Staff [[Eoin MacNeill]] supported a rising only if the British government attempted to suppress the Volunteers or introduce conscription, and if such a rising had some chance of success. IRB President [[Denis McCullough]] and prominent IRB member [[Bulmer Hobson]] held similar views.<ref>Townshend, p. 94</ref> The Military Council kept its plans secret, so as to prevent the British authorities learning of the plans, and to thwart those within the organisation who might try to stop the rising. IRB members held officer rank in the Volunteers throughout the country and took their orders from the Military Council, not from MacNeill.<ref>Macardle, p. 119</ref>\n\nShortly after the outbreak of World War I, [[Roger Casement]] and [[Clan na Gael]] leader [[John Devoy]] met the German ambassador to the United States, [[Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff]], to discuss German backing for an uprising. Casement went to Germany and began negotiations with the German government and military. He persuaded the Germans to announce their support for Irish independence in November 1914.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 25</ref> Casement also attempted to recruit an [[Irish Brigade (World War I)|Irish Brigade]], made up of Irish [[World War I prisoners of war in Germany|prisoners of war]], which would be armed and sent to Ireland to join the uprising.<ref>Townshend, p. 104</ref><ref>Foy and Barton, p. 105</ref> However, only 56 men volunteered. Plunkett joined Casement in Germany the following year. Together, Plunkett and Casement presented a plan (the 'Ireland Report') in which a German [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] would land on the west coast of Ireland, while a rising in Dublin diverted the British forces so that the Germans, with the help of local Volunteers, could secure the line of the [[River Shannon]], before advancing on the capital.<ref>McNally and Dennis, p. 30</ref> The German military rejected the plan, but agreed to ship arms and ammunition to the Volunteers.<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 25\u201328</ref>\n\n[[James Connolly]]\u2014head of the [[Irish Citizen Army]] (ICA), a group of armed socialist trade union men and women\u2014was unaware of the IRB's plans, and threatened to start a rebellion on his own if other parties failed to act. If they had done it alone, the IRB and the Volunteers would possibly have come to their aid;<ref>[[Eoin Neeson]], ''Myths from Easter 1916'', p. ?</ref> however, the IRB leaders met with Connolly in January 1916 and convinced him to join forces with them. They agreed that they would launch a rising together at Easter and made Connolly the sixth member of the Military Council. [[Thomas MacDonagh]] would later become the seventh and final member.\n\nThe death of the old [[Fenian]] leader [[Jeremiah O'Donovan Rossa]] in [[New York City|New York]] in August 1915 was an opportunity to mount a spectacular demonstration. His body was sent to Ireland for burial in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]], with the Volunteers in charge of arrangements. Huge crowds lined the route and gathered at the graveside. Pearse made a dramatic funeral oration, a rallying call to republicans, which ended with the words \"[[Ireland unfree shall never be at peace]]\".<ref>Kennedy, pp. 199\u2013200</ref>\n\n==Build-up to Easter Week==\n[[File:Signatories of the Proclamation of the Republic.png|thumb|The signatories of the Proclamation: Tom Clarke, Se\u00e1n MacDiarmada, Thomas MacDonagh, Patrick Pearse, \u00c9amonn Ceannt, James Connolly, Joseph Plunkett]]\nIn early April, Pearse issued orders to the Irish Volunteers for three days of \"parades and manoeuvres\" beginning on Easter Sunday. He had the authority to do this, as the Volunteers' Director of Organisation. The idea was that IRB members within the organisation would know these were orders to begin the rising, while men such as MacNeill and the British authorities would take it at face value.\n\nOn 9 April, the [[Imperial German Navy|German Navy]] dispatched the [[SS Libau]] for [[County Kerry]], disguised as the Norwegian ship ''Aud''.<ref>Caulfield, Max, p. 29</ref> It was loaded with 20,000 rifles, one million rounds of ammunition, and explosives. Casement also left for Ireland aboard the German submarine ''[[SM U-19 (Germany)|U-19]]''. He was disappointed with the level of support offered by the Germans and he intended to stop or at least postpone the rising.<ref>Foy and Barton, p.56</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday 19 April, Alderman [[Thomas Kelly (Sinn F\u00e9in politician)|Tom Kelly]], a Sinn F\u00e9in member of Dublin Corporation, read out at a meeting of the Corporation a document purportedly leaked from Dublin Castle, detailing plans by the British authorities to shortly arrest leaders of the Irish Volunteers, Sinn F\u00e9in and the Gaelic League, and occupy their premises.<ref>Townshend, pp. 131\u2013132</ref> Although the British authorities said the \"Castle Document\" was fake, MacNeill ordered the Volunteers to prepare to resist.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 47</ref> Unbeknownst to MacNeill, the document had been [[Forgery|forged]] by the Military Council to persuade moderates of the need for their planned uprising. It was an edited version of a real document outlining British plans in the event of conscription.<ref>McGarry, p. 117</ref> That same day, the Military Council informed senior Volunteer officers that the rising would begin on Easter Sunday. However, it chose not to inform the rank-and-file, or moderates such as MacNeill, until the last minute.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 48</ref>\n\nThe following day, MacNeill got wind that a rising was about to be launched and threatened to do everything he could to prevent it, short of informing the British.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 52</ref> MacNeill was briefly persuaded to go along with some sort of action when Mac Diarmada revealed to him that a German arms shipment was about to land in [[County Kerry]]. MacNeill believed that when the British learned of the shipment they would immediately suppress the Volunteers, thus the Volunteers would be justified in taking defensive action, including the planned manoeuvres.<ref>Michael Tierney, ''Eoin MacNeill'', pp. 199, 214</ref>\n\nThe ''Aud'' and the ''U-19'' reached the coast of Kerry on Good Friday, 21 April. This was earlier than the Volunteers expected and so none were there to meet the vessels. The [[Royal Navy]] had known about the arms shipment and intercepted the ''Aud'', prompting the captain to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] the ship. Furthermore, Casement was captured shortly after he landed at [[Banna Strand]].<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 57\u201358</ref>\n\nWhen MacNeill learned from Vol. [[Patrick Whelan]] that the arms shipment had been lost, he reverted to his original position. With the support of other leaders of like mind, notably Bulmer Hobson and [[The O'Rahilly]], he issued a countermand to all Volunteers, cancelling all actions for Sunday. This countermanding order was relayed to Volunteer officers and printed in the Sunday morning newspapers. It succeeded only in delaying the rising for a day, although it greatly reduced the number of Volunteers who turned out.\n\n[[Naval Intelligence Division|British Naval Intelligence]] had been aware of the arms shipment, Casement's return, and the Easter date for the rising through radio messages between Germany and its embassy in the United States that were intercepted by the Royal Navy and deciphered in [[Room 40]] of the Admiralty.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, p. 138</ref> The information was passed to the [[Under-Secretary for Ireland]], Sir [[Matthew Nathan]], on 17 April, but without revealing its source, and Nathan was doubtful about its accuracy.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, p. 79</ref> When news reached Dublin of the capture of the ''Aud'' and the arrest of Casement, Nathan conferred with the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], [[Ivor Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne|Lord Wimborne]]. Nathan proposed to raid [[Liberty Hall]], headquarters of the Citizen Army, and Volunteer properties at Father Matthew Park and at [[Kimmage]], but Wimborne insisted on wholesale arrests of the leaders. It was decided to postpone action until after Easter Monday, and in the meantime Nathan telegraphed the [[Chief Secretary for Ireland|Chief Secretary]], [[Augustine Birrell]], in London seeking his approval.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, pp. 81\u201387</ref> By the time Birrell cabled his reply authorising the action, at noon on Monday 24 April 1916, the Rising had already begun.<ref>\u00d3 Broin, p. 88</ref>\n\nOn the morning of Easter Sunday, 23 April, the Military Council met at Liberty Hall to discuss what to do in light of MacNeill's countermanding order. They decided that the Rising would go ahead the following day, Easter Monday, and that the Irish Volunteers and Irish Citizen Army would go into action as the 'Army of the Irish Republic'. They elected Pearse as president of the Irish Republic, and also as Commander-in-Chief of the army; Connolly became Commandant of the Dublin Brigade.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 66</ref> Messengers were then sent to all units informing them of the new orders.<ref name=\"rte-timeline\">[http://www.rte.ie/centuryireland/index.php/articles/chronology-of-the-easter-rising Chronology of the Easter Rising].

This was due to MacNeill's countermanding order, and the fact that the new orders had been sent so soon beforehand. However, several hundred Volunteers joined the Rising after it began.<ref name=\"McGarry, p. 129\">McGarry, p. 129</ref>\n\nShortly before midday, the rebels began to seize important sites in central Dublin. The rebels' plan was to hold Dublin city centre. This was a large, oval-shaped area bounded by two canals: the [[Grand Canal (Ireland)|Grand]] to the south and the [[Royal Canal|Royal]] to the north, with the [[River Liffey]] running through the middle. On the southern and western edges of this district were five British Army barracks. Most of the rebels' positions had been chosen to defend against counter-attacks from these barracks.<ref>Dorney, John. ''The Story of the Easter Rising, 1916''. Green Lamp, 2010. p. 33</ref> The rebels took the positions with ease. Civilians were evacuated and policemen were ejected or taken prisoner.<ref>McGarry, p. 133</ref> Windows and doors were barricaded, food and supplies were secured, and first aid posts were set up. Barricades were erected on the streets to hinder British Army movement.<ref>McGarry, p. 135</ref>\n\nA joint force of about 400 Volunteers and Citizen Army gathered at Liberty Hall under the command of Commandant James Connolly. This was the headquarters battalion, and it also included Commander-in-Chief Patrick Pearse, as well as [[Tom Clarke (Irish republican)|Tom Clarke]], [[Se\u00e1n Mac Diarmada|Se\u00e1n MacDermott]] and [[Joseph Mary Plunkett|Joseph Plunkett]].<ref>McNally and Dennis, p. 41</ref> They marched to the [[General Post Office, Dublin|General Post Office]] (GPO) on [[O'Connell Street]], Dublin's main thoroughfare, occupied the building and hoisted two republican flags.

Volunteers from the GPO also occupied other buildings on the street, including buildings overlooking [[O'Connell Bridge]]. They took over a [[Wireless telegraphy|wireless telegraph]] station and sent out a [[Radio broadcasting|radio broadcast]] in [[Morse code]], announcing that an Irish Republic had been declared. This was the first radio broadcast in Ireland.<ref>McGee, John.

The 1st battalion, under [[Edward Daly (Irish revolutionary)|Edward 'Ned' Daly]], occupied the [[Four Courts]] and surrounding buildings, while a company under [[Se\u00e1n Heuston]] occupied the [[Mendicity Institution]], across the River Liffey from the Four Courts. The 2nd battalion, under [[Thomas MacDonagh]], occupied [[Jacob's]] biscuit factory. The 3rd battalion, under [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], occupied [[Boland's Mill]] and surrounding buildings. The 4th battalion, under [[\u00c9amonn Ceannt]], occupied the [[House of Industry (Dublin)|South Dublin Union]] and the distillery on [[Marrowbone Lane]]. From each of these garrisons, small units of rebels established [[Outpost (military)|outposts]] in the surrounding area.<ref>McNally and Dennis, pp. 39\u201340</ref>\n\nThe rebels also attempted to cut transport and communication links. As well as erecting roadblocks, they took control of various bridges and cut telephone and telegraph wires. [[Dublin Pearse railway station|Westland Row]] and [[Harcourt Street railway station|Harcourt Street]] railway stations were occupied, though the latter only briefly. The railway line was cut at [[Fairview, Dublin|Fairview]] and the line was damaged by bombs at [[Dublin Connolly railway station|Amiens Street]], [[Dublin Broadstone railway station|Broadstone]], [[Dublin Heuston railway station|Kingsbridge]] and [[Lansdowne Road railway station|Lansdowne Road]].<ref>McKenna, Joseph.

The goal was to seize weapons and blow up the ammunition store to signal that the Rising had begun. They seized weapons and planted explosives, but the blast was not big enough to be heard across the city.<ref>Caulfield, Max, pp. 48\u201350</ref> The 23-year-old son of the fort's commander was fatally shot when he ran to raise the alarm.<ref>[http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/children-of-the-revolution/ \"Children of the Revolution\"].

The rebels overpowered the soldiers in the guardroom, but failed to press further. The British Army's chief intelligence officer, Major Ivon Price, fired on the rebels while the [[Under-Secretary for Ireland]], Sir [[Matthew Nathan]], helped shut the castle gates. Unbeknownst to the rebels, the Castle was lightly guarded and could have been taken with ease.<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 84\u201385</ref> The rebels instead laid siege to the Castle from City Hall. Fierce fighting erupted there after British reinforcements arrived. The rebels on the roof exchanged fire with soldiers on the street. Se\u00e1n Connolly was shot dead by a sniper, becoming the first rebel casualty.<ref name=\"rte-timeline\"/> By the following morning, British forces had re-captured City Hall and taken the rebels prisoner.<ref name=\"rte-timeline\"/>\n\nThe rebels did not attempt to take some other key locations, notably [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], in the heart of the city centre and defended by only a handful of armed unionist students.<ref>Townshend, pp. 163\u2013164</ref> Failure to capture the telephone exchange in Crown Alley left communications in the hands of Government with GPO staff quickly repairing telephone wires that had been cut by the rebels.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Business as Usual \u2013 GPO Staff in 1916|last=Ferguson|first=Stephen|publisher=Mercier Press|year=2012|isbn=9781856359948|pages=60}}</ref> The failure to occupy strategic locations was attributed to lack of manpower.<ref name=\"McGarry, p. 129\" /> In at least two incidents, at Jacob's<ref>McGarry p. 142</ref> and Stephen's Green,<ref>Stephens p. 18</ref> the Volunteers and Citizen Army shot dead civilians trying to attack them or dismantle their barricades. Elsewhere, they hit civilians with their rifle butts to drive them off.<ref>McGarry, pp. 142\u2013143; Townshend, p. 174</ref>\n\nThe British military were caught totally unprepared by the rebellion and their response of the first day was generally un-coordinated. Two troops of British cavalry were sent to investigate what was happening. They took fire and casualties from rebel forces at the GPO and at the Four Courts.<ref>Caulfield, Max, pp. 54\u201355</ref><ref name=\"Coffey, Thomas M. pp. 38, 44\">Coffey, Thomas M.

The cavalrymen retreated and were withdrawn to barracks. On Mount Street, a group of [[Volunteer Training Corps (World War I)|Volunteer Training Corps]] men stumbled upon the rebel position and four were killed before they reached [[Beggars Bush Barracks]].<ref>O'Brien, ''Blood on the Streets, the Battle for Mount Street'', pp. 22\u201323</ref>\n\nThe only substantial combat of the first day of the Rising took place at the South Dublin Union where a piquet from the [[Royal Irish Regiment (1684\u20131922)|Royal Irish Regiment]] encountered an outpost of \u00c9amonn Ceannt's force at the northwestern corner of the South Dublin Union. The British troops, after taking some casualties, managed to regroup and launch several assaults on the position before they forced their way inside and the small rebel force in the tin huts at the eastern end of the Union surrendered.<ref>Caulfield, Max, pp. 76\u201380</ref> However, the Union complex as a whole remained in rebel hands. A nurse in uniform, Margaret Keogh, was shot dead by British soldiers at the Union. She is believed to have been the first civilian killed in the Rising.<ref>[http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/1916/the-victims/nurse-margaret-keogh-the-first-civilian-fatality-of-the-rising-34510459.html \"Nurse Margaret Keogh, the first civilian fatality of the Rising\"].

Partly as a result of the police withdrawal, a wave of looting broke out in the city centre, especially in the area of O'Connell Street (still officially called \"Sackville Street\" at the time).<ref name=\"looting\">Townshend, pp. 263\u2013264</ref> \n\n===Tuesday and Wednesday===\n[[File:Ire-1916-Dublin.jpg|thumb|British armoured truck, hastily built from the [[smokebox]]es of several steam locomotives at [[Inchicore]] railway works.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/easterrising/witnesses/wh02.shtml|title=Statement by Joseph Sweeney Curious Journey: An Oral History of Ireland's Unfinished Revolution|publisher=BBC| accessdate=18 October 2009}}</ref>]]\n[[File:In gpo rising.jpg|thumb|Volunteers and Irish Citizens Army members inside the General Post Office, 25 April 1916.]]\n\n[[Ivor Guest, 1st Viscount Wimborne|Lord Wimborne]], the Lord Lieutenant, declared [[martial law]] on Tuesday evening and handed over civil power to Brigadier-General [[William Lowe (British Army officer)|William Lowe]]. British forces initially put their efforts into securing the approaches to Dublin Castle and isolating the rebel headquarters, which they believed was in [[Liberty Hall]]. The British commander, Lowe, worked slowly, unsure of the size of the force he was up against, and with only 1,269 troops in the city when he arrived from the [[Curragh Camp]] in the early hours of Tuesday 25 April. City Hall was taken from the rebel unit that had attacked Dublin Castle on Tuesday morning.<ref>Coogan 2001, p. 107</ref><ref name=\"Townshend p191\">Townshend, p. 191</ref>\n\nIn the early hours of Tuesday, 120 British soldiers, with machine-guns, occupied two buildings overlooking St Stephen's Green: the [[Shelbourne Hotel]] and United Services Club.<ref>Caulfield, p. 122</ref> At dawn they opened fire on the Citizen Army occupying the green. The rebels returned fire, but were forced to retreat to the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland|Royal College of Surgeons]] building. They remained there for the rest of the week, exchanging fire with British forces.<ref name=\"rte-timeline\"/>\n\nFighting erupted along the northern edge of the city centre on Tuesday afternoon. In the northeast, British troops left Amiens Street railway station in an armoured train, to secure and repair a section of damaged tracks. They were attacked by rebels who had taken up position at [[Annesley Bridge]]. After a two-hour battle, the British were forced to retreat and several soldiers were captured.<ref name=caulfield145>Caulfield, pp. 145\u2013146</ref> At [[Phibsborough]], in the northwest, rebels had occupied buildings and erected barricades at junctions on the North Circular Road. The British summoned [[Ordnance QF 18-pounder|18-pounder field artillery]] from [[Athlone]] and shelled the rebel positions, destroying the barricades. After a fierce firefight, the rebels withdrew.<ref name=caulfield145/>\n\nThat afternoon Pearse walked out into O'Connell Street with a small escort and stood in front of Nelson's Pillar. As a large crowd gathered, he read out a '[[s:Manifesto to the Citizens of Dublin, 25 April 1916|manifesto to the citizens of Dublin]],' calling on them to support the Rising.<ref>Foy and Barton, p. 180</ref>\n\nThe rebels had failed to take either of Dublin's two main railway stations or either of its ports, at Dublin Port and [[D\u00fan Laoghaire|Kingstown]]. As a result, during the following week, the British were able to bring in thousands of reinforcements from Britain and from their garrisons at [[the Curragh]] and [[Belfast]]. By the end of the week, British strength stood at over 16,000 men.<ref name=\"Townshend p191\"/><ref>McGarry, pp. 167\u2013169</ref> Their firepower was provided by field artillery which they positioned on the [[Northside, Dublin|Northside]] of the city at Phibsborough and at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], and by the patrol vessel ''[[Irish patrol vessel Muirch\u00fa|Helga]]'', which sailed up the [[River Liffey|Liffey]], having been summoned from the port at Kingstown. On Wednesday, 26 April, the guns at Trinity College and ''Helga'' shelled Liberty Hall, and the Trinity College guns then began firing at rebel positions, first at Boland's Mill and then in O'Connell Street.<ref name=\"Townshend p191\"/> Some rebel commanders, particularly James Connolly, did not believe that the British would shell the '[[Second city of the United Kingdom|second city]]' of the British Empire.<ref>McGarry, p. 192</ref><ref>Foy and Barton, p. 181</ref>\n\n[[File:Osteraufstand - Dublin - britisches Milit\u00e4r.jpg|thumb|left|British soldiers in position behind a stack of barrels during the Rising in Dublin]]\nThe principal rebel positions at the GPO, the Four Courts, Jacob's Factory and Boland's Mill saw little action. The British surrounded and bombarded them rather than assault them directly. One Volunteer in the GPO recalled, \"we did practically no shooting as there was no target\".<ref>McGarry, p. 175</ref> However, where the insurgents dominated the routes by which the British tried to funnel reinforcements into the city, there was fierce fighting.\n\nAt 5:25PM Volunteers [[Eamon Martin (Irish Republican)|Eamon Martin]], Garry Holohan, Robert Beggs, Sean Cody, Dinny O'Callaghan, Charles Shelley, Peadar Breslin and five others attempted to occupy Broadstone railway station on Church Street, the attack was unsuccessful and Martin was injured.<ref name=\"rte-timeline\"/><ref>Witness Statement by Eamon Martin to Bureau of Military History, 1951</ref><ref>Witness Statement of Sean Cody to Bureau of Military History, 1954</ref><ref>Witness Statement of Nicholas Kaftan to Bureau of Military History</ref><ref>Witness Statement of Charles Shelley to Bureau of Military History, 1953</ref>\n\nOn Wednesday morning, hundreds of British troops encircled the Mendicity Institute, which was occupied by 26 Volunteers under Se\u00e1n Heuston. British troops advanced on the building, supported by snipers and machine gun fire, but the Volunteers put up stiff resistance. Eventually, the troops got close enough to hurl grenades into the building, some of which the rebels threw back. Exhausted and almost out of ammunition, Heuston's men became the first rebel position to surrender. Heuston had been ordered to hold his position for a few hours, to delay the British, but had held on for three days.<ref>O'Brien, Paul.

The Irish Story. 15 August 2012.</ref>\n\nReinforcements were sent to Dublin from Britain, and disembarked at Kingstown on the morning of Wednesday 26 April. Heavy fighting occurred at the rebel-held positions around the [[Grand Canal of Ireland|Grand Canal]] as these troops advanced towards Dublin. More than 1,000 [[Sherwood Foresters]] were repeatedly caught in a cross-fire trying to cross the canal at Mount Street Bridge. Seventeen Volunteers were able to severely disrupt the British advance, killing or wounding 240 men.<ref>Coogan {{which|date=September 2016}}, p. 122</ref> Despite there being alternative routes across the canal nearby, General Lowe ordered repeated frontal assaults on the Mount Street position.<ref>Caulfield, p. 196</ref> The British eventually took the position, which had not been reinforced by the nearby rebel garrison at Boland's Mills, on Thursday,<ref>O'Brien, p. 69</ref> but the fighting there inflicted up to two-thirds of their casualties for the entire week for a cost of just four dead Volunteers.<ref>McGarry, p. 173</ref> It had taken nearly nine hours for the British to advance {{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"rte-timeline\"/>\n\nOn Wednesday [[Linenhall Barracks]] on [[Constitution Hill, Dublin|Constitution Hill]] was burnt down under the orders of Commandant Edward Daly to prevent its reoccupation by the British army.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.easter1916.ie/index.php/places/a-z/linenhall-barracks/ |title = Easter 1916}}</ref>\n\n===Thursday to Saturday===\nThe rebel position at the South Dublin Union (site of the present day [[St. James's Hospital]]) and Marrowbone Lane, further west along the canal, also inflicted heavy losses on British troops. The South Dublin Union was a large complex of buildings and there was vicious fighting around and inside the buildings. [[Cathal Brugha]], a rebel officer, distinguished himself in this action and was badly wounded. By the end of the week, the British had taken some of the buildings in the Union, but others remained in rebel hands.<ref>Caulfield, pp. 225\u2013228</ref> British troops also took casualties in unsuccessful frontal assaults on the Marrowbone Lane Distillery.<ref>Ryan, pp. 128\u2013133</ref>\n\n[[File:Birth of the Irish Republic.jpg|thumb|''Birth of the Irish Republic'' by [[Walter Paget]], depicting the GPO during the shelling]]\nThe third major scene of fighting during the week was in the area of North King Street, north of the Four Courts. The rebels had established strong outposts in the area, occupying numerous small buildings and barricading the streets. From Thursday to Saturday, the British made repeated attempts to take the area, in what was some of the fiercest fighting of the Rising. As the troops moved in, the rebels continually opened fire from windows and behind chimneys and barricades. At one point, a platoon led by Major Sheppard made a [[Charge (warfare)|bayonet charge]] on one of the barricades, but was cut down by rebel fire. The British employed machine guns and attempted to avoid direct fire by using makeshift armoured trucks, and by [[mouse-holing]] through the inside walls of terraced houses to get near the rebel positions.<ref>Dorney, John.

Connolly had been incapacitated by a bullet wound to the ankle and had passed command on to Pearse. [[The O'Rahilly]] was killed in a sortie from the GPO. They tunnelled through the walls of the neighbouring buildings in order to evacuate the Post Office without coming under fire and took up a new position in 16 [[Moore Street]].  The young [[Se\u00e1n McLoughlin (communist)|Se\u00e1n McLoughlin]] was given military command and planned a break out, but Pearse realised this plan would lead to further loss of civilian life.<ref name=\"commandant\">Charlie McGuire, \"[http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/sean-mcloughlin-the-boy-commandant-of-1916/ Se\u00e1n McLoughlin \u2013 the boy commandant of 1916]\", ''[[History Ireland]]'', Vol. 14, No. 2</ref>\n\nOn Saturday 29 April, from this new headquarters, Pearse issued an order for all companies to surrender.<ref>Townshend, pp. 243\u2013246</ref> Pearse [[Unconditional surrender|surrendered unconditionally]] to Brigadier-General Lowe.

In addition, because of the interception of the German arms aboard the ''Aud'', the provincial Volunteer units were very poorly armed.\n\nIn the south, around 1,200 Volunteers mustered in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], under [[Tom\u00e1s Mac Curtain]], on the Sunday, but they dispersed on Wednesday after receiving nine contradictory orders by dispatch from the Volunteer leadership in Dublin. At their Sheares Street headquarters, some of the Volunteers engaged in a standoff with British forces. Much to the anger of many Volunteers, MacCurtain, under pressure from Catholic clergy, agreed to surrender his men's arms to the British.<ref>Townshend, p. 235</ref> The only violence in Cork occurred when the RIC attempted to raid the home of the [[Kent family of Bawnard|Kent family]]. The Kent brothers, who were Volunteers, engaged in a three-hour firefight with the RIC. An RIC officer and one of the brothers were killed, while another brother was later executed.<ref>Townshend, p. 238</ref>\n\nIn the north, Volunteer companies were mobilised in [[County Tyrone]] at [[Coalisland]] (including 132 men from [[Belfast]] led by IRB President [[Dennis McCullough]]) and [[Carrickmore]], under the leadership of [[Patrick McCartan]]. They also mobilised at [[Creeslough]], [[County Donegal]] under Daniel Kelly and [[James McNulty (Irish activist)|James McNulty]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Donegal Awakening|last = O'Duibhir|first = Liam|publisher = Mercier Press|date = 2009|pages = 39, 45, 76, 104, 255, 289, 292}}</ref> However, in part because of the confusion caused by the countermanding order, the Volunteers in these locations dispersed without fighting.<ref>Townshend, p. 226</ref>\n\n===Fingal===\nIn [[Fingal]] (or north County Dublin), about 60 Volunteers mobilised near [[Swords, Dublin|Swords]]. They belonged to the 5th Battalion of the Dublin Brigade (also known as the Fingal Battalion), and were led by [[Thomas Ashe]] and his second in command, [[Richard Mulcahy]]. Unlike the rebels elsewhere, the Fingal Battalion successfully employed [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]]. They set up camp and Ashe split the battalion into four sections: three would undertake operations while the fourth was kept in reserve, guarding camp and foraging for food.<ref name=\"maguire-fingal\">Maguire, Paul.

The president of the courts-martial was [[Charles Blackader]]. Controversially, Maxwell decided that the courts-martial would be held in secret and without a defence, which Crown law officers later ruled to have been illegal.<ref name=foy294/> Some of those who conducted the trials had commanded British troops involved in suppressing the Rising, a conflict of interest that the Military Manual prohibited.<ref name=foy294/> Only one of those tried by courts-martial was a woman, [[Constance Markievicz]], who was also the only woman to be kept in solitary confinement.<ref name=foy294/> Ninety were sentenced to death. Fifteen of those (including all seven signatories of the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|Proclamation]]) had their sentences confirmed by Maxwell and fourteen were [[Execution by firing squad|executed by firing squad]] at [[Kilmainham Gaol]] between 3 and 12 May. Among them was the seriously wounded Connolly, who was shot while tied to a chair because of his shattered ankle. Maxwell stated that only the \"ringleaders\" and those proven to have committed \"coldblooded murder\" would be executed. However, the evidence presented was weak, and some of those executed were not leaders and did not kill anyone: [[Willie Pearse]] described himself as \"a personal attach\u00e9 to my brother, Patrick Pearse\"; [[John MacBride]] had not even been aware of the Rising until it began, but had fought against the British in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] fifteen years before; [[Thomas Kent]] did not come out at all\u2014he was executed for the killing of a police officer during the raid on his house the week after the Rising. The most prominent leader to escape execution was [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], Commandant of the 3rd Battalion, who did so partly because of his American birth.<ref name=\"Oxford\">{{Cite book |title=Oxford Companion to Irish History |author=S.

After the first three executions, [[John Redmond]], leader of the moderate [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], said in the British Parliament that the rising \"happily, seems to be over.

He said \"it is not murderers who are being executed; it is insurgents who have fought a clean fight, a brave fight, however misguided\".

Although they did not receive as much attention as the executions, they sparked outrage among the Irish public and were raised by Irish MPs in Parliament.\n\nOne incident was the 'Portobello killings'. On Tuesday 25 April, Dubliner [[Francis Sheehy-Skeffington]], a pacifist nationalist activist, had been arrested by British soldiers. Captain John Bowen-Colthurst then took him with a British raiding party as a hostage and [[human shield]]. On Rathmines Road he stopped a boy named James Coade, whom he shot dead. His troops then destroyed a tobacconist's shop with grenades and seized journalists Thomas Dickson and Patrick MacIntyre. The next morning, Colthurst had Skeffington and the two journalists shot by firing squad in [[Cathal Brugha Barracks|Portobello Barracks]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bacon|first1=Bryan|title=A Terrible Duty: the Madness of Captain Bowen-Colthurst|date=2015|publisher=Thena Press}}</ref> The bodies were then buried there. Later that day he shot a Labour Party councillor, [[Richard O'Carroll]]. When Major Sir [[Francis Vane]] learned of the killings he telephoned his superiors in Dublin Castle, but no action was taken. Vane informed [[Herbert Kitchener]], who told General [[John Maxwell (British Army officer)|Maxwell]] to arrest Colthurst, but Maxwell refused. Colthurst was eventually arrested and court-martialled in June. He was found guilty of murder but insane, and detained for twenty months at [[Broadmoor Hospital|Broadmoor]]. Public and political pressure led to a public inquiry, which reached similar conclusions. Major Vane was discharged \"owing to his action in the Skeffington murder case\".<ref>McGarry, p. 186</ref><ref>Townshend, p. 193</ref><ref>Caulfield, Max, p. 187</ref><ref>Yeates, P\u00e1draig.

On the night of 28\u201329 April, British soldiers of the [[South Staffordshire Regiment]], under Colonel Henry Taylor, had burst into houses on North King Street and killed 15 male civilians whom they accused of being rebels. The soldiers shot or bayoneted the victims, then secretly buried some of them in cellars or back yards after robbing them. The area saw some of the fiercest fighting of the Rising and the British had taken heavy casualties for little gain. General Maxwell attempted to excuse the killings and argued that the rebels were ultimately responsible. He claimed that \"the rebels wore no uniform\" and that the people of North King Street were rebel sympathisers. Maxwell concluded that such incidents \"are absolutely unavoidable in such a business as this\" and that \"under the circumstance the troops [...] behaved with the greatest restraint\". A private brief, prepared for the Prime Minister, said the soldiers \"had orders not to take any prisoners\" but took it to mean they were to shoot any suspected rebel. The City Coroner's inquest found that soldiers had killed \"unarmed and unoffending\" residents. The military court of inquiry ruled that no specific soldiers could be held responsible, and no action was taken.<ref>McGarry, p. 187</ref><ref>Caulfield, pp. 338\u2013340</ref><ref>Coogan {{which|date=September 2016}}, pp. 152\u2013155</ref><ref>Townshend, pp. 293\u2013294</ref><ref>Dorney, John.

Historian [[Keith Jeffery]] noted that most of the opposition came from people whose relatives were in the British Army and who depended on their army allowances.<ref>Kennedy, p. 286</ref> Those most openly hostile to the Volunteers were the \"separation women\" (so-called because they were paid \"separation money\" by the British government), whose husbands and sons were fighting in the British Army in the First World War. There was also hostility from [[Unionism in Ireland|unionists]].<ref>Foy and Barton, pp. 203\u2013209</ref> Supporters of the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] also felt the rebellion was a betrayal of their party.<ref>\"The loyalists spoke with an air of contempt, 'the troops will settle the matter in an hour or two, these pro-Germans will run away...' The Redmondites were more bitter, 'I hope they'll all be hanged' ... 'Shooting's too good for them.

After the surrender, the Volunteers were hissed at, pelted with refuse, and denounced as \"murderers\" and \"starvers of the people\".<ref>McGarry, p. 252</ref> Volunteer Robert Holland for example remembered being \"subjected to very ugly remarks and cat-calls from the poorer classes\" as they marched to surrender. He also reported being abused by people he knew as he was marched through the [[Kilmainham]] area into captivity and said the British troops saved them from being manhandled by the crowd.<ref>Ryan, p. 135</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0280.pdf|title = Witness statement of Robert Holland|website = Bureau of Military History|accessdate= 14 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Waiting on Westland Row (8505718647).jpg|thumb|Crowds in Dublin waiting to welcome republican prisoners released in 1917]]\nHowever, some Dubliners expressed support for the rebels.<ref name=\"mcgarry252-256\">McGarry, pp. 252\u2013256</ref> Canadian journalist and writer Frederick Arthur McKenzie wrote that in poorer areas, \"there was a vast amount of sympathy with the rebels, particularly after the rebels were defeated\".<ref>Ellis, pp. 196\u2013197</ref> He wrote of crowds cheering a column of rebel prisoners as it passed, with one woman remarking \"Shure, we cheer them.

Dublin businessman and [[Quaker]] [[James G. Douglas]], for example, hitherto a Home Ruler, wrote that his political outlook changed radically during the course of the Rising because of the British military occupation of the city and that he became convinced that parliamentary methods would not be enough to remove the British presence.<ref>{{cite book|editor=J.

He would also go on to write ''lament for [[Thomas MacDonagh]]'' for his fallen friend and fellow Irish Volunteer. A few months after the Easter Rising, [[W. B. Yeats]] commemorated some of the fallen figures of the Irish Republican movement, as well as his torn emotions regarding these events, in the poem ''[[Easter, 1916]]''.\n\nSome of the survivors of the Rising went on to become leaders of the independent Irish state. Those who were executed were venerated by many as [[Martyr (politics)|martyrs]]; their graves in Dublin's former military prison of [[Arbour Hill Prison|Arbour Hill]] became a national monument and the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic|Proclamation]] text was taught in schools. An annual commemorative military parade was held each year on Easter Sunday. In 1935, [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] unveiled a statue of the mythical Irish hero [[C\u00fa Chulainn]], sculpted by [[Oliver Sheppard]], at the [[General Post Office, Dublin|General Post Office]] as part of the Rising commemorations that year \u2013 it is often seen to be an important symbol of martyrdom in remembrance of the 1916 rebels. Memorials to the heroes of the Rising are to be found in other Irish cities, such as [[1916 Memorial, Limerick|Limerick]].\n\nThe parades culminated in a huge national celebration on the 50th anniversary of the Rising in 1966.<ref>{{cite web| place=IE|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/ll/ll_t06_other_a.html|website=RT\u00c9|year=1966|title=News Items Relating to the 1916 Easter Rising Commemorations}}</ref> Medals were issued by the government to survivors who took part in the rising at the event.

It was valued at [[Ten shilling coin|10 shillings]], therefore having the highest denomination of any pre-decimal coin issued by the country. The coin featured a bust of [[Patrick Pearse]] on the obverse and an image of the statue of [[C\u00fa Chulainn]] in the [[General Post Office, Dublin|GPO]] on the reverse. Its edge inscription reads, \"\u00c9ir\u00ed Amach na C\u00e1sca 1916\", which translates to, \"1916 Easter Rising\".

The [[Government of the 20th D\u00e1il|coalition government]] of 1973\u201377, in particular the [[Minister for Posts and Telegraphs]], [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]], began to promote the view that the violence of 1916 was essentially no different from the violence then taking place in the streets of Belfast and Derry. O'Brien and others asserted that the Rising was doomed to military defeat from the outset, and that it failed to account for the determination of [[Unionism in Ireland|Ulster Unionists]] to remain in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{Cite book|last=O\u2019Brien|first=Conor Cruise|title=States of Ireland |publisher=Hutchinson |year=1972 |isbn=0-09-113100-6 |pages=88, 99{{inconsistent citations}}}}</ref>\n\nIrish republicans continue to venerate the Rising and its leaders with murals in republican areas of Belfast and other towns celebrating the actions of Pearse and his comrades, and annual parades in remembrance of the Rising. The Irish government, however, discontinued its annual parade in Dublin in the early 1970s, and in 1976 it took the unprecedented step of proscribing (under the [[Offences against the State Acts 1939\u20131998|Offences against the State Act]]) a 1916 commemoration ceremony at the GPO organised by Sinn F\u00e9in and the Republican Commemoration Committee.<ref>Irish Times, 22 April 1976</ref> A [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]], [[David Thornley]], embarrassed the government (of which Labour was a member) by appearing on the platform at the ceremony, along with [[M\u00e1ire Comerford]], who had fought in the Rising, and [[Fiona Plunkett]], sister of Joseph Plunkett.<ref>Irish Times, 26 April 1976</ref>\n\nWith the advent of a [[Provisional IRA]] ceasefire and the beginning of what became known as the [[Northern Ireland peace process|Peace Process]] during the 1990s, the government's view of the Rising grew more positive and in 1996 an 80th anniversary commemoration at the [[Garden of Remembrance (Dublin)|Garden of Remembrance]] in Dublin was attended by the [[Taoiseach]] and leader of [[Fine Gael]], [[John Bruton]].<ref>[http://www.village.ie/Ireland/Feature/Reconstructing_the_Easter_Rising/ Reconstructing the Easter Rising], Colin Murphy, ''The Village'', 16 February 2006</ref> In 2005, the Taoiseach, [[Bertie Ahern]], announced the government's intention to resume the military parade past the GPO from Easter 2006, and to form a committee to plan centenary celebrations in 2016.<ref>Irish Times, 22 October 2005</ref> The 90th anniversary was celebrated with a military parade in Dublin on Easter Sunday, 2006, attended by the President of Ireland, the Taoiseach and the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]].<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_pictures/4914362.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|title=In pictures: Easter Rising commemorations|date=16 April 2006|accessdate=29 March 2010}}</ref> There is now an annual ceremony at Easter attended by relatives of those who fought, by the President, the Taoiseach, ministers, senators and TDs, and by usually large and respectful crowds.\n\nThe Rising continues to attract debate and analysis.

Moore - Moore's Bio |website=www.pbs.org |access-date=2018-02-27}}</ref> Moore has been called the first [[martyr]] of this stage of the civil rights movement that expanded in the 1960s.\n\nIn the early 1930s, Moore had become state secretary for the Florida chapter of the NAACP. Through his registration activities, he greatly increased the number of members, and he worked on issues of housing and education. He investigated [[lynchings]], filed lawsuits against [[voter registration]] barriers and [[white primaries]], and worked for equal pay for black teachers in public schools.\n\nMoore also led the Progressive Voters League. Following a 1944 US Supreme Court ruling against [[white primaries]], between 1944 and 1950, he succeeded in increasing the registration of black [[voters]] in Florida to 31 percent of those eligible to vote, markedly higher than in any other [[Southern United States|Southern]] state.\n\n== Early life and family==\nHarry Tyson Moore was born on November 18, 1905, in [[Houston, Florida]],<ref>https://www.pbs.org/harrymoore/harry/mbio.html</ref> a tiny farming community in [[Suwanee County]]. He was the only child of Johnny and Rosa Moore. His father tended the water tanks for the [[Seaboard Air Line Railroad]] and ran a small store in front of his house. Johnny started having health issues when Harry was 9 years old and died that year in 1914. His widow, Rosa, tried to manage alone, working in the cotton fields and running the small store on weekends.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}\n\nIn 1915, Rosa sent Harry to live with one of her sisters in [[Daytona Beach]]. The following year, he moved to [[Jacksonville]], where he lived for the next three years with three other aunts: Jesse, Adrianna, and Masie Tyson, who shared a household.  This would prove to be the most important period in his formative years. Jacksonville had a large and vibrant African-American community, with a proud tradition of independence and intellectual achievement. Moore's aunts were educated, well-informed women (two were educators and one was a nurse), who took this spindly, intelligent boy into their house on Louisiana Street and treated him like the son they'd never had. Under their nurturing guidance, Moore's natural inquisitiveness and love of learning were reinforced.\n\nAfter three years in Jacksonville, he returned home to Suwanee County, in 1919, and enrolled in the [[high school]] program of [[Florida Memorial College]]. Over the next four years, Moore excelled in his studies, and he was nicknamed \"Doc\" by his classmates.  In May 1925, at age 19, he graduated from Florida Memorial College with a \"normal degree\" (for teaching in the elementary grades) and accepted a teaching job in [[Cocoa, Florida]]\u2014in the watery wilderness of [[Brevard County]].\n\nFor the next two years, Moore taught fourth grade at Cocoa's only black elementary school. During his first year in Brevard County, he met [[Harriette Vyda Simms]], an attractive older woman (she was 23, while he was barely 20). She had taught school herself, but was then selling insurance for the [[Atlanta Life Insurance Company]], a major black-owned business. Within a year they were married, on [[Christmas Day]], 1926.\n\nBoth the Moores completed college degrees at [[Bethune Cookman College]], a [[historically black college]] in [[Daytona Beach]].<ref name=\"ben\"/>\n\nThe Syms family lived in [[Mims, Florida|Mims]], a small citrus town outside the county seat of [[Titusville, Florida|Titusville]]. The newlyweds moved in with Harriette's parents until they built their own house on an adjoining acre of land. Meanwhile, Harry had been promoted to principal of the Titusville Colored School, which went from fourth through ninth grades. He taught ninth grade and supervised a staff of six teachers.\n\nOn March 28, 1928, their eldest daughter, Annie Rosalea, nicknamed \"Peaches,\" was born. When Peaches was six months old, Harriette began teaching at the Mims Colored School. On September 3, 1930, their \"baby daughter,\" Juanita Evangeline, was born. Both their daughters also earned college degrees at Bethune Cookman College.<ref name=\"ben\"/> Peaches died in August 1972, at the age of 44. Juanita Evangeline died at the age of 85 in October 2015.\n\n== Civil rights activism ==\nIn 1934, soon after the birth of their daughters, the Moores founded the [[Brevard County]] chapter of the [[NAACP]]. Moore also helped organize the statewide NAACP organization.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Through his registration activities, he greatly increased the number of members, and he worked on issues of housing and education. He investigated [[lynchings]], filed lawsuits against [[voter registration]] barriers and [[white primaries]], and worked for equal pay for black teachers in public schools, although they were segregated.\n\nIn 1946 both the Moores were fired from their teaching jobs because of their activism; Harry Moore was working to gain equal pay for black public school teachers in the Brevard County segregated school system. Such economic retaliation was widely used in southern states to discourage activism. Harry Moore accepted a paid position with the NAACP in order to survive economically.\n\nMoore also led the Progressive Voters League. Following a 1944 US Supreme Court ruling against [[white primaries]] as unconstitutional (which the Democratic Party had used as another means of excluding blacks from politics), between 1944 and 1950, Moore succeeded in increasing the registration of black [[voters]] in Florida to 31 percent of those eligible to vote, markedly higher than in any other [[Southern United States|Southern]] state.\n\n== Groveland case==\n{{main|Groveland Case}}\n[[File:Harry T Moore.jpg|thumb|Undated newspaper file photo of Harry T. Moore]]\nIn July 1949, four black men were accused of [[raping]] a white woman in [[Groveland, Florida]]. Ernest Thomas fled the county and was killed by a posse; the other three suspects were arrested and beaten while held in custody, forcing two to confess. Rumors accompanied the case against a background of post-war tensions resulting from problems in absorbing veterans into jobs and American society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Reviews-Essays/Devil-in-the-Grove-Thurgood-Marshall-the-Groveland-Boys-and-the/ba-p/7301|title=Devil in the Grove: Thurgood Marshall, the Groveland Boys, and the Dawn of a New America|website=The Barnes & Noble Review}}</ref> In Groveland, a white mob of more than 400 demanded that the sheriff, [[Willis V. McCall]], who had hidden the prisoners to protect them, hand the [[Convict|prisoners]] over for lynching.  The mob left the jail and went on a [[running amok|rampage]], burning buildings in the black district of town. McCall asked the governor to send in the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], but six days were needed to restore order.\n\nThe three young men, one 16 years of age and a minor, were found guilty by an [[all-white jury]]. The judge sentenced 16-year-old [[Groveland Four|Charles Greenlee]] to [[life in prison]]; [[Sam Shepherd (Groveland Four)|Sam Shepherd]] and [[Walter Irvin]] were sentenced to death.\n\n[[Executive Director]] of the Florida NAACP, Harry T. Moore, organized a [[political campaign|campaign]] against what he saw as the wrongful convictions of the three men. With NAACP support, appeals were pursued. In April 1951, a legal team headed by [[Thurgood Marshall]] won the appeal of Shepherd and Irvin's convictions before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. A new trial was scheduled.\n\nCounty Sheriff McCall was responsible for transporting Shepherd and Irvin to the new trial venue in November 1951. He claimed that the two men, both handcuffed, attacked him in an escape attempt. He shot them both, and Shepherd died at the scene. Irvin survived his [[wounds]]; he later claimed to NAACP and FBI officials that the sheriff shot both him and Shepherd in cold blood. Moore called for an [[indictment]] against Sheriff McCall and called on Florida Governor [[Fuller Warren]] to suspend McCall from office.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-05-19/news/9905180799_1_harry-moore-mccall-lake-county|title=Book Revives Debate About Fatal Christmas 1951 Bombing|work=tribunedigital-orlandosentinel|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en}}</ref><!-- Any action taken? -->\n\n==Murder==\n{{main|Murder of Harry and Harriette Moore}}\nSix weeks later on Christmas night, 1951, on the Moores' 25th wedding anniversary, a bomb went off beneath the couples' house in Mims, Florida.

He was the first NAACP official assassinated in the civil rights struggle. He and his wife were the first couple to be killed  for civil rights.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe murders caused a national and international outcry, with protests registered at the [[United Nations]] against violence in the South. The NAACP held a huge rally in New York, and in other cities, too. In many respects, the protests over the Moores' murders were a fore runner of demonstrations during the civil rights movement. The NAACP sponsored a fundraising event at  [[Madison Square Garden]], where a song entitled \"The Ballad of Harry Moore\" was performed, with lyrics by the renowned poet [[Langston Hughes]].<ref name=\"palmb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/454.html|author=Browning, Michael |title=Who Was Harry T. Moore?|website=hartford-hwp.com}}</ref>\n\nThe State of Florida called the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] ([[FBI]]) to head the investigation, but the case was never solved and no one was ever prosecuted. The FBI was convinced that the [[Ku Klux Klan]] had committed the bombing and identified a number of local Klansmen as suspects, but was never able to find enough evidence to break the case.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://stars.library.ucf.edu/ahistoryofcentralfloridapodcast/41/|title = Episode 40 Icons of Hate|date = January 14, 2015|access-date = February 7, 2016|website = A History of Central Florida Podcast|publisher = |last = Kelley|first = Katie}}</ref> Eventually, the FBI indicted seven Klansmen for lying about their involvement in other racial violence, hoping that the pressure of the indictments would force some of the Klansmen to crack and testify about the Moore case. But the ploy didn't work, and the indictments were eventually dismissed. The FBI eventually closed the Moore investigation in 1953.\n\nThe case has been reopened three times: in 1978 by Brevard County, in 1991-92 by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE), and in 2005 by Florida Attorney General [[Charlie Crist]]. In October 2006, three weeks before winning the Republican primary for governor, Crist held a press conference in Mims and claimed to have \"resolved\" the case. Although he said that his investigation found no new evidence, Crist identified four Klansmen, by then dead, as the likely perpetrators.\n\nIn the next few weeks, however, the Crist investigation was roundly criticized by Moore scholars, FDLE investigators, and newspaper editorial boards. It was largely dismissed as a political attempt to win black votes (particularly after the Crist campaign admitted to filming a campaign TV ad with Evangeline Moore, although it was never used because of the controversy.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}})\n\nWhen the Moores were killed, the risk to civil rights activists and any blacks in the South was high and continued to be so. According to a later report from the NAACP's Southern Regional Council in [[Atlanta]], the homes of 40 black Southern families were bombed during 1951 and 1952. Some, like Harry Moore, were activists whose work exposed them to danger, but most were either people who had refused to bow to racist convention or were simply \"innocent bystanders, unsuspecting victims of random white terrorism.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Egerton, John|title=Speak Now Against the Day: The Generation Before the Civil Rights Movement in the South|location=New York|publisher= Alfred A.

New memorials have been named or designated in their honor.

The Moores' only surviving daughter, Juanita Evangeline Moore, encouraged Crist in the efforts to uncover the identity of her parents' killers.\n\nForensics teams combed the former site of the Moores' house for evidence (the site is now within a memorial park). On August 16, 2006, Crist announced the results of the work of the state Office of Civil Rights and the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]]. Rumors linking Sheriff [[Willis V.

The following year, he moved to [[Jacksonville]], where he lived for the next three years with three other aunts: Jesse, Adrianna, and Masie Tyson, who shared a household.  This would prove to be the most important period in his formative years. Jacksonville had a large and vibrant African-American community, with a proud tradition of independence and intellectual achievement. Moore's aunts were educated, well-informed women (two were educators and one was a nurse), who took this spindly, intelligent boy into their house on Louisiana Street and treated him like the son they'd never had. Under their nurturing guidance, Moore's natural inquisitiveness and love of learning were reinforced.\n\nAfter three years in Jacksonville, he returned home to Suwanee County, in 1919, and enrolled in the [[high school]] program of [[Florida Memorial College]]. Over the next four years, Moore excelled in his studies, and he was nicknamed \"Doc\" by his classmates.  In May 1925, at age 19, he graduated from Florida Memorial College with a \"normal degree\" (for teaching in the elementary grades) and accepted a teaching job in [[Cocoa, Florida]]\u2014in the watery wilderness of [[Brevard County]].\n\nFor the next two years, Moore taught fourth grade at Cocoa's only black elementary school. During his first year in Brevard County, he met [[Harriette Vyda Simms]], an attractive older woman (she was 23, while he was barely 20). She had taught school herself, but was then selling insurance for the [[Atlanta Life Insurance Company]], a major black-owned business. Within a year they were married, on [[Christmas Day]], 1926.\n\nBoth the Moores completed college degrees at [[Bethune Cookman College]], a [[historically black college]] in [[Daytona Beach]].<ref name=\"ben\"/>\n\nThe Syms family lived in [[Mims, Florida|Mims]], a small citrus town outside the county seat of [[Titusville, Florida|Titusville]]. The newlyweds moved in with Harriette's parents until they built their own house on an adjoining acre of land. Meanwhile, Harry had been promoted to principal of the Titusville Colored School, which went from fourth through ninth grades. He taught ninth grade and supervised a staff of six teachers.\n\nOn March 28, 1928, their eldest daughter, Annie Rosalea, nicknamed \"Peaches,\" was born. When Peaches was six months old, Harriette began teaching at the Mims Colored School. On September 3, 1930, their \"baby daughter,\" Juanita Evangeline, was born. Both their daughters also earned college degrees at Bethune Cookman College.<ref name=\"ben\"/> Peaches died in August 1972, at the age of 44. Juanita Evangeline died at the age of 85 in October 2015.\n\n== Civil rights activism ==\nIn 1934, soon after the birth of their daughters, the Moores founded the [[Brevard County]] chapter of the [[NAACP]]. Moore also helped organize the statewide NAACP organization.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Through his registration activities, he greatly increased the number of members, and he worked on issues of housing and education. He investigated [[lynchings]], filed lawsuits against [[voter registration]] barriers and [[white primaries]], and worked for equal pay for black teachers in public schools, although they were segregated.\n\nIn 1946 both the Moores were fired from their teaching jobs because of their activism; Harry Moore was working to gain equal pay for black public school teachers in the Brevard County segregated school system. Such economic retaliation was widely used in southern states to discourage activism. Harry Moore accepted a paid position with the NAACP in order to survive economically.\n\nMoore also led the Progressive Voters League. Following a 1944 US Supreme Court ruling against [[white primaries]] as unconstitutional (which the Democratic Party had used as another means of excluding blacks from politics), between 1944 and 1950, Moore succeeded in increasing the registration of black [[voters]] in Florida to 31 percent of those eligible to vote, markedly higher than in any other [[Southern United States|Southern]] state.\n\n== Groveland case==\n{{main|Groveland Case}}\n[[File:Harry T Moore.jpg|thumb|Undated newspaper file photo of Harry T. Moore]]\nIn July 1949, four black men were accused of [[raping]] a white woman in [[Groveland, Florida]]. Ernest Thomas fled the county and was killed by a posse; the other three suspects were arrested and beaten while held in custody, forcing two to confess. Rumors accompanied the case against a background of post-war tensions resulting from problems in absorbing veterans into jobs and American society.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bnreview.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Reviews-Essays/Devil-in-the-Grove-Thurgood-Marshall-the-Groveland-Boys-and-the/ba-p/7301|title=Devil in the Grove: Thurgood Marshall, the Groveland Boys, and the Dawn of a New America|website=The Barnes & Noble Review}}</ref> In Groveland, a white mob of more than 400 demanded that the sheriff, [[Willis V. McCall]], who had hidden the prisoners to protect them, hand the [[Convict|prisoners]] over for lynching.  The mob left the jail and went on a [[running amok|rampage]], burning buildings in the black district of town. McCall asked the governor to send in the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]], but six days were needed to restore order.\n\nThe three young men, one 16 years of age and a minor, were found guilty by an [[all-white jury]]. The judge sentenced 16-year-old [[Groveland Four|Charles Greenlee]] to [[life in prison]]; [[Sam Shepherd (Groveland Four)|Sam Shepherd]] and [[Walter Irvin]] were sentenced to death.\n\n[[Executive Director]] of the Florida NAACP, Harry T. Moore, organized a [[political campaign|campaign]] against what he saw as the wrongful convictions of the three men. With NAACP support, appeals were pursued. In April 1951, a legal team headed by [[Thurgood Marshall]] won the appeal of Shepherd and Irvin's convictions before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. A new trial was scheduled.\n\nCounty Sheriff McCall was responsible for transporting Shepherd and Irvin to the new trial venue in November 1951. He claimed that the two men, both handcuffed, attacked him in an escape attempt. He shot them both, and Shepherd died at the scene. Irvin survived his [[wounds]]; he later claimed to NAACP and FBI officials that the sheriff shot both him and Shepherd in cold blood. Moore called for an [[indictment]] against Sheriff McCall and called on Florida Governor [[Fuller Warren]] to suspend McCall from office.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-05-19/news/9905180799_1_harry-moore-mccall-lake-county|title=Book Revives Debate About Fatal Christmas 1951 Bombing|work=tribunedigital-orlandosentinel|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en}}</ref><!-- Any action taken? -->\n\n==Murder==\n{{main|Murder of Harry and Harriette Moore}}\nSix weeks later on Christmas night, 1951, on the Moores' 25th wedding anniversary, a bomb went off beneath the couples' house in Mims, Florida.

His wife died from her injuries nine days later at the same hospital in Sanford.<ref name=\"ben\"/>\n\nMoore has been called the first [[martyr]] in the civil rights movement. He was the first NAACP official assassinated in the civil rights struggle. He and his wife were the first couple to be killed  for civil rights.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe murders caused a national and international outcry, with protests registered at the [[United Nations]] against violence in the South. The NAACP held a huge rally in New York, and in other cities, too. In many respects, the protests over the Moores' murders were a fore runner of demonstrations during the civil rights movement. The NAACP sponsored a fundraising event at  [[Madison Square Garden]], where a song entitled \"The Ballad of Harry Moore\" was performed, with lyrics by the renowned poet [[Langston Hughes]].<ref name=\"palmb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/454.html|author=Browning, Michael |title=Who Was Harry T. Moore?|website=hartford-hwp.com}}</ref>\n\nThe State of Florida called the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] ([[FBI]]) to head the investigation, but the case was never solved and no one was ever prosecuted. The FBI was convinced that the [[Ku Klux Klan]] had committed the bombing and identified a number of local Klansmen as suspects, but was never able to find enough evidence to break the case.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://stars.library.ucf.edu/ahistoryofcentralfloridapodcast/41/|title = Episode 40 Icons of Hate|date = January 14, 2015|access-date = February 7, 2016|website = A History of Central Florida Podcast|publisher = |last = Kelley|first = Katie}}</ref> Eventually, the FBI indicted seven Klansmen for lying about their involvement in other racial violence, hoping that the pressure of the indictments would force some of the Klansmen to crack and testify about the Moore case. But the ploy didn't work, and the indictments were eventually dismissed. The FBI eventually closed the Moore investigation in 1953.\n\nThe case has been reopened three times: in 1978 by Brevard County, in 1991-92 by the Florida Department of Law Enforcement (FDLE), and in 2005 by Florida Attorney General [[Charlie Crist]]. In October 2006, three weeks before winning the Republican primary for governor, Crist held a press conference in Mims and claimed to have \"resolved\" the case. Although he said that his investigation found no new evidence, Crist identified four Klansmen, by then dead, as the likely perpetrators.\n\nIn the next few weeks, however, the Crist investigation was roundly criticized by Moore scholars, FDLE investigators, and newspaper editorial boards. It was largely dismissed as a political attempt to win black votes (particularly after the Crist campaign admitted to filming a campaign TV ad with Evangeline Moore, although it was never used because of the controversy.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}})\n\nWhen the Moores were killed, the risk to civil rights activists and any blacks in the South was high and continued to be so. According to a later report from the NAACP's Southern Regional Council in [[Atlanta]], the homes of 40 black Southern families were bombed during 1951 and 1952. Some, like Harry Moore, were activists whose work exposed them to danger, but most were either people who had refused to bow to racist convention or were simply \"innocent bystanders, unsuspecting victims of random white terrorism.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Egerton, John|title=Speak Now Against the Day: The Generation Before the Civil Rights Movement in the South|location=New York|publisher= Alfred A.

The Moores' only surviving daughter, Juanita Evangeline Moore, encouraged Crist in the efforts to uncover the identity of her parents' killers.\n\nForensics teams combed the former site of the Moores' house for evidence (the site is now within a memorial park). On August 16, 2006, Crist announced the results of the work of the state Office of Civil Rights and the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]]. Rumors linking Sheriff [[Willis V.

The car was very successful in Spain having sold 896,136 units,<ref>[http://www.museoseat.com/seat/seat-e.htm SEAT 124]. ''Museoseat.com.''</ref> and was produced in 4-door, 5-door [[station wagon]] (''Familiar'') and 2-door [[coup\u00e9]] (''Sport'') ( versions under various engines and trim levels.\n\n==History==\nThe SEAT 124 model derived from the Italian [[Fiat 124]] car and represented a great step forward for the automotive era in Spain when it was introduced. It aimed at the middle class, as it combined generous offerings and livability but at the same time in an accessible to buy and own package.\n\nDuring its launch time SEAT already sold the [[SEAT 1500]], [[SEAT 600|SEAT 600D]] and [[SEAT 850]] models, and by the time the 124 model was retired it was succeeded by the [[SEAT Ritmo]], fabricated in Spain from 1979 onwards.\n\nIn 1975 the model underwent a facelift by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]; the circular front headlights were replaced by rectangular ones and its rear was altered amid several modifications, while the SEAT 124 and [[SEAT 1430]] ranges were unified under a single model  officially named '''SEAT 124D versi\u00f3n 75'''. In 1976 production of the car was transferred from the Zona Franca to the Landaben plant in [[Pamplona]], newly acquired from [[Authi]], resulting in the elimination of the '124 Familiar' 5-door station wagon versions.\n\nThe four-cylinder twin-barrel carburetted 1197&nbsp;cc motor originally delivered 60 CV (DIN), however in 1973 a new derivative was implemented with the introduction of the '''SEAT 124 LS''' which offered 65 CV (DIN).\n\nThe variants equipped with the Twin Cam motor, victorious for decades in all-type competition, were generally known as '''FL''' which had been the internal code name used by the brand.\n\nIts engine soon became famous for its nerve and offered high performance in many circumstances: either as a taxi cab, a police car, an ambulance, a hearse, or even a fire truck.

The car was very successful in Spain having sold 896,136 units,<ref>[http://www.museoseat.com/seat/seat-e.htm SEAT 124]. ''Museoseat.com.''</ref> and was produced in 4-door, 5-door [[station wagon]] (''Familiar'') and 2-door [[coup\u00e9]] (''Sport'') ( versions under various engines and trim levels.\n\n==History==\nThe SEAT 124 model derived from the Italian [[Fiat 124]] car and represented a great step forward for the automotive era in Spain when it was introduced. It aimed at the middle class, as it combined generous offerings and livability but at the same time in an accessible to buy and own package.\n\nDuring its launch time SEAT already sold the [[SEAT 1500]], [[SEAT 600|SEAT 600D]] and [[SEAT 850]] models, and by the time the 124 model was retired it was succeeded by the [[SEAT Ritmo]], fabricated in Spain from 1979 onwards.\n\nIn 1975 the model underwent a facelift by [[Giorgetto Giugiaro]]; the circular front headlights were replaced by rectangular ones and its rear was altered amid several modifications, while the SEAT 124 and [[SEAT 1430]] ranges were unified under a single model  officially named '''SEAT 124D versi\u00f3n 75'''. In 1976 production of the car was transferred from the Zona Franca to the Landaben plant in [[Pamplona]], newly acquired from [[Authi]], resulting in the elimination of the '124 Familiar' 5-door station wagon versions.\n\nThe four-cylinder twin-barrel carburetted 1197&nbsp;cc motor originally delivered 60 CV (DIN), however in 1973 a new derivative was implemented with the introduction of the '''SEAT 124 LS''' which offered 65 CV (DIN).\n\nThe variants equipped with the Twin Cam motor, victorious for decades in all-type competition, were generally known as '''FL''' which had been the internal code name used by the brand.\n\nIts engine soon became famous for its nerve and offered high performance in many circumstances: either as a taxi cab, a police car, an ambulance, a hearse, or even a fire truck. As a race car, it won numerous competitions and trophies driven by pilots like [[Salvador Ca\u00f1ellas]] and Antonio Zanini amid others. Modified for this purpose in order to be used in rallies, its engine displacement was raised to reach as much as 2090&nbsp;cc.

By analysing descendants' DNA, however, parts of ancestral genomes are estimated by scientists. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y-chromosome DNA are commonly used to trace ancestry in this manner. mtDNA is generally passed un-mixed from mothers to children of both sexes, along the maternal line, or [[matrilineally]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Giles |first=Richard E|first2=H |last2=Blanc |first3=H M |last3=Cann |first4=D C |last4=Wallace |year=1980 |title=Maternal inheritance of human mitochondrial DNA |journal=PNAS |volume=77 |issue=11 |pages=6715\u201319 |doi=10.1073/pnas.77.11.6715 |pmid=6256757 |pmc=350359 |bibcode=1980PNAS...77.6715G }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Birky |first=C.

Each marker is a DNA base-pair that has resulted from an [[single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] [[mutation]]. Scientists sort mitochondrial DNA results into more or less related groups, with more or less recent common ancestors. This leads to the construction of a DNA [[family tree]] where the branches are in biological terms [[clade]]s, and the common ancestors such as Mitochondrial Eve sit at branching points in this tree. Major branches are said to define a [[haplogroup]] (e.g. CRS belongs to [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|haplogroup H]]), and large branches containing several haplogroups are called \"macro-haplogroups\".\n\n[[File:Mitochondrial eve tree.gif|thumb|right|200px|Simplified Human mitochondrial phylogeny]]\n\nThe mitochondrial clade which Mitochondrial Eve defines is the [[species]] ''[[species:Homo sapiens|Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' itself, or at least the current population or \"[[chronospecies]]\" as it exists today. In principle, earlier Eves can also be defined going beyond the species, for example one who is ancestral to both modern humanity and [[Neanderthal]]s, or, further back, an \"Eve\" ancestral to all members of [[genus]] ''[[species:Homo|Homo]]'' and chimpanzees in genus ''[[species:Pan|Pan]]''. According to current nomenclature, Mitochondrial Eve's haplogroup was within [[Macro-haplogroup L (mtDNA)|mitochondrial haplogroup L]] because this macro-haplogroup contains all surviving human mitochondrial lineages today, and she must predate the emergence of [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0]].\n\nThe variation of mitochondrial DNA between different people can be used to estimate the time back to a common ancestor, such as Mitochondrial Eve. This works because, along any particular line of descent, mitochondrial DNA accumulates mutations at the rate of approximately one every 3,500 years per nucleotide.<ref name=\"Soares09\">{{cite journal|last1= Soares|first1=P |last2=Ermini |first2=L |last3=Thomson |first3=N |last4=Mormina |first4=M |last5= Rito|first5=T |last6=R\u00f6hl |first6=A |last7=Salas |first7=A |last8=Oppenheimer |first8=S |last9= Macaulay|first9=V |title=Correcting for purifying selection: an improved human mitochondrial molecular clock |journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=740\u201359 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19500773 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.05.001 |pmc=2694979 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last= Gibbons|first= A |title=Calibrating the Mitochondrial Clock |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=279 |issue=5347 |pages=28\u201329 |date=January 1998 |doi=10.1126/science.279.5347.28 |pmid=9441404|bibcode=1998Sci...279...28G }}</ref>{{efn|group=note|There are sites in mtDNA (such as: 16129, 16223, 16311, 16362) that evolve more rapidly, have been noted to change within intragenerational timeframes \u2013 {{Harvtxt |Excoffier|Yang|1999}}.}} A certain number of these new variants will survive into modern times and be identifiable as distinct lineages.

Whenever one of the two most ancient branch lines dies out, the MRCA will move to a more recent female ancestor, always the most recent mother to have more than one daughter with living maternal line descendants alive today. The number of mutations that can be found distinguishing modern people is determined by two criteria: firstly and most obviously, the time back to her, but secondly and less obviously by the varying rates at which new branches have come into existence and old branches have become extinct. By looking at the number of mutations which have been accumulated in different branches of this family tree, and looking at which geographical regions have the widest range of least related branches, the region where Eve lived can be proposed.\n\n==Popular reception and misconceptions==\n''Newsweek'' reported on Mitochondrial Eve based on the Cann ''et al.'' study in January 1988, under a heading of \"Scientists Explore a Controversial Theory About Man's Origins\".

That is, not only can our knowledge of when and where Mitochondrial Eve lived change due to new discoveries, but the actual Mitochondrial Eve can change. The Mitochondrial Eve can change, when a mother-daughter line comes to an end. It follows from the definition of Mitochondrial Eve that she had at least two daughters who both have unbroken ''female'' lineages that have survived to the present day. In every generation mitochondrial lineages end&nbsp;\u2013 when a woman with unique mtDNA dies with no daughters. When the mitochondrial lineages of daughters of Mitochondrial Eve die out, then the title of \"Mitochondrial Eve\" shifts forward from the remaining daughter through her matrilineal descendants, until the first descendant is reached who had two or more daughters who together have all living humans as their matrilineal descendants. Once a lineage has died out it is irretrievably lost and this mechanism can thus only shift the title of \"Mitochondrial Eve\" forward in time.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nBecause mtDNA mapping of humans is very incomplete, the discovery of living mtDNA lines which predate our current concept of \"Mitochondrial Eve\" could result in the title moving to an earlier woman. This happened to her male counterpart, \"Y-chromosomal Adam,\" when older Y lines from Africa were discovered.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Not necessarily a contemporary of \"Y-chromosomal Adam\"===\nSometimes Mitochondrial Eve is assumed to have lived at the same time as [[Y-chromosomal Adam]] (from whom all living people are descended patrilineally), and perhaps even met and mated with him. Even if this were true, which is currently regarded as highly unlikely, this would only be a coincidence. Like Mitochondrial \"Eve\", Y-chromosomal \"Adam\" probably lived in Africa. A recent study (March 2013) concluded however that \"Eve\" lived much later than \"Adam\"&nbsp;\u2013 some 140,000 years later.<ref name=\"adam2013\" /> (Earlier studies considered, conversely, that \"Eve\" lived earlier than \"Adam\".)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cruciani |first1=F |last2=Trombetta |first2=B |last3=Massaia |first3=A |last4=Destro-Bisol |first4=G |last5=Sellitto |first5=D |last6=Scozzari |first6=R |title=A Revised Root for the Human Y Chromosomal Phylogenetic Tree: The Origin of Patrilineal Diversity in Africa |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=88 |issue=6 |date=10 June 2011 |pages=814\u201318 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.05.002 |pmid=21601174 |pmc=3113241}}</ref> More recent studies indicate that Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam may indeed have lived around the same time.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.nature.com/news/genetic-adam-and-eve-did-not-live-too-far-apart-in-time-1.13478 |title=Genetic Adam and Eve did not live too far apart in time |first=Ewen |last=Callaway |date=6 August 2013 |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/nature.2013.13478}}</ref>\n\n===Not the most recent ancestor shared by all humans===\n{{Main|Most recent common ancestor}}\nMitochondrial Eve is the most recent common ''matrilineal'' ancestor, not the ''most recent common ancestor''.

An approximate sequence from newest to oldest can list various important points in the ancestry of modern human populations:\n* [[most recent common ancestor|The human MRCA]].

This is far more recent than when Mitochondrial Eve was proposed to have lived.<ref name=Rodhe2004/>\n* Mitochondrial Eve, the most recent female-line common ancestor of all living people.\n* \"Y-chromosomal Adam\", the most recent male-line common ancestor of all living people.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Archaeogenetics]]\n* [[Coalescent theory]]\n* [[Eurasian Adam]]\n* [[Genealogical DNA test]]\n* [[Genetic genealogy]]\n* [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)]]\n* [[Human evolution]]\n* [[Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroups]]\n* [[Last universal ancestor]]\n* [[Macro-haplogroup L (mtDNA)]]\n* [[Mitochondrial genome]]\n* [[Monogenism]]\n* [[Neutral theory of molecular evolution]]\n* [[Single origin hypothesis]]\n* [[Timeline of evolution]]\n* [[Timeline of human evolution]]\n* [[Y-chromosomal Aaron]]\n* [[Y-chromosomal Adam]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{MtDNA}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<!------{{Citation |title= |journal= |volume= |issue= |pages= |url= |doi= }} Please copy this first and the past names, ---->\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n* {{Citation |last1=Atkinson |first1=QD |last2=Gray |first2=RD |last3=Drummond |first3=AJ |title=Bayesian coalescent inference of major human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup expansions in Africa |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences |volume=276 |issue=1655 |pages=367\u201373 |date=January 2009 |pmid=18826938 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0785 |pmc=2674340}}\n* {{Citation |last=Ayala |first=F |title=The myth of Eve:molecular biology and human origin |journal=Science |year=1995 |volume=270 |pages=1930\u201336 |pmid =8533083 |doi=10.1126/science.270.5244.1930 |issue=5244  |bibcode=1995Sci...270.1930A |doi-access=free }}\n* {{Citation |last1=Balloux |first1=F |last2=Handley |first2=LJ |last3=Jombart |first3=T |last4=Liu |first4=H |last5=Manica |first5=A|title=Climate shaped the worldwide distribution of human mitochondrial DNA sequence variation|journal=Proc Biol Sci |year=2009 |volume =276 |issue=1672|pages =3447\u201355 |pmid=19586946|doi=10.1098/rspb.2009.0752| pmc=2817182}}\n* {{Citation |last1=Behar| title=The dawn of human matrilineal diversity |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=82 |issue=5 |pages=1130\u201340 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18439549 |pmc=2427203 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2008.04.002 |author2=Villems |author3=Soodyall |author4=Blue-Smith |author5=Pereira |author6=Metspalu |author7=Scozzari |author8=Makkan |author9=Tzur |first1=D }}\n* {{citation |last1=Brown |first1=WM |title=Polymorphism in mitochondrial DNA of humans as revealed by restriction endonuclease analysis |journal=Proc.

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and Y-chromosome DNA are commonly used to trace ancestry in this manner. mtDNA is generally passed un-mixed from mothers to children of both sexes, along the maternal line, or [[matrilineally]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Giles |first=Richard E|first2=H |last2=Blanc |first3=H M |last3=Cann |first4=D C |last4=Wallace |year=1980 |title=Maternal inheritance of human mitochondrial DNA |journal=PNAS |volume=77 |issue=11 |pages=6715\u201319 |doi=10.1073/pnas.77.11.6715 |pmid=6256757 |pmc=350359 |bibcode=1980PNAS...77.6715G }}</ref><ref>{{Citation |last=Birky |first=C.

Each marker is a DNA base-pair that has resulted from an [[single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] [[mutation]]. Scientists sort mitochondrial DNA results into more or less related groups, with more or less recent common ancestors. This leads to the construction of a DNA [[family tree]] where the branches are in biological terms [[clade]]s, and the common ancestors such as Mitochondrial Eve sit at branching points in this tree. Major branches are said to define a [[haplogroup]] (e.g. CRS belongs to [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|haplogroup H]]), and large branches containing several haplogroups are called \"macro-haplogroups\".\n\n[[File:Mitochondrial eve tree.gif|thumb|right|200px|Simplified Human mitochondrial phylogeny]]\n\nThe mitochondrial clade which Mitochondrial Eve defines is the [[species]] ''[[species:Homo sapiens|Homo sapiens sapiens]]'' itself, or at least the current population or \"[[chronospecies]]\" as it exists today. In principle, earlier Eves can also be defined going beyond the species, for example one who is ancestral to both modern humanity and [[Neanderthal]]s, or, further back, an \"Eve\" ancestral to all members of [[genus]] ''[[species:Homo|Homo]]'' and chimpanzees in genus ''[[species:Pan|Pan]]''. According to current nomenclature, Mitochondrial Eve's haplogroup was within [[Macro-haplogroup L (mtDNA)|mitochondrial haplogroup L]] because this macro-haplogroup contains all surviving human mitochondrial lineages today, and she must predate the emergence of [[Haplogroup L0 (mtDNA)|L0]].\n\nThe variation of mitochondrial DNA between different people can be used to estimate the time back to a common ancestor, such as Mitochondrial Eve. This works because, along any particular line of descent, mitochondrial DNA accumulates mutations at the rate of approximately one every 3,500 years per nucleotide.<ref name=\"Soares09\">{{cite journal|last1= Soares|first1=P |last2=Ermini |first2=L |last3=Thomson |first3=N |last4=Mormina |first4=M |last5= Rito|first5=T |last6=R\u00f6hl |first6=A |last7=Salas |first7=A |last8=Oppenheimer |first8=S |last9= Macaulay|first9=V |title=Correcting for purifying selection: an improved human mitochondrial molecular clock |journal=[[American Journal of Human Genetics]] |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=740\u201359 |date=June 2009 |pmid=19500773 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.05.001 |pmc=2694979 }}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last= Gibbons|first= A |title=Calibrating the Mitochondrial Clock |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=279 |issue=5347 |pages=28\u201329 |date=January 1998 |doi=10.1126/science.279.5347.28 |pmid=9441404|bibcode=1998Sci...279...28G }}</ref>{{efn|group=note|There are sites in mtDNA (such as: 16129, 16223, 16311, 16362) that evolve more rapidly, have been noted to change within intragenerational timeframes \u2013 {{Harvtxt |Excoffier|Yang|1999}}.}} A certain number of these new variants will survive into modern times and be identifiable as distinct lineages. At the same time some branches, including even very old ones, come to an end when the last family in a distinct branch has no daughters.\n\nMitochondrial Eve is the most recent common matrilineal ancestor for all modern humans. Whenever one of the two most ancient branch lines dies out, the MRCA will move to a more recent female ancestor, always the most recent mother to have more than one daughter with living maternal line descendants alive today. The number of mutations that can be found distinguishing modern people is determined by two criteria: firstly and most obviously, the time back to her, but secondly and less obviously by the varying rates at which new branches have come into existence and old branches have become extinct. By looking at the number of mutations which have been accumulated in different branches of this family tree, and looking at which geographical regions have the widest range of least related branches, the region where Eve lived can be proposed.\n\n==Popular reception and misconceptions==\n''Newsweek'' reported on Mitochondrial Eve based on the Cann ''et al.'' study in January 1988, under a heading of \"Scientists Explore a Controversial Theory About Man's Origins\".

That is, not only can our knowledge of when and where Mitochondrial Eve lived change due to new discoveries, but the actual Mitochondrial Eve can change. The Mitochondrial Eve can change, when a mother-daughter line comes to an end. It follows from the definition of Mitochondrial Eve that she had at least two daughters who both have unbroken ''female'' lineages that have survived to the present day. In every generation mitochondrial lineages end&nbsp;\u2013 when a woman with unique mtDNA dies with no daughters. When the mitochondrial lineages of daughters of Mitochondrial Eve die out, then the title of \"Mitochondrial Eve\" shifts forward from the remaining daughter through her matrilineal descendants, until the first descendant is reached who had two or more daughters who together have all living humans as their matrilineal descendants. Once a lineage has died out it is irretrievably lost and this mechanism can thus only shift the title of \"Mitochondrial Eve\" forward in time.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\nBecause mtDNA mapping of humans is very incomplete, the discovery of living mtDNA lines which predate our current concept of \"Mitochondrial Eve\" could result in the title moving to an earlier woman. This happened to her male counterpart, \"Y-chromosomal Adam,\" when older Y lines from Africa were discovered.{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Not necessarily a contemporary of \"Y-chromosomal Adam\"===\nSometimes mitochondrial Eve is assumed to have lived at the same time as [[Y-chromosomal Adam]] (from whom all living people are descended patrilineally), and perhaps even met and mated with him. Even if this were true, which is currently regarded as highly unlikely, this would only be a coincidence. Like mitochondrial \"Eve\", Y-chromosomal \"Adam\" probably lived in Africa. A recent study (March 2013) concluded however that \"Eve\" lived much later than \"Adam\"&nbsp;\u2013 some 140,000 years later.<ref name=\"adam2013\" /> (Earlier studies considered, conversely, that \"Eve\" lived earlier than \"Adam\".)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cruciani |first1=F |last2=Trombetta |first2=B |last3=Massaia |first3=A |last4=Destro-Bisol |first4=G |last5=Sellitto |first5=D |last6=Scozzari |first6=R |title=A Revised Root for the Human Y Chromosomal Phylogenetic Tree: The Origin of Patrilineal Diversity in Africa |journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=88 |issue=6 |date=10 June 2011 |pages=814\u201318 |doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.05.002 |pmid=21601174 |pmc=3113241}}</ref> More recent studies indicate that mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam may indeed have lived around the same time.<ref>{{cite journal|url= http://www.nature.com/news/genetic-adam-and-eve-did-not-live-too-far-apart-in-time-1.13478 |title=Genetic Adam and Eve did not live too far apart in time |first=Ewen |last=Callaway |date=6 August 2013 |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/nature.2013.13478}}</ref>\n\n===Not the most recent ancestor shared by all humans===\n{{Main|Most recent common ancestor}}\nMitochondrial Eve is the most recent common ''matrilineal'' ancestor, not the ''most recent common ancestor''.

An approximate sequence from newest to oldest can list various important points in the ancestry of modern human populations:\n* [[most recent common ancestor|The human MRCA]].

In 1537, the diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin consisted of the (modern) counties of [[Hordaland]] and [[Sogn og Fjordane]] (with exception of the parishes of [[Eidfjord]] and [[R\u00f8ldal]]). \n\nThe region of [[Sunnm\u00f8re]] (to the north) was transferred from the [[Diocese of Nidaros]] to the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1622. The parish of [[Eidfjord]] was transferred from the [[Diocese of Stavanger]] to Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1630. The parish of [[R\u00f8ldal]] was transferred from the [[Diocese of Agder og Telemark|Diocese of Kristiansand]] to Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1863. The Sunnm\u00f8re region was removed from the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1983 when it, along with the regions of [[Nordm\u00f8re]] and [[Romsdal]] (from the [[Diocese of Nidaros]]), were established as a separate diocese, the [[Diocese of M\u00f8re]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://da2.uib.no/cgi-win/WebBok.exe?slag=lesbok&bokid=lampe|title=Bergen stifts biskoper og pr\u00e6ster|first=Johan Fredrik|last=Lampe|publisher=Cammermeyers Boghandel|location=Kristiania|year=1895}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\nThe [[Old Norse]] form of the name for Bergen was ''Bj\u01ebrgvin''.

In 1537, the diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin consisted of the (modern) counties of [[Hordaland]] and [[Sogn og Fjordane]] (with exception of the parishes of [[Eidfjord]] and [[R\u00f8ldal]]). \n\nThe region of [[Sunnm\u00f8re]] (to the north) was transferred from the [[Diocese of Nidaros]] to the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1622. The parish of [[Eidfjord]] was transferred from the [[Diocese of Stavanger]] to Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1630. The parish of [[R\u00f8ldal]] was transferred from the [[Diocese of Agder og Telemark|Diocese of Kristiansand]] to Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1863. The Sunnm\u00f8re region was removed from the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1983 when it, along with the regions of [[Nordm\u00f8re]] and [[Romsdal]] (from the [[Diocese of Nidaros]]), were established as a separate diocese, the [[Diocese of M\u00f8re]].<ref>{{cite book|url=http://da2.uib.no/cgi-win/WebBok.exe?slag=lesbok&bokid=lampe|title=Bergen stifts biskoper og pr\u00e6ster|first=Johan Fredrik|last=Lampe|publisher=Cammermeyers Boghandel|location=Kristiania|year=1895}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\nThe [[Old Norse]] form of the name for Bergen was ''Bj\u01ebrgvin''.

Poulsbo was founded in the 1880s by Norwegian immigrant J\u00f8rgen Eliason, who was joined by other Scandinavians who relocated from the [[Midwest|Midwestern states]]. They were drawn here by the availability of land, by the area's rich resources, and by a landscape similar to their native home. The settlement was connected by boats to other areas of the region, including the [[Puget Sound mosquito fleet]], which was eventually usurped by highways built in the early 20th century.\n\nModern-day downtown Poulsbo maintains a Scandinavian theme to honor its early immigrant history and is a popular regional tourist destination. One of its local products, [[Poulsbo Bread]], is made locally at Sluys Bakery and used to be sold internationally. Many visitors arrive by boat; there are three [[marina]]s near the town, and the town's harbor is an excellent anchorage.\n\n==History==\n[[File:First Lutheran Church of Poulsbo.jpg|thumb|left|First Lutheran Church of Poulsbo]]\n\nThe [[Suquamish]] people inhabited the area at the north end of [[Liberty Bay]] for millennia and had several names for modern-day Poulsbo; one of those names, ''tcu-tcu-lats'', means \"place of the maples\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northkitsapherald.com/business/311052921.html |title=Viking Avenue business owner will replace trees he cut down |work=North Kitsap Herald |date=June 30, 2015 |first=Richard |last=Walker |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}</ref> The Suquamish occupied villages on the Liberty Bay shoreline \u2014 among them, ''ho-CHEEB''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northkitsapherald.com/news/304004031.html |title=1 million Norwegians immigrated to U.S. between 1820 and 1920 {{!}} Viking Fest |work=North Kitsap Herald |date=May 16, 2015 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}</ref> \u2014 for at least 5,000 years, hunted in local forests and floodplains, fished in bays and streams here, and harvested shellfish along the shoreline.\n\nAfter the signing of the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, most Suquamish people here relocated to the [[Port Madison Indian Reservation]], although the Suquamish Tribe reserved \u2014 and to this day exercises \u2014 certain cultural and natural resource rights in its historical territory, including Poulsbo.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n[[File:Oyster dyke at Poulsbo, Washington, June 1920 (COBB 143).jpeg|thumb|[[Oyster farming]] in Poulsbo, 1920]]\n\nFounded by Norwegian immigrant J\u00f8rgen Eliason in the 1880s, Poulsbo was settled in its early years by a large number of [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] and other [[Scandinavia]]n immigrants because of its similarities to their native countries.<ref name=majors>{{Cite book| last = Majors | first = Harry M. | title = Exploring Washington | publisher = Van Winkle Publishing Co | year = 1975 | page = 82 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoWrPQAACAAJ| isbn = 978-0-918664-00-6}}</ref> In 1886, I.B. Moe, one of the early Norwegian settlers, suggested that the community should have a post office.

The community's petition for a post office was granted and Moe became the first postmaster, but authorities in Washington, D.C. misspelled the town's name, likely misreading Moe's handwriting,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} and the community became known as \"Poulsbo\" thereafter. Poulsbo was incorporated on December 18, 1907.\n\nUntil [[World War II]], many Poulsbo residents retained [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] as a primary language. However, during [[World War II]], the military constructed about 300 residential units to provide housing for workers at the nearby [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]]. The population of Poulsbo almost tripled over three years, and the diversification of the population led to the dominance of [[English language|English]] as the primary language.\n\nOn October 22, 1975, King [[Olav V of Norway]] visited Poulsbo as part of the celebration of 150 years of Norwegian immigration to the United States.<ref name=Jacobi>{{cite news | title = King at home in Poulsbo | newspaper = Seattle Post-Intelligencer | year = 1975 | url= http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=8361 }}</ref> His son, Harald, visited 20 years later.\n\n==Schools==\nPoulsbo is home to many different [[state school|public schools]] in the North Kitsap School District.

Poulsbo was founded in the 1880s by Norwegian immigrant J\u00f8rgen Eliason, who was joined by other Scandinavians who relocated from the [[Midwest|Midwestern states]]. They were drawn here by the availability of land, by the area's rich resources, and by a landscape similar to their native home. The settlement was connected by boats to other areas of the region, including the [[Puget Sound mosquito fleet]], which was eventually usurped by highways built in the early 20th century.\n\nModern-day downtown Poulsbo maintains a Scandinavian theme to honor its early immigrant history and is a popular regional tourist destination. One of its local products, [[Poulsbo Bread]], is made locally at Sluys Bakery and used to be sold internationally. Many visitors arrive by boat; there are three [[marina]]s near the town, and the town's harbor is an excellent anchorage.\n\n==History==\n[[File:First Lutheran Church of Poulsbo.jpg|thumb|left|First Lutheran Church of Poulsbo]]\n\nThe [[Suquamish]] people inhabited the area at the north end of [[Liberty Bay]] for millennia and had several names for modern-day Poulsbo; one of those names, ''tcu-tcu-lats'', means \"place of the maples\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northkitsapherald.com/business/311052921.html |title=Viking Avenue business owner will replace trees he cut down |work=North Kitsap Herald |date=June 30, 2015 |first=Richard |last=Walker |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}</ref> The Suquamish occupied villages on the Liberty Bay shoreline \u2014 among them, ''ho-CHEEB''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.northkitsapherald.com/news/304004031.html |title=1 million Norwegians immigrated to U.S. between 1820 and 1920 {{!}} Viking Fest |work=North Kitsap Herald |date=May 16, 2015 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}</ref> \u2014 for at least 5,000 years, hunted in local forests and floodplains, fished in bays and streams here, and harvested shellfish along the shoreline.\n\nAfter the signing of the [[Treaty of Point Elliott]] in 1855, most Suquamish people here relocated to the [[Port Madison Indian Reservation]], although the Suquamish Tribe reserved \u2014 and to this day exercises \u2014 certain cultural and natural resource rights in its historical territory, including Poulsbo.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\n[[File:Oyster dyke at Poulsbo, Washington, June 1920 (COBB 143).jpeg|thumb|[[Oyster farming]] in Poulsbo, 1920]]\n\nFounded by Norwegian immigrant J\u00f8rgen Eliason in the 1880s, Poulsbo was settled in its early years by a large number of [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] and other [[Scandinavia]]n immigrants because of its similarities to their native countries.<ref name=majors>{{Cite book| last = Majors | first = Harry M. | title = Exploring Washington | publisher = Van Winkle Publishing Co | year = 1975 | page = 82 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CoWrPQAACAAJ| isbn = 978-0-918664-00-6}}</ref> In 1886, I.B. Moe, one of the early Norwegian settlers, suggested that the community should have a post office. Moe suggested the town be named \"Paulsbo\" (which translates as \"Paul's place\"), after the village in [[Halden]], Norway,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://mapcarta.com/31279866 |title=Paulsbo |website=Mapcarta}}</ref> where Moe spent his early years. The community's petition for a post office was granted and Moe became the first postmaster, but authorities in Washington, D.C. misspelled the town's name, likely misreading Moe's handwriting,{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} and the community became known as \"Poulsbo\" thereafter. Poulsbo was incorporated on December 18, 1907.\n\nUntil [[World War II]], many Poulsbo residents retained [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] as a primary language. However, during [[World War II]], the military constructed about 300 residential units to provide housing for workers at the nearby [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]]. The population of Poulsbo almost tripled over three years, and the diversification of the population led to the dominance of [[English language|English]] as the primary language.\n\nOn October 22, 1975, King [[Olav V of Norway]] visited Poulsbo as part of the celebration of 150 years of Norwegian immigration to the United States.<ref name=Jacobi>{{cite news | title = King at home in Poulsbo | newspaper = Seattle Post-Intelligencer | year = 1975 | url= http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=8361 }}</ref> His son, Harald, visited 20 years later.\n\n==Schools==\nPoulsbo is home to many different [[state school|public schools]] in the North Kitsap School District.

Elias is run over by Marianna and dies of injuries in the episode aired on November 7, 2016. In the episode aired on March 17, 2017, Elias appears in Marianna's [[hallucination]]s and in Lari's dream.\n\n==Childhood==\nElias is born to Sebastian Vuorela and Ritva \"Cindy\" Rintala, but Cindy cannot raise the boy alone as Sebastian is in jail. Cindy decides that Elias be adopted, and therefore Meri Vikstedt becomes his guardian. Years later Sebastian bumps into his son when he is doing janitor work and defends Elias against bully boys. Soon Sebastian wants to know his son better and to meet him in [[Finland]], but Meri works in Brussels and Elias therefore moves abroad with his mother.\n\n==Elias' return==\nTeenage Elias returns to Finland to escape his mother's [[Homophobia|homophobic]] boyfriend Vincent. Eventually Sebastian and Meri agree that Elias permanently move to Finland. Elias soon becomes friends with Iida Mustonen, Tale Taalasmaa, and Janne Haukkala. Elias is at that time openly gay. He starts school with his new friends in Finland soon after the case of his father's missing twin brother. On his first day at school Elias encounters Lari, who starts bullying him because of his homosexuality. The bullying continues when Lari and Iida start dating. Soon Elias meets Cindy, and though there are difficulties at the beginning, the two begin to build some kind of mother-son relationship.\n\nSoon Elias has a crush on Joonatan Sievinen and kisses him after having misunderstood that Joonatan was gay. After that he begins seeing Ville, with whom he has a budding relationship. Ville however ends up kissing another man at a costume party, whereupon Elias breaks up with him. After the costume party the hockey team chases Elias, but eventually Lari, the leader of the gang, kisses Elias.\n\n==Relationships==\n===Lari V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen===\nWhen Lari kisses him Elias realises that Lari is gay as well. Elias soon develops feelings for Lari. Eventually Elias and Lari end up in bed. Though Lari is distressed and avoids Elias at the beginning, it soon becomes clear that the two cannot be separated. Lari gets angry at Elias when he finds out that Elias has told Tale about their kiss. Elias gets a concussion while he is trying to make up with Lari in the ice hall. Concerned, Lari finally has to admit to Elias that he cares about him. Lari leaves Iida and starts a relationship with Elias. Their affair does not remain secret for long, and the friendship between Elias and Iida breaks up when Iida realises that Lari has betrayed her with Elias.\n\nLari's and Elias' affair has a temporary break as well when Lari decides to focus on ice hockey and to go to the training camp in Canada. Lari's [[homosexuality]] is revealed to the whole school and Lari, after having been beaten up, has to stop playing [[ice hockey]]. In the end Elias comforts Lari, and the two get back together and try to have a more public relationship.\n\nHowever, Elias starts to become [[Anxiety|anxious]] because of Lari, who does not dare to be himself in public or to show affection for him publicly. Eventually Lari tells his father Ilkka about his homosexuality, whose strict attitude forces Lari to escape and to live with Elias. Ilkka does not give up easily, but does everything to keep Lari away from Elias. Eventually Lari gives in to his father and goes to a sexual recuperation camp, and Elias no longer stays in the difficult relationship. Elias ends up cheating on Lari with Miska Koistinen, which Lari soon finds out. The two try to make up and Lari leaves his father, but Elias decides to move on with his life. Elias and Lari have continued the relationship for years until Elias' death.\n\n===Miska Koistinen===\nElias starts dating Miska because he wants a long, public and open relationship. However, Elias soon finds out that Miska has been lying to him about helping Lari, who has been living in the streets back then, behind his back. Elias also ends up kissing Lari on Lari's birthday and starts feeling uncertain about who he really wants to be with. However, encouraged by his friends and his father, he decides to continue his relationship with Miska and eventually gets engaged with him. At Katharina M\u00e4kel\u00e4'a ball, Elias is shot and sent to the hospital. Soon he tells Lari that he only wants to be friends with him, which pushes Lari to go on to have a relationship with Kalle Laitela. However, Elias soon starts to show jealousy when he sees that Lari was fully himself with Kalle in public. Soon Elias finds out that Miska has been secretly seeing his ex-boyfriend Jonne. Elias is convinced that Miska has cheated on him.\n\n==The kidnapping==\nHaving encountered problems with Miska in their relationship. Elias ends up getting intimate with Lari. Lari is also having problems in his relationship with Kalle. Elias and Lari end up kissing. Soon the two begin investigating Lari's cousin Marianna's past, suspecting that she is mentally ill. Elias and Lari get closer and end up in bed. They, however, try to keep their relationships with Miska and Kalle, but they do not get the chance to, as Marianna, who is afraid of being caught, kidnaps the boys and tells everyone that the two have slept together and gone on a romantic vacation. Eventually Janne, Miska and Kalle trace the captives. Marianna has also kidnapped Janne and Heidi in her small jail room. Later Miska and Kalle come to rescue the captives from Marianna's prison, which has been built in Marianna's room in her and Heidi's home.\n\n===After the kidnapping===\nThe relationship between Elias and Miska ends soon after the kidnapping because Elias still has feelings for Lari and Miska does not want to continue the relationship anymore. Elias tries to get back together with Lari, but Lari chooses Kalle. Miska wants to get back together with Elias after having left Jonne as he realises he still loves Elias. They try to have a relationship again, but Elias decides to leave for Brussels to live with his adoptive mother Meri to \"get some fresh air for a while\".\n\nElias, however, comes back in autumn 2015. He soon works for Aki Nikkinen's Vinotar and performs well at work. Elias takes care of Moose's and Vinotar's cooperation together with Lari.\n\nLater Elias finds out that Lari has discovered the identity of the kidnapper of Sanni's and Tale's son Ilja and left for the kidnapper's home. Elias goes to Lari with Sergei's illegal gun, which has been left at Sebastian's home. In the kidnapper's apartment there is a scuffle and as a result, the gun goes off and Lari is shot in the side, from which Lari later recovers. Elias' and Lari's love continues to flourish while Lari is recovering, but Elias finds out that Marianna has miscarried Sebastian's baby. Elias gives Marianna a day to tell the truth, but Marianna drives over Elias and kills him, when Elias is on his way to meet Lari for his proposal.\n\n==Love life==\n*Joonatan Sievinen: Elias kisses and has an unrequited infatuation with Joonatan, but Joonatan is straight and does not return Elias' feelings\n*Ville Kurtti: ex-boyfriend\n*Lari V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen: boyfriend until Elias' death\n*Miska Koistinen: ex-fianc\u00e9\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Vikstedt, Elias}}\n[[Category:Fictional LGBT characters in television]]\n[[Category:Fictional Finnish people]]\n[[Category:Fictional gay males]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{in-universe|date=June 2017}}\n{{more footnotes|date=June 2017}}\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2017}}\n{{Underlinked|date=December 2017}}\n}}\n{{Infobox character\n| series = [[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t]]\n| name = Elias Vikstedt\n| lbl1 = Actor(s)\n| data1 = Niilo Heinonen (2010)<br>Petteri Paavola (2011\u20132016, 2017)\n| lbl2 = Years active\n| data2 = 2010, 2011\u20132016, 2017\n| lbl3 = First appearance\n| data3 = Episode 1899: The past resonates with Cindy<br/> (March 25, 2010)\n| lbl4 = Last appearance\n| data4 = Episode 3162: Larias hand in hand<br/> (March 23, 2017)\n| lbl5 = Full name\n| data5 = Elias Vikstedt\n| occupation = Student\n| gender = Male\n| lbl21 = Age\n| data21 = 20\n| lbl22 = Birthplace\n| data22 = Helsinki\n| lbl23 = Residence\n| data23 = Helsinki\n| lbl24 = Cause of death\n| data24 = Run over by Marianna Kurki\n| extra-hdr = Relations\n| lbl25 = Parents\n| data25 = Sebastian Vuorela<br/>Cindy Rintala<br/>Meri Vikstedt (adoptive mother)<br/>\n| lbl31 = Siblings\n| data31 = Oliver Vuorela (stepbrother)<br/>Alexander Holm (stepbrother)(deceased)<br/>Iida Mustonen (stepsister)\n| spouse = Miska Koistinen (ex-fianc\u00e9)<br/>Lari V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen (fianc\u00e9 until Elias' death)\n| lbl32 = Grandparents\n| data32 = Olavi Kanerva<br/>Helena Kuula<br/>Johannes Rintala<br/>Martta Rintala<br/>\n| lbl33 = Uncles and aunts\n| data33 = Sergei Kuula (deceased)<br/>Antti Polvij\u00e4rvi<br/>Niina Kanerva (step-aunt)<br/>Matleena Rintala<br/>\n| lbl34 = Cousin\n| data34 = Taiga Kuula\n| lbl35 = Acquaintances\n| data35 = Onni Taalasmaa<br/>Janne Haukkala<br/>Sanni Pohjonen<br/>Marianna Kurki<br/>Isabella Holm<br/>Katariina M\u00e4kel\u00e4<br/>Kalle Laitela<br/>Ismo Laitela\n}}\n\n'''Elias Vikstedt''' (February 10, 1996 \u2013 May 10, 2016; on television November 7, 2016)<ref>Revealed in the tombstone part in episode 3155</ref> was a fictional character on the Finnish [[Television show|television series]] ''[[Salatut el\u00e4m\u00e4t]]''.
