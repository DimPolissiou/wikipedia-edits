Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as '''Pippali''' in a ''[[brahmin]]'' caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a distinct section of several collections of texts. In the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li tradition]], this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family. When she approached the image, however, people noticed that the image appeared ugly compared to her. Her reputation of beauty spread, and soon after Pippali's family learned about her, she was offered in marriage to Pippali.<!--111-->{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nNext, in the P\u0101li version of the story, the two exchanged letters to indicate their lack of interest, only to find their letters intercepted by their parents and being forced to marry anyway.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}} In the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, however, Pippali went to visit Bhadra, and without revealing his identity, told her that her future husband would be a bad choice for her, because he had no interest in sensual pleasures.

A similar monk called Bakkula completely withdrew from teaching for similar reasons, which led him to emphasize ascetic values even more than Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, to compensate and still be worthy of support from lay people. Such an ideal of an enlightened disciple with ascetic values, as depicted in Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and in a more extreme form in Bakkula, could reflect sentiments and inclinations among some groups of early Buddhists,<!--19--> and may have contributed to how [[Mahayana|Mah\u0101y\u0101na]] authors later polemicized against what they perceived as \"selfish arahants\".<!--20 note 58-->{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |pp=19\u201320, note 58}}\n\nClarke argues that the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa as a detached ascetic was the way he was \"branded\" by the early Buddhists to the public in general.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was mostly associated with the texts of monastic discipline, during the fourth century until early third century BCE when Buddhism was prominent in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vai\u015b\u0101l\u012b]].{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}} Bareau, Przyluski and Indologist [[I.

This may have been the work of the translators.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=303}} In Mah\u0101y\u0101na iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often depicted flanking the Buddha at the left side, together with \u0100nanda at the right.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Er xieshi}} The two disciples have been very popular in art depictions since the time of [[Greco-Buddhism]],<!--417--> and Migot argued that the tradition of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and \u0100nanda being the Buddha's two main disciples was older than that of the tradition of \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, because in the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' only the former pair features, and the traditional explanation for this that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana did not outlive the Buddha seems unconvincing.<!--536-->{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=417, 536}}{{refn |group=note |As for Therav\u0101da iconography, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is usually not depicted flanking the Buddha.{{sfn |Edkins |2013 |pages=42\u201343}}}} In Chan temples, the image of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is often placed in a central position, being the first patriarch of the tradition.{{sfn |Jorgensen |2000 |pp=158, 271}} In the history of Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism, as the rag-robe asceticism of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa contributed to his legendary figure and the legitimation of the Mah\u0101y\u0101na creed, rag-robes became an icon in East Asian Buddhism.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa assumed leadership of the [[Sangha|monastic community]] following the ''[[Paranirvana|paranirv\u0101\u1e47a]]'' (death) of the Buddha, presiding over the [[First Buddhist council|First Buddhist Council]]. He was considered to be the first [[zushi (Buddhism)|patriarch]] in a number of [[early Buddhism|early Buddhist schools]] and continued to have an important role as patriarch in the [[Chan Buddhism|Chan]] and [[Zen]] traditions. In Buddhist texts, he assumed many identities, that of a renunciant saint, a lawgiver, an anti-establishment figure, but also a \"guarantor of future justice\" in the time of [[Maitreya]], the future Buddha{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=117}}{{em dash}}he has been described as \"both the anchorite and the friend of mankind, even of the outcast\".{{sfn |Rhys Davids |1914 |p=160}}\n\nIn canonical Buddhist texts in several traditions, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born as '''Pippali''' in a ''[[brahmin]]'' caste family, and entered an arranged marriage with a woman named [[Bhadda Kapilani|Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b]]. Both of them aspired to lead a celibate life, however, and they decided not to consummate their marriage. Having grown weary of the agricultural profession and the damage it did, they both left the lay life behind to become mendicants. Pippali later met the Buddha, under whom he was [[upasampada|ordained as a monk]], named ''K\u0101\u015byapa'', but later called ''Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa'' to distinguish him from other disciples. Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa became an important disciple of the Buddha, to the extent that the Buddha exchanged his [[Kasaya (clothing)|robe]] with him, which was a symbol of the transmittance of the [[Buddha's Dispensation|Buddhist teaching]]. He became foremost in [[dhutanga|ascetic practices]] and attained [[enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]] shortly after. He often had disputes with [[\u0100nanda]], the attendant of the Buddha, due to their different dispositions and views. Despite his ascetic, strict and stern reputation, he paid an interest in community matters and teaching, and was known for his compassion for the poor, which sometimes caused him to be depicted as an anti-establishment figure. He had a prominent role in the cremation of the Buddha, acting as a sort of eldest son of the Buddha, as well as being the leader in the subsequent First Council. He is depicted as hesitatingly allowing \u0100nanda to participate in the council, and chastising him afterwards for a number of offenses the latter was regarded to have committed.\n\nMah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's life as described in the early Buddhist texts has been considerably studied by scholars, who have been skeptical about his role in the cremation, his role toward \u0100nanda and the historicity of the council itself. A number of scholars have hypothesized that the accounts have later been embellished to emphasize the values of the Buddhist establishment Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa stood for, emphasizing [[vinaya|monastic discipline]], ''brahmin'' and ascetic values, as opposed to the values of \u0100nanda and other disciples. Regardless, it is clear that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa had an important role in the early days of the Buddhist community after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a'', to help establish a stable monastic tradition. He effectively became the leader for the first twenty years after the Buddha, as he had become the most influential figure in the monastic community. For this reason, he was regarded by many early Buddhist schools as a sort of first patriarch, and was seen to have started a [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]] of patriarchs of Buddhism.\n\nIn many post-canonical texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa decided at the end of his life to enter a state of [[Nirodha-sam\u0101patti|meditation and suspended animation]], which was believed to cause his physical remains to stay intact in a cave under a mountain called [[Kukku\u1e6dap\u0101da]], until the coming of Maitreya Buddha. This story has led to several [[cult (religious practice)|cults]] and practices, and affected some Buddhist countries up until early modern times. It has been interpreted by scholars as a narrative to physically connect Gautama Buddha and Maitreya Buddha, through the body of Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa and Gautama Buddha's robe, which covered Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's remains. In Chan Buddhism, this account was less emphasized, but Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was seen to have received a special mind-to-mind transmission from Gautama Buddha outside of orthodox scripture, which became essential to the identity of Chan. Again, the robe was an important symbol in this transmission. Apart from having a role in texts and lineage, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa has often been depicted in Buddhist art as a symbol of reassurance and hope for the future of Buddhism.\n\n== In early Buddhist texts ==\nIn the [[Early Buddhist Texts]] of several textual traditions, a dozen [[sutra|discourses]] attributed to Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa have been compiled in a distinct section of several collections of texts. In the [[Pali Canon|P\u0101li tradition]], this is part of the collection called the ''[[Sa\u1e43yutta Nik\u0101ya]]'', and in [[Chinese Buddhist canon|Chinese Buddhist texts]], the collection is called the ''[[\u0100gama (Buddhism)#Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama|Sa\u1e43yukta \u0100gama]]''. The latter collection contains two versions of the section on Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa, numbered [[Taisho Tripitaka|Taish\u014d]] 2:99 and 2:100.{{sfn |Mun-keat |2017 |p=295}} The Chinese ''[[Ekottara Agama|Ekottara \u0100gama]]'' also contains a passage that runs parallel to the P\u0101li ''Sa\u1e43yutta'', T2:99 and T2:100, describing a meeting between the Buddha and Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa,{{sfn |Analayo |2015 |pp=12\u201321}} and another passage about him and the monk [[Bakkula]].{{sfn |Analayo |2010 |p=1}} Finally, there are also [[Vinaya]] texts from the [[M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da]] tradition about Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa in the [[Tibetan Buddhist canon|Tibetan language]].{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |p=110}}\n\n=== Early life ===\n[[File:Pipphali.jpg|thumb|Pippala Cave in [[Rajgir]], where Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa is recorded to have stayed.{{sfn |Bapat |1956 |p=319}}]]\nP\u0101li accounts relate that Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was born Pippali in a ''[[brahmin]]'' family in a village called Mah\u0101tittha, in the kingdom of [[Magadha]], present-day India.{{sfn |Karaluvinna |2002 |p=435}} His father was a wealthy landlord who in some sources is named Nyagrodha, and in other sources Kapila or Kosigotta; his mother was Suman\u0101dev\u012b.{{refn |For the father's occupation, see {{harvtxt |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Bhadra-Kapil\u0101n\u012b}}.

However, her parents wanted her to marry, and to please her mother, she agreed to pay her respects to a shrine of a goddess known for granting a marriage in a high-class family. When she approached the image, however, people noticed that the image appeared ugly compared to her. Her reputation of beauty spread, and soon after Pippali's family learned about her, she was offered in marriage to Pippali.<!--111-->{{sfn |Clarke |2014 |pp=110\u2013111}}\n\nNext, in the P\u0101li version of the story, the two exchanged letters to indicate their lack of interest, only to find their letters intercepted by their parents and being forced to marry anyway.{{sfn |Buswell |Lopez |2013 |loc=Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa}} In the M\u016blasarv\u0101stiv\u0101da version of the story, however, Pippali went to visit Bhadra, and without revealing his identity, told her that her future husband would be a bad choice for her, because he had no interest in sensual pleasures.

However, in the accounts about the First Council, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa appears very prominent, whereas \u0100nanda is humbled and given far less credit.

These differences have affected the scriptures of each tradition:{{refn |See {{harvtxt |Findly |1992 |pages=253}}.

Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa was mostly associated with the texts of monastic discipline, during the fourth century until early third century BCE when Buddhism was prominent in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vai\u015b\u0101l\u012b]].{{sfn |Migot |1954 |pp=540\u2013541}} Bareau, Przyluski and Indologist [[I.

Scholar of religion Ellison Banks Findly disagrees, however, because the account in the texts of monastic discipline fits in with the ''Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta'' and with \u0100nanda's character as generally depicted in the texts.{{sfn |Findly |1992 |p=268}} Minayev thought the charges were an ancient tradition, because they are not usually the material of legends, because the Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] (602\u2013664) reported about a ''[[stupa|st\u016bpa]]'' ({{lang-pi|th\u016bpa|italic=yes}}; a memorial mound or monument) that was erected in memory of the event,<!--31--> and because the ambiguity about what constitutes major and minor rules would have been typical for that period.<!--32-->{{sfn |Minayev |1894 |pp=31\u201332}}\n\nExpanding on the theory of the two factions, Przyluski noted that the figure of \u0100nanda represents Buddhism in an early form, whereas Mah\u0101ka\u015byapa represents a Buddhism that had undergone reform. \u0100nanda represents a \"religion of love\", whereas Mah\u0101ka\u015byapa represents \"a rough ascetic spirit\".{{sfn |Analayo |2016 |p=172, note 75}} Migot interpreted \u0100nanda's figure as a devotionalist form of Buddhism focused on the guru, replaced by Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's established monasticism with less focus on devotion.{{sfn |Ray |1994 |p=147 note 57}}\n\nAlthough the Buddha did not appoint a formal successor, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's leading role and seniority effectively made him the head of the ''sa\u1e43gha'' during the first twenty years after the Buddha's ''parinirv\u0101\u1e47a''.{{sfn |Heim |2004 |p=468}} After the passing away of the Buddha and his close disciples \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana, he had become the most influential figure in the Buddhist order.{{sfn |Hirakawa |1990 |pp=84\u201385}} In the Early Buddhist Texts, Mah\u0101k\u0101\u015byapa's death is not discussed.

The strait is split by the [[Tsushima Island]] into the Western Channel and the [[Tsushima Strait]] or Eastern Channel.\n\n==Geography==\nTo the north it is bounded by the southern coast of the [[Korean Peninsula]], and to the south by the southwestern [[Japanese islands]] of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] and [[Honsh\u016b]]. It is about {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide and averages about 90 to 100&nbsp;meters (300&nbsp;ft) deep.\n\nTsushima Island divides the Korea Strait into the western channel and the Tsushima Strait. The western channel is deeper (up to 227&nbsp;meters) and narrower than the Tsushima Strait.\n\n==Currents==\nA branch of the [[Kuroshio Current]] passes through the strait. Its warm branch is sometimes called the Tsushima Current. Originating along the Japanese islands this current passes through the [[Sea of Japan]] then divides along either shore of  [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin Island]], eventually flowing into the northern Pacific Ocean via the strait north of [[Hokkaid\u014d]] and into the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] north of Sakhalin Island near [[Vladivostok]]. The water-mass characteristics vary widely because of the low-salinity waters of the southeast coasts of Korea and China.\n\n==Economic significance==\nNumerous international shipping lanes pass through the strait, including those carrying much of the traffic bound for the ports of southern South Korea. Both South Korea and Japan have restricted their territorial claims in the strait to {{convert|3|nmi|km}} from shore, so as to permit free passage through it.{{Ref|vandyke2}}{{Ref|vandyke3}}\n\nPassenger ferries travel numerous routes across the strait.

The strait is split by the [[Tsushima Island]] into the Western Channel and the [[Tsushima Strait]] or Eastern Channel.\n\n==Geography==\nTo the north it is bounded by the southern coast of the [[Korean Peninsula]], and to the south by the southwestern [[Japanese islands]] of [[Ky\u016bsh\u016b]] and [[Honsh\u016b]]. It is about {{convert|200|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide and averages about 90 to 100&nbsp;meters (300&nbsp;ft) deep.\n\nTsushima Island divides the Korea Strait into the western channel and the Tsushima Strait. The western channel is deeper (up to 227&nbsp;meters) and narrower than the Tsushima Strait.\n\n==Currents==\nA branch of the [[Kuroshio Current]] passes through the strait. Its warm branch is sometimes called the Tsushima Current. Originating along the Japanese islands this current passes through the [[Sea of Japan]] then divides along either shore of  [[Sakhalin|Sakhalin Island]], eventually flowing into the northern Pacific Ocean via the strait north of [[Hokkaid\u014d]] and into the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] north of Sakhalin Island near [[Vladivostok]]. The water-mass characteristics vary widely because of the low-salinity waters of the southeast coasts of Korea and China.\n\n==Economic significance==\nNumerous international shipping lanes pass through the strait, including those carrying much of the traffic bound for the ports of southern South Korea. Both South Korea and Japan have restricted their territorial claims in the strait to {{convert|3|nmi|km}} from shore, so as to permit free passage through it.{{Ref|vandyke2}}{{Ref|vandyke3}}\n\nPassenger ferries travel numerous routes across the strait.

Another key distinction is between traditional [[small molecule|small-molecule]] drugs, usually derived from [[chemical synthesis]], and [[biopharmaceutical]]s, which include [[recombinant proteins]], [[vaccine]]s, [[blood product]]s used [[therapy|therapeutically]] (such as [[IVIG]]), [[gene therapy]], [[Monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]] and [[cell therapy]] (for instance, [[stem cell|stem-cell]] therapies). Other ways to classify medicines are by mode of action, [[route of administration]], [[biological system]] affected, or [[therapeutic effect]]s. An elaborate and widely used classification system is the [[Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System]] (ATC system). The [[World Health Organization]] keeps a list of [[essential medicines]].\n\n[[Drug discovery]] and [[drug development]] are complex and expensive endeavors undertaken by [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]], academic scientists, and governments. As a result of this complex path from discovery to commercialization, partnering has become a standard practice for advancing drug candidates through development pipelines.  Governments generally regulate what drugs can be marketed, [[pharmaceutical marketing|how drugs are marketed]], and in some jurisdictions, drug pricing.   Controversies have arisen over drug pricing and disposal of used drugs.\n\n==Definition==\nIn Europe, the term is \"medicinal product\", and it is defined by EU law as:\n\n* \"Any substance or combination of substances presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings; or\"\n* \"Any substance or combination of substances which may be used in or administered to human beings either with a view to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions by exerting a [[pharmacological]], [[immunological]] or metabolic action, or to making a [[medical diagnosis]].\"<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-1/dir_2004_27/dir_2004_27_en.pdf Directive 2004/27/EC] Official Journal of the European Union. 30 April 2004 L136</ref>{{rp|36}}\n\nIn the US, a \"drug\" is:\n* A substance recognized by an official pharmacopeia or formulary.\n* A substance intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.\n* A substance (other than [[food]]) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n* A substance intended for use as a component of a medicine but not a device or a component, part or accessory of a device.\n* Biological products are included within this definition and are generally covered by the same laws and regulations, but differences exist regarding their manufacturing processes (chemical process versus biological process).<ref>FDA [https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ucm079436.htm Glossary]</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nDrug use among elderly Americans has been studied; in a group of 2377 people with average age of 71 surveyed between 2005 and 2006, 84% took at least one prescription drug, 44% took at least one [[over-the-counter]] (OTC) drug, and 52% took at least one [[dietary supplement]]; in a group of 2245 elderly Americans (average age of 71) surveyed over the period 2010 \u2013 2011, those percentages were 88%, 38%, and 64%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Qato DM|last2=Wilder J|last3=Schumm L|last4=Gillet V|last5=Alexander G|date=1 April 2016|title=Changes in prescription and over-the-counter medication and dietary supplement use among older adults in the united states, 2005 vs 2011|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=176|issue=4|pages=473\u2013482|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.8581|pmid=26998708 |pmc=5024734}}</ref>\n\n== Classification ==\n{{main|Drug class}}\nOne of the key classifications is between traditional [[small molecule]] drugs; usually derived from chemical synthesis, and [[biologic medical product]]s; which include [[recombinant proteins]], [[vaccines]], [[blood products]] used therapeutically (such as [[IVIG]]), [[gene therapy]], and [[cell therapy]] (for instance, [[stem cell]] therapies).\n\nPharmaceuticals or drugs or medicines are classified in various other groups besides their origin on the basis of pharmacological properties like mode of action and their pharmacological action or activity,<ref>http://www.epgonline.org database of prescription pharmaceutical products including drug classifications [http://www.epgonline.org/class.cfm]</ref> such as by [[chemical property|chemical properties]], mode or [[route of administration]], [[biological system]] affected, or [[therapeutic effect]]s.

Frequencies are often abbreviated from Latin, such as ''every 8 hours'' reading Q8H from ''Quaque VIII Hora''.\n\n==Drug discovery==\n{{clear left}}\n{{Main|Drug discovery}}\nIn the fields of [[medicine]], [[biotechnology]] and [[pharmacology]], drug discovery is the process by which new drugs are discovered.\n\nHistorically, drugs were discovered through identifying the active ingredient from traditional remedies or by [[serendipity|serendipitous]] discovery.  Later [[chemical library|chemical libraries]] of synthetic [[small molecule]]s, [[natural product]]s or [[extract]]s were screened in intact cells or whole organisms to identify substances that have a desirable [[therapeutic]] effect in a process known as\n[[classical pharmacology]].  Since [[Human Genome Project|sequencing]] of the [[human genome]] which allowed rapid cloning and synthesis of large quantities of purified proteins, it has become common practice to use [[high throughput screening]] of large compounds libraries against isolated [[biological target]]s which are hypothesized to be disease-modifying in a process known as [[reverse pharmacology]].  Hits from these screens are then tested in cells and then in animals for [[efficacy]].  Even more recently, scientists have been able to understand the shape of biological molecules at the atomic level, and to use that knowledge to design (see [[drug design]]) drug candidates.\n\nModern drug discovery involves the identification of screening hits, [[medicinal chemistry]] and optimization of those hits to increase the [[Affinity (pharmacology)#Protein-ligand binding|affinity]], [[binding selectivity|selectivity]] (to reduce the potential of side effects), efficacy/[[potency (pharmacology)|potency]], [[Metabolism|metabolic]] stability (to increase the [[Biological half-life|half-life]]), and oral [[bioavailability]]. Once a compound that fulfills all of these requirements has been identified, it will begin the process of [[drug development]] prior to [[clinical trial]]s. One or more of these steps may, but not necessarily, involve [[computer-aided drug design]].\n\nDespite advances in technology and understanding of biological systems, drug discovery is still a lengthy, \"expensive, difficult, and inefficient process\" with low rate of new therapeutic discovery.<ref name=Anson2009>{{Cite news\n |last1=Anson\n |first1=Blake D.\n |last2=Ma\n |first2=Junyi\n |last3=He\n |first3=Jia-Qiang\n |date=1 May 2009\n |title=Identifying Cardiotoxic Compounds\n |periodical=Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News\n |series=TechNote\n |publisher=Mary Ann Liebert\n |volume=29\n |issue=9\n |pages=34\u201335\n |url=http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem_print.aspx?aid=2890&chid=0\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921025805/http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem_print.aspx?aid=2890&chid=0\n |archivedate=21 September 2012\n |issn=1935-472X\n |oclc=77706455\n |accessdate=25 July 2009\n |url-status=dead\n |df=\n}}</ref> In 2010, the research and development cost of each [[new molecular entity]] (NME) was approximately US$1.8 billion.<ref>{{cite journal | volume = 9 | pages = 203\u2013214 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1038/nrd3078 | title = How to improve R&D productivity: the pharmaceutical industry's grand challenge |author1=Steven M.

In some countries, such as the United States, they are regulated at the national level by a single agency. In other jurisdictions they are regulated at the state level, or at both state and national levels by various bodies, as is the case in Australia.  The role of therapeutic goods regulation is designed mainly to protect the health and safety of the population. Regulation is aimed at ensuring the safety, quality, and efficacy of the therapeutic goods which are covered under the scope of the regulation. In most jurisdictions, therapeutic goods must be registered before they are allowed to be marketed. There is usually some degree of restriction of the availability of certain therapeutic goods depending on their risk to consumers.\n\nDepending upon the [[jurisdiction]], drugs may be divided into [[over-the-counter drug]]s (OTC) which may be available without special restrictions, and [[prescription drug]]s, which must be [[Medical prescription|prescribed]] by a licensed medical practitioner in accordance with [[medical guideline]]s due to the risk of adverse effects and [[contraindication]]s. The precise distinction between OTC and prescription depends on the legal [[jurisdiction]]. A third category, \"behind-the-counter\" drugs, is implemented in some jurisdictions. These do not require a prescription, but must be kept in the [[dispensary]], not visible to the public, and only be sold by a [[pharmacist]] or [[pharmacy technician]]. Doctors may also prescribe prescription drugs for [[off-label use]] \u2013 purposes which the drugs were not originally approved for by the regulatory agency. The [[Classification of Pharmaco-Therapeutic Referrals]] helps guide the referral process between pharmacists and doctors.\n\nThe [[International Narcotics Control Board]] of the [[United Nations]] imposes a world law of [[prohibition]] of certain drugs. They publish a lengthy list of chemicals and plants whose trade and consumption (where applicable) is forbidden. OTC drugs are sold without restriction as they are considered safe enough that most people will not hurt themselves accidentally by taking it as instructed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medication Safety|url=http://www.housefindings.com/tips-for-medication-safety/|website=House Findings|accessdate=21 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914133316/http://www.housefindings.com/tips-for-medication-safety/|archive-date=14 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Many countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] have a third category of \"pharmacy medicines\", which can only be sold in registered [[pharmacy|pharmacies]] by or under the supervision of a [[pharmacist]].\n\n[[Medical error]]s include overprescription and [[polypharmacy]], misprescription, contraindication and lack of detail in dosage and administrations instructions.

Penicillin, introduced a few years later, provided a broader spectrum of activity compared to sulfa drugs and reduced side effects. Streptomycin, found in 1942, proved to be the first drug effective against the cause of tuberculosis and also came to be the best known of a long series of important antibiotics. A second generation of antibiotics was introduced in the 1940s: aureomycin and chloramphenicol. Aureomycin was the best known of the second generation.\n\nLithium was discovered in the 19th century for nervous disorders and its possible mood-stabilizing or prophylactic effect; it was cheap and easily produced. As lithium fell out of favor in France, valpromide came into play. This antibiotic was the origin of the drug that eventually created the mood stabilizer category. Valpromide had distinct psychotrophic effects that were of benefit in both the treatment of acute manic states and in the maintenance treatment of manic depression illness. Psychotropics can either be sedative or stimulant; sedatives aim at damping down the extremes of behavior. Stimulants aim at restoring normality by increasing tone. Soon arose the notion of a tranquilizer which was quite different from any sedative or stimulant. The term tranquilizer took over the notions of sedatives and became the dominant term in the West through the 1980s. In Japan, during this time, the term tranquilizer produced the notion of a psyche-stabilizer and the term mood stabilizer vanished.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\">Tone, Andrea and Elizabeth Watkins, ''Medicating Modern America: Prescription Drugs in History''.

HRT is not a life-saving drug, nor does it cure any disease. HRT has been prescribed to improve one's quality of life. Doctors prescribe estrogen for their older female patients both to treat short-term menopausal symptoms and to prevent long-term diseases. In the 1960s and early 1970s, more and more physicians began to prescribe estrogen for their female patients. between 1991 and 1999, Premarin was listed as the most popular prescription and best-selling drug in America.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\" />\n\nThe first oral contraceptive, Enovid, was approved by FDA in 1960. Oral contraceptives inhibit ovulation and so prevent conception. Enovid was known to be much more effective than alternatives including the condom and the diaphragm. As early as 1960, oral contraceptives were available in several different strengths by every manufacturer. In the 1980s and 1990s, an increasing number of options arose including, most recently, a new [[drug delivery|delivery system]] for the oral contraceptive via a transdermal patch. In 1982, a new version of the Pill was introduced, known as the \"biphasic\" pill. By 1985, a new triphasic pill was approved. Physicians began to think of the Pill as an excellent means of birth control for young women.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\" />\n\nStimulants such as Ritalin (methylphenidate) came to be pervasive tools for behavior management and modification in young children. Ritalin was first marketed in 1955 for narcolepsy; its potential users were middle-aged and the elderly. It wasn't until some time in the 1980s along with hyperactivity in children that Ritalin came onto the market. Medical use of methlyphenidate is predominantly for symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Consumption of methylphenidate in the U.S. out-paced all other countries between 1991 and 1999. Significant growth in consumption was also evident in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Norway. Currently, 85% of the world's methylphanidate is consumed in America.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\" />\n\nThe first minor tranquilizer was Meprobamate. Only fourteen months after it was made available, meprobamate had become the country's largest-selling prescription drug. By 1957, meprobamate had become the fastest-growing drug in history. The popularity of meprobamate paved the way for Librium and Valium, two minor tranquilizers that belonged to a new chemical class of drugs called the benzodiazepines. These were drugs that worked chiefly as anti-anxiety agents and muscle relaxants. The first benzodiazepine was Librium. Three months after it was approved, Librium had become the most prescribed tranquilizer in the nation. Three years later, Valium hit the shelves and was ten times more effective as a muscle relaxant and anti-convulsant. Valium was the most versatile of the minor tranquilizers. Later came the widespread adoption of major tranquilizers such as chlorpromazine and the drug reserpine. In 1970, sales began to decline for Valium and Librium, but sales of new and improved tranquilizers, such as Xanax, introduced in 1981 for the newly created diagnosis of panic disorder, soared.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\" />\n\nMevacor (lovastatin) is the first and most influential statin in the American market.

Although often accepted as an advance in some ways, there was some opposition, due to serious adverse effects such as [[tardive dyskinesia]]. Patients often opposed psychiatry and refused or stopped taking the drugs when not subject to psychiatric control.\n\nGovernments have been heavily involved in the regulation of drug development and drug sales. In the U.S., the [[Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster]] led to the establishment of the [[Food and Drug Administration]], and the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act required manufacturers to file new drugs with the FDA. The 1951 Humphrey-Durham Amendment required certain drugs to be sold by prescription.

As more drugs became prescribed for chronic illnesses, however, costs became burdensome, and by the 1970s nearly every U.S. state required or encouraged the substitution of [[generic drugs]] for higher-priced brand names. This also led to the 2006 U.S. law, [[Medicare Part D]], which offers Medicare coverage for drugs.<ref name=Reasonable/>{{rp|28\u201329}}\n\nAs of 2008, the United States is the leader in [[medical research]], including pharmaceutical development.

Often grouped under the labels of compassionate use, [[expanded access]], or named patient supply, these programs are governed by rules which vary by country defining access criteria, data collection, promotion, and control of drug distribution.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Helene S |title=EU Compassionate Use Programmes (CUPs): Regulatory Framework and Points to Consider before CUP Implementation |url=http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Fulltext/2010/24040/EU_Compassionate_Use_Programmes__CUPs___Regulatory.4.aspx |journal=Pharm Med |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=223\u2013229 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/bf03256820 |access-date=20 January 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707082132/http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Fulltext/2010/24040/EU_Compassionate_Use_Programmes__CUPs___Regulatory.4.aspx |archive-date=7 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWithin the United States, pre-approval demand is generally met through [[treatment IND]] (investigational new drug) applications (INDs), or single-patient INDs. These mechanisms, which fall under the label of expanded access programs, provide access to drugs for groups of patients or individuals residing in the US. Outside the US, Named Patient Programs provide controlled, pre-approval access to drugs in response to requests by physicians on behalf of specific, or \"named\", patients before those medicines are licensed in the patient's home country.  Through these programs, patients are able to access drugs in late-stage clinical trials or approved in other countries for a genuine, unmet medical need, before those drugs have been licensed in the patient's home country.\n\nPatients who have not been able to get access to drugs in development have organized and advocated for greater access.

One of the key divisions is by level of [[controlled substance|control]], which distinguishes [[prescription drug]]s (those that a [[pharmacist]] dispenses only on the [[medical prescription|order]] of a [[physician]], [[physician assistant]], or qualified [[nursing|nurse]]) from [[over-the-counter drug]]s (those that consumers can order for themselves). Another key distinction is between traditional [[small molecule|small-molecule]] drugs, usually derived from [[chemical synthesis]], and [[biopharmaceutical]]s, which include [[recombinant proteins]], [[vaccine]]s, [[blood product]]s used [[therapy|therapeutically]] (such as [[IVIG]]), [[gene therapy]], [[Monoclonal antibody|monoclonal antibodies]] and [[cell therapy]] (for instance, [[stem cell|stem-cell]] therapies). Other ways to classify medicines are by mode of action, [[route of administration]], [[biological system]] affected, or [[therapeutic effect]]s. An elaborate and widely used classification system is the [[Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System]] (ATC system). The [[World Health Organization]] keeps a list of [[essential medicines]].\n\n[[Drug discovery]] and [[drug development]] are complex and expensive endeavors undertaken by [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]], academic scientists, and governments. As a result of this complex path from discovery to commercialization, partnering has become a standard practice for advancing drug candidates through development pipelines.  Governments generally regulate what drugs can be marketed, [[pharmaceutical marketing|how drugs are marketed]], and in some jurisdictions, drug pricing.   Controversies have arisen over drug pricing and disposal of used drugs.\n\n==Definition==\nIn Europe, the term is \"medicinal product\", and it is defined by EU law as:\n\n* \"Any substance or combination of substances presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in human beings; or\"\n* \"Any substance or combination of substances which may be used in or administered to human beings either with a view to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological functions by exerting a [[pharmacological]], [[immunological]] or metabolic action, or to making a [[medical diagnosis]].\"<ref>[http://ec.europa.eu/health/files/eudralex/vol-1/dir_2004_27/dir_2004_27_en.pdf Directive 2004/27/EC] Official Journal of the European Union. 30 April 2004 L136</ref>{{rp|36}}\n\nIn the US, a \"drug\" is:\n* A substance recognized by an official pharmacopeia or formulary.\n* A substance intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.\n* A substance (other than [[food]]) intended to affect the structure or any function of the body.\n* A substance intended for use as a component of a medicine but not a device or a component, part or accessory of a device.\n* Biological products are included within this definition and are generally covered by the same laws and regulations, but differences exist regarding their manufacturing processes (chemical process versus biological process).<ref>FDA [https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/InformationOnDrugs/ucm079436.htm Glossary]</ref>\n\n==Usage==\nDrug use among elderly Americans has been studied; in a group of 2377 people with average age of 71 surveyed between 2005 and 2006, 84% took at least one prescription drug, 44% took at least one [[over-the-counter]] (OTC) drug, and 52% took at least one [[dietary supplement]]; in a group of 2245 elderly Americans (average age of 71) surveyed over the period 2010 \u2013 2011, those percentages were 88%, 38%, and 64%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Qato DM|last2=Wilder J|last3=Schumm L|last4=Gillet V|last5=Alexander G|date=1 April 2016|title=Changes in prescription and over-the-counter medication and dietary supplement use among older adults in the united states, 2005 vs 2011|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=176|issue=4|pages=473\u2013482|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.8581|pmid=26998708 |pmc=5024734}}</ref>\n\n== Classification ==\n{{main|Drug class}}\nOne of the key classifications is between traditional [[small molecule]] drugs; usually derived from chemical synthesis, and [[biologic medical product]]s; which include [[recombinant proteins]], [[vaccines]], [[blood products]] used therapeutically (such as [[IVIG]]), [[gene therapy]], and [[cell therapy]] (for instance, [[stem cell]] therapies).\n\nPharmaceuticals or drugs or medicines are classified in various other groups besides their origin on the basis of pharmacological properties like mode of action and their pharmacological action or activity,<ref>http://www.epgonline.org database of prescription pharmaceutical products including drug classifications [http://www.epgonline.org/class.cfm]</ref> such as by [[chemical property|chemical properties]], mode or [[route of administration]], [[biological system]] affected, or [[therapeutic effect]]s.

Frequencies are often abbreviated from Latin, such as ''every 8 hours'' reading Q8H from ''Quaque VIII Hora''.\n\n==Drug discovery==\n{{clear left}}\n{{Main|Drug discovery}}\nIn the fields of [[medicine]], [[biotechnology]] and [[pharmacology]], drug discovery is the process by which new drugs are discovered.\n\nHistorically, drugs were discovered through identifying the active ingredient from traditional remedies or by [[serendipity|serendipitous]] discovery.  Later [[chemical library|chemical libraries]] of synthetic [[small molecule]]s, [[natural product]]s or [[extract]]s were screened in intact cells or whole organisms to identify substances that have a desirable [[therapeutic]] effect in a process known as\n[[classical pharmacology]].  Since [[Human Genome Project|sequencing]] of the [[human genome]] which allowed rapid cloning and synthesis of large quantities of purified proteins, it has become common practice to use [[high throughput screening]] of large compounds libraries against isolated [[biological target]]s which are hypothesized to be disease-modifying in a process known as [[reverse pharmacology]].  Hits from these screens are then tested in cells and then in animals for [[efficacy]].  Even more recently, scientists have been able to understand the shape of biological molecules at the atomic level, and to use that knowledge to design (see [[drug design]]) drug candidates.\n\nModern drug discovery involves the identification of screening hits, [[medicinal chemistry]] and optimization of those hits to increase the [[Affinity (pharmacology)#Protein-ligand binding|affinity]], [[binding selectivity|selectivity]] (to reduce the potential of side effects), efficacy/[[potency (pharmacology)|potency]], [[Metabolism|metabolic]] stability (to increase the [[Biological half-life|half-life]]), and oral [[bioavailability]]. Once a compound that fulfills all of these requirements has been identified, it will begin the process of [[drug development]] prior to [[clinical trial]]s. One or more of these steps may, but not necessarily, involve [[computer-aided drug design]].\n\nDespite advances in technology and understanding of biological systems, drug discovery is still a lengthy, \"expensive, difficult, and inefficient process\" with low rate of new therapeutic discovery.<ref name=Anson2009>{{Cite news\n |last1=Anson\n |first1=Blake D.\n |last2=Ma\n |first2=Junyi\n |last3=He\n |first3=Jia-Qiang\n |date=1 May 2009\n |title=Identifying Cardiotoxic Compounds\n |periodical=Genetic Engineering & Biotechnology News\n |series=TechNote\n |publisher=Mary Ann Liebert\n |volume=29\n |issue=9\n |pages=34\u201335\n |url=http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem_print.aspx?aid=2890&chid=0\n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921025805/http://www.genengnews.com/articles/chitem_print.aspx?aid=2890&chid=0\n |archivedate=21 September 2012\n |issn=1935-472X\n |oclc=77706455\n |accessdate=25 July 2009\n |url-status=dead\n |df=\n}}</ref> In 2010, the research and development cost of each [[new molecular entity]] (NME) was approximately US$1.8 billion.<ref>{{cite journal | volume = 9 | pages = 203\u2013214 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1038/nrd3078 | title = How to improve R&D productivity: the pharmaceutical industry's grand challenge |author1=Steven M.

In some countries, such as the United States, they are regulated at the national level by a single agency. In other jurisdictions they are regulated at the state level, or at both state and national levels by various bodies, as is the case in Australia.  The role of therapeutic goods regulation is designed mainly to protect the health and safety of the population. Regulation is aimed at ensuring the safety, quality, and efficacy of the therapeutic goods which are covered under the scope of the regulation. In most jurisdictions, therapeutic goods must be registered before they are allowed to be marketed. There is usually some degree of restriction of the availability of certain therapeutic goods depending on their risk to consumers.\n\nDepending upon the [[jurisdiction]], drugs may be divided into [[over-the-counter drug]]s (OTC) which may be available without special restrictions, and [[prescription drug]]s, which must be [[Medical prescription|prescribed]] by a licensed medical practitioner in accordance with [[medical guideline]]s due to the risk of adverse effects and [[contraindication]]s. The precise distinction between OTC and prescription depends on the legal [[jurisdiction]]. A third category, \"behind-the-counter\" drugs, is implemented in some jurisdictions. These do not require a prescription, but must be kept in the [[dispensary]], not visible to the public, and only be sold by a [[pharmacist]] or [[pharmacy technician]]. Doctors may also prescribe prescription drugs for [[off-label use]] \u2013 purposes which the drugs were not originally approved for by the regulatory agency. The [[Classification of Pharmaco-Therapeutic Referrals]] helps guide the referral process between pharmacists and doctors.\n\nThe [[International Narcotics Control Board]] of the [[United Nations]] imposes a world law of [[prohibition]] of certain drugs. They publish a lengthy list of chemicals and plants whose trade and consumption (where applicable) is forbidden. OTC drugs are sold without restriction as they are considered safe enough that most people will not hurt themselves accidentally by taking it as instructed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medication Safety|url=http://www.housefindings.com/tips-for-medication-safety/|website=House Findings|accessdate=21 July 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914133316/http://www.housefindings.com/tips-for-medication-safety/|archive-date=14 September 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Many countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] have a third category of \"pharmacy medicines\", which can only be sold in registered [[pharmacy|pharmacies]] by or under the supervision of a [[pharmacist]].\n\n[[Medical error]]s include overprescription and [[polypharmacy]], misprescription, contraindication and lack of detail in dosage and administrations instructions.

Penicillin, introduced a few years later, provided a broader spectrum of activity compared to sulfa drugs and reduced side effects. Streptomycin, found in 1942, proved to be the first drug effective against the cause of tuberculosis and also came to be the best known of a long series of important antibiotics. A second generation of antibiotics was introduced in the 1940s: aureomycin and chloramphenicol. Aureomycin was the best known of the second generation.\n\nLithium was discovered in the 19th century for nervous disorders and its possible mood-stabilizing or prophylactic effect; it was cheap and easily produced. As lithium fell out of favor in France, valpromide came into play. This antibiotic was the origin of the drug that eventually created the mood stabilizer category. Valpromide had distinct psychotrophic effects that were of benefit in both the treatment of acute manic states and in the maintenance treatment of manic depression illness. Psychotropics can either be sedative or stimulant; sedatives aim at damping down the extremes of behavior. Stimulants aim at restoring normality by increasing tone. Soon arose the notion of a tranquilizer which was quite different from any sedative or stimulant. The term tranquilizer took over the notions of sedatives and became the dominant term in the West through the 1980s. In Japan, during this time, the term tranquilizer produced the notion of a psyche-stabilizer and the term mood stabilizer vanished.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\">Tone, Andrea and Elizabeth Watkins, ''Medicating Modern America: Prescription Drugs in History''.

HRT is not a life-saving drug, nor does it cure any disease. HRT has been prescribed to improve one's quality of life. Doctors prescribe estrogen for their older female patients both to treat short-term menopausal symptoms and to prevent long-term diseases. In the 1960s and early 1970s, more and more physicians began to prescribe estrogen for their female patients. between 1991 and 1999, Premarin was listed as the most popular prescription and best-selling drug in America.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\" />\n\nThe first oral contraceptive, Enovid, was approved by FDA in 1960. Oral contraceptives inhibit ovulation and so prevent conception. Enovid was known to be much more effective than alternatives including the condom and the diaphragm. As early as 1960, oral contraceptives were available in several different strengths by every manufacturer. In the 1980s and 1990s, an increasing number of options arose including, most recently, a new [[drug delivery|delivery system]] for the oral contraceptive via a transdermal patch. In 1982, a new version of the Pill was introduced, known as the \"biphasic\" pill. By 1985, a new triphasic pill was approved. Physicians began to think of the Pill as an excellent means of birth control for young women.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\" />\n\nStimulants such as Ritalin (methylphenidate) came to be pervasive tools for behavior management and modification in young children. Ritalin was first marketed in 1955 for narcolepsy; its potential users were middle-aged and the elderly. It wasn't until some time in the 1980s along with hyperactivity in children that Ritalin came onto the market. Medical use of methlyphenidate is predominantly for symptoms of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Consumption of methylphenidate in the U.S. out-paced all other countries between 1991 and 1999. Significant growth in consumption was also evident in Canada, New Zealand, Australia, and Norway. Currently, 85% of the world's methylphanidate is consumed in America.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\" />\n\nThe first minor tranquilizer was Meprobamate. Only fourteen months after it was made available, meprobamate had become the country's largest-selling prescription drug. By 1957, meprobamate had become the fastest-growing drug in history. The popularity of meprobamate paved the way for Librium and Valium, two minor tranquilizers that belonged to a new chemical class of drugs called the benzodiazepines. These were drugs that worked chiefly as anti-anxiety agents and muscle relaxants. The first benzodiazepine was Librium. Three months after it was approved, Librium had become the most prescribed tranquilizer in the nation. Three years later, Valium hit the shelves and was ten times more effective as a muscle relaxant and anti-convulsant. Valium was the most versatile of the minor tranquilizers. Later came the widespread adoption of major tranquilizers such as chlorpromazine and the drug reserpine. In 1970, sales began to decline for Valium and Librium, but sales of new and improved tranquilizers, such as Xanax, introduced in 1981 for the newly created diagnosis of panic disorder, soared.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\" />\n\nMevacor (lovastatin) is the first and most influential statin in the American market. The 1991 launch of Pravachol (pravastatin), the second available in the United States, and the release of Zocor (simvastatin) made Mevacor no longer the only statin on the market.\nIn 1998, Viagra was released as a treatment for erectile dysfunction.<ref name=\"ToneAndrea\" />\n\n===Ancient pharmacology===\nUsing plants and plant substances to treat all kinds of diseases and medical conditions is believed to date back to [[prehistoric medicine]].\n\nThe [[Kahun Gynaecological Papyrus]], the oldest known medical text of any kind, dates to about 1800 BC and represents the first documented use of any kind of drug.<ref>Griffith, F.

Although often accepted as an advance in some ways, there was some opposition, due to serious adverse effects such as [[tardive dyskinesia]]. Patients often opposed psychiatry and refused or stopped taking the drugs when not subject to psychiatric control.\n\nGovernments have been heavily involved in the regulation of drug development and drug sales. In the U.S., the [[Elixir Sulfanilamide disaster]] led to the establishment of the [[Food and Drug Administration]], and the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act required manufacturers to file new drugs with the FDA. The 1951 Humphrey-Durham Amendment required certain drugs to be sold by prescription.

As more drugs became prescribed for chronic illnesses, however, costs became burdensome, and by the 1970s nearly every U.S. state required or encouraged the substitution of [[generic drugs]] for higher-priced brand names. This also led to the 2006 U.S. law, [[Medicare Part D]], which offers Medicare coverage for drugs.<ref name=Reasonable/>{{rp|28\u201329}}\n\nAs of 2008, the United States is the leader in [[medical research]], including pharmaceutical development.

Often grouped under the labels of compassionate use, [[expanded access]], or named patient supply, these programs are governed by rules which vary by country defining access criteria, data collection, promotion, and control of drug distribution.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Helene S |title=EU Compassionate Use Programmes (CUPs): Regulatory Framework and Points to Consider before CUP Implementation |url=http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Fulltext/2010/24040/EU_Compassionate_Use_Programmes__CUPs___Regulatory.4.aspx |journal=Pharm Med |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=223\u2013229 |year=2010 |doi=10.1007/bf03256820 |access-date=20 January 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707082132/http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Fulltext/2010/24040/EU_Compassionate_Use_Programmes__CUPs___Regulatory.4.aspx |archive-date=7 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWithin the United States, pre-approval demand is generally met through [[treatment IND]] (investigational new drug) applications (INDs), or single-patient INDs. These mechanisms, which fall under the label of expanded access programs, provide access to drugs for groups of patients or individuals residing in the US. Outside the US, Named Patient Programs provide controlled, pre-approval access to drugs in response to requests by physicians on behalf of specific, or \"named\", patients before those medicines are licensed in the patient's home country.  Through these programs, patients are able to access drugs in late-stage clinical trials or approved in other countries for a genuine, unmet medical need, before those drugs have been licensed in the patient's home country.\n\nPatients who have not been able to get access to drugs in development have organized and advocated for greater access.

With about 270 square kilometers (104 square miles), the collective municipality of the city of Jerichow is one of the largest municipalities in area size in Germany.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe city of Jerichow lies on an ancient branch of the [[Elbe]] River between [[Stendal]] and [[Genthin]], 31 miles (50 kilometers) northeast of [[Magdeburg]]. The territory of the collective municipality extends from the center of the city to the east along the northern boundary of the District of Jerichower Land to the state boundary of [[Brandenburg]] and from there to the south, a strip of land .\n\n== Boroughs ==\nOn 1 January 2010, the collective municipality (''Einheitsgemeinde'') of Stadt Jerichow was founded with the following towns and villages:  Annenhof, Altbellin, Altenklitsche, Belicke, Blockdamm, Brettin, Dreih\u00e4user, Dunkelforth, Elisenau, Gro\u00dfdemsin, Gro\u00dfwulkow, G\u00fcssow, Hahnenh\u00fctten, Havemark, Hohenbellin, Jungviehhof, Kade, Kader Schleuse, Karow, Kleindemsin, Kleinmangelsdorf, Kleinwulkow, Kleinwusterwitz, Klietznick, Kuxwinkel, Mangelsdorf (which had already merged with Jerichow on 6 August 2002<ref>{{in lang|de}} ''Statistische \u00c4mter des Bundes und der L\u00e4nder'' [ Statistical Offices of the Federation and Its States ], \"''[https://www.destatis.de/DE/ZahlenFakten/LaenderRegionen/Regionales/Gemeindeverzeichnis/NamensGrenzAenderung/Aktuell/2002.html;jsessionid=39088B3D399B401FD838D9A0EDB58DAA.cae3 Gebiets\u00e4nderungen vom 01.01. bis 31.12.2002]'' [ Changes in the Communities of Germany from 1 January to 31 December 2002 ]\", ''DeStatis:  Statistisches Bundesamt'' [ ''DeStatis : Federal Office of Statistics'' ], retrieved 29 December 2013.\n</ref>), Neubuchholz, Neue H\u00fctten, Neuenklitsche, Neuredekin, Nielebock, Redekin, Ro\u00dfdorf, Scharteucke, Schlagenthin, Seedorf, Steinitz, Werdershof and Zabakuck as well as the sheep farm, Wilhelmsthal.

At seven percent the weather stations of the [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (German Weather Service) were registering low numbers.  The driest month is February, with most of the rainfall coming in June.  In June, the amount of rain is twice the total for February.\n\n== History ==\nJerichow is not named after a [[Jericho]] in the [[Holy Bible]] of the [[Christians]].  Jerichow was actually an Old [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] word meaning, \"riverside settlement of the dominant one\".<ref>{{in lang|de}} Oswald Jannermann, ''Slawische Orts\u2013 und Gew\u00e4ssernamen in Deutschland :  Von Belgrad in Pommern bis Zicker auf R\u00fcgen'' [ ''Slavic Place and Water Names in Germany : From Belgrad in [[Pomerania]] to [[Gager (municipality)|Zicker]] on the [[R\u00fcgen]]'' ] ([[Norderstedt]]:  BoD \u2013 Books on Demand, 2012), {{ISBN|978-3-8370-3356-4}}, page 13.  ''Wjerch'' ( \"peak\" ) and ''zwjercha'' ( \"on top\" ) are [[Lower Sorbian]] words derived from ''fercho'', the stem word from [[Proto-Slavic|Old Slavic]] for \"above, dominant\".  The suffix, ''[[German toponymy#Suffixes|\u2013ow]]'', is Old Slavic for \"water-place\".</ref>  There used to be a castle backed by a man-made tributary of the Elbe River, but today only a lump of earth remains with the name of ''Burgberg'' (lit. Castle Hill).\n\nJerichow was mentioned for the first time at the end of 1144 by the documents.  The occasion was the foundation of the [[Jerichow Monastery]] of the [[Premonstratensians|Premonstratensian]] [[Canon (priest)|canons]] with the donation of [[:de:Hartwig I. von Stade|Hartwig von Stade]], the canon of the Cathedral of Magdeburg (with the confirmation from the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Conrad III of Germany]]).  In the following year, the Premonstratensian canons came from the ''Kloster Unser Lieben Frauen'' (Monastery of the Blessed Virgin Mary) in Magdeburg to settle in the town center but, in 1148, they moved to the present location because of the disturbing bustle of the town's marketplace.  They built between 1149 and 1172 the [[collegiate church]] as a [[basilica]] with three [[nave]]s as well as the east wing of the [[Enclosed religious orders#exclaustration|cloister]].  These buildings are considered as important works of the [[List of Brick Romanesque buildings|Romanesque brick style]], the oldest of its kind east of the Elbe River.  They would serve for centuries as the landmark for the surrounding areas.\n\nIn the 13th Century Jerichow received the city charter (''[[Town privileges|Stadtrecht]]'').  In 1336 the town was completely destroyed by the flooding from the Elbe River but it was rebuilt and founded in its present location by a local nobleman, Johann III von Buch.<ref>{{in lang|de}} Peter Neumeister, \"''Johann von Buch'' : ''Ein altm\u00e4rkischer Rechtsgelehrter im Dienste der Wittelsbacher'' [ Johann von Buch : A Lawyer from the [[Altmark]] in the Service of the [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach]]s ]\", ''Die Altmark von 1300 bis 1600 : Eine Kulturregion im Spannungsfeld von Magdeburg, L\u00fcbeck und Berlin'' [ ''The Altmark 1300\u20131600 : A Cultural Region in the Area of Conflict between Magdeburg, [[L\u00fcbeck]] and [[Berlin]]'' ], edited by Jiri Fajt, Wilfried Franzen and Peter Kn\u00fcvener (Berlin : Lukas Verlag, 2011), {{ISBN|978-3867321068}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zNFktODy000C&pg=PA150 pages 150]-155 for more information.</ref>  However, its former location is still marked by a deep trench lined with ancient walls of brick.<ref name=\"Truben\">{{in lang|de}} W.

During the [[Thirty Years War]], the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] and [[Sweden|Swedish]] armies devastated the village and monastery of Jerichow in 1631. Since 1680, along with the [[Duchy of Magdeburg]], Jerichow belonged to the Electorate of Brandenburg and later the Kingdom of [[Prussia]] and to the former Jerichower District.  In 1684 and 1685, the Monastery's church was repaired by the order of the Great Elector, [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], to be used as a new [[Calvinism|Reformed]] church for the [[Huguenot]] refugees.\n\nIn 1806, [[Napoleon]] and his [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]] captured the city of Magdeburg and added to the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], with his brother [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]] as the King, but the eastern boundary of the new Kingdom stopped at the Elbe River. Jerichow was on the other side of the Elbe so it remained Prussian for the rest of the French occupation (1806\u20131814).\n\nFrom 1853 to 1856, at the request of King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]], [[:de:Ferdinand von Quast|Ferdinand von Quast]] restored the Monastery Church.  Around 1870 the convent building was used as a brewery and a distillery.  In the present time, there was an extensive renovation of the Monastery Church with the considerable restoration of the Romanesque appearance.\n\nWith a series of administrative reorganizations, Jerichow remained in the Kingdom of Prussia until 1918, when it became German.  At the end of the Napoleonic wars, it was assigned to [[Districts of Germany|Landkreis]] Jerichow II but its district's name was changed in 1952 to Landkreis Genthin and in 1994 to Landkreis Jerichower Land.

The wavy bar symbolizes the Elbe River, which had, from the earliest times, significant importance to the history of the town.  Two accompanying ears, each with eleven grains, are the reference to the formerly independent eleven towns that are now united in the Collective Municipality with Jerichow, and to agriculture, their main industry for many centuries.<ref>{{in lang|de}} J\u00f6rg Mantzsch, ''Das Wappen der Stadt Jerichow, Dokumentation zum Genehmigungsverfahren'' [ ''The Coat-of-arms of the City of Jerichow, Documentation of the Approval Process'' ], deposited with the authorities of the Landkreis Jerichower Land, 2010 (Magdeburg:  ''Landeshauptarchiv'' [ State Archives of ] Magdeburg).</ref>\n\nThe colors of the town are white and blue.[[Image:Wappen Jerichow.svg|thumb|130px|Current coat-of-arms of Jerichow]]\n<big>'''Current coat of arms of the town of Jerichow'''</big>\n\nBlason: \"On the blue field St. George in an silver armor, in his right hand a silver cross-tipped lance, on his left side holding a shield divided in red and silver, with a silver double-towered church in the upper half; on his right side, a golden dragon.''\n\nUntil 1999 Jerichow did not have an official coat-of-arms but for centuries it had used as its temporary symbol the changing image of St. George in his armor with the lance and the dragon.\n\nFrom Christian iconography, numerous incarnations of St. George have survived.  The earliest seals showed him dressed in a simple robe and standing on the downed and pierced dragon; only in the Middle Ages and then again towards the end of the 19th Century, he was transformed into a knight, complete with a set of armor, a helmet, a shield and more.  It is assumed that Jerichow's coat-of-arms also underwent another change because, in 1779, it had a different description.  In the archives of the Jerichow Monastery, there is a file with the title \"''Nachrichten von der Stadt Jerichow de Anno 1779''\" (News from the Town of Jerichow for the Year 1779)''.'' In this file, the Mayor answered various questions about the town. The thirty-first question is, ''\"Was die Stadt im Wappen f\u00fchre?''\" (What would the town have in the coat-of-arms?); the answer: \"''Den Ritter St. Georg der den Lindwurm ersticht'' \" \u2013 The knight St. George stabbing the dragon.\n\nOld archival documents from 1779:\n\n\"''In Jerichow ist die Stadtkirche dem Heiligen Georg geweiht; hierin erkl\u00e4rt sich der Zusammenhang zum Wappenbild. Erste bildliche Zeugnisse des Jerichower Wappens zeigen eine recht naturalistische Darstellung mit Beiwerk und in falschen Tinkturen''\" (In Jerichow the town church is dedicated to St. George, which explains the image on the coat-of-arms. The first visual evidence of Jerichow's coat-of-arms shows a fairly naturalistic representation with accessories and in incorrect tinctures).\n\nThe redesign of the coat-of-arms was undertaken in 1999 by the municipal heraldist (''Kommunalheraldiker'') [[:de:J\u00f6rg Mantzsch J\u00f6rg Mantzsch]].[[Image:Wappen Jerichow historisch.png|thumb|130px|Former coat-of-arms of Jerichow]]\n<big>'''Former Coat-of-arms of Jerichow'''</big>\n\nBlason (former coat-of-arms): \u201cIn blue on the green ground a knight in silver armor, in his right hand a silver cross-tipped lance, in his left hand a red and silver divided shield with a black fess of twin [[merlon]]s, on the right side, a snarling brown dragon, on both sides green plants with red petals.\u201d\n\nThe coat-of-arms of Jerichow conformed to the common laws.

At seven percent the weather stations of the [[Deutscher Wetterdienst]] (German Weather Service) were registering low numbers.  The driest month is February, with most of the rainfall coming in June.  In June, the amount of rain is twice the total for February.\n\n== History ==\nJerichow is not named after a [[Jericho]] in the [[Holy Bible]] of the [[Christians]].  Jerichow was actually an Old [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] word meaning, \"riverside settlement of the dominant one\".<ref>{{in lang|de}} Oswald Jannermann, ''Slawische Orts\u2013 und Gew\u00e4ssernamen in Deutschland :  Von Belgrad in Pommern bis Zicker auf R\u00fcgen'' [ ''Slavic Place and Water Names in Germany : From Belgrad in [[Pomerania]] to [[Gager (municipality)|Zicker]] on the [[R\u00fcgen]]'' ] ([[Norderstedt]]:  BoD \u2013 Books on Demand, 2012), {{ISBN|978-3-8370-3356-4}}, page 13.  ''Wjerch'' ( \"peak\" ) and ''zwjercha'' ( \"on top\" ) are [[Lower Sorbian]] words derived from ''fercho'', the stem word from [[Proto-Slavic|Old Slavic]] for \"above, dominant\".  The suffix, ''[[German toponymy#Suffixes|\u2013ow]]'', is Old Slavic for \"water-place\".</ref>  There used to be a castle backed by a man-made tributary of the Elbe River, but today only a lump of earth remains with the name of ''Burgberg'' (lit. Castle Hill).\n\nJerichow was mentioned for the first time at the end of 1144 by the documents.  The occasion was the foundation of the [[Jerichow Monastery]] of the [[Premonstratensians|Premonstratensian]] [[Canon (priest)|canons]] with the donation of [[:de:Hartwig I. von Stade|Hartwig von Stade]], the canon of the Cathedral of Magdeburg (with the confirmation from the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], [[Conrad III of Germany]]).  In the following year, the Premonstratensian canons came from the ''Kloster Unser Lieben Frauen'' (Monastery of the Blessed Virgin Mary) in Magdeburg to settle in the town center but, in 1148, they moved to the present location because of the disturbing bustle of the town's marketplace.  They built between 1149 and 1172 the [[collegiate church]] as a [[basilica]] with three [[nave]]s as well as the east wing of the [[Enclosed religious orders#exclaustration|cloister]].  These buildings are considered as important works of the [[List of Brick Romanesque buildings|Romanesque brick style]], the oldest of its kind east of the Elbe River.  They would serve for centuries as the landmark for the surrounding areas.\n\nIn the 13th Century Jerichow received the city charter (''[[Town privileges|Stadtrecht]]'').  In 1336 the town was completely destroyed by the flooding from the Elbe River but it was rebuilt and founded in its present location by a local nobleman, Johann III von Buch.<ref>{{in lang|de}} Peter Neumeister, \"''Johann von Buch'' : ''Ein altm\u00e4rkischer Rechtsgelehrter im Dienste der Wittelsbacher'' [ Johann von Buch : A Lawyer from the [[Altmark]] in the Service of the [[House of Wittelsbach|Wittelsbach]]s ]\", ''Die Altmark von 1300 bis 1600 : Eine Kulturregion im Spannungsfeld von Magdeburg, L\u00fcbeck und Berlin'' [ ''The Altmark 1300\u20131600 : A Cultural Region in the Area of Conflict between Magdeburg, [[L\u00fcbeck]] and [[Berlin]]'' ], edited by Jiri Fajt, Wilfried Franzen and Peter Kn\u00fcvener (Berlin : Lukas Verlag, 2011), {{ISBN|978-3867321068}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zNFktODy000C&pg=PA150 pages 150]-155 for more information.</ref>  However, its former location is still marked by a deep trench lined with ancient walls of brick.<ref name=\"Truben\">{{in lang|de}} W.

During the [[Thirty Years War]], the [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] and [[Sweden|Swedish]] armies devastated the village and monastery of Jerichow in 1631. Since 1680, along with the [[Duchy of Magdeburg]], Jerichow belonged to the Electorate of Brandenburg and later the Kingdom of [[Prussia]] and to the former Jerichower District.  In 1684 and 1685, the Monastery's church was repaired by the order of the Great Elector, [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], to be used as a new [[Calvinism|Reformed]] church for the [[Huguenot]] refugees.\n\nIn 1806, [[Napoleon]] and his [[Grande Arm\u00e9e]] captured the city of Magdeburg and added to the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]], with his brother [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte]] as the King, but the eastern boundary of the new Kingdom stopped at the Elbe River. Jerichow was on the other side of the Elbe so it remained Prussian for the rest of the French occupation (1806\u20131814).\n\nFrom 1853 to 1856, at the request of King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]], [[:de:Ferdinand von Quast|Ferdinand von Quast]] restored the Monastery Church.  Around 1870 the convent building was used as a brewery and a distillery.  In the present time, there was an extensive renovation of the Monastery Church with the considerable restoration of the Romanesque appearance.\n\nWith a series of administrative reorganizations, Jerichow remained in the Kingdom of Prussia until 1918, when it became German.  At the end of the Napoleonic wars, it was assigned to [[Districts of Germany|Landkreis]] Jerichow II but its district's name was changed in 1952 to Landkreis Genthin and in 1994 to Landkreis Jerichower Land.

The earliest seals showed him dressed in a simple robe and standing on the downed and pierced dragon; only in the Middle Ages and then again towards the end of the 19th Century, he was transformed into a knight, complete with a set of armor, a helmet, a shield and more.  It is assumed that Jerichow's coat-of-arms also underwent another change because, in 1779, it had a different description.  In the archives of the Jerichow Monastery, there is a file with the title \"''Nachrichten von der Stadt Jerichow de Anno 1779''\" (News from the Town of Jerichow for the Year 1779)''.'' In this file, the Mayor answered various questions about the town. The thirty-first question is, ''\"Was die Stadt im Wappen f\u00fchre?''\" (What would the town have in the coat-of-arms?); the answer: \"''Den Ritter St. Georg der den Lindwurm ersticht'' \" \u2013 The knight St. George stabbing the dragon.\n\nOld archival documents from 1779:\n\n\"''In Jerichow ist die Stadtkirche dem Heiligen Georg geweiht; hierin erkl\u00e4rt sich der Zusammenhang zum Wappenbild.
