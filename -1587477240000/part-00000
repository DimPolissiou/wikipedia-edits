Digital accordions typically encode and transmit keypresses and other input as [[Musical Instrument Digital Interface]] (MIDI) messages. Most digital accordions need to be plugged into a [[keyboard amplifier]] or [[PA system]] to hear their sounds.\n\n==Terminology==\nA digital accordion may also be called an electronic accordion, MIDI accordion, or reedless accordion. Some instruments referred to as \"MIDI accordions\" may be hybrid acoustic-electronic instruments,<ref>Davidson, Miriam. ''Alfred's Teach Yourself to Play Accordion''. Alfred Music Publishing, 2005. p. 86</ref> in that they contain the traditional acoustic elements (reeds, bellows, valves) with sensors and electronic circuitry that converts button and key presses and bellows pushing and pulling into MIDI messages. These MIDI messages can be plugged into an external synthesizer, sampler, or [[sound module]] to produce sounds. A hybrid acousic-electronic accordion may have an \"all off\" register switch which stops all of the acoustic reed sounds; this enables a player to use an entirely synthesized sound (electronic synthesizer strings or trumpet, for example), or play with headphones plugged into a synth module for night-time practice.\n\nHybrid acoustic-electronic conversion kits are available for players who wish to add electronic MIDI capabilities to a traditional acoustic instrument. These kits contain the sensors, jacks, circuitry and wiring needed to be able to turn an acoustic accordion into a MIDI accordion. These kits are typically installed by a professional accordion repair shop.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Farfisa Transicord.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Farfisa Transicord and its accompanying power supply and reverb cabinet.]]\nThe first electronic accordions were developed in the early 1960s by the Italian [[Farfisa]] company, which was formed by the merging of the [[Scandalli]], [[Settimio Soprani]], and [[Frontalini]] companies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caffetrieste.com/accordianHistory1.pdf|title=A Brief, Comprehensive History of the Cordovox and other electronic accordions|last=Giotta |first=Fabio G. |date= |website=caffetrieste.com |publisher=Caffe Trieste |access-date=26 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref> Farfisa made reed organs using pressurized air (e.g., Microrgan and Pianorgan)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.caffetrieste.com/accordianHistory1.pdf|title=A Brief, Comprehensive History of the Cordovox and other electronic accordions|last=Giotta |first=Fabio G. |date= |website=caffetrieste.com |publisher=Caffe Trieste |access-date=26 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref> and developed the first [[transistor]] accordion, the Farfisa Transicord.

Unlike a traditional acoustic accordion, though, the register buttons are not opening valves or other mechanisms to pass air over reeds and produce acoustic sound.

Since digital accordions already have the bellows sensor for controlling volume, velocity-sensitive keys, like those found on a piano-style MIDI controller, are uncommon.\n\nAs well, digital accordions have other types of buttons or switches: a power button, a volume knob or buttons, program and sound buttons, buttons for selecting [[effect unit]] settings (for reverb and other effects), other instrument sound buttons (organ, piano, guitar, etc.), and buttons and keys for notes (on some instruments these are velocity-sensitive). Some instruments have  chin switches to change registers, programs, or act like a [[sustain pedal]] and provide other functions without taking the hands off the instrument.\n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://static.roland.com/assets/media/pdf/FR-8x_e05_W.pdf |title=FR-8X Owner's Manual |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=static.roland.com |publisher=Roland |access-date=26 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nSome digital accordions have a display panel to indicate the settings: this may range from a small LED panel that can give short numeric codes (on the Scandalli EWA) to a small full-colour display (on the Roland FR-8X V-Accordion).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.manualslib.com/manual/755546/Scandalli-Ewa.html#manual |title=EWA Electronic Wireless Accordion Owner's Manual |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=www.manualslib.com |publisher=ManualsLib|access-date=26 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://static.roland.com/assets/media/pdf/FR-8x_e05_W.pdf |title=FR-8X Owner's Manual |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=static.roland.com |publisher=Roland |access-date=26 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref> A digital accordion may have various output and input jacks, such as left and right 1/4\" outputs, headphone jack, MIDI in and/or out jacks, an auxiliary in jack (for plugging in recorded [[backing tracks]] or a [[drum machine]]) and, in some cases, a USB jack.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://static.roland.com/assets/media/pdf/FR-8x_e05_W.pdf |title=FR-8X Owner's Manual |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=static.roland.com |publisher=Roland |access-date=26 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref> Some digital accordions allow the entire instrument to be transposed to a different key and/or change the tuning.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://static.roland.com/assets/media/pdf/FR-8x_e05_W.pdf |title=FR-8X Owner's Manual |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=static.roland.com |publisher=Roland |access-date=26 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe Scandalli EWA has a wireless transmitter and receiver, which means that the instrument can be played onstage without a wired connection to the sound system.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.manualslib.com/manual/755546/Scandalli-Ewa.html#manual |title=EWA Electronic Wireless Accordion Owner's Manual |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=www.manualslib.com |publisher=ManualsLib|access-date=26 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref> External pedals can be plugged into the Scandalli EWA, such as a [[sustain pedal]], or pedals to control transposition or portamento/pitch glide effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.manualslib.com/manual/755546/Scandalli-Ewa.html#manual |title=EWA Electronic Wireless Accordion Owner's Manual |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=www.manualslib.com |publisher=ManualsLib|access-date=26 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==External sound modules==\nMany 2010s era digital accordions have an internal sound module. Accordionists who add [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] solid state contacts or spring contacts and a MIDI system to an acoustic accordion need to plug the MIDI out into an external [[sound module]]. A typical sound module designed for a keyboard player might only have a few accordion sounds. Specialized accordion sound modules offer tens or even hundreds of different accordion sounds. Some Ketron and Orla accordion sound modules also have a programmable [[drum machine]] and [[music sequencer]] that can play [[backing tracks]] in a variety of musical styles. An accordionist with a digital accordion which has an internal sound module can plug the MIDI out into an external sound module to gain access to more sounds or features such as a sustain pedal or separate left hand and right hand outputs, if these are not available on their instrument.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Accordion]]\n[[Category:Keyboard instruments]]\n[[Category:Rhythm section]]\n[[Category:Electric and electronic keyboard instruments]]\n[[Category:Folk music instruments]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Rainer von Vielen-Heimatsound-2015 (12).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rainer von Vielen playing a Roland digital V-Accordion at Heimatsound-Festival.

Some instruments have  chin switches to change registers, programs, or act like a [[sustain pedal]] and provide other functions without taking the hands off the instrument.\n<ref> {{cite web |url=https://static.roland.com/assets/media/pdf/FR-8x_e05_W.pdf |title=FR-8X Owner's Manual |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=static.roland.com |publisher=Roland |access-date=26 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref> \n\nSome digital accordions have a display panel to indicate the settings: this may range from a small LED panel that can give short numeric codes (on the Scandalli EWA) to a small full-colour display (on the Roland FR-8X V-Accordion).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.manualslib.com/manual/755546/Scandalli-Ewa.html#manual |title=EWA Electronic Wireless Accordion Owner's Manual |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=www.manualslib.com |publisher=ManualsLib|access-date=26 August 2019 |quote=}} </ref><ref> {{cite web |url=https://static.roland.com/assets/media/pdf/FR-8x_e05_W.pdf |title=FR-8X Owner's Manual |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=static.roland.com |publisher=Roland |access-date=26 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref> A digital accordion may have various output and input jacks, such as left and right 1/4\" outputs, headphone jack, MIDI in and/or out jacks, an auxiliary in jack (for plugging in recorded [[backing tracks]] or a [[drum machine]]) and, in some cases, a USB jack.<ref> {{cite web |url=https://static.roland.com/assets/media/pdf/FR-8x_e05_W.pdf |title=FR-8X Owner's Manual |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=static.roland.com |publisher=Roland |access-date=26 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref> Some digital accordions allow the entire instrument to be transposed to a different key and/or change the tuning.<ref> {{cite web |url=https://static.roland.com/assets/media/pdf/FR-8x_e05_W.pdf |title=FR-8X Owner's Manual |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=static.roland.com |publisher=Roland |access-date=26 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nThe Scandalli EWA has a wireless transmitter and receiver, which means that the instrument can be played onstage without a wired connection to the sound system.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.manualslib.com/manual/755546/Scandalli-Ewa.html#manual |title=EWA Electronic Wireless Accordion Owner's Manual |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=www.manualslib.com |publisher=ManualsLib|access-date=26 August 2019 |quote=}} </ref> External pedals can be plugged into the Scandalli EWA, such as a [[sustain pedal]], or pedals to control transposition or portamento/pitch glide effects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.manualslib.com/manual/755546/Scandalli-Ewa.html#manual |title=EWA Electronic Wireless Accordion Owner's Manual |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=www.manualslib.com |publisher=ManualsLib|access-date=26 August 2019 |quote=}} </ref>\n\n==External sound modules==\nMany 2010s era digital accordions have an internal sound module. Accordionists who add [[aftermarket (merchandise)|aftermarket]] solid state contacts or spring contacts and a MIDI system to an acoustic accordion need to plug the MIDI out into an external [[sound module]]. A typical sound module designed for a keyboard player might only have a few accordion sounds. Specialized accordion sound modules offer tens or even hundreds of different accordion sounds. Some Ketron and Orla accordion sound modules also have a programmable [[drum machine]] and [[music sequencer]] that can play [[backing tracks]] in a variety of musical styles. An accordionist with a digital accordion which has an internal sound module can plug the MIDI out into an external sound module to gain access to more sounds or features such as a sustain pedal or separate left hand and right hand outputs, if these are not available on their instrument.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Accordion]]\n[[Category:Keyboard instruments]]\n[[Category:Rhythm section]]\n[[Category:Electric and electronic keyboard instruments]]\n[[Category:Folk music instruments]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo/generalfixes, replaced: traditonal \u2192 traditional", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_accordion"}

The merger was instigated because the CCD had announced they were shutting their doors due to funding issues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cjnews.com/news/canada/canadian-centre-diversity-close-doors|title=Canadian Centre for Diversity to close doors - The Canadian Jewish News|last=Reporter|first=Paul Lungen, Staff|date=2013-09-25|newspaper=The Canadian Jewish News|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-02}}</ref> Upon hearing this news, the CIDI and CCD entered into a dialogue about a merger which would provide stable funding and allow the CCD's programs to continue.\n\n=== About the Canadian Centre for Diversity (CCD) ===\nThe '''[[Canadian Centre for Diversity]]''' (originally called the Canadian Council for Christians and Jews.) was founded in 1947 to address issues of antisemitism and promote interfaith dialogue. The mandate expanded in subsequent years to focus on addressing issues related to racism, and religious discrimination in Canadian society. Their primary focus was on providing school programs to educate students on issues related to bullying, bias and discrimination. The CCCJ changed its name in 2008 to the Canadian Centre for Diversity to be more reflective of its broader mandate.\n\nIn September 2013, the board of directors of the CCD announced that it was shutting its doors due to a lack of ongoing funding. Subsequently, CCD announced in January 2014 that they would merge with the Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion. [[File:The Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion.jpg|alt=Logo of the Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion|thumb|Logo of the Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion|left]]\n\n=== About the Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion (CIDI) ===\nCIDI was founded in 2012 by Michael Bach, the former National Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion for KPMG in Canada, a role he created and held for 7 years. Having worked as a diversity and inclusion practitioner for the better part of a decade - both in Canada and globally as the Deputy Chief Diversity Officer for KPMG International - Bach felt there was a need for an organization that could wrap its arms around the entire diversity conversation and provide some unity and clarity to what had become a very complicated topic.\n\nBach's vision was to create a non-profit organization that would support employers along their diversity and inclusion journey. CIDI officially launched in 2012. By the middle of 2013 CIDI had secured its founding employer partners, had a staff of 5 and was operating in 4 cities across Canada.\n\nMerger talks began between the two organizations at the end of 2013. There was an agreement in principle struck and Bach was named the CEO of CCD to facilitate the merger over the course of 2014. The merger officially took place in 2015.\n\n== Awards of Success ==\n[[File:AoS.jpg|alt=Awards of Success Logo|left|thumb|Awards of Success Logo]]\nIn an effort to recognize leaders in the area of diversity and inclusion, in 2016 CCDI launched the Awards of Success to acknowledge the contribution of three individuals who have gone above and beyond to promote diversity and inclusion.\n\nThe Awards of Success<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ccdi.ca/awards-of-success/|title=Awards of Success Prix de la r\u00e9ussite - CCDI|website=ccdi.ca|access-date=2017-01-01}}</ref> recognize three people in the following categories:\n* Senior Executive of the Year\n* Diversity and Inclusion Practitioner of the Year\n* Community Contributor of the Year\nIn their first year, the awards went to Simon Fish, General Counsel, BMO Financial Group (Senior Executive of the Year), Normand St. Gelais, Director, Diversity & Inclusion, [[Sodexo]] (Diversity and Inclusion Practitioner of the Year), and [[Malinda S. Smith|Malinda Smith]], Professor, [[University of Alberta]].\n\n== Educational Campaigns ==\nCCDI has released several educational campaigns to raise awareness and inspire discussion on diversity and inclusion in Canada.\n\n=== TalkingASL ===\nTo help raise awareness of available resources related to [[American Sign Language]] (ASL, in French ''[[Langue des Signes Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise]]'' or LSQ) CCDI created TalkingASL.ca (in French ''ParlantLSQ.ca'') - a free library of ASL related resources in Canada.\n\n=== Sochi Olympics ===\nIn view of the 2014 [[Olympic protests of Russian anti-gay laws]], the (then) Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion released a humorous [[public service announcement]] to draw attention to the ongoing anti-gay laws controversy coupled with the Olympics being held in Russia.<ref name=\"cidi\" /> In it the jest that the Games have always been a little gay, and should be kept that way.<ref name=\"cidi\">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/04/gay-olympics-luge_n_4723922.html Pro-Gay Olympic Games Luge PSA Released By The Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion].

They created the Save Syria campaign and the Syrian Refugee Relief Fund.\n\nThe fund raised over $200,000 and 100% of the funds go to support the resettlement of Syrian refugees in Canada who have been privately sponsored (as opposed to government sponsored refugees).\n\n=== #EndTheBan ===\nIn an effort to raise awareness of the deferral against [[Men who have sex with men blood donor controversy|men who have sex with men]] (MSMs) from donating blood,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blood.ca/en/men-who-have-sex-men|title=Men Who Have Sex with Men {{!}} Canadian Blood Services|website=blood.ca|access-date=2017-01-02}}</ref> CCDI produced a [[public service announcement]] referred to as \"Gay Blood\", and created the hashtag #EndTheBan.

The merger was instigated because the CCD had announced they were shutting their doors due to funding issues.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cjnews.com/news/canada/canadian-centre-diversity-close-doors|title=Canadian Centre for Diversity to close doors - The Canadian Jewish News|last=Reporter|first=Paul Lungen, Staff|date=2013-09-25|newspaper=The Canadian Jewish News|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-02}}</ref> Upon hearing this news, the CIDI and CCD entered into a dialogue about a merger which would provide stable funding and allow the CCD's programs to continue.\n\n=== About the Canadian Centre for Diversity (CCD) ===\nThe '''[[Canadian Centre for Diversity]]''' (originally called the Canadian Council for Christians and Jews.) was founded in 1947 to address issues of antisemitism and promote interfaith dialogue. The mandate expanded in subsequent years to focus on addressing issues related to racism, and religious discrimination in Canadian society. Their primary focus was on providing school programs to educate students on issues related to bullying, bias and discrimination. The CCCJ changed its name in 2008 to the Canadian Centre for Diversity to be more reflective of its broader mandate.\n\nIn September 2013, the board of directors of the CCD announced that it was shutting its doors due to a lack of ongoing funding. Subsequently, CCD announced in January 2014 that they would merge with the Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion. [[File:The Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion.jpg|alt=Logo of the Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion|thumb|Logo of the Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion|left]]\n\n=== About the Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion (CIDI) ===\nCIDI was founded in 2012 by Michael Bach, the former National Director of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion for KPMG in Canada, a role he created and held for 7 years. Having worked as a diversity and inclusion practitioner for the better part of a decade - both in Canada and globally as the Deputy Chief Diversity Officer for KPMG International - Bach felt there was a need for an organization that could wrap its arms around the entire diversity conversation and provide some unity and clarity to what had become a very complicated topic.\n\nBach's vision was to create a non-profit organization that would support employers along their diversity and inclusion journey. CIDI officially launched in 2012. By the middle of 2013 CIDI had secured its founding employer partners, had a staff of 5 and was operating in 4 cities across Canada.\n\nMerger talks began between the two organizations at the end of 2013. There was an agreement in principle struck and Bach was named the CEO of CCD to facilitate the merger over the course of 2014. The merger officially took place in 2015.\n\n== Awards of Success ==\n[[File:AoS.jpg|alt=Awards of Success Logo|left|thumb|Awards of Success Logo]]\nIn an effort to recognize leaders in the area of diversity and inclusion, in 2016 CCDI launched the Awards of Success to acknowledge the contribution of three individuals who have gone above and beyond to promote diversity and inclusion.\n\nThe Awards of Success<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ccdi.ca/awards-of-success/|title=Awards of Success Prix de la r\u00e9ussite - CCDI|website=ccdi.ca|access-date=2017-01-01}}</ref> recognize three people in the following categories:\n* Senior Executive of the Year\n* Diversity and Inclusion Practitioner of the Year\n* Community Contributor of the Year\nIn their first year, the awards went to Simon Fish, General Counsel, BMO Financial Group (Senior Executive of the Year), Normand St. Gelais, Director, Diversity & Inclusion, [[Sodexo]] (Diversity and Inclusion Practitioner of the Year), and [[Malinda S. Smith|Malinda Smith]], Professor, [[University of Alberta]].\n\n== Educational Campaigns ==\nCCDI has released several educational campaigns to raise awareness and inspire discussion on diversity and inclusion in Canada.\n\n=== TalkingASL ===\nTo help raise awareness of available resources related to [[American Sign Language]] (ASL, in French ''[[Langue des Signes Qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise]]'' or LSQ) CCDI created TalkingASL.ca (in French ''ParlantLSQ.ca'') - a free library of ASL related resources in Canada.\n\n=== Sochi Olympics ===\nIn view of the 2014 [[Olympic protests of Russian anti-gay laws]], the (then) Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion released a humorous [[public service announcement]] to draw attention to the ongoing anti-gay laws controversy coupled with the Olympics being held in Russia.<ref name=\"cidi\" /> In it the jest that the Games have always been a little gay, and should be kept that way.<ref name=\"cidi\">[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/04/gay-olympics-luge_n_4723922.html Pro-Gay Olympic Games Luge PSA Released By The Canadian Institute of Diversity and Inclusion].

They created the Save Syria campaign and the Syrian Refugee Relief Fund.\n\nThe fund raised over $200,000 and 100% of the funds go to support the resettlement of Syrian refugees in Canada who have been privately sponsored (as opposed to government sponsored refugees).\n\n=== #EndTheBan ===\nIn an effort to raise awareness of the deferral against [[Men who have sex with men blood donor controversy|men who have sex with men]] (MSMs) from donating blood,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blood.ca/en/men-who-have-sex-men|title=Men Who Have Sex with Men {{!}} Canadian Blood Services|website=blood.ca|access-date=2017-01-02}}</ref> CCDI produced a [[public service announcement]] referred to as \"Gay Blood\", and created the hashtag #EndTheBan.
