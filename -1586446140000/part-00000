A few people have excelled as seafarers, prominent among them the [[Austronesians]] ([[Islander Southeast Asians]], [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]], Islander [[Melanesians]], [[Micronesian people|Micronesians]], and [[Polynesians]]), the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Harappans]], the [[Phoenicians]],the Iranians, the [[ancient Greeks]], the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], the [[Arabs]], the ancient [old people, the [[Norsemen|Norse]], the [[Chinese people|Chinese]], the [[Republic of Venice|Venetians]], the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]], the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic Germans]], the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], the [[Spanish people|Spanish]], the [[English people|English]], the [[French people|French]], the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and the [[Danes]].\n==Antiquity==<!-- Up to 600 AD per article -->\n\n===Indo-Pacific===\n{{Main|Austronesian expansion|Polynesian navigation}}\n[[File:Chronological dispersal of Austronesian people across the Pacific dont trust this cite).png|400px|thumb|Map showing the seaborne migration and expansion of the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesians]] beginning at around 3000 BC]]\nNavigation in the [[Indo-Pacific]] began with the maritime migrations of the [[Austronesians]] from [[Taiwan]] who spread southwards into [[Island Southeast Asia]] and [[Island Melanesia]] during a period between 3000 to 1000 BC. Their first long-distance voyaging was the colonization of [[Micronesia]] from the [[Philippines]] at around 1500 BC. By about 900 BC their descendants had spread more than 6,000 kilometers across the Pacific, reaching [[Tonga]] and [[Samoa]]. In this region, a distinctive [[Polynesian culture]] developed. Within the next few centuries Polynesians reached [[Hawaii]], [[New Zealand]], [[Easter Island]] and possibly [[South America]]. Polynesian navigators used a range of tools and methods, including observation of birds, star navigation, and use of waves and swells to detect nearby land. Songs, mythological stories, and star charts were used to help people remember important navigational information. Meanwhile, Austronesians in Island Southeast Asia began the first true maritime trade networks by about 1000 BC, linking [[China]], [[southern India]], the [[Middle East]], and coastal [[eastern Africa]]. Settlers from [[Borneo]] reached [[Madagascar]] by the early 1st millennium AD and colonized it by AD 500.<ref name=\"Bellwood2006\">{{cite book |last1=Bellwood |first1=Peter |last2=Fox |first2=James J. |last3=Tryon |first3=Darrell |title=The Austronesians: Historical and Comparative Perspectives |date=2006 |publisher=Australian National University Press |isbn=9781920942854 |url=https://press.anu.edu.au/publications/series/comparative-austronesian-series/austronesians}}</ref><ref name=\"Mahdi1999\">{{cite book|first1= Waruno|last1=Mahdi|editor1-last =Blench|editor1-first= Roger |editor2-last=Spriggs|editor2-first=Matthew|title =Archaeology and Language III: Artefacts languages, and texts|chapter =The Dispersal of Austronesian boat forms in the Indian Ocean|volume = 34|publisher =Routledge|series =One World Archaeology |year =1999|pages=144\u2013179|isbn =0415100542}}</ref>\n\n===Mediterranean===\nSailors navigating in the Mediterranean made use of several techniques to determine their location, including staying in sight of land and understanding of the winds and their tendencies. [[Minoans]] of [[Crete]] are an example of an early Western civilization that used celestial navigation. Their palaces and mountaintop [[sanctuaries]] exhibit architectural features that align with the rising sun on the [[equinoxes]], as well as the rising and setting of particular stars.<ref>Bloomberg, 1678:793</ref> The Minoans made sea voyages to the island of [[Santorini|Thera]] and to [[Egypt]].<ref name=\"Bloomberg, 1997:77\">Bloomberg, 1997:77</ref> Both of these trips would have taken more than a day's sail for the Minoans and would have left them traveling by night across open water.<ref name=\"Bloomberg, 1997:77\"/> Here the sailors would use the locations of particular stars, especially those of the constellation [[Ursa Major]], to orient the ship in the correct direction.<ref name=\"Bloomberg, 1997:77\"/>\n\nWritten records of navigation using stars, or [[celestial navigation]], go back to [[Homer]]'s [[Odyssey]] where [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]] tells [[Odysseus]] to keep the Bear (Ursa Major) on his left hand side and at the same time to observe the position of the [[Pleiades]], the late-setting [[Bo\u00f6tes]] and the [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] as he sailed eastward from her island [[Ogygia]] traversing the Ocean.<ref>Homer, Odyssey, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hom.+Od.+5.270&fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0136 273-276]</ref>  The [[Greeks|Greek]] poet [[Aratus]] wrote in his ''Phainomena'' in the third century BC detailed positions of the constellations as written by [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxos]].<ref name=\"Bloomberg, 1997:72\">Bloomberg, 1997:72</ref> The positions described do not match the locations of the stars during Aratus' or Eudoxos' time for the Greek mainland, but some argue that they match the sky from [[Crete]] during the [[Bronze Age]].<ref name=\"Bloomberg, 1997:72\"/> This change in the position of the stars is due to the [[Polar motion|wobble of the Earth]] on its axis which affects primarily the [[pole stars]].<ref name=\"Taylor, 1971:12\">Taylor, 1971:12</ref> Around 1000 BC the constellation [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] would have been closer to the [[North Pole]] than [[Polaris]].<ref>Taylor, 1971:10</ref> The pole stars were used to navigate because they did not disappear below the horizon and could be seen consistently throughout the night.<ref name=\"Taylor, 1971:12\"/>\n\nBy the third century BC the Greeks had begun to use the Little Bear, [[Ursa Minor]], to navigate.<ref>Taylor, 1971:43</ref> In the mid-1st century AD [[Marcus Annaeus Lucanus|Lucan]] writes of [[Pompey]] who questions a sailor about the use of stars in navigation.

Greek navigator [[Eudoxus of Cyzicus]] explored the Arabian Sea for [[Ptolemy VIII Physcon|Ptolemy VIII]], king of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic]] [[Ptolemaic dynasty]] in [[Egypt]]. According to [[Poseidonius]], later reported in [[Strabo]]'s ''[[Geographica (Strabo)|Geography]]'', the [[Monsoon|monsoon wind system]] of the Indian Ocean was first sailed by Eudoxus of Cyzicus in 118 or 116 BC.<ref>[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Strabo/2C*.html#3.4 Strabo's Geography - Book II Chapter 3], LacusCurtius.</ref>\n\n[[Nautical chart]]s and textual descriptions known as sailing directions have been in use in one form or another since the sixth century BC.<ref name=\"bow2\">Bowditch, 2003:2.</ref>  Nautical charts using stereographic and orthographic projections date back to the second century BC.<ref name=\"bow2\"/>\n\nIn 1900, the [[Antikythera mechanism]] was recovered from [[Antikythera wreck]]. This mechanism was built around 1st century BC.\n\n====Phoenicia and Carthage====\nThe [[Phoenicia]]ns and their successors, the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]], were particularly adept sailors and learned to voyage further and further away from the coast in order to reach destinations faster.  One tool that helped them was the [[Sounding line|sounding weight]].  This tool was bell shaped, made from stone or lead, with [[tallow]] inside attached to a very long rope.  When out to sea, sailors could lower the sounding weight in order to determine how deep the waters were, and therefore estimate how far they were from land.  Also, the tallow picked up sediments from the bottom which expert sailors could examine to determine exactly where they were.  The Carthaginian [[Hanno the Navigator]] is known to have sailed through the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] c. 500 BC and explored the Atlantic coast of Africa.  There is general consensus that the [[exploration|expedition]] reached at least as far as [[Senegal]].<ref>Donald Harden, ''The [[Phoenicia]]ns'', Penguin Books, Harmondsworth, page 168</ref>  There is a lack of agreement whether the furthest limit of Hanno's explorations was [[Mount Cameroon]] or Guinea's 890-metre (2910-foot) Mount Kakulima.<ref>B.H.

[[Islamic geography]] and navigational sciences made use of a magnetic [[compass]] and a rudimentary instrument known as a [[Kamal (navigation)|kamal]], used for [[celestial navigation]] and for measuring the [[altitude]]s and [[latitude]]s of the [[star]]s. The kamal itself was simple to construct. It was a rectangular piece of either bone or wood which had a string with 9 consecutive knots attached to it. Another instrument available, developed by the Arabs as well, was the quadrant. Also a celestial navigation device, it was originally developed for astronomy and later transitioned to navigation.<ref>ThinkQuest: Library, \u201cEarly Navigational Instruments,\u201d http://library.thinkquest.org/C004706/contents/1stsea/nap/page/n-2.html# {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110808175410/http://library.thinkquest.org/C004706/contents/1stsea/nap/page/n-2.html |date=2011-08-08 }}</ref>  When combined with detailed maps of the period, sailors were able to sail across oceans rather than skirt along the coast.

The origins of the [[caravel]] ship, developed and used for long-distance travel by the Portuguese, and later by the rest of Iberians, since the 15th century, also date back to the ''qarib'' used by [[al-Andalus|Andalusian]] explorers by the 13th century.<ref name=Hobson>John M.

Powerful navies included those of the [[Maurya]], [[Satavahana]], [[Chola]], [[Vijayanagara]], [[Kalinga (historical kingdom)|Kalinga]], [[Maratha]] and [[Mughal Empire]].\n\n[[Vikings]] used polarization and the [[Sunstone (medieval)|Sunstone]] to allow navigation of their ships by locating the Sun even in a completely overcast sky. This special [[mineral]] was talked about in several 13th \u2013 14th-century written sources in [[Iceland]], some centuries after the carbon-dated, early-11th-century Norse settlement of [[L'Anse aux Meadows]] in northernmost [[Newfoundland]] had been briefly established.<ref name=\"L'Anse\">{{Cite news |first=Lorraine |last=Boissoneault |url=http://daily.jstor.org/anse-aux-meadows-and-the-viking-discovery-of-north-america/ |title=L'Anse Aux Meadows & the Viking Discovery of North America|date=23 July 2015 |newspaper=JSTOR Daily}}</ref>\n\nIn China between 1040 and 1117, the [[magnetic compass]] was being developed and applied to navigation.<ref>Li Shu-hua, \u201cOrigine de la Boussole 11.

The Spanish Crown opened trade routes across the oceans, specially the transatlantic expeditions of [[Christopher Columbus]] on behalf of Castile, from 1492. The Crown of Castile, under [[Charles I of Spain]], also sponsored the first expedition of [[Circumnavigation|world circumnavigation]] in 1521. The enterprise was led by Portuguese navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]] and completed by the Spanish Basque [[Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Elcano]]. The trips of exploration led to trade flourishing across the Atlantic Ocean between Spain and America and across the Pacific Ocean between Asia-Pacific and [[Mexico]] via the [[Philippines]]. Later, [[Andr\u00e9s de Urdaneta]] discovered the northern Pacific's ''volta do mar'' return voyage.\n\nThe compass, a cross-staff or astrolabe, a method to correct for the altitude of [[Polaris]] and rudimentary nautical charts were all the tools available to a navigator at the time of [[Christopher Columbus]].<ref name=\"eb284\"/>  In his notes on Ptolemy's geography, [[Johannes Werner]] of Nurenberg wrote in 1514 that the cross-staff was a very ancient instrument, but was only beginning to be used on ships.<ref name=\"eb285\"/>\n\nPrior to 1577, no method of judging the ship's speed was mentioned that was more advanced than observing the size of the vessel's [[bow wave]] or the passage of sea foam or various floating objects.<ref name=\"may\">May, William Edward, ''A History of Marine Navigation'', G.

It also analysed other sources of error, including the risk of parallax errors with some instruments; and faulty estimates of latitude and longitude on contemporary charts.\n\nIn 1599/1600, Edward Wright's World Chart of 1599 was the first map under the Mercator projection drawn by an Englishman for English navigation. The map prominently displays the Queen Elizabeth I Privy Seal; the only one of her realm to carry her private seal.  The Molyneux 1592 globe is the only other cartography with her Privy Seal.

The octant eventually replaced earlier [[cross-staff]]s and [[Davis quadrant]]s,<ref name=\"eb290\"/>  and had the immediate effect of making latitude calculations much more accurate.\n\nA highly important breakthrough for the accurate determination of longitude came with the invention of the [[marine chronometer]]. The 1714 [[longitude prize]] offer for a method of determining longitude at sea, was won by [[John Harrison]], a Yorkshire carpenter. He submitted a project in 1730, and in 1735 completed a clock based on a pair of counter-oscillating weighted beams connected by springs whose motion was not influenced by gravity or the motion of a ship. His first two sea timepieces H1 and H2 (completed in 1741) used this system, but he realised that they had a fundamental sensitivity to [[centrifugal force]], which meant that they could never be accurate enough at sea.\nHarrison solved the precision problems with his much smaller H4 chronometer design in 1761. H4 looked much like a large five-inch (12&nbsp;cm) diameter pocket watch. In 1761, Harrison submitted H4 for the \u00a320,000 longitude prize.  His design used a fast-beating balance wheel controlled by a temperature-compensated spiral spring.  These features remained in use until stable [[electronic oscillator]]s allowed very accurate portable timepieces to be made at affordable cost. In 1767, the [[Board of Longitude]] published a description of his work in ''The Principles of Mr. Harrison's time-keeper''.\n\nIn 1757, [[John Bird (astronomer)|John Bird]] invented the first [[sextant]].This replaced the Davis quadrant and the octant as the main instrument for navigation. The [[sextant]] was derived from the octant in order to provide for the [[lunar distance method]].  With the lunar distance method, mariners could determine their longitude accurately.  Once chronometer production was established in the late 18th century, the use of the chronometer for accurate determination of longitude was a viable alternative.<ref name=\"eb290\"/><ref name = \"Roberts\">{{cite book \n|last= Roberts |first= Edmund |authorlink= Edmund Roberts (diplomat) \n|title= Embassy to the Eastern courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat : in the U.

Their first long-distance voyaging was the colonization of [[Micronesia]] from the [[Philippines]] at around 1500 BC. By about 900 BC their descendants had spread more than 6,000 kilometers across the Pacific, reaching [[Tonga]] and [[Samoa]]. In this region, a distinctive [[Polynesian culture]] developed. Within the next few centuries Polynesians reached [[Hawaii]], [[New Zealand]], [[Easter Island]] and possibly [[South America]]. Polynesian navigators used a range of tools and methods, including observation of birds, star navigation, and use of waves and swells to detect nearby land. Songs, mythological stories, and star charts were used to help people remember important navigational information. Meanwhile, Austronesians in Island Southeast Asia began the first true maritime trade networks by about 1000 BC, linking [[China]], [[southern India]], the [[Middle East]], and coastal [[eastern Africa]].

This mechanism was built around 1st century BC.\n\n====Phoenicia and Carthage====\nThe [[Phoenicia]]ns and their successors, the [[Carthage|Carthaginians]], were particularly adept sailors and learned to voyage further and further away from the coast in order to reach destinations faster.  One tool that helped them was the [[Sounding line|sounding weight]].  This tool was bell shaped, made from stone or lead, with [[tallow]] inside attached to a very long rope.  When out to sea, sailors could lower the sounding weight in order to determine how deep the waters were, and therefore estimate how far they were from land.  Also, the tallow picked up sediments from the bottom which expert sailors could examine to determine exactly where they were.

Due to this time lapse, credit for the invention has often been given instead to [[John Hadley]] and [[Thomas Godfrey (inventor)|Thomas Godfrey]]. The octant eventually replaced earlier [[cross-staff]]s and [[Davis quadrant]]s,<ref name=\"eb290\"/>  and had the immediate effect of making latitude calculations much more accurate.\n\nA highly important breakthrough for the accurate determination of longitude came with the invention of the [[marine chronometer]]. The 1714 [[longitude prize]] offer for a method of determining longitude at sea, was won by [[John Harrison]], a Yorkshire carpenter. He submitted a project in 1730, and in 1735 completed a clock based on a pair of counter-oscillating weighted beams connected by springs whose motion was not influenced by gravity or the motion of a ship. His first two sea timepieces H1 and H2 (completed in 1741) used this system, but he realised that they had a fundamental sensitivity to [[centrifugal force]], which meant that they could never be accurate enough at sea.\nHarrison solved the precision problems with his much smaller H4 chronometer design in 1761. H4 looked much like a large five-inch (12&nbsp;cm) diameter pocket watch. In 1761, Harrison submitted H4 for the \u00a320,000 longitude prize.  His design used a fast-beating balance wheel controlled by a temperature-compensated spiral spring.  These features remained in use until stable [[electronic oscillator]]s allowed very accurate portable timepieces to be made at affordable cost. In 1767, the [[Board of Longitude]] published a description of his work in ''The Principles of Mr. Harrison's time-keeper''.\n\nIn 1757, [[John Bird (astronomer)|John Bird]] invented the first [[sextant]].This replaced the Davis quadrant and the octant as the main instrument for navigation. The [[sextant]] was derived from the octant in order to provide for the [[lunar distance method]].  With the lunar distance method, mariners could determine their longitude accurately.  Once chronometer production was established in the late 18th century, the use of the chronometer for accurate determination of longitude was a viable alternative.<ref name=\"eb290\"/><ref name = \"Roberts\">{{cite book \n|last= Roberts |first= Edmund |authorlink= Edmund Roberts (diplomat) \n|title= Embassy to the Eastern courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat : in the U.

It is the third<!-- Do NOT add \"and final\", that should be obvious for the third installment of a trilogy--> installment in the [[Star Wars Trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]], the third film to be produced, and sixth film in the \"[[List of Star Wars films#Skywalker saga|Skywalker saga]]\".

Since the Emperor plans to personally oversee the final stages of its construction, the Rebel Fleet launches a full-scale attack on the Death Star in order to prevent its completion and kill the Emperor, effectively bringing an end to his hold over the galaxy. Meanwhile, [[Luke Skywalker]] struggles to bring his father [[Darth Vader]] back to the light side of [[the Force]].\n\n[[Steven Spielberg]], [[David Lynch]] and [[David Cronenberg]] were considered to direct the project before Marquand signed on as director. The production team relied on Lucas' storyboards during pre-production. While writing the shooting script, Lucas, Kasdan, Marquand, and producer Howard Kazanjian spent two weeks in conference discussing ideas to construct it. Kazanjian's schedule pushed shooting to begin a few weeks early to allow [[Industrial Light & Magic]] more time to work on the film's effects in post-production. Filming took place in England, California, and Arizona from January to {{Start date|1982|5}}. Strict secrecy surrounded the production.\n\nThe film was released in theaters on May 25, 1983, six years to the day of the release of the first film, receiving mostly positive reviews. It grossed $475 million worldwide, becoming the [[1983 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 1983]]. Several re-releases and revisions to the film have followed over the decades.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries in film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]] are sent to Jabba's palace on [[Tatooine]] in a trade bargain made by [[Luke Skywalker]] to rescue [[Han Solo]] from crime lord [[Jabba the Hutt]]. Disguised as a [[bounty hunter]], [[Princess Leia]] infiltrates the palace under the pretense of collecting the bounty on [[Chewbacca]] and unfreezes Han but is caught and enslaved. Luke soon arrives to bargain for his friends' release, but Jabba drops him through a trapdoor to be executed by a [[rancor]]. After Luke kills the rancor, Jabba sentences him, Han, and Chewbacca to death by being fed to the [[Sarlacc]], a huge, [[carnivorous plant]]-like desert beast. Having hidden his new [[lightsaber]] inside {{nowrap|R2-D2}}, Luke frees himself and battles Jabba's guards while Leia uses her chains to strangle Jabba to death. As the others rendezvous with the [[Rebel Alliance]], Luke returns to [[Dagobah]] to complete his training with [[Yoda]], whom he finds is dying. Yoda confirms that [[Darth Vader]], once known as Anakin Skywalker, is Luke's father, and becomes one with [[Force (Star Wars)|the Force]]. The [[Force ghost]] of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister, and tells Luke that he must face Vader again to finish his training <!--becoming a \"full-fledged Jedi Knight\" per A Guide to the Star Wars Universe--> and defeat the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]].\n\nThe Rebel Alliance learns that the Empire has been constructing a [[second Death Star]] under the supervision of [[Palpatine|the Emperor]] himself. As the station is protected by an energy shield, Han leads a strike team to destroy the shield generator on the forest moon of [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]]; doing so would allow a squadron of starfighters to destroy the Death Star. Luke and Leia accompany the strike team to Endor in a stolen Imperial shuttle. Luke and his companions encounter a tribe of [[Ewok]]s and, after an initial conflict, gain their trust. Later, Luke tells Leia that she is his sister, Vader is their father, and that he must confront him. Surrendering to Imperial troops, he is brought before Vader, and tries to convince his father to reject the dark side of the Force, to no avail.\n\nVader takes Luke to the Death Star to meet the Emperor, intending to turn him to the dark side. The Emperor reveals that the Imperial forces are prepared for a Rebel assault on the shield generator and that the Rebel Fleet will fall into a trap. On the forest moon of Endor, Han's team is captured by Imperial forces, but a counterattack by the Ewoks allow the Rebels to infiltrate the shield generator. Meanwhile, [[Lando Calrissian]] in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' and [[Admiral Ackbar]] lead the rebel assault on the second Death Star only to find that the Death Star's shield is still active, and the Imperial fleet waits for them. \n\nThe Emperor reveals to Luke that the Death Star is fully operational and orders the firing of its massive superlaser, destroying one of the Rebel starships. The Emperor tempts Luke to give in to his anger. Luke attacks him, but Vader intervenes and the two engage in another lightsaber duel. Vader senses that Luke has a sister and threatens to turn her to the dark side. Enraged, Luke severs Vader's [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] hand. The Emperor entreats Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses, declaring himself a Jedi like his father before him. Furious, the Emperor tortures Luke with [[Force lightning]]. Unwilling to let his son die, Vader throws the Emperor down a reactor shaft to his death<!-- Lucas, McDiarmid, and The Rise of Skywalker's opening crawl all confirm he died. --> but is mortally electrocuted in the process. At his father's last request, Luke removes Vader's mask, and the redeemed Anakin Skywalker dies in his son's arms.\n\nAfter the strike team destroys the shield generator, Lando leads a group of Rebel fighters into the Death Star's core. While the Rebel fleet destroys the [[Super Star Destroyer]] ''Executor'', Lando and [[X-wing fighter]] pilot [[Wedge Antilles]] destroy the Death Star's main reactor. As the ''Falcon'' escapes the Death Star's superstructure and Luke escapes on a shuttle with his father's body, the station explodes. On the Forest Moon of Endor, Leia reveals to Han that Luke is her brother, and she and Han kiss. Luke cremates his father's body on a [[pyre]] before reuniting with his friends. As the Rebels and the galaxy celebrate the fall of the Empire, Luke sees the spirits of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and Anakin watching over him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Star Wars characters|List of Star Wars cast members}}\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Luke Skywalker]], one of the last living [[Jedi]] Knights, trained by Obi-Wan and Yoda; Leia's twin brother, who is also a skilled [[X-wing fighter]] pilot allied with the Rebellion.\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Han Solo]], a rogue smuggler aiding the Rebellion against the Empire, Luke\u2019s friend, and Leia's love interest.\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as [[Leia Organa]], the former princess of the destroyed planet [[Alderaan]], who is part of the Rebellion; Luke's twin sister, and Han's love interest.\n* [[Billy Dee Williams]] as [[Lando Calrissian]], the former Baron Administrator of Cloud City and one of Han's friends who aids the Rebellion.\n* [[Anthony Daniels]] as [[C-3PO]], a humanoid protocol droid in the service of the Rebellion.\n* [[Peter Mayhew]] as [[Chewbacca]], a [[Wookiee]] who is Han's longtime friend and part of the Rebellion.\n* [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]] as [[R2-D2]], an astromech droid, friend of Luke, and longtime companion of C-3PO.

Unlike the other stars of the first film, Ford had not contracted to do two sequels, and ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' had made him an even bigger star. ''Return of the Jedi'' producer [[Howard Kazanjian]] (who also produced ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'') convinced Ford to return: \n<blockquote>I played a very important part in bringing Harrison back for ''Return of the Jedi.'' Harrison, unlike Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill signed only a two picture contract. That is why he was frozen in carbonite in ''The Empire Strikes Back''. When I suggested to George we should bring him back, I distinctly remember him saying that Harrison would never return. I said what if I convinced him to return. George simply replied that we would then write him in to ''Jedi''. I had just recently negotiated his deal for ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' with Phil Gersh of the Gersh Agency. I called Phil who said he would speak with Harrison. When I called back again, Phil was on vacation. David, his son, took the call and we negotiated Harrison's deal. When Phil returned to the office several weeks later he called me back and said I had taken advantage of his son in the negotiations. I had not.

Producer [[Howard Kazanjian]] estimated that using ILM (owned wholly by Lucasfilm) for special effects saved the production approximately $18 million.<ref name=\"ProdDir1\"/> However, the fact that Lucasfilm was a non-union company made acquiring shooting locations more difficult and more expensive, even though ''Star Wars'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back'' had been big hits.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\"/> The project was given the [[working title]] ''Blue Harvest'' with a tagline of \"Horror Beyond Imagination.\" This disguised what the production crew was really filming from fans and the press, and also prevented [[price gouging]] by service providers.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\"/>\n\nThe first stage of production started with 78 days at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] in England,<ref name=\"ProdDir4\"/> where the film occupied all nine stages.

In the same year, Sony Classical re-pressed the 1997 RCA Victor release of ''Return of the Jedi'' along with the other two films in the trilogy. The set was released with the new artwork mirroring the first DVD release of the film. Despite the Sony digital re-mastering, which minimally improved the sound heard only on high-end stereos, this 2004 release is essentially the same as the 1997 RCA Victor release.<ref>{{cite web |title=Star Wars / The Empire Strikes Back / Return of the Jedi   (Original Soundtracks&nbsp;\u2013 2004 reissue) |url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/film/2004/Sep04/star_wars.html |accessdate=January 20, 2007| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061127164125/http://www.musicweb-international.com/film/2004/Sep04/star_wars.html| archive-date=November 27, 2006| url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Post-production===\nMeanwhile, [[special effect]]s work at ILM quickly stretched the company to its operational limits.

Since the Emperor plans to personally oversee the final stages of its construction, the Rebel Fleet launches a full-scale attack on the Death Star in order to prevent its completion and kill the Emperor, effectively bringing an end to his hold over the galaxy. Meanwhile, [[Luke Skywalker]] struggles to bring his father [[Darth Vader]] back to the light side of [[the Force]].\n\n[[Steven Spielberg]], [[David Lynch]] and [[David Cronenberg]] were considered to direct the project before Marquand signed on as director. The production team relied on Lucas' storyboards during pre-production. While writing the shooting script, Lucas, Kasdan, Marquand, and producer Howard Kazanjian spent two weeks in conference discussing ideas to construct it. Kazanjian's schedule pushed shooting to begin a few weeks early to allow [[Industrial Light & Magic]] more time to work on the film's effects in post-production. Filming took place in England, California, and Arizona from January to {{Start date|1982|5}}. Strict secrecy surrounded the production.\n\nThe film was released in theaters on May 25, 1983, six years to the day of the release of the first film, receiving mostly positive reviews. It grossed $475 million worldwide, becoming the [[1983 in film#Highest-grossing films|highest-grossing film of 1983]]. Several re-releases and revisions to the film have followed over the decades.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries in film articles should be 400-700 words. -->\n[[C-3PO]] and [[R2-D2]] are sent to Jabba's palace on [[Tatooine]] in a trade bargain made by [[Luke Skywalker]] to rescue [[Han Solo]] from crime lord [[Jabba the Hutt]]. Disguised as a [[bounty hunter]], [[Princess Leia]] infiltrates the palace under the pretense of collecting the bounty on [[Chewbacca]] and unfreezes Han but is caught and enslaved. Luke soon arrives to bargain for his friends' release, but Jabba drops him through a trapdoor to be executed by a [[rancor]]. After Luke kills the rancor, Jabba sentences him, Han, and Chewbacca to death by being fed to the [[Sarlacc]], a huge, [[carnivorous plant]]-like desert beast. Having hidden his new [[lightsaber]] inside {{nowrap|R2-D2}}, Luke frees himself and battles Jabba's guards while Leia uses her chains to strangle Jabba to death. As the others rendezvous with the [[Rebel Alliance]], Luke returns to [[Dagobah]] to complete his training with [[Yoda]], whom he finds is dying. Yoda confirms that [[Darth Vader]], once known as Anakin Skywalker, is Luke's father, and becomes one with [[Force (Star Wars)|the Force]]. The [[Force ghost]] of [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister, and tells Luke that he must face Vader again to finish his training <!--becoming a \"full-fledged Jedi Knight\" per A Guide to the Star Wars Universe--> and defeat the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Empire]].\n\nThe Rebel Alliance learns that the Empire has been constructing a [[second Death Star]] under the supervision of [[Palpatine|the Emperor]] himself. As the station is protected by an energy shield, Han leads a strike team to destroy the shield generator on the forest moon of [[Endor (Star Wars)|Endor]]; doing so would allow a squadron of starfighters to destroy the Death Star. Luke and Leia accompany the strike team to Endor in a stolen Imperial shuttle. Luke and his companions encounter a tribe of [[Ewok]]s and, after an initial conflict, gain their trust. Later, Luke tells Leia that she is his sister, Vader is their father, and that he must confront him. Surrendering to Imperial troops, he is brought before Vader, and tries to convince his father to reject the dark side of the Force, to no avail.\n\nVader takes Luke to the Death Star to meet the Emperor, intending to turn him to the dark side. The Emperor reveals that the Imperial forces are prepared for a Rebel assault on the shield generator and that the Rebel Fleet will fall into a trap. On the forest moon of Endor, Han's team is captured by Imperial forces, but a counterattack by the Ewoks allow the Rebels to infiltrate the shield generator. Meanwhile, [[Lando Calrissian]] in the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'' and [[Admiral Ackbar]] lead the rebel assault on the second Death Star only to find that the Death Star's shield is still active, and the Imperial fleet waits for them. \n\nThe Emperor reveals to Luke that the Death Star is fully operational and orders the firing of its massive superlaser, destroying one of the Rebel starships. The Emperor tempts Luke to give in to his anger. Luke attacks him, but Vader intervenes and the two engage in another lightsaber duel. Vader senses that Luke has a sister and threatens to turn her to the dark side. Enraged, Luke severs Vader's [[Prosthesis|prosthetic]] hand. The Emperor entreats Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses, declaring himself a Jedi like his father before him. Furious, the Emperor tortures Luke with [[Force lightning]]. Unwilling to let his son die, Vader throws the Emperor down a reactor shaft to his death<!-- Lucas, McDiarmid, and The Rise of Skywalker's opening crawl all confirm he died. --> but is mortally electrocuted in the process. At his father's last request, Luke removes Vader's mask, and the redeemed Anakin Skywalker dies in his son's arms.\n\nAfter the strike team destroys the shield generator, Lando leads a group of Rebel fighters into the Death Star's core. While the Rebel fleet destroys the [[Super Star Destroyer]] ''Executor'', Lando and [[X-wing fighter]] pilot [[Wedge Antilles]] destroy the Death Star's main reactor. As the ''Falcon'' escapes the Death Star's superstructure and Luke escapes on a shuttle with his father's body, the station explodes. On the Forest Moon of Endor, Leia reveals to Han that Luke is her brother, and she and Han kiss. Luke cremates his father's body on a [[pyre]] before reuniting with his friends. As the Rebels and the galaxy celebrate the fall of the Empire, Luke sees the spirits of Yoda, Obi-Wan, and Anakin watching over him.\n\n==Cast==\n{{see also|List of Star Wars characters|List of Star Wars cast members}}\n* [[Mark Hamill]] as [[Luke Skywalker]], one of the last living [[Jedi]] Knights, trained by Obi-Wan and Yoda; Leia's twin brother, who is also a skilled [[X-wing fighter]] pilot allied with the Rebellion.\n* [[Harrison Ford]] as [[Han Solo]], a rogue smuggler aiding the Rebellion against the Empire, Luke\u2019s friend, and Leia's love interest.\n* [[Carrie Fisher]] as [[Leia Organa]], the former princess of the destroyed planet [[Alderaan]], who is part of the Rebellion; Luke's twin sister, and Han's love interest.\n* [[Billy Dee Williams]] as [[Lando Calrissian]], the former Baron Administrator of Cloud City and one of Han's friends who aids the Rebellion.\n* [[Anthony Daniels]] as [[C-3PO]], a humanoid protocol droid in the service of the Rebellion.\n* [[Peter Mayhew]] as [[Chewbacca]], a [[Wookiee]] who is Han's longtime friend and part of the Rebellion.\n* [[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]] as [[R2-D2]], an astromech droid, friend of Luke, and longtime companion of C-3PO.

Unlike the other stars of the first film, Ford had not contracted to do two sequels, and ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' had made him an even bigger star. ''Return of the Jedi'' producer [[Howard Kazanjian]] (who also produced ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'') convinced Ford to return: \n<blockquote>I played a very important part in bringing Harrison back for ''Return of the Jedi.'' Harrison, unlike Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill signed only a two picture contract. That is why he was frozen in carbonite in ''The Empire Strikes Back''. When I suggested to George we should bring him back, I distinctly remember him saying that Harrison would never return. I said what if I convinced him to return. George simply replied that we would then write him in to ''Jedi''. I had just recently negotiated his deal for ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' with Phil Gersh of the Gersh Agency. I called Phil who said he would speak with Harrison. When I called back again, Phil was on vacation. David, his son, took the call and we negotiated Harrison's deal.

Producer [[Howard Kazanjian]] estimated that using ILM (owned wholly by Lucasfilm) for special effects saved the production approximately $18 million.<ref name=\"ProdDir1\"/> However, the fact that Lucasfilm was a non-union company made acquiring shooting locations more difficult and more expensive, even though ''Star Wars'' and ''The Empire Strikes Back'' had been big hits.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\"/> The project was given the [[working title]] ''Blue Harvest'' with a tagline of \"Horror Beyond Imagination.\" This disguised what the production crew was really filming from fans and the press, and also prevented [[price gouging]] by service providers.<ref name=\"EmpireOfDreams\"/>\n\nThe first stage of production started with 78 days at [[Elstree Studios (Shenley Road)|Elstree Studios]] in England,<ref name=\"ProdDir4\"/> where the film occupied all nine stages.

In the same year, Sony Classical re-pressed the 1997 RCA Victor release of ''Return of the Jedi'' along with the other two films in the trilogy. The set was released with the new artwork mirroring the first DVD release of the film.

Produced by [[Allan Glaser]] the film was directed by [[Jeffrey Schwarz]].\n\nThe film features extensive interviews with Hunter, as well as contemporaries and associates, including [[John Waters]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Debbie Reynolds]], and more.\n\n== Background ==\n\nIn 2005, Hunter's autobiography, ''Tab Hunter Confidential: The Making of a Movie Star'' (2005), co-written with [[Eddie Muller]], became a ''[[New York Times]]'' best-seller, and again topped the charts when it was released in paperback in 2007, as well as in 2015,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2015-06-28/e-book-nonfiction/list.html \"Best Sellers\"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. June 28, 2015.</ref> following the release of the documentary. The book served as Hunter's first person account of his rise to Hollywood heartthrob status in the 1950s, as well as his personal struggle with revealing his sexuality over the course of his career.\n\nAcknowledging he was gay in the book, the tone set a new precedent for discussion of [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood's golden era]].\n\nFollowing Hunter's participation in Jeffrey Schwarz's documentary ''[[I Am Divine]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://divinemovie.com/|title=I Am Divine \u2022 A New Documentary by Jeffrey Schwarz|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref> (about famed Baltimore drag queen [[Divine (performer)|Divine]], with whom Hunter had appeared in several motion pictures), producer Allan Glaser approached Schwarz about the potential of adapting the ''Confidential'' book into a feature-length documentary.\n\nFilming began in 2011 conducting a series of new interviews with Hunter and associates in Los Angeles, New York,  Paris and Santa Barbara., as well as culling archival footage of figures from Hollywood's past discussing the star. Filming was completed in 2015.\n\n== Release ==\n[[File:Tab Hunter Confidential Production Team.jpeg|thumbnail]]\n''Tab Hunter Confidential'' premiered at [[South by Southwest]] (SXSW) in 2015,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/tab-hunter-opens-up-life-781046|title=Tab Hunter Opens Up About Life As a Closeted Gay Star During Hollywood's Golden Age|author=Scott Feinberg|date=13 March 2015|work=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref> and played over 100 film festivals and independent screenings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tabhunterconfidential.com/index.php/screenings|title=Tab Hunter Confidential - Screenings|author=Super User|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220035353/http://www.tabhunterconfidential.com/index.php/screenings|archivedate=20 December 2015|df=}}</ref>\n\nThe film was also given a theatrical release in October 2015, premiering  in [[New York City|New York]] at The Village East and in [[Los Angeles]] at the [[Nuart Theater]], playing theatrically in over 50 cities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redrocknews.com/events/16530-tab-hunter-hosts-q-a-at-documentary-premiere|title=Tab Hunter hosts Q&A at documentary premiere - Sedona Red Rock News - Sedona News, Jobs, Things to Do|author=Andrew Pardiac|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.ctnews.com/meyers/2015/03/25/tab-hunter-confidential-happy-to-be-forgotten/|title=\u2018Tab Hunter Confidential\u2019: happy to be forgotten|work=Joe's View|accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/22/tab-hunter-tells-life-story-new-documentary-tab-hu/?page=all|title=Tab Hunter tells life story in new documentary 'Tab Hunter Confidential' - Washington Times|work=The Washingtion Times|accessdate=12 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Participants ==\n[[File:Tab and Debbie.jpg|thumbnail]]\n* [[Tab Hunter]]\n* [[Clint Eastwood]]\n* [[Debbie Reynolds]]\n* [[Portia De Rossi]]\n* [[Noah Wyle]]\n* [[George Takei]]\n* [[Robert Wagner]]\n* [[Dolores Hart]]\n* [[Lainie Kazan]]\n* [[John Waters]]\n* [[Connie Stevens]]\n* [[Marilyn Erskine]]\n* Allan Glaser\n* [[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]]\n* [[Liz Torres]]\n* [[Robert Osborne]]\n* [[Don Murray (actor)|Don Murray]]\n* [[Darryl Hickman]]\n* [[Rae Allen]]\n* [[Rex Reed]]\n* [[Shannon Bolin]]\n* [[Rona Barrett]]\n* [[Eddie Muller]]\n* [[Gary Giddins]]\n* Neal Noorlag\n* [[Tamara Asseyev]]\n* [[Etchika Choureau]]\n* [[Earl Holliman]]\n\n\n=== Archive footage ===\n\n* [[Natalie Wood]]\n* [[Paul Newman]]\n* [[James Dean]]\n* [[Rock Hudson]]\n* [[Anthony Perkins]]\n* [[Perry Como]]\n* [[Steve Allen]]\n* [[Pat Boone]]\n* [[Art Linkletter]]\n\n== Reception and awards ==\n\nReceiving favorable reviews from critics, ''Tab Hunter Confidential'' has been praised for its portrait not only of Hunter, but of Hollywood during the actor's heyday.

It was first published in hardcover and ebook by [[Del Rey Books]] in July 2019, followed by a trade paperback edition from the same publisher in February 2020. The first British edition was issued in trade paperback by [[Quercus (publisher)|Jo Fletcher Books]] in February 2020.<ref name=\"ISFDB\">{{isfdb title|id=2574799}}</ref>\n\n==Summary==\nThe story is set in the late 1920s as [[Mexico]] emerges from its [[Mexican Revolution|revolutionary era]] into the [[Jazz Age]]. After her father dies, Casiopea Tun and her mother move back to their native [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] town of Uukumil in the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula|Yucat\u00e1n]], where she grows up as an unwanted poor relation in her wealthy grandfather\u2019s house. She is especially tormented by her spoiled, bitter cousin Mart\u00edn Leyva. At eighteen, Casiopea works as a servant for her grandfather, dreaming of escape.\n\nIn a forbidden chest in her grandfather\u2019s bedroom, she discovers the bones of the Mayan death god Hun-Kam\u00e9, one of the [[Maya Hero Twins]]. A shard of bone pierces her thumb, restoring Hun-Kam\u00e9 to a semblance of life. Bound to Casiopea, the god enlists her in his quest to regain his missing body parts, which his twin brother and rival Vucub-Kam\u00e9 has scattered throughout Mexico and left in the keeping of sorcerers, demons, and other supernatural entities. Once he is whole, he hopes to retake rulership of [[Xibalba]], the Mayan underworld, from which he has been deposed by his brother. \n\nTheir journey takes them throughout Mexico, from Yucat\u00e1n to [[Veracruz]], [[Mexico City]], [[El Paso]], and [[Baja California]]. Their parasitic relationship powers their quest, as Casiopea sacrifices more and more of her vitality to Hun-Kam\u00e9 , and he in turn takes on more and more of the attributes of mortality. Throughout, they must deal with the machinations of the god\u2019s brother and his inhuman and human allies, particularly Casiopea\u2019s cousin Mart\u00edn, who serves Vucub-Kam\u00e9 much as she does Hun-Kam\u00e9.\n\nThe root of the gods\u2019 rivalry lies in Vucub-Kam\u00e9\u2019s lust to restore the bloody sacrifices and glories of Mayan and [[Aztecs|Aztec]] times, which Hun-Kam\u00e9 is content to leave in the past. Their rivalry ends with both their mortal proxies consigned to Xibalba for a deceptively simple contest; walking the Black Road to the Jade Palace, with the lives of the twin death gods and the fate of the world as the stakes. The one who reaches the palace first wins, but to stray from the road means suffering ''k\u2019up kaal'', the ritual beheading to slake the blood-thirst of the underworld pantheon.\n\n==Reception==\nIn a starred review, ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' states the author \"crafts a magical novel of duality, tradition, and change ...
