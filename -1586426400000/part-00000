Burial sites dating back to the [[Neolithic Age]] and the [[Bronze Age]] include the oldest known such inland site at [[Jebel Al-Buhais|Jebel Buhais]]. Known as [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] to the [[Sumer]]ians, the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm Al Nar period]], which traded between the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley]], [[Dilmun|Bahrain]] and [[Mesopotamia]] as well as [[Iran]], [[Bactria]] and the [[Levant]]. The ensuing [[Wadi Suq culture|Wadi Suq period]] and three [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron Ages]] saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior. The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] and the subsequent [[Battle of Dibba]]. The UAE's long history of trade led to the emergence of [[Julfar]], in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area. The maritime dominance of the Persian Gulf by Emirati traders led to conflicts with European powers, including the [[Portuguese Empire]] and the [[British Empire]].\n\nFollowing decades of maritime conflict, the coastal emirates became known as the [[Trucial States]] with the signing of a Perpetual Treaty of Maritime Peace with the British in 1819 (ratified in 1853 and again in 1892), which established the Trucial States as a British [[Protectorate]]. This arrangement ended with independence and the establishment of the United Arab Emirates on 2 December 1971, immediately following the British withdrawal from its treaty obligations. Six emirates joined the UAE in 1971, the seventh, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the federation on 10 February 1972.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|publisher=Motivate|year=2004|isbn=9781860631672|location=|page=370}}</ref>\n\n[[Islam]] is the [[official religion]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is the official language of the UAE.

From the second century AD, there was a movement of tribes from Al Bahreyn towards the lower Gulf, together with a migration among the Azdite Qahtani (or Yamani) and Quda'ah tribal groups from south-west Arabia towards central Oman.\n\n===Islam===\nThe spread of Islam to the North Eastern tip of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] is thought to have followed directly from a letter sent by the Islamic Prophet, [[Muhammad]], to the rulers of Oman in 630 AD, nine years after the [[Hegira|hijrah]].

The [[First World War]] had a severe impact on the industry, but it was the [[depression (economics)|economic depression]] of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the invention of the [[cultured pearl]], that wiped out the trade.

Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC.<ref>{{Cite book|title = From Pearls to Oil|last = Heard|first = David|work= Motivate|year = 2013|isbn = 9781860633119|location = UAE|pages = 41\u201342}}</ref> APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the [[Red Line Agreement]], which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries such as Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=off|adj=mid|-deep}} bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of \u00a31 million.\n\n[[File:Mid-20th century Dubai.JPG|thumb|left|Dubai in 1950; the area in this photo shows [[Bur Dubai]] in the foreground (centered on Al-Fahidi Fort); [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]] in middle-right on the other side of the creek; and [[Al Shindagha]] (left) and [[Al Ras, Dubai|Al Ras]] (right) in the background across the creek again from Deira]]\nThe British set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates.

Most of the coast consists of [[Salt pan (geology)|salt pans]] that extend far inland. The largest [[harbor|natural harbor]] is at Dubai, although other ports have been dredged at Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and elsewhere. Numerous islands are found in the Persian Gulf, and the ownership of some of them has been the subject of international disputes with both Iran and Qatar. The smaller islands, as well as many [[coral reef]]s and shifting sandbars, are a menace to navigation. Strong tides and occasional windstorms further complicate ship movements near the shore. The UAE also has a stretch of the [[Al Batinah Region|Al B\u0101\u0163inah]] coast of the Gulf of Oman, although the [[Musandam Governorate|Musandam Peninsula]], the very tip of Arabia by the Strait of Hormuz, is an [[enclave and exclave|exclave]] of Oman separated by the UAE.\n\nSouth and west of Abu Dhabi, vast, rolling [[dune|sand dunes]] merge into the Rub al-Khali (Empty Quarter) of Saudi Arabia.

About {{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on}} to the northeast of Liwa is the [[Al Buraimi Governorate|Al-Buraimi]] oasis, which extends on both sides of the Abu Dhabi-Oman border. [[Lake Zakher]] is a [[Man-made lake|human-made lake]] near the border with Oman.\n\nPrior to withdrawing from the area in 1971, Britain delineated the internal borders among the seven emirates in order to preempt territorial disputes that might hamper formation of the federation. In general, the rulers of the emirates accepted the British intervention, but in the case of boundary disputes between Abu Dhabi and Dubai, and also between Dubai and Sharjah, conflicting claims were not resolved until after the UAE became independent. The most complicated borders were in the [[Al Hajar Mountains|Al-Hajar al-Gharbi]] Mountains, where five of the emirates contested jurisdiction over more than a dozen enclaves.\n\n===Flora and fauna===\n[[File:1501200713074 Acacia tortilis.jpg|thumb|[[Acacia]] trees growing in desert suburbs near [[Fujairah]]]]\nThe oases grow [[Phoenix dactylifera|date palms]], [[acacia]] and [[eucalyptus]] trees. In the desert, the flora is very sparse and consists of [[grasses]] and thorn bushes. The indigenous fauna had come close to extinction because of intensive hunting, which has led to a conservation program on [[Sir Bani Yas]] Island initiated by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan in the 1970s, resulting in the survival of, for example, [[Arabian Oryx]], [[Arabian camel]] and [[leopard]]s.

This growth is mainly due to the influx of foreign workers into the country, making the national population a minority. The UAE features a unique labour market system, in which residence in the UAE is conditional on stringent visa rules. This system is a major advantage in terms of macroeconomic stability, as labour supply adjusts quickly to demand throughout economic business cycles. This allows the Government to keep unemployment in the country on a very low level of less than 3%, and it also gives the Government more leeway in terms of macroeconomic policies \u2013 where other governments often need to make trade-offs between fighting unemployment and fighting inflation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, the accommodation and food, education, information and communication, arts and recreation, and real estate sectors overperformed in terms of growth, whereas the construction, logistics, professional services, public, and oil and gas sectors underperformed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Business and finance===\n[[File:Abu dhabi skylines 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Abu Dhabi skyline]]\nThe UAE offers businesses a strong enabling environment: stable political and macroeconomic conditions, a future-oriented Government, good general infrastructure and ICT infrastructure.

This policy makes sense in the current situation of global and regional economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Also considering the fact that exports have become the main driver of the UAE's economic growth (the contribution of international trade to GDP grew from 31% in 2017 to 33.5% in 2018, outpacing overall GDP growth for the period), and the fact that the AED is currently undervalued, a departure from this policy \u2013 and particularly the peg \u2013 would negatively affect this important part of the UAE economy in the short term. In the mid- to long term, however, the peg will become less important, as the UAE transitions to a knowledge-based economy \u2013 and becomes yet more independent from the oil and gas sector (oil is currently still being traded not in AED, but in USD). On the contrary, it will become more and more important for the Government to have monetary policy at its free disposal to target inflation, shun too heavy reliance on taxes, and avoid situations where decisions on exchange rates and interest rates contradict fiscal policy measures \u2013 as has been the case in recent years, where monetary policy has limited fiscal policy effects on economic expansion.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAccording to [[Fitch Ratings]], the decline in property sector follows risks of progressively worsening the quality of assets in possession with UAE banks, leading the economy to rougher times ahead. Even though as compared to retail and property, UAE banks fared well. The higher US interest rates followed since 2016 - which the UAE currency complies to - have boosted profitability. However, the likelihood of plunging interest rates and increasing provisioning costs on bad loans, point to difficult times ahead for the [[economy]].<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3d537bae-cf30-11e9-b018-ca4456540ea6|title= UAE banks prepare for rough ride ahead|accessdate=18 October 2019|website=Financial Times}}</ref>\n\nSince 2015, economic growth has been more mixed due to a number of factors impacting both demand and supply. In 2017 and 2018 growth has been positive but on a low level of 0.8 and 1.4%, respectively. To support the economy the Government is currently following an expansionary fiscal policy. However, the effects of this policy are partially offset by monetary policy, which has been contractionary. If not for the fiscal stimulus in 2018, the UAE economy would probably have contracted in that year. One of the factors responsible for slower growth has been a credit crunch, which is due to, among other factors, higher interest rates. Government debt has remained on a low level, despite high deficits in a few recent years. Risks related to government debt remain low. Inflation has been picking up in 2017 and 18. Contributing factors were the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) of 5% in 2018 as well as higher commodity prices. Despite the Government's expansionary fiscal policy and a growing economy in 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, prices have been dropping in late 2018 and 2019 owing to oversupply in some sectors of importance to consumer prices.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Oil and gas===\nThe UAE leadership has driven forward economic diversification efforts already before the oil price crash in the 1980s, and the UAE is nowadays the most diversified economy in the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]] (MENA) region. Although the oil and gas sector does still play an important role in the UAE economy, these efforts have paid off in terms of great resilience during periods of oil price fluctuations and economic turbulence. In 2018, the oil and gas sector contributed 26% to overall GDP. The introduction of the [[Value-added tax|VAT]] has provided the Government with an additional source of income \u2013 approximately 6% of the total revenue in 2018, or 27 billion [[United Arab Emirates dirham|United Arab Emirates Dirham]] (AED) \u2013 affording its fiscal policy more independence from oil- and gas-related revenue, which constitutes about 36% of the total Government revenue. While the Government may still adjust the exact arrangement of the VAT, it is not likely that any new taxes will be introduced in the foreseeable future. Additional taxes would destroy one of the UAE's main enticements for businesses to operate in the country and put a heavy burden on the economy.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Dubai Marina Beach Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Dubai Marina]] Beach]]\n\nTourism acts as a growth sector for the entire UAE economy.

Burial sites dating back to the [[Neolithic Age]] and the [[Bronze Age]] include the oldest known such inland site at [[Jebel Al-Buhais|Jebel Buhais]]. Known as [[Magan (civilization)|Magan]] to the [[Sumer]]ians, the area was home to a prosperous Bronze Age trading culture during the [[Umm al-Nar culture|Umm Al Nar period]], which traded between the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley]], [[Dilmun|Bahrain]] and [[Mesopotamia]] as well as [[Iran]], [[Bactria]] and the [[Levant]]. The ensuing [[Wadi Suq culture|Wadi Suq period]] and three [[Iron Age in the United Arab Emirates|Iron Ages]] saw the emergence of nomadism as well as the development of water management and irrigation systems supporting human settlement in both the coast and interior. The Islamic age of the UAE dates back to the expulsion of the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanians]] and the subsequent [[Battle of Dibba]]. The UAE's long history of trade led to the emergence of [[Julfar]], in the present-day emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, as a major regional trading and maritime hub in the area. The maritime dominance of the Persian Gulf by Emirati traders led to conflicts with European powers, including the [[Portuguese Empire]] and the [[British Empire]].\n\nFollowing decades of maritime conflict, the coastal emirates became known as the [[Trucial States]] with the signing of a Perpetual Treaty of Maritime Peace with the British in 1819 (ratified in 1853 and again in 1892), which established the Trucial States as a British [[Protectorate]]. This arrangement ended with independence and the establishment of the United Arab Emirates on 2 December 1971, immediately following the British withdrawal from its treaty obligations. Six emirates joined the UAE in 1971, the seventh, Ras Al Khaimah, joined the federation on 10 February 1972.<ref>{{Cite book|title=From Trucial States to United Arab Emirates|last=Heard-Bey|first=Frauke|publisher=Motivate|year=2004|isbn=9781860631672|location=|page=370}}</ref>\n\n[[Islam]] is the [[official religion]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] is the official language of the UAE.

Khawr al Udayd was claimed by Abu Dhabi at that time, a claim supported by the British. In 1906, the British Political Resident, [[Percy Cox]], confirmed in writing to the ruler of Abu Dhabi, [[Zayed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan]] ('Zayed the Great') that Khawr al Udayd belonged to his sheikhdom.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morton|first1=Michael Quentin|title=Keepers of the Golden Shore: A History of the United Arab Emirates |date=15 February 2016|publisher=Reaktion Books|location=London|isbn= 9781780235806|pages=49\u201350 |url=http://www.reaktionbooks.co.uk/display.asp?ISB=9781780235806 |accessdate=19 February 2017}}</ref>\n\n===British era and discovery of oil===\nDuring the 19th and early 20th centuries, the [[pearl hunting|pearling industry]] thrived, providing both income and employment to the people of the Persian Gulf. The [[First World War]] had a severe impact on the industry, but it was the [[depression (economics)|economic depression]] of the late 1920s and early 1930s, coupled with the invention of the [[cultured pearl]], that wiped out the trade. The remnants of the trade eventually faded away shortly after the [[Second World War]], when the newly-independent [[Government of India]] imposed heavy taxation on pearls imported from the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf]]. The decline of pearling resulted in extreme economic hardship in the Trucial States.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp |title=UAE History & Traditions: Pearls & pearling |work=UAEinteract |accessdate=12 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206103534/http://www.uaeinteract.com/history/trad/trd08.asp |archivedate=6 February 2016  }}</ref>\n\nIn 1922, the British government secured undertakings from the rulers of the Trucial States not to sign concessions with foreign companies without their consent. Aware of the potential for the development of natural resources such as oil, following finds in Persia (from 1908) and Mesopotamia (from 1927), a British-led oil company, the [[Iraq Petroleum Company]] (IPC), showed an interest in the region. The [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (APOC, later to become British Petroleum, or BP) had a 23.75% share in IPC. From 1935, onshore concessions to explore for oil were granted by local rulers, with APOC signing the first one on behalf of Petroleum Concessions Ltd (PCL), an associate company of IPC.<ref>{{Cite book|title = From Pearls to Oil|last = Heard|first = David|work= Motivate|year = 2013|isbn = 9781860633119|location = UAE|pages = 41\u201342}}</ref> APOC was prevented from developing the region alone because of the restrictions of the [[Red Line Agreement]], which required it to operate through IPC. A number of options between PCL and the trucial rulers were signed, providing useful revenue for communities experiencing poverty following the collapse of the pearl trade. However, the wealth of oil which the rulers could see from the revenues accruing to surrounding countries such as Iran, Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar and Saudi Arabia remained elusive. The first bore holes in Abu Dhabi were drilled by IPC's operating company, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC) at Ras Sadr in 1950, with a {{convert|13000|ft|m|abbr=off|adj=mid|-deep}} bore hole taking a year to drill and turning out dry, at the tremendous cost at the time of \u00a31 million.\n\n[[File:Mid-20th century Dubai.JPG|thumb|left|Dubai in 1950; the area in this photo shows [[Bur Dubai]] in the foreground (centered on Al-Fahidi Fort); [[Deira, Dubai|Deira]] in middle-right on the other side of the creek; and [[Al Shindagha]] (left) and [[Al Ras, Dubai|Al Ras]] (right) in the background across the creek again from Deira]]\nThe British set up a development office that helped in some small developments in the emirates. The seven [[sheikhs]] of the emirates then decided to form a council to coordinate matters between them and took over the development office.

BP joined with [[Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise des P\u00e9troles]] (later [[Total S.A.|Total]]) to form operating companies, Abu Dhabi Marine Areas Ltd (ADMA) and Dubai Marine Areas Ltd (DUMA).

This was the first commercial discovery of the Trucial Coast, leading to the first exports of oil in 1962.

Nowadays the UAE is one of the world's richest countries, with GDP per capita almost 80% higher than OECD average.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAs impressive as economic growth has been in the UAE, the total population has increased from just around 550,000 in 1975 to close to 10 million in 2018. This growth is mainly due to the influx of foreign workers into the country, making the national population a minority. The UAE features a unique labour market system, in which residence in the UAE is conditional on stringent visa rules. This system is a major advantage in terms of macroeconomic stability, as labour supply adjusts quickly to demand throughout economic business cycles. This allows the Government to keep unemployment in the country on a very low level of less than 3%, and it also gives the Government more leeway in terms of macroeconomic policies \u2013 where other governments often need to make trade-offs between fighting unemployment and fighting inflation.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nBetween 2014 and 2018, the accommodation and food, education, information and communication, arts and recreation, and real estate sectors overperformed in terms of growth, whereas the construction, logistics, professional services, public, and oil and gas sectors underperformed.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Business and finance===\n[[File:Abu dhabi skylines 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Abu Dhabi skyline]]\nThe UAE offers businesses a strong enabling environment: stable political and macroeconomic conditions, a future-oriented Government, good general infrastructure and ICT infrastructure.

This policy makes sense in the current situation of global and regional economic and geopolitical uncertainty. Also considering the fact that exports have become the main driver of the UAE's economic growth (the contribution of international trade to GDP grew from 31% in 2017 to 33.5% in 2018, outpacing overall GDP growth for the period), and the fact that the AED is currently undervalued, a departure from this policy \u2013 and particularly the peg \u2013 would negatively affect this important part of the UAE economy in the short term. In the mid- to long term, however, the peg will become less important, as the UAE transitions to a knowledge-based economy \u2013 and becomes yet more independent from the oil and gas sector (oil is currently still being traded not in AED, but in USD). On the contrary, it will become more and more important for the Government to have monetary policy at its free disposal to target inflation, shun too heavy reliance on taxes, and avoid situations where decisions on exchange rates and interest rates contradict fiscal policy measures \u2013 as has been the case in recent years, where monetary policy has limited fiscal policy effects on economic expansion.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nAccording to [[Fitch Ratings]], the decline in property sector follows risks of progressively worsening the quality of assets in possession with UAE banks, leading the economy to rougher times ahead. Even though as compared to retail and property, UAE banks fared well. The higher US interest rates followed since 2016 - which the UAE currency complies to - have boosted profitability. However, the likelihood of plunging interest rates and increasing provisioning costs on bad loans, point to difficult times ahead for the [[economy]].<ref>{{cite_web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3d537bae-cf30-11e9-b018-ca4456540ea6|title= UAE banks prepare for rough ride ahead|accessdate=18 October 2019|website=Financial Times}}</ref>\n\nSince 2015, economic growth has been more mixed due to a number of factors impacting both demand and supply. In 2017 and 2018 growth has been positive but on a low level of 0.8 and 1.4%, respectively. To support the economy the Government is currently following an expansionary fiscal policy. However, the effects of this policy are partially offset by monetary policy, which has been contractionary. If not for the fiscal stimulus in 2018, the UAE economy would probably have contracted in that year. One of the factors responsible for slower growth has been a credit crunch, which is due to, among other factors, higher interest rates. Government debt has remained on a low level, despite high deficits in a few recent years. Risks related to government debt remain low. Inflation has been picking up in 2017 and 18. Contributing factors were the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) of 5% in 2018 as well as higher commodity prices. Despite the Government's expansionary fiscal policy and a growing economy in 2018 and at the beginning of 2019, prices have been dropping in late 2018 and 2019 owing to oversupply in some sectors of importance to consumer prices.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Oil and gas===\nThe UAE leadership has driven forward economic diversification efforts already before the oil price crash in the 1980s, and the UAE is nowadays the most diversified economy in the [[MENA|Middle East and North Africa]] (MENA) region. Although the oil and gas sector does still play an important role in the UAE economy, these efforts have paid off in terms of great resilience during periods of oil price fluctuations and economic turbulence. In 2018, the oil and gas sector contributed 26% to overall GDP. The introduction of the [[Value-added tax|VAT]] has provided the Government with an additional source of income \u2013 approximately 6% of the total revenue in 2018, or 27 billion [[United Arab Emirates dirham|United Arab Emirates Dirham]] (AED) \u2013 affording its fiscal policy more independence from oil- and gas-related revenue, which constitutes about 36% of the total Government revenue. While the Government may still adjust the exact arrangement of the VAT, it is not likely that any new taxes will be introduced in the foreseeable future. Additional taxes would destroy one of the UAE's main enticements for businesses to operate in the country and put a heavy burden on the economy.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Tourism===\n[[File:Dubai Marina Beach Panorama.jpg|thumb|[[Dubai Marina]] Beach]]\n\nTourism acts as a growth sector for the entire UAE economy.

''El Aston'' was founded in 1943, and played in the [[Liga MX]] of Mexico. Their nickname, \"Tiburones Rojos\", means red sharks. \n\nIn December 2019, the [[Mexican Football Federation]] announced the disaffiliation of Veracruz from Liga MX due to economic debts with first team players, its youth system, and the league.<ref> http://ligamx.net/cancha/detallenoticia/32956/se-revoca-certificado-de-afiliacion-al-club-tiburones-rojos-de-veracruz</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe club was founded around April 1943 under the name of '''Club Deportivo Veracruz''' after two clubs from the city state of [[Veracruz]], [[Iberia de C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Veracruz Sporting Club]], merged in order to join the [[Mexican Primera Divisi\u00f3n|Mexican First Division]]. At the time, both clubs played in Liga Veracruzana, an amateur league in Veracruz. These two clubs had dominated the [[Liga Amateur de Veracruz]], winning 21 titles combined. Each of these clubs had a short stay in the [[Primera Fuerza]] \u2013 a now defunct amateur football league in [[Mexico City]] \u2013 in the early 1920s but due to the distance, the clubs generally played in the local league which was less competitive. The club kept the [[Veracruz Sporting Club]] colors, red and black, which they used in the early part of its existence and a few years later would switch the black to white, keeping red as the club's main shirt color. In their first year the club played in [[Parque Deportivo Veracruzano]] sharing the field with baseball club [[Rojos del \u00c1guila de Veracruz]]. The club's nickname was given by Manuel Seyde who had also help merge the two clubs. The club had the honor of having been one of the first clubs to play in the professional league as well as having been the first club not from [[Mexico City]] to win the tournament. Among other records the club holds is most relegations (four times) including being relegated in 2008 by its hated rival [[Puebla F.C.|Puebla]] who had just been promoted the year before. The club has played in the [[Liga de Ascenso]] ever since, coming close to promotion a couple of times but falling short each time.\n\nThe club played its first game in the 1943\u201344 [[Copa M\u00e9xico]] tournament against [[Atlante F.C.|Atlante]] who beat them 5\u20131. The club's first goal was scored by Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Angues, nicknamed as Manol\u00edn.\n\nIn their 1945\u201346 league Veracruz played 18 games with a streak of 14 wins and 4 draws. Veracruz also won their first title in that year. In the season 1947\u201348 they won their first Mexican Cup by beating the Chivas 3\u20131. Soon Veracruz won their second title, in the 1949\u201350 season, with the most overwhelming victory in the history of Mexican football, beating Monterrey, 14\u20130.\n\nYears later Veracruz acquired famous players such as [[Ren\u00e9 Higuita]], [[Braulio Luna]], [[Adolfo R\u00edos]], [[Luis Hern\u00e1ndez (footballer)|Luis Hern\u00e1ndez]], [[Fernando Arce]], [[Alfredo Tena]] and others. After being relegated to the Primera Divisi\u00f3n A Veracruz came back in 2002 after being declared Primera Divisi\u00f3n A champions and finished 11th place in the Summer of 2002. The Apertura 2004 season had been one of the best for Veracruz as they finished 1st place thanks to new signings such as [[Cuauht\u00e9moc Blanco]], [[Christian Gim\u00e9nez (1981)|Christian Gim\u00e9nez]], [[Kl\u00e9ber Boas]] and others. Veracruz has had 59 managers so far, as of 2008. On the night of Friday April 25, 2008 at Luis \"Pirata\" Fuente stadium (Home of the Tiburones Rojos de Veracruz), [[Club Universidad Nacional|UNAM]] defeated Veracruz with a final score of 4\u20132, sending Veracruz to the [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n A|Primera A]] division league. Veracruz was officially relegated from the Mexican Primera Divisi\u00f3n league on the night of Friday May 2, 2008 in the final match of the regular season against Tecos UAG ending in a 0\u20130 draw.\n\n===First title===\n[[File:1945 Veracruz FC.png|thumb|right|1945\u201346 championship club.]]\nIn the club's third year of existence in the 1945\u201346 tournament, the club went on to win 18 games with a record of 14 wins and 4 draws, managing to win 8 straight. The club scored 105 goals that year, leading the club in scoring was the Argentine Jorge Enrico followed by Raimundo Gonzalez with 24. [[Luis de la Fuente (Mexican footballer)|Luis de la Fuente]] was considered the club's best player because of his unique playing style.\n\nIt was on 2 June 1946, in the second to last round of the tournament in the ''Parque Asturias'' in Mexico City, home of [[Real Club Espa\u00f1a]] where the club won 2\u20133 and so were able to claim themselves champions for the first time. With goals scored by Jos\u00e9 Valdivia, [[Luis de la Fuente (Mexican footballer)|Luis de la Fuente]] and Raimundo Gonzalez, they ended a 26-year streak of the tournament being won by a club from [[Mexico City]]. That same year the club went on to lose the [[Campe\u00f3n de Campeones]] title against [[Club Atlas|Atlas]].\n\n===First Copa M\u00e9xico title===\nIn the 1947\u201348 [[Copa M\u00e9xico]] tournament, with the departure of the club's best players (the [[Argentine]] Jorge Enrico along with other good players such as Lazcano and Pachuco Dur\u00e1n, and maybe the club's most important trainer, Palomini) the still club managed to win its first Copa M\u00e9xico. The final was played against [[C.D. Guadalajara|Guadalajara]] with a final score of 3\u20131 under the management of the [[Spaniard]] Joaquin Urquiaga. That is the only cup to date the club has won, finishing runner-up 3 times: in 1949\u201350, 1967\u201368 and 1994\u201395.\n\n===Second title===\n\nIn the 1949\u201350 tournament the club managed to win its last [[Mexican Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] title till date. The club started off that year with a rejuvenated squad led by Juan Luque de Serrallonga who had just come from a stay with the [[Mexico national football team]] the year before. This year is also remembered because the club had its first goal scoring champion: the [[Peruvian]] Julio Ayllon, also known as El Negro, black promotional football players in Mexico being uncommon at that time; Julio went on to score 30 goals that year.\n\n===The end of a Golden Era===\nThe club welcomed the new decade with the start of the end of its golden age. The 1950\u201351 tournament became the first losing year due to economical problems the club faced under the ownership of Miguel Alem\u00e1n Valdez and governor of the state Marco Antonio Mu\u00f1oz.\n\nThe worst season came in the 1951\u201352 tournament after a long relegation fight that came down to the end against [[Club Am\u00e9rica]]; they lost and were relegated for the first time in history to the newly created [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]]. That year the club finished with a record of 3 wins, 6 draws, and 13 losses allowing 54 goals and only scoring 22 for a total of 12 points, just 3 behind Club Am\u00e9rica (who kept the category and is one of two clubs that has never been relegated since the professionalization of the sport in Mexico).\n\nIn the 1952\u201353 tournament, playing in the [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]], the club finished the year just one point away from been promoted behind [[Deportivo Toluca F.C.|Toluca]], who has played in the first division ever since. After that disappointing year almost all the players left the club following the 1953 cup tournament. As a result, the leagues decided to disband the club.\n\n===Return 1960s\u20131970s===\nIn 1961, thanks to a group of supporters, they established a [[patronage]] in which Jos\u00e9 Lajud Kuri was named president and so revived the club in order to take part in the 1961\u201362 [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]] tournament. The first couple of years were mediocre and they didn't have any success.\n\nIn 1964 the club was presented with an opportunity to be promoted after the league decided to increase the number of clubs from 14 to 16. That year, the worst first division club, [[Nacional de Guadalajara]], played a promotional playoff tournament against [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]] [[Petroleros de Ciudad Madero]]. [[Poza Rica]] and [[Veracruz]] had finished 2nd, 3rd and 4th (not counting [[Cruz Azul]] who had earn an automatic promotion after winning the tournament). That tournament ended with [[Nacional de Guadalajara]] and Veracruz earning first and second with [[Petroleros de Ciudad Madero]] third and [[Poza Rica]] fourth. The club had returned to the first division after 12 years of bitter, bitter waiting.\n\nIn the 1964\u201365 first division tournament the club played their first game on June 7, 1964 against [[Monarcas Morelia|Atletico Morelia]] in the city of [[Morelia]] in a 3\u20133 draw.

Their best game was played in the 8th round when they defeated [[Zacatepec]] 5\u20131. In 1978\u201379 the club was relegated for the second time after losing 22 games allowing 83 goals and finishing last in the competition. One thing to mention is that the club had five different trainers that year. One week before their last game in the first division the club secured their relegation after losing, 5\u20132, against [[Club Universidad de Guadalajara]] in the city of [[Guadalajara]]. The last game the club played in that tournament was against [[Tigres de la UANL]] one June 3, 1979, at home where they had a draw of 1\u20131 and so ended their second stay in the first division while ending another decade.\n\n===1980s===\nThe club started the 1980s in the [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]] . After the 1983\u201384 tournament the club was sold to the city of [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]] where it became [[Venados de Yucat\u00e1n]]. This club lasted a couple years before folding in 1998.\n\nAfter several years of not having a football club representing the state of Veracruz, various attempts were made in order revive the club. One such was to buy the [[\u00c1ngeles de Puebla]] franchise which at the time was on sale due to the lack of supporters. The club had been in the same city as [[Puebla F.C.|Puebla]] who had won two league titles and 2 [[Copa M\u00e9xico]] titles in the 1980s. But in 1989, a group of local businessmen along with funding by the governor of the city of Veracruz bought the newly promoted club [[Potros Neza]] which at the time was affiliated with first division club [[Atlante F.C.|Atlante]]. The club played their first tournament game that same year and lost to Puebla under the management of H\u00e9ctor Sanabria. That year the club finished 5th in group 4 with a total of 34 - nonetheless the club managed to win over supporters by been a club that played with a lot of heart.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=February 2017}} Players such as Davidovich, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Marroqu\u00edn, Casta\u00f1on, Salcedo, Pascual Ram\u00edrez, Jardon [[Eduardo Rergis]], Eduardo Moses, [[Omar Palma]], and [[Jorge Comas (footballer)|Jorge Comas]] stood out. That year is remembered as La Tiburomania because no matter where the club played it always had a great deal{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=February 2017}} of support no matter the distance. The club return started a euphoria in the city in the 1989\u201390 tournament when the club had 19 straight sell-outs. It all came to a climax when the club played top club [[Club Am\u00e9rica]] in the [[Estadio Azteca]] where 50,000 Veracruz supporters poured into a stadium with a capacity of 114,000 and they set a record for the most supports attending an away game. That game ended in a 3\u20135 win for the home team in a controversial match refereed by Javier Castellanos.\n\nThat same year there was a four-way special tournament inviting Brazilian club [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]], Spanish club [[Real Madrid]] and local club [[Club Universidad Nacional|UNAM]]. [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]] ended up taking home the cup but the fans remember this tournament because the club beat [[Real Madrid]], 4\u20132, with a goal by the Argentine [[Omar Palma]].\n\n===1990s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\nThe 1990s began with a group of players and a fan base which became known as La Tiburomaniam who cheer own fan favorite players [[Jorge Comas (footballer)|Jorge Comas]] [[Adolfo R\u00edos]], [[Joaqu\u00edn Del Olmo]], Octavio Becerril, Pascual Ram\u00edrez, [[Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Gonz\u00e1lez China]] under management of the Brazilian Edu. The club failed to qualify to the play-offs after a long battle for 2nd place in group 3 against [[Cruz Azul]].\n\nIn the 1991\u201392 tournament the club give its supporters something to cheer for after a bad start of the tournament which caused the existed of them club taker [[\u00c1ngel L\u00f3pez (footballer)|Angel Lopez]] who was replaced by [[Roberto Matosas]]. After the change of trainer the club had a much better tournament which qualified the club to a knockout play-off series against [[Correcaminos UAT]] which they won, 4\u20133, which they handed done since the club was reform in 1970. The club faced [[Necaxa]] in quarterfinals where they lost, 6\u20132.\n\nIn the 1993\u201394 the club celebrated its 50 anniversary with a special ceremony prior to the tournament where former club greats reunited to play a special match. That preseason the club signed former greats [[Carlos Poblete (footballer)|Carlos Poblete]] and [[Rub\u00e9n Omar Romano]]. That year is also remembered for that great friendly match the club had against [[Atl\u00e9tico Madrid]].\n\nIn the 1994\u201395 tournament under the management of [[Anibal Ruiz]] who with a peculiar{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=February 2017}} defensive style of coaching made the fans lose interest in the club nonetheless the club qualified to play a knock-out match against its hated rival [[Puebla F.C.|Puebla]] who advanced to the quarterfinals after a 1\u20131 draw moving on due to a better position in the league. The club came close that year to winning the 1994\u201395 Copa M\u00e9xico title after beating [[Irapuato FC|Irapuato]], [[Estudiantes Tecos]] and [[Club Santos Laguna|Santos Laguna]] in that order facing [[Club Necaxa|Necaxa]] in the final match that took place in neutral ground in the [[Estadio Cuauht\u00e9moc]] in the city of [[Puebla (city)|Puebla]] where the club fell 2\u20130. In 1995 the club was sold to local TV network [[Televisa]] who brought in better playgoers to the club reviving once again the hopes of the supporters.\n\nIn the 1996\u201397 the new owners signed [[Jos\u00e9 Mari Bakero]] who had just finished a long career with Spanish giant [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] along with key players from the Colombian national team [[Leonel \u00c1lvarez (footballer, born 1965)|Leonel \u00c1lvarez]], [[Iv\u00e1n Valenciano]], [[Alexis Mendoza]] mating important players and fan favorite goalkeeper [[Adolfo R\u00edos]]. With the hype of the club's new players many gave the club a chance of taking the league title but after a tournament field with injuries and with a divided locker-room the club managed to gain only 9 points and finished last leaving the club in relegation problems for the nest campaign.\n\nIn the 1997\u201398 tournament the club let go most of the players bringing in the international known goalkeeper [[Ren\u00e9 Higuita]] along with players that were unknown in the league in order to avoid their 3rd relegation. With lack of experience the players had the club ended that tournament with a record of 3 wins, 5 draws losing 9 games for a total of 14 points and so once selling their 3rd relegation in club history.\n\nIn the Invierno del 98 playing now in the [[Liga de Ascenso|Primera A]] the club started their journey to return once again to the top division hiring Juan Manuel Alvarez who had achieved this task before with [[Club Celaya]] a few years back. With the supports still hurt by the relegation at mid tournament Juan Manuel Alvarez was replaced by \"El Turco\" Aude coach who had lots of experience in the league and managed to rally the players reaching the semi-finals that year, losing the series to [[Venados de Yucat\u00e1n]].\n\nIn 1999 the club was sold to city of [[Veracruz]] along with local business owners. The club had one of the worst seasons in its history that inverno 99 with a club mostly formed by veteran players along with young experienced players. In that tournament the club failed to qualify for the play-offs and the promotion seemed impossible each day \u2013 and that is how the club ended that decade with some strong clubs in the early part of the decade and with the club's third relation at the end of it.\n\n===2000s===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\nIn the 2000\u201301 tournament the club finally lived up to its expectation becoming a competitive club in the [[Liga de Ascenso|Primera A]] the first have under the management of [[Carlos Trucco]] and [[Roberto Saporiti]] in other half, these two managers went on to win several games that would qualify them to the playoff where they were eliminated but had revived interest in the locals. At the end of that tournament the first division expanded from 18 to 20 which promoted two clubs that year. [[C.F. La Piedad|La Piedad]] was promoted after winning the Verano 2001 [[Liga de Ascenso|Primera A]] tournament and going on to win the Promotion match against [[Toros Neza]].

''El Aston'' was founded in 1943, and played in the [[Liga MX]] of Mexico. Their nickname, \"Tiburones Rojos\", means red sharks. \n\nIn December 2019, the [[Mexican Football Federation]] announced the disaffiliation of Veracruz from Liga MX due to economic debts with first team players, its youth system, and the league.<ref> http://ligamx.net/cancha/detallenoticia/32956/se-revoca-certificado-de-afiliacion-al-club-tiburones-rojos-de-veracruz</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe club was founded around April 1943 under the name of '''Club Deportivo Veracruz''' after two clubs from the city state of [[Veracruz]], [[Iberia de C\u00f3rdoba]] and [[Veracruz Sporting Club]], merged in order to join the [[Mexican Primera Divisi\u00f3n|Mexican First Division]]. At the time, both clubs played in Liga Veracruzana, an amateur league in Veracruz. These two clubs had dominated the [[Liga Amateur de Veracruz]], winning 21 titles combined. Each of these clubs had a short stay in the [[Primera Fuerza]] \u2013 a now defunct amateur football league in [[Mexico City]] \u2013 in the early 1920s but due to the distance, the clubs generally played in the local league which was less competitive. The club kept the [[Veracruz Sporting Club]] colors, red and black, which they used in the early part of its existence and a few years later would switch the black to white, keeping red as the club's main shirt color. In their first year the club played in [[Parque Deportivo Veracruzano]] sharing the field with baseball club [[Rojos del \u00c1guila de Veracruz]]. The club's nickname was given by Manuel Seyde who had also help merge the two clubs. The club had the honor of having been one of the first clubs to play in the professional league as well as having been the first club not from [[Mexico City]] to win the tournament. Among other records the club holds is most relegations (four times) including being relegated in 2008 by its hated rival [[Puebla F.C.|Puebla]] who had just been promoted the year before. The club has played in the [[Liga de Ascenso]] ever since, coming close to promotion a couple of times but falling short each time.\n\nThe club played its first game in the 1943\u201344 [[Copa M\u00e9xico]] tournament against [[Atlante F.C.|Atlante]] who beat them 5\u20131. The club's first goal was scored by Manuel Rodr\u00edguez Angues, nicknamed as Manol\u00edn.\n\nIn their 1945\u201346 league Veracruz played 18 games with a streak of 14 wins and 4 draws. Veracruz also won their first title in that year. In the season 1947\u201348 they won their first Mexican Cup by beating the Chivas 3\u20131. Soon Veracruz won their second title, in the 1949\u201350 season, with the most overwhelming victory in the history of Mexican football, beating Monterrey, 14\u20130.\n\nYears later Veracruz acquired famous players such as [[Ren\u00e9 Higuita]], [[Braulio Luna]], [[Adolfo R\u00edos]], [[Luis Hern\u00e1ndez (footballer)|Luis Hern\u00e1ndez]], [[Fernando Arce]], [[Alfredo Tena]] and others. After being relegated to the Primera Divisi\u00f3n A Veracruz came back in 2002 after being declared Primera Divisi\u00f3n A champions and finished 11th place in the Summer of 2002. The Apertura 2004 season had been one of the best for Veracruz as they finished 1st place thanks to new signings such as [[Cuauht\u00e9moc Blanco]], [[Christian Gim\u00e9nez (1981)|Christian Gim\u00e9nez]], [[Kl\u00e9ber Boas]] and others. Veracruz has had 59 managers so far, as of 2008. On the night of Friday April 25, 2008 at Luis \"Pirata\" Fuente stadium (Home of the Tiburones Rojos de Veracruz), [[Club Universidad Nacional|UNAM]] defeated Veracruz with a final score of 4\u20132, sending Veracruz to the [[Primera Divisi\u00f3n A|Primera A]] division league. Veracruz was officially relegated from the Mexican Primera Divisi\u00f3n league on the night of Friday May 2, 2008 in the final match of the regular season against Tecos UAG ending in a 0\u20130 draw.\n\n===First title===\n[[File:1945 Veracruz FC.png|thumb|right|1945\u201346 championship club.]]\nIn the club's third year of existence in the 1945\u201346 tournament, the club went on to win 18 games with a record of 14 wins and 4 draws, managing to win 8 straight. The club scored 105 goals that year, leading the club in scoring was the Argentine Jorge Enrico followed by Raimundo Gonzalez with 24. [[Luis de la Fuente (Mexican footballer)|Luis de la Fuente]] was considered the club's best player because of his unique playing style.\n\nIt was on 2 June 1946, in the second to last round of the tournament in the ''Parque Asturias'' in Mexico City, home of [[Real Club Espa\u00f1a]] where the club won 2\u20133 and so were able to claim themselves champions for the first time. With goals scored by Jos\u00e9 Valdivia, [[Luis de la Fuente (Mexican footballer)|Luis de la Fuente]] and Raimundo Gonzalez, they ended a 26-year streak of the tournament being won by a club from [[Mexico City]]. That same year the club went on to lose the [[Campe\u00f3n de Campeones]] title against [[Club Atlas|Atlas]].\n\n===First Copa M\u00e9xico title===\nIn the 1947\u201348 [[Copa M\u00e9xico]] tournament, with the departure of the club's best players (the [[Argentine]] Jorge Enrico along with other good players such as Lazcano and Pachuco Dur\u00e1n, and maybe the club's most important trainer, Palomini) the still club managed to win its first Copa M\u00e9xico. The final was played against [[C.D. Guadalajara|Guadalajara]] with a final score of 3\u20131 under the management of the [[Spaniard]] Joaquin Urquiaga. That is the only cup to date the club has won, finishing runner-up 3 times: in 1949\u201350, 1967\u201368 and 1994\u201395.\n\n===Second title===\n\nIn the 1949\u201350 tournament the club managed to win its last [[Mexican Primera Divisi\u00f3n]] title till date. The club started off that year with a rejuvenated squad led by Juan Luque de Serrallonga who had just come from a stay with the [[Mexico national football team]] the year before. This year is also remembered because the club had its first goal scoring champion: the [[Peruvian]] Julio Ayllon, also known as El Negro, black promotional football players in Mexico being uncommon at that time; Julio went on to score 30 goals that year.\n\n===The end of a Golden Era===\nThe club welcomed the new decade with the start of the end of its golden age. The 1950\u201351 tournament became the first losing year due to economical problems the club faced under the ownership of Miguel Alem\u00e1n Valdez and governor of the state Marco Antonio Mu\u00f1oz.\n\nThe worst season came in the 1951\u201352 tournament after a long relegation fight that came down to the end against [[Club Am\u00e9rica]]; they lost and were relegated for the first time in history to the newly created [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]]. That year the club finished with a record of 3 wins, 6 draws, and 13 losses allowing 54 goals and only scoring 22 for a total of 12 points, just 3 behind Club Am\u00e9rica (who kept the category and is one of two clubs that has never been relegated since the professionalization of the sport in Mexico).\n\nIn the 1952\u201353 tournament, playing in the [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]], the club finished the year just one point away from been promoted behind [[Deportivo Toluca F.C.|Toluca]], who has played in the first division ever since. After that disappointing year almost all the players left the club following the 1953 cup tournament. As a result, the leagues decided to disband the club.\n\n===Return 1960s\u20131970s===\nIn 1961, thanks to a group of supporters, they established a [[patronage]] in which Jos\u00e9 Lajud Kuri was named president and so revived the club in order to take part in the 1961\u201362 [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]] tournament. The first couple of years were mediocre and they didn't have any success.\n\nIn 1964 the club was presented with an opportunity to be promoted after the league decided to increase the number of clubs from 14 to 16. That year, the worst first division club, [[Nacional de Guadalajara]], played a promotional playoff tournament against [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]] [[Petroleros de Ciudad Madero]]. [[Poza Rica]] and [[Veracruz]] had finished 2nd, 3rd and 4th (not counting [[Cruz Azul]] who had earn an automatic promotion after winning the tournament). That tournament ended with [[Nacional de Guadalajara]] and Veracruz earning first and second with [[Petroleros de Ciudad Madero]] third and [[Poza Rica]] fourth. The club had returned to the first division after 12 years of bitter, bitter waiting.\n\nIn the 1964\u201365 first division tournament the club played their first game on June 7, 1964 against [[Monarcas Morelia|Atletico Morelia]] in the city of [[Morelia]] in a 3\u20133 draw. The club's first goal since coming back was scored by Jesus Mercado. That year the club had a record of 10 wins, 8 draws, and 12 defeats; they scored 41 and allowed 44 for a total of 28 points and fishing 10 overall in the league. Their best game was played in the 8th round when they defeated [[Zacatepec]] 5\u20131. In 1978\u201379 the club was relegated for the second time after losing 22 games allowing 83 goals and finishing last in the competition. One thing to mention is that the club had five different trainers that year. One week before their last game in the first division the club secured their relegation after losing, 5\u20132, against [[Club Universidad de Guadalajara]] in the city of [[Guadalajara]]. The last game the club played in that tournament was against [[Tigres de la UANL]] one June 3, 1979, at home where they had a draw of 1\u20131 and so ended their second stay in the first division while ending another decade.\n\n===1980s===\nThe club started the 1980s in the [[Segunda Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico]] . After the 1983\u201384 tournament the club was sold to the city of [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]] where it became [[Venados de Yucat\u00e1n]]. This club lasted a couple years before folding in 1998.\n\nAfter several years of not having a football club representing the state of Veracruz, various attempts were made in order revive the club. One such was to buy the [[\u00c1ngeles de Puebla]] franchise which at the time was on sale due to the lack of supporters. The club had been in the same city as [[Puebla F.C.|Puebla]] who had won two league titles and 2 [[Copa M\u00e9xico]] titles in the 1980s. But in 1989, a group of local businessmen along with funding by the governor of the city of Veracruz bought the newly promoted club [[Potros Neza]] which at the time was affiliated with first division club [[Atlante F.C.|Atlante]]. The club played their first tournament game that same year and lost to Puebla under the management of H\u00e9ctor Sanabria. That year the club finished 5th in group 4 with a total of 34 - nonetheless the club managed to win over supporters by been a club that played with a lot of heart.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=February 2017}} Players such as Davidovich, Jos\u00e9 Lu\u00eds Marroqu\u00edn, Casta\u00f1on, Salcedo, Pascual Ram\u00edrez, Jardon [[Eduardo Rergis]], Eduardo Moses, [[Omar Palma]], and [[Jorge Comas (footballer)|Jorge Comas]] stood out. That year is remembered as La Tiburomania because no matter where the club played it always had a great deal{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=February 2017}} of support no matter the distance. The club return started a euphoria in the city in the 1989\u201390 tournament when the club had 19 straight sell-outs. It all came to a climax when the club played top club [[Club Am\u00e9rica]] in the [[Estadio Azteca]] where 50,000 Veracruz supporters poured into a stadium with a capacity of 114,000 and they set a record for the most supports attending an away game.
