In this episode, Fletcher finds something he stole has since been stolen, and this soon causes problems for others.\n\n==Synopsis==\nOne morning, Fletcher confronts his fellow inmates with news that a tin of pineapple chunks, which he had smuggled out of the prison's kitchens by Godber, has since been stolen. Fletcher believes there is a thief amongst the cell block, and later holds a meeting in his cell to discuss the matter further. After prison officer Mackay breaks it up for going against prison rules, suspicious of Fletcher's claims about what was going on, he frisks Godber after he returns from kitchen duty, but fails to find on him a smuggled block of margarine he had hidden under his chef's hat. That night, Godber and Fletcher get into an argument when the latter refuses to loan some boot polish, stating that while he believes Godber to be innocent, his trust has been misplaced since the theft of his tin.\n\nThe next morning, prison officer Barrowclough visits Fletcher in the library and reveals he took the tin, during a random search of his cell under Mackay's orders. Barrowclough decided to let him off the hook upon finding it, by not disclosing it to the other officers involved in the search, but made the unwise decision of taking it home, whereupon his wife consumed the contents. Fletcher reveals that Barrowclough will be in trouble if this gets out, prompting him to agree to buy a new one if Fletcher promises no more stealing and provides money for the new tin. Later that day, Godber decides to steal another tin for Fletcher during his kitchen duties and asks a fellow inmate to create a distraction to help conceal the act.\n\nHowever, the theft is soon discovered, and Godber is given a thorough search by Mackay when he arrives. Unbeknown to everyone, Barrowclough discreetly arrives and replaces the stolen tin with the one he bought, leading to Mackay scolding the officer who raised the alarm for wasting his time. That afternoon, Godber conceals the stolen tin as a surprise for Fletcher, only for Mackay to turn up when the pair are chatting. Upon discovering the tin, Mackay refuses to listen to Fletcher's pleading that it was a plant and is taken to see the governor. As he does, Godber heads to the landing and ask if anyone has a tin opener, much to Fletcher's chagrin.\n\n==Episode cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! Actor\n!

{"title_page": "Entryism", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2008}}\n{{Original research|date=May 2008}}\n}}\n\n'''Entryism''' (also spelled '''entrism''' or '''enterism''' or called '''infiltration''') is a [[political strategy]] in which an organisation or state encourages its members or supporters to join another, usually larger, organisation in an attempt to expand influence and expand their ideas and program. If the organization being \"entered\" is hostile to entrism, the entrists may engage in a degree of subterfuge and [[subversion]] to hide the fact that they are an organization in their own right.\n\n==Definitions==\nHorton (2014) gives the \"example of entryism \u2013 the infiltration of a self-proclaimed human rights activist into an institution committed to neoliberalism, a market fundamentalism that has been credited with eroding health systems in dozens of low and middle-income countries.\"<ref>Horton, Richard (2014) Offline: the Kim Doctrine ''[[The Lancet]]'', Sep 6, 2014, Vol.384(9946), p.840</ref> Leslie (1999) uses the example of gender: \"alternative, yet complementary, strategies of 'entryism', with attempts to enter and transform these institutions' gender inequalities from within (as missionaries).\"<ref>Leslie, A. (1999). Missionaries and Mandarins. ''[[United Nations Chronicle]]'', 36(2), 82-83.</ref>\n\n==Socialist entryism==\n===Trotsky's \"French Turn\"===\nThe \"[[French Turn]]\" refers to the classic form of entrism advocated by [[Leon Trotsky]] in his essays on \"The French Turn\". In June 1934, he proposed for the French Trotskyists to dissolve their Communist League and to join the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) and for the Communist League to dissolve its youth section to join more easily with revolutionary elements. The tactic was adopted in August 1934, despite some opposition, and successfully raised the group's membership to 300 activists.\n\nProponents of the tactic advocated that the Trotskyists should enter the [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties to connect with revolutionary socialist currents within them and then to steer those currents toward [[Leninism]]. However, entryism lasted briefly since the leadership of the SFIO started to expel the Trotskyists. The Trotskyists of the [[Workers Party of the United States]] also successfully used their entry into the [[Socialist Party of America]] to recruit their youth group and other members. Similar tactics were also used by Trotskyist organisations in other countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and Poland. Entryism was used to connect with and recruit leftward-moving political currents inside radical parties.\n\nSince it was used in France, Marxists have used the tactic even if they had different preconceptions of how long the period of entry would last:\n* A \"split perspective\" is sometimes employed in which the smaller party intends to remain in the larger party for a short period of time, with the intention of splitting the organisation and leaving with more members than it began with.\n* The entrist tactic can work successfully, in its own terms, over a long period. For example, it was attempted by the [[Militant tendency]] in the [[United Kingdom]], whose members worked within the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from the 1950s onward and managed to get control in the [[Labour Party Young Socialists]] and [[Liverpool City Council]] before it was expelled in the 1980s. Many other Trotskyist groups have attempted similar feats, but few have gained the influence that the Militant tendancy attained (See Militant's [http://www.marxist.net/openturn/historic/index.html Problems of Entrism] pamphlet).\n\n===Deep entryism ''sui generis''{{anchor|Deep entrism|Deep entryism|Entrism sui generis|Entryism sui generis}}===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\nIn these types of entryism, activists engage in a long-term perspective in which they work within an organisation for decades in the hope of gaining influence and a degree of power and perhaps even control of the larger organisation.\n\nIn entryism ''[[sui generis]]'' (\"of a special type\"), Trotskyists, for example, do not openly argue for the building of a Trotskyist party. \"Deep entryism\" refers to the long duration.\n\nThe tactic is closely identified with [[Michel Pablo]] and [[Gerry Healy]], who were leaders of the [[Fourth International]] in the late 1940s and the 1950s. The \"deep entry\" tactic was developed as a way for Trotskyists to respond to the [[Cold War]]. In countries with mass social democratic or communist parties, it was as difficult to be accepted into these parties as it was Trotskyist currents as to build separate Trotskyist parties. Therefore, Trotskyists were advised to join the mass party.\n\nIn Europe, that was the approach used, for example, by [[The Club (Trotskyist)|The Club]] and later [[Socialist Action (UK)|Socialist Action]] in the Labour Party,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11893986/Jeremy-Corbyns-top-team-encouraged-street-riots.html |title=Jeremy Corbyn's top team encouraged street riots |last=Gilligan |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Gilligan |date=26 September 2015 |website=[[telegraph.co.uk]] |access-date=2 April 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404121300/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11893986/Jeremy-Corbyns-top-team-encouraged-street-riots.html |archivedate=4 April 2018}}</ref> and by Fourth Internationalists inside the Communist Parties. In [[France]], Trotskyist organizations, most notably the ''[[Workers' Party (France)|Parti des Travailleurs]]'' and its predecessors, have successfully entered [[trade union]]s and mainstream [[left-wing]] parties.\n\n===Open entryism===\n{{See also|Platform (European politics)}}\nSome political parties, such as the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party in Brazil]] or the [[Scottish Socialist Party]], allow political tendencies to organise within them openly. In those cases, the term \"entryism\" is not usually used. Political groups that work within a larger organisation but also maintain a \"public face\" often reject the term \"entrism\" but are sometimes still considered to be entryists by the larger organization.\n\n==Examples by country==\n\n===Australia===\nIn [[Australia]], the practice was widespread during the 1950s, when the [[Communist Party of Australia]] battled against right-wing [[Industrial Groups]] for control of Australian [[trade unions]]. The 'Groupers' subsequently formed the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labor Party]]. Today, the practice in Australia is often known as a type of [[branch stacking]].\n\nIn recent times, [[RSPCA Australia]] has been described as being the victims of the practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2004/s1137257.htm|title=A Blind Eye\", ABC Four Corners|date=21 June 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810215129/http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2004/s1137257.htm|archivedate=10 August 2011}}</ref> The [[National Farmers' Federation]] and [[Animals Australia]] have each been accused of infiltrating branches RSPCA Australia in an attempt to promote opposing policies concerning [[battery hens]], [[intensive pig farming]], and the [[live export]] of sheep.\n\nSince the 2000s, the [[religious right]] has practiced entryism into a number of state branches of the [[Liberal Party of Australia]], notably in New South Wales, Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/whos-behind-the-safe-school-videos-the-concerned-mums-political-connections-20170811-gxukuu.html|title=Who's behind the Safe School videos?

While opponents pointed to the remarkable distance, Orchard and his supporters argued that they represented \"traditional\" Conservative values and the [[economic nationalism]] of the older [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]] and the Progressive Conservative Party had espoused before Mulroney, namely under [[John Diefenbaker]].\n\nOpponents of the 2003 merger between the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance also charged Alliance members with infiltration. It was widely speculated that most, if not all, of the approximately 25,000 Canadians who swelled the Progressive Conservative Party Party's membership before the merger vote were Alliance members, who likely voted in favour of the merger.\n\n[[Liberals for Life]], a [[pro-life]] group allied with the [[Campaign Life Coalition]], was accused of infiltrating the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] in the late 1980s and the early 1990s.\n\nMembers of [[Socialist Action (Canada)|Socialist Action]], a small Trotskyist group, play a leading role in the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] [[New Democratic Party Socialist Caucus|Socialist Caucus]], a small faction on the left wing of the [[social democracy|social democratic]] NDP, and advocate that their members join and engage with the NDP. That, however, does not fit with most definitions of entryism because of its continued existence apart and separate from the NDP, in addition to its work in it. [[Fightback (Canada)|Fightback]], a rival Trotskyist organization, carries out a more classical form of entryism in the NDP, particularly in its youth wings, and models itself after the British [[Militant tendency]], which practiced entryism into the Labour Party and, at its peak, was the one of the most successful entryist organizations on record.\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Social Credit Party of British Columbia]], the [[British Columbia Liberal Party]] saw the shift by the joining of former Social Credit members.  As a result, the new membership saw the party shift much more towards the right in fiscal policy. Thus, entryism led to a complete takeover of the original party by former Social Credit members. That, however, is not formal entryism since former Social Credit members did not operate their own organization within the Liberal Party.\n\n===China===\nDuring the [[Warlord Era]] in China, the [[Communist Party of China]] joined the party of the [[Nationalist Party of China]] for a time (1923\u20131927), creating the [[First United Front]] against warlordism, but one of the Communists' ideas behind doing so was the possibility of eventually gaining a majority in the Nationalist Party and shaping its policies. Eventually, the situation degraded, the Nationalists expelled the Communists from their party, and the [[Chinese Civil War]] began. The war was paused for a time (1936\u20131945) to allow for a [[Second United Front]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Chinese resistance to Japanese imperial rule]]. However, the civil war resumed again and remained active until 1950, after the Communists had won.\n\n===Netherlands===\nThe [[Marxist-Leninist Party of the Netherlands]] was a fake pro-[[China]] communist party in the [[Netherlands]] set up by the Dutch secret services, the [[General Intelligence and Security Service|BVD]], to develop contacts with the Chinese government for espionage purposes. It existed from 1968 to the early 1990s{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}.\n\n=== New Zealand===\nThe country's four small communist parties, the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]] (CPNZ), [[Socialist Unity Party (New Zealand)|Socialist Unity Party]] (SUP), [[Workers Communist League (New Zealand)|Workers Communist League]] (WCL), and the [[Communist League|Socialist Action League]] (SAL), have tried to influence the [[Labour Party of New Zealand|Labour Party]], the trade unions, and various popular issues, like the [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|anti-Springbok tour protests]], [[M\u0101ori protest movement|M\u0101ori biculturalism]], and the [[New Zealand's nuclear-free zone|anti-nuclear movement]]. During the [[ANZUS]] diplomatic crisis 1984 to 1985, which resulted from New Zealand's nuclear ship ban, the pro-[[Moscow]] SUP tried to infiltrate anti-nuclear organisations, as part of a strategy of steering New Zealand's foreign policy away from its traditional ally, the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Loudon |first1=Trevor |last2=Moran |first2=Bernard |date=March 22, 2007 |title=The untold story behind New Zealand's ANZUS breakdown |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+untold+story+behind+New+Zealand's+ANZUS+breakdown.-a0173717046 |url-status=dead|publisher=[[National Observer (Australia)|National Observer]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130204091431/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+untold+story+behind+New+Zealand's+ANZUS+breakdown.-a0173717046|archivedate=2013-02-04|accessdate=26 October 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Gustafson |first=Barry|editor1-first=Alexander |editor1-last=Trapeznik |editor2-first=Aaron |editor2-last=Fox |title=Lenin's Legacy Down Under |publisher=Otago University Press|year=2004|pages=29\u201330 |chapter=Chapter 2: New Zealand in the Cold War World |isbn=1-877276-90-1}}</ref>\n\nNew Zealand's [[Christian politics in New Zealand|Christian Right]] also attempted to obtain electoral influence. During the [[1987 New Zealand general election|1987 general election]], several conservative Christian groups, including the [[Voice for Life|Society for the Protection of Unborn Children]] (SPUC), Women for Life and the [[Coalition of Concerned Citizens]], tried to infiltrate the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] by running conservative Christian individuals as candidates. The groups also attacked the Labour government's policies towards [[peace education]], [[sex education]], [[abortion]], M\u0101ori biculturalism, and the ANZUS alliance. Several CCC supporters contested the 1987 election as National candidates, including Rob Wheeler ([[Mount Albert (New Zealand)|Mount Albert]]), Andrew Stanley ([[Onehunga (New Zealand electorate)|Onehunga]]), and Howard Martin ([[Papatoetoe (New Zealand electorate)|Papatoetoe]]).

''[[United Nations Chronicle]]'', 36(2), 82-83.</ref>\n\n==Socialist entryism==\n===Trotsky's \"French Turn\"===\nThe \"[[French Turn]]\" refers to the classic form of entrism advocated by [[Leon Trotsky]] in his essays on \"The French Turn\". In June 1934, he proposed for the French Trotskyists to dissolve their Communist League and to join the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) and for the Communist League to dissolve its youth section to join more easily with revolutionary elements. The tactic was adopted in August 1934, despite some opposition, and successfully raised the group's membership to 300 activists.\n\nProponents of the tactic advocated that the Trotskyists should enter the [[social democracy|social democratic]] parties to connect with revolutionary socialist currents within them and then to steer those currents toward [[Leninism]]. However, entryism lasted briefly since the leadership of the SFIO started to expel the Trotskyists. The Trotskyists of the [[Workers Party of the United States]] also successfully used their entry into the [[Socialist Party of America]] to recruit their youth group and other members. Similar tactics were also used by Trotskyist organisations in other countries, including the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and Poland. Entryism was used to connect with and recruit leftward-moving political currents inside radical parties.\n\nSince it was used in France, Marxists have used the tactic even if they had different preconceptions of how long the period of entry would last:\n* A \"split perspective\" is sometimes employed in which the smaller party intends to remain in the larger party for a short period of time, with the intention of splitting the organisation and leaving with more members than it began with.\n* The entrist tactic can work successfully, in its own terms, over a long period. For example, it was attempted by the [[Militant tendency]] in the [[United Kingdom]], whose members worked within the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] from the 1950s onward and managed to get control in the [[Labour Party Young Socialists]] and [[Liverpool City Council]] before it was expelled in the 1980s. Many other Trotskyist groups have attempted similar feats, but few have gained the influence that the Militant tendancy attained (See Militant's [http://www.marxist.net/openturn/historic/index.html Problems of Entrism] pamphlet).\n\n===Deep entryism ''sui generis''{{anchor|Deep entrism|Deep entryism|Entrism sui generis|Entryism sui generis}}===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2014}}\nIn these types of entryism, activists engage in a long-term perspective in which they work within an organisation for decades in the hope of gaining influence and a degree of power and perhaps even control of the larger organisation.\n\nIn entryism ''[[sui generis]]'' (\"of a special type\"), Trotskyists, for example, do not openly argue for the building of a Trotskyist party. \"Deep entryism\" refers to the long duration.\n\nThe tactic is closely identified with [[Michel Pablo]] and [[Gerry Healy]], who were leaders of the [[Fourth International]] in the late 1940s and the 1950s. The \"deep entry\" tactic was developed as a way for Trotskyists to respond to the [[Cold War]]. In countries with mass social democratic or communist parties, it was as difficult to be accepted into these parties as it was Trotskyist currents as to build separate Trotskyist parties. Therefore, Trotskyists were advised to join the mass party.\n\nIn Europe, that was the approach used, for example, by [[The Club (Trotskyist)|The Club]] and later [[Socialist Action (UK)|Socialist Action]] in the Labour Party,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11893986/Jeremy-Corbyns-top-team-encouraged-street-riots.html |title=Jeremy Corbyn's top team encouraged street riots |last=Gilligan |first=Andrew |author-link=Andrew Gilligan |date=26 September 2015 |website=[[telegraph.co.uk]] |access-date=2 April 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404121300/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11893986/Jeremy-Corbyns-top-team-encouraged-street-riots.html |archivedate=4 April 2018}}</ref> and by Fourth Internationalists inside the Communist Parties. In [[France]], Trotskyist organizations, most notably the ''[[Workers' Party (France)|Parti des Travailleurs]]'' and its predecessors, have successfully entered [[trade union]]s and mainstream [[left-wing]] parties.\n\n===Open entryism===\n{{See also|Platform (European politics)}}\nSome political parties, such as the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party in Brazil]] or the [[Scottish Socialist Party]], allow political tendencies to organise within them openly. In those cases, the term \"entryism\" is not usually used. Political groups that work within a larger organisation but also maintain a \"public face\" often reject the term \"entrism\" but are sometimes still considered to be entryists by the larger organization.\n\n==Examples by country==\n\n===Australia===\nIn [[Australia]], the practice was widespread during the 1950s, when the [[Communist Party of Australia]] battled against right-wing [[Industrial Groups]] for control of Australian [[trade unions]]. The 'Groupers' subsequently formed the [[Democratic Labour Party (Australia)|Democratic Labor Party]]. Today, the practice in Australia is often known as a type of [[branch stacking]].\n\nIn recent times, [[RSPCA Australia]] has been described as being the victims of the practice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2004/s1137257.htm|title=A Blind Eye\", ABC Four Corners|date=21 June 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810215129/http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2004/s1137257.htm|archivedate=10 August 2011}}</ref> The [[National Farmers' Federation]] and [[Animals Australia]] have each been accused of infiltrating branches RSPCA Australia in an attempt to promote opposing policies concerning [[battery hens]], [[intensive pig farming]], and the [[live export]] of sheep.\n\nSince the 2000s, the [[religious right]] has practiced entryism into a number of state branches of the [[Liberal Party of Australia]], notably in New South Wales, Western Australia, Queensland and Victoria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/whos-behind-the-safe-school-videos-the-concerned-mums-political-connections-20170811-gxukuu.html|title=Who's behind the Safe School videos?

While opponents pointed to the remarkable distance, Orchard and his supporters argued that they represented \"traditional\" Conservative values and the [[economic nationalism]] of the older [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative Party]] and the Progressive Conservative Party had espoused before Mulroney, namely under [[John Diefenbaker]].\n\nOpponents of the 2003 merger between the Progressive Conservative Party and the Canadian Alliance also charged Alliance members with infiltration. It was widely speculated that most, if not all, of the approximately 25,000 Canadians who swelled the Progressive Conservative Party Party's membership before the merger vote were Alliance members, who likely voted in favour of the merger.\n\n[[Liberals for Life]], a [[pro-life]] group allied with the [[Campaign Life Coalition]], was accused of infiltrating the [[Liberal Party of Canada]] in the late 1980s and the early 1990s.\n\nMembers of [[Socialist Action (Canada)|Socialist Action]], a small Trotskyist group, play a leading role in the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] [[New Democratic Party Socialist Caucus|Socialist Caucus]], a small faction on the left wing of the [[social democracy|social democratic]] NDP, and advocate that their members join and engage with the NDP. That, however, does not fit with most definitions of entryism because of its continued existence apart and separate from the NDP, in addition to its work in it. [[Fightback (Canada)|Fightback]], a rival Trotskyist organization, carries out a more classical form of entryism in the NDP, particularly in its youth wings, and models itself after the British [[Militant tendency]], which practiced entryism into the Labour Party and, at its peak, was the one of the most successful entryist organizations on record.\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Social Credit Party of British Columbia]], the [[British Columbia Liberal Party]] saw the shift by the joining of former Social Credit members.  As a result, the new membership saw the party shift much more towards the right in fiscal policy. Thus, entryism led to a complete takeover of the original party by former Social Credit members. That, however, is not formal entryism since former Social Credit members did not operate their own organization within the Liberal Party.\n\n===China===\nDuring the [[Warlord Era]] in China, the [[Communist Party of China]] joined the party of the [[Nationalist Party of China]] for a time (1923\u20131927), creating the [[First United Front]] against warlordism, but one of the Communists' ideas behind doing so was the possibility of eventually gaining a majority in the Nationalist Party and shaping its policies. Eventually, the situation degraded, the Nationalists expelled the Communists from their party, and the [[Chinese Civil War]] began. The war was paused for a time (1936\u20131945) to allow for a [[Second United Front]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Chinese resistance to Japanese imperial rule]]. However, the civil war resumed again and remained active until 1950, after the Communists had won.\n\n===Netherlands===\nThe [[Marxist-Leninist Party of the Netherlands]] was a fake pro-[[China]] communist party in the [[Netherlands]] set up by the Dutch secret services, the [[General Intelligence and Security Service|BVD]], to develop contacts with the Chinese government for espionage purposes. It existed from 1968 to the early 1990s{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}.\n\n=== New Zealand===\nThe country's four small communist parties, the [[Communist Party of New Zealand]] (CPNZ), [[Socialist Unity Party (New Zealand)|Socialist Unity Party]] (SUP), [[Workers Communist League (New Zealand)|Workers Communist League]] (WCL), and the [[Communist League|Socialist Action League]] (SAL), have tried to influence the [[Labour Party of New Zealand|Labour Party]], the trade unions, and various popular issues, like the [[1981 South Africa rugby union tour of New Zealand|anti-Springbok tour protests]], [[M\u0101ori protest movement|M\u0101ori biculturalism]], and the [[New Zealand's nuclear-free zone|anti-nuclear movement]]. During the [[ANZUS]] diplomatic crisis 1984 to 1985, which resulted from New Zealand's nuclear ship ban, the pro-[[Moscow]] SUP tried to infiltrate anti-nuclear organisations, as part of a strategy of steering New Zealand's foreign policy away from its traditional ally, the [[United States]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Loudon |first1=Trevor |last2=Moran |first2=Bernard |date=March 22, 2007 |title=The untold story behind New Zealand's ANZUS breakdown |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+untold+story+behind+New+Zealand's+ANZUS+breakdown.-a0173717046 |url-status=dead|publisher=[[National Observer (Australia)|National Observer]] |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130204091431/http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+untold+story+behind+New+Zealand's+ANZUS+breakdown.-a0173717046|archivedate=2013-02-04|accessdate=26 October 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Gustafson |first=Barry|editor1-first=Alexander |editor1-last=Trapeznik |editor2-first=Aaron |editor2-last=Fox |title=Lenin's Legacy Down Under |publisher=Otago University Press|year=2004|pages=29\u201330 |chapter=Chapter 2: New Zealand in the Cold War World |isbn=1-877276-90-1}}</ref>\n\nNew Zealand's [[Christian politics in New Zealand|Christian Right]] also attempted to obtain electoral influence. During the [[1987 New Zealand general election|1987 general election]], several conservative Christian groups, including the [[Voice for Life|Society for the Protection of Unborn Children]] (SPUC), Women for Life and the [[Coalition of Concerned Citizens]], tried to infiltrate the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] by running conservative Christian individuals as candidates. The groups also attacked the Labour government's policies towards [[peace education]], [[sex education]], [[abortion]], M\u0101ori biculturalism, and the ANZUS alliance. Several CCC supporters contested the 1987 election as National candidates, including Rob Wheeler ([[Mount Albert (New Zealand)|Mount Albert]]), Andrew Stanley ([[Onehunga (New Zealand electorate)|Onehunga]]), and Howard Martin ([[Papatoetoe (New Zealand electorate)|Papatoetoe]]).
