In 1967, Ananda Marga headquarters came under attack by locals who were allegedly incited by Communist leaders.{{sfn|Lewis|2011|p=254}} Criticism of corruption in the Indian government by acharyas of Ananda Marga also put it in confrontation with Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]]. In 1971, Sarkar was imprisoned in India for the alleged murder of Ananda Marga members. In February 1973, Sarkar was poisoned in prison, allegedly by the jail doctor on orders from the higher echelons of government. On 1 April, after recovering his health, Sarkar began fasting in support of a demand for an inquest into his poisoning. That demand was never met. So he continued his fast for the next five years, four months, and two days, until 2 August 1978 when he was released from jail after having been acquitted of all charges.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n===Sydney Hilton bombing===\n{{Main|Sydney Hilton bombing}}\nThe Sydney Hilton Hotel bombing occurred on 13 February 1978, when a [[bomb]] exploded outside the [[Hilton Hotel]] in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].

The basis of ''Ananda Marga'' practice is covered by a set of rules called the 'Sixteen Points' that guide the practitioner on both [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and social aspects.\n\nAnandamurti expounded these principles in '''{{IAST|\u0100nanda S\u016btram}}''' a text composed in Sanskrit in 1961.\n\n=== Meditation, ''Lalita Marmika'' dance and ''Kirtan'' ===\n[[File:Yoga Meditation Pos-410px.png|thumb|left|x130px|Meditation's posture.]]\nIn the ''tantric'' tradition of ''Ananda Marga'' the spiritual aspirant ([[sadhaka]]) practices [[sadhana]].

The ''guru'' guides and leads students on the spiritual path. The aspirant [[Learning|learns]] meditation by a qualified ''acarya''. An ''acarya'' is most commonly a [[monk]] or [[nun]], but in the ''Ananda Marga'' tradition there are also \"family ''acaryas''\". In the [[initiation]] the aspirant makes a commitment to practice meditation and to live in harmony with the universal balance, and is then taught the technique itself. The aspirant is then required to keep the individual [[lesson]]s personal. In addition, he also taught ''Kapalika'' meditation to many ''[[Sannyasa|sany\u00e1sins]]''. His system of ''yoga'' can be termed as ''R\u00e1jadhir\u00e1ja Yoga'', ''Tantra Yoga'', or simply ''\u00c1nanda M\u00e1rga Yoga''. The basic ''\u00c1nanda M\u00e1rga'' meditation system is called Sahaja Yoga ('simple yoga'). The ''sahaja'' system consists of 6 meditation techniques or lessons taught one by one, on a personal basis.<ref group=note>This is the short list of six lessons: 1)First Lesson: ''Iishvara Pranidhana'' (Personal mantra and ''Ishta [[Cakra]]''), 2)Second Lesson: ''Guru Mantra'' (Personal ''[[Guru]] [[Mantra]]''), 3)Third Lesson: ''Tattva Dharana'' (Concentration on ''[[Cakra]]s' [[Tattva]]s''), 4)Fourth Lesson: ''Sadharana Pranayama'' (Basic ''[[Pranayama]]''.

Sarkar, ''Lalita Marmika'' is a devotional dance invented by [[Parvati]], the wife of [[Shiva]].</ref> This ''yogic'' dance with swaying movements, combined with a ''[[kirtan]]'' (the chanting of the universal ''mantra''), is regarded as useful in freeing the mind and preparing it for meditation.\n''Ananda Marga'' system recommends to its members the practice of collective meditation at least once a week. These meetings called ''Dharma Chakras'' (weekly held in a place called ''Dhyan Mandir'') are preceded by the singing of few ''Prabhat Samgiita'' (\"Songs of the New Dawn\" composed by the ''Ananda Marga'' founder) followed by the spiritual dance of ''Lalita Marmika'' along with the singing of and by the practice of meditation. Before meditation the ''{{audio|Samgacchadvam.OGG|Samgacchadvam}}'' ''mantra'' is chanted.

Whether it is a dead [[star]] or a living star, whether it is a [[nebula]] or a [[Milky Way]] or a [[galaxy]] \u2013 all belong to one universal family.\"</ref>\nTo this end ''Ananda Marga'' suggests a [[Pragmatism|practical]], [[Rationality|rational]], and systematic [[Lifestyle (sociology)|way of life]] for the balanced development of all human potentialities: [[Physical body|physical]], [[Energy (psychological)|psychic]] and [[Spirituality|spiritual]]. This [[system]] incorporate [[Practice (social theory)|practice]]s that range from [[hygiene]] and [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[Asanas|yoga postures]], to a [[Science|scientific]] [[Technology|technique]] of [[meditation]] based on [[morality|moral rules]] and directed to the inner fulfillment. It recognizes that a balance is needed between the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] and [[mundane]] aspects of [[existence]], and that neither one should be neglected at the [[expense]] of the other. Hence, the [[goal]] of ''Ananda Marga'' is \"[[self-realization]] and the welfare of all\".\n\n=== Spiritual philosophy ===\n[[File:Kiirtan.svg|thumb|right|''Lalita Marmika'' dance.]]\n[[File:DadasKirtan3.jpg|thumb|right|x150px|Photo ([[Italy]] July 1978) of an international group of ''Ananda Marga'' followers singing a [[Kirtan]] on the occasion of [[Shrii Shrii Anandamurti]]'s liberation]]\n[[File:CrescentMoon2.JPG|thumb|right|Kaoshiki dance.]]\n\nThe [[Spirituality|spiritual]] philosophy of ''Ananda Marga'' covers a vast range of [[Topic\u2013comment|topic]]s and can be [[Learning|learned]] from P.R. Sarkar's publications. ''Ananda Marga'' philosophy recognizes that the [[universe]] is the creation of the mental thought waves of the 'Supreme consciousness'. The following is a brief list of the essential elements of ''Ananda Marga'' Spiritual Philosophy:\n* '''Atma''' or '''[[Soul]]''' and '''[[Paramatma]]''' or the '''[[Cosmic Consciousness]]''': the Consciousness (''Purusa'') is [[Reflection (physics)|reflected]] in the unit objects forming the \"unit consciousness\" (''atma'') or [[soul]]. Particularly the reflection of the soul on the mind is called ''jiivatma'' and in that case the \"reflector-soul\" is called ''Paramatma'' (Supreme Soul).<ref group=note>''Vis\u2019aya purus\u2019a'vabha\u2019shah jiiva\u2019tma\u2019'': \"The reflection of Consciousness \u2013 ''Purusa'' \u2013 in the unit object is known as ''jiiva\u2019tma'' \u2013 \"unit soul\" \u2013 (''A\u2019nanda Sutram'', Chapter 2, Sutra 8 (2\u20138) in Avadh\u016btika \u0100nanda Mitra \u0100c\u0101ry\u0101, 1981).</ref>\n\n{{Infobox\n|title        = Yama-Niyama\n<!-- This infobox is based on the 10 principles of yogic morality (yama-niyama) \nas explained by Shrii Shrii Anandamurti in ''A Guide to Human Conduct''. -->\n\n|headerstyle  = background:#ccf;\n|labelstyle   = background:#ddf;\n\n|header1 = Yama (Restraint)\n  | label2= Ahim'sa' (Benignity)\n  | data2 = Thinking, speaking, and acting without inflicting pain or harm on another\n  | label3= Satya (Benevolence)\n  | data3 = Thinking and speaking with goodwill\n  | label4= Asteya<br/>(Honesty)\n  | data4 = Not taking or keeping what belongs to others\n  | label5= Brahmacarya (Ideation)\n  | data5 = Constant mental association with the Supreme\n  | label6= Aparigraha (Frugality)\n  | data6 = Non-indulgence in superfluous amenities\n|header7 = Niyama (Regulation)\n  | label8= Shaoca (Cleanliness)\n  | data8 = Physical and mental purity, both internal and external\n  | label9= Santos'a (Contentment)\n  | data9 = Maintaining a state of mental ease\n  | label10= Tapah<br/>(Sacrifice)\n  | data10 = Acceptance of sufferings to reach the spiritual goal\n  | label11= Sva'dhya'ya (Contemplation)\n  | data11 = Clear understanding of any spiritual subject\n  | label12= Iishvara Pran'idha'na (Dedication)\n  | data12 = Adopting the Cosmic Controller as the only ideal of life and moving with ever-accelerating speed toward that Desideratum\n\n|belowstyle = background:#ddf;\n|below = Intent is primary, but both intent and action should conform if possible.\n}}\n* '''Realms of the [[Mind]]''': according to ''Ananda Marga'' philosophy the human mind is composed of five layers called ''Kosas'':<ref group=note>The last three deeper layers are collectively called \"Causal Mind\". \"Causal\" signifies that these layers are in the most direct contact with the \"Causal Consciousness\" from which the mind has evolved and within which it exists.</ref> 1)''Kamamaya Kosa'' (\"desire layer\") or \"Crude Mind\": is the crudest layer, purified through adherence to the yogic code of morality, Yama-Niyama.<ref group=note>This ''Kosa'' controls the various autonomic activities of the body and the expression of the mental propensities, known as ''vrtti'', in [[Samskrta]].</ref> 2)''Manomaya Kosa'' (\"layer of thinking\") or \"Subtle Mind\": is the layer of thought and memory.<ref group=note>This ''Kosa'' gives experience of pleasure and pain. It is developed naturally through physical clash, and in ''Ananda Marga sadhana'' by ''pranayama'' with cosmic ideation.</ref> 3)''Atimanasa Kosa'' or \"Supramental Mind\": is the intuitive layer.<ref group=note>This ''Kosa''  gives the capacity of intuitive [[dream]]s, [[clairvoyance]], [[telepathy]] and [[creativity|creative]] insight. It is developed naturally through psychic clash, and in ''Ananda Marga sadhana'' by methods of ''pratyahara'' (withdrawal) such as ''shuddhis'' and ''Guru Puja''.</ref> 4)''Vijinanamaya Kosa'' (\"layer of the special knowledge\") or \"Subliminal Mind\": is the layer of conscience or discrimination (''viveka'') and ''[[Vairagya|vaeragya]]'' (non-attachment).<ref group=note>This ''Kosa'' is developed naturally through psychic clash, and its development is accelerated by the process of ''dharana''.</ref> 5)''Hiranyamaya Kosa'' (\"golden level\") or \"Subtle Causal Mind\": is the subtlest layer. Here the [[awareness]] of mind is very close to the direct [[experience]] of \"Supreme Consciousness\".<ref group=note>Here there is only the separation of a thin veil of ignorance. This ''Kosa'' is developed naturally through the attraction for the Great, and ''[[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]]'' accelerates this process for ''[[sadhaka]]s'' (spirituals aspirants).</ref>\n* '''[[Microvita theory]]''': ''Microvita'' is plural for ''Micro-vitum'' and literally means \"micro-life\". The concept was first introduced in 1986 through a series of lectures by P.R. Sarkar. According to this notion, microvita are entities which come within the realms both of physicality of psychic expression. They are smaller and subtler than physical [[atom]]s and [[subatomic particle]]s. So far as physicality is concerned, the position of these microvita is just between ectoplasm and electron, but they are neither ectoplasm nor electron.{{sfn|Dalal|2011|p=325}} The author predicted that they would be recognized by conventional science when it is developed much further.\n\n=== Social philosophy ===\nThe social outlook of ''Ananda Marga'' recognizes that the welfare of the [[individual]] is linked with the welfare of the [[collective]], each relying on the other for its [[existence]] and dynamism. According to this philosophy everyone has the [[Rights|right]] to [[Equal opportunity|equal opportunities]] of life and [[Social change|development]] and as such there should be no discrimination on the basis of superficial barriers such as [[race (classification of humans)|race]], nationality and religion. ''Ananda Marga'' advocates a world of [[justice]], security and [[peace]] for all.<ref>[http://anandamarga.org/social-philosophy/ Ananda Marga Social Philosophy]</ref> The Social Philosophy of ''Ananda Marga'' can be categorized under the topics: \n* '''[[Neohumanism#Neohumanism|Neohumanism]]''': in 1982, Sarkar extended his writings on the subject of [[Society|human society]] with the [[Introduction (essay)|introduction]] of his new theory of \"[[Neohumanism#Neohumanism|Neohumanism]]\".<ref>See: Sarkar, P. R., 1982.</ref> While [[humanism]] extends the recognition of equal rights to all humans, yet tends to anthropocentric worldview, neohumanism, according to Sarkar's theory, is instead the elevation of humanism to [[universalism]], thus expanding an inclusive spirit of welfare to all living beings and the created world.<ref group=note>\"When the underlying spirit of [[humanism]] is extended to everything, animate and inanimate, in this [[universe]] \u2013 I have designated this as \"Neohumanism\". This Neohumanism will elevate [[humanism]] to [[universalism]], the [[cult]] of love for all created beings of this [[universe]].\" (Sarkar, P. R., 1982).</ref>\n* '''Education''': according to the ''Ananda Marga'' system \"Education is for [[Moksha|Liberation]].\" Education means the simultaneous development in the physical, mental and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] [[realm]]s of human [[existence]]. By this, dormant human [[potentialities]] will be awakened and put to proper use. Sarkar said that real education leads to a pervasive [[Feeling|sense]] of love and [[compassion]] for all creation; in the ''Ananda Marga's'' education system, special emphasis is given to [[Morality|moral]] education and the inculcation of idealism together with a \"psycho-pedagogical approach\" and a blending of occidental extroversial science and oriental introversial philosophy.<ref group=note>\"The noblest form of social service is to educate the public and create a sense of consciousness in them. This sense of consciousness is to be instilled in every human being. This is your duty. The goal of education is to elevate the all-round standard, and especially the intellectual standard. In addition, the elevation of the moral standard is extremely necessary in the sphere of education. This moral standard is deficient today. It is lacking in the present educational system also. You are to create a new social order. Therefore, you should first acquire more and more knowledge in different spheres of life and also you are to upgrade your morality. Along with your intellectual standard, if you have morality, then everybody will respect you. Try to acquire as much knowledge as possible through our own books. Education which leads to the acquisition of knowledge plus morality makes for a peaceful society.\" (Sarkar, P. R., ''Discourses on Neo\u2013 humanist Education''.).</ref>\n* '''Culture''': In his discourse \"Talks on Prout\", given in Ranchi in July 1961, Sarkar makes a distinction between the terms \"culture\" and \"customs\". According to Sarkar \"culture... is the collective name for different expressions of life...\" but \"...all of society has the same culture. There are local variations in the mode or state of cultural expression, but the expression is universal... These local variations are called customs... Thus local modes of expression bearing local or group specialities are customs, but the expression itself is culture. Therefore it is a mistake to readjust boundaries on the basis of language and culture. Indian culture and the culture of the world are one and the same.\"{{sfn|Sarkar|1968}} The philosophy of Sarkar reinterprets the general concept of culture by inserting it into a new universalistic outlook. As described by Antonello Maggipinto:\n{{Quote|''...If the term \"culture\" is usually referred to the original meaning of this word (i.e. from the Greek \"paid\u00e9ia\" to the Latin \"humanitas\", that is to human beings capable of distinguishably mastering the arts, rhetoric, and philosophy), then Sarkar offers a new point of view, with a large universalistic explanation: \u201cthe culture of the whole human race is one, but marked by different local manifestations... it is the same, but varying in expression.\" (Sarkar, P.R., 1987)...''{{sfn|Maggipinto|2000}}}}\n* '''[[Progressive utilization theory|PROUT]]''' (\"[[Progressivism|Progressive]] Utilization [[Theory]]\"): is a [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] theory first mentioned in 1959 by P.

''Tantra' in itself is neither a religion nor an 'ism'. ''Tantra'' is a fundamental spiritual science.

Where there is no spiritual practice, where people pray to God for the fulfilment of narrow worldly desires, where people's only slogan is \"Give us this and give us that\" \u2013 only there do we find that Tantra is discouraged. So only those who do not understand Tantra, or even after understanding Tantra do not want to do any spiritual practice, oppose the cult of Tantra.\"|source=Shrii Shrii Anandamurti\u00b4s \"Tantra and its Effect on Society\", 1959.{{sfn|Anandamurti|1959}}}}\nSarkar weaves continuity with the ancient philosophy of ''Tantra'', infusing new insights in [[Psychology|human psychology]], [[social theory]] and in each individuals' [[role]]s as spiritual and \"socio-economic-cultural-political\" beings.\n''\u00c1nanda M\u00e1rga Tantra'' has a broad [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] base which allows for ways of [[Knowledge|knowing]], [[feeling]] and [[Process (science)|processing]] which go far beyond [[intellect]]uality or limited [[rationality]]. Priorities are given to the spiritual development, as Shrii Shrii \u00c1nandam\u00farti notes, \"spiritual life controls all other arenas of human life.\"<ref>[http://www.gurukul.edu Bussey, Marcus. ''Homo Tantricus: Tantra as an Episteme for Future Generations'']</ref>''Ananda Marga Tantra'' is a [[principle]], a science which if practiced will lead to the desired objective. The [[essence]] of ''Tantra'' is to awaken the latent spiritual force in the human personality and unify oneself with the Cosmic Consciousness.<ref group=note>\"It is not a religion or empty philosophy which can be confined to the realms of abstract speculation or theoretical debate. Tantra is a process of subjective transformation, which may be practiced by anyone irrespective of gender, cultural background, education, social status or intellectual evolution, as an adequate system of spiritual endeavor is the birthright of all. ''Tantra'' does not discriminate by any racial, genealogical, political, national or economic differences amongst human beings, as the later might form the basis for one human group to assert superiority over another. ''Tantra'' does, however, give recognition to individual vigor and the development of latent human potentialities, which make some people outstand in their lives. Consequently ''Tantra'' puts greater emphasis on human values than on social values\".(Coyle, G. 1985).</ref>\n\n=== ''Guru'' and Disciple ===\nAccording to ''tantric'' tradition a proper [[preceptor]] and a proper disciple are both essential for success on the path of ''Tantra''.\nP.R. Sarkar clearly explains<ref>See: Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, 1982 and 1994.</ref> that, disciples are of three categories: 1) disciples that acquire spiritual knowledge when they are in close contact with the preceptor, but as soon as they are apart from him they forget all his/her teachings, 2) disciples that learn many things from the preceptor with great hardship, but do not take proper care to preserve those instructions. They lose their hard-earned knowledge out of negligence, 3) disciples that carefully preserve deep in their minds and hearts whatever they have learned from their preceptor by wisely putting those teachings into practice. This is the best category of disciples.\n\n==References==\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{reflist|group=note|colwidth=30em}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n[https://indiankanoon.org/doc/100346371/ Abhipremananda Murder case]\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{citation |title=Tantra and its Effect on Society |last=Anandamurti |first=Shrii Shrii |location=Bhagalpur |publisher= Ananda Marga Pubs |year=1959}}\n* {{citation |last=Dalal |first=Roshen |title=The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNmfdAKFpkQC&pg=PA21 |date=23 November 2011 |publisher=Penguin Books India |isbn=978-0-14-341517-6 |ref=harv}}\n* {{citation |title=Travel with the Mystic Master |last=Dharmavedananda |first=\u00c1c. |year=1999 |location=Singapore |publisher=Ananda Marga Publications |ISBN=981-04-0864-1}}\n* {{citation|title=Political Parties of Asia and the Pacific |last= Fukui |first= Haruhiro |year= 1985 | publisher=Greenwood Press|page=357 |isbn= 0-313-21350-X|ref=harv}}\n* {{citation |last=Lewis|first=James R.|title=Violence and New Religious Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CqS3ILwnmsC&pg=PA250 |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973563-1}}\n* {{citation |last = Maggipinto |first = Antonello |contribution = Multilanguage Acquisition, New Technologies, Education and Global Citizenship |editor-last = American Association for Italian Studies |title = Academic journal article from Italian Culture |volume = 18-2 |page =147 |pages = |publisher = AAIS |place = New York |year = 2000 |contribution-url =https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-83245337/multilanguage-acquisition-new-technologies-education}}\n* {{citation |title=PROUT in a Nutshell Part 15 |last=Sarkar |first=Prabhat Ranjan |publisher=Ananda Marga Publications |year= 1968 |ISBN= }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|title=Teaching asanas: An Ananda Marga manual for teacher |author=Ananda Marga Aa.

In February 1973, Sarkar was poisoned in prison, allegedly by the jail doctor on orders from the higher echelons of government.

The concept was first introduced in 1986 through a series of lectures by P.R. Sarkar. According to this notion, microvita are entities which come within the realms both of physicality of psychic expression. They are smaller and subtler than physical [[atom]]s and [[subatomic particle]]s.

R., 1982.</ref> While [[humanism]] extends the recognition of equal rights to all humans, yet tends to anthropocentric worldview, neohumanism, according to Sarkar's theory, is instead the elevation of humanism to [[universalism]], thus expanding an inclusive spirit of welfare to all living beings and the created world.<ref group=note>\"When the underlying spirit of [[humanism]] is extended to everything, animate and inanimate, in this [[universe]] \u2013 I have designated this as \"Neohumanism\". This Neohumanism will elevate [[humanism]] to [[universalism]], the [[cult]] of love for all created beings of this [[universe]].\" (Sarkar, P. R., 1982).</ref>\n* '''Education''': according to the ''Ananda Marga'' system \"Education is for [[Moksha|Liberation]].\" Education means the simultaneous development in the physical, mental and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] [[realm]]s of human [[existence]]. By this, dormant human [[potentialities]] will be awakened and put to proper use. Sarkar said that real education leads to a pervasive [[Feeling|sense]] of love and [[compassion]] for all creation; in the ''Ananda Marga's'' education system, special emphasis is given to [[Morality|moral]] education and the inculcation of idealism together with a \"psycho-pedagogical approach\" and a blending of occidental extroversial science and oriental introversial philosophy.<ref group=note>\"The noblest form of social service is to educate the public and create a sense of consciousness in them. This sense of consciousness is to be instilled in every human being. This is your duty. The goal of education is to elevate the all-round standard, and especially the intellectual standard. In addition, the elevation of the moral standard is extremely necessary in the sphere of education. This moral standard is deficient today. It is lacking in the present educational system also. You are to create a new social order. Therefore, you should first acquire more and more knowledge in different spheres of life and also you are to upgrade your morality. Along with your intellectual standard, if you have morality, then everybody will respect you. Try to acquire as much knowledge as possible through our own books. Education which leads to the acquisition of knowledge plus morality makes for a peaceful society.\" (Sarkar, P. R., ''Discourses on Neo\u2013 humanist Education''.).</ref>\n* '''Culture''': In his discourse \"Talks on Prout\", given in Ranchi in July 1961, Sarkar makes a distinction between the terms \"culture\" and \"customs\". According to Sarkar \"culture... is the collective name for different expressions of life...\" but \"...all of society has the same culture. There are local variations in the mode or state of cultural expression, but the expression is universal... These local variations are called customs... Thus local modes of expression bearing local or group specialities are customs, but the expression itself is culture. Therefore it is a mistake to readjust boundaries on the basis of language and culture. Indian culture and the culture of the world are one and the same.\"{{sfn|Sarkar|1968}} The philosophy of Sarkar reinterprets the general concept of culture by inserting it into a new universalistic outlook. As described by Antonello Maggipinto:\n{{Quote|''...If the term \"culture\" is usually referred to the original meaning of this word (i.e. from the Greek \"paid\u00e9ia\" to the Latin \"humanitas\", that is to human beings capable of distinguishably mastering the arts, rhetoric, and philosophy), then Sarkar offers a new point of view, with a large universalistic explanation: \u201cthe culture of the whole human race is one, but marked by different local manifestations... it is the same, but varying in expression.\" (Sarkar, P.R., 1987)...''{{sfn|Maggipinto|2000}}}}\n* '''[[Progressive utilization theory|PROUT]]''' (\"[[Progressivism|Progressive]] Utilization [[Theory]]\"): is a [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] theory first mentioned in 1959 by P.

''Homo Tantricus: Tantra as an Episteme for Future Generations'']</ref>''Ananda Marga Tantra'' is a [[principle]], a science which if practiced will lead to the desired objective. The [[essence]] of ''Tantra'' is to awaken the latent spiritual force in the human personality and unify oneself with the Cosmic Consciousness.<ref group=note>\"It is not a religion or empty philosophy which can be confined to the realms of abstract speculation or theoretical debate. Tantra is a process of subjective transformation, which may be practiced by anyone irrespective of gender, cultural background, education, social status or intellectual evolution, as an adequate system of spiritual endeavor is the birthright of all. ''Tantra'' does not discriminate by any racial, genealogical, political, national or economic differences amongst human beings, as the later might form the basis for one human group to assert superiority over another. ''Tantra'' does, however, give recognition to individual vigor and the development of latent human potentialities, which make some people outstand in their lives. Consequently ''Tantra'' puts greater emphasis on human values than on social values\".(Coyle, G. 1985).</ref>\n\n=== ''Guru'' and Disciple ===\nAccording to ''tantric'' tradition a proper [[preceptor]] and a proper disciple are both essential for success on the path of ''Tantra''.\nP.R. Sarkar clearly explains<ref>See: Shrii Shrii Anandamurti, 1982 and 1994.</ref> that, disciples are of three categories: 1) disciples that acquire spiritual knowledge when they are in close contact with the preceptor, but as soon as they are apart from him they forget all his/her teachings, 2) disciples that learn many things from the preceptor with great hardship, but do not take proper care to preserve those instructions. They lose their hard-earned knowledge out of negligence, 3) disciples that carefully preserve deep in their minds and hearts whatever they have learned from their preceptor by wisely putting those teachings into practice. This is the best category of disciples.\n\n==References==\n\n=== Footnotes ===\n{{reflist|group=note|colwidth=30em}}\n\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n[https://indiankanoon.org/doc/100346371/ Abhipremananda Murder case]\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{citation |title=Tantra and its Effect on Society |last=Anandamurti |first=Shrii Shrii |location=Bhagalpur |publisher= Ananda Marga Pubs |year=1959}}\n* {{citation |last=Dalal |first=Roshen |title=The Religions of India: A Concise Guide to Nine Major Faiths |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNmfdAKFpkQC&pg=PA21 |date=23 November 2011 |publisher=Penguin Books India |isbn=978-0-14-341517-6 |ref=harv}}\n* {{citation |title=Travel with the Mystic Master |last=Dharmavedananda |first=\u00c1c. |year=1999 |location=Singapore |publisher=Ananda Marga Publications |ISBN=981-04-0864-1}}\n* {{citation|title=Political Parties of Asia and the Pacific |last= Fukui |first= Haruhiro |year= 1985 | publisher=Greenwood Press|page=357 |isbn= 0-313-21350-X|ref=harv}}\n* {{citation |last=Lewis|first=James R.|title=Violence and New Religious Movements|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5CqS3ILwnmsC&pg=PA250 |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-973563-1}}\n* {{citation |last = Maggipinto |first = Antonello |contribution = Multilanguage Acquisition, New Technologies, Education and Global Citizenship |editor-last = American Association for Italian Studies |title = Academic journal article from Italian Culture |volume = 18-2 |page =147 |pages = |publisher = AAIS |place = New York |year = 2000 |contribution-url =https://www.questia.com/library/1G1-83245337/multilanguage-acquisition-new-technologies-education}}\n* {{citation |title=PROUT in a Nutshell Part 15 |last=Sarkar |first=Prabhat Ranjan |publisher=Ananda Marga Publications |year= 1968 |ISBN= }}\n{{refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n* {{cite book|title=Teaching asanas: An Ananda Marga manual for teacher |author=Ananda Marga Aa.

Multiple incomplete but well-preserved specimens were discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in the 1970s, and in 1979 the genus and species '''''Segnosaurus galbinensis''''' were named. The generic name ''Segnosaurus'' means \"slow lizard\" and the specific name ''galbinensis'' refers to the [[Galbin]] region. The known material of this dinosaur includes the lower jaw, neck and tail vertebrae, the pelvis, shoulder girdle, and limb bones. Parts of the specimens have gone missing or become damaged since they were collected.\n\n''Segnosaurus'' was a large-bodied [[therizinosaur]] that is estimated to have been about {{convert|6\u20137|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and to have weighed about {{convert|1.3|MT|ST|abbr=on}}. It would have been bipedal, with the trunk of its body tilted upwards. The head was small with a beak at the tip of the jaws, and the neck was long and slender. The lower jaw was down-turned at the front and the teeth were distinct in having additional {{Dinogloss|denticles}} as well as third cutting edges in some of the hindmost teeth. The forelimbs were robust and had three fingers which bore large claws, and the feet had four toes supporting the foot\u2014apart from therizinosaurs, all [[theropods]] had three-toed feet. The front of the pelvis was adapted to support the enlarged belly. The [[pubic bone]] was turned backwards, a feature that is only seen in birds and the dinosaurs most closely related to them.\n\nThe affinities of ''Segnosaurus'' were originally obscure and it received its own theropod family, Segnosauridae, and later when related genera were identified, an [[infraorder]], Segnosauria. Alternative classification schemes were proposed until more complete relatives were described in the 1990s, which confirmed them as theropods. The new fossils also showed Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the earlier named family Therizinosauridae. ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives are thought to have been slow-moving animals that, as indicated by their unusual features, were mainly herbivorous, whereas most other theropod groups were carnivorous. Therizinosaurs probably used their long forelimbs, long necks, and beaks when [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]], and large guts for processing food. ''Segnosaurus'' is known from the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]], where it lived alongside the fellow therizinosaurs ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' and ''[[Enigmosaurus]]''; these related genera were probably [[niche partitioned]].\n\n==History of discovery==\n[[File:Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|[[Cretaceous]]-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia; ''Segnosaurus'' was found by areas C and D (right, Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities).]]\n\nIn 1973, a joint [[Soviet]]\u2013Mongolian expedition investigating the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]] at the Amtgay locality in the [[Gobi Desert]] of southeastern Mongolia discovered fossils that included the partial skeleton of an unknown [[dinosaur]]. Through 1974 and 1975, more remains were uncovered at the Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities; though the skeletons were incomplete, the recovered bones were well-preserved. Other localities listed in the literature include Bayshin-Tsav and Urilbe-Khuduk. These fossils were scientifically [[species description|described]] in 1979 by the paleontologist [[Altangerel Perle]], who named the new [[genus]] and species ''Segnosaurus galbiensis''. The generic name is derived from the Latin word ''segnis'' (\"slow\") and the [[Ancient Greek]] ''sauros'' (\"lizard\").

The nearly complete right hemimandible (half of the mandible) is {{convert|379|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from front to back, {{convert|55.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the highest point, and {{convert|24.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the lowest. The {{Dinogloss|dentary bone}}, the tooth-bearing bone forming most of the mandible's front part, was complex in shape compared to those of early therizinosaurs. The tooth-bearing part was almost rectangular and sloped downwards in side view with a pronounced arc throughout the upper length of the front end\u2014more extreme than what is known in other therizinosaurs. The front-most part of the dentary was strongly deflected downwards at about a 30 degree angle, a unique feature for this genus. When each hemimandible is articulated with the other, they form a broadly U-shaped, toothless mandibular symphysis that projects upwards towards the front as in ''Erlikosaurus'' and ''[[Neimongosaurus]]''. The expansive, toothless front region of the dentary spans {{convert|25.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the right hemimandible of the holotype. Proportionally, the toothless part of the dentary is 20% of its tooth row, which is {{convert|150.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. By comparison, the toothless region of ''Erlikosaurus'' was about 12% of the tooth row's length and was almost absent in ''Jianchangosaurus''. The height of the dentary diminished towards the hindmost extend of the tooth row, whereafter it sharply fanned out to contact the {{Dinogloss|surangular}} bone behind it; by contrast, the hind part of the dentary in ''Erlikosaurus'' gradually approached the surungular in a gentle arc.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Zanno|first1=L.

The teeth were restricted to the front two thirds of the dentary, which bore 24 {{Dinogloss|alveoli}} (tooth sockets) in a manner similar to ''Jianchangosaurus'' but different from ''Erlikosaurus'', in which nearly the entire dentary was toothed, bearing 31 alveoli. The tooth row of ''Segnosaurus'' was inset and demarcated by a shelf on the outer side as it was in all derived (or \"advanced\") therizinosaurs. Unlike in other related taxa, the shelf was restricted to the hind part of the dentary and the raised rim that defined it was not as pronounced. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique in having a low ridge rising between the fifth and fourteenth alveoli that divided the dentary into two almost-equally sized front and hind parts. Just above this ridge, the dentary was pierced by a row of {{Dinogloss|foramina}} as in ''Jianchangosaurus'' and ''[[Alxasaurus]]'', which became less regular by the region around the mandibular symphysis, where the two halves of the mandible met at the front. This row was instead directly in line with and on the side of the ridge in ''Erlikosaurus''. The {{Dinogloss|Meckelian groove}} that ran along the inner side of the mandible, was placed further down than in ''Erlikosaurus'' and had a consistent depth until the thirteenth tooth position, whereafter it widened. The lower jaw elements behind the dentary (the {{Dinogloss|splenial}}, surangular, {{Dinogloss|angular}}, and {{Dinogloss|prearticular}} bones) were distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being gracile and linear, and contributing to the hind part of the hemimandible being elongate and almost rectangular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/> The surangular was long and sword-shaped, the angular was wing-like in shape, the prearticular was narrow and curved, and the splenial was thin and triangular in outline. The external mandibular fenestra, an opening at the outer side of the mandible, was larger than that of ''Erlikosaurus'' because the surangular was shallow from top to bottom.<ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\n[[File:Mesial dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Frontmost dentary teeth, showing folded {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (lf) and accessory {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (ad)]]\n''Segnosaurus'' had the fewest teeth in the dentary; 24 in each half determined from the number of sockets, as well as the largest teeth known among therizinosaurs. The dentary teeth were foliodont (leaf-shaped) and bore enlarged, relatively tall, sideways compressed crowns with a slight recurvature at the upper margin of the tips. By comparison, the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were smaller, symmetrical, and simpler. The bases of the crowns increased slightly in size hindwards across the tooth row, which reflected a decrease in sideways compression. The front surfaces of the crowns and outward-facing sides were convex while the inward-facing sides were concave. A thickened ridge ran along the longitude of the inward-facing side near the upper half of the crown, which was flanked by weak grooves near the front and back edges of the teeth, reaching almost to the cervix (neck; the transition between the crown and root) of the teeth. In general, the 18 front-most teeth were relatively homodont (of the same type), though the crown of the second tooth was relatively shorter and more tapered; this may also have been true for the first tooth, but it was not preserved. The teeth further back in the row also decreased in relative height hindwards. By comparison, the front four to five dentary teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were conidont (cone-shaped) with a gradual transition to foliodont teeth.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/><ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\nThe dentary teeth were tightly packed, but not pressed closely together, with the tooth crowns approaching each other at mid-length. The {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (serrations) were large and bulbous, diminishing slightly in size towards the tooth tips, with about 5\u20136 denticles per {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The front {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (cutting edges) folded upwards to overlap the inner surface of the crowns on the third to eighteenth teeth, but such folds were absent on the second and probably first crowns. The denticles were roughly perpendicular with the tip of the tooth crowns, but parallel to the crown height on the front side fold and triangular facet on the hind side. There was a series of accessory denticles (in addition to those on the carinae) that projected from the front surfaces of the carinal folds, which made the front edges of the crowns more broadly roughened. The carinae of the hind edges were also very modified, and bifurcated (split in two) near the cervix, where they formed a flattened triangular, raised facet, which projected from the tooth crown and contacted or approached the folded carinae on the front edge of the crowns behind them (this arrangement is present in teeth 2\u201312). Such split carinae are known from other [[tetanuran]] theropods, where they are considered abnormalities caused by trauma, aberrant [[tooth replacement]], or genetic factors. Though the condition in ''Segnosaurus'' was similar, it was uniformly expressed across the teeth of both dentaries, and does not appear to have been an abnormality, but served to roughen the contacts between tooth bases.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nThe 22nd and 23rd dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'' were significantly smaller than the rest, almost conidont, and had an additional third carina with denticles on their inner sides. Most of the other hindmost tooth crowns are damaged so their complete features are unknown. The additional carina on tooth 23 appears to have been fully denticulated while the denticles were restricted to the basal side of the crown in tooth 22. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique among all known theropods in possessing triple carinae. The 14th alveolus on the right dentary of the holotype is walled over by seemingly [[pathological]] (due to injury or disease) bone growth but the teeth in that part of the dentary are damaged so it is not possible to determine how the teeth were affected by this. The teeth in the same area of the left dentary bear triple carinae, though this dentary has no external indications of pathology that could have led to this condition, thus it cannot be concluded nor ruled out that this feature is the result of a pathology. ''Segnosaurus'' [[Polyphyodont|replaced its teeth]] in waves running from back to front of the jaws, that encompassed two to three erupting crowns. Some of the fully erupted teeth have wear on the carinae of their hind sides, unlike what is seen in other therizinosaurs. The texture of the {{Dinogloss|enamel}} appears to have been broadly irregular and the roots of the teeth were almost circular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\n===Postcranial skeleton===\n[[File:Segno.jpg|thumb|[[paleoart|Life restoration]]]]\n\nThe {{Dinogloss|scapula}} (shoulder blade) of ''Segnosaurus'' was straight and flat at the upper end, and was fused to the coracoid bone, forming the scapulocoracoid. The coracoid was very wide, rectangular in outline, and thick at the middle. The massive humerus was {{convert|560|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length; it had an almost-cylindrical shaft and well-defined condyles for articulation with the radius and ulna of the lower arm. The deltopectoral crest, where the [[deltoid muscle]] was attached to the upper front of the humerus, was well-developed.<ref name=Perle1979/> The humerus was distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being straight rather than [[sigmoid shaped]] and not expanded or deflected forwards at its upper end. The humerus was also not expanded at the middle, and the [[entepicondyle]] was not well-developed. The lack of these features was more similar to [[ornithomimosaurs]] and [[troodontids]] than to other therizinosaurs.<ref name=Zanno2010/> The radius was also massive\u2014about 60 percent of the humerus\u2014with a straight shaft. The ulna was thicker than the radius and slightly longer\u2014about 70 percent of the humerus\u2014and slightly twisted along its middle axis. The hand was [[tridactyl]] (three-fingered). The {{Dinogloss|phalanx bones}} of the fingers were flattened from top to bottom and the articular depressions on their sides were not very developed. The first phalanx of the first finger was long and thin while the first and second phalanxes of the second finger were short. The ungual of the third finger was somewhat longer than the second phalanx and quite flat from top to bottom, which may have been a unique feature of ''Segnosaurus''. This ungual was sharpy curved, very pointed, and compressed from side to side. The lower tubercle, where the flexor tendons attached to the ungual, was thick and robust.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /><ref name=\"Dinosauria2\">{{cite book| last1 = Clark | first1 = J.

The pelvis was shortened at the front, a feature found among bird-like theropods but uncommon among theropods as a whole.<ref name=Perle1979/> The pubic bone was directed backwards and down in parallel with the ischium; this backwards orientation of the pubic bone is known as the {{Dinogloss|opisthopubic}} condition.

Some features of the pelvis were similar to that of ''[[Nothronychus]]'', particularly the ischia, but it is uncertain whether these similarities were due to them having a common ancestor to the exclusion of other derived therizinosaurids, or because they retained basal features since lost in other relatives. The ischium of ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from that of ''Nothronychus'' in that it had an almost-rectangular obturator process and an almost-circular obturator foramen. The pelvis was distinct from that of ''[[Enigmosaurus]]'' by its deep obturator process not fusing with its counterpart at the middle, by its unfused pubic boot, and because the lower part of the pubic shaft was wide from front to back. ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from both ''Nothronychus'' and ''Enigmosaurus'' in having a deep {{Dinogloss|brevis fossa}} (a groove where the [[caudofemoralis brevis muscle]] of the tail originated) and because its pubic boot lacked a well developed hindwards projection.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\nThe femur was straight with an oval cross-section and was {{convert|840|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The head of the femur was placed on a long \"neck\" and the lower condyles were well-defined. The tibia was straight, slightly shorter than the femur, and twisted along its axis. The fibula was long and narrowed towards its lower end. The metatarsus of the foot was short, massive, and consisted of five bones\u2014four of which functioned as support elements and terminated in four toes. Functionally tetradactyl (four-toed) feet were unique to derived therizinosaurs; basal therizinosaurs and all other theropods had tridactyl feet in which the first toe was short and did not reach the ground. Externally, the metatarsus was similar to, though proportionally larger than, those of [[prosauropods]], an early [[evolutionary grade]] of [[sauropodomorphs]]. The epiphyses on the upper metatarsals were hypertrophied (enlarged), a distinctive feature of the genus. The first toe was shorter than the others but was of equal functional importance; the second and third toes were equally long while the fourth was thinnest. The toe ungual was robust, sharply curved, flat at the side, and more pointed than those of prosauropods. The lower tubercle where the flexor ligaments attached was robust. While the lack of strong compression of the toe unguals distinguished ''Segnosaurus'' from ''Erlikosaurus'' from the same formation, the lack of compression was common among therizinosaurs and therefore not unique to ''Segnosaurus''.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> The cervical vertebrae were platycoelous and had large, massive centra (bodies) and low neural arches. The sacrum consisted of six, firmly fused  vertebrae; the centra of these vertebrae were broadened and relatively elongated, and each centrum was slightly longer than their width. The neural spines here were not very long but surpassed the level of the ilia. The caudal (tail) vertebrae closest to the body were massive, high, and somewhat compressed from side to side. The neural arch was low with a small neural canal. The caudal vertebrae closer to the tip of the tail were platycoelous and had short, massive centra. The transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae and the ribs were robust and elongated.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Erlikosaurus skull and foot.jpg|thumb|Skull and foot bones of ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'', which together with ''Segnosaurus'' (both from Mongolia) became the basis of the new [[infraorder]] Segnosauria; this group is now a [[junior synonym]] of [[Therizinosauria]].]]\n\n''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives, which are now recognized as therizinosaurs (\"scythe reptiles\"), were long considered an enigmatic group.

He tentatively classified Segnosauridae as theropods, traditionally thought of as the \"meat-eating\" dinosaurs, pointing to similarities in the mandible and its front teeth. Using features of their humeri and hand claws, he distinguished Segnosauridae from the theropod families [[Deinocheiridae]] and Therizinosauridae, which were then only known from the genera ''[[Deinocheirus]]'' and ''Therizinosaurus'', respectively, mainly represented by large forelimbs found in Mongolia.<ref name=Perle1979/> Later in 1979, Barsbold and Perle found the pelvic features of segnosaurids and dromaeosaurids were so different from those of \"true\" theropods that they should be separated into three taxa of the same rank, possibly at the level of [[infraorder]] within [[Saurischia]], one of the two main divisions of dinosaurs\u2014the other being [[Ornithischia]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" />\n\nIn 1980, Barsbold and Perle named the new theropod infraorder Segnosauria, containing only Segnosauridae. In the same article, they named the new genus ''Erlikosaurus'' (known from a well-preserved skull and partial skeleton)\u2014which they tentatively considered a segnosaurid\u2014and reported a partial pelvis of an undetermined segnosaurian, both from the same formation as ''Segnosaurus''. The specimens provided relatively complete data on this group; they were united by their opisthopubic pelvis, slender mandible, and the toothless front of their jaws. Barsbold and Perle stated that, though some of their features resembled those of ornithischians and sauropods, these similarities were superficial and distinct when examined in detail. While they were essentially different from other theropods\u2014perhaps due to diverging from them relatively early\u2014and warranted a new infraorder, they did show similarities with the theropods. Because the ''Erlikosaurus'' specimen lacked a pelvis, the authors were unsure that the undetermined segnosaurian could belong to the same genus, in which case they would consider it part of a separate family.<ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> Though ''Erlikosaurus'' was difficult to compare directly to ''Segnosaurus'' because its remains were incomplete, Perle stated in 1981 there was no justification for separating it into another family.<ref name=Perle1981>{{cite journal | last=Perle | first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1981 |title=Noviy segnozavrid iz verchnego mela Mongolii |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |volume=15 |pages=50\u201359|language=Russian|trans-title=New Segnosauridae from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia|translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

While ''Alxasaurus'' was similar in some respects to prosauropods, the detailed morphology of its limbs linked it to ''Therizinosaurus'' and segnosaurs. Because its fore and hindlimbs were preserved, ''Alxasaurus'' showed that Perle's assignment of segnosaurian hindlimbs to ''Therizinosaurus'' was probably correct. Russell and Dong therefore proposed that Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the older name Therizinosauridae, and that ''Alxasaurus'' was the most completely known representative so far. They also named the new higher taxonomic rank [[Therizinosauroidea]] to contain ''Alxasaurus'' and Therizinosauridae because the new genus was somewhat different from its relatives. They concluded that therizinosaurs were tetanuran theropods, most closely related to ornithomimids, troodontids, and oviraptorids, which they placed together in the group [[Oviraptorosauria]] (because they found [[Maniraptora]]\u2014the conventional grouping of these\u2014invalid, and the higher level taxonomy of theropods was in flux).<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\">{{cite journal |last1=Russell |first1=D.

Like ornithischians, they could therefore crop, manipulate, and chew plants in a sophisticated manner.

He found this consistent with Rozhdestvensky's suggestion that therizinosaurs may have fed on [[social insects]].<ref name=\"Nessov\" /> In a 2006 conference abstract, Sara Burch presented the inferred range of motion in the arms of the therizinosaur ''Neimongosaurus'' and concluded the overall motion at the {{Dinogloss|glenoid}}-humeral joint at the shoulder was roughly circular, and directed sideways and slightly downwards, which diverged from the more oval, backwards-and-downwards-directed ranges of other theropods.

These included small, densely packed, coarse serrations; lanceolate (lance-shaped) teeth with a low replacement rate; a beak at the front of the jaws; an inset tooth row that suggests fleshy cheeks; an elongated neck; a small skull; a very large gut capacity as indicated by the rib circumference at the trunk and the outwards flaring processes of the ilia; and the loss of [[cursorial]] (related to running) adaptations in the hind limbs, including development of functionally tetradactyl feet. Zanno and colleagues found the clades at the base of Maniraptora\u2014Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, and Oviraptorosauria\u2014had either direct or morphological evidence for herbivory, which would mean either this diet evolved independently multiple times in coelurosaurian theropods or that the primitive condition of the group was at least facultative herbivory with carnivory only emerging in more derived maniraptorans.<ref name=\"Zanno2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Zanno |first1=L.

In genera where both neck and forelimb elements are preserved, however, the necks were equal in length or longer than the forelimbs, so pulling vegetation would only make sense if lower parts of long branches were pulled down to access out-of-reach parts of trees.<ref name=\"Claws\"/>\n\n[[File:Dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Hindmost dentary teeth showing the third cutting edge (lc), unique to ''Segnosaurus'' among theropods]]\nZanno and colleagues stated in 2016 that therizinosaurs were generally accepted to fall within the spectrum of [[omnivory]] and herbivory, with a trend towards intensified herbivory. While various anatomical features have been used to support this idea, tooth morphology had been considered relatively simplistic and with few unique specializations compared to other herbivorous dinosaurs. The few modifications include the increased symmetry in the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' and the enlargement of denticles in ''Segnosaurus''. Zanno and collegaues identified novel, complex features in the dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'', including the presence of additional carinae and folded carinae with denticulated front edges, which indicate ''Segnosaurus'' had a higher degree of oral food processing than other therizinosaurs. These traits together created a roughened, shredding surface near the base of the tooth crowns that was unique to ''Segnosaurus'' and suggest it consumed unique food resources or used highly specialized feeding strategies. Because multiple geological formations show evidence of [[sympatric]] therizinosaur species\u2014related species that lived in the same area at the same time\u2014it is possible [[niche partitioning]] between them could have played a role in the group's evolutionary success. This is supported by ''Segnosaurus'' with its highly specialized dentition being a contemporary of ''Erlikosaurus'' with its relatively indistinct teeth, indicating their partitioning in food acquisition, processing, or resources. This conclusion is also strengthened by the large difference in estimated body masses of sympatric therizinosaurs in the Bayan Shireh Formation, which was up to 500%.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nIn a 2017 study of niche partitioning in therizinosaurs through digital simulations, Lautenschlager found the dentaries of ''Segnosaurus'' experienced one of the lowest stress magnitudes during extrinsic feeding scenarios. ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' were aided by the down-turned tip of the lower jaws and symphyseal regions, and probably also by beaks, which are known to mitigate stress and strain. By contrast, the straighter and more elongated dentaries of basal therizinosaurs\u2014typical of their coelurosaurian ancestors\u2014had the highest magnitudes of stress and strain. A downwards-pulling motion of the head while gripping vegetation was more likely than a sideways or upwards movement, though such behavior would be more likely in ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' with their stress-mitigating jaws. Difference in relative bite force between the sympatric ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' show the former would have been able to feed on tougher vegetation while the overall robustness of the latter suggests greater flexibility in its manner of feeding, because stress levels stayed low across feeding simulations. Lautenschlager agreed the two taxa were adapted to different modes of feeding and food selection; ''Segnosaurus'' was more adapted to using its dentition to procure or process food while ''Erlikosaurus'' mostly used its beak for cropping and its neck musculature while foraging. The difference in size between ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' (the former of which is estimated to have weighed more than the latter) indicates these effects were increased and that there were further mechanisms partitioning their resources, such as different heights. Because other therizinosaur taxa were more divided in time and space, other factors than competition within their group may also have contributed to their variation, such as adaptations to different flora and competition with other kinds of herbivores.<ref name=\"Niche\">{{cite journal |last1=Lautenschlager |first1=S. |title=Functional niche partitioning in Therizinosauria provides new insights into the evolution of theropod herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2017 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=375\u2013387 |doi=10.1111/pala.12289|url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/39402933/FUNCTIONAL_NICHE_PARTITIONING_IN_THERIZINOSAURIA_REVISED2.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Loredana Macaluso and colleagues pointed out that the hips of therizinosaurs were peculiar because the shaft of the pubic bone was rotated backwards whereas the pubic boot was strongly projected forwards.

Multiple incomplete but well-preserved specimens were discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in the 1970s, and in 1979 the genus and species '''''Segnosaurus galbinensis''''' were named. The generic name ''Segnosaurus'' means \"slow lizard\" and the specific name ''galbinensis'' refers to the [[Galbin]] region. The known material of this dinosaur includes the lower jaw, neck and tail vertebrae, the pelvis, shoulder girdle, and limb bones. Parts of the specimens have gone missing or become damaged since they were collected.\n\n''Segnosaurus'' was a large-bodied [[therizinosaur]] that is estimated to have been about {{convert|6\u20137|m|ft|abbr=on}} long and to have weighed about {{convert|1.3|MT|ST|abbr=on}}. It would have been bipedal, with the trunk of its body tilted upwards. The head was small with a beak at the tip of the jaws, and the neck was long and slender. The lower jaw was down-turned at the front and the teeth were distinct in having additional {{Dinogloss|denticles}} as well as third cutting edges in some of the hindmost teeth. The forelimbs were robust and had three fingers which bore large claws, and the feet had four toes supporting the foot\u2014apart from therizinosaurs, all [[theropods]] had three-toed feet. The front of the pelvis was adapted to support the enlarged belly. The [[pubic bone]] was turned backwards, a feature that is only seen in birds and the dinosaurs most closely related to them.\n\nThe affinities of ''Segnosaurus'' were originally obscure and it received its own theropod family, Segnosauridae, and later when related genera were identified, an [[infraorder]], Segnosauria. Alternative classification schemes were proposed until more complete relatives were described in the 1990s, which confirmed them as theropods. The new fossils also showed Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the earlier named family Therizinosauridae. ''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives are thought to have been slow-moving animals that, as indicated by their unusual features, were mainly herbivorous, whereas most other theropod groups were carnivorous. Therizinosaurs probably used their long forelimbs, long necks, and beaks when [[Browsing (herbivory)|browsing]], and large guts for processing food. ''Segnosaurus'' is known from the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]], where it lived alongside the fellow therizinosaurs ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'' and ''[[Enigmosaurus]]''; these related genera were probably [[niche partitioned]].\n\n==History of discovery==\n[[File:Cretaceous-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia.PNG|thumb|left|upright=1.4|[[Cretaceous]]-aged dinosaur fossil localities of Mongolia; ''Segnosaurus'' was found by areas C and D (right, Amtgay and Khara-Khutul localities).]]\n\nIn 1973, a joint [[Soviet]]\u2013Mongolian expedition investigating the [[Bayan Shireh Formation]] at the Amtgay locality in the [[Gobi Desert]] of southeastern Mongolia discovered fossils that included the partial skeleton of an unknown [[dinosaur]].

Other localities listed in the literature include Bayshin-Tsav and Urilbe-Khuduk. These fossils were scientifically [[species description|described]] in 1979 by the paleontologist [[Altangerel Perle]], who named the new [[genus]] and species ''Segnosaurus galbiensis''. The generic name is derived from the Latin word ''segnis'' (\"slow\") and the [[Ancient Greek]] ''sauros'' (\"lizard\").

More bones bearing the specimen number IGM 100/82 were located but were not mentioned in Perle's description, while the whereabouts of some paratype elements was unknown.<ref name=\"barsbold1983\">{{Cite journal |last=Barsbold |first=R. |year=1983 |title=Khishchnye dinosavry mela Mongoliy|trans-title=Carnivorous dinosaurs from the Cretaceous of Mongolia |url=https://paleoglot.org/files/Barsbold_83.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Transactions of the Joint Soviet-Mongolian Paleontological Expedition |volume=19 |pages=51\u201352, 76, 108\u2013109 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313031010/http://paleoglot.org/files/barsbold_83.pdf |archive-date=2016-03-13 |access-date=2019-09-21|language=Russian|translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

The nearly complete right hemimandible (half of the mandible) is {{convert|379|mm|in|abbr=on}} long from front to back, {{convert|55.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the highest point, and {{convert|24.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} at the lowest. The {{Dinogloss|dentary bone}}, the tooth-bearing bone forming most of the mandible's front part, was complex in shape compared to those of early therizinosaurs. The tooth-bearing part was almost rectangular and sloped downwards in side view with a pronounced arc throughout the upper length of the front end\u2014more extreme than what is known in other therizinosaurs. The front-most part of the dentary was strongly deflected downwards at about a 30 degree angle, a unique feature for this genus. When each hemimandible is articulated with the other, they form a broadly U-shaped, toothless mandibular symphysis that projects upwards towards the front as in ''Erlikosaurus'' and ''[[Neimongosaurus]]''. The expansive, toothless front region of the dentary spans {{convert|25.5|mm|in|abbr=on}} on the right hemimandible of the holotype. Proportionally, the toothless part of the dentary is 20% of its tooth row, which is {{convert|150.3|mm|in|abbr=on}} long. By comparison, the toothless region of ''Erlikosaurus'' was about 12% of the tooth row's length and was almost absent in ''Jianchangosaurus''. The height of the dentary diminished towards the hindmost extend of the tooth row, whereafter it sharply fanned out to contact the {{Dinogloss|surangular}} bone behind it; by contrast, the hind part of the dentary in ''Erlikosaurus'' gradually approached the surungular in a gentle arc.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\">{{cite journal|last1=Zanno|first1=L.

The teeth were restricted to the front two thirds of the dentary, which bore 24 {{Dinogloss|alveoli}} (tooth sockets) in a manner similar to ''Jianchangosaurus'' but different from ''Erlikosaurus'', in which nearly the entire dentary was toothed, bearing 31 alveoli. The tooth row of ''Segnosaurus'' was inset and demarcated by a shelf on the outer side as it was in all derived (or \"advanced\") therizinosaurs. Unlike in other related taxa, the shelf was restricted to the hind part of the dentary and the raised rim that defined it was not as pronounced. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique in having a low ridge rising between the fifth and fourteenth alveoli that divided the dentary into two almost-equally sized front and hind parts. Just above this ridge, the dentary was pierced by a row of {{Dinogloss|foramina}} as in ''Jianchangosaurus'' and ''[[Alxasaurus]]'', which became less regular by the region around the mandibular symphysis, where the two halves of the mandible met at the front. This row was instead directly in line with and on the side of the ridge in ''Erlikosaurus''. The {{Dinogloss|Meckelian groove}} that ran along the inner side of the mandible, was placed further down than in ''Erlikosaurus'' and had a consistent depth until the thirteenth tooth position, whereafter it widened. The lower jaw elements behind the dentary (the {{Dinogloss|splenial}}, surangular, {{Dinogloss|angular}}, and {{Dinogloss|prearticular}} bones) were distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being gracile and linear, and contributing to the hind part of the hemimandible being elongate and almost rectangular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/> The surangular was long and sword-shaped, the angular was wing-like in shape, the prearticular was narrow and curved, and the splenial was thin and triangular in outline. The external mandibular fenestra, an opening at the outer side of the mandible, was larger than that of ''Erlikosaurus'' because the surangular was shallow from top to bottom.<ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\n[[File:Mesial dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Frontmost dentary teeth, showing folded {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (lf) and accessory {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (ad)]]\n''Segnosaurus'' had the fewest teeth in the dentary; 24 in each half determined from the number of sockets, as well as the largest teeth known among therizinosaurs. The dentary teeth were foliodont (leaf-shaped) and bore enlarged, relatively tall, sideways compressed crowns with a slight recurvature at the upper margin of the tips. By comparison, the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were smaller, symmetrical, and simpler. The bases of the crowns increased slightly in size hindwards across the tooth row, which reflected a decrease in sideways compression. The front surfaces of the crowns and outward-facing sides were convex while the inward-facing sides were concave. A thickened ridge ran along the longitude of the inward-facing side near the upper half of the crown, which was flanked by weak grooves near the front and back edges of the teeth, reaching almost to the cervix (neck; the transition between the crown and root) of the teeth. In general, the 18 front-most teeth were relatively homodont (of the same type), though the crown of the second tooth was relatively shorter and more tapered; this may also have been true for the first tooth, but it was not preserved. The teeth further back in the row also decreased in relative height hindwards. By comparison, the front four to five dentary teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' were conidont (cone-shaped) with a gradual transition to foliodont teeth.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/><ref name=\"Perle1979\" />\n\nThe dentary teeth were tightly packed, but not pressed closely together, with the tooth crowns approaching each other at mid-length. The {{Dinogloss|denticles}} (serrations) were large and bulbous, diminishing slightly in size towards the tooth tips, with about 5\u20136 denticles per {{convert|3|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The front {{Dinogloss|carinae}} (cutting edges) folded upwards to overlap the inner surface of the crowns on the third to eighteenth teeth, but such folds were absent on the second and probably first crowns. The denticles were roughly perpendicular with the tip of the tooth crowns, but parallel to the crown height on the front side fold and triangular facet on the hind side. There was a series of accessory denticles (in addition to those on the carinae) that projected from the front surfaces of the carinal folds, which made the front edges of the crowns more broadly roughened. The carinae of the hind edges were also very modified, and bifurcated (split in two) near the cervix, where they formed a flattened triangular, raised facet, which projected from the tooth crown and contacted or approached the folded carinae on the front edge of the crowns behind them (this arrangement is present in teeth 2\u201312). Such split carinae are known from other [[tetanuran]] theropods, where they are considered abnormalities caused by trauma, aberrant [[tooth replacement]], or genetic factors. Though the condition in ''Segnosaurus'' was similar, it was uniformly expressed across the teeth of both dentaries, and does not appear to have been an abnormality, but served to roughen the contacts between tooth bases.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nThe 22nd and 23rd dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'' were significantly smaller than the rest, almost conidont, and had an additional third carina with denticles on their inner sides. Most of the other hindmost tooth crowns are damaged so their complete features are unknown. The additional carina on tooth 23 appears to have been fully denticulated while the denticles were restricted to the basal side of the crown in tooth 22. ''Segnosaurus'' was unique among all known theropods in possessing triple carinae. The 14th alveolus on the right dentary of the holotype is walled over by seemingly [[pathological]] (due to injury or disease) bone growth but the teeth in that part of the dentary are damaged so it is not possible to determine how the teeth were affected by this. The teeth in the same area of the left dentary bear triple carinae, though this dentary has no external indications of pathology that could have led to this condition, thus it cannot be concluded nor ruled out that this feature is the result of a pathology. ''Segnosaurus'' [[Polyphyodont|replaced its teeth]] in waves running from back to front of the jaws, that encompassed two to three erupting crowns. Some of the fully erupted teeth have wear on the carinae of their hind sides, unlike what is seen in other therizinosaurs. The texture of the {{Dinogloss|enamel}} appears to have been broadly irregular and the roots of the teeth were almost circular.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\n===Postcranial skeleton===\n[[File:Segno.jpg|thumb|[[paleoart|Life restoration]]]]\n\nThe {{Dinogloss|scapula}} (shoulder blade) of ''Segnosaurus'' was straight and flat at the upper end, and was fused to the coracoid bone, forming the scapulocoracoid. The coracoid was very wide, rectangular in outline, and thick at the middle. The massive humerus was {{convert|560|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length; it had an almost-cylindrical shaft and well-defined condyles for articulation with the radius and ulna of the lower arm. The deltopectoral crest, where the [[deltoid muscle]] was attached to the upper front of the humerus, was well-developed.<ref name=Perle1979/> The humerus was distinct from those of other therizinosaurs, being straight rather than [[sigmoid shaped]] and not expanded or deflected forwards at its upper end. The humerus was also not expanded at the middle, and the [[entepicondyle]] was not well-developed. The lack of these features was more similar to [[ornithomimosaurs]] and [[troodontids]] than to other therizinosaurs.<ref name=Zanno2010/> The radius was also massive\u2014about 60 percent of the humerus\u2014with a straight shaft. The ulna was thicker than the radius and slightly longer\u2014about 70 percent of the humerus\u2014and slightly twisted along its middle axis. The hand was [[tridactyl]] (three-fingered). The {{Dinogloss|phalanx bones}} of the fingers were flattened from top to bottom and the articular depressions on their sides were not very developed. The first phalanx of the first finger was long and thin while the first and second phalanxes of the second finger were short. The ungual of the third finger was somewhat longer than the second phalanx and quite flat from top to bottom, which may have been a unique feature of ''Segnosaurus''. This ungual was sharpy curved, very pointed, and compressed from side to side. The lower tubercle, where the flexor tendons attached to the ungual, was thick and robust.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /><ref name=\"Dinosauria2\">{{cite book| last1 = Clark | first1 = J.

Some features of the pelvis were similar to that of ''[[Nothronychus]]'', particularly the ischia, but it is uncertain whether these similarities were due to them having a common ancestor to the exclusion of other derived therizinosaurids, or because they retained basal features since lost in other relatives. The ischium of ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from that of ''Nothronychus'' in that it had an almost-rectangular obturator process and an almost-circular obturator foramen. The pelvis was distinct from that of ''[[Enigmosaurus]]'' by its deep obturator process not fusing with its counterpart at the middle, by its unfused pubic boot, and because the lower part of the pubic shaft was wide from front to back. ''Segnosaurus'' was distinct from both ''Nothronychus'' and ''Enigmosaurus'' in having a deep {{Dinogloss|brevis fossa}} (a groove where the [[caudofemoralis brevis muscle]] of the tail originated) and because its pubic boot lacked a well developed hindwards projection.<ref name=Zanno2010/>\n\nThe femur was straight with an oval cross-section and was {{convert|840|mm|in|abbr=on}} in length. The head of the femur was placed on a long \"neck\" and the lower condyles were well-defined. The tibia was straight, slightly shorter than the femur, and twisted along its axis. The fibula was long and narrowed towards its lower end. The metatarsus of the foot was short, massive, and consisted of five bones\u2014four of which functioned as support elements and terminated in four toes. Functionally tetradactyl (four-toed) feet were unique to derived therizinosaurs; basal therizinosaurs and all other theropods had tridactyl feet in which the first toe was short and did not reach the ground. Externally, the metatarsus was similar to, though proportionally larger than, those of [[prosauropods]], an early [[evolutionary grade]] of [[sauropodomorphs]]. The epiphyses on the upper metatarsals were hypertrophied (enlarged), a distinctive feature of the genus. The first toe was shorter than the others but was of equal functional importance; the second and third toes were equally long while the fourth was thinnest. The toe ungual was robust, sharply curved, flat at the side, and more pointed than those of prosauropods. The lower tubercle where the flexor ligaments attached was robust. While the lack of strong compression of the toe unguals distinguished ''Segnosaurus'' from ''Erlikosaurus'' from the same formation, the lack of compression was common among therizinosaurs and therefore not unique to ''Segnosaurus''.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=Zanno2010/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> The cervical vertebrae were platycoelous and had large, massive centra (bodies) and low neural arches. The sacrum consisted of six, firmly fused  vertebrae; the centra of these vertebrae were broadened and relatively elongated, and each centrum was slightly longer than their width. The neural spines here were not very long but surpassed the level of the ilia. The caudal (tail) vertebrae closest to the body were massive, high, and somewhat compressed from side to side. The neural arch was low with a small neural canal. The caudal vertebrae closer to the tip of the tail were platycoelous and had short, massive centra. The transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae and the ribs were robust and elongated.<ref name=Perle1979/><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" />\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Erlikosaurus skull and foot.jpg|thumb|Skull and foot bones of ''[[Erlikosaurus]]'', which together with ''Segnosaurus'' (both from Mongolia) became the basis of the new [[infraorder]] Segnosauria; this group is now a [[junior synonym]] of [[Therizinosauria]].]]\n\n''Segnosaurus'' and its relatives, which are now recognized as therizinosaurs (\"scythe reptiles\"), were long considered an enigmatic group.

He tentatively classified Segnosauridae as theropods, traditionally thought of as the \"meat-eating\" dinosaurs, pointing to similarities in the mandible and its front teeth. Using features of their humeri and hand claws, he distinguished Segnosauridae from the theropod families [[Deinocheiridae]] and Therizinosauridae, which were then only known from the genera ''[[Deinocheirus]]'' and ''Therizinosaurus'', respectively, mainly represented by large forelimbs found in Mongolia.<ref name=Perle1979/> Later in 1979, Barsbold and Perle found the pelvic features of segnosaurids and dromaeosaurids were so different from those of \"true\" theropods that they should be separated into three taxa of the same rank, possibly at the level of [[infraorder]] within [[Saurischia]], one of the two main divisions of dinosaurs\u2014the other being [[Ornithischia]].<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" />\n\nIn 1980, Barsbold and Perle named the new theropod infraorder Segnosauria, containing only Segnosauridae. In the same article, they named the new genus ''Erlikosaurus'' (known from a well-preserved skull and partial skeleton)\u2014which they tentatively considered a segnosaurid\u2014and reported a partial pelvis of an undetermined segnosaurian, both from the same formation as ''Segnosaurus''. The specimens provided relatively complete data on this group; they were united by their opisthopubic pelvis, slender mandible, and the toothless front of their jaws. Barsbold and Perle stated that, though some of their features resembled those of ornithischians and sauropods, these similarities were superficial and distinct when examined in detail. While they were essentially different from other theropods\u2014perhaps due to diverging from them relatively early\u2014and warranted a new infraorder, they did show similarities with the theropods. Because the ''Erlikosaurus'' specimen lacked a pelvis, the authors were unsure that the undetermined segnosaurian could belong to the same genus, in which case they would consider it part of a separate family.<ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> Though ''Erlikosaurus'' was difficult to compare directly to ''Segnosaurus'' because its remains were incomplete, Perle stated in 1981 there was no justification for separating it into another family.<ref name=Perle1981>{{cite journal | last=Perle | first=A. |author-link=Altangerel Perle |year=1981 |title=Noviy segnozavrid iz verchnego mela Mongolii |journal=Trudy \u2013 Sovmestnaya Sovetsko-Mongol'skaya Paleontologicheskaya Ekspeditsiya |volume=15 |pages=50\u201359|language=Russian|trans-title=New Segnosauridae from the Upper Cretaceous of Mongolia|translator-last=Siskron |translator-first=C. |translator2-last=Welles |translator2-first=S.

He found segnosaurs to be similar to prosauropods in the morphology of their snout, mandible, and hindfoot; to ornithischians in their cheek, palate, pubis, and ankle; and to early dinosaurs in other respects. He proposed that ornithischians were descended from prosauropods and that the segnosaurs were an intermediate relic of this transition, which supposedly took place during the [[Triassic period]]. In this way, he considered segnosaurians to have a comparable position to herbivorous dinosaurs in general, as [[monotremes]] have to mammals.

While ''Alxasaurus'' was similar in some respects to prosauropods, the detailed morphology of its limbs linked it to ''Therizinosaurus'' and segnosaurs. Because its fore and hindlimbs were preserved, ''Alxasaurus'' showed that Perle's assignment of segnosaurian hindlimbs to ''Therizinosaurus'' was probably correct. Russell and Dong therefore proposed that Segnosauridae was a [[junior synonym]] of the older name Therizinosauridae, and that ''Alxasaurus'' was the most completely known representative so far. They also named the new higher taxonomic rank [[Therizinosauroidea]] to contain ''Alxasaurus'' and Therizinosauridae because the new genus was somewhat different from its relatives. They concluded that therizinosaurs were tetanuran theropods, most closely related to ornithomimids, troodontids, and oviraptorids, which they placed together in the group [[Oviraptorosauria]] (because they found [[Maniraptora]]\u2014the conventional grouping of these\u2014invalid, and the higher level taxonomy of theropods was in flux).<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\">{{cite journal |last1=Russell |first1=D.

The eggs were found in a single [[stratigraphic layer]], suggesting the dinosaurs nested at the site on a single occasion and did not exhibit [[site fidelity]] (always returning to the same site to breed).<ref name=\"MongoliaEggs\">{{cite journal |title=First record of a dinosaur nesting colony from Mongolia reveals nesting behavior of therizinosauroids |journal=Hokkaido University |url=https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/blog/first-record-of-a-dinosaur-nesting-colony-from-mongolia-reveals-nesting-behavior-of-therizinosauroids/ |access-date=2019-12-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191221194650/https://www.global.hokudai.ac.jp/blog/first-record-of-a-dinosaur-nesting-colony-from-mongolia-reveals-nesting-behavior-of-therizinosauroids/ |archive-date=2019-12-21 |url-status=live |date=2013}}</ref>\n\n===Diet and feeding===\n[[File:Therizinosaurian mandibular morphology.png|thumb|left|Right half of the holotype mandible shown from the inner side (A), the top (C), and bottom (D), and the left half shown from the inner side (B), compared with the mandibles of other therizinosaurs (to scale in lower right)]]\n\nThe unusual features of therizinosaurs have led to several interpretations of their feeding behavior; there is no direct evidence of their diet, such as stomach contents and feeding traces. In 1970, [[Anatoly K. Rozhdestvensky]] suggested ''Therizinosaurus''\u2014the only member of the group known at the time\u2014used its large claws to open [[termite mounds]] or gather fruits from trees.<ref name=\"Dinosauria2\"/> Barsbold and Perle pointed out in 1979 and 1980 that their peculiar features probably reflected a different evolutionary direction than those of more typical theropods, many of which were considered effective, active predators. Their delicate jaws, small, weak teeth and beaks, and short, compact feet indicated they would not have used the armaments of other theropods to procure food, but could have preyed on fish.<ref name=\"Barsbold&Perle1979\" /><ref name=\"perle&barsbold80\" /> In 1983, Barsbold said the horny beak at the front of the jaws and weakened teeth at the back were common features among herbivorous dinosaurs but not of carnivorous theropods, and speculated this might indicate segnosaurs had shifted to herbivory.<ref name=barsbold1983/> In 1984, Paul suggested they were herbivorous due to the similarities of their skulls to those of prosauropod and ornithischian dinosaurs, which include horny beaks, inset rows of teeth, and a shelf at the side of the jaws that indicated the presence of cheeks. Like ornithischians, they could therefore crop, manipulate, and chew plants in a sophisticated manner. He also suggested the ilia of the pelvis had sideways-flaring blades at the front similar to those of sauropods to support a large gut that was used to ferment and process food.<ref name=\"Paul1984\"/> Norman stated in 1985 the possibility ''Segnosaurus'' was an aquatic fish eater could explain its small, pointed teeth and broad and perhaps webbed feet, but found it mysterious why it should have a horny beak.<ref name=\"DBN85\"/>\n\n[[File:Erliansaurus bellamanus.jpg|thumb|Restoration of ''[[Erliansaurus]]'' in a \"sitting\" pose that therizinosaurs may have employed during feeding]]\nIn 1993, Russell and Dong considered the small size of the head, blunt beaks and large body weights of therizinosaurs consistent with herbivory.<ref name=\"Alxasaurus\"/> In 1993 and 1997, Russell suggested therizinosaurs would have \"sat\" on their pelvises and supported their bodies on their hind limbs while using their long arms, claws, and flexible necks to reach leaves from trees and bushes with their beaks. They could have reached even higher while standing and browsing bipedally. This parallels the way some herbivorous mammals use their forelimbs to manipulate vegetation; Russell considered the extinct [[chalicotheres]] and [[ground sloth]]s, as well as [[gorilla]]s, adaptively convergent with therizinosaurs. Because therizinosaur remains are often found in [[sediments]] deposited in river and lake environments, Russell said they may have browsed on [[riparian]] bushes and trees.<ref name=Russell1997>{{cite book |last=Russell |first=D.

He found this consistent with Rozhdestvensky's suggestion that therizinosaurs may have fed on [[social insects]].<ref name=\"Nessov\" /> In a 2006 conference abstract, Sara Burch presented the inferred range of motion in the arms of the therizinosaur ''Neimongosaurus'' and concluded the overall motion at the {{Dinogloss|glenoid}}-humeral joint at the shoulder was roughly circular, and directed sideways and slightly downwards, which diverged from the more oval, backwards-and-downwards-directed ranges of other theropods. This ability to extend their arms considerably forwards may have helped therizinosars reach and grasp for foliage.<ref name=\"burch2006\">{{Cite conference |last=Burch |first=S. |year=2006 |title=The range of motion of the glenohumeral joint of the therizinosaur ''Neimongosaurus yangi'' (Dinosauria: Theropoda) |conference=Chicago Biological Investigator |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=20}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009, Zanno and colleagues stated therizinosaurs were the most-widely regarded candidates for herbivory among theropods and listed features associated with this diet. These included small, densely packed, coarse serrations; lanceolate (lance-shaped) teeth with a low replacement rate; a beak at the front of the jaws; an inset tooth row that suggests fleshy cheeks; an elongated neck; a small skull; a very large gut capacity as indicated by the rib circumference at the trunk and the outwards flaring processes of the ilia; and the loss of [[cursorial]] (related to running) adaptations in the hind limbs, including development of functionally tetradactyl feet. Zanno and colleagues found the clades at the base of Maniraptora\u2014Ornithomimosauria, Therizinosauria, and Oviraptorosauria\u2014had either direct or morphological evidence for herbivory, which would mean either this diet evolved independently multiple times in coelurosaurian theropods or that the primitive condition of the group was at least facultative herbivory with carnivory only emerging in more derived maniraptorans.<ref name=\"Zanno2009\">{{cite journal |last1=Zanno |first1=L.

In genera where both neck and forelimb elements are preserved, however, the necks were equal in length or longer than the forelimbs, so pulling vegetation would only make sense if lower parts of long branches were pulled down to access out-of-reach parts of trees.<ref name=\"Claws\"/>\n\n[[File:Dentary teeth of Segnosaurus.png|thumb|upright|Hindmost dentary teeth showing the third cutting edge (lc), unique to ''Segnosaurus'' among theropods]]\nZanno and colleagues stated in 2016 that therizinosaurs were generally accepted to fall within the spectrum of [[omnivory]] and herbivory, with a trend towards intensified herbivory. While various anatomical features have been used to support this idea, tooth morphology had been considered relatively simplistic and with few unique specializations compared to other herbivorous dinosaurs. The few modifications include the increased symmetry in the teeth of ''Erlikosaurus'' and the enlargement of denticles in ''Segnosaurus''. Zanno and collegaues identified novel, complex features in the dentary teeth of ''Segnosaurus'', including the presence of additional carinae and folded carinae with denticulated front edges, which indicate ''Segnosaurus'' had a higher degree of oral food processing than other therizinosaurs. These traits together created a roughened, shredding surface near the base of the tooth crowns that was unique to ''Segnosaurus'' and suggest it consumed unique food resources or used highly specialized feeding strategies. Because multiple geological formations show evidence of [[sympatric]] therizinosaur species\u2014related species that lived in the same area at the same time\u2014it is possible [[niche partitioning]] between them could have played a role in the group's evolutionary success. This is supported by ''Segnosaurus'' with its highly specialized dentition being a contemporary of ''Erlikosaurus'' with its relatively indistinct teeth, indicating their partitioning in food acquisition, processing, or resources. This conclusion is also strengthened by the large difference in estimated body masses of sympatric therizinosaurs in the Bayan Shireh Formation, which was up to 500%.<ref name=\"Zanno2016\"/>\n\nIn a 2017 study of niche partitioning in therizinosaurs through digital simulations, Lautenschlager found the dentaries of ''Segnosaurus'' experienced one of the lowest stress magnitudes during extrinsic feeding scenarios. ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' were aided by the down-turned tip of the lower jaws and symphyseal regions, and probably also by beaks, which are known to mitigate stress and strain. By contrast, the straighter and more elongated dentaries of basal therizinosaurs\u2014typical of their coelurosaurian ancestors\u2014had the highest magnitudes of stress and strain. A downwards-pulling motion of the head while gripping vegetation was more likely than a sideways or upwards movement, though such behavior would be more likely in ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' with their stress-mitigating jaws. Difference in relative bite force between the sympatric ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' show the former would have been able to feed on tougher vegetation while the overall robustness of the latter suggests greater flexibility in its manner of feeding, because stress levels stayed low across feeding simulations. Lautenschlager agreed the two taxa were adapted to different modes of feeding and food selection; ''Segnosaurus'' was more adapted to using its dentition to procure or process food while ''Erlikosaurus'' mostly used its beak for cropping and its neck musculature while foraging. The difference in size between ''Segnosaurus'' and ''Erlikosaurus'' (the former of which is estimated to have weighed more than the latter) indicates these effects were increased and that there were further mechanisms partitioning their resources, such as different heights. Because other therizinosaur taxa were more divided in time and space, other factors than competition within their group may also have contributed to their variation, such as adaptations to different flora and competition with other kinds of herbivores.<ref name=\"Niche\">{{cite journal |last1=Lautenschlager |first1=S. |title=Functional niche partitioning in Therizinosauria provides new insights into the evolution of theropod herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2017 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=375\u2013387 |doi=10.1111/pala.12289|url=http://pure-oai.bham.ac.uk/ws/files/39402933/FUNCTIONAL_NICHE_PARTITIONING_IN_THERIZINOSAURIA_REVISED2.pdf }}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Loredana Macaluso and colleagues pointed out that the hips of therizinosaurs were peculiar because the shaft of the pubic bone was rotated backwards whereas the pubic boot was strongly projected forwards. While the larger gut associated with herbivory was able to push the shaft backwards, they suggested the pubic boot was restrained by [[ventilatory muscles]] that were crucial for cuirassal ventilation\u2014breathing with extra [[air sacs]]\u2014which shows the importance of this mode of respiration.<ref name=\"Macaluso\">{{cite journal |last1=Macaluso |first1=L. |last2=Tschopp |first2=E. |last3=Mannion |first3=P. |title=Evolutionary changes in pubic orientation in dinosaurs are more strongly correlated with the ventilation system than with herbivory |journal=Palaeontology |date=2018 |volume=61 |issue=5 |pages=703\u2013719 |doi=10.1111/pala.12362}}</ref> In a 2019 study of jaw musculature, Ali Nabavizadeh concluded therizinosaurs were mainly orthal feeders\u2014moving their jaws up and down\u2014and raised their jaws isognathously whereby the upper and lower teeth of each side [[Occlusion (dentistry)|occluded]] (contacted each other) at once.

In fact, Hart had told [[E. J. Dionne]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' that if reporters followed him around, they would \"be bored\". However, in a separate investigation, the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' claimed to have received an anonymous tip from a friend of [[Donna Rice]] that Rice was involved with Hart.

In the video Biden is filmed repeating a stump speech by Kinnock, with only minor modifications. [[Michael Dukakis]] later acknowledged that his campaign was responsible for leaking the tape, and two members of his staff resigned.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAllegations were also leaked to the press that Biden had been guilty of plagiarism years before, in law school. Though Biden professed his integrity, the impression lingering in the media as the result of this double punch would lead him to drop out of the race.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe [[Delaware Supreme Court]]'s Board on Professional Responsibility would later clear Biden of the law school plagiarism charges.<ref>{{cite news | title=Professional Board Clears Biden In Two Allegations of Plagiarism | page=29 | work=The New York Times | date=May 29, 1989 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/29/us/professional-board-clears-biden-in-two-allegations-of-plagiarism.html }}</ref>\n\n==Results==\nIn the [[Iowa caucuses]], Gephardt finished first, Simon finished second, and Dukakis finished third. In the [[New Hampshire primary]], Dukakis finished first, Gephardt finished second, and Simon finished third. Dukakis and Gore campaigned hard against Gephardt with negative ads, and eventually the [[United Auto Workers]] retracted their endorsement of Gephardt, who was heavily dependent on labor union backing.\n\nIn the [[Super Tuesday]] races, Dukakis won six primaries, Gore five, Jackson five and Gephardt one, with Gore and Jackson splitting the southern states. The next week, Simon won Illinois. 1988 is tied with 1992 as the race with the most candidates winning primaries since the McGovern reforms of 1971. Gore's effort to paint Dukakis as too liberal for the general election proved unsuccessful and he eventually withdrew. Jackson focused more on getting enough delegates to make sure African-American interests were represented in the platform than on winning outright.<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Juan|title=Waiting for The Jackson Reaction; Will Jesse End His Crusade With a Bang or a Whimper?|date=1988-07-17|work=The Washington Post|page=C1}}</ref> Dukakis eventually emerged as the party's nominee.\n===Statewide===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n!

In fact, Hart had told [[E. J. Dionne]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' that if reporters followed him around, they would \"be bored\".

[[Michael Dukakis]] later acknowledged that his campaign was responsible for leaking the tape, and two members of his staff resigned.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nAllegations were also leaked to the press that Biden had been guilty of plagiarism years before, in law school.

In the [[New Hampshire primary]], Dukakis finished first, Gephardt finished second, and Simon finished third. Dukakis and Gore campaigned hard against Gephardt with negative ads, and eventually the [[United Auto Workers]] retracted their endorsement of Gephardt, who was heavily dependent on labor union backing.\n\nIn the [[Super Tuesday]] races, Dukakis won six primaries, Gore five, Jackson five and Gephardt one, with Gore and Jackson splitting the southern states. The next week, Simon won Illinois. 1988 is tied with 1992 as the race with the most candidates winning primaries since the McGovern reforms of 1971. Gore's effort to paint Dukakis as too liberal for the general election proved unsuccessful and he eventually withdrew. Jackson focused more on getting enough delegates to make sure African-American interests were represented in the platform than on winning outright.<ref>{{cite news|last=Williams|first=Juan|title=Waiting for The Jackson Reaction; Will Jesse End His Crusade With a Bang or a Whimper?|date=1988-07-17|work=The Washington Post|page=C1}}</ref> Dukakis eventually emerged as the party's nominee.\n===Statewide===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n|-\n!

His brothers were also a poet Antonio Machado and Jos\u00e9 Machado.\nInherited his father's love of popular [[Andalusians|Andalusian]] character. Born in San Pedro Martir Street No. 20, his childhood was spent in the Palacio de las Due\u00f1as, where his family had rented one of the zones reserved for individuals. When Manuel was 9, the whole family moved to Madrid, because the paternal grandfather had obtained a professorship at the Universidad Central. The desire of all the three brothers was studying in the Free Institution of Teaching, led by [[Francisco Giner de los R\u00edos]], a great friend of the grandfather Manuel.\n\nThe family moved to Madrid, where he developed his studies, culminating with a Bachelor of Arts. Since then, his family returned to Seville in few occasions, but Seville and [[Andalusia]] remained for him a living reference, though distant, for the love of his parents towards their land.\n\nIn Madrid, Manuel began to publicize his first poetry and contributed to several literary life in Madrid along with writers like Francis and Juan Ram\u00f3n Jim\u00e9nez Villaespesa.\n\nHe was co-founder, on February 11, 1933 of the Association of Friends of the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nOver the years, he became director of Madrid's Municipal Library (now the Municipal Historical Library) and Municipal Museum. He created several short-lived literary magazines and worked in daily newspapers in Europe and America.\n\nContributed strongly to the modernist poetry, understood in its most colorful, decadent, cosmopolitan, giving a hint of Andalusian poetry makes something unique.\n\nIt has often been opposed to the modernist side of the 98 Generation.\n\nIn 1936-during the civil war, was appointed to a seat in the [[Royal Spanish Academy]].\n\nBrothers Manuel and Antonio wrote together several dramatic works of Andalusian. Manuel's most notable work is ''La Lola se va a los puertos'', filmed twice.\n\nOther dramatic works of Machado were the ''La duquesa de Benamej\u00ed'', ''La prima Fernanda'', ''Juan de Ma\u00f1ara'', ''El hombre que muri\u00f3 en la guerra'' and ''Desdichas de la fortuna o Julianillo Valc\u00e1rcel''.\n\nAlthough the poetry of both is very different, we can see certain parallels. Thus, both paths composed autobiographical poems (\"Adelfos\" Manuel, and \"Portrait\", by Antonio) using Alexandrine verses organized in serventesios. The civil war separated the brothers, placing them on opposite sides.\n\nUpon arrival in Madrid after the [[Spanish coup of July 1936]], Manuel gave the military an encomiastic poetry, \"The sword of the Caudillo.\" This earned him the recognition of the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]]. After the war he returned to his post as director of the Newspaper Library and the Municipal Museum of Madrid, who retired shortly thereafter. He continued to write poetry, mostly [[religious]] in nature. His [[Catholic faith]] was rekindled during your stay in [[Burgos]] thanks to the devotion of his wife and the influence of certain [[priests]], as Bonifacio Zamora. The poet continued to write eulogies to various figures and symbols of [[Francoist Spain]], which earned him the scorn of critics and later poets, who considered him a traitor to the Spanish Second Republic.\n\nOn January 19, 1947 died in Madrid. After the poet's death, his widow entered a [[religious order]] dedicated to caring for abandoned and sick children.\n\nThen came the Spanish openness of the 60 and 70, [[Francisco Franco]] gave the youth side to the poets covered by Spain and embraced those who died, or still living-in-exile. Thus, the work and the figure of Manuel Machado were eclipsed by those of Antonio Machado, more akin to the taste of time.\n\nSome of Manuel Machado poems are as famous as these ones:\n\n:'''CANTARES'''\n\n:Vino, sentimiento, guitarra y poes\u00eda\n:hacen los cantares de la patria m\u00eda.\n:Quien dice cantares dice Andaluc\u00eda.\n:A la sombra fresca de la vieja parra,\n:un mozo moreno rasguea la guitarra...\n:Cantares...\n:Algo que acaricia y algo que desgarra.\n\n:La prima que canta y el bord\u00f3n que llora...\n:Y el tiempo callado se va hora tras hora.\n:Cantares...\n:Son dejos fatales de la raza mora.\n\n:No importa la vida, que ya est\u00e1 perdida,\n:y, despu\u00e9s de todo, \u00bfqu\u00e9 es eso, la vida?...\n:Cantares...\n:Cantando la pena, la pena se olvida.\n\n:Madre, pena, suerte, pena, madre, muerte,\n:ojos negros, negros, y negra la suerte...\n:Cantares...\n:En ellos el alma del alma se vierte.\n\n:Cantares.

The poet continued to write eulogies to various figures and symbols of [[Francoist Spain]], which earned him the scorn of critics and later poets, who considered him a traitor to the Spanish Second Republic.\n\nOn January 19, 1947 died in Madrid. After the poet's death, his widow entered a [[religious order]] dedicated to caring for abandoned and sick children.\n\nThen came the Spanish openness of the 60 and 70, [[Francisco Franco]] gave the youth side to the poets covered by Spain and embraced those who died, or still living-in-exile. Thus, the work and the figure of Manuel Machado were eclipsed by those of Antonio Machado, more akin to the taste of time.\n\nSome of Manuel Machado poems are as famous as these ones:\n\n:'''CANTARES'''\n\n:Vino, sentimiento, guitarra y poes\u00eda\n:hacen los cantares de la patria m\u00eda.\n:Quien dice cantares dice Andaluc\u00eda.\n:A la sombra fresca de la vieja parra,\n:un mozo moreno rasguea la guitarra...\n:Cantares...\n:Algo que acaricia y algo que desgarra.\n\n:La prima que canta y el bord\u00f3n que llora...\n:Y el tiempo callado se va hora tras hora.\n:Cantares...\n:Son dejos fatales de la raza mora.\n\n:No importa la vida, que ya est\u00e1 perdida,\n:y, despu\u00e9s de todo, \u00bfqu\u00e9 es eso, la vida?...\n:Cantares...\n:Cantando la pena, la pena se olvida.\n\n:Madre, pena, suerte, pena, madre, muerte,\n:ojos negros, negros, y negra la suerte...\n:Cantares...\n:En ellos el alma del alma se vierte.\n\n:Cantares. Cantares de la patria m\u00eda,\n:quien dice cantares dice Andaluc\u00eda.\n:Cantares...\n:No tiene m\u00e1s notas la guitarra m\u00eda.\n\n:'''CASTILLA'''\n\n:El ciego sol se estrella\n:en las duras aristas de las armas,\n:llaga de luz los petos y espaldares\n:y flamea en las puntas de las lanzas.\n:El ciego sol, la sed y la fatiga.\n:Por la terrible estepa castellana,\n:al destierro, con doce de los suyos\n:\u2014polvo, sudor y hierro\u2014, el Cid cabalga.\n:Cerrado est\u00e1 el mes\u00f3n a piedra y lodo.\n:Nadie responde.

She approached [[soil management]] in a way designed to work naturally with the farm's environment, which was particularly important in Brazil. According to her research, the most appropriate type of agriculture there would encourage farmers to favor treating the soil so it has high levels of organic matter, avoids movement, controls pests using biological techniques, and avoids chemical inputs by substituting organic additives such as [[green manure]]. She called her methods [[agroecology]]. <ref name=\":5\" /> \n\nIn a 2016 interview,<ref name=\":2\" /> she explained one aspect of tropical soils:<blockquote>\"In the tropics, 80% of microorganisms found in the soil are fungi that produce enormous amounts of antibiotics and have their life inhibited below 15 centimeters. In the past, when farmers worked with an ox or donkey plow, the plow did not go below 12 or 15 cm and the land remained more or less in the superficial part. Now with the mechanical traction plow, you can reach 30 or 40 cm, put the dead part on top that is broken up by the rain, enters the ground and clogs the pores. There the land is hard, compacted. Everyone asks me what to do with compaction. In the tropics, you cannot work the land deeply at all.

She lived on the farm for more than 30 years and authored multiple publications about her research and agriculture work.

Krishnan Sethukumar produced the film under the banners of Moviee Mill and [[Gemini Film Circuit|Gemini Studios]]. The film stars [[Mammootty]], [[Shine Tom Chacko]], [[Jacob Gregory]] and Arjun Ashokan. The story is based on a real incident that occurred at the time of the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 Lok Sabha election]], when a police unit from Kerala was sent to a [[Maoism|Maoist]] affected area of Chhattisgarh as part of election duty. Sajith Purushan was the film's cinematographer, and its [[soundtrack]] and [[film score|score]] were composed by [[Prashant Pillai]].\n\nThe film tells the story of a nine-man police unit from Kerala led by Sub-inspector Manikandan C. P. (Mammootty), who travel for another state election duty in a Maoist prone area in Chhattisgarh. Deceived by the calm and quiet on their first day, they were just starting to let their hair down when the shoot out the next day made them aware of the dangers they were about to face. In their initial rush of excitement, they fired all of the very limited number of bullets they had brought with them. To conduct the elections peacefully with only eight bullets left becomes a humongous task ahead of them.\n\n''Unda''\u2019s development began in 2014, when Rahman spotted an article featured in the ''[[Malayala Manorama]]'' daily. The article was about a police unit from Kerala posted as part of election duty in a [[Naxalite|Maoist]] affected area in [[Chhattisgarh]] without sufficient ammunition. After a brief research, Harshad along with Rahman wrote the screenplay in 2016. Eventually, Sethukumar replacing [[Anwar Rasheed]], who was its initial financer, became the producer of the film. The title was announced on 21 September 2018 and production commenced from October. [[Principal photography]] began by the second week of October in [[Kasaragod]] and shooting was completed on 23 March 2019 in Chhattisgarh.\n\nThe film released in [[Kerala]] and rest of India on 14 June 2019 and globally on 19 June. Upon release, the film met with widespread critical acclaim. The performances of its cast, direction and screenplay were praised by critics. It grossed over \u20b920 crore worldwide in 10 days at the box office and became a commercial success. The film was screened at the [[International Film Festival of Kerala|24th International Film Festival of Kerala 2019]] under the section 'Malayalam Cinema Today'.\n\n== Plot ==\nPolice units from the Kerala Police camp in [[Idukki]] are preparing to go for their other state election duty. They are briefed by their senior officer Sam J. Mathan ([[Kalabhavan Shajohn]]) that the duty will be in [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Jharkhand]] and will last for 40 days. He also emphasizes on the statement to use ammunition only when necessary. A unit under CI Mathews Anthony ([[Ranjith (director)|Ranjith]]) arrives in [[Bastar district|Bastar]] at Chhattisgarh, which is one of the most dangerous [[Naxalite|Maoist]] affected red belts in India. Due to the unavailability in accommodating all the police teams in the [[Indo-Tibetan Border Police|ITBP]] camp, they are forced to find shelter in their respective polling booths assigned to them until the Election Day. On their way to the booths, they split as three teams with Mani ([[Mammootty]]) leading one. That very night, they receive a wireless message informing about a Maoist attack likely to happen. Though they became alert with loaded guns, no such attack happened over-night. The next day morning, ITBP Commandant Dakota Akanito (Chien Ho Liao) finds the team very irresponsible and makes them understand the seriousness of their duty showing them footage of people killed during Maoist attacks in the past. He becomes shocked when he comes to know that the team is not even provided with sufficient bullets and ammunition by the State Government.\n\nAfter realizing the threat in their duty, Mani speaks to Mathews over phone and informs him what the ITBP commandant told. Mathews tells him that the state government had said that providing ammunition is the responsibility of the state government in Chhattisgarh. The next day night, the team encounters with a light shootout by the Maoists and fires back. Later, the ITBP officers inform them that some Maoists were chased by them and they unknowingly fired back bullets seeing the lights and the remaining were fire crackers. The team ashamed realizes that the firing resulted in the wastage of bullets and they now have only eight bullets remaining.\n\nThe next day, Mani goes to meet Mathews and informs him that their situation is in danger without sufficient ammunition. Some in the team are angry at Mani as they felt that he hadn't done anything during the previous day's firing on purpose. Mani realizing that something has to be done immediately to stay alive, sends some pictures to his friends in Kerala of the team laying on floor without any facilities and making a note of their current situation. Back in Kerala after receiving his  message, the news gets featured on a newspaper and Sam J. Mathan is forced to take action and quickly makes arrangement to send more bullets and ammunition for the team. Two cops Rajan ([[Asif Ali (actor)|Asif Ali]]) and Balan ([[Vinay Forrt]]) continue their journey in a train from [[Kerala]] to Chhattisgarh with the necessary bullets and ammunition that has been allotted. Meantime, Unnikrishnan (Abhiram Radhakrishnan) accompanied by Biju Kumar (Lukman), without informing Mani gets to a place in the village to buy liquor. On their way back, Unnikrishnan starts to tease Biju Kumar who belongs to the [[adivasi]] community. Biju Kumar who has been hearing the abuses repeatedly loses control and hits Unnikrishnan. They end the fight when they spot a truck approaching from the distance, which suddenly explodes passing over a [[land mine]]. Both of them survive with minor injuries. That night, Biju Kumar informs the others in the presence of Mani that he would want to quit his job because he cannot withstand such kind of criticisms anymore.\n\nLater that night, Rajan and Balan finds the box carrying the bullets in the train missing and stand furious without knowing what to do next. On the day of the election, Mathews informs them that both the bullets and the people assigned to carry it have been missing. Mani reaches the booth and comes to know that an election candidate along with his goons had barged into the booth and had created a ruckus by [[Electoral fraud|vote rigging]]. He slaps a goon who tries to destroy the [[Electronic Voting Machines|EVM]] and asks the rest of them to clear out. Sometime later, they see the goons approaching in a larger number. Mani tells his team that they would have to conduct the election peacefully no matter any means with only the eight bullets left. Due to the shortage of ammunition he instructs his team to use their lathis and shields in which they are very much experienced. Mani and his team defeat the goons and successfully complete their election duty assigned to them. Beside some railway track, the box carrying the bullets which was lost and never reached is seen lying and a monkey keeps jumping over it.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Main cast ===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 175\n | footer    = Asif Ali (Top) and Vinay Forrt (Bottom) appeared in cameo roles in the film\n | image1    = Asif Ali Malayalam Actor.jpg\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  =\n | image2    = Vinay Forrt Actor.jpg\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n}}\n* [[Mammootty]] as [[Sub-inspector|S.

It reported that the unit, posted in an area with rampant [[Naxalite|Maoist]] activity, were not provided with sufficient ammunition. Rahman found a photograph showing a bunch of cops crammed into a tiny room, sleeping on the floor holding their rifles close to their chest, haunting. After realizing that the article had a film subject in it, Rahman met some of the police officers in person to develop the film's basic storyline. The film had to be set outside Kerala and required to be made on a large canvas, Rahman in the meantime worked on another film, ''[[Anuraga Karikkin Vellam]]'' (2016), which became his directorial debut. It was [[Anwar Rasheed]] who suggested Harshad to Rahman for writing ''Unda''\u2019s screenplay. In 2016, Rahman and Harshad started to write ''Unda''\u2019s screenplay. Initially, Harshad had developed a one-liner based on all the details collected by Rahman. Later, both of them along with cinematographer Jimshi and their assistants had traveled to [[Bastar district|Bastar]] to collect some more details.<ref name=\"Harshad interview\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.mediaonetv.in/interviews/2019/06/15/interview-with-mammootty-film-unda-screenplay-writer-harshad |last=\u0d39\u0d16\u0d4d |first=\u0d07\u0d1c\u0d3e\u0d38\u0d41\u0d32\u0d4d\u200d |date=16 June 2019 |work=[[MediaOne TV]] |access-date=23 July 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191013095303/https://www.mediaonetv.in/interviews/2019/06/15/interview-with-mammootty-film-unda-screenplay-writer-harshad |archive-date=13 October 2019 |language=ml |script-title=ml:\u0d0e\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d31\u0d46 \u0d38\u0d3f\u0d28\u0d3f\u0d2e\u0d2f\u0d3e\u0d23\u0d4d \u0d0e\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d31\u0d46 \u0d30\u0d3e\u0d37\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d40\u0d2f\u0d02: \u0d39\u0d30\u0d4d\u0d37\u0d26\u0d4d |trans-title=My film is my politics: Harshad}}</ref><ref name=\"writer Harshad\" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.mathrubhumi.com/movies-music/news/mammootty-movie-unda-background-story-khalid-rahman-harshad-unda-malayalam-movie-1.3872091 |last=Mathrubhumi |date=14 June 2019 |work=[[Mathrubhumi]] |access-date=8 July 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191013095625/https://www.mathrubhumi.com/movies-music/news/mammootty-movie-unda-background-story-khalid-rahman-harshad-unda-malayalam-movie-1.3872091 |archive-date=13 October 2019 |language=ml |script-title=ml:'\u0d09\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d1f'\u0d2f\u0d3f\u0d32\u0d46 \u0d35\u0d3f\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d32\u0d28\u0d4d \u0d06\u0d30\u0d3e\u0d23\u0d4d? \u0d16\u0d3e\u0d32\u0d3f\u0d26\u0d4d \u0d31\u0d39\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d28\u0d4d \u0d2a\u0d31\u0d1e\u0d4d\u0d1e\u0d24\u0d4d \u0d35\u0d46\u0d33\u0d3f\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d46\u0d1f\u0d41\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3f \u0d24\u0d3f\u0d30\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d25\u0d3e\u0d15\u0d43\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d4d |trans-title=Who is the villain in \u2018Unda\u2019?

Krishnan Sethukumar produced the film under the banners of Moviee Mill and [[Gemini Film Circuit|Gemini Studios]]. The film stars [[Mammootty]], [[Shine Tom Chacko]], [[Jacob Gregory]] and Arjun Ashokan. The story is based on a real incident that occurred at the time of the [[2014 Indian general election|2014 Lok Sabha election]], when a police unit from Kerala was sent to a [[Maoism|Maoist]] affected area of Chhattisgarh as part of election duty. Sajith Purushan was the film's cinematographer, and its [[soundtrack]] and [[film score|score]] were composed by [[Prashant Pillai]].\n\nThe film tells the story of a nine-man police unit from Kerala led by Sub-inspector Manikandan C. P. (Mammootty), who travel for an other state election duty in a Maoist prone area in Chhattisgarh. Deceived by the calm and quiet on their first day, they were just starting to let their hair down when the shoot out the next day made them aware of the dangers they were about to face. In their initial rush of excitement, they fired all of the very limited number of bullets they had brought with them. To conduct the elections peacefully with only eight bullets left becomes a humongous task ahead of them.\n\n''Unda''\u2019s development began in 2014, when Rahman spotted an article featured in the ''[[Malayala Manorama]]'' daily. The article was about a police unit from Kerala posted as part of election duty in a [[Naxalite|Maoist]] affected area in [[Chhattisgarh]] without sufficient ammunition. After a brief research, Harshad along with Rahman wrote the screenplay in 2016. Eventually, Sethukumar replacing [[Anwar Rasheed]], who was its initial financer, became the producer of the film. The title was announced on 21 September 2018 and production commenced from October. [[Principal photography]] began by the second week of October in [[Kasaragod]] and shooting was completed on 23 March 2019 in Chhattisgarh.\n\nThe film released in [[Kerala]] and rest of India on 14 June 2019 and globally on 19 June. Upon release, the film met with widespread critical acclaim. The performances of its cast, direction and screenplay were praised by critics. It grossed over \u20b920 crore worldwide in 10 days at the box office and became a commercial success. The film was screened at the [[International Film Festival of Kerala|24th International Film Festival of Kerala 2019]] under the section 'Malayalam Cinema Today'.\n\n== Plot ==\nPolice units from the Kerala Police camp in [[Idukki]] are preparing to go for their other state election duty. They are briefed by their senior officer Sam J. Mathan ([[Kalabhavan Shajohn]]) that the duty will be in [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Jharkhand]] and will last for 40 days. He also emphasizes on the statement to use ammunition only when necessary. A unit under CI Mathews Anthony ([[Ranjith (director)|Ranjith]]) arrives in [[Bastar district|Bastar]] at Chhattisgarh, which is one of the most dangerous [[Naxalite|Maoist]] affected red belts in India. Due to the unavailability in accommodating all the police teams in the [[Indo-Tibetan Border Police|ITBP]] camp, they are forced to find shelter in their respective polling booths assigned to them until the Election Day. On their way to the booths, they split as three teams with Mani ([[Mammootty]]) leading one. That very night, they receive a wireless message informing about a Maoist attack likely to happen. Though they became alert with loaded guns, no such attack happened over-night. The next day morning, ITBP Commandant Dakota Akanito (Chien Ho Liao) finds the team very irresponsible and makes them understand the seriousness of their duty showing them footage of people killed during Maoist attacks in the past. He becomes shocked when he comes to know that the team is not even provided with sufficient bullets and ammunition by the State Government.\n\nAfter realizing the threat in their duty, Mani speaks to Mathews over phone and informs him what the ITBP commandant told. Mathews tells him that the state government had said that providing ammunition is the responsibility of the state government in Chhattisgarh. The next day night, the team encounters with a light shootout by the Maoists and fires back. Later, the ITBP officers inform them that some Maoists were chased by them and they unknowingly fired back bullets seeing the lights and the remaining were fire crackers. The team ashamed realizes that the firing resulted in the wastage of bullets and they now have only eight bullets remaining.\n\nThe next day, Mani goes to meet Mathews and informs him that their situation is in danger without sufficient ammunition. Some in the team are angry at Mani as they felt that he hadn't done anything during the previous day's firing on purpose. Mani realizing that something has to be done immediately to stay alive, sends some pictures to his friends in Kerala of the team laying on floor without any facilities and making a note of their current situation. Back in Kerala after receiving his  message, the news gets featured on a newspaper and Sam J. Mathan is forced to take action and quickly makes arrangement to send more bullets and ammunition for the team. Two cops Rajan ([[Asif Ali (actor)|Asif Ali]]) and Balan ([[Vinay Forrt]]) continue their journey in a train from [[Kerala]] to Chhattisgarh with the necessary bullets and ammunition that has been allotted. Meantime, Unnikrishnan (Abhiram Radhakrishnan) accompanied by Biju Kumar (Lukman), without informing Mani gets to a place in the village to buy liquor. On their way back, Unnikrishnan starts to tease Biju Kumar who belongs to the [[adivasi]] community. Biju Kumar who has been hearing the abuses repeatedly loses control and hits Unnikrishnan. They end the fight when they spot a truck approaching from the distance, which suddenly explodes passing over a [[land mine]]. Both of them survive with minor injuries. That night, Biju Kumar informs the others in the presence of Mani that he would want to quit his job because he cannot withstand such kind of criticisms anymore.\n\nLater that night, Rajan and Balan finds the box carrying the bullets in the train missing and stand furious without knowing what to do next. On the day of the election, Mathews informs them that both the bullets and the people assigned to carry it have been missing. Mani reaches the booth and comes to know that an election candidate along with his goons had barged into the booth and had created a ruckus by [[Electoral fraud|vote rigging]]. He slaps a goon who tries to destroy the [[Electronic Voting Machines|EVM]] and asks the rest of them to clear out. Sometime later, they see the goons approaching in a larger number. Mani tells his team that they would have to conduct the election peacefully no matter any means with only the eight bullets left. Due to the shortage of ammunition he instructs his team to use their lathis and shields in which they are very much experienced. Mani and his team defeat the goons and successfully complete their election duty assigned to them. Beside some railway track, the box carrying the bullets which was lost and never reached is seen lying and a monkey keeps jumping over it.\n\n== Cast ==\n=== Main cast ===\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 175\n | footer    = Asif Ali (Top) and Vinay Forrt (Bottom) appeared in cameo roles in the film\n | image1    = Asif Ali Malayalam Actor.jpg\n | alt1      =\n | caption1  =\n | image2    = Vinay Forrt Actor.jpg\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n}}\n* [[Mammootty]] as [[Sub-inspector|S.

It reported that the unit, posted in an area with rampant [[Naxalite|Maoist]] activity, were not provided with sufficient ammunition. Rahman found a photograph showing a bunch of cops crammed into a tiny room, sleeping on the floor holding their rifles close to their chest, haunting. After realizing that the article had a film subject in it, Rahman met some of the police officers in person to develop the film's basic storyline. The film had to be set outside Kerala and required to be made on a large canvas, Rahman in the meantime worked on another film, ''[[Anuraga Karikkin Vellam]]'' (2016), which became his directorial debut. It was [[Anwar Rasheed]] who suggested Harshad to Rahman for writing ''Unda''\u2019s screenplay. In 2016, Rahman and Harshad started to write ''Unda''\u2019s screenplay. Initially, Harshad had developed a one-liner based on all the details collected by Rahman. Later, both of them along with cinematographer Jimshi and their assistants had traveled to [[Bastar district|Bastar]] to collect some more details.<ref name=\"Harshad interview\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.mediaonetv.in/interviews/2019/06/15/interview-with-mammootty-film-unda-screenplay-writer-harshad |last=\u0d39\u0d16\u0d4d |first=\u0d07\u0d1c\u0d3e\u0d38\u0d41\u0d32\u0d4d\u200d |date=16 June 2019 |work=[[MediaOne TV]] |access-date=23 July 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191013095303/https://www.mediaonetv.in/interviews/2019/06/15/interview-with-mammootty-film-unda-screenplay-writer-harshad |archive-date=13 October 2019 |language=ml |script-title=ml:\u0d0e\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d31\u0d46 \u0d38\u0d3f\u0d28\u0d3f\u0d2e\u0d2f\u0d3e\u0d23\u0d4d \u0d0e\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d31\u0d46 \u0d30\u0d3e\u0d37\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d30\u0d40\u0d2f\u0d02: \u0d39\u0d30\u0d4d\u0d37\u0d26\u0d4d |trans-title=My film is my politics: Harshad}}</ref><ref name=\"writer Harshad\" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.mathrubhumi.com/movies-music/news/mammootty-movie-unda-background-story-khalid-rahman-harshad-unda-malayalam-movie-1.3872091 |last=Mathrubhumi |date=14 June 2019 |work=[[Mathrubhumi]] |access-date=8 July 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191013095625/https://www.mathrubhumi.com/movies-music/news/mammootty-movie-unda-background-story-khalid-rahman-harshad-unda-malayalam-movie-1.3872091 |archive-date=13 October 2019 |language=ml |script-title=ml:'\u0d09\u0d23\u0d4d\u0d1f'\u0d2f\u0d3f\u0d32\u0d46 \u0d35\u0d3f\u0d32\u0d4d\u0d32\u0d28\u0d4d \u0d06\u0d30\u0d3e\u0d23\u0d4d? \u0d16\u0d3e\u0d32\u0d3f\u0d26\u0d4d \u0d31\u0d39\u0d4d\u0d2e\u0d3e\u0d28\u0d4d \u0d2a\u0d31\u0d1e\u0d4d\u0d1e\u0d24\u0d4d \u0d35\u0d46\u0d33\u0d3f\u0d2a\u0d4d\u0d2a\u0d46\u0d1f\u0d41\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3f \u0d24\u0d3f\u0d30\u0d15\u0d4d\u0d15\u0d25\u0d3e\u0d15\u0d43\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d4d |trans-title=Who is the villain in \u2018Unda\u2019?
