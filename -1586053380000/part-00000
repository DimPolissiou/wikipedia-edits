Being a primarily agricultural land, producing around 80 percent of the world's pineapples in the 1960s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdoa.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/HISTORY-OF-AGRICULTURE-IN-HAWAII.pdf|title=History of agriculture|date=2013|website=hdoa.hawaii.gov|format=PDF}}</ref> the addition of [[Pan Am]]\u2019s flight route to Hawaii rapidly increased the number of visitors going to the islands.

Inouye International Airport|Honolulu airport]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://time.com/3994194/hawaii-statehood-economic-effects/|title=How Statehood Changed Hawaii's Economy|website=Time}}</ref> As this trend continues to increase, Hawaii's economy has become heavily dependent on the tourism industry. Although the economy has seen significant growth with the addition of this industry, some researchers believe this will leave Hawaii susceptible to external [[economic forces]]. Some examples of these are an [[Recession|economic recession]], [[Strike action|airline strikes]], or varying fuel prices which could devastate the local economy.<ref name=\"wmich.edu\">{{cite web|url=https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1868&context=jssw|title=Info|website=scholarworks.wmich.edu}}</ref> The devastating [[Great Recession|national economic recession of 2008]], hit Hawaii's tourism industry hard.

On the other hand, the very creation of these institutions degrades the environmental factors tourists are drawn to.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://om.ciheam.org/om/pdf/a57/04001977.pdf |title=Data |website=om.ciheam.org |format=PDF}}</ref> Having perfect conditions requires an amount of upkeep fueled by the revenue of the visitors but the visitors also degrade the environment at a faster rate than residents alone.\n\nA direct effect of the increase in infrastructure is the depletion of the natural landscape. As buildings are constructed the amount of natural land becomes smaller and smaller. As hotels are constructed in prime real estate the environmental problems created are not weighed equally with the potential upside of profit.<ref name=\"lurj.org\" /> The government sees the creation of jobs and the increase in visitor spending in the state as a good thing. Those are quantitative variables that can be directly measured in terms of dollars and number of jobs. However, the impact to the environment or the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] people is harder to measure in term of absolutes. Hawaii only holds 0.2 percent of the United States land but has a 72.1 percent extinction rate, and more than half of the natural communities in the islands are endangered by developments.<ref name=\"wmich.edu\" /> An example of this is natural ponds being destroyed during construction of large buildings which were previously home to migrating birds. The ponds are no longer there, which throws off the natural flow of the [[ecosystem]]. Another staggering statistic says that nearly 60 percent of the plant and animal species in Hawaii are endangered.<ref name=\"lurj.org\" /> This includes the loss of habitats for animals and the diverse [[flora]] that gives Hawaii its beauty being degraded at an alarming rate.\n\n==== Energy ====\n{{main|Energy in Hawaii}}\nHawaii has traditionally relied on fossil fuel-fired thermal power plants for its electricity generation, although it has set a statewide goal of achieving 100% of electric generation via renewable sources by 2045;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=HI#tabs-4 |title=Hawaii State Profile and Energy Estimates |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref> as a result, the average guest uses the equivalent of {{convert|6.4|to|13|kg}} of oil per day, approximately {{frac|2|3}} of which is consumed by rental car operation.

This becomes a problem not only environmentally, but also could have a negative impact on the economy as visitors come for the sandy beaches and pollutants such as trash or plastics decrease the appeal of Hawaii as a vacation destination. [[Kamilo Beach]] on the southeastern tip of the island of Hawaii has acquired the nickname \"Plastic Beach\" for its accumulation of plastic trash, much of it borne via ocean currents and trade winds from the nearby [[Great Pacific garbage patch]]. It is estimated that {{convert|15|to|20|ST}} of trash, 96% of which is plastic, washes ashore here annually.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jan/10/kamilo-beach-plastic-hawaii-pollution |title=Welcome to Hawaii's 'plastic beach', one of the world's dirtiest places |author1=Barney, Liz |author2=Broder Van Dyke, Michelle |date=January 10, 2020 |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe average guest generates approximately {{convert|3.3|kg}} of waste per day.<ref name=Saito-13/> In order to reduce the generation of plastic waste, Hawaii has begun to ban the use of single-use plastic and polystyrene foam on a county-by-county approach.

The creation of this [[grassroots]] organization leads to a negative view towards visitors and the disruption of the natural land. This leads to a strong contention between developers and natives who believe the land should not be transformed into a commercial or residential development. Many of these individuals are reliant on the land as a means of living. The loss of the environment affects the socio-psychological well-being of those reliant on land and marine resources.<ref name=\"wmich.edu\" /> Native Hawaiians and residents alike become limited in job opportunities with a heavily skewed job-base in the tourism industry.<ref name=\"lurj.org\" />\n\nThe essay \"Lovely Hula Lands\" (later republished as \"Lovely Hula Hands\") by native Hawaiian academic and activist [[Haunani-Kay Trask]] is severely critical of the huge influx of tourists to Hawai{{okina}}i, which she terms a \"[[prostitution]]\" of Hawaiian culture.

Being a primarily agricultural land, producing around 80 percent of the world's pineapples in the 1960s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdoa.hawaii.gov/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/HISTORY-OF-AGRICULTURE-IN-HAWAII.pdf|title=History of agriculture|date=2013|website=hdoa.hawaii.gov|format=PDF}}</ref> the addition of [[Pan Am]]\u2019s flight route to Hawaii rapidly increased the number of visitors going to the islands.

Although the economy has seen significant growth with the addition of this industry, some researchers believe this will leave Hawaii susceptible to external [[economic forces]]. Some examples of these are an [[Recession|economic recession]], [[Strike action|airline strikes]], or varying fuel prices which could devastate the local economy.<ref name=\"wmich.edu\">{{cite web|url=https://scholarworks.wmich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1868&context=jssw|title=Info|website=scholarworks.wmich.edu}}</ref> The devastating [[Great Recession|national economic recession of 2008]], hit Hawaii's tourism industry hard.

As buildings are constructed the amount of natural land becomes smaller and smaller. As hotels are constructed in prime real estate the environmental problems created are not weighed equally with the potential upside of profit.<ref name=\"lurj.org\" /> The government sees the creation of jobs and the increase in visitor spending in the state as a good thing. Those are quantitative variables that can be directly measured in terms of dollars and number of jobs. However, the impact to the environment or the [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] people is harder to measure in term of absolutes. Hawaii only holds 0.2 percent of the United States land but has a 72.1 percent extinction rate, and more than half of the natural communities in the islands are endangered by developments.<ref name=\"wmich.edu\" /> An example of this is natural ponds being destroyed during construction of large buildings which were previously home to migrating birds. The ponds are no longer there, which throws off the natural flow of the [[ecosystem]]. Another staggering statistic says that nearly 60 percent of the plant and animal species in Hawaii are endangered.<ref name=\"lurj.org\" /> This includes the loss of habitats for animals and the diverse [[flora]] that gives Hawaii its beauty being degraded at an alarming rate.\n\n==== Energy ====\n{{main|Energy in Hawaii}}\nHawaii has traditionally relied on fossil fuel-fired thermal power plants for its electricity generation, although it has set a statewide goal of achieving 100% of electric generation via renewable sources by 2045;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/state/?sid=HI#tabs-4 |title=Hawaii State Profile and Energy Estimates |publisher=U.S. Energy Information Administration |accessdate=24 February 2020}}</ref> as a result, the average guest uses the equivalent of {{convert|6.4|to|13|kg}} of oil per day, approximately {{frac|2|3}} of which is consumed by rental car operation.

This becomes a problem not only environmentally, but also could have a negative impact on the economy as visitors come for the sandy beaches and pollutants such as trash or plastics decrease the appeal of Hawaii as a vacation destination. [[Kamilo Beach]] on the southeastern tip of the island of Hawaii has acquired the nickname \"Plastic Beach\" for its accumulation of plastic trash, much of it borne via ocean currents and trade winds from the nearby [[Great Pacific garbage patch]].

The creation of this [[grassroots]] organization leads to a negative view towards visitors and the disruption of the natural land. This leads to a strong contention between developers and natives who believe the land should not be transformed into a commercial or residential development. Many of these individuals are reliant on the land as a means of living. The loss of the environment affects the socio-psychological well-being of those reliant on land and marine resources.<ref name=\"wmich.edu\" /> Native Hawaiians and residents alike become limited in job opportunities with a heavily skewed job-base in the tourism industry.<ref name=\"lurj.org\" />\n\nThe essay \"Lovely Hula Lands\" (later republished as \"Lovely Hula Hands\") by native Hawaiian academic and activist [[Haunani-Kay Trask]] is severely critical of the huge influx of tourists to Hawai{{okina}}i, which she terms a \"[[prostitution]]\" of Hawaiian culture.

It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Jam & Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]]. She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of Sherman Klump, one of many characters portrayed by Murphy. Jackson received a minimum upfront payment of three million dollars for accepting the role, and an additional one million to record the movie's theme.<ref name=\"Daily\" />\n\nThe song's initial concept was based on a lyric draft Jackson had written and discovered, which she thought would be suitable for the film's theme. She stated \"it really tells you about the movie and how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior. His heart, his soul, that really matters to me. That's what I'm in love with, that's what matters to me the most, and it doesn't matter what other people say.\"<ref name=\"Making\" /> Following its release, Jackson felt that it was \"fun\" and \"a good summer song\".<ref name=\"Interview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.girl.com.au/janetjackson.htm |title=Janet Jackson \u2013 June 2001 |work=Girl.com.au |author=Gamboa, Glenn |access-date=February 7, 2014}}</ref> She initially felt unsure of how the song would fare, but was pleased with its success.<ref name=\"Interview\" /> An [[Audio mastering|unmastered]] version [[internet leak|leaked]] and received airplay ahead of its scheduled release, followed by a positive response from critics and fans.

It was based on an incomplete poem Jackson had written, which was later applied to her character in the film. The song was a contrast from the dark tone of prior album ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'', returning to a brighter and more contemporary sound.\n\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" received positive reception, called \"impossibly catchy\" and \"classic pop\". It became Jackson's ninth number-one single in the United States and stayed atop the chart for three weeks. It was Jackson's twenty-first single to be certified, which ranked her as the second female artist with the most certified singles. The single fared well internationally, reaching number five in the United Kingdom, and peaking within the top-ten in Italy and Denmark. It attained a silver certification in the United Kingdom, and allowed Jam and Lewis to receive a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Producer of the Year]]. The song was later included in two of Jackson's greatest hits collections, ''[[Number Ones (Janet Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'' and ''[[Icon: Number Ones]]''.\n\nThe [[music video]], directed by [[Joseph Kahn]], resembles an [[abstract art|abstract]], futuristic environment based on Japanese culture. In addition to clips from the movie, it features advanced technology, morphing clothes, and a dance sequence on a levitating platform. The video had a reported cost of over $2.5 million, being one of the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music videos]] of all time. Its accolades include \"Outstanding Music Video\" and \"Most Stylish Music Video\" at the [[VH1]] Fashion Awards. The song was performed on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' and the [[2000 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]], the latter regarded as one of the leading performances of Jackson's career.\n\nA slightly modified version of the song appeared on Jackson's seventh [[album]] ''[[All for You (Janet Jackson album)|All for You]]''. \"Doesn't Really Matter\" was considered to influence music videos from [[Britney Spears]], [[Jessica Simpson]] and [[Cassie (singer)|Cassie]]. The video was the first by director Joseph Kahn to feature Japanese themes and imagery, which he later used frequently following its popularity. Actress [[Jenna Dewan]] made one of her debut appearances in the video, crediting Jackson for the experience and platform to star in the dance film ''[[Step Up (film)|Step Up]]''. [[Rihanna]]'s \"Watch n' Learn\" was likened to the song, and it was also covered by Japanese singer [[Hitomi Shimatani]] as \"Papillon\".\n\n==Background==\n\"Doesn't Really Matter\" was written and produced by [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Jam & Lewis]] as the theme for the [[Universal Pictures]] film ''[[Nutty Professor II: The Klumps]]'', starring Jackson and actor [[Eddie Murphy]]. She portrays Professor Denise Gaines in the film, the love interest of Sherman Klump, one of many characters portrayed by Murphy. Jackson received a minimum upfront payment of three million dollars for accepting the role, and an additional one million to record the movie's theme.<ref name=\"Daily\" />\n\nThe song's initial concept was based on a lyric draft Jackson had written and discovered, which she thought would be suitable for the film's theme. She stated \"it really tells you about the movie and how it doesn't matter what is on the exterior, but the interior. His heart, his soul, that really matters to me. That's what I'm in love with, that's what matters to me the most, and it doesn't matter what other people say.\"<ref name=\"Making\" /> Following its release, Jackson felt that it was \"fun\" and \"a good summer song\".<ref name=\"Interview\">{{cite web |url=http://www.girl.com.au/janetjackson.htm |title=Janet Jackson \u2013 June 2001 |work=Girl.com.au |author=Gamboa, Glenn |access-date=February 7, 2014}}</ref> She initially felt unsure of how the song would fare, but was pleased with its success.<ref name=\"Interview\" /> An [[Audio mastering|unmastered]] version [[internet leak|leaked]] and received airplay ahead of its scheduled release, followed by a positive response from critics and fans.
