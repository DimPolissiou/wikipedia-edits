He was the fifth and youngest child of Nechama \"Naomi\" (n\u00e9e Cantor, c. 1858\u20131895) and Moses Rubin Yoelson (c. 1858\u20131945); his four siblings were Rose (c. 1879\u20131939), Etta (c. 1880\u20131948), another sister who died in infancy, and Hirsch (Harry) (c. 1882\u20131953).

By 1894, Moses Yoelson could afford to pay the fare to bring Nechama and their four children to the U.S. By the time they arrived\u2014as steerage passengers on the SS ''Umbria'' arriving at the Port of New York on April 9, 1894\u2014he had found work as a cantor at [[Ohev Sholom - The National Synagogue|Talmud Torah Congregation]] in the [[Southwest Waterfront]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C., where the family was reunited.<ref name=\"Freedland\" />{{rp|21\u201322}}\n\nJolson's mother, Naomi, died at 37 in early 1895, and he was in a state of withdrawal for seven months.

After being introduced to show business in 1895 by [[Al Reeves]], Jolson and Hirsch became fascinated by it, and by 1897 the brothers were singing for coins on local street corners, using the names \"Al\" and \"Harry\".

The audience, transformed into what one critic called, 'a milling, battling mob' stood, stamped, and cheered 'Jolson, Jolson, Jolson!'\"<ref>Eyman, p. 140.</ref>\n\nVitaphone was intended for musical renditions, and ''The Jazz Singer'' follows this principle, with only the musical sequences using live sound recording. The moviegoers were electrified when the silent actions were interrupted periodically for a song sequence with real singing and sound.

Frenchy got on the phone to California, spoke to someone connected with the film and the next thing I knew the band and I were booked into Chicago on our way to California for the film, ''The Singing Kid''. We had a hell of a time, although I had some pretty rough arguments with Harold Arlen, who had written the music. Arlen was the songwriter for many of the finest Cotton Club revues, but he had done some interpretations for ''The Singing Kid'' that I just couldn't go along with. He was trying to change my style and I was fighting it. Finally, Jolson stepped in and said to Arlen, 'Look, Cab knows what he wants to do; let him do it his way.' After that, Arlen left me alone. And talk about integration: Hell, when the band and I got out to Hollywood, we were treated like pure royalty. Here were Jolson and I living in adjacent penthouses in a very plush hotel.

To him, the film seems to imply an inclination of white performers, like Jolson, who are possessed with \"the joy of life and enough sensitivity, to appreciate the musical accomplishments of blacks\".<ref>Gabbard, Krin. ''Jammin' at the Margins'' (1996), University of Chicago Press, p. 53.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> To support his view he describes a significant part of the movie:\n{{quote|While wandering around New Orleans before a show with Dockstader's Minstrels, he enters a small club where a group of black jazz musicians are performing. Jolson has a revelation, that the staid repertoire of the minstrel troupe can be transformed by actually playing black music in blackface. He tells Dockstader that he wants to sing what he has just experienced: 'I heard some music tonight, something they call jazz. Some fellows just make it up as they go along. They pick it up out of the air.' After Dockstader refuses to accommodate Jolson's revolutionary concept, the narrative chronicles his climb to stardom as he allegedly injects jazz into his blackface performances.... Jolson's success is built on anticipating what Americans really want. Dockstader performs the inevitable function of the guardian of the status quo, whose hidebound commitment to what is about to become obsolete reinforces the audience's sympathy with the forward-looking hero.<ref name=Gabbard54>Gabbard, Krin.

His own 1930s shows included ''Presenting Al Jolson'' (1932) and ''[[Shell Chateau]]'' (1935), and he was the host of the ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'' from 1947 to 1949, with [[Oscar Levant]] as a sardonic, piano-playing sidekick. Jolson's 1940s career revival was nothing short of a success despite the competition of younger performers such as [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], and he was voted the \"Most Popular Male Vocalist\" in 1948 by a poll in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. The next year, Jolson was named \"Personality of the Year\" by the [[Variety Club]]s of America. When Jolson appeared on Bing Crosby's radio show, he attributed his receiving the award to his being the only singer of any importance not to make a record of \"[[Mule Train]]\", which had been a widely covered hit of that year (four different versions, one of them by Crosby, had made the top ten on the charts). Jolson joked about how his voice had deepened with age, saying \"I got the clippetys all right, but I can't clop like I used to.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn addition to his contribution to motion pictures as a performer, he is responsible for the discovery of two major stars of the golden age of Hollywood. He purchased the rights to a play he saw on Broadway and then sold the movie rights to Jack Warner (Warner Brothers which was the studio that had made ''The Jazz Singer'') with the stipulation that two of the original cast members reprise their roles in the movie. The play became the movie titled \"Penny Arcade\". Those actors were Joan Blondell and James Cagney. They both went on to become contract players for the studio. The two were major ingredients in gangster movies which were quite lucrative for the studio.\n\nCagney won his Academy Award for his role in Warner Brothers' \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" which at the time was the studio's highest-grossing movie. The award is rarely given to performers in musicals. Ironically Cagney who became known for his tough guy movie roles also made a contribution to movie musicals like the man who had discovered him. While Jolson is credited for appearing in the first movie musical, Cagney's Academy Award-winning movie was the first movie Ted Turner chose to colorize.\n\nWhen Jolson appeared on [[Steve Allen]]'s [[KNX (AM)|KNX]] Los Angeles radio show in 1949 to promote ''Jolson Sings Again'', he offered his curt opinion of the burgeoning television industry: \"I call it smell-evision.\" Writer Hal Kanter recalled that Jolson's own idea of his television debut would be a corporate-sponsored, extra-length spectacular that would feature him as the only performer, and would be telecast without interruption. Even though he had several TV offers at the time, Jolson was apprehensive about how his larger than life performances would come across in a medium as intimate as television. He finally relented in 1950, when it was announced that Jolson had signed an agreement to appear on the CBS television network, presumably in a series of specials. However, he died suddenly before production began.<ref>Freedland, Michael ''Jolson'' (1972), Stein and Day p. 234.

He was the fifth and youngest child of Nechama \"Naomi\" (n\u00e9e Cantor, c. 1858\u20131895) and Moses Rubin Yoelson (c. 1858\u20131945); his four siblings were Rose (c. 1879\u20131939), Etta (c. 1880\u20131948), another sister who died in infancy, and Hirsch (Harry) (c. 1882\u20131953). Jolson did not know his date of birth, as birth records were not kept at that time in that region, and he gave his birth year as 1885.<ref>The 1885 dates were given in a 1914 passenger list while traveling with his then wife Henrietta, where his first name is given as Alexander and in the 1925 New York state census and later as 1886.</ref><ref name=\"Freedland\">{{cite book |last1=Freedland |first1=Michael |title=Al Jolson |publisher=W.H.

By 1894, Moses Yoelson could afford to pay the fare to bring Nechama and their four children to the U.S. By the time they arrived\u2014as steerage passengers on the SS ''Umbria'' arriving at the Port of New York on April 9, 1894\u2014he had found work as a cantor at [[Ohev Sholom - The National Synagogue|Talmud Torah Congregation]] in the [[Southwest Waterfront]] neighborhood of Washington, D.C., where the family was reunited.<ref name=\"Freedland\" />{{rp|21\u201322}}\n\nJolson's mother, Naomi, died at 37 in early 1895, and he was in a state of withdrawal for seven months. He spent time at the [[Cardinal Gibbons School|St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys]], a progressive reformatory/home for orphans run by the [[Xaverian Brothers]] in Baltimore (the same school which would later be attended by [[Babe Ruth]]). After being introduced to show business in 1895 by [[Al Reeves]], Jolson and Hirsch became fascinated by it, and by 1897 the brothers were singing for coins on local street corners, using the names \"Al\" and \"Harry\".

In May 1903, the head producer of the [[American burlesque|burlesque]] show ''Dainty Duchess Burlesquers'' agreed to give Jolson a part in one show. He performed \"Be My Baby Bumble Bee\", and the producer agreed to keep him, but the show closed by the end of the year.

Harry had refused his request to take care of Joe Palmer, who was in a wheelchair. After Harry's departure, Jolson and Palmer worked as a duo but were not particularly successful. By 1906<ref name=JolyM /> they agreed to separate, and Jolson was on his own.{{sfn|Oberfirst|1980|pp=68\u201370}} He became a regular at the Globe and Wigwam Theater in San Francisco and was successful nationwide as a vaudeville singer.<ref name=JolyM /> He took up residence in San Francisco, saying the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|earthquake]]-devastated people needed someone to cheer them up.

In 1909, his singing caught the attention of [[Lew Dockstader]], the producer and star of Dockstader's Minstrels.

''La Belle Paree'' helped start his career as a singer. Opening night drew a large crowd, and became popular with the audience by [[Stephen Foster]] songs in blackface. He was given a position in the show's cast. The show closed after 104 performances. After ''La Belle Paree'', he accepted an offer to perform in the musical ''[[Vera Violetta]]'' which opened on November&nbsp;20, 1911, and like ''La Belle Paree'' it was a success. In the show, he again sang in blackface and became so popular that his weekly salary of $500 (based on his success in ''La Belle Paree'') was increased to $750.{{sfn|Oberfirst|1980|pp=98\u2013117}}\n\nAfter ''Vera Violetta'' closed, Jolson starred in another musical, ''The Whirl of Society'', propelling his career on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] to new heights. During his time at the Winter Garden, Jolson told the audience, \"You ain't heard nothing yet\" before performing additional songs. In the play, he debuted his signature blackface character \"Gus.\"<ref name=JolyM /> Winter Garden owner [[Lee Shubert]] signed Jolson to a seven-year contract with a salary of $1,000 a week. Jolson reprised his role as \"Gus\" in future plays and by 1914 achieved so much popularity with theater audiences that his $1,000-a-week salary was doubled. In 1916, ''[[Robinson Crusoe, Jr.]]'' was the first musical in which he was the star.

Jessel never got over it and often said that Warner gave the role to Jolson because he agreed to help finance the film.\n\n[[Harry Warner]]'s daughter, Doris, remembered the opening night, and said that when the picture started she was still crying over the loss of her beloved uncle Sam. He was planning to be at the performance but died suddenly at the age of 40, the day before. But halfway through the 89-minute movie she began to be overtaken by a sense that something remarkable was happening. Jolson's \"Wait a minute\" line provoked shouts of pleasure and applause from the audience, who were dumbfounded by seeing and hearing someone speak on a film for the first time. So much so that the double-entendre was missed at first. After each Jolson song, the audience applauded. Excitement mounted as the film progressed, and when Jolson began his scene with [[Eugenie Besserer]], \"the audience became hysterical.\"<ref name=Eyman>Eyman, Scott.

The tumultuous ovation at curtain proved that Jolson was not merely the right man for the part of Jackie Rabinowitz, alias Jack Robin; he was the right man for the entire transition from silent fantasy to talking realism. The audience, transformed into what one critic called, 'a milling, battling mob' stood, stamped, and cheered 'Jolson, Jolson, Jolson!'\"<ref>Eyman, p. 140.</ref>\n\nVitaphone was intended for musical renditions, and ''The Jazz Singer'' follows this principle, with only the musical sequences using live sound recording. The moviegoers were electrified when the silent actions were interrupted periodically for a song sequence with real singing and sound. Jolson's dynamic voice, physical mannerisms, and charisma held the audience spellbound. Costar [[May McAvoy]], according to author A. Scott Berg, could not help sneaking into theaters day after day as the film was being run. \"She pinned herself against a wall in the dark and watched the faces in the crowd.

We had a hell of a time, although I had some pretty rough arguments with Harold Arlen, who had written the music. Arlen was the songwriter for many of the finest Cotton Club revues, but he had done some interpretations for ''The Singing Kid'' that I just couldn't go along with. He was trying to change my style and I was fighting it. Finally, Jolson stepped in and said to Arlen, 'Look, Cab knows what he wants to do; let him do it his way.' After that, Arlen left me alone. And talk about integration: Hell, when the band and I got out to Hollywood, we were treated like pure royalty. Here were Jolson and I living in adjacent penthouses in a very plush hotel.

To him, the film seems to imply an inclination of white performers, like Jolson, who are possessed with \"the joy of life and enough sensitivity, to appreciate the musical accomplishments of blacks\".<ref>Gabbard, Krin. ''Jammin' at the Margins'' (1996), University of Chicago Press, p. 53.<!-- ISBN needed --></ref> To support his view he describes a significant part of the movie:\n{{quote|While wandering around New Orleans before a show with Dockstader's Minstrels, he enters a small club where a group of black jazz musicians are performing. Jolson has a revelation, that the staid repertoire of the minstrel troupe can be transformed by actually playing black music in blackface. He tells Dockstader that he wants to sing what he has just experienced: 'I heard some music tonight, something they call jazz. Some fellows just make it up as they go along. They pick it up out of the air.' After Dockstader refuses to accommodate Jolson's revolutionary concept, the narrative chronicles his climb to stardom as he allegedly injects jazz into his blackface performances.... Jolson's success is built on anticipating what Americans really want. Dockstader performs the inevitable function of the guardian of the status quo, whose hidebound commitment to what is about to become obsolete reinforces the audience's sympathy with the forward-looking hero.<ref name=Gabbard54>Gabbard, Krin.

His own 1930s shows included ''Presenting Al Jolson'' (1932) and ''[[Shell Chateau]]'' (1935), and he was the host of the ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]'' from 1947 to 1949, with [[Oscar Levant]] as a sardonic, piano-playing sidekick. Jolson's 1940s career revival was nothing short of a success despite the competition of younger performers such as [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], and he was voted the \"Most Popular Male Vocalist\" in 1948 by a poll in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. The next year, Jolson was named \"Personality of the Year\" by the [[Variety Club]]s of America. When Jolson appeared on Bing Crosby's radio show, he attributed his receiving the award to his being the only singer of any importance not to make a record of \"[[Mule Train]]\", which had been a widely covered hit of that year (four different versions, one of them by Crosby, had made the top ten on the charts). Jolson joked about how his voice had deepened with age, saying \"I got the clippetys all right, but I can't clop like I used to.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}\n\nIn addition to his contribution to motion pictures as a performer, he is responsible for the discovery of two major stars of the golden age of Hollywood. He purchased the rights to a play he saw on Broadway and then sold the movie rights to Jack Warner (Warner Brothers which was the studio that had made ''The Jazz Singer'') with the stipulation that two of the original cast members reprise their roles in the movie. The play became the movie titled \"Penny Arcade\". Those actors were Joan Blondell and James Cagney. They both went on to become contract players for the studio. The two were major ingredients in gangster movies which were quite lucrative for the studio.\n\nCagney won his Academy Award for his role in Warner Brothers' \"Yankee Doodle Dandy\" which at the time was the studio's highest-grossing movie. The award is rarely given to performers in musicals. Ironically Cagney who became known for his tough guy movie roles also made a contribution to movie musicals like the man who had discovered him. While Jolson is credited for appearing in the first movie musical, Cagney's Academy Award-winning movie was the first movie Ted Turner chose to colorize.\n\nWhen Jolson appeared on [[Steve Allen]]'s [[KNX (AM)|KNX]] Los Angeles radio show in 1949 to promote ''Jolson Sings Again'', he offered his curt opinion of the burgeoning television industry: \"I call it smell-evision.\" Writer Hal Kanter recalled that Jolson's own idea of his television debut would be a corporate-sponsored, extra-length spectacular that would feature him as the only performer, and would be telecast without interruption. Even though he had several TV offers at the time, Jolson was apprehensive about how his larger than life performances would come across in a medium as intimate as television. He finally relented in 1950, when it was announced that Jolson had signed an agreement to appear on the CBS television network, presumably in a series of specials. However, he died suddenly before production began.<ref>Freedland, Michael ''Jolson'' (1972), Stein and Day p. 234.

Jolson's first film, ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', for instance, is described by historian [[Michael Alexander (academic)|Michael Alexander]] as an expression of the [[liturgy|liturgical]] music of Jews with the \"imagined music of African Americans,\" noting that \"prayer and jazz become metaphors for Jews and blacks.\" <ref name=\"Alexander, Michael 2003 p. 176\">Alexander, Michael. ''Jazz Age Jews'', Princeton University Press (2003), p. 176.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed --></ref> Playwright [[Samson Raphaelson]], after seeing Jolson perform his stage show ''Robinson Crusoe'', stated that \"he had an epiphany: 'My God, this isn't a jazz singer', he said.

''Encyclopedia of American Jewish History'', ABC-CLIO, Inc. (2008), p. 502.<!-- ISBN/ISSN needed --></ref>\n\nUpon the film's release, the first full-length sound picture, film reviewers saw the symbolism and metaphors portrayed by Jolson in his role as the son of a cantor wanting to become a \"jazz singer\":\n{{quote|Is there any incongruity in this Jewish boy with his face painted like a Southern Negro singing in the Negro dialect? No, there is not. Indeed, I detected again and again the minor key of Jewish music, the wail of the [[Chazan]], the cry of anguish of a people who had suffered. The son of a line of rabbis well knows how to sing the songs of the most cruelly wronged people in the world's history.<ref name=Norwood/>}}\n\nAccording to Alexander, Eastern European Jews were uniquely qualified to understand the music, noting how Jolson himself made the comparison of Jewish and African-American suffering in a new land in his film ''Big Boy'': In a blackface portrayal of a former slave, he leads a group of recently freed slaves, played by black actors, in verses of the classic slave spiritual \"[[Go Down Moses]]\". One reviewer of the film expressed how Jolson's blackface added significance to his role:{{quote|When one hears Jolson's jazz songs, one realizes that jazz is the new prayer of the American masses, and Al Jolson is their cantor. The Negro makeup in which he expresses his misery is the appropriate [[tallit|talis]] [prayer shawl] for such a communal leader.<ref name=\"Alexander, Michael 2003 p. 176\"/>}}\n\nMany in the black community welcomed ''The Jazz Singer'' and saw it as a vehicle to gain access to the stage. Audiences at Harlem's Lafayette Theater cried during the film, and Harlem's newspaper, ''Amsterdam News'', called it \"one of the greatest pictures ever produced.\" For Jolson, it wrote: \"Every colored performer is proud of him.\"<ref>Rogin, Michael.

He enjoyed singing jazz, often performing in blackface, especially in the songs he made popular such as \"[[Swanee (song)|Swanee]]\", \"[[My Mammy]]\", and \"[[Rock-a-Bye Your Baby with a Dixie Melody]]\".\n\nAs a Jewish immigrant and America's most famous and highest-paid entertainer, he may have had the incentive and resources to help improve racial attitudes. While ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' glorified white supremacy and the KKK, Jolson chose to star in ''The Jazz Singer'', which defied racial bigotry by introducing black musicians to audiences worldwide.<ref name=PBS/>\n\nWhile growing up, Jolson had many black friends, including [[Bill Robinson|Bill \"Bojangles\" Robinson]], who became a prominent [[tap dancer]].<ref name=Digest/> As early as 1911, at the age of 25, Jolson was noted for fighting discrimination on Broadway and later in his movies.<ref name=blackstar/> He promoted a play by [[Garland Anderson (playwright)|Garland Anderson]]<ref name=\"Hill\">{{cite web |last1=Hill |first1=Anthony Duane |title=Anderson, Garland (1886-1939) |url=http://www.blackpast.org/aah/anderson-garland-1886-1939 |website=Blackpast.org |accessdate=22 September 2018 |date=2007-10-24 }}</ref> which became the first production with an all-black cast produced on Broadway.

The small peninsula is isolated from the rest of Moloka{{okina}}i by cliffs over a quarter-mile high&mdash;the only land access is a [[mule]] trail.\n\nBecause of the small population, Kalawao County does not have the functions of other Hawaii counties. Instead, it is a judicial district of [[Maui County, Hawaii|Maui County]], which includes the rest of the island of Moloka{{okina}}i. The county has no elected government.\n\nIt was developed and used from 1866 to 1969 for settlements for treatment of quarantined persons with [[Hansen's disease]] (leprosy).\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nThe [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]], the [[Republic of Hawaii|Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i]], the [[Territory of Hawaii|territory]], and the state of Hawaii exiled persons suffering from [[Hansen's disease]] to the peninsula, from 1866 to 1969. The [[quarantine]] policy was lifted after effective [[Antibiotics|antibiotic]] treatments were developed that could be administered on an outpatient basis and patients could be rendered non-contagious.\n\nMany of the residents chose to remain on the peninsula, as they believed their disfigurements from the illness would make reintegration into society impossible. The state promised that they could live there for the rest of their lives. No new patients, or other permanent residents, were later admitted. Visitors are permitted only as part of official tours. State law prohibits anyone under the age of 16 from visiting or living there, although exceptions have been made for children visiting their relatives.\n\nThe [[Kalaupapa National Historical Park]] was established to preserve the county's history and environment. It is coterminous with the boundaries of Kalawao County.\n\n==Government==\nKalawao County lacks a local, county government. Instead, Kalawao County is administered by the [[Hawaii Department of Health]] because of the history of the settlement and current patients living there. Under Hawaiian state law, the Director of the Hawaii Department of Health, who is appointed by the [[Governor of Hawaii|Governor]], also serves as the [[Mayor of Kalawao County]].<ref name=hadvertiser>{{cite news|first=Robbie|last=Dingeman|title=Smallest county to ban smoking |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Oct/31/ln/ln22a.html |work=[[Honolulu Advertiser]] |date=2002-10-31 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref><ref name=time>{{cite news|first=Nate|last=Rawlings|title=Hawaii Official Killed in Plane Crash |url=http://nation.time.com/2013/12/12/hawaii-official-killed-in-plane-crash/ |work=[[Time Magazine]] |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref><ref name=khon>{{cite news |first=Kristine |last=Uyeno |title=Hawaii Official Killed in Plane Crash |url=http://www.khon2.com/news/loretta-fuddy-committed-to-serving-others |work=[[KHON-TV|KHON]] |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104142321/http://www.khon2.com/news/loretta-fuddy-committed-to-serving-others |archivedate=2014-01-04 }}</ref><ref name=hsa>{{cite news |first=Gregg K. |last=Kakesako |title=Pilot described 'catastrophic engine failure' in Molokai crash |url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/235590541.html?id=235590541 |work=[[Honolulu Star Advertiser]] |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2014-01-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221154659/http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/235590541.html?id=235590541 |archivedate=2013-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The Mayor holds executive powers within the county; the mayor also appoints a county [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], who is selected from local residents.<ref name=\"doh\">{{cite web |url=http://hawaii.gov/health/about/doh-info.html |title=Department of Health Administrative Offices |publisher=State of Hawai\u02bbi |accessdate=2010-09-28}}</ref> The only county statutes that apply to Kalawao County directly are those on matters of health.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.hawaii.edu/uham/counties.html|title=Hawaii's 4 (or 5) Counties|accessdate=2014-01-22}}</ref>\n\nKalawao is part of the First Judicial Circuit, which includes the entire island of [[Oahu]].<ref>\"The Judiciary - State of Hawaii - Annual Report - July 1, 1986 to June 30, 1987\". p16 and p26. https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/109520NCJRS.pdf</ref> For the purpose of notarization, the designated venue for the First Judicial Circuit is \"State of Hawaii, City and County of Honolulu.\"\n\n==Geography==\nKalawao County is included in the [[Kahului, Hawaii|Kahului]]-[[Wailuku, Hawaii|Wailuku]]-[[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]], HI [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|53|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|12|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|41|sqmi}} (77.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020527061848/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|archive-date=2002-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> By land area, it is the [[County statistics of the United States#Smallest counties by land area nationwide|smallest true county in the United States]]; [[Falls Church, Virginia]] is smaller, but is an [[independent city]] with county-level governance and is not a county or part of one.\n\n===Kalaupapa Peninsula===\nKalaupapa Peninsula contains the county's only settlement, [[Kalaupapa, Hawaii|Kalaupapa]].

The small peninsula is isolated from the rest of Moloka{{okina}}i by cliffs over a quarter-mile high&mdash;the only land access is a [[mule]] trail.\n\nBecause of the small population, Kalawao County does not have the functions of other Hawaii counties. Instead, it is a judicial district of [[Maui County, Hawaii|Maui County]], which includes the rest of the island of Moloka{{okina}}i. The county has no elected government.\n\nIt was developed and used from 1866 to 1969 for settlements for treatment of quarantined persons with [[Hansen's disease]] (leprosy).\n\n==History==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}\nThe [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Kingdom of Hawai{{okina}}i]], the [[Republic of Hawaii|Republic of Hawai{{okina}}i]], the [[Territory of Hawaii|territory]], and the state of Hawaii exiled persons suffering from [[Hansen's disease]] to the peninsula, from 1866 to 1969. The [[quarantine]] policy was lifted after effective [[Antibiotics|antibiotic]] treatments were developed that could be administered on an outpatient basis and patients could be rendered non-contagious.\n\nMany of the residents chose to remain on the peninsula, as they believed their disfigurements from the illness would make reintegration into society impossible. The state promised that they could live there for the rest of their lives. No new patients, or other permanent residents, were later admitted. Visitors are permitted only as part of official tours. State law prohibits anyone under the age of 16 from visiting or living there, although exceptions have been made for children visiting their relatives.\n\nThe [[Kalaupapa National Historical Park]] was established to preserve the county's history and environment. It is coterminous with the boundaries of Kalawao County.\n\n==Government==\nKalawao County lacks a local, county government. Instead, Kalawao County is administered by the [[Hawaii Department of Health]] because of the history of the settlement and current patients living there. Under Hawaiian state law, the Director of the Hawaii Department of Health, who is appointed by the [[Governor of Hawaii|Governor]], also serves as the [[Mayor of Kalawao County]].<ref name=hadvertiser>{{cite news|first=Robbie|last=Dingeman|title=Smallest county to ban smoking |url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Oct/31/ln/ln22a.html |work=[[Honolulu Advertiser]] |date=2002-10-31 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref><ref name=time>{{cite news|first=Nate|last=Rawlings|title=Hawaii Official Killed in Plane Crash |url=http://nation.time.com/2013/12/12/hawaii-official-killed-in-plane-crash/ |work=[[Time Magazine]] |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2014-01-02}}</ref><ref name=khon>{{cite news |first=Kristine |last=Uyeno |title=Hawaii Official Killed in Plane Crash |url=http://www.khon2.com/news/loretta-fuddy-committed-to-serving-others |work=[[KHON-TV|KHON]] |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2014-01-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104142321/http://www.khon2.com/news/loretta-fuddy-committed-to-serving-others |archivedate=2014-01-04 }}</ref><ref name=hsa>{{cite news |first=Gregg K. |last=Kakesako |title=Pilot described 'catastrophic engine failure' in Molokai crash |url=http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/235590541.html?id=235590541 |work=[[Honolulu Star Advertiser]] |date=2013-12-12 |accessdate=2014-01-02 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221154659/http://www.staradvertiser.com/news/breaking/235590541.html?id=235590541 |archivedate=2013-12-21 |url-status=live }}</ref>  The Mayor holds executive powers within the county; the mayor also appoints a county [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], who is selected from local residents.<ref name=\"doh\">{{cite web |url=http://hawaii.gov/health/about/doh-info.html |title=Department of Health Administrative Offices |publisher=State of Hawai\u02bbi |accessdate=2010-09-28}}</ref> The only county statutes that apply to Kalawao County directly are those on matters of health.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.hawaii.edu/uham/counties.html|title=Hawaii's 4 (or 5) Counties|accessdate=2014-01-22}}</ref>\n\nKalawao is part of the First Judicial Circuit, which includes the entire island of [[Oahu]].<ref>\"The Judiciary - State of Hawaii - Annual Report - July 1, 1986 to June 30, 1987\". p16 and p26. https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/109520NCJRS.pdf</ref> For the purpose of notarization, the designated venue for the First Judicial Circuit is \"State of Hawaii, City and County of Honolulu.\"\n\n==Geography==\nKalawao County is included in the [[Kahului, Hawaii|Kahului]]-[[Wailuku, Hawaii|Wailuku]]-[[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]], HI [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]].\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|53|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|12|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|41|sqmi}} (77.3%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020527061848/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/gazette.html|archive-date=2002-05-27|url-status=dead}}</ref> By land area, it is the [[County statistics of the United States#Smallest counties by land area nationwide|smallest true county in the United States]]; [[Falls Church, Virginia]] is smaller, but is an [[independent city]] with county-level governance and is not a county or part of one.\n\n===Kalaupapa Peninsula===\nKalaupapa Peninsula contains the county's only settlement, [[Kalaupapa, Hawaii|Kalaupapa]].
