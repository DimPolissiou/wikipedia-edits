Her media career began in 1980 with the radio show ''Sexually Speaking'', which continued until 1990. She has hosted several series on the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] Channel and other [[cable television]] networks from 1984 to 1993 and is the author of 45 books on sex and sexuality.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWestheimer was born '''Karola Ruth Siegel''' on June 4, 1928, in Wiesenfeld (now part of [[Karlstadt am Main]]), [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], the only child of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], Irma (n\u00e9e Hanauer), a housekeeper, and Julius Siegel, a [[Notions (sewing)|notions]] wholesaler and son of the family for whom Irma worked.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/westheimer-ruth|title=Ruth Westheimer|publisher=JWA.org|date=March 1, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2016}}</ref> She was given an early grounding in [[Judaism]] by her father, who took her regularly to the synagogue in the [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]] district of [[Frankfurt]], where they lived. Her father was taken away by the Nazis a week after [[Kristallnacht]], or the Night of Broken Glass, in 1938. Westheimer cried while her father was taken away by men in gloss-finished boots, while her grandmother gave the men money and asked them to care for him. Westheimer's mother and grandmother decided that Germany was too dangerous due to the tension and Nazi violence growing, so in January 1939 they sent Westheimer on a \"[[Kindertransport|Kinder Transport]],\" a transport taking Jewish children going to Switzerland. 11-year-old Westheimer arrived at an orphanage of a Jewish charity in [[Heiden, Switzerland]], and took on the role of a caregiver and mother-like figure to the younger children there. Westheimer was not allowed to take classes at the local school, but a fellow orphan boy would sneak his textbooks to Westheimer at night so she could learn and continue her education.\n\nWhile at the orphanage, Westheimer corresponded with her mother and grandmother via letters. When the letters ceased in 1941, Westheimer knew she would not hear from them again. The details of her parents' deaths due to the Holocaust are also included in the Hulu documentary about Westheimer titled \"Ask Dr. Ruth\". Her father was killed in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] concentration camp in 1942. Her mother was killed during the Holocaust, but there is no specific information about her death, or about how and when she died. In the data base at the [[Yad Vashem]] World Holocaust Remembrance Center, Westheimer's mother is categorized by the word ''verschollen'' or 'disappeared.'\n\nWestheimer decided to emigrate to British-controlled [[Mandatory Palestine]]. There, at 17, she \"first had sexual intercourse on a starry night, in a haystack, without contraception.\" She later told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that \"I am not happy about that, but I know much better now and so does everyone who listens to my radio program.\"<ref name=\"NYT\">Dullea, Georgia. \"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D9103FF935A15753C1A961948260 Therapist to Therapist: Analyzing Dr. Ruth]\".

She has hosted several series on the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] Channel and other [[cable television]] networks from 1984 to 1993 and is the author of 45 books on sex and sexuality.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nWestheimer was born '''Karola Ruth Siegel''' on June 4, 1928, in Wiesenfeld (now part of [[Karlstadt am Main]]), [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], the only child of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]], Irma (n\u00e9e Hanauer), a housekeeper, and Julius Siegel, a [[Notions (sewing)|notions]] wholesaler and son of the family for whom Irma worked.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/westheimer-ruth|title=Ruth Westheimer|publisher=JWA.org|date=March 1, 2009 |accessdate=December 18, 2016}}</ref> She was given an early grounding in [[Judaism]] by her father, who took her regularly to the synagogue in the [[Nordend (Frankfurt am Main)|Nordend]] district of [[Frankfurt]], where they lived. Her father was taken away by the Nazis a week after [[Kristallnacht]], or the Night of Broken Glass, in 1938. Westheimer cried while her father was taken away by men in gloss-finished boots, while her grandmother gave the men money and asked them to care for him. Westheimer's mother and grandmother decided that Germany was too dangerous due to the tension and Nazi violence growing, so in January 1939 they sent Westheimer on a \"[[Kindertransport|Kinder Transport]],\" a transport taking Jewish children going to Switzerland. 11-year-old Westheimer arrived at an orphanage of a Jewish charity in [[Heiden, Switzerland]], and took on the role of a caregiver and mother-like figure to the younger children there. Westheimer was not allowed to take classes at the local school, but a fellow orphan boy would sneak his textbooks to Westheimer at night so she could learn and continue her education.\n\nWhile at the orphanage, Westheimer corresponded with her mother and grandmother via letters. When the letters ceased in 1941, Westheimer knew she would not hear from them again. The details of her parents' deaths due to the Holocaust are also included in the Hulu documentary about Westheimer titled \"Ask Dr. Ruth\". Her father was killed in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] concentration camp in 1942. Her mother was killed during the Holocaust, but there is no specific information about her death, or about how and when she died. In the data base at the [[Yad Vashem]] World Holocaust Remembrance Center, Westheimer's mother is categorized by the word ''verschollen'' or 'disappeared.'\n\nWestheimer decided to emigrate to British-controlled [[Mandatory Palestine]]. There, at 17, she \"first had sexual intercourse on a starry night, in a haystack, without contraception.\" She later told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that \"I am not happy about that, but I know much better now and so does everyone who listens to my radio program.\"<ref name=\"NYT\">Dullea, Georgia. \"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D9103FF935A15753C1A961948260 Therapist to Therapist: Analyzing Dr. Ruth]\".

The border runs as a fairly irregular line from the shore of the [[Dollart]] bay which is part of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] river estuary in the north to the Belgium-Germany-Netherlands [[tripoint]] at [[Vaalserberg]]. The length of the border is around {{convert|570|km|abbr=on}} in length, although the straight distance between the two border end points is {{convert|288|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe border runs along portions of rivers, including for {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} along the large [[Rhine]] river. It also runs for about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} along the Meuse valley, although most of the time a few km to the east of the [[Meuse]] river rather than along it, before leaving the valley at the last portion of border to the border tripoint located at [[Vaalserberg]] about {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Aachen]].\n\nThe German states which share the international border are (from north to south) [[Lower Saxony]] and North Rhine Palatinate while on the Dutch side, the provinces are [[Groningen]], [[Drente]], [[Overijssel]], [[Gelderland]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]. \n\n==Border crossings==\nThere are at least 60 official road crossings and six railway crossings of the border. Both countries are part of the [[Schengen Area]] and the [[European Union]], so there are minimal or non-existent border controls.\n\nMotorways crossing the border:\n{| class=wikitable\n|Dutch name || German name || European route\n|-\n| [[A7 motorway (Netherlands)|A7]] || [[Bundesautobahn 280|A280]] || [[European route E22|E22]]\n|-\n| [[A37 motorway (Netherlands)|A37]] || B402 || [[European route E233|E233]]\n|-\n| [[A1 motorway (Netherlands)|A1]] || [[Bundesautobahn 30|A30]] || [[European route E30|E30]]\n|-\n| [[A12 motorway (Netherlands)|A12]] || [[Bundesautobahn 3|A3]] || [[European route E35|E35]]\n|-\n| [[A77 motorway (Netherlands)|A77]] || [[Bundesautobahn 57|A57]] || [[European route E31|E31]]\n|-\n| [[A67 motorway (Netherlands)|A67]] || [[Bundesautobahn 40|A40]] || [[European route E34|E34]]\n|-\n| [[A74 motorway (Netherlands)|A74]] || [[Bundesautobahn 61|A61]] || -\n|-\n| N280 || [[Bundesautobahn 52|A52]] || -\n|-\n| [[A76 motorway (Netherlands)|A76]] || [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] || [[European route E314|E314]]\n|}\n\nRailways crossing the border:\n*[[Ihrhove\u2013Nieuweschans railway]]\n*[[Almelo\u2013Salzbergen railway]]\n*[[Dortmund\u2013Enschede railway]]\n*[[Oberhausen\u2013Arnhem railway]]\n*[[Viersen\u2013Venlo railway]]\n*[[Sittard\u2013Herzogenrath railway]]\n\n==Border Treaties==\nThe modern border today is the result of centuries of border negotiations and agreements between the states and other political entities in the region, such as the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], [[Kingdom of Hannover]] and the  [[United Provinces of the Netherlands]], of which Germany and the Netherlands ultimately became the modern day [[successor states]].

Among the agreements and treaties were:\n*Frontier Treaty between the Kingdom of Hanover and the Kingdom of the Netherlands relating to the course of the frontier signed in Meppen on 2 July 1824.\n*Instrument between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Kingdom of Hanover defining the frontiers of 12 September 1825.\n*Exchange of declarations between the Netherlands and Hanoverian Governments fixing the frontier line in the Dollard, signed in the The Hague and Hanover on 14 and 19 March 1863.\n\n== Disputes ==\nThe maritime border is disputed in a part of the Ems estuary outside the Dollart bay, where Germany has the view that the state border runs on the left bank of the Ems, while the Netherlands regards the [[Thalweg]] as its border. This is based on interpretations of old treaties. Germany relies on a bill of enfeoffment from 1464, when German Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]] raised [[Ulrich I, Count of East Frisia|Ulrich I]], the son of a local chieftain to the status of Imperial Count, in which the [[County of East Frisia]] Is described as  \"von der Westeremse osterwards\" (thus including the Ems). According to the Netherlands, this has lapsed in the [[French period]] - after the incorporation in France of both areas of [[West Frisia]] (now part of the Dutch provinces of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] and [[Friesland]]) and [[East Frisia]] (now part of the German state of [[Lower Saxony]]). Thus according to international law, the boundary should be at the center of the navigation channel.\n<!-- de:Deutsch-Niederl\u00e4ndische Grenzfrage  nl:Eems-Dollardkwestie -->\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dutch annexation of German territory after the Second World War]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{commonscat|Germany-Netherlands border}}\n\n{{Borders of Germany}}\n{{Borders of the Netherlands}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Germany-Netherlands border}}\n[[Category:Germany\u2013Netherlands border]]\n[[Category:International borders]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=June 2018}}\n[[File:Grenzverlauf D-NL.png|thumb|Germany\u2013Netherlands border]]\n[[File:Deutsch-Niederl\u00e4ndische Grenzfrage.svg|thumb|Germany\u2013Netherlands border dispute]]\n[[File:Netterden Dutch-German border.jpg|thumb|Border crossing at [[Netterden]]]]\nThe '''Germany\u2013Netherlands border''' consists of a land border that is {{convert|570|km|abbr=on}} long (including rivers but excluding the maritime border in the [[Dollart]] bay and outside it) and a maritime border running from the bay through the [[Frisian Islands]] into the [[North Sea]].\n\n==Land border==\nThe border is located in the northwestern part of Germany and the east of the Netherlands. The border runs as a fairly irregular line from the shore of the [[Dollart]] bay which is part of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] river estuary in the north to the Belgium-Germany-Netherlands [[tripoint]] at [[Vaalserberg]]. The length of the border is around {{convert|570|km|abbr=on}} in length, although the straight distance between the two border end points is {{convert|288|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe border runs along portions of rivers, including for {{convert|8|km|abbr=on}} along the large [[Rhine]] river. It also runs for about {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} along the Meuse valley, although most of the time a few km to the east of the [[Meuse]] river rather than along it, before leaving the valley at the last portion of border to the border tripoint located at [[Vaalserberg]] about {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} west of [[Aachen]].\n\nThe German states which share the international border are (from north to south) [[Lower Saxony]] and North Rhine Palatinate while on the Dutch side, the provinces are [[Groningen]], [[Drente]], [[Overijssel]], [[Gelderland]] and [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]. \n\n==Border crossings==\nThere are at least 60 official road crossings and six railway crossings of the border. Both countries are part of the [[Schengen Area]] and the [[European Union]], so there are minimal or non-existent border controls.\n\nMotorways crossing the border:\n{| class=wikitable\n|Dutch name || German name || European route\n|-\n| [[A7 motorway (Netherlands)|A7]] || [[Bundesautobahn 280|A280]] || [[European route E22|E22]]\n|-\n| [[A37 motorway (Netherlands)|A37]] || B402 || [[European route E233|E233]]\n|-\n| [[A1 motorway (Netherlands)|A1]] || [[Bundesautobahn 30|A30]] || [[European route E30|E30]]\n|-\n| [[A12 motorway (Netherlands)|A12]] || [[Bundesautobahn 3|A3]] || [[European route E35|E35]]\n|-\n| [[A77 motorway (Netherlands)|A77]] || [[Bundesautobahn 57|A57]] || [[European route E31|E31]]\n|-\n| [[A67 motorway (Netherlands)|A67]] || [[Bundesautobahn 40|A40]] || [[European route E34|E34]]\n|-\n| [[A74 motorway (Netherlands)|A74]] || [[Bundesautobahn 61|A61]] || -\n|-\n| N280 || [[Bundesautobahn 52|A52]] || -\n|-\n| [[A76 motorway (Netherlands)|A76]] || [[Bundesautobahn 4|A4]] || [[European route E314|E314]]\n|}\n\nRailways crossing the border:\n*[[Ihrhove\u2013Nieuweschans railway]]\n*[[Almelo\u2013Salzbergen railway]]\n*[[Dortmund\u2013Enschede railway]]\n*[[Oberhausen\u2013Arnhem railway]]\n*[[Viersen\u2013Venlo railway]]\n*[[Sittard\u2013Herzogenrath railway]]\n\n==Border Treaties==\nThe modern border today is the result of centuries of border negotiations and agreements between the states and other political entities in the region, such as the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], [[Kingdom of Hannover]] and the  [[United Provinces of the Netherlands]], of which Germany and the Netherlands ultimately became the modern day [[successor states]].

The coupe was designed under the direction of AMC's vice president of styling, [[Richard A. Teague]], with input from Mark Donohue, the famous race car driver.

After extensive testing of the special police models offered by Chevy, Ford, and Chrysler, the LAPD chose the AMC Matador because they \"out handled and outperformed all the other cars.\"<ref name=\"Mitchell-104\">{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JHVaQFDrx_MC&pg=RA1-PT49&lpg=RA1-PT49&dq=The+LAPD+chose+the+cars+after+extensive+testing+of+Chevy,+Ford,+and+Chrysler+police+car+offerings,+because,+the+LAPD+said,+the+Matadors+outhandled+and|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111082604/https://books.google.com/books?id=JHVaQFDrx_MC&pg=RA1-PT49&lpg=RA1-PT49&dq=The+LAPD+chose+the+cars+after+extensive+testing+of+Chevy%2C+Ford%2C+and+Chrysler+police+car+offerings%2C+because%2C+the+LAPD+said%2C+the+Matadors+outhandled+and|url-status=dead|title=AMC Muscle Cars: Muscle Car Color History|first=Larry G.|last=Mitchell|archivedate=11 January 2014|publisher=MotorBooks International |isbn = 9781610608015}}</ref> The LAPD police Matadors included among other special equipment: T-2 can lights, a five-channel [[Motorola]] Motrac 70 radio, a [[Federal Signal Corporation|Federal]] siren, and a \"Hot Sheet Desk\" with a Roster [[gooseneck lamp]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2010/02/09/hemmings-find-of-the-day-1973-amc-matador-cop-car-anarchy/ |title=Hemmings Find of the Day \u2013 1973 AMC Matador cop car (Anarchy!!!) |first=Daniel |last=Strohl |date=2 February 2010 |publisher=Hemmings Motor News |accessdate=20 December 2013}}</ref>\n\nMatador sedans and station wagons were also used by other agencies, including the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department|Los Angeles Sheriffs Department]] and many other law enforcement agencies across the U.S. and Canada, as well as by [[military police]] units.\n\nWhile V8 power was down for many domestic sedans, AMC used a {{convert|401|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} [[AMC V8 engine|V8 engine]] that out powered most other police vehicles.

As red rear turn signals were prohibited in Australia, Matador sedans had amber lenses mounted over or behind the reversing lens of the tail light assembly and the turn signals rewired to the reverse lights, while Matador station wagons had their rear turn signals rewired into amber trailer lights that were retrofitted into the tailgate. As with its Rebel predecessor, Matador hardtops were not brought in for the Australian market. AMI's two-door offering was the [[AMC Javelin]]. \n\n====1971====\n[[File:1972 Rambler Matador 360 sedan (6713373843).jpg|thumb|right|1971 Matador, assembled by AMI in 1972. Although RHD, the cars still had LHD windscreen wipers]]\nFrom late 1971, the AMI-built Matador was available in sedan and wagon body styles. (AMI had assembled the 1970 Rebel again in 1971, thereby causing the Matador's release to be a year late.)\n\nAs with the previous Australian-assembled Rebel models, the AMI-assembled Matador continued to use the dash of the U.S. 1967 [[Rambler Ambassador]] first used in the right-hand-drive Ambassadors produced for the [[United States Postal Service]] in 1967, including the three-lever [[Weather Eye]] heater unit and analog clock to the left of the instrument fascia. The black, round instrument dials of the U.S 1970 Ambassador were also reused. A black metal plate with a picture of a bull and a bull fighter covered the cavity to the right side of the fascia where otherwise the radio went on U.S models. An AM radio unit was instead fitted into the centre of the dash, above the ashtray. \n\nAir conditioning was fitted by way of locally supplied under dash units. \n\nSeating for the 1971 model consisted of a locally-made full bench seat, in vinyl, with a fold-down center armrest for both front and rear seats and headrests for the front. \n\nDoor cards were locally made in the style of the U.S model but with cutouts to accommodate the right hand drive positioning of the power window controls (from the U.S AMC Ambassador), and the rear door cards came standard with ash trays. \n\nForward parking light/turn signals received clear lenses as opposed to amber lenses in the U.S. so that front parking lights and turn signals flashed clear.<ref>https://itstillruns.com/parking-lights-used-5023979.html</ref> Amber side marker lenses were used for both the front and rear of the sedans, where otherwise the U.S models had red lenses for the rear. \n\nThe Australian Matador also came with unique \"R\" logo hub caps which were locally made. The full-sized stainless steel hubcaps with the writing \"American Motors\" which were used on the U.S and New Zealand 1970 Rebel and U.S 1971 Matador were never available as an option in Australia. Apart from the hubcaps, externally the 1971 Australian Matador was the same as the U.S 1971 model. \n\nUnlike the U.S models, Australian Matadors came standard with power steering, power windows<ref>https://www.carsguide.com.au/rambler/matador/price/1971/base?id=xgjS</ref> and the heavy duty steering and suspension otherwise optioned for Police and Taxis in the U.S. \n\nDespite being right hand drive cars Australian Matadors retained the left-hand-drive windscreen wiper assembly (left hand sweep.) \n\nA total of 69 Matador sedans and 64 station wagons (including some 1970 Rebel station wagons reassembled in 1971) were sold in Australia in 1971.\n\n====1972====\n[[File:Rambler Matador in the SunRice Festival parade in Pine Ave.jpg|thumb|right|Australian 1972 Rambler Matador. 1972 models were also assembled into 1973]]\nAMI continued to assemble the U.S 1971 model into 1972 marketing it as a \"1972\" model.<ref>http://www.hudson-amc.org.au/gallery/members-cars/palumbo%20matador/palumbo-matador.htm</ref> The U.S 1972 Matador was assembled by AMI from late 1972. \n\nAs with the U.S model, the Australian 1972 model came with the new Torqueflite 727 transmission and the new-for-1972 external style changes. \n\nThe black instrument dials of the U.S 1970 Ambassador were again reused in the RHD 1967 Ambassador dash. The revised arm rests of the U.S 1971 model were consistent with the Australian 1972 model. The front bench seats were again locally made with individually reclinable driver and passenger seat backs and a fold-down middle arm rest. The rear seat was the same as the 1971 Australian model. The same door cards from the 1971 model were reused and again made locally, also allowing for the RHD power window controls.\n\nIn order to comply with [[Australian Design Rules]] regarding not allowing red rear turn signals, an orange serrated plastic cut-out was glued inside the reverse light lens of the tail light assembly for the sedans, and the reverse lights re-wired as flashers. Station wagons received amber trailer light assemblies drilled into the tail gate and wired as turn signals. Clear forward park/turn signal lenses were again used. \n\nThe Australian \"R\" hub caps were reused for the 1972 model. \n\nPower windows, under dash air conditioning, and the Police/Taxi heavy duty steering and suspension remained as standard features.  \n\n300 Matadors (236 sedans, 64 wagons) were sold in 1972, most being U.S. 1971 models.\n\n====1973====\nThe U.S 1972 model was further assembled in 1973 and sold as a \"1973\" model. The U.S 1973 model was assembled by AMI from late 1973. Externally the Australian 1973 model was identical to the U.S 1973 model, with the same grill and tail light changes. \n\nAMI boasted the new model's 11.4 per cent increase in brake horsepower and 3.5 per cent increase in torque, despite a slew of anti-pollution equipment. A four-barrel carburetor replaced the two-barrel carburetor used up until this time.<ref>https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/224502376</ref> \n\nThe Australian SKD kits again came with heavy duty suspension as used on Police and Taxi cars in the U.S. \n\nFor amber rear flashers, AMI fitted an orange serrated plastic cut-out over the clear reverse lens of the tail light lens assembly and once again re-wired the reverse lights as the turn signals. Station wagons again received amber trailer light assemblies drilled into the tail gate and wired as turn signals. For 1973 AMI dispensed with the transparent parking light/turn signal lenses, but instead of simply using the standard U.S amber lens, they fitted an off-the-shelf, notably ill-fitting, rectangular amber trailer lens in each light cavity to make the lights flash amber.<ref>https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctor_keats/266794586/in/photolist-pzoJE-d1hhRm-2bqPGXy-DjjxAN-2gP22zr-7naTWo-6Fjxhc-2cAfnzv-ms2o3y-6hotu3-YmvgRB-BXARZC-qdKPMi-f2Xt7F-Ymvgwt-of3EQP-VJGXup-7TaSxB-34oxeA-4ghrLR-cXGDDf-34iZtp-d6gSHU-2cwSfYg-34iZuF-bgbHrn-d3pMmu-mrZQoV-mrZJcB-ms1e6B-Uhf9iJ-D2LZhq-nPadeZ-DrzBYN-CVuNE1-JQsmsy-TCEvXD-BCPJfs-Qp2ffN-2cwSfVa-j8Fnha-9zxbjK-BTUi7g-pHUTvW-beeMbk-d2UY7N-8fhtQv-FYrcq1-beeN9T-bLHijk</ref> \n\nFrom 1973 Matadors were fitted with Australian-made front split-bench seats in vinyl, each with their own fold-down armrest and headrests. The new headrests were not so \"chunky\" as the 1971 and 1972 models. The rear bench seat remained the same. The locally-made door cards first used in the Australian 1971 model were again reused. \n\nA slight change to the dash was done from the 1973 model onwards, in that the 1967 Ambassador \"flat\" passenger dash pad was replaced with a more protruding dash pad that ran flush with the instrument cluster binnacle and no longer with the speaker in the dash pad. For sound, speakers were fitted into both front door cards. Otherwise the dash was the same as previous models but new for 1973 was the introduction of the white-backed instrument cluster of the U.S 1972/1973 Matador, displaying in miles-per-hour (mph.)\n\nPower windows, power steering, under dash air conditioning, and electric aerial remained standard.\n\nFor 1973, Australian sales were 230 Matadors (191 sedans, 30 wagons.) Most were U.S 1972 models.\n\n====1974====  \nFor 1974 AMI continued to assemble the U.S 1973 model again, marketing it as a \"1974\" model. \n\nChanges for the year included the introduction of white instrument dials (in use on the U.S models since 1972 but displaying [[Metrication in Australia|kilometers per hour]] (km/h.)\n\nThe left-hand-drive wiper assembly was finally re-engineered locally to a right-hand-drive sweep.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.everystockphoto.com/photo.php?imageId=2442374|title=Rambler Matador|website=everystockphoto}}</ref> \n\nThe horn pad and steering wheel of the U.S 1973 Matador (without \"bullseye\" logo) was replaced with the slightly smaller steering wheel and interchangeable horn pad of the [[AMC Hornet]] (with the \"AMC\" logo in the center.)<ref>http://carphotos.cardomain.com/ride_images/4/226/4361/38064680003_original.jpg?v=0</ref> \n\nAlso for 1974 three-point retractable seat belts for the front and rear were fitted, replacing the [[Seat belt|two-point sash belts]]. \n\nThe locally-made, split-bench front seat and rear seat from the 1973 model were again reused, as were the locally-made door cards copied from the U.S 1971 model.\n\n145 Matadors (118 sedans, 27 wagons) were sold in Australia during 1974. All were U.S 1973 models.\n\n====1975====\nFor 1975 AMI continued to assemble the U.S 1973 model, marketing it as a \"1975\" model. All the standard features of the U.S 1973 model and local year-by-year changes were retained. \n\nAssembly of the revised second-generation Matador sedan and wagon released in the United States in 1974 was held off in Australia until December 1975. \n\nRegistrations for 1975 were 118 Matadors (85 sedans, 33 wagons) including the first few of the second-generation models assembled at the end of 1975.\n\n====1976====\n[[File:1974 Rambler Matador Sedan (9347190925).jpg|thumb|right|1976 (U.S 1974) Australian-assembled Rambler Matador sedan]]\nAMI assembled the U.S 1974 second-generation Matador sedan and wagon through 1976 marketing it as the new \"1976\" model.

The 1967 Ambassador Weather Eye unit, previously positioned to the left of the instrument dials for the Australian-built Rebel and first generation Matador, was shifted to the right of the dials.

Purdy Motor had acquired the franchise rights to market American Motors vehicles in 1959 and had imported complete cars to Costa Rica, but it was not until 1964 that Costa Rican laws permitted local assembly of vehicles. Purdy Motor built an assembly plant in 1965 and the first locally-manufactured Rambler was a 1964 Rambler Classic 660 which came off the line in late 1965. The all-new 1967 Rebel was assembled to production end, followed by the Matador from 1971. \n\nIn 1974 a new local vehicle manufacturer, Motorizada de Costa Rica, purchased the rights of Rambler distributorship from Purdy Motor. Motorizada continued to assemble AMC and Jeep vehicles as well as other brands until 1978. Motorizada was liquidated in 1979 allegedly for not paying taxes thereby ending the AMC brand in Costa Rica.\n\nAs with other export markets the Matador was marketed in Costa Rica under the Rambler marque even after the marque was retired by AMC in its home market after 1969.<ref name=\"amc_costarica\">{{cite web|url= http://amc.co.cr/amc_costarica.htm |title=Timeline of American Motors in Costa Rica |work=American Motors Corporation, Costa Rica |accessdate=23 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Mexico===\nMatadors were built by [[Veh\u00edculos Automotores Mexicanos]] (VAM) in [[Mexico]].\n\n====First generation====\n=====1971=====\nContinuing the concept of VAM's version of the AMC Rebel, the Mexican Matadors were only available as a single trim level and in four-door sedan and two-door hardtop forms in their initial year. The hardtop retained the Rambler Classic SST name while the four-door sedan changed from Rambler Classic 770 to Rambler Classic DPL.<ref name=\"arcticboy1\">{{cite web|url= http://www.arcticboy.com/Pages/arcticboysvam.html |last=Wilson |first=Bob |title=Arcticboy's VAM Pages |publisher=arcticboy |accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref> Both body styles saw the same features as the 1971 AMC Matadors and were almost equal with only few exclusive characteristics for each. Standard equipment consisted of four-wheel manual drum bakes, manual steering, {{convert|170|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} gross at 4,600 rpm {{convert|252|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 engine with Carter WCD two-barrel carburetor and 9.5:1 compression ratio, fully synchronized three-speed manual transmission with column shift, 10-in heavy duty clutch, 3.54:1 rear differential gear ratio with manual transmission, 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio with automatic transmission, electric two-speed wipers, electric washers, rectangular full-length {{convert|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} speedometer, electric analog clock, collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch, luxury custom steering wheel, courtesy lights, cigarette lighter, dashboard ashtray, locking glove box, wide individual front seats (hardtop), front bench seat (sedan), two-point front seatbelts, front and rear side armrests, dual rear ashtrays, single round dome light (sedan), dual C-pillar dome lights (hardtop), dual coat hooks, bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, and driver's side remote mirror. Optional equipment included power drum brakes (standard with automatic transmission), power steering, heavy-duty suspension, automatic transmission, heater with front defroster, vinyl roof, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, passenger's side remote mirror, bumper guards, bumper tubes, and locking gas cap.\n\n=====1972=====\nFor 1972, all VAM cars received the same revisions and improvements of the AMC models. The Classic line saw upgrades in the replacement of the {{convert|252|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} six in favor of the {{convert|282|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} with gross {{convert|200|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4,400 rpm with Carter ABD two-barrel carburetor, 9.5 compression ratio, and 266 degree camshaft. Power brakes with front disks became standard equipment regardless of transmission, a Chrysler A998 three-speed automatic transmission in place of the older Borg-Warner automatics, heavy-duty suspension with front sway bar, improved heater with revised controls placed to the right of the steering column, and new two-round-pod instrument cluster. New wheel cover and grille designs were noticeable on the exterior, while seat patterns and side panels were also updated.\n\nSince its redesign in 1970, the hardtop body style started to drop in sales and the front end facelift of 1971 did not help to reverse the trend. VAM did not want to drop it leaving it without a mid-sized two-door. The model was reworked into an all-new limited edition with a sportier focus for 1972, as well as featuring more appointments similar to a personal luxury car.<ref name=\"vam-amx\">{{cite web|url= http://amccars.net/cgi/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1258865214 |author=Mauricio Jord\u00e1n |title=The AMX in Mexico - Alternative Performance |publisher=The AMC Forum |date=22 November 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2013 }}</ref> This became the VAM Classic Brougham, with the name \"Rambler\" removed to rejuvenate the line, while the four-door sedan became the VAM Classic DPL. The Brougham included as standard equipment power steering, three-speed automatic transmission with floor-mounted shifter (the same unit as the U.S. Rebel Machine models), center console with locking compartment (also shared with the Rebel Machine), individual high-back bucket seats (shared with the VAM Javelin), bright trim for pedals, heater, AM/FM stereo radio with four speakers, tinted windshield, and a remote controlled driver's side remote mirror. Despite the marketing and high level of equipment, the public saw it as the previous model. The only external differences with the previous model were limited to the colors, the grille, the standard vinyl roof and the wheel covers. The price was higher than that of the Rambler Classic SST and it did not increase sales for the year, ending below VAM's expectations. The VAM Classic Brougham is the closest Mexican equivalent to AMC models Rebel Machine and Matador Machine sold in the U.S. and Canada and is probably the most collectible Matador/Rebel model produced in Mexico.\n\n=====1973=====\nBecause of the low sales of the Classic Brougham hardtop, the Classic DPL four-door sedan became the only Matador version produced by VAM for 1973, with Javelin being the largest two-door model offered by the company. The 1973 Classic DPLs were virtually the same to their previous year's counterparts with differences only in seat and side panel designs as well as the grille design and a new engine head with larger valves and independent rockers.\n\n====Second generation====\n=====1974=====\nThe generational change that AMC Matadors received for 1974 in the United States was also introduced in Mexico. Units ordered with the automatic transmission also included power steering and a heater. The beginning of automotive engine emission certification in Mexico affected the {{convert|282|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} six, which changed to a lower 8.5:1 compression ratio. \n\n====Matador Coupe====\nThe biggest news of the year was the arrival or a new two-door model, AMC's Matador coupe. Unlike all previous (Matador and Rebel) models, it was available in two different trim levels; the sporty Classic AMX equivalent to the AMC Matador X model and the luxury Classic Brougham equivalent to the AMC Matador Brougham coupe model.<ref name=\"vam-amx\"/> Both versions were mechanically the same, carrying the same technical specifications as the Classic DPL models. Their main differences relied in appearance and accessories. The Classic AMX sported VAM's in-house five-spoke wheels with volcano center caps and trim rings, a blacked out grille and a rally stripe surrounding the full length of the car with an integrated AMX emblem on the right corner of the trunk lid; the Classic Brougham had a standard vinyl roof cover with its respective moldings, wheel covers (new design for the year), standard grille and \"Brougham\" emblems over the C-pillar bases. The Classic AMX showcased a three-spoke sports steering wheel, high-back fold-down individual bucket seats, center console with locking compartment, floor-mounted gearshift, and AM/FM radio. Despite the sportiness of the model, intended to take the place of the Javelin as VAM's top-of-the-line performance model as well as the image and enthusiast builder, the side armrests were the standard designs used in the Matador base models of the U.S. On the other hand, the Classic Brougham sported a custom sports steering wheel and column-mounted shifter with a fold-down split-back bench seat and AM radio. Unlike the Classic DPL, both the Classic AMX and the Classic Brougham included the automatic transmission, power steering and heater as standard equipment. A unique characteristic of the 1974 VAM Classic AMX was the shifter because it was the Javelin's \"aircraft\" U-shaped design.\n\n=====1975=====\nFor 1975, changes on all three versions were few. The Classic DPL obtained a new one-piece grille design with rectangular parking lights, in accordance with the US-versions, alongside new seats and door panels. The luxury steering wheel obtained a new design for the both Classic DPL and the Classic Brougham. Both coupe models obtained new interior door panels with AMC's full-length X-model side armrests; the panels of the sports version also carried an etched \"AMX\" emblem over the vinyl near the top front corner of the door. The Classic AMX also featured AMC's X-model floor-mounted shifter design. All three versions shared the upgrades of electronic ignition, a vacuum gauge in place of the electric clock, a {{convert|282|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 with a lower 7.7:1 compression ratio, and Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor. The rear differential gear ratio was changed to 3.31:1 for both transmissions.\n\n=====1976=====\nThere were more changes for the 1976 model year. The Classic DPL and Brougham featured a new design for wheel covers. Both coupe models obtained a new grille design divided in two portions with squared parking lights. The Classic AMX had a new and more discreet side decal covering only the front fenders and a new metal \"AMX\" emblem on the trunk lid corner. All three versions shared a new 160 km/h speedometer, tinted windshield, and seat designs that were based in AMC's Oleg Cassini units for the Matador coupes. These were color-keyed with the rest of the interior, the most unusual ones were those of the AMX as they were individual and included adjustable headrests with integrated Cassini crests and reclining mechanism. This is the only case of a VAM car close to the various U.S. AMC designer cars.\n\nThe Classic line was discontinued in the middle of the 1976 model year. VAM was looking forward to introducing the Pacer model to Mexican market, which would represent its fourth product line, while Mexican legislation at the time allowed only three per marque. Having both the Classic and the Pacer in the luxury market segment would have also caused internal competition. VAM favored the new Pacer over what until that time had been its flagship model. Starting in 1977, VAM's most luxurious model was the Pacer,<ref>{{cite book|url= https://archive.org/details/carsofamericanmo0000cran |url-access= registration |quote= AMC Pacer in Mexico. |page=[https://archive.org/details/carsofamericanmo0000cran/page/202 202] |title=The Cars of American Motors: An Illustrated History |first=Marc |last=Cranswick |publisher=McFarland |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-7864-4672-8 |accessdate=30 November 2013 }}</ref> and its largest sized models were the Americans (AMC Hornets).\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe Rambler name was used on right hand drive Matador models sold in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |last= Hayward |first=David O. |title=Chrysler United Kingdom: A History of Chrysler in Britain |url= http://www.allpar.com/world/england.html |publisher=allpar com |accessdate=30 November 2013 }}</ref> Matador sedans were available through Rambler Motors (A.M.C) Limited in Chiswick, West London alongside the Ambassador hardtop and station wagon, and Javelin.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Rambler_Motors |title=Rambler Motors - Graces Guide|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-1968/44/us-car-concessionaires-great-britain |title=U.S. Car Concessionaires in Great Britain |date=7 July 2014 |website=Motor Sport Magazine}}</ref> With the exception of the Javelin, Matadors and Ambassadors were exported from Kenosha with factory right-hand drive, as had been with the prior Rebel and Ambassador models brought into the U.K. \n\nUnlike the Knock-down kits used for Australian assembly which continued to use the RHD version of the 1967 Ambassador dash, cluster, and [[Weather Eye]] (albeit to the right of the cluster for the second generation models) U.K. second-generation Matadors were factory-built with the temperature controls of the US-versions (positioned underneath and to the left of the instrument dials.)

The large-sized Matador was no longer attractive to customers demanding more economical cars as fuel and money became increasingly worrisome problems after the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the continuing double-digit domestic inflation.\n\nLacking the financial resources for a full redesign, AMC dropped the large Ambassador after 1974, while the Matador was discontinued after 1978, around the same time as Ford moved their full-size nameplates to a smaller platform. The [[Downsize (automobile)|downsized]] 1977 [[Chevrolet Impala]] also spelled doom for large intermediates from AMC and Chrysler. American Motors responded to the declining demand for large cars by introducing a new nameplate in 1978, the [[AMC Concord]].

At first, it was available in only one distinctive two-tone paint pattern consisting of Golden Ginger Metallic with Sand Tan. \n\nThe Barcelona included numerous comfort and appearance upgrades in addition to the extensive standard equipment that came on all Matadors. The special items were: individual reclining seats in velveteen crush fabric with woven accent stripes, custom door trim panels, unique headliner, headlight bezels painted accent color, black trunk carpet, rear [[sway bar]], GR78x15 radial [[whitewall tire]]s, color-keyed slot styled wheels, body color front and rear bumpers, two-tone paint, landau padded vinyl roof, opera quarter windows with accents, dual remote control mirrors painted body color, Barcelona medallion on glove box door and fenders, {{convert|24|oz|abbr=on}} carpeting and bumper nerf strips. The standard roll-down rear quarter windows were converted into fixed \"opera windows\" with fiberglass covers over the stock openings that were finished with padded vinyl inside and out. \n\nFor the 1978 model year, the Barcelona package came in a second color scheme: an Autumn Red Metallic on Claret Metallic combination. The 258-cubic-inch six with automatic remained standard, but the 360-cubic-inch became the only V-8 option. Production for this final year was 2,006 coupes.<ref name=\"howstuff74-78\"/>\n\n''Motor Trend'' magazine road tested a 1977 Barcelona II coupe and found it to be equal to all in the objective areas, as well as one of the most distinctive vehicles on the road that \"makes a good deal of sense... if you're not put off by the Matador's unique lines.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Hall |first=Bob |title=AMC Matador Barcelona II |journal=Motor Trend |date=August 1977 |pages=107\u2013110}}</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n\n== NASCAR racing ==\n[[File:AMCMatadorCocaColaPitStop.jpg|thumb|right|#12 NASCAR Matador during a pit stop]]\n[[File:AMC Matador Coupe.jpg|thumb|right|#16 NASCAR Matador tribute car in [[Sweden]]]]\n\n[[Penske Racing]] prepared factory-backed Matador hardtops and coupes were used in [[NASCAR]] [[stock car racing|stock car]] tracks.

Although RHD, the cars still had LHD windscreen wipers]]\nFrom late 1971, the AMI-built Matador was available in sedan and wagon body styles. (AMI had assembled the 1970 Rebel again in 1971, thereby causing the Matador's release to be a year late.)\n\nAs with the previous Australian-assembled Rebel models, the AMI-assembled Matador continued to use the dash of the U.S. 1967 [[Rambler Ambassador]] first used in the right-hand-drive Ambassadors produced for the [[United States Postal Service]] in 1967, including the three-lever [[Weather Eye]] heater unit and analog clock to the left of the instrument fascia. The black, round instrument dials of the U.S 1970 Ambassador were also reused. A black metal plate with a picture of a bull and a bull fighter covered the cavity to the right side of the fascia where otherwise the radio went on U.S models. An AM radio unit was instead fitted into the centre of the dash, above the ashtray. \n\nAir conditioning was fitted by way of locally supplied under dash units. \n\nSeating for the 1971 model consisted of a locally-made full bench seat, in vinyl, with a fold-down center armrest for both front and rear seats and headrests for the front. \n\nDoor cards were locally made in the style of the U.S model but with cutouts to accommodate the right hand drive positioning of the power window controls (from the U.S AMC Ambassador), and the rear door cards came standard with ash trays. \n\nForward parking light/turn signals received clear lenses as opposed to amber lenses in the U.S. so that front parking lights and turn signals flashed clear.<ref>https://itstillruns.com/parking-lights-used-5023979.html</ref> Amber side marker lenses were used for both the front and rear of the sedans, where otherwise the U.S models had red lenses for the rear. \n\nThe Australian Matador also came with unique \"R\" logo hub caps which were locally made. The full-sized stainless steel hubcaps with the writing \"American Motors\" which were used on the U.S and New Zealand 1970 Rebel and U.S 1971 Matador were never available as an option in Australia. Apart from the hubcaps, externally the 1971 Australian Matador was the same as the U.S 1971 model. \n\nUnlike the U.S models, Australian Matadors came standard with power steering, power windows<ref>https://www.carsguide.com.au/rambler/matador/price/1971/base?id=xgjS</ref> and the heavy duty steering and suspension otherwise optioned for Police and Taxis in the U.S. \n\nDespite being right hand drive cars Australian Matadors retained the left-hand-drive windscreen wiper assembly (left hand sweep.) \n\nA total of 69 Matador sedans and 64 station wagons (including some 1970 Rebel station wagons reassembled in 1971) were sold in Australia in 1971.\n\n====1972====\n[[File:Rambler Matador in the SunRice Festival parade in Pine Ave.jpg|thumb|right|Australian 1972 Rambler Matador. 1972 models were also assembled into 1973]]\nAMI continued to assemble the U.S 1971 model into 1972 marketing it as a \"1972\" model.<ref>http://www.hudson-amc.org.au/gallery/members-cars/palumbo%20matador/palumbo-matador.htm</ref> The U.S 1972 Matador was assembled by AMI from late 1972. \n\nAs with the U.S model, the Australian 1972 model came with the new Torqueflite 727 transmission and the new-for-1972 external style changes. \n\nThe black instrument dials of the U.S 1970 Ambassador were again reused in the RHD 1967 Ambassador dash. The revised arm rests of the U.S 1971 model were consistent with the Australian 1972 model. The front bench seats were again locally made with individually reclinable driver and passenger seat backs and a fold-down middle arm rest. The rear seat was the same as the 1971 Australian model. The same door cards from the 1971 model were reused and again made locally, also allowing for the RHD power window controls.\n\nIn order to comply with [[Australian Design Rules]] regarding not allowing red rear turn signals, an orange serrated plastic cut-out was glued inside the reverse light lens of the tail light assembly for the sedans, and the reverse lights re-wired as flashers. Station wagons received amber trailer light assemblies drilled into the tail gate and wired as turn signals. Clear forward park/turn signal lenses were again used. \n\nThe Australian \"R\" hub caps were reused for the 1972 model. \n\nPower windows, under dash air conditioning, and the Police/Taxi heavy duty steering and suspension remained as standard features.  \n\n300 Matadors (236 sedans, 64 wagons) were sold in 1972, most being U.S. 1971 models.\n\n====1973====\nThe U.S 1972 model was further assembled in 1973 and sold as a \"1973\" model. The U.S 1973 model was assembled by AMI from late 1973. Externally the Australian 1973 model was identical to the U.S 1973 model, with the same grill and tail light changes. \n\nAMI boasted the new model's 11.4 per cent increase in brake horsepower and 3.5 per cent increase in torque, despite a slew of anti-pollution equipment. A four-barrel carburetor replaced the two-barrel carburetor used up until this time.<ref>https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/224502376</ref> \n\nThe Australian SKD kits again came with heavy duty suspension as used on Police and Taxi cars in the U.S. \n\nFor amber rear flashers, AMI fitted an orange serrated plastic cut-out over the clear reverse lens of the tail light lens assembly and once again re-wired the reverse lights as the turn signals. Station wagons again received amber trailer light assemblies drilled into the tail gate and wired as turn signals. For 1973 AMI dispensed with the transparent parking light/turn signal lenses, but instead of simply using the standard U.S amber lens, they fitted an off-the-shelf, notably ill-fitting, rectangular amber trailer lens in each light cavity to make the lights flash amber.<ref>https://www.flickr.com/photos/doctor_keats/266794586/in/photolist-pzoJE-d1hhRm-2bqPGXy-DjjxAN-2gP22zr-7naTWo-6Fjxhc-2cAfnzv-ms2o3y-6hotu3-YmvgRB-BXARZC-qdKPMi-f2Xt7F-Ymvgwt-of3EQP-VJGXup-7TaSxB-34oxeA-4ghrLR-cXGDDf-34iZtp-d6gSHU-2cwSfYg-34iZuF-bgbHrn-d3pMmu-mrZQoV-mrZJcB-ms1e6B-Uhf9iJ-D2LZhq-nPadeZ-DrzBYN-CVuNE1-JQsmsy-TCEvXD-BCPJfs-Qp2ffN-2cwSfVa-j8Fnha-9zxbjK-BTUi7g-pHUTvW-beeMbk-d2UY7N-8fhtQv-FYrcq1-beeN9T-bLHijk</ref> \n\nFrom 1973 Matadors were fitted with Australian-made front split-bench seats in vinyl, each with their own fold-down armrest and headrests. The new headrests were not so \"chunky\" as the 1971 and 1972 models. The rear bench seat remained the same. The locally-made door cards first used in the Australian 1971 model were again reused. \n\nA slight change to the dash was done from the 1973 model onwards, in that the 1967 Ambassador \"flat\" passenger dash pad was replaced with a more protruding dash pad that ran flush with the instrument cluster binnacle and no longer with the speaker in the dash pad. For sound, speakers were fitted into both front door cards. Otherwise the dash was the same as previous models but new for 1973 was the introduction of the white-backed instrument cluster of the U.S 1972/1973 Matador, displaying in miles-per-hour (mph.)\n\nPower windows, power steering, under dash air conditioning, and electric aerial remained standard.\n\nFor 1973, Australian sales were 230 Matadors (191 sedans, 30 wagons.) Most were U.S 1972 models.\n\n====1974====  \nFor 1974 AMI continued to assemble the U.S 1973 model again, marketing it as a \"1974\" model. \n\nChanges for the year included the introduction of white instrument dials (in use on the U.S models since 1972 but displaying [[Metrication in Australia|kilometers per hour]] (km/h.)\n\nThe left-hand-drive wiper assembly was finally re-engineered locally to a right-hand-drive sweep.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.everystockphoto.com/photo.php?imageId=2442374|title=Rambler Matador|website=everystockphoto}}</ref> \n\nThe horn pad and steering wheel of the U.S 1973 Matador (without \"bullseye\" logo) was replaced with the slightly smaller steering wheel and interchangeable horn pad of the [[AMC Hornet]] (with the \"AMC\" logo in the center.)<ref>http://carphotos.cardomain.com/ride_images/4/226/4361/38064680003_original.jpg?v=0</ref> \n\nAlso for 1974 three-point retractable seat belts for the front and rear were fitted, replacing the [[Seat belt|two-point sash belts]]. \n\nThe locally-made, split-bench front seat and rear seat from the 1973 model were again reused, as were the locally-made door cards copied from the U.S 1971 model.\n\n145 Matadors (118 sedans, 27 wagons) were sold in Australia during 1974. All were U.S 1973 models.\n\n====1975====\nFor 1975 AMI continued to assemble the U.S 1973 model, marketing it as a \"1975\" model. All the standard features of the U.S 1973 model and local year-by-year changes were retained. \n\nAssembly of the revised second-generation Matador sedan and wagon released in the United States in 1974 was held off in Australia until December 1975. \n\nRegistrations for 1975 were 118 Matadors (85 sedans, 33 wagons) including the first few of the second-generation models assembled at the end of 1975.\n\n====1976====\n[[File:1974 Rambler Matador Sedan (9347190925).jpg|thumb|right|1976 (U.S 1974) Australian-assembled Rambler Matador sedan]]\nAMI assembled the U.S 1974 second-generation Matador sedan and wagon through 1976 marketing it as the new \"1976\" model.

Purdy Motor had acquired the franchise rights to market American Motors vehicles in 1959 and had imported complete cars to Costa Rica, but it was not until 1964 that Costa Rican laws permitted local assembly of vehicles. Purdy Motor built an assembly plant in 1965 and the first locally-manufactured Rambler was a 1964 Rambler Classic 660 which came off the line in late 1965. The all-new 1967 Rebel was assembled to production end, followed by the Matador from 1971. \n\nIn 1974 a new local vehicle manufacturer, Motorizada de Costa Rica, purchased the rights of Rambler distributorship from Purdy Motor. Motorizada continued to assemble AMC and Jeep vehicles as well as other brands until 1978. Motorizada was liquidated in 1979 allegedly for not paying taxes thereby ending the AMC brand in Costa Rica.\n\nAs with other export markets the Matador was marketed in Costa Rica under the Rambler marque even after the marque was retired by AMC in its home market after 1969.<ref name=\"amc_costarica\">{{cite web|url= http://amc.co.cr/amc_costarica.htm |title=Timeline of American Motors in Costa Rica |work=American Motors Corporation, Costa Rica |accessdate=23 November 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Mexico===\nMatadors were built by [[Veh\u00edculos Automotores Mexicanos]] (VAM) in [[Mexico]].\n\n====First generation====\n=====1971=====\nContinuing the concept of VAM's version of the AMC Rebel, the Mexican Matadors were only available as a single trim level and in four-door sedan and two-door hardtop forms in their initial year. The hardtop retained the Rambler Classic SST name while the four-door sedan changed from Rambler Classic 770 to Rambler Classic DPL.<ref name=\"arcticboy1\">{{cite web|url= http://www.arcticboy.com/Pages/arcticboysvam.html |last=Wilson |first=Bob |title=Arcticboy's VAM Pages |publisher=arcticboy |accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref> Both body styles saw the same features as the 1971 AMC Matadors and were almost equal with only few exclusive characteristics for each. Standard equipment consisted of four-wheel manual drum bakes, manual steering, {{convert|170|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} gross at 4,600 rpm {{convert|252|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 engine with Carter WCD two-barrel carburetor and 9.5:1 compression ratio, fully synchronized three-speed manual transmission with column shift, 10-in heavy duty clutch, 3.54:1 rear differential gear ratio with manual transmission, 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio with automatic transmission, electric two-speed wipers, electric washers, rectangular full-length {{convert|200|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} speedometer, electric analog clock, collapsible steering column with built-in ignition switch, luxury custom steering wheel, courtesy lights, cigarette lighter, dashboard ashtray, locking glove box, wide individual front seats (hardtop), front bench seat (sedan), two-point front seatbelts, front and rear side armrests, dual rear ashtrays, single round dome light (sedan), dual C-pillar dome lights (hardtop), dual coat hooks, bright molding package, luxury wheel covers, and driver's side remote mirror. Optional equipment included power drum brakes (standard with automatic transmission), power steering, heavy-duty suspension, automatic transmission, heater with front defroster, vinyl roof, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, passenger's side remote mirror, bumper guards, bumper tubes, and locking gas cap.\n\n=====1972=====\nFor 1972, all VAM cars received the same revisions and improvements of the AMC models. The Classic line saw upgrades in the replacement of the {{convert|252|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} six in favor of the {{convert|282|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} with gross {{convert|200|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} at 4,400 rpm with Carter ABD two-barrel carburetor, 9.5 compression ratio, and 266 degree camshaft. Power brakes with front disks became standard equipment regardless of transmission, a Chrysler A998 three-speed automatic transmission in place of the older Borg-Warner automatics, heavy-duty suspension with front sway bar, improved heater with revised controls placed to the right of the steering column, and new two-round-pod instrument cluster. New wheel cover and grille designs were noticeable on the exterior, while seat patterns and side panels were also updated.\n\nSince its redesign in 1970, the hardtop body style started to drop in sales and the front end facelift of 1971 did not help to reverse the trend. VAM did not want to drop it leaving it without a mid-sized two-door. The model was reworked into an all-new limited edition with a sportier focus for 1972, as well as featuring more appointments similar to a personal luxury car.<ref name=\"vam-amx\">{{cite web|url= http://amccars.net/cgi/yabb2/YaBB.pl?num=1258865214 |author=Mauricio Jord\u00e1n |title=The AMX in Mexico - Alternative Performance |publisher=The AMC Forum |date=22 November 2009 |accessdate=30 November 2013 }}</ref> This became the VAM Classic Brougham, with the name \"Rambler\" removed to rejuvenate the line, while the four-door sedan became the VAM Classic DPL. The Brougham included as standard equipment power steering, three-speed automatic transmission with floor-mounted shifter (the same unit as the U.S. Rebel Machine models), center console with locking compartment (also shared with the Rebel Machine), individual high-back bucket seats (shared with the VAM Javelin), bright trim for pedals, heater, AM/FM stereo radio with four speakers, tinted windshield, and a remote controlled driver's side remote mirror. Despite the marketing and high level of equipment, the public saw it as the previous model. The only external differences with the previous model were limited to the colors, the grille, the standard vinyl roof and the wheel covers. The price was higher than that of the Rambler Classic SST and it did not increase sales for the year, ending below VAM's expectations. The VAM Classic Brougham is the closest Mexican equivalent to AMC models Rebel Machine and Matador Machine sold in the U.S. and Canada and is probably the most collectible Matador/Rebel model produced in Mexico.\n\n=====1973=====\nBecause of the low sales of the Classic Brougham hardtop, the Classic DPL four-door sedan became the only Matador version produced by VAM for 1973, with Javelin being the largest two-door model offered by the company. The 1973 Classic DPLs were virtually the same to their previous year's counterparts with differences only in seat and side panel designs as well as the grille design and a new engine head with larger valves and independent rockers.\n\n====Second generation====\n=====1974=====\nThe generational change that AMC Matadors received for 1974 in the United States was also introduced in Mexico. Units ordered with the automatic transmission also included power steering and a heater. The beginning of automotive engine emission certification in Mexico affected the {{convert|282|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} six, which changed to a lower 8.5:1 compression ratio. \n\n====Matador Coupe====\nThe biggest news of the year was the arrival or a new two-door model, AMC's Matador coupe. Unlike all previous (Matador and Rebel) models, it was available in two different trim levels; the sporty Classic AMX equivalent to the AMC Matador X model and the luxury Classic Brougham equivalent to the AMC Matador Brougham coupe model.<ref name=\"vam-amx\"/> Both versions were mechanically the same, carrying the same technical specifications as the Classic DPL models. Their main differences relied in appearance and accessories. The Classic AMX sported VAM's in-house five-spoke wheels with volcano center caps and trim rings, a blacked out grille and a rally stripe surrounding the full length of the car with an integrated AMX emblem on the right corner of the trunk lid; the Classic Brougham had a standard vinyl roof cover with its respective moldings, wheel covers (new design for the year), standard grille and \"Brougham\" emblems over the C-pillar bases. The Classic AMX showcased a three-spoke sports steering wheel, high-back fold-down individual bucket seats, center console with locking compartment, floor-mounted gearshift, and AM/FM radio. Despite the sportiness of the model, intended to take the place of the Javelin as VAM's top-of-the-line performance model as well as the image and enthusiast builder, the side armrests were the standard designs used in the Matador base models of the U.S. On the other hand, the Classic Brougham sported a custom sports steering wheel and column-mounted shifter with a fold-down split-back bench seat and AM radio. Unlike the Classic DPL, both the Classic AMX and the Classic Brougham included the automatic transmission, power steering and heater as standard equipment. A unique characteristic of the 1974 VAM Classic AMX was the shifter because it was the Javelin's \"aircraft\" U-shaped design.\n\n=====1975=====\nFor 1975, changes on all three versions were few. The Classic DPL obtained a new one-piece grille design with rectangular parking lights, in accordance with the US-versions, alongside new seats and door panels. The luxury steering wheel obtained a new design for the both Classic DPL and the Classic Brougham. Both coupe models obtained new interior door panels with AMC's full-length X-model side armrests; the panels of the sports version also carried an etched \"AMX\" emblem over the vinyl near the top front corner of the door. The Classic AMX also featured AMC's X-model floor-mounted shifter design. All three versions shared the upgrades of electronic ignition, a vacuum gauge in place of the electric clock, a {{convert|282|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 with a lower 7.7:1 compression ratio, and Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor. The rear differential gear ratio was changed to 3.31:1 for both transmissions.\n\n=====1976=====\nThere were more changes for the 1976 model year. The Classic DPL and Brougham featured a new design for wheel covers. Both coupe models obtained a new grille design divided in two portions with squared parking lights. The Classic AMX had a new and more discreet side decal covering only the front fenders and a new metal \"AMX\" emblem on the trunk lid corner. All three versions shared a new 160 km/h speedometer, tinted windshield, and seat designs that were based in AMC's Oleg Cassini units for the Matador coupes. These were color-keyed with the rest of the interior, the most unusual ones were those of the AMX as they were individual and included adjustable headrests with integrated Cassini crests and reclining mechanism. This is the only case of a VAM car close to the various U.S. AMC designer cars.\n\nThe Classic line was discontinued in the middle of the 1976 model year. VAM was looking forward to introducing the Pacer model to Mexican market, which would represent its fourth product line, while Mexican legislation at the time allowed only three per marque. Having both the Classic and the Pacer in the luxury market segment would have also caused internal competition. VAM favored the new Pacer over what until that time had been its flagship model. Starting in 1977, VAM's most luxurious model was the Pacer,<ref>{{cite book|url= https://archive.org/details/carsofamericanmo0000cran |url-access= registration |quote= AMC Pacer in Mexico. |page=[https://archive.org/details/carsofamericanmo0000cran/page/202 202] |title=The Cars of American Motors: An Illustrated History |first=Marc |last=Cranswick |publisher=McFarland |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-7864-4672-8 |accessdate=30 November 2013 }}</ref> and its largest sized models were the Americans (AMC Hornets).\n\n===United Kingdom===\nThe Rambler name was used on right hand drive Matador models sold in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |last= Hayward |first=David O. |title=Chrysler United Kingdom: A History of Chrysler in Britain |url= http://www.allpar.com/world/england.html |publisher=allpar com |accessdate=30 November 2013 }}</ref> Matador sedans were available through Rambler Motors (A.M.C) Limited in Chiswick, West London alongside the Ambassador hardtop and station wagon, and Javelin.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Rambler_Motors |title=Rambler Motors - Graces Guide|website=www.gracesguide.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.motorsportmagazine.com/archive/article/april-1968/44/us-car-concessionaires-great-britain |title=U.S. Car Concessionaires in Great Britain |date=7 July 2014 |website=Motor Sport Magazine}}</ref> With the exception of the Javelin, Matadors and Ambassadors were exported from Kenosha with factory right-hand drive, as had been with the prior Rebel and Ambassador models brought into the U.K. \n\nUnlike the Knock-down kits used for Australian assembly which continued to use the RHD version of the 1967 Ambassador dash, cluster, and [[Weather Eye]] (albeit to the right of the cluster for the second generation models) U.K. second-generation Matadors were factory-built with the temperature controls of the US-versions (positioned underneath and to the left of the instrument dials.)

The large-sized Matador was no longer attractive to customers demanding more economical cars as fuel and money became increasingly worrisome problems after the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the continuing double-digit domestic inflation.\n\nLacking the financial resources for a full redesign, AMC dropped the large Ambassador after 1974, while the Matador was discontinued after 1978, around the same time as Ford moved their full-size nameplates to a smaller platform. The [[Downsize (automobile)|downsized]] 1977 [[Chevrolet Impala]] also spelled doom for large intermediates from AMC and Chrysler.
