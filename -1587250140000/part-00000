'''Whipped cream''' is a culinary [[colloid]] produced when [[cream]] is aerated by one of two processes: mechanical agitation with a high-speed blade or whip, or injecting a gas under high pressure which expands rapidly when released from pressurized containment. It is often sweetened and sometimes flavored with [[vanilla]]. Whipped cream is also called '''Chantilly cream''' or '''Cr\u00e8me chantilly''' ({{IPA-fr|k\u0281\u025bm \u0283\u0251\u0303tiji|pron}}).\n\n== Fat content==\nThe typical fat content of cream used for whipping is high as fat globules contribute to forming a stable structure surrounding and stabilizing air bubbles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uoguelph.ca/foodscience/book-page/whipped-cream-structure|title=Whipped Cream Structure {{!}} Food Science|website=www.uoguelph.ca|access-date=2020-01-04}}</ref>. The typical fat content for whipping cream is between 30%-36% milkfat. Other components include water at 62.9-57.3% and proteins at 2.5-2.2%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Aggarwal|first=M.

If, however, the whipping is continued, the fat droplets will stick together destroying the colloid and forming [[butter]].  Lower-fat cream (or milk) does not whip well, while higher-fat cream produces a more stable foam.<ref name=\"mcgee\"/>\n\n==Methods of whipping==\n<!--[[Whipping siphon]] redirects directly here.-->\nCream is usually mechanically whipped with a [[whisk]], an electric hand [[mixer (cooking)|mixer]], or a [[food processor]]. Results are best when the equipment and ingredients are cold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonappetit.com/test-kitchen/common-mistakes/article/whipped-cream-common-mistakes|title=Whip it Real Good: How to Make Whipped Cream at Home|first=Rochelle|last=Bilow|date=|website=bonappetit.com}}</ref> The bubbles in the mechanically whipped cream immediately start to pop, and the whipped cream begins to liquefy. Thus mechanically whipped cream has a useful lifetime of one to two hours. Many 19th-century recipes recommend adding [[gum tragacanth]] to stabilize whipped cream, while a few include [[whipped egg whites]].<ref name=\"dubois\"/>  Various other substances, including [[gelatin]] and [[E450 (food additive)|diphosphate]], are used in commercial [[Stabiliser (food)|stabilizers]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Wayne Gisslen|title=Professional Baking|year=2008|ISBN=0471783498|p=264}}</ref><ref>Alan Imeson, ed., ''Food Stabilisers, Thickeners and Gelling Agents'', 2011, {{ISBN|1444360337}}, ''passim''</ref><ref>Rose Levy Beranbaum, ''The Pie and Pastry Bible'', 2009, {{ISBN|1439130876}}, p. 550</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dr. Oetker Whip It|website=Dr. Oetker|url=http://www.oetker.ca/ca-en/our-products/dr-oetker-whip-it/dr-oetker-whip-it.html}}</ref>\n\nWhipped cream may also be made instantly as needed, in two ways: from a retail can, or in a [[soda siphon|'''whipping siphon''']]. Cream is placed into the siphon, and a [[whipped-cream charger]] is inserted into its holder in the siphon. When the top is screwed on the charger is automatically opened, and the pressurized gas contained therein is released to dissolve into the cream. Typically the gas is [[nitrous oxide]], as [[carbon dioxide]] tends to give a sour taste.<ref name=\"lange\"/> The nitrous oxide gas dissolves in the butterfat under pressure. When the pressure is released bubbles are produced, and thus the cream is instantly whipped. \n\n== Flavorings ==\n\nWhipped cream is often flavored with sugar, [[vanilla]], [[coffee]], [[chocolate]], [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], and so on.<ref>Jules Gouff\u00e9e ''et al.'', ''Le livre de p\u00e2tisserie'', 1873 p.

Cream is placed into the siphon, and a [[whipped-cream charger]] is inserted into its holder in the siphon. When the top is screwed on the charger is automatically opened, and the pressurized gas contained therein is released to dissolve into the cream. Typically the gas is [[nitrous oxide]], as [[carbon dioxide]] tends to give a sour taste.<ref name=\"lange\"/> The nitrous oxide gas dissolves in the butterfat under pressure.

It broke into revolt against the authority of the Caliph [[Ali]] after he agreed to arbitration with his rival, [[Muawiyah I]], to decide the succession to the [[Caliphate]] following the [[Battle of Siffin]] (657). A Kharijite later assassinated Ali, and for hundreds of years, the Khawarij were a source of insurrection against the Caliphate.\n\nThe Khawarij opposed arbitration as a means to choose a new ruler on the grounds that \"judgement belongs to God alone\". They considered arbitration a means for people to make decisions while the victor in a battle was determined by God. They believed that any Muslim\u2014even one who was not a [[Quraysh]] or even an [[Arabs|Arab]]\u2014could be the [[Imam]], the leader of the community, if he was morally irreproachable. If the leader sinned, it was the duty of Muslims to oppose and depose him. The only surviving sect of Khawarij are the [[Ibadis]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''al-Khariji'' was used as an [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] by their opponents from the fact that they left Ali's army. The name comes from the [[Semitic root|Arabic root]] {{lang|ar|[[:wikt:|\u062e \u0631 \u062c]]}}, which has the primary meaning \"to leave\" or \"to get out\",{{sfn|Francesca|2006|p=84}} as in the basic word {{lang|ar|[[:wikt:\u062e\u0631\u062c|\u062e\u0631\u062c]]}} \"to go out\".{{sfn|Watt|1973|p=15}}\n\nHowever, the group called themselves ''ash-Shurat'' \"the Exchangers\", which they understood within the context of Islamic scripture ({{cite quran|2|207|s=ns}}) and philosophy to mean \"those who have traded the mortal life ([[al-Dunya]]) for the other life [with God] ([[al-Akhirah]])\".<ref name=Glasse-255>{{cite book|last1=Glasse|first1=Cyril|title=The New Encyclopedia of Islam|date=2001|publisher=Altamira Press|location=California|isbn=978-0759101890|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newencyclopediao0000glas/page/255 255\u201356]|url=https://archive.org/details/newencyclopediao0000glas/page/255}}</ref>{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|p=1075}}{{sfn|Francesca|2006|p=84}}<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World|last=Martin|first=Richard C.|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|year=2004|isbn=978-0028656038|location=|pages=390}}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\n{{Further|First Fitna|Muhakkima}}\nThe Kharijites originated during the [[First Fitna]], the struggle for political leadership over the Muslim community, following the assassination in 656 of the third caliph [[Uthman]].{{sfn|Watt|1973|p=9}} [[Ali]], a cousin and son-in-law of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], was elected caliph but soon had to face with opposition, first from [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubayd Allah]], [[Zubayr ibn al-Awam]] and Muhammad's widow [[A'isha]], whom he was able to defeat (November 656),{{sfn|Donner|2010|pp=157\u2013159}} and later from [[Muawiyah I|Mu'awiya]], the governor of [[Bilad al-Sham|Syria]] and cousin of Uthman. Ali and Muwaiya faced each other at the [[Battle of Siffin]] in July 657. On the verge of defeat, Mu'awiya ordered his soldiers to hoist Qur'an on their lances; a signal to stop the fight and negotiate peace. The pious group of Qur'an readers (Qura) in Ali's army were moved by the gesture,{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=3}} which they interpreted as an appeal to the Book of God,{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=7}}{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=238}} and demanded that Ali stop the fight immediately.

Some 12,000 dissenters seceded from the army and went to a place called Harura. They thus became known as the Harurites.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=3}} They held that the third caliph Uthman had deserved his death because of his faults, and that Ali was the legitimate caliph, while Mu'awiya was a rebel.{{sfn|Francesca|2006|pp=84\u201385}} They believed that the Qur'an clearly stated that as a rebel Mu'awiya was not entitled to arbitration, but rather should be fought until he repented, pointing to the verse:{{sfn|Francesca|2006|pp=84\u201385}}<ref name=OEIW>{{cite encyclopedia |author=John Alden Williams |author2=Justin Corfield |title=Khaw\u0101rij |encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World |editor=John L.

They acknowledged that they had sinned but argued that they had repented and asked Ali to do the same, which he did in very general and ambiguous terms. They subsequently offered back their allegiance to him and returned to Kufa on the condition that war against Mu'awiya be resumed within six months.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|pp=248\u2013249}}\n\n===Nahrawan===\nThe arbitration proceedings continued however and after a few months (March 658),{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|p=1074}} when Ali refused to denounce the arbitration and sent his arbitration delegation headed by [[Abu Musa Ash'ari]] to carry out the talks, Kharijites denounced Ali's caliphate and elected [[Abd Allah ibn Wahb al-Rasibi]] their caliph. In order to avoid being detected, they moved out of Kufa in small groups and went to a place called Nahrawan on the east bank of [[Tigris]]. Some five hundred of their [[Basra|Basran]] comrades were informed and they too joined them in Nahrawan, amounting to a total of 4,000 men.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=17\u201318}}{{sfn|Madelung|1997|pp=251\u2013252}} Following this exodus, they were called as Khawarij.{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|pp=1074\u20131075}} They declared Ali and his followers apostates and killed several people who did not share their views.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=17\u201318}}\n\nIn the meantime, arbitrators declared that Uthman had been killed unjustly by the rebels. Other than that, however, they could not agree on anything substantial and the process collapsed. Ali now denounced the arbitrators and called on his supporters for renewed war against Mu'awiya.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=163}} He invited Kharijites to join him in war against Mu'awiya as before. They refused to do so unless he would acknowledge that he had gone astray and repent. Ali consequently decided to depart for Syria without them.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=258}} On the way, however, he received news of the Kharijites' murdering various people, and was urged by his followers, who feared for their families and property in Kufa, to deal with the Kharijites first.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=259}} Kharijites refused to surrender the murderers and consequently Ali's attacked them in their camp, inflicting a heavy defeat on them at the [[Battle of Nahrawan]] (July 658), killing Ibn Wahb and most of his supporters.{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|pp=1074\u20131075}} Some 1200 of them, however, surrendered and were spared.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=18}} This bloodshed sealed the split of Kharijites from Ali's followers, and Kharijite calls for revenge ultimately led to Ali's assassination in 661 by a Kharijite.{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|pp=1074\u20131075}}{{sfn|Francesca|2006|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n== Later history ==\n\nFor hundreds of years the Khawarij continued to be a source of insurrection against the Caliphate.<ref name=Glasse-255/> Five small Kharijite revolts, involving about 200 men each, following Nahrawan were defeated during the caliphate of Ali.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=18}}{{sfn|Watt|1973|p=19}} Under Mu'awiya, Basra replaced Kufa as the center of Kharijite disturbance. His governors of Iraq [[Ziyad ibn Abihi]] and [[Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad]] dealt with Kharijites with a heavy-hand and sixteen Kharijite revolts, with rebel numbers in individual revolts varying between 30 to 500, were suppressed.{{sfn|Watt|1973|p=19}} From now on, they started the practice of raiding undefended towns in the neighborhoods of Basra in rapid cavalry attacks whereby they would seem to appear from nowhere, pillage the towns and disappear quickly before the government forces could respond. If pursued, they would flee into mountainous regions of Iran.{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|p=1075}} In Basra, Ibn Ziyad is reported to have been particularly hard on them. He jailed any Kharijite whom he suspected of being dangerous and executed several Kharijite sympathizers who had publicly spoken against him.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|pp=25\u201326}} Ziyad and Ibn Ziyad are said to have killed thirteen thousand Kharijites in total.{{sfn|Morony|1984|p=472}} To avoid suppression, Basran Kharijites fled to Arabia around 680 CE.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=27}}\n\n===Second Fitna===\nAfter the death of Mua'wiya in 680, the empire fell to civil war over the question of leadership. The people of Hejaz (where Mecca and Medina are located) rebelled against the new caliph [[Yazid I|Yazid]].{{sfn|Donner|2010|pp=177, 181}} When Yazid sent an army to end the Hijazi rebellion in 683 and [[Siege of Mecca (683)|Mecca was besieged]], Kharijites assisted [[Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr]], who was based on Mecca and opposed Yazid, in defending the city.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=27}} However, Yazid died soon afterwards and Ibn al-Zubayr proclaimed himself caliph.

Basran tribal chiefs expelled Ibn Ziyad and the city fell to civil war. Kharijites took over the city, killed the deputy appointed by Ibn Ziyad and broke 140 of their comrades free from Ibn Ziyad's prison.{{sfn|Morony|1984|p=473}} Soon afterwards, Basrans recognized Ibn al-Zubayr and he appointed [[Abd Allah ibn Harith]], more commonly known as Babba, his governor there.

Thereafter he went on to seize [[Hadhramawt]] and [[Yemen]] in 687 and later captured [[Taif]], a town close to Ibn al-Zubayr's capital Mecca. Ibn al-Zubayr was consequently cornered in Hejaz and Najda controlled much of Arabia. He was later deposed for being too soft and was subsequently executed in 691 by his own fellow Kharijites.{{sfn|Dixon|1971|pp=171\u2013173}} Abu Fudiak took over the leadership and defeated several Zuabyrid and later Umayyad attacks.

They also believed that Ali committed a grave sin when he agreed on the arbitration with Muawiyah. The Kharijites thus deemed the arbitrators (Abu Musa Ashaari and 'Amr ibn al-'As), the leaders who appointed these arbitrators (Ali and Muawiyah I) and all those who agreed on the arbitration (all companions of Ali and Muawiyah]) as [[Kafir|kuffar]] \"disbelievers\", as they had breached the rules of the Qur'an.

It broke into revolt against the authority of the Caliph [[Ali]] after he agreed to arbitration with his rival, [[Muawiyah I]], to decide the succession to the [[Caliphate]] following the [[Battle of Siffin]] (657). A Kharijite later assassinated Ali, and for hundreds of years, the Khawarij were a source of insurrection against the Caliphate.\n\nThe Khawarij opposed arbitration as a means to choose a new ruler on the grounds that \"judgement belongs to God alone\". They considered arbitration a means for people to make decisions while the victor in a battle was determined by God. They believed that any Muslim\u2014even one who was not a [[Quraysh]] or even an [[Arabs|Arab]]\u2014could be the [[Imam]], the leader of the community, if he was morally irreproachable. If the leader sinned, it was the duty of Muslims to oppose and depose him. The only surviving sect of Khawarij are the [[Ibadis]].\n\n==Etymology==\nThe term ''al-Khariji'' was used as an [[Exonym and endonym|exonym]] by their opponents from the fact that they left Ali's army.

Ali and Muwaiya faced each other at the [[Battle of Siffin]] in July 657. On the verge of defeat, Mu'awiya ordered his soldiers to hoist Qur'an on their lances; a signal to stop the fight and negotiate peace. The pious group of Qur'an readers (Qura) in Ali's army were moved by the gesture,{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=3}} which they interpreted as an appeal to the Book of God,{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=7}}{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=238}} and demanded that Ali stop the fight immediately. Although unwilling, he had to yield under pressure and threats of violence against him.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=3}}{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|p=1074}}{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=238}} An arbitration committee was setup with representatives from both Ali and Mu'awiya's side with a mandate to settle the dispute in the light of the Qur'an.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=3}} While most of Ali's army accepted the agreement, one group, mostly from the tribe of Tamim, vehemently objected to the arbitration and raised the slogan \"judgment belongs to God alone\".{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|p=1074}}\n\n===Harura===\nAs Ali marched back to [[Kufa]], his capital, resentment against the arbitration became widespread in his army. Some 12,000 dissenters seceded from the army and went to a place called Harura. They thus became known as the Harurites.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=3}} They held that the third caliph Uthman had deserved his death because of his faults, and that Ali was the legitimate caliph, while Mu'awiya was a rebel.{{sfn|Francesca|2006|pp=84\u201385}} They believed that the Qur'an clearly stated that as a rebel Mu'awiya was not entitled to arbitration, but rather should be fought until he repented, pointing to the verse:{{sfn|Francesca|2006|pp=84\u201385}}<ref name=OEIW>{{cite encyclopedia |author=John Alden Williams |author2=Justin Corfield |title=Khaw\u0101rij |encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World |editor=John L.

Yet if one is rebellious to the other, then fight the insolent one until it returns to God\u200a's command. (Quran 49:9)}}\n\nThey held that in agreeing to arbitration Ali committed the grave sin of rejecting God's judgment (''[[hukm]]'') and attempted to substitute human judgment for God's clear injunction, which prompted their motto \"judgement belongs to God alone\" (''la hukma illa li-llah'').<ref name=OEIW/>{{sfn|Hawting|1978|p=460}} From this expression, which they were the first to use as a motto, they became known as ''[[Muhakkima]]''.{{sfn|Djebli|2000|p=107}} They also believed that Muslims owe allegiance only to the Quran and the sunna of Muhammad, Abu Bakr, and Umar, and denied that the right to the imamate should be based on close kinship with Muhammad.{{sfn|Francesca|2006|pp=84\u201385}}\n\nAli, after some time, visited the Harura camp and in order to win back their support argued that it was them who forced him to accept arbitration proposal despite his warnings against it. They acknowledged that they had sinned but argued that they had repented and asked Ali to do the same, which he did in very general and ambiguous terms. They subsequently offered back their allegiance to him and returned to Kufa on the condition that war against Mu'awiya be resumed within six months.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|pp=248\u2013249}}\n\n===Nahrawan===\nThe arbitration proceedings continued however and after a few months (March 658),{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|p=1074}} when Ali refused to denounce the arbitration and sent his arbitration delegation headed by [[Abu Musa Ash'ari]] to carry out the talks, Kharijites denounced Ali's caliphate and elected [[Abd Allah ibn Wahb al-Rasibi]] their caliph. In order to avoid being detected, they moved out of Kufa in small groups and went to a place called Nahrawan on the east bank of [[Tigris]]. Some five hundred of their [[Basra|Basran]] comrades were informed and they too joined them in Nahrawan, amounting to a total of 4,000 men.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=17\u201318}}{{sfn|Madelung|1997|pp=251\u2013252}} Following this exodus, they were called as Khawarij.{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|pp=1074\u20131075}} They declared Ali and his followers apostates and killed several people who did not share their views.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=17\u201318}}\n\nIn the meantime, arbitrators declared that Uthman had been killed unjustly by the rebels. Other than that, however, they could not agree on anything substantial and the process collapsed. Ali now denounced the arbitrators and called on his supporters for renewed war against Mu'awiya.{{sfn|Donner|2010|p=163}} He invited Kharijites to join him in war against Mu'awiya as before. They refused to do so unless he would acknowledge that he had gone astray and repent. Ali consequently decided to depart for Syria without them.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=258}} On the way, however, he received news of the Kharijites' murdering various people, and was urged by his followers, who feared for their families and property in Kufa, to deal with the Kharijites first.{{sfn|Madelung|1997|p=259}} Kharijites refused to surrender the murderers and consequently Ali's attacked them in their camp, inflicting a heavy defeat on them at the [[Battle of Nahrawan]] (July 658), killing Ibn Wahb and most of his supporters.{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|pp=1074\u20131075}} Some 1200 of them, however, surrendered and were spared.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=18}} This bloodshed sealed the split of Kharijites from Ali's followers, and Kharijite calls for revenge ultimately led to Ali's assassination in 661 by a Kharijite.{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|pp=1074\u20131075}}{{sfn|Francesca|2006|pp=84\u201385}}\n\n== Later history ==\n\nFor hundreds of years the Khawarij continued to be a source of insurrection against the Caliphate.<ref name=Glasse-255/> Five small Kharijite revolts, involving about 200 men each, following Nahrawan were defeated during the caliphate of Ali.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=18}}{{sfn|Watt|1973|p=19}} Under Mu'awiya, Basra replaced Kufa as the center of Kharijite disturbance. His governors of Iraq [[Ziyad ibn Abihi]] and [[Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad]] dealt with Kharijites with a heavy-hand and sixteen Kharijite revolts, with rebel numbers in individual revolts varying between 30 to 500, were suppressed.{{sfn|Watt|1973|p=19}} From now on, they started the practice of raiding undefended towns in the neighborhoods of Basra in rapid cavalry attacks whereby they would seem to appear from nowhere, pillage the towns and disappear quickly before the government forces could respond. If pursued, they would flee into mountainous regions of Iran.{{sfn|Levi Della Vida|1978|p=1075}} In Basra, Ibn Ziyad is reported to have been particularly hard on them. He jailed any Kharijite whom he suspected of being dangerous and executed several Kharijite sympathizers who had publicly spoken against him.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|pp=25\u201326}} Ziyad and Ibn Ziyad are said to have killed thirteen thousand Kharijites in total.{{sfn|Morony|1984|p=472}} To avoid suppression, Basran Kharijites fled to Arabia around 680 CE.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=27}}\n\n===Second Fitna===\nAfter the death of Mua'wiya in 680, the empire fell to civil war over the question of leadership. The people of Hejaz (where Mecca and Medina are located) rebelled against the new caliph [[Yazid I|Yazid]].{{sfn|Donner|2010|pp=177, 181}} When Yazid sent an army to end the Hijazi rebellion in 683 and [[Siege of Mecca (683)|Mecca was besieged]], Kharijites assisted [[Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr]], who was based on Mecca and opposed Yazid, in defending the city.{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|p=27}} However, Yazid died soon afterwards and Ibn al-Zubayr proclaimed himself caliph. Kharijites, after discovering that Ibn al-Zubayr had proclaimed caliphate and did not share their view of Uthman and condemned his murder, abandoned him{{sfn|Rotter|1982|p=80}} and went to Basra. Basran tribal chiefs expelled Ibn Ziyad and the city fell to civil war. Karijites took over the city, killed the deputy appointed by Ibn Ziyad and broke 140 of their comrades free from Ibn Ziyad's prison.{{sfn|Morony|1984|p=473}} Soon afterwards, Basrans recognized Ibn al-Zubayr and he appointed [[Abd Allah ibn Harith]], more commonly known as Babba, his governor there. Babba drove Kharijites out of Basra and they escaped to [[Ahwaz]].{{sfn|Watt|1973|p=21}} Doctrinal difference led to split between two of their leaders: [[Najda ibn Amir al-Hanafi]] and [[Nafi ibn Azraq]].{{sfn|Rotter|1982|p=80}}\n\n====Najdat====\nNajda, with his followers, moved to [[Al-Yamama|Yamama]]. This faction became known as [[Najdat]].{{sfn|Rotter|1982|p=80}} There he took over, in 685, another Kharijite faction led by a certain Abu Talut and started raiding towns in Ibn al-Zuabyr's domains.{{sfn|Dixon|1971|pp=169\u2013170}} He soon controlled Yamama and Bahrain and defeated a 14,000 strong Zubayrid army that was sent against him. Thereafter he went on to seize [[Hadhramawt]] and [[Yemen]] in 687 and later captured [[Taif]], a town close to Ibn al-Zubayr's capital Mecca. Ibn al-Zubayr was consequently cornered in Hejaz and Najda controlled much of Arabia. He was later deposed for being too soft and was subsequently executed in 691 by his own fellow Kharijites.{{sfn|Dixon|1971|pp=171\u2013173}} Abu Fudiak took over the leadership and defeated several Zuabyrid and later Umayyad attacks. He was finally killed along with 6,000 followers in 692 by Umayyad forces in Bahrain and the Najdat faction came to an end.{{sfn|Dixon|1971|pp=175\u2013176}}{{sfn|Wellhausen|1901|pp=30\u201332}}\n\nThey aroused condemnation by mainstream scholars such as  14th-century Muslim Ismail [[ibn Kathir]] who wrote, \"If they ever gained strength, they would surely corrupt the whole of the Earth, Iraq and [[Syria (region)|Shaam]] \u2013 they would not leave a baby, male or female, neither a man or a woman, because as far as they are concerned the people have caused corruption, a corruption that cannot be rectified except by mass killing.\"<ref name=\"theglobeandmail.com\"/>\nIn a similar vein, the 10th century Islamic scholar [[Abu Bakr al-Ajurri]] said, \"None of the scholars, in either past or recent times, ever disagreed that the Khawarij are an evil group, disobedient to Allah Almighty and to His Messenger - Peace Be Upon Him.

They also believed that Ali committed a grave sin when he agreed on the arbitration with Muawiyah. The Kharijites thus deemed the arbitrators (Abu Musa Ashaari and 'Amr ibn al-'As), the leaders who appointed these arbitrators (Ali and Muawiyah I) and all those who agreed on the arbitration (all companions of Ali and Muawiyah]) as [[Kafir|kuffar]] \"disbelievers\", as they had breached the rules of the Qur'an.

{"title_page": "Silver Branch", "text_new": "{{Celtic mythology}}\n\nThe '''Silver Branch''' or '''Silver Bough''' ({{Lang-ga|An Craobh Airgid}}) is a symbol found in [[Irish mythology]] and literature.\n\nFeatured in the Irish poem [[The Voyage of Bran]] and the narrative ''[[Echtra Cormaic|Cormac's Adventure in the Land of Promise]]'', it represents entry into the [[Celtic Otherworld]] Irish [[T\u00edr na n\u00d3g]]: \n\n== Literary examples ==\n\n=== Voyage of Bran ===\nIn ''[[Imram Brain]]'' (\"Voyage of Bran\"), the silver apple branch with white apple blossoms was brought to [[Bran mac Febail]] by a mysterious woman, who disclosed that the branch of white silver ({{lang-ga|findargat}}) was from Emain (or Emne), presumably the land where she hailed from. After singing verses describing her land as the place of delight (with poetic names such as the \"Plain of White Silver\"); thereafter she slipped away, and the branch sprang back to her, with Bran having no power to keep it in his grasp.<ref name=meyer-imram-brain/> Bran then mounted on a voyage and reached the Land of Women (T\u00edr inna m-Ban),<ref>{{harvp|Meyer|1895}} ed., \"Voyage of Bran\" \u00b662. pp. 30\u201331</ref> which is Emain, at least according to some commentators.<ref name=cook/>{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|Kuno Meyer who edited the text merely footnoted the gloss in the manuscript \".i. nomen regionis\", which imparts no further information beyond this being a place name,<ref>{{harvp|Meyer|1895}} ed., \"Voyage of Bran\" \u00b62\u20133, 10 and notes. 4\u20137.</ref> and noting that the variant Emne in the text is the nominative form.<ref>{{harvp|Meyer|1895}} ed., \"Voyage of Bran\" \u00b619 and notes. pp. 10\u201311</ref>}} Some other commentators venture the silver branch Bran saw originated in [[Emain Ablach]],<ref name=mackillop-emain-ablach/> even though that extended form does not appear in the text of the ''Imram Brain''.{{Refn|group=\"lower-alpha\"|Emain Ablach is one of the names of Manann\u00e1n's dominion in ''Altram Tige D\u00e1 Medar'': \"Manannan\u2019s house at Emain Ablach\"Emain Ablach\".<ref name=dobs-altram/>}}\n\nThe land of the branch turned out to be some sort of \"Otherworld\", for even though Bran and his crew believed they tarried at the Land of Women for a year, it turned out to be many years, even centuries, so that when they approached Ireland, they learned that they had become ancient history, and a member who tried to set foot on land turned into ashes.<ref>{{harvp|Meyer|1895}} ed., \"Voyage of Bran\" \u00b662\u201365, pp. 30\u201333</ref><ref name=nutt-imram-brain-summ/>\n\n[[Eleanor Hull] wrote a paper drawing parallel between this silver branch and the [[The Golden Bough (mythology)|golden bough]] of Roman legend which was required for entry into the Underworld (Pluto).{{sfnp|Hull|1901|p=431}} In like manner, the branch (silver or otherwise) is an object given to a human invited by a denizen of the Otherworld to visit his/her realm, offering \"a clue binding the desired one to enter\".{{sfnp|Hull|1901|p=435}} One of the paralleling examples was the branch seen by Bran.{{sfnp|Hull|1901|p=436}}\n\nThough not a genuine [[Celticist]], to quote [[Walter Yeeling Evans-Wentz|W.

The sea god initially visited Cormac's ramparts (at [[Tara, Ireland|Tara]]) as an unidentified warrior from a land \"wherein there is nought save truth, and there is neither age nor decay nor gloom\", etc., later identified as the Land of Promise ([[T\u00edr Tairngire]]). The branch created magical soporific music that assuaged those afflicted with injury or illness to sleep, including \"women in child-bed\".{{efn|This tale exists in several manuscripts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; i. e.

In September 2007, [[William F. Bottke]], David Vokrouhlick\u00fd, and David Nesvorn\u00fd proposed an origin for the impactor in an article published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''. They argued that a collision in the asteroid belt 160 million years ago resulted in the [[Baptistina family]] of asteroids, the largest surviving member of which is [[298 Baptistina]].

name=\"Gawrych133210\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=133, 210.}}</ref><ref name=\"Hanioglu267\"/> Shemsi as such was an ''ayal\u0131'' (a person that rises through the army ranks to become an officer) and not a ''mektepli'' (a person who gets military school education and then enters the officer corps).<ref name=\"Gawrych133\"/> In 1901 Shemsi, a favorite of [[Abdul Hamid II]] and his trusted official was appointed as commander of the 18th Infantry Division based in [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Mitrovi\u00e7e]] (modern Mitrovic\u00eb) that protected an important northern entry route into the empire.<ref

name=\"Zurcher29\">{{harvnb|Z\u00fcrcher|2014|p=29.}}</ref> During the start of the Muslim religious holiday [[Bayram (Turkey)|Bayram]], Shemsi got a telegram in early September 1907 about an incident in Smolic\u00eb regarding the profanation of the village mosque with a dead pig.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> The Italian consul in Kosovo thought it was a reaction by Catholics to the kidnapping of a Catholic priest held captive in Smolic\u00eb by Muslims, a first time act by them in the area and tensions rapidly rose between both religious communities.<ref name=\"Clayer9495\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=94-95.}}</ref> [[Edith Durham]], a British traveler present in the region commented that the priest was held by Muslims whom demanded that Ottoman authorities release a relative of one of the captors in exchange for the hostage.<ref name=\"Clayer93\"/> \n\nIn short time Shemsi told the local Islamic clergy to soften the reactions of Muslims and stated to them that the pig's dead body did not profane the mosque and ordered the people responsible for the incident be found.<ref name=\"Clayer9599\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=95, 99.}}</ref> In January 1908, an order was received by Shemsi to go with soldiers to Yakova.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> Later at the town Shemsi was met by a Catholic priest who passed on a letter about local Christians having been killed in the area.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> Shemsi then assembled Muslim notables of Yakova and the wider area and said that most Catholics subjected to attacks were innocent.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> Troops were left in the town after Shemsi departed.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> During his time in Yakova, Shemsi received a telegraph from [[Prizren]] about a mosque profanation incident.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> The General dismissed the claim as being untrue due to the discovery of the pig being in the river.<ref name=\"Clayer95\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=95.}}</ref> \n\nTensions continued in the region and the sultan thought that the events in Kosovo had supposed links to [[Ismail Qemali]] and his activities.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> Abdul Hamid II instructed Shemsi to travel to Prizren and tasked him with appeasing Muslims and protecting Christians.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> Shemsi was unable to break and stop a [[Besa (Albanian culture)|besa]] (pledge) which targeted Catholics through boycotts.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> Religious tensions continued as the boycott spread and some Catholics fearing a loss of employment converted to Islam while Shemsi also met with the leadership of the remaining Catholics in the area.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> During these events Catholics had sought protection with Ottoman forces and after Shemsi withdrew his troops from the countryside incidents of violence against them occurred.<ref name=\"Clayer93\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=93.}}</ref>\n\nAnother conflict in 1908 occurred in Yakova between local chieftains and the Curri family with Shemsi instructed to resolve the dispute.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> The Curri family refused an invitation for negotiations with the General.<ref name=\"Clayer100\"/> Shemsi assembled all the Catholic and Muslim notables in April.<ref name=\"Clayer96\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=96.}}</ref> He convinced all sides to sign an agreement which stated an end to persecution of the peasantry, that trade would be unhindered and concerns held by people would be brought to government officials and not consuls of foreign powers.<ref

channels for conflict resolution.<ref name=\"Clayer100\"/> The General also requested that Muslims not give a pretext for foreign intervention into the region.<ref name=\"Clayer100\"/>\n\nIn Kosovo the [[Austro-Hungarian]] vice-consul was of the view that the attitude of Shemsi did not assist in resolving the conflict as he arrived with soldiers representing the authority of the government and did nothing to halt events.<ref name=\"Clayer9798\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=97-98.}}</ref> K\u00fcl\u00e7e, Shemsi's secretary also commented that the General was unable to apply policy as suggested by the Grand Vezir and Inspector General due to the stance of the local Vali who was more in line with the sultan's position of not intervening against Muslims.<ref name=\"Clayer100\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=100.}}</ref> The position of Shemsi was also undermined according to K\u00fcl\u00e7e as the General brought soldiers and did not use them.<ref name=\"Clayer101\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=101.}}</ref> Toward the end of June the situation was not settled and Shemsi had to go back to Prizren.<ref name=\"Clayer9697\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=96,

notables of the area and functioned as the sultan's cultural intermediary.<ref name=\"Gawrych133\"/><ref name=\"Zurcher32\"/> As division commander Shemsi had easy and direct access to the place.<ref

Empire]] in 1846.<ref name=\"Gawrych110133\"/> Originating from a humble background and being unschooled, he began his military career first as a private and later was promoted to ''farik'' (general).<ref name=\"Gawrych133210\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=133, 210.}}</ref><ref name=\"Hanioglu267\"/> Shemsi as such was an ''ayal\u0131'' (a person that rises through the army ranks to become an officer) and not a ''mektepli'' (a person who gets military school education and then enters the officer corps).<ref name=\"Gawrych133\"/> In 1901 Shemsi, a favorite of [[Abdul Hamid II]] and his trusted official was appointed as commander of the 18th Infantry Division based in [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Mitrovi\u00e7e]] (modern Mitrovic\u00eb) that protected an important northern entry route into the empire.<ref name=\"Gawrych110133\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=110, 133.}}</ref> For seven years the 18th Infantry Division was under his command and the sultan came to rely on him as someone with

with a several centuries old mindset while regular soldiers respected Shemsi as he came from their ranks and rose in the army based on demonstrated skills gained from experience.<ref

name=\"Clayer92\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=92.}}</ref>\n\nIn his career Shemsi had to deal with corrupt or incompetent officials in difficult circumstances.<ref name=\"Gawrych110\"/> During February 1905 he attempted to remove Brigadier Cavid Bey as mutasarr\u0131f of [[Pej\u00eb|\u0130pek]] (modern Pej\u00eb) for having caused problems due to disrespect toward Albanian customs and traditions.<ref name=\"Gawrych110113\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|pp=110, 113.}}</ref> In [[Elbasan]] of May 1907 Shemsi placed blame for a small disturbance on two bad officials who later got promoted for their disservice.<ref name=\"Gawrych110\">{{harvnb|Gawrych|2006|p=110.}}</ref>\n\n=== Religious conflict in Kosovo between Muslims and Catholics (1907-1908) ===\n\nReligious conflict between Muslims and Catholics erupted in villages around [[Gjakov\u00eb|Yakova]] (modern Gjakov\u00eb) and Shemsi Pasha was sent to bring order to the area, as he was in charge of resolving conflicts in Kosovo.<ref name=\"Clayer909394\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=90, 93, 94.}}</ref> An Albanian, S\u00fcleyman K\u00fcl\u00e7e, the adjuntant and personal secretary of Shemsi thought that Abdul Hamid II was mistaken in selecting officers whom lacked an education like the General for resolving problems of the area.<ref name=\"Clayer94\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=94.}}</ref><ref name=\"Zurcher29\">{{harvnb|Z\u00fcrcher|2014|p=29.}}</ref> During the start of the Muslim religious holiday [[Bayram (Turkey)|Bayram]], Shemsi got a telegram in early September 1907 about an incident in Smolic\u00eb regarding the profanation of the village mosque with a dead pig.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> The Italian consul in Kosovo thought it was a reaction by Catholics to the kidnapping of a Catholic priest held captive in Smolic\u00eb by Muslims, a first time act by them in the area and tensions rapidly rose between both religious communities.<ref name=\"Clayer9495\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=94-95.}}</ref> [[Edith Durham]], a British traveler present in the region commented that the priest was held by Muslims whom demanded that Ottoman authorities release a relative of one of the captors in exchange for the hostage.<ref name=\"Clayer93\"/> \n\nIn short time Shemsi told the local Islamic clergy to soften the reactions of Muslims and stated to them that the pig's dead body did not profane the mosque and ordered the people responsible for the incident be found.<ref name=\"Clayer9599\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=95, 99.}}</ref> In January 1908, an order was received by Shemsi to go with soldiers to Yakova.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> Later at the town Shemsi was met by a Catholic priest who passed on a letter about local Christians having been killed in the area.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> Shemsi then assembled Muslim notables of Yakova and the wider area and said that most Catholics subjected to attacks were innocent.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> Troops were left in the town after Shemsi departed.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> During his time in Yakova, Shemsi received a telegraph from [[Prizren]] about a mosque profanation incident.<ref name=\"Clayer95\"/> The General dismissed the claim as being untrue due to the discovery of the pig being in the river.<ref name=\"Clayer95\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=95.}}</ref> \n\nTensions continued in the region and the sultan thought that the events in Kosovo had supposed links to [[Ismail Qemali]] and his activities.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> Abdul Hamid II instructed Shemsi to travel to Prizren and tasked him with appeasing Muslims and protecting Christians.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> Shemsi was unable to break and stop a [[Besa (Albanian culture)|besa]] (pledge) which targeted Catholics through boycotts.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> Religious tensions continued as the boycott spread and some Catholics fearing a loss of employment converted to Islam while Shemsi also met with the leadership of the remaining Catholics in the area.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> During these events Catholics had sought protection with Ottoman forces and after Shemsi withdrew his troops from the countryside incidents of violence against them occurred.<ref name=\"Clayer93\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=93.}}</ref>\n\nAnother conflict in 1908 occurred in Yakova between local chieftains and the Curri family with Shemsi instructed to resolve the dispute.<ref name=\"Clayer96\"/> The Curri family refused an invitation for negotiations with the General.<ref name=\"Clayer100\"/> Shemsi assembled all the Catholic and Muslim notables in April.<ref name=\"Clayer96\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=96.}}</ref> He convinced all sides to sign an agreement which stated an end to persecution of the peasantry, that trade would be unhindered and concerns held by people would be brought to government officials and not consuls of foreign powers.<ref name=\"Clayer96100\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=96, 100.}}</ref> In the agreement Shemsi attempted to sever the links between Christians and the [[Great Powers]] through use of Ottoman government channels for conflict resolution.<ref name=\"Clayer100\"/> The General also requested that Muslims not give a pretext for foreign intervention into the region.<ref name=\"Clayer100\"/>\n\nIn Kosovo the [[Austro-Hungarian]] vice-consul was of the view that the attitude of Shemsi did not assist in resolving the conflict as he arrived with soldiers representing the authority of the government and did nothing to halt events.<ref name=\"Clayer9798\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=97-98.}}</ref> K\u00fcl\u00e7e, Shemsi's secretary also commented that the General was unable to apply policy as suggested by the Grand Vezir and Inspector General due to the stance of the local Vali who was more in line with the sultan's position of not intervening against Muslims.<ref name=\"Clayer100\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=100.}}</ref> The position of Shemsi was also undermined according to K\u00fcl\u00e7e as the General brought soldiers and did not use them.<ref name=\"Clayer101\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|p=101.}}</ref> Toward the end of June the situation was not settled and Shemsi had to go back to Prizren.<ref name=\"Clayer9697\">{{harvnb|Clayer|2011|pp=96, 97.}}</ref>\n\nShemsi was seen by Abdul Hamid II as a political and loyal General who could maintain a certain amount of order in Kosovo through his connections with Northern (Gheg) Albanians and notables of the area and functioned as the sultan's cultural intermediary.<ref name=\"Gawrych133\"/><ref name=\"Zurcher32\"/> As division commander Shemsi had easy and direct access to the place.<ref name=\"Gawrych133\"/> During the Albanian revolts of the time Shemsi undertook important services as a General for Abdul Hamid II.<ref name=\"Hanioglu267\"/> Even with Shemsi's presence in Kosovo,
