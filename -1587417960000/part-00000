The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Watson|first=G.

Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/233534126|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat&hl=en|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ standing rigging to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the galley (kitchen). A cruising yacht is likely to have a head (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such power is inboard on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63125961|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\n[[File:America's Cup Racing, 1893-Fred S. Cozzens-IMG 5974.JPG|thumb|1893 [[America's Cup]] match between ''[[Vigilant (yacht)|Vigilant]]'' and ''[[Valkyrie II]]'']]\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\n[[File:Spray.jpg|thumb|[[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'' in 1898]]\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation (1895-98).<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Racing yachts ===\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

Watertightness of connections, ports and hatches are key to staying afloat. [[Metacentric height|Stability]]\u2014the ability to return to an upright condition when upset by waves is another key aspect.\n* ''Performance'' hinges on a number of factors, including the waterline length (longer means faster), drag in the water (narrower hull with smooth appendages), hull shape, and sail shape and area.\n* ''Sea kindliness'' is an indicator of steering ease, directional stability and quelling of motion induced by wind and waves.\n\nThe displacement of a monohull cruising sailboat affects the above factors, as follows:<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n* ''Heavy displacement'' yachts with a displacement to length (D/L) ratio of 400+ have a long, deep keel and a protected propellor. They are stable, often roomy, are resistant to harm from groundings and floating obstacles, and have good sea kindliness, but lack speed.\n* ''Medium displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 300 typically have a separate keel and blended rudder support, which improves speed and maneuverability over the heavy displacement designs.\n* ''Light displacement'' yachts with a D/L ratio of about 200 typically have a fin keel and a spade rudder with a ballasted bulb. They have good speed, maneuverability, and ability to point into the wind. Their sea kindliness is less than the heavy and medium-displacement categories.\n\nMultihulls offer tradeoffs as cruising sailboats, compared with [[Monohull|monohulls]]. They may be catamarans or trimarans. They rely on form stability\u2014having separate hulls far apart\u2014for their resistance to capsize.<ref name=\":6\" /> Their advantages include greater: stability, speed, (for catamarans) living space, and shallower draft. Their drawbacks include: greater expenses, greater [[windage]], more difficult tacking under sail, less load capacity, and more maneuvering room required because of their broad beam. They come with a variety of sleeping accommodations and (for catamarans) bridge-deck configurations. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Tarjan, Gregor.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/233534126|title=Catamarans : the complete guide for cruising sailors|date=2008|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-159622-0|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=233534126}}</ref>\n\n=== Construction ===\nTraditionally, all sailing yachts were made of wood, using a wooden keel and ribs, clad with planks. These materials were supplanted with metal in specialty racing yachts. In the 1960s [[fiberglass]] became a prevalent material. These materials and others continue in use.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite book|last=Howard|first=Jim|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NB4uFQuUlnEC&newbks=0&printsec=frontcover&pg=PA7&dq=Cruising+boat&hl=en|title=Handbook of Offshore Cruising: The Dream and Reality of Modern Ocean Cruising|last2=Doane|first2=Charles J.|date=2000|publisher=Sheridan House, Inc.|isbn=978-1-57409-093-2|language=en}}</ref>\n\n* ''Wood'' construction, using conventional planks over ribs continues. Hard-chined boats made with plywood is an infrequent technique. Whereas yachts made with the WEST system\u2014plies of wood strips, soaked in epoxy and applied over the boat frame\u2014provide a durable, lightweight and robust hull.\n* ''Metal'' hulls from steel or aluminum offer the opportunity for welding components to a completely watertight hull. Both metals are vulnerable to damage due to [[electrolysis]]. Steel is easy to repair in boatyards around the world, whereas aluminum is a much lighter material.\n* ''Fiberglass'' construction is best suited for [[Mass production|mass-produced]] yachts, using a mold and is therefore the most prevalent material. Fiberglass skins comprise plies of roving (glass fabric) and matting, soaked in resin for the hull. Decks typically have a core of balsa or PVC foam between layers of glass mat. Both elements of construction are vulnerable to intrusion of water and the development of blisters.\n\n=== Rigs ===\n[[Gaff rig|Gaff rigs]] have been uncommon in the construction of cruising boats, since the mid 20th century. More common rigs are [[Bermuda rig|Bermuda]], [[Fractional rig|fractional]], [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], and [[ketch]]. Occasionally employed rigs since then have been the [[yawl]], schooner, [[Wishbone rig|wishbone]], [[catboat]]. A survey of cruising sailors identified preferences for sloops, cutters, and ketches in equal measure.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\nMost cruising yachts have masts of aluminum, which may be stepped (mounted) on the top of the keel inside the boat or on the top of the cabin, outside. A keel-stepped mast is better able to withstand a failure of its support ing [[standing rigging]], but requires a penetration of the cabin roof and the need for waterproofing. Masts have a variety of possible tracks for the mainsail to be attached and raised. Some allow for in-mast furling of the mainsail at the expense of aerodynamic efficiency of the mast and sail. Some booms allow for roller furling of mainsails.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Gear ===\nSailboats employ standing rigging to support the rig, [[running rigging]] to raise and adjust sails, cleats to secure lines, winches to work the sheets, and more than one anchor to secure the boat in harbor. A cruising yacht's deck usually has safety line to protect the crew from falling overboard and a bow pulpit to facilitate handling the jib and the anchor. In temperate climates, the cockpit may have a canvas windshield with see-through panels, called a \"dodger\". Steering may be either by tiller or wheel.<ref name=\":7\" />\n\n=== Accommodations ===\nDepending on size, a cruising yacht is likely to have at least two cabins, a main salon and a forward stateroom. In smaller yachts, the salon is likely to have convertible berths for its crew or passengers. Typically the salon includes a dining area, which may have a folding, built-in table. The salon is typically contiguous to the galley (kitchen). A cruising yacht is likely to have a head (bathroom) with a marine toilet that discharges waste into a holding tank. Larger may have multiple staterooms and heads. There is typically a navigation station that allows the laying out of charts away from other activities within the vessel. The electrical panel and auxiliary instrumentation is often near this location.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Systems ===\nCruising yachts have an auxiliary propulsion power unit to supplement the use of sails. Such power is inboard on the vessel and diesel, except for the smallest cruising boats, which may have an [[Outboard motor|outboard gasoline motor]]. Electrical power comes from a bank of batteries that are recharged by the motor, driving an alternator. The plumbing system for house water draws from one or more tanks, which are either filled in port or replenished with a [[Desalination|desalination water maker]], driven by the engine. Typically water from kitchen and bathroom sinks and showers drains overboard. Toilets typically use salt water and drain into holding tanks, unless they are in use beyond prescribed distances from shore. Refrigeration may be from ice acquired ashore, or by mechanical refrigeration driven directly from the engine or the yacht's electrical system. Yachts have electrical lighting for inside and outside use and also for night-time running.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nModern yachts employ a suite of electronics for communication, measurement of surroundings, and navigation.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Payne, John C., 1954-|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/63125961|title=Understanding boat electronics|date=2006|publisher=Sheridan House|isbn=1-57409-228-6|location=Dobbs Ferry, NY|oclc=63125961}}</ref>\n\n* ''Communications'' equipment includes radios in a variety of bandwidths, specifically for maritime use. Offshore vessels are likely to be equipped with an [[automatic identification system]] that allows other vessels to see their type and origin as part of the information presented on the ship's radar.\n* ''Instrumentation'' also provides information on depth of water under the vessel ([[Echo sounding|depth sounder]]), windspeed ([[anemometer]]), and directional orientation ([[compass]]).\n* ''Navigation'' electronics include units that identify a vessel's location (e.g. [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]) and display the vessel's location ([[chartplotter]]) and other vessels and nearby shore ([[radar]]).\n\n==Racing==\n{{Under construction|section=Description|placedby=HopsonRoad}}\nWorld Sailing recognizes nine classes of racing yacht:<ref>[http://www.sailing.org/classes/#isaf_sliding_tab_item_classes_index_yacht World Sailing classes of yachts].</ref>\n\n#[[Class40]]\n#[[Farr 30]]\n#[[Farr 40]]\n#[[International Maxi Association]]\n#[[J/111]]\n#[[IMOCA 60]]\n#[[Soto 40]]\n#[[Swan 45]]\n#[[Swan 60]]\n#[[TP 52]]\n#[[X-35 (yacht)|X-35]]\n#[[X-41 (yacht)|X-41]]\n\n==See also==\n{{commonscat-inline|Sailing yachts}}\n*[[Dinghy sailing]]\n*[[International class]]\n*[[List of large sailing yachts]]\n*[[Skiff|Sailing skiff]]\n{{International Sailing Federation Classes}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n[[Category:Sailing yachts]]\n", "name_user": "HopsonRoad", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRacing yachts:Ref.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailing_yacht"}

A hearth fire might be deliberately, ritually extinguished at need, and its lighting or relighting should be accompanied by rituals of completion, purification and renewal, comparable with the rituals and connotations of an [[eternal flame]] and of [[sanctuary lamp]]s. At the level of the ''[[polis]]'', the hearths of Greek [[Colonies in antiquity|colonies]] and their mother cities were allied and sanctified through Hestia's cult. [[Athenaeus]], in the [[Deipnosophistae]], writes that in [[Naucratis]] the people dined in the [[Prytaneion]] on the natal day of Hestia Prytanitis ({{lang-grc|\u1f19\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03a0\u03c1\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c4\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2}}).<ref>[http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/erudits/athenee/livre4gr.htm#149a Athenaeus, Deipnosophists, 4.149]</ref>\n\nResponsibility for Hestia's domestic cult usually fell to the leading woman of the household, although sometimes to a man. Hestia's rites at the hearths of public buildings were usually led by holders of civil office; [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] testifies that the ''[[prytaneum]]'' of a Greek state or community was sacred to Hestia, who was served by the most powerful state officials.<ref>Kajava, p.&nbsp;5.</ref> However, evidence of her priesthoods is extremely rare. Most stems from the early Roman Imperial era, when [[Sparta]] offers several examples of women with the priestly title \"Hestia\"; [[Chalcis]] offers one, a daughter of the local elite. Existing civic cults to Hestia probably served as stock for the grafting of Greek [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)#Greek|ruler-cult]] to the Roman emperor, the Imperial family and Rome itself. In Athens, a small seating section at the [[Theatre of Dionysus]] was reserved for priesthoods of \"Hestia on the [[Acropolis]], [[Livia]], and [[Julia the Elder|Julia]]\", and of \"Hestia Romaion\" (\"Roman Hestia\", thus \"The Roman Hearth\" or Vesta). At [[Delos]], a priest served \"Hestia the Athenian [[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|Demos]]\" (the people or state) \"and [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]]\". An eminent citizen of [[Caria]]n [[Stratonicea (Caria)|Stratoniceia]] described himself as a priest of Hestia and several other deities, as well as holding several civic offices. Hestia's political and civic functions are further evidenced by her very numerous privately funded dedications at civic sites, and the administrative rather than religious titles used by the lay-officials involved in her civic cults.<ref>Kajava, pp.&nbsp;1, 3, 5.</ref>\n\n===Temples===\nEvery private and public hearth or ''[[prytaneum]]'' was regarded as a sanctuary of the goddess, and a portion of the sacrifices, to whatever divinity they were offered, belonged to her. A statue of her reportedly existed in the Athenian Prytaneum: \n:\"Hard by is the Prytaneon (Prytaneum) [the town-hall of Athens] . . . and figures are placed of the goddesses [[Eirene (goddess)|Eirene]] and Hestia.\"<ref>Pausanias, Description of Greece 1. 18. 3 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)</ref>\nHowever, there were very few temples dedicated to Hestia. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mention only two, in [[Ermioni]] and in [[Sparta]]: \n:\"[At Hermione in Argolis :] Passing into the sanctuary of Hestia, we see no image, but only an altar, and they sacrifice to Hestia upon it.<ref>Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 35. 1</ref> [...] The Lakedaimonians (Lacedaemonians) also have a sanctuary of Hestia [at Sparta].\"<ref>Pausanias, Description of Greece 3. 11. 11</ref>\n\n===Hymns and Odes===\nHomeric Hymn&nbsp;24, ''To Hestia'', is a brief invocation of five lines:\n{{quote|Hestia, you who tend the holy house of the lord Apollo, the Far-shooter at goodly [[Delphi|Pytho]], with soft oil dripping ever from your locks, come now into this house, come, having one mind with Zeus the all-wise: draw near, and withal bestow grace upon my song.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0138%3ahymn%3d24 ''Hymn&nbsp;24 to Hestia''].</ref>}}\nHomeric Hymn 29, ''To Hestia'', is another invocation for the goddess and to Hermes:\n{{quote|Hestia, in the  high dwellings of all, both deathless gods and men who walk on earth, you  have gained an everlasting abode and highest honour: glorious is your portion  and your right.

She is the eldest daughter of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] and [[Cronus|Kronos]], and sister to [[Chiron]], [[Demeter]], [[Hades]], [[Hera]], [[Poseidon]], and [[Zeus]],. Immediately after their birth, [[Cronus|Kronos]] swallowed all his children (Hestia was the first who was swallowed) except the last and youngest, Zeus. Instead, Zeus forced [[Cronus|Kronos]] to disgorge his siblings and led them in a war against their father and the other Titans.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:453-491 453&nbsp;ff.]</ref> As \"first to be devoured .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the last to be yielded up again\", Hestia is thus both the eldest and youngest daughter; this mythic inversion is found in the [[Homeric Hymns|Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite]] (700&nbsp;BC).<ref>Kereny, p.&nbsp;91</ref> Throughout mythology, Hestia rejected the marriage suits of [[Poseidon]] and [[Apollo]], and swore herself to perpetual virginity. She thus rejected Aphrodite's values and becomes, to some extent, her chaste, domestic complementary, or antithesis, since [[Aphrodite]] could not bend or ensnare her heart.<ref name=\"Homeric Hymns, To Aphrodite\"/>\n\n===Duty===\nZeus assigned Hestia a duty to feed and maintain the fires of the Olympian hearth with the fatty, combustible portions of animal sacrifices to the gods.<ref>Kajava, pp.&nbsp;1\u20132.</ref> Wherever food was cooked, or an offering was burnt, she thus had her share of honour; also, in all the temples of the gods she has a share of honour. \"Among all mortals she was chief of the goddesses\".<ref name=\"Homeric Hymns, To Aphrodite\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/HomericHymns3.html |title=Homeric Hymns, To Aphrodite}}</ref>\n\n=== Status and Attributes ===\nHestia's Olympian status is equivocal to her status among men. However, at Athens, \"in Plato's time,\" notes Kenneth Dorter<ref>Dorter, K. (1971). Imagery and Philosophy in Plato's Phaedrus. ''Journal of the History of Philosophy'', ''9''&nbsp;(3), 279\u2013288 (July 1971).</ref> \"there was a discrepancy in the list of the [[Twelve Olympians|twelve chief gods]], as to whether Hestia or [[Dionysus]] was included with the other eleven. The altar to them at the agora, for example, included Hestia, but the east frieze of the Parthenon had Dionysus instead.\" Hestia's omission from some lists of the Twelve Olympians is sometimes taken as illustration of her passive, non-confrontational nature \u2013 by giving her Olympian seat to the more forceful Dionysus she prevents heavenly conflict \u2013 but no ancient source or myth describes such a surrender or removal.<ref>Kereny, p.&nbsp;92: \"there is no story of Hestia's ever having taken a husband or ever having been removed from her fixed abode.\"</ref> \"Since the hearth is immovable Hestia is unable to take part even in the procession of the gods, let alone the other antics of the Olympians\", Burkert remarks.<ref>Burkert, p.&nbsp;170.</ref> Her mythographic status as firstborn of Rhea and Cronus seems to justify the tradition in which a small offering is made to Hestia before any sacrifice (\"Hestia comes first\").\n\nThis is not so for every Greek in every generation. In ''Odyssey''&nbsp;''14'', 432\u2013436, the loyal swineherd [[Eumaeus]] begins the feast for his master Odysseus by plucking tufts from a boar's head and throwing them into the fire with a prayer addressed to all the powers, then carved the meat into seven equal portions: \"one he set aside, lifting up a prayer to the forest [[nymph]]s and [[Hermes]], [[Maia]]'s son.\"<ref>Robert Fagles' translation</ref>\n\nThe ambiguities in Hestia's mythology match her indeterminate attributes, character, and iconography. She is identified with the hearth as a physical object, and the abstractions of community and domesticity, but portrayals of her are rare and seldom secure.<ref>Kajava, p.&nbsp;2.</ref> In classical Greek art, she is occasionally depicted as a woman, simply and modestly cloaked in a head veil. At times, it shows her with a staff in hand or by a large fire. She sits on a plain wooden throne with a white woolen cushion and did not trouble to choose an emblem for herself.<ref name=\"Graves\"/>\n\n===Equivalency===\nHer Roman equivalent is [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]];<ref name=Lar>Hughes, James. (1995). ''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', p.&nbsp;215. Larousse/[[The Book People]].</ref> [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] has similar functions as a divine personification of Rome's \"public\", domestic, and colonial hearths, binding Romans together within a form of extended family. The similarity of names between Hestia and Vesta is, however, misleading: \"The relationship ''hestia-histie-Vesta'' cannot be explained in terms of [[Indo-European studies|Indo-European]] linguistics; borrowings from a third language must also be involved,\" according to [[Walter Burkert]].<ref>Burkert,  p. 415, 3.3.1 n.&nbsp;2.</ref>\nOther mythology and religion show similar goddesses or figures. [[Herodotus]] equates the [[Scythian religion|Scythian]] [[Tabiti]] with Hestia. And, the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] holy fire (''[[atar]]'') of the [[Sasanians]] in [[Takht-e Soleym\u0101n|Adhur Gushnasp]] was also equated with Hestia by [[Procopius]].<ref>Procopius, ''History of the Wars'', Book II, XXIV</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{chart top|Hestia's family tree&nbsp;<ref>This chart is based upon [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', unless otherwise noted.</ref>|collapsed=no}}\n{{chart/start}}\n{{chart|}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | | | |URA |y|GAI |URA=[[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]|GAI=[[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.}}\n{{chart|URA| | | | | | | | |CRO |y|RHE |URA=<small>Uranus'&nbsp;genitals</small>|CRO=[[Cronus]]|RHE=[[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | |,|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|^|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.}}\n{{chart| |!| |ZEU |V|~|~|y|~|HER | |POS | |HAD | |DEM | |HES |ZEU=[[Zeus]]|HER=[[Hera]]|POS=[[Poseidon]]|HAD=[[Hades]]|DEM=[[Demeter]]|HES='''HESTIA'''}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:| |,|^|-|.| |!}}\n{{chart|border=0| |!| | | | |:| |!| |AAA |!|AAA= &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a <ref>According to [[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.570 1.570&ndash;579],  [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:14.338 14.338], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:8.312 8.312], Hephaestus was apparently the son of Hera and Zeus, see Gantz, p. 74.</ref>}}\n{{chart|border=0| |!| | | | |:| |!| | |!|BBB |BBB=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b <ref>According to Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+927 927&ndash;929], Hephaestus was produced by Hera alone, with no father, see Gantz, p. 74.</ref>}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:| |!| | |!| |!}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:|ARE | |HEP |HEP=[[Hephaestus]]|ARE=[[Ares]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |D|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|MET |MET=[[Metis (mythology)|Metis]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:| | |ATH |ATH=[[Athena]] <ref>According to Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+886 886&ndash;890], of Zeus' children by his seven wives, Athena was the first to be conceived, but the last to be born; Zeus impregnated Metis then swallowed her, later Zeus himself gave birth to Athena \"from his head\", see Gantz, pp. 51&ndash;52, 83&ndash;84.</ref>}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |D|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|LET |LET=[[Leto]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:| |,|-|^|-|.}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:|APO | |ART |APO=[[Apollo]]|ART=[[Artemis]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |D|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|MAI |MAI=[[Maia (mythology)|Maia]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:| | |HER |HER=[[Hermes]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |D|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|SEM |SEM=[[Semele]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:| | |DIO |DIO=[[Dionysus]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |L|~|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|DIO |DIO=[[Dione (Titaness)|Dione]]}}\n{{chart|border=0|AAA | | | | | | | |BBB|AAA=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a <ref>According to Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+183 183&ndash;200], Aphrodite was born from Uranus' severed genitals, see Gantz, pp. 99&ndash;100.</ref>|BBB=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b <ref>According to [[Homer]], Aphrodite was the daughter of Zeus (''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:3.374 3.374], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:20.105 20.105]; ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:8.308 8.308], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:8.320 320]) and Dione (''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:5.370 5.370&ndash;71]), see Gantz, pp. 99&ndash;100.</ref>}}\n{{chart| |`|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| |!}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | |APH |APH=[[Aphrodite]]}}\n{{chart/end}}\n{{chart bottom}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Greece|Myths|Religion}}\n* [[Sacred fire of Vesta]]\n* [[Vitex agnus-castus]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Walter Burkert|Burkert, Walter]].

A hearth fire might be deliberately, ritually extinguished at need, and its lighting or relighting should be accompanied by rituals of completion, purification and renewal, comparable with the rituals and connotations of an [[eternal flame]] and of [[sanctuary lamp]]s. At the level of the ''[[polis]]'', the hearths of Greek [[Colonies in antiquity|colonies]] and their mother cities were allied and sanctified through Hestia's cult. [[Athenaeus]], in the [[Deipnosophistae]], writes that in [[Naucratis]] the people dined in the [[Prytaneion]] on the natal day of Hestia Prytanitis ({{lang-grc|\u1f19\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03c2 \u03a0\u03c1\u03c5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd\u03af\u03c4\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2}}).<ref>[http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/erudits/athenee/livre4gr.htm#149a Athenaeus, Deipnosophists, 4.149]</ref>\n\nResponsibility for Hestia's domestic cult usually fell to the leading woman of the household, although sometimes to a man. Hestia's rites at the hearths of public buildings were usually led by holders of civil office; [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] testifies that the ''[[prytaneum]]'' of a Greek state or community was sacred to Hestia, who was served by the most powerful state officials.<ref>Kajava, p.&nbsp;5.</ref> However, evidence of her priesthoods is extremely rare. Most stems from the early Roman Imperial era, when [[Sparta]] offers several examples of women with the priestly title \"Hestia\"; [[Chalcis]] offers one, a daughter of the local elite. Existing civic cults to Hestia probably served as stock for the grafting of Greek [[Imperial cult (ancient Rome)#Greek|ruler-cult]] to the Roman emperor, the Imperial family and Rome itself. In Athens, a small seating section at the [[Theatre of Dionysus]] was reserved for priesthoods of \"Hestia on the [[Acropolis]], [[Livia]], and [[Julia the Elder|Julia]]\", and of \"Hestia Romaion\" (\"Roman Hestia\", thus \"The Roman Hearth\" or Vesta). At [[Delos]], a priest served \"Hestia the Athenian [[Glossary of rhetorical terms#Demos|Demos]]\" (the people or state) \"and [[Roma (mythology)|Roma]]\". An eminent citizen of [[Caria]]n [[Stratonicea (Caria)|Stratoniceia]] described himself as a priest of Hestia and several other deities, as well as holding several civic offices. Hestia's political and civic functions are further evidenced by her very numerous privately funded dedications at civic sites, and the administrative rather than religious titles used by the lay-officials involved in her civic cults.<ref>Kajava, pp.&nbsp;1, 3, 5.</ref>\n\n===Temples===\nEvery private and public hearth or ''[[prytaneum]]'' was regarded as a sanctuary of the goddess, and a portion of the sacrifices, to whatever divinity they were offered, belonged to her. A statue of her reportedly existed in the Athenian Prytaneum: \n:\"Hard by is the Prytaneon (Prytaneum) [the town-hall of Athens] . . . and figures are placed of the goddesses [[Eirene (goddess)|Eirene]] and Hestia.\"<ref>Pausanias, Description of Greece 1. 18. 3 (trans. Jones) (Greek travelogue C2nd A.D.)</ref>\nHowever, there were very few temples dedicated to Hestia. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] mention only two, in [[Ermioni]] and in [[Sparta]]: \n:\"[At Hermione in Argolis :] Passing into the sanctuary of Hestia, we see no image, but only an altar, and they sacrifice to Hestia upon it.<ref>Pausanias, Description of Greece 2. 35. 1</ref> [...] The Lakedaimonians (Lacedaemonians) also have a sanctuary of Hestia [at Sparta].\"<ref>Pausanias, Description of Greece 3. 11. 11</ref>\n\n===Hymns and Odes===\nHomeric Hymn&nbsp;24, ''To Hestia'', is a brief invocation of five lines:\n{{quote|Hestia, you who tend the holy house of the lord Apollo, the Far-shooter at goodly [[Delphi|Pytho]], with soft oil dripping ever from your locks, come now into this house, come, having one mind with Zeus the all-wise: draw near, and withal bestow grace upon my song.<ref>[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999.01.0138%3ahymn%3d24 ''Hymn&nbsp;24 to Hestia''].</ref>}}\nHomeric Hymn 29, ''To Hestia'', is another invocation for the goddess and to Hermes:\n{{quote|Hestia, in the  high dwellings of all, both deathless gods and men who walk on earth, you  have gained an everlasting abode and highest honour: glorious is your portion  and your right.

It is a late representation of the goddess, whom it identifies in [[Greek language|Greek]] as ''Hestia Polyolbos''; ({{lang-el|\u1f19\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 \u03a0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd\u03bf\u03bb\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2}} \"Hestia full of Blessings\"). Its history and symbolism are discussed in Friedlander (1945).<ref>Friedlander, Paul. (1945). ''Documents of Dying Paganism''. University of California Press.</ref>\n\n== Mythology ==\n[[File:Hestia - Wellesley College - DSC09634.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Statue of Hestia ([[Wellesley College]], [[Massachusetts]], USA)]]\n\n=== Life ===\n\nHestia is a goddess of the first Olympian generation. She is the eldest daughter of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] [[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]] and [[Cronus|Kronos]], and sister to [[Chiron]], [[Demeter]], [[Hades]], [[Hera]], [[Poseidon]], and [[Zeus]],. Immediately after their birth, [[Cronus|Kronos]] swallowed all his children (Hestia was the first who was swallowed) except the last and youngest, Zeus. Instead, Zeus forced [[Cronus|Kronos]] to disgorge his siblings and led them in a war against their father and the other Titans.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0020.tlg001.perseus-eng1:453-491 453&nbsp;ff.]</ref> As \"first to be devoured .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the last to be yielded up again\", Hestia is thus both the eldest and youngest daughter; this mythic inversion is found in the [[Homeric Hymns|Homeric hymn]] to [[Aphrodite]] (700&nbsp;BC).<ref>Kereny, p.&nbsp;91</ref> Throughout mythology, Hestia rejected the marriage suits of [[Poseidon]] and [[Apollo]], and swore herself to perpetual virginity. She thus rejected Aphrodite's values and becomes, to some extent, her chaste, domestic complementary, or antithesis, since [[Aphrodite]] could not bend or ensnare her heart.<ref name=\"Homeric Hymns, To Aphrodite\"/>\n\n===Duty===\nZeus assigned Hestia a duty to feed and maintain the fires of the Olympian hearth with the fatty, combustible portions of animal sacrifices to the gods.<ref>Kajava, pp.&nbsp;1\u20132.</ref> Wherever food was cooked, or an offering was burnt, she thus had her share of honour; also, in all the temples of the gods she has a share of honour. \"Among all mortals she was chief of the goddesses\".<ref name=\"Homeric Hymns, To Aphrodite\">{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/HomericHymns3.html |title=Homeric Hymns, To Aphrodite}}</ref>\n\n=== Status and Attributes ===\nHestia's Olympian status is equivocal to her status among men. However, at Athens, \"in Plato's time,\" notes Kenneth Dorter<ref>Dorter, K. (1971). Imagery and Philosophy in Plato's Phaedrus. ''Journal of the History of Philosophy'', ''9''&nbsp;(3), 279\u2013288 (July 1971).</ref> \"there was a discrepancy in the list of the [[Twelve Olympians|twelve chief gods]], as to whether Hestia or [[Dionysus]] was included with the other eleven. The altar to them at the agora, for example, included Hestia, but the east frieze of the Parthenon had Dionysus instead.\" Hestia's omission from some lists of the Twelve Olympians is sometimes taken as illustration of her passive, non-confrontational nature \u2013 by giving her Olympian seat to the more forceful Dionysus she prevents heavenly conflict \u2013 but no ancient source or myth describes such a surrender or removal.<ref>Kereny, p.&nbsp;92: \"there is no story of Hestia's ever having taken a husband or ever having been removed from her fixed abode.\"</ref> \"Since the hearth is immovable Hestia is unable to take part even in the procession of the gods, let alone the other antics of the Olympians\", Burkert remarks.<ref>Burkert, p.&nbsp;170.</ref> Her mythographic status as firstborn of Rhea and Cronus seems to justify the tradition in which a small offering is made to Hestia before any sacrifice (\"Hestia comes first\").\n\nThis is not so for every Greek in every generation. In ''Odyssey''&nbsp;''14'', 432\u2013436, the loyal swineherd [[Eumaeus]] begins the feast for his master Odysseus by plucking tufts from a boar's head and throwing them into the fire with a prayer addressed to all the powers, then carved the meat into seven equal portions: \"one he set aside, lifting up a prayer to the forest [[nymph]]s and [[Hermes]], [[Maia]]'s son.\"<ref>Robert Fagles' translation</ref>\n\nThe ambiguities in Hestia's mythology match her indeterminate attributes, character, and iconography. She is identified with the hearth as a physical object, and the abstractions of community and domesticity, but portrayals of her are rare and seldom secure.<ref>Kajava, p.&nbsp;2.</ref> In classical Greek art, she is occasionally depicted as a woman, simply and modestly cloaked in a head veil. At times, it shows her with a staff in hand or by a large fire. She sits on a plain wooden throne with a white woolen cushion and did not trouble to choose an emblem for herself.<ref name=\"Graves\"/>\n\n===Equivalency===\nHer Roman equivalent is [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]];<ref name=Lar>Hughes, James. (1995). ''Larousse Desk Reference Encyclopedia'', p.&nbsp;215. Larousse/[[The Book People]].</ref> [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] has similar functions as a divine personification of Rome's \"public\", domestic, and colonial hearths, binding Romans together within a form of extended family. The similarity of names between Hestia and Vesta is, however, misleading: \"The relationship ''hestia-histie-Vesta'' cannot be explained in terms of [[Indo-European studies|Indo-European]] linguistics; borrowings from a third language must also be involved,\" according to [[Walter Burkert]].<ref>Burkert,  p. 415, 3.3.1 n.&nbsp;2.</ref>\nOther mythology and religion show similar goddesses or figures. [[Herodotus]] equates the [[Scythian religion|Scythian]] [[Tabiti]] with Hestia. And, the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] holy fire (''[[atar]]'') of the [[Sasanians]] in [[Takht-e Soleym\u0101n|Adhur Gushnasp]] was also equated with Hestia by [[Procopius]].<ref>Procopius, ''History of the Wars'', Book II, XXIV</ref>\n\n==Genealogy==\n{{chart top|Hestia's family tree&nbsp;<ref>This chart is based upon [[Hesiod]]'s ''[[Theogony]]'', unless otherwise noted.</ref>|collapsed=no}}\n{{chart/start}}\n{{chart|}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | | | |URA |y|GAI |URA=[[Uranus (mythology)|Uranus]]|GAI=[[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.}}\n{{chart|URA| | | | | | | | |CRO |y|RHE |URA=<small>Uranus'&nbsp;genitals</small>|CRO=[[Cronus]]|RHE=[[Rhea (mythology)|Rhea]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | |,|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|v|-|^|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|v|-|-|-|.}}\n{{chart| |!| |ZEU |V|~|~|y|~|HER | |POS | |HAD | |DEM | |HES |ZEU=[[Zeus]]|HER=[[Hera]]|POS=[[Poseidon]]|HAD=[[Hades]]|DEM=[[Demeter]]|HES='''HESTIA'''}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:| |,|^|-|.| |!}}\n{{chart|border=0| |!| | | | |:| |!| |AAA |!|AAA= &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a <ref>According to [[Homer]], ''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:1.570 1.570&ndash;579],  [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:14.338 14.338], ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:8.312 8.312], Hephaestus was apparently the son of Hera and Zeus, see Gantz, p. 74.</ref>}}\n{{chart|border=0| |!| | | | |:| |!| | |!|BBB |BBB=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b <ref>According to Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+927 927&ndash;929], Hephaestus was produced by Hera alone, with no father, see Gantz, p. 74.</ref>}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:| |!| | |!| |!}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:|ARE | |HEP |HEP=[[Hephaestus]]|ARE=[[Ares]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |D|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|MET |MET=[[Metis (mythology)|Metis]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:| | |ATH |ATH=[[Athena]] <ref>According to Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+886 886&ndash;890], of Zeus' children by his seven wives, Athena was the first to be conceived, but the last to be born; Zeus impregnated Metis then swallowed her, later Zeus himself gave birth to Athena \"from his head\", see Gantz, pp. 51&ndash;52, 83&ndash;84.</ref>}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |D|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|LET |LET=[[Leto]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:| |,|-|^|-|.}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:|APO | |ART |APO=[[Apollo]]|ART=[[Artemis]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |D|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|MAI |MAI=[[Maia (mythology)|Maia]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:| | |HER |HER=[[Hermes]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |D|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|~|SEM |SEM=[[Semele]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |:| | |DIO |DIO=[[Dionysus]]}}\n{{chart| |!| | | | |L|~|~|~|~|y|~|~|~|DIO |DIO=[[Dione (Titaness)|Dione]]}}\n{{chart|border=0|AAA | | | | | | | |BBB|AAA=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a <ref>According to Hesiod, ''[[Theogony]]'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hes.+Th.+183 183&ndash;200], Aphrodite was born from Uranus' severed genitals, see Gantz, pp. 99&ndash;100.</ref>|BBB=&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b <ref>According to [[Homer]], Aphrodite was the daughter of Zeus (''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:3.374 3.374], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:20.105 20.105]; ''[[Odyssey]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:8.308 8.308], [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg002.perseus-eng1:8.320 320]) and Dione (''[[Iliad]]'' [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0012.tlg001.perseus-eng1:5.370 5.370&ndash;71]), see Gantz, pp. 99&ndash;100.</ref>}}\n{{chart| |`|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| |!}}\n{{chart| | | | | | | | | |APH |APH=[[Aphrodite]]}}\n{{chart/end}}\n{{chart bottom}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ancient Greece|Myths|Religion}}\n* [[Sacred fire of Vesta]]\n* [[Vitex agnus-castus]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* [[Walter Burkert|Burkert, Walter]].
