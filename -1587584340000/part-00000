Unlike the ''S Club 7'' shows which focused upon the band's fictional exploits, ''I Dream'' saw S Club 8 as members of a larger ensemble cast. ''I Dream'' revolved around the summer school Avalon Heights, run by Professor Toone (played by [[Christopher Lloyd]]), where the characters tried to improve on their talents in the performing arts. The show featured many songs and dances: normally two songs per episode. S Club 8 split up in early 2005.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2006, following the split of S Club 8, Humes presented the [[BBC]] children's TV programme ''[[Smile (UK TV series)|Smile]]'' which was her first presenting role. The programme aired on Sunday mornings on [[BBC Two]]. Humes left the programme in 2006 for unknown reasons and the programme was axed soon after.\n\nIn late October 2006, Humes was part of a group called The TigerLilys, who had a MySpace page displaying two tracks. The group disbanded without being signed by a label or releasing any material commercially. In February 2007, Humes appeared briefly on ''[[Never Mind The Buzzcocks]]'' as part of the show's regular Identity Parade feature, where contestants guess which person out of a line-up of five was featured in an old music video played only to the audience and viewers. The team, consisting of [[Bill Bailey]], [[Russell Howard]] and [[Romeo Stodart]] (from the band [[The Magic Numbers]]), correctly picked Humes from the line-up. On 22 October 2009, after finding fame again with The Saturdays, Humes returned to appear as a guest on ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks'' on [[Phill Jupitus]]' team.<ref name=\"Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22\">[[List of Never Mind the Buzzcocks episodes#Series 22|Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22]]</ref>\n\n===2007\u20132014: The Saturdays===\n[[File:The Saturdays LA3.jpg|thumb|left|Humes performing in L.A. in December 2009.]]\nSince 2007, Humes has been a member of girl group [[The Saturdays]], whose other members are [[Una Healy]], [[Mollie King]], [[Vanessa White]], and fellow former S Club 8 member [[Frankie Bridge]]. The Saturdays made their chart debut in July 2008 with \"[[If This Is Love (The Saturdays song)|If This Is Love]]\", which reached the top ten in the United Kingdom. Its follow-up single \"[[Up (The Saturdays song)|Up]]\" was released in October 2008, and the song debuted at number-five on the [[UK Singles Chart]]; to date the single has sold 310,000 copies in the UK alone as well as staying in the charts for exclusive 30 weeks.<ref name=\"Sales\">{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzjack.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=109889 |title=Board Message |publisher=Buzzjack.com |accessdate=31 August 2013}}</ref> The band's debut studio album, ''[[Chasing Lights]]'' (2008) reached the top ten on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and was awarded Platinum selling status by the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI). The album also saw release from top ten singles on the UK Singles Chart\u2014\"[[Issues (The Saturdays song)|Issues]]\" and \"[[Just Can't Get Enough (The Saturdays song)|Just Can't Get Enough]]\". \"[[Work (The Saturdays song)|Work]]\" was the final single to be released from ''Chasing Lights''. ''[[Wordshaker]]'' (2009) was the band's follow-up studio album and also charted within the top ten on the UK Albums Chart and went on to gain a Silver selling status, with singles \"[[Forever Is Over]]\" and \"[[Ego (The Saturdays song)|Ego]]\" charting within the top ten on the UK Singles Chart.

Unlike the ''S Club 7'' shows which focused upon the band's fictional exploits, ''I Dream'' saw S Club 8 as members of a larger ensemble cast. ''I Dream'' revolved around the summer school Avalon Heights, run by Professor Toone (played by [[Christopher Lloyd]]), where the characters tried to improve on their talents in the performing arts. The show featured many songs and dances: normally two songs per episode. S Club 8 split up in early 2005.\n\nBetween 2005 and 2006, following the split of S Club 8, Humes presented the [[BBC]] children's TV programme ''[[Smile (UK TV series)|Smile]]'' which was her first presenting role. The programme aired on Sunday mornings on [[BBC Two]]. Humes left the programme in 2006 for unknown reasons and the programme was axed soon after.\n\nIn late October 2006, Humes was part of a group called The TigerLilys, who had a MySpace page displaying two tracks. The group disbanded without being signed by a label or releasing any material commercially. In February 2007, Humes appeared briefly on ''[[Never Mind The Buzzcocks]]'' as part of the show's regular Identity Parade feature, where contestants guess which person out of a line-up of five was featured in an old music video played only to the audience and viewers. The team, consisting of [[Bill Bailey]], [[Russell Howard]] and [[Romeo Stodart]] (from the band [[The Magic Numbers]]), correctly picked Humes from the line-up. On 22 October 2009, after finding fame again with The Saturdays, Humes returned to appear as a guest on ''Never Mind the Buzzcocks'' on [[Phill Jupitus]]' team.<ref name=\"Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22\">[[List of Never Mind the Buzzcocks episodes#Series 22|Never Mind the Buzzcocks Series 22]]</ref>\n\n===2007\u20132014: The Saturdays===\n[[File:The Saturdays LA3.jpg|thumb|left|Humes performing in L.A. in December 2009.]]\nSince 2007, Humes has been a member of girl group [[The Saturdays]], whose other members are [[Una Healy]], [[Mollie King]], [[Vanessa White]], and fellow former S Club 8 member [[Frankie Bridge]]. The Saturdays made their chart debut in July 2008 with \"[[If This Is Love (The Saturdays song)|If This Is Love]]\", which reached the top ten in the United Kingdom.

Visual art is often referenced in her work and ''Charis in the World of Wonders,'' ''The Book of the Red King,'' ''Thaliad,'' ''The Foliate Head, Glimmerglass, and Maze of Blood'' were collaborations with the artist [[Clive Hicks-Jenkins]] with decorations throughout the texts.

South Carolina]]) is an American poet, novelist and short story writer. Her work reflects certain recurring themes such as nature, magic, faith and redemption, and often references visual art.\n\n== Background ==\nMarly Youmans grew up in [[Louisiana]], [[North Carolina]], and elsewhere. She currently lives in the village of [[Cooperstown, New York]], with her husband and three children. She graduated from [[Hollins College]], [[Brown University]], and [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].  She taught at [[State University of New York]] but quit academia after receiving promotion and tenure in her fifth year.<ref>{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xxd451POnpYC&pg=PT485&dq=Marly+Youmans&cd=5#v=onepage&q=Marly%20Youmans&f=false| title=Southern writers: a new biographical dictionary| editors=Joseph M. Flora, Amber Vogel, Bryan Albin Giemza| publisher=LSU Press| year= 2006| isbn=978-0-8071-3123-7 }}</ref>\n\n== Writing ==\nHer published work consists of five books of poetry, eight novels and two fantasies for young readers, as well as uncollected short stories, essays and poems. Across all these idioms, her work displays a commitment to rhythm, the sound of words, imagery and complexity of form and allusion. ''Thaliad'', for example, is an epic poem that tells a compelling story of children who survive an apocalypse to begin a new society, written as though a spoken history remembranced in blank verse a generation on. Her novels have been described as 'literary fiction at its finest' in ''Books and Culture''<ref>[http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/webexclusives/2012/may/whitecamellia.html Linda McCullough Moore, Books and Culture, May 2012]</ref> while ''The Advocate'' has cited her skill at mastering poetic forms.<ref>[http://theadvocate.com/utility/homepagestories/4857392-129/poets-invite-readers-to-share Greg Langley, ''The Advocate'', 30 January 2013]</ref> The editor of Books and Culture says, \"Youmans (pronounced like 'yeoman' with an 's' added) is the best-kept secret among contemporary American writers.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Top Ten Books of 2003|url = http://www.booksandculture.com/articles/webexclusives/2003/december/031222.html|website = Books and Culture|access-date = 2016-01-29}}</ref>\n\nHer books demonstrate a number of continuing interests: in lives lived close to nature, whether in the past (''Catherwood'') or the future (''Thaliad''), magic, faith and redemption (''Val/Orson'', ''The Foliate Head'') and the individual\u2019s journey from youth to adulthood (''Inglewood'', ''A Death at the White Camelia Orphanage''). Visual art is often referenced in her work and ''Charis in the World of Wonders,'' ''The Book of the Red King,'' ''Thaliad,'' ''The Foliate Head, Glimmerglass, and Maze of Blood'' were collaborations with the artist [[Clive Hicks-Jenkins]] with decorations throughout the texts. She provided the title poems for an illustrated anthology, ''The Book of Ystwyth: Six Poets on the Art of Clive Hicks-Jenkins''.<ref>Bonta, Dave, Callum James, Andrea Selch, Catriona Urquhart, Damian Walford Davies and Marly Youmans, ''The Book of Ystwyth: Six Poets on the Art of Clive Hicks-Jenkins'' (2011: Carolina Wren Press) {{ISBN|978-0-932112-89-7}}\n</ref>\n\n== Awards ==\nYoumans has been awarded many \"book of the year\" and \"best of the year\" citations by magazines, newspapers, and organizations.
