Shapiro]] as \"the most prominent etymological riddle of our time\".<ref name=Shapiro/>\n\nThe ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' finds the earliest published non-idiomatic use in an 1855 [[Indiana]] newspaper article. The earliest known idiomatic use of the phrase is from 1907 in [[Southern Indiana]]. The phrase is related to the expression ''the whole six yards'', used around the same time in [[Kentucky]] and [[South Carolina]]. Both phrases are variations on ''the whole ball of wax'', first recorded in the 1880s.<ref name=Nunberg/> They are part of a family of expressions in which an odd-sounding item, such as ''enchilada'', ''shooting match'', ''shebang'' or ''hog'', is substituted for ''ball of wax''.<ref name=Nunberg/> The choice of the number nine may be related to the expression \"[[To the nines]]\" (to perfection).<ref group=nb>The phrase \"to the nines\" is first recorded in 1687. In early usage, it suggested that a work met the standards of the nine [[Muses]] of Greek mythology. Nine is considered a perfect number in [[numerology]] as it is three squared. Note that the phrase \"cloud seven\" was inflated to \"cloud nine\" by the same process. See ''[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/dressed-to-the-nines.html The Phrase Finder]'' and ''Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang''.  Dressing \"To the Nines\" could also refer to the fact that in French \"neuf\" means both 9 and New (\"Mes souliers sont neuf\" = \"My shoes are new\"). So, \"dressing to the nines\" would mean dressing in a new outfit (\"neuf\").</ref>\n\nUse of the phrase became widespread in the 1980s and 1990s. Much of the interest in the phrase's [[etymology]] can be attributed to ''New York Times'' language columnist [[William Safire]], who wrote extensively on this question.\n\n==History of the phrase==\nThe ''Oxford English Dictionary'' places the earliest published non-idiomatic use of the phrase in the ''New Albany Daily Ledger'' ([[New Albany, Indiana]], January 30, 1855) in an article called \"The Judge's Big Shirt.\" \"What a silly, stupid woman! I told her to get just enough to make three shirts; instead of making three, she has put the whole nine yards into one shirt!\" The first known use of the phrase as an idiom appears in ''The Mitchell Commercial'', a newspaper in the small town of [[Mitchell, Indiana]], in its May 2, 1907 edition:\n\n<blockquote>This afternoon at 2:30 will be called one of the baseball games that will be worth going a long way to see.  The regular nine is going to play the business men as many innings as they can stand, but we can not promise the full nine yards.<ref>\"Baseball\", ''Mitchell Commercial'', p. 2,col. 3 (May 2, 1907).</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe idiom was used three more times in the ''Mitchell Commercial'' over the next seven years, in the forms ''give him the whole nine yards'' (i.e., tell someone a big story),<ref>''Mitchell Commercial'', p. 3, col. 5 (June 4, 1908).</ref> ''take the whole nine yards'' (i.e., take everything),<ref>\"Third Term Superstition\", ''Mitchell Commercial'' p. 2, col. 2 (October 10, 1912).</ref> and ''settled the whole nine yards'' (i.e., resolved everything).<ref>\"Story of a Green Basket,\" ''Mitchell Commercial'' p. 1, col. 5 (November 26, 1914).</ref>\n\nIn other uses from this time period, the phrase was given as ''the whole six yards''. In 1912, a local newspaper in Kentucky asked readers to, \"Just wait boys until the fix gets to a fever heat and they will tell the whole six yards.\"<ref name=Vernon/> The same newspaper repeated the phrase soon afterward in another issue, stating \"As we have been gone for a few days and failed to get all the news for this issue we will give you the whole six yards in our next.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%252024%2FMount%2520Vernon%2520KY%2520Signal%2FMount%2520Vernon%2520KY%2520Signal%25201912-06-28%2520Page%25201%2520.pdf%23xml%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.fultonhistory.com%2FdtSearch%2Fdtisapi6.dll%3Fcmd%3Dgetpdfhits%26u%3D397f095d%26DocId%3D71362%26Index%3DZ%253a%255cDISK%2520X%26HitCount%3D3%26hits%3D835%2B836%2B837%2B%26SearchForm%3D%252fFulton%255fNew%255fform%252ehtml%26.pdf&uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%252024%2FMount%2520Vernon%2520KY%2520Signal%2FMount%2520Vernon%2520KY%2520Signal%25201912-06-28%2520Page%25201%2520.pdf&xml=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fultonhistory.com%2FdtSearch%2Fdtisapi6.dll%3Fcmd%3Dgetpdfhits%26u%3D397f095d%26DocId%3D71362%26Index%3DZ%253a%255cDISK%2520X%26HitCount%3D3%26hits%3D835%2B836%2B837%2B%26SearchForm%3D%252fFulton%255fNew%255fform%252ehtml%26.pdf&openFirstHlPage=false|title=Mount Vernon Signal Newspaper|last=|first=|date=June 28, 1912|website=Old Fulton NY Post Cards|access-date=June 11, 2017}}</ref> The six-yard form of the phrase also appears in a 1921 headline in a local South Carolina paper.<ref name=\"Spartanburg\" />\n\nThe phrase is not known to have been used in writing thereafter until a 1956 issue of ''Kentucky Happy Hunting Ground'', where it appears in an article on fishing.<ref name=schuessler/><ref name=Zimmer/> After describing the contests and prizes, the author writes, \"So that's the whole nine-yards.\"<ref name=Rhody/><ref name=Holtmann/> It appeared in an article on hunting the following year, this time unhyphenated.<ref name=Zimmer/>\n\nThe phrase at this point was still rare.

There are many versions of this explanation with variations regarding type of plane, nationality of gunner and geographic area. An alternative weapon is the ammunition belt for the British Vickers machine gun, invented and adopted by the British Army before [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918). The standard belt for this gun held 250 rounds of ammunition and was approximately twenty feet (under seven yards) in length. <ref name=schuessler/> However, the Vickers gun as fitted to aircraft during the First World War usually had ammunition containers capable of accommodating linked belts of 350-400 rounds, the average length of such a belt being about nine yards, and it was thought that this may be the origin of the phrase. <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Grand Old Lady of No Man's Land, The Vickers Machinegun|last=Goldsmith|first=Dolf L|publisher=Collector Grade Publications Inc.|year=1994|isbn=0-88935-147-3|location=Cobourg, Ontario, Canada|pages=132}}</ref> This theory is no longer considered viable, since the phrase predates World War I.\n* Another common explanation is that \"nine yards\" is a cubic measure and refers to the volume of a [[concrete mixer]].<ref name=\"Wilton1\"/> This theory, too, is inconsistent with the phrase's history.<ref name=schuessler/>\n* Other proposed sources include the volume of [[graves (burial)|graves]];<ref name=\"Wilton3\"/> ritual [[disembowelment]]; shipyards; and [[American football]]. Little documentary evidence has surfaced to support any of these explanations.<ref name=\"Wilton6\"/>\n* One proposed origin involves the world of [[Full-rigged ship|full-rigged sailing ships]], in which [[Yard (sailing)|yard]] is used not as a measure of length or size, but as the name of each horizontal [[spar (sailing)|spar]] on which a sail is hung.  All [[Square rig|square-rigged]] sails unfurled, with 3 yards on each of 3 masts, could then be described as ''the whole nine yards'',<ref>[http://www.sailorschoice.com/terms/scphrases.htm Nautical Terms Index]</ref><ref>[http://see-the-sea.org/nautical/naut-body.htm Nautical Language]</ref> but again no actual documentation has been uncovered to support this explanation, and in any case not all ships had exactly three yards on each mast, even disregarding the fact that by no means all sailing vessels were three-masters. <ref name=\"Wilton5\"/>\n* Bonnie Taylor-Blake, noting that several early examples are in the form \"give\" or \"tell\" the whole nine (or six) yards, has suggested that the idiom likely relied on \"yards\" as \"lengthy or thorough presentation [of news, anecdotes, play-by-play, etc.]\"<ref>[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1212D&L=ADS-L&P=R2904 Bonnie Taylor-Blake, Front-page ''New York Times'' story on \"The Whole Nine Yards\", ADS-L (December 27, 2012)] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130908071543/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1212D&L=ADS-L&P=R2904 |date=September 8, 2013 }}.</ref>\n* [[Jesse Sheidlower]], editor-at-large for the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', and [[Fred R.

Both phrases are variations on ''the whole ball of wax'', first recorded in the 1880s.<ref name=Nunberg/> They are part of a family of expressions in which an odd-sounding item, such as ''enchilada'', ''shooting match'', ''shebang'' or ''hog'', is substituted for ''ball of wax''.<ref name=Nunberg/> The choice of the number nine may be related to the expression \"[[To the nines]]\" (to perfection).<ref group=nb>The phrase \"to the nines\" is first recorded in 1687. In early usage, it suggested that a work met the standards of the nine [[Muses]] of Greek mythology. Nine is considered a perfect number in [[numerology]] as it is three squared. Note that the phrase \"cloud seven\" was inflated to \"cloud nine\" by the same process. See ''[http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/dressed-to-the-nines.html The Phrase Finder]'' and ''Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang''.  Dressing \"To the Nines\" could also refer to the fact that in French \"neuf\" means both 9 and New (\"Mes souliers sont neuf\" = \"My shoes are new\"). So, \"dressing to the nines\" would mean dressing in a new outfit (\"neuf\").</ref>\n\nUse of the phrase became widespread in the 1980s and 1990s. Much of the interest in the phrase's [[etymology]] can be attributed to ''New York Times'' language columnist [[William Safire]], who wrote extensively on this question.\n\n==History of the phrase==\nThe ''Oxford English Dictionary'' places the earliest published non-idiomatic use of the phrase in the ''New Albany Daily Ledger'' ([[New Albany, Indiana]], January 30, 1855) in an article called \"The Judge's Big Shirt.\" \"What a silly, stupid woman! I told her to get just enough to make three shirts; instead of making three, she has put the whole nine yards into one shirt!\" The first known use of the phrase as an idiom appears in ''The Mitchell Commercial'', a newspaper in the small town of [[Mitchell, Indiana]], in its May 2, 1907 edition:\n\n<blockquote>This afternoon at 2:30 will be called one of the baseball games that will be worth going a long way to see.  The regular nine is going to play the business men as many innings as they can stand, but we can not promise the full nine yards.<ref>\"Baseball\", ''Mitchell Commercial'', p. 2,col. 3 (May 2, 1907).</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe idiom was used three more times in the ''Mitchell Commercial'' over the next seven years, in the forms ''give him the whole nine yards'' (i.e., tell someone a big story),<ref>''Mitchell Commercial'', p. 3, col. 5 (June 4, 1908).</ref> ''take the whole nine yards'' (i.e., take everything),<ref>\"Third Term Superstition\", ''Mitchell Commercial'' p. 2, col. 2 (October 10, 1912).</ref> and ''settled the whole nine yards'' (i.e., resolved everything).<ref>\"Story of a Green Basket,\" ''Mitchell Commercial'' p. 1, col. 5 (November 26, 1914).</ref>\n\nIn other uses from this time period, the phrase was given as ''the whole six yards''. In 1912, a local newspaper in Kentucky asked readers to, \"Just wait boys until the fix gets to a fever heat and they will tell the whole six yards.\"<ref name=Vernon/> The same newspaper repeated the phrase soon afterward in another issue, stating \"As we have been gone for a few days and failed to get all the news for this issue we will give you the whole six yards in our next.\" <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fultonhistory.com/highlighter/highlight-for-xml?altUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%252024%2FMount%2520Vernon%2520KY%2520Signal%2FMount%2520Vernon%2520KY%2520Signal%25201912-06-28%2520Page%25201%2520.pdf%23xml%3Dhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.fultonhistory.com%2FdtSearch%2Fdtisapi6.dll%3Fcmd%3Dgetpdfhits%26u%3D397f095d%26DocId%3D71362%26Index%3DZ%253a%255cDISK%2520X%26HitCount%3D3%26hits%3D835%2B836%2B837%2B%26SearchForm%3D%252fFulton%255fNew%255fform%252ehtml%26.pdf&uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fultonhistory.com%2FNewspaper%252024%2FMount%2520Vernon%2520KY%2520Signal%2FMount%2520Vernon%2520KY%2520Signal%25201912-06-28%2520Page%25201%2520.pdf&xml=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fultonhistory.com%2FdtSearch%2Fdtisapi6.dll%3Fcmd%3Dgetpdfhits%26u%3D397f095d%26DocId%3D71362%26Index%3DZ%253a%255cDISK%2520X%26HitCount%3D3%26hits%3D835%2B836%2B837%2B%26SearchForm%3D%252fFulton%255fNew%255fform%252ehtml%26.pdf&openFirstHlPage=false|title=Mount Vernon Signal Newspaper|last=|first=|date=June 28, 1912|website=Old Fulton NY Post Cards|access-date=June 11, 2017}}</ref> The six-yard form of the phrase also appears in a 1921 headline in a local South Carolina paper.<ref name=\"Spartanburg\" />\n\nThe phrase is not known to have been used in writing thereafter until a 1956 issue of ''Kentucky Happy Hunting Ground'', where it appears in an article on fishing.<ref name=schuessler/><ref name=Zimmer/> After describing the contests and prizes, the author writes, \"So that's the whole nine-yards.\"<ref name=Rhody/><ref name=Holtmann/> It appeared in an article on hunting the following year, this time unhyphenated.<ref name=Zimmer/>\n\nThe phrase at this point was still rare.

There are many versions of this explanation with variations regarding type of plane, nationality of gunner and geographic area. An alternative weapon is the ammunition belt for the British Vickers machine gun, invented and adopted by the British Army before [[World War I]] (1914\u20131918). The standard belt for this gun held 250 rounds of ammunition and was approximately twenty feet (under seven yards) in length. <ref name=schuessler/> However, the Vickers gun as fitted to aircraft during the First World War usually had ammunition containers capable of accommodating linked belts of 350-400 rounds, the average length of such a belt being about nine yards, and it was thought that this may be the origin of the phrase. <ref>{{Cite book|title=The Grand Old Lady of No Man's Land, The Vickers Machinegun|last=Goldsmith|first=Dolf L|publisher=Collector Grade Publications Inc.|year=1994|isbn=0-88935-147-3|location=Cobourg, Ontario, Canada|pages=132}}</ref> This theory is no longer considered viable, since the phrase predates World War I.\n* Another common explanation is that \"nine yards\" is a cubic measure and refers to the volume of a [[concrete mixer]].<ref name=\"Wilton1\"/> This theory, too, is inconsistent with the phrase's history.<ref name=schuessler/>\n* Other proposed sources include the volume of [[graves (burial)|graves]];<ref name=\"Wilton3\"/> ritual [[disembowelment]]; shipyards; and [[American football]]. Little documentary evidence has surfaced to support any of these explanations.<ref name=\"Wilton6\"/>\n* One proposed origin involves the world of [[Full-rigged ship|full-rigged sailing ships]], in which [[Yard (sailing)|yard]] is used not as a measure of length or size, but as the name of each horizontal [[spar (sailing)|spar]] on which a sail is hung.  All [[Square rig|square-rigged]] sails unfurled, with 3 yards on each of 3 masts, could then be described as ''the whole nine yards'',<ref>[http://www.sailorschoice.com/terms/scphrases.htm Nautical Terms Index]</ref><ref>[http://see-the-sea.org/nautical/naut-body.htm Nautical Language]</ref> but again no actual documentation has been uncovered to support this explanation, and in any case not all ships had exactly three yards on each mast, even disregarding the fact that by no means all sailing vessels were three-masters. <ref name=\"Wilton5\"/>\n* Bonnie Taylor-Blake, noting that several early examples are in the form \"give\" or \"tell\" the whole nine (or six) yards, has suggested that the idiom likely relied on \"yards\" as \"lengthy or thorough presentation [of news, anecdotes, play-by-play, etc.]\"<ref>[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1212D&L=ADS-L&P=R2904 Bonnie Taylor-Blake, Front-page ''New York Times'' story on \"The Whole Nine Yards\", ADS-L (December 27, 2012)] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130908071543/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind1212D&L=ADS-L&P=R2904 |date=September 8, 2013 }}.</ref>\n* [[Jesse Sheidlower]], editor-at-large for the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', and [[Fred R.

The aryl selenium anion displaces [[triphenylphosphine oxide|tributylphosphine oxide]] forming the alkyl aryl selenide species. The selenide is then treated with excess hydrogen peroxide leading to the selenoxide which eliminates the \u03b2-hydrogen through a 5-member cyclic transition state, yielding an alkene.\n\n[[File:Grieco elimination mechanism.png|550px|center|frameless]]\n \nThe [[Electrophilic aromatic directing groups|electron-withdrawing]] [[Nitro compound|nitro group]] was found to increase both the rate of elimination and the final yield of the olefin.\n\n==Nitrogen Based==\n\n===Cope Elimination===\nThe [[Cope reaction|Cope elimination]] (Cope reaction) is the elimination of a tertiary [[amine oxide]] to yield an alkene and a [[hydroxylamine]] through an E<sub>i</sub> mechanism.<ref name=\"ref12\" /><ref name=ref20>Cope, A.C.; Foster, T.T.; Towle, P.H.

For some sterically hindered molecules the base deprotonates a methyl group on the amine instead of the \u03b2-hydrogen directly, forming an [[ylide]] intermediate which eliminates trimethylamine through a 5-membered transition state, forming the alkene. Deuterium labeling studies confirmed this mechanism by observing the formation of deuterated trimethylamine (and no deuterated water, which would form from the E2 mechanism).<ref name=ref22>Cope, A.C.; Mehta, A.S.
