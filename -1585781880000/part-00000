Kohlberg's work emphasized justice as the key concept in moral reasoning, seen as a primarily cognitive activity, and became the dominant approach to moral psychology, heavily influencing subsequent work.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Donleavy|first=Gabriel|title=No Man's Land: Exploring the Space between Gilligan and Kohlberg|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=July 2008|volume=80|issue=4|pages=807\u2013822|jstor=25482183|doi=10.1007/s10551-007-9470-9}}</ref><ref name=Haidt /> Haidt writes that he found Kohlberg's theories unsatisfying from the time he first encountered them in graduate school because they \"seemed too cerebral\" and lacked a focus on issues of [[emotion]].\n\nIn contrast to the dominant theories of morality in psychology, the anthropologist Richard Shweder developed a set of theories emphasizing the cultural variability of moral judgments, but argued that different cultural forms of morality drew on \"three distinct but coherent clusters of moral concerns\", which he labeled as the ethics of autonomy, community, and divinity.<ref name=\"Shweder1997\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Shweder|first=Richard|author2=Jonathan Haidt|title=Commentary to Feature Review: The Future of Moral Psychology: Truth, Intuition, and the Pluralist Way|journal=Psychological Science|date=November 1993|volume=4|issue=6|pages=360\u2013365|jstor=40062563|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1993.tb00582.x}}</ref> Shweder's approach inspired Haidt to begin researching moral differences across cultures, including fieldwork in Brazil and Philadelphia.<ref name=\"Haidt1993\">{{cite journal |last1=Haidt |first1=Jonathan |last2=Koller |first2=Silvia Helena |last3=Dias |first3=Maria G. |title=Affect, culture, and morality, or is it wrong to eat your dog? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=1993 |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=613\u2013628 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.65.4.613|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/837091f3ac8cc6047833de330315e3f2c46b5af6 }}</ref> This work led Haidt to begin developing his [[Social intuitionism|social intuitionist]] approach to morality. This approach, which stood in sharp contrast to Kohlberg's rationalist work, suggested that \"moral judgment is caused by quick moral intuitions\" while moral reasoning simply serves as a post-hoc rationalization of already formed judgments.<ref name=\"Haidt2001\" /> Haidt's work and his focus on quick, intuitive, emotional judgments quickly became very influential, attracting sustained attention from an array of researchers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Greg|title=The Roots of Morality|journal=Science|date=9 May 2008|volume=320|issue=5877|pages=734\u2013737|doi=10.1126/science.320.5877.734|pmid=18467565}}</ref>\n\nAs Haidt and his collaborators worked within the social intuitionist approach, they began to devote attention to the sources of the intuitions that they believed underlay moral judgments. In a 2004 article published in the journal [[Daedalus (journal)|Daedalus]],<ref name=\"Haidt2004\" /> Haidt and Joseph surveyed works on the roots of morality, including the work of [[Frans de Waal]], [[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald Brown]] and Shweder, as well as [[Alan Fiske|Alan Fiske's]] [[Relational models theory|Relational Models Theory]] and [[Shalom Schwartz|Shalom Schwartz's]] [[Theory of Basic Human Values]]. From their review of these earlier lines of research, they suggested that all individuals possess four \"intuitive ethics\", stemming from the process of [[human evolution]] as responses to adaptive challenges. They labelled these four ethics as suffering, hierarchy, reciprocity, and purity.  According to Haidt and Joseph, each of the ethics formed a [[cognitive module]], whose development was shaped by culture.  They wrote that each module could \"provide little more than flashes of affect when certain patterns are encountered in the social world\", while a cultural learning process shaped each individual's response to these flashes. Morality diverges because different cultures utilize the four \"building blocks\" provided by the modules differently.<ref name=\"Haidt2004\" /> This article became the first statement of moral foundations theory, which Haidt, Joseph, and others have since elaborated and refined.\n\n==The five foundations==\nAccording to Moral Foundations Theory, differences in people's moral concerns can be

ideology===\n[[File:MFQResultsExample2.jpg|thumb|Results of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire]]\nResearchers have found that people's sensitivities to the five/six moral foundations correlate with their political ideologies. Using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire, Haidt and Graham found that libertarians are most sensitive to the proposed Liberty foundation,<ref name=\"Haidt\" /> liberals are most sensitive to the Care and Fairness foundations, while conservatives are equally sensitive to all five/six foundations.<ref name=\"Graham2011\" />  [[Joshua Greene (psychologist)|Joshua Greene]] argued however that liberals tend to emphasise the Care, Fairness and Liberty dimensions; conservatives the Loyalty, Authority and Sanctity dimensions.<ref>R Sapolsky, ''Behave'' (London 2018) p. 450</ref>\n\nAccording to Haidt, the differences have significant implications for political discourse and relations. Because members of two political camps are to a degree blind to one or more of the moral foundations of the others, they may perceive morally driven words or behavior as having another basis\u2014at best self-interested, at worst evil, and thus demonize one another.<ref name=\"Moyers\">{{cite AV media\n | people = Jonathan Haidt, Bill Moyers\n | title = Jonathan Haidt Explains Our Contentious Culture\n | medium = Television production\n | publisher = Public Square Media, Inc.\n | location = Lebanon\n | date = 3 February 2012\n | url = http://billmoyers.com/segment/jonathan-haidt-explains-our-contentious-culture/}}</ref>\n\nHaidt and Graham suggest a compromise can be found to allow liberals and conservatives to see eye-to-eye.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|last2=Graham|first2=Jesse|date=2007-06-01|title=When Morality Opposes Justice: Conservatives Have Moral Intuitions that Liberals may not Recognize|journal=Social Justice Research|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=98\u2013116|doi=10.1007/s11211-007-0034-z|issn=0885-7466}}</ref> They suggest that the five foundations can be used as \"doorway\" to allow liberals to step to the conservative side of the \"wall\" put up between these two political affiliations on major political issues (i.e. legalizing gay marriage). If liberals try to consider the latter three foundations in addition to the former two (therefore adopting all five foundations like conservatives for a brief amount of time) they could understand where the conservatives' viewpoints stem from and long-lasting political issues could finally be settled.\n\nResearchers postulate that the moral foundations arose as solutions to problems common in the [[Evolutionary psychology|ancestral hunter-gatherer environment]], in particular intertribal and intra-tribal conflict. The three foundations emphasized more by conservatives (Loyalty, Authority, Sanctity) bind groups together for greater strength in intertribal competition while the other two foundations balance those tendencies with concern for individuals within the group. With reduced sensitivity to the group moral foundations, progressives tend to promote a more [[universalist]] morality.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sinn | first1 = J.S. | last2 = Hayes | first2 = M.W. | year = 2017 | title = Replacing the Moral Foundations: An Evolutionary\u2010Coalitional Theory of Liberal\u2010Conservative Differences | url = | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = 6| pages = 1043\u20131064 | doi=10.1111/pops.12361}}</ref>\n\n===Cross-cultural differences===\nHaidt's initial field work in Brazil and Philadelphia in 1989,<ref name=\"Haidt1993\" /> and [[Odisha]], India in 1993, showed that moralizing indeed varies among cultures, but less than by social class (e.g. education) and age. Working-class Brazilian children were more likely to consider both taboo violations and infliction of harm to be morally wrong, and universally so.

Kohlberg's work emphasized justice as the key concept in moral reasoning, seen as a primarily cognitive activity, and became the dominant approach to moral psychology, heavily influencing subsequent work.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Donleavy|first=Gabriel|title=No Man's Land: Exploring the Space between Gilligan and Kohlberg|journal=Journal of Business Ethics|date=July 2008|volume=80|issue=4|pages=807\u2013822|jstor=25482183|doi=10.1007/s10551-007-9470-9}}</ref><ref name=Haidt /> Haidt writes that he found Kohlberg's theories unsatisfying from the time he first encountered them in graduate school because they \"seemed too cerebral\" and lacked a focus on issues of [[emotion]].\n\nIn contrast to the dominant theories of morality in psychology, the anthropologist Richard Shweder developed a set of theories emphasizing the cultural variability of moral judgments, but argued that different cultural forms of morality drew on \"three distinct but coherent clusters of moral concerns\", which he labeled as the ethics of autonomy, community, and divinity.<ref name=\"Shweder1997\"/><ref>{{cite journal|last=Shweder|first=Richard|author2=Jonathan Haidt|title=Commentary to Feature Review: The Future of Moral Psychology: Truth, Intuition, and the Pluralist Way|journal=Psychological Science|date=November 1993|volume=4|issue=6|pages=360\u2013365|jstor=40062563|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.1993.tb00582.x}}</ref> Shweder's approach inspired Haidt to begin researching moral differences across cultures, including fieldwork in Brazil and Philadelphia. This work led Haidt to begin developing his [[Social intuitionism|social intuitionist]] approach to morality. This approach, which stood in sharp contrast to Kohlberg's rationalist work, suggested that \"moral judgment is caused by quick moral intuitions\" while moral reasoning simply serves as a post-hoc rationalization of already formed judgments.<ref name=\"Haidt2001\" /> Haidt's work and his focus on quick, intuitive, emotional judgments quickly became very influential, attracting sustained attention from an array of researchers.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Greg|title=The Roots of Morality|journal=Science|date=9 May 2008|volume=320|issue=5877|pages=734\u2013737|doi=10.1126/science.320.5877.734|pmid=18467565}}</ref>\n\nAs Haidt and his collaborators worked within the social intuitionist approach, they began to devote attention to the sources of the intuitions that they believed underlay moral judgments. In a 2004 article published in the journal [[Daedalus (journal)|Daedalus]],<ref name=\"Haidt2004\" /> Haidt and Joseph surveyed works on the roots of morality, including the work of [[Frans de Waal]], [[Donald Brown (anthropologist)|Donald Brown]] and Shweder, as well as [[Alan Fiske|Alan Fiske's]] [[Relational models theory|Relational Models Theory]] and [[Shalom Schwartz|Shalom Schwartz's]] [[Theory of Basic Human Values]]. From their review of these earlier lines of research, they suggested that all individuals possess four \"intuitive ethics\", stemming from the process of [[human evolution]] as responses to adaptive challenges. They labelled these four ethics as suffering, hierarchy, reciprocity, and purity.  According to Haidt and Joseph, each of the ethics formed a [[cognitive module]], whose development was shaped by culture.  They wrote that each module could \"provide little more than flashes of affect when certain patterns are encountered in the social world\", while a cultural learning process shaped each individual's response to these flashes. Morality diverges because different cultures utilize the four \"building blocks\" provided by the modules differently.<ref name=\"Haidt2004\" /> This article became the first statement of moral foundations theory, which Haidt, Joseph, and others have since elaborated and refined.\n\n==The five foundations==\nAccording to Moral Foundations Theory, differences in people's moral concerns can be described in terms of five moral foundations:\n* ''Care'': cherishing and protecting others; opposite of ''harm''\n* ''Fairness'' or ''proportionality'': rendering justice according to shared rules; opposite of ''cheating''\n* ''Loyalty'' or ''ingroup'': standing with your [[Ingroups_and_outgroups|group]], family, nation; opposite of ''betrayal''\n* ''Authority'' or ''respect'': submitting to tradition and legitimate authority; opposite of ''subversion''\n* ''Sanctity'' or ''purity'': abhorrence for disgusting things, foods, actions; opposite of ''degradation''\n\nThese five foundations are argued to group into two higher-order clusters \u2013 the person-focused ''Individualizing'' cluster of Care and Fairness, and the group-focused ''Binding'' cluster of Loyalty, Authority and Sanctity.<ref name= \"Graham2009\" /><ref name=\"Haidt&Graham2009\">{{cite book |last1=Haidt |first1=Jonathan |last2=Graham |first2=Jesse |editor1-last=Jost |editor1-first=John |editor2-last=Kay

ideology===\n[[File:MFQResultsExample2.jpg|thumb|Results of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire]]\nResearchers have found that people's sensitivities to the five/six moral foundations correlate with their political ideologies. Using the Moral Foundations Questionnaire, Haidt and Graham found that libertarians are most sensitive to the proposed Liberty foundation,<ref name=\"Haidt\" /> liberals are most sensitive to the Care and Fairness foundations, while conservatives are equally sensitive to all five/six foundations.<ref name=\"Graham2011\" />  [[Joshua Greene (psychologist)|Joshua Greene]] argued however that liberals tend to emphasise the Care, Fairness and Liberty dimensions; conservatives the Loyalty, Authority and Sanctity dimensions.<ref>R Sapolsky, ''Behave'' (London 2018) p. 450</ref>\n\nAccording to Haidt, the differences have significant implications for political discourse and relations. Because members of two political camps are to a degree blind to one or more of the moral foundations of the others, they may perceive morally driven words or behavior as having another basis\u2014at best self-interested, at worst evil, and thus demonize one another.<ref name=\"Moyers\">{{cite AV media\n | people = Jonathan Haidt, Bill Moyers\n | title = Jonathan Haidt Explains Our Contentious Culture\n | medium = Television production\n | publisher = Public Square Media, Inc.\n | location = Lebanon\n | date = 3 February 2012\n | url = http://billmoyers.com/segment/jonathan-haidt-explains-our-contentious-culture/}}</ref>\n\nHaidt and Graham suggest a compromise can be found to allow liberals and conservatives to see eye-to-eye.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haidt|first=Jonathan|last2=Graham|first2=Jesse|date=2007-06-01|title=When Morality Opposes Justice: Conservatives Have Moral Intuitions that Liberals may not Recognize|journal=Social Justice Research|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=98\u2013116|doi=10.1007/s11211-007-0034-z|issn=0885-7466}}</ref> They suggest that the five foundations can be used as \"doorway\" to allow liberals to step to the conservative side of the \"wall\" put up between these two political affiliations on major political issues (i.e. legalizing gay marriage). If liberals try to consider the latter three foundations in addition to the former two (therefore adopting all five foundations like conservatives for a brief amount of time) they could understand where the conservatives' viewpoints stem from and long-lasting political issues could finally be settled.\n\nResearchers postulate that the moral foundations arose as solutions to problems common in the [[Evolutionary psychology|ancestral hunter-gatherer environment]], in particular intertribal and intra-tribal conflict. The three foundations emphasized more by conservatives (Loyalty, Authority, Sanctity) bind groups together for greater strength in intertribal competition while the other two foundations balance those tendencies with concern for individuals within the group. With reduced sensitivity to the group moral foundations, progressives tend to promote a more [[universalist]] morality.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Sinn | first1 = J.S. | last2 = Hayes | first2 = M.W. | year = 2017 | title = Replacing the Moral Foundations: An Evolutionary\u2010Coalitional Theory of Liberal\u2010Conservative Differences | url = | journal = Political Psychology | volume = 38 | issue = 6| pages = 1043\u20131064 | doi=10.1111/pops.12361}}</ref>\n\n===Cross-cultural differences===\nHaidt's initial field work in Brazil and Philadelphia in 1989,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Haidt |first1=Jonathan |last2=Koller |first2=Silvia Helena |last3=Dias |first3=Maria G. |title=Affect, culture, and morality, or is it wrong to eat your dog? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |date=1993 |volume=65 |issue=4 |pages=613\u2013628 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.65.4.613|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/837091f3ac8cc6047833de330315e3f2c46b5af6 }}</ref> and [[Odisha]], India in 1993, showed that moralizing indeed varies among cultures, but less than by social class (e.g. education) and age.

After surviving the [[Powhatan attack of 1622]], he moved to [[Jordan Point, Virginia|Jordan's Journey]]. In the following year, Farrar became involved in North America's first breach of promise suit when he proposed to [[Cecily Jordan Farrar|Cecily Jordan]].

After surviving the [[Powhatan attack of 1622]], he moved to [[Jordan Point, Virginia|Jordan's Journey]]. In the following year, Farrar became involved in North America's first breach of promise suit when he proposed to [[Cecily Jordan Farrar|Cecily Jordan]].  In 1626, Farrar was appointed to the [[Virginia Governor's Council|Council of Virginia]] where he served as an advisor to the royal governor, a judge of the highest court in the colony, and a member of the [[Virginia General Assembly]] of [[Colonial Jamestown]]. He was also appointed magistrate of the upper James River community. In both these roles, he served as a voice of the early planters' interest as the colony transitioned from being managed by the Virginia Company and becoming a royal colony under [[Charles I of England]]. Farrar was also on the Council when it arrested Governor [[John Harvey (Virginia)|John Harvey]] for misgovernance and forced his temporary return to England. By the time of his death around 1637, Farrar had sold off his remaining assets in England and established rights to a 2000 acre patent on [[Farrar's Island]], located on a curl of the James River.\n\n[[File:Farrar Complete Coat of Arms.jpg|thumb|The [[Coat of arms|arms]] of William Farrar's father, John Farrar of Croxton and London, Esquire<ref name= Bannerman1899/>]]\n\n==Background==\nWilliam Farrar was born before April 28, 1583,<ref name=\"Dorman2004\" /> the date of his christening, in [[Croxton, Lincolnshire]], England.<ref name=CroxtonParish1583 /> He was the 3rd son of John Farrar of Croxton<ref name= \"Bannerman1899\" /> and London, [[Esquire]], a wealthy [[merchant]] and [[Land tenure|landowner]] with various holdings in [[West Yorkshire]], [[Lincolnshire]], and [[Hertfordshire]]<ref name =Farrer1936/>, and Cecily Kelke, an heiress <ref name=Richardson2011/> and direct descendant of [[Edward III of England]].<ref name=ElleMagazine2014/> The nineteenth century historian of Virginia, [[Alexander Brown (author)|Alexander Brown]], states that while in England, William Farrar received an education in law.<ref name=Brown1890v2 />\n\n== Relation to the Virginia Company and emigration to the New World ==\n[[File:Nova Britannia Cover.jpg|thumb|left|Facsimile cover of \"Nova Britannia\", a tract from Farrar's time used to recruit people to Virginia.]]\nWhen Farrar went to Virginia, it was still part of the [[Virginia Company of London]], a [[joint-stock company]], sanctioned by [[Royal charter#United Kingdom|Royal Charter]].<ref name=\"Wolfe2016\" /> Farrar was a subscriber to the Third Charter of the Virginia Company,<ref name= Kolp2014 /> where his name appears as \"William Ferrers\".<ref name= Bemiss1957 /> His subscription consisted of three shares that were bought for a total of \u00a337 10s (equivalent to about ${{formatnum:{{ To USD round|{{inflation|UK|37.5|1600}}|GBR|sf=3}}}} today).{{Notetag|For another comparison of the share's value, the entire annual wages of a skilled [[journeyman]] in London around 1588 was authorized to be between \u00a34 and \u00a310. {{refn|name=Aughterson1998}} }}<ref name=Brown1890v2 /> Farrar also had family interests in the Virginia Company as two of his second cousins,<ref name=Torrence1942 /> the brothers [[John Ferrar]] and [[Nicholas Ferrar]], played key roles in the managing the company's interests.<ref name=Kingsbury1906v1/>{{rp|{{plainlink|https://archive.org/details/recordsofvirgini01virg_0/page/n121/mode/2up 60}} }}\n\nFarrar left London on ''Neptune''<ref name= Hotten1874/> on March 16, 1617/18  {{notetag|[[Dual dating]] is given because the English new year did not begin until March 25 during the time Virginia was colonized.
