At the end of the song the narrator goes to the doctor only to be told his own illness is disagnosed as \"Industrial Disease.\"\n\nThe reference to \"Brewer's Droop\" as a medical condition is an in-joke, referring both to the [[Erectile dysfunction|effect of alcohol on libido]] and to [[Brewers Droop|the band of the same name]] that [[Mark Knopfler]] played in prior to ''Dire Straits''.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{MetroLyrics song|dire-straits|industrial-disease}}<!-- Licensed lyrics provider -->\n\n{{Dire Straits}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Industrial Disease (Song)}}\n[[Category:1982 singles]]\n[[Category:Dire Straits songs]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Mark Knopfler]]\n[[Category:Song recordings produced by Mark Knopfler]]\n[[Category:1982 songs]]\n[[Category:Vertigo Records singles]]\n\n\n{{1980s-rock-song-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Neils51", "label": "safe", "comment": "spelling - it's->its", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Disease_(song)"}

Schaffner]]. The screenplay by [[Dalton Trumbo]] and [[Lorenzo Semple Jr.]] was based on the [[Papillon (book)|1969 autobiography]] by the French convict [[Henri Charri\u00e8re]]. The film stars [[Steve McQueen]] as Charri\u00e8re (\"Papillon\") and [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[Louis Dega]]. Because it was filmed at remote locations, the film was quite expensive for the time ($12 million), but it earned more than twice that in its first year of release.<ref>[http://movies.tvguide.com/papillon/review/108790 \"Movie location and cost information\"], ''TV Guide''</ref> The film's title is [[French language|French]] for \"Butterfly,\" referring to Charri\u00e8re's tattoo and nickname.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Henri Charri\u00e8re]] ([[Steve McQueen]]), a [[safecracker]] nicknamed \"Papillon\" because of the butterfly tattoo on his chest, is wrongly convicted of murdering a pimp. In 1933 he is sentenced to life imprisonment within the penal system in [[French Guiana]]. En route, he meets a fellow convict, [[Louis Dega]] ([[Dustin Hoffman]]), a forger and embezzler who is convinced that his wife will secure his release. Papillon offers to protect Dega if he will underwrite the former's escape once they reach French Guiana. Enduring the horrors of life in a jungle [[labor camp]], the two eventually develop a friendship.\n\nOne day, Papillon defends Dega from a [[wikt:sadistic|sadistic]] guard and escapes into the jungle, but is captured and sentenced to [[solitary confinement]]. In gratitude, Dega has extra food smuggled to Papillon. When the smuggling is discovered, the warden screens Papillon's cell in darkness for six months and cuts his rations in half, believing that it will force him to reveal his benefactor. Though emaciated and half-insane, and reduced to eating insects to survive, Papillon refuses to give up Dega's name. After two years, he is released and sent to the infirmary in [[Prison of St-Laurent-du-Maroni|St-Laurent-du-Maroni]] to recover.\n\nPapillon sees Dega again and asks him to help arrange for another escape attempt. Dega arranges for him to meet an inmate doctor, who offers to secure them a boat on the outside with the help of a man named Pascal. Fellow prisoner Clusiot ([[Woodrow Parfrey]]), and a gay orderly named [[Andr\u00e9 Maturette]] ([[Robert Deman]]) join the escape plot. During the escape, Clusiot is knocked unconscious by a guard. Dega is forced to subdue the guard and reluctantly joins Papillon and Maturette, climbing the walls to the outside. Dega fractures his ankle in the fall. The trio meet Pascal and the men escape into the night. In the jungle the next day, Pascal delivers the prisoners to their boat. After he leaves, they discover that it is a fake. They encounter a local trapper ([[John Quade]]), who reveals that he had killed the bounty hunters that were waiting for them, and guides the three to a nearby [[leper colony]], where they obtain supplies and a seaworthy boat.\n\nThe trio eventually land in [[Honduras|Colombia]], and are accosted by a group of soldiers, who open fire and wound Maturette. He is captured along with Dega, still crippled by his broken ankle, while Papillon is forced to flee. Papillon evades the soldiers and lives for a long period with a native tribe; he awakens one morning to find them gone, leaving him with a small sack of pearls. Papillon travels to a police checkpoint and pays a nun to take him to her [[convent]]. There he asks the [[Abbess|Mother Superior]] for refuge, but she instead turns him over to the authorities.\n\nPapillon is brought back to French Guiana and sentenced to another five years of solitary confinement. He emerges a graying old man along with Maturette, whom he sees just before the latter dies. Papillon is then moved to the remote [[Devil's Island]], where he reunites with Dega, who has long given up all hope of being released. From a high cliff, Papillon observes a small cove where he discovers that the waves are powerful enough to carry a man out to sea and to the nearby mainland. Papillon urges Dega to join him in another escape, and the men make two floats out of bagged up coconuts. As they stand on the cliff side, Dega decides not to escape and begs Papillon not to either. Papillon embraces Dega a final time, and then leaps from the cliff. Grasping his float, he is successfully carried out to sea.\n\nA narrator states that Papillon made it to freedom, and lived the rest of his life a free man.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Steve McQueen]] as [[Henri Charri\u00e8re]] aka Papillon\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[Louis Dega]]\n* [[Victor Jory]] as Indian chief\n* [[Don Gordon (actor)|Don Gordon]] as Julot\n* [[Anthony Zerbe]] as [[Toussaint (leper chief)|Toussaint]], leper colony chief\n* [[Robert Deman]] as [[Andr\u00e9 Maturette]]\n* [[Woodrow Parfrey]] as Clusiot\n* [[Bill Mumy]] as Lariot\n* Richard Angarola as Commandant\n* [[George Coulouris]] as Dr. Chatal\n* Ratna Assan as Zoraima\n* [[William Smithers]] as Warden Barrot\n* [[Val Avery]] as Pascal\n* [[Gregory Sierra]] as Antonio\n* [[Vic Tayback]] as Sergeant\n* [[John Quade]] as Masked Breton\n* [[Mills Watson]] as Guard\n* [[Fred Sadoff]] as Deputy Warden\n* [[Ron Soble]] as Santini\n* [[Don Hanmer]] as Butterfly Trader\n* [[Mills Watson]] as Guard\n* [[Liam Dunn]] as Old Trustee\n* [[Richard Farnsworth]] as Manhunter (uncredited)\n* [[Peter Brocco]] as Doctor (uncredited)\n* [[Anne Byrne (actress)|Anne Byrne]] as Mrs. Dega (uncredited)\n* [[Dalton Trumbo]] as Commandant (uncredited)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Condemened men's block, St. Laurent..jpg|thumb|The prison as it appeared in 1954, not long before it was closed and abandoned]]\nPapillon was filmed at various locations in [[Spain]] and [[Jamaica]], with the cave scenes filmed beneath what is now the [[Xtabi]] hotel on the cliffs of [[Negril]].

It was recorded in Rome, Italy at the Ortophonic Recording Studio by the \"Unione Musicisti Roma Orchestra\". The film marked Goldsmith's fourth of seven collaborations with director [[Franklin J. Schaffner]], following his [[Academy Award]]-nominated scores to ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968) and ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'' (1970).  Both the director and composer shared the belief that film music should be used economically; they wanted the music as commentary only in sequences where it can emphasize the psychological aspects of the film. In ''Papillon,'' the film is two and a half hours long, but has 40 minutes with music.\n\nGoldsmith's compositions, characterized by a late romantic symphonic and impressionistic style suffused with a metered, exotic timbre (using instruments from [[Caribbean]] folk music), are distributed mainly in the second half of the film. They generally accompany scenes outside the prison, during the various escape attempts by the protagonist. He used a delicate melodic approach, dominated by a very catchy theme expressed as a [[waltz]], which was often played by an [[accordion]]. This instrument was associated with the French origin of the protagonists. The theme became famous with the popularity of the film, and it was released in many performance variations by different record companies.\n\nThe score was partially produced on vinyl in 1973 and reissued over the years. In the 21st century, an edition was produced on CD by Universal Records France. For the first time, this has the complete version of music from the film (it includes about five minutes of previously unreleased tracks). The DVD version of the English-language version of the film includes an option to listen to Goldsmith's music as an isolated audio track.\n\nGoldsmith had his sixth [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for this soundtrack. It was one of the [[American Film Institute]]'s 250 nominated soundtracks for the [[AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores|top 25 American film scores]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/scores250.pdf?docID=221|title=''AFI's 100 Years Of Film Scores''|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Box office==\nThe film was a hit and grossed $3,126,574 in its opening week.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Papillon 1st Week $3,126,574|date=January 2, 1974|page=8}}</ref> It earned theatrical rentals in the United States and Canada of $21.3 million.<ref>\"All-time Film Rental Champs\", ''Variety'', 7 January 1976 p 20</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[Roger Ebert]]'s review at the time of the film's original release was two-of-four stars; he said that the main flaw was a failure to gain audience interest in McQueen's and Hoffman's characters: \"You know something has gone wrong when you want the hero to escape simply so that the movie can be over.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19731216/REVIEWS/301010324/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Papillon Movie Review & Film Summary (1973) | date=16 December 1973}}</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"a big, brave, stouthearted, sometimes romantic, sometimes silly melodrama with the kind of visual sweep you don't often find in movies anymore.\"<ref>Canby, Vincent (December 17, 1973). \"The Screen: 'Papillon'\".

Schaffner]]. The screenplay by [[Dalton Trumbo]] and [[Lorenzo Semple Jr.]] was based on the [[Papillon (book)|1969 autobiography]] by the French convict [[Henri Charri\u00e8re]]. The film stars [[Steve McQueen]] as Charri\u00e8re (\"Papillon\") and [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[Louis Dega]]. Because it was filmed at remote locations, the film was quite expensive for the time ($12 million), but it earned more than twice that in its first year of release.<ref>[http://movies.tvguide.com/papillon/review/108790 \"Movie location and cost information\"], ''TV Guide''</ref> The film's title is [[French language|French]] for \"Butterfly,\" referring to Charri\u00e8re's tattoo and nickname.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Henri Charri\u00e8re]] ([[Steve McQueen]]), a [[safecracker]] nicknamed \"Papillon\" because of the butterfly tattoo on his chest, is wrongly convicted of murdering a pimp. In 1933 he is sentenced to life imprisonment within the penal system in [[French Guiana]]. En route, he meets a fellow convict, [[Louis Dega]] ([[Dustin Hoffman]]), a forger and embezzler who is convinced that his wife will secure his release. Papillon offers to protect Dega if he will underwrite the former's escape once they reach French Guiana. Enduring the horrors of life in a jungle [[labor camp]], the two eventually develop a friendship.\n\nOne day, Papillon defends Dega from a [[wikt:sadistic|sadistic]] guard and escapes into the jungle, but is captured and sentenced to [[solitary confinement]]. In gratitude, Dega has extra food smuggled to Papillon. When the smuggling is discovered, the warden screens Papillon's cell in darkness for six months and cuts his rations in half, believing that it will force him to reveal his benefactor. Though emaciated and half-insane, and reduced to eating insects to survive, Papillon refuses to give up Dega's name. After two years, he is released and sent to the infirmary in [[Prison of St-Laurent-du-Maroni|St-Laurent-du-Maroni]] to recover.\n\nPapillon sees Dega again and asks him to help arrange for another escape attempt. Dega arranges for him to meet an inmate doctor, who offers to secure them a boat on the outside with the help of a man named Pascal. Fellow prisoner Clusiot ([[Woodrow Parfrey]]), and a gay orderly named [[Andr\u00e9 Maturette]] ([[Robert Deman]]) join the escape plot. During the escape, Clusiot is knocked unconscious by a guard. Dega is forced to subdue the guard and reluctantly joins Papillon and Maturette, climbing the walls to the outside. Dega fractures his ankle in the fall. The trio meet Pascal and the men escape into the night. In the jungle the next day, Pascal delivers the prisoners to their boat. After he leaves, they discover that it is a fake. They encounter a local trapper ([[John Quade]]), who reveals that he had killed the bounty hunters that were waiting for them, and guides the three to a nearby [[leper colony]], where they obtain supplies and a seaworthy boat.\n\nThe trio eventually land in [[Honduras|Colombia]], and are accosted by a group of soldiers, who open fire and wound Maturette. He is captured along with Dega, still crippled by his broken ankle, while Papillon is forced to flee. Papillon evades the soldiers and lives for a long period with a native tribe; he awakens one morning to find them gone, leaving him with a small sack of pearls. Papillon travels to a police checkpoint and pays a nun to take him to her [[convent]]. There he asks the [[Abbess|Mother Superior]] for refuge, but she instead turns him over to the authorities.\n\nPapillon is brought back to French Guiana and sentenced to another five years of solitary confinement. He emerges a graying old man along with Maturette, whom he sees just before the latter dies. Papillon is then moved to the remote [[Devil's Island]], where he reunites with Dega, who has long given up all hope of being released. From a high cliff, Papillon observes a small cove where he discovers that the waves are powerful enough to carry a man out to sea and to the nearby mainland. Papillon urges Dega to join him in another escape, and the men make two floats out of bagged up coconuts. As they stand on the cliff side, Dega decides not to escape and begs Papillon not to either. Papillon embraces Dega a final time, and then leaps from the cliff. Grasping his float, he is successfully carried out to sea.\n\nA narrator states that Papillon made it to freedom, and lived the rest of his life a free man.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Steve McQueen]] as [[Henri Charri\u00e8re]] aka Papillon\n* [[Dustin Hoffman]] as [[Louis Dega]]\n* [[Victor Jory]] as Indian chief\n* [[Don Gordon (actor)|Don Gordon]] as Julot\n* [[Anthony Zerbe]] as [[Toussaint (leper chief)|Toussaint]], leper colony chief\n* [[Robert Deman]] as [[Andr\u00e9 Maturette]]\n* [[Woodrow Parfrey]] as Clusiot\n* [[Bill Mumy]] as Lariot\n* Richard Angarola as Commandant\n* [[George Coulouris]] as Dr. Chatal\n* Ratna Assan as Zoraima\n* [[William Smithers]] as Warden Barrot\n* [[Val Avery]] as Pascal\n* [[Gregory Sierra]] as Antonio\n* [[Vic Tayback]] as Sergeant\n* [[John Quade]] as Masked Breton\n* [[Mills Watson]] as Guard\n* [[Fred Sadoff]] as Deputy Warden\n* [[Ron Soble]] as Santini\n* [[Don Hanmer]] as Butterfly Trader\n* [[Mills Watson]] as Guard\n* [[Liam Dunn]] as Old Trustee\n* [[Richard Farnsworth]] as Manhunter (uncredited)\n* [[Peter Brocco]] as Doctor (uncredited)\n* [[Anne Byrne (actress)|Anne Byrne]] as Mrs. Dega (uncredited)\n* [[Dalton Trumbo]] as Commandant (uncredited)\n{{Div col end}}\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Condemened men's block, St. Laurent..jpg|thumb|The prison as it appeared in 1954, not long before it was closed and abandoned]]\nPapillon was filmed at various locations in [[Spain]] and [[Jamaica]], with the cave scenes filmed beneath what is now the [[Xtabi]] hotel on the cliffs of [[Negril]].

It was recorded in Rome, Italy at the Ortophonic Recording Studio by the \"Unione Musicisti Roma Orchestra\". The film marked Goldsmith's fourth of seven collaborations with director [[Franklin J. Schaffner]], following his [[Academy Award]]-nominated scores to ''[[Planet of the Apes (1968 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' (1968) and ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'' (1970).  Both the director and composer shared the belief that film music should be used economically; they wanted the music as commentary only in sequences where it can emphasize the psychological aspects of the film. In ''Papillon,'' the film is two and a half hours long, but has 40 minutes with music.\n\nGoldsmith's compositions, characterized by a late romantic symphonic and impressionistic style suffused with a metered, exotic timbre (using instruments from [[Caribbean]] folk music), are distributed mainly in the second half of the film. They generally accompany scenes outside the prison, during the various escape attempts by the protagonist. He used a delicate melodic approach, dominated by a very catchy theme expressed as a [[waltz]], which was often played by an [[accordion]]. This instrument was associated with the French origin of the protagonists. The theme became famous with the popularity of the film, and it was released in many performance variations by different record companies.\n\nThe score was partially produced on vinyl in 1973 and reissued over the years. In the 21st century, an edition was produced on CD by Universal Records France. For the first time, this has the complete version of music from the film (it includes about five minutes of previously unreleased tracks). The DVD version of the English-language version of the film includes an option to listen to Goldsmith's music as an isolated audio track.\n\nGoldsmith had his sixth [[Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]] for this soundtrack. It was one of the [[American Film Institute]]'s 250 nominated soundtracks for the [[AFI's 100 Years of Film Scores|top 25 American film scores]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://connect.afi.com/site/DocServer/scores250.pdf?docID=221|title=''AFI's 100 Years Of Film Scores''|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Box office==\nThe film was a hit and grossed $3,126,574 in its opening week.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|title=Papillon 1st Week $3,126,574|date=January 2, 1974|page=8}}</ref> It earned theatrical rentals in the United States and Canada of $21.3 million.<ref>\"All-time Film Rental Champs\", ''Variety'', 7 January 1976 p 20</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n[[Roger Ebert]]'s review at the time of the film's original release was two-of-four stars; he said that the main flaw was a failure to gain audience interest in McQueen's and Hoffman's characters: \"You know something has gone wrong when you want the hero to escape simply so that the movie can be over.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19731216/REVIEWS/301010324/1023 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | title=Papillon Movie Review & Film Summary (1973) | date=16 December 1973}}</ref> [[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film \"a big, brave, stouthearted, sometimes romantic, sometimes silly melodrama with the kind of visual sweep you don't often find in movies anymore.\"<ref>Canby, Vincent (December 17, 1973). \"The Screen: 'Papillon'\".

[[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref

[[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> The WHO considers bats the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature

/>\n\nWhether the virus is infectious during the [[incubation period]] is uncertain.<ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in China]] suggested that \"pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections\" and that [[subclinical infection]]s may have been the source of a majority of infections.<ref name=\"ScienceRapid\" />\n\n===Reservoir===\n[[File:Rhinolophus rouxii.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=A horseshoe bat|[[Horseshoe bat]]s are among the most likely [[natural

humans remains unclear, as does whether the strain became [[pathogen]]ic before or after the [[spillover event]].<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> The WHO considers bats the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\"/> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses. By 12 January 2020, five genomes of SARS-CoV-2 had been isolated from Wuhan and reported by the [[Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CCDC) and other institutions;<ref name=\"gisaid\"/><ref name=\"VirologicalInitial\" /> the number of genomes increased to 42 by 30 January 2020.<ref name=\"NextstrainJanuary\" /> A phylogenetic analysis of those samples showed they were \"highly related with at most seven mutations relative to a [[common ancestor]]\", implying that the first human infection occurred in November or December 2019.<ref name=\"NextstrainJanuary\" /> {{As of|2020|March|27|post=,}} 1,495 SARS-CoV-2 genomes sampled on six continents were publicly available.<ref name=\"NextstrainMarch\" />\n\nOn 11 February 2020, the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]] (ICTV) announced that according to existing rules that compute hierarchical relationships among coronaviruses on the basis of five [[conserved sequence]]s of [[nucleic acid]]s, the differences between what was then called 2019-nCoV and the [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|virus strain from the 2003 SARS outbreak]] were insufficient to make them separate [[viral species]].
