It has the [[musical form]] of a conventional [[twelve-bar blues]] and features Hendrix's guitar playing.  He developed the song prior to forming the Experience and was inspired by earlier blues songs.  \n\n\"Red House\" was first released on the British edition of Hendrix's debut album ''[[Are You Experienced]]'' in May 1967 (for the American album release, previously released Experience singles were used in its place).  A second similar take was eventually released in the US in July 1969 on the American ''[[Smash Hits (The Jimi Hendrix Experience album)|Smash Hits]]'' compilation.\n\nThe song was a fixture of Hendrix concerts throughout his career.  Although the lyrics and basic structure were followed, his performances usually varied from the original recording.  Many were recorded and continue to be released officially for the first time, including on ''[[Miami Pop Festival (Jimi Hendrix Experience album)|Miami Pop Festival]]'' (2013) and ''[[Freedom: Atlanta Pop Festival]]'' (2015). \"Red House\" has also been performed and recorded by a variety of blues and other artists.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Albert King 1978.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Albert King in Paris, 1978]]\n\"Red House\" was inspired by blues songs Hendrix was performing early in his career as a sideman.  Music critic [[Charles Shaar Murray]] describes a song he calls \"California Night\", which Hendrix performed with [[Curtis Knight and the Squires]], as \"a dead ringer, both in structure and mood, for his 1967 perennial 'Red House'\".{{sfn|Murray|1991|p=139}}  Originally recorded by [[Albert King]] in 1961 as \"Travelin' to California\",{{sfn|McDermott|2017|p=11}} it is a slow blues with lyrics that follow the common blues theme of the rambling man and his lost love (sometimes also misidentified as \"[[Every Day I Have the Blues]]\" \u2013 both songs use the verse \"nobody loves me\").{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=67}}{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=581}}{{efn|[[Albert King]]'s \"Travelin' to California\" was issued as a single in 1961 (King 5588)<ref>{{Discogs master|1115450|Travelin' to California|type=single}}</ref> and included on his album ''[[The Big Blues]]'' (1962); he also recorded it for [[Chess Records]] in 1961 \u2013 it was released with the title \"California\" or \"California Blues\" on the ''Door to Door'' (1969) compilation album (Chess LP-1538).<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/door-to-door-mw0000201978\n| title = Albert King / Otis Rush: ''Door to Door''\n| last = Koda\n| first = Cub\n| authorlink = Cub Koda\n| website = [[AllMusic]]\n| accessdate = August 21, 2017\n| ref = harv\n}}</ref>}}\n\nHendrix recorded two live versions of \"Travelin' to California\" with Knight, which prominently feature his vocal and guitar playing.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=584}}  Both were recorded at George's Club 22 in Hackensack, New Jersey, on December 26, 1965 and/or January 22, 1966.{{sfn|McDermott|2017|p=10}}  After Hendrix's death in 1970, the recordings (using various names) were released by several European record companies that specialized in [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] and [[grey-market]] albums.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|pp=581, 584}} In 2017, a version was officially released on ''Curtis Knight [Featuring Jimi Hendrix]: Live at George's Club 20''.{{sfn|McDermott|2017|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nMusic writer Keith Shadwick describes Hendrix's performance as \"a staggering display of blues guitar playing that is worthy of mention in the same breath as his later efforts with the Experience\".{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=67}} Although Shadwick compares his guitar tone and phraseology to that of [[Buddy Guy]], he adds that his techniques \"simply transcend any previous models, and breaks new ground\" and shows that \"his ability to spin out long and consistently surprising lines across the standard blues changes is already full grown\".{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=67}} In 1966, during his residency as [[Jimmy James and the Blue Flames]] at the [[Cafe Wha?]] in New York City's Greenwich Village, Hendrix continued to develop his slow blues number that became \"Red House\".{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=80}}\n\n==Composition==\n\"Red House\" is a moderately slow blues, which music writers Tom Wheeler and Joe Gore describe as having \"the [[twelve-bar blues|twelve-bar structure]], the lyrics, the accompaniment, and the arrangement [that] are more or less conventional\".{{sfn|Wheeler|Gore|1992|p=3}}  The song is notated in 12/8 time in the [[key of B]] with a tempo of 66 [[beats per minute]]{{sfn|Hal Leonard|1998|p=217}} (although Hendrix fingered the song in the key of B, he usually tuned his guitar one-half step and sometimes one step lower, resulting in a lower pitch).{{sfn|Wheeler|Gore|1992|p=3}}  The song opens with a [[diminished seventh chord]] frequently found in blues songs, including the intros to the [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] songs \"[[Dead Shrimp Blues]]\", \"[[Kind Hearted Woman Blues|Kind Hearted Woman]]\", and \"[[32-20 Blues]]\".{{sfn|Fairchild|1994|pp=21\u201322}}   After the four-bar intro, Redding and Experience drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]] come in while Hendrix solos up to the vocal at bar thirteen.{{sfn|Hal Leonard|1998|pp=218\u2013219}}  After two twelve-bar vocal sections, Hendrix solos for twelve bars, then finishes up with another vocal section.{{sfn|Hal Leonard|1998|pp=219\u2013227}}\n\nThe song's most prominent characteristic is Hendrix's guitar work.<ref name=\"Ward\"/>  Author Jeffrey Carroll describes his solo as \"concise and packed solid with vocalisms, the bending and glissandos, jumps, drops and whoops of his guitar kept within a traditional structure of a break\".{{sfn|Carroll|2005|p=109}} Shadwick also compares it to a vocal, calling it a \"close approximation of the human voice{{nbsp}}... scooping and bending his phrases to maximum expressive effect\".{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=93}}  American bluesman [[John Lee Hooker]] commented, \"That 'Red House', that'll make you grab your mother and choke her!  Man, that's really hard, that tears you apart.  He could get down, he could mash it, yeah, Lord!  He had so many blues\".{{sfn|Fairchild|1994|p=18}}\n\n==Lyrics==\nIn his biography ''[[Room Full of Mirrors]]'', biographer [[Charles R. Cross]] comments that the song's theme is \"as old as the blues itself; the singer's woman doesn't love him any more and has moved\".{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=175}} Author Kay Norton describes the broader blues influence as \"balancing a celebration of love and sex with dark humor and wry commentary on loss, mistreatment, corruption, and poverty\".{{sfn|Norton|2016|p=82}}  The lyrics follow a blues [[Call and response (music)|call and response]] or AAB pattern, where the first line (A) is repeated (often with a slight variation), followed by the response (B):\n{{poemquote|\nWait a minute something's wrong here, the key won't unlock this door\nWait a minute something's wrong, Lord have mercy this key won't unlock this door\n(Something's goin' on here)\nI have a bad, bad feeling, that my baby don't live here no more{{nbsp}}...\n\nWell I might as well go back over yonder, way back among the hills\n(Yeah that's what I'm gonna do)\nLord I might as well go back over yonder, way back yonder across the hills\n'Cause if my baby don't love me no more, I know her sister will\n(Yeah, how's that?){{sfn|Hendrix|2003|p=136}}}}\n\nAccording to Experience bassist [[Noel Redding]], Hendrix told him it was about Hendrix' girlfriend in high school, Betty Jean Morgan.{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=175}}  Jimi's brother, [[Leon Hendrix]], also felt that it was about Betty Jean, but also included her sister Maddy,{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=172}} although their house was brown.{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=175}} Shadwick suggests that the song was inspired by [[Linda Keith]], [[Keith Richards]]' then-girlfriend and early Hendrix supporter.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=93}}  Keith referred to her friend's Manhattan apartment, with its red velvet walls and decor,{{sfn|Roby|Schreiber|2010|p=148}} as the \"red house\", and the two frequently stayed there during the summer of 1966.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=78}} In London in 1970, Hendrix met up with Keith and when he performed \"Red House\" at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|1970 Isle of Wight Festival]], he dedicated the song to her and added \"I got to get out of here, because my Linda don't live here no more\" to the lyrics.{{sfn|Roby|Schreiber| 2010|p=182}} However, [[Billy Cox]], longtime friend and bassist for Hendrix' post-Experience groups, explained, \"As far as I know, 'Red House' didn't have any significance in reference to a particular person, place, or thing. It was just a blues number that Jimi put together\".{{sfn|Fairchild|1994|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n==Recording==\n[[File:Noel Redding playing guitar - Photo by Doug Naismith.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Noel Redding returned to playing guitar after quitting the Experience, 1969]]\n\"Red House\" was one of the earliest songs recorded by the Experience.  The group first attempted it at the [[CBS Records International|CBS]] Studios in London on Tuesday, December 13, 1966, following their performance of \"[[Hey Joe#Tim Rose and Jimi Hendrix (1966)|Hey Joe]]\" for the ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' music television program.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=92}} Basic tracks for several songs were recorded during the three-hour session.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=27}} Producer [[Chas Chandler]] recalled: \"The 'Red House' on the album [''[[Are You Experienced]]''] came about during the last fifteen minutes of [the December 13] session.  Noel even played rhythm guitar on the track, playing the bass line. Jimi just winged through one take for reference and we started rolling\".{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=29}}\n\nRedding added, \"I had borrowed a terrible old hollow-body electric guitar from someone at the studio{{nbsp}}... because I liked to play along on rhythm to familiarise myself with a sequence, not being quite at home on the bass yet\".{{sfn|Redding|Appleby|1990|p=45}}  The guitar was tuned down one-half step, with the tone controls set to resemble a bass guitar.{{sfn|Black|1999|p=67}}\n\nAdditional takes of the song were recorded at [[De Lane Lea Studios]] on December 21, 1966, which closely followed the earlier arrangement.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=28\u201329}} However, both Hendrix and Redding had problems with missed notes and the takes were not used, except for a backing track that Hendrix later overdubbed at the [[Olympic Studios]] on March 29{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=107}} or early April 1967.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=28\u201329}}\n\n==Releases==\nWhen preparing the final mixes for the Experience's debut album, Chandler chose to use the December 13, 1966, track recorded at CBS:  \"Later when we were scrambling to put the album together, we carted that [December 13 track] out and gave it a listen.  We remixed it at Olympic and added it to the album\".{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=28\u201329}}  [[Track Records]] issued the monaural mix on ''Are You Experienced'',{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=28\u201329}} which was released on May 12, 1967, in the UK.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=50}}  At the time, it was industry practice in the US to include singles on albums.{{sfn|Perry|2004|p=91}}  So when the album was released in the US, \"[[Purple Haze]]\", \"Hey Joe\" and \"[[The Wind Cries Mary]]\" were included at the expense of \"Red House\" and two other songs.{{sfn|Perry|2004|p=91}}  Hendrix later questioned the choice and commented \"Everybody was scared to release 'Red House' in America because they said, 'America don't like the blues, man!'\"{{sfn|Fairchild|1994|p=12}}\n\n\"Red House\" finally saw an American release on July 30, 1969.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=168\u2013169}} [[Reprise Records]] issued a stereo mix of the version recorded at De Lane Lea/Olympic on the ''[[Smash Hits (The Jimi Hendrix Experience album)|Smash Hits]]'' compilation.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=28\u201329}} This version was later released internationally on the 1984 ''[[Kiss the Sky (Jimi Hendrix album)|Kiss the Sky]]'' compilation.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=553}}  The original mono take became available in the US and Canada when it was released  (without most of the studio talk at the end) on the 1994 ''[[Blues (Jimi Hendrix album)|Blues]]'' album.{{sfn|Fairchild|1994|p=21}}\n\n==Other recordings==\n{{quote box|quote=\"Although Hendrix seeks to follow roughly the same musical roadmap in each performance, visiting many of the same locations, he never takes the same route twice\"|source=\u2014Tom Wheeler & Joe Gore, ''Variations on a Theme: Red House'' (1992){{sfn|Wheeler|Gore|1992|p=3}}|width=25%|bgcolor = #E0E6F8 |align=right|style=padding:8px;}}\n\n\"Red House\" was a staple of Jimi Hendrix's concerts and [[jam session]]s and often his performances showed considerable variety.{{sfn|Wheeler|Gore|1992|p=3}} Some later renditions show [[B.B.

Hendrix Experience]].  It has the [[musical form]] of a conventional [[twelve-bar blues]] and features Hendrix's guitar playing.  He developed the song prior to forming the Experience and was inspired by earlier blues songs.  \n\n\"Red House\" was first released on the British edition of Hendrix's debut album ''[[Are You Experienced]]'' in May 1967 (for the American album release, previously released Experience singles were used in its place).  A second similar take was eventually released in the US in July 1969 on the American ''[[Smash Hits (The Jimi Hendrix Experience album)|Smash Hits]]'' compilation.\n\nThe song was a fixture of Hendrix concerts throughout his career.  Although the lyrics and basic structure were followed, his performances usually varied from the original recording.  Many were recorded and continue to be released officially for the first time, including on ''[[Miami Pop Festival (Jimi Hendrix Experience album)|Miami Pop Festival]]'' (2013) and ''[[Freedom: Atlanta Pop Festival]]'' (2015). \"Red House\" has also been performed and recorded by a variety of blues and other artists.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Albert King 1978.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Albert King in Paris, 1978]]\n\"Red House\" was inspired by blues songs Hendrix was performing early in his career as a sideman.  Music critic [[Charles Shaar Murray]] describes a song he calls \"California Night\", which Hendrix performed with [[Curtis Knight and the Squires]], as \"a dead ringer, both in structure and mood, for his 1967 perennial 'Red House'\".{{sfn|Murray|1991|p=139}}  Originally recorded by [[Albert King]] in 1961 as \"Travelin' to California\",{{sfn|McDermott|2017|p=11}} it is a slow blues with lyrics that follow the common blues theme of the rambling man and his lost love (sometimes also misidentified as \"[[Every Day I Have the Blues]]\" \u2013 both songs use the verse \"nobody loves me\").{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=67}}{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=581}}{{efn|[[Albert King]]'s \"Travelin' to California\" was issued as a single in 1961 (King 5588)<ref>{{Discogs master|1115450|Travelin' to California|type=single}}</ref> and included on his album ''[[The Big Blues]]'' (1962); he also recorded it for [[Chess Records]] in 1961 \u2013 it was released with the title \"California\" or \"California Blues\" on the ''Door to Door'' (1969) compilation album (Chess LP-1538).<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/door-to-door-mw0000201978\n| title = Albert King / Otis Rush: ''Door to Door''\n| last = Koda\n| first = Cub\n| authorlink = Cub Koda\n| website = [[AllMusic]]\n| accessdate = August 21, 2017\n| ref = harv\n}}</ref>}}\n\nHendrix recorded two live versions of \"Travelin' to California\" with Knight, which prominently feature his vocal and guitar playing.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=584}}  Both were recorded at George's Club 22 in Hackensack, New Jersey, on December 26, 1965 and/or January 22, 1966.{{sfn|McDermott|2017|p=10}}  After Hendrix's death in 1970, the recordings (using various names) were released by several European record companies that specialized in [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] and [[grey-market]] albums.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|pp=581, 584}} In 2017, a version was officially released on ''Curtis Knight [Featuring Jimi Hendrix]: Live at George's Club 20''.{{sfn|McDermott|2017|pp=10\u201311}}\n\nMusic writer Keith Shadwick describes Hendrix's performance as \"a staggering display of blues guitar playing that is worthy of mention in the same breath as his later efforts with the Experience\".{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=67}} Although Shadwick compares his guitar tone and phraseology to that of [[Buddy Guy]], he adds that his techniques \"simply transcend any previous models, and breaks new ground\" and shows that \"his ability to spin out long and consistently surprising lines across the standard blues changes is already full grown\".{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=67}} In 1966, during his residency as [[Jimmy James and the Blue Flames]] at the [[Cafe Wha?]] in New York City's Greenwich Village, Hendrix continued to develop his slow blues number that became \"Red House\".{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=80}}\n\n==Composition==\n\"Red House\" is a moderately slow blues, which music writers Tom Wheeler and Joe Gore describe as having \"the [[twelve-bar blues|twelve-bar structure]], the lyrics, the accompaniment, and the arrangement [that] are more or less conventional\".{{sfn|Wheeler|Gore|1992|p=3}}  The song is notated in 12/8 time in the [[key of B]] with a tempo of 66 [[beats per minute]]{{sfn|Hal Leonard|1998|p=217}} (although Hendrix fingered the song in the key of B, he usually tuned his guitar one-half step and sometimes one step lower, resulting in a lower pitch).{{sfn|Wheeler|Gore|1992|p=3}}  The song opens with a [[diminished seventh chord]] frequently found in blues songs, including the intros to the [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]] songs \"[[Dead Shrimp Blues]]\", \"[[Kind Hearted Woman Blues|Kind Hearted Woman]]\", and \"[[32-20 Blues]]\".{{sfn|Fairchild|1994|pp=21\u201322}}   After the four-bar intro, Redding and Experience drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]] come in while Hendrix solos up to the vocal at bar thirteen.{{sfn|Hal Leonard|1998|pp=218\u2013219}}  After two twelve-bar vocal sections, Hendrix solos for twelve bars, then finishes up with another vocal section.{{sfn|Hal Leonard|1998|pp=219\u2013227}}\n\nThe song's most prominent characteristic is Hendrix's guitar work.<ref name=\"Ward\"/>  Author Jeffrey Carroll describes his solo as \"concise and packed solid with vocalisms, the bending and glissandos, jumps, drops and whoops of his guitar kept within a traditional structure of a break\".{{sfn|Carroll|2005|p=109}} Shadwick also compares it to a vocal, calling it a \"close approximation of the human voice{{nbsp}}... scooping and bending his phrases to maximum expressive effect\".{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=93}}  American bluesman [[John Lee Hooker]] commented, \"That 'Red House', that'll make you grab your mother and choke her!  Man, that's really hard, that tears you apart.  He could get down, he could mash it, yeah, Lord!

Cross]] comments that the song's theme is \"as old as the blues itself; the singer's woman doesn't love him any more and has moved\".{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=175}} Author Kay Norton describes the broader blues influence as \"balancing a celebration of love and sex with dark humor and wry commentary on loss, mistreatment, corruption, and poverty\".{{sfn|Norton|2016|p=82}}  The lyrics follow a blues [[Call and response (music)|call and response]] or AAB pattern, where the first line (A) is repeated (often with a slight variation), followed by the response (B):\n{{poemquote|\nWait a minute something's wrong here, the key won't unlock this door\nWait a minute something's wrong, Lord have mercy this key won't unlock this door\n(Something's goin' on here)\nI have a bad, bad feeling, that my baby don't live here no more{{nbsp}}...\n\nWell I might as well go back over yonder, way back among the hills\n(Yeah that's what I'm gonna do)\nLord I might as well go back over yonder, way back yonder across the hills\n'Cause if my baby don't love me no more, I know her sister will\n(Yeah, how's that?){{sfn|Hendrix|2003|p=136}}}}\n\nAccording to Experience bassist [[Noel Redding]], Hendrix told him it was about Hendrix' girlfriend in high school, Betty Jean Morgan.{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=175}}  Jimi's brother, [[Leon Hendrix]], also felt that it was about Betty Jean, but also included her sister Maddy,{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=172}} although their house was brown.{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=175}} Shadwick suggests that the song was inspired by [[Linda Keith]], [[Keith Richards]]' then-girlfriend and early Hendrix supporter.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=93}}  Keith referred to her friend's Manhattan apartment, with its red velvet walls and decor,{{sfn|Roby|Schreiber|2010|p=148}} as the \"red house\", and the two frequently stayed there during the summer of 1966.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=78}} In London in 1970, Hendrix met up with Keith and when he performed \"Red House\" at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|1970 Isle of Wight Festival]], he dedicated the song to her and added \"I got to get out of here, because my Linda don't live here no more\" to the lyrics.{{sfn|Roby|Schreiber| 2010|p=182}} However, [[Billy Cox]], longtime friend and bassist for Hendrix' post-Experience groups, explained, \"As far as I know, 'Red House' didn't have any significance in reference to a particular person, place, or thing. It was just a blues number that Jimi put together\".{{sfn|Fairchild|1994|pp=21\u201322}}\n\n==Recording==\n[[File:Noel Redding playing guitar - Photo by Doug Naismith.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Noel Redding returned to playing guitar after quitting the Experience, 1969]]\n\"Red House\" was one of the earliest songs recorded by the Experience.  The group first attempted it at the [[CBS Records International|CBS]] Studios in London on Tuesday, December 13, 1966, following their performance of \"[[Hey Joe#Tim Rose and Jimi Hendrix (1966)|Hey Joe]]\" for the ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' music television program.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=92}} Basic tracks for several songs were recorded during the three-hour session.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=27}} Producer [[Chas Chandler]] recalled: \"The 'Red House' on the album [''[[Are You Experienced]]''] came about during the last fifteen minutes of [the December 13] session.  Noel even played rhythm guitar on the track, playing the bass line. Jimi just winged through one take for reference and we started rolling\".{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=29}}\n\nRedding added, \"I had borrowed a terrible old hollow-body electric guitar from someone at the studio{{nbsp}}... because I liked to play along on rhythm to familiarise myself with a sequence, not being quite at home on the bass yet\".{{sfn|Redding|Appleby|1990|p=45}}  The guitar was tuned down one-half step, with the tone controls set to resemble a bass guitar.{{sfn|Black|1999|p=67}}\n\nAdditional takes of the song were recorded at [[De Lane Lea Studios]] on December 21, 1966, which closely followed the earlier arrangement.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=28\u201329}} However, both Hendrix and Redding had problems with missed notes and the takes were not used, except for a backing track that Hendrix later overdubbed at the [[Olympic Studios]] on March 29{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=107}} or early April 1967.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=28\u201329}}\n\n==Releases==\nWhen preparing the final mixes for the Experience's debut album, Chandler chose to use the December 13, 1966, track recorded at CBS:  \"Later when we were scrambling to put the album together, we carted that [December 13 track] out and gave it a listen.  We remixed it at Olympic and added it to the album\".{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=28\u201329}}  [[Track Records]] issued the monaural mix on ''Are You Experienced'',{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=28\u201329}} which was released on May 12, 1967, in the UK.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=50}}  At the time, it was industry practice in the US to include singles on albums.{{sfn|Perry|2004|p=91}}  So when the album was released in the US, \"[[Purple Haze]]\", \"Hey Joe\" and \"[[The Wind Cries Mary]]\" were included at the expense of \"Red House\" and two other songs.{{sfn|Perry|2004|p=91}}  Hendrix later questioned the choice and commented \"Everybody was scared to release 'Red House' in America because they said, 'America don't like the blues, man!'\"{{sfn|Fairchild|1994|p=12}}\n\n\"Red House\" finally saw an American release on July 30, 1969.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=168\u2013169}} [[Reprise Records]] issued a stereo mix of the version recorded at De Lane Lea/Olympic on the ''[[Smash Hits (The Jimi Hendrix Experience album)|Smash Hits]]'' compilation.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=28\u201329}} This version was later released internationally on the 1984 ''[[Kiss the Sky (Jimi Hendrix album)|Kiss the Sky]]'' compilation.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=553}}  The original mono take became available in the US and Canada when it was released  (without most of the studio talk at the end) on the 1994 ''[[Blues (Jimi Hendrix album)|Blues]]'' album.{{sfn|Fairchild|1994|p=21}}\n\n==Other recordings==\n{{quote box|quote=\"Although Hendrix seeks to follow roughly the same musical roadmap in each performance, visiting many of the same locations, he never takes the same route twice\"|source=\u2014Tom Wheeler & Joe Gore, ''Variations on a Theme: Red House'' (1992){{sfn|Wheeler|Gore|1992|p=3}}|width=25%|bgcolor = #E0E6F8 |align=right|style=padding:8px;}}\n\n\"Red House\" was a staple of Jimi Hendrix's concerts and [[jam session]]s and often his performances showed considerable variety.{{sfn|Wheeler|Gore|1992|p=3}} Some later renditions show [[B.B.

In August 2013, Nadal won in Montreal, denying Djokovic his fourth [[Canadian Open (tennis)|Rogers Cup]] title.<ref name=\"CO2013\" /> Nadal also defeated Djokovic in the 2013 US Open Final.\n\nNadal defeated Djokovic in the 2014 French Open final. Since the 2014 French Open Final, Djokovic has won seven consecutive meetings including a win in straight sets in the quarterfinals of the [[2015 French Open]] which ended Nadal's 39-match win streak at Stade Roland Garros and an opportunity for a sixth consecutive title, with Djokovic becoming only the second player after [[Robin S\u00f6derling]] to defeat Nadal at the event. Nadal easily defeated Djokovic in the 2017 Madrid Open semifinals (6\u20132, 6\u20134), his first victory against the Serb since the [[2014 French Open]]. When they next met Nadal beat Djokovic again, this time on clay in the 2018 Rome semifinals. They then met in the 2018 Wimbledon semifinals, where Djokovic finally emerged victorious after a battle lasting over five hours that was spread over two days and went to 10\u20138 in the fifth set. Then in the 2019 Australian Open final, Djokovic easily won in straight sets, marking Nadal's first straight-sets loss in a Grand Slam final. But in the 2019 Rome Masters final, it was Nadal who defeated the Serbian in three sets, and also the very first time in which either of them (Nadal) got a 6\u20130 win in a set.\n\n=== Nadal vs. Murray ===\nNadal and [[Andy Murray]] have met on 24 occasions since [[2007 ATP Tour|2007]], with Nadal leading 17\u20137.

Although this rivalry has less significance than rivalries with the other members of the Big Four, the pair have met in several prestigious tournaments. The rivalry saw Nadal winning the first 12 encounters, all in straight sets, including 2 finals, one of which is a Masters 1000 final at Madrid in 2013. However, since Wawrinka's breakthrough season in 2013 the pair has won an almost equal number of matches against each other (3\u20134) from 2014 onward.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rafael Nadal VS Stan Wawrinka|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/rafael-nadal-vs-stan-wawrinka/N409/W367|publisher=ATP World Tour|accessdate=11 April 2018}}</ref> Wawrinka scored his first win against Nadal in their most important encounter, the [[2014 Australian Open \u2013 Men's Singles|2014 Australian Open]] final in 4 sets, denying Nadal's double career slam. It was also the only match between the pair not resulting in a straight set win for either player.

Nadal and Ferrer had met in several prestigious tournaments and important matches. Ferrer won their first meeting in 2004 in Stuttgart in 3 sets, but Nadal went on to win the next four until Ferrer defeated him in the 4th round of the 2007 US Open. The pair met in their first tournament final in 2008, in Barcelona, where Nadal won in three sets. They met a year later again in the Barcelona final, with Nadal taking the title in straight sets. In 2010, the pair met in their first Masters 1000 final in Rome, where Nadal won in straight sets. Ferrer, however, would get his revenge in the 2011 Australian Open quarterfinal, defeating Nadal in straight sets for the first time in a grand slam.\n\nTheir biggest meeting, came in the 2013 French Open final. Ferrer was in his first major final, whereas Nadal was aiming for his 8th title at Roland Garros, and 13th overall. It was a straightforward victory for Nadal, 6\u20133, 6\u20132, 6\u20133. Between that meeting and 2015, Ferrer and Nadal would go on to play 6 more matches, with Nadal winning 4 of the 6.\n\nIn 2018, Ferrer announced that the US Open would be his last Grand Slam tournament, and he would retire the next year in the clay court season in Spain. Nadal and Ferrer had their first meeting since 2015 in the first round in the US Open. Ferrer's final grand slam match, however, ended in injury as he was forced to retire in the 2nd set against Nadal. Yet, in his second to last tournament in Barcelona, he would have one more meeting with Nadal. Although it was a straight sets victory it was a close match until the end, with the resilient Ferrer fighting until the last point. The overall score was 6\u20133, 6\u20133 in the final match between the two before Ferrer's retirement at the 2019 Madrid Open.\n\n=== Nadal vs. Del Potro ===\nNadal and [[Juan Martin del Potro]] have met 17 times, with Nadal leading {{tennis record|won=11|lost=6}}. Outside the Big 4, no active player has more wins against Nadal than Del Potro. The two have met in many prestigious tournaments, including at 3 of the 4 grand slams. Nadal won their first four meetings between 2007\u201309, however Del Potro went on to win the next three, including a straight sets victory at the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|2009 US Open]] SF (he later went on to win the tournament after defeating [[Roger Federer]] in the final. Their next major meeting came during the [[2011 Davis Cup]] final. Nadal went on to beat Del Potro in 4 sets to claim the Davis Cup for Spain, their fourth since 2004. Nadal in 2013 also denied Del Potro his first Masters 1000 title, with a victory in 3 sets at the [[2013 BNP Paribas Open|2013 Indian Wells Masters]]. However, Del Potro got his revenge, and had one of his most important victories against Nadal in the SF of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], beating him in three close sets (culminating with a tie break). Del Potro went on to claim the silver medal.\n\nAfter a long span of injuries with both players, the pair met in a Grand Slam for the first time since the R16 at Wimbledon in 2011 at the [[2017 US Open (tennis)|2017 US Open]]. Del Potro, facing Nadal after a victory in 4 sets against Federer, made it to the SF of a Grand Slam for the first time since 2013. However, the Spaniard got the better of him in that encounter, beating Del Potro in 4 sets. The pair then met in 3 of the 4 grand slam events in 2018, including a memorable match at the [[2018 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|2018 Wimbledon]] QF. The match went on for close to 5 hours, with Nadal coming out on top, 7\u20135, 6\u20137, 4\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20134. The pair had another meeting at the [[2018 US Open (tennis)|2018 US Open]], during which Nadal was forced to retire against Del Potro in the SF. Del Potro then went on to his first grand slam final since his victory in the 2009 US Open. He ended up losing in the final in straight sets to Novak Djokovic.\n\n=== Nadal vs. Berdych ===\nNadal and [[Tomas Berdych]] have met a total of 24 times, with Nadal leading {{tennis record|won=20|lost=4}}. Although this rivalry is lopsided mostly in favor of Nadal, the two have had some incredible matches in many prestigious tournaments. The pair have met at 2 of the 4 grand slams, with 3 meetings at the Australian Open and twice at Wimbledon, including the [[2010 Wimbledon Championships - Men's Singles|2010 final]]. Nadal and Berdych first met in an ATP tournament in [[2005 Swedish Open \u2013 Singles|B\u00e5stad]], where both men reached the final. Nadal won the match in 3 sets, in what was only his 8th title on the tour. Nadal and Berdych met a few more times in 2005-06, all in Masters 1000 tournaments. Out of their 4 matches, Berdych was able to win in 3, in Canada, Madrid, and Cincinnati. Their first meeting in a Grand Slam came at [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] in 2007. They met in the QF, where Nadal defeated Berdych in straight sets. Their next significant meeting was in the opening round of the [[2009_Davis_Cup_World_Group#Spain_vs._Czech_Republic|2009 Davis Cup Final]], where Nadal again defeated Berdych in straight sets. Spain went on to win the Davis Cup that year. \n\nTheir next meeting in a final came at a Grand Slam, in Wimbledon. Nadal had reached his 4th Wimbledon final, in an attempt to win his second title. Berdych had reached his first Grand Slam final, defeating Roger Federer in 4 sets in the quarterfinal and Novak Djokovic in straight sets in the SF. However the Spaniard was too good for the Czech in the final, and Nadal won in straight sets to take his 11th Grand Slam title. Their next meeting in a Grand Slam came only two years later in the [[2012 Australian Open - Men's Singles|2012 Australian Open]] quarterfinal, where Nadal won in 4 tight sets. Nadal would later go on to lose the [[2012 Australian Open \u2013 Men's singles final|final]] to Djokovic in 5 sets. After multiple meetings from 2012-2014, all of which were won by Nadal, the pair met again at the [[2015 Australian Open - Men's Singles|2015 Australian Open]] quarterfinal. Here, after 18 straight losses over 9 years, Berdych was able to claim a win over Nadal, and his only in a Grand Slam against the Spaniard. Berdych won the match in straight sets, including a bagel (6-0) in the second. The two met later in 2015 in Madrid, where Nadal won in straight sets.\n\nAfter a long gap of 4 years, Nadal and Berdych met most recently at the [[2019 Australian Open - Men's Singles|2019 Australian Open]] R16. After both players had prematurely ended their 2018 seasons with injuries, both had been playing very well in the 2019 season up to that point, with Berdych reaching the final in [[2019 Qatar ExxonMobil Open \u2013 Singles|Doha]]. However, like many of their meetings, Nadal dominated the Czech and beat him in straight sets. He later went on to make the final, where he lost in straight sets to Novak Djokovic.\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nNadal stands alone in the Open Era as the player with the most clay court titles (59), and holds an all-time record of 12 French Opens, 11 Monte-Carlo Masters and 11 Barcelona titles. He also stands alone with the longest single surface win streak in matches (clay courts, 81) and in sets (clay courts, 50) in the history of the Open Era.

Nadal was seeded second at Wimbledon, and was two points from defeat against American qualifier [[Robert Kendrick]] in the second round before coming back to win in five sets. In the third round, Nadal defeated No. 20 [[Andre Agassi]] in straight sets in Agassi's last career match at Wimbledon. Nadal also won his next three matches in straight sets, which set up his first Wimbledon final, which was against Federer, who had won this tournament the three previous years. Nadal was the first Spanish man since [[Manuel Santana]] in 1966, to reach the Wimbledon final, but Federer won the match in four sets to win his fourth consecutive [[Wimbledon 2006|Wimbledon]] title.\n\nDuring the lead up to the [[2006 US Open (tennis)|US Open]], Nadal played the two Masters Series tournaments in North America.

To end the year, Nadal won two of his three-round robin matches to advance to the semifinals of the [[Tennis Masters Cup]] in Shanghai, where Federer defeated him in straight sets.\n\nDuring the second half of the year, Nadal battled a knee injury suffered during the Wimbledon final. In addition, there were rumors at the end of the year that the foot injury he suffered during 2005, caused long-term damage, which were given credence by coach [[Toni Nadal]]'s claim that the problem was \"serious\".

Nadal defeated Murray in three consecutive Grand Slam semifinals in 2011 from the [[2011 French Open|French Open]] to the [[2011 US Open (tennis)|US Open]]. They have never met in a Grand Slam final, but Murray leads 3\u20131 in [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] finals, with Nadal winning at [[2009 BNP Paribas Open|Indian Wells]] in [[2009 ATP World Tour|2009]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7958375.stm|title=Nadal blows Murray away in final|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 March 2009|accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref> and Murray winning in [[2009 ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament|Rotterdam]] the same year,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tennis/7891311.stm|title=Murray beats Nadal to take title|publisher=BBC Sport|date=15 February 2009|accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref> [[2011 Rakuten Japan Open Tennis Championships|Tokyo]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/tennis/15231444|title=Andy Murray defeats Rafael Nadal in Japan Open final|publisher=BBC Sport|date=9 October 2011|accessdate=6 February 2012}}</ref> in [[2011 ATP World Tour|2011]], and [[2015 Mutua Madrid Open|Madrid]] in [[2015 ATP World Tour|2015]].\n\n=== Nadal vs. Wawrinka ===\nNadal  and [[Stan Wawrinka]] have met 20 times, with Nadal leading {{tennis record|won=17|lost=3}}. Although this rivalry has less significance than rivalries with the other members of the Big Four, the pair have met in several prestigious tournaments. The rivalry saw Nadal winning the first 12 encounters, all in straight sets, including 2 finals, one of which is a Masters 1000 final at Madrid in 2013. However, since Wawrinka's breakthrough season in 2013 the pair has won an almost equal number of matches against each other (3\u20134) from 2014 onward.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rafael Nadal VS Stan Wawrinka|url=http://www.atpworldtour.com/en/players/fedex-head-2-head/rafael-nadal-vs-stan-wawrinka/N409/W367|publisher=ATP World Tour|accessdate=11 April 2018}}</ref> Wawrinka scored his first win against Nadal in their most important encounter, the [[2014 Australian Open \u2013 Men's Singles|2014 Australian Open]] final in 4 sets, denying Nadal's double career slam. It was also the only match between the pair not resulting in a straight set win for either player. Nadal won their second Grand Slam final, at the 2017 French Open.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tennis/2017/06/11/rafael-nadal-vs-stan-wawrinka-french-open-final-live-score/|title=Rafael Nadal beats Stan Wawrinka in straight sets to win his 10th French Open title|website=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=10 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== Nadal vs. Ferrer ===\nNadal and compatriot [[David Ferrer]] met a total of 32 times, with the total record ending {{tennis record|won=26|lost=6}} in favor of Nadal with Ferrer's retirement. Nadal and Ferrer had met in several prestigious tournaments and important matches. Ferrer won their first meeting in 2004 in Stuttgart in 3 sets, but Nadal went on to win the next four until Ferrer defeated him in the 4th round of the 2007 US Open. The pair met in their first tournament final in 2008, in Barcelona, where Nadal won in three sets. They met a year later again in the Barcelona final, with Nadal taking the title in straight sets. In 2010, the pair met in their first Masters 1000 final in Rome, where Nadal won in straight sets. Ferrer, however, would get his revenge in the 2011 Australian Open quarterfinal, defeating Nadal in straight sets for the first time in a grand slam.\n\nTheir biggest meeting, came in the 2013 French Open final. Ferrer was in his first major final, whereas Nadal was aiming for his 8th title at Roland Garros, and 13th overall. It was a straightforward victory for Nadal, 6\u20133, 6\u20132, 6\u20133. Between that meeting and 2015, Ferrer and Nadal would go on to play 6 more matches, with Nadal winning 4 of the 6.\n\nIn 2018, Ferrer announced that the US Open would be his last Grand Slam tournament, and he would retire the next year in the clay court season in Spain. Nadal and Ferrer had their first meeting since 2015 in the first round in the US Open. Ferrer's final grand slam match, however, ended in injury as he was forced to retire in the 2nd set against Nadal. Yet, in his second to last tournament in Barcelona, he would have one more meeting with Nadal. Although it was a straight sets victory it was a close match until the end, with the resilient Ferrer fighting until the last point. The overall score was 6\u20133, 6\u20133 in the final match between the two before Ferrer's retirement at the 2019 Madrid Open.\n\n=== Nadal vs. Del Potro ===\nNadal and [[Juan Martin del Potro]] have met 17 times, with Nadal leading {{tennis record|won=11|lost=6}}. Outside the Big 4, no active player has more wins against Nadal than Del Potro. The two have met in many prestigious tournaments, including at 3 of the 4 grand slams. Nadal won their first four meetings between 2007\u201309, however Del Potro went on to win the next three, including a straight sets victory at the [[2009 US Open (tennis)|2009 US Open]] SF (he later went on to win the tournament after defeating [[Roger Federer]] in the final. Their next major meeting came during the [[2011 Davis Cup]] final. Nadal went on to beat Del Potro in 4 sets to claim the Davis Cup for Spain, their fourth since 2004. Nadal in 2013 also denied Del Potro his first Masters 1000 title, with a victory in 3 sets at the [[2013 BNP Paribas Open|2013 Indian Wells Masters]]. However, Del Potro got his revenge, and had one of his most important victories against Nadal in the SF of the [[2016 Summer Olympics]], beating him in three close sets (culminating with a tie break). Del Potro went on to claim the silver medal.\n\nAfter a long span of injuries with both players, the pair met in a Grand Slam for the first time since the R16 at Wimbledon in 2011 at the [[2017 US Open (tennis)|2017 US Open]]. Del Potro, facing Nadal after a victory in 4 sets against Federer, made it to the SF of a Grand Slam for the first time since 2013. However, the Spaniard got the better of him in that encounter, beating Del Potro in 4 sets. The pair then met in 3 of the 4 grand slam events in 2018, including a memorable match at the [[2018 Wimbledon Championships \u2013 Men's Singles|2018 Wimbledon]] QF. The match went on for close to 5 hours, with Nadal coming out on top, 7\u20135, 6\u20137, 4\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20134. The pair had another meeting at the [[2018 US Open (tennis)|2018 US Open]], during which Nadal was forced to retire against Del Potro in the SF. Del Potro then went on to his first grand slam final since his victory in the 2009 US Open. He ended up losing in the final in straight sets to Novak Djokovic.\n\n=== Nadal vs. Berdych ===\nNadal and [[Tomas Berdych]] have met a total of 24 times, with Nadal leading {{tennis record|won=20|lost=4}}. Although this rivalry is lopsided mostly in favor of Nadal, the two have had some incredible matches in many prestigious tournaments. The pair have met at 2 of the 4 grand slams, with 3 meetings at the Australian Open and twice at Wimbledon, including the [[2010 Wimbledon Championships - Men's Singles|2010 final]]. Nadal and Berdych first met in an ATP tournament in [[2005 Swedish Open \u2013 Singles|B\u00e5stad]], where both men reached the final. Nadal won the match in 3 sets, in what was only his 8th title on the tour. Nadal and Berdych met a few more times in 2005-06, all in Masters 1000 tournaments. Out of their 4 matches, Berdych was able to win in 3, in Canada, Madrid, and Cincinnati. Their first meeting in a Grand Slam came at [[Wimbledon Championships|Wimbledon]] in 2007. They met in the QF, where Nadal defeated Berdych in straight sets. Their next significant meeting was in the opening round of the [[2009_Davis_Cup_World_Group#Spain_vs._Czech_Republic|2009 Davis Cup Final]], where Nadal again defeated Berdych in straight sets. Spain went on to win the Davis Cup that year. \n\nTheir next meeting in a final came at a Grand Slam, in Wimbledon. Nadal had reached his 4th Wimbledon final, in an attempt to win his second title. Berdych had reached his first Grand Slam final, defeating Roger Federer in 4 sets in the quarterfinal and Novak Djokovic in straight sets in the SF. However the Spaniard was too good for the Czech in the final, and Nadal won in straight sets to take his 11th Grand Slam title. Their next meeting in a Grand Slam came only two years later in the [[2012 Australian Open - Men's Singles|2012 Australian Open]] quarterfinal, where Nadal won in 4 tight sets. Nadal would later go on to lose the [[2012 Australian Open \u2013 Men's singles final|final]] to Djokovic in 5 sets. After multiple meetings from 2012-2014, all of which were won by Nadal, the pair met again at the [[2015 Australian Open - Men's Singles|2015 Australian Open]] quarterfinal. Here, after 18 straight losses over 9 years, Berdych was able to claim a win over Nadal, and his only in a Grand Slam against the Spaniard. Berdych won the match in straight sets, including a bagel (6-0) in the second. The two met later in 2015 in Madrid, where Nadal won in straight sets.\n\nAfter a long gap of 4 years, Nadal and Berdych met most recently at the [[2019 Australian Open - Men's Singles|2019 Australian Open]] R16. After both players had prematurely ended their 2018 seasons with injuries, both had been playing very well in the 2019 season up to that point, with Berdych reaching the final in [[2019 Qatar ExxonMobil Open \u2013 Singles|Doha]]. However, like many of their meetings, Nadal dominated the Czech and beat him in straight sets. He later went on to make the final, where he lost in straight sets to Novak Djokovic.\n\n== Legacy ==\n\nNadal stands alone in the Open Era as the player with the most clay court titles (59), and holds an all-time record of 12 French Opens, 11 Monte-Carlo Masters and 11 Barcelona titles. He also stands alone with the longest single surface win streak in matches (clay courts, 81) and in sets (clay courts, 50) in the history of the Open Era. Due to these achievements, many have called Nadal \"The King of Clay\",{{efn|See:<ref name=\"Plain Dealer King of Clay\">{{cite news |title='King of Clay' Rafael Nadal outlasts Novak Djokovic in

that you walk out there, you give everything you have from the very first point to the end no matter what the score. And you're willing to lay it all out on the line and you're not afraid to let the people see that.\"\n\nFormer ATP world no. 1 and coach of Nadal, [[Carlos Moya]], remembers the first time he played Nadal in Germany, when he was 22 and Rafa was just 12. He shared the account in the book \"Facing Nadal\" by Scoop Malimowski: \"I met him for the first time in Stuttgart. He was playing an under 12s and I was playing the Masters event.

As a record chart hit in several countries and the opening number on the Experience's debut American album, it was many people's first exposure to Hendrix's [[psychedelic rock]] sound.\n\nThe song features his inventive guitar playing, which uses the signature [[Hendrix chord]] and a mix of blues and Eastern modalities, shaped by novel sound processing techniques.  Because of ambiguities in the lyrics, listeners often interpret the song as referring to a [[psychedelic experience]], although Hendrix described it as a love song.\n\n\"Purple Haze\" is one of Hendrix's best-known songs and appears on many Hendrix compilation albums.  The song featured regularly in concerts and each of Hendrix's group configurations issued live recordings. It was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] and is included on lists of the greatest guitar songs, including at number two by ''Rolling Stone'' and number one by ''Q'' magazine.\n\n==Background and recording==\nBy January 5, 1967, the Jimi Hendrix Experience's first single, \"[[Hey Joe]]\", backed with \"[[Stone Free]]\", had peaked at number six on the UK record chart.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=28}} \"Hey Joe\" was not a Hendrix composition \u2013 it was written by [[Billy Roberts]] and recorded by several groups prior to the Experience. Hendrix commented, \"That record isn't us. The next one's gonna be different.  We're working on an LP which will mainly be our stuff.\"{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=95}} The group recorded several demos of original material at studios in London, including \"Can You See Me\", \"[[Foxy Lady]]\", \"[[Third Stone from the Sun]]\", \"[[Red House (song)|Red House]]\", and \"Remember\".{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=27\u201329}}  In the middle of December, producer [[Chas Chandler]] heard Hendrix toying around with a new guitar riff. \"I heard him playing it at the flat and was knocked out. I told him to keep working on that, saying, 'That's the next single!{{'\"}}{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=32}}  Chandler claimed that after some more urging, Hendrix wrote the rest of \"Purple Haze\" in the dressing room of a London club during the afternoon of December 26, 1966, before a gig.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|1992|p=31}} In several interviews, Hendrix spoke about writing the song, but did not mention where or when he wrote it.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=149}}\n\nThe Experience began recording \"Purple Haze\" on January 11, 1967, at [[De Lane Lea Studios]] in London. According to drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]], he and bassist [[Noel Redding]] learned the song in the studio: \"Hendrix came in and kind of hummed us the riff and showed Noel the chords and the changes. I listened to it and we went, 'OK, let's do it.' We got it on the third take as I recall.\"{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=96}} The basic track was recorded in four hours, according to Chandler.{{sfn|McDermott|Cox|Kramer|1995|p=25}}  [[Multitrack recording]] technology allowed engineers to record and complete additional parts on the final master.  After the basic track was finished, Chandler explained that he and Hendrix developed the song:\n{{quote|With 'Purple Haze', Hendrix and I were striving for a sound and just kept going back in [to the studio], two hours at a time, trying to achieve it. It wasn't like we were there for days on end.  We recorded it, and then Hendrix and I would be sitting at home saying, 'Let's try that.' Then we would go in for an hour or two. That's how it was in those days. However long it took to record one specific idea, that's how long we would book. We kept going in and out.{{sfn|McDermott|Cox|Kramer|1995|p=25}}}}  Redding and Mitchell were not included in the process because Chandler felt that it was more efficient for him and Hendrix to do it alone.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=33}} To get a better quality recording, Chandler took the four-track tape recorded at De Lane Lea to [[Olympic Studios]] for [[overdubbing]] (although Hendrix had worked with eight-track recording in the US, it was not yet available in the UK).{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=35\u201336}} At Olympic, they were assigned [[Eddie Kramer]], who, as a sound engineer, played an important role in subsequent Hendrix recordings.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=35}} Hendrix added new vocals and guitar parts between February 3 and 8, 1967.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=35\u201336}}  Unlike the conventional techniques used by the Experience to record previous songs, Chandler decided to try out new effects and sounds for \"Purple Haze\".{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=32}} He enhanced background sounds (some contributed by Redding) by playing them back through headphones, which were moved around the recording microphone, creating \"a weird echo\".{{sfn|McDermott|Cox|Kramer|1995|p=27}} Chandler also used sped-up guitar parts recorded at half-speed (which also raises the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]) and [[Panning (audio)|panning]] to create novel effects.{{sfn|McDermott|Cox|Kramer|1995|p=27}} The guitar solo features the first use of the [[Octavia (effects pedal)|Octavia]] guitar effects unit.{{sfn|McDermott|Cox|Kramer|1995|p=27}}  Acoustical and electronics engineer [[Roger Mayer (engineer)|Roger Mayer]] developed the unit with input from Hendrix. The Octavia doubles the frequency of the sound it is fed, essentially adding an upper octave.<ref name=\"Mayer\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.roger-mayer.co.uk/octavia.htm\n| title = Octavia\n| website = Roger Mayer\n| accessdate = July 7, 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n==Lyrics and interpretation==\nIn interviews, Hendrix usually gave different answers about the development of the song's lyrics.  Biographer [[Harry Shapiro (author)|Harry Shapiro]] points out that \"Purple Haze\" is most likely \"a pot-pourri of ideas\" which Hendrix developed over time.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=149}}  As a fan of science fiction, he frequently incorporated its imagery in his songwriting.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=96}}  Hendrix read ''[[Night of Light]]'', a 1966 novel by [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]], that expanded on a short story published in 1957.{{sfn|Roby|2002|p=67}}  In the story set on a distant planet, sunspots produce a \"purplish haze\" which has a disorienting effect on the inhabitants.{{sfn|Roby|Schreiber|2010|p=158}}{{efn|The phrase \"purple haze\" appears in literature, including in [[Charles Dickens]]' 1861 novel ''[[Great Expectations]]'': \"There was the red sun, on the low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into black\" (Chapter 54).}}  An early handwritten draft by Hendrix, titled \"Purple Haze \u2013 Jesus Saves\", uses dream-like imagery where the sense of direction and time is distorted.{{sfn|Hendrix|2003|p=131}}  In an interview on January 28, 1967, before the song was completed, Hendrix was asked how he wrote songs; he responded, \"I dream a lot and I put my dreams down as songs. I wrote one called 'First Look Around the Corner' and another called 'The Purple Haze,' which was about a dream I had that I was walking under the sea.\"{{sfn|Roby|2002|p=67}}{{efn|The Hendrix song \"[[Are You Experienced? (song)|Are You Experienced?]]\", recorded in April 1967 and included as the title track for the Experience's debut album, includes a reference to walking under the sea: \"We'll hold hands and then we'll watch the sunrise, from the bottom of the sea\".{{sfn|Hendrix|2003|p=21}}}}  He later expressed frustration that he was unable to more fully develop his ideas for the song:\n{{quote|You know the song we had named 'Purple Haze'? [It] had about a thousand, thousand words&nbsp;... I had it all written out.  It was about going through, through this land.  This mythical&nbsp;... because that's what I like to do is write a lot of mythical scenes.  You know, like the history of the wars on Neptune.{{sfn|Roby|2002|p=67}}}}\nSo far, only a crumpled single sheet of ruled yellow tablet paper is on exhibit at the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and does not include any of the lyrics used in the Experience song.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| url = http://rockhall.com/photo-gallery/spotlight-artifacts/1531/\n| title = Jimi Hendrix \"Purple Haze' Lyrics, 1966\n| website = [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]\n| accessdate = October 25, 2014\n}}</ref>  Chandler admitted that in the early stages, he helped Hendrix shape the songs and lyrics to radio single length.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=147}}  Biographer Keith Shadwick comments that although much of the complexity may have been sacrificed, it resulted in verses that are \"simple, focused and striking\".{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=96}}\n \nAfter its release, Hendrix offered another explanation: \"He [the song's protagonist] likes this girl so much, that he doesn't know what [state] he's in, ya know.  A sort of daze, I suppose.  That's what the song is all about.\"{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=149}}  This draws on an experience Hendrix had while still in New York, where he felt that a girl was attempting to use [[Louisiana Voodoo|voodoo]] to trap him and he became ill.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=148}}  Shapiro believes that this is reflected in most of the first two verses:{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=148}}\n{{poemquote|Purple haze all around, don't know if I'm coming up or down\nAm I happy or in misery, whatever it is that girl put a spell on me}}\n\nMany fans and the press interpret the song as referring to a psychedelic experience due to lines such as \"purple haze all in my brain\" and \"'scuse me while I kiss the sky\".{{sfn|Roby|2002|p=67}}  However, Hendrix and those closest to him never discussed any connection between [[psychedelic drug]]s and the song, although Shapiro admits that, at the time, to do so would have been \"professional suicide\".{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=148}} Chandler, who claimed he was present when Hendrix wrote it, later denied suggestions that Hendrix did so while under the influence of psychedelics.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|1992|p=31}}<ref name=\"Ruhlmann\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.allmusic.com/song/purple-haze-mt0004552447\n| title = Jimi Hendrix/Jimi Hendrix Experience: Purple Haze \u2013 Song Review\n| last = Ruhlmann\n| first = William\n| website = [[AllMusic]]\n| accessdate = July 5, 2014\n| ref = harv\n}}</ref>  Commenting on the lyrics, Shadwick concludes \"the music [was allowed] to tell the larger story.  Poised effectively between the twin intoxicants of drugs and desire, they could be interpreted to the listener's taste\".{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=96}}{{efn|Three months after the UK single release, the Experience performed at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] on June 18, 1967.

As a record chart hit in several countries and the opening number on the Experience's debut American album, it was many people's first exposure to Hendrix's [[psychedelic rock]] sound.\n\nThe song features his inventive guitar playing, which uses the signature [[Hendrix chord]] and a mix of blues and Eastern modalities, shaped by novel sound processing techniques.  Because of ambiguities in the lyrics, listeners often interpret the song as referring to a [[psychedelic experience]], although Hendrix described it as a love song.\n\n\"Purple Haze\" is one of Hendrix's best-known songs and appears on many Hendrix compilation albums.  The song featured regularly in concerts and each of Hendrix's group configurations issued live recordings. It was inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] and is included on lists of the greatest guitar songs, including at number two by ''Rolling Stone'' and number one by ''Q'' magazine.\n\n==Background and recording==\nBy January 5, 1967, the Jimi Hendrix Experience's first single, \"[[Hey Joe]]\", backed with \"[[Stone Free]]\", had peaked at number six on the UK record chart.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=28}} \"Hey Joe\" was not a Hendrix composition \u2013 it was written by [[Billy Roberts]] and recorded by several groups prior to the Experience. Hendrix commented, \"That record isn't us. The next one's gonna be different.  We're working on an LP which will mainly be our stuff.\"{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=95}} The group recorded several demos of original material at studios in London, including \"Can You See Me\", \"[[Foxy Lady]]\", \"[[Third Stone from the Sun]]\", \"[[Red House (song)|Red House]]\", and \"Remember\".{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=27\u201329}}  In the middle of December, producer [[Chas Chandler]] heard Hendrix toying around with a new guitar riff. \"I heard him playing it at the flat and was knocked out. I told him to keep working on that, saying, 'That's the next single!{{'\"}}{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=32}}  Chandler claimed that after some more urging, Hendrix wrote the rest of \"Purple Haze\" in the dressing room of a London club during the afternoon of December 26, 1966, before a gig.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|1992|p=31}} In several interviews, Hendrix spoke about writing the song, but did not mention where or when he wrote it.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=149}}\n\nThe Experience began recording \"Purple Haze\" on January 11, 1967, at [[De Lane Lea Studios]] in London. According to drummer [[Mitch Mitchell]], he and bassist [[Noel Redding]] learned the song in the studio: \"Hendrix came in and kind of hummed us the riff and showed Noel the chords and the changes. I listened to it and we went, 'OK, let's do it.' We got it on the third take as I recall.\"{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=96}} The basic track was recorded in four hours, according to Chandler.{{sfn|McDermott|Cox|Kramer|1995|p=25}}  [[Multitrack recording]] technology allowed engineers to record and complete additional parts on the final master.  After the basic track was finished, Chandler explained that he and Hendrix developed the song:\n{{quote|With 'Purple Haze', Hendrix and I were striving for a sound and just kept going back in [to the studio], two hours at a time, trying to achieve it. It wasn't like we were there for days on end.  We recorded it, and then Hendrix and I would be sitting at home saying, 'Let's try that.' Then we would go in for an hour or two. That's how it was in those days. However long it took to record one specific idea, that's how long we would book. We kept going in and out.{{sfn|McDermott|Cox|Kramer|1995|p=25}}}}  Redding and Mitchell were not included in the process because Chandler felt that it was more efficient for him and Hendrix to do it alone.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=33}} To get a better quality recording, Chandler took the four-track tape recorded at De Lane Lea to [[Olympic Studios]] for [[overdubbing]] (although Hendrix had worked with eight-track recording in the US, it was not yet available in the UK).{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=35\u201336}} At Olympic, they were assigned [[Eddie Kramer]], who, as a sound engineer, played an important role in subsequent Hendrix recordings.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=35}} Hendrix added new vocals and guitar parts between February 3 and 8, 1967.{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|pp=35\u201336}}  Unlike the conventional techniques used by the Experience to record previous songs, Chandler decided to try out new effects and sounds for \"Purple Haze\".{{sfn|McDermott|Kramer|Cox|2009|p=32}} He enhanced background sounds (some contributed by Redding) by playing them back through headphones, which were moved around the recording microphone, creating \"a weird echo\".{{sfn|McDermott|Cox|Kramer|1995|p=27}} Chandler also used sped-up guitar parts recorded at half-speed (which also raises the [[Pitch (music)|pitch]]) and [[Panning (audio)|panning]] to create novel effects.{{sfn|McDermott|Cox|Kramer|1995|p=27}} The guitar solo features the first use of the [[Octavia (effects pedal)|Octavia]] guitar effects unit.{{sfn|McDermott|Cox|Kramer|1995|p=27}}  Acoustical and electronics engineer [[Roger Mayer (engineer)|Roger Mayer]] developed the unit with input from Hendrix. The Octavia doubles the frequency of the sound it is fed, essentially adding an upper octave.<ref name=\"Mayer\">\n{{cite web\n| url = http://www.roger-mayer.co.uk/octavia.htm\n| title = Octavia\n| website = Roger Mayer\n| accessdate = July 7, 2014\n}}</ref>\n\n==Lyrics and interpretation==\nIn interviews, Hendrix usually gave different answers about the development of the song's lyrics.  Biographer [[Harry Shapiro (author)|Harry Shapiro]] points out that \"Purple Haze\" is most likely \"a pot-pourri of ideas\" which Hendrix developed over time.{{sfn|Shapiro|Glebbeek|1990|p=149}}  As a fan of science fiction, he frequently incorporated its imagery in his songwriting.{{sfn|Shadwick|2003|p=96}}  Hendrix read ''[[Night of Light]]'', a 1966 novel by [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]], that expanded on a short story published in 1957.{{sfn|Roby|2002|p=67}}  In the story set on a distant planet, sunspots produce a \"purplish haze\" which has a disorienting effect on the inhabitants.{{sfn|Roby|Schreiber|2010|p=158}}{{efn|The phrase \"purple haze\" appears in literature, including in [[Charles Dickens]]' 1861 novel ''[[Great Expectations]]'': \"There was the red sun, on the low level of the shore, in a purple haze, fast deepening into black\" (Chapter 54).}}  An early handwritten draft by Hendrix, titled \"Purple Haze \u2013 Jesus Saves\", uses dream-like imagery where the sense of direction and time is distorted.{{sfn|Hendrix|2003|p=131}}  In an interview on January 28, 1967, before the song was completed, Hendrix was asked how he wrote songs; he responded, \"I dream a lot and I put my dreams down as songs. I wrote one called 'First Look Around the Corner' and another called 'The Purple Haze,' which was about a dream I had that I was walking under the sea.\"{{sfn|Roby|2002|p=67}}{{efn|The Hendrix song \"[[Are You Experienced? (song)|Are You Experienced?]]\", recorded in April 1967 and included as the title track for the Experience's debut album, includes a reference to walking under the sea: \"We'll hold hands and then we'll watch the sunrise, from the bottom of the sea\".{{sfn|Hendrix|2003|p=21}}}}  He later expressed frustration that he was unable to more fully develop his ideas for the song:\n{{quote|You know the song we had named 'Purple Haze'?

It tells the tale of six teens who break into the abandoned mental institution, the [[Danvers State Hospital]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe Danvers State Hospital, located just outside [[Boston]], Massachusetts, was built in 1878 and condemned in 1992. It is rumored by locals to be the birthplace of the pre-frontal [[lobotomy]]. The novel begins at 7 AM, with Derik riding up to the Danvers State Hospital in his car. Looking at the crumbling brick building, he starts to think of the people that were locked up in there, the people who died after spending their lives there. The unmarked mass graves around the premises, the tunnels, and the messed up remnants of its former patients. He knows this is the place. The place where he'd make his movie. Derik is flunking out of school, and he decides to submit his film to a contest and save himself from a future of flipping burgers at his parents' diner. He gathers a cast of different backgrounds, and the eve before the hospitals' demolition, they break in. He gets more than he bargained for when the eerie experience changes his life. Forever.\n\n== Characters ==\n'''Derik''': The director of the movie, his love interest is Liza. He is an underachiever who wants to achieve something big before he graduates.\n\n'''Mimi''': The goth of the group. Her motive for helping Derik is to investigate the life of her grandma, who was a patient at the hospital. She makes it her duty to rescue Christine Belle's doll; Christy after discovering her journal. Develops a strong bond\n\n'''Greta''': One of two \"drama kids\" in the group. She aspires to be like actress [[Greta Garbo]] in every way possible.  Her boyfriend is Tony. Greta's motive for working on Derik's film is the opportunity to be on television and possibly launch her acting career.\n\n'''Tony''': One of two \"drama kids\" in the group. His girlfriend is Greta. Tony's motive for visiting the hospital is identical to Greta's.\n\n'''Chet''': The jokester of the group. His dad is an alcoholic, which leads to a black eye. Chet's motive for helping out Derik is the opportunity to spend a night away from his troubled home life. It is hinted that he has a crush on Mimi.\n\n'''Liza''': The braniac of the group, and Derik's love interest. Liza is wait-listed for admission to [[Harvard University]].  Her school guidance counselor advises her to try to get involved in more extra-curricular activities, which leads to her agreeing to help Derik with his film.\n\n== References ==\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=IadtGQAACAAJ&dq ''Project 17'' at Google Books]\n*[https://www.amazon.com/Project-17-Laurie-Faria-Stolarz/dp/0786838566 ''Project 17'' at Amazon]\n\n== External links ==\n*{{official website|http://www.lauriestolarz.com/novels/project_17.html}}\n*[http://www.danversstateinsaneasylum.com/ Hospital's official website ]\n\n[[Category:2007 American novels]]\n[[Category:American young adult novels]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Boston]]\n[[Category:Ghost novels]]\n", "text_old": "{{notability|date=February 2017}}\n{{Infobox book\n| name          = Project 17\n| image         = Project17.JPG\n| caption = The US cover for ''Project 17''\n| author        = Laurie Faria Stolarz\n| cover_artist  =\n| country       =\n| language      = English\n| series        =\n| genre         = [[Young adult novel]]\n| publisher     = [[Hyperion Books]]\n| pub_date      = December 1, 2007\n| media_type    = Print ([[Hardcover|Hardback]] & [[Paperback]])\n| pages         =\n| isbn          = 0-7868-3856-6\n| congress= PZ7.S8757 Pr 2007\n| oclc= 124036172\n| preceded_by   = \n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n'''''Project 17''''' is a [[young adult fiction|young adult]] novel, written by [[Laurie Faria Stolarz]], published by [[Hyperion Books]] in 2007.

It introduces each of the main characters, as well as establishes the basic premises of the series, which details the beginnings of a curse placed upon the [[Enchanted Forest]] and the start of a destiny for its only savior, a present-day woman who can break the curse.\n\nThe episode was co-written by [[Edward Kitsis]] and [[Adam Horowitz (screenwriter)|Adam Horowitz]], and was directed by [[Mark Mylod]]. Kitsis and Horowitz sought to write new perspectives of familiar characters, and featured the themes of hope, family and motherhood. \"Pilot\" sets the template for the rest of the series, as it jumps between their cursed selves in Storybrooke, Maine and their original lives in the Enchanted Forest. Every actor first approached for the series accepted after being sent a script; this included [[Ginnifer Goodwin]] as Snow White and [[Jennifer Morrison]] as Emma Swan.\n\nBefore it made its debut, ABC allowed viewers in the United States to see the pilot on the [[Internet Movie Database]]'s website several days before it aired. It premiered in the United States on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on October 23, 2011. In Canada, [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] broadcast the series an hour ahead of ABC's debut, airing it at 7&nbsp;pm in most regions. The episode received mostly positive reviews and was watched by 12.93 million viewers, scoring a 4.0 rating/11% share in the 18-49 demographic, ranking first in its timeslot. It was ABC's most watched pilot since the [[Pilot (Ugly Betty)|first episode]] of ''[[Ugly Betty]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n===Opening sequence===\nA title card which states \"Once Upon a Time...\"\n\n===In the characters' past===\n[[David Nolan (Once Upon a Time)|Prince Charming]] ([[Joshua Dallas]]) rides to the rescue of [[Mary Margaret Blanchard|Snow White]] ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]), who is comatose after eating a poisoned apple that was given to her by the [[Regina Mills|Evil Queen]] ([[Lana Parrilla]]). Doc informs Charming that he is too late, but Charming kisses Snow regardless, breaking the curse. On the wedding day of Snow White and Prince Charming, the Evil Queen arrives and delivers an ominous threat about a powerful curse she intends to release upon them. Some time later, a pregnant Snow White is worried about the curse and visits [[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin]] ([[Robert Carlyle]]) in prison, who issues a prophecy that the Queen's curse will take them all someplace terrible where there will be no happy endings. He also reveals that Snow White's unborn daughter, [[Emma Swan]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]), will return when she is 28 years old to rescue them, thus beginning a crucial battle with the Queen. Following the [[Blue Fairy]]'s ([[Keegan Connor Tracy]]) advice, [[Mister Geppetto|Geppetto]] ([[Tony Amendola]]) and [[Pinocchio]] ([[Jakob Davies]]) fashion a wardrobe from a magical tree which will allow one person to escape the Queen's curse. On the day Snow White gives birth to her daughter, the Queen's curse strikes. Prince Charming places their daughter in the magic wardrobe, but is mortally wounded battling the Queen's henchmen. The Queen stands triumphantly over Snow White and Prince Charming\u2019s body, as the Curse takes them \"somewhere horrible.\"\n\n===In Boston===\nIn Present-day [[Boston]], Emma Swan (Morrison) lives a lonely existence working as a [[bail bondsman]] and [[bounty hunter]]. On her 28th birthday, she is approached by a ten-year-old boy, Henry ([[Jared S. Gilmore]]), who identifies himself as her son, whom she had given up for adoption as a teenager. Not wanting a relationship with him, Emma agrees to drive him back to his home in Storybrooke, [[Maine]]. Along the way, Henry shows her a large book of fairy tales he has, correctly insisting that all of the stories in it are real.Henry also tries to convince Emma that she is the product of true love and she needs to break a curse the evil queen [[Lana Parrilla]] has casted over many fairy tale characters including her family.\n\n===In Storybrooke===\nWhen they arrive in Storybrooke, Henry informs her that everyone in town is in reality a fairy tale character, exiled by the curse and with no memory of their real identities. This includes his therapist Archie Hopper ([[Raphael Sbarge]]), who is really [[Jiminy Cricket]], and his teacher Mary Margaret Blanchard (Goodwin), who is really Snow White. Henry claims that time is frozen in Storybrooke and the people are unable to leave, but that the curse will be broken by Emma. A skeptical Emma returns Henry to his adopted mother, the town Mayor, Regina (Parrilla), who is really the Evil Queen. Emma attempts to leave but after having drunk apple cider given to her by the Mayor and nearly hitting a wolf she has a car accident where she is knocked out. While unconscious, she is arrested and taken to Storybrooke Jail for supposedly [[drunk driving]]. When Henry runs away again, Emma makes a deal with the Mayor and Sheriff Graham ([[Jamie Dornan]]): if they release her, she will find him. After exhausting all possibilities she speaks with Mary Margaret, who tells Emma to \"Check his castle.\" After finding Henry at a wooden jungle gym (which bears a resemblance to Prince Charming's castle), they talk and Emma decides to stay in Storybrooke temporarily, especially after Regina warns her to leave town. This leads Emma to be suspicious of the mayor's motives.\n\nShortly after her conversation with Emma, Mary Margaret volunteers at Storybrooke Hospital, placing flowers at the bedside of patients. She stops in the ICU where a [[John Doe]] (Dallas) (who is actually Prince Charming) is sleeping in a coma. Mary Margaret is unaware of who he is. Meanwhile, at the Mayor's home, Regina takes the book from Henry's room and goes downstairs to look at her mirror, with an expression that seems to acknowledge she is aware of her fairy tale existence.\n\nAs Emma arrives at Granny's Bed & Breakfast, she is given a key to her room by the elderly proprietor (Beverley Elliot), who is actually Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother from ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]''. She comes downstairs after yelling at Ruby ([[Meghan Ory]]), her granddaughter, who is actually Little Red Riding Hood. followed by a man who came to collect money: Mr. Gold (Carlyle), who is actually Rumplestiltskin, who also helped build and owns the entire town. When Emma mentions her name, Mr. Gold pauses as if he knew something about her. Emma's decision to stay in Storybrooke causes the hands of the town clock, previously frozen at 8:15, to begin moving again, indicating that the Dark Curse is beginning to weaken, as Henry watches from his room, smiling.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\nOn February 1, 2011, ABC ordered six new pilots for their [[2011\u201312 United States network television schedule|2011\u20132012 television schedule]], which included ''Once Upon a Time''.<ref name=ignpilotorders>{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/114/1147128p1.html | title=Lost Writers' Once Upon a Time Among ABC Pilot Orders |first=Eric |last=Goldman |publisher=[[IGN]] |date= February 1, 2011 |accessdate=January 3, 2012}}</ref> The premiere episode was co-written by series co-creators [[Edward Kitsis]] and [[Adam Horowitz (screenwriter)|Adam Horowitz]], and was directed by [[Mark Mylod]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20111003abc13/ |title=Once Upon a Time: \"Pilot\" |publisher=The Futon Critic |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=October 26, 2011}}</ref> Mylod, a veteran of the [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] drama ''[[Shameless (U.S. TV series)|Shameless]]'', signed on to direct in mid-February 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/02/three-more-broadcast-pilots-find-directors/ |title=Three More Broadcast Pilots Find Directors |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=February 14, 2011 |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref> The network picked up ''Once Upon a Time'' and six other drama series on May 13, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/05/abc-starts-new-series-pickups-with-orders-to-tim-allen-and-apt-23/ |title=3RD UPDATE: ABC Picks Up 7 New Dramas, 5 Comedies, 'Smothered' Still Alive |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=May 13, 2011 |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Writing===\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#ADD8E6|width=32em |align=right| quote  =The idea is to take these characters that we all know collectively and try to find things about them that we haven\u2019t explored before.

On the wedding day of Snow White and Prince Charming, the Evil Queen arrives and delivers an ominous threat about a powerful curse she intends to release upon them. Some time later, a pregnant Snow White is worried about the curse and visits [[Mr. Gold|Rumplestiltskin]] ([[Robert Carlyle]]) in prison, who issues a prophecy that the Queen's curse will take them all someplace terrible where there will be no happy endings. He also reveals that Snow White's unborn daughter, [[Emma Swan]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]), will return when she is 28 years old to rescue them, thus beginning a crucial battle with the Queen. Following the [[Blue Fairy]]'s ([[Keegan Connor Tracy]]) advice, [[Mister Geppetto|Geppetto]] ([[Tony Amendola]]) and [[Pinocchio]] ([[Jakob Davies]]) fashion a wardrobe from a magical tree which will allow one person to escape the Queen's curse. On the day Snow White gives birth to her daughter, the Queen's curse strikes. Prince Charming places their daughter in the magic wardrobe, but is mortally wounded battling the Queen's henchmen. The Queen stands triumphantly over Snow White and Prince Charming\u2019s body, as the Curse takes them \"somewhere horrible.\"\n\n===In Boston===\nIn Present-day [[Boston]], Emma Swan (Morrison) lives a lonely existence working as a [[bail bondsman]] and [[bounty hunter]]. On her 28th birthday, she is approached by a ten-year-old boy, Henry ([[Jared S. Gilmore]]), who identifies himself as her son, whom she had given up for adoption as a teenager. Not wanting a relationship with him, Emma agrees to drive him back to his home in Storybrooke, [[Maine]]. Along the way, Henry shows her a large book of fairy tales he has, correctly insisting that all of the stories in it are real.Henry also tries to convince Emma that she is the product of true love and she needs to break a curse the evil queen [[Lana Parrilla]] has casted over many fairy tale characters including her family.\n\n===In Storybrooke===\nWhen they arrive in Storybrooke, Henry informs her that everyone in town is in reality a fairy tale character, exiled by the curse and with no memory of their real identities. This includes his therapist Archie Hopper ([[Raphael Sbarge]]), who is really [[Jiminy Cricket]], and his teacher Mary Margaret Blanchard (Goodwin), who is really Snow White. Henry claims that time is frozen in Storybrooke and the people are unable to leave, but that the curse will be broken by Emma. A skeptical Emma returns Henry to his adopted mother, the town Mayor, Regina (Parrilla), who is really the Evil Queen. Emma attempts to leave but after having drunk apple cider given to her by the Mayor and nearly hitting a wolf she has a car accident where she is knocked out. While unconscious, she is arrested and taken to Storybrooke Jail for supposedly [[drunk driving]]. When Henry runs away again, Emma makes a deal with the Mayor and Sheriff Graham ([[Jamie Dornan]]): if they release her, she will find him. After exhausting all possibilities she speaks with Mary Margaret, who tells Emma to \"Check his castle.\" After finding Henry at a wooden jungle gym (which bears a resemblance to Prince Charming's castle), they talk and Emma decides to stay in Storybrooke temporarily, especially after Regina warns her to leave town. This leads Emma to be suspicious of the mayor's motives.\n\nShortly after her conversation with Emma, Mary Margaret volunteers at Storybrooke Hospital, placing flowers at the bedside of patients. She stops in the ICU where a [[John Doe]] (Dallas) (who is actually Prince Charming) is sleeping in a coma. Mary Margaret is unaware of who he is. Meanwhile, at the Mayor's home, Regina takes the book from Henry's room and goes downstairs to look at her mirror, with an expression that seems to acknowledge she is aware of her fairy tale existence.\n\nAs Emma arrives at Granny's Bed & Breakfast, she is given a key to her room by the elderly proprietor (Beverley Elliot), who is actually Little Red Riding Hood's grandmother from ''[[Little Red Riding Hood]]''. She comes downstairs after yelling at Ruby ([[Meghan Ory]]), her granddaughter, who is actually Little Red Riding Hood. followed by a man who came to collect money: Mr. Gold (Carlyle), who is actually Rumplestiltskin, who also helped build and owns the entire town. When Emma mentions her name, Mr. Gold pauses as if he knew something about her. Emma's decision to stay in Storybrooke causes the hands of the town clock, previously frozen at 8:15, to begin moving again, indicating that the Dark Curse is beginning to weaken, as Henry watches from his room, smiling.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Pre-production===\nOn February 1, 2011, ABC ordered six new pilots for their [[2011\u201312 United States network television schedule|2011\u20132012 television schedule]], which included ''Once Upon a Time''.<ref name=ignpilotorders>{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/114/1147128p1.html | title=Lost Writers' Once Upon a Time Among ABC Pilot Orders |first=Eric |last=Goldman |publisher=[[IGN]] |date= February 1, 2011 |accessdate=January 3, 2012}}</ref> The premiere episode was co-written by series co-creators [[Edward Kitsis]] and [[Adam Horowitz (screenwriter)|Adam Horowitz]], and was directed by [[Mark Mylod]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings/20111003abc13/ |title=Once Upon a Time: \"Pilot\" |publisher=The Futon Critic |date=October 3, 2011 |accessdate=October 26, 2011}}</ref> Mylod, a veteran of the [[Showtime (TV channel)|Showtime]] drama ''[[Shameless (U.S. TV series)|Shameless]]'', signed on to direct in mid-February 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/02/three-more-broadcast-pilots-find-directors/ |title=Three More Broadcast Pilots Find Directors |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=February 14, 2011 |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref> The network picked up ''Once Upon a Time'' and six other drama series on May 13, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2011/05/abc-starts-new-series-pickups-with-orders-to-tim-allen-and-apt-23/ |title=3RD UPDATE: ABC Picks Up 7 New Dramas, 5 Comedies, 'Smothered' Still Alive |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |website=Deadline Hollywood |date=May 13, 2011 |accessdate=January 4, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Writing===\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#ADD8E6|width=32em |align=right| quote  =The idea is to take these characters that we all know collectively and try to find things about them that we haven\u2019t explored before.

She gives a confident, grounded performance that helps keep the show from feeling too fantastical, and her rapport with Gilmore is a big plus too.\" He also notes the writers and producers have put together a great premise and expects they'll have more as the series progresses: \"Given the cast and the people involved behind the scenes... we're more optimistic than not that ''Once Upon a Time'' will find its way.
