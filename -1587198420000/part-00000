He prefers playing games and being mischievous, but can be rather hasty and uncoordinated. He would rather look cool than follow directions, but cares about Valentino above anything else. Additionally, he is really bad at spelling, prefers being dirty and is easily duped into committing certain acts.\n* Valentino \"Val\" (voiced by [[Rico Rodriguez (actor)|Rico Rodriguez]] [pilot]; Sean-Ryan Petersen [series]): Victor's older half-brother who is more cautious and likes taking in the smaller things in life. He has better coordination than Victor and is smarter, but still looks out for him and cares for his well-being. He is overweight, but seems pretty nimble at times, and is very knowledgeable about ancient Mexican culture and its history.\n* Chata (voiced by Carla Tassara [pilot]; Laura Patalano [series]): the boys' grandmother, with whom they stay in Monte Macabre for the summer. She appears to be blind, is stern, yet kind. The pilot depicts her as an undead spirit that can take on a human form, while the series only implies her supernatural connections.\n* Maria Teresa (voiced by Frankie Qui\u00f1ones): Charlene and Pineapple's mean-spirited grandmother and Chata's rival. She owns her own taco establishment.\n** Charlene (voiced by Cristina Milizia): A strange and macabre little girl who picks on/hangs out with Vic and Val. She has connections to the supernatural and likes using them on the brothers. She has a crush on Victor and takes every chance to be involved with whatever he is doing.\n** Pineapple (voiced by Diego Molano): A large, lumbering, monosyllabic boy who is Charlene's brother. He acts as a stooge for her and, despite his intimidating appearance, is shown to like dancing and be sympathetic.\n* Julio \"Don\" Jalape\u00f1o (voiced by Jason Hightower): The local [[mini-mart]] owner who gets caught up in Vic and Val's antics, and is well-versed in Mexican and Latin-American folklore and cryptids. He seems to be attracted to Grandma Chata and sweats a lot in her presence.\n* Xochi Jalape\u00f1o (voiced by [[Cristina Vee]]): Don Jalape\u00f1o's teenage daughter who tends to the supernatural plants in the back of the store.

He prefers playing games and being mischievous, but can be rather hasty and uncoordinated. He would rather look cool than follow directions, but cares about Valentino above anything else. Additionally, he is really bad at spelling, prefers being dirty and is easily duped into committing certain acts.\n* Valentino \"Val\" (voiced by [[Rico Rodriguez (actor)|Rico Rodriguez]] [pilot]; Sean-Ryan Petersen [series]): Victor's older half-brother who is more cautious and likes taking in the smaller things in life. He has better coordination than Victor and is smarter, but still looks out for him and cares for his well-being. He is overweight, but seems pretty nimble at times, and is very knowledgeable about ancient Mexican culture and its history.\n* Chata (voiced by Carla Tassara [pilot]; Laura Patalano [series]): the boys' grandmother, with whom they stay in Monte Macabre for the summer. She appears to be blind, is stern, yet kind. The pilot depicts her as an undead spirit that can take on a human form, while the series only implies her supernatural connections.\n* Maria Teresa (voiced by Frankie Qui\u00f1ones): Charlene and Pineapple's mean-spirited grandmother and Chata's rival. She owns her own taco establishment.\n** Charlene (voiced by Cristina Milizia): A strange and macabre little girl who picks on/hangs out with Vic and Val. She has connections to the supernatural and likes using them on the brothers. She has a crush on Victor and takes every chance to be involved with whatever he is doing.\n** Pineapple (voiced by Diego Molano): A large, lumbering, monosyllabic boy who is Charlene's brother. He acts as a stooge for her and, despite his intimidating appearance, is shown to like dancing and be sympathetic.\n* Julio \"Don\" Jalape\u00f1o (voiced by Jason Hightower): The local [[mini-mart]] owner who gets caught up in Vic and Val's antics, and is well-versed in Mexican and Latin-American folklore and cryptids. He seems to be attracted to Grandma Chata and sweats a lot in her presence.\n* Xochi Jalape\u00f1o (voiced by [[Cristina Vee]]): Don Jalape\u00f1o's teenage daughter who tends to the supernatural plants in the back of the store.
