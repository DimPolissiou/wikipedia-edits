As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of Opelika was 26,401,<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> and in 2018 the estimated population was 30,555.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> The [[Auburn, Alabama, metropolitan area|Auburn-Opelika, AL MSA]] with a population of 150,933, along with the [[Columbus, Georgia metropolitan area]], comprises the [[Columbus\u2013Auburn\u2013Opelika, GA\u2013AL CSA|Greater Columbus]] combined statistical area, a region home to 501,649 residents.\n\n[[File:Historic Downtown Marker.jpg|thumb|Opelika's historic downtown]]\n\n==History==\nThe first white settlers in the area now known as Opelika arrived in the late 1830s and established a community called Lebanon. After the removal of the native Creek (Muscogee) peoples by federal troops in 1836\u201337, the area became known as \"Opelika.\" This word taken from the [[Creek language|Muskogee]] language means \"large swamp\".\n\nIn 1848, the Montgomery and West Point Railroad Company extended a rail line from [[Montgomery, Alabama]], to Opelika, and in 1851, completed a connection to [[West Point, Georgia]], thus connecting Opelika with [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. This line was the only direct rail route between [[New Orleans]] and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]]. It rapidly became one of the primary trade lines for shipments of raw cotton from [[Southern United States|Southern]] plantations to the North. The Montgomery and West Point was soon joined by a rail connection to [[Columbus, Georgia]], in 1855, and a connection to [[Birmingham, Alabama]], in 1869. Almost overnight, Opelika became a regional hub for commerce.\n\nTo manage this rapid growth, Opelika was incorporated as a town on February 9, 1854, then within [[Russell County, Alabama|Russell County]]. As a result of Opelika's transportation infrastructure, many warehouses for storing cotton and other goods were built. With the onset of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], these warehouses were converted to [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] supply depots. In 1864 and 1865, Union raids commanded by [[Lovell Rousseau]] and [[James H. Wilson]] attacked Opelika, tearing up the railroads and destroying all government property, including Opelika's warehouses.\n\nSoon after the end of the war, the Alabama state legislature created a new county out of parts of [[Macon County, Alabama|Macon]], Russell, [[Chambers County, Alabama|Chambers]], and [[Tallapoosa County, Alabama|Tallapoosa]] Counties to be named after Confederate general [[Robert E. Lee]]. In 1866, citizens of the new \"[[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]]\" voted Opelika as the county seat. The town was technically unincorporated after having its charter revoked for abetting the rebellion against the United States.\n\nAfter Opelika received a new charter in 1870, rapid growth resumed. The town nearly doubled in size between 1870 and 1900. During this time, Opelika began to gain a reputation as a wild, lawless town.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Soon after receiving the new charter, city officials attempted to scam outside investors by issuing fake railroad bonds. For this, the town's charter was revoked again in 1872, and the town was administered as a police district by the state legislature for the following year. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\nOpelika's downtown was packed with [[bar (establishment)|saloons]] catering to railroad workers and other men. Frequent gunfire in the street by intoxicated patrons resulted in railroads directing their passengers to duck beneath the windows when their trains passed through the town.<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9806E0D6143DE533A25756C1A9649D94639FD7CF \"The Battle Of The Bar-rooms; Murderous Factions Fights In Alabama\u2014Death Of Maloney In Opelika\"], ''New York Times'', 15 December 1882, accessed 4 April 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1882, two factions claimed to rule the city government, one known as the \"Bar room\" headed by Mayor Dunbar, a saloon keeper, and another known as the \"Citizens\". In a riot in late November\u2013December of that year, a dozen men were wounded. In the end, a few were killed. The Citizens had claimed control of the city via the elections, but Dunbar refused to give up. After continued violence, the state legislature revoked the city's charter and the governor sent in the [[militia]] to restore order. The legislature appointed five commissioners to manage the city,<ref name=\"nyt\"/> a situation that continued until 1899. That year the legislature restored the city's charter.\n\n===1900 to present===\nIn 1900, local investors founded the Opelika Cotton Mill as the first textile plant in the city, employing 125. The city was located on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] of the Piedmont, where factories were established to take advantage of water power. Attempts to expand the textile industry in Opelika continued for the next three decades. In 1925, city officials used a $62,500 bribe to induce executives of the Pepperell Manufacturing Co. (now [[WestPoint Home]]) to construct a large mill just outside the city limits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} From 1930 to 1970, Opelika continued industrialization, becoming a regional economic powerhouse.\n\nIn the 1950s, Opelika attracted the nation's first and largest magnetic tape manufacturing plant. In 1963, tire manufacturer [[Uniroyal]] constructed a massive plant in Opelika. Around the same time, Diversified Products revolutionized the physical fitness equipment industry with products produced in their Opelika plant. By the early 1970s, Opelika's industries employed nearly 10,000 people.\n\nBetween the late 1970s and 2005, nonagricultural employment in the Auburn-Opelika, AL, MSA grew at a slow and steady pace. Of the goods-producing industries, the metropolitan area has experienced the most change in manufacturing, which peaked in employment in the late 1980s. As many jobs moved offshore, employment declined, but this trend appears to be changing, as the number of manufacturing jobs has risen steadily since 2002.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Opelika purchased and developed the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park to increase its base. The {{convert|2200|acre|km2|adj=mid}} park site was purchased with funds from two bond issues, commonly called the 1998A and 1998B issues, totaling $10,280,000. Additional expenditures involved in constructing the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park included $4.3 million transferred from the city's general fund to the Opelika Industrial Development Authority (OIDA) between 1997 and 2000, a $1.9 million federal industrial park access road grant, $2.5 million from Opelika Water Works Board and the City of Opelika to sewer and water the park, $12.1 million from the Alabama Department of Transportation to construct an interchange. Additional expenditures were made by Tallapoosa Electric Cooperative for an electrical substation and by the OIDA for building construction for park tenants. Final expenditures for the land and development of the park totaled about $32 million. Since 1999, two major distribution centers, four tier-one automotive suppliers, Pharmavite, the global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of dietary supplements, and most recently Golden State Foods, one of the biggest service providers to McDonald's restaurants, including liquid products, and its third largest beef supplier in the U.S., have located within the park. The site has also attracted serious interest from automakers [[Audi]], [[Nissan]], and [[Hyundai Motor Group|Hyundai]]. In the summer of 2003, the park was recognized as one of the \"South's Best Automotive Assembly Plant Sites\" by ''Southern Business and Development,'' an industry trade publication.\n\nOpelika has had a related boom in retail development. TigerTown, a {{convert|130|acre|km2|adj=mid}} mixed-use development, is east Alabama's largest retail center with more than {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of retail space. Located at the intersection of Interstate 85 and Highway 280 (exit 58) in Opelika and home to more than 70 businesses,  TigerTown's tenants include Home Depot, Target, Best Buy, Starbucks, Olive Garden, Kroger, PETCO, Office Depot, Dick's Sporting Goods, World Market, Hobby Lobby, Kohl's, Bed, Bath and Beyond, T.J. Maxx, Kroger, Old Navy, and more.\n\nOpelika's largest employer is the East Alabama Medical Center, which paid around $119 million in salaries and benefits to more than 2,700 employees in 2009.<ref>[https://www.eamc.org/includes/files/annualreport2009.pdf page 14]</ref>\n\nHistoric downtown Opelika has had an urban design revitalization in association with the national Main Street, Inc. program. With a compact historic district listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], downtown Opelika has attracted a variety of specialty shops, galleries, antique stores, and restaurants.\n\nWith industrial and retail growth has come an increase in population. From 2000 to 2010, Opelika grew from 23,638 to 26,617.<ref>Opelika population figures as recorded by the US Census Bureau (July 1 estimates base): 2000-23,638, 2001-23,636, 2002-23,579, 2003-23,597, 2004-23,483, 2005-23,804\n.</ref>\n\n[[File:Opelika City Hall Memorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial in front of Opelika City Hall]]\n\n==Law and government==\nOpelika is governed by a [[mayor-council government]], with a mayor and a five-member [[city council]].\n\nThe chief executive official of the city of Opelika is the mayor. The mayor is elected at-large for a four-year term. The mayor has complete executive power in the city, and can appoint and dismiss department heads at will. The current mayor of Opelika is Gary Fuller.\n\nThe Opelika city council is the legislative body of the city. It passes laws and ordinances, and creates citywide policy. The city council is made up of five members, chosen for four-year terms each from one of five districts. Current council members through 2020 are:\n* District 1 - Patricia Jones\n* District 2 - Tiffany Gibson-Pitts\n* District 3 - Dozier Smith T\n* District 4 - Eddie Smith\n* District 5 - David Canon\n\nRecently the city council designated Opelika as a [[City of Character]]. The City of Character program is made to recognize, emphasize and in some cases enforce good character throughout the community as well as mandate character training from [[CharacterFirst!]]. There are 49 character traits emphasized. These traits were designated by [[Bill Gothard]].<ref>[http://www.envisionopelika.org/?p=45 Envision Opelika \u00bb City of Character<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.charactercities.org/aboutus/charactercities/ Character Cities, Counties, and States - International Association of Character Cities<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118225650/http://www.charactercities.org/aboutus/charactercities/ |date=2008-01-18 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.characterfirst.com/aboutus/#qualities |title=About Us - Character First!<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231171401/http://www.characterfirst.com/aboutus/#qualities |archive-date=2007-12-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nOpelika is located in north-central [[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]], and is bordered by [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] to the west. Opelika lies in the southern reaches of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Plateau]], and straddles the divide between the [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] and the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] river watersheds.\n\nThe city is located along [[Interstate 85 in Alabama|Interstate 85]], which runs east of the city, with access from exits 58, 60, 62, 64, and 66.\nI-85 leads northeast 101&nbsp;mi (163&nbsp;km) to [[Atlanta]] and southwest 62&nbsp;mi (100&nbsp;km) to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 280|280]] and [[U.S. Route 431 in Alabama|431]] also run through the city as well, with US 280/431 leading southeast 27&nbsp;mi (43&nbsp;km) to [[Phenix City, Alabama|Phenix City]]. After splitting in the city, US 280 leads northwest 28&nbsp;mi (45&nbsp;km) to [[Dadeville, Alabama|Dadeville]], and US 431 leads north 23&nbsp;mi (37&nbsp;km) to [[LaFayette, Alabama|LaFayette]].\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|53.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|52.8|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.7|sqmi|km2}} (1.24%) is water.\n\n==Economy==\nOpelika is located between the Hyundai-Kia automobile manufacturing facilities with the [[Kia Motors]] manufacturing plant about {{convert|18|mi|km}} east on I-85 and the [[Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama|Hyundai Motors]] manufacturing plant about {{convert|67|mi|km}} west on I-85/I-65.\n\nOpelika's economy has shifted away from a traditional basis in [[textile manufacturing]]. Since 2004, the city has experienced revitalization in many segments of the economy, including commercial, residential and industrial activity. Since January 2005, the City of Opelika has announced new industry investments and existing industry expansions totaling 1.407 billion and 3717 additional jobs.<ref>http://www.opelikaeconomicdevelopment.org</ref>\nProjects include a {{convert|170000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} company named [[Daewon]]. Daewon's investment in Opelika totaled $52.5 million, but a $13 million expansion in 2012 brought their total investment in Opelika to $65.5 million. Along with the additional investment of $13 million, they added 32 more jobs, bringing their total number of jobs to 240. As of June 2019, Daewon has invested a total of $108.5 million and the total number of jobs created to 273.\n\n[[File:Northeast Opelika Industrial Park.jpg|thumb|Northeast Opelika Industrial Park]]\n\nAnother major employer is Baxter International Inc.'s plant in Opelika. Previously known as Gambro Renal Products, the Swedish-based manufacturer of dialyzers for kidney dialysis made the largest single initial investment in Lee County's history of $165.5 million in 2005. The company changed its name to Baxter after merging with Baxter International, Inc., an Illinois-based company that manufactures life-sustaining medical products including dialyzers, which act as filters for patients with end stage renal disease. In August 2014, Baxter announced plans for a $300 million expansion of its state-of-the-art facility in Opelika, that added {{convert|230000|sqft|m2}} and several production lines, and created an additional 200 jobs. As of June 2019, Baxter has a total capital investment of $465.5 million and total job creation is 360.\n\nMando America Corp. has also been very successful in Opelika and continues to grow and prosper. An expansion announcement in April 2012 of approximately $24 million brought Mando's total investment in Opelika to nearly $160 million. Along with the $24 million investment, Mando promised 30 more jobs, increasing the total number of employees to over 600 and making them one of the largest employers in Opelika. In June 2013, Mando announced an additional investment of $35 million for equipment and building improvements over the next three years with plans to hire an additional 67 employees to support the expansion. In 2019, Mando announced an additional $9.6 million expansion and 23 new jobs. This brought Mando's total investment in Opelika to over $218.6 million and their employment total to more than 700. Mando's Opelika operations continue to produce brake calipers and suspension modules to support its customer base located throughout the U.S.\n\nWith a capital investment of $76.5 million, Pharmavite, a global leader and manufacturer of Nature Made dietary supplements began production in January 2013 and created 280 new jobs to Opelika and the surrounding area. As of April 2014, Pharmavite's capital investment in Opelika totaled more than $89 million. In addition, Pharmavite has implemented a third expansion, with a capital investment of $21.6 million and 54 new jobs scheduled over the next three years. In March 2019, Pharmavite announced a $8.9 million expansion and 18 new employees bringing the company's total investment to Opelika's economy to $144 million and the total number of jobs created to a total of 412.\n\nOn April 19, 2012, a 67-acre site in the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park became a Certified Food Site through Primus Builders, Inc./Garner Economics, LLC. The food site designation experts presented the Opelika Industrial Development Authority with the certification, stating the site is an ideal location for food and beverage processing, cold storage or food distribution facilities. The certification is aimed to attract new food-based companies to the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park and ultimately create additional jobs for the City of Opelika.\n\nDuring the summer of 2015, Cumberland Plastic Solutions took possession of the former Benteler Automotive facility and invested over $2 million worth of building improvements and repairs to bring the facility up to par as a state-of- the-art injection molding manufacturing plant. Cumberland is a privately held custom injection molding company employing over 150 employees and supplies locale OEMs such as Briggs & Stratton and automotive manufacturers Mercedes, Nissan and BM with various plastic components. The total capital investment as of June 2019 is $23.1 million with 159 jobs created.\n\nOn February 17, 2015, Golden State Foods Corp, one of the largest diversified suppliers to the quick-service restaurant and retail industries, announced its decision to build a new state-of-the-art meat processing facility using the certified food site in the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park. Mayor Gary Fuller, Secretary of Commerce Greg Canfield, and Alabama Speaker of the House Mike Hubbard made the announcement, along with Golden State Foods Corp company officials by video conference. The capital investment in the facility is estimated to be between $40 and $45 million. Golden State Foods will create 173 new jobs in Opelika. Wayne Morgan, Corporate Vice President, President Meat Group Golden State Foods, said the company selected Opelika as the site for their new facility \"based on the strategic location along I-85, the available workforce and the atmosphere of industry and government cooperation.\" Golden State Foods was established in 1947 and currently serves more than 125,000 restaurants from its 45 locations on five continents. With about 5,000 associates worldwide, Golden State Foods' core businesses include processing and distribution of liquid products, meat products, produce, dairy, and other services, providing a variety of networked solutions for the total supply chain spectrum.<ref>http://www.opelikaeconomicdevelopment.org/Default.asp?ID=660&pg=News&action=view&aid=1469&title=GOLDEN+STATE+FOODS+CORP+LOCATING+IN+OPELIKA</ref> As of June 2019, Golden State Foods has a total capital investment of $77.7 million and has created 173 jobs.\n\nDinan Engineering, a company known for the high-performance aftermarket products it makes for cars, relocated to Opelika, Alabama in April 2018. This addition will bring 13+ jobs to Opelika.\n\nCar Tech, LLC established operations in Opelika, Alabama with a capital investment of $72 million and the agreement to create 200 jobs in Opelika for manufacturing automotive equipment.\n\nYongsan Automotive USA, Inc. established its first U.S. location in Opelika, Alabama with an investment of more than $5.5 million for manufacturing equipment and building improvements and the creation of 150 new jobs over a three-year period. The company leased an existing building on Jeter Avenue in the Fox Run Business Park in March 2019.\n\nIn June 2019, two industries announced expansions in Opelika. West Fraser, Inc., will be constructing a new planer mill, which will increase its manufacturing capabilities. West Fraser is one of the largest lumber manufacturers in the United States, with 45 facilities in Western Canada and the southern U.S. They offer sustainable forestry, high-efficiency wood products. The company plans to invest an additional $43 million. The total investment of West Fraser since 2005 in Opelika's economy as of the June 2019 expansion is $148.3 million. Hanwha will invest an additional $32 million in capital and create 128 new jobs within the next three years. Hanwha has four production bases in the U.S. and manufactures high-quality lightweight composite materials and auto parts. Hanwha, formerly Maxforma Plastics has provided a total capital investment of $122.3 million and has created 518 jobs since 2005.\n\nThe TigerTown retail shopping complex continues to expand its commercial developments with restaurants such as [[Chick-Fil-A]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Olive Garden]].\nTigerTown's most recent additions include PetSmart, Men's Warehouse, Shoe Station, [[Newk's Eatery]], Full Moon Bar-B-Q, and Cook Out. A new development adjacent to Tiger Town has recently been constructed and offers retail and restaurant favorites such as Tazikis, Chipotle and BurgerFi.\n\nOpelika is also  home to AMC Cinema's Tiger 13, a 55,000-square-foot, 13-screen movie theater. The theater includes the \"Big D Digital Experience\", a theater featuring an 80-foot screen with approximately 580 seats.\n\nOpelika has received several honors for its success in attracting new business. In 2004, the city of Opelika's Economic Development Department was named one of the top 10 economic development groups in North America by ''Site Selection'' magazine, a national industry trade publication covering corporate real estate management and economic development. ''Site Selection'' again recognized the efforts of the Opelika Economic Development Department in its Top Groups 2005 list in the Honorable Mention category.\n\nIn early 2006, the Economic Development Association of Alabama named Opelika the top community in Alabama for business recruitment for the year 2005.

The course, which is considered to be the jewel of Alabama's [[Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail]], has hosted a number of national tournaments, including the 1997 Nike Tour championship, the 1998 LPGA Tournament of Champions, and the 2000 NCAA Men's Division 1 National Championship. \nRobert Trent Jones Grand National also served as the tournament host for the first PGA Tour tournament in Alabama since 1990, the [[Barbasol Championship]], held the same week as [[The Open Championship]].<ref>http://www.pgatour.com/company/2014/08/11/barbasol-championship-pga-tour-2015.html</ref> Another reason that the Auburn-Opelika MSA was named the #1 area for golf in the United States was for the local public golf courses like Indian Pines Golf Course in Opelika.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the population of Opelika was 26,401,<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/> and in 2018 the estimated population was 30,555.<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/> The [[Auburn, Alabama, metropolitan area|Auburn-Opelika, AL MSA]] with a population of 150,933, along with the [[Columbus, Georgia metropolitan area]], comprises the [[Columbus\u2013Auburn\u2013Opelika, GA\u2013AL CSA|Greater Columbus]] combined statistical area, a region home to 501,649 residents.\n\n[[File:Historic Downtown Marker.jpg|thumb|Opelika's historic downtown]]\n\n==History==\nThe first white settlers in the area now known as Opelika arrived in the late 1830s and established a community called Lebanon. After the removal of the native Creek (Muscogee) peoples by federal troops in 1836\u201337, the area became known as \"Opelika.\" This word taken from the [[Creek language|Muskogee]] language means \"large swamp\".\n\nIn 1848, the Montgomery and West Point Railroad Company extended a rail line from [[Montgomery, Alabama]], to Opelika, and in 1851, completed a connection to [[West Point, Georgia]], thus connecting Opelika with [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. This line was the only direct rail route between [[New Orleans]] and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]]. It rapidly became one of the primary trade lines for shipments of raw cotton from [[Southern United States|Southern]] plantations to the North. The Montgomery and West Point was soon joined by a rail connection to [[Columbus, Georgia]], in 1855, and a connection to [[Birmingham, Alabama]], in 1869. Almost overnight, Opelika became a regional hub for commerce.\n\nTo manage this rapid growth, Opelika was incorporated as a town on February 9, 1854, then within [[Russell County, Alabama|Russell County]]. As a result of Opelika's transportation infrastructure, many warehouses for storing cotton and other goods were built. With the onset of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], these warehouses were converted to [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] supply depots. In 1864 and 1865, Union raids commanded by [[Lovell Rousseau]] and [[James H. Wilson]] attacked Opelika, tearing up the railroads and destroying all government property, including Opelika's warehouses.\n\nSoon after the end of the war, the Alabama state legislature created a new county out of parts of [[Macon County, Alabama|Macon]], Russell, [[Chambers County, Alabama|Chambers]], and [[Tallapoosa County, Alabama|Tallapoosa]] Counties to be named after Confederate general [[Robert E. Lee]]. In 1866, citizens of the new \"[[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]]\" voted Opelika as the county seat. The town was technically unincorporated after having its charter revoked for abetting the rebellion against the United States.\n\nAfter Opelika received a new charter in 1870, rapid growth resumed. The town nearly doubled in size between 1870 and 1900. During this time, Opelika began to gain a reputation as a wild, lawless town.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} Soon after receiving the new charter, city officials attempted to scam outside investors by issuing fake railroad bonds. For this, the town's charter was revoked again in 1872, and the town was administered as a police district by the state legislature for the following year. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}.\n\nOpelika's downtown was packed with [[bar (establishment)|saloons]] catering to railroad workers and other men. Frequent gunfire in the street by intoxicated patrons resulted in railroads directing their passengers to duck beneath the windows when their trains passed through the town.<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9806E0D6143DE533A25756C1A9649D94639FD7CF \"The Battle Of The Bar-rooms; Murderous Factions Fights In Alabama\u2014Death Of Maloney In Opelika\"], ''New York Times'', 15 December 1882, accessed 4 April 2016.</ref>\n\nIn 1882, two factions claimed to rule the city government, one known as the \"Bar room\" headed by Mayor Dunbar, a saloon keeper, and another known as the \"Citizens\". In a riot in late November\u2013December of that year, a dozen men were wounded. In the end, a few were killed. The Citizens had claimed control of the city via the elections, but Dunbar refused to give up. After continued violence, the state legislature revoked the city's charter and the governor sent in the [[militia]] to restore order. The legislature appointed five commissioners to manage the city,<ref name=\"nyt\"/> a situation that continued until 1899. That year the legislature restored the city's charter.\n\n===1900 to present===\nIn 1900, local investors founded the Opelika Cotton Mill as the first textile plant in the city, employing 125. The city was located on the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|Fall Line]] of the Piedmont, where factories were established to take advantage of water power. Attempts to expand the textile industry in Opelika continued for the next three decades. In 1925, city officials used a $62,500 bribe to induce executives of the Pepperell Manufacturing Co. (now [[WestPoint Home]]) to construct a large mill just outside the city limits.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} From 1930 to 1970, Opelika continued industrialization, becoming a regional economic powerhouse.\n\nIn the 1950s, Opelika attracted the nation's first and largest magnetic tape manufacturing plant. In 1963, tire manufacturer [[Uniroyal]] constructed a massive plant in Opelika. Around the same time, Diversified Products revolutionized the physical fitness equipment industry with products produced in their Opelika plant. By the early 1970s, Opelika's industries employed nearly 10,000 people.\n\nBetween the late 1970s and 2005, nonagricultural employment in the Auburn-Opelika, AL, MSA grew at a slow and steady pace. Of the goods-producing industries, the metropolitan area has experienced the most change in manufacturing, which peaked in employment in the late 1980s. As many jobs moved offshore, employment declined, but this trend appears to be changing, as the number of manufacturing jobs has risen steadily since 2002.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Opelika purchased and developed the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park to increase its base. The {{convert|2200|acre|km2|adj=mid}} park site was purchased with funds from two bond issues, commonly called the 1998A and 1998B issues, totaling $10,280,000. Additional expenditures involved in constructing the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park included $4.3 million transferred from the city's general fund to the Opelika Industrial Development Authority (OIDA) between 1997 and 2000, a $1.9 million federal industrial park access road grant, $2.5 million from Opelika Water Works Board and the City of Opelika to sewer and water the park, $12.1 million from the Alabama Department of Transportation to construct an interchange. Additional expenditures were made by Tallapoosa Electric Cooperative for an electrical substation and by the OIDA for building construction for park tenants. Final expenditures for the land and development of the park totaled about $32 million. Since 1999, two major distribution centers, four tier-one automotive suppliers, Pharmavite, the global leader in the manufacturing and distribution of dietary supplements, and most recently Golden State Foods, one of the biggest service providers to McDonald's restaurants, including liquid products, and its third largest beef supplier in the U.S., have located within the park. The site has also attracted serious interest from automakers [[Audi]], [[Nissan]], and [[Hyundai Motor Group|Hyundai]]. In the summer of 2003, the park was recognized as one of the \"South's Best Automotive Assembly Plant Sites\" by ''Southern Business and Development,'' an industry trade publication.\n\nOpelika has had a related boom in retail development. TigerTown, a {{convert|130|acre|km2|adj=mid}} mixed-use development, is east Alabama's largest retail center with more than {{convert|1000000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of retail space. Located at the intersection of Interstate 85 and Highway 280 (exit 58) in Opelika and home to more than 70 businesses,  TigerTown's tenants include Home Depot, Target, Best Buy, Starbucks, Olive Garden, Kroger, PETCO, Office Depot, Dick's Sporting Goods, World Market, Hobby Lobby, Kohl's, Bed, Bath and Beyond, T.J. Maxx, Kroger, Old Navy, and more.\n\nOpelika's largest employer is the East Alabama Medical Center, which paid around $119 million in salaries and benefits to more than 2,700 employees in 2009.<ref>[https://www.eamc.org/includes/files/annualreport2009.pdf page 14]</ref>\n\nHistoric downtown Opelika has had an urban design revitalization in association with the national Main Street, Inc. program. With a compact historic district listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], downtown Opelika has attracted a variety of specialty shops, galleries, antique stores, and restaurants.\n\nWith industrial and retail growth has come an increase in population. From 2000 to 2010, Opelika grew from 23,638 to 26,617.<ref>Opelika population figures as recorded by the US Census Bureau (July 1 estimates base): 2000-23,638, 2001-23,636, 2002-23,579, 2003-23,597, 2004-23,483, 2005-23,804\n.</ref>\n\n[[File:Opelika City Hall Memorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial in front of Opelika City Hall]]\n\n==Law and government==\nOpelika is governed by a [[mayor-council government]], with a mayor and a five-member [[city council]].\n\nThe chief executive official of the city of Opelika is the mayor. The mayor is elected at-large for a four-year term. The mayor has complete executive power in the city, and can appoint and dismiss department heads at will. The current mayor of Opelika is Gary Fuller.\n\nThe Opelika city council is the legislative body of the city. It passes laws and ordinances, and creates citywide policy. The city council is made up of five members, chosen for four-year terms each from one of five districts. Current council members through 2020 are:\n* District 1 - Patricia Jones\n* District 2 - Tiffany Gibson-Pitts\n* District 3 - Dozier Smith T\n* District 4 - Eddie Smith\n* District 5 - David Canon\n\nRecently the city council designated Opelika as a [[City of Character]]. The City of Character program is made to recognize, emphasize and in some cases enforce good character throughout the community as well as mandate character training from [[CharacterFirst!]]. There are 49 character traits emphasized. These traits were designated by [[Bill Gothard]].<ref>[http://www.envisionopelika.org/?p=45 Envision Opelika \u00bb City of Character<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.charactercities.org/aboutus/charactercities/ Character Cities, Counties, and States - International Association of Character Cities<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118225650/http://www.charactercities.org/aboutus/charactercities/ |date=2008-01-18 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.characterfirst.com/aboutus/#qualities |title=About Us - Character First!<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2008-01-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071231171401/http://www.characterfirst.com/aboutus/#qualities |archive-date=2007-12-31 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nOpelika is located in north-central [[Lee County, Alabama|Lee County]], and is bordered by [[Auburn, Alabama|Auburn]] to the west. Opelika lies in the southern reaches of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont Plateau]], and straddles the divide between the [[Tallapoosa River|Tallapoosa]] and the [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] river watersheds.\n\nThe city is located along [[Interstate 85 in Alabama|Interstate 85]], which runs east of the city, with access from exits 58, 60, 62, 64, and 66.\nI-85 leads northeast 101&nbsp;mi (163&nbsp;km) to [[Atlanta]] and southwest 62&nbsp;mi (100&nbsp;km) to [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]]. U.S. Routes [[U.S. Route 280|280]] and [[U.S. Route 431 in Alabama|431]] also run through the city as well, with US 280/431 leading southeast 27&nbsp;mi (43&nbsp;km) to [[Phenix City, Alabama|Phenix City]]. After splitting in the city, US 280 leads northwest 28&nbsp;mi (45&nbsp;km) to [[Dadeville, Alabama|Dadeville]], and US 431 leads north 23&nbsp;mi (37&nbsp;km) to [[LaFayette, Alabama|LaFayette]].\n\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|53.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|52.8|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.7|sqmi|km2}} (1.24%) is water.\n\n==Economy==\nOpelika is located between the Hyundai-Kia automobile manufacturing facilities with the [[Kia Motors]] manufacturing plant about {{convert|18|mi|km}} east on I-85 and the [[Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama|Hyundai Motors]] manufacturing plant about {{convert|67|mi|km}} west on I-85/I-65.\n\nOpelika's economy has shifted away from a traditional basis in [[textile manufacturing]]. Since 2004, the city has experienced revitalization in many segments of the economy, including commercial, residential and industrial activity. Since January 2005, the City of Opelika has announced new industry investments and existing industry expansions totaling 1.407 billion and 3717 additional jobs.<ref>http://www.opelikaeconomicdevelopment.org</ref>\nProjects include a {{convert|170000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} company named [[Daewon]]. Daewon's investment in Opelika totaled $52.5 million, but a $13 million expansion in 2012 brought their total investment in Opelika to $65.5 million. Along with the additional investment of $13 million, they added 32 more jobs, bringing their total number of jobs to 240. As of June 2019, Daewon has invested a total of $108.5 million and the total number of jobs created to 273.\n\n[[File:Northeast Opelika Industrial Park.jpg|thumb|Northeast Opelika Industrial Park]]\n\nAnother major employer is Baxter International Inc.'s plant in Opelika. Previously known as Gambro Renal Products, the Swedish-based manufacturer of dialyzers for kidney dialysis made the largest single initial investment in Lee County's history of $165.5 million in 2005. The company changed its name to Baxter after merging with Baxter International, Inc., an Illinois-based company that manufactures life-sustaining medical products including dialyzers, which act as filters for patients with end stage renal disease. In August 2014, Baxter announced plans for a $300 million expansion of its state-of-the-art facility in Opelika, that added {{convert|230000|sqft|m2}} and several production lines, and created an additional 200 jobs. As of June 2019, Baxter has a total capital investment of $465.5 million and total job creation is 360.\n\nMando America Corp. has also been very successful in Opelika and continues to grow and prosper. An expansion announcement in April 2012 of approximately $24 million brought Mando's total investment in Opelika to nearly $160 million. Along with the $24 million investment, Mando promised 30 more jobs, increasing the total number of employees to over 600 and making them one of the largest employers in Opelika. In June 2013, Mando announced an additional investment of $35 million for equipment and building improvements over the next three years with plans to hire an additional 67 employees to support the expansion. In 2019, Mando announced an additional $9.6 million expansion and 23 new jobs. This brought Mando's total investment in Opelika to over $218.6 million and their employment total to more than 700. Mando's Opelika operations continue to produce brake calipers and suspension modules to support its customer base located throughout the U.S.\n\nWith a capital investment of $76.5 million, Pharmavite, a global leader and manufacturer of Nature Made dietary supplements began production in January 2013 and created 280 new jobs to Opelika and the surrounding area. As of April 2014, Pharmavite's capital investment in Opelika totaled more than $89 million. In addition, Pharmavite has implemented a third expansion, with a capital investment of $21.6 million and 54 new jobs scheduled over the next three years. In March 2019, Pharmavite announced a $8.9 million expansion and 18 new employees bringing the company's total investment to Opelika's economy to $144 million and the total number of jobs created to a total of 412.\n\nOn April 19, 2012, a 67-acre site in the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park became a Certified Food Site through Primus Builders, Inc./Garner Economics, LLC. The food site designation experts presented the Opelika Industrial Development Authority with the certification, stating the site is an ideal location for food and beverage processing, cold storage or food distribution facilities. The certification is aimed to attract new food-based companies to the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park and ultimately create additional jobs for the City of Opelika.\n\nDuring the summer of 2015, Cumberland Plastic Solutions took possession of the former Benteler Automotive facility and invested over $2 million worth of building improvements and repairs to bring the facility up to par as a state-of- the-art injection molding manufacturing plant. Cumberland is a privately held custom injection molding company employing over 150 employees and supplies locale OEMs such as Briggs & Stratton and automotive manufacturers Mercedes, Nissan and BM with various plastic components. The total capital investment as of June 2019 is $23.1 million with 159 jobs created.\n\nOn February 17, 2015, Golden State Foods Corp, one of the largest diversified suppliers to the quick-service restaurant and retail industries, announced its decision to build a new state-of-the-art meat processing facility using the certified food site in the Northeast Opelika Industrial Park. Mayor Gary Fuller, Secretary of Commerce Greg Canfield, and Alabama Speaker of the House Mike Hubbard made the announcement, along with Golden State Foods Corp company officials by video conference. The capital investment in the facility is estimated to be between $40 and $45 million. Golden State Foods will create 173 new jobs in Opelika. Wayne Morgan, Corporate Vice President, President Meat Group Golden State Foods, said the company selected Opelika as the site for their new facility \"based on the strategic location along I-85, the available workforce and the atmosphere of industry and government cooperation.\" Golden State Foods was established in 1947 and currently serves more than 125,000 restaurants from its 45 locations on five continents. With about 5,000 associates worldwide, Golden State Foods' core businesses include processing and distribution of liquid products, meat products, produce, dairy, and other services, providing a variety of networked solutions for the total supply chain spectrum.<ref>http://www.opelikaeconomicdevelopment.org/Default.asp?ID=660&pg=News&action=view&aid=1469&title=GOLDEN+STATE+FOODS+CORP+LOCATING+IN+OPELIKA</ref> As of June 2019, Golden State Foods has a total capital investment of $77.7 million and has created 173 jobs.\n\nDinan Engineering, a company known for the high-performance aftermarket products it makes for cars, relocated to Opelika, Alabama in April 2018. This addition will bring 13+ jobs to Opelika.\n\nCar Tech, LLC established operations in Opelika, Alabama with a capital investment of $72 million and the agreement to create 200 jobs in Opelika for manufacturing automotive equipment.\n\nYongsan Automotive USA, Inc. established its first U.S. location in Opelika, Alabama with an investment of more than $5.5 million for manufacturing equipment and building improvements and the creation of 150 new jobs over a three-year period. The company leased an existing building on Jeter Avenue in the Fox Run Business Park in March 2019.\n\nIn June 2019, two industries announced expansions in Opelika. West Fraser, Inc., will be constructing a new planer mill, which will increase its manufacturing capabilities. West Fraser is one of the largest lumber manufacturers in the United States, with 45 facilities in Western Canada and the southern U.S. They offer sustainable forestry, high-efficiency wood products. The company plans to invest an additional $43 million. The total investment of West Fraser since 2005 in Opelika's economy as of the June 2019 expansion is $148.3 million. Hanwha will invest an additional $32 million in capital and create 128 new jobs within the next three years. Hanwha has four production bases in the U.S. and manufactures high-quality lightweight composite materials and auto parts. Hanwha, formerly Maxforma Plastics has provided a total capital investment of $122.3 million and has created 518 jobs since 2005.\n\nThe TigerTown retail shopping complex continues to expand its commercial developments with restaurants such as [[Chick-Fil-A]], [[McDonald's]], and [[Olive Garden]].\nTigerTown's most recent additions include PetSmart, Men's Warehouse, Shoe Station, [[Newk's Eatery]], Full Moon Bar-B-Q, and Cook Out. A new development adjacent to Tiger Town has recently been constructed and offers retail and restaurant favorites such as Tazikis, Chipotle and BurgerFi.\n\nOpelika is also  home to AMC Cinema's Tiger 13, a 55,000-square-foot, 13-screen movie theater. The theater includes the \"Big D Digital Experience\", a theater featuring an 80-foot screen with approximately 580 seats.\n\nOpelika has received several honors for its success in attracting new business. In 2004, the city of Opelika's Economic Development Department was named one of the top 10 economic development groups in North America by ''Site Selection'' magazine, a national industry trade publication covering corporate real estate management and economic development.

In its first year of program participation, Opelika High School had 63 more course enrollments in rigorous AP classes than in the year prior and students earned qualifying scores on 45 AP exams. Driving the increases in student achievement is the implementation of the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE)/A+ College Ready AP Program, which OHS began implementing in 2014. The goals of the program are to boost student enrollment and achievement, particularly for under-represented student groups in rigorous AP courses and to build a pipeline of students better prepared for college and careers.<ref>http://www.opelikaeconomicdevelopment.org/Default.asp?ID=660&pg=News&action=view&aid=1545&title=Opelika+High+School+among+Alabama+Schools+Lauded+as+National+Champions+in+Advanced+Placement</ref>\n\nIn May 2012, renovations and new construction began on Opelika High School.

One part of the reason this area received this ranking is that Opelika is home to Robert Trent Jones Grand National. The site for the course, which hugs the edge of Lake Saugahatchee in Opelika's northwest, was described by Jones as the \"single greatest\" site for a golf complex that he had ever seen. The course, which is considered to be the jewel of Alabama's [[Robert Trent Jones Golf Trail]], has hosted a number of national tournaments, including the 1997 Nike Tour championship, the 1998 LPGA Tournament of Champions, and the 2000 NCAA Men's Division 1 National Championship. \nRobert Trent Jones Grand National also served as the tournament host for the first PGA Tour tournament in Alabama since 1990, the [[Barbasol Championship]], held the same week as [[The Open Championship]].<ref>http://www.pgatour.com/company/2014/08/11/barbasol-championship-pga-tour-2015.html</ref> Another reason that the Auburn-Opelika MSA was named the #1 area for golf in the United States was for the local public golf courses like Indian Pines Golf Course in Opelika. Indian Pines Golf Course is an 18-hole public golf course that has a par 71 course with summer Bermuda grass and a bentgrass/ryegrass mix in the winter.\n\nThe Alabama Recreation and Parks Association awarded the Opelika Sportsplex and Aquatics Center the 2010 Facility of the Year Award for cities with populations of 15,001 people or more.\n\nThe City of Opelika was honored by the Alabama League of Municipalities at the Statewide conference in May, 2010.

In their remarks, league leaders noted \"Your exemplary program demonstrates a strong commitment to improving the quality of life in the City of Opelika...your program exhibits the type of innovation that the National League of Cities is looking to recognize.\"\nThis $32 million, {{convert|75,000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} complex is the largest project ever undertaken by the City of Opelika in its 155-year history,  representing the first-ever public-private partnership, with businesses, corporations and private individuals.\nThe idea began with a survey that was conducted in the early 2000s (decade) that concluded that the citizens of Opelika wanted a \"family oriented\" facility that would offer a wide variety of activities where everyone could have fun together. The city's governing body set out to make the dream a reality, and soon resolutions were passed by the city council authorizing the city to move forward with the plans.\nOn February 21, 2008, after years of preparation and fundraising, groundbreaking ceremonies were held.  On August 31, 2009 \u2013 on schedule and on budget \u2013 Opelika's new state-of-the-art Sportsplex & Aquatics Center opened its doors to the public.\n\nThe Lewis Cooper Jr. Memorial Library in Opelika received the 2019 Gold Standard Award for Public Libraries.

The dog park includes double entry fencing, signage, seating, pet waste systems and ADA compliance access to parking area. In addition, the Stern Foundation donated a second dog and walking park to the City in 2018.  The City moved the Caboose to Stern Park so that children of all ages could enjoy.\n\nThe Opelika SportsPlex and Aquatics Center houses five full regulation soccer fields, including one championship field with two concession stands and two sets of bathrooms. The SportsPlex soccer fields are home to the Opelika Parks and Recreation Spring and Fall Soccer programs, Opelika Crush Soccer Team and the Opelika City Schools soccer teams.\n \nIn 2019, 12 new regulation pickleball courts were built at the Opelika SportsPlex and Aquatics Center.

It first became associated with the inventor and engineer [[James Watt]] in 1824, as a means of raising funds to secure permanent accommodation. Justifying the association, School Director [[Lord Cockburn]] said:\n\n<blockquote>\"[The building] shall be employed for the accommodation of the Edinburgh School of Arts; whereby the memory of Watt may forever be connected with the promotion, among a class of men to which he himself originally belonged, of those mechanical arts from which his own usefulness and glory arose.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|103}} \"</blockquote>\n\nIn 1837, the School of Arts moved to leased accommodation on Adam Square, which it was able to purchase in 1851 thanks to funds raised in Watt's name. In honour of the purchase, the School changed its name to the Watt Institution and School of Arts in 1852.\n\n===Watt Institution and School of Arts===\n\nHeriot-Watt's time as the Watt Institution marked a transitional period for the organisation, as its curriculum broadened to include several subjects beyond mathematics and the physical sciences. While the School of Arts had catered almost exclusively to working-class artisans and technical workers, the Watt Institution admitted a large number of middle-class students, whom it attracted with new subjects in the sciences, social sciences and humanities. By 1885, the skilled working class were no longer the majority in an institution that had been created explicitly for them.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|133\u2013135}}\n\nA shifting class make-up was not the only demographic change to affect the student body, as in 1869 women were permitted to attend lectures for the first time. This move put the Watt Institution some way ahead of Scottish universities, who were only permitted to allow women to graduate 20 years later following the Universities (Scotland) Act of 1889.<ref name=\"Constitutional & Administrative Law (8th Edition)\">Barnett, H. (2011). Constitutional & Administrative Law (8th Edition). Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0415578813}}</ref>{{rp|163}} The decision to admit women was made in large part owing to pressure from local campaigner Mary Burton, who later became the Institution's first female director in 1874.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|133\u2013135}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst3796.html|title=Gazetteer for Scotland: Mary Burton.|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1870, the Watt Institution was forced to move following the demolition of Adam Square.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|148\u2013153}} After a brief period on Roxburgh Place, it relocated to the newly constructed [[Chambers Street (Edinburgh)|Chambers Street]] near where its former site had stood. The move caused the Institution severe financial difficulties, which were compounded by a combination of declining funds from subscribers and increased costs from its growing student body. In 1873, the Directors turned to [[George Heriot]]'s Trust for support, and agreed to a merger of the Trust's endowment with the Institution's own. The proposed merger was provisional to changes in the structure of the Watt Institution, which would see the organisation become a technical college with representatives of the Trust in management positions. Accepting these changes, the Watt Institution officially became '''Heriot-Watt College''' in 1885, and was subsequently on far firmer financial ground.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|160\u2013161}}\n\n====The Watt Club====\n\n{{See also|The Watt Club}}\n\nThe Watt Club was founded at the Watt Institution on 12 May 1854, and is today the oldest alumni organisation in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alumni.hw.ac.uk/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=449|title=Heriot-Watt University: A Short History of the Watt Club.|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref>  Following the unveiling of a statue of James Watt outside the Institution, local jeweller J.E Vernon proposed that\n\n<blockquote>\"[a club should be formed] whose object would be to sup together on the anniversary of the birth of James Watt\u2026and also to promote the interests of the School, by raising a fund each year to provide prizes.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|144\u2013145}}\"</blockquote>\n\nWatt Club Medals are still awarded by the organisation each year to Heriot-Watt's most highly achieving students, while the Watt Club Prize is awarded by The Watt Club Council to recognise student initiative and enterprise.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.hw.ac.uk/students/studies/student-record.htm|title=Heriot-Watt Academic Registry: Prizes and Awards.|accessdate=19 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Heriot-Watt College===\n\n[[File:Chambers Street, Edinburgh - geograph.org.uk - 1419940.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The former site of the Watt School|The former site of Heriot-Watt College on [[Chambers Street (Edinburgh)|Chambers Street]], today occupied by the Edinburgh [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service|Crown Office]].]]\n\nAfter the establishment of Heriot-Watt as a technical college, the new management committee set about extending the institution's buildings and strengthening its academic reputation.<ref name=\"nahste two\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nahste.ac.uk/cgi-bin/view_isad.pl?id=GB-0582-HWC&view=basic|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020906072325/http://www.nahste.ac.uk/cgi-bin/view_isad.pl?id=GB-0582-HWC&view=basic|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 September 2002|publisher=NAHSTE|title=Records of Heriot-Watt College|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref> In its new form the College was one of only three non-university institutions in the UK with the power to appoint professors, and the first of these was appointed in 1887. In 1902 the College became a [[central institution]], while in 1904 it introduced awards for graduating students which were similar to university degrees.<ref name=\"nahste two\" />\n\nExpansion meant that the College made increasing demands on George Heriot's Trust throughout the first part of the 20th century, which ultimately led to the independence of the two bodies in 1927. While the Trust continued to pay Heriot-Watt a fixed sum each year, from then on the College was responsible for managing its own financial affairs.<ref name=\"nahste two\" />  Heriot-Watt continued to expand after becoming independent, opening a new extension in 1935.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|243}}\n\nBoth World Wars impacted on the speed of the College's expansion. During [[World War I]], student numbers dropped as young men joined the army, while teaching in engineering stalled as the department was used for the manufacture of shells and munitions.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|213\u2013215}} During [[World War II]], student numbers dropped again and the electrical engineering department became involved in training the armed services in the use of [[radar]].\n\nAfter the College introduced a postgraduate award in 1951, it offered awards equivalent to university degrees and doctorates in all practical respects.  Recognising this, in 1963 the [[Robbins Report]] recommended that it should be awarded university status. On 1 February 1966 the recommendation was enacted, as the institution officially became '''Heriot-Watt University'''.<ref name=\"nahste two\" />\n\n===Heriot-Watt University===\n[[File:Heriot-Watt Reception.jpg|thumb]]\nThe first personal chair was appointed in 1974.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=huc9AAAAIBAJ&sjid=k0gMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1874%2C5720115 |title=Heriot Watt's new professor |work=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |date=29 June 1974 |page=11 |accessdate=8 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhile Heriot-Watt continued to expand in the centre of Edinburgh after attaining university status, the institution had grown big enough that relocation was felt to be desirable.<ref name=\"nahste two\" /> In 1966 Midlothian County Council gifted the Riccarton estate north of [[Currie]] to the University and in 1969 work began on transforming the site into a future campus.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|252}} The process of relocation to Riccarton continued until 1992, with teaching and facilities divided between the new campus and the city centre until this time.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|379\u2013381}}\n\nThe University has continued to grow after completing its move to Riccarton, constructing additional student halls, a sports centre and a postgraduate centre on the site.

It was established in 1821 as the [[Edinburgh College of Art|School of Arts of Edinburgh]], world's first [[mechanics' institute]] and subsequently was granted university status by [[royal charter]] granted in 1966. It is the eighth oldest higher education institute in UK.

It first became associated with the inventor and engineer [[James Watt]] in 1824, as a means of raising funds to secure permanent accommodation. Justifying the association, School Director [[Lord Cockburn]] said:\n\n<blockquote>\"[The building] shall be employed for the accommodation of the Edinburgh School of Arts; whereby the memory of Watt may forever be connected with the promotion, among a class of men to which he himself originally belonged, of those mechanical arts from which his own usefulness and glory arose.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|103}} \"</blockquote>\n\nIn 1837, the School of Arts moved to leased accommodation on Adam Square, which it was able to purchase in 1851 thanks to funds raised in Watt's name. In honour of the purchase, the School changed its name to the Watt Institution and School of Arts in 1852.\n\n===Watt Institution and School of Arts===\n\nHeriot-Watt's time as the Watt Institution marked a transitional period for the organisation, as its curriculum broadened to include several subjects beyond mathematics and the physical sciences. While the School of Arts had catered almost exclusively to working-class artisans and technical workers, the Watt Institution admitted a large number of middle-class students, whom it attracted with new subjects in the sciences, social sciences and humanities. By 1885, the skilled working class were no longer the majority in an institution that had been created explicitly for them.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|133\u2013135}}\n\nA shifting class make-up was not the only demographic change to affect the student body, as in 1869 women were permitted to attend lectures for the first time. This move put the Watt Institution some way ahead of Scottish universities, who were only permitted to allow women to graduate 20 years later following the Universities (Scotland) Act of 1889.<ref name=\"Constitutional & Administrative Law (8th Edition)\">Barnett, H. (2011). Constitutional & Administrative Law (8th Edition). Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0415578813}}</ref>{{rp|163}} The decision to admit women was made in large part owing to pressure from local campaigner Mary Burton, who later became the Institution's first female director in 1874.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|133\u2013135}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish-places.info/people/famousfirst3796.html|title=Gazetteer for Scotland: Mary Burton.|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1870, the Watt Institution was forced to move following the demolition of Adam Square.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|148\u2013153}} After a brief period on Roxburgh Place, it relocated to the newly constructed [[Chambers Street (Edinburgh)|Chambers Street]] near where its former site had stood. The move caused the Institution severe financial difficulties, which were compounded by a combination of declining funds from subscribers and increased costs from its growing student body. In 1873, the Directors turned to [[George Heriot]]'s Trust for support, and agreed to a merger of the Trust's endowment with the Institution's own. The proposed merger was provisional to changes in the structure of the Watt Institution, which would see the organisation become a technical college with representatives of the Trust in management positions. Accepting these changes, the Watt Institution officially became '''Heriot-Watt College''' in 1885, and was subsequently on far firmer financial ground.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|160\u2013161}}\n\n====The Watt Club====\n\n{{See also|The Watt Club}}\n\nThe Watt Club was founded at the Watt Institution on 12 May 1854, and is today the oldest alumni organisation in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alumni.hw.ac.uk/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=449|title=Heriot-Watt University: A Short History of the Watt Club.|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref>  Following the unveiling of a statue of James Watt outside the Institution, local jeweller J.E Vernon proposed that\n\n<blockquote>\"[a club should be formed] whose object would be to sup together on the anniversary of the birth of James Watt\u2026and also to promote the interests of the School, by raising a fund each year to provide prizes.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|144\u2013145}}\"</blockquote>\n\nWatt Club Medals are still awarded by the organisation each year to Heriot-Watt's most highly achieving students, while the Watt Club Prize is awarded by The Watt Club Council to recognise student initiative and enterprise.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.hw.ac.uk/students/studies/student-record.htm|title=Heriot-Watt Academic Registry: Prizes and Awards.|accessdate=19 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Heriot-Watt College===\n\n[[File:Chambers Street, Edinburgh - geograph.org.uk - 1419940.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The former site of the Watt School|The former site of Heriot-Watt College on [[Chambers Street (Edinburgh)|Chambers Street]], today occupied by the Edinburgh [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service|Crown Office]].]]\n\nAfter the establishment of Heriot-Watt as a technical college, the new management committee set about extending the institution's buildings and strengthening its academic reputation.<ref name=\"nahste two\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nahste.ac.uk/cgi-bin/view_isad.pl?id=GB-0582-HWC&view=basic|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020906072325/http://www.nahste.ac.uk/cgi-bin/view_isad.pl?id=GB-0582-HWC&view=basic|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 September 2002|publisher=NAHSTE|title=Records of Heriot-Watt College|accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref> In its new form the College was one of only three non-university institutions in the UK with the power to appoint professors, and the first of these was appointed in 1887. In 1902 the College became a [[central institution]], while in 1904 it introduced awards for graduating students which were similar to university degrees.<ref name=\"nahste two\" />\n\nExpansion meant that the College made increasing demands on George Heriot's Trust throughout the first part of the 20th century, which ultimately led to the independence of the two bodies in 1927. While the Trust continued to pay Heriot-Watt a fixed sum each year, from then on the College was responsible for managing its own financial affairs.<ref name=\"nahste two\" />  Heriot-Watt continued to expand after becoming independent, opening a new extension in 1935.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|243}}\n\nBoth World Wars impacted on the speed of the College's expansion. During [[World War I]], student numbers dropped as young men joined the army, while teaching in engineering stalled as the department was used for the manufacture of shells and munitions.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|213\u2013215}} During [[World War II]], student numbers dropped again and the electrical engineering department became involved in training the armed services in the use of [[radar]].\n\nAfter the College introduced a postgraduate award in 1951, it offered awards equivalent to university degrees and doctorates in all practical respects.  Recognising this, in 1963 the [[Robbins Report]] recommended that it should be awarded university status. On 1 February 1966 the recommendation was enacted, as the institution officially became '''Heriot-Watt University'''.<ref name=\"nahste two\" />\n\n===Heriot-Watt University===\n[[File:Heriot-Watt Reception.jpg|thumb]]\nThe first personal chair was appointed in 1974.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=huc9AAAAIBAJ&sjid=k0gMAAAAIBAJ&pg=1874%2C5720115 |title=Heriot Watt's new professor |work=[[The Glasgow Herald]] |date=29 June 1974 |page=11 |accessdate=8 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nWhile Heriot-Watt continued to expand in the centre of Edinburgh after attaining university status, the institution had grown big enough that relocation was felt to be desirable.<ref name=\"nahste two\" /> In 1966 Midlothian County Council gifted the Riccarton estate north of [[Currie]] to the University and in 1969 work began on transforming the site into a future campus.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|252}} The process of relocation to Riccarton continued until 1992, with teaching and facilities divided between the new campus and the city centre until this time.<ref name=\"Heriot-Watt University: An Illustrated History\" />{{rp|379\u2013381}}\n\nThe University has continued to grow after completing its move to Riccarton, constructing additional student halls, a sports centre and a postgraduate centre on the site.

The man who struck Wesley identifies Jess as having witnessed his death to the police; Darnell and Max agree to help her by cleaning her car of Wesley's DNA, but worry that Jess' trauma and poor ability to lie will expose them. Felix assumes ownership of the school despite Joy refusing to sign on to the deal. Jess, feeling that Vanessa does not understand or appreciate her feelings, turns away from her. Darnell advises Jess to use emotional manipulation to throw off the cops, which allows her to pass questioning unscathed. When Vanessa fails to show up for a makeup date, however, she winds up cheating on her with a girl at the bar and decides to hide it. Joy, impressed with Felix's devotion to Guiding Hope, agrees to sign. When Murphy returns home, Jess passes information from Chelsea to her about Tyson's other killer. Felix informs Murphy that from now on, she'll be expected to work like everyone else. He also shows off a new watch--the same watch Wesley owned and that Murphy tried to dispose of.

Darnell refuses to cooperate with the police, and Jules leaves him. He decides to ask Nia for more responsibility, and asks Max to front the cash for a deal, unaware that he is, in fact, an informant. Max tips off his handler, Det. Barnes, to the deal, and is told to find out where it's taking place. Jess, overwhelmed with guilt, admits to cheating on Vanessa on the night of their seven-month anniversary.

When she returns to Tyson's old corner, she meets Darnell, Tyson's cousin and supplier, who tells her he's still alive. Bryant's wife, Gayle, rescinds a donation she made to Murphy's parents, driving a wedge between her and her mother Joy, who has given up trying to help her.

Murphy agrees to watch Chloe while Dean and Chelsea go on a date, and then takes her to the mall to meet a boy named Billy, unaware that Nia has paid Wesley's bail and provided him with her name. Murphy pays for Chloe to get a full makeover, boosting her confidence enough that she manages to overcome her shyness and get Billy to talk to her.

The man who struck Wesley identifies Jess as having witnessed his death to the police; Darnell and Max agree to help her by cleaning her car of Wesley's DNA, but worry that Jess' trauma and poor ability to lie will expose them. Felix assumes ownership of the school despite Joy refusing to sign on to the deal. Jess, feeling that Vanessa does not understand or appreciate her feelings, turns away from her. Darnell advises Jess to use emotional manipulation to throw off the cops, which allows her to pass questioning unscathed. When Vanessa fails to show up for a makeup date, however, she winds up cheating on her with a girl at the bar and decides to hide it. Joy, impressed with Felix's devotion to Guiding Hope, agrees to sign. When Murphy returns home, Jess passes information from Chelsea to her about Tyson's other killer. Felix informs Murphy that from now on, she'll be expected to work like everyone else. He also shows off a new watch--the same watch Wesley owned and that Murphy tried to dispose of.

Darnell refuses to cooperate with the police, and Jules leaves him. He decides to ask Nia for more responsibility, and asks Max to front the cash for a deal, unaware that he is, in fact, an informant. Max tips off his handler, Det.
