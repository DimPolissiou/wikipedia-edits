[[Homocysteine]] permanently degrades [[cysteine]] [[disulfide]] bridges and [[lysine]] [[amino acid]] residues in [[proteins]], gradually affecting function and structure.

STS (branded Fibrovein in Australia) liquids can be mixed at varying concentrations of sclerosant and varying sclerosant/gas proportions, with air or CO<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> to create foams. Foams may allow more veins to be treated per session with comparable efficacy. Their use in contrast to liquid sclerosant is still somewhat controversial.

Myers said these veins should be treated with endovenous techniques, citing high recurrence rates after surgical management, and risk of nerve damage up to 15%. By comparison ERA has been shown to control 80% of cases of small saphenous vein reflux at 4 years, said Myers. Complications for ERA include burns, paraesthesia, clinical [[phlebitis]] and slightly higher rates of [[deep vein thrombosis]] (0.57%) and [[pulmonary embolism]] (0.17%). One 3-year study compared ERA, with a recurrence rate of 33%, to open surgery, which had a recurrence rate of 23%.\n\nSteam treatment consists in injection of pulses of steam into the sick vein.

ELA is performed as an outpatient procedure and does not require an operating theatre, nor does the patient need a [[general anaesthetic]]. Doctors use high-frequency ultrasound during the procedure to visualize the anatomical relationships between the saphenous structures. Some practitioners also perform phlebectomy or ultrasound guided sclerotherapy at the time of endovenous treatment. Follow-up treatment to smaller branch varicose veins is often needed in the weeks or months after the initial procedure. Steam is a very promising treatment for both doctors (easy introduction of catheters, efficient on recurrences, ambulatory procedure, easy and economic procedure) and patients (less post-operative pain, a natural agent, fast recovery to daily activities).\n\n==Epidemiology==\nThis condition is most common after age 50.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fifth Edition: Diseases of the Human Body|last=Tamparo|first=Carol|publisher=F.A.
