The album is the first [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)#Joker.27s Cards|Joker's Card]] in the group's [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)|Dark Carnival]] mythology. The album's lyrics describe the Carnival of Carnage as a representation of the violence that occurs within the [[ghetto]]s, which takes the form of a traveling carnival to enact the same brutality on the [[upper class]].\n\n''Carnival Of Carnage'' was the first album on which Insane Clown Posse collaborated with producer [[Mike E. Clark]], who would work with the group throughout much of their career. It features guest appearances by popular [[Detroit]] rappers [[Esham]] and [[Kid Rock]]. The album features the only recorded appearances of member John Kickjazz, who left the group prior to the album's release. Although the album did not initially sell well, it became eligible for [[Music recording sales certification|gold certification]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in 2010.\n\n==Conception==\n\n===Background===\n{{main|Insane Clown Posse}}\n[[Violent J|Joseph Bruce]] and [[Shaggy 2 Dope|Joseph Utsler]] formed a hip hop group in 1990.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint539\">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |date=August 2003 |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/n550 539]\u2013542 |chapter=Complete Discography }}</ref> Under the stage names Violent J, 2 Dope, and John Kickjazz, the group began performing at local night clubs under the name of their gang, Inner City Posse.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint539\"/> By late 1991, the group had invested more money into production than was covered by returns. They decided that their [[gangsta rap]] style was the cause of the problem: Most emcees at the time used similar styles, making it difficult for Inner City Posse to distinguish itself stylistically.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint151\">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Violent J|last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |date=August 2003 |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/151 151\u2013185] |chapter=The Dark Carnival }}</ref> Bruce suggested the band instead adapt a style similar to the hallucinatory, surrealistic \"[[Esham#style|acid rap]]\" of fellow Detroit rapper Esham, in a bid to have Detroit represent acid rap, much as [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] represented gangsta rap. The group agreed, but not to copying the style of Esham closely. Instead, they suggested using horror-themed lyrics as an emotional outlet for all their negative life experiences. They were also unanimous in deciding not to rap openly about [[Satan]], which Esham often did.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint151\"/>\n\nAfter the change in musical style, the group decided that it needed a new name. Utsler suggested keeping the \"I.C.P.\" initials to inform the community that Inner City Posse was not defunct, an idea to which the group agreed.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint151\"/> Several names were considered before Bruce recalled his dream of a clown running around in [[Delray, Detroit|Delray]], which became the inspiration for the group's new name [[Insane Clown Posse]]. The other members agreed, deciding that they would take on this new genre and name, and would all don face paint due to the success of their former clown-painted [[promotion (marketing)|hype]] man.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint151\"/>\n\n===Recording===\n''Carnival of Carnage'' began recording at Miller Midi Productions in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] with Chuck Miller producing and mastering the album.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint151\"/> Miller charged the group US$6,000 to produce the songs \"Red Neck Hoe,\" \"Psychopathic,\" \"Your Rebel Flag,\" and part of \"Night of the Axe.\"<ref name=\"BehindthePaint188\">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Violent J |last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |date=August 2003 |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/188 188\u2013208] |chapter=The Broken Path of a Dream }}</ref> Seeing that they were being overcharged, Alex Abbiss made his first major managerial move by finding another producer, [[Mike E.

Clark mastered his part of the album at Rythmatic Studio, and continued to work with the group throughout their career.\n\nOriginal group member John Kickjazz appeared on the songs \"Your Rebel Flag\", \"Psychopathic\", \"Blacken' Your Eyes\", \"Wizard of the Hood\", \"Red Neck Hoe\" and \"Taste\".<ref name=\"BehindthePaint189\">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Violent J |last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |date=August 2003 |edition=2nd |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/189 189\u2013208] |chapter=The Broken Path of a Dream }}</ref> \"Carnival of Carnage\" was originally recorded by [[Esham]] at Hells Doors Studio, but he pronounced \"carnage\" as \"carnicks\" and refused to redo it.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint189\"/> The final version of the song was recorded by Joseph Bruce over a reversed recording of the original.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint189\"/>\n\nAwesome Dre was originally going to do a verse on \"Taste.\" While Insane Clown Posse waited in the studio for him to arrive, Esham suggested that he appear on the track instead for the same amount of money, and the group allowed him to record a verse. Esham was paid $500 for his appearance.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint189\"/> [[Kid Rock]] demanded a hundred more than Esham, and was paid $600 to appear on \"Is That You?\"<ref name=\"BehindthePaint189\"/> He showed up to record the song intoxicated, but re-recorded his vocals and record scratching the following day.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint189\"/>\n\n===Joker's Cards===\n''Carnival of Carnage'' is the first [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)#Joker's Cards|Joker's Card]] in Insane Clown Posse's [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)|Dark Carnival]] [[concept album]] series.<ref name=\"McIver\">{{cite book |last=McIver |first=Joel |title=Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock & Punk |year=2002 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=0-7119-9209-6 |page=64 }}</ref> The Dark Carnival is a concept of the [[afterlife]] in which souls are sent to a form of [[limbo]] while waiting to be sent to [[heaven]] or [[hell]] based on their [[Divine judgment|individual actions]].

The album is the first [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)#Joker.27s Cards|Joker's Card]] in the group's [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)|Dark Carnival]] mythology. The album's lyrics describe the Carnival of Carnage as a representation of the violence that occurs within the [[ghetto]]s, which takes the form of a traveling carnival to enact the same brutality on the [[upper class]].\n\n''Carnival Of Carnage'' was the first album on which Insane Clown Posse collaborated with producer [[Mike E. Clark]], who would work with the group throughout much of their career. It features guest appearances by popular [[Detroit]] rappers [[Esham]] and [[Kid Rock]]. The album features the only recorded appearances of member John Kickjazz, who left the group prior to the album's release. Although the album did not initially sell well, it became eligible for [[Music recording sales certification|gold certification]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in 2010.\n\n==Conception==\n\n===Background===\n{{main|Insane Clown Posse}}\n[[Violent J|Joseph Bruce]] and [[Shaggy 2 Dope|Joseph Utsler]] formed a hip hop group in 1990.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint539\">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |date=August 2003 |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/n550 539]\u2013542 |chapter=Complete Discography }}</ref> Under the stage names Violent J, 2 Dope, and John Kickjazz, the group began performing at local night clubs under the name of their gang, Inner City Posse.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint539\"/> By late 1991, the group had invested more money into production than was covered by returns. They decided that their [[gangsta rap]] style was the cause of the problem: Most emcees at the time used similar styles, making it difficult for Inner City Posse to distinguish itself stylistically.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint151\">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Violent J|last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |date=August 2003 |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/151 151\u2013185] |chapter=The Dark Carnival }}</ref> Bruce suggested the band instead adapt a style similar to the hallucinatory, surrealistic \"[[Esham#style|acid rap]]\" of fellow Detroit rapper Esham, in a bid to have Detroit represent acid rap, much as [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] represented gangsta rap. The group agreed, but not to copying the style of Esham closely. Instead, they suggested using horror-themed lyrics as an emotional outlet for all their negative life experiences. They were also unanimous in deciding not to rap openly about [[Satan]], which Esham often did.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint151\"/>\n\nAfter the change in musical style, the group decided that it needed a new name. Utsler suggested keeping the \"I.C.P.\" initials to inform the community that Inner City Posse was not defunct, an idea to which the group agreed.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint151\"/> Several names were considered before Bruce recalled his dream of a clown running around in [[Delray, Detroit|Delray]], which became the inspiration for the group's new name [[Insane Clown Posse]]. The other members agreed, deciding that they would take on this new genre and name, and would all don face paint due to the success of their former clown-painted [[promotion (marketing)|hype]] man.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint151\"/>\n\n===Recording===\n''Carnival of Carnage'' began recording at Miller Midi Productions in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] with Chuck Miller producing and mastering the album.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint151\"/> Miller charged the group US$6,000 to produce the songs \"Red Neck Hoe,\" \"Psychopathic,\" \"Your Rebel Flag,\" and part of \"Night of the Axe.\"<ref name=\"BehindthePaint188\">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Violent J |last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |date=August 2003 |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/188 188\u2013208] |chapter=The Broken Path of a Dream }}</ref> Seeing that they were being overcharged, Alex Abbiss made his first major managerial move by finding another producer, [[Mike E.

Clark mastered his part of the album at Rythmatic Studio, and continued to work with the group throughout their career.\n\nOriginal group member John Kickjazz appeared on the songs \"Your Rebel Flag\", \"Psychopathic\", \"Blacken' Your Eyes\", \"Wizard of the Hood\", \"Red Neck Hoe\" and \"Taste\".<ref name=\"BehindthePaint189\">{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Violent J |last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |date=August 2003 |edition=2nd |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/189 189\u2013208] |chapter=The Broken Path of a Dream }}</ref> \"Carnival of Carnage\" was originally recorded by [[Esham]] at Hells Doors Studio, but he pronounced \"carnage\" as \"carnicks\" and refused to redo it.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint189\"/> The final version of the song was recorded by Joseph Bruce over a reversed recording of the original.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint189\"/>\n\nAwesome Dre was originally going to do a verse on \"Taste.\" While Insane Clown Posse waited in the studio for him to arrive, Esham suggested that he appear on the track instead for the same amount of money, and the group allowed him to record a verse. Esham was paid $500 for his appearance.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint189\"/> [[Kid Rock]] demanded a hundred more than Esham, and was paid $600 to appear on \"Is That You?\"<ref name=\"BehindthePaint189\"/> He showed up to record the song intoxicated, but re-recorded his vocals and record scratching the following day.<ref name=\"BehindthePaint189\"/>\n\n===Joker's Cards===\n''Carnival of Carnage'' is the first [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)#Joker's Cards|Joker's Card]] in Insane Clown Posse's [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)|Dark Carnival]] [[concept album]] series.<ref name=\"McIver\">{{cite book |last=McIver |first=Joel |title=Nu-metal: The Next Generation of Rock & Punk |year=2002 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=0-7119-9209-6 |page=64 }}</ref> The Dark Carnival is a concept of the [[afterlife]] in which souls are sent to a form of [[limbo]] while waiting to be sent to [[heaven]] or [[hell]] based on their [[Divine judgment|individual actions]].

Many of his lyrics were derived from his experiences of growing up in a poor family that was neglected by the government. He and his brother [[Robert Bruce (rapper)|Robert]] used to escape from their impoverished reality by gathering themselves in a forest called \"Picker Forest\".

However that description is incomplete: Describing the gravitational field of a black hole in the general theory of relativity, physical quantities such as the [[spacetime curvature]] diverge at the center of the black hole. This signals the break down of the general theory of relativity and the need for a theory that goes beyond general relativity.

Such theories are often referred to as a [[theory of everything]]. Others, such as loop quantum gravity, make no such attempt; instead, they make an effort to quantize the gravitational field while it is kept separate from the other forces.\n\nOne of the difficulties of formulating a quantum gravity theory is that quantum gravitational effects only appear at length scales near the [[Planck scale]], around 10<sup>\u221235</sup> meters, a scale far smaller, and hence only accessible with far higher energies, than those currently available in high energy [[particle accelerator]]s.

Many of the accepted notions of a unified theory of physics since the 1970s assume, and to some degree depend upon, the existence of the graviton.

The theory must be characterized by a choice of ''finitely many'' parameters, which could, in principle, be set by experiment. For example, in [[quantum electrodynamics]] these parameters are the charge and mass of the electron, as measured at a particular energy scale.\n\nOn the other hand, in quantizing gravity there are, in perturbation theory, ''infinitely many independent parameters'' (counterterm coefficients) needed to define the theory. For a given choice of those parameters, one could make sense of the theory, but since it is impossible to conduct infinite experiments to fix the values of every parameter, it has been argued that one does not, in perturbation theory, have a meaningful physical theory. At low energies, the logic of the [[renormalization group]] tells us that, despite the unknown choices of these infinitely many parameters, quantum gravity will reduce to the usual Einstein theory of general relativity. On the other hand, if we could probe very high energies where quantum effects take over, then ''every one'' of the infinitely many unknown parameters would begin to matter, and we could make no predictions at all.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIt is conceivable that, in the correct theory of quantum gravity, the infinitely many unknown parameters will reduce to a finite number that can then be measured. One possibility is that normal [[perturbation theory]] is not a reliable guide to the renormalizability of the theory, and that there really ''is'' a [[UV fixed point]] for gravity. Since this is a question of [[non-perturbative]] quantum field theory, it is difficult to find a reliable answer, but some people still pursue this option. Another possibility is that there are new, undiscovered symmetry principles that constrain the parameters and reduce them to a finite set. This is the route taken by [[string theory]], where all of the excitations of the string essentially manifest themselves as new symmetries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/blog/archives/000639.html|title=Motivation|last=Distler|first=Jacques|authorlink=Jacques Distler|date=2005-09-01|website=golem.ph.utexas.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}</ref>{{Better source|date=February 2019}}\n\n=== Quantum gravity as an effective field theory ===\n{{Main|Effective field theory}}\nIn an [[effective field theory]], all but the first few of the infinite set of parameters in a nonrenormalizable theory are suppressed by huge energy scales and hence can be neglected when computing low-energy effects.

In the case of quantum mechanics, it is time that is given and not dynamic, just as in Newtonian classical mechanics. In relativistic quantum field theory, just as in classical field theory, [[Minkowski spacetime]] is the fixed background of the theory.\n\n==== String theory ====\n[[File:Point&string.png|right|thumb|Interaction in the subatomic world: [[world line]]s of point-like [[Subatomic particle|particles]] in the [[Standard Model]] or a [[world sheet]] swept up by closed [[string (physics)|strings]] in string theory]]\n[[String theory]] can be seen as a generalization of [[quantum field theory]] where instead of point particles, string-like objects propagate in a fixed spacetime background, although the interactions among closed strings give rise to space-time in a dynamical way.\nAlthough string theory had its origins in the study of [[quark confinement]] and not of quantum gravity, it was soon discovered that the string spectrum contains the [[graviton]], and that \"condensation\" of certain vibration modes of strings is equivalent to a modification of the original background. In this sense, string perturbation theory exhibits exactly the features one would expect of a [[perturbation theory]] that may exhibit a strong dependence on asymptotics (as seen, for example, in the [[AdS/CFT]] correspondence) which is a weak form of [[Background independence|background dependence]].\n\n==== Background independent theories ====\n[[Loop quantum gravity]] is the fruit of an effort to formulate a [[background-independent]] quantum theory.\n\n[[Topological quantum field theory]] provided an example of background-independent quantum theory, but with no local degrees of freedom, and only finitely many degrees of freedom globally. This is inadequate to describe gravity in 3+1 dimensions, which has local degrees of freedom according to general relativity. In 2+1 dimensions, however, gravity is a topological field theory, and it has been successfully quantized in several different ways, including [[spin network]]s.\n\n=== Semi-classical quantum gravity ===\n[[Quantum field theory]] on curved (non-Minkowskian) backgrounds, while not a full quantum theory of gravity, has shown many promising early results. In an analogous way to the development of quantum electrodynamics in the early part of the 20th century (when physicists considered quantum mechanics in classical electromagnetic fields), the consideration of quantum field theory on a curved background has led to predictions such as black hole radiation.\n\nPhenomena such as the [[Unruh effect]], in which particles exist in certain accelerating frames but not in stationary ones, do not pose any difficulty when considered on a curved background (the Unruh effect occurs even in flat Minkowskian backgrounds).

Its second idea is that the quantum discreteness that determines the particle-like behavior of other field theories (for instance, the photons of the electromagnetic field) also affects the structure of space. In quantum world it is different from the normal.\n\nThe main result of loop quantum gravity is the derivation of a granular structure of space at the Planck length.  This is derived from following considerations: In the case of electromagnetism, the quantum operator representing the energy of each frequency of the field has a discrete spectrum. Thus the energy of each frequency is quantized, and the quanta are the photons. In the case of gravity, the operators representing the area and the volume of each surface or space region likewise have discrete spectrum. Thus area and volume of any portion of space are also quantized, where the quanta are elementary quanta of space.  It follows, then, that spacetime has an elementary quantum granular structure at the Planck scale, which cuts off the ultraviolet infinities of quantum field theory.\n\nThe quantum state of spacetime is described in the theory by means of a mathematical structure called [[spin network]]s. Spin networks were initially introduced by [[Roger Penrose]] in abstract form, and later shown by [[Carlo Rovelli]] and [[Lee Smolin]] to derive naturally from a non-perturbative quantization of general relativity.  Spin networks do not represent quantum states of a field in spacetime: they represent directly quantum states of spacetime.\n\nThe theory is based on the reformulation of general relativity known as [[Ashtekar variables]], which represent geometric gravity using mathematical analogues of [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal\n|last=Ashtekar\n|first=Abhay\n|authorlink=Abhay Ashtekar\n|title=New variables for classical and quantum gravity\n|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]\n|volume=57\n|pages=2244\u20132247\n|date=1986\n|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.57.2244\n|pmid=10033673\n|issue=18\n|ref=harv\n|bibcode=1986PhRvL..57.2244A\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n|last=Ashtekar\n|first=Abhay\n|authorlink=Abhay Ashtekar\n|title=New Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity\n|journal=[[Physical Review D]]\n|volume=36|issue=6|pages=1587\u20131602\n|date=1987\n|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.36.1587\n|pmid=9958340\n|ref=harv|bibcode = 1987PhRvD..36.1587A }}</ref>\nIn the quantum theory, space is represented by a network structure called a [[spin network]], evolving over time in discrete steps.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last=Thiemann\n|first=Thomas\n|title=Loop Quantum Gravity: An Inside View\n|journal=[[Approaches to Fundamental Physics]]\n|volume=721\n|pages=185\u2013263\n|year=2007\n|arxiv=hep-th/0608210\n|bibcode=2007LNP...721..185T\n|ref=harv\n|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-71117-9_10\n|series=Lecture Notes in Physics\n|isbn=978-3-540-71115-5\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Rovelli\n|first=Carlo\n|authorlink=Carlo Rovelli\n|title=Loop Quantum Gravity\n|journal=[[Living Reviews in Relativity]]\n|volume=1\n|date=1998\n|url=http://www.livingreviews.org/lrr-1998-1\n|accessdate=2008-03-13\n|ref=harv\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n | last=Ashtekar\n | first=Abhay\n | authorlink=Abhay Ashtekar\n | first2=Jerzy\n | last2=Lewandowski\n | title=Background Independent Quantum Gravity: A Status Report\n | journal=[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]]\n | volume=21\n | date=2004\n | issue=15\n | pages=R53\u2013R152\n | arxiv=gr-qc/0404018\n | doi=10.1088/0264-9381/21/15/R01\n |bibcode = 2004CQGra..21R..53A }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n|last=Thiemann\n|first=Thomas\n|chapter=Lectures on Loop Quantum Gravity\n|date=2003\n|volume=631\n|pages=41\u2013135\n|ref=harv\n|arxiv=gr-qc/0210094\n|bibcode=2003LNP...631...41T\n|doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-45230-0_3 |series=Lecture Notes in Physics\n|isbn=978-3-540-40810-9\n|title=Quantum Gravity\n}}</ref>\n\nThe dynamics of the theory is today constructed in several versions.

The theory must be characterized by a choice of ''finitely many'' parameters, which could, in principle, be set by experiment. For example, in [[quantum electrodynamics]] these parameters are the charge and mass of the electron, as measured at a particular energy scale.\n\nOn the other hand, in quantizing gravity there are, in perturbation theory, ''infinitely many independent parameters'' (counterterm coefficients) needed to define the theory. For a given choice of those parameters, one could make sense of the theory, but since it is impossible to conduct infinite experiments to fix the values of every parameter, it has been argued that one does not, in perturbation theory, have a meaningful physical theory. At low energies, the logic of the [[renormalization group]] tells us that, despite the unknown choices of these infinitely many parameters, quantum gravity will reduce to the usual Einstein theory of general relativity. On the other hand, if we could probe very high energies where quantum effects take over, then ''every one'' of the infinitely many unknown parameters would begin to matter, and we could make no predictions at all.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIt is conceivable that, in the correct theory of quantum gravity, the infinitely many unknown parameters will reduce to a finite number that can then be measured. One possibility is that normal [[perturbation theory]] is not a reliable guide to the renormalizability of the theory, and that there really ''is'' a [[UV fixed point]] for gravity. Since this is a question of [[non-perturbative]] quantum field theory, it is difficult to find a reliable answer, but some people still pursue this option. Another possibility is that there are new, undiscovered symmetry principles that constrain the parameters and reduce them to a finite set.

To a certain extent, general relativity can be seen to be a [[relational theory]],<ref>{{cite book\n|last = Smolin\n|first = Lee\n|authorlink= Lee Smolin\n|title = Three Roads to Quantum Gravity\n|publisher = [[Basic Books]]\n|date = 2001\n|pages = [https://archive.org/details/threeroadstoquan00smol_0/page/20 20\u201325]\n|isbn = 978-0-465-07835-6|title-link = Three Roads to Quantum Gravity\n}} Pages 220\u2013226 are annotated references and guide for further reading.</ref> in which the only physically relevant information is the relationship between different events in space-time.\n\nOn the other hand, quantum mechanics has depended since its inception on a fixed background (non-dynamic) structure. In the case of quantum mechanics, it is time that is given and not dynamic, just as in Newtonian classical mechanics. In relativistic quantum field theory, just as in classical field theory, [[Minkowski spacetime]] is the fixed background of the theory.\n\n==== String theory ====\n[[File:Point&string.png|right|thumb|Interaction in the subatomic world: [[world line]]s of point-like [[Subatomic particle|particles]] in the [[Standard Model]] or a [[world sheet]] swept up by closed [[string (physics)|strings]] in string theory]]\n[[String theory]] can be seen as a generalization of [[quantum field theory]] where instead of point particles, string-like objects propagate in a fixed spacetime background, although the interactions among closed strings give rise to space-time in a dynamical way.\nAlthough string theory had its origins in the study of [[quark confinement]] and not of quantum gravity, it was soon discovered that the string spectrum contains the [[graviton]], and that \"condensation\" of certain vibration modes of strings is equivalent to a modification of the original background. In this sense, string perturbation theory exhibits exactly the features one would expect of a [[perturbation theory]] that may exhibit a strong dependence on asymptotics (as seen, for example, in the [[AdS/CFT]] correspondence) which is a weak form of [[Background independence|background dependence]].\n\n==== Background independent theories ====\n[[Loop quantum gravity]] is the fruit of an effort to formulate a [[background-independent]] quantum theory.\n\n[[Topological quantum field theory]] provided an example of background-independent quantum theory, but with no local degrees of freedom, and only finitely many degrees of freedom globally. This is inadequate to describe gravity in 3+1 dimensions, which has local degrees of freedom according to general relativity. In 2+1 dimensions, however, gravity is a topological field theory, and it has been successfully quantized in several different ways, including [[spin network]]s.\n\n=== Semi-classical quantum gravity ===\n[[Quantum field theory]] on curved (non-Minkowskian) backgrounds, while not a full quantum theory of gravity, has shown many promising early results. In an analogous way to the development of quantum electrodynamics in the early part of the 20th century (when physicists considered quantum mechanics in classical electromagnetic fields), the consideration of quantum field theory on a curved background has led to predictions such as black hole radiation.\n\nPhenomena such as the [[Unruh effect]], in which particles exist in certain accelerating frames but not in stationary ones, do not pose any difficulty when considered on a curved background (the Unruh effect occurs even in flat Minkowskian backgrounds). The vacuum state is the state with the least energy (and may or may not contain particles).\nSee [[Quantum field theory in curved spacetime]] for a more complete discussion.\n\n=== Problem of time ===\n{{Main|Problem of time}}\nA conceptual difficulty in combining quantum mechanics with general relativity arises from the contrasting role of time within these two frameworks. In quantum theories time acts as an independent background through which states evolve, with the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian operator]] acting as the [[Translation operator (quantum mechanics)|generator of infinitesimal translations]] of quantum states through time.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Modern Quantum Mechanics|last=Sakurai|first=J.

Its second idea is that the quantum discreteness that determines the particle-like behavior of other field theories (for instance, the photons of the electromagnetic field) also affects the structure of space.\n\nThe main result of loop quantum gravity is the derivation of a granular structure of space at the Planck length.  This is derived from following considerations: In the case of electromagnetism, the quantum operator representing the energy of each frequency of the field has a discrete spectrum. Thus the energy of each frequency is quantized, and the quanta are the photons. In the case of gravity, the operators representing the area and the volume of each surface or space region likewise have discrete spectrum. Thus area and volume of any portion of space are also quantized, where the quanta are elementary quanta of space.  It follows, then, that spacetime has an elementary quantum granular structure at the Planck scale, which cuts off the ultraviolet infinities of quantum field theory.\n\nThe quantum state of spacetime is described in the theory by means of a mathematical structure called [[spin network]]s. Spin networks were initially introduced by [[Roger Penrose]] in abstract form, and later shown by [[Carlo Rovelli]] and [[Lee Smolin]] to derive naturally from a non-perturbative quantization of general relativity.  Spin networks do not represent quantum states of a field in spacetime: they represent directly quantum states of spacetime.\n\nThe theory is based on the reformulation of general relativity known as [[Ashtekar variables]], which represent geometric gravity using mathematical analogues of [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal\n|last=Ashtekar\n|first=Abhay\n|authorlink=Abhay Ashtekar\n|title=New variables for classical and quantum gravity\n|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]\n|volume=57\n|pages=2244\u20132247\n|date=1986\n|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.57.2244\n|pmid=10033673\n|issue=18\n|ref=harv\n|bibcode=1986PhRvL..57.2244A\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n|last=Ashtekar\n|first=Abhay\n|authorlink=Abhay Ashtekar\n|title=New Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity\n|journal=[[Physical Review D]]\n|volume=36|issue=6|pages=1587\u20131602\n|date=1987\n|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.36.1587\n|pmid=9958340\n|ref=harv|bibcode = 1987PhRvD..36.1587A }}</ref>\nIn the quantum theory, space is represented by a network structure called a [[spin network]], evolving over time in discrete steps.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last=Thiemann\n|first=Thomas\n|title=Loop Quantum Gravity: An Inside View\n|journal=[[Approaches to Fundamental Physics]]\n|volume=721\n|pages=185\u2013263\n|year=2007\n|arxiv=hep-th/0608210\n|bibcode=2007LNP...721..185T\n|ref=harv\n|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-71117-9_10\n|series=Lecture Notes in Physics\n|isbn=978-3-540-71115-5\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n|last=Rovelli\n|first=Carlo\n|authorlink=Carlo Rovelli\n|title=Loop Quantum Gravity\n|journal=[[Living Reviews in Relativity]]\n|volume=1\n|date=1998\n|url=http://www.livingreviews.org/lrr-1998-1\n|accessdate=2008-03-13\n|ref=harv\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal\n | last=Ashtekar\n | first=Abhay\n | authorlink=Abhay Ashtekar\n | first2=Jerzy\n | last2=Lewandowski\n | title=Background Independent Quantum Gravity: A Status Report\n | journal=[[Classical and Quantum Gravity]]\n | volume=21\n | date=2004\n | issue=15\n | pages=R53\u2013R152\n | arxiv=gr-qc/0404018\n | doi=10.1088/0264-9381/21/15/R01\n |bibcode = 2004CQGra..21R..53A }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n|last=Thiemann\n|first=Thomas\n|chapter=Lectures on Loop Quantum Gravity\n|date=2003\n|volume=631\n|pages=41\u2013135\n|ref=harv\n|arxiv=gr-qc/0210094\n|bibcode=2003LNP...631...41T\n|doi = 10.1007/978-3-540-45230-0_3 |series=Lecture Notes in Physics\n|isbn=978-3-540-40810-9\n|title=Quantum Gravity\n}}</ref>\n\nThe dynamics of the theory is today constructed in several versions.

The ''Times Herald'' was the result of a 1927 merger of the ''Times-Press'', a merger of the old Middletown ''([[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]]) Press'' of the 1850s and the ''Daily Times'', founded in 1891, and the ''Daily Herald'', founded in 1918, but also going back to the 1850s. The ''Times Herald'' had the Middletown market to itself from 1927 until 1956, when Jacob M. Kaplan started publishing the ''Middletown Daily Record'', the first daily U.S. newspaper to use [[cold type]], from a garage on North Street. The new paper grew to a daily [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] of 19,000 within three years but lost a lot of money in the process.<ref name=\"WBurkhart\">{{cite news| url=http://www.recordonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/misc?url=/static/aboutUs.htm| title=About Us| publisher=The Times Herald-Record| first=Wade | last=Burkhart}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Times Herald Record offices.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Times Herald-Record\u2032s main offices in Middletown]]\n\nIn November 1959, James H.

''The Gazette'', serving Port Jervis and surrounding communities, still exists as a weekly newspaper published by the ''Times Herald-Record''. A few months later, in April 1960, Kaplan sold his ''Daily Record'' to Ottaway.<ref name=\"WBurkhart\"/> Ottaway tried to convert the paper to a [[broadsheet]], but restored the original format after three months. In October 1960 the two papers were merged into their current form. ''The Sunday Record'' began in 1969, shortly after Ottaway itself was acquired by Dow Jones. In 2007, when News Corp. bought Dow Jones, the newspaper again changed hands.\n\n''The Record'' was often an innovator in newspaper publishing and was one of the first to print color. The newspaper underwent a significant redesign and page cut-down in 2007. At that time, ''The Sunday Record'' was given the standard ''Times Herald-Record'' nameplate. In 2008, the newspaper's Web site, recordonline.com, underwent a complementary redesign. The in-print and online redesigns were launched to coincide with bolstered local and business news coverage.\n\n''The Record'' is the newspaper covering [[Bethel, New York]], where the [[Woodstock Festival]] was held in 1969.
