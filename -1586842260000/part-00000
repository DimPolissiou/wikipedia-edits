The kingdom was a successor of the medieval [[Lanna]] kingdom, which had been under Burmese rule for two centuries until it was captured by Siamese forces under [[Taksin]] of [[Thonburi]] in 1774. It was ruled by the [[Chet Ton Dynasty|Thipchak Dynasty]] and came under Thonburi<!--?--> and was later a Bangkokian tributary.\n\n==Liberation from Burmese Rule==\nPrince [[Kawila]] of the Tipchak dynasty, son of [[Saopha]] Chaikaew of [[Nakhon Lampang]], and Phraya Chabaan, a Lanna noble, plotted the liberation of Lanna cities from Burmese authorities and decided to request support from King Taksin of Thonburi in 1774. Taksin sent [[Chakri Dynasty|Phraya Chakri]] (later [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok]]) and Phraya Surasi (later [[Maha Sura Singhanat]]) to capture Chiang Mai. The joint forces took Chiangmai and Lampang. [[Phraya]] Chaban was installed as Phraya Luang Vachiraprakarn the Lord of Chiang Mai; King Chaikaew died the same year, to be succeeded by his son Kawila as the King of Lampang. Kawila's sister, [[Sri Anocha]], was married to Phraya Surasi.\n\nThe [[Burmese-Siamese Wars#Konbaung\u2013Bangkok|Burmese tried their best to recover their lost territories]]. The attacks were so immense that Vachiraprakarn decided to evacuate the city, and moved his people to Lampang in 1776.\n\nIn 1782, Phraya Chakri, now [[Thai royal and noble titles#Somdet Chao Phraya|Somdet Chao Phraya]] Maha Kasatseuk, suppressed a rebellion at Thonburi and crowned himself Phutthayotfa Chulalok the King of Siam at [[Rattanakosin Island]] (commonly called Bangkok). As his brother-in-law, Phutthayotfa Chulalok made Kawila the Lord Min Vachiraprakarn of Chiang Mai in 1782 as a Siamese tributary.\n\nLord Min Vachiraprakarn evacuated the people of Lampang to stay at Vieng Paxang until sufficient resources had been gathered to move to Chiang Mai in 1796. Lord Min Vachiraprakarn pursued the policies of manpower recovery<ref>[http://www.sri.cmu.ac.th/elanna/elanna47/public_html/history/king_1.html]{{dead link|date=September 2015}}</ref> as he invaded the neighboring states to gather the people into Chiang Mai and Lampang, including the [[Shan States]], [[Kengtung]], and [[Chiang Hung]]. In 1799, the court of Chiang Mai renamed the city Rattana-ingsa. Min Vachiraprakarn constructed auspicious animal monuments around the cities.\n\n==A vassal to Bangkok==\nIn 1802, Phutthayotfa Chulalok elevated Min Vachiraprakarn as King of Chiang Mai presiding over Lanna states (Principalities of [[Lampang]], [[Lamphun]], [[Nan, Thailand|Nan]], and [[Phrae]]) but as a Siamese vassal. In 1804, King Kawila retook [[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]] from the [[Konbaung dynasty]]. Also, Kawila went on various campaigns against Burma and sent the captives to Bangkok.\n\nThe Chiang Mai succession was strictly regulated by Bangkok. After the death of a king, the ''Uparaja'' retained the status as a prince until he visited the King of Bangkok that he would be elevated to the king. As the result, the reign of Chiang Mai kings were not continuous as the ''Uparaja'' usually spent at least a year going to Bangkok.\n\nChiang Mai sent tributes to Bangkok triennially. The tributes included valuable forest products like [[teak]]. Chiang Mai also provided troops and manpower to Bangkok on military campaigns, including the Rebellion of [[Anouvong]] in 1824. Also, Chiang Mai was the main base for the Siamese efforts to expand into Shan states.\n\nThe degree of Chiang Mai's control over its subordinate states varied on the course of history. Under Kawila, his fresh installment by Rama I enforced Chiang Mai control over the principalities. However, the principalities then gained autonomy as strong symbolic justification from Bangkok was not granted.

The kingdom was a successor of the medieval [[Lanna]] kingdom, which had been under Burmese rule for two centuries until it was captured by Siamese forces under [[Taksin]] of [[Thonburi]] in 1774. It was ruled by the [[Chet Ton Dynasty|Thipchak Dynasty]] and came under Thonburi<!--?--> and was later a Bangkokian tributary.\n\n==Liberation from Burmese Rule==\nPrince [[Kawila]] of the Tipchak dynasty, son of [[Saopha]] Chaikaew of [[Nakhon Lampang]], and Phraya Chabaan, a Lanna noble, plotted the liberation of Lanna cities from Burmese authorities and decided to request support from King Taksin of Thonburi in 1774. Taksin sent [[Chakri Dynasty|Phraya Chakri]] (later [[Phutthayotfa Chulalok]]) and Phraya Surasi (later [[Maha Sura Singhanat]]) to capture Chiang Mai. The joint forces took Chiangmai and Lampang. [[Phraya]] Chaban was installed as Phraya Luang Vachiraprakarn the Lord of Chiang Mai; King Chaikaew died the same year, to be succeeded by his son Kawila as the King of Lampang. Kawila's sister, [[Sri Anocha]], was married to Phraya Surasi.\n\nThe [[Burmese-Siamese Wars#Konbaung\u2013Bangkok|Burmese tried their best to recover their lost territories]]. The attacks were so immense that Vachiraprakarn decided to evacuate the city, and moved his people to Lampang in 1776.\n\nIn 1782, Phraya Chakri, now [[Thai royal and noble titles#Somdet Chao Phraya|Somdet Chao Phraya]] Maha Kasatseuk, suppressed a rebellion at Thonburi and crowned himself Phutthayotfa Chulalok the King of Siam at [[Rattanakosin Island]] (commonly called Bangkok). As his brother-in-law, Phutthayotfa Chulalok made Kawila the Lord Min Vachiraprakarn of Chiang Mai in 1782 as a Siamese tributary.\n\nLord Min Vachiraprakarn evacuated the people of Lampang to stay at Vieng Paxang until sufficient resources had been gathered to move to Chiang Mai in 1796. Lord Min Vachiraprakarn pursued the policies of manpower recovery<ref>[http://www.sri.cmu.ac.th/elanna/elanna47/public_html/history/king_1.html]{{dead link|date=September 2015}}</ref> as he invaded the neighboring states to gather the people into Chiang Mai and Lampang, including the [[Shan States]], [[Kengtung]], and [[Chiang Hung]]. In 1799, the court of Chiang Mai renamed the city Rattana-ingsa. Min Vachiraprakarn constructed auspicious animal monuments around the cities.\n\n==A vassal to Bangkok==\nIn 1802, Phutthayotfa Chulalok elevated Min Vachiraprakarn as King of Chiang Mai presiding over Lanna states (Principalities of [[Lampang]], [[Lamphun]], [[Nan, Thailand|Nan]], and [[Phrae]]) but as a Siamese vassal. In 1804, King Kawila retook [[Chiang Saen District|Chiang Saen]] from the [[Konbaung dynasty]]. Also, Kawila went on various campaigns against Burma and sent the captives to Bangkok.\n\nThe Chiang Mai succession was strictly regulated by Bangkok. After the death of a king, the ''Uparaja'' retained the status as a prince until he visited the King of Bangkok that he would be elevated to the king. As the result, the reign of Chiang Mai kings were not continuous as the ''Uparaja'' usually spent at least a year going to Bangkok.\n\nChiang Mai sent tributes to Bangkok triennially. The tributes included valuable forest products like [[teak]]. Chiang Mai also provided troops and manpower to Bangkok on military campaigns, including the Rebellion of [[Anouvong]] in 1824. Also, Chiang Mai was the main base for the Siamese efforts to expand into Shan states.\n\nThe degree of Chiang Mai's control over its subordinate states varied on the course of history. Under Kawila, his fresh installment by Rama I enforced Chiang Mai control over the principalities. However, the principalities then gained autonomy as strong symbolic justification from Bangkok was not granted. In the mid-19th century, control of Chiang Mai resumed under Mahotrapratet due to the encouragement of [[Rama III]].\n\nSiamese interference in Chiang Mai's internal affairs remained sporadic.<ref>{{Cite book |author=David K.

L'enseignement de Bouddha Sakyamuni.jpg|alt=A landscape oriented painting showing a Buddha in red robes, seated in a throne, surrounded by sixteen adult figures and one baby. With the exception of the baby, all of the figures, including the Buddha, have blue halos.|thumb|right|450px|''The [[Sakyamuni]] Buddha'', by Song painter Zhang Shengwen, c. AD 1181\u20131186; although [[Buddhism]] was in decline and under attack by [[Neo-Confucian]] critics in the Song era, it nonetheless remained one of the major religious ideologies in China.]]\n\n[[China|Chinese]] society during the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279) was marked by political and legal reforms, a philosophical revival of [[Confucianism]], and the development of cities beyond administrative purposes into centers of trade, industry, and [[Maritime history|maritime]] commerce. The inhabitants of rural areas were mostly farmers, although some were also hunters, fishers, or government employees working in mines or the salt marshes. Conversely, shopkeepers, artisans, city guards, entertainers, laborers, and wealthy merchants lived in the county and provincial centers along with the [[Gentry (China)|Chinese gentry]]\u2014a small, elite community of educated scholars and [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-officials]].\n\nAs landholders and drafted government officials, the gentry considered themselves the leading members of society; gaining their cooperation and employment was essential for the county or provincial bureaucrat overburdened with official duties. In many ways, scholar-officials of the Song period differed from the more aristocratic scholar-officials of the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907). [[Imperial examinations|Civil service examinations]] became the primary means of appointment to an official post as competitors vying for official degrees dramatically increased. Frequent disagreements amongst ministers of state on ideological and policy issues led to political strife and the rise of political factions. This undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which broke apart as a social group and gave way to a multitude of families which provided sons for [[civil service]].\n\nConfucian or [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]] scholars in ancient China\u2014perhaps as far back as the late [[Zhou dynasty]] (c. 1046\u2013256 BC)\u2014categorized all socio-economic groups into [[Four occupations|four broad and hierarchical occupations]] (in descending order): the ''[[wiktionary:\u58eb|shi]]'' (scholars, or gentry), the ''[[wiktionary:\u519c|nong]]'' (peasant farmers), the ''[[wiktionary:\u5de5|gong]]'' (artisans and craftsmen), and the ''[[wiktionary:\u5546|shang]]'' (merchants).<ref name=\"fairbank 108\">Fairbank, 108.</ref> Wealthy landholders and officials possessed the resources to better prepare their sons for the civil service examinations, yet they were often rivaled in their power and wealth by merchants of the Song period. Merchants frequently colluded commercially and politically with officials, despite the fact that scholar-officials looked down on mercantile vocations as less respectable pursuits than farming or craftsmanship. The military also provided a means for advancement in Song society for those who became officers, even though soldiers were not highly respected members of society. Although certain domestic and familial duties were expected of women in Song society, they nonetheless enjoyed a wide range of social and legal rights in an otherwise [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] society. Women's improved rights to property came gradually with the increasing value of [[dowry|dowries]] offered by brides' families.\n\n[[Taoism|Daoism]] and [[Buddhism]] were the dominant religions of China in the Song era, the latter deeply affecting many beliefs and principles of [[Neo-Confucianism]] throughout the dynasty. Ironically, Buddhism came under heavy criticism by staunch Confucian advocates and philosophers of the time. Older beliefs in ancient [[Chinese mythology]], [[Chinese folk religion|folk religion]], and [[ancestor worship]] also played a large part in people's daily lives, as the Chinese believed that deities and ghosts of the spiritual realm frequently interacted with the living realm.\n\nThe Song justice system was maintained by policing sheriffs, investigators, official coroners, and exam-drafted officials who became [[County magistrate (China)|county magistrate]]s. Song magistrates were encouraged to apply both their practical knowledge as well as the written law in making judicial decisions that would promote societal morality. Advancements in early [[forensic science]], a greater emphasis on gathering credible evidence, and careful recording by clerks of autopsy reports and witness testimonies aided authorities in convicting criminals.\n\n==Urban life==\n\n===Urban growth and management===\n{{Further|Urbanization in China}}\n[[File:Kaifeng in Northern Song.jpg|300px|thumb|Map of Bianliang, the capital city of Northern Song Dynasty]]\n[[File:Qingming Festival 3.jpg|alt=A long, landscape oriented segment of scroll depicting throngs of people, mainly men, crossing a bridge over a large river.

Long Yanyao, patriarch of the Long family, submitted to Song rule in 967 with the guarantee that he could rule Nanning as his personal property, to be passed down through his family without Song interference. In return the Long family was required to present tribute to the Song court. The other families were also offered the same conditions, which they accepted. Although they were included among the official prefectures of the Song dynasty, in practice, these families and their estates constituted independent hereditary kingdoms within the Song realm.{{sfn|Cosmo|2003|p=251}}\n\nIn 975, [[Emperor Taizong of Song]] ordered Song Jingyang and Long Hantang to attack the [[Mu'ege]] kingdom and drive them back across the [[Wu River (Yangtze tributary)|Yachi River]]. Whatever territory they seized they were allowed to keep. After a year of fighting, they succeeded in the endeavor.{{sfn|Cosmo|2003|p=252}}\n\n===Official careers===\nAfter the tumultuous [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (755\u2013763), the early Tang career path of officials rising in a [[Three Departments and Six Ministries|hierarchy of six ministries]]\u2014with Works given the lowest status and Personnel the highest\u2014was changed into a system where officials chose specialized careers within one of the six ministries.<ref name=\"hartwell 399 400\">Hartwell, 399\u2013400.</ref> The commissions of Salt and Iron, Funds, and Census that were created to deal with immediate financial crisis after An Lushan's insurrection were the influential basis for this change in career paths that became focused within functionally distinct hierarchies.<ref name=\"hartwell 399 400\"/> The varied career backgrounds and expertise of early Northern Song officials meant that they were to be given specific assignment to work in only one of the ministries: Personnel, Revenue, Rites, War, Justice, or Works.<ref name=\"hartwell 400\">Hartwell, 400.</ref> As China's population increased and regional economies became more complex the central government could no longer handle the separate parts of the empire efficiently. As a result of this, in 1082 the reorganization of the central bureaucracy scrapped the hierarchies of commissions in favor of the early Tang model of officials advancing through a hierarchy of ministries, each with different levels of prestige.<ref name=\"hartwell 400\"/>\n\n[[File:Ma Yuan Walking on Path in Spring.jpg|alt=A landscape oriented painting depicting a man in white robes standing on an unpaved path staring at the sky.|thumb|right|220px|[[Walking on a Mountain Path in Spring|An official strolling on a path in spring]], by [[Ma Yuan (painter)|Ma Yuan]] (c. 1160\u20131225).]]\nIn observing a multitude of biographies and funerary inscriptions, Hymes states that officials in the Northern Song era displayed a primary preoccupation with national interests, as they did not intervene in local or central government affairs for the benefit of their local prefecture or county.<ref name=\"hymes 128\">Hymes, 128.</ref> This trend was reversed in the Southern Song. Since the majority of central government officials in the Southern Song came from the macroregion of Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian, Hartwell and Hymes state that there was a great amount of ad hoc local interests represented in central government policies.<ref name=\"hartwell 400 404\"/><ref name=\"hymes 128\"/>\n\n[[County magistrate (China)|Lower-grade officials on the county and prefectural levels]] performed the necessary duties of administration such as collecting taxes, overseeing criminal cases, implementing efforts to fight famine and natural calamity, and occasionally supervising market affairs or public works.<ref name=\"fairbank 104 105\">Fairbank, 104\u2013105.</ref> Since the growth of China's population far outmatched the total number of officials accepted as administrators in the Song government, educated gentry who had not been appointed to an official post were entrusted as supervisors of affairs in rural communities.<ref name=\"fairbank 106\">Fairbank, 106.</ref> It was the \"upper gentry\" of high-grade officials in the capital\u2014comprising mostly those who passed the palace exams\u2014who were in a position to influence and reform society.<ref name=\"fairbank 102 103\">Fairbank, 102\u2013103.</ref>\n\n===Political partisanship and reform===\n[[File:Shenzong of Song.jpg|alt=A portrait oriented scroll depicting a man with a pointy beard and mustache in thick red robes, black pointed shoes, and a square cut, black hat with long, thin protrusions coming out horizontally from the bottom of the hat, sitting on a throne.|thumb|right|200px|[[Emperor Shenzong of Song]], the political ally of Wang Anshi who endorsed Wang's reform effort in the economy, military, education system, and social order.]]\nThe high echelons of the political scene during the Song dynasty left a notorious legacy of partisanship and strife among factions of state ministers. The careers of low-grade and middle-grade officials were largely secure; in the high ranks of the central administration, \"reverses of fortune were to be feared,\" as [[Sinology|Sinologist]] historian Jacques Gernet put it.<ref name=\"gernet 65\"/> The Chancellor [[Fan Zhongyan]] (989\u20131052) introduced [[Qingli Reforms|a series of reforms]] between 1043 and 1045 that received heated backlash from the conservative element at court. Fan set out to erase corruption from the recruitment system by providing higher salaries for minor officials, in order to persuade them not to become corrupt and take bribes.<ref name=\"ebrey 163\"/> He also established sponsorship programs that would ensure officials were drafted on their merits, administrative skills, and moral character more than their [[etiquette]] and cultured appearance.<ref name=\"ebrey 163\">Ebrey et al., ''East Asia'', 163.</ref>  However, the conservatives at court did not want their career paths and comfortable positions jeopardized by new standards, so they rallied to successfully halt the reforms.<ref name=\"ebrey 163\"/>\n\nInspired by Fan, the later Chancellor [[Wang Anshi]] (1021\u20131086) implemented a series of reforms in 1069 upon his ascendance to office. Wang promulgated a community-based law enforcement and civil order known as the [[Baojia system]]. Wang Anshi attempted to diminish the importance of landholding and private wealth in favor of mutual-responsibility social groups that shared similar values and could be easily controlled by the government.<ref name=\"fairbank 97\">Fairbank, 97.</ref> Just as scholar-officials owed their social prestige to their government degrees, Wang wanted to structure all of society as a mass of dependents loyal to the central government.<ref name=\"fairbank 97\"/> He used various means, including the prohibition of landlords offering loans to tenants; this role was assumed by the government.<ref name=\"fairbank 97\"/> Wang established local [[militia]]s that could aid the official standing army and lessen the constrained state budget expenses for the military.<ref name=\"ebrey 164\">Ebrey et al., ''East Asia'', 164.</ref>  He set up low-cost loans for the benefit of rural farmers, whom he viewed as the backbone of the Song economy.<ref name=\"ebrey 164\"/>  Since the land tax exacted from rural farmers filled the state treasury's coffers, Wang implemented a reform to update the land-survey system so that more accurate assessments could be gathered.<ref name=\"ebrey 164\"/>  Wang removed the mandatory poetry requirement in the civil service exams, on the grounds that many otherwise skilled and knowledgeable Confucian students were being denied entry into the administration.<ref name=\"ebrey 164\"/>  Wang also established government monopolies for tea, salt, and wine production.<ref name=\"ebrey 164\"/> All of these programs received heavy criticism from conservative ministerial peers, who believed his reforms damaged local family wealth which provided the basis for the production of examination candidates, managers, merchants, landlords, and other essential members of society.<ref name=\"fairbank 97\"/> Historian Paul J. Smith writes that Wang's reforms\u2014the New Policies\u2014represented the professional bureaucratic elite's final attempt to bring the thriving economy under state control to remedy the lack of state resources in combating powerful enemies to the north\u2014the [[Liao dynasty|Liao]] and [[Western Xia]].<ref name=\"smith 76 78\">Smith 76\u201378.</ref>\n\n[[File:Wang Anshi.jpg|alt=A head-shot style painting of a middle aged to late middle aged man with pointed eyebrows, sideburns, a mustache, and a beard.

Lo argues that Wang's obstinate behavior and inability to consider revision or annulment of his reforms stemmed from his conviction that he was a latter-day sage.<ref name=\"lo 45 46\">Lo, 45\u201346.</ref> Confucian scholars of the Song believed that the 'way' (''[[Tao|dao]]'') embodied in the [[Five Classics]] was known by the ancient sages and was transmitted from one sage to another in an almost [[Telepathy|telepathic manner]], but after it reached [[Mencius]] (c. 372\u2013c. 289 BC) there was no one worthy of accepting the transference of the ''dao''.<ref name=\"lo 45\">Lo, 45.</ref> Some believed that the long dormant ''dao'' could be revived if one were truly a sage; Lo writes of Song Neo-Confucianists, \"it is this self-image which explained their militant stand in relation to conventional ethics and scholarship.\"<ref name=\"lo 45\"/> Wang defined his life mission as restoring the unity of ''dao'', as he believed it had not departed from the world but had become fragmented by schools of Confucian thought, each one propagating only half-truths.<ref name=\"lo 46\"/> Lo asserts that Wang, believing that he was in possession of the ''dao'', followed [[Yi Zhi]] and the [[Duke of Zhou]]'s classic examples in resisting the wishes of selfish or foolish men by ignoring criticism and public opinion.<ref name=\"lo 46\">Lo, 46.</ref> If unflinching certitude in his sagehood and faultless reforms was not enough, Wang sought potential allies and formed a coalition that became known as the [[History of the Song dynasty#Partisans and factions, reformers and conservatives|New Policies Group]], which in turn emboldened his known political rivals to band together in opposition to him.<ref name=\"sivin iii 3 4\">Sivin, III, 3\u20134.</ref> Yet factional power struggles were not steeped in ideological discourse alone; cliques had formed naturally with shifting alliances of professional elite lineages and efforts to obtain a greater share of available offices for one's immediate and extended kinship over vying competitors.<ref name=\"hartwell 421\">Hartwell, 421.</ref> People such as Su Shi also opposed Wang's faction on practical grounds; for example, Su's critical poem hinting that Wang's salt monopoly hindered effective salt distribution.<ref name=\"ebrey 164\"/>\n\nWang resigned in 1076 and his leaderless faction faced uncertainty with the death of its patron emperor in 1085. The political faction led by the historian and official [[Sima Guang]] (1019\u20131086) then took control of the central government, allied with the [[empress dowager|dowager empress]] who acted as [[regent]] over the young [[Emperor Zhezong of Song]] (r. 1085\u20131100). Wang's new policies were completely reversed, including popular reforms like the tax substitution for [[corv\u00e9e]] labor service.<ref name=\"ebrey 164\"/>  When Emperor Zhezong came of age and replaced his grandmother as the state power, he favored Wang's policies and once again instituted the reforms in 1093.<ref name=\"ebrey 165\">Ebrey et al., ''East Asia'', 165.</ref><ref name=\"liu 220\">Liu, 220.</ref> The reform party was favored during the [[Emperor Huizong of Song|reign of Huizong]] (r. 1100\u20131125) while conservatives were persecuted\u2014especially during the chancellery of [[Cai Jing]] (1047\u20131126).<ref name=\"liu 220\"/>  As each political faction gained advantage over the other, ministers of the opposing side were labeled \"obstructionist\" and were sent out of the capital to govern remote frontier regions of the empire. This form of political exile was not only politically damaging, but could also be physically threatening.

During the Song dynasty, the entire Chinese society was theoretically modelled upon this familial social order of superiors and inferiors.<ref name=\"gernet 144 145\"/> Confucian dogma dictated what was proper moral behavior, and how a superior should regulate rewards or punishments when dealing with an inferior member of society or one's family.<ref name=\"gernet 144 145\">Gernet, 144\u2013145</ref> This is exemplified in the Tang law code, which was largely retained in the Song period.<ref name=\"gernet 145\">Gernet, 145.</ref> Gernet writes: \"The family relationships supposed to exist in the ideal family were the foundation of the entire moral outlook, and even the law, in its total structure and its scale of penalties, was nothing but a codified expression of them.\"<ref name=\"gernet 145\"/>\n\nUnder the [[Tang Code|Tang law code]] compiled in the 7th century, severe punishments were outlined for those who disobeyed or disrespected the hierarchical system of elders. Those who assaulted their parents could be put to death, those who assaulted an older brother could be put to forced labor, and those who assaulted an older cousin could be sentenced to caning.<ref name=\"gernet 145\"/> A household servant who killed his master could be sentenced to death, while a master who killed his servant would be arrested and forced into a year of hard labor for the state.<ref name=\"gernet 145\"/> Yet this reverence for elders and superiors was grounded in more than just [[secular]] Confucian discourse; Chinese beliefs of [[ancestor worship]] transformed the identity of one's parents into abstract, otherworldly figures.<ref name=\"gernet 145\"/> Song society was also built on social relationships governed not by abstract principles, but on the protection gained by devoting oneself to a superior.<ref name=\"gernet 146\">Gernet, 146.</ref>\n\nPerpetuating the family cult with many descendants was coupled with the notion that producing more children offered the family a layer of protection, reinforcing its power in the community.<ref name=\"gernet 147\">Gernet, 147.</ref> More children meant better odds of extending a family's power through marriage alliance with other prominent families, as well as better odds of having a child occupying a prestigious administrative post in government.<ref name=\"gernet 147 148\">Gernet, 147\u2013148.</ref> Hymes notes that \"elite families used such standards as official standing or wealth, prospects for office, length of pedigree, scholarly renown, and local reputation in choosing both sons-in-law and daughters-in-law.\"<ref name=\"hymes 86\">Hymes, 86.</ref> Since official promotion was considered by examination degree as well as recommendation to office by a superior, a family that acquired a significant amount of sons-in-law of high rank in the bureaucracy ensured kinship protection and prestigious career options for its members.<ref name=\"hymes 115 116\">Hymes, 115\u2013116.</ref> Those who came from noteworthy families were treated with dignity, and a wider family influence meant a better chance for an individual to secure his own fortunes.<ref name=\"gernet 146\"/> No one was better prepared for society than one who gained plenty of experience in dealing with the members of his extended family, as it was common for upper-class families to have several generations living in the same household.<ref name=\"gernet 144 146\">Gernet, 144\u2013146.</ref> However, one did not even have to share the same bloodline with others in order to build more social ties in their community.

Daoism developed largely from the teachings of the ''[[Tao Te Ching|Daodejing]]'', attributed to the 6th century BC philosopher [[Laozi]] (\"Old Master\"), considered one of the [[Three Pure Ones]] (the prime deities of Daoism). Buddhism in China, introduced by [[Yuezhi]], [[An Shih Kao|Persian]], and [[Kushan]] missionaries in the first and second centuries, gradually became more native in character and was transformed into distinct [[Chinese Buddhism]].\n\nMany followed the teachings of Buddha and prominent monks such as [[Dahui Zonggao]] (1089\u20131163) and [[Wuzhun Shifan]] (1178\u20131249). However, there were also many critics of Buddhism's religious and philosophical tenets. This included the ardent nativist, scholar, and statesman Ouyang Xiu, who called Buddhism a \"curse\" upon China, an alien tradition that infiltrated the native beliefs of his country while at its weakest during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] (420\u2013581).<ref name=\"wright 88\">Wright, 88.</ref> The contention over Buddhism was at times a divisive issue within the gentry class and even within families. For example, the historian Zeng Gong lamented over the success of Buddhism, viewing it as a competing ideology with 'the Way of the Sages' of Confucianism, yet on his death in 1083 was buried in a Buddhist temple that his grandfather had helped build and that his brother Zeng Bu was able to declare as a private Merit [[Cloister]] for the family.<ref name=\"hymes 179\">Hymes, 179.</ref> Although conservative proponents of native Confucianism were highly skeptical of the teachings of Buddhism and often sought to distance themselves from it, others used Buddhist teachings to bolster their own Confucian philosophy. The Neo-Confucian philosophers and brothers Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi of the 11th century sought philosophical explanations for the workings of principle (li) and vital energy ([[qi]]) in nature, responding to the notions of highly complex [[metaphysic]]s in popular Buddhist thought.<ref name=\"ebrey 168\">Ebrey et al., ''East Asia'', 168.</ref>  Neo-Confucian scholars also sought to borrow the [[Mahayana]] Buddhist ideal of self-sacrifice, welfare, and charity embodied in the [[bodhisattva]].<ref name=\"wright 93\">Wright, 93.</ref>  Seeking to replace the Buddhist monastery's once prominent role in societal welfare and charity, supporters of Neo-Confucianism converted this ideal into practical measures of state-sponsored support for the poor under a secular mission of ethical [[universalism]].<ref name=\"wright 93 94\">Wright, 93\u201394.</ref>\n\nBuddhism never fully recovered after [[Four Buddhist Persecutions in China|several major persecutions in China]] from the 5th through the 10th centuries, although Daoism continued to thrive in Song China. In northern China under the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] after 1127, the Daoist philosopher [[Wang Chongyang]] (1113\u20131170) established the [[Quanzhen School]]. Wang's seven disciples, known as the Seven Immortals, gained great fame throughout China. They included the prominent Daoist priestess [[Sun Bu'er]] (c. 1119\u20131182), who became a female role model in Daoism. There was also [[Qiu Chuji]] (1148\u20131227), who founded his own Quanzhen Daoist branch known as Longmen (\"Dragon Gate\"). In the Southern Song, cult centers of Daoism became popular at mountain sites that were reputed to be the earthly sojourns of Daoist deities; elite families had shrines erected in these mountain retreats in honor of the local deity thought to reside therein.<ref name=\"hymes 181\">Hymes, 181.</ref> Much more so than for Buddhist clergy, Daoist priests and holy men were sought when one prayed for having a son, when one was physically ill, or when there was need for change after a long spell of bad weather and poor harvest.<ref name=\"hymes 182\">Hymes, 182.</ref>\n\n[[Chinese folk religion]] continued as a tradition in China, drawing upon aspects of both ancient [[Chinese mythology]] and ancestor worship. Many people believed that spirits and deities of the spirit realm regularly interacted with the realm of the living. This subject was popular in Song literature. Hong Mai (1123\u20131202), a prominent member of an official family from [[Jiangxi]], wrote a popular book called ''The Record of the Listener'', which had many anecdotes dealing with the spirit realm and people's supposed interactions with it.<ref name=\"ebrey 172\">Ebrey et al., ''East Asia'', 172.</ref>  People in Song China believed that many of their daily misfortunes and blessings were caused by an array of different deities and spirits who interfered with their daily lives.<ref name=\"ebrey 172\"/>  These deities included the nationally accepted deities of Buddhism and Daoism, as well as the local deities and demons from specific geographic locations.<ref name=\"ebrey 172\"/>  If one displeased a long-dead relative, the dissatisfied ancestor would allegedly inflict natural ailments and illnesses.<ref name=\"ebrey 172\"/> People also believed in mischievous demons and malevolent spirits who had the capability to extort sacrificial offerings meant for ancestors \u2013 in essence these were bullies of the spiritual realm.<ref name=\"ebrey 172\"/>  The Chinese believed that spirits and deities had the same emotions and drives as the living did.<ref name=\"ebrey 172 174\"/>  In some cases the chief deity of a local town or city was believed to act as a municipal official who could receive and dispatch orders on how to punish or reward spirits.<ref name=\"ebrey 172 174\">Ebrey et al., ''East Asia'', 172\u2013174.</ref>  Residents of cities offered many sacrifices to their divinities in hopes that their city would be spared from disasters such as fire.<ref name=\"gernet 38\">Gernet, 38.</ref> However, not only common people felt the need to appease local deities.

There is not a single necessity of our clothing or food that is not the product of the fields of these old rustics. The men plow and the women weave. Their toil is extremely wearisome, yet what they gain from it is negligible, while manifold interest returns to these lazy idlers. This sort, in tens and hundreds, come together to form gangs. When the villagers come to sell things in the market place, before the goods have even left their hands, this crowd of idlers arrives and attacks them, assaulting them as a group. These idlers call this \"the boxing of the community family.\" They are not at all afraid to act outrageously. I have myself seen that it is like this. Have they not given thought to the foodstuffs they require and the clothing they wear? Is it produced by these people of the marketplaces? Or is it produced by the rural farmers? When they recognize that these goods are produced by the farming people or the rural villages, how can they look at them in anger? How can they bully and insult them? Now, Pan Fifty-two and Li Seven are both fishmongers, but Pan lives in the city and fishmongering is his source of livelihood. Li Seven is a farmer, who does fishmongering between busy times. Pan Fifty-two at the end of the year has his profit, without having had the labor of raising the fish, but simply earning it from the selling of the fish. He hated Li and fought with him at the fish market. His lack of humanity is extreme! Li Seven is a village rustic. How could he fight with the itinerant armed loiterers who hang around the marketplace? Although no injuries resulted from the fight, we still must mete out some slight punishments. Pan Fifty-two is to be beaten fifteen blows with the heavy rod. In addition, Li Seven, although he is a village farmer, was still verbally abusive while the two men were stubbornly arguing. He clearly is not a man of simple and pure character. He must have done something to provoke this dispute.

At the beginning of the 12th century, Song generals collected funds based on the number of troops they recorded; instead of using the funds to benefit troops, they used this money to bolster their own salaries.<ref name=\"lorge 41\">Lorge, 41.</ref>  Troops of the standing army, meanwhile, were given very small salaries while assigned tasks of menial labor.<ref name=\"graff 26\">Graff, 26.</ref>  The scholar-officials running the government often paid little attention to the plight of soldiers and even to the demands of officers, since they were seen as being on a lower tier in society.<ref name=\"graff 25 26\">Graff, 25\u201326</ref> Fairbank writes that the \"civilian domination of the military was part of the ruling elite's control of the state, but it left the state military weak.\"<ref name=\"fairbank 109\"/>\n\nThe corruption of the high command and ineffectiveness of military strength was soon revealed once the Song made a joint effort with the [[Jurchen people]] to conquer the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao dynasty]] (916\u20131125). After the successful rebellion of the Jurchens against their Khitan masters, the Jurchen observed the weakness of the Song army and broke their pact, then [[Jin-Song Wars|attacked the Song]] as well. By 1127, the capital at Kaifeng was captured and northern China overrun, while the remnants of the Song court fled south to Hangzhou and established the Southern Song. This was a crucial blow to the Song military elites, as they had been closely tied to the political structure until 1127; afterwards they became alienated from the emperor and the Song court.<ref name=\"lorge 44\">Lorge, 44.</ref> Although they had lost northern China to the new Jurchen [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] (1115\u20131234), this loss prompted the Song to make drastic and lasting military reforms. Emperor Gaozong, desperate to refill the decimated ranks of the central army, drafted men from all over the country.<ref name=\"lorge 42\"/> This had been done before, but not on the same scale. In the tenth and eleventh centuries only the most skilled soldiers became imperial guardsmen, while under Gaozong entire central army units were composed of soldiers from every region and background.<ref name=\"lorge 42\">Lorge, 42.</ref> The Southern Song eventually recovered their strength and commanded the loyalty of vaunted commanders such as [[Yue Fei]] (1103\u20131142), who successfully defended the border at the [[Huai River]]. The Jurchens and Song eventually signed a peace treaty in 1141.<ref name=\"lorge 41\"/>\n\nIn 1131, the Chinese writer Zhang Yi noted the importance of employing a navy to fight the Jin, writing that China had to regard the sea and the river as her [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], and use warships as its greatest watchtowers.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 3 476\"/> Although [[Naval history of China|navies]] had been used in China since the ancient [[Spring and Autumn period]] (722\u2013481 BC),<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 3 678\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 678</ref> China's first permanent standing navy was established by the Southern Song in 1132.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 3 476\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 476.</ref>  The Jurchen launched an invasion against the Southern Song along the length of the [[Yangtze River]], which resulted in two crucial Song victories at the [[Battle of Caishi]] and [[Battle of Tangdao]] in 1161.

AD 1181\u20131186; although [[Buddhism]] was in decline and under attack by [[Neo-Confucian]] critics in the Song era, it nonetheless remained one of the major religious ideologies in China.]]\n\n[[China|Chinese]] society during the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131279) was marked by political and legal reforms, a philosophical revival of [[Confucianism]], and the development of cities beyond administrative purposes into centers of trade, industry, and [[Maritime history|maritime]] commerce. The inhabitants of rural areas were mostly farmers, although some were also hunters, fishers, or government employees working in mines or the salt marshes. Conversely, shopkeepers, artisans, city guards, entertainers, laborers, and wealthy merchants lived in the county and provincial centers along with the [[Gentry (China)|Chinese gentry]]\u2014a small, elite community of educated scholars and [[Scholar-bureaucrats|scholar-officials]].\n\nAs landholders and drafted government officials, the gentry considered themselves the leading members of society; gaining their cooperation and employment was essential for the county or provincial bureaucrat overburdened with official duties. In many ways, scholar-officials of the Song period differed from the more aristocratic scholar-officials of the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907). [[Imperial examinations|Civil service examinations]] became the primary means of appointment to an official post as competitors vying for official degrees dramatically increased. Frequent disagreements amongst ministers of state on ideological and policy issues led to political strife and the rise of political factions. This undermined the marriage strategies of the professional elite, which broke apart as a social group and gave way to a multitude of families which provided sons for [[civil service]].\n\nConfucian or [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]] scholars in ancient China\u2014perhaps as far back as the late [[Zhou dynasty]] (c. 1046\u2013256 BC)\u2014categorized all socio-economic groups into [[Four occupations|four broad and hierarchical occupations]] (in descending order): the ''[[wiktionary:\u58eb|shi]]'' (scholars, or gentry), the ''[[wiktionary:\u519c|nong]]'' (peasant farmers), the ''[[wiktionary:\u5de5|gong]]'' (artisans and craftsmen), and the ''[[wiktionary:\u5546|shang]]'' (merchants).<ref name=\"fairbank 108\">Fairbank, 108.</ref> Wealthy landholders and officials possessed the resources to better prepare their sons for the civil service examinations, yet they were often rivaled in their power and wealth by merchants of the Song period. Merchants frequently colluded commercially and politically with officials, despite the fact that scholar-officials looked down on mercantile vocations as less respectable pursuits than farming or craftsmanship. The military also provided a means for advancement in Song society for those who became officers, even though soldiers were not highly respected members of society. Although certain domestic and familial duties were expected of women in Song society, they nonetheless enjoyed a wide range of social and legal rights in an otherwise [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] society. Women's improved rights to property came gradually with the increasing value of [[dowry|dowries]] offered by brides' families.\n\n[[Taoism|Daoism]] and [[Buddhism]] were the dominant religions of China in the Song era, the latter deeply affecting many beliefs and principles of [[Neo-Confucianism]] throughout the dynasty. Ironically, Buddhism came under heavy criticism by staunch Confucian advocates and philosophers of the time. Older beliefs in ancient [[Chinese mythology]], [[Chinese folk religion|folk religion]], and [[ancestor worship]] also played a large part in people's daily lives, as the Chinese believed that deities and ghosts of the spiritual realm frequently interacted with the living realm.\n\nThe Song justice system was maintained by policing sheriffs, investigators, official coroners, and exam-drafted officials who became [[County magistrate (China)|county magistrate]]s. Song magistrates were encouraged to apply both their practical knowledge as well as the written law in making judicial decisions that would promote societal morality. Advancements in early [[forensic science]], a greater emphasis on gathering credible evidence, and careful recording by clerks of autopsy reports and witness testimonies aided authorities in convicting criminals.\n\n==Urban life==\n\n===Urban growth and management===\n{{Further|Urbanization in China}}\n[[File:Kaifeng in Northern Song.jpg|300px|thumb|Map of Bianliang, the capital city of Northern Song Dynasty]]\n[[File:Qingming Festival 3.jpg|alt=A long, landscape oriented segment of scroll depicting throngs of people, mainly men, crossing a bridge over a large river.

Long Yanyao, patriarch of the Long family, submitted to Song rule in 967 with the guarantee that he could rule Nanning as his personal property, to be passed down through his family without Song interference. In return the Long family was required to present tribute to the Song court. The other families were also offered the same conditions, which they accepted. Although they were included among the official prefectures of the Song dynasty, in practice, these families and their estates constituted independent hereditary kingdoms within the Song realm.{{sfn|Cosmo|2003|p=251}}\n\nIn 975, [[Emperor Taizong of Song]] ordered Song Jingyang and Long Hantang to attack the [[Mu'ege]] kingdom and drive them back across the [[Wu River (Yangtze tributary)|Yachi River]]. Whatever territory they seized they were allowed to keep. After a year of fighting, they succeeded in the endeavor.{{sfn|Cosmo|2003|p=252}}\n\n===Official careers===\nAfter the tumultuous [[An Lushan Rebellion]] (755\u2013763), the early Tang career path of officials rising in a [[Three Departments and Six Ministries|hierarchy of six ministries]]\u2014with Works given the lowest status and Personnel the highest\u2014was changed into a system where officials chose specialized careers within one of the six ministries.<ref name=\"hartwell 399 400\">Hartwell, 399\u2013400.</ref> The commissions of Salt and Iron, Funds, and Census that were created to deal with immediate financial crisis after An Lushan's insurrection were the influential basis for this change in career paths that became focused within functionally distinct hierarchies.<ref name=\"hartwell 399 400\"/> The varied career backgrounds and expertise of early Northern Song officials meant that they were to be given specific assignment to work in only one of the ministries: Personnel, Revenue, Rites, War, Justice, or Works.<ref name=\"hartwell 400\">Hartwell, 400.</ref> As China's population increased and regional economies became more complex the central government could no longer handle the separate parts of the empire efficiently. As a result of this, in 1082 the reorganization of the central bureaucracy scrapped the hierarchies of commissions in favor of the early Tang model of officials advancing through a hierarchy of ministries, each with different levels of prestige.<ref name=\"hartwell 400\"/>\n\n[[File:Ma Yuan Walking on Path in Spring.jpg|alt=A landscape oriented painting depicting a man in white robes standing on an unpaved path staring at the sky.|thumb|right|220px|[[Walking on a Mountain Path in Spring|An official strolling on a path in spring]], by [[Ma Yuan (painter)|Ma Yuan]] (c. 1160\u20131225).]]\nIn observing a multitude of biographies and funerary inscriptions, Hymes states that officials in the Northern Song era displayed a primary preoccupation with national interests, as they did not intervene in local or central government affairs for the benefit of their local prefecture or county.<ref name=\"hymes 128\">Hymes, 128.</ref> This trend was reversed in the Southern Song. Since the majority of central government officials in the Southern Song came from the macroregion of Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Fujian, Hartwell and Hymes state that there was a great amount of ad hoc local interests represented in central government policies.<ref name=\"hartwell 400 404\"/><ref name=\"hymes 128\"/>\n\n[[County magistrate (China)|Lower-grade officials on the county and prefectural levels]] performed the necessary duties of administration such as collecting taxes, overseeing criminal cases, implementing efforts to fight famine and natural calamity, and occasionally supervising market affairs or public works.<ref name=\"fairbank 104 105\">Fairbank, 104\u2013105.</ref> Since the growth of China's population far outmatched the total number of officials accepted as administrators in the Song government, educated gentry who had not been appointed to an official post were entrusted as supervisors of affairs in rural communities.<ref name=\"fairbank 106\">Fairbank, 106.</ref> It was the \"upper gentry\" of high-grade officials in the capital\u2014comprising mostly those who passed the palace exams\u2014who were in a position to influence and reform society.<ref name=\"fairbank 102 103\">Fairbank, 102\u2013103.</ref>\n\n===Political partisanship and reform===\n[[File:Shenzong of Song.jpg|alt=A portrait oriented scroll depicting a man with a pointy beard and mustache in thick red robes, black pointed shoes, and a square cut, black hat with long, thin protrusions coming out horizontally from the bottom of the hat, sitting on a throne.|thumb|right|200px|[[Emperor Shenzong of Song]], the political ally of Wang Anshi who endorsed Wang's reform effort in the economy, military, education system, and social order.]]\nThe high echelons of the political scene during the Song dynasty left a notorious legacy of partisanship and strife among factions of state ministers. The careers of low-grade and middle-grade officials were largely secure; in the high ranks of the central administration, \"reverses of fortune were to be feared,\" as [[Sinology|Sinologist]] historian Jacques Gernet put it.<ref name=\"gernet 65\"/> The Chancellor [[Fan Zhongyan]] (989\u20131052) introduced [[Qingli Reforms|a series of reforms]] between 1043 and 1045 that received heated backlash from the conservative element at court. Fan set out to erase corruption from the recruitment system by providing higher salaries for minor officials, in order to persuade them not to become corrupt and take bribes.<ref name=\"ebrey 163\"/> He also established sponsorship programs that would ensure officials were drafted on their merits, administrative skills, and moral character more than their [[etiquette]] and cultured appearance.<ref name=\"ebrey 163\">Ebrey et al., ''East Asia'', 163.</ref>  However, the conservatives at court did not want their career paths and comfortable positions jeopardized by new standards, so they rallied to successfully halt the reforms.<ref name=\"ebrey 163\"/>\n\nInspired by Fan, the later Chancellor [[Wang Anshi]] (1021\u20131086) implemented a series of reforms in 1069 upon his ascendance to office. Wang promulgated a community-based law enforcement and civil order known as the [[Baojia system]]. Wang Anshi attempted to diminish the importance of landholding and private wealth in favor of mutual-responsibility social groups that shared similar values and could be easily controlled by the government.<ref name=\"fairbank 97\">Fairbank, 97.</ref> Just as scholar-officials owed their social prestige to their government degrees, Wang wanted to structure all of society as a mass of dependents loyal to the central government.<ref name=\"fairbank 97\"/> He used various means, including the prohibition of landlords offering loans to tenants; this role was assumed by the government.<ref name=\"fairbank 97\"/> Wang established local [[militia]]s that could aid the official standing army and lessen the constrained state budget expenses for the military.<ref name=\"ebrey 164\">Ebrey et al., ''East Asia'', 164.</ref>  He set up low-cost loans for the benefit of rural farmers, whom he viewed as the backbone of the Song economy.<ref name=\"ebrey 164\"/>  Since the land tax exacted from rural farmers filled the state treasury's coffers, Wang implemented a reform to update the land-survey system so that more accurate assessments could be gathered.<ref name=\"ebrey 164\"/>  Wang removed the mandatory poetry requirement in the civil service exams, on the grounds that many otherwise skilled and knowledgeable Confucian students were being denied entry into the administration.<ref name=\"ebrey 164\"/>  Wang also established government monopolies for tea, salt, and wine production.<ref name=\"ebrey 164\"/> All of these programs received heavy criticism from conservative ministerial peers, who believed his reforms damaged local family wealth which provided the basis for the production of examination candidates, managers, merchants, landlords, and other essential members of society.<ref name=\"fairbank 97\"/> Historian Paul J. Smith writes that Wang's reforms\u2014the New Policies\u2014represented the professional bureaucratic elite's final attempt to bring the thriving economy under state control to remedy the lack of state resources in combating powerful enemies to the north\u2014the [[Liao dynasty|Liao]] and [[Western Xia]].<ref name=\"smith 76 78\">Smith 76\u201378.</ref>\n\n[[File:Wang Anshi.jpg|alt=A head-shot style painting of a middle aged to late middle aged man with pointed eyebrows, sideburns, a mustache, and a beard.

Lo argues that Wang's obstinate behavior and inability to consider revision or annulment of his reforms stemmed from his conviction that he was a latter-day sage.<ref name=\"lo 45 46\">Lo, 45\u201346.</ref> Confucian scholars of the Song believed that the 'way' (''[[Tao|dao]]'') embodied in the [[Five Classics]] was known by the ancient sages and was transmitted from one sage to another in an almost [[Telepathy|telepathic manner]], but after it reached [[Mencius]] (c. 372\u2013c. 289 BC) there was no one worthy of accepting the transference of the ''dao''.<ref name=\"lo 45\">Lo, 45.</ref> Some believed that the long dormant ''dao'' could be revived if one were truly a sage; Lo writes of Song Neo-Confucianists, \"it is this self-image which explained their militant stand in relation to conventional ethics and scholarship.\"<ref name=\"lo 45\"/> Wang defined his life mission as restoring the unity of ''dao'', as he believed it had not departed from the world but had become fragmented by schools of Confucian thought, each one propagating only half-truths.<ref name=\"lo 46\"/> Lo asserts that Wang, believing that he was in possession of the ''dao'', followed [[Yi Zhi]] and the [[Duke of Zhou]]'s classic examples in resisting the wishes of selfish or foolish men by ignoring criticism and public opinion.<ref name=\"lo 46\">Lo, 46.</ref> If unflinching certitude in his sagehood and faultless reforms was not enough, Wang sought potential allies and formed a coalition that became known as the [[History of the Song dynasty#Partisans and factions, reformers and conservatives|New Policies Group]], which in turn emboldened his known political rivals to band together in opposition to him.<ref name=\"sivin iii 3 4\">Sivin, III, 3\u20134.</ref> Yet factional power struggles were not steeped in ideological discourse alone; cliques had formed naturally with shifting alliances of professional elite lineages and efforts to obtain a greater share of available offices for one's immediate and extended kinship over vying competitors.<ref name=\"hartwell 421\">Hartwell, 421.</ref> People such as Su Shi also opposed Wang's faction on practical grounds; for example, Su's critical poem hinting that Wang's salt monopoly hindered effective salt distribution.<ref name=\"ebrey 164\"/>\n\nWang resigned in 1076 and his leaderless faction faced uncertainty with the death of its patron emperor in 1085. The political faction led by the historian and official [[Sima Guang]] (1019\u20131086) then took control of the central government, allied with the [[empress dowager|dowager empress]] who acted as [[regent]] over the young [[Emperor Zhezong of Song]] (r. 1085\u20131100). Wang's new policies were completely reversed, including popular reforms like the tax substitution for [[corv\u00e9e]] labor service.<ref name=\"ebrey 164\"/>  When Emperor Zhezong came of age and replaced his grandmother as the state power, he favored Wang's policies and once again instituted the reforms in 1093.<ref name=\"ebrey 165\">Ebrey et al., ''East Asia'', 165.</ref><ref name=\"liu 220\">Liu, 220.</ref> The reform party was favored during the [[Emperor Huizong of Song|reign of Huizong]] (r. 1100\u20131125) while conservatives were persecuted\u2014especially during the chancellery of [[Cai Jing]] (1047\u20131126).<ref name=\"liu 220\"/>  As each political faction gained advantage over the other, ministers of the opposing side were labeled \"obstructionist\" and were sent out of the capital to govern remote frontier regions of the empire. This form of political exile was not only politically damaging, but could also be physically threatening.

During the Song dynasty, the entire Chinese society was theoretically modelled upon this familial social order of superiors and inferiors.<ref name=\"gernet 144 145\"/> Confucian dogma dictated what was proper moral behavior, and how a superior should regulate rewards or punishments when dealing with an inferior member of society or one's family.<ref name=\"gernet 144 145\">Gernet, 144\u2013145</ref> This is exemplified in the Tang law code, which was largely retained in the Song period.<ref name=\"gernet 145\">Gernet, 145.</ref> Gernet writes: \"The family relationships supposed to exist in the ideal family were the foundation of the entire moral outlook, and even the law, in its total structure and its scale of penalties, was nothing but a codified expression of them.\"<ref name=\"gernet 145\"/>\n\nUnder the [[Tang Code|Tang law code]] compiled in the 7th century, severe punishments were outlined for those who disobeyed or disrespected the hierarchical system of elders. Those who assaulted their parents could be put to death, those who assaulted an older brother could be put to forced labor, and those who assaulted an older cousin could be sentenced to caning.<ref name=\"gernet 145\"/> A household servant who killed his master could be sentenced to death, while a master who killed his servant would be arrested and forced into a year of hard labor for the state.<ref name=\"gernet 145\"/> Yet this reverence for elders and superiors was grounded in more than just [[secular]] Confucian discourse; Chinese beliefs of [[ancestor worship]] transformed the identity of one's parents into abstract, otherworldly figures.<ref name=\"gernet 145\"/> Song society was also built on social relationships governed not by abstract principles, but on the protection gained by devoting oneself to a superior.<ref name=\"gernet 146\">Gernet, 146.</ref>\n\nPerpetuating the family cult with many descendants was coupled with the notion that producing more children offered the family a layer of protection, reinforcing its power in the community.<ref name=\"gernet 147\">Gernet, 147.</ref> More children meant better odds of extending a family's power through marriage alliance with other prominent families, as well as better odds of having a child occupying a prestigious administrative post in government.<ref name=\"gernet 147 148\">Gernet, 147\u2013148.</ref> Hymes notes that \"elite families used such standards as official standing or wealth, prospects for office, length of pedigree, scholarly renown, and local reputation in choosing both sons-in-law and daughters-in-law.\"<ref name=\"hymes 86\">Hymes, 86.</ref> Since official promotion was considered by examination degree as well as recommendation to office by a superior, a family that acquired a significant amount of sons-in-law of high rank in the bureaucracy ensured kinship protection and prestigious career options for its members.<ref name=\"hymes 115 116\">Hymes, 115\u2013116.</ref> Those who came from noteworthy families were treated with dignity, and a wider family influence meant a better chance for an individual to secure his own fortunes.<ref name=\"gernet 146\"/> No one was better prepared for society than one who gained plenty of experience in dealing with the members of his extended family, as it was common for upper-class families to have several generations living in the same household.<ref name=\"gernet 144 146\">Gernet, 144\u2013146.</ref> However, one did not even have to share the same bloodline with others in order to build more social ties in their community.

Daoism developed largely from the teachings of the ''[[Tao Te Ching|Daodejing]]'', attributed to the 6th century BC philosopher [[Laozi]] (\"Old Master\"), considered one of the [[Three Pure Ones]] (the prime deities of Daoism). Buddhism in China, introduced by [[Yuezhi]], [[An Shih Kao|Persian]], and [[Kushan]] missionaries in the first and second centuries, gradually became more native in character and was transformed into distinct [[Chinese Buddhism]].\n\nMany followed the teachings of Buddha and prominent monks such as [[Dahui Zonggao]] (1089\u20131163) and [[Wuzhun Shifan]] (1178\u20131249). However, there were also many critics of Buddhism's religious and philosophical tenets. This included the ardent nativist, scholar, and statesman Ouyang Xiu, who called Buddhism a \"curse\" upon China, an alien tradition that infiltrated the native beliefs of his country while at its weakest during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] (420\u2013581).<ref name=\"wright 88\">Wright, 88.</ref> The contention over Buddhism was at times a divisive issue within the gentry class and even within families. For example, the historian Zeng Gong lamented over the success of Buddhism, viewing it as a competing ideology with 'the Way of the Sages' of Confucianism, yet on his death in 1083 was buried in a Buddhist temple that his grandfather had helped build and that his brother Zeng Bu was able to declare as a private Merit [[Cloister]] for the family.<ref name=\"hymes 179\">Hymes, 179.</ref> Although conservative proponents of native Confucianism were highly skeptical of the teachings of Buddhism and often sought to distance themselves from it, others used Buddhist teachings to bolster their own Confucian philosophy. The Neo-Confucian philosophers and brothers Cheng Hao and Cheng Yi of the 11th century sought philosophical explanations for the workings of principle (li) and vital energy ([[qi]]) in nature, responding to the notions of highly complex [[metaphysic]]s in popular Buddhist thought.<ref name=\"ebrey 168\">Ebrey et al., ''East Asia'', 168.</ref>  Neo-Confucian scholars also sought to borrow the [[Mahayana]] Buddhist ideal of self-sacrifice, welfare, and charity embodied in the [[bodhisattva]].<ref name=\"wright 93\">Wright, 93.</ref>  Seeking to replace the Buddhist monastery's once prominent role in societal welfare and charity, supporters of Neo-Confucianism converted this ideal into practical measures of state-sponsored support for the poor under a secular mission of ethical [[universalism]].<ref name=\"wright 93 94\">Wright, 93\u201394.</ref>\n\nBuddhism never fully recovered after [[Four Buddhist Persecutions in China|several major persecutions in China]] from the 5th through the 10th centuries, although Daoism continued to thrive in Song China. In northern China under the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] after 1127, the Daoist philosopher [[Wang Chongyang]] (1113\u20131170) established the [[Quanzhen School]]. Wang's seven disciples, known as the Seven Immortals, gained great fame throughout China. They included the prominent Daoist priestess [[Sun Bu'er]] (c. 1119\u20131182), who became a female role model in Daoism. There was also [[Qiu Chuji]] (1148\u20131227), who founded his own Quanzhen Daoist branch known as Longmen (\"Dragon Gate\"). In the Southern Song, cult centers of Daoism became popular at mountain sites that were reputed to be the earthly sojourns of Daoist deities; elite families had shrines erected in these mountain retreats in honor of the local deity thought to reside therein.<ref name=\"hymes 181\">Hymes, 181.</ref> Much more so than for Buddhist clergy, Daoist priests and holy men were sought when one prayed for having a son, when one was physically ill, or when there was need for change after a long spell of bad weather and poor harvest.<ref name=\"hymes 182\">Hymes, 182.</ref>\n\n[[Chinese folk religion]] continued as a tradition in China, drawing upon aspects of both ancient [[Chinese mythology]] and ancestor worship. Many people believed that spirits and deities of the spirit realm regularly interacted with the realm of the living. This subject was popular in Song literature. Hong Mai (1123\u20131202), a prominent member of an official family from [[Jiangxi]], wrote a popular book called ''The Record of the Listener'', which had many anecdotes dealing with the spirit realm and people's supposed interactions with it.<ref name=\"ebrey 172\">Ebrey et al., ''East Asia'', 172.</ref>  People in Song China believed that many of their daily misfortunes and blessings were caused by an array of different deities and spirits who interfered with their daily lives.<ref name=\"ebrey 172\"/>  These deities included the nationally accepted deities of Buddhism and Daoism, as well as the local deities and demons from specific geographic locations.<ref name=\"ebrey 172\"/>  If one displeased a long-dead relative, the dissatisfied ancestor would allegedly inflict natural ailments and illnesses.<ref name=\"ebrey 172\"/> People also believed in mischievous demons and malevolent spirits who had the capability to extort sacrificial offerings meant for ancestors \u2013 in essence these were bullies of the spiritual realm.<ref name=\"ebrey 172\"/>  The Chinese believed that spirits and deities had the same emotions and drives as the living did.<ref name=\"ebrey 172 174\"/>  In some cases the chief deity of a local town or city was believed to act as a municipal official who could receive and dispatch orders on how to punish or reward spirits.<ref name=\"ebrey 172 174\">Ebrey et al., ''East Asia'', 172\u2013174.</ref>  Residents of cities offered many sacrifices to their divinities in hopes that their city would be spared from disasters such as fire.<ref name=\"gernet 38\">Gernet, 38.</ref> However, not only common people felt the need to appease local deities.

There is not a single necessity of our clothing or food that is not the product of the fields of these old rustics. The men plow and the women weave. Their toil is extremely wearisome, yet what they gain from it is negligible, while manifold interest returns to these lazy idlers. This sort, in tens and hundreds, come together to form gangs. When the villagers come to sell things in the market place, before the goods have even left their hands, this crowd of idlers arrives and attacks them, assaulting them as a group. These idlers call this \"the boxing of the community family.\" They are not at all afraid to act outrageously. I have myself seen that it is like this. Have they not given thought to the foodstuffs they require and the clothing they wear? Is it produced by these people of the marketplaces? Or is it produced by the rural farmers? When they recognize that these goods are produced by the farming people or the rural villages, how can they look at them in anger? How can they bully and insult them? Now, Pan Fifty-two and Li Seven are both fishmongers, but Pan lives in the city and fishmongering is his source of livelihood. Li Seven is a farmer, who does fishmongering between busy times. Pan Fifty-two at the end of the year has his profit, without having had the labor of raising the fish, but simply earning it from the selling of the fish. He hated Li and fought with him at the fish market. His lack of humanity is extreme! Li Seven is a village rustic. How could he fight with the itinerant armed loiterers who hang around the marketplace? Although no injuries resulted from the fight, we still must mete out some slight punishments. Pan Fifty-two is to be beaten fifteen blows with the heavy rod. In addition, Li Seven, although he is a village farmer, was still verbally abusive while the two men were stubbornly arguing. He clearly is not a man of simple and pure character. He must have done something to provoke this dispute.

At the beginning of the 12th century, Song generals collected funds based on the number of troops they recorded; instead of using the funds to benefit troops, they used this money to bolster their own salaries.<ref name=\"lorge 41\">Lorge, 41.</ref>  Troops of the standing army, meanwhile, were given very small salaries while assigned tasks of menial labor.<ref name=\"graff 26\">Graff, 26.</ref>  The scholar-officials running the government often paid little attention to the plight of soldiers and even to the demands of officers, since they were seen as being on a lower tier in society.<ref name=\"graff 25 26\">Graff, 25\u201326</ref> Fairbank writes that the \"civilian domination of the military was part of the ruling elite's control of the state, but it left the state military weak.\"<ref name=\"fairbank 109\"/>\n\nThe corruption of the high command and ineffectiveness of military strength was soon revealed once the Song made a joint effort with the [[Jurchen people]] to conquer the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] [[Liao dynasty]] (916\u20131125). After the successful rebellion of the Jurchens against their Khitan masters, the Jurchen observed the weakness of the Song army and broke their pact, then [[Jin-Song Wars|attacked the Song]] as well. By 1127, the capital at Kaifeng was captured and northern China overrun, while the remnants of the Song court fled south to Hangzhou and established the Southern Song. This was a crucial blow to the Song military elites, as they had been closely tied to the political structure until 1127; afterwards they became alienated from the emperor and the Song court.<ref name=\"lorge 44\">Lorge, 44.</ref> Although they had lost northern China to the new Jurchen [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] (1115\u20131234), this loss prompted the Song to make drastic and lasting military reforms. Emperor Gaozong, desperate to refill the decimated ranks of the central army, drafted men from all over the country.<ref name=\"lorge 42\"/> This had been done before, but not on the same scale. In the tenth and eleventh centuries only the most skilled soldiers became imperial guardsmen, while under Gaozong entire central army units were composed of soldiers from every region and background.<ref name=\"lorge 42\">Lorge, 42.</ref> The Southern Song eventually recovered their strength and commanded the loyalty of vaunted commanders such as [[Yue Fei]] (1103\u20131142), who successfully defended the border at the [[Huai River]]. The Jurchens and Song eventually signed a peace treaty in 1141.<ref name=\"lorge 41\"/>\n\nIn 1131, the Chinese writer Zhang Yi noted the importance of employing a navy to fight the Jin, writing that China had to regard the sea and the river as her [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], and use warships as its greatest watchtowers.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 3 476\"/> Although [[Naval history of China|navies]] had been used in China since the ancient [[Spring and Autumn period]] (722\u2013481 BC),<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 3 678\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 678</ref> China's first permanent standing navy was established by the Southern Song in 1132.<ref name=\"needham volume 4 part 3 476\">Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 476.</ref>  The Jurchen launched an invasion against the Southern Song along the length of the [[Yangtze River]], which resulted in two crucial Song victories at the [[Battle of Caishi]] and [[Battle of Tangdao]] in 1161.

He was on the [[Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Duke of Newcastle]]\u2019s \"list of persons to be brought into Parliament\" on 9 June 1760, having been mentioned to him by the [[Duke of Grafton]], at the request of Mr Croftes, and by Mr Page at the request of Mrs Croftes.
