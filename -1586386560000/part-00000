The show premiered on February 17, 2014, and is produced by [[Broadway Video]] and [[Universal Television]]. It is the seventh (and current) incarnation of NBC's long-running [[The Tonight Show|''Tonight Show'' franchise]], with Fallon serving as the sixth host. The show also stars sidekick and announcer [[Steve Higgins]] and house band [[The Roots]]. ''The Tonight Show'' is produced by Katie Hockmeyer and executive-produced by [[Lorne Michaels]]. The show records from [[NBC Studios (New York City)|Studio 6B]] in [[Rockefeller Center]], [[New York City]], which is the same studio in which ''[[Tonight Starring Jack Paar]]'' and then ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' were produced from 1957 until 1972.\n\nThe program airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET/PT. The show opens with Fallon's topical monologue, then transitions into comedic sketches/games, concluding with guest interviews and musical performance. ''The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon'' attracted high ratings from its 2014 premiere. Many moments from the show have generated [[viral video]]s. The show has been nominated for nine [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, winning two.\n\nOn August 13, 2015, NBC announced that Fallon signed a contract to remain as host until at least 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/08/13/nbc-extends-tonight-show-host-jimmy-fallons-deal-through-2021/447713/|title=NBC Extends 'Tonight Show' Host Jimmy Fallon's Deal through 2021|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|work=TV by the Numbers|date=August 13, 2015|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}</ref>\nOn March 12, 2020, following an audience-less broadcast of the show, NBC announced suspension of the show's taping until a planned date of March 30, in response to the ongoing [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19 outbreak]].<ref>{{cite web |title=An important message for our fans. |url=https://twitter.com/FallonTonight/status/1238276798405894145?s=20 |website=twitter.com |accessdate=March 14, 2020}}</ref> However, the following week, the show partially returned as a shortened 20-minute version, titled \"The Tonight Show: At Home Edition\". The episodes are recorded from his house, usually starring members of Fallon's family, and guest interviews are conducted via FaceTime.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== History ===\n''[[The Tonight Show]]'' premiered on NBC in 1954 as ''Tonight'', hosted by [[Steve Allen]]. [[Jack Paar]] hosted the show from 1957 to 1962, but the show's longest-running and most famous host was [[Johnny Carson]], who hosted the show for three decades and received six Emmys. Following Carson's 1992 retirement, \"vast quantities of brainpower, money, and column inches were devoted to the issue of who was truly best suited to carry the franchise forward.\"<ref name=\"VF\" /> NBC chose interim guest host [[Jay Leno]], who took over the show that year.\n\nA pair of conflicts ensued over Leno's 22-year tenure, both revolving around the then-current hosts of ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'', the program directly following ''Tonight'' since its premiere in 1982. Original ''Late Night'' host [[David Letterman]] was considered Carson's top choice as successor and left the network acrimoniously in 1993 after Leno was given the job. Years later, NBC attempted to transit Letterman's ''Late Night'' successor, [[Conan O'Brien]] to in turn succeed Leno as host of ''Tonight'' in 2009. However, as a result of various contractual obligations and fears of losing performers to other networks, Leno was given a [[The Jay Leno Show|nightly prime-time show]] shortly after Conan's run began. Leno posted less than stellar ratings, leading to a [[domino effect]] on the late local news. O'Brien's ''Tonight'' also suffered falling ratings leading to a [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|public controversy]] that resulted in O'Brien leaving the network the following year, and Leno returning to host ''The Tonight Show''.\n[[File:Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon Intertitle.png|thumb|left|Show title, used since summer 2015 when the [[NBC peacock]] replaced the [[General Electric|GE]] sign on the Comcast Building]]\n\n[[Jimmy Fallon]], a former cast member from 1998-2004 on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' , was appointed as the third host of ''Late Night'' by executive producer [[Lorne Michaels]] in 2009 when O'Brien moved to ''Tonight'' (only for a little over a year).

Fallon's edition places less emphasis on his opening monologue, a feature which was a staple of the Leno edition. In his opening episode, in which he described what the format of the show would be, he only briefly mentioned the monologue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/8130/the-smartest-thing-jimmy-fallon-did-on-his-first-tonight-show/|title=The Smartest Thing Jimmy Fallon Did on His First Tonight Show|first=James|last=Poniewozik}}</ref>\n\nThe show has many recurring segments and games that are played with the various celebrity guests. The most popular of these, \"Lip Sync Battle\", was spun off into [[Lip Sync Battle|its own show]] that premiered on [[Paramount Network|Spike]] (later re-branded as Paramount Network) after being passed on by NBC. Similarly, \"Wheel of Musical Impressions\", another popular segment spawned ''That\u2019s My Jam'', a music and [[Variety show|variety]] [[game show]] set to debut with a 10-episode order during the [[2019-20 United States network television schedule|2019-20 television season]] on NBC.<ref>{{cite web |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |last2=Petski |first2=Denise |title=NBC Orders Jimmy Fallon\u2019s \u2018That\u2019s My Jam\u2019 Music & Variety Game Show Inspired By \u2018Tonight Show\u2019 Segments |url=https://deadline.com/2019/03/nbc-orders-jimmy-fallons-thats-my-jam-music-variety-game-show-inspired-by-tonight-show-segments-1202575109/ |website=Deadline |date=March 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOther segments include playing charades, [[Catchphrase]], [[Pictionary]], or other family style games. \n\nAdditionally, Fallon and celebrity guests regularly appear in sketches parodying pop culture or political events.

The show premiered on February 17, 2014, and is produced by [[Broadway Video]] and [[Universal Television]]. It is the seventh (and current) incarnation of NBC's long-running [[The Tonight Show|''Tonight Show'' franchise]], with Fallon serving as the sixth host. The show also stars sidekick and announcer [[Steve Higgins]] and house band [[The Roots]]. ''The Tonight Show'' is produced by Katie Hockmeyer and executive-produced by [[Lorne Michaels]]. The show records from [[NBC Studios (New York City)|Studio 6B]] in [[Rockefeller Center]], [[New York City]], which is the same studio in which ''[[Tonight Starring Jack Paar]]'' and then ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' were produced from 1957 until 1972.\n\nThe program airs weeknights at 11:35 p.m. ET/PT. The show opens with Fallon's topical monologue, then transitions into comedic sketches/games, concluding with guest interviews and musical performance. ''The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon'' attracted high ratings from its 2014 premiere. Many moments from the show have generated [[viral video]]s. The show has been nominated for nine [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, winning two.\n\nOn August 13, 2015, NBC announced that Fallon signed a contract to remain as host until at least 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/08/13/nbc-extends-tonight-show-host-jimmy-fallons-deal-through-2021/447713/|title=NBC Extends 'Tonight Show' Host Jimmy Fallon's Deal through 2021|last=Kondolojy|first=Amanda|work=TV by the Numbers|date=August 13, 2015|accessdate=August 15, 2015}}</ref>\nOn March 12, 2020, following an audience-less broadcast of the show, NBC announced suspension of the show's taping until a planned date of March 30, in lieu of the ongoing [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19 outbreak]].<ref>{{cite web |title=An important message for our fans. |url=https://twitter.com/FallonTonight/status/1238276798405894145?s=20 |website=twitter.com |accessdate=March 14, 2020}}</ref> However, the following week, the show partially returned as a shortened 20-minute version, titled \"The Tonight Show: At Home Edition\". The episodes are recorded from his house, usually starring members of Fallon's family, and guest interviews are conducted via FaceTime.\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== History ===\n''[[The Tonight Show]]'' premiered on NBC in 1954 as ''Tonight'', hosted by [[Steve Allen]]. [[Jack Paar]] hosted the show from 1957 to 1962, but the show's longest-running and most famous host was [[Johnny Carson]], who hosted the show for three decades and received six Emmys. Following Carson's 1992 retirement, \"vast quantities of brainpower, money, and column inches were devoted to the issue of who was truly best suited to carry the franchise forward.\"<ref name=\"VF\" /> NBC chose interim guest host [[Jay Leno]], who took over the show that year.\n\nA pair of conflicts ensued over Leno's 22-year tenure, both revolving around the then-current hosts of ''[[Late Night (NBC)|Late Night]]'', the program directly following ''Tonight'' since its premiere in 1982. Original ''Late Night'' host [[David Letterman]] was considered Carson's top choice as successor and left the network acrimoniously in 1993 after Leno was given the job. Years later, NBC attempted to transit Letterman's ''Late Night'' successor, [[Conan O'Brien]] to in turn succeed Leno as host of ''Tonight'' in 2009. However, as a result of various contractual obligations and fears of losing performers to other networks, Leno was given a [[The Jay Leno Show|nightly prime-time show]] shortly after Conan's run began. Leno posted less than stellar ratings, leading to a [[domino effect]] on the late local news. O'Brien's ''Tonight'' also suffered falling ratings leading to a [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|public controversy]] that resulted in O'Brien leaving the network the following year, and Leno returning to host ''The Tonight Show''.\n[[File:Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon Intertitle.png|thumb|left|Show title, used since summer 2015 when the [[NBC peacock]] replaced the [[General Electric|GE]] sign on the Comcast Building]]\n\n[[Jimmy Fallon]], a former cast member from 1998-2004 on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' , was appointed as the third host of ''Late Night'' by executive producer [[Lorne Michaels]] in 2009 when O'Brien moved to ''Tonight'' (only for a little over a year).

Fallon's edition places less emphasis on his opening monologue, a feature which was a staple of the Leno edition. In his opening episode, in which he described what the format of the show would be, he only briefly mentioned the monologue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/8130/the-smartest-thing-jimmy-fallon-did-on-his-first-tonight-show/|title=The Smartest Thing Jimmy Fallon Did on His First Tonight Show|first=James|last=Poniewozik}}</ref>\n\nThe show has many recurring segments and games that are played with the various celebrity guests. The most popular of these, \"Lip Sync Battle\", was spun off into [[Lip Sync Battle|its own show]] that premiered on [[Paramount Network|Spike]] (later re-branded as Paramount Network) after being passed on by NBC. Similarly, \"Wheel of Musical Impressions\", another popular segment spawned ''That\u2019s My Jam'', a music and [[Variety show|variety]] [[game show]] set to debut with a 10-episode order during the [[2019-20 United States network television schedule|2019-20 television season]] on NBC.<ref>{{cite web |last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |last2=Petski |first2=Denise |title=NBC Orders Jimmy Fallon\u2019s \u2018That\u2019s My Jam\u2019 Music & Variety Game Show Inspired By \u2018Tonight Show\u2019 Segments |url=https://deadline.com/2019/03/nbc-orders-jimmy-fallons-thats-my-jam-music-variety-game-show-inspired-by-tonight-show-segments-1202575109/ |website=Deadline |date=March 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOther segments include playing charades, [[Catchphrase]], [[Pictionary]], or other family style games. \n\nAdditionally, Fallon and celebrity guests regularly appear in sketches parodying pop culture or political events.

It was held almost annually until 1991 and occasionally was contested in a series.\n\nIn 1985, an annual fixture between Lancashire and Yorkshire was proposed as a replacement for the County Championship which had last been played in 1982\u201383. The fixture became known as the '''Rodstock War of the Roses''', and the first game was played in September 1985. The series lasted until 1991, when it was scrapped due to lack of interest.\n\nThe fixture was revived in 2001 under the name of the '''Origin Series''', inspired by the success of Australia's [[State of Origin series]] between [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] and [[Queensland Maroons|Queensland]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Woods|first1=Dave|title=Origin game evolves|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/1362838.stm|website=BBC Sport Online|accessdate=8 July 2014|date=31 May 2001}}</ref>\n\nPlayer eligibility for the Origin Series was based on the player's region of birth, but players born outside of Yorkshire and Lancashire were also eligible for selection, based on the region where they first played rugby league at professional level.\n\nThe Origin Series was reduced to a one-off Origin Game in 2003 due to the British hosting the touring [[Australian national rugby league team|Australia]], [[New Zealand national rugby league team#New Zealand A|New Zealand A]] and as well the kick off of the [[Rugby League European Nations Cup]]. So together with the Challenge Cup, WCC and Rugby Super League, the [[Rugby Football League]] (RFL) felt that too many Origin matches would be too much strain on the top players. The tournament was then rested due to apathy from rugby league supporters.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe series has in effect been replaced by the [[International Origin]] series, where England take on the \"Exiles\" \u2013 a team composed of the best overseas players in Super League.\n\n==Results==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

It was held almost annually until 1991 and occasionally was contested in a series.\n\nIn 1985, an annual fixture between Lancashire and Yorkshire was proposed as a replacement for the County Championship which had last been played in 1982\u201383. The fixture became known as the '''Rodstock War of the Roses''', and the first game was played in September 1985. The series lasted until 1991, when it was scrapped due to lack of interest.\n\nThe fixture was revived in 2001 under the name of the '''Origin Series''', inspired by the success of Australia's [[State of Origin series]] between [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] and [[Queensland Maroons|Queensland]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Woods|first1=Dave|title=Origin game evolves|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/1362838.stm|website=BBC Sport Online|accessdate=8 July 2014|date=31 May 2001}}</ref>\n\nPlayer eligibility for the Origin Series was based on the player's region of birth, but players born outside of Yorkshire and Lancashire were also eligible for selection, based on the region where they first played rugby league at professional level.\n\nThe Origin Series was reduced to a one-off Origin Game in 2003 due to the British hosting the touring [[Australian national rugby league team|Australia]], [[New Zealand national rugby league team#New Zealand A|New Zealand A]] and as well the kick off of the [[Rugby League European Nations Cup]]. So together with the Challenge Cup, WCC and Rugby Super League, the [[Rugby Football League]] (RFL) felt that too many Origin matches would be too much strain on the top players. The tournament was then rested due to apathy from rugby league supporters.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nThe series has in effect been replaced by the [[International Origin]] series, where England take on the \"Exiles\" \u2013 a team composed of the best overseas players in Super League.\n\n==Results==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

In [[Cantonese cuisine]], it is usually served as a [[dim sum]] snack.<ref name=\"Hsiung\">Hsiung, Deh-Ta. Simonds, Nina. Lowe, Jason. [2005] (2005). The food of China: a journey for food lovers.

However, most people in Western countries associate shumai with only the Cantonese version due to the [[Cantonese]] diaspora.\n\n===Hohhot ''shaomai''===\n[[Hohhot]] shaomai is a regional variety in Hohhot, [[Inner Mongolia]].<ref name=\"name origin\">{{cite web|title=\u70e7\u9ea6\u7684\u540d\u79f0\u7531\u6765|url=http://news.ganji.com/shaomaidemingchengyoulai.htm|publisher=news.ganji.com|accessdate=16 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Suiyuan County Annals\">{{cite book|title=\u7ee5\u8fdc\u901a\u5fd7\u7a3f|year=2010|publisher=\u5185\u8499\u53e4\u4eba\u6c11\u51fa\u7248\u793e|location=Inner Mongolia, China|isbn=9787204090808}}</ref>\n\nThe wrapping is a very thin, round sheet of unleavened dough, with a pleat border.  There is only one kind of filling, which mainly consists of chopped or minced mutton, scallion and ginger. Hohhot shaomai features this extensive use of scallion and ginger, creating a dense combined scent, and a slightly spicy taste. The filling is put in the center of the wrapping and the border of the wrapping is loosely gathered above, forming a \"neck\" and a flower shaped top. It is then cooked by steaming or pan-frying. Hohhot shaomai is served in the unit of [[Chinese units of measurement|\"liang\"]], which means either eight steamed ones served in a steamer tier, or eight fried ones served in a dish. \"Liang\" is equal to 50 grams, being traditionally used as an indication of the total weight of the wrapping. Hohhot shaomai is commonly served with vinegar and tea, due to its greasiness.\n\n=== Cantonese ''siumaai'' ===\n[[File:HK Sheung Wan morning tea Dim Sum \u71d2\u8ce3 Shaomai n Glass bowl Feb-2012.jpg|thumb|\nCantonese ''siumaai''\n]]\nThis is the most well-known variety in the West, which is from the southern provinces of [[Guangdong]] and [[Guangxi]]. As prepared in [[Cantonese cuisine]], ''siumaai'' is also referred to as \"pork and mushroom dumpling.\" Its standard filling consists primarily of [[ground pork]], small whole or chopped shrimp, [[Chinese black mushroom]], [[Scallion|green onion]] (also called scallion) and [[ginger]] with seasonings of Chinese [[rice wine]] (e.g. [[Shaoxing wine|Shaoxing]] rice wine), [[soy sauce]], [[sesame oil]] and chicken stock. [[Bamboo shoot]]s, [[Eleocharis dulcis|water chestnuts]] and pepper can also be added. The outer covering is made of a thin sheet of [[lye]] water dough, which is either yellow or white. The center is usually garnished with an orange dot, made of crab [[roe]] or diced [[carrot]], although a green dot made with a pea may be used. The decorative presentations vary.\n\nA fish paste variety of ''siumaai'' is sold as a popular street food in [[Hong Kong]], usually alongside curry fishballs. It is most often eaten with a sweet soy sauce and chili oil.\n\n===Hunan ''juhua shaomai''===\nCalled the [[chrysanthemum]] shaomai, this variety is made in [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]] province. This shaomai is named for its opening resembling the chrysanthemum flower petal shape. It is spicy with pepper and the wrapper is translucent.

The filling of the northern version consists of mutton or beef, along with [[Scallion|green onion]] and radish, whereas the southern filling primarily uses [[glutinous rice]] with smaller amounts of mutton or beef. Minced meat from sheep ribs containing some fat is ideal.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n===Jiangxi ''Yifeng shaomai''===\nCalled the [[Yifeng]] shaomai in the southeastern [[Jiangxi]] province, this version's distinct flavour comes from a blend of pork mince, bread flour, sesame seed powder, ground pepper and sugar.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} It is particularly popular in the area of Yifeng Tanshan Tianbao where it is one of the foods eaten during the [[Chinese New Year]] celebration.\n\n== Variants from other countries ==\n\n===Japanese ''sh\u016bmai''===\n''Sh\u016bmai'' in [[Japanese Chinese cuisine|Japan]] have shrimp as the main ingredient and neither pork nor beef is used in the dough.

It is served also with steamed potatoes, tofu, hard boiled eggs, steamed [[bitter gourd]] and cabbages, all are sliced and topped with [[peanut sauce]] and ''kecap manis'' (sweet [[soy sauce]]). Because the population of Indonesia is largely [[Muslim]], pork siomay is rare and is usually made from various fish, most commonly [[wahoo]] or [[Euthynnus affinis|mackerel tuna]].

It is commonly steamed, with a popular variant being fried and resulting in a crisp exterior. It is normally dipped in soy sauce with the juice of [[calamansi]], a Philippine lime, and a chili-garlic oil is sometimes added to the sauce.\n\nA recent variant on ''siomai'' is wrapped in sheets of [[Nori|laver]] after the [[wonton]] wrappers, which are marketed as \"Japanese.\"\n\n===Vietnamese ''x\u00edu m\u1ea1i''===\n''X\u00edu m\u1ea1i'' in [[Vietnamese cuisine|Vietnam]] has minced pork, onion, scallion and shredded bread as the main ingredients and is cooked in tomato sauce.

There is only one kind of filling, which mainly consists of chopped or minced mutton, scallion and ginger. Hohhot shaomai features this extensive use of scallion and ginger, creating a dense combined scent, and a slightly spicy taste. The filling is put in the center of the wrapping and the border of the wrapping is loosely gathered above, forming a \"neck\" and a flower shaped top. It is then cooked by steaming or pan-frying. Hohhot shaomai is served in the unit of [[Chinese units of measurement|\"liang\"]], which means either eight steamed ones served in a steamer tier, or eight fried ones served in a dish. \"Liang\" is equal to 50 grams, being traditionally used as an indication of the total weight of the wrapping.

It was released on 3 December 1966 by [[London Records]] in the United States. With its release, the label attempted to fill a marketing gap between the Stones' studio albums and capitalise on their popularity in the US market, which was heightened that year by a notoriously successful [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1966|North American concert tour]] supporting their hit album ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966).\n\nDiscouraged by the fan hysteria accompanying the band in concert at the time, their producer and manager [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] abandoned the original idea of having the album capture the Stones in a single live performance at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Instead, he selected 10 concert recordings from other sources alongside two older studio tracks, which were [[overdubbed]] with crowd noise to give the impression of an entirely live album \u2013 all of the tracks were credited on the original LP to the Royal Albert Hall performance. The album takes it title from the Stones' [[Got Live If You Want It! (EP)|1965 UK-only live EP]], whose own name had been inspired by the 1957 [[Slim Harpo]] recording \"I've Got Love If You Want It\".\n\nThe LP sold well, reaching the number six position on the American [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' albums chart]], although the Stones later disavowed the release. Critics of the album note the poor audibility of the band amid the audience noise, but appreciate its historical and documentary value as well as the intense, high-energy quality of the performances. Rare copies of the LP \u2013 pressed in limited quantities for the European market \u2013 became highly valued by [[record collector]]s. ''Got Live If You Want It!'' has been reissued twice by [[ABKCO Records]], in 1986 on CD and in 2002 on [[Super Audio CD|SACD]].\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Kungliga Tennishallen Stones 1966a.jpg|left|thumb|[[The Rolling Stones]] in 1966]]\nIn 1966, [[the Rolling Stones]]' popularity increased dramatically with the success of their ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' LP and the singles \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?]]\". Coupled with the music's commercial impact, the band's high-energy concerts during [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1966|their North American tour in June and July]] proved highly successful with young people while alienating local police tasked with [[crowd control|controlling]] the often rebellious and physically exhausting crowds. According to the Stones historians Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon, the band's notoriety \"among the authorities and [[the establishment]] seems to have been inversely proportional to their popularity among young people\".<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\nThe Stones' American record distributor, [[London Records]], wanted to capitalise on the Stones' growing popularity by marketing a new album, but were several months behind the scheduled release of their next original album, ''[[Between the Buttons]]'' (1967). A live album release was then planned for the end of 1966.<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\n== Recording and production ==\n{{quote box|quote=\"In the '60s, the Stones didn't play concerts.

Sequenced as the LP's opening track, \"Under My Thumb\" featured a passionate introduction of the group by [[Long John Baldry]], who had sung in [[Alexis Korner]]'s London-based band [[Blues Incorporated]] alongside three members of the Stones in 1962 \u2013 Jagger, rhythm guitarist [[Brian Jones]] and drummer [[Charlie Watts]]. The Stones' concert at [[Colston Hall]] in Bristol on 7 October 1966 produced the recordings of \"[[Lady Jane (song)|Lady Jane]]\", \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\", \"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?\" and \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\". According to Margotin and Guesdon, \"[[Time Is on My Side]]\" and \"I'm Alright\" were performed on 5 March and 7 March 1965 at either Regal Theatre in London, the Palace Theatre in Manchester or the Empire Theatre in Liverpool.<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\nFor the live recordings, the engineer [[Glyn Johns]] used the [[IBC Studios|IBC Mobile Unit]], the technical function of which Margotin and Guesdon say was \"not yet really suited to rock concerts\". Johns captured each show by suspending microphones from the venue's balcony.<ref name=\"Running\"/> [[Keith Richards]], the Stones' lead guitarist, remarked at the time on the difference in being recorded live, \"We all knew that the sound that we were getting live and in the studio was not what we were getting on record \u2013 the difference was light years apart.\"<ref name=\"Havers\"/>\n\nThe first of the album's two studio recordings, \"[[I've Been Loving You Too Long]]\", was cut between 11 May and 12 May 1965 at RCA Studios in Hollywood. The second, \"[[Fortune Teller (song)|Fortune Teller]]\", was taken from a 9 July 1963 session at Decca Studios in West Hampstead. According to the band's bassist [[Bill Wyman]], both studio tracks had \"crowd atmosphere added\", while even the live recordings of \"Lady Jane\", \"I'm Alright\", \"Have You Seen Your Mother\", and \"Satisfaction\" \"all benefited from various amounts of overdubs at Olympic Studios in mid-October\".<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\n== Title and packaging ==\nThe Rolling Stones conceived ''Got Live If You Want It!''{{'}}s name from the song \"I've Got Love If You Want It\", recorded in 1957 by [[Slim Harpo]], one of the band's favourite [[blues]] musicians.<ref name=\"Havers\"/> The name was first used for [[Got Live If You Want It!

The majority of his review focused instead on the moral implications of the Stones performing sleazily, as he described, for an audience presumed to be mostly adolescent and preadolescent girls, leading him to condemn the band on \"[[puritanical]]\" grounds. \"I can imagine how unpleasant a thing it would be to watch; hearing it is only slightly less so\", he concluded.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Rolling Stones: Got Live If  You Want It|last=Reilly|first=Peter|page=120|volume=18|magazine=[[High Fidelity (magazine)|HiFi]]|year=1967}}</ref>\n\n[[David Dalton (writer)|David Dalton]], in his 1972 biography on the band, considers ''Got Live If You Want It!'' in a series of Stones albums \u2013 including ''[[December's Children]]'' (1965), ''Aftermath'' and ''Between the Buttons'' \u2013 to follow their American experiences and feature \"an acceleration of R&B and rock\".

It was released on 3 December 1966 by [[London Records]] in the United States. With its release, the label attempted to fill a marketing gap between the Stones' studio albums and capitalise on their popularity in the US market, which was heightened that year by a notoriously successful [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1966|North American concert tour]] supporting their hit album ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966).\n\nDiscouraged by the fan hysteria accompanying the band in concert at the time, their producer and manager [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] abandoned the original idea of having the album capture the Stones in a single live performance at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]]. Instead, he selected 10 concert recordings from other sources alongside two older studio tracks, which were [[overdubbed]] with crowd noise to give the impression of an entirely live album \u2013 all of the tracks were credited on the original LP to the Royal Albert Hall performance. The album takes it title from the Stones' [[Got Live If You Want It! (EP)|1965 UK-only live EP]], whose own name had been inspired by the 1957 [[Slim Harpo]] recording \"I've Got Love If You Want It\".\n\nThe LP sold well, reaching the number six position on the American [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' albums chart]], although the Stones later disavowed the release. Critics of the album note the poor audibility of the band amid the audience noise, but appreciate its historical and documentary value as well as the intense, high-energy quality of the performances. Rare copies of the LP \u2013 pressed in limited quantities for the European market \u2013 became highly valued by [[record collector]]s. ''Got Live If You Want It!'' has been reissued twice by [[ABKCO Records]], in 1986 on CD and in 2002 on [[Super Audio CD|SACD]].\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Kungliga Tennishallen Stones 1966a.jpg|left|thumb|[[The Rolling Stones]] in 1966]]\nIn 1966, [[the Rolling Stones]]' popularity increased dramatically with the success of their ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' LP and the singles \"[[Paint It, Black]]\" and \"[[Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?]]\". Coupled with the music's commercial impact, the band's high-energy concerts during [[The Rolling Stones American Tour 1966|their North American tour in June and July]] proved highly successful with young people while alienating local police tasked with [[crowd control|controlling]] the often rebellious and physically exhausting crowds. According to the Stones historians Philippe Margotin and Jean-Michel Guesdon, the band's notoriety \"among the authorities and [[the establishment]] seems to have been inversely proportional to their popularity among young people\".<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\nThe Stones' American record distributor, [[London Records]], wanted to capitalise on the Stones' growing popularity by marketing a new album, but were several months behind the scheduled release of their next original album, ''[[Between the Buttons]]'' (1967). A live album release was then planned for the end of 1966.<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\n== Recording and production ==\n{{quote box|quote=\"In the '60s, the Stones didn't play concerts.

As a consequence, [[popular music]] acts were subsequently banned from performing at the Hall. According to the music journalist [[Fred Bronson]], \"the concert drove home the Stones' unpopularity with members of the [[ruling class]].\"<ref name=\"Bronson\">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|year=2003|page=200|title=The Billboard Book of Number One Hits|publisher=[[Billboard Books]]|isbn=0823076776}}</ref>\n\nThe Stones' producer and manager, [[Andrew Loog Oldham]], abandoned the original idea in response to this \"collective hysteria generated by the group, especially among teenagers, which threatened to degenerate into rioting\", as Margotin and Guesdon describe.

Sequenced as the LP's opening track, \"Under My Thumb\" featured a passionate introduction of the group by [[Long John Baldry]], who had sung in [[Alexis Korner]]'s London-based band [[Blues Incorporated]] alongside three members of the Stones in 1962 \u2013 Jagger, rhythm guitarist [[Brian Jones]] and drummer [[Charlie Watts]]. The Stones' concert at [[Colston Hall]] in Bristol on 7 October 1966 produced the recordings of \"[[Lady Jane (song)|Lady Jane]]\", \"[[Not Fade Away (song)|Not Fade Away]]\", \"Have You Seen Your Mother, Baby, Standing in the Shadow?\" and \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\". According to Margotin and Guesdon, \"[[Time Is on My Side]]\" and \"I'm Alright\" were performed on 5 March and 7 March 1965 at either Regal Theatre in London, the Palace Theatre in Manchester or the Empire Theatre in Liverpool.<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\nFor the live recordings, the engineer [[Glyn Johns]] used the [[IBC Studios|IBC Mobile Unit]], the technical function of which Margotin and Guesdon say was \"not yet really suited to rock concerts\". Johns captured each show by suspending microphones from the venue's balcony.<ref name=\"Running\"/> [[Keith Richards]], the Stones' lead guitarist, remarked at the time on the difference in being recorded live, \"We all knew that the sound that we were getting live and in the studio was not what we were getting on record \u2013 the difference was light years apart.\"<ref name=\"Havers\"/>\n\nThe first of the album's two studio recordings, \"[[I've Been Loving You Too Long]]\", was cut between 11 May and 12 May 1965 at RCA Studios in Hollywood. The second, \"[[Fortune Teller (song)|Fortune Teller]]\", was taken from a 9 July 1963 session at Decca Studios in West Hampstead. According to the band's bassist [[Bill Wyman]], both studio tracks had \"crowd atmosphere added\", while even the live recordings of \"Lady Jane\", \"I'm Alright\", \"Have You Seen Your Mother\", and \"Satisfaction\" \"all benefited from various amounts of overdubs at Olympic Studios in mid-October\".<ref name=\"Running\"/>\n\n== Title and packaging ==\nThe Rolling Stones conceived ''Got Live If You Want It!''{{'}}s name from the song \"I've Got Love If You Want It\", recorded in 1957 by [[Slim Harpo]], one of the band's favourite [[blues]] musicians.<ref name=\"Havers\"/> The name was first used for [[Got Live If You Want It!

The majority of his review focused instead on the moral implications of the Stones performing sleazily, as he described, for an audience presumed to be mostly adolescent and preadolescent girls, leading him to condemn the band on \"[[puritanical]]\" grounds. \"I can imagine how unpleasant a thing it would be to watch; hearing it is only slightly less so\", he concluded.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Rolling Stones: Got Live If  You Want It|last=Reilly|first=Peter|page=120|volume=18|magazine=[[High Fidelity (magazine)|HiFi]]|year=1967}}</ref>\n\n[[David Dalton (writer)|David Dalton]], in his 1972 biography on the band, considers ''Got Live If You Want It!'' in a series of Stones albums \u2013 including ''[[December's Children]]'' (1965), ''Aftermath'' and ''Between the Buttons'' \u2013 to follow their American experiences and feature \"an acceleration of R&B and rock\".

It  contrasts with other narratives of the past, such as [[myth]]ological, [[oral history|oral]] or [[archeological record|archeological]] traditions. For broader [[world history]], recorded [[history]] begins with the accounts of the [[Ancient history|ancient world]] around the [[4th millennium BC]], and coincides with the [[invention of writing]]. For some geographic regions or cultures, written history is limited to a relatively recent period in human history because of the limited use of written records. Moreover, human cultures do not always record all of the information relevant to later historians, such as the full impact of natural disasters or the names of individuals. Recorded history for particular types of information is therefore limited based on the types of records kept. Because of this, recorded history in different contexts may refer to different periods of time depending on the topic.\n\nThe interpretation of recorded history often relies on [[historical method]], or the set of techniques and guidelines by which historians use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to write accounts of the past. The question of the nature, and even the possibility of an effective method for interpreting recorded history is raised in the [[philosophy of history]] as a question of [[epistemology]]. The study of different historical methods is known as [[historiography]], which focuses on examining how different interpreters of recorded history create different interpretations of historical evidence.\n\n== Prehistory ==\n{{Further|History of writing}}\n\n[[Prehistory]] traditionally refers to the span of time before recorded history, ending with the invention of [[writing systems]].<ref name=\"Shotwell1922\">Shotwell, James Thomson. An Introduction to the History of History. Records of civilization, sources and studies. New York: Columbia University Press, 1922.</ref> Prehistory refers to the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood.\n\n[[Protohistory]] refers to the transition period between prehistory and history, after the advent of [[literacy]] in a society but before the writings of the first [[historians]]. Protohistory may also refer to the period during which a [[culture]] or [[civilization]] has not yet developed writing, but other cultures have noted its existence in their own writings.\n\nMore complete writing systems were preceded by [[proto-writing]]. Early examples are the [[Jiahu symbols]] (c. 6600 BCE), [[Vin\u010da signs]] (c. 5300 BCE), early [[Indus script]] (c. 3500 BCE) and [[Nsibidi]] script (c. before 500 CE). There is disagreement concerning exactly when prehistory becomes history, and when proto-writing became \"true writing\".<ref>Smail, Daniel Lord. On Deep History and the Brain. An Ahmanson foundation book in the humanities. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008.</ref> However, invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[Neolithic]] of the late [[4th millennium BCE]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400\u20133200 BCE with earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BCE]].\n\n==Historical accounts==\n{{main|Historiography#The history of written history|l1=Historiography \u2013 The history of written history}}\n\nThe earliest [[Chronology| chronologies]] date back to the earliest civilizations of [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Sumer|Sumerians]],<ref>{{cite web|title= The Cuneiform Writing System in Ancient Mesopotamia: Emergence and Evolution|url= http://edsitement.neh.gov/lesson-plan/cuneiform-writing-system-ancient-mesopotamia-emergence-and-evolution|publisher= EDSITEment|accessdate= 16 December 2013}}</ref> which emerged independently of each other from roughly 3500 B.C.<ref>{{cite web|last= Kott|first= Ruth E.|title= The origins of writing|url= http://magazine.uchicago.edu/1102/features/the_origins_of_writing.shtml|publisher= The University of Chicago Magazine|accessdate= 16 December 2013}}</ref> Earliest recorded history, which varies greatly in quality and reliability, deals with [[Pharaoh]]s and their [[List of pharaohs |reigns]], as preserved by [[ancient Egypt]]ians.<ref>{{cite book|last= Ad\u00e8s|first= Harry|title= A Traveller's History of Egypt|date= 2007|publisher= [[Interlink Publishing]]|isbn= 978-1566566544|page= [https://archive.org/details/travellershistor0000ades/page/28 28]|url= https://archive.org/details/travellershistor0000ades/page/28}}</ref> Much of the earliest recorded history was re-discovered relatively recently due to [[archaeological site| archaeological dig sites]] findings.<ref>{{cite book|last= Greer|first= Thomas H.|title= A Brief History of the Western World|date= 2004|publisher= [[Cengage Learning]]|isbn= 978-0534642365|page= 16}}</ref> A number of different traditions have developed in different parts of the world as to how to interpret these ancient accounts.\n\n===Europe===\n[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] knew of seven predecessors of [[Herodotus]], including [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]], [[Xanthus of Lydia]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus]]. He described their works as simple, unadorned accounts of their own and other cities and people, Greek or foreign, including popular legends.\n\n[[Herodotus]] (484 B.C. \u2013 {{circa}} 425 B.C. )<ref name=\"lamberg-karlovsky-p5\">{{cite book |title= Ancient Civilizations: The Near East and Mesoamerica |author= Lamberg-Karlovsky, C.

However, his contemporary [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 B.C. \u2013 c. 400 B.C.) is credited{{by whom?|date=September 2019}} with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention.<ref name=\"lamberg-karlovsky-p5\" /> History developed as a popular form of literature in later Greek and Roman societies in the works of [[Polybius]], [[Tacitus]] and others. \n\n[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was influential in [[Western Christianity|Christian]] and [[Western thought]] at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and [[Renaissance]] periods, history was often studied through a [[sacred history |sacred]] or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] brought [[philosophy]] and a more [[secular]] approach into historical study.<ref name=\"graham-ch1\">{{cite book |title= The Shape of the Past |author= Graham, Gordon |publisher= [[Oxford University]] |date= 1997 |chapter= Chapter 1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sumerian 26th c Adab.jpg|thumbnail|[[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] inscription in monumental archaic style, c. 26th century B.C.]] According to [[John Tosh]], \"From the High Middle Ages (c.1000\u20131300) onwards, the written word survives in greater abundance than any other source for Western history.\"<ref name=\"Tosh59\">Tosh, ''The Pursuit of History'', 90.</ref> Western historians developed methods comparable to modern historiographic research in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany, where they began investigating these source materials to write histories of their past. Many of these histories had strong ideological and political ties to their historical narratives. In the 20th century, academic historians began focusing less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or [[great men theory |great men]], to attempt more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a [[social science]] rather than as an [[art]], which traditionally had been the case. French historians associated with the [[Annales School]] introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of [[cultural history]].\n\n===East Asia===\nThe ''[[Zuo zhuan]]'', attributed to [[Zuo Qiuming]] in the {{annum| 5th century|B.C. }} covers the period from {{annum|722 to 468|B.C. }} in a  narrative form. The [[Book of Documents]] is one of the [[Five Classics]] of [[Chinese classic texts]] and one of the earliest narratives of China. The ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', the official chronicle of the State of Lu covering the period from {{annum|722 to 481|B.C. }}, is arranged on [[Annals| annalistic]] principles. It is traditionally attributed to [[Confucius]] (551\u2013479 B.C. ). ''[[Zhan Guo Ce]]'' was a renowned ancient Chinese historical compilation of sporadic materials on the [[Warring States period]] compiled between the {{annum|3rd and 1st centuries|B.C. }}.\n\n[[Sima Qian]] (around {{annum |100|B.C.}}) was the first in China to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing. His written work was the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', a monumental lifelong achievement in literature. Its scope extends as far back as the {{annum| 16th century|B.C. }}, and it includes many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people, and also explores the lives and deeds of commoners, both contemporary and those of previous eras. His work influenced every subsequent author of history in China, including the prestigious Ban family of the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] era.\n\n===South Asia===\nIn Sri Lanka, the oldest historical text is the [[Mahavamsa]] ({{circa}} 5th century CE). Buddhist monks of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya maintained chronicles of Sri Lankan history starting from the third century BCE. These annals were combined and compiled into a single document in the 5th century by the [[Mahanama of Anuradhapura]] while [[Dhatusena of Anuradhapura]] was ruling the [[Anuradhapura Kingdom]]. It was written based on prior ancient compilations known as the ''[[Atthakatha]]'', which were commentaries written in Sinhala.{{sfn|Oldenberg|1879|p=}}{{Page needed|date=February 2016}} An earlier document known as the ''[[Dipavamsa]]''(4th century CE) \"Island Chronicles\" is much simpler and contains less information than the ''Mahavamsa'' and was probably compiled using the ''Atthakatha'' on the ''Mahavamsa'' as well.\n\nA companion volume, the ''[[Culavamsa]]'' \"Lesser Chronicle\", compiled by [[Sinhalese people|Sinhala]] monks, covers the period from the 4th century to the [[British Empire|British]] takeover of Sri Lanka in 1815. The ''Culavamsa'' was compiled by a number of authors of different time periods.\n\nThe combined work, sometimes referred to collectively as the ''Mahavamsa'', provides a continuous historical record of over two millennia, and is considered one of the world's longest unbroken historical accounts.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Trip\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b|editor1-first=\u015ar\u012bdhara|title=Encyclopaedia of Pali Literature: The Pali canon |volume=1 |date=2008|publisher=Anmol|isbn=9788126135608|page=117}}</ref> It is one of the few documents containing material relating to the [[Naga people (Lanka)|N\u0101ga]] and [[Yaksha|Yakkha people]]s, indigenous inhabitants of [[Lanka]] prior to the legendary arrival of Prince Vijaya from Singha Pura of Kalinga.\n\n===Middle East===\nIn the preface to his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), the [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]] and [[Sociology in medieval Islam|early sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. Ibn Khaldun often criticized \"idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data.\" As a result, he introduced a [[scientific method]] to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his \"new science\".<ref>[[Ibn Khaldun]], Franz Rosenthal, N.

History can now be recorded through [[photography]], [[audio recording]]s, and [[video recording]]s. More recently, [[Web archive|Internet archives]] have been saving copies of webpages, documenting the history of the [[Internet]]. Other methods of collecting historical information have also accompanied the change in technologies; for example, since at least the 20th century, attempts have been made to preserve [[oral history]] by recording it. Until the 1990s this was done using [[analogue recording]] methods such as [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]] and [[reel-to-reel tape]]s. With the onset of new technologies, there are now [[digital recording]]s, which may be recorded to CDs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preserving Oral History Recordings|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/openpublish/index.php/nlasp/article/viewArticle/1034/1302|publisher=National Library of Australia|accessdate=16 December 2013|author=Colin Webb|author2=Kevin Bradley |archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/21336/20080620-0137/www.nla.gov.au/nla/staffpaper/cwebb4.html|archivedate=20 June 2008|url-status=live|date=1997}}</ref> Nevertheless, historical record and interpretation often relies heavily on written records, partially because it dominates the extant historical materials, and partially because historians are used to communicating and researching in that medium.<ref name=Tosh-58-59>Tosh, ''The Pursuit of History'' 58-59</ref>\n\n===Historical method===\nThe [[historical method]] comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]].

It  contrasts with other narratives of the past, such as [[myth]]ological, [[oral history|oral]] or [[archeological record|archeological]] traditions. For broader [[world history]], recorded [[history]] begins with the accounts of the [[Ancient history|ancient world]] around the [[4th millennium BC]], and coincides with the [[invention of writing]]. For some geographic regions or cultures, written history is limited to a relatively recent period in human history because of the limited use of written records. Moreover, human cultures do not always record all of the information relevant to later historians, such as the full impact of natural disasters or the names of individuals. Recorded history for particular types of information is therefore limited based on the types of records kept. Because of this, recorded history in different contexts may refer to different periods of time depending on the topic.\n\nThe interpretation of recorded history often relies on [[historical method]], or the set of techniques and guidelines by which historians use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to write accounts of the past. The question of the nature, and even the possibility of an effective method for interpreting recorded history is raised in the [[philosophy of history]] as a question of [[epistemology]]. The study of different historical methods is known as [[historiography]], which focuses on examining how different interpreters of recorded history create different interpretations of historical evidence.\n\n== Prehistory ==\n{{Further|History of writing}}\n\n[[Prehistory]] traditionally refers to the span of time before recorded history, ending with the invention of [[writing systems]].<ref name=\"Shotwell1922\">Shotwell, James Thomson. An Introduction to the History of History. Records of civilization, sources and studies. New York: Columbia University Press, 1922.</ref> Prehistory refers to the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood.\n\n[[Protohistory]] refers to the transition period between prehistory and history, after the advent of [[literacy]] in a society but before the writings of the first [[historians]]. Protohistory may also refer to the period during which a [[culture]] or [[civilization]] has not yet developed writing, but other cultures have noted its existence in their own writings.\n\nMore complete writing systems were preceded by [[proto-writing]]. Early examples are the [[Jiahu symbols]] (c. 6600 BCE), [[Vin\u010da signs]] (c. 5300 BCE), early [[Indus script]] (c. 3500 BCE) and [[Nsibidi]] script (c. before 500 CE). There is disagreement concerning exactly when prehistory becomes history, and when proto-writing became \"true writing\".<ref>Smail, Daniel Lord. On Deep History and the Brain. An Ahmanson foundation book in the humanities. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008.</ref> However, invention of the first writing systems is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[Neolithic]] of the late [[4th millennium BCE]]. The [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] archaic [[cuneiform (script)|cuneiform script]] and the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] are generally considered the earliest writing systems, both emerging out of their ancestral proto-literate symbol systems from 3400\u20133200 BCE with earliest coherent texts from about [[26th century BC|2600 BCE]].\n\n==Historical accounts==\n{{main|Historiography#The history of written history|l1=Historiography \u2013 The history of written history}}\n\nThe earliest [[Chronology| chronologies]] date back to the earliest civilizations of [[Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)|Early Dynastic Period Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]] and the [[Sumer|Sumerians]],<ref>{{cite web|title= The Cuneiform Writing System in Ancient Mesopotamia: Emergence and Evolution|url= http://edsitement.neh.gov/lesson-plan/cuneiform-writing-system-ancient-mesopotamia-emergence-and-evolution|publisher= EDSITEment|accessdate= 16 December 2013}}</ref> which emerged independently of each other from roughly 3500 B.C.<ref>{{cite web|last= Kott|first= Ruth E.|title= The origins of writing|url= http://magazine.uchicago.edu/1102/features/the_origins_of_writing.shtml|publisher= The University of Chicago Magazine|accessdate= 16 December 2013}}</ref> Earliest recorded history, which varies greatly in quality and reliability, deals with [[Pharaoh]]s and their [[List of pharaohs |reigns]], as preserved by [[ancient Egypt]]ians.<ref>{{cite book|last= Ad\u00e8s|first= Harry|title= A Traveller's History of Egypt|date= 2007|publisher= [[Interlink Publishing]]|isbn= 978-1566566544|page= [https://archive.org/details/travellershistor0000ades/page/28 28]|url= https://archive.org/details/travellershistor0000ades/page/28}}</ref> Much of the earliest recorded history was re-discovered relatively recently due to [[archaeological site| archaeological dig sites]] findings.<ref>{{cite book|last= Greer|first= Thomas H.|title= A Brief History of the Western World|date= 2004|publisher= [[Cengage Learning]]|isbn= 978-0534642365|page= 16}}</ref> A number of different traditions have developed in different parts of the world as to how to interpret these ancient accounts.\n\n===Europe===\n[[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]] knew of seven predecessors of [[Herodotus]], including [[Hellanicus of Lesbos]], [[Xanthus of Lydia]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus]].

However, his contemporary [[Thucydides]] (c. 460 B.C. \u2013 c. 400 B.C.) is credited{{by whom?|date=September 2019}} with having first approached history with a well-developed historical method in his work the ''[[History of the Peloponnesian War]]''. Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention.<ref name=\"lamberg-karlovsky-p5\" /> History developed as a popular form of literature in later Greek and Roman societies in the works of [[Polybius]], [[Tacitus]] and others. \n\n[[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]] was influential in [[Western Christianity|Christian]] and [[Western thought]] at the beginning of the medieval period. Through the Medieval and [[Renaissance]] periods, history was often studied through a [[sacred history |sacred]] or religious perspective. Around 1800, German philosopher and historian [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] brought [[philosophy]] and a more [[secular]] approach into historical study.<ref name=\"graham-ch1\">{{cite book |title= The Shape of the Past |author= Graham, Gordon |publisher= [[Oxford University]] |date= 1997 |chapter= Chapter 1}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sumerian 26th c Adab.jpg|thumbnail|[[Sumerian language|Sumerian]] inscription in monumental archaic style, c. 26th century B.C.]] According to [[John Tosh]], \"From the High Middle Ages (c.1000\u20131300) onwards, the written word survives in greater abundance than any other source for Western history.\"<ref name=\"Tosh59\">Tosh, ''The Pursuit of History'', 90.</ref> Western historians developed methods comparable to modern historiographic research in the 17th and 18th centuries, especially in France and Germany, where they began investigating these source materials to write histories of their past. Many of these histories had strong ideological and political ties to their historical narratives. In the 20th century, academic historians began focusing less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or [[great men theory |great men]], to attempt more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a [[social science]] rather than as an [[art]], which traditionally had been the case. French historians associated with the [[Annales School]] introduced quantitative history, using raw data to track the lives of typical individuals, and were prominent in the establishment of [[cultural history]].\n\n===East Asia===\nThe ''[[Zuo zhuan]]'', attributed to [[Zuo Qiuming]] in the {{annum| 5th century|B.C. }} covers the period from {{annum|722 to 468|B.C. }} in a  narrative form. The [[Book of Documents]] is one of the [[Five Classics]] of [[Chinese classic texts]] and one of the earliest narratives of China. The ''[[Spring and Autumn Annals]]'', the official chronicle of the State of Lu covering the period from {{annum|722 to 481|B.C. }}, is arranged on [[Annals| annalistic]] principles. It is traditionally attributed to [[Confucius]] (551\u2013479 B.C. ). ''[[Zhan Guo Ce]]'' was a renowned ancient Chinese historical compilation of sporadic materials on the [[Warring States period]] compiled between the {{annum|3rd and 1st centuries|B.C. }}.\n\n[[Sima Qian]] (around {{annum |100|B.C.}}) was the first in China to lay the groundwork for professional historical writing. His written work was the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', a monumental lifelong achievement in literature. Its scope extends as far back as the {{annum| 16th century|B.C. }}, and it includes many treatises on specific subjects and individual biographies of prominent people, and also explores the lives and deeds of commoners, both contemporary and those of previous eras. His work influenced every subsequent author of history in China, including the prestigious Ban family of the [[Eastern Han Dynasty]] era.\n\n===South Asia===\nIn Sri Lanka, the oldest historical text is the [[Mahavamsa]] ({{circa}} 5th century CE). Buddhist monks of the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya maintained chronicles of Sri Lankan history starting from the third century BCE. These annals were combined and compiled into a single document in the 5th century by the [[Mahanama of Anuradhapura]] while [[Dhatusena of Anuradhapura]] was ruling the [[Anuradhapura Kingdom]]. It was written based on prior ancient compilations known as the ''[[Atthakatha]]'', which were commentaries written in Sinhala.{{sfn|Oldenberg|1879|p=}}{{Page needed|date=February 2016}} An earlier document known as the ''[[Dipavamsa]]''(4th century CE) \"Island Chronicles\" is much simpler and contains less information than the ''Mahavamsa'' and was probably compiled using the ''Atthakatha'' on the ''Mahavamsa'' as well.\n\nA companion volume, the ''[[Culavamsa]]'' \"Lesser Chronicle\", compiled by [[Sinhalese people|Sinhala]] monks, covers the period from the 4th century to the [[British Empire|British]] takeover of Sri Lanka in 1815. The ''Culavamsa'' was compiled by a number of authors of different time periods.\n\nThe combined work, sometimes referred to collectively as the ''Mahavamsa'', provides a continuous historical record of over two millennia, and is considered one of the world's longest unbroken historical accounts.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Trip\u0101\u1e6dh\u012b|editor1-first=\u015ar\u012bdhara|title=Encyclopaedia of Pali Literature: The Pali canon |volume=1 |date=2008|publisher=Anmol|isbn=9788126135608|page=117}}</ref> It is one of the few documents containing material relating to the [[Naga people (Lanka)|N\u0101ga]] and [[Yaksha|Yakkha people]]s, indigenous inhabitants of [[Lanka]] prior to the legendary arrival of Prince Vijaya from Singha Pura of Kalinga.\n\n===Middle East===\nIn the preface to his book, the ''[[Muqaddimah]]'' (1377), the [[Historiography of early Islam|Arab historian]] and [[Sociology in medieval Islam|early sociologist]], [[Ibn Khaldun]], warned of seven mistakes that he thought that historians regularly committed. In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation. Ibn Khaldun often criticized \"idle [[superstition]] and uncritical acceptance of historical data.\" As a result, he introduced a [[scientific method]] to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his \"new science\".<ref>[[Ibn Khaldun]], Franz Rosenthal, N.

History can now be recorded through [[photography]], [[audio recording]]s, and [[video recording]]s. More recently, [[Web archive|Internet archives]] have been saving copies of webpages, documenting the history of the [[Internet]]. Other methods of collecting historical information have also accompanied the change in technologies; for example, since at least the 20th century, attempts have been made to preserve [[oral history]] by recording it. Until the 1990s this was done using [[analogue recording]] methods such as [[Compact Cassette|cassettes]] and [[reel-to-reel tape]]s. With the onset of new technologies, there are now [[digital recording]]s, which may be recorded to CDs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preserving Oral History Recordings|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/openpublish/index.php/nlasp/article/viewArticle/1034/1302|publisher=National Library of Australia|accessdate=16 December 2013|author=Colin Webb|author2=Kevin Bradley |archiveurl=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/21336/20080620-0137/www.nla.gov.au/nla/staffpaper/cwebb4.html|archivedate=20 June 2008|url-status=live|date=1997}}</ref> Nevertheless, historical record and interpretation often relies heavily on written records, partially because it dominates the extant historical materials, and partially because historians are used to communicating and researching in that medium.<ref name=Tosh-58-59>Tosh, ''The Pursuit of History'' 58-59</ref>\n\n===Historical method===\nThe [[historical method]] comprises the techniques and guidelines by which [[historian]]s use [[primary source]]s and other evidence to research and then to [[historiography|write history]].

Externally, the taillights were restyled (similar to XY Falcon), and a new plastic grille with metal surround (mimicking the USA and Brasilian market 1966 model year Galaxie 500) and new boot garnish were used. Internally, new door trim patterns debuted and the speedometer backing was now black instead of the silver used on ZCs.\n\nThe ZA to ZD were basically stretched versions of the XR to XY series Ford Falcons, respectively, with the extra length added behind the rear door, moving the rear seat back and giving more leg room.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Second generation ===\n==== ZF (1972\u20131973) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1973 Ford Fairlane (ZF) 500 sedan (20407681604).jpg\n| image2 = 1973 Ford Fairlane (ZF) 500 sedan (21030274955).jpg\n| footer =  Ford Fairlane (ZF) 500\n}}\nAn all-new, Australian-designed ZF series Fairlane was launched in April 1972, with swoopier bodywork, but criticisms launched that it looked too much like a four-headlamp version of the basic Falcon. The ZF Fairlanes were joined by an even more upscale LTD in August 1973, with hidden headlamps and vinyl roof. Model names remained the same (Custom and 500), as did the engine choices, as the previous model year. Although this car was designed and built exclusively in Australia, its styling is reminiscent of the US-market [[Mercury Montego]]. The 1973 ZF also had the last manual transmission; afterwards, all Fairlanes were automatics.\n\nThis model was also sold in South Africa, unlike the Falcon, which was discontinued in favour of the European [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Granada]]. Only the Fairlane 500, with column shift and seating for six, was available in South Africa.

The changes were mainly cosmetic, with a four-horizontal-bar grille and revised taillight lenses and garnish panel. An anniversary model with a standard 302 was released in 1975, but otherwise the range stayed the same as the 1974 versions.\nThe Fairlane-based P5 series Ford LTD was released very late in the ZF model run in August 1973, three months prior to the ZG Fairlane. The LTD was only available as a four-door sedan, and the wheelbase was even longer than that of the Fairlane, itself a stretched Falcon. A luxury two-door coup\u00e9 called the [[Ford Landau (Australia)|Ford Landau]] (also designated P5) was released at the same time. The Landau was based on the Australian Falcon Hardtop, so featured a {{convert|111|in|mm|adj=mid}} wheelbase as opposed to the {{convert|121|in|mm|adj=mid}} wheelbase of the LTD. Both models were notable for their [[hidden headlights|concealed headlamps]], which were revealed when their vacuum-operated [[grille]] sections were retracted. The technology was similar to that found on earlier models of the American built [[Ford Thunderbird]]. Standard equipment on both the LTD and the Landau included integrated air conditioning, automatic transmission, electric windows, and a 351ci / 5.8L V8 engine.\n\nAlso in July 1975, Ford commenced a release of the Town Cars. These were 50th-Anniversary models, celebrating 50 years of Ford in Australia. They produced 250 of each in the LTD and Fairlane ranges. The Fairlanes in particular were optioned with LTD components, 15-inch wheels, leather interior, and electric windows to name some options. In the Fairlane, only a small handful was special-ordered with a 351 motor. All others were 302s. The LTD were 351-engine cars.\n\n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/23725628@N06/4626374317/in/photostream 50th Anniversary Model badge]\n\nAs the P5 was released during the ZF model run, it retained many ZF components. For example, the main interior upgrade from the Fairlane ZF to ZG was the turn signal stalk. The ZF had the older-style stalk with the high beam \"dipper\" switch on the floor. When the ZG Fairlane was released a big item was the new multifunction column stalk which incorporated the dipper switch and horn. The P5s, however, used the ZF-style stalk and still had a \"squeeze rim\" horn similar to Falcon GTs of the era.  Because the P6 LTD was not released until about five months after the ZH Fairlane, some of the last P5s actually had a few minor ZH parts fitted.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== ZH / P6 (1976\u20131979) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = Ford Fairlane ZH 500 (23531054516).jpg\n| image2 = Ford Fairlane ZH 500 (22930040893).jpg\n| footer =  1976\u201379 Ford Fairlane (ZH) 500\n}}\n\nThe ZH series addressed earlier complaints about the Fairlane being too close to the Falcon in May 1976. The designers retained the same central section from the upcoming XC [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] (including that car's new rear doors), but put on lengthened front and rear ends, giving the car more bulk and a luxury impression. The styling was reminiscent of the 1968 [[Mercury Marquis]]. The range-topping LTD went further upmarket with a fancy, [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royce]]-inspired grille (not dissimilar to that found on the [[Lincoln Continental Mark V|Continental Mark V]]. Another sign of the upmarket move was the 500 becoming the basic trim (the Custom was deleted), and the Fairlane Marquis being the upscale version. The Marquis was Ford's response to the [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman Caprice]], which was introduced in 1974 as an LTD rival. ZH also moved to the use of the metric system to denote the engine sizes: the basic engine was known as the 4.9&nbsp;L, the other as the 5.8&nbsp;L. All ZH Marquises built after January 1979 had Borg-Warner differentials instead of the Ford 9-inch.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 200\n| image1 = Ford LTD (P6).jpg\n| image2 = 1978 Ford LTD (P6) sedan (23611729281).jpg\n| footer =  1976\u20131979 Ford LTD (P6)\n}}\n\nThe P6 Series LTD was introduced in September 1976.<ref>[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/ford_LTD_FB_technical_specifications.htm Ford LTD FB/P6 Technical Specifications].

This model was a leap ahead into the new decade, with squared-off lines and a six-light bodyshell clearly distinguishing Fairlane from the new XD Falcon of that year. The traditional quad headlights and distinctive vertically striped taillights further differentiated the luxury model from Falcon. The trim levels were deleted:  now, only a single Fairlane was available, with {{convert|302|cuin|L|1|order=flip|adj=mid}} or {{convert|351|cuin|L|1|order=flip|adj=mid}} V8 engine choices. In October, recognising the fuel crisis, Ford introduced a Fairlane with a {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|order=flip|adj=mid}} inline-six from the Falcon.\n\nThe LTD version of the ZJ surfaced in October 1979 as the FC Series, using the same wheelbase and body panels as the Fairlane. In mid-1980, the Falcon 4.1-litre alloy head engine was made optional, the first time the LTD was available in six-cylinder guise.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:1982 Ford LTD (FC) sedan (2015-05-29) 01.jpg|Ford LTD (FC)\nFile:1982 Ford LTD (FC) sedan (2015-05-29) 03.jpg|Ford LTD (FC)\nFile:1981 Ford FC LTD Cartier (6058256901).jpg|Ford LTD (FC) Cartier\n</gallery>\n\n==== {{anchor|ZK|FD}} ZK / FD (1982\u20131984) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 200\n| image1 = 1982-1984 Ford Fairlane (ZK) sedan (2012-01-15) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1982-1984 Ford Fairlane (ZK) sedan (2012-01-15) 02.jpg\n| footer = 1982\u20131984 Ford Fairlane (ZK)\n}}\n\nThe ZK series of March 1982 had the deletion of the 5.8-L V8, which was the first warning the company would soon drop [[V8 engine|V8s]] from the local line-up. Minor changes were made to grille and taillights, but otherwise the external changes were negligible. In March 1983, the 4.9-L V8 was deleted, too, with Ford introducing a [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] version of the six to take its place, claiming the new engine had  acceleration figures equivalent to the V8.\n\nThe main notable mechanical change was the introduction of the coil sprung, watts link-located rear axle, one of the best live rear-axle configurations.\n\nThe LTD FC series was updated to and designated FD in March 1982 with the V8 engine option deleted the following year.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== {{anchor|ZL|FE}} ZL / FE (1984\u20131988) ====\n[[File:1984-1986 Ford ZL Fairlane sedan (2011-01-05) 02.jpg|thumb|Ford Fairlane (ZL)]]\n\nThe revised ZL series of 1985 (launched October 1984) kept the two six-cylinder engine options; only at the end of 1986 was the carburettor version of the Fairlane deleted. The ZL again carried over all external panels, but now had integrated headlights with clear indicators, full wrap-around bumpers, and new taillights. Inside, a full digital dashboard was introduced with push-button controls at either end of the instrument binnacle.

The philosophy was the same - a long-wheelbase Falcon with a six-light body. The 4.1-L six was heavily revised, becoming a 3.9-L unit with improved fuel economy and power. These models were part of the EA26 development programme and platform (E for the market segment, A for Australia, 26 the project code). Therefore, officially they were EA26s, but colloquially, Ford aficionados prefer a two-letter code. Hence, the new Fairlanes were given the NA series code.\n\nThe equivalent LTDs came on stream as the DA series in June 1988. Like the previous generation, all N-series Fairlanes and D-series LTDs were built on the Falcon/Fairmont station-wagon platform, and this legacy is most noticeable in the disproportionally narrow station-wagon rear doors on what was meant to be a limousine and in a car that otherwise caters well for rear-seat passengers with a large amount of interior seating and legroom space. Nonetheless, these large sedans were \"limousine enough\" to be one of the most common platforms used by Australian body-building companies to make stretch limousines.\n\nRevisions from November 1989 for the 1990 model year had the release of the NA II and DAII, the most notable change being the fitting of a four-speed, rather than three-speed, automatic transmission (since the Fairlane's debut, it had a three-speed).\n\nAlthough Ford Australia's former official historian, the late Adrian Ryan, was emphatic, officially, an NB series Fairlane never existed, at least one early 1989 prototype fitted with a four-speed automatic escaped from the factory bearing a compliance plate marked \"NB\" and was registered as an \"NB Fairlane\". Ford also produced an alloy wheel identification-guide poster for its parts counters listing one wheel as being for an \"NB Sportsman Fairlane\" and at one point the Series II NA likely was going to be called the NB. Third-party parts suppliers also often list both an \"NB Fairlane\" an \"NB \u2013 Series II Fairlane\" in their parts catalogues adding to the NB mystery. DOTARS (the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Services) has no record of giving Ford approval to use an \"NB Fairlane\" compliance plate for a production model which might explain Ford's reluctance to officially acknowledge the \"NB\". {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}{{original research inline|date=April 2012}}\n\n==== NC / DC (1991\u20131995) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1994 Ford Fairlane (NC II) Ghia sedan (2011-11-30) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1994 Ford Fairlane (NC II) Ghia sedan (2011-11-30) 02.jpg\n| footer = 1993 Ford Fairlane (NC II) Ghia sedan\n}}\n\n[[File:1994 Ford LTD (DC II) sedan (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|thumb|right|1994 Ford LTD (DC II)]]\n\nAugust 1991 had the news that many Fairlane/LTD purists had awaited: the reintroduction of the V8 in the NC Fairlane and DC-series LTD. Ford had never recovered from deleting the V8s in the 1980s and bowed to public pressure with its reintroduction. The 5.0-L engine was not identical to the one used in the United States Mustang and other passenger cars. For reason of better durability and perhaps cost, it was the Canadian-made Windsor engine used in the North American light truck and 4WD models. To meet the needs of the space required for a right-drive steering column, its inlet manifold was reversed. Again to meet the conversion to right-hand drive and the rerouted inlet ducting, air box, and air conditioning lines, the Australian-installed engines also had most of their serpentine belt-driven accessories on opposite side to the US/North American models. As Australian enthusiasts often found to their frustration, these subtle changes often meant that many Ford Racing/SVO add-on bits, like the available superchargers, were not exactly the bolt-on items they were in North America. The inline six continued. The NC also introduced a higher-spec Fairlane, called the Fairlane Ghia, and the V8 was available in this model.\n\nThe 1992 NC II and DC IIs redesignated the 3.9-L engine a \"4.0-litre\", but trim levels remained the same. To appeal to younger buyers, Ford briefly sold a Fairlane Sportsman Ghia in 1993 with a \"Tickford\"-tuned 4.0-L six used in the Falcon XR6.\nA second, even smaller update, known as the NC III, arrived in August 1993. It is the equivalent to the ED series Falcon, adopting the new \"ozone safe\" R134a air conditioning refrigerant. The base Fairlane model was also discontinued, leaving only the Fairlane Ghia.\n\nFrom March 1994 production, the NC received additional changes - the fitment of a leather-wrapped steering wheel, body-coloured bumpers and side protection strips, new-design alloy wheels, and a [[hood ornament|bonnet ornament]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://fordfalconfacts.com/model-specs/fairlane-ltd/nc-fairlane-dc-ltd-1991-1995/ | title = NC Fairlane / DC LTD | publisher = Falcon Facts | accessdate = 14 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nAn idea proposed in the late 1980s was a Fairlane wagon. Most likely, had it entered production, it would have used the Falcon wagon (which rode on the Fairlane's wheelbase) body, coupled with the Fairlane's front clip.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}{{original research inline|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Falcon utilities were still of the previous-generation XF. A prototype EB Falcon utility was made which looked Fairlane-based. To impart a look of solidness, the ute had a Fairlane frontal treatment. It did not enter production.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== NF / DF (1995\u20131996) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal\n| image1 = Ford Fairlane Ghia (4).jpg | width1 = 180\n| image2 = 1995-1996 Ford LTD (DF) sedan (2011-03-23).jpg  | width2 = 242\n| footer = Ford Fairlane Ghia (NF; left) and Ford LTD (DF; right)\n}}\n\nThe Fairlane and LTD received a major front and rear restyle in March 1995 (EA77 series in Ford-speak), coinciding with the EF Falcon, and remained on the same platform. The new NF Fairlanes and DF LTDs were longer and curvier, hiding their 1980s origins reasonably well. The exterior design was more ornamental compared to the relatively clean NAs to NCs. The Fairlane Sportsman reappeared for 1996, with the same formula as 1993, with the 4.0-L six.{{Clear}}\n\n==== NL / DL (1996\u20131999) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1998 Ford Fairlane (NL) Ghia sedan (24141149516).jpg\n| image2 = 1998 Ford Fairlane (NL) Ghia sedan (24059154062).jpg\n| footer =  Ford Fairlane (NL) Ghia\n}}\n\n[[File:1997 Ford LTD (DL) sedan (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|thumb|right|Ford LTD (DL)]]\nIn September 1996, the revised NL Fairlanes and DL LTDs appeared. In 1997, Ford introduced a higher Fairlane Concorde trim, with the same 4.0- and 5.0-L engine choices. No Sportsman variant of the Fairlane was offered.\n\nFor customers, five Dealer modified NL Series Fairlanes from Sydney and Melbourne utilised parts from the 5.0-litre [[Mustang Cobra]] and Australian delivered [[Special Vehicle Operations|SVO]] parts due to the limited edition run of the Fairlane by Tickford and customers wanting to maintain the Luxury look but sport the GT's performance.  The rounded body lines were reminiscent of the US-market Ford Taurus, while the front end styling was similar to the Lincoln Town Car.\n\nFord expanded the Fairlane range greatly in 1998. Beginning with the Ghia, also a basic Concorde (six-cylinder) and Concorde Ghia (V8) were offered. A [[Tickford Vehicle Engineering|Tickford]]-modified version was also available, with the larger engine, as well as a luxurious Fairlane Special Edition Ghia.\n\nThe NL and DL series were the last models to come equipped with automatic self-leveling rear suspension.\n{{clear}}\n\nThe New Zealand Government also used the NL Fairlane Ghia as their designated Crown Limousines. Crown Fairlanes were mostly painted Amaretto (a few in white) and were fitted with silver chonchorde 16 inch wheels, 6 disc cd stacker, electric adjust drivers seat and New Zealand fitted flag pole mounts on the front guards.\n\nAll of the Fairlane Ghias used by the New Zealand Government were fitted with the factory 4.0L six cylinder engine producing 165kw. The LTD was also used with a few being V8 models. The LTD Crown Cars were a range of colours including Dynamic White, Argon Silver, Mocha Foam and Amaretto in the facelift.  \n\nThe NL and DL Crown cars all sported special government only licence plates starting with CR404 in 1997 and continuing in numerical order to CR437 in 1998. Most crown cars were retired after 3 years of service. The Fairlane and LTD had been used by the New Zealand Government since the 1970s through to 2010s where the Ford brand was replaced with BMW 7 series. \n\nThe New Zealand Government still uses CR registration plates on their current Crown Cars.\n\n<br />\n\n=== Fifth generation ===\n==== AU (1999\u20132003) ====\n[[File:2001 Ford Fairlane (AU II) Ghia sedan (2015-07-24) 01.jpg|thumb|Ford Fairlane (AU II) Ghia]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 2002 Ford LTD (AU II) sedan (2010-07-05) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 2002 Ford LTD (AU II) sedan (2010-07-05) 02.jpg\n| footer = 2000\u20132003 Ford LTD (AU II)\n}}\n\nFord introduced its \"[[New Edge]]\" look to the AU series Fairlane in February 1999, with some success, though the EA169 platform was considered a flop, allowing rival [[Holden]] to overtake the company in the sales of full-sized cars. The AU LTD was released 3 months later in May.\n\nThe AU Fairlane and LTD models were the first long-wheelbase sedans to share a model code with the Falcon. They had [[Lincoln Town Car]] styling cues, especially around the [[C-pillar]]. The range was pared back to just two models, the Fairlane Ghia and the LTD, although a limited-edition Fairlane Millennium Ghia was also offered in January 2000.<ref>[http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&ID=D62DD4AB47EC387FCA257125001A1418 Ford AU Fairlane].

A small number of LTDs were exported to the United Kingdom, where they were converted into hearses and limousines.\n\nA high-performance variant of the AU Fairlane was released in 1999 as the [[Tickford Vehicle Engineering|FTE TL50]]. <!-- Its more rate edition is the T3 (based on the [[Ford AU Falcon|Falcon AU III]]) of which only three were produced.{{clarify|date=April 2015}}\n\n -->Ford brought forward revisions to the Falcon and Fairlane ranges when market acceptance of the new cars proved poor in July 2000. The 2001 model year AU II models featured some improvements, and another limited edition was offered: the 75th Anniversary Ghia in October, with the same engine choices as before. The Sportsman Ghia was revived in March 2001 and lasted for more than one model year this time, remaining in the range to the end of 2002.\n\n==== BA (2003\u20132005) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | image1 = 2003-2005 Ford BA Fairlane G220 sedan 01.jpg | width1 = 165\n| image2 = 2003-2005 Ford BA Fairlane G220 sedan (2011-03-09).jpg | width2 = 210\n| footer = 2003\u20132005 Ford Fairlane (BA) G220\n}}\n\nFord's new attempt to battle Holden came in July 2003 with the BA series. The BA Fairlanes and LTDs were closer to the Falcon in looks, even sharing the taillights. The 5.0-L gave way to the larger 5.4-L [[Ford Modular engine#5.4 L|Modular]] V8, already used in the US From this point the LTD was no longer offered with a six-cylinder engine.\n\nTo capture younger buyers, the Fairlane G220 (denoting its {{convert|220|kW|hp|adj=mid}} power output at 4,750&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|472|Nm|lbft}} of torque from 3,250\u20134,000&nbsp;rpm) took the place of the Fairlane Sportsman, and featured the larger engine only. The traditional automatic gearbox was replaced by a [[tiptronic|sequential automatic]]. Unique to the G220 were 17-inch Elegance alloy wheels, ebony headlight bezels with unique lens, and redline leather seats with warm charcoal, perforated leather inserts.\n\nThe Fairlane Ghia continued as the six-cylinder base model, but came standard with colour ICC screen, asix-CD stack, 11-speaker Premium Sound, 7-way adjustable leather seats, and woodgrain inserts.\n\nThe LTD was further distinguished from the Ghia by having the 5.4-L V8 engine, sunroof, 17-inch alloy wheels, LTD badging, 10-way adjustable front seats, bolstered rear seats, [[satellite navigation]], and auto-dimming rear-vision mirror.<ref>{{cite web |last=Torr |first=Feann |year=2003 |url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/xfd_fairlane.htm |title=First Drive: BA Ford Fairlane |publisher=Web Wombat |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nBrakes were the same as on the Falcon, with Fairlanes coming standard with [[electronic brakeforce distribution]] and [[traction control]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mynrma.com.au/motoring-services/reviews/car-reviews/ford/fairlane-ghia-ba-g220-ltd.htm |title=Ford Fairlane Ghia BA G220 & LTD Car Review |publisher=[[NRMA]] |date=1 March 2004 |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Ford Australia's introduction of the BA II Falcon in October 2004, facelifted versions of the Fairlane Ghia, Fairlane G220, and LTD were introduced in March 2005. The changes were mainly cosmetic, but nevertheless significant, and were carried over in the subsequent BF model ranges. The facelifted Fairlane was headlined by a more heavily chromed exterior, including chrome rub strips, a new chromed rear appliqu\u00e9,  and on Fairlane Ghia and LTD, chromed wing mirror covers. The G220 was given new-design seven-spoke alloy wheels, while Fairlane Ghia and LTD added two-toned paint to their side skirts and lower valances.\n\nFor the BA II interior, the black leather seats and leather section of the door trims were replaced with new leather trim dubbed China Beige. The Ghia and G220 gained an eight-way power driver\u2019s seat with memory function. The G220 was given a leather-wrapped sports steering wheel, and the Ghia a Rhui Maple woodgrain and leather steering wheel, and the LTD gained a Stone Maple woodgrain and leather steering wheel.\n\nWhile the only BA II mechanical change was the addition of Sports Control Blade rear-suspension tune for the base Ghia and top-shelf LTD, a DVD rear entertainment system became standard for the LTD, exchangeable for a sunroof.\n\nAn interior upgrade that would be carried over in its entirety to the subsequent BF range was the change from black to brushed silver instrument dials and dash clock, and the silver shifter surround, centre cup holder, and ICC fascia became \"piano black\" with the ICC buttons changed accordingly from black to silver. Chrome door handles, vent tips, and door lock barrels were also added.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pettendy |first=Marton |date=4 February 2005 |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/F5855C5E817D447CCA256F9D007C8CFA |title=Comfort is king in Ford's fresh Fairlane |work=GoAuto |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref> The original woodgrain trim was retained until the BF.\n\n==== BF (2005\u20132007) ====\n[[File:2007 Ford Fairlane (BF) Ghia sedan (2015-07-24).jpg|thumb|2005\u20132007 Ford Fairlane (BF) Ghia]]\n{{multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal\n| image1 = 2006 Ford LTD (BF) sedan (2015-07-24) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 2006 Ford LTD (BF) sedan (2015-07-24) 02.jpg \n| footer = 2005\u20132007 Ford LTD (BF)\n}}\n\nThe BF series Fairlane and LTD models were introduced in October 2005, with the Fairlane G220 renamed the Fairlane G8. Externally, the BF was outwardly identical to the BA Mark II, but fine tunings to steering, suspension, soundproofing and undercarriage were made. Fuel economy was also improved. Across the whole BF range, the taillight lenses were slightly changed in appearance. The Ghia went from 16-inch to 17-inch alloy wheels as standard.\n\nInterior-wise, the only changes from the upgrades introduced in the BA Mark II were the replacement of the woodgrain inserts with \"satin chrome\" inserts. This colour scheme was the same for all BF Fairlane variants. The BF Ghia and LTD came with black leather seats or China beige leather seats with eight-way adjustable drivers seat and six-way adjustable passenger seat.\n\nThe G8 featured an eight-cylinder engine with improved exhaust system and an additional knock sensor, producing  {{convert|230|kW|hp}} at 5,350&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|500|Nm|lbft}} of torque at 3,500&nbsp;rpm.<ref>[http://www.privatefleet.com.au/buying-new-car/car-reviews/ford/ford-fairlane-review/ Ford Fairlane at www.privatefleet.com.au].

This was Ford Australia's top-of-the-range model until replaced by an Australian-assembled version of the full-sized American [[Ford Galaxie]]. In 1967, Ford Australia reintroduced the Fairlane, this time as an Australian-developed, luxury, long-wheelbase version of its mainstream [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]], positioned between the Falcon and the Galaxie. The locally assembled Galaxie evolved into the [[Ford LTD (North America)|LTD]] which was itself replaced in 1973 by an Australian-developed, Fairlane-based model, also known as the Ford LTD. In North America, unlike its designation in Australia, it was not considered a luxury vehicle.

Externally, the taillights were restyled (similar to XY Falcon), and a new plastic grille with metal surround (mimicking the USA and Brasilian market 1966 model year Galaxie 500) and new boot garnish were used. Internally, new door trim patterns debuted and the speedometer backing was now black instead of the silver used on ZCs.\n\nThe ZA to ZD were basically stretched versions of the XR to XY series Ford Falcons, respectively, with the extra length added behind the rear door, moving the rear seat back and giving more leg room.\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Second generation ===\n==== ZF (1972\u20131973) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1973 Ford Fairlane (ZF) 500 sedan (20407681604).jpg\n| image2 = 1973 Ford Fairlane (ZF) 500 sedan (21030274955).jpg\n| footer =  Ford Fairlane (ZF) 500\n}}\nAn all-new, Australian-designed ZF series Fairlane was launched in April 1972, with swoopier bodywork, but criticisms launched that it looked too much like a four-headlamp version of the basic Falcon. The ZF Fairlanes were joined by an even more upscale LTD in August 1973, with hidden headlamps and vinyl roof. Model names remained the same (Custom and 500), as did the engine choices, as the previous model year. Although this car was designed and built exclusively in Australia, its styling is reminiscent of the US-market [[Mercury Montego]]. The 1973 ZF also had the last manual transmission; afterwards, all Fairlanes were automatics.\n\nThis model was also sold in South Africa, unlike the Falcon, which was discontinued in favour of the European [[Ford Granada (Europe)|Granada]]. Only the Fairlane 500, with column shift and seating for six, was available in South Africa.

The changes were mainly cosmetic, with a four-horizontal-bar grille and revised taillight lenses and garnish panel. An anniversary model with a standard 302 was released in 1975, but otherwise the range stayed the same as the 1974 versions.\nThe Fairlane-based P5 series Ford LTD was released very late in the ZF model run in August 1973, three months prior to the ZG Fairlane. The LTD was only available as a four-door sedan, and the wheelbase was even longer than that of the Fairlane, itself a stretched Falcon. A luxury two-door coup\u00e9 called the [[Ford Landau (Australia)|Ford Landau]] (also designated P5) was released at the same time. The Landau was based on the Australian Falcon Hardtop, so featured a {{convert|111|in|mm|adj=mid}} wheelbase as opposed to the {{convert|121|in|mm|adj=mid}} wheelbase of the LTD. Both models were notable for their [[hidden headlights|concealed headlamps]], which were revealed when their vacuum-operated [[grille]] sections were retracted. The technology was similar to that found on earlier models of the American built [[Ford Thunderbird]]. Standard equipment on both the LTD and the Landau included integrated air conditioning, automatic transmission, electric windows, and a 351ci / 5.8L V8 engine.\n\nAlso in July 1975, Ford commenced a release of the Town Cars. These were 50th-Anniversary models, celebrating 50 years of Ford in Australia. They produced 250 of each in the LTD and Fairlane ranges. The Fairlanes in particular were optioned with LTD components, 15-inch wheels, leather interior, and electric windows to name some options. In the Fairlane, only a small handful was special-ordered with a 351 motor. All others were 302s. The LTD were 351-engine cars.\n\n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/23725628@N06/4626374317/in/photostream 50th Anniversary Model badge]\n\nAs the P5 was released during the ZF model run, it retained many ZF components. For example, the main interior upgrade from the Fairlane ZF to ZG was the turn signal stalk. The ZF had the older-style stalk with the high beam \"dipper\" switch on the floor. When the ZG Fairlane was released a big item was the new multifunction column stalk which incorporated the dipper switch and horn. The P5s, however, used the ZF-style stalk and still had a \"squeeze rim\" horn similar to Falcon GTs of the era.  Because the P6 LTD was not released until about five months after the ZH Fairlane, some of the last P5s actually had a few minor ZH parts fitted.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== ZH / P6 (1976\u20131979) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = Ford Fairlane ZH 500 (23531054516).jpg\n| image2 = Ford Fairlane ZH 500 (22930040893).jpg\n| footer =  1976\u201379 Ford Fairlane (ZH) 500\n}}\n\nThe ZH series addressed earlier complaints about the Fairlane being too close to the Falcon in May 1976. The designers retained the same central section from the upcoming XC [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] (including that car's new rear doors), but put on lengthened front and rear ends, giving the car more bulk and a luxury impression. The styling was reminiscent of the 1968 [[Mercury Marquis]]. The range-topping LTD went further upmarket with a fancy, [[Rolls-Royce car|Rolls-Royce]]-inspired grille (not dissimilar to that found on the [[Lincoln Continental Mark V|Continental Mark V]]. Another sign of the upmarket move was the 500 becoming the basic trim (the Custom was deleted), and the Fairlane Marquis being the upscale version. The Marquis was Ford's response to the [[Statesman (automobile)|Statesman Caprice]], which was introduced in 1974 as an LTD rival. ZH also moved to the use of the metric system to denote the engine sizes: the basic engine was known as the 4.9&nbsp;L, the other as the 5.8&nbsp;L. All ZH Marquises built after January 1979 had Borg-Warner differentials instead of the Ford 9-inch.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 200\n| image1 = Ford LTD (P6).jpg\n| image2 = 1978 Ford LTD (P6) sedan (23611729281).jpg\n| footer =  1976\u20131979 Ford LTD (P6)\n}}\n\nThe P6 Series LTD was introduced in September 1976.<ref>[http://www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au/ford_LTD_FB_technical_specifications.htm Ford LTD FB/P6 Technical Specifications].

This model was a leap ahead into the new decade, with squared-off lines and a six-light bodyshell clearly distinguishing Fairlane from the new XD Falcon of that year. The traditional quad headlights and distinctive vertically striped taillights further differentiated the luxury model from Falcon. The trim levels were deleted:  now, only a single Fairlane was available, with {{convert|302|cuin|L|1|order=flip|adj=mid}} or {{convert|351|cuin|L|1|order=flip|adj=mid}} V8 engine choices. In October, recognising the fuel crisis, Ford introduced a Fairlane with a {{convert|250|cuin|L|1|order=flip|adj=mid}} inline-six from the Falcon.\n\nThe LTD version of the ZJ surfaced in October 1979 as the FC Series, using the same wheelbase and body panels as the Fairlane. In mid-1980, the Falcon 4.1-litre alloy head engine was made optional, the first time the LTD was available in six-cylinder guise.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:1982 Ford LTD (FC) sedan (2015-05-29) 01.jpg|Ford LTD (FC)\nFile:1982 Ford LTD (FC) sedan (2015-05-29) 03.jpg|Ford LTD (FC)\nFile:1981 Ford FC LTD Cartier (6058256901).jpg|Ford LTD (FC) Cartier\n</gallery>\n\n==== {{anchor|ZK|FD}} ZK / FD (1982\u20131984) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width = 200\n| image1 = 1982-1984 Ford Fairlane (ZK) sedan (2012-01-15) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1982-1984 Ford Fairlane (ZK) sedan (2012-01-15) 02.jpg\n| footer = 1982\u20131984 Ford Fairlane (ZK)\n}}\n\nThe ZK series of March 1982 had the deletion of the 5.8-L V8, which was the first warning the company would soon drop [[V8 engine|V8s]] from the local line-up. Minor changes were made to grille and taillights, but otherwise the external changes were negligible. In March 1983, the 4.9-L V8 was deleted, too, with Ford introducing a [[fuel injection|fuel-injected]] version of the six to take its place, claiming the new engine had  acceleration figures equivalent to the V8.\n\nThe main notable mechanical change was the introduction of the coil sprung, watts link-located rear axle, one of the best live rear-axle configurations.\n\nThe LTD FC series was updated to and designated FD in March 1982 with the V8 engine option deleted the following year.\n{{clear}}\n\n==== {{anchor|ZL|FE}} ZL / FE (1984\u20131988) ====\n[[File:1984-1986 Ford ZL Fairlane sedan (2011-01-05) 02.jpg|thumb|Ford Fairlane (ZL)]]\n\nThe revised ZL series of 1985 (launched October 1984) kept the two six-cylinder engine options; only at the end of 1986 was the carburettor version of the Fairlane deleted. The ZL again carried over all external panels, but now had integrated headlights with clear indicators, full wrap-around bumpers, and new taillights. Inside, a full digital dashboard was introduced with push-button controls at either end of the instrument binnacle. The FE series LTD was also released in October 1984.<ref>The Red Book Used Car Price Guide, November 1985, page 57</ref>\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:1987 Ford LTD (FE) sedan (2015-07-14) 01.jpg|Ford LTD (FE)\nFile:1987 Ford LTD (FE) sedan (2015-07-14) 02.jpg|Ford LTD (FE)\n</gallery>\n{{clear}}\n\n=== Fourth generation ===\n==== NA / DA (1988\u20131991) ====\n[[File:1989-1991 Ford DA II LTD sedan (2010-12-28).jpg|thumb|right|Ford LTD (DA II)]]\n{{multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1990 Ford Fairlane (NA II) sedan (26021769001).jpg\n| image2 = 1990 Ford Fairlane (NA II) sedan (2010-07-25).jpg\n| footer = Ford Fairlane (NA II)\n}}\n\nJune 1988 had the next major revision; the Fairlane's straight edges gave way to gentle curves, based on the EA26 platform Falcon. The philosophy was the same - a long-wheelbase Falcon with a six-light body. The 4.1-L six was heavily revised, becoming a 3.9-L unit with improved fuel economy and power. These models were part of the EA26 development programme and platform (E for the market segment, A for Australia, 26 the project code). Therefore, officially they were EA26s, but colloquially, Ford aficionados prefer a two-letter code. Hence, the new Fairlanes were given the NA series code.\n\nThe equivalent LTDs came on stream as the DA series in June 1988. Like the previous generation, all N-series Fairlanes and D-series LTDs were built on the Falcon/Fairmont station-wagon platform, and this legacy is most noticeable in the disproportionally narrow station-wagon rear doors on what was meant to be a limousine and in a car that otherwise caters well for rear-seat passengers with a large amount of interior seating and legroom space. Nonetheless, these large sedans were \"limousine enough\" to be one of the most common platforms used by Australian body-building companies to make stretch limousines.\n\nRevisions from November 1989 for the 1990 model year had the release of the NA II and DAII, the most notable change being the fitting of a four-speed, rather than three-speed, automatic transmission (since the Fairlane's debut, it had a three-speed).\n\nAlthough Ford Australia's former official historian, the late Adrian Ryan, was emphatic, officially, an NB series Fairlane never existed, at least one early 1989 prototype fitted with a four-speed automatic escaped from the factory bearing a compliance plate marked \"NB\" and was registered as an \"NB Fairlane\". Ford also produced an alloy wheel identification-guide poster for its parts counters listing one wheel as being for an \"NB Sportsman Fairlane\" and at one point the Series II NA likely was going to be called the NB. Third-party parts suppliers also often list both an \"NB Fairlane\" an \"NB \u2013 Series II Fairlane\" in their parts catalogues adding to the NB mystery. DOTARS (the Commonwealth Department of Transport and Regional Services) has no record of giving Ford approval to use an \"NB Fairlane\" compliance plate for a production model which might explain Ford's reluctance to officially acknowledge the \"NB\". {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}{{original research inline|date=April 2012}}\n\n==== NC / DC (1991\u20131995) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1994 Ford Fairlane (NC II) Ghia sedan (2011-11-30) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 1994 Ford Fairlane (NC II) Ghia sedan (2011-11-30) 02.jpg\n| footer = 1993 Ford Fairlane (NC II) Ghia sedan\n}}\n\n[[File:1994 Ford LTD (DC II) sedan (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|thumb|right|1994 Ford LTD (DC II)]]\n\nAugust 1991 had the news that many Fairlane/LTD purists had awaited: the reintroduction of the V8 in the NC Fairlane and DC-series LTD. Ford had never recovered from deleting the V8s in the 1980s and bowed to public pressure with its reintroduction. The 5.0-L engine was not identical to the one used in the United States Mustang and other passenger cars. For reason of better durability and perhaps cost, it was the Canadian-made Windsor engine used in the North American light truck and 4WD models. To meet the needs of the space required for a right-drive steering column, its inlet manifold was reversed. Again to meet the conversion to right-hand drive and the rerouted inlet ducting, air box, and air conditioning lines, the Australian-installed engines also had most of their serpentine belt-driven accessories on opposite side to the US/North American models. As Australian enthusiasts often found to their frustration, these subtle changes often meant that many Ford Racing/SVO add-on bits, like the available superchargers, were not exactly the bolt-on items they were in North America. The inline six continued. The NC also introduced a higher-spec Fairlane, called the Fairlane Ghia, and the V8 was available in this model.\n\nThe 1992 NC II and DC IIs redesignated the 3.9-L engine a \"4.0-litre\", but trim levels remained the same. To appeal to younger buyers, Ford briefly sold a Fairlane Sportsman Ghia in 1993 with a \"Tickford\"-tuned 4.0-L six used in the Falcon XR6.\nA second, even smaller update, known as the NC III, arrived in August 1993. It is the equivalent to the ED series Falcon, adopting the new \"ozone safe\" R134a air conditioning refrigerant. The base Fairlane model was also discontinued, leaving only the Fairlane Ghia.\n\nFrom March 1994 production, the NC received additional changes - the fitment of a leather-wrapped steering wheel, body-coloured bumpers and side protection strips, new-design alloy wheels, and a [[hood ornament|bonnet ornament]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://fordfalconfacts.com/model-specs/fairlane-ltd/nc-fairlane-dc-ltd-1991-1995/ | title = NC Fairlane / DC LTD | publisher = Falcon Facts | accessdate = 14 April 2010}}</ref>\n\nAn idea proposed in the late 1980s was a Fairlane wagon. Most likely, had it entered production, it would have used the Falcon wagon (which rode on the Fairlane's wheelbase) body, coupled with the Fairlane's front clip.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}{{original research inline|date=November 2009}}\n\nIn the early 1990s, the Falcon utilities were still of the previous-generation XF. A prototype EB Falcon utility was made which looked Fairlane-based. To impart a look of solidness, the ute had a Fairlane frontal treatment. It did not enter production.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==== NF / DF (1995\u20131996) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal\n| image1 = Ford Fairlane Ghia (4).jpg | width1 = 180\n| image2 = 1995-1996 Ford LTD (DF) sedan (2011-03-23).jpg  | width2 = 242\n| footer = Ford Fairlane Ghia (NF; left) and Ford LTD (DF; right)\n}}\n\nThe Fairlane and LTD received a major front and rear restyle in March 1995 (EA77 series in Ford-speak), coinciding with the EF Falcon, and remained on the same platform. The new NF Fairlanes and DF LTDs were longer and curvier, hiding their 1980s origins reasonably well. The exterior design was more ornamental compared to the relatively clean NAs to NCs. The Fairlane Sportsman reappeared for 1996, with the same formula as 1993, with the 4.0-L six.{{Clear}}\n\n==== NL / DL (1996\u20131999) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 1998 Ford Fairlane (NL) Ghia sedan (24141149516).jpg\n| image2 = 1998 Ford Fairlane (NL) Ghia sedan (24059154062).jpg\n| footer =  Ford Fairlane (NL) Ghia\n}}\n\n[[File:1997 Ford LTD (DL) sedan (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|thumb|right|Ford LTD (DL)]]\nIn September 1996, the revised NL Fairlanes and DL LTDs appeared. In 1997, Ford introduced a higher Fairlane Concorde trim, with the same 4.0- and 5.0-L engine choices. No Sportsman variant of the Fairlane was offered.\n\nFor customers, five Dealer modified NL Series Fairlanes from Sydney and Melbourne utilised parts from the 5.0-litre [[Mustang Cobra]] and Australian delivered [[Special Vehicle Operations|SVO]] parts due to the limited edition run of the Fairlane by Tickford and customers wanting to maintain the Luxury look but sport the GT's performance.  The rounded body lines were reminiscent of the US-market Ford Taurus, while the front end styling was similar to the Lincoln Town Car.\n\nFord expanded the Fairlane range greatly in 1998. Beginning with the Ghia, also a basic Concorde (six-cylinder) and Concorde Ghia (V8) were offered. A [[Tickford Vehicle Engineering|Tickford]]-modified version was also available, with the larger engine, as well as a luxurious Fairlane Special Edition Ghia.\n\nThe NL and DL series were the last models to come equipped with automatic self-leveling rear suspension.\n{{clear}}\n\n[https://www.dropbox.com/s/z8ulok3bqmesxrz/20200409_102715.jpg?dl=0] \n\nThe New Zealand Government also used the NL Fairlane Ghia as their designated Crown Limousines. All Crown Fairlanes were mostly painted Amaretto (a few in white) and were fitted with silver chonchorde 16 inch wheels, 6 disc cd stacker electric adjust drivers seat and New Zealand fitted flag pole mounts on the front guards. \n\nAll of the Fairlane Ghias used by the New Zealand Government were fitted with the factory 4.0L six cylinder engine producing 165kw. The LTD was also used with only a few being V8 models. The LTD Crown Cars were a range of colours including Dynamic White, Argon Silver and Mocha Foam. The NL and DL Crown cars all sported special government licence plates starting with CR404 and continuing in numerical order to CR437. Most crown cars were retired after 3 years of service. The Fairlane and LTD had been used by the New Zealand Government since the 1970s through to 2010s where the Ford brand was replaced with BMW 7 series. \n\nThe New Zealand Government still uses CR registration plates on their current Crown Cars.\n\nPlease note, pre-facelift NF and DF Fairlanes were also used by the New Zealand Government.\n\n=== Fifth generation ===\n==== AU (1999\u20132003) ====\n[[File:2001 Ford Fairlane (AU II) Ghia sedan (2015-07-24) 01.jpg|thumb|Ford Fairlane (AU II) Ghia]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | width = 200\n| image1 = 2002 Ford LTD (AU II) sedan (2010-07-05) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 2002 Ford LTD (AU II) sedan (2010-07-05) 02.jpg\n| footer = 2000\u20132003 Ford LTD (AU II)\n}}\n\nFord introduced its \"[[New Edge]]\" look to the AU series Fairlane in February 1999, with some success, though the EA169 platform was considered a flop, allowing rival [[Holden]] to overtake the company in the sales of full-sized cars. The AU LTD was released 3 months later in May.\n\nThe AU Fairlane and LTD models were the first long-wheelbase sedans to share a model code with the Falcon. They had [[Lincoln Town Car]] styling cues, especially around the [[C-pillar]]. The range was pared back to just two models, the Fairlane Ghia and the LTD, although a limited-edition Fairlane Millennium Ghia was also offered in January 2000.<ref>[http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/carfamilytree?ReadForm&ID=D62DD4AB47EC387FCA257125001A1418 Ford AU Fairlane]. Retrieved 9 August 2010.</ref> The flagship LTD model was exported to [[Fiji]] and to its traditional export market, New Zealand. A small number of LTDs were exported to the United Kingdom, where they were converted into hearses and limousines.\n\nA high-performance variant of the AU Fairlane was released in 1999 as the [[Tickford Vehicle Engineering|FTE TL50]]. <!-- Its more rate edition is the T3 (based on the [[Ford AU Falcon|Falcon AU III]]) of which only three were produced.{{clarify|date=April 2015}}\n\n -->Ford brought forward revisions to the Falcon and Fairlane ranges when market acceptance of the new cars proved poor in July 2000. The 2001 model year AU II models featured some improvements, and another limited edition was offered: the 75th Anniversary Ghia in October, with the same engine choices as before. The Sportsman Ghia was revived in March 2001 and lasted for more than one model year this time, remaining in the range to the end of 2002.\n\n==== BA (2003\u20132005) ====\n{{multiple image\n| align = right | direction = horizontal | image1 = 2003-2005 Ford BA Fairlane G220 sedan 01.jpg | width1 = 165\n| image2 = 2003-2005 Ford BA Fairlane G220 sedan (2011-03-09).jpg | width2 = 210\n| footer = 2003\u20132005 Ford Fairlane (BA) G220\n}}\n\nFord's new attempt to battle Holden came in July 2003 with the BA series. The BA Fairlanes and LTDs were closer to the Falcon in looks, even sharing the taillights. The 5.0-L gave way to the larger 5.4-L [[Ford Modular engine#5.4 L|Modular]] V8, already used in the US From this point the LTD was no longer offered with a six-cylinder engine.\n\nTo capture younger buyers, the Fairlane G220 (denoting its {{convert|220|kW|hp|adj=mid}} power output at 4,750&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|472|Nm|lbft}} of torque from 3,250\u20134,000&nbsp;rpm) took the place of the Fairlane Sportsman, and featured the larger engine only. The traditional automatic gearbox was replaced by a [[tiptronic|sequential automatic]]. Unique to the G220 were 17-inch Elegance alloy wheels, ebony headlight bezels with unique lens, and redline leather seats with warm charcoal, perforated leather inserts.\n\nThe Fairlane Ghia continued as the six-cylinder base model, but came standard with colour ICC screen, asix-CD stack, 11-speaker Premium Sound, 7-way adjustable leather seats, and woodgrain inserts.\n\nThe LTD was further distinguished from the Ghia by having the 5.4-L V8 engine, sunroof, 17-inch alloy wheels, LTD badging, 10-way adjustable front seats, bolstered rear seats, [[satellite navigation]], and auto-dimming rear-vision mirror.<ref>{{cite web |last=Torr |first=Feann |year=2003 |url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/motoring/news_reports/xfd_fairlane.htm |title=First Drive: BA Ford Fairlane |publisher=Web Wombat |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nBrakes were the same as on the Falcon, with Fairlanes coming standard with [[electronic brakeforce distribution]] and [[traction control]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mynrma.com.au/motoring-services/reviews/car-reviews/ford/fairlane-ghia-ba-g220-ltd.htm |title=Ford Fairlane Ghia BA G220 & LTD Car Review |publisher=[[NRMA]] |date=1 March 2004 |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nFollowing Ford Australia's introduction of the BA II Falcon in October 2004, facelifted versions of the Fairlane Ghia, Fairlane G220, and LTD were introduced in March 2005. The changes were mainly cosmetic, but nevertheless significant, and were carried over in the subsequent BF model ranges. The facelifted Fairlane was headlined by a more heavily chromed exterior, including chrome rub strips, a new chromed rear appliqu\u00e9,  and on Fairlane Ghia and LTD, chromed wing mirror covers. The G220 was given new-design seven-spoke alloy wheels, while Fairlane Ghia and LTD added two-toned paint to their side skirts and lower valances.\n\nFor the BA II interior, the black leather seats and leather section of the door trims were replaced with new leather trim dubbed China Beige. The Ghia and G220 gained an eight-way power driver\u2019s seat with memory function. The G220 was given a leather-wrapped sports steering wheel, and the Ghia a Rhui Maple woodgrain and leather steering wheel, and the LTD gained a Stone Maple woodgrain and leather steering wheel.\n\nWhile the only BA II mechanical change was the addition of Sports Control Blade rear-suspension tune for the base Ghia and top-shelf LTD, a DVD rear entertainment system became standard for the LTD, exchangeable for a sunroof.\n\nAn interior upgrade that would be carried over in its entirety to the subsequent BF range was the change from black to brushed silver instrument dials and dash clock, and the silver shifter surround, centre cup holder, and ICC fascia became \"piano black\" with the ICC buttons changed accordingly from black to silver. Chrome door handles, vent tips, and door lock barrels were also added.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pettendy |first=Marton |date=4 February 2005 |url=http://www.goauto.com.au/mellor/mellor.nsf/story2/F5855C5E817D447CCA256F9D007C8CFA |title=Comfort is king in Ford's fresh Fairlane |work=GoAuto |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref> The original woodgrain trim was retained until the BF.\n\n==== BF (2005\u20132007) ====\n[[File:2007 Ford Fairlane (BF) Ghia sedan (2015-07-24).jpg|thumb|2005\u20132007 Ford Fairlane (BF) Ghia]]\n{{multiple image | align = right | direction = horizontal\n| image1 = 2006 Ford LTD (BF) sedan (2015-07-24) 01.jpg\n| image2 = 2006 Ford LTD (BF) sedan (2015-07-24) 02.jpg \n| footer = 2005\u20132007 Ford LTD (BF)\n}}\n\nThe BF series Fairlane and LTD models were introduced in October 2005, with the Fairlane G220 renamed the Fairlane G8. Externally, the BF was outwardly identical to the BA Mark II, but fine tunings to steering, suspension, soundproofing and undercarriage were made. Fuel economy was also improved. Across the whole BF range, the taillight lenses were slightly changed in appearance. The Ghia went from 16-inch to 17-inch alloy wheels as standard.\n\nInterior-wise, the only changes from the upgrades introduced in the BA Mark II were the replacement of the woodgrain inserts with \"satin chrome\" inserts. This colour scheme was the same for all BF Fairlane variants. The BF Ghia and LTD came with black leather seats or China beige leather seats with eight-way adjustable drivers seat and six-way adjustable passenger seat.\n\nThe G8 featured an eight-cylinder engine with improved exhaust system and an additional knock sensor, producing  {{convert|230|kW|hp}} at 5,350&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|500|Nm|lbft}} of torque at 3,500&nbsp;rpm.<ref>[http://www.privatefleet.com.au/buying-new-car/car-reviews/ford/ford-fairlane-review/ Ford Fairlane at www.privatefleet.com.au]. Retrieved 3 November 2010</ref> It was equipped with a six-speed ZF sports automatic transmission and 2.53:1 (and not for 2.73:1 as some would mistake it) nonlimited-slip final differential ratio. The G8 was distinguished by its 17-inch five-spoke alloy wheels with its firmer suspension and lower profile (225/50) tyres, 'Redline' leather seats with warm charcoal perforated-leather inserts, perforated leather-wrapped steering wheel with brushed aluminium-style inserts, perforated leather-wrapped gearshift with satin inserts, and ebony headlight bezels.\n\nIn addition to having the V8 engine, the LTD featured 17-inch seven-spoke alloy wheels, satellite navigation, ten-way power adjustable front seats with driver's seat memory settings, bolstered rear seats, rear seat DVD player and monitor, front fog lights, a power sunroof, electrochromic (auto-dimming) rear view mirror, a Stone Maple woodgrain and leather-wrapped steering wheel, embroidered floor mats, woodgrain gear shift, and Rabbit Rose woodgrain finishes.<ref>http://australiancar.reviews/reviews.php#!content=review&make=Ford&model=LTD&gen=1044</ref>\n\nIn May 2007, it was announced that production of the Fairlane and LTD would cease as a decline in sales in its market segment rendered continued production of long-wheelbase models unsustainable.<ref>[http://www.theage.com.au/news/news/end-of-road-for-fairlaneltd/2007/05/10/1178390443278.html End of road for Fairlane/LTD] Retrieved from www.theage.com.au on 5 July 2010</ref> The last Fairlane was produced on 13 December 2007.<ref>[http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/ford-farewells-fairlane-20071213-142tp.html Ford farewells Fairlane] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325180354/http://news.drive.com.au/drive/motor-news/ford-farewells-fairlane-20071213-142tp.html |date=25 March 2012 }} Retrieved from www.drive.com.au on 5 July 2010</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n== Australian sales figures ==\n{| class = \"wikitable\"\n|+ Sales in Australia\n!

The ''Barca de Amburgo'' foundered south west of the Fair Isle, but was able to split her crew between ''El Gran Grifon'' and the ''Trinidad Valencera'' (later wrecked in Irish waters).
