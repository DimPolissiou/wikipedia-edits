A national action plan had also been firmly set for the integration of the 240,000 women still lacking Dutch language fluency, including a program to bring language lessons to rural women in their homes. Finally, a Rural Participation Team had been established, composed of thirty socially and economically successful immigrant women who committed to be available as liaisons between rural immigrant women and various Dutch institutions.<ref> NICIS Institute, \u201cParticipatie van Vrouwen uit Etnische Minderheidsgroepen\u201d [http://www.kiemnet.nl/dossiers/socialecohesie/Arbeidsparticipatie/PaVEM-Pagina_1016.html] (in Dutch)</ref><ref> Language Lessons In Your Home (Taallessen aan Huis) [http://www.taallesaanhuis.nl/] (in Dutch)</ref><ref> Dutch Wikipedia page on PaVEM [[:nl:PaVEM]] (in Dutch)</ref> \n\nThe committee thus ceased to exist with its previous membership and as a government project, but a new NGO, a foundation called PaFemme, was formed to continue PaVEM's work.

Rural structures had also been put in place spanning public sector, private sector, and social movement participants. A national action plan had also been firmly set for the integration of the 240,000 women still lacking Dutch language fluency, including a program to bring language lessons to rural women in their homes. Finally, a Rural Participation Team had been established, composed of thirty socially and economically successful immigrant women who committed to be available as liaisons between rural immigrant women and various Dutch institutions.<ref> NICIS Institute, \u201cParticipatie van Vrouwen uit Etnische Minderheidsgroepen\u201d [http://www.kiemnet.nl/dossiers/socialecohesie/Arbeidsparticipatie/PaVEM-Pagina_1016.html] (in Dutch)</ref><ref> Language Lessons In Your Home (Taallessen aan Huis) [http://www.taallesaanhuis.nl/] (in Dutch)</ref><ref> Dutch Wikipedia page on PaVEM [[:nl:PaVEM]] (in Dutch)</ref> \n\nThe committee thus ceased to exist with its previous membership and as a government project, but a new NGO, a foundation called PaFemme, was formed to continue PaVEM's work.
