For example, certain [[autoimmune disease]]s may occur predominantly in one sex, for unknown reasons. 90% of [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] cases are women, whereas [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] is more common in men. Gender-based medicine, also called \"gender medicine\", is the field of medicine that studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease. Traditionally, medical research has mostly been conducted using the male body as the basis for clinical studies. Similar findings are also reported in the sport medicine literature where males typically account for >60% of the individuals studied.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Where are all the female participants in Sports and Exercise Medicine research?|journal = European Journal of Sport Science|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1536-7290|pmid = 24766579|pages = 847\u2013851|volume = 14|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/17461391.2014.911354|first = Joseph T.|last = Costello|first2 = Francois|last2 = Bieuzen|first3 = Chris M.|last3 = Bleakley|url = https://eprints.qut.edu.au/69202/3/69202.pdf}}</ref> The findings of these studies have often been applied across the sexes and healthcare providers have assumed a uniform approach in treating both male and female patients.

These can be of several types, including direct and indirect, direct being the direct result of differences prescribed by the Y-chromosome (due to the [[SRY gene]]), and indirect being characteristics influenced indirectly (e.g., hormonally) by the Y-chromosome. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is a term for the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] difference between males and females of the same species.\n\nDirect sex differences follow a [[bimodal distribution]]. Through the process of [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]] (with rare exceptions), each individual is created with zero or one Y-chromosome. The complementary result for the X-chromosome follows, either a double or a single X. Therefore, direct sex differences are usually binary in expression, although the deviations in more complex biological processes produce a menagerie of exceptions.\n\nIndirect sex differences are general differences as quantified by [[empirical data]] and [[statistics|statistical]] analysis. Most differing characteristics will conform to a [[bell distribution|bell-curve]] (i.e., normal) distribution which can be broadly described by the mean (peak distribution) and standard deviation (indicator of size of range). Often only the mean or mean difference between sexes is given. This may or may not preclude overlap in distributions. {{synthesis inline span|For example, most [[males]] are taller than most [[females]],<ref name=\"Gustafsson\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustafsson A, Lindenfors P|lastauthoramp=yes | year=2004 | title=Human size evolution: no allometric relationship between male and female stature | journal=Journal of Human Evolution | volume=47 | pages=253\u2013266 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.07.004 | pmid=15454336 | issue=4}}</ref> but an individual female could be shorter than an individual male.

Using results from a review of 46 meta-analyses, she found that 78% of gender differences were small or close to zero. A few exceptions were some motor behaviors (such as throwing distance) and some aspects of sexuality (such as attitudes about casual sex), which show the largest gender differences.

An observable difference in crime rates between men and women might be due to social and cultural factors, crimes going unreported, or to biological factors (for example, [[testosterone]] or sociobiological theories). Taking the nature of the crime itself into consideration may also be a factor. Crime can be measured by such data as arrest records, imprisonment rates, and surveys. However, not all crimes are reported or investigated.

For example, certain [[autoimmune disease]]s may occur predominantly in one sex, for unknown reasons. 90% of [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] cases are women, whereas [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] is more common in men. Gender-based medicine, also called \"gender medicine\", is the field of medicine that studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease. Traditionally, medical research has mostly been conducted using the male body as the basis for clinical studies. Similar findings are also reported in the sport medicine literature where males typically account for >60% of the individuals studied.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Where are all the female participants in Sports and Exercise Medicine research?|journal = European Journal of Sport Science|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1536-7290|pmid = 24766579|pages = 847\u2013851|volume = 14|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/17461391.2014.911354|first = Joseph T.|last = Costello|first2 = Francois|last2 = Bieuzen|first3 = Chris M.|last3 = Bleakley|url = https://eprints.qut.edu.au/69202/3/69202.pdf}}</ref> The findings of these studies have often been applied across the sexes and healthcare providers have assumed a uniform approach in treating both male and female patients.

These can be of several types, including direct and indirect, direct being the direct result of differences prescribed by the Y-chromosome (due to the [[SRY gene]]), and indirect being characteristics influenced indirectly (e.g., hormonally) by the Y-chromosome. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is a term for the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] difference between males and females of the same species.\n\nDirect sex differences follow a [[bimodal distribution]]. Through the process of [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]] (with rare exceptions), each individual is created with zero or one Y-chromosome. The complementary result for the X-chromosome follows, either a double or a single X. Therefore, direct sex differences are usually binary in expression, although the deviations in more complex biological processes produce a menagerie of exceptions.\n\nIndirect sex differences are general differences as quantified by [[empirical data]] and [[statistics|statistical]] analysis. Most differing characteristics will conform to a [[bell distribution|bell-curve]] (i.e., normal) distribution which can be broadly described by the mean (peak distribution) and standard deviation (indicator of size of range). Often only the mean or mean difference between sexes is given. This may or may not preclude overlap in distributions. {{synthesis inline span|For example, most [[males]] are taller than most [[females]],<ref name=\"Gustafsson\">{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustafsson A, Lindenfors P|lastauthoramp=yes | year=2004 | title=Human size evolution: no allometric relationship between male and female stature | journal=Journal of Human Evolution | volume=47 | pages=253\u2013266 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.07.004 | pmid=15454336 | issue=4}}</ref> but an individual female could be taller than an individual male.

A few exceptions were some motor behaviors (such as throwing distance) and some aspects of sexuality (such as attitudes about casual sex), which show the largest gender differences.

Some differing explanations include men's [[evolutionary]] tendency toward risk and violent behavior, sex differences in activity, [[social support]], and [[gender inequality]].\n\nDespite the difficulty of interpreting them, [[crime statistics]] may provide a way to investigate such a relationship from a gender differences perspective. An observable difference in crime rates between men and women might be due to social and cultural factors, crimes going unreported, or to biological factors (for example, [[testosterone]] or sociobiological theories). Taking the nature of the crime itself into consideration may also be a factor. Crime can be measured by such data as arrest records, imprisonment rates, and surveys. However, not all crimes are reported or investigated. Moreover, some studies show that men can have an overwhelming bias against reporting themselves to be the victims of a crime (particularly when victimized by a woman), and some studies have argued that men reporting [[intimate partner violence]] find disadvantageous biases in law enforcement.<ref>\"[M]en who are involved in disputes with their partners, whether as alleged victims or as alleged offenders or both, are disadvantaged and treated less favorably than women by the law-enforcement system at almost every step.\" Brown, G.

Owned by the [[Hearst Television]] subsidiary of [[Hearst Communications]], it is the second-oldest television station to remain with the company in all of its various iterations behind [[WBAL-TV]] in [[Baltimore]]. WISN's studios are located on North 19th Street on the west end of the [[Marquette University]] campus, and its transmitter is located at [[Parks of Milwaukee|Lincoln Park]] in the northeastern part of Milwaukee (next to the [[Weigel Broadcasting]] tower, which is used by [[CBS]] affiliate [[WDJT-TV]], channel 58, and its [[sister station]]s).\n\n==History==\n===First tenure with ABC===\nThe station first signed on the air on October 27, 1954, as '''WTVW''' (for its on-air slogan \"<u>W</u>isconsin's <u>T</u>ele<u>V</u>ision <u>W</u>indow\"). WTVW's transmitter building was built under a tent, as rain had threatened to delay construction. After the building was finished, a second tent was erected, and used for live automobile commercials, until it collapsed one day in early 1955. In early 1955, the station was purchased by the Hearst Corporation, publishers of ''The Milwaukee Sentinel'' and owners of [[WISN (AM)|WISN radio]] (1130 AM); the new owners changed channel 12's call letters to '''WISN-TV''', after its radio sister (whose calls were derived from now-defunct newspaper ''The Wisconsin News'', which merged with the ''Sentinel'' 15 years prior to its sign-on;<ref>\"Hearst acquires WTVW (TV) Milwaukee; [[NBC]] buys [[WVIT|WKNB-TV]] New Britain, Conn.\" ''[[Broadcasting and Cable|Broadcasting - Telecasting]]'', January 10, 1955, pg. 7.

The ''Journal'' also competed with the ''Sentinel'' (both of which were eventually consolidated into the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' in 1995) in broadcasting as owners of [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ radio]] (620 AM) and [[WTMJ-TV]] (channel 4), which Journal operated until April 1, 2015, when Journal and [[E.

In November 2014, the station unveiled their current logo with the call letters beneath the long-used \"12\" logo form and the ABC logo on the right side of the \"12\" number mark, the first with the ABC logo blended in for all uses, including for news and entertainment programming, and ending a long run where the station's call letters were rendered in [[Bank Gothic]] font.

Its success stems from hiring popular local anchors and reporters released from other stations, a stronger ABC schedule, and a period of change at rival WTMJ-TV due to NBC's weaker ratings and changes in its newsroom staff. The station's biggest hire came when longtime WTMJ anchor Mike Gousha joined channel 12 in 2007, a year after he retired as WTMJ's evening news anchor in order to focus on his new position as a distinguished fellow in law and public policy at Marquette University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.marquette.edu/cgi-bin/site.pl?10905&userID=4126|title=Michael R.

The format was repeated in October 2010 between the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and Republican nominees for governor and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].\n\nWISN has gradually expanded its newscast schedule since 2007, and is unusual in programming hour-long newscasts, starting that year with a Sunday at 10 p.m. broadcast and for a time, an hour-long Saturday 6 p.m. newscast (the 6:30&nbsp;p.m. half-hour currently features either ''[[On the Money (2013 TV series)|On the Money]]'' or ''12 Sports Saturday''). On July 30, 2010, WISN, like most of its ABC-affiliated sister stations under Hearst did on that date, added a one-hour extension of its weekend morning newscast from 8 to 9&nbsp;a.m. On September 6, 2010, WISN expanded its weekday morning newscast a half-hour early to 4:30&nbsp;a.m., extending the program to {{frac|2|1|2}} hours.<ref>http://www.tvnewscheck.com/link/2010/08/31/44873/wisn-expands-am-newscast-to-430{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn April 21, 2009, the station began using full-time pillarboxing with the station logo and callsign on the respective sides of the screen for newscasts and other standard-definition programming.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.milwaukeehdtv.org/forums/showpost.php?p=51744&postcount=5 |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720090850/http://www.milwaukeehdtv.org/forums/showpost.php?p=51744&postcount=5 |archive-date=July 20, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Afterwards, the station began to slowly implement [[16:9]] graphical elements; in March 2010, WISN-TV unveiled 16:9-optimized weather alert graphics to allow programs to continue to be shown in HD rather than force a downscale to a modified [[4:3]] mode in which the program was displayed in 3:3 (to much viewer complaint over the years, especially with ABC prime time programming), with the weather warnings taking up the remainder of the screen. [[News ticker]]s and logo bugs were also later upgraded; the only HD news segments until late June 2011 aired on its newscasts the day of the Summerfest \"Big Bang\" fireworks show, usually scenic and human interest pieces, along with Milwaukee Public Television co-productions. On October 10, 2010, the station began broadcasting its newscasts in 16:9 [[widescreen]] [[standard definition television|standard definition]], with the pillarboxes being removed.

The station utilizes two [[Doppler weather radar|weather radars]] as part of its \"Doppler 12 Radar Network\", using radar sites based at the [[National Weather Service]] forecast office in [[Sullivan, Wisconsin|Sullivan]], and atop [[Froedtert Hospital|Froedtert]]'s Community Memorial Hospital in [[Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|Menomonee Falls]], which is operated by the station.\n\nLongtime anchor Jerry Taff retired in May 2005, as WISN's newscasts began to climb in the ratings. Its success stems from hiring popular local anchors and reporters released from other stations, a stronger ABC schedule, and a period of change at rival WTMJ-TV due to NBC's weaker ratings and changes in its newsroom staff. The station's biggest hire came when longtime WTMJ anchor Mike Gousha joined channel 12 in 2007, a year after he retired as WTMJ's evening news anchor in order to focus on his new position as a distinguished fellow in law and public policy at Marquette University.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://law.marquette.edu/cgi-bin/site.pl?10905&userID=4126|title=Michael R.

The format was repeated in October 2010 between the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and Republican nominees for governor and [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]].\n\nWISN has gradually expanded its newscast schedule since 2007, and is unusual in programming hour-long newscasts, starting that year with a Sunday at 10 p.m. broadcast and for a time, an hour-long Saturday 6 p.m. newscast (the 6:30&nbsp;p.m. half-hour currently features either ''[[On the Money (2013 TV series)|On the Money]]'' or ''12 Sports Saturday''). On July 30, 2010, WISN, like most of its ABC-affiliated sister stations under Hearst did on that date, added a one-hour extension of its weekend morning newscast from 8 to 9&nbsp;a.m. On September 6, 2010, WISN expanded its weekday morning newscast a half-hour early to 4:30&nbsp;a.m., extending the program to {{frac|2|1|2}} hours.<ref>http://www.tvnewscheck.com/link/2010/08/31/44873/wisn-expands-am-newscast-to-430{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nOn April 21, 2009, the station began using full-time pillarboxing with the station logo and callsign on the respective sides of the screen for newscasts and other standard-definition programming.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.milwaukeehdtv.org/forums/showpost.php?p=51744&postcount=5 |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 22, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720090850/http://www.milwaukeehdtv.org/forums/showpost.php?p=51744&postcount=5 |archive-date=July 20, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Afterwards, the station began to slowly implement [[16:9]] graphical elements; in March 2010, WISN-TV unveiled 16:9-optimized weather alert graphics to allow programs to continue to be shown in HD rather than force a downscale to a modified [[4:3]] mode in which the program was displayed in 3:3 (to much viewer complaint over the years, especially with ABC prime time programming), with the weather warnings taking up the remainder of the screen. [[News ticker]]s and logo bugs were also later upgraded; the only HD news segments until late June 2011 aired on its newscasts the day of the Summerfest \"Big Bang\" fireworks show, usually scenic and human interest pieces, along with Milwaukee Public Television co-productions. On October 10, 2010, the station began broadcasting its newscasts in 16:9 [[widescreen]] [[standard definition television|standard definition]], with the pillarboxes being removed. Then on June 28, 2011, WISN-TV became the third station in Milwaukee (behind WTMJ-TV and WITI) to begin broadcasting its newscasts in high definition. Footage shot in-studio is broadcast in HD, while all news video from on-remote locations was initially upconverted to widescreen standard definition for broadcast. Since 2012, the station has upgraded its mobile units and field cameras to HD as equipment has needed replacement. In May 2013, the station unveiled its first HD skycam, overlooking the downtown [[Cathedral Square Park]].\n\nOn January 24, 2011, WISN-TV expanded its 10 p.m. newscast to one hour (becoming the third Hearst-owned station with an hour-long late local newscast, along with [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]'s [[KOAT]] and [[Honolulu]]'s [[KITV]]).<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/entertainment/111873334.html/ WISN-TV expands 10 p.m. news to one hour], ''[[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]]'', December 14, 2010.

The most noteworthy event during their time in Canada was the birth in 1943 of [[Princess Margriet]] at the [[The Ottawa Hospital|Ottawa Civic Hospital]]. The maternity ward was temporarily declared to be extraterritorial by the Canadian government, thereby allowing Princess Margriet's citizenship to be solely influenced by her mother's Dutch citizenship.<ref>{{cite news|title = Proclamation|url = http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/canada-gazette/093/001060-119.01-e.php?document_id_nbr=9450&f=g|newspaper = [[Canada Gazette]]|date = 26 December 1942|accessdate = 18 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=1943: Netherlands\u2019 Princess Margriet born in Ottawa - CBC Archives|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/1943-netherlands-princess-margriet-born-in-ottawa|website=CBC Archives|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=23 January 1992|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> In 1946, Juliana sent another 20,500 bulbs requesting that a display be created for the hospital, and promised to send 10,000 more bulbs each year.\n\n=== The festival begins ===\n[[File:Her Royal Highness Princess Margriet of the Netherlands in Ottawa.jpg|thumb|Princess Margriet returns to Ottawa to attend the Canadian Tulip Festival in May 2002.]]\nIn the years following Queen Juliana's original donation, Ottawa became famous for its tulips and in 1953 the [[Ottawa Board of Trade]] and photographer [[Malak Karsh]] organized the first \"Canadian Tulip Festival\". Queen Juliana returned to celebrate the festival in 1967, and Princess Margriet returned in 2002 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the festival.\n\n=== Outdoor music concerts ===\nFor many years, the festival featured a series of outdoor [[music]] concerts in addition to the tulips.\nThe 1972 festival saw [[Liberace]] give an opening concert, and at the 1987 festival, Canadian singer [[Alanis Morissette]] made her first appearance at the age of 12.<ref>[http://www.tulipfestival.ca/en/Education/E-History_of_CTF.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301021413/http://www.tulipfestival.ca/en/Education/E-History_of_CTF.pdf |date=March 1, 2006 }}</ref> [[The Trews]] first became widely known after opening for [[Big Sugar]] at the 2003 festival. Montreal's [[General Rudie]] also gained valuable exposure early in their career with a performance at the 2000 festival.\n\nAfter several years of cold and rainy weekends drove the festival to the brink of bankruptcy in 2006, the outdoor music concerts were discontinued.  Even though concert admission fees were a source of revenue for the festival, rainy weather contributed to low concert attendance on many occasions, making the concerts a heavy financial risk.\n\n=== 2007: Reorganisation ===\nIn 2007, the festival was reorganised under new leadership. The festival was redesigned to focus on promoting international friendship, the original symbolic role of the gift of tulips.

The most noteworthy event during their time in Canada was the birth in 1943 of [[Princess Margriet]] at the [[The Ottawa Hospital|Ottawa Civic Hospital]]. The maternity ward was temporarily declared to be extraterritorial by the Canadian government, thereby allowing Princess Margriet's citizenship to be solely influenced by her mother's Dutch citizenship.<ref>{{cite news|title = Proclamation|url = http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/databases/canada-gazette/093/001060-119.01-e.php?document_id_nbr=9450&f=g|newspaper = [[Canada Gazette]]|date = 26 December 1942|accessdate = 18 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=1943: Netherlands\u2019 Princess Margriet born in Ottawa - CBC Archives|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/1943-netherlands-princess-margriet-born-in-ottawa|website=CBC Archives|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|date=23 January 1992|accessdate=18 June 2017|language=en}}</ref> In 1946, Juliana sent another 20,500 bulbs requesting that a display be created for the hospital, and promised to send 10,000 more bulbs each year.\n\n=== The festival begins ===\n[[File:Her Royal Highness Princess Margriet of the Netherlands in Ottawa.jpg|thumb|Princess Margriet returns to Ottawa to attend the Canadian Tulip Festival in May 2002.]]\nIn the years following Queen Juliana's original donation, Ottawa became famous for its tulips and in 1953 the [[Ottawa Board of Trade]] and photographer [[Malak Karsh]] organized the first \"Canadian Tulip Festival\". Queen Juliana returned to celebrate the festival in 1967, and Princess Margriet returned in 2002 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the festival.\n\n=== Outdoor music concerts ===\nFor many years, the festival featured a series of outdoor [[music]] concerts in addition to the tulips.\nThe 1972 festival saw [[Liberace]] give an opening concert, and at the 1987 festival, Canadian singer [[Alanis Morissette]] made her first appearance at the age of 12.<ref>[http://www.tulipfestival.ca/en/Education/E-History_of_CTF.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060301021413/http://www.tulipfestival.ca/en/Education/E-History_of_CTF.pdf |date=March 1, 2006 }}</ref> [[The Trews]] first became widely known after opening for [[Big Sugar]] at the 2003 festival. Montreal's [[General Rudie]] also gained valuable exposure early in their career with a performance at the 2000 festival.\n\nAfter several years of cold and rainy weekends drove the festival to the brink of bankruptcy in 2006, the outdoor music concerts were discontinued.  Even though concert admission fees were a source of revenue for the festival, rainy weather contributed to low concert attendance on many occasions, making the concerts a heavy financial risk.\n\n=== 2007: Reorganisation ===\nIn 2007, the festival was reorganised under new leadership. The festival was redesigned to focus on promoting international friendship, the original symbolic role of the gift of tulips. Park admission charges were eliminated and a new feature called ''Celebr'''id\u00e9e''': a Celebration of Ideas'' was introduced.  Another component of the 2007 festival was a fund-raising effort in support of [[War Child (charity)|War Child]] Canada.\n\n=== Celebrid\u00e9e ===\nBeyond celebrating the tulip as a symbol of beauty and friendship, the Canadian Tulip Festival, through Celebrid\u00e9e, aims to present some of the most brilliant thinkers of our time speaking about ideas that matter. \n\t\nCelebrid\u00e9e has continued to grow since its inception in 2007. 2008's speakers included such diverse and thought-provoking individuals as Sir [[Salman Rushdie]], Wired Magazine's [[Chris Anderson (writer)|Chris Anderson]], Pulitzer Prize-winning author of ''[[Guns, Germs and Steel]]'' [[Jared Diamond]], and world-renowned pianist [[Angela Hewitt]].\n\n==Festival sites and themes==\n{| class=\"infobox bordered\" style=\"text-align:left\" cellpadding=4\n|+ style=\"line-height:150%\"|'''Recent Canadian Tulip Festival Themes'''\n|-\n|1994\n| A Tribute to the Origin Country of the Tulip - Turkey\n|-\n|1995\n| The Friendship That Flowered\n50th anniversary of the Liberation of the Netherlands\n|-\n|1996\n| Floral Tribute to Nice\n|-\n|1997\n| Floral Artistry of Japan\n|-\n|1998\n| A Celebration of Canada's Provinces and Territories\n|-\n|1999\n| Between Friends\n|-\n|2000\n| Tulips 2000: A Capital Celebration!\n|-\n|2001\n| Tulips Forever!

Masaryk was an opponent of capital punishment and had the privilege of commuting death sentences, one he exercised frequently. His successor [[Edvard Bene\u0161]] signed the death sentences for 8 people, incl. 3 for military [[treason]]. After his resignation 2 more criminals were executed before the occupation of the country.\n\n=== German occupation (1939\u20131945) ===\nDuring the time of [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation]] thousands were executed and hundreds of thousands were killed without any trial. Though the [[summary execution]]s happened only rarely (in comparation to other countries occupied by Germans), such occasions happened nearly every year (see the [[List of massacres in the Czech Republic#Massacres during World War II|massacres during World War]]). In Prague [[Pankr\u00e1c prison]] 1079 were [[guillotine]]d or hanged, about 550 were shot in [[Kobylisy Shooting Range|Prague-Kobylisy]], about 800 were shot or hanged in [[Brno]], about 300 were shot or hanged in [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt-Small Fortress]] etc. Hundreds of Czech people were also tried and executed in German prisons, such as Dresden (846 people) or [[Berlin-Pl\u00f6tzensee]] (677 people). Thousands other were killed by hanging, gas chambers or shot in the [[Nazi concentration camps]].<ref name=\"Fronta\">{{cite web|last1=\u0160\u00edr|first1=Vojt\u011bch|title=Popravi\u0161t\u011b v protektor\u00e1tu \u010cechy a Morava|url=http://www.fronta.cz/dotaz/popraviste-v-protektoratu-cechy-a-morava|website=Fronta.cz|accessdate=12 April 2017|language=Czech|date=10 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the period of German occupation, only 3 criminals were sentenced to death and executed by Czech courts.<ref name=\"Li\u0161ka\"/>\n\n=== Postwar retribution (1945\u20131948) ===\nAfter World War II, based on the [[Bene\u0161 decrees]], special courts at the local level ({{lang|cs|lidov\u00e9 soudy}}, ''people's courts'') were set up to punish [[war crimes]] and [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaboration]]. Until 1948 they sentenced 713 people to death. Another 10 people were executed for common crimes.<ref name=\"Li\u0161ka\"/>\n\n=== Communist Czechoslovakia (1948-1989) ===\nDuring the presidency of [[Klement Gottwald]] (1948\u201353) 237 people were executed, of whom over 190 for political crimes. Gottwald pardoned 18 people. Among the best known of those executed are [[Milada Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1]], a politician, hanged in 1950. The widely publicised [[Prague Trials]] with former party's [[general secretary]] [[Rudolf Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd]] resulted in 11 executions.<ref name=\"Li\u0161ka\"/>\n\nDuring this period hundreds of other people died due to cruel conditions in prisons and concentration camps such as the [[Concentration camp in J\u00e1chymov]].\n\nDuring the presidency of [[Anton\u00edn Z\u00e1potock\u00fd]] (1953\u201357) 94 people were executed. That figure fell to 87 people during [[Anton\u00edn Novotn\u00fd]]'s  presidency (1957\u201368), 14 people during the presidency of [[Ludv\u00edk Svoboda]] (1968\u20131975, including a period during which Prime Minister [[Lubom\u00edr \u0160trougal]] acted as President in ill Svodoba's absence) and then to 38 people during that of [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k]] (1975\u201389).<ref name=\"Li\u0161ka\"/>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1968 all executions were carried out in [[Pankr\u00e1c Prison]], [[Prague]]; after 1968 some took place in [[Bratislava]]. In 1956 the number of crimes punishable by death was reduced and mandatory review of sentences was introduced. In 1961 a law made the conditions for capital punishment more strict, with only especially brutal murders punishable by death. The last execution in Czechoslovakia took place on 8 June 1989, when [[\u0160tefan Svitek]] was hanged in Bratislava prison for triple murder; in today's Czech Republic the last executed person was [[Vladim\u00edr Lulek]], hanged on 2 February 1989 in Pankr\u00e1c Prison for murder of his wife and four children. The last person sentenced to death was Zden\u011bk Voc\u00e1sek, but his sentence was changed to life imprisonment in 1990.\n\n=== Abolition of the capital punishment ===\nSoon after the Communist party [[Velvet Revolution|fell from power]] in 1989 the new president [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] pushed the abolition of the capital punishment through parliament. A May 1990 criminal law reform replaced capital punishment with [[life imprisonment]]. Furthermore, in January 1991 capital punishment became prohibited by the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms]], which became part of the [[1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] constitutional law and since the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] remains part of the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Czech constitutional law]].\n\nCapital punishment in the [[Czech Republic]] is simultaneously prohibited by international legal obligations arising from the Czech Republic's membership of both the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[European Union]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071011104232/http://www.mvcr.cz/policie/udv/sesity/sesit2/sesit2.doc List of all people executed in Czechoslovakia, historical background, laws, bibliography] (in Czech, [[MS Word]] document, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071011104232/www.mvcr.cz/policie/udv/sesity/sesit2/sesit2.doc HTML version] by Google)\n{{capital punishment}}\n{{Capital punishment in Europe}}\n\n[[Category:Capital punishment by country|Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:Czech law]]\n[[Category:Death in the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:Human rights in the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:1989 disestablishments in Czechoslovakia]]\n[[Category:1918 establishments in Czechoslovakia]]\n[[Category:1787 disestablishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:1795 establishments in Europe]]\n", "text_old": "[[Capital punishment]] (''trest smrti'' in [[Czech language|Czech]]) is forbidden by the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms]] of the [[Czech Republic]] (part of the constitutional law of the Czech Republic) and is simultaneously prohibited by international legal obligations arising from the Czech Republic's membership of both the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[European Union]].\n\nHistorically the capital punishment was legal, and was used, when the [[Czech Socialist Republic|Czech Republic]] was part of [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovak Federation]], until the punishment was abolished by amendment of the federal criminal code in 1990.

The device in Pankr\u00e1c's \"death chamber\" was a simple [[noose]] attached to the wall with the remotely operated [[trapdoor]] in the floor.<ref name=\"aha\">{{cite journal|last1=Novotn\u00fd|first1=Petr|title=Rozhovor s posledn\u00edm \u010desk\u00fdm katem!

Masaryk was an opponent of capital punishment and had the privilege of commuting death sentences, one he exercised frequently. His successor [[Edvard Bene\u0161]] signed the death sentences for 8 people, incl. 3 for military [[treason]]. After his resignation 2 more criminals were executed before the occupation of the country.\n\n=== German occupation (1939\u20131945) ===\nDuring the time of [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation]] thousands were executed and hundreds of thousands were killed without any trial. Though the [[summary execution]]s happened only rarely (in comparation to other countries occupied by Germans), such occasions happened nearly every year (see the [[List of massacres in the Czech Republic#Massacres during World War II|massacres during World War]]). In Prague [[Pankr\u00e1c prison]] 1079 were [[guillotine]]d or hanged, about 550 were shot in [[Kobylisy Shooting Range|Prague-Kobylisy]], about 800 were shot or hanged in [[Brno]], about 300 were shot or hanged in [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt-Small Fortress]] etc. Hundreds of Czech people were also tried and executed in German prisons, such as Dresden (846 people) or [[Berlin-Pl\u00f6tzensee]] (677 people). Thousands other were killed by hanging, gas chambers or shot in the [[Nazi concentration camps]].<ref name=\"Fronta\">{{cite web|last1=\u0160\u00edr|first1=Vojt\u011bch|title=Popravi\u0161t\u011b v protektor\u00e1tu \u010cechy a Morava|url=http://www.fronta.cz/dotaz/popraviste-v-protektoratu-cechy-a-morava|website=Fronta.cz|accessdate=12 April 2017|language=Czech|date=10 March 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn the period of German occupation, only 3 criminals were sentenced to death and executed by Czech courts.<ref name=\"Li\u0161ka\"/>\n\n=== Postwar retribution (1945\u20131948) ===\nAfter World War II, based on the [[Bene\u0161 decrees]], special courts at the local level ({{lang|cs|lidov\u00e9 soudy}}, ''people's courts'') were set up to punish [[war crimes]] and [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaboration]]. Until 1948 they sentenced 713 people to death. Another 10 people were executed for common crimes.<ref name=\"Li\u0161ka\"/>\n\n=== Communist Czechoslovakia (1948-1989) ===\nDuring the presidency of [[Klement Gottwald]] (1948\u201353) 237 people were executed, of whom over 190 for political crimes. Gottwald pardoned 18 people. Among the best known of those executed are [[Milada Hor\u00e1kov\u00e1]], a politician, hanged in 1950. The widely publicised [[Prague Trials]] with former party's [[general secretary]] [[Rudolf Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd]] resulted in 11 executions.<ref name=\"Li\u0161ka\"/>\n\nDuring this period hundreds of other people died due to cruel conditions in prisons and concentration camps such as the [[Concentration camp in J\u00e1chymov]].\n\nDuring the presidency of [[Anton\u00edn Z\u00e1potock\u00fd]] (1953\u201357) 94 people were executed. That figure fell to 87 people during [[Anton\u00edn Novotn\u00fd]]'s  presidency (1957\u201368), 14 people during the presidency of [[Ludv\u00edk Svoboda]] (1968\u20131975, including a period during which Prime Minister [[Lubom\u00edr \u0160trougal]] acted as President in ill Svodoba's absence) and then to 38 people during that of [[Gust\u00e1v Hus\u00e1k]] (1975\u201389).<ref name=\"Li\u0161ka\"/>\n\nFrom 1954 to 1968 all executions were carried out in [[Pankr\u00e1c Prison]], [[Prague]]; after 1968 some took place in [[Bratislava]]. In 1956 the number of crimes punishable by death was reduced and mandatory review of sentences was introduced. In 1961 a law made the conditions for capital punishment more strict, with only especially brutal murders punishable by death. The last execution in Czechoslovakia took place on 8 June 1989, when [[\u0160tefan Svitek]] was hanged in Bratislava prison for triple murder; in today's Czech Republic the last executed person was [[Vladim\u00edr Lulek]], hanged on 2 February 1989 in Pankr\u00e1c Prison for murder of his wife and four children. The last person sentenced to death was Zden\u011bk Voc\u00e1sek, but his sentence was changed to life imprisonment in 1990.\n\n=== Abolition of the capital punishment ===\nSoon after the Communist party [[Velvet Revolution|fell from power]] in 1989 the new president [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] pushed the abolition of the capital punishment through parliament. A May 1990 criminal law reform replaced capital punishment with [[life imprisonment]]. Furthermore, in January 1991 capital punishment became prohibited by the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms]], which became part of the [[1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia|Czechoslovak]] constitutional law and since the [[dissolution of Czechoslovakia]] remains part of the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|Czech constitutional law]].\n\nCapital punishment in the [[Czech Republic]] is simultaneously prohibited by international legal obligations arising from the Czech Republic's membership of both the [[Council of Europe]] and the [[European Union]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071011104232/http://www.mvcr.cz/policie/udv/sesity/sesit2/sesit2.doc List of all people executed in Czechoslovakia, historical background, laws, bibliography] (in Czech, [[MS Word]] document, [https://web.archive.org/web/20071011104232/www.mvcr.cz/policie/udv/sesity/sesit2/sesit2.doc HTML version] by Google)\n{{capital punishment}}\n{{Capital punishment in Europe}}\n\n[[Category:Capital punishment by country|Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:Czech law]]\n[[Category:Death in the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:Human rights in the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:1989 disestablishments in Czechoslovakia]]\n[[Category:1918 establishments in Czechoslovakia]]\n[[Category:1787 disestablishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:1795 establishments in Europe]]\n", "name_user": "Chrism", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory and methods of capital punishment", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_Czech_Republic"}
