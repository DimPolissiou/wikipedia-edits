He finished the 2019 season in third place on the Race to Dubai standings, his career best finish to date.\n\nIn July 2015, when he won the [[Alstom Open de France]], Wiesberger became the most successful Austrian golfer on the European Tour with three tour victories. He has since extended his record and is a seven-time winner on the European Tour.\n\n==Amateur career==\nWiesberger was born in [[Vienna]]. He won several amateur tournaments, including three Austrian Amateur Stroke Play Championships from 2004 to 2006, the Austrian Amateur Match Play Championship in 2004 and the Austrian Youths Championship in 2004 and 2005. He represented his country at the 2004 and 2006 [[Eisenhower Trophy]]. He turned professional in 2006.\n\n==Professional career==\nWiesberger played on the [[Challenge Tour]] in 2007 and 2008. He earned his [[European Tour]] card for the 2009 season through [[qualifying school]]. He was unable to win enough money during his rookie season to retain his card and returned to the Challenge Tour. Wiesberger won two events, the [[Allianz Golf Open de Lyon]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europeantour.com/challengetour/season=2010/tournamentid=2010746/news/newsid=125331.html |title=Wiesberger wins with a wondrous 62 |publisher=[[PGA European Tour]] |date=11 July 2010 |accessdate=13 July 2010}}</ref> and the [[Allianz Golf Open du Grand Toulouse]], en route to a 5th-place finish on the Order of Merit, good enough for a European Tour card for 2011.\n\nWiesberger recorded four top-10 finishes in his return to the European Tour in 2011 including two runner up finishes. He finished 64th on the Order of Merit. Wiesberger claimed his maiden title on the European Tour in 2012 at the [[Ballantine's Championship]], twice setting the course record and winning the championship by the margin of five strokes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europeantour.com/europeantour/season=2012/tournamentid=2012024/news/newsid=158747.html#bernd+toasts+maiden+victory |title=Bernd Toasts Maiden Victory |publisher=[[PGA European Tour]] |date=29 April 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> The win moved him into the top 100 of the [[Official World Golf Ranking]]. In July 2012, Wiesberger won his second title of the year and of his European Tour career at the [[Lyoness Open]], held in his home country of Austria. He started the final round four strokes back of [[Thorbj\u00f8rn Olesen]], but a round of 65 seven under par, including birdies at three of the last four holes secured a three stroke victory. He became only the second Austrian to win his home Open, after [[Markus Brier]] in 2006. After the victory he said: \"It's the best day of my life so far. It seems like it went my way, especially the last two holes. I had such a great country and such great fans backing me. I'm very proud to be following in such big footsteps [as Brier]. I'm sure I'm not going to be the last home winner.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europeantour.com/europeantour/season=2012/tournamentid=2012054/news/newsid=168919.html#wiesberger+seals+fairytale+triumph |title=Wiesberger wins his home Open |publisher=[[PGA European Tour]] |date=28 July 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 May 2013, Wiesberger won his sixth professional tournament and the second of his career in Asia, beating reigning [[The Open Championship|Open Champion]] [[Ernie Els]] by a shot at the [[CIMB Niaga Indonesian Masters]] for his first win of the season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/golf/top-stories/Bernd-Wiesberger-wins-CIMB-Niaga-Indonesian-Masters/articleshow/19894945.cms |title=Wiesberger wins CIMB Niaga Indonesian Masters |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=5 May 2013 |accessdate=5 May 2013 |first=V |last=Anand}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, he lost a playoff at his home event, the [[Austrian Open (golf)|Austrian Open]]. However, he earned enough world ranking points to place 60th in the world and become the first Austrian to play in the [[2014 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]. Wiesberger had the last guaranteed position for entry and it was the event immediately after the Austrian Open. At the [[2014 PGA Championship]], Wiesberger was one off the lead of [[Rory McIlroy]] after 54 holes at [[Valhalla Golf Club]] and was paired with McIlroy in the final round of the championship. However, Wiesberger shot a three-over par round on the final day and finished in a tie for 15th.\n\nIn May 2015, Wiesberger lost in a three-man sudden-death playoff at the [[Dubai Duty Free Irish Open]]. He started the final round two strokes behind [[S\u00f8ren Kjeldsen]] and despite shooting a 74, entered the playoff with Kjeldsen and [[Eddie Pepperell]]. Kjeldsen won on the first extra hole with a birdie. Wiesberger has lost all three sudden-death playoffs in his European Tour career. On 5 July Wiesberger would win his third event on the European Tour when he took the [[Alstom Open de France]]. Wiesberger took victory by three strokes over Englishmen [[James Morrison (golfer)|James Morrison]], Wiesberger had also started the round four strokes back of South African [[Jaco Van Zyl]] but stormed back with final round 66. With this being his third win on tour, he became the most successful Austrian golfer in the history of the European Tour, moving ahead of [[Markus Brier]], who had two wins; [[Martin Wiegele]] was the only other Austrian with a win.\n\nWiesberger claimed his fourth European Tour victory at the 2017 [[Shenzhen International (golf)|Shenzhen International]]. He won with a birdie at the first extra hole, in a sudden-death playoff, to defeat [[Tommy Fleetwood]]. Fleetwood had earlier shot a final round of 63 to come from eight strokes back and set the clubhouse lead. Wiesberger had to scramble for pars on the back nine and then almost holed his approach shot on the 72nd hole for the victory. In the playoff, Wiesberger found trouble from the tee, but hit his approach to within five feet for birdie to claim victory. His fourth victory came in his 200th event on the European Tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europeantour.com/europeantour/season=2017/tournamentid=2017032/news/newsid=325848.html |title=Wiesberger claims dramatic victory in China |publisher=PGA European Tour |date=23 April 2017 |accessdate=23 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 May 2019, Weisberger won his fifth European Tour title at the [[Made in Denmark]] at Himmerland Golf & Spa Resort.

He finished the 2019 season in third place on the Race to Dubai standings, his career best finish to date.\n\nIn July 2015, when he won the [[Alstom Open de France]], Wiesberger became the most successful Austrian golfer on the European Tour with three tour victories. He has since extended his record and is a seven-time winner on the European Tour.\n\n==Amateur career==\nWiesberger was born in [[Vienna]]. He won several amateur tournaments, including three Austrian Amateur Stroke Play Championships from 2004 to 2006, the Austrian Amateur Match Play Championship in 2004 and the Austrian Youths Championship in 2004 and 2005. He represented his country at the 2004 and 2006 [[Eisenhower Trophy]]. He turned professional in 2006.\n\n==Professional career==\nWiesberger played on the [[Challenge Tour]] in 2007 and 2008. He earned his [[European Tour]] card for the 2009 season through [[qualifying school]]. He was unable to win enough money during his rookie season to retain his card and returned to the Challenge Tour. Wiesberger won two events, the [[Allianz Golf Open de Lyon]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europeantour.com/challengetour/season=2010/tournamentid=2010746/news/newsid=125331.html |title=Wiesberger wins with a wondrous 62 |publisher=[[PGA European Tour]] |date=11 July 2010 |accessdate=13 July 2010}}</ref> and the [[Allianz Golf Open du Grand Toulouse]], en route to a 5th-place finish on the Order of Merit, good enough for a European Tour card for 2011.\n\nWiesberger recorded four top-10 finishes in his return to the European Tour in 2011 including two runner up finishes. He finished 64th on the Order of Merit. Wiesberger claimed his maiden title on the European Tour in 2012 at the [[Ballantine's Championship]], twice setting the course record and winning the championship by the margin of five strokes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europeantour.com/europeantour/season=2012/tournamentid=2012024/news/newsid=158747.html#bernd+toasts+maiden+victory |title=Bernd Toasts Maiden Victory |publisher=[[PGA European Tour]] |date=29 April 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}</ref> The win moved him into the top 100 of the [[Official World Golf Ranking]]. In July 2012, Wiesberger won his second title of the year and of his European Tour career at the [[Lyoness Open]], held in his home country of Austria. He started the final round four strokes back of [[Thorbj\u00f8rn Olesen]], but a round of 65 seven under par, including birdies at three of the last four holes secured a three stroke victory. He became only the second Austrian to win his home Open, after [[Markus Brier]] in 2006. After the victory he said: \"It's the best day of my life so far. It seems like it went my way, especially the last two holes. I had such a great country and such great fans backing me. I'm very proud to be following in such big footsteps [as Brier]. I'm sure I'm not going to be the last home winner.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europeantour.com/europeantour/season=2012/tournamentid=2012054/news/newsid=168919.html#wiesberger+seals+fairytale+triumph |title=Wiesberger wins his home Open |publisher=[[PGA European Tour]] |date=28 July 2012 |accessdate=28 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nOn 5 May 2013, Wiesberger won his sixth professional tournament and the second of his career in Asia, beating reigning [[The Open Championship|Open Champion]] [[Ernie Els]] by a shot at the [[CIMB Niaga Indonesian Masters]] for his first win of the season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/golf/top-stories/Bernd-Wiesberger-wins-CIMB-Niaga-Indonesian-Masters/articleshow/19894945.cms |title=Wiesberger wins CIMB Niaga Indonesian Masters |work=[[The Times of India]] |date=5 May 2013 |accessdate=5 May 2013 |first=V |last=Anand}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014, he lost a playoff at his home event, the [[Austrian Open (golf)|Austrian Open]]. However, he earned enough world ranking points to place 60th in the world and become the first Austrian to play in the [[2014 U.S. Open (golf)|U.S. Open]]. Wiesberger had the last guaranteed position for entry and it was the event immediately after the Austrian Open. At the [[2014 PGA Championship]], Wiesberger was one off the lead of [[Rory McIlroy]] after 54 holes at [[Valhalla Golf Club]] and was paired with McIlroy in the final round of the championship. However, Wiesberger shot a three-over par round on the final day and finished in a tie for 15th.\n\nIn May 2015, Wiesberger lost in a three-man sudden-death playoff at the [[Dubai Duty Free Irish Open]]. He started the final round two strokes behind [[S\u00f8ren Kjeldsen]] and despite shooting a 74, entered the playoff with Kjeldsen and [[Eddie Pepperell]]. Kjeldsen won on the first extra hole with a birdie. Wiesberger has lost all three sudden-death playoffs in his European Tour career. On 5 July Wiesberger would win his third event on the European Tour when he took the [[Alstom Open de France]]. Wiesberger took victory by three strokes over Englishmen [[James Morrison (golfer)|James Morrison]], Wiesberger had also started the round four strokes back of South African [[Jaco Van Zyl]] but stormed back with final round 66. With this being his third win on tour, he became the most successful Austrian golfer in the history of the European Tour, moving ahead of [[Markus Brier]], who had two wins; [[Martin Wiegele]] was the only other Austrian with a win.\n\nWiesberger claimed his fourth European Tour victory at the 2017 [[Shenzhen International (golf)|Shenzhen International]]. He won with a birdie at the first extra hole, in a sudden-death playoff, to defeat [[Tommy Fleetwood]]. Fleetwood had earlier shot a final round of 63 to come from eight strokes back and set the clubhouse lead. Wiesberger had to scramble for pars on the back nine and then almost holed his approach shot on the 72nd hole for the victory. In the playoff, Wiesberger found trouble from the tee, but hit his approach to within five feet for birdie to claim victory. His fourth victory came in his 200th event on the European Tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europeantour.com/europeantour/season=2017/tournamentid=2017032/news/newsid=325848.html |title=Wiesberger claims dramatic victory in China |publisher=PGA European Tour |date=23 April 2017 |accessdate=23 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 May 2019, Weisberger won his fifth European Tour title at the [[Made in Denmark]] at Himmerland Golf & Spa Resort.

Placing 2nd also ensured their first ever appearance in the CIF State Cross Country Championships.\n\nIn 2016 both teams advanced to the CIF State Cross Country Championships after they each placed 2nd in their races in the Division I Los Angeles City Section Cross Country Finals.

Head coach Darryl Stroh, offensive coordinator Tom Harp, and line coach Bill Lake were instrumental in developing a successful new game plan that countered Carson's offensive juggernaut and ferocious pass rush. Carson had clobbered Granada, 42-14, earlier in the season. It is still regarded as one of the biggest upsets in the history of L.A. high school football.\n\n===Soccer===\nIn 2017, both the Boys and Girls soccer teams won the Division I LA City Championship.

Placing 2nd also ensured their first ever appearance in the CIF State Cross Country Championships.\n\nIn 2016 both teams advanced to the CIF State Cross Country Championships after they each placed 2nd in their races in the Division I Los Angeles City Section Cross Country Finals.

Head coach Darryl Stroh, offensive coordinator Tom Harp, and line coach Bill Lake were instrumental in developing a successful new game plan that countered Carson's offensive juggernaut and ferocious pass rush.
