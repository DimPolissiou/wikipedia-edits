{"title_page": "Edinburgh, Loanhead and Roslin Railway", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=February 2017}}\nThe '''Edinburgh, Loanhead and Roslin Railway''' was a railway line south of [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, built primarily to serve mineral workings, although passenger trains were operated. It is also known as the ''[[Glencorse]] Branch'' of the [[North British Railway]]. It opened from a junction at Millerhill on the [[Waverley Route]], to [[Roslin, Midlothian|Roslin]] in 1874 and was extended to a location near [[Penicuik]] to serve [[Glencorse Barracks]] and a colliery in 1877 and to Penicuik Gas Works in 1878.\n\nBus services substantially eroded the passenger carryings on the line, and passenger trains ceased in 1933. There was some revival in colliery activity after [[World War II]] but most of the traffic had ceased in 1969 and the line finally closed completely in 1989.\n\n==History==\n\n===First proposals===\n[[File:Glencorse railway.png|thumb|System map of the Edinburgh, Loanhead and Roslin Railway]]Many Scottish railways were authorised in the frenzy of schemes in Parliament in the 1845 session, including the [[Caledonian Railway]]; the [[North British Railway]] had been authorised the previous year. Earlier there had been a heated debate about the route a line from central Scotland to England ought to take; it was assumed that only one line could be supported commercially, and many communities, seeing the benefit to towns already on a railway line, were extremely anxious to be on the new main line.\n\nIn the event the limitation to a single main line was cast aside. During the debate, Peebles had been placed on one of the routes, but that scheme fell out of favour, and in November 1845 a Peebles Railway was proposed, for the 1846 Parliamentary session, connecting Edinburgh and Peebles. It would have run by way of Loanhead, Roslin and Glencorse, running to Penicuik and crossing the [[River Esk, Lothian|North Esk]], and on to Peebles. The scheme failed to attract support and was not proceeded with.<ref name = hurst>{{cite book| first=Jeff| last=Hurst| title=The Glencorse Branch| publisher=Oakwood Press| location=Usk| year=1999| isbn=0-85361-539-X}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nPeebles got its railway later: the [[Peebles Railway]] opened in 1855. It branched from the North British Railway main line to Hawick, which became known as the ''Waverley Route''. That line and the Peebles branch line from it ran well to the east of the North Esk, and although there was a \"Penicuik\" station it did not properly serve the industrial communities of the earlier proposal.<ref name = marshall>{{cite book| first=Peter| last=Marshall| title=Peebles Railways| publisher=Oakwood Press| location=Usk| year=2005| isbn=0-85361-638-8}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe North British Railway constantly wished to consolidate its dominance of the Lothians area, and to keep the rival Caledonian Railway out, and in 1865 it succeeded in getting authority for several branches, and two roads, in the area, under the North British Railway (Lasswade &c. Branches) Act 1865. However, in the following months there was a major upheaval in the NBR board due to shareholder dissatisfaction, and none of the \"Lasswade\" railways was built.<ref name = hurst/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===The Edinburgh Loanhead and Roslin Railway===\nMineral extraction developed increasingly in the ground to the north of Penicuik, and this led to a proposed railway serving the district; the ''Edinburgh Loanhead and Roslin Railway Act'' authorising the line, obtained the Royal Assent on 20 June 1870.<ref group = note>Awdry, Thomas (NBR volume 1), Carter and Munro;{{page needed|date=August 2015}} Ross says 26 June 1870.</ref><ref name = munro>{{cite book| first1=W.| last1=Munro| first2=E.A.| last2=Munro| title=Lost Railways of Midlothian| publisher=W & E A Munro| year=1985}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}} the capital was \u00a354,000.<ref name = carter>{{cite book| first=E.F.| last=Carter| title=An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles| publisher=Cassell| location=London| year=1959}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}} Agreement had been reached with the North British Railway to work the line for thirty years for 45% of gross receipts, and a clause allowed the NBR to purchase the concern within five years of opening.<ref name = hurst/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}<ref name = ross>{{cite book| first=David| last=Ross| title=The North British Railway: A History| publisher=Stenlake Publishing Limited| location=Catrine| year=2014| isbn=978-1-84033-647-4}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}<ref name = thomas1>{{cite book| first=John| last=Thomas| title=The North British Railway| volume=Vol. 1| publisher=David & Charles| location=Newton Abbot| year=1969| isbn=0-7153-4697-0}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[Thomas Bouch]] was the engineer<ref name = thomas/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}} and the contractor was [[John Waddell (engineer)|John Waddell]].<ref name = ross/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nUnprecedented wet weather delayed the construction of the line. While the work was proceeding, the North British Railway informed the Loanhead and Roslin company that the latter would have to pay for the junction with the NBR line at Millerhill. This became a heated dispute, but eventually agreement was reached, in May 1872: the NBR paid one third of the cost.<ref name = hurst/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nDuring this period it was evident that further mineral extraction was developing, and a special meeting of shareholders on 5 February 1872 approved the submission of a Bill to extend the line to Glencorse and Mauricewood. The Shotts Iron Company had promised to send 50,000 to 60,000 tons of ironstone annually on the branch and the Glasgow Iron Company was sinking new pits in the district.

In 1875, the Shotts Iron Company sunk a new shaft at Greenlaw near Glencorse Barracks, and (encouraged by the NBR) the ELRR sought Parliamentary authority to extend the line to serve the mine.

It is also known as the ''[[Glencorse]] Branch'' of the [[North British Railway]]. It opened from a junction at Millerhill on the [[Waverley Route]], to [[Roslin, Midlothian|Roslin]] in 1874 and was extended to a location near [[Penicuik]] to serve [[Glencorse Barracks]] and a colliery in 1877 and to Penicuik Gas Works in 1878.\n\nBus services substantially eroded the passenger carryings on the line, and passenger trains ceased in 1933. There was some revival in colliery activity after [[World War II]] but most of the traffic had ceased in 1969 and the line finally closed completely in 1989.\n\n==History==\n\n===First proposals===\n[[File:Glencorse railway.png|thumb|System map of the Edinburgh, Loanhead and Roslin Railway]]Many Scottish railways were authorised in the frenzy of schemes in Parliament in the 1845 session, including the [[Caledonian Railway]]; the [[North British Railway]] had been authorised the previous year. Earlier there had been a heated debate about the route a line from central Scotland to England ought to take; it was assumed that only one line could be supported commercially, and many communities, seeing the benefit to towns already on a railway line, were extremely anxious to be on the new main line.\n\nIn the event the limitation to a single main line was cast aside. During the debate, Peebles had been placed on one of the routes, but that scheme fell out of favour, and in November 1845 a Peebles Railway was proposed, for the 1846 Parliamentary session, connecting Edinburgh and Peebles. It would have run by way of Loanhead, Roslin and Glencorse, running to Penicuik and crossing the [[River Esk, Lothian|North Esk]], and on to Peebles. The scheme failed to attract support and was not proceeded with.<ref name = hurst>{{cite book| first=Jeff| last=Hurst| title=The Glencorse Branch| publisher=Oakwood Press| location=Usk| year=1999| isbn=0-85361-539-X}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nPeebles got its railway later: the [[Peebles Railway]] opened in 1855. It branched from the North British Railway main line to Hawick, which became known as the ''Waverley Route''. That line and the Peebles branch line from it ran well to the east of the North Esk, and although there was a \"Penicuik\" station it did not properly serve the industrial communities of the earlier proposal.<ref name = marshall>{{cite book| first=Peter| last=Marshall| title=Peebles Railways| publisher=Oakwood Press| location=Usk| year=2005| isbn=0-85361-638-8}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nThe North British Railway constantly wished to consolidate its dominance of the Lothians area, and to keep the rival Caledonian Railway out, and in 1865 it succeeded in getting authority for several branches, and two roads, in the area, under the North British Railway (Lasswade &c. Branches) Act 1865. However, in the following months there was a major upheaval in the NBR board due to shareholder dissatisfaction, and none of the \"Lasswade\" railways was built.<ref name = hurst/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===The Edinburgh Loanhead and Roslin Railway===\nMineral extraction developed increasingly in the ground to the north of Penicuik, and this led to a proposed railway serving the district; the ''Edinburgh Loanhead and Roslin Railway Act'' authorising the line, obtained the Royal Assent on 20 June 1870.<ref group = note>Awdry, Thomas (NBR volume 1), Carter and Munro;{{page needed|date=August 2015}} Ross says 26 June 1870.</ref><ref name = munro>{{cite book| first1=W.| last1=Munro| first2=E.A.| last2=Munro| title=Lost Railways of Midlothian| publisher=W & E A Munro| year=1985}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}} the capital was \u00a354,000.<ref name = carter>{{cite book| first=E.F.| last=Carter| title=An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles| publisher=Cassell| location=London| year=1959}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}} Agreement had been reached with the North British Railway to work the line for thirty years for 45% of gross receipts, and a clause allowed the NBR to purchase the concern within five years of opening.<ref name = hurst/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}<ref name = ross>{{cite book| first=David| last=Ross| title=The North British Railway: A History| publisher=Stenlake Publishing Limited| location=Catrine| year=2014| isbn=978-1-84033-647-4}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}<ref name = thomas1>{{cite book| first=John| last=Thomas| title=The North British Railway| volume=Vol. 1| publisher=David & Charles| location=Newton Abbot| year=1969| isbn=0-7153-4697-0}}</ref>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[Thomas Bouch]] was the engineer<ref name = thomas/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}} and the contractor was [[John Waddell (engineer)|John Waddell]].<ref name = ross/>{{page needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nUnprecedented wet weather delayed the construction of the line.
