{"title_page": "Matins", "text_new": "{{short description|Canonical hour of Christian liturgy}}\n{{About|liturgy in Western and Eastern Christian traditions}}\n'''Matins''' is a [[canonical hours|canonical hour]] of [[Christian liturgy]].\n\nThe earliest use of the name<ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/matins Merriam-Webster Dictionary: \"Matins\"]</ref> was in reference to the canonical hour, also called the [[vigil (liturgy)|vigil]], which was originally celebrated by [[monk]]s from about two hours after midnight to, at latest, the dawn, the time for the canonical hour of [[lauds]]. It was divided into two or (on Sundays) three [[nocturns]]. Outside of monasteries, it was generally recited at other times of the day, often in conjunction with lauds.\n\nIn the [[Byzantine Rite]] these vigils correspond to the aggregate comprising the [[Midnight Office|midnight office]], [[orthros]], and the [[Prime (liturgy)#Constantinopolitan Rite|first hour]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn a later use, especially in [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] tradition, the hour of matins (also spelled mattins) is [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|morning prayer]]. [[Lutheran]]s preserve [[Matins in Lutheranism|recognizably traditional matins]] distinct from [[Lauds|morning prayer]], but \"matins\" is sometimes used in other [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations to describe any morning service.\n\n== Roman Rite ==\n\n=== \"Vigil\" ===\n\nThe every-night monastic [[canonical hour]] that later became known as matins was at first called a \"vigil\", from [[Latin]] ''vigilia''. For soldiers, this word meant a three-hour period of being on the watch during the night. Even for civilians, night was commonly spoken of as divided into four such watches: the Gospels use the term when recounting how, at about \"the fourth watch of the night\", Jesus came to his disciples who in their boat were struggling to make headway against the wind,<ref>{{bibleverse|Mark|6:48|ESV}}; {{bibleverse|Matthew|14:5|ESV}}</ref> and one of the [[Psalms]] says to the Lord: \"A thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the night.\"<ref>{{bibleverse|Psalm|90:4|ESV}}</ref>\n\nThe sixth-century ''[[Rule of Saint Benedict]]'' uses the term ''vigiliae'' (\"vigils\") fifteen times to speak of these celebrations, accompanying it four times with the adjective ''nocturnae'' (\"nocturnal\") and once with the words ''septem noctium'' (\"of the seven nights\", i.e., the nights of the week).<ref name=Regula>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/benedict.html ''Regula S.P.N. Benedicti'']</ref>\n\nEnglish versions of this document often obscure its use of the term \"vigil\", translating it as \"Night Hour\" or \"Night Office\". Thus Leonard J. Doyle's English version uses \"Night Office\" to represent indifferently the unaccompanied noun ''vigilia'' (\"vigil\"), the phrase ''nocturna vigilia'' (\"night vigil\"), and the phrases ''nocturna hora'' (\"night hour) and ''nocturna laus'' (\"nocturnal praise\").<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/50040/50040-h/50040-h.html ''St Benedict's Rule for Monasteries'']; cf.

Both in summer and in winter the vigil office was longer than on other days, with more reading and the recitation of canticles in addition to the psalms.<ref>Rule of Saint Benedict, 10\u221211</ref>\n\nOutside of monasteries few rose at night to pray. The canonical hour of the vigil was said in the morning, followed immediately by lauds, and the name of \"matins\" became attached to the lengthier part of what was recited at that time of the day, while the name of \"lauds\", a name originally describing only the three Psalms 148\u2212150 recited every day at the end of the dawn office (until excised in the 1911 [[reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X]]; see [[Lauds]]), was applied to the whole of that office, substituting for the lost name of \"matins\" or variants such as ''laudes matutinae'' (morning praises) and ''matutini hymni'' (morning hymns). An early instance of the application of the named \"matins\" to the vigil office is that of the [[Council of Tours 567|Council of Tours in 567]], which spoke of ''ad matutinum sex antiphonae''.<ref name=CE1911>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10050a.htm Fernand Cabrol, \"Matins\" in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', vol. 10 (New York 1911)]; {{CE1913|wstitle=Matins|inline=1|last=Cabrol|first=Fernand|volume=10|year=1911}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Rule of Saint Benedict'' clearly distinguished this one nighttime hour, to which he applied [[Psalm 119|Psalm 118/119]]:62, \"At midnight I rise to praise you, because of your righteous rules\",<ref>[https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/119-62-compare.html Psalm 119:62]</ref> from the seven daytime hours, including ''matutini'' (matins, the hour of the morning psalms at dawn), which he associated with [[Psalm 119|Psalm 118/119]]:164, \"Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous rules\".<ref>[https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/119-164-compare.html Psalm 119:164]</ref><ref>Rule of Saint Benedict, 16</ref>\n\nThe word \"vigil\" also took on a different meaning: no longer a prayerful ''watch at night'' before a religious feast, but the ''day'' before a feast.<ref>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/vigil Oxford English Dictionaries]</ref><ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vigil Merriam-Webster]</ref>\n\n=== Monastic matins ===\n\nThe canonical hour began with the versicles, \"O God, come to my assistance; O Lord, make haste to help me\" and \"O Lord, Thou wilt open my lips, and my mouth shall declare Thy praise\" (the latter said three times) followed by [[Psalm 3]] and [[Psalm 95|Psalm 94/95]] (the [[Invitatory]]). The Invitatory was to be recited slowly out of consideration for any late-arriving monk, since anyone appearing after its conclusion was punished by having to stand in a place apart.<ref>Rule of Saint Benedict, 43</ref> After this a hymn was sung.\n\nNext came two sets of six psalms followed by readings. (Such sets would later be called [[nocturns]].) The first set was of six psalms followed by three readings from the [[Old Testament|Old]] or [[New Testament]]s or from [[Church Fathers]]. Each reading was followed by a [[responsory]]. The second set of six psalms was followed by a passage from the [[Apostle Paul]] recited by heart and by some prayers. The Night Office then concluded with a versicle and a litany that began with [[Kyrie eleison]].<ref>Rule of St Benedict, 9\u201310</ref>\n\nSince summer nights are shorter, from Easter to October a single passage from the Old Testament, recited by heart, took the place of the three readings used during the rest of the year.<ref>Rule of Saint Benedict, 10</ref>\n\nOn Sundays, the office was longer, and therefore began a little earlier. Each set of six psalms was followed by four readings instead of three after the first set and a single recitation by heart after the second set. Then three [[canticle]]s taken from Old Testament books other than the Psalms were recited, followed by four readings from the New Testament, the singing of the [[Te Deum]], and a reading by the abbot from the Gospels, after which another hymn was sung.<ref>Rule of Saint Benedict, 11</ref>\n\n=== ''Roman Breviary'' matins ===\n\nIn the ''Roman Breviary'', use of which was made obligatory throughout the [[Latin Church]] (with exceptions for forms of the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] that could show they had been in continuous use for at least two hundred years) by Pope Pius V in 1568, matins and lauds were seen as a single canonical hour, with lauds as an appendage to matins.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=y8NVAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA19&dq=Roman+Breviary+appended&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4oYuEwbPgAhXNyaYKHaXuAP4Q6AEINzAD#v=onepage&q=Roman%20Breviary%20appended&f=false John Henry Newman, ''On the Roman Breviary as embodying the substance of the devotional services of the Church Catholic'' (Tracts for the Times, 75), p. 19]</ref>\n\nIts matins began, as in the monastic matins, with versicles and the [[invitatory]] Psalm 94 (Psalm 95 in the Masoretic text) chanted or recited in the responsorial form, that is to say, by one or more [[Cantor (church)|cantor]]s singing one verse, which the [[choir]] repeated as a response to the successive verses sung by the cantors. A [[hymn]] was then sung.\n\nAfter that introduction, Sunday matins had three sections (\"[[nocturns]]\"), the first with 12 psalms and 3 very short scriptural readings; the second with 3 psalms and 3 equally short [[Fathers of the Church|patristic]] readings; and the third with 3 psalms and 3 short extracts from a homily.

The first of these changes was the [[reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X]] in 1911, resulting in what [[Pope Paul VI]] called \"a new Breviary\".<ref name=Laudis>[https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-vi_apc_19701101_laudis-canticum_lt.html Apostolic Constitution ''Laudis Canticum'']</ref> The reservation of Psalms 1-108/109 to matins and the consecutive order within that group were abandoned, and, apart from the invitatory psalm, which continued in its place at matins every day, no psalm was ordinarily repeated within the same week. To facilitate an even distribution among the days of the week, the longer psalms were divided into shorter portions, as only the very long Psalm 118/119 had been previously. Matins no longer had 18 psalms on Sundays, 12 on ordinary days and 9 on the more important feasts: on every day it had 9 psalms, either distributed among three nocturns or recited all together, maintaining the distinction between celebrations as three nocturns with nine readings (including Sundays) and those arranged as a single nocturn with only three readings.<ref name=PiusV&X/>\n\nIn 1947, [[Pope Pius XII]] entrusted examination of the whole question of the Breviary to a commission which conducted a worldwide consultation of the Catholic bishops. He authorized recitation of the psalms in a new Latin translation and in 1955 ordered a simplification of the rubrics.<ref name=Laudis/>\n\nIn 1960, [[Pope John XXIII]] issued his ''[[Code of Rubrics]]'', which assigned nine-readings matins only to first-class and second-class feasts and therefore reduced the readings of Sunday matins to three.<ref>[http://divinumofficium.com/www/horas/Help/Rubrics/Breviary%201960.html 1960 Code of Rubrics, 161\u2212163]</ref>\n\nIn 1970, [[Pope Paul VI]] published a revised form of the [[Liturgy of the Hours]], in which the psalms were arranged in a four-week instead of a one-week cycle, but the variety of other texts was greatly increased, in particular the scriptural and patristic readings, while the hagiographical readings were purged of non-historical legendary content.<ref>''Laudis canticum'', criteria 3\u22127</ref>\n\nWhat had previously been called matins was given the name of \"office of readings\" (''officium lectionis'') and was declared appropriate for celebrating at any hour, while preserving its nocturnal character for those who wished to celebrate a vigil.<ref>''Laudis canticum'', criterion 2</ref> For that purpose alternative hymns are provided and an appendix contains material, in particular canticles and readings from the Gospels, to facilitate celebration of a vigil. The Catholic Church has thus restored to the word \"vigil\" the meaning it had in early Christianity. Pope John XIII's ''Code of Rubrics'' still used the word \"vigil\" to mean the ''day before'' a feast, but recognized the quite different character of the [[Easter Vigil]], which, \"since it is not a liturgical day, is celebrated in its own way, as a night watch\".<ref>[http://divinumofficium.com/www/horas/Help/Rubrics/General%20Rubrics.html#5 1960 Code of Rubrics, 28]</ref> The Roman liturgy now uses the term \"vigil\" either in this sense of \"a night watch\" or with regard to a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] celebrated in the evening before a feast, not before the hour of First Vespers.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=WlQGG3t4LUkC&pg=PT279&dq=%22Vigil+Mass%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjGyrDKxbTgAhVtVRUIHQSkBrwQ6AEIXDAJ#v=onepage&q=%22Vigil%20Mass%22&f=false David I.

These are followed by two extended readings with their responsories, the first from the [[Bible]] (but not from the Gospels), and the second being patristic, hagiographical, or magisterial. As already mentioned, a Gospel reading may optionally be added, preceded by vigil canticles, in order to celebrate a vigil. These are given in an appendix of the book of the [[Liturgy of the Hours]].<ref>''Liturgia Horarum iuxta ritum Romanum'', editio typica altera, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2000</ref>\n\nTo those who find it seriously difficult, because of their advanced age or for reasons peculiar to them, to observe the revised Liturgy of the Hours Pope Paul VI gave permission to keep using the previous Roman Breviary either in whole or in part.<ref name=Laudis/> In 2007 [[Pope Benedict XVI]] allowed all clergy of the [[Latin Church]] to fulfil their canonical obligations by using the 1961 ''Roman Breviary'' issued under Pope John XXIII (but not earlier editions such as that of Pius X or Pius V).<ref>[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/motu_proprio/documents/hf_ben-xvi_motu-proprio_20070707_summorum-pontificum.html ''Summorum Pontificum'', art. 9 \u00a73]</ref> [[Traditionalist Catholic]] communities, such as the [[Priestly Fraternity of St. Peter]] and the [[Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest]], avail of this authorization.\n\n== Non-Roman Western Rites ==\nIn the office of the Church of Jerusalem, of which the pilgrim [[Egeria (pilgrim)|\u00c6theria]] gives us a description, the vigils on Sundays terminated with the solemn reading of the [[Gospel]], in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]. This practice of reading the Gospel has been preserved in the [[Benedictine]] liturgy. In the Tridentine [[Roman Rite|Roman Liturgy]] this custom, so ancient and so solemn, was no longer represented but by the [[Homily]];<ref name=CE1911/> but after the [[Second Vatican Council]] it has been restored for the celebration of vigils.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070928023257/http://www.catholicchurch.org.uk/liturgy/Resources/Rites/GILH.pdf The General Instruction of the Liturgy of the Hours], 73</ref>\n\nThe [[Ambrosian Rite|Ambrosian Liturgy]], better perhaps than any other, preserved traces of the great vigils or ''pannychides'', with their complex and varied display of processions, psalmodies, etc. The same liturgy also preserved vigils of long psalmody. This nocturnal office adapted itself at a later period to a more modern form, approaching more and more closely to the Roman liturgy. Here too were found the three nocturns, with [[Antiphon]], psalms, lessons, and responses, the ordinary elements of the Roman matins, and with a few special features quite Ambrosian.<ref name=CE1911/>\n\nAs revised after the [[Second Vatican Council]], the Ambrosian [[liturgy of the hours]] uses for what once called matins either the designation \"the part of matins that precedes lLauds in the strict sense\" or simply \"office of readings\".<ref>[http://www.unipiams.org/en/?id=207&PHPSESSID=5ff4d7343830c67a79b587060b9ad61c Ambrosian liturgy of the hours in latin: Introduction]</ref> Its structure is similar to that of the Roman Liturgy of the Hours, with variations such as having on Sundays three canticles, on Saturdays a canticle and two psalms, in place of the three psalms of the other days in the Ambrosian Rite and of every day in the [[Roman Rite]].<ref>[http://www.unipiams.org/en/?id=208&PHPSESSID=5ff4d7343830c67a79b587060b9ad61c Ambrosian Liturgy of the Hours in latin: chapter II], IV. De Officio Lectionis</ref>\n\nIn the [[Mozarabic Rite|Mozarabic liturgy]], on the contrary, Matins is a system of antiphons, collects, and versicles which make them quite a departure from the Roman system.<ref name=CE1911/>\n\n== Eastern Christianity ==\n\n=== Armenian Rite ===\nIn the Armenian liturgy of the hours, Matins is known as the Midnight Office (Armenian: \u056b \u0574\u0565\u057b \u0563\u056b\u0577\u0565\u0580\u056b \"\"i mej gisheri\"\"). The Armenian Book of Hours, or Zhamagirk` (Armenian: \u053a\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0563\u056b\u0580\u0584) states that the Midnight Office is celebrated in commemoration of God the Father.\n\nMuch of the service consists of the kanon (Armenian: \u053f\u0561\u0576\u0578\u0576\u0561\u0563\u056c\u0578\u0582\u056d \"\"kanonagloukh\"\"), consisting of a sequence of psalms, hymns, prayers, and in some instances readings from the Gospels, varying according to tone of the day, feast, or liturgical season. The Armenian kanon is quite different in form from the canon of the Byzantine matins service, though both likely share a common ancestor in the pre-dawn worship of the Jerusalem liturgy.\n\n==== Basic Outline of Matins in the Armenian Church ====\nIntroduction (common to all liturgical hours): \"Blessed is our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Our father...Amen.\"\n\nFixed Preface\n\n\u201cLord, if you open my lips, my mouth shall declare your praise.\u201d (twice)\n\nAcclamation: \u201cBlessed is the consubstantial and unitary Holy Trinity...Amen.\n\nPsalms: 3, 88, 102, 142\n\n\u201cGlory to the Father...now and always...Amen\u201d\n\nHymn of the Night Liturgy by Nerses Shnorhali: \u201cLet us remember your name in the night, Lord...\u201d\n\nProclamation by John Mandakuni \u201cHaving all been awakened in the night from the repose of sleep...\u201d\n\n\u201cLord, have mercy\u201d (variable number of times: thrice for Sundays and feasts of Christ, 50 times for the feasts of saints, 100 times on days of fasting)\n\nHymn of Nerses Shnorhali: \u201cAll the world... (Ashkharh amenayn)\u201d\n\n\u201cLord, have mercy\u201d (thrice). \u201cThrough the intercession of the Birthgiver of God: Remember, Lord, and have mercy.\u201d\n\nHymn of Nerses Shnorhali: \u201cThe rising of the sun... (A\u1e5bawowt lowsoy)\u201d\n\nPrayer: \u201cWe thank you...\u201d\n\nBlessed is our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Alleluia, alleluia.\n\nAt this point a section of the Psalter is read, followed by a canticle from the Old or New Testament. See [[Canticle|Armenian Liturgy]].\nFollowing the Psalms and the Canticle is the Canon, a complex sequence of psalms, hymns, and prayers which varies in part according to the liturgical calendar.\n\nConclusion: \"Our father...Amen.\"\n\nThe Armenian Matins or Midnight Office bears some resemblance with the Midnight Office of the Byzantine Rite, such as the recitation of a movable set of hymns depending on the feast. However, the Armenian Midnight Office is generally more elaborate than the Byzantine Midnight Office, in that the Armenian counterpart includes readings from the Gospel, as well as cycles of psalms and prayers reflecting the liturgical season or feast. Other material in the Byzantine office of Matins which has a counterpart in the Armenian daily office, such as the recitation of large sections of the Psalter and the recitation of biblical canticles, occurs in the Armenian liturgy at the Sunrise Hour which follows Matins, corresponding to Lauds.\n\n=== Byzantine Rite ===\n{{Main article|Orthros}}\nIn the [[Eastern Churches]], matins is called ''orthros'' in [[Greek language|Greek]] ({{lang|grc|\u1f44\u03c1\u03b8\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}}, meaning \"early dawn\" or \"daybreak\") and ''O\u00fatrenya'' in [[Church Slavonic|Slavonic]] (\u041e\u045e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u044f). It is the last of the four night offices, which also include [[vespers]], [[compline]], and midnight office. In traditional monasteries it is celebrated daily so as to end at sunrise. In parishes it is normally served only on Sundays and [[feast days]].\n\nMatins is the longest and most complex of the daily cycle of services. The ''akolouth'' (fixed portion of the service) is composed primarily of [[psalms]] and [[Ektenia|litanies]]. The sequences (variable parts) of matins are composed primarily of hymns and [[Canon (hymnography)|canons]] from the [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]] (an eight-tone cycle of hymns for each day of the week, covering eight weeks), and from the [[Menaion]] (hymns for each calendar day of the year).\n\nMatins opens with what is called the \"Royal Beginning\", so called because the psalms (19 and 20) are attributed to [[King David]] and speak of the [[Messiah]], the \"king of kings\"; in former times, the ektenia (litany) also mentioned the emperor by name. The Sunday orthros is the longest of the regular orthros services. If celebrated in its entirety it can last up to three hours.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Liturgy of the Hours]]\n*[[Canonical hours]]\n*[[Diurnum]]\n*[[Compline]]\n*[[Vigil (liturgy)]]\n*[[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Anglican Morning Prayers]]\n*[[Book of Hours]]\n*[[Matins in Lutheranism]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Matins |volume=17 |short=x}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081010130050/http://www.goarch.org/en/chapel/liturgical_texts/SUNDAYORTHROS.asp Sunday Orthos] Greek Orthodox Church in America\n*[http://www.saintjonah.org/services/dailymatins.htm Daily Matins] Russian Orthodox (in English)\n*[http://www.catholic-forum.com/members/popestleo/dailyprayer.html Byzantine Catholic Daily Prayer]\n*[http://www.universalis.com/readings.htm The Office of Readings for today's date (Roman Catholic)]\n\n{{LiturgicalHours}}\n\n[[Category:Major hours]]\n[[Category:Liturgy of the Hours]]\n[[Category:Catholic liturgy]]\n[[Category:Eastern Christian liturgies]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Canonical hour of Christian liturgy}}\n{{About|liturgy in Western and Eastern Christian traditions}}\n'''Matins''' is a [[canonical hours|canonical hour]] of [[Christian liturgy]].\n\nThe earliest use of the name<ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/matins Merriam-Webster Dictionary: \"Matins\"]</ref> was in reference to the canonical hour, also called the [[vigil (liturgy)|vigil]], which was originally celebrated by [[monk]]s from about two hours after midnight to, at latest, the dawn, the time for the canonical hour of [[lauds]]. It was divided into two or (on Sundays) three [[nocturns]]. Outside of monasteries, it was generally recited at other times of the day, often in conjunction with lauds.\n\nIn the [[Byzantine Rite]] these vigils correspond to the aggregate comprising the [[Midnight Office|midnight office]], [[orthros]], and the [[Prime (liturgy)#Constantinopolitan Rite|first hour]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\nIn a later use, especially in [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] tradition, the hour of matins (also spelled mattins) is [[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|morning prayer]].

For soldiers, this word meant a three-hour period of being on the watch during the night. Even for civilians, night was commonly spoken of as divided into four such watches: the Gospels use the term when recounting how, at about \"the fourth watch of the night\", Jesus came to his disciples who in their boat were struggling to make headway against the wind,<ref>{{bibleverse|Mark|6:48|ESV}}; {{bibleverse|Matthew|14:5|ESV}}</ref> and one of the [[Psalms]] says to the Lord: \"A thousand years in your sight are but as yesterday when it is past, or as a watch in the night.\"<ref>{{bibleverse|Psalm|90:4|ESV}}</ref>\n\nThe sixth-century ''[[Rule of Saint Benedict]]'' uses the term ''vigiliae'' (\"vigils\") fifteen times to speak of these celebrations, accompanying it four times with the adjective ''nocturnae'' (\"nocturnal\") and once with the words ''septem noctium'' (\"of the seven nights\", i.e., the nights of the week).<ref name=Regula>[http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/benedict.html ''Regula S.P.N. Benedicti'']</ref>\n\nEnglish versions of this document often obscure its use of the term \"vigil\", translating it as \"Night Hour\" or \"Night Office\". Thus Leonard J. Doyle's English version uses \"Night Office\" to represent indifferently the unaccompanied noun ''vigilia'' (\"vigil\"), the phrase ''nocturna vigilia'' (\"night vigil\"), and the phrases ''nocturna hora'' (\"night hour) and ''nocturna laus'' (\"nocturnal praise\").<ref>[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/50040/50040-h/50040-h.html ''St Benedict's Rule for Monasteries'']; cf.

Both in summer and in winter the vigil office was longer than on other days, with more reading and the recitation of canticles in addition to the psalms.<ref>Rule of Saint Benedict, 10\u221211</ref>\n\nOutside of monasteries few rose at night to pray. The canonical hour of the vigil was said in the morning, followed immediately by lauds, and the name of \"matins\" became attached to the lengthier part of what was recited at that time of the day, while the name of \"lauds\", a name originally describing only the three Psalms 148\u2212150 recited every day at the end of the dawn office (until excised in the 1911 [[reform of the Roman Breviary by Pope Pius X]]; see [[Lauds]]), was applied to the whole of that office, substituting for the lost name of \"matins\" or variants such as ''laudes matutinae'' (morning praises) and ''matutini hymni'' (morning hymns). An early instance of the application of the named \"matins\" to the vigil office is that of the [[Council of Tours 567|Council of Tours in 567]], which spoke of ''ad matutinum sex antiphonae''.<ref name=CE1911>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10050a.htm Fernand Cabrol, \"Matins\" in ''The Catholic Encyclopedia'', vol. 10 (New York 1911)]; {{CE1913|wstitle=Matins|inline=1|last=Cabrol|first=Fernand|volume=10|year=1911}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Rule of Saint Benedict'' clearly distinguished this one nighttime hour, to which he applied [[Psalm 119|Psalm 118/119]]:62, \"At midnight I rise to praise you, because of your righteous rules\",<ref>[https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/119-62-compare.html Psalm 119:62]</ref> from the seven daytime hours, including ''matutini'' (matins, the hour of the morning psalms at dawn), which he associated with [[Psalm 119|Psalm 118/119]]:164, \"Seven times a day I praise you for your righteous rules\".<ref>[https://www.biblestudytools.com/psalms/119-164-compare.html Psalm 119:164]</ref><ref>Rule of Saint Benedict, 16</ref>\n\nThe word \"vigil\" also took on a different meaning: no longer a prayerful ''watch at night'' before a religious feast, but the ''day'' before a feast.<ref>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/vigil Oxford English Dictionaries]</ref><ref>[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vigil Merriam-Webster]</ref>\n\n=== Monastic matins ===\n\nThe canonical hour began with the versicles, \"O God, come to my assistance; O Lord, make haste to help me\" and \"O Lord, Thou wilt open my lips, and my mouth shall declare Thy praise\" (the latter said three times) followed by [[Psalm 3]] and [[Psalm 95|Psalm 94/95]] (the [[Invitatory]]). The Invitatory was to be recited slowly out of consideration for any late-arriving monk, since anyone appearing after its conclusion was punished by having to stand in a place apart.<ref>Rule of Saint Benedict, 43</ref> After this a hymn was sung.\n\nNext came two sets of six psalms followed by readings. (Such sets would later be called [[nocturns]].) The first set was of six psalms followed by three readings from the [[Old Testament|Old]] or [[New Testament]]s or from [[Church Fathers]]. Each reading was followed by a [[responsory]]. The second set of six psalms was followed by a passage from the [[Apostle Paul]] recited by heart and by some prayers. The Night Office then concluded with a versicle and a litany that began with [[Kyrie eleison]].<ref>Rule of St Benedict, 9\u201310</ref>\n\nSince summer nights are shorter, from Easter to October a single passage from the Old Testament, recited by heart, took the place of the three readings used during the rest of the year.<ref>Rule of Saint Benedict, 10</ref>\n\nOn Sundays, the office was longer, and therefore began a little earlier. Each set of six psalms was followed by four readings instead of three after the first set and a single recitation by heart after the second set. Then three [[canticle]]s taken from Old Testament books other than the Psalms were recited, followed by four readings from the New Testament, the singing of the [[Te Deum]], and a reading by the abbot from the Gospels, after which another hymn was sung.<ref>Rule of Saint Benedict, 11</ref>\n\n=== ''Roman Breviary'' matins ===\n\nIn the ''Roman Breviary'', use of which was made obligatory throughout the [[Latin Church]] (with exceptions for forms of the [[Liturgy of the Hours]] that could show they had been in continuous use for at least two hundred years) by Pope Pius V in 1568, matins and lauds were seen as a single canonical hour, with lauds as an appendage to matins.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=y8NVAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA19&dq=Roman+Breviary+appended&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi4oYuEwbPgAhXNyaYKHaXuAP4Q6AEINzAD#v=onepage&q=Roman%20Breviary%20appended&f=false John Henry Newman, ''On the Roman Breviary as embodying the substance of the devotional services of the Church Catholic'' (Tracts for the Times, 75), p. 19]</ref>\n\nIts matins began, as in the monastic matins, with versicles and the [[invitatory]] Psalm 94 (Psalm 95 in the Masoretic) chanted or recited in the responsorial form, that is to say, by one or more [[Cantor (church)|cantor]]s singing one verse, which the [[choir]] repeated as a response to the successive verses sung by the cantors. A [[hymn]] was then sung.\n\nAfter that introduction, Sunday matins had three sections (\"[[nocturns]]\"), the first with 12 psalms and 3 very short scriptural readings; the second with 3 psalms and 3 equally short [[Fathers of the Church|patristic]] readings; and the third with 3 psalms and 3 short extracts from a homily.

To facilitate an even distribution among the days of the week, the longer psalms were divided into shorter portions, as only the very long Psalm 118/119 had been previously. Matins no longer had 18 psalms on Sundays, 12 on ordinary days and 9 on the more important feasts: on every day it had 9 psalms, either distributed among three nocturns or recited all together, maintaining the distinction between celebrations as three nocturns with nine readings (including Sundays) and those arranged as a single nocturn with only three readings.<ref name=PiusV&X/>\n\nIn 1947, [[Pope Pius XII]] entrusted examination of the whole question of the Breviary to a commission which conducted a worldwide consultation of the Catholic bishops. He authorized recitation of the psalms in a new Latin translation and in 1955 ordered a simplification of the rubrics.<ref name=Laudis/>\n\nIn 1960, [[Pope John XXIII]] issued his ''[[Code of Rubrics]]'', which assigned nine-readings matins only to first-class and second-class feasts and therefore reduced the readings of Sunday matins to three.<ref>[http://divinumofficium.com/www/horas/Help/Rubrics/Breviary%201960.html 1960 Code of Rubrics, 161\u2212163]</ref>\n\nIn 1970, [[Pope Paul VI]] published a revised form of the [[Liturgy of the Hours]], in which the psalms were arranged in a four-week instead of a one-week cycle, but the variety of other texts was greatly increased, in particular the scriptural and patristic readings, while the hagiographical readings were purged of non-historical legendary content.<ref>''Laudis canticum'', criteria 3\u22127</ref>\n\nWhat had previously been called matins was given the name of \"office of readings\" (''officium lectionis'') and was declared appropriate for celebrating at any hour, while preserving its nocturnal character for those who wished to celebrate a vigil.<ref>''Laudis canticum'', criterion 2</ref> For that purpose alternative hymns are provided and an appendix contains material, in particular canticles and readings from the Gospels, to facilitate celebration of a vigil. The Catholic Church has thus restored to the word \"vigil\" the meaning it had in early Christianity. Pope John XIII's ''Code of Rubrics'' still used the word \"vigil\" to mean the ''day before'' a feast, but recognized the quite different character of the [[Easter Vigil]], which, \"since it is not a liturgical day, is celebrated in its own way, as a night watch\".<ref>[http://divinumofficium.com/www/horas/Help/Rubrics/General%20Rubrics.html#5 1960 Code of Rubrics, 28]</ref> The Roman liturgy now uses the term \"vigil\" either in this sense of \"a night watch\" or with regard to a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] celebrated in the evening before a feast, not before the hour of First Vespers.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=WlQGG3t4LUkC&pg=PT279&dq=%22Vigil+Mass%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjGyrDKxbTgAhVtVRUIHQSkBrwQ6AEIXDAJ#v=onepage&q=%22Vigil%20Mass%22&f=false David I.

This nocturnal office adapted itself at a later period to a more modern form, approaching more and more closely to the Roman liturgy.

De Officio Lectionis</ref>\n\nIn the [[Mozarabic Rite|Mozarabic liturgy]], on the contrary, Matins is a system of antiphons, collects, and versicles which make them quite a departure from the Roman system.<ref name=CE1911/>\n\n== Eastern Christianity ==\n\n=== Armenian Rite ===\nIn the Armenian liturgy of the hours, Matins is known as the Midnight Office (Armenian: \u056b \u0574\u0565\u057b \u0563\u056b\u0577\u0565\u0580\u056b \"\"i mej gisheri\"\"). The Armenian Book of Hours, or Zhamagirk` (Armenian: \u053a\u0561\u0574\u0561\u0563\u056b\u0580\u0584) states that the Midnight Office is celebrated in commemoration of God the Father.\n\nMuch of the service consists of the kanon (Armenian: \u053f\u0561\u0576\u0578\u0576\u0561\u0563\u056c\u0578\u0582\u056d \"\"kanonagloukh\"\"), consisting of a sequence of psalms, hymns, prayers, and in some instances readings from the Gospels, varying according to tone of the day, feast, or liturgical season. The Armenian kanon is quite different in form from the canon of the Byzantine matins service, though both likely share a common ancestor in the pre-dawn worship of the Jerusalem liturgy.\n\n==== Basic Outline of Matins in the Armenian Church ====\nIntroduction (common to all liturgical hours): \"Blessed is our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Our father...Amen.\"\n\nFixed Preface\n\n\u201cLord, if you open my lips, my mouth shall declare your praise.\u201d (twice)\n\nAcclamation: \u201cBlessed is the consubstantial and unitary Holy Trinity...Amen.\n\nPsalms: 3, 88, 102, 142\n\n\u201cGlory to the Father...now and always...Amen\u201d\n\nHymn of the Night Liturgy by Nerses Shnorhali: \u201cLet us remember your name in the night, Lord...\u201d\n\nProclamation by John Mandakuni \u201cHaving all been awakened in the night from the repose of sleep...\u201d\n\n\u201cLord, have mercy\u201d (variable number of times: thrice for Sundays and feasts of Christ, 50 times for the feasts of saints, 100 times on days of fasting)\n\nHymn of Nerses Shnorhali: \u201cAll the world... (Ashkharh amenayn)\u201d\n\n\u201cLord, have mercy\u201d (thrice). \u201cThrough the intercession of the Birthgiver of God: Remember, Lord, and have mercy.\u201d\n\nHymn of Nerses Shnorhali: \u201cThe rising of the sun... (A\u1e5bawowt lowsoy)\u201d\n\nPrayer: \u201cWe thank you...\u201d\n\nBlessed is our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Alleluia, alleluia.\n\nAt this point a section of the Psalter is read, followed by a canticle from the Old or New Testament. See [[Canticle|Armenian Liturgy]].\nFollowing the Psalms and the Canticle is the Canon, a complex sequence of psalms, hymns, and prayers which varies in part according to the liturgical calendar.\n\nConclusion: \"Our father...Amen.\"\n\nThe Armenian Matins or Midnight Office bears some resemblance with the Midnight Office of the Byzantine Rite, such as the recitation of a movable set of hymns depending on the feast. However, the Armenian Midnight Office is generally more elaborate than the Byzantine Midnight Office, in that the Armenian counterpart includes readings from the Gospel, as well as cycles of psalms and prayers reflecting the liturgical season or feast. Other material in the Byzantine office of Matins which has a counterpart in the Armenian daily office, such as the recitation of large sections of the Psalter and the recitation of biblical canticles, occurs in the Armenian liturgy at the Sunrise Hour which follows Matins, corresponding to Lauds.\n\n=== Byzantine Rite ===\n{{Main article|Orthros}}\nIn the [[Eastern Churches]], matins is called ''orthros'' in [[Greek language|Greek]] ({{lang|grc|\u1f44\u03c1\u03b8\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2}}, meaning \"early dawn\" or \"daybreak\") and ''O\u00fatrenya'' in [[Church Slavonic|Slavonic]] (\u041e\u045e\u0442\u0440\u0435\u043d\u044f). It is the last of the four night offices, which also include [[vespers]], [[compline]], and midnight office. In traditional monasteries it is celebrated daily so as to end at sunrise. In parishes it is normally served only on Sundays and [[feast days]].\n\nMatins is the longest and most complex of the daily cycle of services. The ''akolouth'' (fixed portion of the service) is composed primarily of [[psalms]] and [[Ektenia|litanies]]. The sequences (variable parts) of matins are composed primarily of hymns and [[Canon (hymnography)|canons]] from the [[Octoechos (liturgy)|Octoechos]] (an eight-tone cycle of hymns for each day of the week, covering eight weeks), and from the [[Menaion]] (hymns for each calendar day of the year).\n\nMatins opens with what is called the \"Royal Beginning\", so called because the psalms (19 and 20) are attributed to [[King David]] and speak of the [[Messiah]], the \"king of kings\"; in former times, the ektenia (litany) also mentioned the emperor by name. The Sunday orthros is the longest of the regular orthros services. If celebrated in its entirety it can last up to three hours.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Liturgy of the Hours]]\n*[[Canonical hours]]\n*[[Diurnum]]\n*[[Compline]]\n*[[Vigil (liturgy)]]\n*[[Morning Prayer (Anglican)|Anglican Morning Prayers]]\n*[[Book of Hours]]\n*[[Matins in Lutheranism]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Matins |volume=17 |short=x}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081010130050/http://www.goarch.org/en/chapel/liturgical_texts/SUNDAYORTHROS.asp Sunday Orthos] Greek Orthodox Church in America\n*[http://www.saintjonah.org/services/dailymatins.htm Daily Matins] Russian Orthodox (in English)\n*[http://www.catholic-forum.com/members/popestleo/dailyprayer.html Byzantine Catholic Daily Prayer]\n*[http://www.universalis.com/readings.htm The Office of Readings for today's date (Roman Catholic)]\n\n{{LiturgicalHours}}\n\n[[Category:Major hours]]\n[[Category:Liturgy of the Hours]]\n[[Category:Catholic liturgy]]\n[[Category:Eastern Christian liturgies]]\n", "name_user": "Bealtainem\u00ed", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRoman Breviary matins:clearer", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matins"}

The film focuses on a pair of lovers, commercial illustrator Helen Bauer ([[Bette Davis]]) and advertising writer Don Peterson  ([[Gene Raymond]]), who have been living together quite happily (in separate apartments) for some time. One night, after hiding in Helen\u2019s bedroom until their party guests have all left, Don announces that he is tired of sneaking around.  He wants marriage\u2014and possibly children\u2014and Helen finally agrees, although she is afraid that it will wreck their relationship. Her predictions of trouble\u2014increased by the stresses of opening their own advertising agency\u2014come true, but in the end, with the serendipitous intervention of their perpetually inebriated friend, Van ([[Frank McHugh]]), they reconcile and resume the mixed blessings of wedded bliss. \n\n==Plot==\nHelen Bauer (Bette Davis) is a glamorous, successful, headstrong, and very liberated [[New York City|New York]] [[graphic artist]] with modern ideas about [[Romance (love)|romance]]. She is involved with Don Peterson (Gene Raymond) but is not prepared to sacrifice her independence by entering into matrimony. The two agree to wed only to pacify Helen's conventional [[Immigration|immigrant]] father Adolphe (Alphonse Ethier), whose Old World views spur him to condemn their [[affair]]. They form a business partnership, but financial problems at their [[advertising agency]] put a strain on the marriage and Don begins seeing Peggy Smith (Kay Strozzi), one of his married [[customer|client]]s. Convinced it was marriage that disrupted their relationship, Helen suggests they live apart but remain lovers. When Don discovers Helen is dating his business rival, playboy Nick Malvyn (Monroe Owsley), he returns to Peggy, but in reality his heart belongs to his wife. Agreeing their love will help their marriage survive its problems, the two reconcile and settle into domestic bliss.\n\nThe plot is unusual for its time in that Helen is not denigrated for her beliefs about marriage and Don is not depicted as being a cad.<ref name=\"Basinger\">{{Cite book |last=Basinger |first=Jeanine | authorlink=Jeanine Basinger |title=A Woman's View: How Hollywood Spoke to Women, 1930\u20131960 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |year=1995 |location =Middleton, Connecticut |page=385 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tbZVNPT6x6EC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=0-8195-6291-2}}</ref> In addition, although they are sleeping together and unmarried, neither is concerned about the possibility of children, and certain dialog could suggest that they are using [[birth control]].<ref name=\"Basinger\"/>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bette Davis]] as Helen Bauer\n* [[Gene Raymond]] as Don Peterson\n* Kay Strozzi as Peggy Smith\n* [[Monroe Owsley]] as Nick Malvyn\n* [[Ferdinand Gottschalk]] as Herbert Smith\n* [[Alphonse Ethier]] as Adolphe Bauer\n* [[Frank McHugh]] as Hugo Van Hugh\n* [[Claire Dodd]] as Iris Van Hugh\n* [[Bodil Rosing]] as Mrs. Bauer\n* [[George Beranger]] as Dinner Guest / Pianist (uncredited)\n* [[Armand Kaliz]] as Man Flirting With Iris (uncredited)\n* William H.

The film focuses on a pair of lovers, commercial illustrator Helen Bauer ([[Bette Davis]]) and advertising writer Don Peterson  ([[Gene Raymond]]), who have been living together quite happily (in separate apartments) for some time. One night, after hiding in Helen\u2019s bedroom until their party guests have all left, Don announces that he is tired of sneaking around.  He wants marriage\u2014and possibly children\u2014and Helen finally agrees, although she is afraid that it will wreck their relationship. Her predictions of trouble\u2014increased by the stresses of opening their own advertising agency\u2014come true, but in the end, with the serendipitous intervention of their perpetually inebriated friend, Van ([[Frank McHugh]]), they reconcile and resume the mixed blessings of wedded bliss. \n\n==Plot==\nHelen Bauer (Bette Davis) is a glamorous, successful, headstrong, and very liberated [[New York City|New York]] [[graphic artist]] with modern ideas about [[Romance (love)|romance]]. She is involved with Don Peterson (Gene Raymond) but is not prepared to sacrifice her independence by entering into matrimony. The two agree to wed only to pacify Helen's conventional [[Immigration|immigrant]] father Adolphe (Alphonse Ethier), whose Old World views spur him to condemn their [[affair]]. They form a business partnership, but financial problems at their [[advertising agency]] put a strain on the marriage and Don begins seeing Peggy Smith (Kay Strozzi), one of his married [[customer|client]]s. Convinced it was marriage that disrupted their relationship, Helen suggests they live apart but remain lovers. When Don discovers Helen is dating his business rival, playboy Nick Malvyn (Monroe Owsley), he returns to Peggy, but in reality his heart belongs to his wife. Agreeing their love will help their marriage survive its problems, the two reconcile and settle into domestic bliss.\n\nThe plot is unusual for its time in that Helen is not denigrated for her beliefs about marriage and Don is not depicted as being a cad.<ref name=\"Basinger\">{{Cite book |last=Basinger |first=Jeanine | authorlink=Jeanine Basinger |title=A Woman's View: How Hollywood Spoke to Women, 1930\u20131960 |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |year=1995 |location =Middleton, Connecticut |page=385 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=tbZVNPT6x6EC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false |isbn=0-8195-6291-2}}</ref> In addition, although they are sleeping together and unmarried, neither is concerned about the possibility of children, and certain dialog could suggest that they are using [[birth control]].<ref name=\"Basinger\"/>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bette Davis]] as Helen Bauer\n* [[Gene Raymond]] as Don Peterson\n* Kay Strozzi as Peggy Smith\n* [[Monroe Owsley]] as Nick Malvyn\n* [[Ferdinand Gottschalk]] as Herbert Smith\n* [[Alphonse Ethier]] as Adolphe Bauer\n* [[Frank McHugh]] as Hugo Van Hugh\n* [[Claire Dodd]] as Iris Van Hugh\n* [[Bodil Rosing]] as Mrs. Bauer\n* [[George Beranger]] as Dinner Guest / Pianist (uncredited)\n* [[Armand Kaliz]] as Man Flirting With Iris (uncredited)\n* William H.

The government asserted that a monopolistic telephone industry would best serve the goal of creating a \"universal\" network with compatible technology country-wide for telephone consumers.  Regulators emphasized limits on profits, enforcing \"reasonable\" prices for service, setting levels of depreciation and investment for new technology and equipment, dependability and \"universality\" of service.  \"Universal\" was originally used by AT&T to mean, \"interconnection to other networks, not service to all customers\".  After years of regulation, the term came to include infrastructural development of telephony and service to everyone at a reasonable price.<ref name=\"Aufderheide, P. 1999\">Aufderheide, P., & United States.

The focus was exclusively on local service rather than long-distance service, as no independent long-distance lines were able to compete with AT&T.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Communications Act of 1934===\n{{main|Communications Act of 1934}}\nThe [[Communications Act of 1934]] includes in its preamble a reference to universal  service.  It calls for \"rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges\" to \"all the people of the United States.\"  Communications Act of 1934 \u2013 Title I, Sec. 1 [47 U.S.C. 151] The Communications Act of 1934 first established the concept of making affordable basic telephone service available to everyone everywhere within a nation, state, or other governmental jurisdiction.\n\nTo comply with the act, AT&T began increasing the price of long-distance service to pay for universal service.  The act also established the FCC to oversee all non-governmental broadcasting, interstate communications, as well as international communication which originate or terminate in the United States.\n\nBefore the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Universal Service Fund (USF) operated as a mechanism by which interstate long-distance carriers were assessed to subsidize telephone service to low-income households and high-cost areas in order to ensure that all the people in the United States have access to rapid, efficient, nationwide communications service with sufficient facilities at realistic charges.<ref>Communication Act of 1934.

The predominant method used for financing subsidies for the underprivileged was to reallocate profit margins made by long-distance telecommunication to funds for local telephone connection. This process began in the mid 1960 and was institutionalized through the Ozark plan of 1970 into action. At the time of the institutionalization telephone penetration ranged between 85\u201395%.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Era of deregulation===\nThere was a push for deregulating the telecommunications industry in the 1980s.

Increased competition and universal service were later legislatively addressed and codified with the Telecommunications Act of 1996.<ref name=\"Jayakar, K. 2009\">Jayakar, K. (2009).

The act addresses new challenges and opportunities of the digital information age, with the goal of promoting an economic environment conducive for the growth of new information technology.  It also further developed the meaning and implementation of universal service.  The act calls for the creation of a joint federal-state board to make recommendations to the FCC on defining federal universal services and set time tables.  The act also set out immediate priorities of universal service.  These include quality and reasonably priced services, access to advanced telecommunication services, access for rural, low-income and high-cost regions, equitable and nondiscriminatory service, specific and predictable price structure, access of advanced telecommunication services for schools and health care and libraries (Sec. 254(b)(1)-(7)).  The act provided ability in the constantly changing telecommunication environment to periodically revisit and adjust universal service, while setting core principles (Sec. 254(c)).  The 1996 act also \"mandated the creation of the universal service fund (USF) into which all telecommunications providers are required to contribute a percentage of their interstate and international end-user telecommunications revenues\".<ref name=\"Jayakar, K. 2009\"/>\n\nThe major goals of Universal Service as mandated by the 1996 Act are as follows:\n\n{{quote|\n* Promote the availability of quality services at just, reasonable and affordable rates for all consumers\n* Increase nationwide access to advanced telecommunications services\n* Advance the availability of such services to all consumers, including those in low income, rural, insular, and high cost areas, at rates that are reasonably comparable to those charged in urban areas\n* Increase access to telecommunications and advanced services in schools, libraries and rural health care facilities\n* Provide equitable and non-discriminatory contributions from all providers of telecommunications services to the fund supporting universal service programs|Federal Communications Commission|[http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/universal-service Universal Service]}}\n\nThe 1996 Act states that all providers of telecommunications services should contribute to federal universal service in an equitable and nondiscriminatory manner; there should be specific, predictable, and sufficient Federal and State mechanisms to preserve and advance universal service; all schools, classrooms, health care providers, and libraries should, generally, have access to advanced telecommunications services; and finally, that the Federal-State Joint Board and the FCC should determine those other principles that, consistent with the 1996 Act, are necessary to protect the public interest.<ref>Federal Communications Commission.

Retrieved July 16, 2009 from http://www.fcc.gov/wcb/tapd/universal_service/</ref>\n\n===Expansion of the fund into broadband===\n{{see also|Broadband universal service}}\nThe concept of universal service may include other telecommunications-information services, [[Broadband universal service|mainly Internet access]]. Members of Congress have spoken out in favor of increased contribution to the USF from alternate sources.\n\nMany of the services covered by the USF are related to traditional telephone technology.  There is a rising concern that more recent developments in telecommunications are just as important to the consumer as these older technologies. For example, consumers' subscriptions to traditional telephone services have fallen while their subscription rate to wireless services have been rising consistently.  Yet many cellular companies are likely to receive less funding under the new rules, which may reduce consumers' access to wireless services in areas of the country that have low populations.  Similarly, a question currently debated is whether access to [[broadband internet]] should be supported by the USF and if so, how best to fulfill such a large mandate without damaging the stability of the fund.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 states that \"advanced services\" should be accessible to all Americans [Section 254(b)(3)].  One question is whether the providers of internet access should contribute to the fund like other companies that provide access to telecommunications, if such providers also want to draw from the fund. Supporters of including internet access in the Universal Service Fund include former Congressman [[Rick Boucher]] (D-VA)<ref>Subcommittee on Communication, Technology and the Internet.

In March 2009, senior executives from Verizon Communications met with the House Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet, providing recommendations for how best to proceed bringing broadband and mobile communication access to rural and unserved areas.  Citing reform to the Universal Service Fund as a means \"to better serve rural America,\" Verizon recommended that a limit be set on the size of USF's high-cost fund, competitive bidding wars be employed to determine which company expand service to unserved areas, structure a \"wire-center approach\" model to replace statewide cost averaging, restructure how contributions to the USF are determined, and impose a deadline on the FCC for completion of their reform of inter-carrier compensation.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=PRNewswire|title=Stimulus Grants, Subsidy Reform Key to Making Broadband Internet Available to All|date=12 Mar 2009|accessdate=17 Jul 2009|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stimulus-grants-subsidy-reform-key-to-making-broadband-internet-available-to-all-61811202.html|author=Verizon}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2011 the FCC formally proposed a \"Connect America Fund\" to address these and other concerns.<ref>[http://www.electronista.com/articles/11/10/06/fcc.says.usf.becoming.connect.america.fund/FCC details Universal Service Fund switch to broadband] Electronista, Oct 9, 2011.</ref> Reform finally arrived on October 27, 2011, when the FCC approved a six-year transfer process that would transition money from the Universal Service Fund to a new $4.5 billion a year Connect America Fund that will support the expansion of broadband services to areas that don't have broadband access yet.<ref name=PCWorld_1 /><ref name=FCC_CAF1 />\n\nIn June, 2015, the FCC announced steps to modernize and reform Lifeline for broadband.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=http://usac.org/_res/documents/about/pdf/annual-reports/usac-annual-report-Interactive-Layout-2014.pdf|title=USAC 2014 Annual Report|author=Universal Service Administration Company|accessdate=28 Jan 2016}}</ref> Public comments were sought, with a deadline of August 31, 2015.

In addition, CGB's plan should address best practices for increasing the digital skills of those already online and how those best practices can be spread throughout the digital inclusion community.\n\n==Components==\nUSF's money is funded and then spent amongst the fund's four programs.

Currently, all telecommunications companies that provide service between states, including long-distance companies, local telephone companies, wireless telephone companies, paging companies, and payphone providers, are required to contribute to the federal Universal Service Fund.

This anticipated move caused an uproar from FCC Democratic commissioners who were concerned about the money being allocated to large corporations instead of the citizens. FCC commissioner, Jessica Rosenworcel stated that this move \"sacrificed $50 million in annual interest that could have been used to support rural broadband, telemedicine & internet in schools.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/05/04/fcc_8bn_us_treasury_universal_service_fund/|title=FCC shifts its $8bn pot of gold, sparks fears of corporate money grab|last=McCarthy|first=Kieren|date=May 4, 2018|work=The Register|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}</ref> Although lawmakers and commissioners claimed that this move was unexpected, there was a letter previously written to the General Accountability Office (GAO) in January 2018 asking for a review on the plan to review the funds. The GAO claimed that the USF funds are not regulated as intensively as other government funds, so this move was an attempt to \"improve management and oversight of the funds.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/05/04/fcc_8bn_us_treasury_universal_service_fund/|title=FCC shifts its $8bn pot of gold, sparks fears of corporate money grab|last=McCarthy|first=Kieren|date=May 4, 2018|work=|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 2018 USF changes, VoIP service providers are now required to provide funds for the USF. For example, Vonage must charge an additional 10.10% fee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://businesssupport.vonage.com/articles/Answer/Federal-Program-Fee-USF-21739|title=Federal Program Fee (USF)|last=Vonage Business Support|date=April 1, 2018|access-date=May 30, 2018}}</ref> However, they are exempt from the cost of using the Internet for information transport whereas DSL internet providers and modern cable services must burden the cost. This expands cost distortion to long-distance telephone providers and it raises the cost of telecommunications service for more consumers.<ref name=\"Frieden\"/>\n\nOn May 21, the FCC issued an order that prohibited USF programs from buying equipment from Chinese telecommunications companies Huawei and ZTE. These companies are considered a risk to national security by American intelligence agencies. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow commented that the Trump Administration are \u00a8aware of security issues, sanctions issues, technology theft issues, et cetera.\u00a8<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://broadbandbreakfast.com/2018/05/zte-will-not-be-let-off-scot-free-if-export-ban-is-lifted-kudlow-says/|title=ZTE Not Part of China Trade Talks, Will Not be Let off 'Scot-Free' if Export Ban is Lifted, Kudlow Says|last=Feinberg|first=Andrew|date=May 21, 2018|website=Broadbandbreakfast.com|access-date=May 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Declining revenues===\nThe rapidly changing interstate and international telecommunications markets can quickly and unpredictably bring about changes in USF funding levels. Dorothy Attwood of the FCC Wireline Competition Bureau stated, \"One striking development that we've witnessed in the interstate marketplace is the steady decline of interstate revenues. Although traditional long-distance revenues grew consistently between 1984 and 1997, they're now in a period of steady decline\". She pointed out that competition in the interstate long-distance market, wireless substitution, and bundling of service packages that blur traditional service categories are all reducing revenues that serve to finance the USF.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-107shrg93053/html/CHRG-107shrg93053.htm|title=The Future of Universal Service: Ensuring the Sufficiency and Stability of the Fund|publisher=US Government Printing Office|author=107th Congress, US Senate Subcommittee on Communications|date=19 Jun 2002|accessdate=22 Nov 2014}}</ref> Service providers simply transferred the cost to customers in the form of a long-distance surcharge to make up for reduced revenue. While the expenditures of the USF have increased since its inception, in part due to expansion of support paid to competitive providers, the revenues on which contributions are made&nbsp;\u2013 interstate and international telecommunications revenues&nbsp;\u2013 have become increasingly more difficult for contributors to identify as a result of evolution of services offered.  Overall revenues reported by telecommunications companies have steadily increased, if information service revenues are included. However, the revenues for these services are no longer subject to contribution.\n\n==Proposed reform==\n\n===Expanding revenue sources===\nDebate over the Universal Service Fund has consistently involved the scope of the funding, which technology types and companies should fund the program, which groups should be eligible for benefits, and the need to clean up waste and fraud in the program. Proposals have been made to increase the number of sources from which universal service fund is collected. This could include expanding contributions to include intrastate telephone services (calls within single states), voice over IP (computer-to-computer calls), and information services such as broadband, and increasing contribution requirements from wireless communication providers.\n\n===Failed legislation===\nA draft proposal of the [[Telecommunications Act of 2005]] was the subject of hearings in Congress. The proposal outlined a significant restructuring of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, ultimately the House of Representatives passed a bill, the [[Communications Opportunity, Promotion, and Enhancement Act of 2006]] (COPE \u2013 H.R.5252.RS, S.2686).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/senate-bill/02686/all-actions-without-amendments|title=Actions \u2013 S.2686 \u2013 109th Congress (2005\u20132006): Communications, Consumer's Choice, and Broadband Deployment Act of 2006|first=Ted|last=Stevens|date=June 13, 2006|website=www.congress.gov}}</ref>  The bill was sent from the House to the Senate, where subsequent readings left it awaiting a legislative action.  Under the proposed restructuring of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, greater emphasis on the wide availability of broadband and mobile access would be considered.  Additionally, consideration of revenue contribution to the Universal Service Fund would be radically revised, given that the creation of obligatory broadband and mobile communication access would require a wide range of broadband, mobile, and [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) service providers to contribute a portion of their revenue to the fund.  Lastly, the Act urged an FCC consideration of the universal service structure. The bill was not passed.\n\nIn January 2007, Senator [[Ted Stevens]] (R-AK) sponsored a bill (the Universal Service for Americans Act) that would increase universal service tax base to include broadband ISPs and VoIP providers, to fund broadband deployment in rural and low-income regions of the country. This bill was referred to committee, but as no further action was taken on it by the 110th Congress, the bill never became law.<ref>The Library of Congress. (2009). S.101.

The measure is intended to improve and modernize the USF by reining in the size of the fund and promoting broadband deployment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boucher.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2009%3Aboucher-terry-introduce-universal-service-reform-act-of-2010-july-22-2010&catid=33&Itemid=41 |title=Boucher, Terry Introduce Universal Service Reform Act of 2010 |accessdate=November 20, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100804000901/http://www.boucher.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2009%3Aboucher-terry-introduce-universal-service-reform-act-of-2010-july-22-2010&catid=33&Itemid=41 |archivedate=August 4, 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Supporting natural monopolies===\nThe status quo only benefits powerful telecommunications companies. In the interest of reducing waste, limited support to a monopoly universal service provider for each territory has been considered. Wireless technology is increasingly favored by consumers, and can cover a single territory often for less than landline technology. However, wireless has traditionally been a competitive industry, which has resulted in a variety of innovative services for consumers, but means that supporting wireless companies requires a complex understanding of how to allocate funding on a shared basis, in order to avoid injury to the positive forces of competition.\n\n=== Expanding rural broadband ===\nIn March 2016, the FCC unanimously voted to provide $20 billion over the next 10 years in \"support for small carriers.\" The previous FCC chairman [[Tom Wheeler]] under the Obama Administration implemented this reform. The FCC will be offering the fund $20 billion over the next 10 years to support service in \"high cost areas.\" This reform is a modernization of the program support of broadband in \"high cost areas.\" It will target communities that most need support. Reformation of the Lifeline program included minimum service requirement standards implemented to ensure that consumers benefited the most from the program. Pai and the proponents of the budget cuts claim that the Lifeline program is being abused by resellers claiming that some recipients listed in the databases are deceased or do not exist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/lifeline-program-affordable-internet-poor-fcc-chairman-proposal.htm|title=FCC Chairman Wants to Cut Back Program That Helps Poor People Get Affordable Internet|last=Mak|first=Aaron|date=April 5, 2018|website=Slate.com|access-date=May 30, 2018}}</ref> Pai's hope is that this budget cut will stimulate the free market and allow existing broadband networks to expand their infrastructure into the rural areas. These small carriers are also known as \"rate-of-return\" carriers; these carriers have made significant progress in recent years but many still do not have access to \"terrestrial fixed broadband.\" The reform is made up of three main elements: \"Modernizes Existing Universal Service Program for Rate-of-Return Carriers\", \"Create Two Paths to a 'Connect America Fund' for Rate-of Return Carriers\" and \"Increase Fiscal Responsibility in the Universal Service Fund.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-338664A1.docx|title=FCC Moves to Expand Rural Broadband Deployment by Modernizing and Reforming Universal Service Support for Small Carriers|last=|first=|date=March 30, 2016|website=Federal Communications Commission|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, new FCC chairman under the Trump Administration, [[Ajit Varadaraj Pai]], plans to keep rural areas a priority. He wants to bridge \"the digital divide between rural and urban areas\" by working on \"expanding broadband options\". Pai believes that there is waste occurring between the private and public sectors as private capital is already being given to areas in order to build out networks. However, some of these areas are still being subsidized. Pai intends to make sure that broadband accessibility is included in an  infrastructure bill to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thehill.com/policy/technology/317637-senators-push-fcc-chief-to-boost-rural-broadband|title=Lawmakers push FCC chief to boost rural broadband|last=Breland|first=Ali|date=February 2, 2017|website=The Hill|access-date=}}</ref> This decision from Pai is reducing the impact of the Lifeline program, some even speculating that he may eventually dismantle the entire program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views/2017/02/08/new-fcc-chairman-ajit-pai-orwellian-start|title=New FCC Chairman Ajit Pai Is Off to an Orwellian Start|last=Floberg|first=Dana|date=February 8, 2017|website=CommonDreams|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nOut of the four USF programs, the Lifeline program is currently the only one without a strict budget cap. Lifeline can go over its current budget as long as the FCC provides a reason as to why they need to spend more money.

As stated above, this will most likely change as the FCC is reviewing Pai's proposal on November 16, 2017 to set a budget cap on the Lifeline program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/10/fcc-chair-wants-to-impose-a-cap-on-broadband-funding-for-poor-families/|title=FCC chair wants to impose a cap on broadband funding for poor families|last=Brodkin|first=Jon|date=2017-10-30|website=arsTechnica|access-date=November 5, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[E-Rate]]\n* [[National broadband plans from around the world]]\n* [[Rural electrification]]\n* [[National Exchange Carrier Association]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.fcc.gov/wcb/tapd/universal_service/ FCC website]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20071012110820/http://www.freepress.net/issues/universalaccess Universal Access (Free Press)]\n* [http://www.usac.org Universal Service Administrative Company]\n** [http://www.usac.org/about/about/universal-service/default.aspx About the USAC]\n** [http://www.usac.org/sl/ Schools & Libraries]\n** [http://www.usac.org/hc/ High Cost]\n** [http://www.usac.org/li/ Low Income]\n** [http://www.usac.org/rhc/ Rural Healthcare]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090503082958/http://energycommerce.house.gov/Press_110/110nr313.shtml Committee on Energy and Commerce]\n\n{{Contemporary social welfare programs in the United States}}\n\n[[Category:United States communications regulation]]\n[[Category:Non-profit organizations based in the United States]]\n[[Category:Federal Communications Commission]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|American system of telecommunications subsidies and fees}}\nThe '''Universal Service Fund''' ('''USF''') is a system of telecommunications subsidies and fees managed by the United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) intended to promote universal access to telecommunications services in the United States.

The government asserted that a monopolistic telephone industry would best serve the goal of creating a \"universal\" network with compatible technology country-wide for telephone consumers.  Regulators emphasized limits on profits, enforcing \"reasonable\" prices for service, setting levels of depreciation and investment for new technology and equipment, dependability and \"universality\" of service.  \"Universal\" was originally used by AT&T to mean, \"interconnection to other networks, not service to all customers\".  After years of regulation, the term came to include infrastructural development of telephony and service to everyone at a reasonable price.<ref name=\"Aufderheide, P. 1999\">Aufderheide, P., & United States.

It calls for \"rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges\" to \"all the people of the United States.\"  Communications Act of 1934 \u2013 Title I, Sec. 1 [47 U.S.C. 151] The Communications Act of 1934 first established the concept of making affordable basic telephone service available to everyone everywhere within a nation, state, or other governmental jurisdiction.\n\nTo comply with the act, AT&T began increasing the price of long-distance service to pay for universal service.  The act also established the FCC to oversee all non-governmental broadcasting, interstate communications, as well as international communication which originate or terminate in the United States.\n\nBefore the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Universal Service Fund (USF) operated as a mechanism by which interstate long-distance carriers were assessed to subsidize telephone service to low-income households and high-cost areas in order to ensure that all the people in the United States have access to rapid, efficient, nationwide communications service with sufficient facilities at realistic charges.<ref>Communication Act of 1934.

The predominant method used for financing subsidies for the underprivileged was to reallocate profit margins made by long-distance telecommunication to funds for local telephone connection. This process began in the mid 1960 and was institutionalized through the Ozark plan of 1970 into action. At the time of the institutionalization telephone penetration ranged between 85\u201395%.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n===Era of deregulation===\nThere was a push for deregulating the telecommunications industry in the 1980s.

The act addresses new challenges and opportunities of the digital information age, with the goal of promoting an economic environment conducive for the growth of new information technology.  It also further developed the meaning and implementation of universal service.  The act calls for the creation of a joint federal-state board to make recommendations to the FCC on defining federal universal services and set time tables.  The act also set out immediate priorities of universal service.  These include quality and reasonably priced services, access to advanced telecommunication services, access for rural, low-income and high-cost regions, equitable and nondiscriminatory service, specific and predictable price structure, access of advanced telecommunication services for schools and health care and libraries (Sec. 254(b)(1)-(7)).  The act provided ability in the constantly changing telecommunication environment to periodically revisit and adjust universal service, while setting core principles (Sec. 254(c)).

Members of Congress have spoken out in favor of increased contribution to the USF from alternate sources.\n\nMany of the services covered by the USF are related to traditional telephone technology.  There is a rising concern that more recent developments in telecommunications are just as important to the consumer as these older technologies. For example, consumers' subscriptions to traditional telephone services have fallen while their subscription rate to wireless services have been rising consistently.  Yet many cellular companies are likely to receive less funding under the new rules, which may reduce consumers' access to wireless services in areas of the country that have low populations.  Similarly, a question currently debated is whether access to [[broadband internet]] should be supported by the USF and if so, how best to fulfill such a large mandate without damaging the stability of the fund.  The Telecommunications Act of 1996 states that \"advanced services\" should be accessible to all Americans [Section 254(b)(3)].  One question is whether the providers of internet access should contribute to the fund like other companies that provide access to telecommunications, if such providers also want to draw from the fund. Supporters of including internet access in the Universal Service Fund include former Congressman [[Rick Boucher]] (D-VA)<ref>Subcommittee on Communication, Technology and the Internet.

In March 2009, senior executives from Verizon Communications met with the House Subcommittee on Communications, Technology, and the Internet, providing recommendations for how best to proceed bringing broadband and mobile communication access to rural and unserved areas.  Citing reform to the Universal Service Fund as a means \"to better serve rural America,\" Verizon recommended that a limit be set on the size of USF's high-cost fund, competitive bidding wars be employed to determine which company expand service to unserved areas, structure a \"wire-center approach\" model to replace statewide cost averaging, restructure how contributions to the USF are determined, and impose a deadline on the FCC for completion of their reform of inter-carrier compensation.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=PRNewswire|title=Stimulus Grants, Subsidy Reform Key to Making Broadband Internet Available to All|date=12 Mar 2009|accessdate=17 Jul 2009|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/stimulus-grants-subsidy-reform-key-to-making-broadband-internet-available-to-all-61811202.html|author=Verizon}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2011 the FCC formally proposed a \"Connect America Fund\" to address these and other concerns.<ref>[http://www.electronista.com/articles/11/10/06/fcc.says.usf.becoming.connect.america.fund/FCC details Universal Service Fund switch to broadband] Electronista, Oct 9, 2011.</ref> Reform finally arrived on October 27, 2011, when the FCC approved a six-year transfer process that would transition money from the Universal Service Fund to a new $4.5 billion a year Connect America Fund that will support the expansion of broadband services to areas that don't have broadband access yet.<ref name=PCWorld_1 /><ref name=FCC_CAF1 />\n\nIn June, 2015, the FCC announced steps to modernize and reform Lifeline for broadband.<ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite web|url=http://usac.org/_res/documents/about/pdf/annual-reports/usac-annual-report-Interactive-Layout-2014.pdf|title=USAC 2014 Annual Report|author=Universal Service Administration Company|accessdate=28 Jan 2016}}</ref> Public comments were sought, with a deadline of August 31, 2015.

In addition, CGB's plan should address best practices for increasing the digital skills of those already online and how those best practices can be spread throughout the digital inclusion community.\n\n==Components==\nUSF's money is funded and then spent amongst the fund's four programs.

In June 2006, the FCC voted to require providers of VoIP services to contribute to the Universal Service Fund the same way [[Public switched telephone network|traditional telephone services]] had been contributing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/FCC-approves-new-Internet-phone-taxes/2100-7352_3-6086437.html|title=FCC approves new Internet phone taxes|publisher=Cnet|author=Anne Broache|date=21 Jun 2006|accessdate=20 Nov 2014}}</ref>\n\nWhile the USAC cannot act without Congressional approval, it can make recommendations. USAC recommendations have resulted in expanding telecommunication resources, particularly broadband Internet and mobile access to schools and libraries, and recognizing VoIP as a form of interstate and international communication, which requires those companies providing VoIP services to contribute to the USF.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Universal Service Administrative Company|title=Federal Universal Service Support Mechanisms Quarterly Contribution Base for the First Quarter 2009|accessdate=17 July 2009|url=http://www.universalservice.org/about/governance/fcc-filings/2009/Q1/1Q2009%20Contribution%20Base%20Filing%20FINAL.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Federal Communications Commission===\n{{see also|Federal Communications Commission}}\nThe FCC oversees the USAC's administration of the Universal Service Fund, and institutes reforms as it sees fit.

Gilroy stated, \"The ability to ensure that only eligible services are funded, that funding is disbursed at the proper level of discount, that alleged services have been received, and the integrity of the competitive bidding process is upheld have been questioned\".

This anticipated move caused an uproar from FCC Democratic commissioners who were concerned about the money being allocated to large corporations instead of the citizens. FCC commissioner, Jessica Rosenworcel stated that this move \"sacrificed $50 million in annual interest that could have been used to support rural broadband, telemedicine & internet in schools.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/05/04/fcc_8bn_us_treasury_universal_service_fund/|title=FCC shifts its $8bn pot of gold, sparks fears of corporate money grab|last=McCarthy|first=Kieren|date=May 4, 2018|work=The Register|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}</ref> Although lawmakers and commissioners claimed that this move was unexpected, there was a letter previously written to the General Accountability Office (GAO) in January 2018 asking for a review on the plan to review the funds. The GAO claimed that the USF funds are not regulated as intensively as other government funds, so this move was an attempt to \"improve management and oversight of the funds.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/05/04/fcc_8bn_us_treasury_universal_service_fund/|title=FCC shifts its $8bn pot of gold, sparks fears of corporate money grab|last=McCarthy|first=Kieren|date=May 4, 2018|work=|access-date=2018-05-30|language=en}}</ref>\n\nAfter the 2018 USF changes, VoIP service providers are now required to provide funds for the USF. For example, Vonage must charge an additional 10.10% fee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://businesssupport.vonage.com/articles/Answer/Federal-Program-Fee-USF-21739|title=Federal Program Fee (USF)|last=Vonage Business Support|date=April 1, 2018|access-date=May 30, 2018}}</ref> However, they are exempt from the cost of using the Internet for information transport whereas DSL internet providers and modern cable services must burden the cost. This expands cost distortion to long-distance telephone providers and it raises the cost of telecommunications service for more consumers.<ref name=\"Frieden\"/>\n\nOn May 21, the FCC issued an order that prohibited USF programs from buying equipment from Chinese telecommunications companies Huawei and ZTE. These companies are considered a risk to national security by American intelligence agencies. National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow commented that the Trump Administration are \u00a8aware of security issues, sanctions issues, technology theft issues, et cetera.\u00a8<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://broadbandbreakfast.com/2018/05/zte-will-not-be-let-off-scot-free-if-export-ban-is-lifted-kudlow-says/|title=ZTE Not Part of China Trade Talks, Will Not be Let off 'Scot-Free' if Export Ban is Lifted, Kudlow Says|last=Feinberg|first=Andrew|date=May 21, 2018|website=Broadbandbreakfast.com|access-date=May 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Declining revenues===\nThe rapidly changing interstate and international telecommunications markets can quickly and unpredictably bring about changes in USF funding levels. Dorothy Attwood of the FCC Wireline Competition Bureau stated, \"One striking development that we've witnessed in the interstate marketplace is the steady decline of interstate revenues. Although traditional long-distance revenues grew consistently between 1984 and 1997, they're now in a period of steady decline\". She pointed out that competition in the interstate long-distance market, wireless substitution, and bundling of service packages that blur traditional service categories are all reducing revenues that serve to finance the USF.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-107shrg93053/html/CHRG-107shrg93053.htm|title=The Future of Universal Service: Ensuring the Sufficiency and Stability of the Fund|publisher=US Government Printing Office|author=107th Congress, US Senate Subcommittee on Communications|date=19 Jun 2002|accessdate=22 Nov 2014}}</ref> Service providers simply transferred the cost to customers in the form of a long-distance surcharge to make up for reduced revenue. While the expenditures of the USF have increased since its inception, in part due to expansion of support paid to competitive providers, the revenues on which contributions are made&nbsp;\u2013 interstate and international telecommunications revenues&nbsp;\u2013 have become increasingly more difficult for contributors to identify as a result of evolution of services offered.  Overall revenues reported by telecommunications companies have steadily increased, if information service revenues are included. However, the revenues for these services are no longer subject to contribution.\n\n==Proposed reform==\n\n===Expanding revenue sources===\nDebate over the Universal Service Fund has consistently involved the scope of the funding, which technology types and companies should fund the program, which groups should be eligible for benefits, and the need to clean up waste and fraud in the program. Proposals have been made to increase the number of sources from which universal service fund is collected. This could include expanding contributions to include intrastate telephone services (calls within single states), voice over IP (computer-to-computer calls), and information services such as broadband, and increasing contribution requirements from wireless communication providers.\n\n===Failed legislation===\nA draft proposal of the [[Telecommunications Act of 2005]] was the subject of hearings in Congress. The proposal outlined a significant restructuring of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, ultimately the House of Representatives passed a bill, the [[Communications Opportunity, Promotion, and Enhancement Act of 2006]] (COPE \u2013 H.R.5252.RS, S.2686).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/senate-bill/02686/all-actions-without-amendments|title=Actions \u2013 S.2686 \u2013 109th Congress (2005\u20132006): Communications, Consumer's Choice, and Broadband Deployment Act of 2006|first=Ted|last=Stevens|date=June 13, 2006|website=www.congress.gov}}</ref>  The bill was sent from the House to the Senate, where subsequent readings left it awaiting a legislative action.  Under the proposed restructuring of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, greater emphasis on the wide availability of broadband and mobile access would be considered.  Additionally, consideration of revenue contribution to the Universal Service Fund would be radically revised, given that the creation of obligatory broadband and mobile communication access would require a wide range of broadband, mobile, and [[Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VoIP) service providers to contribute a portion of their revenue to the fund.  Lastly, the Act urged an FCC consideration of the universal service structure. The bill was not passed.\n\nIn January 2007, Senator [[Ted Stevens]] (R-AK) sponsored a bill (the Universal Service for Americans Act) that would increase universal service tax base to include broadband ISPs and VoIP providers, to fund broadband deployment in rural and low-income regions of the country. This bill was referred to committee, but as no further action was taken on it by the 110th Congress, the bill never became law.<ref>The Library of Congress. (2009). S.101.

In the interest of reducing waste, limited support to a monopoly universal service provider for each territory has been considered. Wireless technology is increasingly favored by consumers, and can cover a single territory often for less than landline technology. However, wireless has traditionally been a competitive industry, which has resulted in a variety of innovative services for consumers, but means that supporting wireless companies requires a complex understanding of how to allocate funding on a shared basis, in order to avoid injury to the positive forces of competition.\n\n=== Expanding rural broadband ===\nIn March 2016, the FCC unanimously voted to provide $20 billion over the next 10 years in \"support for small carriers.\" The previous FCC chairman [[Tom Wheeler]] under the Obama Administration implemented this reform. The FCC will be offering the fund $20 billion over the next 10 years to support service in \"high cost areas.\" This reform is a modernization of the program support of broadband in \"high cost areas.\" It will target communities that most need support. Reformation of the Lifeline program included minimum service requirement standards implemented to ensure that consumers benefited the most from the program. Pai and the proponents of the budget cuts claim that the Lifeline program is being abused by resellers claiming that some recipients listed in the databases are deceased or do not exist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/technology/2018/04/lifeline-program-affordable-internet-poor-fcc-chairman-proposal.htm|title=FCC Chairman Wants to Cut Back Program That Helps Poor People Get Affordable Internet|last=Mak|first=Aaron|date=April 5, 2018|website=Slate.com|access-date=May 30, 2018}}</ref> Pai's hope is that this budget cut will stimulate the free market and allow existing broadband networks to expand their infrastructure into the rural areas. These small carriers are also known as \"rate-of-return\" carriers; these carriers have made significant progress in recent years but many still do not have access to \"terrestrial fixed broadband.\" The reform is made up of three main elements: \"Modernizes Existing Universal Service Program for Rate-of-Return Carriers\", \"Create Two Paths to a 'Connect America Fund' for Rate-of Return Carriers\" and \"Increase Fiscal Responsibility in the Universal Service Fund.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DOC-338664A1.docx|title=FCC Moves to Expand Rural Broadband Deployment by Modernizing and Reforming Universal Service Support for Small Carriers|last=|first=|date=March 30, 2016|website=Federal Communications Commission|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, new FCC chairman under the Trump Administration, [[Ajit Varadaraj Pai]], plans to keep rural areas a priority. He wants to bridge \"the digital divide between rural and urban areas\" by working on \"expanding broadband options\". Pai believes that there is waste occurring between the private and public sectors as private capital is already being given to areas in order to build out networks. However, some of these areas are still being subsidized. Pai intends to make sure that broadband accessibility is included in an  infrastructure bill to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thehill.com/policy/technology/317637-senators-push-fcc-chief-to-boost-rural-broadband|title=Lawmakers push FCC chief to boost rural broadband|last=Breland|first=Ali|date=February 2, 2017|website=The Hill|access-date=}}</ref> This decision from Pai is reducing the impact of the Lifeline program, some even speculating that he may eventually dismantle the entire program.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views/2017/02/08/new-fcc-chairman-ajit-pai-orwellian-start|title=New FCC Chairman Ajit Pai Is Off to an Orwellian Start|last=Floberg|first=Dana|date=February 8, 2017|website=CommonDreams|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nOut of the four USF programs, the Lifeline program is currently the only one without a strict budget cap.

It was the capital city of a major [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic period]] kingdom from the 5th to 9th&nbsp;centuries AD. The city was in the extreme southeast of the [[Mesoamerica]]n cultural region, on the frontier with the [[Isthmo-Colombian]] cultural region, and was almost surrounded by non-[[Maya peoples]].<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 339\">{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=339}}.</ref>\n\nCop\u00e1n was occupied for more than two thousand years, from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Preclassic]] period to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]].

Additionally, there was an estimated rural population of 3,000 to 4,000 in a {{convert|476|km2|sqmi|adj=on|sp=us}} area of the Cop\u00e1n Valley, giving an estimated total population of 18,000 to 25,000 people in the valley during the Late Classic period.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=688}}\n\n==History==\nLittle is known of the rulers of Cop\u00e1n before the founding of a new dynasty with its origins at [[Tikal]] in the early 5th&nbsp;century AD, although the city's origins can be traced back to the Preclassic period.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 333; Martin & Grube 2000, p. 193\">{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=333}}; {{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=193}}.</ref> After this, Cop\u00e1n became one of the more powerful Maya city states and was a regional power in the southern Maya region.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 339\"/>  However, it suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of its former vassal state [[Quirigua]] in 738, when the long-ruling king [[Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]] was captured and beheaded by Quirigua's ruler [[K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat]] (Cauac Sky).{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=482}} Although this was a major setback, Cop\u00e1n's rulers began to build monumental structures again within a few decades.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, pp. 206\u2013207\"/>\n\nThe area of Cop\u00e1n continued to be occupied after the last major ceremonial structures and royal monuments were erected, but the population declined in the 8th and 9th&nbsp;centuries from perhaps over 20,000 in the city to less than 5,000.  This decrease in population took over four centuries to actually show signs of collapse, showing the stability of this site even after the fall of the ruling dynasties and royal families.{{sfn|Snow|2010|p=267}} The ceremonial center was long abandoned and the surrounding valley home to only a few farming hamlets at the time of the arrival of the [[Spain|Spanish]] in the 16th&nbsp;century.\n\n===Rulers===\n{{Main|List of rulers of Cop\u00e1n}}\nReferences to the predynastic rulers of Cop\u00e1n are found in later texts, but none of these texts predate the refounding of Cop\u00e1n in AD&nbsp;426.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 333\">{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=333}}.</ref>\n[[File:Copan St H.jpg|thumb|right|Stela H at Cop\u00e1n, commissioned by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 203\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=203}}.</ref>]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n!Name (or nickname) !!Ruled !!Dynastic<br />succession no. !!Alternative names\n|-\n|[[K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo']]\n|426 \u2013 c. 437\n|1\n|Great-Sun First Quetzal Macaw\n|-\n|[[K'inich Popol Hol]]\n|c. 437\n|2\n|Great-Sun\n|-\n|name unknown\n|c. 455\n|3\n|[[Ruler 3 (Cop\u00e1n)|Ruler 3]]\n|-\n|[[Ku Ix]]\n|c. 465\n|4\n|K'altuun Hix, Tuun K'ab' Hix\n|-\n|name unknown\n|c. 476\n|5\n|[[Ruler 5 (Cop\u00e1n)|Ruler 5]]\n|-\n|[[Muyal Jol]]\n|c. 485\n|6\n|Ruler 6\n|-\n|[[B'alam Nehn]]\n|504\u2013544\n|7\n|Jaguar Mirror; Waterlily-Jaguar\n|-\n|[[Wil Ohl K'inich]]{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=336}}\n|532\u2013551\n|8\n|Ruler 8; Head on Earth\n|-\n|[[Sak-Lu]]\n|551\u2013553\n|9\n|Ruler 9\n|-\n|[[Tzi-B'alam]]\n|553\u2013578\n|10\n|Moon Jaguar\n|-\n|[[K'ak' Chan Yopaat]]{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=337}}\n|578\u2013628\n|11\n|B'utz' Chan; Smoke Serpent\n|-\n|[[Chan Imix K'awiil]]\n|628\u2013695\n|12\n|Smoke Jaguar; Smoke Imix\n|-\n|[[Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]]\n|695\u2013738\n|13\n|18 Rabbit\n|-\n|[[Ajaw K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil]]\n|738\u2013749\n|14\n|Smoke Monkey\n|-\n|[[Ajaw K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil]]\n|749\u2013763\n|15\n|Smoke Shell; Smoke Squirrel\n|-\n|[[Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat]]\n|763 \u2013 after 810\n|16\n|Yax Pac\n|-\n|[[Ukit Took]]\n|822\n|17?\n|&ndash;\n|}\n\n===Predynastic history===\nThe fertile Cop\u00e1n River valley was long a site of agriculture before the first known stone architecture was built in the region about the 9th&nbsp;century BC. The city was important before its refounding by a foreign elite; mentions of the predynastic history of Cop\u00e1n are found in later texts, but none of these predates the refounding of the city in AD&nbsp;426.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 333; Martin & Grube 2000, p. 193\"/> There is an inscription that refers to the year 321&nbsp;BC, but no text explains the significance of this date.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 193\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=193}}.</ref> An event at Cop\u00e1n is linked to another event that happened 208&nbsp;days before in AD&nbsp;159 at an unknown location that is also mentioned on a stela from Tikal, suggesting that it is a location somewhere in the Pet\u00e9n Basin, possibly the great Preclassic Maya city of [[El Mirador]].<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 333\"/> This AD&nbsp;159 date is mentioned in several texts and is linked to a figure known as \"Foliated [[Ajaw]]\". This same person is mentioned on the carved skull of a [[peccary]] recovered from Tomb&nbsp;1, where he is said to perform an action with a stela in AD&nbsp;376.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 193\"/>\n\n===K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and K'inich Popol Hol===\n[[File:Yax Kuk Mo.jpg|thumb|left|Ceramic lid shaped to represent K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', recovered from the tomb of the 7th-century king Smoke Imix, under Temple&nbsp;26.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 202\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=202}}.</ref>]]\nThe city was refounded by [[K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo']], establishing it as the capital of a new Maya kingdom.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 339\"/> This coup was apparently organized and launched from Tikal. Texts record the arrival of a warrior named K'uk' Mo' Ajaw who was installed upon the throne of the city in AD&nbsp;426 and given a new royal name, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and the ''ochk'in kaloomte'' \"Lord of the West\" title used a generation earlier by [[Siyaj K'ak']], a general from the great metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]] who had decisively intervened in the politics of the central Pet\u00e9n.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=322, 333\u2013338}} K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' was probably from Tikal and was likely to have been sponsored by Siyaj Chan K'awill&nbsp;II, the 16th&nbsp;ruler in the dynastic succession of Tikal. K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' may have legitimized his claim to rulership by marrying into the old Cop\u00e1n royal family, evidenced from the remains of his presumed widow. Bone analysis of her remains indicates that she was local to Cop\u00e1n.<ref>{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=196}}; {{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=338}}.</ref> After the establishment of the new kingdom of Cop\u00e1n, the city remained closely allied with Tikal.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=338}} The hieroglyphic text on [[Cop\u00e1n Altar Q]] describes the lord being elevated to kingship with the receipt of his royal scepter. The ceremonies involved in the founding of the Cop\u00e1n dynasty also included the installation of a subordinate king at [[Quirigu\u00e1]].{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|p=192}}\n\nA text from Tikal mentions K'uk' Mo' and has been dated to AD&nbsp;406, 20 years before K'uk' Mo' Ajaw founded the new dynasty at Cop\u00e1n. Both names are likely to refer to the same individual originally from Tikal. Although none of the hieroglyphic texts that mention the founding of the new Cop\u00e1n dynasty describe how K'uk' Mo' arrived at the city, indirect evidence suggests that he conquered the city by military means. On Altar&nbsp;Q he is depicted as a Teotihuacano warrior with goggle eyes and a war serpent shield.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=338, 341\u2013342}} When he arrived at Cop\u00e1n he initiated the construction of various structures, including one temple in the [[talud-tablero]] style typical of Teotihuacan and another with inset corners and apron moldings that are characteristic of Tikal. These strong links with both the Maya and Central Mexican cultures suggest that he was at least a Mexicanized Maya or possibly even from Teotihuacan.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 193\"/> The dynasty founded by king K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' ruled the city for four centuries and included sixteen kings plus a probable pretender who would have been seventeenth in line. Several monuments have survived that were dedicated by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and by his heir.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 342\">{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=342}}.</ref>\n\nK'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' died between AD&nbsp;435 and AD&nbsp;437. In 1995 a tomb underneath the talud-tablero Hunal temple was discovered by a team of archaeologists led by [[Robert Sharer]] and David Sedat. The tomb contained the skeleton of an elderly man with rich offerings and evidence of battle wounds. The remains have been identified as those of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' due to their location underneath a sequence of seven buildings erected in his honor. Bone analysis has identified the remains as being those of someone foreign to Cop\u00e1n.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 193\"/>\n\n[[File:Cop\u00e1n Stela 63.jpg|thumb|right|Stela 63, probably dating to the reign of K'inich Popol Hol.{{sfn|Sharer|Sedat|2005|pp=174\u2013175}}]]\nK'inich Popol Hol inherited the throne of Cop\u00e1n from K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', who was his father. He undertook major construction projects with the redesign of the core of Cop\u00e1n. Popol Hol is not the original name of this king but rather a nickname based on the appearance of his Teotihuacan-linked name glyph.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 194\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=194}}.</ref> K'inich Popol Hol oversaw the construction of the first version of the [[Mesoamerican ballcourt]] at the city, which was decorated with images of the [[scarlet macaw]], a bird that features prominently in [[Maya mythology]]. His greatest construction activity was in the area of his father's palace, now underlying Structure 10L-16, which he demolished after entombing his father there. He then built three successive buildings on top of the tomb in rapid succession.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|p=195}}\n\n===Other early dynastic rulers===\nVery little is known about Rulers 3 to 6 in the dynastic succession, although it is known from a fragment of a broken monument reused as construction fill in a later building that one of them was a son of Popol Hol. Ruler&nbsp;3 is depicted on the 8th-century Altar&nbsp;Q, but his name glyph has broken away. Ku&nbsp;Ix was the 4th&nbsp;ruler in the succession. He rebuilt temple 10L-26 in the Acropolis, erecting a stela there and a hieroglyphic step at its base. Although this king is also mentioned on a few other fragments of sculpture, no dates accompany his name. The next two kings in the dynastic sequence are only known from their sculptures on Altar&nbsp;Q.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 196\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=196}}.</ref>\n\nB'alam Nehn (often referred to as Waterlily Jaguar) was the first king to actually record his position in the dynastic succession, declaring that he was seventh in line from K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo'. Stela&nbsp;15 records that he was already ruling Cop\u00e1n by AD&nbsp;504. B'alam Nehn is the only king of Cop\u00e1n to be mentioned in a hieroglyphic text from outside of the southeastern Maya region. His name appears in a text on Stela&nbsp;16 from [[Caracol]], a site in [[Belize]]. The stela dates to AD&nbsp;534, but the text is not well understood.

His surviving monuments were found in the modern village of Cop\u00e1n Ruinas, which was a major complex during the Classic period. The most famous construction dating to his reign is the elaborate Rosalila phase of Temple&nbsp;16, discovered entombed intact under later phases of the temple during archaeological tunneling work.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, pp. 198\u2013199\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=198\u2013199}}</ref>\n\n===K'ak' Chan Yopaat and Smoke Imix===\nK'ak' Chan Yopaat was the eleventh dynastic ruler at Cop\u00e1n. He was crowned as king in AD&nbsp;578, 24&nbsp;days after the death of Moon Jaguar. At the time of his rule, Cop\u00e1n was undergoing an unprecedented rise in population, with residential land use spreading to all available land in the entire Cop\u00e1n Valley. The two surviving stelae of K'ak' Chan Yopaat contain long, hard-to-decipher hieroglyphic texts and are the oldest monuments at the site to survive without being either broken or buried. He reigned for 49&nbsp;years until his death on 5&nbsp;February 628. His name is recorded on four stelae erected by his successors, one of which describes a rite performed with relics from his tomb in AD&nbsp;730, almost a hundred years after his death.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nSmoke Imix was crowned 16 days after the death of K'ak' Chan Yopaat. He is thought to have been the longest reigning king of Cop\u00e1n, ruling from 628 to 695. He is believed to have been born in AD&nbsp;612 and to have become king at the age of 15. Archaeologists have recovered little evidence of activity for the first 26&nbsp;years of his reign, but in AD&nbsp;652 there was a sudden explosion of monument production, with two stelae being erected in the Great Plaza and a further four in important locations across the Cop\u00e1n Valley. These monuments all celebrated a [[k'atun]]-ending. He also erected a stela at the [[Santa Rita, Cop\u00e1n|Santa Rita]] site {{convert|12|km|mi|sp=us}} away and is mentioned on Altar&nbsp;L at Quirigu\u00e1 in relation to the same event in 652. It is thought that he was trying to stamp his authority throughout the whole valley after the end of some earlier restriction to his freedom to rule as he wished.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 201\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=201}}.</ref>\n\nAfter this sudden spate of activity, Smoke Imix continued to rule until almost the end of the 7th&nbsp;century; he dedicated another nine known monuments and made important changes to the architecture of Cop\u00e1n, including the construction of Structure&nbsp;2, which closes the northern side of the Great Plaza, and a new version of Temple&nbsp;26, nicknamed Chorcha. Smoke Imix ruled Cop\u00e1n for 67&nbsp;years and died on 15&nbsp;June 695 at the age of 79, an age that was so distinguished that it is used to identify him in place of his name on Altar&nbsp;Q. His tomb had already been prepared in the Chorcha phase of Temple&nbsp;26 and he was buried just two days after his death.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=202\u2013203}}\n\n===Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil===\n[[File:Copan (3831024263).jpg|thumb|left|Stela H, depicting king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]]\n[[Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]] was crowned as the 13th&nbsp;king in the Cop\u00e1n dynasty in July&nbsp;695. He oversaw both the apogee of Cop\u00e1n's achievements and also one of the city's most catastrophic political disasters. During his reign, the sculptural style of the city evolved into the full in-the-round sculpture characteristic of Cop\u00e1n. In AD&nbsp;718, Cop\u00e1n attacked and defeated the unidentified site of Xkuy, recording its burning on an unusual stone cylinder. In AD&nbsp;724 Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil installed [[K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat]] as a [[vassal]] on the throne of [[Quirigu\u00e1]]. Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was confident enough in his power to rank his city among the four most powerful states in the Maya region, together with Tikal, [[Calakmul]] and [[Palenque]], as recorded on Stela&nbsp;A. In contrast to his predecessor, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil concentrated his monuments in the site core of the Cop\u00e1n; his first was Stela&nbsp;J, dated to AD&nbsp;702 and erected at the eastern entrance to the city.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 203\"/>\n\nHe continued to erect a further seven high-quality stelae until AD&nbsp;736, monuments that are considered masterpieces of Classic Maya sculpture with such mastery of detail that they represent the highest pinnacle of Maya artistic achievement.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=203\u2013204}} The stelae depict king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil ritually posed and bearing the attributes of a variety of deities, including B'olon K'awiil, K'uy Nik Ajaw and Mo' Witz Ajaw.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 203\"/> The king also carried out major construction works, including a new version of Temple&nbsp;26 that now bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, plus two temples that have now been lost to the erosion of the Cop\u00e1n River. He also encased the Rosalila phase of Temple&nbsp;16 within a new phase of construction. He remodelled the ballcourt, then demolished it and built a new one in its place.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, pp. 204\u2013205\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=204\u2013205}}.</ref>\n\nUaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil had only recently dedicated the new ballcourt in AD&nbsp;738 when a completely unexpected disaster befell the city. Twelve years earlier he had installed K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat on the throne of Quirigu\u00e1 as his vassal.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=203, 205}} By 734 the king of Quirigu\u00e1 had shown he was no longer an obedient subordinate when he began to refer to himself as ''k'ul [[ajaw]]'', \"holy lord\", rather than simply as a subordinate lord ''ajaw''.{{sfn|Drew|1999| p=241}} K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat appears to have taken advantage of wider political rivalries and allied himself with [[Calakmul]], the sworn enemy of Tikal. Cop\u00e1n was firmly allied with Tikal and Calakmul used its alliance with Quirigu\u00e1 to undermine Tikal's key ally in the south.{{sfn|Looper|2003|p=79}}\n\nAlthough the exact details are unknown, in April&nbsp;738 K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat captured Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil and burned two of Cop\u00e1n's patron deities. Six days later Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was decapitated in Quirigu\u00e1.<ref>{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=204}}; {{harvnb|Looper|2003|p=76}}; {{harvnb|Miller|1999|pp=134\u2013135}}.</ref> This coup does not seem to have physically affected either Cop\u00e1n or Quirigu\u00e1; there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and the victor seems not to have received any detectable tribute.<ref>{{harvnb|Drew|1999|p=286}}; {{harvnb|Looper|2003|p=78}}.</ref> All of this seems to imply that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat managed to somehow ambush Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, rather than to have defeated him in outright battle. It has been suggested that Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was attempting to attack another site to secure captives for [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]] in order to dedicate the new ballcourt when he was ambushed by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his Quirigu\u00e1 warriors.{{sfn|Looper|2003|p=78}}\n\nIn the Late Classic, alliance with Calakmul was frequently associated with the promise of military support. The fact that Cop\u00e1n, a much more powerful city than Quirigu\u00e1, failed to retaliate against its former vassal implies that it feared the military intervention of Calakmul. Calakmul was far enough away from Quirigu\u00e1 that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat was not afraid of falling directly under its power as a full vassal state, even though it is likely that Calakmul sent warriors to help in the defeat of Cop\u00e1n. The alliance instead seems to have been one of mutual advantage: Calakmul managed to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal while Quirigu\u00e1 gained its independence.<ref>{{harvnb|Looper|1999|p=271}}; {{harvnb|Looper|2003|p=81}}.</ref> The disaster for Cop\u00e1n had long-lasting consequences; major construction ceased and no new monuments were raised for the next 17&nbsp;years.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|p=206}}\n\n===Later rulers===\nK'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil was installed as the 14th dynastic ruler of Cop\u00e1n on 7&nbsp;June 738, 39&nbsp;days after the execution of Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil. Little is known of his reign due to the lack of monuments raised after Quirigu\u00e1's surprise victory. Cop\u00e1n's defeat had wider implications due to the fracturing of the city's domain and the loss of the key [[Motagua River]] [[Trade in Maya civilization|trade route]] to Quirigu\u00e1. The fall in Cop\u00e1n's income and corresponding increase at Quirigu\u00e1 is evident from the massive commissioning of new monuments and architecture at the latter city, and Cop\u00e1n may even have been subject to its former vassal. K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil died in January&nbsp;749.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, pp. 206\u2013207\"/>\n\n[[File:Cop\u00e1n Stela N.jpg|thumb|left|Stela N, depicting K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 208\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=208}}.</ref>]]\nThe next ruler was K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil, a son of K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil. The early period of his rulership fell within Cop\u00e1n's hiatus, but later on he began a programme of renewal in an effort to recover from the city's earlier disaster. He built a new version of Temple&nbsp;26, with the Hieroglyphic Stairway being reinstalled on the new stairway and doubled in length. Five life-size statues of seated rulers were installed seated upon the stairway. K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil died in the early 760s and is likely to have been interred in Temple&nbsp;11, although the tomb has not yet been excavated.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, pp. 207\u2013208\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=207\u2013208}}.</ref>\n\nYax Pasaj Chan Yopaat was the next ruler, 16th in the dynasty founded by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', although he appears not to have been a direct descendant of his predecessor. He took the throne in June&nbsp;763 and may have been only 9&nbsp;years old.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 209\"/> He produced no monumental stelae and instead dedicated hieroglyphic texts incorporated into the city's architecture and smaller altars. Texts make an obscure reference to his father but his mother was a noblewoman from distant [[Palenque]] in Mexico. He built the platform of Temple&nbsp;11 over the tomb of the previous king in AD&nbsp;769 and added a two-storey superstructure that was finished in AD&nbsp;773.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 209\"/> Around AD&nbsp;776, he completed the final version of Temple&nbsp;16 over the tomb of the founder. At the base of the temple, he placed the famous Altar&nbsp;Q, which shows each of the 16&nbsp;rulers of the city from K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' through to Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat, with a hieroglyphic text on top describing the founding of the dynasty.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 210\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=210}}.</ref> By the latter 8th&nbsp;century, the nobility had become more powerful, raising palaces with hieroglyphic benches that were as richly constructed as those of the king.

The long line of kings at the once great city had come to an end. Before the end, even the nobility had been struck by disease, perhaps because epidemics among the malnourished masses spread to the elite. With the end of political authority at the city the population collapsed to a fraction of what it had been at its height.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 212\"/> This collapse of the city-state, which people believe occurred sometime between 800 and 830 AD, was sudden.

This platform was encased within another much larger platform within a decade of its construction. This larger platform has been named Margarita and had stucco panels flanking its access stairway that bore entwined images of [[Resplendent quetzal|quetzals]] and macaws, which both form a part of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo's name. The Margarita phase contained a [[Margarita Tomb|tomb]] with the richly accompanied burial of an elderly woman nicknamed the \"Lady in Red\". It is likely that she was the widow of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and the mother of K'inich Popol Hol. The upper chamber of the Margarita phase temple was converted to receive offerings and the unusual Xukpi stone, a dedicatory monument used in one of the earlier phases, was reused in this later phase.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=193\u2013196}}\n\n[[File:CPN Rosalila 01.jpg|thumb|left|Life-size reconstruction of the Rosalila temple at the site museum of Cop\u00e1n.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|p=199}}]]\nOne of the best preserved phases of Temple 16 is the Rosalila, built over the remains of five previous versions of the temple. Archaeologist Ricardo Agurcia discovered the almost intact shrine while tunneling underneath the final version of the temple. Rosalila is notable for its excellent state of preservation, including the entire building from the base platform up to the [[roof comb]], including its highly elaborate painted stucco decoration. Rosalila features K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' placed at the centre of a mythological tableau, combining the founder of the dynasty with the [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|sky deity]] [[Itzamna]] in avian form. The mythological imagery also includes [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] mountains, skeletons and crocodiles. Vents in the exterior were designed so smoke from incense being burned inside the shrine would interact with the stucco sculpture of the exterior. The temple had a hieroglyphic stone step with a dedicatory inscription. The stone step is less well preserved than the rest of the building, but a date in AD&nbsp;571 has been deciphered. Due to the deforestation of the Cop\u00e1n valley, the Rosalila building was the last structure at the site to use such elaborate stucco decoration \u2014 vast quantities of firewood could no longer be spared to reduce limestone to plaster. A life-size copy of the Rosalila building has been built at the Cop\u00e1n site museum.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, pp. 198\u2013199\"/>\n\nUaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil encased the Rosalila phase under a new version of the building in the early 8th&nbsp;century AD. An offering was made as part of the rites to terminate the old phase and included a collection of [[Eccentric flint (archaeology)|eccentric flint]]s worked into the profiles of humans and gods, which were wrapped in blue-dyed textiles.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 204\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=204}}.</ref>\n\n'''Structure 10L-18''' is on the southeastern side of the Acropolis and has been damaged by the erosion caused by the Cop\u00e1n River, having lost its eastern side.

The superstructure of the building has an interior doorway with an elaborate sculpted frame and decorated with masks of the mountain god ''Witz''. The outer doorway is framed by the giant mask of a deity, and has stylistic similarities with the [[Chenes]] regional style of distant [[Yucat\u00e1n (state)|Yucat\u00e1n]].<ref>{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=340}}; {{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=204}}.</ref> The temple was built to celebrate the completion of the king's first K'atun in power, in AD&nbsp;715, and has a hieroglyphic step with a first-person phrase \"I completed my K'atun\".

The structure was built by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil and K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil, the 13th and 15th&nbsp;rulers in the dynastic succession. The {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} wide Hieroglyphic Stairway ascends the building on the west side from the courtyard below.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp. 334, 340\"/> The earliest version of the temple, nicknamed Yax, was built during the reign of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', the dynastic founder, and has architectural features (such as inset corners) that are characteristic of Tikal and the central Pet\u00e9n region.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 193\"/> The next phase of the building was built by Yax K'uk' Mo's son K'inich Popol Hol and is nicknamed Motmot. This phase of the structure was more elaborate and was decorated with stucco. Set under the building was the Motmot capstone, covering a tomb with the unusual Teotihuacan-style burial of a woman, accompanied by a wide variety of offerings that included animal bones, [[mercury (element)|mercury]], jade and [[quartz]], along with three severed human heads, all of which were male.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 194\"/> Ku Ix built a new phase of the building over Motmot, nicknamed Papagayo.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 196\"/>\n\nSmoke Imix demolished the Papagayo phase and ritually interred the broken remains of its sculpted monuments, accompanied by stone macaw heads from an early version of the ballcourt. He then built a pyramid over the earlier phases, nicknamed Mascar\u00f3n by archaeologists. It in turn was developed into the Chorcha pyramid with the addition of a long superstructure with seven doorways at the front and back. Before a new building was built over the top, the upper sanctuary was demolished and a tomb was inserted into the floor and covered with 11 large stone slabs. The tomb contained the remains of an adult male and a sacrificed child. The adult's badly decayed skeleton was wrapped in a mat and accompanied by offerings of fine [[jade]], including ear ornaments and a necklace of sculpted figurines. The burial was accompanied by offerings of 44 ceramic vessels, [[jaguar]] pelts, [[spondylus]] shells, 10 paintpots and one or more hieroglyphic books, now decayed. There were also 12 ceramic incense burners with lids modeled into human figurines, thought to represent Smoke Imix and his 11 dynastic predecessors. The Chorcha building was dedicated to the long-lived 7th-century king Smoke Imix and it is therefore likely that the remains interred in the building are his.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 202\"/> Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil had sealed the Chorcha phase under a new version of the temple, nicknamed Esmeralda, by AD&nbsp;710. The new phase bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, which contains a lengthy dynastic history.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 204\"/> K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil built over the Esmeralda phase in the mid-8th&nbsp;century. He removed the Hieroglyphic Stairway from the earlier building and reinstalled it into his own version, while doubling the length of its text and adding five life-size statues of rulers dressed in the garb of Teotihuacano warriors, each seated on a step of the stairway. At the base of the stairway, he also raised Stela&nbsp;M, with his own image. The summit shrine of the temple bore a hieroglyphic text composed of full-figure hieroglyphs, each placed beside a similar glyph in faux-Mexican style, giving the appearance of a bilingual text.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, pp. 207\u2013208\"/>\n\n[[File:Cop\u00e1n Ballcourt.jpg|thumb|right|The final version of the ballcourt was dedicated by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in AD&nbsp;738.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 205\"/>]]\nThe '''Hieroglyphic Stairway''' climbs the west side of Structure 10L-26. It is {{convert|10|m|ft|sp=us}} wide and has a total of 62&nbsp;steps. Stela&nbsp;M and its associated altar are at its base and a large sculpted figure is located in the centre of every 12th&nbsp;step. These figures are believed to represent the most important rulers in the dynastic history of the site. The stairway takes its name from the 2200&nbsp;glyphs that together form the longest known Maya hieroglyphic text. The text is still being reconstructed, having been scrambled by the collapse of the glyphic blocks when the fa\u00e7ade of the temple collapsed.<ref>{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=340}}; {{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=208}}.</ref> The staircase measures {{convert|21|m|ft|sp=us}} long and was first built by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in AD&nbsp;710, being reinstalled and expanded in the following phase of the temple by K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil in AD&nbsp;755.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 208\"/>\n\nThe '''Ballcourt''' is immediately north of the Court of the Hieroglyphic Stairway and is to the south of the Monument Plaza.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp. 334, 340\"/> It was remodeled by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, who then demolished it and built a third version, which was one of the largest from the Classic period. It was dedicated to the great macaw deity and the buildings flanking the playing area carried 16 mosaic sculptures of the birds.

The Sepulturas Group consists of a number of restored structures, mostly elite residences that feature stone benches, some of which have carved decorations, and a number of tombs.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 340\"/>\n\nThe group has a very long occupational history, with one house having been dated as far back as the Early Preclassic. By the Middle Preclassic, large platforms were being built from [[Cobblestone architecture|cobbles]] and several rich burials were made. By AD&nbsp;800, the complex consisted of about 50 buildings arranged around 7 major courtyards.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 211\"/> At this time, the most important building was the ''House of the Bakabs'', the palace of a powerful nobleman from the time of Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat. The building has a high-quality sculpted exterior and a carved hieroglyphic bench inside. A portion of the group was a subdistrict occupied by non-Maya inhabitants from Central Honduras who were involved in the trade network that brought in goods from that region.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 211\"/>\n\n===Other groups===\nThe '''North Group''' is a Late Classic compound.

Its face was finely sculpted with portraits of the first two kings of the Cop\u00e1n dynasty, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and K'inich Popol Hol, facing towards each other with a double column of hieroglyphs between them, all contained within a quatrefoil frame. The frame and the hieroglyphic names of mythological locations underneath the feet of the two kings place them in a supernatural realm. The capstone bears two calendrical dates, in AD&nbsp;435 and AD&nbsp;441. The second of these is probably the date that the capstone was dedicated.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 194\"/>\n\nThe '''Xukpi Stone''' is a dedicatory monument from one of the earlier phases of the 10L-16 temple constructed to honor K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo'.

The monument has not been completely deciphered and its style and phrasing are unusual.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 196\"/> Originally it was used as a sculpted bench or step and the date on the monument is associated with the dedication of a funerary temple or a tomb, probably the tomb of K'inich' Yax K'uk' Mo', which was discovered underneath the same structure.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 344\"/>\n\n'''Stela 2''' was erected in the Great Plaza by Smoke Imix in AD&nbsp;652.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 201\"/>\n\n'''Stela 3''' is another stela erected  by Smoke Imix in the Great Plaza in AD&nbsp;652.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 201\"/>\n\n'''Stela 4''' was erected by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in the early 8th&nbsp;century AD.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 203\"/>\n\n'''Stela 7''' dates to the reign of K'ak' Chan Yopaat, and was erected to celebrate the [[K'atun]]-ending ceremony of AD&nbsp;613.

It was the capital city of a major [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic period]] kingdom from the 5th to 9th&nbsp;centuries AD. The city was in the extreme southeast of the [[Mesoamerica]]n cultural region, on the frontier with the [[Isthmo-Colombian]] cultural region, and was almost surrounded by non-[[Maya peoples]].<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 339\">{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=339}}.</ref>\n\nCop\u00e1n was occupied for more than two thousand years, from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Early Preclassic]] period to the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Postclassic]]. The city developed a distinctive sculptural style within the tradition of the lowland Maya, perhaps to emphasize the Maya ethnicity of the city's rulers.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 339\"/>\n\nThe city has a historical record that spans the greater part of the Classic period and has been reconstructed in detail by archaeologists and epigraphers.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 339\"/> Cop\u00e1n was a powerful city ruling a vast kingdom within the [[southern Maya area]].{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=339, 476}} The city suffered a major political disaster in AD&nbsp;738 when [[Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]], one of the greatest kings in Cop\u00e1n's dynastic history, was captured and executed by his former vassal, the king of [[Quirigu\u00e1]].<ref>{{harvnb|Martin|Grube2000|pp=203\u2013205}}; {{harvnb|Looper|2003|p=76}}; {{harvnb|Miller|1999|pp=134\u2013135}}.</ref> This unexpected defeat resulted in a 17-year hiatus at the city, during which time Cop\u00e1n may have been subject to Quirigu\u00e1 in a reversal of fortunes.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, pp. 206\u2013207\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube2000|pp=206\u2013207}}.</ref>\n\nA significant portion of the eastern side of the acropolis was eroded away by the [[Cop\u00e1n River]]; the river has since been diverted to protect the site from further damage.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 339\"/>\n\n{{anchor|Etymology|Name}}\n\n==Names==\nIt is thought likely that the ancient name of Cop\u00e1n was '''Oxwitik''' ({{IPA-myn|o\u0283witik|pron}}), meaning the \"Three Witiks\", although the meaning of the word ''witik'' itself remains obscure.{{sfn|Stuart|1996}}{{sfn|Stuart|Houston|1994|pp=23, 25}}\n\n==Location==\n[[File:Larger Southern Maya area v3.svg|thumb|left|250px|Location of Cop\u00e1n]]\nCop\u00e1n is in western Honduras close to the border with Guatemala. It lies within the [[Municipalities of Honduras|municipality]] of [[Cop\u00e1n Ruinas]] in the [[Departments of Honduras|department]] of [[Cop\u00e1n Department|Cop\u00e1n]]. It is in a fertile valley among foothills at {{convert|700|m|ft|sp=us}} [[above mean sea level]].<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 339\"/> The ruins of the site core of the city are {{convert|1.6|km|mi|0|sp=us}} from the modern village of [[Cop\u00e1n Ruinas]], which is built on the site of a major complex dating to the Classic period.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 198\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=198}}.</ref>\n\nIn the Preclassic period the floor of the Cop\u00e1n Valley was undulating, swampy and prone to seasonal flooding. In the Early Classic, the inhabitants flattened the valley floor and undertook construction projects to protect the city's architecture from the effects of flooding.{{sfn|Viel|Hall|2002|p=877}}\n\nCop\u00e1n had a major influence on regional centres across western and central Honduras, stimulating the introduction of Mesoamerican characteristics to local elites.{{sfn|Sheets|2000|p=434}}\n\n==Population==\n[[File:Century Mag Stela I and altar.png|thumb|right|Artistic conception of mayas at the Stela I and altar. Painting of 1898 by [[Henry Sandham]].]]\nAt the peak of its power in the Late Classic, the kingdom of Cop\u00e1n had a population of at least 20,000 and covered an area of over {{convert|250|km2|sqmi|-1|sp=us}}.{{sfn|Fasquelle|Fash|2005|p=4}} The greater Cop\u00e1n area consisting of the populated areas of the valley covered about a quarter of the size of the city of Tikal. It is estimated that the peak population in central Cop\u00e1n was between 6000 and 9000 in an area of {{convert|0.6|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}, with a further 9,000 to 12,000 inhabitants occupying the periphery\u2014an area of {{convert|23.4|km2|sqmi|sp=us}}. Additionally, there was an estimated rural population of 3,000 to 4,000 in a {{convert|476|km2|sqmi|adj=on|sp=us}} area of the Cop\u00e1n Valley, giving an estimated total population of 18,000 to 25,000 people in the valley during the Late Classic period.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=688}}\n\n==History==\nLittle is known of the rulers of Cop\u00e1n before the founding of a new dynasty with its origins at [[Tikal]] in the early 5th&nbsp;century AD, although the city's origins can be traced back to the Preclassic period.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 333; Martin & Grube 2000, p. 193\">{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=333}}; {{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=193}}.</ref> After this, Cop\u00e1n became one of the more powerful Maya city states and was a regional power in the southern Maya region.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 339\"/>  However, it suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of its former vassal state [[Quirigua]] in 738, when the long-ruling king [[Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]] was captured and beheaded by Quirigua's ruler [[K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat]] (Cauac Sky).{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=482}} Although this was a major setback, Cop\u00e1n's rulers began to build monumental structures again within a few decades.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, pp. 206\u2013207\"/>\n\nThe area of Cop\u00e1n continued to be occupied after the last major ceremonial structures and royal monuments were erected, but the population declined in the 8th and 9th&nbsp;centuries from perhaps over 20,000 in the city to less than 5,000.  This decrease in population took over four centuries to actually show signs of collapse, showing the stability of this site even after the fall of the ruling dynasties and royal families.{{sfn|Snow|2010|p=267}} The ceremonial center was long abandoned and the surrounding valley home to only a few farming hamlets at the time of the arrival of the [[Spain|Spanish]] in the 16th&nbsp;century.\n\n===Rulers===\n{{Main|List of rulers of Cop\u00e1n}}\nReferences to the predynastic rulers of Cop\u00e1n are found in later texts, but none of these texts predate the refounding of Cop\u00e1n in AD&nbsp;426.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 333\">{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=333}}.</ref>\n[[File:Copan St H.jpg|thumb|right|Stela H at Cop\u00e1n, commissioned by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 203\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=203}}.</ref>]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n!Name (or nickname) !!Ruled !!Dynastic<br />succession no. !!Alternative names\n|-\n|[[K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo']]\n|426 \u2013 c. 437\n|1\n|Great-Sun First Quetzal Macaw\n|-\n|[[K'inich Popol Hol]]\n|c. 437\n|2\n|Great-Sun\n|-\n|name unknown\n|c. 455\n|3\n|[[Ruler 3 (Cop\u00e1n)|Ruler 3]]\n|-\n|[[Ku Ix]]\n|c. 465\n|4\n|K'altuun Hix, Tuun K'ab' Hix\n|-\n|name unknown\n|c. 476\n|5\n|[[Ruler 5 (Cop\u00e1n)|Ruler 5]]\n|-\n|[[Muyal Jol]]\n|c. 485\n|6\n|Ruler 6\n|-\n|[[B'alam Nehn]]\n|504\u2013544\n|7\n|Jaguar Mirror; Waterlily-Jaguar\n|-\n|[[Wil Ohl K'inich]]{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=336}}\n|532\u2013551\n|8\n|Ruler 8; Head on Earth\n|-\n|[[Sak-Lu]]\n|551\u2013553\n|9\n|Ruler 9\n|-\n|[[Tzi-B'alam]]\n|553\u2013578\n|10\n|Moon Jaguar\n|-\n|[[K'ak' Chan Yopaat]]{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=337}}\n|578\u2013628\n|11\n|B'utz' Chan; Smoke Serpent\n|-\n|[[Chan Imix K'awiil]]\n|628\u2013695\n|12\n|Smoke Jaguar; Smoke Imix\n|-\n|[[Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil]]\n|695\u2013738\n|13\n|18 Rabbit\n|-\n|[[Ajaw K'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil]]\n|738\u2013749\n|14\n|Smoke Monkey\n|-\n|[[Ajaw K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil]]\n|749\u2013763\n|15\n|Smoke Shell; Smoke Squirrel\n|-\n|[[Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat]]\n|763 \u2013 after 810\n|16\n|Yax Pac\n|-\n|[[Ukit Took]]\n|822\n|17?\n|&ndash;\n|}\n\n===Predynastic history===\nThe fertile Cop\u00e1n River valley was long a site of agriculture before the first known stone architecture was built in the region about the 9th&nbsp;century BC.

This same person is mentioned on the carved skull of a [[peccary]] recovered from Tomb&nbsp;1, where he is said to perform an action with a stela in AD&nbsp;376.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 193\"/>\n\n===K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and K'inich Popol Hol===\n[[File:Yax Kuk Mo.jpg|thumb|left|Ceramic lid shaped to represent K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', recovered from the tomb of the 7th-century king Smoke Imix, under Temple&nbsp;26.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 202\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=202}}.</ref>]]\nThe city was refounded by [[K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo']], establishing it as the capital of a new Maya kingdom.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 339\"/> This coup was apparently organized and launched from Tikal. Texts record the arrival of a warrior named K'uk' Mo' Ajaw who was installed upon the throne of the city in AD&nbsp;426 and given a new royal name, K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and the ''ochk'in kaloomte'' \"Lord of the West\" title used a generation earlier by [[Siyaj K'ak']], a general from the great metropolis of [[Teotihuacan]] who had decisively intervened in the politics of the central Pet\u00e9n.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=322, 333\u2013338}} K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' was probably from Tikal and was likely to have been sponsored by Siyaj Chan K'awill&nbsp;II, the 16th&nbsp;ruler in the dynastic succession of Tikal. K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' may have legitimized his claim to rulership by marrying into the old Cop\u00e1n royal family, evidenced from the remains of his presumed widow.

Both names are likely to refer to the same individual originally from Tikal. Although none of the hieroglyphic texts that mention the founding of the new Cop\u00e1n dynasty describe how K'uk' Mo' arrived at the city, indirect evidence suggests that he conquered the city by military means. On Altar&nbsp;Q he is depicted as a Teotihuacano warrior with goggle eyes and a war serpent shield.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=338, 341\u2013342}} When he arrived at Cop\u00e1n he initiated the construction of various structures, including one temple in the [[talud-tablero]] style typical of Teotihuacan and another with inset corners and apron moldings that are characteristic of Tikal. These strong links with both the Maya and Central Mexican cultures suggest that he was at least a Mexicanized Maya or possibly even from Teotihuacan.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 193\"/> The dynasty founded by king K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' ruled the city for four centuries and included sixteen kings plus a probable pretender who would have been seventeenth in line.

In 1995 a tomb underneath the talud-tablero Hunal temple was discovered by a team of archaeologists led by [[Robert Sharer]] and David Sedat. The tomb contained the skeleton of an elderly man with rich offerings and evidence of battle wounds. The remains have been identified as those of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' due to their location underneath a sequence of seven buildings erected in his honor.

He was crowned as king in AD&nbsp;578, 24&nbsp;days after the death of Moon Jaguar. At the time of his rule, Cop\u00e1n was undergoing an unprecedented rise in population, with residential land use spreading to all available land in the entire Cop\u00e1n Valley. The two surviving stelae of K'ak' Chan Yopaat contain long, hard-to-decipher hieroglyphic texts and are the oldest monuments at the site to survive without being either broken or buried. He reigned for 49&nbsp;years until his death on 5&nbsp;February 628. His name is recorded on four stelae erected by his successors, one of which describes a rite performed with relics from his tomb in AD&nbsp;730, almost a hundred years after his death.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=200\u2013201}}\n\nSmoke Imix was crowned 16 days after the death of K'ak' Chan Yopaat. He is thought to have been the longest reigning king of Cop\u00e1n, ruling from 628 to 695. He is believed to have been born in AD&nbsp;612 and to have become king at the age of 15. Archaeologists have recovered little evidence of activity for the first 26&nbsp;years of his reign, but in AD&nbsp;652 there was a sudden explosion of monument production, with two stelae being erected in the Great Plaza and a further four in important locations across the Cop\u00e1n Valley. These monuments all celebrated a [[k'atun]]-ending. He also erected a stela at the [[Santa Rita, Cop\u00e1n|Santa Rita]] site {{convert|12|km|mi|sp=us}} away and is mentioned on Altar&nbsp;L at Quirigu\u00e1 in relation to the same event in 652. It is thought that he was trying to stamp his authority throughout the whole valley after the end of some earlier restriction to his freedom to rule as he wished.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 201\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=201}}.</ref>\n\nAfter this sudden spate of activity, Smoke Imix continued to rule until almost the end of the 7th&nbsp;century; he dedicated another nine known monuments and made important changes to the architecture of Cop\u00e1n, including the construction of Structure&nbsp;2, which closes the northern side of the Great Plaza, and a new version of Temple&nbsp;26, nicknamed Chorcha. Smoke Imix ruled Cop\u00e1n for 67&nbsp;years and died on 15&nbsp;June 695 at the age of 79, an age that was so distinguished that it is used to identify him in place of his name on Altar&nbsp;Q.

He oversaw both the apogee of Cop\u00e1n's achievements and also one of the city's most catastrophic political disasters. During his reign, the sculptural style of the city evolved into the full in-the-round sculpture characteristic of Cop\u00e1n. In AD&nbsp;718, Cop\u00e1n attacked and defeated the unidentified site of Xkuy, recording its burning on an unusual stone cylinder. In AD&nbsp;724 Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil installed [[K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat]] as a [[vassal]] on the throne of [[Quirigu\u00e1]]. Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was confident enough in his power to rank his city among the four most powerful states in the Maya region, together with Tikal, [[Calakmul]] and [[Palenque]], as recorded on Stela&nbsp;A. In contrast to his predecessor, Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil concentrated his monuments in the site core of the Cop\u00e1n; his first was Stela&nbsp;J, dated to AD&nbsp;702 and erected at the eastern entrance to the city.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 203\"/>\n\nHe continued to erect a further seven high-quality stelae until AD&nbsp;736, monuments that are considered masterpieces of Classic Maya sculpture with such mastery of detail that they represent the highest pinnacle of Maya artistic achievement.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=203\u2013204}} The stelae depict king Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil ritually posed and bearing the attributes of a variety of deities, including B'olon K'awiil, K'uy Nik Ajaw and Mo' Witz Ajaw.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 203\"/> The king also carried out major construction works, including a new version of Temple&nbsp;26 that now bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, plus two temples that have now been lost to the erosion of the Cop\u00e1n River. He also encased the Rosalila phase of Temple&nbsp;16 within a new phase of construction.

Cop\u00e1n was firmly allied with Tikal and Calakmul used its alliance with Quirigu\u00e1 to undermine Tikal's key ally in the south.{{sfn|Looper|2003|p=79}}\n\nAlthough the exact details are unknown, in April&nbsp;738 K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat captured Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil and burned two of Cop\u00e1n's patron deities.

It has been suggested that Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil was attempting to attack another site to secure captives for [[Sacrifice in Maya culture|sacrifice]] in order to dedicate the new ballcourt when he was ambushed by K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his Quirigu\u00e1 warriors.{{sfn|Looper|2003|p=78}}\n\nIn the Late Classic, alliance with Calakmul was frequently associated with the promise of military support. The fact that Cop\u00e1n, a much more powerful city than Quirigu\u00e1, failed to retaliate against its former vassal implies that it feared the military intervention of Calakmul. Calakmul was far enough away from Quirigu\u00e1 that K'ak' Tiliw Chan Yopaat was not afraid of falling directly under its power as a full vassal state, even though it is likely that Calakmul sent warriors to help in the defeat of Cop\u00e1n. The alliance instead seems to have been one of mutual advantage: Calakmul managed to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal while Quirigu\u00e1 gained its independence.<ref>{{harvnb|Looper|1999|p=271}}; {{harvnb|Looper|2003|p=81}}.</ref> The disaster for Cop\u00e1n had long-lasting consequences; major construction ceased and no new monuments were raised for the next 17&nbsp;years.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|p=206}}\n\n===Later rulers===\nK'ak' Joplaj Chan K'awiil was installed as the 14th dynastic ruler of Cop\u00e1n on 7&nbsp;June 738, 39&nbsp;days after the execution of Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil. Little is known of his reign due to the lack of monuments raised after Quirigu\u00e1's surprise victory. Cop\u00e1n's defeat had wider implications due to the fracturing of the city's domain and the loss of the key [[Motagua River]] [[Trade in Maya civilization|trade route]] to Quirigu\u00e1. The fall in Cop\u00e1n's income and corresponding increase at Quirigu\u00e1 is evident from the massive commissioning of new monuments and architecture at the latter city, and Cop\u00e1n may even have been subject to its former vassal.

The early period of his rulership fell within Cop\u00e1n's hiatus, but later on he began a programme of renewal in an effort to recover from the city's earlier disaster. He built a new version of Temple&nbsp;26, with the Hieroglyphic Stairway being reinstalled on the new stairway and doubled in length. Five life-size statues of seated rulers were installed seated upon the stairway. K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil died in the early 760s and is likely to have been interred in Temple&nbsp;11, although the tomb has not yet been excavated.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, pp. 207\u2013208\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=207\u2013208}}.</ref>\n\nYax Pasaj Chan Yopaat was the next ruler, 16th in the dynasty founded by K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', although he appears not to have been a direct descendant of his predecessor.

The Monument Plaza contains the greatest concentration of sculpted monuments at the site.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=339\u2013340}}\n\nThe '''Acropolis''' was the royal complex at the heart of Cop\u00e1n. It consists of two plazas that have been named the West Court and the East Court. They are both enclosed by elevated structures.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 340\"/> Archaeologists have excavated extensive tunnels under the Acropolis, revealing how the royal complex at the heart of Cop\u00e1n developed over the centuries and uncovering several hieroglyphic texts that date back to the Early Classic and verify details of the early dynastic rulers of the city who were recorded on Altar&nbsp;Q hundreds of years later. The deepest of these tunnels have revealed that the first monumental structures underlying the Acropolis date archaeologically to the early 5th&nbsp;century AD, when K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' established the royal dynasty.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=342}} These early buildings were built of stone and [[adobe]] and were themselves built upon earlier earth and cobble structures dating to the predynastic period.{{sfn|Sharer|Traxler|2006|pp=342, 344}} The two styles of building overlap somewhat, with some of the earthen structures being expanded during the first hundred years or so of the dynastic history of the city.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 344\">{{harvnb|Sharer|Traxler|2006|p=344}}.</ref> The early dynastic masonry buildings of the Acropolis included several with the Early Classic apron-molding style of Tikal and one built in the ''[[talud-tablero]]'' style associated with Teotihuacan, although at the time the ''talud-tablero'' form was in use at both Tikal and [[Kaminaljuyu]] as well as in Central Mexico.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 344\"/>\n\n'''Structure 10L-4''' is a platform with four stairways situated by the Monument Plaza.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, p. 340\"/>\n\n[[File:Honduras-0153 (2213588425).jpg|thumb|left|upright|A stone head at the bottom of Structure 10L-11]]\n'''Structure 10L-11''' is on the west side of the Acropolis.

The king was buried in a vaulted crypt that was cut into the floor of the Hunal phase of the building, accompanied by rich offerings of [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]]. K'inich Popol Hol, son of the founder, demolished the palace of his father and built a platform on top of his tomb, named Yehnal by archaeologists. It was built in a distinctively Pet\u00e9n Maya style and bore large masks of K'inich Tajal Wayib', the sun god, which were painted red. This platform was encased within another much larger platform within a decade of its construction. This larger platform has been named Margarita and had stucco panels flanking its access stairway that bore entwined images of [[Resplendent quetzal|quetzals]] and macaws, which both form a part of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo's name. The Margarita phase contained a [[Margarita Tomb|tomb]] with the richly accompanied burial of an elderly woman nicknamed the \"Lady in Red\". It is likely that she was the widow of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' and the mother of K'inich Popol Hol. The upper chamber of the Margarita phase temple was converted to receive offerings and the unusual Xukpi stone, a dedicatory monument used in one of the earlier phases, was reused in this later phase.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|pp=193\u2013196}}\n\n[[File:CPN Rosalila 01.jpg|thumb|left|Life-size reconstruction of the Rosalila temple at the site museum of Cop\u00e1n.{{sfn|Martin|Grube|2000|p=199}}]]\nOne of the best preserved phases of Temple 16 is the Rosalila, built over the remains of five previous versions of the temple. Archaeologist Ricardo Agurcia discovered the almost intact shrine while tunneling underneath the final version of the temple. Rosalila is notable for its excellent state of preservation, including the entire building from the base platform up to the [[roof comb]], including its highly elaborate painted stucco decoration. Rosalila features K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' placed at the centre of a mythological tableau, combining the founder of the dynasty with the [[List of Maya gods and supernatural beings|sky deity]] [[Itzamna]] in avian form. The mythological imagery also includes [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] mountains, skeletons and crocodiles. Vents in the exterior were designed so smoke from incense being burned inside the shrine would interact with the stucco sculpture of the exterior. The temple had a hieroglyphic stone step with a dedicatory inscription. The stone step is less well preserved than the rest of the building, but a date in AD&nbsp;571 has been deciphered. Due to the deforestation of the Cop\u00e1n valley, the Rosalila building was the last structure at the site to use such elaborate stucco decoration \u2014 vast quantities of firewood could no longer be spared to reduce limestone to plaster. A life-size copy of the Rosalila building has been built at the Cop\u00e1n site museum.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, pp. 198\u2013199\"/>\n\nUaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil encased the Rosalila phase under a new version of the building in the early 8th&nbsp;century AD. An offering was made as part of the rites to terminate the old phase and included a collection of [[Eccentric flint (archaeology)|eccentric flint]]s worked into the profiles of humans and gods, which were wrapped in blue-dyed textiles.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 204\">{{harvnb|Martin|Grube|2000|p=204}}.</ref>\n\n'''Structure 10L-18''' is on the southeastern side of the Acropolis and has been damaged by the erosion caused by the Cop\u00e1n River, having lost its eastern side.

The structure was built by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil and K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil, the 13th and 15th&nbsp;rulers in the dynastic succession. The {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on|sp=us}} wide Hieroglyphic Stairway ascends the building on the west side from the courtyard below.<ref name=\"Sharer & Traxler 2006, pp. 334, 340\"/> The earliest version of the temple, nicknamed Yax, was built during the reign of K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo', the dynastic founder, and has architectural features (such as inset corners) that are characteristic of Tikal and the central Pet\u00e9n region.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 193\"/> The next phase of the building was built by Yax K'uk' Mo's son K'inich Popol Hol and is nicknamed Motmot. This phase of the structure was more elaborate and was decorated with stucco. Set under the building was the Motmot capstone, covering a tomb with the unusual Teotihuacan-style burial of a woman, accompanied by a wide variety of offerings that included animal bones, [[mercury (element)|mercury]], jade and [[quartz]], along with three severed human heads, all of which were male.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 194\"/> Ku Ix built a new phase of the building over Motmot, nicknamed Papagayo.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 196\"/>\n\nSmoke Imix demolished the Papagayo phase and ritually interred the broken remains of its sculpted monuments, accompanied by stone macaw heads from an early version of the ballcourt. He then built a pyramid over the earlier phases, nicknamed Mascar\u00f3n by archaeologists. It in turn was developed into the Chorcha pyramid with the addition of a long superstructure with seven doorways at the front and back. Before a new building was built over the top, the upper sanctuary was demolished and a tomb was inserted into the floor and covered with 11 large stone slabs. The tomb contained the remains of an adult male and a sacrificed child. The adult's badly decayed skeleton was wrapped in a mat and accompanied by offerings of fine [[jade]], including ear ornaments and a necklace of sculpted figurines. The burial was accompanied by offerings of 44 ceramic vessels, [[jaguar]] pelts, [[spondylus]] shells, 10 paintpots and one or more hieroglyphic books, now decayed. There were also 12 ceramic incense burners with lids modeled into human figurines, thought to represent Smoke Imix and his 11 dynastic predecessors. The Chorcha building was dedicated to the long-lived 7th-century king Smoke Imix and it is therefore likely that the remains interred in the building are his.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 202\"/> Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil had sealed the Chorcha phase under a new version of the temple, nicknamed Esmeralda, by AD&nbsp;710. The new phase bore the first version of the Hieroglyphic Stairway, which contains a lengthy dynastic history.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 204\"/> K'ak' Yipyaj Chan K'awiil built over the Esmeralda phase in the mid-8th&nbsp;century. He removed the Hieroglyphic Stairway from the earlier building and reinstalled it into his own version, while doubling the length of its text and adding five life-size statues of rulers dressed in the garb of Teotihuacano warriors, each seated on a step of the stairway. At the base of the stairway, he also raised Stela&nbsp;M, with his own image. The summit shrine of the temple bore a hieroglyphic text composed of full-figure hieroglyphs, each placed beside a similar glyph in faux-Mexican style, giving the appearance of a bilingual text.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, pp. 207\u2013208\"/>\n\n[[File:Cop\u00e1n Ballcourt.jpg|thumb|right|The final version of the ballcourt was dedicated by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil in AD&nbsp;738.<ref name=\"Martin & Grube 2000, p. 205\"/>]]\nThe '''Hieroglyphic Stairway''' climbs the west side of Structure 10L-26.

Japan's 1993\u201394 recession was U-shaped and its 8-out-of-9 quarters of contraction in 1997\u201399 can be described as L-shaped. [[Korea]], [[Hong Kong]] and South-east Asia experienced U-shaped recessions in 1997\u201398, although [[Thailand]]\u2019s eight consecutive quarters of decline should be termed L-shaped.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Key_Indicators/2001/default.asp |title=Key Indicators 2001: Growth and Change in Asia and the Pacific |publisher=ADB.org |accessdate=31 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100317155544/http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Key_Indicators/2001/default.asp |archivedate=17 March 2010 }}</ref>\n\n===Psychological aspects===\nRecessions have psychological and confidence aspects.

This is when large numbers of consumers or corporations pay down debt (i.e., save) rather than spend or invest, which slows the economy. The term [[balance sheet]] derives from an accounting identity that holds that assets must always equal the sum of liabilities plus equity. If asset prices fall below the value of the debt incurred to purchase them, then the equity must be negative, meaning the consumer or corporation is insolvent. Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2014 that \"the best working hypothesis seems to be that the [[subprime mortgage crisis|financial crisis]] was only one manifestation of a broader problem of excessive debt\u2014that it was a so-called \"balance sheet recession\". In Krugman's view, such crises require debt reduction strategies combined with higher government spending to offset declines from the private sector as it pays down its debt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jul/10/geithner-does-he-pass-test/|title=Does He Pass the Test?|first=Paul|last=Krugman|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nFor example, economist Richard Koo wrote that Japan's \"Great Recession\" that began in 1990 was a \"balance sheet recession\". It was triggered by a collapse in land and stock prices, which caused Japanese firms to have [[negative equity]], meaning their assets were worth less than their liabilities. Despite zero [[interest rate]]s and expansion of the [[money supply]] to encourage borrowing, Japanese corporations in aggregate opted to pay down their debts from their own business earnings rather than borrow to invest as firms typically do. Corporate investment, a key demand component of GDP, fell enormously (22% of GDP) between 1990 and its peak decline in 2003. Japanese firms overall became net savers after 1998, as opposed to borrowers. Koo argues that it was massive fiscal stimulus (borrowing and spending by the government) that offset this decline and enabled Japan to maintain its level of GDP. In his view, this avoided a U.S. type [[Great Depression]], in which U.S. GDP fell by 46%. He argued that monetary policy was ineffective because there was limited demand for funds while firms paid down their liabilities.  In a balance sheet recession, GDP declines by the amount of debt repayment and un-borrowed individual savings, leaving government stimulus spending as the primary remedy.<ref name=\"Koo 2009\"/><ref name=\"Koo 2011\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Gregory White|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-koo-recession-2010-4#-1 |title=Presentation by Richard Koo \u2013 The Age of Balance Sheet Recessions |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=14 April 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue58/Koo58.pdf|title=Richard Koo \u2013 The World In Balance Sheet Recession \u2013 Real World Economics Review \u2013 December 2011|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nKrugman discussed the balance sheet recession concept during 2010, agreeing with Koo's situation assessment and view that sustained [[deficit spending]] when faced with a balance sheet recession would be appropriate. However, Krugman argued that monetary policy could also affect savings behavior, as inflation or credible promises of future inflation (generating negative real interest rates) would encourage less savings. In other words, people would tend to spend more rather than save if they believe inflation is on the horizon. In more technical terms, Krugman argues that the private sector savings curve is elastic even during a balance sheet recession (responsive to changes in real interest rates) disagreeing with Koo's view that it is inelastic (non-responsive to changes in real interest rates).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/notes-on-koo-wonkish/|title=Notes On Koo (Wonkish)|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/debt-deleveraging-and-liquidity-trap-new-model|title=Debt, deleveraging, and the liquidity trap|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=18 November 2010|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nA July 2012 survey of balance sheet recession research reported that consumer demand and employment are affected by [[Household debt|household leverage]] levels. Both durable and non-durable goods consumption declined as households moved from low to high leverage with the decline in property values experienced during the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. Further, reduced consumption due to higher household leverage can account for a significant decline in employment levels. Policies that help reduce mortgage debt or household leverage could therefore have stimulative effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/06/grim-natural-experiments/|title=Grim Natural Experiments|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nextnewdeal.net/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016030017/http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/new-report-literature-summary-new-balance-sheet-recession-research|url-status=dead|title=New Report: A Literature Summary on New Balance-Sheet Recession Research|archivedate=October 16, 2015|website=Next New Deal}}</ref>\n\n===Liquidity trap===\nA [[liquidity trap]] is a [[Keynesian]] theory that a situation can develop in which interest rates reach near zero ([[zero interest-rate policy]]) yet do not effectively stimulate the economy. In theory, near-zero interest rates should encourage firms and consumers to borrow and spend. However, if too many individuals or corporations focus on saving or paying down debt rather than spending, lower interest rates have less effect on investment and consumption behavior; the lower interest rates are like \"[[pushing on a string]]\". Economist [[Paul Krugman]] described the [[Subprime mortgage crisis|U.S. 2009 recession]] and [[Lost decade (Japan)|Japan's lost decade]] as liquidity traps. One remedy to a liquidity trap is expanding the money supply via [[quantitative easing]] or other techniques in which money is effectively printed to purchase assets, thereby creating [[inflationary]] expectations that cause savers to begin spending again. Government stimulus spending and [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] policies to stimulate exports and reduce imports are other techniques to stimulate demand.<ref name=\"Krugman 2009\">{{cite book\n| last = Krugman\n| first = Paul\n| year = 2009\n| title = The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008\n| publisher = W.W.

Too many consumers attempting to save (or pay down debt) simultaneously is called the [[paradox of thrift]] and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist [[Hyman Minsky]] also described a \"paradox of deleveraging\" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\">{{cite web|url=https://www.frbsf.org/our-district/press/presidents-speeches/yellen-speeches/2009/april/yellen-minsky-meltdown-central-bankers/|title=A Minsky Meltdown: Lessons for Central Bankers|website=Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco}}</ref>\n\nDuring April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair [[Janet Yellen]] discussed these paradoxes: \"Once this [[subprime mortgage crisis|massive credit crunch]] hit, it didn\u2019t take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse [[feedback]] loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms\u2014and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state\u2014nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.\"<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\" />\n\n==Predictors==\nThe U.S. Conference Board's Present Situation Index year-over-year change turns negative by more than 15 points before a recession.<ref>[http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2013/09/consumer-confidence-a-useful-indicator-of-the-labor-market.html Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Consumer Confidence: A Useful Indicator of . . . the Labor Market?]\nJason Bram, Robert Rich, and Joshua Abel ...

Strategies favored for moving an economy out of a recession vary depending on which economic school the policymakers follow. [[Monetarism|Monetarists]] would favor the use of expansionary [[monetary policy]], while [[Keynesian]] economists may advocate increased [[government spending]] to spark economic growth. [[Supply-side]] economists may suggest tax cuts to promote business [[capital (economics)|capital]] investment.  When interest rates reach the boundary of an interest rate of zero percent ([[zero interest-rate policy]]) conventional monetary policy can no longer be used and government must use other measures to stimulate recovery.  Keynesians argue that [[fiscal policy]]\u2014tax cuts or increased government spending\u2014works when monetary policy fails.  Spending is more effective because of its larger [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] but tax cuts take effect faster.\n\nFor example, [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in December 2010 that significant, sustained government spending was necessary because [[household debt|indebted households]] were paying down debts and unable to carry the U.S. economy as they had previously: \"The root of our current troubles lies in the debt American families ran up during the Bush-era housing bubble...highly indebted Americans not only can\u2019t spend the way they used to, they\u2019re having to pay down the debts they ran up in the bubble years. This would be fine if someone else were taking up the slack. But what\u2019s actually happening is that some people are spending much less while nobody is spending more \u2014 and this translates into a depressed economy and high unemployment. What the government should be doing in this situation is spending more while the private sector is spending less, supporting employment while those debts are paid down. And this government spending needs to be sustained...\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/13/opinion/13krugman.html|title=Opinion \u2013 Block Those Economic Metaphors|first=Paul|last=Krugman|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Stock market==\nSome recessions have been anticipated by the stock market declines.

Many economists working within the neoclassical paradigm argue that there is a [[natural rate of unemployment]] which, when subtracted from the actual rate of unemployment, can be used to calculate the negative [[GDP]] gap during a recession. In other words, unemployment never reaches 0 percent, and thus is not a negative indicator of the health of an economy unless above the \"natural rate,\" in which case it corresponds directly to a loss in the gross domestic product, or [[GDP]].<ref>[http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/SAYLOR.ORG-ECON102-UNEMPLOYMENT-RATE.pdf  Unemployment Rate] p. 1.

Although the collapse was larger than the one in 1929, the global economy recovered quickly, but North America still suffered a decline in lumbering savings and loans, which led to a crisis. The recession wasn't limited to only America, but it also affected partnering nations, such as Australia. The unemployment level increased to 10.8%, employment declined by 3.4% and the GDP also decreased as much as 1.7%. Inflation, however, was successfully reduced.

This is when large numbers of consumers or corporations pay down debt (i.e., save) rather than spend or invest, which slows the economy. The term [[balance sheet]] derives from an accounting identity that holds that assets must always equal the sum of liabilities plus equity. If asset prices fall below the value of the debt incurred to purchase them, then the equity must be negative, meaning the consumer or corporation is insolvent. Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in 2014 that \"the best working hypothesis seems to be that the [[subprime mortgage crisis|financial crisis]] was only one manifestation of a broader problem of excessive debt\u2014that it was a so-called \"balance sheet recession\". In Krugman's view, such crises require debt reduction strategies combined with higher government spending to offset declines from the private sector as it pays down its debt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/jul/10/geithner-does-he-pass-test/|title=Does He Pass the Test?|first=Paul|last=Krugman|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nFor example, economist Richard Koo wrote that Japan's \"Great Recession\" that began in 1990 was a \"balance sheet recession\". It was triggered by a collapse in land and stock prices, which caused Japanese firms to have [[negative equity]], meaning their assets were worth less than their liabilities. Despite zero [[interest rate]]s and expansion of the [[money supply]] to encourage borrowing, Japanese corporations in aggregate opted to pay down their debts from their own business earnings rather than borrow to invest as firms typically do. Corporate investment, a key demand component of GDP, fell enormously (22% of GDP) between 1990 and its peak decline in 2003. Japanese firms overall became net savers after 1998, as opposed to borrowers. Koo argues that it was massive fiscal stimulus (borrowing and spending by the government) that offset this decline and enabled Japan to maintain its level of GDP. In his view, this avoided a U.S. type [[Great Depression]], in which U.S. GDP fell by 46%. He argued that monetary policy was ineffective because there was limited demand for funds while firms paid down their liabilities.  In a balance sheet recession, GDP declines by the amount of debt repayment and un-borrowed individual savings, leaving government stimulus spending as the primary remedy.<ref name=\"Koo 2009\"/><ref name=\"Koo 2011\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Gregory White|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-koo-recession-2010-4#-1 |title=Presentation by Richard Koo \u2013 The Age of Balance Sheet Recessions |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=14 April 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paecon.net/PAEReview/issue58/Koo58.pdf|title=Richard Koo \u2013 The World In Balance Sheet Recession \u2013 Real World Economics Review \u2013 December 2011|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nKrugman discussed the balance sheet recession concept during 2010, agreeing with Koo's situation assessment and view that sustained [[deficit spending]] when faced with a balance sheet recession would be appropriate. However, Krugman argued that monetary policy could also affect savings behavior, as inflation or credible promises of future inflation (generating negative real interest rates) would encourage less savings. In other words, people would tend to spend more rather than save if they believe inflation is on the horizon. In more technical terms, Krugman argues that the private sector savings curve is elastic even during a balance sheet recession (responsive to changes in real interest rates) disagreeing with Koo's view that it is inelastic (non-responsive to changes in real interest rates).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/17/notes-on-koo-wonkish/|title=Notes On Koo (Wonkish)|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://voxeu.org/article/debt-deleveraging-and-liquidity-trap-new-model|title=Debt, deleveraging, and the liquidity trap|first=Paul|last=Krugman|date=18 November 2010|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref>\n\nA July 2012 survey of balance sheet recession research reported that consumer demand and employment are affected by [[Household debt|household leverage]] levels. Both durable and non-durable goods consumption declined as households moved from low to high leverage with the decline in property values experienced during the [[subprime mortgage crisis]]. Further, reduced consumption due to higher household leverage can account for a significant decline in employment levels. Policies that help reduce mortgage debt or household leverage could therefore have stimulative effects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/06/grim-natural-experiments/|title=Grim Natural Experiments|accessdate=26 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nextnewdeal.net/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016030017/http://www.nextnewdeal.net/rortybomb/new-report-literature-summary-new-balance-sheet-recession-research|url-status=dead|title=New Report: A Literature Summary on New Balance-Sheet Recession Research|archivedate=October 16, 2015|website=Next New Deal}}</ref>\n\n===Liquidity trap===\nA [[liquidity trap]] is a [[Keynesian]] theory that a situation can develop in which interest rates reach near zero ([[zero interest-rate policy]]) yet do not effectively stimulate the economy. In theory, near-zero interest rates should encourage firms and consumers to borrow and spend. However, if too many individuals or corporations focus on saving or paying down debt rather than spending, lower interest rates have less effect on investment and consumption behavior; the lower interest rates are like \"[[pushing on a string]]\". Economist [[Paul Krugman]] described the [[Subprime mortgage crisis|U.S. 2009 recession]] and [[Lost decade (Japan)|Japan's lost decade]] as liquidity traps. One remedy to a liquidity trap is expanding the money supply via [[quantitative easing]] or other techniques in which money is effectively printed to purchase assets, thereby creating [[inflationary]] expectations that cause savers to begin spending again. Government stimulus spending and [[Mercantilism|mercantilist]] policies to stimulate exports and reduce imports are other techniques to stimulate demand.<ref name=\"Krugman 2009\">{{cite book\n| last = Krugman\n| first = Paul\n| year = 2009\n| title = The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008\n| publisher = W.W.

Too many consumers attempting to save (or pay down debt) simultaneously is called the [[paradox of thrift]] and can cause or deepen a recession. Economist [[Hyman Minsky]] also described a \"paradox of deleveraging\" as financial institutions that have too much leverage (debt relative to equity) cannot all de-leverage simultaneously without significant declines in the value of their assets.<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\">{{cite web|url=https://www.frbsf.org/our-district/press/presidents-speeches/yellen-speeches/2009/april/yellen-minsky-meltdown-central-bankers/|title=A Minsky Meltdown: Lessons for Central Bankers|website=Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco}}</ref>\n\nDuring April 2009, U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair [[Janet Yellen]] discussed these paradoxes: \"Once this [[subprime mortgage crisis|massive credit crunch]] hit, it didn\u2019t take long before we were in a recession. The recession, in turn, deepened the credit crunch as demand and employment fell, and credit losses of financial institutions surged. Indeed, we have been in the grips of precisely this adverse [[feedback]] loop for more than a year. A process of balance sheet deleveraging has spread to nearly every corner of the economy. Consumers are pulling back on purchases, especially on durable goods, to build their savings. Businesses are cancelling planned investments and laying off workers to preserve cash. And, financial institutions are shrinking assets to bolster capital and improve their chances of weathering the current storm. Once again, Minsky understood this dynamic. He spoke of the paradox of deleveraging, in which precautions that may be smart for individuals and firms\u2014and indeed essential to return the economy to a normal state\u2014nevertheless magnify the distress of the economy as a whole.\"<ref name=\"Yellen on Minsky\" />\n\n==Predictors==\nThe U.S. Conference Board's Present Situation Index year-over-year change turns negative by more than 15 points before a recession.<ref>[http://libertystreeteconomics.newyorkfed.org/2013/09/consumer-confidence-a-useful-indicator-of-the-labor-market.html Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Consumer Confidence: A Useful Indicator of . . . the Labor Market?]\nJason Bram, Robert Rich, and Joshua Abel ...

Strategies favored for moving an economy out of a recession vary depending on which economic school the policymakers follow. [[Monetarism|Monetarists]] would favor the use of expansionary [[monetary policy]], while [[Keynesian]] economists may advocate increased [[government spending]] to spark economic growth. [[Supply-side]] economists may suggest tax cuts to promote business [[capital (economics)|capital]] investment.  When interest rates reach the boundary of an interest rate of zero percent ([[zero interest-rate policy]]) conventional monetary policy can no longer be used and government must use other measures to stimulate recovery.  Keynesians argue that [[fiscal policy]]\u2014tax cuts or increased government spending\u2014works when monetary policy fails.  Spending is more effective because of its larger [[Multiplier (economics)|multiplier]] but tax cuts take effect faster.\n\nFor example, [[Paul Krugman]] wrote in December 2010 that significant, sustained government spending was necessary because [[household debt|indebted households]] were paying down debts and unable to carry the U.S. economy as they had previously: \"The root of our current troubles lies in the debt American families ran up during the Bush-era housing bubble...highly indebted Americans not only can\u2019t spend the way they used to, they\u2019re having to pay down the debts they ran up in the bubble years. This would be fine if someone else were taking up the slack. But what\u2019s actually happening is that some people are spending much less while nobody is spending more \u2014 and this translates into a depressed economy and high unemployment. What the government should be doing in this situation is spending more while the private sector is spending less, supporting employment while those debts are paid down.

The variation in [[Profit (accounting)|profitability]] between firms rises sharply. The fall in productivity could also be attributed to several macro-economic factors, such as the loss in productivity observed across UK due to [[Brexit]], which may create a mini-recession in the region. [[Pandemic|Global epidemics]], such as [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]], could be another example, since they disrupt the global supply chain or prevent movement of goods, services and people.\n\nRecessions have also provided opportunities for [[anti-competitive]] [[merger]]s, with a negative impact on the wider economy: the suspension of [[competition policy]] in the United States in the 1930s may have extended the Great Depression.<ref name=\"ESRC\" />\n\n===Social effects===\nThe [[living standards]] of people dependent on wages and [[salaries]] are not more affected by recessions than those who rely on [[fixed income]]s or [[welfare benefits]].

It fared better than other nations, that underwent [[depression (economics)|depressions]], but their poor economic states influenced Australia's as well, that depended on them for export, as well as [[foreign investments]]. The nation also benefited from bigger productivity in manufacturing, facilitated by trade protection, which also helped with feeling the effects less.\n\nDue to a credit squeeze, the economy had gone into a brief recession in 1961\nAustralia was facing a rising level of [[inflation]] in 1973, caused partially by the oil crisis happening in that same year, which brought inflation at a 13% increase. Economic recession hit by the middle of the year 1974, with no change in policy enacted by the government as a measure to counter the economic situation of the country. Consequently, the unemployment level rose and the trade deficit increased significantly.<ref>{{citation | title= Australian Economic Indicators | publisher = Australian Bureau of Statistics | date=27 February 1998 | url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/90a12181d877a6a6ca2568b5007b861c/d4a22ad91e0348bfca256fd3007baf93!OpenDocument }}</ref>\n\nAnother recession \u2013 the most recent one to date \u2013 came in the 1990s, at the beginning of the decade.

Although the collapse was larger than the one in 1929, the global economy recovered quickly, but North America still suffered a decline in lumbering savings and loans, which led to a crisis. The recession wasn't limited to only America, but it also affected partnering nations, such as Australia. The unemployment level increased to 10.8%, employment declined by 3.4% and the GDP also decreased as much as 1.7%. Inflation, however, was successfully reduced.
