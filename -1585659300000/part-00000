Conceived as a high-quality environmentally friendly operation and funded by [[Tyne & Wear Passenger Transport Executive|Nexus]], it was launched in 2005.

Despite being located a short distance from [[Newcastle city centre|Newcastle]] and [[Gateshead]], the area was poorly served by public transport.  \n\nIn June 2002, [[Newcastle City Council]] and [[Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead|Gateshead Council]], along with [[Tyne and Wear Passenger Transport Executive|Nexus]], invited tenders for operation of a proposed ''Tyne Quayside Link'', as well as the manufacture of eight alternatively-fuelled buses for a ''Quayside Transit System''. The proposed project, scheduled for launch in 2004, would cost \u00a35 million \u2013 with \u00a33 million coming from the local transport plan, \u00a31 million from regeneration funds for Gateshead, and \u00a31 million from the Quayside developers. As well as new buses, the project involved the construction of a bus lane, and improvements to some bus stops, making them fully accessible.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/busenthusiastguides/page1.phtml|title=Tyneside's QuayLink scheme|last=|first=|date=|website=CommuniGate|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724062347/http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/busenthusiastguides/page1.phtml|archive-date=2008-07-24|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newcastle.gov.uk/qt.nsf/a/QT_Home|title=What is Quaylink?|last=|first=|date=|website=Quayside Transit|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820121706/http://www.newcastle.gov.uk/qt.nsf/a/QT_Home|archive-date=20 August 2008|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nQuayLink brand was launched in July 2005, using a fleet of ten [[Environmental Performance Vehicles|Designline Olymbus]] turbine-electric hybrid vehicles \u2013 a project costing \u00a38 million.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/tyne/4801114.stm|title=Backing for electric bus service|date=2006-03-13|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-03-28|url-status=live|language=en-GB}}</ref> Prior to the launch, all ten vehicles were pictured, along with local dignitaries and partner representatives, at an opening ceremony held on the Quayside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/busenthusiastguides/page1.phtml|title=Tyneside's QuayLink scheme|last=|first=|date=|website=CommuniGate|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724062347/http://www.communigate.co.uk/ne/busenthusiastguides/page1.phtml|archive-date=24 July 2008|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref><br>\n\n==Service and operations==\n\n=== Stagecoach North East (2005\u20132010) ===\n[[File:Quaylink bus 61006 Designline Olymbus NX05 PXL in Newcastle 9 May 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Stagecoach North East]] [[Environmental Performance Vehicles|Designline]] Olymbus in the original QuayLink livery at [[Haymarket bus station]] in May 2009]]\n[[File:Stagecoach North East 32112 K112SRH Dennis Dart Plaxton Pointer 7 March 2009 Quaylink.JPG|thumb|[[Stagecoach North East]] [[Plaxton Pointer]] bodied [[Dennis Dart]] in March 2009]]\n==== Fleet and operations ====\n[[Stagecoach North East]] won the contract to operate the service, with a fleet of ten [[Environmental Performance Vehicles|Designline Olymbus]] turbine-electric hybrid vehicles, built in [[New Zealand]].

The anticipated cost of modifying the whole fleet was estimated to cost around \u00a3200,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/quaylink-bus-service-faces-200000-1478752|title=Quaylink bus service faces \u00a3200,000 repairs|last=|first=|date=2016-03-04|website=ChronicleLive|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075259/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/quaylink-bus-service-faces-200000-1478752|archive-date=4 March 2016|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\nFollowing contract changes in July 2010, the vehicles were withdrawn from service \u2013 aged just over five years old.

{"title_page": "History of Rugby, Warwickshire", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=February 2011}}\nThis is about the history of the town of [[Rugby, Warwickshire]], England.\n\n==Early history==\nIn the [[Iron Age]] the Rugby area was settled. Rugby's site on a plateau at about 400 feet above sea level, overlooking the [[River Avon, Warwickshire|River Avon]] made it an important strategic post overlooking the Avon, which was a natural barrier between the [[Dobunni]] and the [[Corieltauvi]] tribes. Iron Age remains, probably lookout posts or forts, have been located on either side of the Avon. \n\nIn [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times, two major [[Roman road]]s were built very close to the site of modern-day Rugby: the [[Fosse Way]] and [[Watling Street]]. Twelve miles north of Rugby is [[High Cross, Leicestershire|High Cross]] (Roman name [[Venonae]]), where the two roads cross. \n\nJust outside modern day Rugby, remains have been found of a Roman town called [[Tripontium]], on the original Watling Street which is now known as the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]. Historians believe that the settlement was a kind of ancient service station, providing [[stable|stabling]] and accommodation to passing Roman armies and travellers. \n\nRugby got its name in [[Anglo-Saxon England|Saxon]] times. It was first mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086 as a small farming settlement then called  ''Rocheberie''. One theory is that the name came from the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''Hr\u014dceburh'' = \"Rook fort\", where Rook may be the birds or may be a man's name.  There is another theory that it is derived from an old [[Celtic language|Celtic]] name ''Droche-brig'' meaning \"wild hilltop\". [[Viking]] influence in the area changed the ending to the [[Old Norse]] ''-b\u00fd''; in 1200 it was spelt ''Rokebi''. The name later evolved into \"Rokeby\", and by the 18th century had become \"Rugby\".\n\nIn the 12th century Rugby was mentioned as having a [[castle]]. However the 'castle' was probably little more than a defended [[manor house]]. In any event the 'castle' was short lived. It was probably constructed during the reign of [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] (1135\u20131154), and demolished in around 1157 on the orders of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]. According to local legend, the stones from the castle were used to construct the west tower of St Andrew's church, which bears strong resemblance to a castle.\n\n==Market town==\n\nIn 1255, [[lord of the manor]] Henry de Rokeby obtained a market charter for Rugby, which became a small rural [[market town]], which it remained until the 19th century. The layout of the streets in the town centre around the market place still follows the pattern set down in medieval times. Rugby's built-up area was only High Street and Sheep Street and North Street and the Market Place.\n\nOne of the most significant events in the town's history was the founding in 1567 of [[Rugby School]]: [[Lawrence Sheriff]], a locally born grocer to Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], left money in his will to establish a school in Rugby for local boys. The school needed to take some fee-paying pupils from outside the area, to help pay the bills, and gradually became a largely fee-paying school.\n\nFrom medieval times until the late 18th century, the population of Rugby stayed at around 500\u20131000. It began to grow in the 1770s when the [[Oxford Canal]] was constructed around the town and spurred some growth in local industries and in population.\n\n==Brushes with history==\n\nRugby and its surrounding area had several brushes with some of the most important events in [[History of England|English history]].\n\n[[File:Guy Fawkes House -Dunchurch-20May2005.jpg|thumb|\"Guy Fawkes House\" in [[Dunchurch]]]]\nThe Rugby area has associations with the [[Gunpowder Plot]] \u2013 On the eve of the plot on 5 November 1605, the plotters stayed at an inn in nearby [[Dunchurch]] to await news of the plot. If it had been successful then they planned to kidnap the princess [[Elizabeth of Bohemia]], who was staying at nearby [[Coombe Abbey]], and install her as Queen.\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]] in the 17th century, King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] is said to have passed through Rugby on his way to [[Nottingham]] with 120 [[Cavaliers|Cavalier]] troops during 1642. The attitudes of the townsfolk were said to be too close to the [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarian]] cause for the king's liking. One of the most important battles of the war, the [[Battle of Naseby]] was fought some 15 miles east of Rugby.\n\nIn April 1645 [[Oliver Cromwell]] stayed in Rugby along with two regiments of [[Roundhead]] troops. He is said to have stayed at the \"Shoulder of Mutton Inn\" (where the Marks and Spencers shop used to be)\n\n==19th-century development==\nRugby for centuries was merely High Street, Sheep Street, North Street, and the Market Place. It only grew into an important settlement during the 19th century.\n\n===Influence of Rugby School===\nRugby School, one of England's oldest and most prestigious [[public school (England)|public schools]], rose to national prominence in the 1820s through the teaching methods pioneered by its headmaster, Dr [[Thomas Arnold]], which contributed to a radical change in [[Public school (UK)|Public School]] education in England. Most of the present school buildings, near the centre of the town, date from this period. In 1823 [[William Webb Ellis]] is said to have invented [[Rugby Football]] when he picked up the ball and ran with it.\n\nThe growing popularity of the school in the early 19th century led to an increase in population of the town. Many immigrants came to Rugby, many of whom were Rugby School pupils' parents, who preferred their sons to be able to go to a normal home life each night instead of having to endure school conditions (poor food, crowding, bullies) 24 hours every day; in Rugby such immigrants were called \"sojourners\". This caused Rugby to expand along Bilton Road and Dunchurch Road.\n\nRugby School during this period was immortalised by [[Thomas Hughes]] in his semi-autobiographical novel [[Tom Brown's Schooldays]].\n\n===Coming of the railways===\n[[Image:WCML at Rugby.jpg|thumb|right|The railway at Rugby in 2004]]\n\nThe major factor in the growth of Rugby was the arrival of railways. In 1835 Rugby was a small rural town with a population of around 2,500. However In 1838, one of the first trunk lines to be built in England, the [[London and Birmingham Railway]], an early part of what later became the [[West Coast Main Line]], was built around the town. \n\nIn 1840, the [[Midland Counties Railway]], which linked the [[East Midlands]] with [[North East England]], formed a junction with the London and Birmingham, making Rugby the busiest and most important railway junction in Britain.\n\nSoon railways were being built into Rugby from several different directions. The main [[Trent Valley Line]] from [[Stafford]] was built into Rugby in 1847. A line to [[Market Harborough]] and [[Peterborough]] was opened in 1850, and a line to [[Leamington Spa]] was opened in 1851. The [[Northampton loop line]] to [[Northampton]] opened in 1881.\n\nFor nearly 30 years, nearly all rail traffic between London, the Midlands, the north of England, [[Scotland]], and north [[Wales]] passed through Rugby junction, giving the town huge national importance.\n[[File:Railways of Rugby 1950.png|thumb|The railways of Rugby at their height in 1950. The lines to Leicester, Peterborough, Leamington Spa and the Great Central Main Line have now been closed.]]\nBy the 1860s the junction had become extremely congested, so much so that it was not uncommon for trains to have to queue for hours to pass through. This caused much anger and frustration amongst travellers, for whom Rugby became a byword for delays. [[Charles Dickens]] lampooned it in his short story [[Mugby Junction]] (1866). To relieve this congestion a new line, later called the [[Midland Main Line]], was built, taking a more direct route to London, avoiding Rugby. Much traffic was diverted onto the new line; Rugby remained one of the most important railway junctions in the country, but was no longer an all-important hub.\n\nThe first [[Rugby railway station]] was opened in 1838 when the London & Birmingham opened, located to the west of the present station. When the Midland Counties line was opened in 1840, the original station was badly located to serve the new line, and so a second station was opened close to the present one. This station lasted for over 40 years but proved to be inadequate to cope with traffic. In 1885 the present station was opened. \n\nIn 1899 the [[Great Central Main Line|Great Central Railway]] was built into Rugby and the town gained a second station {{rws|Rugby Central}} which offered an alternative route to London and the north.\n\n===Growth of industry===\n\nWith the railways, many wagon works, and engineering facilities were opened, and Rugby's population reached 10,000 by the 1880s, many employed by the railways. Because of its transport links, a number of industries developed in Rugby. \n\nIn 1862 the Rugby Lias Lime and Cement Co. Ltd. was founded, although manufacture of [[Portland cement|cement]] at the site began in 1855. Using the local [[Blue Lias]] clay.\n\nRugby began to develop more industries from the 1880s onwards. In 1881 a [[corset]] factory opened, employing local women. From the 1890s onwards Rugby began to attract engineering industry, due largely to its good transport links. The [[Willans & Robinson]] works opened in Rugby in 1893 which made [[steam engines]]. And in 1899 the [[British Thomson-Houston]] works opened which made electrical equipment and later [[turbines]]. Engineering would dominate the town's economy for most of the following century.\n\n===Challenges of growth===\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century Rugby's infrastructure had not kept pace with the increase in population. Most notably, there was not an adequate supply of drinking water which was mostly sourced from wells and street pumps, nor was there adequate sewerage or sanitation. These problems caused Rugby's growth to stall. In 1849 Rugby became the first town in England to have a [[Local board of health]], beating [[Croydon]] by a matter of weeks. The board had powers to levy a rate to provide drinking water and sewage facilities as well as powers to clean and pave streets and provide street lighting. However several early schemes to provide adequate drinking water were unsuccessful. It was not until 1876 that a reliable supply was obtained from the River Avon. \n\nUntil the 1870s, the cattle market was still held in the town centre as it had been since the Middle Ages. However this became increasingly unpopular with local residents. In 1878 the cattle market was moved near the railway station and within the last few years has been transformed into a housing estate \n\nIn 1894 Rugby became an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] and gained its first elected council.\n\n==20th century==\n[[File:Rugby (Warwickshire, England) at about WWII.jpg|thumb|right|Rugby at about the [[Second World War]]]]\nThe engineering works in Rugby attracted many workers to the town, and in the early decades of the 20th century the population grew rapidly and Rugby's built-up area spread fast in all directions. In 1901 the population of Rugby was 16,950, by the 1930s it had reached 40,000. \n\nDue to its expansion Rugby became a [[municipal borough]] in 1932, and the old Rugby Urban District Council was replaced with Rugby Borough Council. The nearby parishes of [[Bilton, Warwickshire|Bilton]], [[Brownsover]], [[Hillmorton]] and [[Newbold-on-Avon]] were incorporated into the new borough. Further local government reform in 1974 saw the borough expand to include the whole of the abolished [[Rugby Rural District]].\n\nFrom 1926, near Rugby to its east was a large [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] farm for the [[Rugby VLF transmitter]]. All but four of the twelve big radio masts (used to broadcast the [[MSF time signal]]) were demolished in June 2004 \u2013 delayed by rabbits chewing through the wires controlling detonation.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/3823335.stm]</ref> The other four were demolished in 2007.\n\nIn the late 1930s [[Frank Whittle]] developed the [[jet engine]] in Rugby. With his work taking place at the British Thomson-Houston works, and at [[Brownsover Hall]].\n\nUnlike nearby [[Coventry]] and [[Nuneaton]], Rugby was highly fortunate to avoid German bombing during the Second World War. This is perhaps somewhat surprising given the town's strategic importance as a railway junction and engineering centre. A few stray bombs landed on [[Dunchurch]] and some meant for the English Electric works caused damage to housing at New Bilton, \nbut no other significant bomb damage occurred in the area.  \n\nIn the postwar years Rugby became a centre of the national motorway network. Two of Britain's most important motorways, the [[M1 motorway|M1]] and [[M6 motorway|M6]], as well as the [[M45 motorway|M45]], run close to the town. Rugby expanded further, especially at [[Brownsover]] and [[Cawston(Rugby)|Cawston]] where new housing estates were built.\n\nHowever, during the 1960s several of the railway lines which radiated from Rugby were closed as part of the [[Beeching axe]]. These included the once hugely important Midland Counties route to [[Leicester]], the lines to Leamington and Peterborough, and the Great Central Line. Rugby Central Station was closed in 1969, leaving the town with only one station. As of 2006, only the West Coast Mainline still serves the town. During the 1990s the [[Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal]], located just four miles to the east of the town, opened with connections to continental Europe and beyond.\n\nFrom the 1950s, Rugby gained a substantial Afro-Caribbean community, and a sizable community from the Indian sub-continent, making Rugby a multi-cultural town. There is a small [[Hindu]] temple in Rugby; it was converted from two adjacent [[terrace house]]s.\n\n==21st century==\n[[File:RugbyMap.png|thumb|Rugby in 2018.]]\nTwo major housing developments have rapidly increased the population of Rugby. The first called ''Cawston Grange'' was started in 2003 and vastly enlarged the then tiny hamlet of [[Cawston, Warwickshire|Cawston]] to the south-west of the town. Facilities there include a [[primary school]], shops, and a [[community centre]]]. Cawston is now connected to the rest of the town via [[Bilton, Warwickshire|Bilton]]. In conjunction with this the 3.7 mile [[Rugby Western Relief Road]] connecting Cawston with [[Newbold-on-Avon]] via [[New Bilton]] was completed in 2010.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-11263171 A 2010 BBC article about the opening of the road]</ref> As of 2018 a second wave of development in the area was well underway.\n\nThe second major area of development was to the east of the town between [[Hillmorton]] and [[Crick, Northamptonshire|Crick]].

Rugby's site on a plateau at about 400 feet above sea level, overlooking the [[River Avon, Warwickshire|River Avon]] made it an important strategic post overlooking the Avon, which was a natural barrier between the [[Dobunni]] and the [[Corieltauvi]] tribes. Iron Age remains, probably lookout posts or forts, have been located on either side of the Avon. \n\nIn [[Roman Britain|Roman]] times, two major [[Roman road]]s were built very close to the site of modern-day Rugby: the [[Fosse Way]] and [[Watling Street]]. Twelve miles north of Rugby is [[High Cross, Leicestershire|High Cross]] (Roman name [[Venonae]]), where the two roads cross. \n\nJust outside modern day Rugby, remains have been found of a Roman town called [[Tripontium]], on the original Watling Street which is now known as the [[A5 road (Great Britain)|A5]]. Historians believe that the settlement was a kind of ancient service station, providing [[stable|stabling]] and accommodation to passing Roman armies and travellers. \n\nRugby got its name in [[Anglo-Saxon England|Saxon]] times. It was first mentioned in the [[Domesday Book]] in 1086 as a small farming settlement then called  ''Rocheberie''. One theory is that the name came from the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''Hr\u014dceburh'' = \"Rook fort\", where Rook may be the birds or may be a man's name.  There is another theory that it is derived from an old [[Celtic language|Celtic]] name ''Droche-brig'' meaning \"wild hilltop\". [[Viking]] influence in the area changed the ending to the [[Old Norse]] ''-b\u00fd''; in 1200 it was spelt ''Rokebi''. The name later evolved into \"Rokeby\", and by the 18th century had become \"Rugby\".\n\nIn the 12th century Rugby was mentioned as having a [[castle]]. However the 'castle' was probably little more than a defended [[manor house]]. In any event the 'castle' was short lived. It was probably constructed during the reign of [[Stephen of England|King Stephen]] (1135\u20131154), and demolished in around 1157 on the orders of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]]. According to local legend, the stones from the castle were used to construct the west tower of St Andrew's church, which bears strong resemblance to a castle.\n\n==Market town==\n\nIn 1255, [[lord of the manor]] Henry de Rokeby obtained a market charter for Rugby, which became a small rural [[market town]], which it remained until the 19th century. The layout of the streets in the town centre around the market place still follows the pattern set down in medieval times. Rugby's built-up area was only High Street and Sheep Street and North Street and the Market Place.\n\nOne of the most significant events in the town's history was the founding in 1567 of [[Rugby School]]: [[Lawrence Sheriff]], a locally born grocer to Queen [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]], left money in his will to establish a school in Rugby for local boys. The school needed to take some fee-paying pupils from outside the area, to help pay the bills, and gradually became a largely fee-paying school.\n\nFrom medieval times until the late 18th century, the population of Rugby stayed at around 500\u20131000. It began to grow in the 1770s when the [[Oxford Canal]] was constructed around the town and spurred some growth in local industries and in population.\n\n==Brushes with history==\n\nRugby and its surrounding area had several brushes with some of the most important events in [[History of England|English history]].\n\n[[File:Guy Fawkes House -Dunchurch-20May2005.jpg|thumb|\"Guy Fawkes House\" in [[Dunchurch]]]]\nThe Rugby area has associations with the [[Gunpowder Plot]] \u2013 On the eve of the plot on 5 November 1605, the plotters stayed at an inn in nearby [[Dunchurch]] to await news of the plot. If it had been successful then they planned to kidnap the princess [[Elizabeth of Bohemia]], who was staying at nearby [[Coombe Abbey]], and install her as Queen.\n\nDuring the [[English Civil War]] in the 17th century, King [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] is said to have passed through Rugby on his way to [[Nottingham]] with 120 [[Cavaliers|Cavalier]] troops during 1642. The attitudes of the townsfolk were said to be too close to the [[Parliament of England|Parliamentarian]] cause for the king's liking. One of the most important battles of the war, the [[Battle of Naseby]] was fought some 15 miles east of Rugby.\n\nIn April 1645 [[Oliver Cromwell]] stayed in Rugby along with two regiments of [[Roundhead]] troops. He is said to have stayed at the \"Shoulder of Mutton Inn\" (where the Marks and Spencers shop used to be)\n\n==19th-century development==\nRugby for centuries was merely High Street, Sheep Street, North Street, and the Market Place. It only grew into an important settlement during the 19th century.\n\n===Influence of Rugby School===\nRugby School, one of England's oldest and most prestigious [[public school (England)|public schools]], rose to national prominence in the 1820s through the teaching methods pioneered by its headmaster, Dr [[Thomas Arnold]], which contributed to a radical change in [[Public school (UK)|Public School]] education in England. Most of the present school buildings, near the centre of the town, date from this period. In 1823 [[William Webb Ellis]] is said to have invented [[Rugby Football]] when he picked up the ball and ran with it.\n\nThe growing popularity of the school in the early 19th century led to an increase in population of the town. Many immigrants came to Rugby, many of whom were Rugby School pupils' parents, who preferred their sons to be able to go to a normal home life each night instead of having to endure school conditions (poor food, crowding, bullies) 24 hours every day; in Rugby such immigrants were called \"sojourners\". This caused Rugby to expand along Bilton Road and Dunchurch Road.\n\nRugby School during this period was immortalised by [[Thomas Hughes]] in his semi-autobiographical novel [[Tom Brown's Schooldays]].\n\n===Coming of the railways===\n[[Image:WCML at Rugby.jpg|thumb|right|The railway at Rugby in 2004]]\n\nThe major factor in the growth of Rugby was the arrival of railways. In 1835 Rugby was a small rural town with a population of around 2,500. However In 1838, one of the first trunk lines to be built in England, the [[London and Birmingham Railway]], an early part of what later became the [[West Coast Main Line]], was built around the town. \n\nIn 1840, the [[Midland Counties Railway]], which linked the [[East Midlands]] with [[North East England]], formed a junction with the London and Birmingham, making Rugby the busiest and most important railway junction in Britain.\n\nSoon railways were being built into Rugby from several different directions. The main [[Trent Valley Line]] from [[Stafford]] was built into Rugby in 1847. A line to [[Market Harborough]] and [[Peterborough]] was opened in 1850, and a line to [[Leamington Spa]] was opened in 1851. The [[Northampton loop line]] to [[Northampton]] opened in 1881.\n\nFor nearly 30 years, nearly all rail traffic between London, the Midlands, the north of England, [[Scotland]], and north [[Wales]] passed through Rugby junction, giving the town huge national importance.\n[[File:Railways of Rugby 1950.png|thumb|The railways of Rugby at their height in 1950. The lines to Leicester, Peterborough, Leamington Spa and the Great Central Main Line have now been closed.]]\nBy the 1860s the junction had become extremely congested, so much so that it was not uncommon for trains to have to queue for hours to pass through. This caused much anger and frustration amongst travellers, for whom Rugby became a byword for delays. [[Charles Dickens]] lampooned it in his short story [[Mugby Junction]] (1866). To relieve this congestion a new line, later called the [[Midland Main Line]], was built, taking a more direct route to London, avoiding Rugby. Much traffic was diverted onto the new line; Rugby remained one of the most important railway junctions in the country, but was no longer an all-important hub.\n\nThe first [[Rugby railway station]] was opened in 1838 when the London & Birmingham opened, located to the west of the present station. When the Midland Counties line was opened in 1840, the original station was badly located to serve the new line, and so a second station was opened close to the present one. This station lasted for over 40 years but proved to be inadequate to cope with traffic. In 1885 the present station was opened. \n\nIn 1899 the [[Great Central Main Line|Great Central Railway]] was built into Rugby and the town gained a second station {{rws|Rugby Central}} which offered an alternative route to London and the north.\n\n===Growth of industry===\n\nWith the railways, many wagon works, and engineering facilities were opened, and Rugby's population reached 10,000 by the 1880s, many employed by the railways. Because of its transport links, a number of industries developed in Rugby. \n\nIn 1862 the Rugby Lias Lime and Cement Co. Ltd. was founded, although manufacture of [[Portland cement|cement]] at the site began in 1855. Using the local [[Blue Lias]] clay.\n\nRugby began to develop more industries from the 1880s onwards. In 1881 a [[corset]] factory opened, employing local women. From the 1890s onwards Rugby began to attract engineering industry, due largely to its good transport links. The [[Willans & Robinson]] works opened in Rugby in 1893 which made [[steam engines]]. And in 1899 the [[British Thomson-Houston]] works opened which made electrical equipment and later [[turbines]]. Engineering would dominate the town's economy for most of the following century.\n\n===Challenges of growth===\n\nBy the middle of the 19th century Rugby's infrastructure had not kept pace with the increase in population. Most notably, there was not an adequate supply of drinking water which was mostly sourced from wells and street pumps, nor was there adequate sewerage or sanitation. These problems caused Rugby's growth to stall. In 1849 Rugby became the first town in England to have a [[Local board of health]], beating [[Croydon]] by a matter of weeks. The board had powers to levy a rate to provide drinking water and sewage facilities as well as powers to clean and pave streets and provide street lighting. However several early schemes to provide adequate drinking water were unsuccessful. It was not until 1876 that a reliable supply was obtained from the River Avon. \n\nUntil the 1870s, the cattle market was still held in the town centre as it had been since the Middle Ages. However this became increasingly unpopular with local residents. In 1878 the cattle market was moved near the railway station and within the last few years has been transformed into a housing estate \n\nIn 1894 Rugby became an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] and gained its first elected council.\n\n==20th century==\n[[File:Rugby (Warwickshire, England) at about WWII.jpg|thumb|right|Rugby at about the [[Second World War]]]]\nThe engineering works in Rugby attracted many workers to the town, and in the early decades of the 20th century the population grew rapidly and Rugby's built-up area spread fast in all directions. In 1901 the population of Rugby was 16,950, by the 1930s it had reached 40,000. \n\nDue to its expansion Rugby became a [[municipal borough]] in 1932, and the old Rugby Urban District Council was replaced with Rugby Borough Council. The nearby parishes of [[Bilton, Warwickshire|Bilton]], [[Brownsover]], [[Hillmorton]] and [[Newbold-on-Avon]] were incorporated into the new borough. Further local government reform in 1974 saw the borough expand to include the whole of the abolished [[Rugby Rural District]].\n\nFrom 1926, near Rugby to its east was a large [[antenna (electronics)|antenna]] farm for the [[Rugby VLF transmitter]]. All but four of the twelve big radio masts (used to broadcast the [[MSF time signal]]) were demolished in June 2004 \u2013 delayed by rabbits chewing through the wires controlling detonation.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/3823335.stm]</ref> The other four were demolished in 2007.\n\nIn the late 1930s [[Frank Whittle]] developed the [[jet engine]] in Rugby. With his work taking place at the British Thomson-Houston works, and at [[Brownsover Hall]].\n\nUnlike nearby [[Coventry]] and [[Nuneaton]], Rugby was highly fortunate to avoid German bombing during the Second World War. This is perhaps somewhat surprising given the town's strategic importance as a railway junction and engineering centre. A few stray bombs landed on [[Dunchurch]] and some meant for the English Electric works caused damage to housing at New Bilton, \nbut no other significant bomb damage occurred in the area.  \n\nIn the postwar years Rugby became a centre of the national motorway network. Two of Britain's most important motorways, the [[M1 motorway|M1]] and [[M6 motorway|M6]], as well as the [[M45 motorway|M45]], run close to the town. Rugby expanded further, especially at [[Brownsover]] and [[Cawston(Rugby)|Cawston]] where new housing estates were built.\n\nHowever, during the 1960s several of the railway lines which radiated from Rugby were closed as part of the [[Beeching axe]]. These included the once hugely important Midland Counties route to [[Leicester]], the lines to Leamington and Peterborough, and the Great Central Line. Rugby Central Station was closed in 1969, leaving the town with only one station. As of 2006, only the West Coast Mainline still serves the town. During the 1990s the [[Daventry International Rail Freight Terminal]], located just four miles to the east of the town, opened with connections to continental Europe and beyond.\n\nFrom the 1950s, Rugby gained a substantial Afro-Caribbean community, and a sizable community from the Indian sub-continent, making Rugby a multi-cultural town. There is a small [[Hindu]] temple in Rugby; it was converted from two adjacent [[terrace house]]s.\n\n==21st century==\n[[File:RugbyMap.png|thumb|Rugby in 2018.]]\nTwo major housing developments have rapidly increased the population of Rugby. The first called ''Cawston Grange'' was started in 2003 and vastly enlarged the then tiny hamlet of [[Cawston, Warwickshire|Cawston]] to the south-west of the town. Facilities there include a [[primary school]], shops, and a [[community centre]]]. Cawston is now connected to the rest of the town via [[Bilton, Warwickshire|Bilton]]. In conjunction with this the 3.7 mile [[Rugby Western Relief Road]] connecting Cawston with [[Newbold-on-Avon]] via [[New Bilton]] was completed in 2010.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-coventry-warwickshire-11263171 A 2010 BBC article about the opening of the road]</ref> As of 2018 a second wave of development in the area was well underway.\n\nThe second major area of development was to the east of the town between [[Hillmorton]] and [[Crick, Northamptonshire|Crick]]. Located on the site of the former [[Rugby Radio Station]], which was demolished in 2007, the new estate has been named [[Houlton, Warwickshire|Houlton]] and upon completion it is projected it will contain 6,200 houses.<ref>[https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/local-news/work-building-first-6000-new-11651151 A 2016 Coventry Telegraph article about the start of building work at Houlton]</ref> The first homeowners of phase one moved in during December 2017.

He is best known for his series of film collaborations with [[Michael Powell]], in a collaboration partnership known as [[Powell and Pressburger|the Archers]], and produced a series of films, including ''[[49th Parallel (film)|49th Parallel]]'' (1941), ''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp]]'' (1943), ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (US: ''Stairway to Heaven'', 1946), ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' (1947), ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'' (1948), and ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann (film)|The Tales of Hoffmann]]'' (1951).\n\n==Early years==\n'''Imre J\u00f3zsef Pressburger''' was born in [[Miskolc]], in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], of [[Jew]]ish heritage.<ref name=\"Behr1\">\"350 years: Variety Club colour supplement.\" ''Jewish Chronicle'', 15 December 2006, pp. 28\u201329.</ref> He was the only son (he had one elder half-sister from his father's previous marriage) of K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Pressburger, estate manager, and his second wife, K\u00e4therina (n\u00e9e Wichs). He attended a boarding-school in [[Timi\u0219oara|Temesv\u00e1r]], where he was a good pupil, excelling at mathematics, literature and music. He then studied mathematics and engineering at the Universities of [[Charles University in Prague|Prague]] and [[University of Stuttgart|Stuttgart]] before his father's death forced him to abandon his studies.<ref name=Macdonald>Macdonald 1994</ref>\n\n==Film career==\n===Berlin and Paris===\nPressburger began a career as a journalist. After working in Hungary and [[Weimer Republic|Germany]] he turned to screenwriting in the late 1920s, working for [[UFA GmbH|UFA]] in [[Berlin]] (having moved there in 1926).  The rise of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] forced him to flee to Paris, where he again worked as screenwriter, and then to London. He later said, \"[the] worst things that happened to me were the political consequences of events beyond my control ... the best things were exactly the same.\"\n\nPressburger's early films were mainly made in [[Weimer Republic|Germany]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] where he worked at the UFA Studios in the Dramaturgie department (script selection, approval and editing) and as a scriptwriter in his own right. In the 1930s, many European films were produced in [[multiple-language version]]s. Some of the films made in Germany survive with French intertitles and vice versa. \n\nIn 1933, after the [[Nazism|Nazis]] came to power, UFA's head sacked the company's remaining Jewish employees with Pressburger being told his contract would not be renewed. He left his Berlin apartment, \"leaving the key in the door so that the [[Stormtrooper]]s wouldn't have to break the door down\" and left for Paris. Late in 1935, Pressburger decided that he would do better in England.\n\n===Emigrated to the UK===\nPressburger entered Britain in 1935 on a [[Statelessness|stateless]] passport; once he decided to settle, he changed his name to Emeric in 1938. In England he found a small community of Hungarian film-makers who had fled the [[Nazism|Nazis]], including [[Alexander Korda]], owner of [[London Films]], who employed him as a screenwriter. Asked by Korda to improve the script for ''[[The Spy in Black]]'' (1939), he met the film's director, [[Michael Powell]]. [[Powell and Pressburger|Their partnership]] would produce some of the finest British films of the next decade.<ref name=\"Christie\">Christie 1985</ref> However, Pressburger still did some projects on his own.\n\nPressburger was much more than simply \"Michael Powell's screenwriter\" as some have categorised him. The films they made together in this period were mainly original stories by Pressburger, who also did most of the work of a producer for the team. Pressburger was also more involved in the editing process than Powell, and, as a musician, Pressburger was also involved in the choice of music for their films.\n\n===Later work===\nPowell and Pressburger began to go their separate ways after the mid-1950s. They remained close friends but wanted to explore different things, having done about as much as they could together. Two of his later films were made under the pseudonym \"Richard Imrie\".\n\nTwo novels by Pressburger were published. The first ''Killing a Mouse on a Sunday'' (1961), is set in the period immediately following the [[Spanish Civil War]]. It received favourable reviews and was soon translated into a dozen languages.

He is best known for his series of film collaborations with [[Michael Powell]], in a collaboration partnership known as [[Powell and Pressburger|the Archers]], and produced a series of films, including ''[[49th Parallel (film)|49th Parallel]]'' (1941), ''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp]]'' (1943), ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (US: ''Stairway to Heaven'', 1946), ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' (1947), ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]'' (1948), and ''[[The Tales of Hoffmann (film)|The Tales of Hoffmann]]'' (1951).\n\n==Early years==\n'''Imre J\u00f3zsef Pressburger''' was born in [[Miskolc]], in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], of [[Jew]]ish heritage.<ref name=\"Behr1\">\"350 years: Variety Club colour supplement.\" ''Jewish Chronicle'', 15 December 2006, pp. 28\u201329.</ref> He was the only son (he had one elder half-sister from his father's previous marriage) of K\u00e1lm\u00e1n Pressburger, estate manager, and his second wife, K\u00e4therina (n\u00e9e Wichs). He attended a boarding-school in [[Timi\u015foara|Temesv\u00e1r]], where he was a good pupil, excelling at mathematics, literature and music. He then studied mathematics and engineering at the Universities of [[Charles University in Prague|Prague]] and [[University of Stuttgart|Stuttgart]] before his father's death forced him to abandon his studies.<ref name=Macdonald>Macdonald 1994</ref>\n\n==Film career==\n===Berlin and Paris===\nPressburger began a career as a journalist. After working in Hungary and [[Weimer Republic|Germany]] he turned to screenwriting in the late 1920s, working for [[UFA GmbH|UFA]] in [[Berlin]] (having moved there in 1926).  The rise of the [[Nazism|Nazis]] forced him to flee to Paris, where he again worked as screenwriter, and then to London. He later said, \"[the] worst things that happened to me were the political consequences of events beyond my control ... the best things were exactly the same.\"\n\nPressburger's early films were mainly made in [[Weimer Republic|Germany]] and [[French Third Republic|France]] where he worked at the UFA Studios in the Dramaturgie department (script selection, approval and editing) and as a scriptwriter in his own right. In the 1930s, many European films were produced in [[multiple-language version]]s. Some of the films made in Germany survive with French intertitles and vice versa. \n\nIn 1933, after the [[Nazism|Nazis]] came to power, UFA's head sacked the company's remaining Jewish employees with Pressburger being told his contract would not be renewed. He left his Berlin apartment, \"leaving the key in the door so that the [[Stormtrooper]]s wouldn't have to break the door down\" and left for Paris. Late in 1935, Pressburger decided that he would do better in England.\n\n===Emigrated to the UK===\nPressburger entered Britain in 1935 on a [[Statelessness|stateless]] passport; once he decided to settle, he changed his name to Emeric in 1938. In England he found a small community of Hungarian film-makers who had fled the [[Nazism|Nazis]], including [[Alexander Korda]], owner of [[London Films]], who employed him as a screenwriter. Asked by Korda to improve the script for ''[[The Spy in Black]]'' (1939), he met the film's director, [[Michael Powell]]. [[Powell and Pressburger|Their partnership]] would produce some of the finest British films of the next decade.<ref name=\"Christie\">Christie 1985</ref> However, Pressburger still did some projects on his own.\n\nPressburger was much more than simply \"Michael Powell's screenwriter\" as some have categorised him. The films they made together in this period were mainly original stories by Pressburger, who also did most of the work of a producer for the team. Pressburger was also more involved in the editing process than Powell, and, as a musician, Pressburger was also involved in the choice of music for their films.\n\n===Later work===\nPowell and Pressburger began to go their separate ways after the mid-1950s. They remained close friends but wanted to explore different things, having done about as much as they could together. Two of his later films were made under the pseudonym \"Richard Imrie\".\n\nTwo novels by Pressburger were published. The first ''Killing a Mouse on a Sunday'' (1961), is set in the period immediately following the [[Spanish Civil War]]. It received favourable reviews and was soon translated into a dozen languages. ''The Glass Pearls'' (1966), reissued in 2015 by [[Faber and Faber|Faber]], gained an especially negative assessment from ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', its only review. It was described by Lucy Scholes in ''[[The Paris Review]]'' in 2019 as \"a truly remarkable work. It deserves to be recognized both for its own virtuosity, and as an important addition to the genre of Holocaust literature.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Scholes|first=Lucy|url=https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2019/10/18/emeric-pressburgers-lost-nazi-novel/|title=Emeric Pressburger\u2019s Lost Nazi Novel|work=The Paris Review|date=18 October 2019|access-date=19 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn 24 June 1938, Pressburger married [[\u00c1gi Don\u00e1th]], the daughter of Andor Don\u00e1th, a general merchant, but they divorced in 1941.

There are many metrics that can be used to measure the performance of a classifier or predictor; different fields have different preferences for specific metrics due to different goals. For example, in medicine [[sensitivity and specificity]] are often used, while in computer science [[precision and recall]] are preferred. An important distinction is between metrics that are independent on the [[prevalence]] (how often each category occurs in the population), and metrics that depend on the prevalence \u2013 both types are useful, but they have very different properties.\n\n==Contingency table==\n{{main article|Confusion matrix}}\n\nGiven a data set, a classification (the output of a classifier on that set) gives two numbers: the number of positives and the number of negatives, which add up to the total size of the set. To evaluate a classifier, one compares its output to another reference classification \u2013 ideally a perfect classification, but in practice the output of another [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]] test \u2013 and [[cross tabulation|cross tabulates]] the data into a 2\u00d72 [[contingency table]], comparing the two classifications. One then evaluates the classifier ''relative'' to the gold standard by computing [[summary statistic]]s of these 4 numbers. Generally these statistics will be [[scale invariant]] (scaling all the numbers by the same factor does not change the output), to make them independent of population size, which is achieved by using ratios of [[homogeneous function]]s, most simply [[homogeneous linear]] or [[homogeneous quadratic]] functions.\n\nSay we test some people for the presence of a disease. Some of these people have the disease, and our test correctly says they are positive. They are called ''[[true positive]]s'' (TP). Some have the disease, but the test incorrectly claims they don't. They are called ''[[false negative]]s'' (FN). Some don't have the disease, and the test says they don't \u2013 ''[[true negative]]s'' (TN). Finally, there might be healthy people who have a positive test result \u2013 ''[[false positive]]s'' (FP). These can be arranged into a 2\u00d72 contingency table ([[confusion matrix]]), conventionally with the test result on the vertical axis and the actual condition on the horizontal axis.\n\nThese numbers can then be totaled, yielding both a [[grand total]] and [[marginal total]]s. Totaling the entire table, the number of true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives add up to 100% of the set. Totaling the rows (adding horizontally) the number of true positives and false positives add up to 100% of the test positives, and likewise for negatives. Totaling the columns (adding vertically), the number of true positives and false negatives add up to 100% of the condition positives (conversely for negatives). The basic marginal ratio statistics are obtained by dividing the 2\u00d72=4 values in the table by the marginal totals (either rows or columns), yielding 2 auxiliary 2\u00d72 tables, for a total of 8 ratios. These ratios come in 4 complementary pairs, each pair summing to 1, and so each of these derived 2\u00d72 tables can be summarized as a pair of 2 numbers, together with their complements. Further statistics can be obtained by taking ratios of these ratios, ratios of ratios, or more complicated functions.\n\nThe contingency table and the most common derived ratios are summarized below; see sequel for details.\n\n{{DiagnosticTesting Diagram}}\n\nNote that the columns correspond to the ''condition actually'' being positive or negative (or classified as such by the gold standard), as indicated by the color-coding, and the associated statistics are prevalence-independent, while the rows correspond to the ''test'' being positive or negative, and the associated statistics are prevalence-dependent. There are analogous likelihood ratios for prediction values, but these are less commonly used, and not depicted above.\n\n== Sensitivity and specificity ==\n{{main article|Sensitivity and specificity}}\nThe fundamental prevalence-independent statistics are [[sensitivity and specificity]].\n\n'''[[Sensitivity (tests)|Sensitivity]]''' or [[True Positive Rate]] (TPR), also known as [[Recall (information retrieval)|recall]], is the proportion of people that tested positive and are positive (True Positive, TP) of all the people that actually are positive (Condition Positive, CP = TP + FN). It can be seen as ''the probability that the test is positive given that the patient is sick''. With higher sensitivity, fewer actual cases of disease go undetected (or, in the case of the factory quality control, fewer faulty products go to the market).\n\n'''[[Specificity (tests)|Specificity]]''' (SPC) or [[True Negative Rate]] (TNR) is the proportion of people that tested negative and are negative (True Negative, TN) of all the people that actually are negative (Condition Negative, CN = TN + FP). As with sensitivity, it can be looked at as ''the probability that the test result is negative given that the patient is not sick''. With higher specificity, fewer healthy people are labeled as sick (or, in the factory case, fewer good products are discarded).\n\nThe relationship between sensitivity and specificity, as well as the performance of the classifier, can be visualized and studied using the [[Receiver Operating Characteristic]] (ROC) curve.\n\nIn theory, sensitivity and specificity are independent in the sense that it is possible to achieve 100% in both (such as in the red/blue ball example given above). In more practical, less contrived instances, however, there is usually a trade-off, such that they are inversely proportional to one another to some extent. This is because we rarely measure the actual thing we would like to classify; rather, we generally measure an indicator of the thing we would like to classify, referred to as a [[surrogate endpoint|surrogate marker]]. The reason why 100% is achievable in the ball example is because redness and blueness is determined by directly detecting redness and blueness. However, indicators are sometimes compromised, such as when non-indicators mimic indicators or when indicators are time-dependent, only becoming evident after a certain lag time. The following example of a pregnancy test will make use of such an indicator.\n\nModern pregnancy tests ''do not'' use the pregnancy itself to determine pregnancy status; rather, [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] is used, or hCG, present in the urine of [[gravid]] females, as a ''surrogate marker to indicate'' that a woman is pregnant.  Because hCG can also be produced by a [[neoplasm|tumor]], the specificity of modern pregnancy tests cannot be 100% (because false positives are possible).  Also, because hCG is present in the urine in such small concentrations after fertilization and early [[embryogenesis]], the sensitivity of modern pregnancy tests cannot be 100% (because false negatives are possible).\n\n===Likelihood ratios===\n{{main article|Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing}}\n{{empty section|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Positive and negative predictive values==\n{{main article|Positive and negative predictive values}}\nIn addition to sensitivity and specificity, the performance of a binary classification test can be measured with [[positive predictive value]] (PPV), also known as [[Precision (information retrieval)|precision]], and [[negative predictive value]] (NPV). The positive prediction value answers the question \"If the test result is ''positive'', how well does that ''predict'' an actual presence of disease?\". It is calculated as TP/(TP + FP); that is, it is the proportion of true positives out of all positive results. The negative prediction value is the same, but for negatives, naturally.\n\n=== Impact of prevalence on prediction values ===\nPrevalence has a significant impact on prediction values. As an example, suppose there is a test for a disease with 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity. If 2000 people are tested and the prevalence (in the sample) is 50%, 1000 of them are sick and 1000 of them are healthy. Thus about 990 true positives and 990 true negatives are likely, with 10 false positives and 10 false negatives. The positive and negative prediction values would be 99%, so there can be high confidence in the result.\n\nHowever, if the prevalence is only 5%, so of the 2000 people only 100 are really sick, then the prediction values change significantly. The likely result is 99 true positives, 1 false negative, 1881 true negatives and 19 false positives. Of the 19+99 people tested positive, only 99 really have the disease \u2013 that means, intuitively, that given that a patient's test result is positive, there is only 84% chance that they really have the disease. On the other hand, given that the patient's test result is negative, there is only 1 chance in 1882, or 0.05% probability, that the patient has the disease despite the test result.\n\n===Likelihood ratios===\n{{empty section|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Precision and recall==\n{{main article|Precision and recall}}\n{{empty section|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Relationships===\nThere are various relationships between these ratios.\n\nIf the prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity are known, the positive predictive value can be obtained from the following identity:\n\n::<math> \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(\\text{sensitivity}) (\\text{prevalence})}{(\\text{sensitivity}) (\\text{prevalence}) + (1 - \\text{specificity}) (1-\\text{prevalence})} </math>\n\nIf the prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity are known, the negative predictive value can be obtained from the following identity:\n\n::<math> \n\\text{NPV} = \\frac{(\\text{specificity}) (1 - \\text{prevalence})}{(\\text{specificity}) (1 - \\text{prevalence}) + (1 - \\text{sensitivity}) (\\text{prevalence})}. </math>\n\n==Single metrics==\nIn addition to the paired metrics, there are also single metrics that give a single number to evaluate the test.\n\nPerhaps the simplest statistic is [[Accuracy and precision#In binary classification|accuracy]] or Fraction Correct (FC), which measures the fraction of all instances that are correctly categorized; it is the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the total number of correct or incorrect classifications: (TP + TN)/Total Population = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN). This is often not very useful, compared to the marginal ratios, as it does not yield useful marginal interpretations, due to mixing true positives (test positive, condition positive) and true negatives (test negative, condition negative) \u2013 in terms of the condition table, it sums the diagonal; further, it is prevalence-dependent. The complement is the Fraction Incorrect (FiC): FC + FiC = 1, or (FP + FN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN) \u2013 this is the sum of the [[antidiagonal]], divided by the total population.\n\nThe [[diagnostic odds ratio]] (DOR) is a more useful overall metric, which can be defined directly as (TP\u00d7TN)/(FP\u00d7FN) = (TP/FN)/(FP/TN), or indirectly as a ratio of ratio of ratios (ratio of likelihood ratios, which are themselves ratios of True Rates or Prediction Values). This has a useful interpretation \u2013 as an [[odds ratio]] \u2013 and is prevalence-independent.\n\nAn [[F-score]] is a combination of the [[Precision (information retrieval)|precision]] and the [[Recall (information retrieval)|recall]], providing a single score. There is a one-parameter family of statistics, with parameter ''\u03b2,'' which determines the relative weights of precision and recall. The traditional or balanced F-score ([[F1 score]]) is the [[Harmonic mean#Harmonic mean of two numbers|harmonic mean]] of precision and recall:\n\n:<math>F_1 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{precision} \\cdot \\mathrm{recall}}{\\mathrm{precision} + \\mathrm{recall}} </math>.\n\n===Alternative metrics===\nNote, however, that the F-scores do not take the true negative rate into account, and are more suited to [[information retrieval]] and [[information extraction]] evaluation where the true negatives are innumerable. Instead, measures such as the [[Phi coefficient]], [[Matthews correlation coefficient]], [[Informedness]] or [[Cohen's kappa]] may be preferable to assess the performance of a binary classifier.<ref name=\"Powers2007\">{{cite journal |first=David M W |last=Powers |date=2011 |title=Evaluation: From Precision, Recall and F-Score to ROC, Informedness, Markedness & Correlation |journal=Journal of Machine Learning Technologies |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=37\u201363 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2328/27165}}</ref><ref name=Powers2012>{{cite conference |first=David M.

Totaling the entire table, the number of true positives, false negatives, true negatives, and false positives add up to 100% of the set. Totaling the rows (adding horizontally) the number of true positives and false positives add up to 100% of the test positives, and likewise for negatives. Totaling the columns (adding vertically), the number of true positives and false negatives add up to 100% of the condition positives (conversely for negatives). The basic marginal ratio statistics are obtained by dividing the 2\u00d72=4 values in the table by the marginal totals (either rows or columns), yielding 2 auxiliary 2\u00d72 tables, for a total of 8 ratios. These ratios come in 4 complementary pairs, each pair summing to 1, and so each of these derived 2\u00d72 tables can be summarized as a pair of 2 numbers, together with their complements. Further statistics can be obtained by taking ratios of these ratios, ratios of ratios, or more complicated functions.\n\nThe contingency table and the most common derived ratios are summarized below; see sequel for details.\n\n{{DiagnosticTesting Diagram}}\n\nNote that the columns correspond to the ''condition actually'' being positive or negative (or classified as such by the gold standard), as indicated by the color-coding, and the associated statistics are prevalence-independent, while the rows correspond to the ''test'' being positive or negative, and the associated statistics are prevalence-dependent. There are analogous likelihood ratios for prediction values, but these are less commonly used, and not depicted above.\n\n== Sensitivity and specificity ==\n{{main article|Sensitivity and specificity}}\nThe fundamental prevalence-independent statistics are [[sensitivity and specificity]].\n\n'''[[Sensitivity (tests)|Sensitivity]]''' or [[True Positive Rate]] (TPR), also known as [[Recall (information retrieval)|recall]], is the proportion of people that tested positive and are positive (True Positive, TP) of all the people that actually are positive (Condition Positive, CP = TP + FN). It can be seen as ''the probability that the test is positive given that the patient is sick''. With higher sensitivity, fewer actual cases of disease go undetected (or, in the case of the factory quality control, fewer faulty products go to the market).\n\n'''[[Specificity (tests)|Specificity]]''' (SPC) or [[True Negative Rate]] (TNR) is the proportion of people that tested negative and are negative (True Negative, TN) of all the people that actually are negative (Condition Negative, CN = TN + FP). As with sensitivity, it can be looked at as ''the probability that the test result is negative given that the patient is not sick''. With higher specificity, fewer healthy people are labeled as sick (or, in the factory case, fewer good products are discarded).\n\nThe relationship between sensitivity and specificity, as well as the performance of the classifier, can be visualized and studied using the [[Receiver Operating Characteristic]] (ROC) curve.\n\nIn theory, sensitivity and specificity are independent in the sense that it is possible to achieve 100% in both (such as in the red/blue ball example given above). In more practical, less contrived instances, however, there is usually a trade-off, such that they are inversely proportional to one another to some extent. This is because we rarely measure the actual thing we would like to classify; rather, we generally measure an indicator of the thing we would like to classify, referred to as a [[surrogate endpoint|surrogate marker]]. The reason why 100% is achievable in the ball example is because redness and blueness is determined by directly detecting redness and blueness. However, indicators are sometimes compromised, such as when non-indicators mimic indicators or when indicators are time-dependent, only becoming evident after a certain lag time. The following example of a pregnancy test will make use of such an indicator.\n\nModern pregnancy tests ''do not'' use the pregnancy itself to determine pregnancy status; rather, [[human chorionic gonadotropin]] is used, or hCG, present in the urine of [[gravid]] females, as a ''surrogate marker to indicate'' that a woman is pregnant.  Because hCG can also be produced by a [[neoplasm|tumor]], the specificity of modern pregnancy tests cannot be 100% (because false positives are possible).  Also, because hCG is present in the urine in such small concentrations after fertilization and early [[embryogenesis]], the sensitivity of modern pregnancy tests cannot be 100% (because false negatives are possible).\n\n===Likelihood ratios===\n{{main article|Likelihood ratios in diagnostic testing}}\n{{empty section|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Positive and negative predictive values==\n{{main article|Positive and negative predictive values}}\nIn addition to sensitivity and specificity, the performance of a binary classification test can be measured with [[positive predictive value]] (PPV), also known as [[Precision (information retrieval)|precision]], and [[negative predictive value]] (NPV). The positive prediction value answers the question \"If the test result is ''positive'', how well does that ''predict'' an actual presence of disease?\". It is calculated as TP/(TP + FP); that is, it is the proportion of true positives out of all positive results. The negative prediction value is the same, but for negatives, naturally.\n\n=== Impact of prevalence on prediction values ===\nPrevalence has a significant impact on prediction values. As an example, suppose there is a test for a disease with 99% sensitivity and 99% specificity. If 2000 people are tested and the prevalence (in the sample) is 50%, 1000 of them are sick and 1000 of them are healthy. Thus about 990 true positives and 990 true negatives are likely, with 10 false positives and 10 false negatives. The positive and negative prediction values would be 99%, so there can be high confidence in the result.\n\nHowever, if the prevalence is only 5%, so of the 2000 people only 100 are really sick, then the prediction values change significantly. The likely result is 99 true positives, 1 false negative, 1881 true negatives and 19 false positives. Of the 19+99 people tested positive, only 99 really have the disease \u2013 that means, intuitively, that given that a patient's test result is positive, there is only 84% chance that they really have the disease. On the other hand, given that the patient's test result is negative, there is only 1 chance in 1882, or 0.05% probability, that the patient has the disease despite the test result.\n\n===Likelihood ratios===\n{{empty section|date=July 2014}}\n\n==Precision and recall==\n{{main article|Precision and recall}}\n{{empty section|date=July 2014}}\n\n===Relationships===\nThere are various relationships between these ratios.\n\nIf the prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity are known, the positive predictive value can be obtained from the following identity:\n\n::<math> \\text{PPV} = \\frac{(\\text{sensitivity}) (\\text{prevalence})}{(\\text{sensitivity}) (\\text{prevalence}) + (1 - \\text{specificity}) (1-\\text{prevalence})} </math>\n\nIf the prevalence, sensitivity, and specificity are known, the negative predictive value can be obtained from the following identity:\n\n::<math> \n\\text{NPV} = \\frac{(\\text{specificity}) (1 - \\text{prevalence})}{(\\text{specificity}) (1 - \\text{prevalence}) + (1 - \\text{sensitivity}) (\\text{prevalence})}. </math>\n\n==Single metrics==\nIn addition to the paired metrics, there are also single metrics that give a single number to evaluate the test.\n\nPerhaps the simplest statistic is [[Accuracy and precision#In binary classification|accuracy]] or Fraction Correct (FC), which measures the fraction of all instances that are correctly categorized; it is the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the total number of correct or incorrect classifications: (TP + TN)/Total Population = (TP + TN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN). This is often not very useful, compared to the marginal ratios, as it does not yield useful marginal interpretations, due to mixing true positives (test positive, condition positive) and true negatives (test negative, condition negative) \u2013 in terms of the condition table, it sums the diagonal; further, it is prevalence-dependent. The complement is the Fraction Incorrect (FiC): FC + FiC = 1, or (FP + FN)/(TP + TN + FP + FN) \u2013 this is the sum of the [[antidiagonal]], divided by the total population.\n\nThe [[diagnostic odds ratio]] (DOR) is a more useful overall metric, which can be defined directly as (TP\u00d7TN)/(FP\u00d7FN) = (TP/FN)/(FP/TN), or indirectly as a ratio of ratio of ratios (ratio of likelihood ratios, which are themselves ratios of True Rates or Prediction Values). This has a useful interpretation \u2013 as an [[odds ratio]] \u2013 and is prevalence-independent.\n\nAn [[F-score]] is a combination of the [[Precision (information retrieval)|precision]] and the [[Recall (information retrieval)|recall]], providing a single score. There is a one-parameter family of statistics, with parameter ''\u03b2,'' which determines the relative weights of precision and recall. The traditional or balanced F-score ([[F1 score]]) is the [[Harmonic mean#Harmonic mean of two numbers|harmonic mean]] of precision and recall:\n\n:<math>F_1 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{\\mathrm{precision} \\cdot \\mathrm{recall}}{\\mathrm{precision} + \\mathrm{recall}} </math>.\n\n===Alternative metrics===\nNote, however, that the F-scores do not take the true negative rate into account, and are more suited to [[information retrieval]] and [[information extraction]] evaluation where the true negatives are innumerable. Instead, measures such as the [[Phi coefficient]], [[Matthews correlation coefficient]], [[Informedness]] or [[Cohen's kappa]] may be preferable to assess the performance of a binary classifier.<ref name=\"Powers2007\">{{cite journal |first=David M W |last=Powers |date=2011 |title=Evaluation: From Precision, Recall and F-Score to ROC, Informedness, Markedness & Correlation |journal=Journal of Machine Learning Technologies |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=37\u201363 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/2328/27165}}</ref><ref name=Powers2012>{{cite conference |first=David M.

Before the Iazyge conquest in the 1st century, Indo-European peoples of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]], [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Dacians|Dacian]] descent inhabited this area. In the 3rd century BC, this area was controlled by Celtic [[Boii]] and [[Eravisci]], while in the 1st century BC, it became part of the [[Dacian kingdom]]. Since the 1st century, the area came under the control of the [[Sarmatian]] [[Iazyges]] (which possibly included [[Serboi]]{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} tribe), who occasionally were allies and occasionally enemies of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]].

These peoples included [[Huns]], [[Gepids]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Slavs]] and [[Bulgarians]]. [[Slavs]] settled today's Subotica in the 6th and 7th centuries, before some of them crossed the rivers Sava and Danube and settled in the [[Balkans]].\n\nThe Slavic tribe living in the territory of present-day Subotica were the [[Obotrites]], a subgroup of the [[Serbs]]. In the 9th century, after the fall of the Avar state, the first forms of Slavic statehood emerged in this area. The first Slavic states that ruled over this region included the [[Principality of Lower Pannonia]], [[Great Moravia]] and the [[Bulgarian Empire]].\n\n===Late-Middle Ages===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Tsar Jovan Nenad monument.jpg|[[Emperor Jovan Nenad]] monument in the downtown|thumb|left]]\nSubotica probably first became a settlement of note when people poured into it from nearby villages destroyed during the [[Tatar invasions]] of 1241\u201342. However the settlement has surely been older. It has been established that people inhabited these territories even 3000 years ago.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} When ''Zabadka''/''Zabatka'' was first recorded in 1391, it was a tiny town in the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Later, the city belonged to the [[Hunyadi family|Hunyadis]], one of the most influential aristocratic families in the whole of [[Central Europe]].\n\nKing [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary]] gave the town to one of his relatives, [[J\u00e1nos Pongr\u00e1c Dengelegi]], who, fearing an invasion by the [[Ottoman Empire]], fortified the castle of Subotica, erecting a fortress in 1470. Some decades later, after the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, Subotica became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The majority of the Hungarian population fled northward to [[Royal Hungary]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} [[B\u00e1lint T\u00f6r\u00f6k]], a local noble who had ruled over Subotica, also escaped from the city. During the military and political havoc following the defeat at [[Moh\u00e1cs]], Subotica came under the control of Serbian [[mercenaries]] recruited in [[Banat]]. These soldiers were in the service of the [[Transylvania]]n general [[John Z\u00e1polya|John I Z\u00e1polya]], a later Hungarian king.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe leader of these mercenaries, [[Jovan Nenad]], established in 1526\u201327 his rule in [[Ba\u010dka]], northern [[Banat]] and a small part of [[Syrmia]] and created an independent entity, with Subotica as its administrative centre. At the peak of his power, Jovan Nenad proclaimed himself as Serbian [[tsar]] in Subotica. He named [[Radoslav \u010celnik]] as the general commander of his army, while his treasurer and [[palatine]] was Subota Vrli\u0107, a Serbian noble from [[Jagodina]]. When B\u00e1lint T\u00f6r\u00f6k returned and recaptured Subotica from the Serbs, Jovan Nenad moved the administrative centre to [[Szeged]].<ref>Borovszky Samu: Magyarorsz\u00e1g v\u00e1rmegy\u00e9i \u00e9s v\u00e1rosai, B\u00e1cs-Bodrog v\u00e1rmegye I-II. k\u00f6tet, Apoll\u00f3 Irodalmi \u00e9s Nyomdai R\u00e9szv\u00e9nyt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g, 1909.</ref>\n\nSome months later, in the summer of 1527, Jovan Nenad was [[assassinated]] and his entity collapsed.

At the end of this almost 150-year-long period, not much remained of the old town of ''Zabadka''/''Zabatka''. As much of the population had fled, the Ottomans encouraged the settlement of the area by different colonists from the [[Balkans]]. The settlers were mostly [[Serbian Orthodox|Orthodox]] [[Serbs]]. They cultivated the extremely fertile land around Subotica. In 1570, the population of Subotica numbered 49 houses, and in 1590, 63 houses. In 1687, the region was settled by [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] ''[[Dalmatia|Dalmatas]]'' (called [[Bunjevci]] today). It was called ''Sobotka'' under Ottoman rule and was a kaza centre in [[Sanjak of Segedin|Segedin]] sanjak at first in [[Budin Province, Ottoman Empire|Budin Eyaleti]] until 1596, and after that in [[Egir Province, Ottoman Empire|E\u011fri Eyaleti]] between 1596\u20131686.<ref>[[Sanjak of Segedin]]</ref>\n\n===Habsburg administration===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nIn 1687, about 5,000 [[Bunjevci]], led by Dujo Markovi\u0107 and \u0110uro Vidakovi\u0107 settled in Ba\u010dka (including Subotica). After the decisive battle against the Ottomans at [[Senta]] led by [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] on 11 September 1697, Subotica became part of the [[Military Frontier|military border]] zone [[Potisje|Theiss]]-[[Pomori\u0161je|Mieresch]] established by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. In the meantime the uprising of [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] broke out, which is also known as the [[Kuruc War]].\n\nIn the region of Subotica, R\u00e1k\u00f3czi joined battle against the ''Rac National Militia''. ''[[R\u00e1c (ethnonym)|R\u00e1c]]'' was a designation for the South Slavic people (mostly Serbs and Bunjevci) and they often were referred to as ''r\u00e1cok'' in the Kingdom of Hungary. In a later period ''r\u00e1cok'' came to mean, above all, Serbs of Orthodox religion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\nThe Serbian military families enjoyed several privileges thanks to their service for the Habsburg Monarchy. Subotica gradually, however, developed from being a mere garrison town to becoming a market town with its own civil charter in 1743. When this happened, many Serbs complained about the loss of their privileges. The majority left the town in protest and some of them founded a new settlement just outside 18th century Subotica in [[Aleksandrovo, Subotica|Aleksandrovo]], while others emigrated to [[Russia]]. In [[New Serbia (historical province)|New Serbia]], a new Russian province established for them, those Serbs founded a new settlement and also named it ''Subotica''. In 1775, a Jewish community in Subotica was established.\n\nIt was perhaps to emphasise the new civic serenity of Subotica that the pious name ''[[Saint Mary]]'' came to be used for it at this time. Some decades later, in 1779, Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] advanced the town's status further by proclaiming it a Free Royal Town. The enthusiastic inhabitants of the city renamed Subotica once more as ''Maria-Theresiopolis''.\n\nThis Free Royal Town status gave a great impetus to the development of the city. During the 19th century its population doubled twice, attracting many people from all over the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. This led eventually to a considerable demographic change. In the first half of the 19th century, the Bunjevci had still been in the majority, but there was an increasing number of Hungarians and Jews settling in Subotica. This process was not stopped even by the outbreak of the [[Revolutions of 1848|Revolutions in the Habsburg Monarchy (1848-49)]].\n\n===1848/1849 Revolutions===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Szabadka_1.jpg|thumb|left|Subotica (Szabadka) in 1914 Hungarian postcard]]\nDuring the 1848-49 revolution, the proclaimed borders of autonomous [[Serbian Vojvodina]] included Subotica, but Serb troops could not establish control in the region. On 5 March 1849, at the locality named Kaponja (between Tavankut and Bajmok), there was a battle between the Serb and Hungarian armies, which was won by the Hungarians.\n\nThe first newspaper in the town was also published during the 1848/49 revolution\u2014it was called ''Honunk \u00e1llapota'' (\"State of Our Homeland\") and was published in Hungarian by K\u00e1roly Bitterman's local printing company. Unlike most Serbs and Croats who confronted the Hungarians, part of the local Bunjevci people supported the Hungarian revolution.\n\nIn 1849, after the [[Hungarian revolution of 1848]] was defeated by the Russian and Habsburg armies, the town was separated from the Kingdom of Hungary together with most of the Ba\u010dka region, and became part of a separate Habsburg province, called [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]]. The administrative centre of this new province was [[Timi\u0219oara]]. The province existed until 1860. During the existence of the voivodeship, in 1853, Subotica acquired its impressive theatre.\n\n===Hungarian administration===\nAfter the establishment of the [[Ausgleich|Dual-Monarchy]] in 1867, there followed what is often called the \"golden age\" of city development of Subotica. Many schools were opened after 1867 and in 1869 the railway connected the city to the world. In 1896 an electrical power plant was built, further enhancing the development of the city and the whole region. Subotica now adorned itself with its remarkable Central European, [[fin de si\u00e8cle]] architecture. In 1902 a Jewish synagogue was built in the [[Art Nouveau]] style.\n\nBetween 1849 and 1860 it was part of the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?ID=58589|title=Subotica {{!}} Hrvatska enciklopedija|website=www.enciklopedija.hr|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\n\n===Yugoslavia and Serbia===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Le\u0161evi na Sen\u0107anskom putu.jpg|left|thumb|Hungarian occupation troops massacred [[Serbia]]n and [[Jews|Jewish]] civilians during the occupation (1941-1944)]]\nSubotica was part of [[Austria-Hungary]] until the aftermath of [[World War I]] in 1918, when the city became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. In changed economic and political circumstances, Subotica was now a border-town in [[Yugoslavia]] and did not, for a time, experience again the dynamic prosperity it enjoyed in the years preceding World War I. However, at that time, Subotica was the third largest city in Yugoslavia by population, following [[Belgrade]] and [[Zagreb]].\n\nIn 1941, Yugoslavia was invaded and partitioned by the [[Axis Powers]], and its northern parts, including Subotica, were [[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories|annexed by Hungary]] (This partition of Yugoslavia was not recognized by the international community and city was, from the legal point of view, still part of Yugoslavia, whose only legal representative was the Yugoslav government in exile). Hungarian troops entered Subotica on 11 April 1941.\n\nAs the majority of people living in the city were ethnic Hungarians and the city had been part of Hungary for over 600 years, Hungary felt it had to protect its people now living outside of its borders. During [[World War II]] the city lost approximately 7,000 of its citizens, mostly Serbs, Hungarians and Jews. Before the war about 6,000 [[Jews]] lived in Subotica; many of these were deported from the city during the [[Holocaust]], mostly to [[Auschwitz]].\n\nIn April 1944, a ghetto was set up. In addition, many [[communists]] were put to death during Axis rule. In 1944, the Axis forces left the city, and Subotica became part of the new [[Yugoslavia]]. During the 1944\u201345 period, about 8,000 citizens (mainly Hungarian) were killed by [[Yugoslav partisans|Partisans]] while re-taking the city as retribution for supporting Axis Hungary.<ref>M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros S\u00e1ndor: Holtt\u00e1 nyilv\u00e1n\u00edtva - D\u00e9lvid\u00e9ki magyar f\u00e1tum 1944\u201345, I-II, Hatodik S\u00edp Alap\u00edtv\u00e1ny, Budapest 1995.</ref><ref>Cseres Tibor: V\u00e9rbossz\u00fa B\u00e1csk\u00e1ban, Magvet\u0151 kiad\u00f3, Budapest 1991.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref>\n\nIn the post-war period, Subotica has gradually been modernised. During the [[Yugoslav wars|Yugoslav]] and [[Kosovo war|Kosovo]] wars of the 1990s, a considerable number of Serb refugees came to the city from [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Kosovo]], while many ethnic Hungarians and Croats, as well as some local Serbs, left the region due to economical stagnation and fear of racism.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Cityscape==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Folk_Theater_Subotica_Serbia.JPG|thumb|right|[[National Theatre in Subotica]]]]\n[[File:Subotica02.jpg|thumb|right|Municipal Library]]\n[[File:Pa\u0142ac Rajhla (Galeria Sztuki Wsp\u00f3\u0142czesnej) w Suboticy.jpg|thumb|right|[[Reichel Palace]]]]\n[[File:Suboticka arhitektura.jpg|thumb|right|Secession architecture in downtown]]\nUnique in Serbia, Subotica has the most buildings built in the art nouveau style.

The local football team is [[FK Spartak Zlatibor Voda|Spartak]] and plays in the [[Serbian SuperLiga]], the country's primary football competition.\n\n==Media==\nNewspapers and magazines published in Subotica:\n* ''[[Magyar Sz\u00f3]]'', daily newspaper in Hungarian, founded 1944, published in Subotica since 2006.\n* ''[[Suboti\u010dke novine]]'', main weekly newspaper in Serbian.\n* ''[[Bunjeva\u010dke novine]]'', in Bunjevac.\n* ''[[Hrvatska rije\u010d]]'', in Croatian.\n* ''[[Zvonik]]'', in Croatian\n\n==Infrastructure==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2016}}\n[[A1 motorway (Serbia)|A1 motorway]] connects the city with [[Novi Sad]] and [[Belgrade]] to the south and, across the border with Hungary, with [[Szeged]] to the north. It runs alongside the Budapest\u2013Belgrade railway, which connects it to major European cities.\n\nThe city used to have a tram system, the [[Subotica tram system]], but it was discontinued in 1974. The Subotica tram, put into operation in 1897, ran on electricity from the start. While neighbouring cities' trams at this date were often still horse-drawn, this gave the Subotica system an advantage over other municipalities including Belgrade, Novi Sad, Zagreb, and Szeged. Its existence was important for the citizens of Subotica, as well as tourists who came to visit.\nSubotica has since developed a bus system. The Subotica buses transport people via nine city, six suburban, and ten interurban, as well as two international lines of bus operations. Per year the buses travel some 4.7 million kilometres, and carry about ten million people.\n\nThe city is served by [[Subotica Airport]]; its runway is too short for airliners, limiting usage to mostly recreational aviation. Southwest of the city there is a 218.5 metres tall guyed mast for FM-/TV-broadcasting. It is the tallest of its kind in Serbia and one of the tallest in the region.\n\n==Famous citizens==\n*[[Branimir Aleksi\u0107]], football player and member of the [[Serbia national football team]]\n*[[Sava Babi\u0107]] (born 1934), writer, translator and university professor\n*[[G\u00e9za Cs\u00e1th]] (1887\u20131919), a tragic physician-writer\n*[[Gyula Cseszneky]] (born 1914), Hungarian, poet, voivode\n*[[Sreten Damjanovi\u0107]] (born 1946), wrestler\n*[[Oliver Duli\u0107]] (born 1975), politician\n*[[Vlatko Duli\u0107]] (born 1943), actor\n*[[Yehuda Elkana]], born 1934.

Before the Iazyge conquest in the 1st century, Indo-European peoples of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]], [[Celts|Celtic]] and [[Dacians|Dacian]] descent inhabited this area. In the 3rd century BC, this area was controlled by Celtic [[Boii]] and [[Eravisci]], while in the 1st century BC, it became part of the [[Dacian kingdom]]. Since the 1st century, the area came under the control of the [[Sarmatian]] [[Iazyges]] (which possibly included [[Serboi]]{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} tribe), who occasionally were allies and occasionally enemies of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]]. Iazyge rule lasted until the 4th century, after which the region came into the possession of various other peoples and states.\n\n===Early Middle Ages and Slavic settlement===\nIn the Early Middle Ages various [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and [[Turkic peoples]] and states ruled in the area of Subotica. These peoples included [[Huns]], [[Gepids]], [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], [[Slavs]] and [[Bulgarians]]. [[Slavs]] settled today's Subotica in the 6th and 7th centuries, before some of them crossed the rivers Sava and Danube and settled in the [[Balkans]].\n\nThe Slavic tribe living in the territory of present-day Subotica were the [[Obotrites]], a subgroup of the [[Serbs]]. In the 9th century, after the fall of the Avar state, the first forms of Slavic statehood emerged in this area. The first Slavic states that ruled over this region included the [[Principality of Lower Pannonia]], [[Great Moravia]] and the [[Bulgarian Empire]].\n\n===Late-Middle Ages===\n{{More citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Tsar Jovan Nenad monument.jpg|[[Emperor Jovan Nenad]] monument in the downtown|thumb|left]]\nSubotica probably first became a settlement of note when people poured into it from nearby villages destroyed during the [[Tatar invasions]] of 1241\u201342. However the settlement has surely been older. It has been established that people inhabited these territories even 3000 years ago.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} When ''Zabadka''/''Zabatka'' was first recorded in 1391, it was a tiny town in the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. Later, the city belonged to the [[Hunyadi family|Hunyadis]], one of the most influential aristocratic families in the whole of [[Central Europe]].\n\nKing [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary]] gave the town to one of his relatives, [[J\u00e1nos Pongr\u00e1c Dengelegi]], who, fearing an invasion by the [[Ottoman Empire]], fortified the castle of Subotica, erecting a fortress in 1470. Some decades later, after the [[Battle of Moh\u00e1cs]] in 1526, Subotica became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The majority of the Hungarian population fled northward to [[Royal Hungary]].{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} [[B\u00e1lint T\u00f6r\u00f6k]], a local noble who had ruled over Subotica, also escaped from the city. During the military and political havoc following the defeat at [[Moh\u00e1cs]], Subotica came under the control of Serbian [[mercenaries]] recruited in [[Banat]]. These soldiers were in the service of the [[Transylvania]]n general [[John Z\u00e1polya|John I Z\u00e1polya]], a later Hungarian king.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe leader of these mercenaries, [[Jovan Nenad]], established in 1526\u201327 his rule in [[Ba\u010dka]], northern [[Banat]] and a small part of [[Syrmia]] and created an independent entity, with Subotica as its administrative centre. At the peak of his power, Jovan Nenad proclaimed himself as Serbian [[tsar]] in Subotica. He named [[Radoslav \u010celnik]] as the general commander of his army, while his treasurer and [[palatine]] was Subota Vrli\u0107, a Serbian noble from [[Jagodina]]. When B\u00e1lint T\u00f6r\u00f6k returned and recaptured Subotica from the Serbs, Jovan Nenad moved the administrative centre to [[Szeged]].<ref>Borovszky Samu: Magyarorsz\u00e1g v\u00e1rmegy\u00e9i \u00e9s v\u00e1rosai, B\u00e1cs-Bodrog v\u00e1rmegye I-II. k\u00f6tet, Apoll\u00f3 Irodalmi \u00e9s Nyomdai R\u00e9szv\u00e9nyt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g, 1909.</ref>\n\nSome months later, in the summer of 1527, Jovan Nenad was [[assassinated]] and his entity collapsed.

At the end of this almost 150-year-long period, not much remained of the old town of ''Zabadka''/''Zabatka''. As much of the population had fled, the Ottomans encouraged the settlement of the area by different colonists from the [[Balkans]]. The settlers were mostly [[Serbian Orthodox|Orthodox]] [[Serbs]]. They cultivated the extremely fertile land around Subotica. In 1570, the population of Subotica numbered 49 houses, and in 1590, 63 houses. In 1687, the region was settled by [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] ''[[Dalmatia|Dalmatas]]'' (called [[Bunjevci]] today). It was called ''Sobotka'' under Ottoman rule and was a kaza centre in [[Sanjak of Segedin|Segedin]] sanjak at first in [[Budin Province, Ottoman Empire|Budin Eyaleti]] until 1596, and after that in [[Egir Province, Ottoman Empire|E\u011fri Eyaleti]] between 1596\u20131686.<ref>[[Sanjak of Segedin]]</ref>\n\n===Habsburg administration===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\nIn 1687, about 5,000 [[Bunjevci]], led by Dujo Markovi\u0107 and \u0110uro Vidakovi\u0107 settled in Ba\u010dka (including Subotica). After the decisive battle against the Ottomans at [[Senta]] led by [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] on 11 September 1697, Subotica became part of the [[Military Frontier|military border]] zone [[Potisje|Theiss]]-[[Pomori\u0161je|Mieresch]] established by the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. In the meantime the uprising of [[Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi]] broke out, which is also known as the [[Kuruc War]].\n\nIn the region of Subotica, R\u00e1k\u00f3czi joined battle against the ''Rac National Militia''. ''[[R\u00e1c (ethnonym)|R\u00e1c]]'' was a designation for the South Slavic people (mostly Serbs and Bunjevci) and they often were referred to as ''r\u00e1cok'' in the Kingdom of Hungary. In a later period ''r\u00e1cok'' came to mean, above all, Serbs of Orthodox religion.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\nThe Serbian military families enjoyed several privileges thanks to their service for the Habsburg Monarchy. Subotica gradually, however, developed from being a mere garrison town to becoming a market town with its own civil charter in 1743. When this happened, many Serbs complained about the loss of their privileges. The majority left the town in protest and some of them founded a new settlement just outside 18th century Subotica in [[Aleksandrovo, Subotica|Aleksandrovo]], while others emigrated to [[Russia]]. In [[New Serbia (historical province)|New Serbia]], a new Russian province established for them, those Serbs founded a new settlement and also named it ''Subotica''. In 1775, a Jewish community in Subotica was established.\n\nIt was perhaps to emphasise the new civic serenity of Subotica that the pious name ''[[Saint Mary]]'' came to be used for it at this time. Some decades later, in 1779, Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] advanced the town's status further by proclaiming it a Free Royal Town. The enthusiastic inhabitants of the city renamed Subotica once more as ''Maria-Theresiopolis''.\n\nThis Free Royal Town status gave a great impetus to the development of the city. During the 19th century its population doubled twice, attracting many people from all over the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. This led eventually to a considerable demographic change. In the first half of the 19th century, the Bunjevci had still been in the majority, but there was an increasing number of Hungarians and Jews settling in Subotica. This process was not stopped even by the outbreak of the [[Revolutions of 1848|Revolutions in the Habsburg Monarchy (1848-49)]].\n\n===1848/1849 Revolutions===\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}\n[[File:Szabadka_1.jpg|thumb|left|Subotica (Szabadka) in 1914 Hungarian postcard]]\nDuring the 1848-49 revolution, the proclaimed borders of autonomous [[Serbian Vojvodina]] included Subotica, but Serb troops could not establish control in the region. On 5 March 1849, at the locality named Kaponja (between Tavankut and Bajmok), there was a battle between the Serb and Hungarian armies, which was won by the Hungarians.\n\nThe first newspaper in the town was also published during the 1848/49 revolution\u2014it was called ''Honunk \u00e1llapota'' (\"State of Our Homeland\") and was published in Hungarian by K\u00e1roly Bitterman's local printing company. Unlike most Serbs and Croats who confronted the Hungarians, part of the local Bunjevci people supported the Hungarian revolution.\n\nIn 1849, after the [[Hungarian revolution of 1848]] was defeated by the Russian and Habsburg armies, the town was separated from the Kingdom of Hungary together with most of the Ba\u010dka region, and became part of a separate Habsburg province, called [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]]. The administrative centre of this new province was [[Timi\u015foara]]. The province existed until 1860. During the existence of the voivodeship, in 1853, Subotica acquired its impressive theatre.\n\n===Hungarian administration===\nAfter the establishment of the [[Ausgleich|Dual-Monarchy]] in 1867, there followed what is often called the \"golden age\" of city development of Subotica. Many schools were opened after 1867 and in 1869 the railway connected the city to the world. In 1896 an electrical power plant was built, further enhancing the development of the city and the whole region. Subotica now adorned itself with its remarkable Central European, [[fin de si\u00e8cle]] architecture. In 1902 a Jewish synagogue was built in the [[Art Nouveau]] style.\n\nBetween 1849 and 1860 it was part of the [[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enciklopedija.hr/natuknica.aspx?ID=58589|title=Subotica {{!}} Hrvatska enciklopedija|website=www.enciklopedija.hr|access-date=2019-05-04}}</ref>\n\n===Yugoslavia and Serbia===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}\n[[File:Le\u0161evi na Sen\u0107anskom putu.jpg|left|thumb|Hungarian occupation troops massacred [[Serbia]]n and [[Jews|Jewish]] civilians during the occupation (1941-1944)]]\nSubotica was part of [[Austria-Hungary]] until the aftermath of [[World War I]] in 1918, when the city became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. In changed economic and political circumstances, Subotica was now a border-town in [[Yugoslavia]] and did not, for a time, experience again the dynamic prosperity it enjoyed in the years preceding World War I. However, at that time, Subotica was the third largest city in Yugoslavia by population, following [[Belgrade]] and [[Zagreb]].\n\nIn 1941, Yugoslavia was invaded and partitioned by the [[Axis Powers]], and its northern parts, including Subotica, were [[Hungarian occupation of Yugoslav territories|annexed by Hungary]] (This partition of Yugoslavia was not recognized by the international community and city was, from the legal point of view, still part of Yugoslavia, whose only legal representative was the Yugoslav government in exile). Hungarian troops entered Subotica on 11 April 1941.\n\nAs the majority of people living in the city were ethnic Hungarians and the city had been part of Hungary for over 600 years, Hungary felt it had to protect its people now living outside of its borders. During [[World War II]] the city lost approximately 7,000 of its citizens, mostly Serbs, Hungarians and Jews. Before the war about 6,000 [[Jews]] lived in Subotica; many of these were deported from the city during the [[Holocaust]], mostly to [[Auschwitz]].\n\nIn April 1944, a ghetto was set up. In addition, many [[communists]] were put to death during Axis rule. In 1944, the Axis forces left the city, and Subotica became part of the new [[Yugoslavia]]. During the 1944\u201345 period, about 8,000 citizens (mainly Hungarian) were killed by [[Yugoslav partisans|Partisans]] while re-taking the city as retribution for supporting Axis Hungary.<ref>M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros S\u00e1ndor: Holtt\u00e1 nyilv\u00e1n\u00edtva - D\u00e9lvid\u00e9ki magyar f\u00e1tum 1944\u201345, I-II, Hatodik S\u00edp Alap\u00edtv\u00e1ny, Budapest 1995.</ref><ref>Cseres Tibor: V\u00e9rbossz\u00fa B\u00e1csk\u00e1ban, Magvet\u0151 kiad\u00f3, Budapest 1991.<!-- ISSN/ISBN needed, if any --></ref>\n\nIn the post-war period, Subotica has gradually been modernised.

Due to the surrounding farmlands Subotica has famous food producer industries in the country, including such brands as the confectionery factory \"Pionir\", \"Fidelinka\" the cereal manufacturer, \"[[Mlekara Subotica]]\" a milk producer and \"Simex\" producer of strong alcohol drinks.\n\nThere are a number of old socialistic industries that survived the transition period in Serbia.

The Subotica tram, put into operation in 1897, ran on electricity from the start. While neighbouring cities' trams at this date were often still horse-drawn, this gave the Subotica system an advantage over other municipalities including Belgrade, Novi Sad, Zagreb, and Szeged. Its existence was important for the citizens of Subotica, as well as tourists who came to visit.\nSubotica has since developed a bus system. The Subotica buses transport people via nine city, six suburban, and ten interurban, as well as two international lines of bus operations. Per year the buses travel some 4.7 million kilometres, and carry about ten million people.\n\nThe city is served by [[Subotica Airport]]; its runway is too short for airliners, limiting usage to mostly recreational aviation.

The plot follows Vasco da Gama (Thala) and his gang of friends, all unemployed and leading a happy-go-lucky life.\n\nThe film released on 6 April 2007 opened to positive reviews.\n\n==Plot==\n{{More plot|date=July 2019}}\nThe film starts in a street in [[Fort Kochi]] where Vasco da Gama, the son of a wrestler named Michael, lives. Vasco and his gang of five \u2013 Chandrappan, Susheelan, Sainu, Basheer and cousin Tomichchan are small-time goondas, involved in petty offences and as the movie progresses, these characters turn out to be more endearing than bad.\n\nVasco goes by the nickname Thala (head) since he is the gang leader. Though Michael rebukes his son time and again for his lifestyle choices, he loves him and has big dreams for him. The plot progresses when a marriage broker contracts a wedding between Vasco and auto-rickshaw driver Latha, the only daughter of Pambu Chakochan who is a heavy drinker and a longtime friend of Michael.\n\nVasco likes Latha, but she pleads with him to tell her father that he does not like her, because she plans to elope with her boyfriend. Overjoyed at having discovered a fellow drinker in Vasco, Chakochan does not even let him voice his opinion. Vasco decides to help Latha out, but her plan to elope fails when she discovers that her boyfriend Suni is involved in human trafficking. She returns to Vasco.\n\nLater when Vasco, Michael, Chandrappan and Latha travel in her auto-rickshaw, they clash with a gang that has been on the run after stabbing an honest police officer. Vasco and his father were witnesses to the murder which was committed by Satheesan who is the younger brother of a corrupt circle inspector called Nadesan.

Vasco and his gang of five \u2013 Chandrappan, Susheelan, Sainu, Basheer and cousin Tomichchan are small-time goondas, involved in petty offences and as the movie progresses, these characters turn out to be more endearing than bad.\n\nVasco goes by the nickname Thala (head) since he is the gang leader. Though Michael rebukes his son time and again for his lifestyle choices, he loves him and has big dreams for him. The plot progresses when a marriage broker contracts a wedding between Vasco and auto-rickshaw driver Latha, the only daughter of Pambu Chakochan who is a heavy drinker and a longtime friend of Michael.\n\nVasco likes Latha, but she pleads with him to tell her father that he does not like her, because she plans to elope with her boyfriend. Overjoyed at having discovered a fellow drinker in Vasco, Chakochan does not even let him voice his opinion. Vasco decides to help Latha out, but her plan to elope fails when she discovers that her boyfriend Suni is involved in human trafficking. She returns to Vasco.\n\nLater when Vasco, Michael, Chandrappan and Latha travel in her auto-rickshaw, they clash with a gang that has been on the run after stabbing an honest police officer. Vasco and his father were witnesses to the murder which was committed by Satheesan who is the younger brother of a corrupt circle inspector called Nadesan. This leads to complications.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Mohanlal]] as Vasco da Gama a.k.a Thala\n* [[Saikumar (actor)|Saikumar]] as Fayalwan Michael Ashan, Thala's father\n* [[Siddhique]] as Mullan Chandrappan, Thala's sidekick\n* [[Kalabhavan Mani]] as Nadeshan, Circle Inspector of Police\n* [[Jagathy Sreekumar]] as Padakkam Basheer, Thala's friend and another goon\n* [[Bhavana (actress)|Bhavana]] as Latha, Thala's love interest\n* [[Indrajith Sukumaran]] as Tomichan, Thala's cousin and sidekick\n* [[Manikuttan]] as Sainu, Thala's sidekick\n* [[Bijukuttan]] as Susheelan, Thala's sidekick\n* [[Rajan P.

This phenomenon is most common in the northern countries of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Because December is at the beginning of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] summer, White Christmases there are extremely rare, except in [[Antarctica]], in the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]] of [[New Zealand]]'s [[South Island]], and in parts of [[Andes|the Andes]] in South America as well as the southern tip of the continent, in places like [[Ushuaia, Argentina]]. The song, \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\", written by [[Irving Berlin]] and sung by [[Bing Crosby]] (with the Ken Darby singers and John Scott Trotter and his orchestra) and featured in the 1942 [[Paramount Pictures]] film [[Holiday Inn (film)|''Holiday Inn'']], is the best-selling single of all time and speaks nostalgically of a traditional white Christmas and has since became a seasonal standard. The opposite of a white Christmas, when there is no snow and thus the ground is bare, is traditionally known as a \"green Christmas,\" from the color of bare grass.\n\n==Definition==\nThe criteria for a \"white Christmas\" varies. In most countries, it simply means that the ground is covered by snow at Christmas, but some countries have more strict definitions. In the United States, the official definition of a white Christmas is that there has to be a snow depth of at least {{convert|1|in|cm|disp=or|abbr=on}} at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. local time on Christmas morning,<ref name=\"ncdc\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/extremes/christmas.html |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |work=[[National Climatic Data Center]] |title=White Christmas? |date=20 August 2008 |accessdate=2010-12-25 }}</ref> and in Canada the official definition is that there has to be more than {{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}} on the ground on Christmas Day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/12/24/science-white-christmas.html |title=Chances vary for a white Christmas |work=[[CBC News]] |date=24 December 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-25 }}</ref> In the United Kingdom, although for many a white Christmas simply means a complete covering of snow on Christmas Day, the official definition by the British [[Met Office]] and British [[bookmaker]]s is for snow to be observed falling, however little (even if it melts before it reaches the ground), in the 24 hours of 25 December.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/whitechristmas/index.html |title=Will it be a white Christmas? |publisher=Met Office |date=5 April 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.williamhillmedia.com/index_template.asp?file=5011 |title=William Hill press release: \"\u00a31 Million Riding On A Flake Of Snow!\" |accessdate=2010-12-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013093833/http://williamhillmedia.com/index_template.asp?file=5011 |archivedate=13 October 2007 }}</ref> Consequently, according to the Met Office and British bookmakers, even {{convert|3|ft|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} of snow on the ground at Christmas, because of a heavy snow fall a few days before, will not constitute a white Christmas, but a few snowflakes mixed with rain will, even if they never reach the ground.

In general, due to the influence of the warm [[Gulf Stream]] on European climate, chances of a white Christmas are lower farther west. For example, in southern France a white Christmas is rare, while in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], which is at a similar latitude, it is much more likely. Northern Italy and the mountain regions of central-south Italy may also have a white Christmas. In cities such as Turin, Milan or Bologna a Christmas with falling snow or snow on the ground is not a rarity. White Christmases are also common in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], as well as the [[Alps]].\n\n==Southern Hemisphere==\nBecause Christmas occurs during the summer in the Southern Hemisphere, white Christmases are especially rare events there, apart from [[Antarctica]], which is generally uninhabited. A white Christmas elsewhere in the Southern Hemisphere is approximately equivalent to having snow in the Northern Hemisphere on 25 June. Some places like [[Ushuaia]] and [[Stanley, Falkland Islands]] have received measurable snowfall on Christmas Day on numerous occasions.\n\nIn 2006, a snowstorm hit the [[Snowy Mountains]] in [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], arriving on Christmas morning and bringing nearly {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow in higher areas.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-12-25/aussies-celebrate-white-christmas/2161238 |title=Aussies celebrate white Christmas. 25 December 2006. |work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]] |date=25 December 2006 |accessdate=2013-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn New Zealand's [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]], snow can fall any day of the year, and a white Christmas is possible.

This phenomenon is most common in the northern countries of the [[Northern Hemisphere]]. Because December is at the beginning of the [[Southern Hemisphere]] summer, White Christmases there are extremely rare, except in [[Antarctica]], in the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]] of [[New Zealand]]'s [[South Island]], and in parts of [[Andes|the Andes]] in South America as well as the southern tip of the continent, in places like [[Ushuaia, Argentina]]. The song, \"[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]\", written by [[Irving Berlin]] and sung by [[Bing Crosby]] (with the Ken Darby singers and John Scott Trotter and his orchestra) and featured in the 1942 [[Paramount Pictures]] film [[Holiday Inn (film)|''Holiday Inn'']], is the best-selling single of all time and speaks nostalgically of a traditional white Christmas and has since became a seasonal standard. The opposite of a white Christmas, when there is no snow and thus the ground is bare, is traditionally known as a \"green Christmas,\" from the color of bare grass.\n\n==Definition==\nThe criteria for a \"white Christmas\" varies. In most countries, it simply means that the ground is covered by snow at Christmas, but some countries have more strict definitions. In the United States, the official definition of a white Christmas is that there has to be a snow depth of at least {{convert|1|in|cm|disp=or|abbr=on}} at 7:00&nbsp;a.m. local time on Christmas morning,<ref name=\"ncdc\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/extremes/christmas.html |publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] |work=[[National Climatic Data Center]] |title=White Christmas? |date=20 August 2008 |accessdate=2010-12-25 }}</ref> and in Canada the official definition is that there has to be more than {{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on}} on the ground on Christmas Day.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2010/12/24/science-white-christmas.html |title=Chances vary for a white Christmas |work=[[CBC News]] |date=24 December 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-25 }}</ref> In the United Kingdom, although for many a white Christmas simply means a complete covering of snow on Christmas Day, the official definition by the British [[Met Office]] and British [[bookmaker]]s is for snow to be observed falling, however little (even if it melts before it reaches the ground), in the 24 hours of 25 December.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/whitechristmas/index.html |title=Will it be a white Christmas? |publisher=Met Office |date=5 April 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.williamhillmedia.com/index_template.asp?file=5011 |title=William Hill press release: \"\u00a31 Million Riding On A Flake Of Snow!\" |accessdate=2010-12-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013093833/http://williamhillmedia.com/index_template.asp?file=5011 |archivedate=13 October 2007 }}</ref> Consequently, according to the Met Office and British bookmakers, even {{convert|3|ft|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} of snow on the ground at Christmas, because of a heavy snow fall a few days before, will not constitute a white Christmas, but a few snowflakes mixed with rain will, even if they never reach the ground.

The 2004 storm also brought the first measurable snow of any kind since 1895 to [[Brownsville, Texas]], and its [[Twin towns and sister cities|twin city]] of [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], [[Mexico]].

[[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] peoples first settled in the territory of present-day Vojvodina in 3200 BC. During the [[Eneolithic]] period, the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]], several Indo-European archaeological cultures were centered in or around Vojvodina, including the [[Vu\u010dedol culture]], the [[Vatin culture]], and the [[Bosut culture]], among others.\n\nBefore the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC, Indo-European peoples of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]], [[Thracian]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] origin inhabited this area. The first states organized in this area were the Celtic [[Scordisci|State of the Scordisci]] (3rd century BC-1st century AD) with capital in [[Singidunum]] ([[Belgrade]]), and the [[Dacian Kingdom]] of [[Burebista]] (1st century BC).\n\nDuring Roman rule, [[Sirmium]] (modern [[Sremska Mitrovica]]) was one of the four capital cities of the [[Roman Empire]], and six [[Roman Emperors]] were born in this city or in its surroundings. The city was also the capital of several Roman administrative units, including [[Pannonia Inferior]], [[Pannonia Secunda]], the [[Diocese of Pannonia]], and the [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]].\n\nRoman rule lasted until the 5th century, after which the region came into the possession of various peoples and states. While [[Banat]] was a part of the Roman province of [[Dacia]], [[Syrmia]] belonged to the Roman province of [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia]]. [[Ba\u010dka]] was not part of the Roman Empire and was populated and ruled by Sarmatian [[Iazyges]].\n\n===Early Middle Ages and Slavic settlement===\nAfter the Romans were driven away from this region, various Indo-European and Turkic peoples and states ruled in the area. These peoples included Goths, Sarmatians, Huns, Gepids and Avars. For regional history, the largest in importance was a Gepid state, which had its capital in Sirmium. According to the 7th-century ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'', [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] gave the region of Syrmia to a Bulgar leader named [[Kuber]] circa 680. The Bulgars of Kuber moved south with Maurus to Macedonia where they co-operated with [[Tervel]] in the 8th century.\n[[File:Ara\u010da 5.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of [[Ara\u010da]] church]]\n[[Slavs]] settled today's Vojvodina in the 6th and 7th centuries,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Vojvodina/997/Slovenski-grobovi-uz-reku-Galadsku|title=Slovenski grobovi uz reku Galadsku|publisher=Blic.rs|accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> before some of them crossed the rivers Sava and Danube and settled in the Balkans. Slavic tribes that lived in the territory of present-day Vojvodina included Abodrites, Severans, Brani\u010devci and Timo\u010dani.\n\nIn the 9th century, after the fall of the Avar state, the first forms of Slavic statehood emerged in this area. The first Slavic states that ruled over this region included the Bulgarian Empire, [[Great Moravia]] and Ljudevit's Pannonian Duchy. During the Bulgarian administration (9th century), local Bulgarian dukes, [[Salan]] and [[Glad (duke)|Glad]], ruled over the region. Salan's residence was Titel, while that of Glad was possibly in the rumoured rampart of Galad or perhaps in the Kladovo (Gladovo) in eastern Serbia. Glad's descendant was the duke Ahtum, another local ruler from the 11th century who opposed the establishment of Hungarian rule over the region.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn the village of [[\u010celarevo]] archaeologists have also found traces of people who practised the Judaic religion. Bunard\u017ei\u0107 dated Avar-Bulgar graves excavated in \u010celarevo, containing skulls with Mongolian features and Judaic symbols, to the late 8th and 9th centuries. Erdely and Vilkhnovich consider the graves to belong to the [[Kabars]] who eventually broke ties with the Khazar Empire between the 830s and 862. (Three other [[Khazar]] tribes joined the [[Magyars]] and took part in the Magyar conquest of the Carpathian basin including what is now Vojvodina in 895\u2013907.){{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Hungarian rule===\n[[File:\u0411\u0410\u0427,\u0412\u041e\u0408\u0412\u041e\u0414\u0418\u041d\u0410,\u0421\u0420\u0411\u0418\u0408\u0410..,,.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ba\u010d Fortress]]]]\nFollowing territorial disputes with Byzantine and Bulgarian states, most of Vojvodina became part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] between 10th and 12th century and remained under Hungarian administration until the 16th century (Following periods of Ottoman and Habsburg administrations, Hungarian political dominance over most of the region was established again in 1867 and over entire region in 1882, after abolition of the Habsburg Military Frontier).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe regional demographic balance started changing in the 11th century when Magyars began to replace the local Slavic population.

In 1526 [[Emperor Jovan Nenad|Jovan Nenad]], a leader of Serb mercenaries, established his rule in [[Ba\u010dka]], northern [[Banat]] and a small part of [[Syrmia]]. He created an ephemeral independent state, with [[Subotica]] as its capital.\n\nAt the peak of his power, Jovan Nenad proclaimed himself Serbian Emperor in Subotica. Taking advantage of the extremely confused military and political situation, the Hungarian noblemen from the region joined forces against him and defeated the Serbian troops in the summer of 1527. Emperor Jovan Nenad was assassinated and his state collapsed. After the fall of emperor's state, the supreme military commander of Jovan Nenad's army, [[Radoslav \u010celnik]], established his own temporary state in the region of Syrmia, where he ruled as Ottoman vassal.\n\nA few decades later, the whole region was added to the [[Ottoman Empire]], which ruled over it until the end of the 17th and the first half of the 18th century, when it was incorporated into the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. The [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] of 1699, between [[Great Turkish War|Holy League]] and [[Ottoman Empire]], marked the withdrawal of the Ottoman forces from [[Central Europe]], and the supremacy of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in that part of the continent. According to the treaty, the western part of Vojvodina passed to Habsburgs. The eastern part (eastern Syrmia and [[Teme\u015fvar Province, Ottoman Empire|Province of Tam\u0131\u015fvar]]) remained in Ottoman hands until Austrian conquest in 1716. This new border change was ratified by the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] in 1718.\n\n===Habsburg rule===\n\n====Hungarian Crown land (1699\u20131849)====\n[[File:Blagovestenski sabor 1861.jpg|thumb|right|Blagove\u0161tenski assembly in Sremski Karlovci, 1861]]\nDuring the [[Great Serb Migrations|Great Serb Migration]], Serbs from Ottoman territories settled in the Habsburg Monarchy at the end of the 17th century (in 1690), most of whom settled what is now Hungary, the lesser part settling in western Vojvodina. Therefore, all Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy gained the status of a recognized nation with extensive rights, in exchange for providing a border militia (in the [[Military Frontier]]) that could be mobilized against invaders from the south, as well as in case of civil unrest in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAt the beginning of Habsburg rule, most of the region was integrated into the Military Frontier, while western parts of Ba\u010dka were put under civil administration within the County of Ba\u010d. Later, the civil administration was expanded to other (mostly northern) parts of the region, while southern parts remained under military administration. The eastern part of it was held by the Ottomans between 1787\u201388, during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787\u20131792)|Russo-Turkish War]]. In 1716, [[Vienna]] temporarily forbade settlement by Hungarians and Jews in the area, while large numbers of German speakers were settled in the region. From 1782, [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Hungarians and [[ethnic Germans]] settled in larger numbers.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[File:Serbia and Vojvodina 1848.png|thumb|left|Proclaimed borders of Serbian Vojvodina at the May Assembly (1848) and autonomous Ottoman [[Principality of Serbia]]]]\nDuring the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848\u201349 revolutions]], Vojvodina was a site of war between Serbs and Hungarians, due to the opposite national conceptions of these two peoples. At the [[May Assembly]] in [[Sremski Karlovci]] (13\u201315 May 1848), Serbs declared the constitution of the ''[[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbian Voivodship]]'' (''Serbian Duchy''), a Serbian autonomous region within the [[Austrian Empire]]. The Serbian Voivodship consisted of Srem, Ba\u010dka, Banat, and [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe head of the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci|metropolitanate of Sremski Karlovci]], [[Josif Raja\u010di\u0107]], was elected [[Patriarchate of Karlovci|patriarch]], while [[Stevan \u0160upljikac]] was chosen as first [[Voivode|voivod]] (duke). The ethnic war hit this area perhaps the hardest, with terrible atrocities committed against the civilian populations by both sides.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n====Austrian Crown land (1849\u20131860)====\n\nFollowing the Habsburg-Russian and Serb victory over the Hungarians in 1849, a new administrative territory was created in the region in November 1849, in accordance with a decision made by the [[Austrian emperor]]. By this decision, the Serbian autonomous region created in 1848 was transformed into the new Austrian [[crown land]] known as '''[[Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar]]'''. It consisted of Banat, Ba\u010dka and Srem, excluding the southern parts of these regions which were part of the Military Frontier.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAn Austrian governor seated in [[Timi\u0219oara|Temeschwar]] ruled the area, while the title of Voivod belonged to the [[Austrian Emperor|emperor]] himself.

Instead of the previous name (Danube Banovina), the region regained its historical name of Vojvodina, while its capital city remained Novi Sad.

Under the 1974 Yugoslav constitution, it gained extensive rights of self-rule, as both Kosovo and Vojvodina were given ''de facto'' veto power in the Serbian and Yugoslav parliaments. Changes to their status could not be made without the consent of the two Provincial Assemblies.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe 1974 Serbian constitution, adopted at the same time, reiterated that \"the Socialist Republic of Serbia comprises the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina]] and the [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], which originated in the common struggle of nations and nationalities of Yugoslavia in the National Liberation War (the Second World War) and socialist revolution\".{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nUnder the rule of Serbian president [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], a series of protests against Vojvodina's party leadership took place during the summer and autumn of 1988, which forced it to resign. Eventually Vojvodina and Kosovo had to accept Serbia's constitutional amendments that practically dismissed the autonomy of the provinces in Serbia. Vojvodina and Kosovo lost elements of statehood in September 1990 when the new constitution of the Republic of Serbia was adopted.\n\nVojvodina was still referred to as an autonomous province of Serbia, but most of its autonomous powers \u2013 including, crucially, its vote on the Yugoslav collective presidency \u2013 were transferred to the control of Belgrade, the capital.

Monthly and weekly publications in minority languages include ''[[Hrvatska rije\u010d]]'' (\"Croatian Word\") in Croatian, ''[[Hlas \u013dudu]]'' (\"The Voice of the People\") in Slovak, ''[[Libertatea (Vojvodina)|Libertatea]]'' (\"Freedom\") in Romanian, and ''[[Ruske slovo|\u0420\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e]]'' (\"Rusyn Word\") in Rusyn. There is also ''[[Bunjeva\u010dke novine]]'' (\"The Bunjevac newspaper\") in Bunjevac.\n\nPublic Broadcasting Service of Vojvodina was founded in 1974 as Radio Television of Novi Sad, as an equal member of the association of JRT \u2013 Yugoslav Radio Television. Radio Novi Sad's first broadcast was on November 29, 1949. During the NATO bombing in the spring of 1999, the RT Novi Sad building of 20 thousand square meters was completely destroyed along with its basic production and technical premises . The Venac terrestrial broadcasting site was heavily damaged.\n\nThe Radio-Television of Vojvodina produces and broadcasts regional programming on two channels, RTV1 (Serbian language) and RTV2 (minority languages), and three radio frequencies: Radio Novi Sad 1 (Serbian), Radio Novi Sad 2 (Hungarian), Radio Novi Sad 3 (other minority communities).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtv.rs/sr_lat/about-us|title=About Us|publisher=Radio-Television of Vojvodina|accessdate=22 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Serbia Vojka from southwest IMG 9207.JPG|thumb|right|Vojvodina is known as ''Serbia's breadbasket'']]\nThe economy of Vojvodina is largely based on developed food industry and fertile agricultural soil. Agriculture is a priority sector in Vojvodina. Traditionally, it has always been a significant part of the local economy and a generator of positive results, due to the abundance of fertile agricultural land which makes up 84% of its territory. The share of agribusiness in the total industrial production is 40%, that is 30% in the total exports of Vojvodina.\n\nThe metal industry of Vojvodina has a long tradition and consists of smaller metal processing companies for components manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, of original equipment manufacturers (OEM) with their own brand name products. Vojvodina Metal Cluster gathers 116 companies with 6,300 employees. Other branches of industry are also developed such as the chemical industry, electrical industry, oil industry and construction industry. In the past decade, ICT sector has been growing rapidly and has taken significant role in Vojvodina's economic development.\n\nHigh- tech sector is a fast-growing sector in Vojvodina. Software development represents the main source of revenue, particularly development of ERP solutions, Java applications and mobile applications. IT sector companies mainly deal with software outsourcing, based on demands of international clients or with development of their own software products for purposes of domestic and international market.\nVojvodina pays particular attention to interregional and cross-border economic cooperation, as well as to implementation of priorities defined within the EU Strategy for the Danube Region.<ref name=\"vojvodina.gov.rs\"/>\n\nSome of the companies from Vojvodina:\n*[[Naftna Industrija Srbije]]\n*[[Srbijagas]]\n*[[HIP Petrohemija]]\n*[[Apatin Brewery]]\n*[[Novi Sad Fair|Novosadski sajam]]\n\nVojvodina promotes its investment potentials through the [[Vojvodina Investment Promotion]] (VIP) agency, which was founded by the Parliament of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina.\n\n===Transport===\nThere are many important roads which pass through Vojvodina. First of all, the motorway [[A1 (Serbia)|A1 motorway]] which goes from Central Europe and the Horgos border crossing to Hungary, via Novi Sad to Belgrade and further to the southeast toward Ni\u0161, where it branches: one way leads east to the border with Bulgaria; the other to the south, towards Greece. Motorway [[A3 (Serbia)|A3]] in Srem separates the west, towards the neighboring Croatia and further to Western Europe. There is also a network of regional and local roads and railway lines.\n\nThe three largest rivers in Vojvodina are navigable stream. Danube River with a length of 588 kilometers and its tributaries Tisa (168&nbsp;km), Sava (206&nbsp;km) and Bega (75&nbsp;km). Among them was dug extensive network of irrigation canals, drainage and transport, with a total length of {{cvt|939|km}}, of which {{cvt|673|km}} navigable.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Vojvodina}}\nTourist destinations in Vojvodina include well known [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] monasteries on [[Fru\u0161ka Gora]] mountain, numerous hunting grounds, cultural-historical monuments, different folklores, interesting galleries and museums, plain landscapes with a lot of greenery, big rivers, canals and lakes, sandy terrain [[Deliblatska Pe\u0161\u010dara]] (\"the

It derives from the word ''\"vojvoda\"'' (See: [[voivode]]) which stems from the [[Proto-Slavic|Proto-Slavic language]] word ''\"voevoda\"''. Those words are etymologically connected with modern-day words ''\"vojnik\"'' ([[soldier]]) and ''\"voditi\"'' (to lead). Its original name (from 1848) was the \"[[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbian Voivodeship]]\" which then became \"[[Voivodeship of Serbia and Temes Banat|Voivodeship of Serbia]]\".\n\nThe full official names of the province in all official languages of Vojvodina are:\n* [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: \u0410\u0443\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0458\u0438\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u043e\u0458\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 / ''Autonomna Pokrajina Vojvodina''\n* [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: ''Vajdas\u00e1g Auton\u00f3m Tartom\u00e1ny''\n* [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''Auton\u00f3mna pokrajina Vojvodina''\n* [[Romanian language|Romanian]]: ''Provincia Autonom\u0103 Voivodina''\n* [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Autonomna Pokrajina Vojvodina''\n* [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Pannonian Rusyn]]: \u0410\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043d\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0430 \u0412\u043e\u0439\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 (''Avtonomna Pokrajina Vojvodina'')\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of Vojvodina}}\n{{more citations needed|section|date=March 2018}}\n{{Summarize section|date=February 2012}}\n\n===Pre-Roman times and Roman rule===\nIn the Neolithic period, two important archaeological cultures flourished in this area: the [[Star\u010devo culture]] and the [[Vin\u010da culture]]. [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] peoples first settled in the territory of present-day Vojvodina in 3200 BC. During the [[Eneolithic]] period, the [[Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age]], several Indo-European archaeological cultures were centered in or around Vojvodina, including the [[Vu\u010dedol culture]], the [[Vatin culture]], and the [[Bosut culture]], among others.\n\nBefore the Roman conquest in the 1st century BC, Indo-European peoples of [[Illyrians|Illyrian]], [[Thracian]] and [[Celts|Celtic]] origin inhabited this area. The first states organized in this area were the Celtic [[Scordisci|State of the Scordisci]] (3rd century BC-1st century AD) with capital in [[Singidunum]] ([[Belgrade]]), and the [[Dacian Kingdom]] of [[Burebista]] (1st century BC).\n\nDuring Roman rule, [[Sirmium]] (modern [[Sremska Mitrovica]]) was one of the four capital cities of the [[Roman Empire]], and six [[Roman Emperors]] were born in this city or in its surroundings. The city was also the capital of several Roman administrative units, including [[Pannonia Inferior]], [[Pannonia Secunda]], the [[Diocese of Pannonia]], and the [[Praetorian prefecture of Illyricum]].\n\nRoman rule lasted until the 5th century, after which the region came into the possession of various peoples and states. While [[Banat]] was a part of the Roman province of [[Dacia]], [[Syrmia]] belonged to the Roman province of [[Pannonia (Roman province)|Pannonia]]. [[Ba\u010dka]] was not part of the Roman Empire and was populated and ruled by Sarmatian [[Iazyges]].\n\n===Early Middle Ages and Slavic settlement===\nAfter the Romans were driven away from this region, various Indo-European and Turkic peoples and states ruled in the area. These peoples included Goths, Sarmatians, Huns, Gepids and Avars. For regional history, the largest in importance was a Gepid state, which had its capital in Sirmium. According to the 7th-century ''[[Miracles of Saint Demetrius]]'', [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] gave the region of Syrmia to a Bulgar leader named [[Kuber]] circa 680. The Bulgars of Kuber moved south with Maurus to Macedonia where they co-operated with [[Tervel]] in the 8th century.\n[[File:Ara\u010da 5.jpg|thumb|left|Ruins of [[Ara\u010da]] church]]\n[[Slavs]] settled today's Vojvodina in the 6th and 7th centuries,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Vojvodina/997/Slovenski-grobovi-uz-reku-Galadsku|title=Slovenski grobovi uz reku Galadsku|publisher=Blic.rs|accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> before some of them crossed the rivers Sava and Danube and settled in the Balkans. Slavic tribes that lived in the territory of present-day Vojvodina included Abodrites, Severans, Brani\u010devci and Timo\u010dani.\n\nIn the 9th century, after the fall of the Avar state, the first forms of Slavic statehood emerged in this area. The first Slavic states that ruled over this region included the Bulgarian Empire, [[Great Moravia]] and Ljudevit's Pannonian Duchy. During the Bulgarian administration (9th century), local Bulgarian dukes, [[Salan]] and [[Glad (duke)|Glad]], ruled over the region. Salan's residence was Titel, while that of Glad was possibly in the rumoured rampart of Galad or perhaps in the Kladovo (Gladovo) in eastern Serbia. Glad's descendant was the duke Ahtum, another local ruler from the 11th century who opposed the establishment of Hungarian rule over the region.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nIn the village of [[\u010celarevo]] archaeologists have also found traces of people who practised the Judaic religion. Bunard\u017ei\u0107 dated Avar-Bulgar graves excavated in \u010celarevo, containing skulls with Mongolian features and Judaic symbols, to the late 8th and 9th centuries. Erdely and Vilkhnovich consider the graves to belong to the [[Kabars]] who eventually broke ties with the Khazar Empire between the 830s and 862. (Three other [[Khazar]] tribes joined the [[Magyars]] and took part in the Magyar conquest of the Carpathian basin including what is now Vojvodina in 895\u2013907.){{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Hungarian rule===\n[[File:\u0411\u0410\u0427,\u0412\u041e\u0408\u0412\u041e\u0414\u0418\u041d\u0410,\u0421\u0420\u0411\u0418\u0408\u0410..,,.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ba\u010d Fortress]]]]\nFollowing territorial disputes with Byzantine and Bulgarian states, most of Vojvodina became part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] between 10th and 12th century and remained under Hungarian administration until the 16th century (Following periods of Ottoman and Habsburg administrations, Hungarian political dominance over most of the region was established again in 1867 and over entire region in 1882, after abolition of the Habsburg Military Frontier).{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe regional demographic balance started changing in the 11th century when Magyars began to replace the local Slavic population. But from the 14th century, the balance changed again in favour of the Slavs when Serbian refugees fleeing from territories conquered by the Ottoman army settled in the area.

In 1526 [[Emperor Jovan Nenad|Jovan Nenad]], a leader of Serb mercenaries, established his rule in [[Ba\u010dka]], northern [[Banat]] and a small part of [[Syrmia]]. He created an ephemeral independent state, with [[Subotica]] as its capital.\n\nAt the peak of his power, Jovan Nenad proclaimed himself Serbian Emperor in Subotica. Taking advantage of the extremely confused military and political situation, the Hungarian noblemen from the region joined forces against him and defeated the Serbian troops in the summer of 1527. Emperor Jovan Nenad was assassinated and his state collapsed. After the fall of emperor's state, the supreme military commander of Jovan Nenad's army, [[Radoslav \u010celnik]], established his own temporary state in the region of Syrmia, where he ruled as Ottoman vassal.\n\nA few decades later, the whole region was added to the [[Ottoman Empire]], which ruled over it until the end of the 17th and the first half of the 18th century, when it was incorporated into the [[Habsburg Monarchy]]. The [[Treaty of Karlowitz]] of 1699, between [[Great Turkish War|Holy League]] and [[Ottoman Empire]], marked the withdrawal of the Ottoman forces from [[Central Europe]], and the supremacy of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] in that part of the continent. According to the treaty, the western part of Vojvodina passed to Habsburgs. The eastern part (eastern Syrmia and [[Teme\u015fvar Province, Ottoman Empire|Province of Tam\u0131\u015fvar]]) remained in Ottoman hands until Austrian conquest in 1716. This new border change was ratified by the [[Treaty of Passarowitz]] in 1718.\n\n===Habsburg rule===\n\n====Hungarian Crown land (1699\u20131849)====\n[[File:Blagovestenski sabor 1861.jpg|thumb|right|Blagove\u0161tenski assembly in Sremski Karlovci, 1861]]\nDuring the [[Great Serb Migrations|Great Serb Migration]], Serbs from Ottoman territories settled in the Habsburg Monarchy at the end of the 17th century (in 1690), most of whom settled what is now Hungary, the lesser part settling in western Vojvodina. Therefore, all Serbs in the Habsburg Monarchy gained the status of a recognized nation with extensive rights, in exchange for providing a border militia (in the [[Military Frontier]]) that could be mobilized against invaders from the south, as well as in case of civil unrest in the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nAt the beginning of Habsburg rule, most of the region was integrated into the Military Frontier, while western parts of Ba\u010dka were put under civil administration within the County of Ba\u010d. Later, the civil administration was expanded to other (mostly northern) parts of the region, while southern parts remained under military administration. The eastern part of it was held by the Ottomans between 1787\u201388, during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1787\u20131792)|Russo-Turkish War]]. In 1716, [[Vienna]] temporarily forbade settlement by Hungarians and Jews in the area, while large numbers of German speakers were settled in the region. From 1782, [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Hungarians and [[ethnic Germans]] settled in larger numbers.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n[[File:Serbia and Vojvodina 1848.png|thumb|left|Proclaimed borders of Serbian Vojvodina at the May Assembly (1848) and autonomous Ottoman [[Principality of Serbia]]]]\nDuring the [[Revolutions of 1848|1848\u201349 revolutions]], Vojvodina was a site of war between Serbs and Hungarians, due to the opposite national conceptions of these two peoples. At the [[May Assembly]] in [[Sremski Karlovci]] (13\u201315 May 1848), Serbs declared the constitution of the ''[[Serbian Vojvodina|Serbian Voivodship]]'' (''Serbian Duchy''), a Serbian autonomous region within the [[Austrian Empire]]. The Serbian Voivodship consisted of Srem, Ba\u010dka, Banat, and [[Baranya (region)|Baranja]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe head of the [[Metropolitanate of Karlovci|metropolitanate of Sremski Karlovci]], [[Josif Raja\u010di\u0107]], was elected [[Patriarchate of Karlovci|patriarch]], while [[Stevan \u0160upljikac]] was chosen as first [[Voivode|voivod]] (duke).

Monthly and weekly publications in minority languages include ''[[Hrvatska rije\u010d]]'' (\"Croatian Word\") in Croatian, ''[[Hlas \u013dudu]]'' (\"The Voice of the People\") in Slovak, ''[[Libertatea (Vojvodina)|Libertatea]]'' (\"Freedom\") in Romanian, and ''[[Ruske slovo|\u0420\u0443\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u0441\u043b\u043e\u0432\u043e]]'' (\"Rusyn Word\") in Rusyn. There is also ''[[Bunjeva\u010dke novine]]'' (\"The Bunjevac newspaper\") in Bunjevac.\n\nPublic Broadcasting Service of Vojvodina was founded in 1974 as Radio Television of Novi Sad, as an equal member of the association of JRT \u2013 Yugoslav Radio Television. Radio Novi Sad's first broadcast was on November 29, 1949. During the NATO bombing in the spring of 1999, the RT Novi Sad building of 20 thousand square meters was completely destroyed along with its basic production and technical premises . The Venac terrestrial broadcasting site was heavily damaged.\n\nThe Radio-Television of Vojvodina produces and broadcasts regional programming on two channels, RTV1 (Serbian language) and RTV2 (minority languages), and three radio frequencies: Radio Novi Sad 1 (Serbian), Radio Novi Sad 2 (Hungarian), Radio Novi Sad 3 (other minority communities).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rtv.rs/sr_lat/about-us|title=About Us|publisher=Radio-Television of Vojvodina|accessdate=22 August 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:Serbia Vojka from southwest IMG 9207.JPG|thumb|right|Vojvodina is known as ''Serbia's breadbasket'']]\nThe economy of Vojvodina is largely based on developed food industry and fertile agricultural soil. Agriculture is a priority sector in Vojvodina. Traditionally, it has always been a significant part of the local economy and a generator of positive results, due to the abundance of fertile agricultural land which makes up 84% of its territory. The share of agribusiness in the total industrial production is 40%, that is 30% in the total exports of Vojvodina.\n\nThe metal industry of Vojvodina has a long tradition and consists of smaller metal processing companies for components manufacturing and, to a lesser extent, of original equipment manufacturers (OEM) with their own brand name products. Vojvodina Metal Cluster gathers 116 companies with 6,300 employees. Other branches of industry are also developed such as the chemical industry, electrical industry, oil industry and construction industry. In the past decade, ICT sector has been growing rapidly and has taken significant role in Vojvodina's economic development.\n\nHigh- tech sector is a fast-growing sector in Vojvodina. Software development represents the main source of revenue, particularly development of ERP solutions, Java applications and mobile applications. IT sector companies mainly deal with software outsourcing, based on demands of international clients or with development of their own software products for purposes of domestic and international market.\nVojvodina pays particular attention to interregional and cross-border economic cooperation, as well as to implementation of priorities defined within the EU Strategy for the Danube Region.<ref name=\"vojvodina.gov.rs\"/>\n\nSome of the companies from Vojvodina:\n*[[Naftna Industrija Srbije]]\n*[[Srbijagas]]\n*[[HIP Petrohemija]]\n*[[Apatin Brewery]]\n*[[Novi Sad Fair|Novosadski sajam]]\n\nVojvodina promotes its investment potentials through the [[Vojvodina Investment Promotion]] (VIP) agency, which was founded by the Parliament of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina.\n\n===Transport===\nThere are many important roads which pass through Vojvodina. First of all, the motorway [[A1 (Serbia)|A1 motorway]] which goes from Central Europe and the Horgos border crossing to Hungary, via Novi Sad to Belgrade and further to the southeast toward Ni\u0161, where it branches: one way leads east to the border with Bulgaria; the other to the south, towards Greece. Motorway [[A3 (Serbia)|A3]] in Srem separates the west, towards the neighboring Croatia and further to Western Europe. There is also a network of regional and local roads and railway lines.\n\nThe three largest rivers in Vojvodina are navigable stream.

The team play in [[EFL League Two|League Two]], the fourth tier of English football. The club nickname is \"The Cobblers\", a reference to the town's historical shoe-making industry. They play their home games at the 7,798 capacity all-seater [[Sixfields Stadium]], having moved from the [[County Cricket Ground, Northampton|County Ground]] in 1994, where they had played since their inception. They were formed in 1897, after meetings between the town's schoolteachers and local solicitor A.J. Darnell. The club traditionally play in claret and white, and share rivalries with [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] and [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]].\n\nThe club competed in the [[Midland Football League (1889)|Midland League]] for two seasons, before joining the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] in 1901. They were crowned Southern League champions in 1908\u201309, allowing them to contest the [[1909 FA Charity Shield]]. Admitted into the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1920, they spent the next 38 years in the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] as they were unable to best second-place finishes in 1927\u201328 and 1949\u201350. During this time [[Tommy Fowler]] and [[Jack English (footballer, born 1923)|Jack English]] set club records for appearances and goals respectively, Fowler playing 552 first-team matches and English scoring 143 competitive goals. Becoming founder members of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]], manager [[Dave Bowen]] saw the club promoted at the end of the 1960\u201361 season, before they went on to win the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] title in 1962\u201363 and then promotion out of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1964\u201365. Relegated out of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] at the end of the 1965\u201366 season, this remains their only top-flight campaign, and two further relegations in the next three seasons saw them back in the fourth tier.\n\nPromoted out of the Fourth Division in 1975\u201376, they were immediately relegated, before winning the Fourth Division title in 1986\u201387. Relegated again after their third season in the third tier, they were promoted again after winning the [[1997 Football League Third Division play-off Final|1997 play-off final]]. Relegated in 1998\u201399, they won immediate promotion after securing an automatic promotion place the following season. However were once more relegated after three seasons of struggle in the third tier, before securing promotion out of [[EFL League Two|League Two]] in 2005\u201306 after two unsuccessful play-off campaigns. Relegated at the end of their third season in [[EFL League One|League One]], they won the League Two title in 2015\u201316, but only lasted two seasons in League One before again being relegated.\n\n==History==\n{{For|Northampton Town's statistical breakdown season-by-season |List of Northampton Town F.C. seasons}}\n\n===Inter-war period===\n[[File:Northampton Town FC League Performance.svg|thumb|300px|right|Chart of table positions of Northampton Town in the Football League.]]In [[1919\u201320 in English football|1919\u201320]], the first season after the war, Town conceded a club record 103 goals. Nonetheless, the club was allowed to join the [[Football League]] for the following season, in [[Football League Division Three South|Division Three (South)]]. [[1922\u201323 in English football|1922\u201323]] saw the club become a [[Public limited company|public company]] and 8,000 shares were released at \u00a31. The season produced a record crowd of 18,123 against [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth]] on Boxing day and gate receipts for the first time exceeded \u00a31,000. [[1923\u201324 in English football|1923\u201324]] started with the club raising \u00a35,000 to build a stand with a players' tunnel underneath and also improved terracing in the Hotel End. The following season saw the formation of the supporters' club. In 1925 the club's first foreign transfer took place as William Shaw was signed from Barcelona. A new ground record was set for the [[F.A. Cup]] third-round replay with Sunderland, 21,148 turned up to see the Cobblers lose 3\u20130. However, disaster occurred at the [[County Ground, Northampton|County Ground]] during December 1929, when a fire destroyed three stands, with damage valued at around \u00a35,000. Only one stand was saved although this was charred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldgrounds.co.uk/county_ground_northampton.htm#Ground%20History |title=County Ground, Northampton&nbsp;\u2013 History |publisher=Old Football Grounds |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125210619/http://www.oldgrounds.co.uk/county_ground_northampton.htm |archivedate=25 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The source of the fire was thought to be in the away dressing room; the Cobblers had earlier entertained [[AFC Bournemouth]] reserves. By August 1930, the stands were rebuilt.\n\nIn [[1932\u201333 in English football|1932\u201333]], the club created history when brothers [[Fred Dawes|Fred]] and [[Albert Dawes]] both scored in an 8\u20130 win over [[Newport County F.C.|Newport County]]. The latter finished the season scoring 32 league goals and even scored all four in a 4\u20130 win over the [[Netherlands national football team]] while the club was on tour. In [[1933\u201334 in English football|1933\u201334]], the [[F.A. Cup]] fifth round was reached for the first time courtesy of a fourth round win away to [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] who, at the time were top of Division One.  The Cobblers lost to [[Preston North End]] 4\u20130 at [[Deepdale]], setting a new ground record of 40,180. In the three seasons prior to the breakout of [[World War II]], the Cobblers finished seventh, ninth and 17th respectively in Division Three (South). In the final match prior to the war, they travelled to [[Dean Court]] and lost 10\u20130, the club's record league defeat. During the war the Cobblers had the record for the first transfer fee received during the hostilities when [[Bobby King (footballer)|Bobby King]] was sold to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] for a substantial four-figure fee.\n\n===Rise and fall===\nNorthampton were promoted three times in the five years 1960 to 1965. Starting the [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361]] season in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]], they reached the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in [[1965\u201366 in English football|1965\u201366]], their only season ever in the top division of English football. They were then relegated back to the Fourth Division over the next five years, playing in the bottom tier again in [[1969\u201370 in English football|1969\u201370]]. During their top-flight season they earned a double against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and victories at home over such luminaries as [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds]], [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]], and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn]], the latter being the only team Northampton would finish above in the table. \n\nSince their relegation from the Second Division in [[1966-67 in English football|1966-67]], Northampton have played every season in either the third or fourth tier of English football.\n\n===1970s and 80s===\nIn 1970, they lost 8\u20132 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[FA Cup]] fifth round. Six of the goals conceded were scored by [[George Best]], who received the match ball (signed by Northampton players) as a reward for his performance.<ref>May, John (24 January 2004) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/3416891.stm Cobblers stroll down memory lane] ''BBC Sport.'' Retrieved 2011-01-11.</ref> For the first time since becoming a league side the club had to apply for re-election in 1971, they finished the most favoured club with 49 votes. In the [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375 season]], future England International [[Phil Neal]] was sold, after 200 games in all competitions for the Cobblers, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] bought Neal for a then club record of \u00a365,000, whilst playing in the same side of another future England International, [[John Gregory (footballer)|John Gregory]]. Finally during the [[1975\u201376 in English football|1975\u201376 season]], the club finished 2nd in Division Four and were promoted behind champions [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]]. They did this without losing a home game and having every regular player scored during the season, including the goalkeeper, [[Alan Starling]], who netted from a penalty in the penultimate home game against [[Hartlepool United F.C|Hartlepool United]]. In [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]], the club were relegated back to Division Four, the season started with ex-[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] assistant manager, [[Pat Crerand]] in charge, however he resigned in the new year. No new manager was appointed, instead a committee was formed consisting of the chairman, the coach and three senior players. Prior to the start of the 1979\u201380 season, [[George Reilly]] was sold to [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] for a then record of \u00a3165,000, he had been the club's top scorer for the previous two seasons.\n\nNew [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] were installed in time for the [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381 season]], but they failed during the first match against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] and the game had to be abandoned. The club struggled in the bottom half of the Fourth Division for the first half of the decade, however 16-year-old [[Aidy Mann]] became the club's youngest player. In [[1984\u201385 in English football|1984\u201385]], the lowest ever league attendance was recorded at the County Ground where only 942 people turn up to watch the Cobblers lose 2\u20130 at home to [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]]; this was also the only ever league attendance under 1,000. In the same year, The club managed what seemed like a major coup when they appointed [[Tony Barton (footballer)|Tony Barton]], who had won the [[1981\u201382 European Cup|European Cup]] with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] two years previously, as manager. Barton's only season in charge proved severely disappointing however, as the club were never outside the bottom two, and health problems forced Barton's resignation near the end of that season. Success was achieved under Barton's replacement, [[Graham Carr]], who brought in several players from the non-league in addition to a number of quality league players to finish eighth in his first season in charge. The [[1986\u201387 in English football|1986\u201387 season]] saw Northampton win the Fourth Division championship, gaining a club record total of 99 points and scoring 103 goals, 29 of them to [[Richard Hill (footballer born 1963)|Richard Hill]], who was transferred in the summer to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] for a club record fee of \u00a3265,000. The club adjusted to life in Division Three quickly and just missed out on a play-off place despite finishing sixth. Important players such as [[Trevor Morley]] and [[Eddie McGoldrick]] were sold and the team fell back down to Division Four in the [[1989\u201390 in English football|1989\u201390 season]].\n\n===Early 1990s===\nThe 1990s began badly, with the club [[relegated]] to the Fourth Division at the end of the [[1989\u201390 in English football|1989\u201390]] season. The following season began well as the club looked on course to return to the [[Football League Division Three|Third Division]] at the first attempt.  They were top of the table in February, but fell away and finished mid-table. Things then got even worse and the club went into [[Administration (British football)|administration]] in April 1992, with debts of around \u00a31.6&nbsp;million. Ten players were sacked and youth players were drafted in to make up the numbers; results did not improve. These events sparked the formation of the Northampton Town [[Supporters' trust]], which has a share holding in the club and a representative on the [[board of directors]].<ref>[http://www.ntfctrust.co.uk/artman/publish/article_79.shtml The Origins of Northampton Town Supporters' Trust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705092422/http://www.ntfctrust.co.uk/artman/publish/article_79.shtml |date=5 July 2008 }} ''NTFC Trust.'' 2006-01-20.

Relegation was only escaped due the Conference champions, [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]], not meeting the necessary ground criteria. The club eventually began its move to Sixfields.\n\n===The Sixfields era===\nThe club moved to new ground, [[Sixfields Stadium]], in October 1994. The change of ground did not change the club's fortunes and they finished 17th, with [[Ian Atkins]] taking over as manager from [[John Barnwell]] halfway through the [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]] season.<ref>Hodgson, Guy (30 September 1994) [https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/northampton-sack-barnwell--football-1388857.html Northampton sack Barnwell] ''The Independent.''

Wilson, the former [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] player, was appointed manager at the start of November, going on to win two manager of the month awards.\n\nThe following season started promisingly, with players such as [[Marco Gabbiadini]] and [[Jamie Forrester]] pushing the Cobblers towards a play-off place before the club eventually finished in 18th place due to a large number of injuries in the second half of the season.

The appointment was greeted by unprecedented approval, so much so that Johnson stated his decision to join the club was partly down to the support for his appointment of a club forum. Somehow, however, things didn't go so well under Gary Johnson: the club slid further down the table in League 2 and only just avoided relegation at the end of the 2010\u201311 season.

of [[Northampton]], England. The team play in [[EFL League Two|League Two]], the fourth tier of English football. The club nickname is \"The Cobblers\", a reference to the town's historical shoe-making industry. They play their home games at the 7,798 capacity all-seater [[Sixfields Stadium]], having moved from the [[County Cricket Ground, Northampton|County Ground]] in 1994, where they had played since their inception. They were formed in 1897, after meetings between the town's schoolteachers and local solicitor A.J. Darnell. The club traditionally play in claret and white, and share rivalries with [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] and [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]].\n\nThe club competed in the [[Midland Football League (1889)|Midland League]] for two seasons, before joining the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] in 1901. They were crowned Southern League champions in 1908\u201309, allowing them to contest the [[1909 FA Charity Shield]]. Admitted into the [[English Football League|Football League]] in 1920, they spent the next 38 years in the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] as they were unable to best second-place finishes in 1927\u201328 and 1949\u201350. During this time [[Tommy Fowler]] and [[Jack English (footballer, born 1923)|Jack English]] set club records for appearances and goals respectively, Fowler playing 552 first-team matches and English scoring 143 competitive goals. Becoming founder members of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]], manager [[Dave Bowen]] saw the club promoted at the end of the 1960\u201361 season, before they went on to win the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] title in 1962\u201363 and then promotion out of the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] in 1964\u201365. Relegated out of the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] at the end of the 1965\u201366 season, this remains their only top-flight campaign, and two further relegations in the next three seasons saw them back in the fourth tier.\n\nPromoted out of the Fourth Division in 1975\u201376, they were immediately relegated, before winning the Fourth Division title in 1986\u201387. Relegated again after their third season in the third tier, they were promoted again after winning the [[1997 Football League Third Division play-off Final|1997 play-off final]]. Relegated in 1998\u201399, they won immediate promotion after securing an automatic promotion place the following season. However were once more relegated after three seasons of struggle in the third tier, before securing promotion out of [[EFL League Two|League Two]] in 2005\u201306 after two unsuccessful play-off campaigns. Relegated at the end of their third season in [[EFL League One|League One]], they won the League Two title in 2015\u201316, but only lasted two seasons in League One before again being relegated.\n\n==History==\n{{For|Northampton Town's statistical breakdown season-by-season |List of Northampton Town F.C. seasons}}\n\n===Inter-war period===\n[[File:Northampton Town FC League Performance.svg|thumb|300px|right|Chart of table positions of Northampton Town in the Football League.]]In [[1919\u201320 in English football|1919\u201320]], the first season after the war, Town conceded a club record 103 goals. Nonetheless, the club was allowed to join the [[Football League]] for the following season, in [[Football League Division Three South|Division Three (South)]]. [[1922\u201323 in English football|1922\u201323]] saw the club become a [[Public limited company|public company]] and 8,000 shares were released at \u00a31. The season produced a record crowd of 18,123 against [[Plymouth Argyle F.C.|Plymouth]] on Boxing day and gate receipts for the first time exceeded \u00a31,000. [[1923\u201324 in English football|1923\u201324]] started with the club raising \u00a35,000 to build a stand with a players' tunnel underneath and also improved terracing in the Hotel End. The following season saw the formation of the supporters' club. In 1925 the club's first foreign transfer took place as William Shaw was signed from Barcelona. A new ground record was set for the [[F.A. Cup]] third-round replay with Sunderland, 21,148 turned up to see the Cobblers lose 3\u20130. However, disaster occurred at the [[County Ground, Northampton|County Ground]] during December 1929, when a fire destroyed three stands, with damage valued at around \u00a35,000. Only one stand was saved although this was charred.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldgrounds.co.uk/county_ground_northampton.htm#Ground%20History |title=County Ground, Northampton&nbsp;\u2013 History |publisher=Old Football Grounds |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125210619/http://www.oldgrounds.co.uk/county_ground_northampton.htm |archivedate=25 November 2009 |accessdate=2009-12-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The source of the fire was thought to be in the away dressing room; the Cobblers had earlier entertained [[AFC Bournemouth]] reserves. By August 1930, the stands were rebuilt.\n\nIn [[1932\u201333 in English football|1932\u201333]], the club created history when brothers [[Fred Dawes|Fred]] and [[Albert Dawes]] both scored in an 8\u20130 win over [[Newport County F.C.|Newport County]]. The latter finished the season scoring 32 league goals and even scored all four in a 4\u20130 win over the [[Netherlands national football team]] while the club was on tour. In [[1933\u201334 in English football|1933\u201334]], the [[F.A. Cup]] fifth round was reached for the first time courtesy of a fourth round win away to [[Huddersfield Town F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] who, at the time were top of Division One.  The Cobblers lost to [[Preston North End]] 4\u20130 at [[Deepdale]], setting a new ground record of 40,180. In the three seasons prior to the breakout of [[World War II]], the Cobblers finished seventh, ninth and 17th respectively in Division Three (South). In the final match prior to the war, they travelled to [[Dean Court]] and lost 10\u20130, the club's record league defeat. During the war the Cobblers had the record for the first transfer fee received during the hostilities when [[Bobby King (footballer)|Bobby King]] was sold to [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] for a substantial four-figure fee.\n\n===Rise and fall===\nNorthampton were promoted three times in the five years 1960 to 1965. Starting the [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361]] season in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]], they reached the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] in [[1965\u201366 in English football|1965\u201366]], their only season ever in the top division of English football. They were then relegated back to the Fourth Division over the next five years, playing in the bottom tier again in [[1969\u201370 in English football|1969\u201370]]. During their top-flight season they earned a double against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] and victories at home over such luminaries as [[Leeds United A.F.C.|Leeds]], [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]], and [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn]], the latter being the only team Northampton would finish above in the table. \n\nSince their relegation from the Second Division in [[1966-67 in English football|1966-67]], Northampton have played every season in either the third or fourth tier of English football.\n\n===1970s and 80s===\nIn 1970, they lost 8\u20132 to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[FA Cup]] fifth round. Six of the goals conceded were scored by [[George Best]], who received the match ball (signed by Northampton players) as a reward for his performance.<ref>May, John (24 January 2004) [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/3416891.stm Cobblers stroll down memory lane] ''BBC Sport.'' Retrieved 2011-01-11.</ref> For the first time since becoming a league side the club had to apply for re-election in 1971, they finished the most favoured club with 49 votes. In the [[1974\u201375 in English football|1974\u201375 season]], future England International [[Phil Neal]] was sold, after 200 games in all competitions for the Cobblers, [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] bought Neal for a then club record of \u00a365,000, whilst playing in the same side of another future England International, [[John Gregory (footballer)|John Gregory]]. Finally during the [[1975\u201376 in English football|1975\u201376 season]], the club finished 2nd in Division Four and were promoted behind champions [[Lincoln City F.C.|Lincoln City]]. They did this without losing a home game and having every regular player scored during the season, including the goalkeeper, [[Alan Starling]], who netted from a penalty in the penultimate home game against [[Hartlepool United F.C|Hartlepool United]]. In [[1976\u201377 in English football|1976\u201377]], the club were relegated back to Division Four, the season started with ex-[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] assistant manager, [[Pat Crerand]] in charge, however he resigned in the new year. No new manager was appointed, instead a committee was formed consisting of the chairman, the coach and three senior players. Prior to the start of the 1979\u201380 season, [[George Reilly]] was sold to [[Cambridge United F.C.|Cambridge United]] for a then record of \u00a3165,000, he had been the club's top scorer for the previous two seasons.\n\nNew [[Floodlights (sport)|floodlights]] were installed in time for the [[1980\u201381 in English football|1980\u201381 season]], but they failed during the first match against [[Southend United F.C.|Southend United]] and the game had to be abandoned. The club struggled in the bottom half of the Fourth Division for the first half of the decade, however 16-year-old [[Aidy Mann]] became the club's youngest player. In [[1984\u201385 in English football|1984\u201385]], the lowest ever league attendance was recorded at the County Ground where only 942 people turn up to watch the Cobblers lose 2\u20130 at home to [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]]; this was also the only ever league attendance under 1,000. In the same year, The club managed what seemed like a major coup when they appointed [[Tony Barton (footballer)|Tony Barton]], who had won the [[1981\u201382 European Cup|European Cup]] with [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] two years previously, as manager. Barton's only season in charge proved severely disappointing however, as the club were never outside the bottom two, and health problems forced Barton's resignation near the end of that season. Success was achieved under Barton's replacement, [[Graham Carr]], who brought in several players from the non-league in addition to a number of quality league players to finish eighth in his first season in charge. The [[1986\u201387 in English football|1986\u201387 season]] saw Northampton win the Fourth Division championship, gaining a club record total of 99 points and scoring 103 goals, 29 of them to [[Richard Hill (footballer born 1963)|Richard Hill]], who was transferred in the summer to [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] for a club record fee of \u00a3265,000. The club adjusted to life in Division Three quickly and just missed out on a play-off place despite finishing sixth. Important players such as [[Trevor Morley]] and [[Eddie McGoldrick]] were sold and the team fell back down to Division Four in the [[1989\u201390 in English football|1989\u201390 season]].\n\n===Early 1990s===\nThe 1990s began badly, with the club [[relegated]] to the Fourth Division at the end of the [[1989\u201390 in English football|1989\u201390]] season. The following season began well as the club looked on course to return to the [[Football League Division Three|Third Division]] at the first attempt.  They were top of the table in February, but fell away and finished mid-table. Things then got even worse and the club went into [[Administration (British football)|administration]] in April 1992, with debts of around \u00a31.6&nbsp;million. Ten players were sacked and youth players were drafted in to make up the numbers; results did not improve. These events sparked the formation of the Northampton Town [[Supporters' trust]], which has a share holding in the club and a representative on the [[board of directors]].<ref>[http://www.ntfctrust.co.uk/artman/publish/article_79.shtml The Origins of Northampton Town Supporters' Trust] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705092422/http://www.ntfctrust.co.uk/artman/publish/article_79.shtml |date=5 July 2008 }} ''NTFC Trust.'' 2006-01-20.

Over 2,500 made the trip to [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] and saw the Cobblers win 3\u20132, despite being 2\u20130 down at half-time. The [[1993\u201394 in English football|1993\u201394]] season got worse for the Cobblers as they finished bottom of the [[Football League]] for the only time in the club's history. Relegation was only escaped due the Conference champions, [[Kidderminster Harriers F.C.|Kidderminster Harriers]], not meeting the necessary ground criteria. The club eventually began its move to Sixfields.\n\n===The Sixfields era===\nThe club moved to new ground, [[Sixfields Stadium]], in October 1994. The change of ground did not change the club's fortunes and they finished 17th, with [[Ian Atkins]] taking over as manager from [[John Barnwell]] halfway through the [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395]] season.<ref>Hodgson, Guy (30 September 1994) [https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/northampton-sack-barnwell--football-1388857.html Northampton sack Barnwell] ''The Independent.''

Ian Atkins left the club in October following a poor start to the season; his assistant, [[Kevin Wilson (footballer born 1961)|Kevin Wilson]] and coach [[Kevan Broadhurst]] took joint charge for the rest of the month. Wilson, the former [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] player, was appointed manager at the start of November, going on to win two manager of the month awards.\n\nThe following season started promisingly, with players such as [[Marco Gabbiadini]] and [[Jamie Forrester]] pushing the Cobblers towards a play-off place before the club eventually finished in 18th place due to a large number of injuries in the second half of the season. [[Kevin Wilson (footballer born 1961)|Kevin Wilson]] was sacked in November 2001, to make way for his assistant [[Kevan Broadhurst]], who steered the Cobblers from relegation to a remarkable survival with a game to spare after losing only one home game from mid-January.

During his lifetime he was known as the \"[[Hoosier]] Poet\" and \"Children's Poet\" for his [[dialect]] works and his children's poetry. His poems tend to be humorous or sentimental. Of the approximately 1,000 poems Riley wrote, the majority are in dialect. His famous works include \"[[Little Orphant Annie]]\" and \"[[The Raggedy Man]]\".\n\nRiley began his career writing verses as a sign maker and submitting poetry to newspapers. Thanks in part to poet [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s endorsement, he eventually earned successive jobs at Indiana newspaper publishers during the late 1870s. He gradually rose to prominence during the 1880s through his poetry reading tours. He traveled a touring circuit first in the [[Midwest]], and then nationally, appearing either alone or with other famous talents. During this period Riley's long-term addiction to alcohol began to affect his performing abilities, and he suffered financially as a result.  However, once he extricated himself from a series of poorly negotiated contracts that sought to limit his earnings, he began to accumulate wealth and eventually became a financial success.\n\nBy the 1890s, Riley had become known as a bestselling author. His children's poems were compiled into a book illustrated by [[Howard Chandler Christy]]. Titled ''Rhymes of Childhood'', it was his most popular and sold millions of copies. As a poet, Riley achieved an uncommon level of fame during his lifetime. He was honored with annual Riley Day celebrations around the United States and was regularly called on to perform readings at national civic events. He continued to write and hold occasional poetry readings until a stroke [[paralysis|paralyzed]] his right arm in 1910.\n\nRiley's chief legacy was his influence in fostering the creation of a Midwestern cultural identity and his contributions to the [[Golden Age of Indiana Literature]]. With other writers of his era, he helped create a caricature of Midwesterners and formed a literary community that produced works rivaling the established eastern literati. There are many memorials dedicated to Riley, including the [[James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:James Whitcomb Riley.jpg|thumb|James Whitcomb Riley, [[John Singer Sargent]], 1903]]\n\n===Family and background===\nJames Whitcomb Riley was born on October 7, 1849, in the town of [[Greenfield, Indiana]], the third of the six children of Reuben Andrew and Elizabeth Marine Riley.<ref>Van Allen, p. 17</ref><ref group = n>Coincidentally, Riley was born on the day of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s death. (see: Van Allen, p. 2)</ref> Riley's father was an attorney, and in the year before his birth, he was elected a member of the Indiana House of Representatives as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]]. He developed a friendship with [[James Whitcomb]], the governor of Indiana, after whom he named his son.<ref name = v29>Van Allen, p. 29</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 30</ref> Martin Riley, Riley's uncle, was an amateur poet who occasionally wrote verses for local newspapers. Riley was fond of his uncle who influenced his interest in poetry.<ref>Crowder, p. 31</ref>\n\nShortly after his birth, the family moved into a larger house in town.<ref>Crowder, p. 28</ref> Riley was \"a quiet boy, not talkative, who would often go about with one eye shut as he observed and speculated\".<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 35\">Van Allen, p. 35</ref> His mother taught him to read and write at home before sending him to the local community school in 1852.<ref>Van Allen, 39</ref> He found school difficult and was frequently in trouble. Often punished, he had nothing kind to say of his teachers in his writings. His poem \"The Educator\" tells of an intelligent but sinister teacher and may have been based on one of his instructors.<ref>Van Allen, p. 40</ref><ref name=Bodenhamer1195/> Riley was most fond of his last teacher, Lee O. Harris. Harris noticed Riley's interest in poetry and reading and encouraged him to pursue it further.<ref>Van Allen, p. 43</ref>\n\nRiley's school attendance was sporadic, and he graduated from [[grade eight]] at age 20 in 1869. In an 1892 newspaper article, Riley confessed he knew little of mathematics, geography, or science, and his understanding of proper grammar was poor.<ref>Van Allen, p. 44</ref> Later critics, like Henry Beers, pointed to his poor education as the reason for his success in writing; his prose was written in the language of common people which spurred his popularity.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 46\">Van Allen, p. 46</ref>\n\n===Childhood influences===\n[[File:OldSwimmingHole GreenfieldIN.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A stream of water surrounded by trees|\"The Old Swimming Hole\" that appears in Riley's poems is now a large and well-used park on the east side of Greenfield.]]\n\nRiley lived in [[Riley Birthplace and Museum|his parents' home]] until he was 21 years old. At age five, he began spending time at the Brandywine Creek near Greenfield. His poems \"A Barefoot Boy\" and \"[[The Old Swimmin' Hole (poem)|The Old Swimmin' Hole]]\" refer to his time there.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 35\"/> As a child he was introduced to many people who later influenced his poetry. His father regularly brought home clients and disadvantaged people to help them. Riley's poem \"The Raggedy Man\" is based on a German tramp his father hired to work at the family home.<ref name = v29/> Riley picked up the cadence and character of the [[dialect]] of central Indiana from travelers along the old [[National Road]]. Their speech greatly influenced the hundreds of poems he wrote in 19th century [[Hoosier]] dialect.<ref>Van Allen, p. 34</ref>\n\nHis mother often told him stories of fairies, [[troll]]s, and giants, and read him children's poems. She was very superstitious and influenced Riley with many of her beliefs. They both placed \"spirit rappings\" in their homes on places like tables and [[Chest of drawers|bureaux]] to capture any spirits that may have been wandering about. This influence can be found in many of his works, including \"Flying Islands of the Night\".<ref>Van Allen, p. 36</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 155</ref>\n\nAs was common at that time, Riley and his friends had few toys, and amused themselves with activities. With his mother's help, Riley began creating plays and theatricals, which he and his friends would practice and perform in the back of a local grocery store. As he grew older, the boys named their troupe the Adelphians and began to hold their shows in barns where they could fit larger audiences.<ref>Crowder, p. 46\u201348</ref> Riley wrote of these early performances in his poem \"When We First Played 'Show{{'}}\", referring to himself as \"Jamesy\".<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 37\">Van Allen, p. 37</ref>\n\n{{Listen|filename=Anniecomp.ogg|title=\"Little Orphant Annie\"|description=A 1912 [[phonograph]] recording of Riley reading his famous poem, \"[[Little Orphant Annie]].\"|format=[[Ogg]]|pos=left}}\n\nMany of Riley's poems are filled with musical references. He had no musical education and was unable to read [[sheet music]]. His father taught him to play the guitar, and a friend taught him the violin. He performed in two different local bands and became so proficient on the violin he was invited to play with a group of adult [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] at several events. A few of his later poems were set to music and song, one of the most well known being [[Shortnin' Bread|A Short'nin' Bread Song\u2014Pieced Out]].<ref>Van Allen, pp. 37\u201338</ref>\n\nWhen Riley was 10 years old, the first library opened in his hometown. From an early age he developed a love of literature. He and his friends spent time at the library where the librarian read stories and poems to them. [[Charles Dickens]] became one Riley's favorites and inspired the poems \"St. Lirriper\", \"Christmas Season\", and \"God Bless Us Every One\".<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 37\"/>\n\nRiley's father enlisted in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]], leaving his wife to manage the family home. While he was away, the family took in a 12-year-old orphan named Mary Alice \"Allie\" Smith. She was the inspiration for Riley's poem \"[[Little Orphant Annie]]\". Riley had intended titling the poem \"Little Orphant Allie\", but a [[Typesetting|typesetter]]'s error changed it during printing.<ref name=Bodenhamer1195>Bodenhamer, 1195</ref><ref>Van Allen, p. 33</ref><ref name = IU>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/riley/docs/1_raggedy.html|title= The Raggedy Man and Little Orphant Annie|publisher=[[Indiana University]]|accessdate=2010-01-08}}</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 38</ref>\n\n===Finding poetry===\nRiley's father returned from the war partially paralyzed. He was unable to continue working in his legal practice, and the family soon fell into financial distress. The war's negative affects soon caused his relationship with his family to deteriorate. He opposed Riley's interest in poetry and encouraged him to find a different career. The family finances finally disintegrated. They were forced to sell their town home in April 1870 and return to their country farm.<ref>Van Allen, p. 45</ref> Riley's mother was able to keep peace in the family, but after her death in August from [[heart disease]], Riley and his father had a final break. He blamed his mother's death on his father's failure to care for her in her final weeks.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 46\"/><ref>Crowder, p. 52</ref> He continued to regret the loss of his childhood home. He wrote frequently of how it was so cruelly snatched from him by the war, subsequent poverty and his mother's death. After the events of 1870, he developed an addiction to alcohol and struggled with it for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 46\"/><ref>Crowder, p. 53</ref>\n\n[[File:James Whitcomb Riley, house and sign painted advertisement, 1871.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Sign advertising painting services|A sign Riley created advertising his services as a sign painter.]]\n\nBecoming increasingly belligerent toward his father, Riley moved out of the family home and briefly took a job painting houses before leaving Greenfield in November 1870. He was recruited as a Bible salesman and began working in the nearby town of [[Rushville, Indiana]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 51</ref> The job provided little income and he returned to Greenfield in March 1871 where he started an apprenticeship to a painter. He completed it and opened a business in Greenfield creating and maintaining signs. His earliest known poems are verses he wrote as clever advertisements for his customers.<ref>Van Allen, p. 55</ref>\n\nRiley began participating in local theater productions with the Adelphians to earn extra income. During the winter months, when the demand for painting declined, Riley began writing poetry which he mailed to his brother who lived in Indianapolis. He acted as Riley's agent and offered the poems to the ''Indianapolis Mirror'' newspaper free of charge. His first poem was featured on March 30, 1872, under the pseudonym \"Jay Whit\".<ref name = v56/> Riley wrote more than 20 poems to the newspaper, including one that was featured on the front page.<ref name = v56>Van Allen, p. 56</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 56</ref>\n\nIn July 1872, after becoming convinced sales would provide more income than sign painting, he joined the McCrillus Company based in [[Anderson, Indiana]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 58</ref> The company sold [[patent medicine]]s that they marketed using small traveling shows around Indiana. Riley joined the act as a [[huckster]], calling himself the \"Painter Poet\". He traveled with the act, composing poetry and performing at the shows.<ref>Van Allen, p. 59</ref><ref>Crowder, pp. 56\u201357</ref> After his act he sold tonics to his audience, sometimes employing dishonesty. During one stop, Riley presented himself as a formerly blind painter who had been cured by a tonic, using himself as evidence to encourage the audience to purchase it.<ref>Van Allen, p. 61</ref>\n\nRiley began sending poems to his brother again in February 1873. About the same time he and several friends began an advertisement company.<ref>Van Allen, p. 65</ref> The men traveled around Indiana creating large billboard-like signs on the sides of buildings and barns and in high places that were visible from a distance.<ref>Van Allen, p. 66</ref> The company was financially successful, but Riley was continually drawn to poetry. In October, he traveled to [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] where he took a job at Stockford & Blowney painting verses on signs for a month; the shortness of his stay at this job may have been due to his frequent drunkenness at that time.<ref>Van Allen, p. 69</ref>\n\nIn early 1874, Riley returned to Greenfield to become a full-time writer.<ref>Van Allen, p. 70</ref> In February, he submitted a poem titled \"At Last\" to a Connecticut newspaper the ''Danbury News''.<ref>Crowder, p. 64</ref> The editors accepted it, paid him for it, and wrote him a letter encouraging him to submit more. Riley found the note and his first payment inspiring.<ref>Van Allen, p. 71</ref> He began submitting poems regularly to the editors,<ref>Van Allen, p. 75</ref> but after the newspaper shut down in 1875, Riley was left without a paying publisher. He began traveling and performing with the Adelphians around central Indiana to earn an income while he searched for a new publisher. In August 1875, he joined another traveling tonic show run by the [[Hamlin's Wizard Oil|Wizard Oil Company]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 77</ref><ref group = n>Riley remained with the Wizard Oil Company until late 1877. During his time there, he made the acquaintance of [[Paul Dresser]]. (see: Crowder, p. 68)</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n\n===Newspaper work===\nRiley began writing to the well-known American poet [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] during late 1875 seeking his endorsement to help him start a career as a poet.<ref>Van Allen, p. 86</ref> He submitted many poems to Longfellow, whom he considered the greatest living poet. Not receiving a prompt response, he sent similar letters to [[John Townsend Trowbridge]] and several other prominent writers asking for an endorsement.<ref>Van Allen, p. 89</ref> Longfellow finally replied in a brief letter, telling Riley, \"I have read [the poems] in great pleasure, and think they show a true poetic faculty and insight.\"<ref>Van Allen, p. 91</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 75</ref> Riley carried the letter with him everywhere and, hoping to receive a job offer and to create a market for his poetry, he began sending poems to dozens of newspapers touting Longfellow's endorsement. Among the newspapers to take an interest in his poems was the ''[[Indianapolis Journal]]'', a major [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Party metropolitan newspaper in Indiana. Among the first poems it purchased from him were \"Song of the New Year\", \"An Empty Nest\", and a short story entitled \"A Remarkable Man\".<ref>Van Allen, p. 93</ref>\n\nThe editors of the ''Anderson Democrat'' discovered Riley's poems in the ''Indianapolis Journal'' and offered him a job as a reporter in February 1877.<ref>Van Allen, p. 95</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 76</ref> Riley accepted. He worked gathering local news, writing articles, and assisting with typesetting. He continued to write poems regularly for the newspaper and to sell other poems to larger newspapers.<ref>Van Allen, p. 96</ref> During the year, Riley spent working in [[Anderson, Indiana|Anderson]], he met and courted Edora Mysers. The couple became engaged, but ended the relationship after they had decided against marriage in August.<ref>Van Allen, p. 97</ref>\n\nDespite local success at having his poems published, his submissions continued to be rejected by established eastern periodicals as being below their standards. Riley began formulating a plot to prove his work was of good quality and that it was being rejected only because his name was unknown in the east. He wrote a poem imitating the style of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and submitted it to the ''Kokomo Dispatch'' under a fictitious name claiming it was a long-lost Poe poem. The ''Dispatch'' published the poem and reported it as such.<ref>Van Allen, p. 102</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 79</ref> Riley and two other men who were part of the plot waited two weeks for the poem to be published by major newspapers in Chicago, Boston, and New York to gauge their reaction; they were disappointed. While a few newspapers believed the poem was authentic, most did not, claiming the quality was too poor to be written by Poe.<ref>Van Allen, p. 105</ref> A ''Dispatch'' employee learned the truth of the incident and reported it to the ''Kokomo Tribune'', which published an expos\u00e9 that outed Riley as a conspirator behind the hoax. The revelation damaged the ''Dispatch''{{'}}s credibility and harmed Riley's reputation.<ref>Van Allen, p. 106</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 82</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the Poe plot, Riley was dismissed from the ''Democrat''. He returned to Greenfield to spend time writing poetry.<ref>Van Allen, p. 112</ref> He met Clara Louise Bottsford, a school teacher boarding in his father's home. They found they had much in common, particularly their love of literature. The couple began a 12-year, intermittent relationship, Riley's longest.<ref>Van Allen, p. 115</ref> In mid-1878, the couple had their first breakup caused partly by Riley's alcoholism. Riley made a first attempt to give up liquor by joining a local [[temperance movement|temperance]] organization but quit after a few weeks.<ref>Van Allen, p. 116</ref>\n\n===Performing poet===\nWithout a steady income, his financial situation worsened. Riley began submitting his poems to more prominent literary magazines, including ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'', but was informed that although it showed promise, his work was still short of the standards required for use in their publications.<ref>Van Allen, p. 117</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 83</ref> Locally, he was still dealing with the stigma of the Poe plot. The ''Indianapolis Journal'' and other newspapers refused to accept his poetry, leaving him desperate for income. On the advice of a friend, in January 1878 Riley paid an entrance fee to join a traveling lecture circuit where he could give poetry readings. In exchange, he received a portion of the profit his performances earned. These circuits were popular at the time, and Riley quickly earned a local reputation for his entertaining readings.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 118\">Van Allen, p. 118</ref>\n\nIn August 1878, he followed Indiana Governor [[James D. Williams]] as speaker at a civic event in a small town near Indianapolis. He recited a recently composed poem, \"A Childhood Home of Long Ago\", telling of life in pioneer Indiana. The poem was well received and was given good reviews by several newspapers.<ref>Van Allen, p. 122</ref>\n\n''Flying Islands of the Night'' is the only play Riley wrote and published. Written while he was traveling with the Adelphians but never performed, the play has similarities to ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', which Riley may have used as a model.<ref>Van Allen, p. 125</ref> It  concerns a kingdom besieged by evil forces of a sinister queen who is defeated eventually by an angel-like heroine.<ref>Van Allen, p. 128</ref> Most reviews were positive. Riley published the play, and it became popular in the central Indiana area during late 1878, helping him to convince newspapers to accept his poetry again. In November 1879, he was offered a position as a columnist at the ''Indianapolis Journal'' and accepted after being encouraged by E.B. Matindale, the paper's chief editor.<ref>Van Allen, p. 132</ref>\n\nAlthough the play and his newspaper work helped expose him to a wider audience, the chief source of his increasing popularity was his performances on the lecture circuit. He gave both dramatic and comedic readings of his poetry, and by early 1879 could guarantee large crowds when he performed.<ref>Van Allen, p. 136</ref> In an 1894 article, [[Hamlin Garland]] wrote that Riley's celebrity resulted from his reading talent saying, \"his vibrant individual voice, his flexible lips, his droll glance, united to make him at once poet and comedian\u2014comedian in the sense in which makes for tears as well as for laughter\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Real Conversations: A Dialogue Between James Whitcomb Riley and Hamlin Garland.|author=Hamlin, Garland|date=February 1894|pages=2\u20133|publisher=McClure's Magazine}}</ref> Although he was a good performer, his acts were not entirely original in style; he frequently copied practices developed by [[Mark Twain|Samuel Clemens]] and [[Will Carleton]].<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 137\">Van Allen, p. 137</ref> His tour in 1880 took him to every city in Indiana where he was introduced by local dignitaries and other popular figures, including novelist [[Maurice Thompson]] with whom he began to develop a close friendship.<ref>Van Allen, p. 158</ref>\n\nDeveloping and maintaining publicity became a constant job requiring more of his attention as his fame grew. Keeping his alcohol addiction secret, maintaining the persona of a simple rural poet and a friendly common person became most important.<ref>Van Allen, p. 48</ref> Riley identified these traits as the basis of his popularity during the mid-1880s and wrote of his need to maintain a fictional persona.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 137\"/> He encouraged the stereotype by writing poetry he thought would help build his identity. He was aided by editorials he wrote and submitted to the ''Indianapolis Journal'' offering observations on events from his perspective as a \"humble rural poet\".<ref name = v139/> He changed his appearance to look more mainstream, and began by shaving his mustache off and abandoning the flamboyant dress he employed in his early circuit tours.<ref>Van Allen, p. 151</ref>\n\nBy 1880 his poems were published nationally and receiving positive reviews. \"Tom Johnson's Quit\" was carried by newspapers in twenty states, thanks in part to the careful cultivation of his popularity.<ref name = v139>Van Allen, p. 139</ref> Riley became frustrated that despite his growing acclaim he found it difficult to achieve financial success.<ref>Van Allen, p. 148</ref> In the early 1880s, in addition to his steady performing, Riley began producing many poems to increase his income. Half of his poems were written during this period. The constant labor had adverse effects on his health, which was worsened by his drinking. At the urging of Maurice Thompson, he again attempted to stop drinking liquor, but was unable to give it up for more than a few months.<ref>Van Allen, p. 146</ref>\n\n==''Indianapolis Journal''==\n\n===Newspaper poet===\nRiley moved to Indianapolis at the end of 1879 to begin his employment with the ''Indianapolis Journal''. It was the only metropolitan newspaper there with daily editions and had a wide readership. He wrote a regular society column that often included verses of poetry.<ref>Van Allen, p. 154</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 95</ref> Thereafter Riley met many prominent people and began a close friendship with [[Eugene V. Debs]].<ref>Crowder, p. 93</ref> He enjoyed Riley's works and often complimented his sentiments.<ref>Crowder, p. 94</ref> Riley had used the pseudonym \"Jay Whit\" since he began writing poetry but finally began to use his own name in April 1881.<ref>Crowder, p. 104</ref>\n\nRiley renewed his relationship with Bottsford in 1880, and the two corresponded frequently. Their relationship remained unstable, but Riley became deeply attached to her. She inspired his poem \"The Werewife\", which told of a perfect wife who could suddenly become a demonic monster.<ref>Van Allen, p. 157</ref> Bottsford pressed Riley for marriage several times, but he refused.<ref>Van Allen, p. 165</ref> They broke off their relationship a second time in 1881 when she discovered his correspondence with two other women,<ref>Van Allen, p. 166</ref> and found he had taken a secret vacation to [[Wisconsin]] with one of them.<ref>Crowder, p. 100</ref>\n\nRiley's alcoholism influenced some of his poems during his time working for the ''Journal''. These included \"On Quitting California\", \"John Golliher's Third Womern\", ''[sic]'' and \"The Dismal Fate of Tit\", which each refer to the delirium caused by drinking.<ref>Van Allen, p. 160</ref> Although Riley rarely published anything controversial, some of his poems published from the same period, including \"Afterwhiles\", allude to drug usage and make vague sexual references.<ref>Van Allen, p. 162</ref> During the early 1880s, Riley still made submissions to the elite literary periodicals, but continued to be rejected. Riley found this discouraging, but persevered. He believed he would never be recognized as a true literary figure until one of the prestigious periodicals published his work.<ref>Van Allen, p. 163</ref>\n\n===Lyceum circuit===\nRiley undertook occasional reading tours around Indiana, and in August 1880 he was invited to perform at [[Asbury University]]. His performance there so impressed the local [[Phi Kappa Psi]] chapter, he was invited to join as an honorary member.<ref>Crowder, p. 111</ref> Through the fraternity he met [[Robert Jones Burdette]], a writer and minister in the Indianapolis area. Burdette was a member of the [[James Redpath|Redpath Lyceum Bureau]] of Boston, a prominent lecture circuit whose regular speakers included [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 174</ref> Burdette encouraged Riley to join the circuit through its Chicago branch.<ref>Crowder, p. 105</ref> Riley's accumulated debt and low income began causing him trouble in 1881, and he decided that rejoining a lecture circuit would provide much needed funds.<ref>Crowder, p. 112</ref> His agreement for continued employment with the circuit depended on his ability to draw audiences during the first season, beginning in April 1881. He succeeded, drawing the largest crowds in Chicago and [[Indianapolis]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 176</ref>\n\nBecause of his success in the Midwest, the circuit leaders invited him to make an east coast tour, starting in [[Boston]] at the [[Tremont Temple]] in February 1882.<ref>Van Allen, pp. 178\u2013179</ref> Riley agreed, signing a ten-year agreement and granting half his receipts to his agent.<ref>Crowder, p. 119</ref> Before his performance, he traveled to [[Longfellow House\u2013Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site|Longfellow's home]] in [[Massachusetts]] and convinced him to agree to a meeting. Their brief meeting was one of Riley's fondest memories, and he wrote a lengthy article about it after Longfellow's death only a month later.<ref>Van Allen, p. 180\u2013183</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 106</ref> Longfellow encouraged Riley to focus on poetry and gave him advice for his upcoming performance where Riley was well received. His poems were greeted with laughter and praised in the city's newspaper reviews.<ref>Van Allen, p. 184</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 107</ref> Boston was the literary center of the United States at the time, and the impression Riley made on the city's literary community finally encouraged prestigious periodicals to  publish his work. ''[[The Century Magazine]]'' was the first to do so, running \"In Swimming-Time\" in its September 1883 issue.<ref>Van Allen, p. 185</ref> Until the 1890s, it remained the only major literary magazine to publish Riley's work. Knowing the high standards of the magazine, Riley reserved his best work each year to submit to it, including one of his favorites, \"The Old Man and Jim\" in 1887.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 213\">Van Allen, p. 213</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1882, Riley's finances began improving dramatically, thanks largely to the income from his performances.<ref>Van Allen, p. 188</ref> During 1883 he began writing his \"Boone County\" poems under the pseudonym \"Benjamin F. Johnson of Boone\". They were almost entirely written in dialect and emphasized topics of rural life during the early nineteenth century, often employing nostalgia and the simplicity of country life as elements. \"The Old Swimmin'-Hole\" and \"When the Frost Is on the Punkin'\" were the most popular and helped earn the entire series critical acclaim. The topics were popular with readers, reminding many of them of their childhood.<ref>Van Allen, p. 192</ref> [[Bobbs-Merrill Company|Merrill, Meigs & Company]] (later renamed Bobbs-Merrill Company) approached Riley to compile the poems into a book. Riley agreed and his first book was published in August 1883, titled ''The Old Swimmin'-Hole and 'Leven More Poems''. The book's popularity necessitated a second printing before the end of the year.<ref>Van Allen, p. 193</ref> During this period Riley determined that his most popular poems were those on topics of rural life, and he began to use that as a common theme throughout his future work.<ref>Van Allen, p. 194</ref>\n\nThe income from his book allowed Riley to ease his busy work schedule; he submitted articles to the ''Journal'' less often and made fewer lecture stops. He wrote fewer poems but their quality improved; he wrote his most famous poems during the mid-1880s, including \"Little Orphant Annie\". <ref>Van Allen, p. 196</ref> Riley attempted to secure a new job at a periodical and leave the ''Journal'', but the magazines would not hire him unless he was willing to relocate. Riley was steadfast in his refusal to leave Indiana telling reporters that his rural home was his inspiration and to leave would ruin his poetry.<ref>Van Allen, p. 197</ref>\n\nRiley renewed his relationship with Bottsworth for a third and final time in 1883. The two corresponded frequently and had secret lovers' rendezvous. He stopped visiting other women and their relationship became more dedicated and stable.<ref>Van Allen, p. 199</ref> Bottsworth became convinced Riley was seeing another woman, however, and they ended their relationship in January 1885.<ref>Van Allen, pp. 204\u2013205</ref> Riley's sister, Mary, had become a close friend of Bottsworth and scolded him for his mistreatment of her. Her reputation was tarnished by the affair, and she found it difficult to find employment once their relationship was over.<ref>Crowder, pp. 108\u2013110</ref>\n\nIn 1884, Riley toured the major cities in the eastern United States again.<ref>Van Allen, p. 301</ref> Following the lectures, he began compiling a second book of poetry. He completed it during July, and Bowen-Merrill published it in December with the title ''The Boss Girl, A Christmas Story and Other Sketches''.<ref>Van Allen, p. 207</ref> The book, which contained humorous poetry and short stories, received mixed reviews. It was popular around Indiana, where most of its copies were sold. One reviewer, however, called the poems \"weird, nightmarish, and eerie\" and compared them to Edgar Allan Poe's works.<ref>Van Allen, p. 208</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 121</ref>\n\nWhile Riley was working on his book, he was unexpectedly invited by [[James Pond (Medal of Honor)|James B. Pond]], the agent for many of the nation's major performers, to join a one-hundred nights' engagement in New York City in a show that included Samuel Clemens and [[Charles Dudley Warner|Dudley Warner]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 202</ref> Riley was unable to agree with the Redpath Bureau who had to authorize any other performance under the terms of their contract. He believed his contract with the Redpath Bureau was limiting his opportunities, and his relationship with his agent became strained.<ref>Van Allen, p. 203</ref><ref name=\"Crowder, p. 149\">Crowder, p. 149</ref>\n\n===Western Association of Writers===\nDue in part to the limited success of his latest book outside Indiana, Riley was persuaded to begin working with other midwestern writers to form an association to promote their work. Popular Indiana writer [[Lew Wallace]], author of ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]'', was a major promoter of the effort.<ref>Van Allen, p. 209</ref> During 1885, more than one hundred writers joined the group. They held their first meeting in July, naming themselves the Western Association of Writers. At the meeting Maurice Thompson was named president, and Riley vice president.<ref>Van Allen, p. 210</ref> The association never succeeded in its goal of creating a powerful advertising force, but became a social club and a rival literary community to the eastern writing establishment. Riley was disappointed with the shortcomings of the group but came to depend on its regular meetings as an escape from his normally hectic schedule.<ref>Van Allen, p. 211</ref>\n\nThrough the association, Riley became acquainted with most of the notable writers in the Midwestern United States, including humorist [[Edgar Wilson Nye]] of Chicago. After completing his lecture circuit in 1885, Riley formed a partnership with Nye and his agent to begin a new tour. The Redpath Bureau agreed to allow Riley to tour with Nye, provided he maintained his financial agreements with them.<ref>Van Allen, p. 212</ref> In addition to touring, Riley and Nye collaborated on a book, ''Nye and Riley's Railway Guide'', a collection of humorous anecdotes and poems intended to parody popular tourist literature of the day. Published in 1888, the book was somewhat successful and had three reprints.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 213\"/>\n\nIn October 1887, Riley and the association joined with other writers to petition the [[United States Congress]] to attempt to negotiate international treaties to protect American copyrights abroad. The group became known as the International Copyright League and had significant success in its efforts. When traveling to one of the league's meetings in New York City that year, Riley was struck by [[Bell's palsy]]. He recovered after three weeks but remained secluded to hide the effects of the sickness which he believed was caused by his alcoholism. He made another attempt to stop drinking alcohol with the help of a minister, but soon returned to his old habit.<ref>Van Allen, p. 214</ref>\n\nAfter recovering, Riley remained briefly in New York to participate in a show at [[Chickering Hall, New York|Chickering Hall]] with Edgar Nye, Samuel Clemens, and several others. Riley was introduced by [[James Russell Lowell]] before his performance, and Lowell gave Riley a glowing endorsement to the crowd. His poetry brought both tears and laughter according to ''[[The New York Sun]]''. Critic [[Edmund Clarence Stedman]], one of the foremost literary critics of the era, was present and wrote that Riley's dialect poems were the finest he had ever heard, \"in which a homely dramatis {{sic}} persona's heart is laid open by subtle indirect, absolutely sure and tender\" poetry.<ref>Van Allen, p. 217</ref> As a result of his New York performance, his name and picture were carried in all the major eastern papers, and he quickly became well known throughout the United States. Sales of ''The Boss Girl'' increased, resulting in the fifth and largest printing, and Riley finally began to achieve the widespread fame he sought.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 118\"/>\n\nClemens disliked being upstaged by Riley and attempted to avoid any future joint performances with him. According to one review, Clemens \"shriveled up into a bitter patch of melancholy in the fierce light of Mr. Riley's humour\".<ref>Van Allen, p. 216</ref>\n\nAfter returning home from his tour in early 1888, Riley finished compiling his third book, titled ''Old-Fashioned Roses''. Arranged to appeal to British readers, it included only a few of his dialect poems and consisted mostly of [[sonnet]]s. The book reprinted many poems Riley had already published but included some new ones he wrote specifically for the book, including \"The Days Gone By\", \"The Little White Hearse\", and \"The Serenade.\" The book was Riley's favorite because it included his finest works and was published by the prestigious [[Longman|Longmans, Green]] Publishers with high quality printing and binding.<ref>Van Allen, p. 224</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 133</ref>\n\nIn late 1888 he finished work on a fourth book, ''Pipes o' Pan at Zekesbury'' which was released to great acclaim in the United States. Based on a fictional town in Indiana, Riley presented many stories and poems about its citizens and way of life. It received mixed reviews from literary critics who wrote of it that Riley's stories were not of the same quality as his poetry. The book was very popular with the public and went through numerous reprints.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 225\">Van Allen, p. 225</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 132</ref>\n\nRiley was quickly becoming wealthy from his books and touring, earning nearly $20,000 in 1888. He no longer needed his job at the journal and left it near the end of that year. The newspaper had served to earn him fame and had published hundreds of his articles, stories, and poems.<ref>Van Allen, p. 218</ref>\n\n==National fame==\n\n===Politics===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    = \n | width     = 220\n | image1    = James Whitcomb Riley 1940 Issue-10c.jpg\n | alt1      = A postage bearing Riley's image\n | caption1  = James Whitcomb Riley [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States#Famous Americans Series of 1940|Issue of 1940]]\n | image2    = Edgar Wilson Nye & James Whitcomb Riley show advertisement, 1888.jpg\n | alt2      = Sketch of two men riding an elephant\n | caption2  = An advertisement for Riley and Nye's show.\n}}\n\nIn March 1888, Riley traveled to Washington, D.C. where he had dinner at the [[White House]] with other members of the International Copyright League and President  [[Grover Cleveland]]. Riley gave a brief performance for the dignitaries at the event before speaking about the need for international copyright protections. Cleveland was enamored by Riley's performance and invited him back for a private meeting during which the two men discussed cultural topics.<ref>Van Allen, p. 219</ref> In the [[1888 United States presidential election|1888 Presidential Election campaign]], Riley's acquaintance [[Benjamin Harrison]] was nominated as the Republican candidate. Although Riley had shunned politics for most of his life, he gave Harrison a personal endorsement and participated in fund-raising events and vote stumping. The election was exceptionally partisan in Indiana, and Riley found the atmosphere of the campaign stressful; he vowed never to become involved with politics again.<ref>Van Allen, p. 220</ref>\n\nUpon Harrison's election, he suggested Riley be named the national [[poet laureate]], but Congress failed to act on the request. Riley was still honored by Harrison and visited him at the White House on several occasions to perform at civic events.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 221\">Van Allen, p. 221</ref>\n\n===Pay problems and scandal===\nRiley and Nye made arrangements with James Pond to do two national tours during 1888 and 1889.<ref>Crowder, p. 123</ref> They were popular and generally sold out, with hundreds having to be turned away. The shows were usually forty-five minutes to an hour long and featured Riley reading often humorous poetry interspersed by stories and jokes from Nye. The shows were informal, and the two men adjusted their performances based on their audiences' reactions. Riley memorized forty of his poems for the shows to add to his own versatility.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 221\"/><ref>Crowder, p. 124</ref> Many prominent literary and theatrical people attended the shows. At a New York City show in March 1888, [[Augustin Daly]] was so enthralled by it he insisted on hosting the two men at a banquet with several leading Broadway theater actors.<ref>Crowder, p. 130</ref>\n\nDespite serving as the act's main draw, Riley was not permitted to become an equal partner in the venture. Nye and Pond both received a percentage of the net profit, while Riley was paid a flat rate for each performance.<ref>Crowder, p. 134</ref> In addition, because of his past agreements with the Redpath Lyceum Bureau, Riley was required to pay half of his fee to his agent Amos Walker. This meant the other men profited more than Riley from his own work.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 225\"/>\n\nTo remedy this situation, Riley hired his brother-in-law Henry Eitel, an Indianapolis banker, to manage his finances and act on his behalf to try to extricate him from his contract. Despite discussions and assurances from Pond that he would work to address the problem, Eitel had no success. Pond ultimately made the situation worse by booking months of solid performances, not allowing Riley and Nye a day of rest. These events affected Riley physically and emotionally; he became despondent and began his worst period of alcoholism. During November 1889, several shows were cancelled after Riley became severely inebriated at a stop in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 226</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 137</ref>\n\nWalker began monitoring Riley and denying him access to liquor, but he found ways to evade him. At a stop at the Masonic Temple Theatre in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], in January 1890, Riley paid the hotel's bartender to sneak whiskey to his room.<ref>Crowder, p. 138</ref> He became too drunk to perform and was unable to travel to the next stop. Nye terminated their partnership and the tour in response. The reason for the breakup could not be kept secret, and hotel staff reported to the ''[[The Courier-Journal|Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' they saw Riley in a drunken stupor walking around the hotel.<ref>Crowder, p. 139</ref> The story made national news and Riley feared his career was ruined.<ref>Van Allen, p. 227</ref>\n\nHe secretly left Louisville at night and returned to Indianapolis by train. Eitel defended him to the press to gain sympathy for Riley, explaining the abusive financial arrangements his partners had made. Riley refused to speak to reporters, however, and hid himself for weeks.<ref>Van Allen, p. 229</ref> Much to Riley's surprise, the news reports made him more popular than ever.<ref>Van Allen, p. 230</ref> Many people thought the stories were exaggerated, and Riley's carefully cultivated image made it difficult for the public to believe he was an alcoholic. Riley had stopped sending poetry to newspapers and magazines in the aftermath, but they soon began corresponding with him asking him to resume writing. This encouraged Riley, and he made another attempt to give up liquor as he returned to his public career.<ref>Van Allen, p. 231</ref>\n\nThe negative press did not end, however, as Nye and Pond threatened to sue Riley for causing their tour to end prematurely. They claimed to have lost $20,000. Walker threatened a separate suit demanding $1,000. Riley hired Indianapolis lawyer William P. Fishback to represent him and the men settled out of court.<ref>Crowder, p. 140</ref> The full details of the settlement were never disclosed, but whatever the case, Riley finally extricated himself from his old contracts and became a free agent. The exorbitant amount Riley was being sued for only reinforced public opinion that he had been mistreated by his partners and helped him maintain his image. Nye and Riley remained good friends, and Riley later wrote Pond and Walker were the source of the problems.<ref>Van Allen, p. 232</ref>\n\nRiley's poetry had become popular in Britain, in large part due to his book ''Old-Fashioned Roses''. In May 1891 he traveled to England to tour and made what he considered a literary pilgrimage. He landed in [[Liverpool]] and traveled first to [[Dumfries]], [[Scotland]], the home and burial place of [[Robert Burns]]. Riley had long been compared to Burns by critics because they both used dialect in their poetry and drew inspiration from their rural homes.<ref>Van Allen, p. 237</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 148</ref> He then traveled to [[Edinburgh]], [[York]], and London, reciting poetry for gatherings at each stop. Augustin Daly arranged for him to give a poetry reading to prominent British actors in London.<ref name=\"Crowder, p. 149\"/> Riley was warmly welcomed by its literary and theatrical community, and he toured places that [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] had frequented.<ref>Van Allen, p. 238</ref>\n\nRiley quickly tired of traveling abroad and began longing for home, writing to his nephew that he regretted having left the United States. He curtailed his journey and returned to New York City in August.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 239\">Van Allen, p. 239</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 151</ref> He spent the next months in his Greenfield home attempting to write an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]], but after several attempts gave up, believing he did not possess the ability.<ref>Van Allen, p. 228</ref>\n\nBy 1890, Riley had authored almost all his famous poems. The few poems he wrote during the 1890s were generally less well received by the public.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 239\"/> As a solution, Riley and his publishers began reusing poetry from other books and printing some of his earliest works. When ''Neighborly Poems'' was published in 1891, a critic working for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' pointed out the use of Riley's earliest works, commenting that he was using his popularity to push his crude earlier works onto the public only to make money.<ref name = v240>Van Allen, p. 240</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 153</ref> Riley's newest poems published in the 1894 book ''Armazindy'' received very negative reviews that referred to poems like \"The Little Dog-Woggy\" and \"Jargon-Jingle\" as \"drivel\" and to Riley as a \"worn out genius\".<ref name = v240/> Most of his growing number of critics suggested that he ignored the quality of the poems for the sake of making money.<ref name = v240/>\n\n===Last tours===\nAlthough Riley was wealthy from his books, he was able to triple his annual income by touring. He found the lure hard to resist and decided to return to the lecture circuit in 1892. He hired William C. Glass to assist Henry Eitel in managing his affairs. While Eitel handled the finances, Glass worked to organize his lecture tours.<ref>Van Allen, p. 243</ref> Glass worked closely with Riley's publishers to have his tours coincide with the release of new books and ensured his tours were geographically varied enough to maintain his popularity in all regions of the nation. He was careful not to book busy schedules; Riley only performed four times a week and the tours were short, lasting only three months.<ref>Van Allen p. 244</ref>\n\nDuring his 1893 tour, Riley lectured mostly in the western United States, and in his 1894 tour in the east. His performances were major events, and generally sold out within days of their announcements. In 1894 he allowed the author [[Douglass Sherley]] to join his tour. Sherley was a millionaire who published his own books. The literary community had dismissed his work, but Riley was instrumental in helping him gain acceptance.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 245\">Van Allen, p. 245</ref>\n\nIn 1895 Riley undertook his last tour, making stops in most of the major cities in the United States.<ref>Vann Allen, p. 248</ref> Advertised as his final performances, there was incredible demand for tickets and Riley performed before his largest audiences during the tour. He and Sherley continued a show very similar to those that he and Nye had done. Riley often lamented the lack of change in the program. He found when he tried to introduce new material, or left out any of his most popular poems, the crowds would demand encores until he agreed to recite their favorites.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 251\">Van Allen, p. 251</ref>\n\n===Children's poet===\n[[File:James Whitcomb RIley, The Children's Poet, 1916.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Riley seated in a chair surrounded by children|Riley holds his pet dog while posing for a photo with a group of children in front of his Indianapolis home]]\n\nFollowing the death of his father in 1894, Riley began regretting his choice not to marry or have children.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 245\"/> To compensate for this,  he became a doting uncle, showering gifts on his nieces and nephews. He had repurchased his childhood home in 1893 and allowed his divorced sister, Mary, his widowed sister-in-law, Julia, and their daughters to live in it.<ref>Crowder, p. 163</ref> He provided for all their needs and spent the summer months of 1893 living with them. He took on his nephew Edmund Eital as a personal secretary and gave him a $50,000 wedding gift in 1912. Riley was well loved by his family.<ref>Van Allen, p. 246</ref>\n\nRiley returned to live near Indianapolis later in 1893, boarding in a private home in the Lockerbie district, then a small suburb. He developed a close friendship with his landlords, the Nickum and Holstein families. The home became a destination for local schoolchildren to whom Riley would regularly recite poetry and tell stories. Riley's friends often visited his home, and he developed a closer relationship with Eugene Debs.<ref>Van Allen, p. 247</ref>\n\nThe same year, he began compiling his poems of most interest to children into a new book entitled ''Rhymes of Childhood''. The book was richly illustrated by [[Howard Chandler Christy]], and Riley wrote a few new poems for the book under the pseudonym \"Uncle Sydney.\"<ref>Crowder, p. 145</ref> ''Rhymes of Childhood'' became Riley's best selling book, and sold millions of copies. It has remained in print continually since 1912 and helped earn him the nickname the \"Children's Poet\". Even Riley's rival, Clemens, commented that the book was \"charming\" and made him weep for his \"lost youth\".<ref>Van Allen, p. 236</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Later life==\n\n===National poet===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    = \n | width     = 220\n | image1    = James Whitcomb Riley, 1913, Cincinnati.jpg\n | alt1      = Smiling old man with round glasses wearing a hat\n | caption1  = Riley at a Riley Day celebration in [[Cincinnati]] in 1913.\n | image2    = James Whitcomb Riley House in Indianapolis, front and western side.jpg\n | alt2      = A large brick house surrounded by trees\n | caption2  = The [[James Whitcomb Riley Museum Home]], Riley's Indianapolis home during the last decade of his life.\n | image3    =\n | alt3      = Six white columns atop a hill\n | caption3  = Tomb of James Whitcomb Riley at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis\n}}\n[[File:James Whitcomb Riley.png|thumb|7 volumes of the Complete Works of James Whitcomb Riley]]\nRiley had become very wealthy by the time he stopped touring in 1895 and was earning $1,000 a week.<ref>Van Allen, p. 250</ref> Although he retired, he continued to make minor appearances. In 1896, Riley performed four shows in [[Denver]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 249</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 179</ref> Most of the performances of his later life were at civic celebrations. He was a regular speaker at [[Memorial Day|Decoration Day]] events and delivered poetry before the unveiling of monuments in Washington, D.C. Newspapers began referring to him as the \"National Poet\", \"the poet laureate of America\", and \"the people's poet laureate\".<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 251\"/> Riley wrote many of his patriotic poems for such events, including \"The Soldier\", \"The Name of Old Glory\", and his most famous such poem, \"America!\". The 1902 poem \"America, Messiah of Nations\" was written and read by Riley for the dedication of the [[Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument (Indianapolis)|Indianapolis Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 253</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 203</ref>\n\nThe only new poetry Riley published after the end of the century were [[elegy|elegies]] for famous friends. The poetic qualities of the poems were often poor, but they contained many popular sentiments concerning the deceased. Among those he eulogized were Benjamin Harrison, Lew Wallace, and Henry Lawton. Because of the poor quality of the poems, his friends and publishers asked that he stop writing them, but he refused.<ref>Van Allen, p. 254</ref>\n\nIn 1897, Riley's publishers suggested that he create a multi-volume series of books containing his complete life works.<ref>Crowder, p. 187</ref> With the help of his nephew, Riley began working to compile the books. There were eventually sixteen volumes, which were finally completed in 1914. Such works were uncommon during the lives of writers, attesting to the uncommon popularity Riley had achieved.<ref name = v242>Van Allen, p. 242</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 189</ref>\n\nHis works had become staples for Ivy League literature courses and universities began offering him honorary degrees. The first was [[Yale]] in 1902, followed by a Doctorate of Letters from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1904. [[Wabash College]] and [[Indiana University]] granted him similar awards.<ref>Crowder, pp. 206, 210, 224</ref> In 1908 he was elected a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters|National Institute of Arts and Letters]]; in 1912 they conferred upon him a special medal for poetry.<ref name = v242/><ref>Crowder, p. 234</ref>\n\nRiley was influential in helping other poets start their careers, having particularly strong influences on Hamlin Garland, [[William Allen White]], and [[Edgar Lee Masters]]. He discovered aspiring African-American poet [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]] in 1892. Riley thought Dunbar's work was \"worthy of applause\" and wrote him letters of recommendation to help him get his work published.<ref name=\"v242\"/>\n\n===Declining health===\nIn 1901, Riley's doctor diagnosed him with [[neurasthenia]], a nervous disorder, and recommended long periods of rest as a cure.<ref>Van Allen, p. 255</ref> Riley remained ill for the rest of his life and relied on his landlords and family to aid in his care. During the winter months he moved to Miami, Florida, and during summer spent time with his family in Greenfield. He made only a few trips during the decade, including one to [[Mexico]] in 1906. He became very depressed by his condition, writing to his friends that he thought he could die at any moment, and often used alcohol for relief.<ref name = v256>Van Allen, p. 256</ref>\n\nIn March 1909, Riley was stricken a second time with Bell's palsy and partial deafness, the symptoms only gradually eased over the course of the year.<ref>Crowder, p. 228</ref> He was a difficult patient, and generally refused to take any medicine except the patent medicines he had sold in his earlier years; the medicines often worsened his conditions, but his doctors could not sway his opinion.<ref>Crowder, p. 233</ref> On July 10, 1910, he suffered a stroke that paralyzed the right side of his body. Hoping for a quick recovery, his family kept the news from the press until September. Riley found the loss of use of his writing hand the worst part of the stroke, which served only to further depress him.<ref name = v256/><ref>Crowder, p. 232</ref> With his health so poor, he decided to work on a legacy by which to be remembered in Indianapolis. In 1911 he donated land and funds to build a new library on Pennsylvania Avenue.<ref name = v257>Van Allen, p. 257</ref> By 1913, with the aid of a cane, Riley began recovering his ability to walk. His inability to write, however, nearly ended his production of poems. [[George Ade]] worked with him from 1910 through 1916 to write his last five poems and several short autobiographical sketches as Riley dictated. His publisher continued recycling old works into new books, which remained in high demand.<ref name = v257/>\n\nSince the mid-1880s, Riley had been the nation's most read poet, a trend that accelerated at the turn of the century. In 1912 Riley recorded readings of his most popular poetry to be sold by the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]]. He was the subject of three paintings by [[T. C. Steele]]. The Indianapolis Arts Association commissioned a portrait of Riley to be created by the world-famous painter [[John Singer Sargent]]. His image became a nationally known icon and many businesses capitalized on his popularity to sell their products; Hoosier Poet brand vegetables became a major trade-name in the Midwest.<ref>Van Allen, p. 258</ref>\n\nIn 1912, the governor of Indiana instituted Riley Day on the poet's birthday. Schools were required to teach Riley's poems to their pupils, and banquet events were held in his honor around the state. In 1915 and 1916 the celebration was national after being proclaimed in most states. The annual celebration continued in Indiana until 1968.<ref>Van Allen, p. 259</ref> In early 1916 Riley was filmed as part of a movie to celebrate Indiana's centennial, the video is on display at the Indiana State Library.<ref>Van Allen, p. 261</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 252</ref>\n\n===Death and legacy===\n[[File:Riley8394.JPG|thumb|right|alt=see caption|Statue by [[Myra Reynolds Richards]] honoring James Whitcomb Riley on courthouse lawn in [[Greenfield, Indiana|Greenfield]], Indiana.]]\n\nOn July 22, 1916, Riley suffered a second stroke. He recovered enough during the day to speak and joke with his companions. He died before dawn on July 23.<ref>Van Allen, p. 262</ref> Riley's death shocked the nation and made front page headlines in major newspapers.<ref>Van Allen, p. 1</ref> President [[Woodrow Wilson]] wrote a brief note to Riley's family offering condolences on behalf of the entire nation. Indiana Governor [[Samuel M. Ralston]] offered to allow Riley to lie in state at the [[Indiana Statehouse]]\u2014[[Abraham Lincoln]] is the only other person to have previously received such an honor.<ref>Van Allen, p. 2</ref> During the ten hours he lay in state on July 24, more than thirty-five thousand people filed past his bronze casket; the line was still miles long at the end of the day, and thousands were turned away. The next day a private funeral ceremony was held and attended by many dignitaries. A large funeral procession then carried him to [[Crown Hill Cemetery]] where he was buried in a tomb at the top of the hill, the highest point in the city of Indianapolis.<ref>Van Allen, p. 3</ref>\n\nWithin a year of Riley's death, many memorials were created, including several by the James Whitcomb Riley Memorial Association. The [[James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children]] was created and named in his honor by a group of wealthy benefactors and opened in 1924. In the following years, other memorials intended to benefit children were created, including Camp Riley for youth with disabilities.<ref>Van Allen, p. 4</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rileykids.org/Camp|title= Camp Riley|publisher=Riley Kids.org|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe memorial foundation purchased the poet's Lockerbie home in Indianapolis, and it is now maintained as a museum. The [[James Whitcomb Riley Museum Home]] is the only late-Victorian home in Indiana that is open to the public. It is the United States' only late-Victorian preservation, featuring authentic furniture and decor from that era. His birthplace and boyhood home, now the James Whitcomb Riley House, is preserved as a historical site.<ref>Van Allen, p. 272</ref> A [[Liberty ship]] commissioned April 23, 1942, was christened the ''SS James Whitcomb Riley''. It served with the [[United States Maritime Commission]] until being scrapped in 1971.\n\n[[James Whitcomb Riley High School]] opened in South Bend, Indiana, in 1924. In 1950, there was a James Whitcomb Riley Elementary School in [[Hammond, Indiana]], but it was torn down in 2006. [[East Chicago, Indiana]], had a Riley School at one time, as did neighboring [[Gary, Indiana]], and Anderson, Indiana.  One of New Castle, Indiana's, elementary schools is named for Riley<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nccsc.k12.in.us/index.php/schoolstop/elementarytop/rileymoodletop.html |title=Riley Elementary |accessdate=August 30, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002161825/http://www.nccsc.k12.in.us/index.php/schoolstop/elementarytop/rileymoodletop.html |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> as is the road<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Riley+Road,+New+Castle,+IN/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x881533388b97518f:0x3c2c06d66ea9eefa?hl=en&dg=dbrw&newdg=1|title=Riley Road Google Maps|publisher=Google|accessdate=May 3, 2019}}</ref> on which it is located along with Riley Elementary School in La Porte, Indiana.

Taking place the first or second weekend of October, the \"Riley Days\" festival traditionally commences with a flower parade in which local school children place flowers around [[Myra Reynolds Richards]]' statue of Riley on the county courthouse lawn, while a band plays lively music in honor of the poet. Weeks before the festival, the festival board has a queen contest. The pageant has been going on many years in honor of the Hoosier poet<ref>Van Allen, p. 274</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Elizabeth Van Allen, Riley was instrumental in helping form a Midwestern cultural identity. The Midwestern United States had no significant literary community before the 1880s.<ref>Van Allen, p. 269</ref> The works of the Western Association of Writers, most notably those of Riley and Wallace, helped create the Midwest's cultural identity and rival literary community to the established eastern literati. For this reason and the publicity Riley's work created, he was commonly known as the \"Hoosier Poet\".<ref>Van Allen, p. 270</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 255</ref>\n\n==Critical reception and style==\nRiley was among the most popular writers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, known for his \"uncomplicated, sentimental, and humorous\" writing.<ref name = Centage/> Often writing his verses in dialect, his poetry caused readers to recall a nostalgic and simpler time in earlier American history. This gave his poetry a unique appeal during a period of rapid industrialization and [[urbanization in the United States]]. Riley was a prolific writer who \"achieved mass appeal partly due to his canny sense of marketing and publicity\".<ref name = Centage/> He published more than fifty books, mostly of poetry and humorous short stories, and sold millions of copies.<ref name = Centage/>\n\nHe is often remembered for his most famous poems, including \"The Raggedy Man\" and \"Little Orphant Annie\". Many of his poems used events and people from his childhood as an inspiration for subject their matter.<ref name = Centage>{{cite book|title=Poetry Criticism|editor=Galens, David|volume=48|publisher= Gale Cengage|year= 2003|pages=210\u2013212}}</ref> His poems often contain morals and warnings for children, with messages telling children to care for the less fortunate of society. David Galens and Van Allen both see these messages as Riley's subtle response to the turbulent economic times of the [[Gilded Age]] and the growing [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 235</ref> Riley believed that urbanization robbed children of their innocence and sincerity, and in his poems he attempted to introduce and idolize characters who had not lost those qualities.<ref>Van Allen, p. 234</ref> His children's poems are \"exuberant, performative, and often display Riley's penchant for using humorous characterization, repetition, and dialect to make his poetry accessible to a wide-ranging audience\".<ref name = Centage/><ref name = g434>Greasley, p. 434</ref>\n\nAlthough hinted at indirectly in some poems, Riley wrote very little on serious subjects, and mocked attempts at serious poetry. Only a few of his sentimental poems concern serious subjects. \"Little Mandy's Christmas-Tree\", \"The Absence of Little Wesley\", and \"The Happy Little Cripple\" are about poverty, the death of a child, and disabilities. Like his children's poems, they also contain morals, suggesting society should pity the downtrodden and be charitable.<ref name = Centage/><ref name = g434/>\n\nRiley wrote gentle and romantic poems that were not in dialect. They generally consist of sonnets and are strongly influenced by the works of [[John Greenleaf Whittier]], Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]. His standard English poetry was never as popular as his Hoosier dialect poems.<ref name = Centage/> Still less popular were the poems Riley wrote in his later years; most were to commemorate important events in American history or to eulogize the dead.<ref name = Centage/>\n\nRiley's contemporaries acclaimed him \"America's best-loved poet\".<ref name = Centage/><ref name = g434/> In 1920, Henry Beers lauded the works of Riley \"as natural and unaffected, with none of the discontent and deep thought of cultured song\".<ref name = Centage/> Samuel Clemens, [[William Dean Howells]], and Hamlin Garland, each praised Riley's work and the idealism he expressed in his poetry. Only a few critics of the period found fault with Riley's works. [[Ambrose Bierce]] criticized Riley for his frequent use of dialect. He accused Riley of using dialect to \"cover up [the] faulty construction\" of his poems.<ref name = Centage/> Edgar Lee Masters found Riley's work to be superficial, claiming it lacked irony and that he had only a \"narrow emotional range\".<ref name = Centage/> By the 1930s popular critical opinion towards Riley's works began to shift in favor of the negative reviews. In 1951, [[James T. Farrell]] said Riley's works were \"cliched\". Galens wrote modern critics consider Riley to be a \"minor poet, whose work\u2014provincial, sentimental, and superficial though it may have been\u2014nevertheless struck a chord with a mass audience in a time of enormous cultural change\".<ref name = Centage/> Thomas C. Johnson wrote that what most interests modern critics was Riley's ability to market his work, saying he had a unique understanding of \"how to commodify his own image and the nostalgic dreams of an anxious nation\".<ref name = Centage/>\n\nAmong the earliest widespread criticisms of Riley were opinions that his dialect writing did not actually represent the true dialect of central Indiana. In 1970 Peter Revell wrote Riley's dialect was more like the poor speech of a child rather than the dialect of his region. He made extensive comparisons to historical texts and Riley's dialect usage. Philip Greasley wrote that while \"some critics have dismissed him as sub-literary, insincere, and an artificial entertainer, his defenders reply that an author so popular with millions of people in different walks of life must contribute something of value, and that his faults, if any, can be ignored\".<ref name = g434/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indiana|Poetry|Children's literature}}\n*[[American poetry]]\n*[[Golden Age of Indiana Literature]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"n\"/>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis|author=Bodenhamer, David J.|author2=Robert Graham Barrows|author3=David Gordon Vanderstel|year=1994|publisher=[[Indiana University]] Press|isbn=0-253-31222-1}}\n* Cottman, George S.

During his lifetime he was known as the \"[[Hoosier]] Poet\" and \"Children's Poet\" for his [[dialect]] works and his children's poetry. His poems tend to be humorous or sentimental. Of the approximately 1,000 poems Riley wrote, the majority are in dialect. His famous works include \"[[Little Orphant Annie]]\" and \"[[The Raggedy Man]]\".\n\nRiley began his career writing verses as a sign maker and submitting poetry to newspapers. Thanks in part to poet [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s endorsement, he eventually earned successive jobs at Indiana newspaper publishers during the late 1870s. He gradually rose to prominence during the 1880s through his poetry reading tours. He traveled a touring circuit first in the [[Midwest]], and then nationally, appearing either alone or with other famous talents. During this period Riley's long-term addiction to alcohol began to affect his performing abilities, and he suffered financially as a result.  However, once he extricated himself from a series of poorly negotiated contracts that sought to limit his earnings, he began to accumulate wealth and eventually became a financial success.\n\nBy the 1890s, Riley had become known as a bestselling author. His children's poems were compiled into a book illustrated by [[Howard Chandler Christy]]. Titled ''Rhymes of Childhood'', it was his most popular and sold millions of copies. As a poet, Riley achieved an uncommon level of fame during his lifetime. He was honored with annual Riley Day celebrations around the United States and was regularly called on to perform readings at national civic events. He continued to write and hold occasional poetry readings until a stroke [[paralysis|paralyzed]] his right arm in 1910.\n\nRiley's chief legacy was his influence in fostering the creation of a Midwestern cultural identity and his contributions to the [[Golden Age of Indiana Literature]]. With other writers of his era, he helped create a caricature of Midwesterners and formed a literary community that produced works rivaling the established eastern literati. There are many memorials dedicated to Riley, including the [[James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children]].\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:James Whitcomb Riley.jpg|thumb|James Whitcomb Riley, [[John Singer Sargent]], 1903]]\n\n===Family and background===\nJames Whitcomb Riley was born on October 7, 1849, in the town of [[Greenfield, Indiana]], the third of the six children of Reuben Andrew and Elizabeth Marine Riley.<ref>Van Allen, p. 17</ref><ref group = n>Coincidentally, Riley was born on the day of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s death. (see: Van Allen, p. 2)</ref> Riley's father was an attorney, and in the year before his birth, he was elected a member of the Indiana House of Representatives as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]]. He developed a friendship with [[James Whitcomb]], the governor of Indiana, after whom he named his son.<ref name = v29>Van Allen, p. 29</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 30</ref> Martin Riley, Riley's uncle, was an amateur poet who occasionally wrote verses for local newspapers. Riley was fond of his uncle who influenced his interest in poetry.<ref>Crowder, p. 31</ref>\n\nShortly after his birth, the family moved into a larger house in town.<ref>Crowder, p. 28</ref> Riley was \"a quiet boy, not talkative, who would often go about with one eye shut as he observed and speculated\".<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 35\">Van Allen, p. 35</ref> His mother taught him to read and write at home before sending him to the local community school in 1852.<ref>Van Allen, 39</ref> He found school difficult and was frequently in trouble. Often punished, he had nothing kind to say of his teachers in his writings. His poem \"The Educator\" tells of an intelligent but sinister teacher and may have been based on one of his instructors.<ref>Van Allen, p. 40</ref><ref name=Bodenhamer1195/> Riley was most fond of his last teacher, Lee O. Harris. Harris noticed Riley's interest in poetry and reading and encouraged him to pursue it further.<ref>Van Allen, p. 43</ref>\n\nRiley's school attendance was sporadic, and he graduated from [[grade eight]] at age 20 in 1869. In an 1892 newspaper article, Riley confessed he knew little of mathematics, geography, or science, and his understanding of proper grammar was poor.<ref>Van Allen, p. 44</ref> Later critics, like Henry Beers, pointed to his poor education as the reason for his success in writing; his prose was written in the language of common people which spurred his popularity.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 46\">Van Allen, p. 46</ref>\n\n===Childhood influences===\n[[File:OldSwimmingHole GreenfieldIN.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A stream of water surrounded by trees|\"The Old Swimming Hole\" that appears in Riley's poems is now a large and well-used park on the east side of Greenfield.]]\n\nRiley lived in [[Riley Birthplace and Museum|his parents' home]] until he was 21 years old. At age five, he began spending time at the Brandywine Creek near Greenfield. His poems \"A Barefoot Boy\" and \"[[The Old Swimmin' Hole (poem)|The Old Swimmin' Hole]]\" refer to his time there.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 35\"/> As a child he was introduced to many people who later influenced his poetry. His father regularly brought home clients and disadvantaged people to help them. Riley's poem \"The Raggedy Man\" is based on a German tramp his father hired to work at the family home.<ref name = v29/> Riley picked up the cadence and character of the [[dialect]] of central Indiana from travelers along the old [[National Road]]. Their speech greatly influenced the hundreds of poems he wrote in 19th century [[Hoosier]] dialect.<ref>Van Allen, p. 34</ref>\n\nHis mother often told him stories of fairies, [[troll]]s, and giants, and read him children's poems. She was very superstitious and influenced Riley with many of her beliefs. They both placed \"spirit rappings\" in their homes on places like tables and [[Chest of drawers|bureaux]] to capture any spirits that may have been wandering about. This influence can be found in many of his works, including \"Flying Islands of the Night\".<ref>Van Allen, p. 36</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 155</ref>\n\nAs was common at that time, Riley and his friends had few toys, and amused themselves with activities. With his mother's help, Riley began creating plays and theatricals, which he and his friends would practice and perform in the back of a local grocery store. As he grew older, the boys named their troupe the Adelphians and began to hold their shows in barns where they could fit larger audiences.<ref>Crowder, p. 46\u201348</ref> Riley wrote of these early performances in his poem \"When We First Played 'Show{{'}}\", referring to himself as \"Jamesy\".<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 37\">Van Allen, p. 37</ref>\n\n{{Listen|filename=Anniecomp.ogg|title=\"Little Orphant Annie\"|description=A 1912 [[phonograph]] recording of Riley reading his famous poem, \"[[Little Orphant Annie]].\"|format=[[Ogg]]|pos=left}}\n\nMany of Riley's poems are filled with musical references. He had no musical education and was unable to read [[sheet music]]. His father taught him to play the guitar, and a friend taught him the violin. He performed in two different local bands and became so proficient on the violin he was invited to play with a group of adult [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] at several events. A few of his later poems were set to music and song, one of the most well known being [[Shortnin' Bread|A Short'nin' Bread Song\u2014Pieced Out]].<ref>Van Allen, pp. 37\u201338</ref>\n\nWhen Riley was 10 years old, the first library opened in his hometown. From an early age he developed a love of literature. He and his friends spent time at the library where the librarian read stories and poems to them. [[Charles Dickens]] became one Riley's favorites and inspired the poems \"St. Lirriper\", \"Christmas Season\", and \"God Bless Us Every One\".<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 37\"/>\n\nRiley's father enlisted in the [[Union Army]] during the [[American Civil War]], leaving his wife to manage the family home. While he was away, the family took in a 12-year-old orphan named Mary Alice \"Allie\" Smith. She was the inspiration for Riley's poem \"[[Little Orphant Annie]]\". Riley had intended titling the poem \"Little Orphant Allie\", but a [[Typesetting|typesetter]]'s error changed it during printing.<ref name=Bodenhamer1195>Bodenhamer, 1195</ref><ref>Van Allen, p. 33</ref><ref name = IU>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~liblilly/riley/docs/1_raggedy.html|title= The Raggedy Man and Little Orphant Annie|publisher=[[Indiana University]]|accessdate=2010-01-08}}</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 38</ref>\n\n===Finding poetry===\nRiley's father returned from the war partially paralyzed. He was unable to continue working in his legal practice, and the family soon fell into financial distress. The war's negative affects soon caused his relationship with his family to deteriorate. He opposed Riley's interest in poetry and encouraged him to find a different career. The family finances finally disintegrated. They were forced to sell their town home in April 1870 and return to their country farm.<ref>Van Allen, p. 45</ref> Riley's mother was able to keep peace in the family, but after her death in August from [[heart disease]], Riley and his father had a final break. He blamed his mother's death on his father's failure to care for her in her final weeks.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 46\"/><ref>Crowder, p. 52</ref> He continued to regret the loss of his childhood home. He wrote frequently of how it was so cruelly snatched from him by the war, subsequent poverty and his mother's death. After the events of 1870, he developed an addiction to alcohol and struggled with it for the rest of his life.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 46\"/><ref>Crowder, p. 53</ref>\n\n[[File:James Whitcomb Riley, house and sign painted advertisement, 1871.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Sign advertising painting services|A sign Riley created advertising his services as a sign painter.]]\n\nBecoming increasingly belligerent toward his father, Riley moved out of the family home and briefly took a job painting houses before leaving Greenfield in November 1870. He was recruited as a Bible salesman and began working in the nearby town of [[Rushville, Indiana]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 51</ref> The job provided little income and he returned to Greenfield in March 1871 where he started an apprenticeship to a painter. He completed it and opened a business in Greenfield creating and maintaining signs. His earliest known poems are verses he wrote as clever advertisements for his customers.<ref>Van Allen, p. 55</ref>\n\nRiley began participating in local theater productions with the Adelphians to earn extra income. During the winter months, when the demand for painting declined, Riley began writing poetry which he mailed to his brother who lived in Indianapolis. He acted as Riley's agent and offered the poems to the ''Indianapolis Mirror'' newspaper free of charge. His first poem was featured on March 30, 1872, under the pseudonym \"Jay Whit\".<ref name = v56/> Riley wrote more than 20 poems to the newspaper, including one that was featured on the front page.<ref name = v56>Van Allen, p. 56</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 56</ref>\n\nIn July 1872, after becoming convinced sales would provide more income than sign painting, he joined the McCrillus Company based in [[Anderson, Indiana]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 58</ref> The company sold [[patent medicine]]s that they marketed using small traveling shows around Indiana. Riley joined the act as a [[huckster]], calling himself the \"Painter Poet\". He traveled with the act, composing poetry and performing at the shows.<ref>Van Allen, p. 59</ref><ref>Crowder, pp. 56\u201357</ref> After his act he sold tonics to his audience, sometimes employing dishonesty. During one stop, Riley presented himself as a formerly blind painter who had been cured by a tonic, using himself as evidence to encourage the audience to purchase it.<ref>Van Allen, p. 61</ref>\n\nRiley began sending poems to his brother again in February 1873. About the same time he and several friends began an advertisement company.<ref>Van Allen, p. 65</ref> The men traveled around Indiana creating large billboard-like signs on the sides of buildings and barns and in high places that were visible from a distance.<ref>Van Allen, p. 66</ref> The company was financially successful, but Riley was continually drawn to poetry. In October, he traveled to [[South Bend, Indiana|South Bend]] where he took a job at Stockford & Blowney painting verses on signs for a month; the shortness of his stay at this job may have been due to his frequent drunkenness at that time.<ref>Van Allen, p. 69</ref>\n\nIn early 1874, Riley returned to Greenfield to become a full-time writer.<ref>Van Allen, p. 70</ref> In February, he submitted a poem titled \"At Last\" to a Connecticut newspaper the ''Danbury News''.<ref>Crowder, p. 64</ref> The editors accepted it, paid him for it, and wrote him a letter encouraging him to submit more. Riley found the note and his first payment inspiring.<ref>Van Allen, p. 71</ref> He began submitting poems regularly to the editors,<ref>Van Allen, p. 75</ref> but after the newspaper shut down in 1875, Riley was left without a paying publisher. He began traveling and performing with the Adelphians around central Indiana to earn an income while he searched for a new publisher. In August 1875, he joined another traveling tonic show run by the [[Hamlin's Wizard Oil|Wizard Oil Company]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 77</ref><ref group = n>Riley remained with the Wizard Oil Company until late 1877. During his time there, he made the acquaintance of [[Paul Dresser]]. (see: Crowder, p. 68)</ref>\n\n==Early career==\n\n===Newspaper work===\nRiley began writing to the well-known American poet [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]] during late 1875 seeking his endorsement to help him start a career as a poet.<ref>Van Allen, p. 86</ref> He submitted many poems to Longfellow, whom he considered the greatest living poet. Not receiving a prompt response, he sent similar letters to [[John Townsend Trowbridge]] and several other prominent writers asking for an endorsement.<ref>Van Allen, p. 89</ref> Longfellow finally replied in a brief letter, telling Riley, \"I have read [the poems] in great pleasure, and think they show a true poetic faculty and insight.\"<ref>Van Allen, p. 91</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 75</ref> Riley carried the letter with him everywhere and, hoping to receive a job offer and to create a market for his poetry, he began sending poems to dozens of newspapers touting Longfellow's endorsement. Among the newspapers to take an interest in his poems was the ''[[Indianapolis Journal]]'', a major [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Party metropolitan newspaper in Indiana. Among the first poems it purchased from him were \"Song of the New Year\", \"An Empty Nest\", and a short story entitled \"A Remarkable Man\".<ref>Van Allen, p. 93</ref>\n\nThe editors of the ''Anderson Democrat'' discovered Riley's poems in the ''Indianapolis Journal'' and offered him a job as a reporter in February 1877.<ref>Van Allen, p. 95</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 76</ref> Riley accepted. He worked gathering local news, writing articles, and assisting with typesetting. He continued to write poems regularly for the newspaper and to sell other poems to larger newspapers.<ref>Van Allen, p. 96</ref> During the year, Riley spent working in [[Anderson, Indiana|Anderson]], he met and courted Edora Mysers. The couple became engaged, but ended the relationship after they had decided against marriage in August.<ref>Van Allen, p. 97</ref>\n\nDespite local success at having his poems published, his submissions continued to be rejected by established eastern periodicals as being below their standards. Riley began formulating a plot to prove his work was of good quality and that it was being rejected only because his name was unknown in the east. He wrote a poem imitating the style of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and submitted it to the ''Kokomo Dispatch'' under a fictitious name claiming it was a long-lost Poe poem. The ''Dispatch'' published the poem and reported it as such.<ref>Van Allen, p. 102</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 79</ref> Riley and two other men who were part of the plot waited two weeks for the poem to be published by major newspapers in Chicago, Boston, and New York to gauge their reaction; they were disappointed. While a few newspapers believed the poem was authentic, most did not, claiming the quality was too poor to be written by Poe.<ref>Van Allen, p. 105</ref> A ''Dispatch'' employee learned the truth of the incident and reported it to the ''Kokomo Tribune'', which published an expos\u00e9 that outed Riley as a conspirator behind the hoax. The revelation damaged the ''Dispatch''{{'}}s credibility and harmed Riley's reputation.<ref>Van Allen, p. 106</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 82</ref>\n\nIn the aftermath of the Poe plot, Riley was dismissed from the ''Democrat''. He returned to Greenfield to spend time writing poetry.<ref>Van Allen, p. 112</ref> He met Clara Louise Bottsford, a school teacher boarding in his father's home. They found they had much in common, particularly their love of literature. The couple began a 12-year, intermittent relationship, Riley's longest.<ref>Van Allen, p. 115</ref> In mid-1878, the couple had their first breakup caused partly by Riley's alcoholism. Riley made a first attempt to give up liquor by joining a local [[temperance movement|temperance]] organization but quit after a few weeks.<ref>Van Allen, p. 116</ref>\n\n===Performing poet===\nWithout a steady income, his financial situation worsened. Riley began submitting his poems to more prominent literary magazines, including ''[[Scribner's Monthly]]'', but was informed that although it showed promise, his work was still short of the standards required for use in their publications.<ref>Van Allen, p. 117</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 83</ref> Locally, he was still dealing with the stigma of the Poe plot. The ''Indianapolis Journal'' and other newspapers refused to accept his poetry, leaving him desperate for income. On the advice of a friend, in January 1878 Riley paid an entrance fee to join a traveling lecture circuit where he could give poetry readings. In exchange, he received a portion of the profit his performances earned. These circuits were popular at the time, and Riley quickly earned a local reputation for his entertaining readings.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 118\">Van Allen, p. 118</ref>\n\nIn August 1878, he followed Indiana Governor [[James D. Williams]] as speaker at a civic event in a small town near Indianapolis. He recited a recently composed poem, \"A Childhood Home of Long Ago\", telling of life in pioneer Indiana. The poem was well received and was given good reviews by several newspapers.<ref>Van Allen, p. 122</ref>\n\n''Flying Islands of the Night'' is the only play Riley wrote and published. Written while he was traveling with the Adelphians but never performed, the play has similarities to ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'', which Riley may have used as a model.<ref>Van Allen, p. 125</ref> It  concerns a kingdom besieged by evil forces of a sinister queen who is defeated eventually by an angel-like heroine.<ref>Van Allen, p. 128</ref> Most reviews were positive. Riley published the play, and it became popular in the central Indiana area during late 1878, helping him to convince newspapers to accept his poetry again. In November 1879, he was offered a position as a columnist at the ''Indianapolis Journal'' and accepted after being encouraged by E.B. Matindale, the paper's chief editor.<ref>Van Allen, p. 132</ref>\n\nAlthough the play and his newspaper work helped expose him to a wider audience, the chief source of his increasing popularity was his performances on the lecture circuit. He gave both dramatic and comedic readings of his poetry, and by early 1879 could guarantee large crowds when he performed.<ref>Van Allen, p. 136</ref> In an 1894 article, [[Hamlin Garland]] wrote that Riley's celebrity resulted from his reading talent saying, \"his vibrant individual voice, his flexible lips, his droll glance, united to make him at once poet and comedian\u2014comedian in the sense in which makes for tears as well as for laughter\".<ref>{{cite book|title=Real Conversations: A Dialogue Between James Whitcomb Riley and Hamlin Garland.|author=Hamlin, Garland|date=February 1894|pages=2\u20133|publisher=McClure's Magazine}}</ref> Although he was a good performer, his acts were not entirely original in style; he frequently copied practices developed by [[Mark Twain|Samuel Clemens]] and [[Will Carleton]].<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 137\">Van Allen, p. 137</ref> His tour in 1880 took him to every city in Indiana where he was introduced by local dignitaries and other popular figures, including novelist [[Maurice Thompson]] with whom he began to develop a close friendship.<ref>Van Allen, p. 158</ref>\n\nDeveloping and maintaining publicity became a constant job requiring more of his attention as his fame grew. Keeping his alcohol addiction secret, maintaining the persona of a simple rural poet and a friendly common person became most important.<ref>Van Allen, p. 48</ref> Riley identified these traits as the basis of his popularity during the mid-1880s and wrote of his need to maintain a fictional persona.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 137\"/> He encouraged the stereotype by writing poetry he thought would help build his identity. He was aided by editorials he wrote and submitted to the ''Indianapolis Journal'' offering observations on events from his perspective as a \"humble rural poet\".<ref name = v139/> He changed his appearance to look more mainstream, and began by shaving his mustache off and abandoning the flamboyant dress he employed in his early circuit tours.<ref>Van Allen, p. 151</ref>\n\nBy 1880 his poems were published nationally and receiving positive reviews. \"Tom Johnson's Quit\" was carried by newspapers in twenty states, thanks in part to the careful cultivation of his popularity.<ref name = v139>Van Allen, p. 139</ref> Riley became frustrated that despite his growing acclaim he found it difficult to achieve financial success.<ref>Van Allen, p. 148</ref> In the early 1880s, in addition to his steady performing, Riley began producing many poems to increase his income. Half of his poems were written during this period. The constant labor had adverse effects on his health, which was worsened by his drinking. At the urging of Maurice Thompson, he again attempted to stop drinking liquor, but was unable to give it up for more than a few months.<ref>Van Allen, p. 146</ref>\n\n==''Indianapolis Journal''==\n\n===Newspaper poet===\nRiley moved to Indianapolis at the end of 1879 to begin his employment with the ''Indianapolis Journal''. It was the only metropolitan newspaper there with daily editions and had a wide readership. He wrote a regular society column that often included verses of poetry.<ref>Van Allen, p. 154</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 95</ref> Thereafter Riley met many prominent people and began a close friendship with [[Eugene V. Debs]].<ref>Crowder, p. 93</ref> He enjoyed Riley's works and often complimented his sentiments.<ref>Crowder, p. 94</ref> Riley had used the pseudonym \"Jay Whit\" since he began writing poetry but finally began to use his own name in April 1881.<ref>Crowder, p. 104</ref>\n\nRiley renewed his relationship with Bottsford in 1880, and the two corresponded frequently. Their relationship remained unstable, but Riley became deeply attached to her. She inspired his poem \"The Werewife\", which told of a perfect wife who could suddenly become a demonic monster.<ref>Van Allen, p. 157</ref> Bottsford pressed Riley for marriage several times, but he refused.<ref>Van Allen, p. 165</ref> They broke off their relationship a second time in 1881 when she discovered his correspondence with two other women,<ref>Van Allen, p. 166</ref> and found he had taken a secret vacation to [[Wisconsin]] with one of them.<ref>Crowder, p. 100</ref>\n\nRiley's alcoholism influenced some of his poems during his time working for the ''Journal''. These included \"On Quitting California\", \"John Golliher's Third Womern\", ''[sic]'' and \"The Dismal Fate of Tit\", which each refer to the delirium caused by drinking.<ref>Van Allen, p. 160</ref> Although Riley rarely published anything controversial, some of his poems published from the same period, including \"Afterwhiles\", allude to drug usage and make vague sexual references.<ref>Van Allen, p. 162</ref> During the early 1880s, Riley still made submissions to the elite literary periodicals, but continued to be rejected. Riley found this discouraging, but persevered. He believed he would never be recognized as a true literary figure until one of the prestigious periodicals published his work.<ref>Van Allen, p. 163</ref>\n\n===Lyceum circuit===\nRiley undertook occasional reading tours around Indiana, and in August 1880 he was invited to perform at [[Asbury University]]. His performance there so impressed the local [[Phi Kappa Psi]] chapter, he was invited to join as an honorary member.<ref>Crowder, p. 111</ref> Through the fraternity he met [[Robert Jones Burdette]], a writer and minister in the Indianapolis area. Burdette was a member of the [[James Redpath|Redpath Lyceum Bureau]] of Boston, a prominent lecture circuit whose regular speakers included [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 174</ref> Burdette encouraged Riley to join the circuit through its Chicago branch.<ref>Crowder, p. 105</ref> Riley's accumulated debt and low income began causing him trouble in 1881, and he decided that rejoining a lecture circuit would provide much needed funds.<ref>Crowder, p. 112</ref> His agreement for continued employment with the circuit depended on his ability to draw audiences during the first season, beginning in April 1881. He succeeded, drawing the largest crowds in Chicago and [[Indianapolis]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 176</ref>\n\nBecause of his success in the Midwest, the circuit leaders invited him to make an east coast tour, starting in [[Boston]] at the [[Tremont Temple]] in February 1882.<ref>Van Allen, pp. 178\u2013179</ref> Riley agreed, signing a ten-year agreement and granting half his receipts to his agent.<ref>Crowder, p. 119</ref> Before his performance, he traveled to [[Longfellow House\u2013Washington's Headquarters National Historic Site|Longfellow's home]] in [[Massachusetts]] and convinced him to agree to a meeting. Their brief meeting was one of Riley's fondest memories, and he wrote a lengthy article about it after Longfellow's death only a month later.<ref>Van Allen, p. 180\u2013183</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 106</ref> Longfellow encouraged Riley to focus on poetry and gave him advice for his upcoming performance where Riley was well received. His poems were greeted with laughter and praised in the city's newspaper reviews.<ref>Van Allen, p. 184</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 107</ref> Boston was the literary center of the United States at the time, and the impression Riley made on the city's literary community finally encouraged prestigious periodicals to  publish his work. ''[[The Century Magazine]]'' was the first to do so, running \"In Swimming-Time\" in its September 1883 issue.<ref>Van Allen, p. 185</ref> Until the 1890s, it remained the only major literary magazine to publish Riley's work. Knowing the high standards of the magazine, Riley reserved his best work each year to submit to it, including one of his favorites, \"The Old Man and Jim\" in 1887.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 213\">Van Allen, p. 213</ref>\n\nBy the end of 1882, Riley's finances began improving dramatically, thanks largely to the income from his performances.<ref>Van Allen, p. 188</ref> During 1883 he began writing his \"Boone County\" poems under the pseudonym \"Benjamin F. Johnson of Boone\". They were almost entirely written in dialect and emphasized topics of rural life during the early nineteenth century, often employing nostalgia and the simplicity of country life as elements. \"The Old Swimmin'-Hole\" and \"When the Frost Is on the Punkin'\" were the most popular and helped earn the entire series critical acclaim. The topics were popular with readers, reminding many of them of their childhood.<ref>Van Allen, p. 192</ref> [[Bobbs-Merrill Company|Merrill, Meigs & Company]] (later renamed Bobbs-Merrill Company) approached Riley to compile the poems into a book. Riley agreed and his first book was published in August 1883, titled ''The Old Swimmin'-Hole and 'Leven More Poems''. The book's popularity necessitated a second printing before the end of the year.<ref>Van Allen, p. 193</ref> During this period Riley determined that his most popular poems were those on topics of rural life, and he began to use that as a common theme throughout his future work.<ref>Van Allen, p. 194</ref>\n\nThe income from his book allowed Riley to ease his busy work schedule; he submitted articles to the ''Journal'' less often and made fewer lecture stops. He wrote fewer poems but their quality improved; he wrote his most famous poems during the mid-1880s, including \"Little Orphant Annie\". <ref>Van Allen, p. 196</ref> Riley attempted to secure a new job at a periodical and leave the ''Journal'', but the magazines would not hire him unless he was willing to relocate. Riley was steadfast in his refusal to leave Indiana telling reporters that his rural home was his inspiration and to leave would ruin his poetry.<ref>Van Allen, p. 197</ref>\n\nRiley renewed his relationship with Bottsworth for a third and final time in 1883. The two corresponded frequently and had secret lovers' rendezvous. He stopped visiting other women and their relationship became more dedicated and stable.<ref>Van Allen, p. 199</ref> Bottsworth became convinced Riley was seeing another woman, however, and they ended their relationship in January 1885.<ref>Van Allen, pp. 204\u2013205</ref> Riley's sister, Mary, had become a close friend of Bottsworth and scolded him for his mistreatment of her. Her reputation was tarnished by the affair, and she found it difficult to find employment once their relationship was over.<ref>Crowder, pp. 108\u2013110</ref>\n\nIn 1884, Riley toured the major cities in the eastern United States again.<ref>Van Allen, p. 301</ref> Following the lectures, he began compiling a second book of poetry. He completed it during July, and Bowen-Merrill published it in December with the title ''The Boss Girl, A Christmas Story and Other Sketches''.<ref>Van Allen, p. 207</ref> The book, which contained humorous poetry and short stories, received mixed reviews. It was popular around Indiana, where most of its copies were sold. One reviewer, however, called the poems \"weird, nightmarish, and eerie\" and compared them to Edgar Allan Poe's works.<ref>Van Allen, p. 208</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 121</ref>\n\nWhile Riley was working on his book, he was unexpectedly invited by [[James Pond (Medal of Honor)|James B. Pond]], the agent for many of the nation's major performers, to join a one-hundred nights' engagement in New York City in a show that included Samuel Clemens and [[Charles Dudley Warner|Dudley Warner]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 202</ref> Riley was unable to agree with the Redpath Bureau who had to authorize any other performance under the terms of their contract. He believed his contract with the Redpath Bureau was limiting his opportunities, and his relationship with his agent became strained.<ref>Van Allen, p. 203</ref><ref name=\"Crowder, p. 149\">Crowder, p. 149</ref>\n\n===Western Association of Writers===\nDue in part to the limited success of his latest book outside Indiana, Riley was persuaded to begin working with other midwestern writers to form an association to promote their work. Popular Indiana writer [[Lew Wallace]], author of ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ|Ben-Hur]]'', was a major promoter of the effort.<ref>Van Allen, p. 209</ref> During 1885, more than one hundred writers joined the group. They held their first meeting in July, naming themselves the Western Association of Writers. At the meeting Maurice Thompson was named president, and Riley vice president.<ref>Van Allen, p. 210</ref> The association never succeeded in its goal of creating a powerful advertising force, but became a social club and a rival literary community to the eastern writing establishment. Riley was disappointed with the shortcomings of the group but came to depend on its regular meetings as an escape from his normally hectic schedule.<ref>Van Allen, p. 211</ref>\n\nThrough the association, Riley became acquainted with most of the notable writers in the Midwestern United States, including humorist [[Edgar Wilson Nye]] of Chicago. After completing his lecture circuit in 1885, Riley formed a partnership with Nye and his agent to begin a new tour. The Redpath Bureau agreed to allow Riley to tour with Nye, provided he maintained his financial agreements with them.<ref>Van Allen, p. 212</ref> In addition to touring, Riley and Nye collaborated on a book, ''Nye and Riley's Railway Guide'', a collection of humorous anecdotes and poems intended to parody popular tourist literature of the day. Published in 1888, the book was somewhat successful and had three reprints.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 213\"/>\n\nIn October 1887, Riley and the association joined with other writers to petition the [[United States Congress]] to attempt to negotiate international treaties to protect American copyrights abroad. The group became known as the International Copyright League and had significant success in its efforts. When traveling to one of the league's meetings in New York City that year, Riley was struck by [[Bell's palsy]]. He recovered after three weeks but remained secluded to hide the effects of the sickness which he believed was caused by his alcoholism. He made another attempt to stop drinking alcohol with the help of a minister, but soon returned to his old habit.<ref>Van Allen, p. 214</ref>\n\nAfter recovering, Riley remained briefly in New York to participate in a show at [[Chickering Hall, New York|Chickering Hall]] with Edgar Nye, Samuel Clemens, and several others. Riley was introduced by [[James Russell Lowell]] before his performance, and Lowell gave Riley a glowing endorsement to the crowd. His poetry brought both tears and laughter according to ''[[The New York Sun]]''. Critic [[Edmund Clarence Stedman]], one of the foremost literary critics of the era, was present and wrote that Riley's dialect poems were the finest he had ever heard, \"in which a homely dramatis {{sic}} persona's heart is laid open by subtle indirect, absolutely sure and tender\" poetry.<ref>Van Allen, p. 217</ref> As a result of his New York performance, his name and picture were carried in all the major eastern papers, and he quickly became well known throughout the United States. Sales of ''The Boss Girl'' increased, resulting in the fifth and largest printing, and Riley finally began to achieve the widespread fame he sought.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 118\"/>\n\nClemens disliked being upstaged by Riley and attempted to avoid any future joint performances with him. According to one review, Clemens \"shriveled up into a bitter patch of melancholy in the fierce light of Mr. Riley's humour\".<ref>Van Allen, p. 216</ref>\n\nAfter returning home from his tour in early 1888, Riley finished compiling his third book, titled ''Old-Fashioned Roses''. Arranged to appeal to British readers, it included only a few of his dialect poems and consisted mostly of [[sonnet]]s. The book reprinted many poems Riley had already published but included some new ones he wrote specifically for the book, including \"The Days Gone By\", \"The Little White Hearse\", and \"The Serenade.\" The book was Riley's favorite because it included his finest works and was published by the prestigious [[Longman|Longmans, Green]] Publishers with high quality printing and binding.<ref>Van Allen, p. 224</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 133</ref>\n\nIn late 1888 he finished work on a fourth book, ''Pipes o' Pan at Zekesbury'' which was released to great acclaim in the United States. Based on a fictional town in Indiana, Riley presented many stories and poems about its citizens and way of life. It received mixed reviews from literary critics who wrote of it that Riley's stories were not of the same quality as his poetry. The book was very popular with the public and went through numerous reprints.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 225\">Van Allen, p. 225</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 132</ref>\n\nRiley was quickly becoming wealthy from his books and touring, earning nearly $20,000 in 1888. He no longer needed his job at the journal and left it near the end of that year. The newspaper had served to earn him fame and had published hundreds of his articles, stories, and poems.<ref>Van Allen, p. 218</ref>\n\n==National fame==\n\n===Politics===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    = \n | width     = 220\n | image1    = James Whitcomb Riley 1940 Issue-10c.jpg\n | alt1      = A postage bearing Riley's image\n | caption1  = James Whitcomb Riley [[Postage stamps and postal history of the United States#Famous Americans Series of 1940|Issue of 1940]]\n | image2    = Edgar Wilson Nye & James Whitcomb Riley show advertisement, 1888.jpg\n | alt2      = Sketch of two men riding an elephant\n | caption2  = An advertisement for Riley and Nye's show.\n}}\n\nIn March 1888, Riley traveled to Washington, D.C. where he had dinner at the [[White House]] with other members of the International Copyright League and President  [[Grover Cleveland]]. Riley gave a brief performance for the dignitaries at the event before speaking about the need for international copyright protections. Cleveland was enamored by Riley's performance and invited him back for a private meeting during which the two men discussed cultural topics.<ref>Van Allen, p. 219</ref> In the [[1888 United States presidential election|1888 Presidential Election campaign]], Riley's acquaintance [[Benjamin Harrison]] was nominated as the Republican candidate. Although Riley had shunned politics for most of his life, he gave Harrison a personal endorsement and participated in fund-raising events and vote stumping. The election was exceptionally partisan in Indiana, and Riley found the atmosphere of the campaign stressful; he vowed never to become involved with politics again.<ref>Van Allen, p. 220</ref>\n\nUpon Harrison's election, he suggested Riley be named the national [[poet laureate]], but Congress failed to act on the request. Riley was still honored by Harrison and visited him at the White House on several occasions to perform at civic events.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 221\">Van Allen, p. 221</ref>\n\n===Pay problems and scandal===\nRiley and Nye made arrangements with James Pond to do two national tours during 1888 and 1889.<ref>Crowder, p. 123</ref> They were popular and generally sold out, with hundreds having to be turned away. The shows were usually forty-five minutes to an hour long and featured Riley reading often humorous poetry interspersed by stories and jokes from Nye. The shows were informal, and the two men adjusted their performances based on their audiences' reactions. Riley memorized forty of his poems for the shows to add to his own versatility.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 221\"/><ref>Crowder, p. 124</ref> Many prominent literary and theatrical people attended the shows. At a New York City show in March 1888, [[Augustin Daly]] was so enthralled by it he insisted on hosting the two men at a banquet with several leading Broadway theater actors.<ref>Crowder, p. 130</ref>\n\nDespite serving as the act's main draw, Riley was not permitted to become an equal partner in the venture. Nye and Pond both received a percentage of the net profit, while Riley was paid a flat rate for each performance.<ref>Crowder, p. 134</ref> In addition, because of his past agreements with the Redpath Lyceum Bureau, Riley was required to pay half of his fee to his agent Amos Walker. This meant the other men profited more than Riley from his own work.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 225\"/>\n\nTo remedy this situation, Riley hired his brother-in-law Henry Eitel, an Indianapolis banker, to manage his finances and act on his behalf to try to extricate him from his contract. Despite discussions and assurances from Pond that he would work to address the problem, Eitel had no success. Pond ultimately made the situation worse by booking months of solid performances, not allowing Riley and Nye a day of rest. These events affected Riley physically and emotionally; he became despondent and began his worst period of alcoholism. During November 1889, several shows were cancelled after Riley became severely inebriated at a stop in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 226</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 137</ref>\n\nWalker began monitoring Riley and denying him access to liquor, but he found ways to evade him. At a stop at the Masonic Temple Theatre in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], in January 1890, Riley paid the hotel's bartender to sneak whiskey to his room.<ref>Crowder, p. 138</ref> He became too drunk to perform and was unable to travel to the next stop. Nye terminated their partnership and the tour in response. The reason for the breakup could not be kept secret, and hotel staff reported to the ''[[The Courier-Journal|Louisville Courier-Journal]]'' they saw Riley in a drunken stupor walking around the hotel.<ref>Crowder, p. 139</ref> The story made national news and Riley feared his career was ruined.<ref>Van Allen, p. 227</ref>\n\nHe secretly left Louisville at night and returned to Indianapolis by train. Eitel defended him to the press to gain sympathy for Riley, explaining the abusive financial arrangements his partners had made. Riley refused to speak to reporters, however, and hid himself for weeks.<ref>Van Allen, p. 229</ref> Much to Riley's surprise, the news reports made him more popular than ever.<ref>Van Allen, p. 230</ref> Many people thought the stories were exaggerated, and Riley's carefully cultivated image made it difficult for the public to believe he was an alcoholic. Riley had stopped sending poetry to newspapers and magazines in the aftermath, but they soon began corresponding with him asking him to resume writing. This encouraged Riley, and he made another attempt to give up liquor as he returned to his public career.<ref>Van Allen, p. 231</ref>\n\nThe negative press did not end, however, as Nye and Pond threatened to sue Riley for causing their tour to end prematurely. They claimed to have lost $20,000. Walker threatened a separate suit demanding $1,000. Riley hired Indianapolis lawyer William P. Fishback to represent him and the men settled out of court.<ref>Crowder, p. 140</ref> The full details of the settlement were never disclosed, but whatever the case, Riley finally extricated himself from his old contracts and became a free agent. The exorbitant amount Riley was being sued for only reinforced public opinion that he had been mistreated by his partners and helped him maintain his image. Nye and Riley remained good friends, and Riley later wrote Pond and Walker were the source of the problems.<ref>Van Allen, p. 232</ref>\n\nRiley's poetry had become popular in Britain, in large part due to his book ''Old-Fashioned Roses''. In May 1891 he traveled to England to tour and made what he considered a literary pilgrimage. He landed in [[Liverpool]] and traveled first to [[Dumfries]], [[Scotland]], the home and burial place of [[Robert Burns]]. Riley had long been compared to Burns by critics because they both used dialect in their poetry and drew inspiration from their rural homes.<ref>Van Allen, p. 237</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 148</ref> He then traveled to [[Edinburgh]], [[York]], and London, reciting poetry for gatherings at each stop. Augustin Daly arranged for him to give a poetry reading to prominent British actors in London.<ref name=\"Crowder, p. 149\"/> Riley was warmly welcomed by its literary and theatrical community, and he toured places that [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] had frequented.<ref>Van Allen, p. 238</ref>\n\nRiley quickly tired of traveling abroad and began longing for home, writing to his nephew that he regretted having left the United States. He curtailed his journey and returned to New York City in August.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 239\">Van Allen, p. 239</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 151</ref> He spent the next months in his Greenfield home attempting to write an [[Epic poetry|epic poem]], but after several attempts gave up, believing he did not possess the ability.<ref>Van Allen, p. 228</ref>\n\nBy 1890, Riley had authored almost all his famous poems. The few poems he wrote during the 1890s were generally less well received by the public.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 239\"/> As a solution, Riley and his publishers began reusing poetry from other books and printing some of his earliest works. When ''Neighborly Poems'' was published in 1891, a critic working for the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' pointed out the use of Riley's earliest works, commenting that he was using his popularity to push his crude earlier works onto the public only to make money.<ref name = v240>Van Allen, p. 240</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 153</ref> Riley's newest poems published in the 1894 book ''Armazindy'' received very negative reviews that referred to poems like \"The Little Dog-Woggy\" and \"Jargon-Jingle\" as \"drivel\" and to Riley as a \"worn out genius\".<ref name = v240/> Most of his growing number of critics suggested that he ignored the quality of the poems for the sake of making money.<ref name = v240/>\n\n===Last tours===\nAlthough Riley was wealthy from his books, he was able to triple his annual income by touring. He found the lure hard to resist and decided to return to the lecture circuit in 1892. He hired William C. Glass to assist Henry Eitel in managing his affairs. While Eitel handled the finances, Glass worked to organize his lecture tours.<ref>Van Allen, p. 243</ref> Glass worked closely with Riley's publishers to have his tours coincide with the release of new books and ensured his tours were geographically varied enough to maintain his popularity in all regions of the nation. He was careful not to book busy schedules; Riley only performed four times a week and the tours were short, lasting only three months.<ref>Van Allen p. 244</ref>\n\nDuring his 1893 tour, Riley lectured mostly in the western United States, and in his 1894 tour in the east. His performances were major events, and generally sold out within days of their announcements. In 1894 he allowed the author [[Douglass Sherley]] to join his tour. Sherley was a millionaire who published his own books. The literary community had dismissed his work, but Riley was instrumental in helping him gain acceptance.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 245\">Van Allen, p. 245</ref>\n\nIn 1895 Riley undertook his last tour, making stops in most of the major cities in the United States.<ref>Vann Allen, p. 248</ref> Advertised as his final performances, there was incredible demand for tickets and Riley performed before his largest audiences during the tour. He and Sherley continued a show very similar to those that he and Nye had done. Riley often lamented the lack of change in the program. He found when he tried to introduce new material, or left out any of his most popular poems, the crowds would demand encores until he agreed to recite their favorites.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 251\">Van Allen, p. 251</ref>\n\n===Children's poet===\n[[File:James Whitcomb RIley, The Children's Poet, 1916.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Riley seated in a chair surrounded by children|Riley holds his pet dog while posing for a photo with a group of children in front of his Indianapolis home]]\n\nFollowing the death of his father in 1894, Riley began regretting his choice not to marry or have children.<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 245\"/> To compensate for this,  he became a doting uncle, showering gifts on his nieces and nephews. He had repurchased his childhood home in 1893 and allowed his divorced sister, Mary, his widowed sister-in-law, Julia, and their daughters to live in it.<ref>Crowder, p. 163</ref> He provided for all their needs and spent the summer months of 1893 living with them. He took on his nephew Edmund Eital as a personal secretary and gave him a $50,000 wedding gift in 1912. Riley was well loved by his family.<ref>Van Allen, p. 246</ref>\n\nRiley returned to live near Indianapolis later in 1893, boarding in a private home in the Lockerbie district, then a small suburb. He developed a close friendship with his landlords, the Nickum and Holstein families. The home became a destination for local schoolchildren to whom Riley would regularly recite poetry and tell stories. Riley's friends often visited his home, and he developed a closer relationship with Eugene Debs.<ref>Van Allen, p. 247</ref>\n\nThe same year, he began compiling his poems of most interest to children into a new book entitled ''Rhymes of Childhood''. The book was richly illustrated by [[Howard Chandler Christy]], and Riley wrote a few new poems for the book under the pseudonym \"Uncle Sydney.\"<ref>Crowder, p. 145</ref> ''Rhymes of Childhood'' became Riley's best selling book, and sold millions of copies. It has remained in print continually since 1912 and helped earn him the nickname the \"Children's Poet\". Even Riley's rival, Clemens, commented that the book was \"charming\" and made him weep for his \"lost youth\".<ref>Van Allen, p. 236</ref>\n{{clear}}\n\n==Later life==\n\n===National poet===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    = \n | width     = 220\n | image1    = James Whitcomb Riley, 1913, Cincinnati.jpg\n | alt1      = Smiling old man with round glasses wearing a hat\n | caption1  = Riley at a Riley Day celebration in [[Cincinnati]] in 1913.\n | image2    = James Whitcomb Riley House in Indianapolis, front and western side.jpg\n | alt2      = A large brick house surrounded by trees\n | caption2  = The [[James Whitcomb Riley Museum Home]], Riley's Indianapolis home during the last decade of his life.\n | image3    =\n | alt3      = Six white columns atop a hill\n | caption3  = Tomb of James Whitcomb Riley at Crown Hill Cemetery in Indianapolis\n}}\n[[File:James Whitcomb Riley.png|thumb|7 volumes of the Complete Works of James Whitcomb Riley]]\nRiley had become very wealthy by the time he stopped touring in 1895 and was earning $1,000 a week.<ref>Van Allen, p. 250</ref> Although he retired, he continued to make minor appearances. In 1896, Riley performed four shows in [[Denver]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 249</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 179</ref> Most of the performances of his later life were at civic celebrations. He was a regular speaker at [[Memorial Day|Decoration Day]] events and delivered poetry before the unveiling of monuments in Washington, D.C. Newspapers began referring to him as the \"National Poet\", \"the poet laureate of America\", and \"the people's poet laureate\".<ref name=\"Van Allen, p. 251\"/> Riley wrote many of his patriotic poems for such events, including \"The Soldier\", \"The Name of Old Glory\", and his most famous such poem, \"America!\". The 1902 poem \"America, Messiah of Nations\" was written and read by Riley for the dedication of the [[Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument (Indianapolis)|Indianapolis Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 253</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 203</ref>\n\nThe only new poetry Riley published after the end of the century were [[elegy|elegies]] for famous friends. The poetic qualities of the poems were often poor, but they contained many popular sentiments concerning the deceased. Among those he eulogized were Benjamin Harrison, Lew Wallace, and Henry Lawton. Because of the poor quality of the poems, his friends and publishers asked that he stop writing them, but he refused.<ref>Van Allen, p. 254</ref>\n\nIn 1897, Riley's publishers suggested that he create a multi-volume series of books containing his complete life works.<ref>Crowder, p. 187</ref> With the help of his nephew, Riley began working to compile the books. There were eventually sixteen volumes, which were finally completed in 1914. Such works were uncommon during the lives of writers, attesting to the uncommon popularity Riley had achieved.<ref name = v242>Van Allen, p. 242</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 189</ref>\n\nHis works had become staples for Ivy League literature courses and universities began offering him honorary degrees. The first was [[Yale]] in 1902, followed by a Doctorate of Letters from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1904. [[Wabash College]] and [[Indiana University]] granted him similar awards.<ref>Crowder, pp. 206, 210, 224</ref> In 1908 he was elected a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters|National Institute of Arts and Letters]]; in 1912 they conferred upon him a special medal for poetry.<ref name = v242/><ref>Crowder, p. 234</ref>\n\nRiley was influential in helping other poets start their careers, having particularly strong influences on Hamlin Garland, [[William Allen White]], and [[Edgar Lee Masters]]. He discovered aspiring African-American poet [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]] in 1892. Riley thought Dunbar's work was \"worthy of applause\" and wrote him letters of recommendation to help him get his work published.<ref name=\"v242\"/>\n\n===Declining health===\nIn 1901, Riley's doctor diagnosed him with [[neurasthenia]], a nervous disorder, and recommended long periods of rest as a cure.<ref>Van Allen, p. 255</ref> Riley remained ill for the rest of his life and relied on his landlords and family to aid in his care. During the winter months he moved to Miami, Florida, and during summer spent time with his family in Greenfield. He made only a few trips during the decade, including one to [[Mexico]] in 1906. He became very depressed by his condition, writing to his friends that he thought he could die at any moment, and often used alcohol for relief.<ref name = v256>Van Allen, p. 256</ref>\n\nIn March 1909, Riley was stricken a second time with Bell's palsy and partial deafness, the symptoms only gradually eased over the course of the year.<ref>Crowder, p. 228</ref> He was a difficult patient, and generally refused to take any medicine except the patent medicines he had sold in his earlier years; the medicines often worsened his conditions, but his doctors could not sway his opinion.<ref>Crowder, p. 233</ref> On July 10, 1910, he suffered a stroke that paralyzed the right side of his body. Hoping for a quick recovery, his family kept the news from the press until September. Riley found the loss of use of his writing hand the worst part of the stroke, which served only to further depress him.<ref name = v256/><ref>Crowder, p. 232</ref> With his health so poor, he decided to work on a legacy by which to be remembered in Indianapolis. In 1911 he donated land and funds to build a new library on Pennsylvania Avenue.<ref name = v257>Van Allen, p. 257</ref> By 1913, with the aid of a cane, Riley began recovering his ability to walk. His inability to write, however, nearly ended his production of poems. [[George Ade]] worked with him from 1910 through 1916 to write his last five poems and several short autobiographical sketches as Riley dictated. His publisher continued recycling old works into new books, which remained in high demand.<ref name = v257/>\n\nSince the mid-1880s, Riley had been the nation's most read poet, a trend that accelerated at the turn of the century. In 1912 Riley recorded readings of his most popular poetry to be sold by the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]]. He was the subject of three paintings by [[T. C. Steele]]. The Indianapolis Arts Association commissioned a portrait of Riley to be created by the world-famous painter [[John Singer Sargent]]. His image became a nationally known icon and many businesses capitalized on his popularity to sell their products; Hoosier Poet brand vegetables became a major trade-name in the Midwest.<ref>Van Allen, p. 258</ref>\n\nIn 1912, the governor of Indiana instituted Riley Day on the poet's birthday. Schools were required to teach Riley's poems to their pupils, and banquet events were held in his honor around the state. In 1915 and 1916 the celebration was national after being proclaimed in most states. The annual celebration continued in Indiana until 1968.<ref>Van Allen, p. 259</ref> In early 1916 Riley was filmed as part of a movie to celebrate Indiana's centennial, the video is on display at the Indiana State Library.<ref>Van Allen, p. 261</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 252</ref>\n\n===Death and legacy===\n[[File:Riley8394.JPG|thumb|right|alt=see caption|Statue by [[Myra Reynolds Richards]] honoring James Whitcomb Riley on courthouse lawn in [[Greenfield, Indiana|Greenfield]], Indiana.]]\n\nOn July 22, 1916, Riley suffered a second stroke. He recovered enough during the day to speak and joke with his companions. He died before dawn on July 23.<ref>Van Allen, p. 262</ref> Riley's death shocked the nation and made front page headlines in major newspapers.<ref>Van Allen, p. 1</ref> President [[Woodrow Wilson]] wrote a brief note to Riley's family offering condolences on behalf of the entire nation. Indiana Governor [[Samuel M. Ralston]] offered to allow Riley to lie in state at the [[Indiana Statehouse]]\u2014[[Abraham Lincoln]] is the only other person to have previously received such an honor.<ref>Van Allen, p. 2</ref> During the ten hours he lay in state on July 24, more than thirty-five thousand people filed past his bronze casket; the line was still miles long at the end of the day, and thousands were turned away. The next day a private funeral ceremony was held and attended by many dignitaries. A large funeral procession then carried him to [[Crown Hill Cemetery]] where he was buried in a tomb at the top of the hill, the highest point in the city of Indianapolis.<ref>Van Allen, p. 3</ref>\n\nWithin a year of Riley's death, many memorials were created, including several by the James Whitcomb Riley Memorial Association. The [[James Whitcomb Riley Hospital for Children]] was created and named in his honor by a group of wealthy benefactors and opened in 1924. In the following years, other memorials intended to benefit children were created, including Camp Riley for youth with disabilities.<ref>Van Allen, p. 4</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rileykids.org/Camp|title= Camp Riley|publisher=Riley Kids.org|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe memorial foundation purchased the poet's Lockerbie home in Indianapolis, and it is now maintained as a museum. The [[James Whitcomb Riley Museum Home]] is the only late-Victorian home in Indiana that is open to the public. It is the United States' only late-Victorian preservation, featuring authentic furniture and decor from that era. His birthplace and boyhood home, now the James Whitcomb Riley House, is preserved as a historical site.<ref>Van Allen, p. 272</ref> A [[Liberty ship]] commissioned April 23, 1942, was christened the ''SS James Whitcomb Riley''. It served with the [[United States Maritime Commission]] until being scrapped in 1971.\n\n[[James Whitcomb Riley High School]] opened in South Bend, Indiana, in 1924. In 1950, there was a James Whitcomb Riley Elementary School in [[Hammond, Indiana]], but it was torn down in 2006. [[East Chicago, Indiana]], had a Riley School at one time, as did neighboring [[Gary, Indiana]], and Anderson, Indiana.  One of New Castle, Indiana's, elementary schools is named for Riley<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nccsc.k12.in.us/index.php/schoolstop/elementarytop/rileymoodletop.html |title=Riley Elementary |accessdate=August 30, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002161825/http://www.nccsc.k12.in.us/index.php/schoolstop/elementarytop/rileymoodletop.html |archivedate=October 2, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> as is the road<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Riley+Road,+New+Castle,+IN/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x881533388b97518f:0x3c2c06d66ea9eefa?hl=en&dg=dbrw&newdg=1|title=Riley Road Google Maps|publisher=Google|accessdate=May 3, 2019}}</ref> on which it is located along with Riley Elementary School in La Porte, Indiana.

Taking place the first or second weekend of October, the \"Riley Days\" festival traditionally commences with a flower parade in which local school children place flowers around [[Myra Reynolds Richards]]' statue of Riley on the county courthouse lawn, while a band plays lively music in honor of the poet. Weeks before the festival, the festival board has a queen contest. The pageant has been going on many years in honor of the Hoosier poet<ref>Van Allen, p. 274</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Elizabeth Van Allen, Riley was instrumental in helping form a Midwestern cultural identity. The Midwestern United States had no significant literary community before the 1880s.<ref>Van Allen, p. 269</ref> The works of the Western Association of Writers, most notably those of Riley and Wallace, helped create the Midwest's cultural identity and rival literary community to the established eastern literati. For this reason and the publicity Riley's work created, he was commonly known as the \"Hoosier Poet\".<ref>Van Allen, p. 270</ref><ref>Crowder, p. 255</ref>\n\n==Critical reception and style==\nRiley was among the most popular writers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, known for his \"uncomplicated, sentimental, and humorous\" writing.<ref name = Centage/> Often writing his verses in dialect, his poetry caused readers to recall a nostalgic and simpler time in earlier American history. This gave his poetry a unique appeal during a period of rapid industrialization and [[urbanization in the United States]]. Riley was a prolific writer who \"achieved mass appeal partly due to his canny sense of marketing and publicity\".<ref name = Centage/> He published more than fifty books, mostly of poetry and humorous short stories, and sold millions of copies.<ref name = Centage/>\n\nHe is often remembered for his most famous poems, including \"The Raggedy Man\" and \"Little Orphant Annie\". Many of his poems used events and people from his childhood as an inspiration for subject their matter.<ref name = Centage>{{cite book|title=Poetry Criticism|editor=Galens, David|volume=48|publisher= Gale Cengage|year= 2003|pages=210\u2013212}}</ref> His poems often contain morals and warnings for children, with messages telling children to care for the less fortunate of society. David Galens and Van Allen both see these messages as Riley's subtle response to the turbulent economic times of the [[Gilded Age]] and the growing [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]].<ref>Van Allen, p. 235</ref> Riley believed that urbanization robbed children of their innocence and sincerity, and in his poems he attempted to introduce and idolize characters who had not lost those qualities.<ref>Van Allen, p. 234</ref> His children's poems are \"exuberant, performative, and often display Riley's penchant for using humorous characterization, repetition, and dialect to make his poetry accessible to a wide-ranging audience\".<ref name = Centage/><ref name = g434>Greasley, p. 434</ref>\n\nAlthough hinted at indirectly in some poems, Riley wrote very little on serious subjects, and mocked attempts at serious poetry. Only a few of his sentimental poems concern serious subjects. \"Little Mandy's Christmas-Tree\", \"The Absence of Little Wesley\", and \"The Happy Little Cripple\" are about poverty, the death of a child, and disabilities. Like his children's poems, they also contain morals, suggesting society should pity the downtrodden and be charitable.<ref name = Centage/><ref name = g434/>\n\nRiley wrote gentle and romantic poems that were not in dialect. They generally consist of sonnets and are strongly influenced by the works of [[John Greenleaf Whittier]], Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]]. His standard English poetry was never as popular as his Hoosier dialect poems.<ref name = Centage/> Still less popular were the poems Riley wrote in his later years; most were to commemorate important events in American history or to eulogize the dead.<ref name = Centage/>\n\nRiley's contemporaries acclaimed him \"America's best-loved poet\".<ref name = Centage/><ref name = g434/> In 1920, Henry Beers lauded the works of Riley \"as natural and unaffected, with none of the discontent and deep thought of cultured song\".<ref name = Centage/> Samuel Clemens, [[William Dean Howells]], and Hamlin Garland, each praised Riley's work and the idealism he expressed in his poetry. Only a few critics of the period found fault with Riley's works. [[Ambrose Bierce]] criticized Riley for his frequent use of dialect. He accused Riley of using dialect to \"cover up [the] faulty construction\" of his poems.<ref name = Centage/> Edgar Lee Masters found Riley's work to be superficial, claiming it lacked irony and that he had only a \"narrow emotional range\".<ref name = Centage/> By the 1930s popular critical opinion towards Riley's works began to shift in favor of the negative reviews. In 1951, [[James T. Farrell]] said Riley's works were \"cliched\". Galens wrote modern critics consider Riley to be a \"minor poet, whose work\u2014provincial, sentimental, and superficial though it may have been\u2014nevertheless struck a chord with a mass audience in a time of enormous cultural change\".<ref name = Centage/> Thomas C. Johnson wrote that what most interests modern critics was Riley's ability to market his work, saying he had a unique understanding of \"how to commodify his own image and the nostalgic dreams of an anxious nation\".<ref name = Centage/>\n\nAmong the earliest widespread criticisms of Riley were opinions that his dialect writing did not actually represent the true dialect of central Indiana. In 1970 Peter Revell wrote Riley's dialect was more like the poor speech of a child rather than the dialect of his region. He made extensive comparisons to historical texts and Riley's dialect usage. Philip Greasley wrote that while \"some critics have dismissed him as sub-literary, insincere, and an artificial entertainer, his defenders reply that an author so popular with millions of people in different walks of life must contribute something of value, and that his faults, if any, can be ignored\".<ref name = g434/>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Indiana|Poetry|Children's literature}}\n*[[American poetry]]\n*[[Golden Age of Indiana Literature]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notes==\n<references group=\"n\"/>\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book|title=The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis|author=Bodenhamer, David J.|author2=Robert Graham Barrows|author3=David Gordon Vanderstel|year=1994|publisher=[[Indiana University]] Press|isbn=0-253-31222-1}}\n* Cottman, George S.

(Altered Dynamic Dimensions)'' that garnered online attention and led to his signing with independent music blog and record label Vinyl Meltdown.\n\nIn 2010, Emay joined and released content with three different collaboration projects, which expanded Emay's connections in the music industry and lead to multiple collaboration with British hip hop artist [[Star Slinger]].<ref name=\":13\" /> The collaborations caught the attention of a blog called Potholes in my Blog and the [[Complex (magazine)|Complex Magazine's]] [[Pigeons & Planes]]\u2014both of which would go on to consistently promote Emay's music.<ref name=\":38\" />\n\nEmay's first extended play to be widely recognized was released in 2014 and was entitled ''Sinner, Song-Writer''.<ref name=\":52\" /><ref name=\":46\" /> Emay's debut full-length album entitled ''Ilah'' was released in 2017 to overwhelmingly positive reviews and lead to Emay being interviewed by a number of music news outlets and music magazines.<ref name=\":53\" /><ref name=\":54\" /><ref name=\":55\" /><ref name=\":49\" /><ref name=\":50\" /><ref name=\":51\" />  \n\n== Early life ==\nMubarik Gyenne-Adams (preferred name Mubarik Gyenne-Bayere) was born in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]] on December 18, 1991, the son of a couple who had immigrated to Canada from [[Ghana]] in the late 1980s. His legal last name Gyenne-Adams came from the first name of his paternal uncle Adam, and his preferred last name Gyenne-Bayere is reflective of the clans his parents came from within the [[Bissa people|Bissa ethnic group]] of West Africa. He and his four sisters were raised in a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Muslims|Muslim]] household by his single mother. According to Mubarik's song titled \"Because Winter (feat. Lowell Boland)\", he was four years old when his father passed away. The family regularly moved between shelters throughout [[Ontario]]. As a child he attended Gateway Public Elementary School while living in [[Toronto]] before moving to Port Credit where he attended Riverside Public Elementary School. He lived in [[Brampton]] briefly where he attended [[Bramalea Secondary School]] before settling in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] where he attended [[Glendale Secondary School]].\n\nAccording to Emay he \"spent most of his childhood living in the Vendome patch of [[Flemingdon Park]], Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and then later moved to [[Brampton|Brampton, Ontario]] when he was in grade 5. Mubarik was first exposed to [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] when his immigrant cousin Nasara would constantly listen to [[Nas]] while living in the Vendome residence. His mother would listen to a lot of [[West African music|West African]], [[Reggae]], [[Disco]], Pop, [[Country music|Country]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[religious music]]. Emay was a huge fan of [[Eminem]] and [[Dr. Dre]] when he was in elementary school, and would stick tissue into his mothers [[cassette tape]]s to record their music off of the radio. After Mubarik moved to [[Brampton]] in grade 5, he was no longer a fan of [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] as much and would recreate melodies on his sisters digital [[MIDI keyboard]]. He also began listening to [[jazz]] and classical music from the radio. When he reached grade 8, he became intrigued with [[Southern hip hop|southern hip-hop]], and was a big fan of [[T.I.]]'s [[Grand Hustle Records|Grand Hustle label]], and artists like [[Jeezy|Young Jeezy]], [[UGK]], and [[Boosie Badazz|Lil' Boosie]]. As he progressed through high school he began listening to more [[Old-school hip hop|old school]] and [[Underground hip hop|underground hip-hop]] acts such as [[Jedi Mind Tricks]], [[O.C. (rapper)|OC]], [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]], [[Showbiz and A.G.|Showbiz & A.G.]], and [[MF Doom]]. In 2006, he began creating instrumentals in [[FL Studio]] in attempt to mimic his favourite producers and artists. Mubarik learned how to create instrumentals in [[FL Studio]] after his online mentors Lion and Gravity gave him tips and advice. His online mentors also assisted him with his [[rapping]] as well. As he completed high school, he began listening to a lot more different genres including Classical, [[Classic rock music|Classic Rock]], [[Grunge]], [[Emo]], [[Alternative Music|Alternative]], [[Punk rock|Punk]], [[Soul music|Soul]], [[Ambient music|Ambient]], and more.\"\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== 2006\u20132013: Career Beginnings ===\nAccording to various profile biographies on numerous small streaming services as well as an interview on Revolutionary Left Radio, Mubarik began his musical career in 2006 at the age of fifteen. Leading up to his first major project, Mubarik focused on music production instead of emceeing and decided on the pseudonym Emay\u2014the phonetic spelling of his initials\u2014for his solo project. For the release of A.D.D., Mubarik stylized his stage name as EmAy, however, he never used the stylized spelling after 2008. Many of the biographies compare Emay to [[Pete Rock]], [[Madlib]], [[Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind]], [[Danger Mouse (musician)|Danger Mouse]], and 9th Wonder. Additionally, many of the biographies identify his music as [[Downtempo]], [[Electronica]], [[Chill-out music|Chillout]], [[Trip hop|Trip-Hop]], [[Emceeing]], and [[Conscious hip-hop]]. Emay emphasized multiple times on his [[Last.fm]] account biography that he was more interested in his music being known than the person behind the music.\n\nThe full-length album entitled ''A.D.D. (Altered Dynamic Dimensions)'' was released in the fall of 2008 and was distributed as a digital download on Emay's [[Myspace]] account and [[DatPiff]], however there has been some confusion as to the mixtapes exact release date. The mixtape was also promoted by the music blog and independent record label Vinyl Meltdown, which would continue to follow and promote Emay's music until the website shut down in 2015. The mixtape was entirely made up of remixed content by well-known artists such as [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy of Mobb Deep]], [[Nas]], [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]], and [[Eminem]]. The mixtape created some online activity and local buzz, but was not widely purchased or downloaded. The title of the mixtape is the acronym A.D.D., which is a reference to Mubarik's experiences with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention-deficit disorder]] as well as the nature of the mixtape impulsively skipping from one artist's sample to another. The album artwork for the mixtape was illustrated by Chase Miles.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Emay|title=Free Music Archive: Emay|last=Adams|first=Mubarik|date=July 29, 2010|website=Free Music Archive|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215201751/https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Emay|archive-date=February 15, 2020|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====== Child (Refugee) ======\nOn October 17, 2009 the single entitled ''Child (Refugee)'' was released under the independent record label entitled Vinyl Meltdown and Judge Mental Music. The release was made available as a free digital download on [[Myspace]] and [[Bandcamp]], and was promoted by Vinyl Meltdown. The single included the instrumental and a cappella versions as well as a bonus track entitled \"Surfin'\". The single included the first recorded verses to be written and performed by Emay as opposed to his sampling of other artists. The single's production elements and heart-wrenching story were received well, but critics responded negatively to the rapping style. The album artwork for the single was done by Austin Menard from Vinyl Meltdown, who would continue to work with Emay for about a year.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n====== Collaborations and Emay, Karen O, and The Kids ======\nIn 2009, Mubarik discovered the mixtape entitled ''La Guapa'' by Ivan Ice\u2014a Dutch music producer\u2014and after connecting online the two decided to work on a collaboration project called Ivan Ice & Emay. On February 11, 2010 the promotional single entitled ''Ze Drums'' along with the a cappella version was independently released and made available as a free digital download on [[Bandcamp]] and was promoted by Vinyl Meltdown. The single was positively received by blogs and music critics. Later that month, on February 23, 2010 the extended play entitled ''Sounds Like'' was independently released and made available as a free digital download on [[Bandcamp]] and was promoted by Vinyl Meltdown. The album artwork for both the single and extended play were done by Austin Menard. The extended play also garnered positive reviews from multiple blogs and music critics. The collaboration's music was featured on both Beatbox Radio Show and Under the Radar Radio Show. The song \"Get Ready\" was later selected to be on The Find Magazine's sequel playlist entitled Hazy Dreams II with Emay being mentioned as one of the highlights of the playlist.\n\nOn February 13, 2010 the song \"Worried Shoes\" was leaked by Potholes in My Blog to promote Emay's upcoming album. On April 26, 2010 the extended play entitled ''Emay, Karen O, and the Kids'' was independently released and made available as a free digital download on [[Myspace]] and [[Bandcamp]], and was promoted by Vinyl Meltdown. The album artwork was done by Theodore Taylor III. The album remixed six different tracks taken off of the ''[[Where the Wild Things Are: Motion Picture Soundtrack]]''\u2014originally composed by [[Karen O]]. The mixtape deviated from Emay's previous works as it was Emay's first [[instrumental]] content and the genre was identified as [[electronica]] rather than [[hip hop]] or [[Rapping|rap]]. The mixtape was praised by critics and blogs as being Emay's best work to date with the song \"Igloo\" as the album's highlight.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://billingsgazette.com/entertainment/music/off-the-charts-emay-willie-nile-davis-coltrane/article_ce0d2686-6cd7-50d2-8a50-8011da978336.html|title=Off the Charts: Emay, Willie Nile, Davis-Coltrane|last=Jorgensen|first=Chris|date=December 26, 2014|website=The Billings Gazette|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150125082012/https://billingsgazette.com/entertainment/music/off-the-charts-emay-willie-nile-davis-coltrane/article_ce0d2686-6cd7-50d2-8a50-8011da978336.html|archive-date=January 25, 2015|access-date=February 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\nEmay joined another collaboration project in 2010 called RockPaperScissors consisting of Emay, EOM also known as Elements of Music, and Remot.<ref name=\":36\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Emay/+wiki?ver=35|title=Emay biography|last=Adams|first=Mubarik|date=October 8, 2010|website=Last.fm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320141234/https://www.last.fm/music/Emay/+wiki?ver=35|archive-date=March 20, 2020|access-date=March 20, 2020}}</ref> On July 24, 2010 the extended play entitled ''Rock.

The single was added to numerous blog post listings of the best songs of 2010. The single was added to a mixtape by Blood Diamond called Dazed Digital. The single was also added to the Birp.fm 2010 indie playlist. Emay would later remix the song entitled \"Ups and Downs\" by group member Blackbird Blackbird, which would be available on his 2011 album ''Mind Altering Dynamics''. Multiple reviews noted that each group member lived in a different country. Each of the songs were separately produced samples.

At first he attempted to practice [[Quranism|Qu'ranism]], but eventually he began to pursue more scientific thought and is no longer religious. However, Mubarik states that Islam still influences him and his music to an extent.\n\nMubarik grew up in a \"very working class background, which has obviously shaped a lot of [his] political leanings\". He has repeatedly expressed anti-capitalist sentiment on various interviews and is a self-described [[Marxist-Leninist-Maoist|Marxist-Lenninist-Maoist]]. His political leanings have heavily influenced his musical content, which can be seen most clearly on ''Ilah''.\n\nMubarik's political views have influenced his nationality, which he expressed on his podcast by saying that, \"I was born and live in a place that most people call Canada, which is a [[Settler colonialism|settler-colonial]] state. But I prefer to call it [[Turtle Island (North America)|Turtle Island]]. I usually never call myself Canadian, but just consider myself to be [[African Americans|African]]\"\n\nMubarik moved to Edmonton in the spring of 2019.\n\n== Politics and Podcast ==\n\n=== Political Activism and Organizing ===\nOn October 3, 2016 Mubarik was walking in downtown [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] when he witnessed an altercation. A white woman was attempting to physically harm a black taxi driver while yelling obscenities, including the [[N-word]] and the phrase \"go back to Africa\". Mubarik videotaped the incident and posted it on Facebook where he commented on the event saying, \"Racism is 100 per cent intertwined with [[capitalism]] and overall inequality\". The woman has since been investigated by the [[Hamilton Police Service|Hamilton Police Hate Crime Unit]] and the woman has been charged with assault.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Carter|first=Adam|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/woman-calls-cab-driver-n-ger-during-altercation-caught-on-tape-1.3791516|title=Woman calls cab driver n\u2014ger during altercation caught on tape|date=October 4, 2016|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=February 16, 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161008130145/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/woman-calls-cab-driver-n-ger-during-altercation-caught-on-tape-1.3791516|archive-date=October 8, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://cutfromsteel.com/emay-bakkah-the-history-of-humankind/|title=Emay \u2013 Bakkah: The History of Humankind|last=Njegovan|first=Biljana|date=October 28, 2016|website=Cut From Steel|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225205419/http://cutfromsteel.com/emay-bakkah-the-history-of-humankind/|archive-date=February 25, 2020|access-date=February 16, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe first [[Marxism|Marxist]] organization that Mubarik became involved in was called the Young Communist League a revisionist group in Canada where Mubarik met some members of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada|PCR-RCP]]. This would lead to Mubarik eventually support the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada|PCR-RCP]] and a more [[Revolutionary|revolutionary ideology]]. Mubarik has also been involved with the [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]-based [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist-Lenninist]] organization called [[Serve the People]].\n\n=== On Mass ===\n\nOn January 16, 2018 Mubarik released the first episode of his podcast entitled ''On Mass''. In the episode, Mubarik explains that his \"goal with this podcast is to basically interpret global and local events through a revolutionary communist perspective or lens and emphasize the importance of revolution for workers and basically oppressed people all over the world if you want to see actual fundamental change.\" When describing his political leanings on the episode Mubarik stated that \"politically speaking I refer to myself as a [[Maoism|Maoist]] and I'm a supporter of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada]] known as the [[PCR-RCP]] more particularly I adhere to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] ideologically\"\n\nIn the sixth episode, released June 8, 2019, Mubarik mentions that he \"started a new website entitled 'leftistaudiobooks.com' and this is basically just me trying to spread more revolutionary ideas and things like that and making it more accessible because I know a lot of people listen to audiobooks and I listen to audiobooks a lot while I'm working and things like that so that's why I wanted to start this project.\" The website currently only has a single book available entitled [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|Imperialism the Highest Stage of Capitalism]] by [[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of On Mass Episodes\n!Episode No.\n!Title\n!Guests\n!Original Air Date\n!Notes\n|-\n|1\n|Marxism-Leninism-Maoism with J.

The episode was entitled \"On Mass: Maoism, Hip Hop, & Black Panther\". The episode cites Maoist Rebel News\u2014a small news site and blog run by Jason Unruhe\u2014as a bad representation of [[Maoism]]. The episode features songs from Emay's album ''Ilah'' including \"Lilac (feat. Kamilah and L-SPEX)\" and \"Israfil 'angels trumpet'\" as well as an unreleased song entitled \"Volunteer\". Mubarik states that the biggest misconceptions concerning [[Maoism]] is the conflation of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] with [[Mao-Zedong-Thought|Mao Zedong Thought]], the dogmatic view that everything [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] said is correct and representative of [[Maoism]], and that a [[Cultural Revolution]] is not necessary. Mubarik cites the [[Black Power movement]], The Revolutionary Internationalist Movement, and [[Shining Path|The Shining Path]] as some of the first and imperfect examples of attempting to implement Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism and cites the book entitled The Unknown Cultural Revolution written by Dongping Han as a good source for understanding the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The episode spends some time discussing the [[Black Panther Party]] and its attempt at implementing [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism|Marxism-Leninnism-Maoism]] in the 1960s and how the [[Black Panther (film)|Black Pather Movie]] was not representative of the party or the ideology. On the episode, Breht O'Shea claims that there is a direct historical lineage from [[Malcolm X]] to the [[Black Panther Party]] to [[Hip hop]], which Mubarik agreed with and expanded on.\n\n== Discography ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Full-Length Albums\n!Title\n!Album Details\n|-\n|Ilah\n|\n* Released: February 24, 2017\n* Label: Jet Jam, Tomorrow Archaic\n* Format: digital download, [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n|-\n|Adam\n|\n*Released: April 6, 2012\n* Label: Tomorrow Archaic\n* Format: digital download\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''Extended Plays'''\n!Title\n!Details\n|-\n|Sinner, Song-Writer\n|\n* Released: December 16, 2014\n* Label: [[Last Gang Records|Last Gang Records, Inc.]] / Hi-Scores Recording Library\n* Format: digital download, [[Cassette tape|cassette]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hiscoresrecordinglibrary.com/releases/emay/|title=EMAY {{!}} Hi-Scores Website|date=April 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430100257/http://hiscoresrecordinglibrary.com/releases/emay/|access-date=February 17, 2020|archive-date=April 30, 2015}}</ref> [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n|-\n|Incorruptible\n|\n* Released: March 21, 2011\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Mixtapes\n!Title\n!Details\n|-\n|Into It\n|\n* Released: October 30, 2012\n* Label: Potholes Music\n* Format: digital download, [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n|-\n|Mind Altering Dynamics (Instrumentals)\n|\n*Released: January 18, 2011\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|Mind Altering Dynamics\n|\n* Released: January 18, 2011\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|Emay, Karen O, and the Kids\n|\n* Released: April 26, 2010\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|A.D.D.

(Altered Dynamic Dimensions)'' that garnered online attention and led to his signing with independent music blog and record label Vinyl Meltdown.\n\nIn 2010, Emay joined and released content with three different collaboration projects, which expanded Emay's connections in the music industry and lead to multiple collaboration with British hip hop artist [[Star Slinger]].<ref name=\":13\" /> The collaborations caught the attention of a blog called Potholes in my Blog and the [[Complex (magazine)|Complex Magazine's]] [[Pigeons & Planes]]\u2014both of which would go on to consistently promote Emay's music.<ref name=\":38\" />\n\nEmay's first extended play to be widely recognized was released in 2014 and was entitled ''Sinner, Song-Writer''.<ref name=\":52\" /><ref name=\":46\" /> Emay's debut full-length album entitled ''Ilah'' was released in 2017 to overwhelmingly positive reviews and lead to Emay being interviewed by a number of music news outlets and music magazines.<ref name=\":53\" /><ref name=\":54\" /><ref name=\":55\" /><ref name=\":49\" /><ref name=\":50\" /><ref name=\":51\" />  \n\n== Early life ==\nMubarik Gyenne-Adams (preferred name Mubarik Gyenne-Bayere) was born in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]] on December 18, 1991, the son of a couple who had immigrated to Canada from [[Ghana]] in the late 1980s. His legal last name Gyenne-Adams came from the first name of his paternal uncle Adam, and his preferred last name Gyenne-Bayere is reflective of the clans his parents came from within the [[Bissa people|Bissa ethnic group]] of West Africa. He and his four sisters were raised in a [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Muslims|Muslim]] household by his single mother. According to Mubarik's song titled \"Because Winter (feat. Lowell Boland)\", he was four years old when his father passed away. The family regularly moved between shelters throughout [[Ontario]]. As a child he attended Gateway Public Elementary School while living in [[Toronto]] before moving to Port Credit where he attended Riverside Public Elementary School. He lived in [[Brampton]] briefly where he attended [[Bramalea Secondary School]] before settling in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] where he attended [[Glendale Secondary School]].\n\nAccording to Emay he \"spent most of his childhood living in the Vendome patch of [[Flemingdon Park]], Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and then later moved to [[Brampton|Brampton, Ontario]] when he was in grade 5. Mubarik was first exposed to [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] when his immigrant cousin Nasara would constantly listen to [[Nas]] while living in the Vendome residence. His mother would listen to a lot of [[West African music|West African]], [[Reggae]], [[Disco]], Pop, [[Country music|Country]], [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], and [[religious music]]. Emay was a huge fan of [[Eminem]] and [[Dr. Dre]] when he was in elementary school, and would stick tissue into his mothers [[cassette tape]]s to record their music off of the radio. After Mubarik moved to [[Brampton]] in grade 5, he was no longer a fan of [[Hip hop|hip-hop]] as much and would recreate melodies on his sisters digital [[MIDI keyboard]]. He also began listening to [[jazz]] and classical music from the radio. When he reached grade 8, he became intrigued with [[Southern hip hop|southern hip-hop]], and was a big fan of [[T.I.]]'s [[Grand Hustle Records|Grand Hustle label]], and artists like [[Jeezy|Young Jeezy]], [[UGK]], and [[Boosie Badazz|Lil' Boosie]]. As he progressed through high school he began listening to more [[Old-school hip hop|old school]] and [[Underground hip hop|underground hip-hop]] acts such as [[Jedi Mind Tricks]], [[O.C. (rapper)|OC]], [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]], [[Showbiz and A.G.|Showbiz & A.G.]], and [[MF Doom]]. In 2006, he began creating instrumentals in [[FL Studio]] in attempt to mimic his favourite producers and artists. Mubarik learned how to create instrumentals in [[FL Studio]] after his online mentors Lion and Gravity gave him tips and advice. His online mentors also assisted him with his [[rapping]] as well. As he completed high school, he began listening to a lot more different genres including Classical, [[Classic rock music|Classic Rock]], [[Grunge]], [[Emo]], [[Alternative Music|Alternative]], [[Punk rock|Punk]], [[Soul music|Soul]], [[Ambient music|Ambient]], and more.\"\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== 2006\u20132013: Career Beginnings ===\nAccording to various profile biographies on numerous small streaming services as well as an interview on Revolutionary Left Radio, Mubarik began his musical career in 2006 at the age of fifteen. Leading up to his first major project, Mubarik focused on music production instead of emceeing and decided on the pseudonym Emay\u2014the phonetic spelling of his initials\u2014for his solo project. For the release of A.D.D., Mubarik stylized his stage name as EmAy, however, he never used the stylized spelling after 2008. Many of the biographies compare Emay to [[Pete Rock]], [[Madlib]], [[Stoupe the Enemy of Mankind]], [[Danger Mouse (musician)|Danger Mouse]], and 9th Wonder. Additionally, many of the biographies identify his music as [[Downtempo]], [[Electronica]], [[Chill-out music|Chillout]], [[Trip hop|Trip-Hop]], [[Emceeing]], and [[Conscious hip-hop]]. Emay emphasized multiple times on his [[Last.fm]] account biography that he was more interested in his music being known than the person behind the music.\n\nThe full-length album entitled ''A.D.D. (Altered Dynamic Dimensions)'' was released in the fall of 2008 and was distributed as a digital download on Emay's [[Myspace]] account and [[DatPiff]], however there has been some confusion as to the mixtapes exact release date. The mixtape was also promoted by the music blog and independent record label Vinyl Meltdown, which would continue to follow and promote Emay's music until the website shut down in 2015. The mixtape was entirely made up of remixed content by well-known artists such as [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy of Mobb Deep]], [[Nas]], [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]], and [[Eminem]]. The mixtape created some online activity and local buzz, but was not widely purchased or downloaded. The title of the mixtape is the acronym A.D.D., which is a reference to Mubarik's experiences with [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention-deficit disorder]] as well as the nature of the mixtape impulsively skipping from one artist's sample to another. The album artwork for the mixtape was illustrated by Chase Miles.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Emay|title=Free Music Archive: Emay|last=Adams|first=Mubarik|date=July 29, 2010|website=Free Music Archive|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200215201751/https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Emay|archive-date=February 15, 2020|access-date=February 15, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====== 2009: Child (Refugee) ======\nOn October 17, 2009 the single entitled ''Child (Refugee)'' was released under the independent record label entitled Vinyl Meltdown and Judge Mental Music. The release was made available as a free digital download on [[Myspace]] and [[Bandcamp]], and was promoted by Vinyl Meltdown. The single included the instrumental and a cappella versions as well as a bonus track entitled \"Surfin'\". The single included the first recorded verses to be written and performed by Emay as opposed to his sampling of other artists. The single's production elements and heart-wrenching story were received well, but critics responded negatively to the rapping style. The album artwork for the single was done by Austin Menard from Vinyl Meltdown, who would continue to work with Emay for about a year.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n====== 2010: Collaborations and Emay, Karen O, and The Kids ======\nIn 2009, Mubarik discovered the mixtape entitled ''La Guapa'' by Ivan Ice\u2014a Dutch music producer\u2014and after connecting online the two decided to work on a collaboration project called Ivan Ice & Emay. On February 11, 2010 the promotional single entitled ''Ze Drums'' along with the a cappella version was independently released and made available as a free digital download on [[Bandcamp]] and was promoted by Vinyl Meltdown. The single was positively received by blogs and music critics. Later that month, on February 23, 2010 the extended play entitled ''Sounds Like'' was independently released and made available as a free digital download on [[Bandcamp]] and was promoted by Vinyl Meltdown. The album artwork for both the single and extended play were done by Austin Menard. The extended play also garnered positive reviews from multiple blogs and music critics. The collaboration's music was featured on both Beatbox Radio Show and Under the Radar Radio Show. The song \"Get Ready\" was later selected to be on The Find Magazine's sequel playlist entitled Hazy Dreams II with Emay being mentioned as one of the highlights of the playlist.\n\nOn February 13, 2010 the song \"Worried Shoes\" was leaked by Potholes in My Blog to promote Emay's upcoming album. On April 26, 2010 the extended play entitled ''Emay, Karen O, and the Kids'' was independently released and made available as a free digital download on [[Myspace]] and [[Bandcamp]], and was promoted by Vinyl Meltdown. The album artwork was done by Theodore Taylor III. The album remixed six different tracks taken off of the ''[[Where the Wild Things Are: Motion Picture Soundtrack]]''\u2014originally composed by [[Karen O]]. The mixtape deviated from Emay's previous works as it was Emay's first [[instrumental]] content and the genre was identified as [[electronica]] rather than [[hip hop]] or [[Rapping|rap]]. The mixtape was praised by critics and blogs as being Emay's best work to date with the song \"Igloo\" as the album's highlight.<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite web|url=https://billingsgazette.com/entertainment/music/off-the-charts-emay-willie-nile-davis-coltrane/article_ce0d2686-6cd7-50d2-8a50-8011da978336.html|title=Off the Charts: Emay, Willie Nile, Davis-Coltrane|last=Jorgensen|first=Chris|date=December 26, 2014|website=The Billings Gazette|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150125082012/https://billingsgazette.com/entertainment/music/off-the-charts-emay-willie-nile-davis-coltrane/article_ce0d2686-6cd7-50d2-8a50-8011da978336.html|archive-date=January 25, 2015|access-date=February 17, 2020}}</ref>\n\nEmay joined another collaboration project in 2010 called RockPaperScissors consisting of Emay, EOM also known as Elements of Music, and Remot.<ref name=\":36\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/music/Emay/+wiki?ver=35|title=Emay biography|last=Adams|first=Mubarik|date=October 8, 2010|website=Last.fm|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320141234/https://www.last.fm/music/Emay/+wiki?ver=35|archive-date=March 20, 2020|access-date=March 20, 2020}}</ref> On July 24, 2010 the extended play entitled ''Rock.

Mubarik has also been involved with the [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]-based [[Marxism\u2013Leninism|Marxist-Lenninist]] organization called [[Serve the People]].\n\n=== On Mass ===\n\nOn January 16, 2018 Mubarik released the first episode of his podcast entitled ''On Mass''. In the episode, Mubarik explains that his \"goal with this podcast is to basically interpret global and local events through a revolutionary communist perspective or lens and emphasize the importance of revolution for workers and basically oppressed people all over the world if you want to see actual fundamental change.\" When describing his political leanings on the episode Mubarik stated that \"politically speaking I refer to myself as a [[Maoism|Maoist]] and I'm a supporter of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party of Canada]] known as the [[PCR-RCP]] more particularly I adhere to [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] ideologically\"\n\nIn the sixth episode, released June 8, 2019, Mubarik mentions that he \"started a new website entitled 'leftistaudiobooks.com' and this is basically just me trying to spread more revolutionary ideas and things like that and making it more accessible because I know a lot of people listen to audiobooks and I listen to audiobooks a lot while I'm working and things like that so that's why I wanted to start this project.\" The website currently only has a single book available entitled [[Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism|Imperialism the Highest Stage of Capitalism]] by [[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Ilyich Lenin]].\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of On Mass Episodes\n!Episode No.\n!Title\n!Guests\n!Original Air Date\n!Notes\n|-\n|1\n|Marxism-Leninism-Maoism with J.

The episode was entitled \"On Mass: Maoism, Hip Hop, & Black Panther\". The episode cites Maoist Rebel News\u2014a small news site and blog run by Jason Unruhe\u2014as a bad representation of [[Maoism]]. The episode features songs from Emay's album ''Ilah'' including \"Lilac (feat. Kamilah and L-SPEX)\" and \"Israfil 'angels trumpet'\" as well as an unreleased song entitled \"Volunteer\". Mubarik states that the biggest misconceptions concerning [[Maoism]] is the conflation of [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism]] with [[Mao-Zedong-Thought|Mao Zedong Thought]], the dogmatic view that everything [[Mao Zedong|Mao]] said is correct and representative of [[Maoism]], and that a [[Cultural Revolution]] is not necessary. Mubarik cites the [[Black Power movement]], The Revolutionary Internationalist Movement, and [[Shining Path|The Shining Path]] as some of the first and imperfect examples of attempting to implement Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism and cites the book entitled The Unknown Cultural Revolution written by Dongping Han as a good source for understanding the [[Cultural Revolution]]. The episode spends some time discussing the [[Black Panther Party]] and its attempt at implementing [[Marxism\u2013Leninism\u2013Maoism|Marxism-Leninnism-Maoism]] in the 1960s and how the [[Black Panther (film)|Black Pather Movie]] was not representative of the party or the ideology. On the episode, Breht O'Shea claims that there is a direct historical lineage from [[Malcolm X]] to the [[Black Panther Party]] to [[Hip hop]], which Mubarik agreed with and expanded on.\n\n== Discography ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Full-Length Albums\n!Title\n!Album Details\n|-\n|Ilah\n|\n* Released: February 24, 2017\n* Label: Jet Jam, Tomorrow Archaic\n* Format: digital download, [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n|-\n|Adam\n|\n*Released: April 6, 2012\n* Label: Tomorrow Archaic\n* Format: digital download\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+'''Extended Plays'''\n!Title\n!Details\n|-\n|Sinner, Song-Writer\n|\n* Released: December 16, 2014\n* Label: [[Last Gang Records|Last Gang Records, Inc.]] / Hi-Scores Recording Library\n* Format: digital download, [[Cassette tape|cassette]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hiscoresrecordinglibrary.com/releases/emay/|title=EMAY {{!}} Hi-Scores Website|date=April 30, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150430100257/http://hiscoresrecordinglibrary.com/releases/emay/|access-date=February 17, 2020|archive-date=April 30, 2015}}</ref> [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n|-\n|Incorruptible\n|\n* Released: March 21, 2011\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Mixtapes\n!Title\n!Details\n|-\n|Into It\n|\n* Released: October 30, 2012\n* Label: Potholes Music\n* Format: digital download, [[Streaming media|streaming]]\n|-\n|Mind Altering Dynamics (Instrumentals)\n|\n*Released: January 18, 2011\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|Mind Altering Dynamics\n|\n* Released: January 18, 2011\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|Emay, Karen O, and the Kids\n|\n* Released: April 26, 2010\n* Label: Self-released\n* Format: digital download\n|-\n|A.D.D.
